20409350,"<e>Hybridization</e> and speciation in angiosperms: a role for pollinator shifts?The majority of convincingly documented cases of hybridization in angiosperms has involved genetic introgression between the parental species or formation of a hybrid species with increased ploidy; however, homoploid (diploid) hybridization may be just as common. Recent studies, including one in BMC Evolutionary Biology, show that pollinator shifts can play a role in both mechanisms of hybrid speciation.",M1
20374792,"Meat quality parameters of descendants by grading <e>hybridization</e> of Boer goat and Guanzhong Dairy goat.Chemical composition, cholesterol levels, fatty acid profile, meat taste, and quality parameters were evaluated in 48 buck kids from goats of the Guanzhong Dairy breed (Group G) and their crosses (Group F1: 1/2 Boermale symbolx1/2 Guanzhong Dairyfemale symbol; Group F2: 3/4 Boermale symbolx1/4 Guanzhong Dairyfemale symbol; Group F3: 7/8 Boermale symbolx1/8 Guanzhong Dairyfemale symbol) at different ages of slaughter (6, 8 and 10 months). Results indicated that grading hybridization (P&lt;0.05) affected meat nutritive value. The muscle of hybrid goats had lower crude fat and cholesterol, higher crude protein, and greater proportion of C18:2 and C18:3 than that of Group G at each age. Group F1 goats had better (P&lt;0.05) desirable fatty acid (DFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) to saturated fatty acid (SFA) ratios and greater (C18:0+C18:1/C16:0) ratios (P&lt;0.01) than those of the other genotypes. Furthermore, the muscles of hybrid goats were tenderer and juicier compared to Group G. In all four groups, cholesterol levels increased (P&lt;0.01), muscle color became redder (P&lt;0.05) and tenderness decreased (P&lt;0.05) with increasing age. The low level of lipids and cholesterol, good meat quality, and the higher ratio of unsaturated to SFA in Group F1 indicate better quality for human consumption.",M1
20331778,"Nucleotide divergence vs. gene expression differentiation: comparative transcriptome sequencing in natural isolates from the carrion crow and its hybrid zone with the hooded crow.Recent advances in sequencing technology promise to provide new strategies for studying population differentiation and speciation phenomena in their earliest phases. We focus here on the black carrion crow (Corvus [corone] corone), which forms a zone of <e>hybridization</e> and overlap with the grey coated hooded crow (Corvus [corone] cornix). However, although these semispecies are taxonomically distinct, previous analyses based on several types of genetic markers did not reveal significant molecular differentiation between them. We here corroborate this result with sequence data obtained from a set of 25 nuclear intronic loci. Thus, the system represents a case of a very early phase of species divergence that requires new molecular approaches for its description. We have therefore generated RNAseq expression profiles using barcoded massively parallel pyrosequencing of brain mRNA from six individuals of the carrion crow and five individuals from a hybrid zone with the hooded crow. We obtained 856 675 reads from two runs, with average read length of 270 nt and coverage of 8.44. Reads were assembled de novo into 19 552 contigs, 70% of which could be assigned to annotated genes in chicken and zebra finch. This resulted in a total of 7637 orthologous genes and a core set of 1301 genes that could be compared across all individuals. We find a clear clustering of expression profiles for the pure carrion crow animals and disperse profiles for the animals from the hybrid zone. These results suggest that gene expression differences may indeed be a sensitive indicator of initial species divergence.",M1
20351771,"Reinforcement of gametic isolation in Drosophila.Reinforcement, a process by which natural selection increases reproductive isolation between populations, has been suggested to be an important force in the formation of new species. However, all existing cases of reinforcement involve an increase in mate discrimination between species. Here, I report the first case of reinforcement of postmating prezygotic isolation (i.e., barriers that act after mating but before fertilization) in animals. On the slopes of the African island of São Tomé, Drosophila yakuba and its endemic sister species D. santomea hybridize within a well-demarcated hybrid zone. I find that D. yakuba females from within this zone, but not from outside it, show an increase in gametic isolation from males of D. santomea, an apparent result of natural selection acting to reduce maladaptive <e>hybridization</e> between species. To determine whether such a barrier could evolve under laboratory conditions, I exposed D. yakuba lines derived from allopatric populations to experimental sympatry with D. santomea, and found that both behavioral and gametic isolation become stronger after only four generations. Reinforcement thus appears to be the best explanation for the heightened gametic isolation seen in sympatry. This appears to be the first example in animals in which natural selection has promoted the evolution of stronger interspecific genetic barriers that act after mating but before fertilization. This suggests that many other genetic barriers between species have been increased by natural selection but have been overlooked because they are difficult to study.",M1
20350300,"Genetic population structure of sympatric and allopatric populations of Baltic ciscoes (Coregonus albula complex, Teleostei, Coregonidae).BACKGROUND: Teleost fishes of the Coregonidae are good model systems for studying postglacial evolution, adaptive radiation and ecological speciation. Of particular interest is whether the repeated occurrence of sympatric species pairs results from in-situ divergence from a single lineage or from multiple invasions of one or more different lineages. Here, we analysed the genetic structure of Baltic ciscoes (Coregonus albula complex), examining 271 individuals from 8 lakes in northern Germany using 1244 polymorphic AFLP loci. Six lakes had only one population of C. albula while the remaining two lakes had C. albula as well as a sympatric species (C. lucinensis or C. fontanae). RESULTS: AFLP demonstrated a significant population structure (Bayesian thetaB = 0.22). Lower differentiation between allopatric (thetaB = 0.028) than sympatric (0.063-0.083) populations contradicts the hypothesis of a sympatric origin of taxa, and there was little evidence for stocking or ongoing <e>hybridization</e>. Genome scans found only three loci that appeared to be under selection in both sympatric population pairs, suggesting a low probability of similar mechanisms of ecological segregation. However, removal of all non-neutral loci decreased the genetic distance between sympatric pairs, suggesting recent adaptive divergence at a few loci. Sympatric pairs in the two lakes were genetically distinct from the six other C. albula populations, suggesting introgression from another lineage may have influenced these two lakes. This was supported by an analysis of isolation-by-distance, where the drift-gene flow equilibrium observed among allopatric populations was disrupted when the sympatric pairs were included. CONCLUSIONS: While the population genetic data alone can not unambiguously uncover the mode of speciation, our data indicate that multiple lineages may be responsible for the complex patterns typically observed in Coregonus. Relative differences within and among lakes raises the possibility that multiple lineages may be present in northern Germany, thus understanding the postglacial evolution and speciation in the C. albula complex requires a large-scale phylogenetic analysis of several potential founder lineages.",M1
20345692,"<e>Hybridization</e> and polyploidy as drivers of continuing evolution and speciation in Sorbus.Interspecific hybridization and polyploidy are pivotal processes in plant evolution and speciation. The fate of new hybrid and polyploid taxa is determined by their ability to reproduce either sexually or asexually. Hybrids and allopolyploids with odd chromosome numbers are frequently sterile but some establish themselves through asexual reproduction (vegetative or apomixis). This allows novel genotypes to become established by isolating them from gene flow and leads to complex patterns of variation. The genus Sorbus is a good example of taxonomic complexity arising from the combined effects of hybridization, polyploidy and apomixis. The Avon Gorge in South-west Britain contains the greatest diversity of Sorbus in Europe, with three endemic species and four putative endemic novel hybrids among its 15 native Sorbus taxa. We used a combination of nuclear microsatellite and chloroplast DNA markers to investigate the evolutionary relationships among these Sorbus taxa within the Avon Gorge. We confirm the genetic identity of putative novel taxa and show that hybridization involving sexual diploid species, primarily S. aria and S. torminalis and polyploid facultative apomictic species from subgenus Aria, has been responsible for generating this biodiversity. Importantly our data show that this creative evolutionary process is ongoing within the Avon Gorge. Conservation strategies for the rare endemic Sorbus taxa should therefore consider all Sorbus taxa within the Gorge and must strive to preserve this evolutionary process rather than simply the individual rare taxa that it produces.",M1
20309618,"Species by environment interactions affect pyrrolizidine alkaloid expression in Senecio jacobaea, Senecio aquaticus, and their hybrids.We examined the effects of water and nutrient availability on the expression of the defense pyrrolizidine alkaloids (PAs) in Senecio jacobaea and S. aquaticus. Senecio jacobaea, and S. aquaticus are adapted to different natural habitats, characterized by differing abiotic conditions and different selection pressures from natural enemies. We tested if PA concentration and diversity are plastic over a range of water and nutrient treatments, and also whether such plasticity is dependent on plant species. We also tested the hypothesis that <e>hybridization</e> may contribute to PA diversity within plants, by comparing PA expression in parental species to that in artificially generated F(1) hybrids, and also in later generation natural hybrids between S. jacobaea and S. aquaticus. We showed that total PA concentration in roots and shoots is not dependent on species, but that species determines the pattern of PA diversification. Pyrrolizidine alkaloid diversity and concentration are both dependent on environmental factors. Hybrids produce a putatively novel PA, and this PA is conserved in natural hybrids, that are backcrossed to S. jacobaea. Natural hybrids that are backcrossed several times to S. jacobaea are with regard to PA diversity significantly different from S. jacobaea but not from S. aquaticus, while F(1) hybrids are in all cases more similar to S. jacobaea. These results collectively suggest that PA diversity is under the influence of natural selection.",M1
20298473,"Historical male-mediated introgression in horseshoe bats revealed by multilocus DNA sequence data.Instances of <e>hybridization</e> between mammalian taxa in the wild are rarely documented. To test for introgression between sibling species of horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus yunanensis and R. pearsoni) and two subspecies of the latter (R. p. pearsoni and R. p. chinensis), we sequenced two mtDNA and two ncDNA markers in individuals sampled from multiple localities within their overlapping ranges. The interspecific mtDNA gene tree corresponded to the expected taxonomic divisions, and coalescent-based analyses suggested divergence occurred around 4 MYA. However, these relationships strongly conflicted with those recovered from two independent nuclear gene trees, in which R. yunanensis clustered with R. p. pearsoni to the exclusion of R. p. chinensis. This geographically widespread discordance is best explained by large-scale historical introgression of ncDNA from R. yunanensis to R. pearsoni by male-mediated exchange in mixed species colonies during Pleistocene glacial periods, when ranges may have contracted and overlapped more than at present. Further species tree-gene tree conflicts were detected between R. p. pearsoni and R. p. chinensis, also indicating past and/or current introgression in their overlapping regions. However, here the patterns point to asymmetric mtDNA introgression without ncDNA introgression. Analyses of coalescence times indicate this exchange has occurred subsequent to the divergence of these subspecies from their common ancestor. Our work highlights the importance of using multiple data sets for reconstructing phylogeographic histories and resolving taxonomic relationships.",M1
20298471,"Recurrent nuclear DNA introgression accompanies chloroplast DNA exchange between two eucalypt species.Numerous studies within plant genera have found geographically structured sharing of chloroplast (cp) DNA among sympatric species, consistent with introgressive <e>hybridization</e>. Current research is aimed at understanding the extent, direction and significance of nuclear (nr) DNA exchange that accompanies putative cpDNA exchange. Eucalyptus is a complex tree genus for which cpDNA sharing has been established between multiple species. Prior phylogeographic analysis has indicated cpDNA introgression into the widespread forest species Eucalyptus globulus from its rare congener E. cordata. In this study, we use AFLP markers to characterize corresponding nrDNA introgression, on both a broad and fine spatial scale. Using 388 samples we examine (i) the fine-scale spatial structure of cp and nrDNA introgression from E. cordata into E. globulus at a site in natural forest and (ii) broad-scale patterns of AFLP marker introgression at six additional mixed populations. We show that while E. globulus and E. cordata retain strongly differentiated nuclear gene pools overall, leakage of nrDNA occurs at mixed populations, with some AFLP markers being transferred to E. globulus recurrently at different sites. On the fine scale, different AFLP fragments show varying distances of introgression into E. globulus, while introgression of cpDNA is extensive. The frequency of E. cordata markers in E. globulus is correlated with spatial proximity to E. cordata, but departs from expectations based on AFLP marker frequency in E. cordata, indicating that selection may be governing the persistence of introgressed fragments in E. globulus.",M1
20231169,"Identification of genes associated with bud dormancy release in Prunus persica by suppression subtractive <e>hybridization</e>.To better understand the molecular and physiological mechanisms underlying maintenance and release of seasonal bud dormancy in perennial trees, we identified differentially expressed genes during dormancy progression in reproductive buds from peach (Prunus persica [L.] Batsch) by suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH) and microarray hybridization. Four SSH libraries were constructed, which were respectively enriched in cDNA highly expressed in dormant buds (named DR), in dormancy-released buds (RD) and in the cultivars with different chilling requirement, 'Zincal 5' (ZS) and 'Springlady' (SZ), sampled after dormancy release. About 2500 clones picked from the four libraries were loaded on a glass microarray. Hybridization of microarrays with the final products of SSH procedure was performed in order to validate the selected clones that were effectively enriched in their respective sample. Nearly 400 positive clones were sequenced, which corresponded to 101 different unigenes with diverse functional annotation. We obtained DAM4, 5 and 6 genes coding for MADS-box transcription factors previously related to growth cessation and terminal bud formation in the evergrowing mutant of peach. Several other cDNAs are similar to dormancy factors described in other species, and others have been related to bud dormancy for the first time in this study. Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis confirmed differential expression of cDNAs coding for a Zn-finger transcription factor, a GRAS-like regulator, a DNA-binding protein and proteins similar to forisome subunits involved in the reversible occlusion of sieve elements in Fabaceae, among others.",M1
20213533,"Pre-zygotic factors best explain reproductive isolation between the hybridizing species of brittle-stars Acrocnida brachiata and A. spatulispina (Echinodermata: Ophiuroidea).The two brittle-stars Acrocnida brachiata (Montagu 1804) and A. spatulispina (Stöhr and Muths in J Mar Biol Assoc, 2009) exhibit strong spatial segregation along the coast of Brittany (France), the first being subtidally distributed relative to the other intertidal species. Despite a very high degree of mitochondrial DNA divergence, previous preliminary results hinted at the potential for <e>hybridization</e> to occur. Therefore, we specifically aim to determine local levels of hybridization between these two species and to investigate the relative roles of pre- and post- zygotic isolation processes acting to decrease local hybridization patterns. Mitochondrial DNA, allozymes and the Internal Transcribed Spacer 2 region of the ribosomal DNA were all used on 529 brittle-stars sampled locally in June and September 2005, among six stations in Douarnenez Bay, a site situated at the tip of Brittany. Only 2.6% of all samples analyzed were identified as potential hybrids. However, these were twice more frequent in June, just after the reproductive period, than in September after selective mortality acted to reduce the proportions of hybrids. In addition to the abrupt bathymetric segregation between the two species, spawning asynchrony also clearly restricts hybridization to low levels, which shows the importance of pre-zygotic mechanisms in maintaining reproductive isolation. Moreover, both limited hybridization events and adult mortalities following reproduction tend to generate local genetic differentiation at the intra-species level. On the contrary, the genetic structure is homogenized by migration of juveniles or adults and hybrids mortalities over the summer period.",M1
20204401,"The chromosome content and genotype of two wheat cell lines and of their somatic fusion product with oat.Somatic <e>hybridization</e> seeks to genetically combine phylogenetically distant parents. An effective system has been established in bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) involving protoplasts from a non-totipotent cell line adapted to in vitro culture (T(1)) in combination with totipotent protoplasts harvested from embryogenic calli (T(2)). Here, we report the karyotype and genotype of T(1) and T(2). Line T(1) carries nine A (A-genome of wheat), seven B (B-genome of wheat) and eight D (D-genome of wheat) genome chromosomes, while T(2) cells have 12 A, 10 B and 12 D genome chromosomes. Rates of chromosome aberration in the B- and D-genomes were more than 25%, higher than in the A-genome. DNA deletion rates were 55.6% in T(1) and 19.4% in T(2), and DNA variation rates were 8.3% in T(1) and 13.9% in T(2). Rate of DNA elimination was B- &gt; D- &gt; A-genome in both T(1) and T(2). The same set of cytological and genetic assays was applied to a derivative of the somatic fusion between protoplasts of T(1), T(2) and oat (Avena sativa L.). The regenerant plants were near euploid with respect to their wheat complement. Six wheat chromosome arms-4AL, 3BS, 4BL, 3DS, 6DL and 7DL-carried small introgressed segments of oat chromatin. A genotypic analysis of the hybrid largely confirmed this cytologically-based diagnosis.",M1

20194169,"Conspecific versus heterospecific gene exchange between populations of Darwin's finches.This study addresses the extent and consequences of gene exchange between populations of Darwin's finches. Four species of ground finches (Geospiza) inhabit the small island of Daphne Major in the centre of the Galápagos archipelago. We undertook a study of microsatellite DNA variation at 16 loci in order to quantify gene flow within species owing to immigration and between species owing to <e>hybridization</e>. A combination of pedigrees of observed breeders and assignments of individuals to populations by the program Structure enabled us to determine the frequency of gene exchange and the island of origin of immigrants in some cases. The relatively large populations of Geospiza fortis and G. scandens receive conspecific immigrants at a rate of less than one per generation. They exchange genes more frequently by rare but repeated hybridization. Effects of heterospecific gene flow from hybridization are not counteracted by lower fitness of the offspring. As a result, the standing genetic variation of the two main resident populations on Daphne Major is enhanced to a greater extent by introgressive hybridization than through breeding with conspecific immigrants. Immigrant G. fuliginosa also breeds with G. fortis. Conspecific immigration was highest in the fourth species, G. magnirostris. This species is much larger than the other three and perhaps for this reason it has not bred with any of them. The source island of most immigrants is probably the neighbouring island of Santa Cruz. Evolutionary change may be inhibited in G. magnirostris by continuing gene flow, but enhanced in G. fortis and G. scandens by introgressive hybridization.",M1
20165963,"Physical mapping of rDNA genes corroborates allopolyploid origin in apomictic Brachiaria brizantha.Brachiaria (Trin.) Griseb belongs to the family Poaceae, and within the genus, apomixis or sexuality is present in different accessions of the same species. The majority of Brachiaria species are polyploid and apomictic, making strategies for crop improvement by breeding very intricate. In spite of the high frequency of apomictic polyploids, the relationship of polyploidy and <e>hybridization</e> with apomixis in Brachiaria is still unclear. Further analysis requires detailed knowledge regarding the genomic composition of the polyploids. The present work introduces the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) into cytogenetic analysis of Brachiaria. Physical mapping of heterologous rDNA sequences, associated with conventional karyotyping of the B. brizantha diploid sexual (BRA 002747) and the tetraploid apomictic (BRA000591) accessions, provided evidence of the latter being of allopolyploid origin. Based on our results and on previous knowledge on apomixis in B. brizantha, we suggest that the origin of apomixis was probably a consequence of hybridization.",M1
20149116,"Newly synthesized wheat allohexaploids display progenitor-dependent meiotic stability and aneuploidy but structural genomic additivity.To understand key mechanisms leading to stabilized allopolyploid species, we characterized the meiotic behaviour of wheat allohexaploids in relation to structural and genetic changes. For that purpose, we analysed first generations of synthetic allohexaploids obtained through interspecific <e>hybridization</e>, followed by spontaneous chromosome doubling, between several genotypes of Triticum turgidum and Aegilops tauschii wheat species, donors of AB and D genomes, respectively. As expected for these Ph1 (Pairing homoeologous 1) gene-carrying allopolyploids, chromosome pairing at metaphase I of meiosis essentially occurs between homologous chromosomes. However, the different synthetic allohexaploids exhibited progenitor-dependent meiotic irregularities, such as incomplete homologous pairing, resulting in univalent formation and leading to aneuploidy in the subsequent generation. Stability of the synthetic allohexaploids was shown to depend on the considered genotypes of both AB and D genome progenitors, where few combinations compare to the natural wheat allohexaploid in terms of regularity of meiosis and euploidy. Aneuploidy represents the only structural change observed in these synthetic allohexaploids, as no apparent DNA sequence elimination or rearrangement was observed when analysing euploid plants with molecular markers, developed from expressed sequence tags (ESTs) as well as simple sequence repeat (SSR) and transposable element sequences.",M1
20149114,"Transcriptomic changes following recent natural <e>hybridization</e> and allopolyploidy in the salt marsh species Spartina x townsendii and Spartina anglica (Poaceae).Allopolyploidy results from two events: the merger of divergent genomes and genome duplication. Both events have important functional consequences for the evolution and adaptation of newly formed allopolyploid species. In spite of the significant progress made in recent years, few studies have decoupled the effects of hybridization from genome duplication in the observed patterns of expression changes accompanying allopolyploidy in natural conditions. We used Agilent rice oligomicroarrays to explore gene expression changes following allopolyploidy in Spartina that includes a classic example of recent allopolyploid speciation: S. anglica formed during the 19th century following genome duplication of the hybrid S. x townsendii. Our data indicate important, but different, effects of hybridization and genome duplication in the expression patterns of the hybrid and allopolyploid. Deviation from parental additivity was most important following hybridization and was accompanied by maternal expression dominance, although transgressively expressed genes were also encountered. Maternal dominance was attenuated following genome duplication in S. anglica, but this species exhibits an increased number of transgressively overexpressed genes. These results reflect the decoupled effects of the 'genomic shock' following hybridization and genome redundancy on the genetic, epigenetic and regulatory mechanisms characterizing transcriptomic evolution in allopolyploids.",M1
20147372,"Asymmetrical conspecific seed-siring advantage between Silene latifolia and S. dioica.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Silene dioica and S. latifolia experience only limited introgression despite overlapping flowering phenologies, geographical distributions, and some pollinator sharing. Conspecific pollen precedence and other reproductive barriers operating between pollination and seed germination may limit <e>hybridization</e>. This study investigates whether barriers at this stage contribute to reproductive isolation between these species and, if so, which mechanisms are responsible. METHODS: Pollen-tube lengths for pollen of both species in styles of both species were compared. Additionally, both species were pollinated with majority S. latifolia and majority S. dioica pollen mixes; then seed set, seed germination rates and hybridity of the resulting seedlings were determined using species-specific molecular markers. KEY RESULTS: The longest pollen tubes were significantly longer for conspecific than heterospecific pollen in both species, indicating conspecific pollen precedence. Seed set but not seed germination was lower for flowers pollinated with pure heterospecific versus pure conspecific pollen. Mixed-species pollinations resulted in disproportionately high representation of nonhybrid offspring for pollinations of S. latifolia but not S. dioica flowers. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of conspecific pollen precedence for pollen-tube growth but not seed siring in S. dioica flowers may be explained by variation in pollen-tube growth rates, either at different locations in the style or between leading and trailing pollen tubes. Additionally, this study finds a barrier to hybridization operating between pollination and seed germination against S. dioica but not S. latifolia pollen. The results are consistent with the underlying cause of this barrier being attrition of S. dioica pollen tubes or reduced success of heterospecifically fertilized ovules, rather than time-variant mechanisms. Post-pollination, pre-germination barriers to hybridization thus play a partial role in limiting introgression between these species.",M1

20142262,"Window of opportunity: an episode of recruitment in a Banksia hybrid zone demonstrates continuing <e>hybridization</e> and phenotypic plasticity.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In perennial plants (especially post-fire resprouters), extant populations may reflect recruitment events in the distant past. This is true of hybrid zones formed by two Banksia species of swamps and woodlands in south-eastern Australia, Banksia robur and B. oblongifolia. Both resprout after fire but recruitment is dependent on periodic fires. Although plants of intermediate morphology have also been identified as hybrids using allozyme markers, the extent of ongoing hybridization is unknown. This study investigates whether both microsatellite markers and morphological measurements can be used to distinguish between the two species and their hybrids. A recent recruitment event and microsatellite markers allow the frequency of ongoing hybridization to be estimated, and also the effects of environmental variation on the morphology of plants and seedlings to be tested. METHODS: Variation at seven microsatellite loci was scored and seven leaf characteristics within putatively pure stands and mixed stands of both species were measured, revealing that the two species were genetically and morphologically distinct and that mixed stands also contained genetically and sometimes morphologically distinct hybrids. An opportunity created by wildfires was used to analyse the genetics and morphometrics of adults and seedlings from two hybrid zones. KEY RESULTS: Approximately 9 % of adults and 21 % of seedlings were identified as genetic hybrids in both hybrid zones. Within these sites, the genotype of mature plants correlated well with morphology, except for some hybrid plants that had parental morphology. However, seedling morphology was highly variable and insufficient to describe the composition of the hybrid zone in this cohort. Greater phenotypic plasticity was evident among seedlings growing within the hybrid zones than seedlings growing in pots. CONCLUSIONS: The hybrid zones are complex and the range of genotypes detected in seedlings reveals both continuing hybridization and introgression.",M1
20138225,"Systematic relationships and taxonomy of Suncus montanus and S. murinus from Sri Lanka.Here we use nuclear and mitochondrial DNA sequence data, combined with morphometric analyses, to clarify the systematic relationships and taxonomy of two complex species of shrews, Suncus montanus and S. murinus, in Sri Lanka. We find that subspecies of S. murinus, Suncus murinus murinus from Anuaradhapura and S. m. caerulescens from Colombo, show little or no genetic difference in the mitochondrial (cytochrome-b and 16SrRNA) and nuclear (Rag 1, aldolase C and EF-1 alpha intron) genes, confirming their classification as a single species. However, two populations of S. murinus from Peradeniya and Udawalawe are identified as putative hybrids of S. murinus and S. montanus. Shrews collected from Peradeniya are best described as a population of S. murinus, but could be identified as S.m. kandianus using morphological features. Nuclear DNA sequence data places this population in a clade with other S. murinus, but mtDNA sequences of the population nests within a clade of S. montanus haplotypes. This discordant pattern of nuclear and mitochondrial genes suggests either <e>hybridization</e> between S. murinus and S. montanus or introgression of S. montanus mitochondrial DNA into S. m. kandianus. S. m. murinus from Udawalawe, which shows no distinct morphological difference from S. m. murinus from Anuradhapura, falls in the clade of S. murinus in both nuclear and mitochondrial trees. In the nuclear gene tree however, S. m.murinus from Udawalawe is placed as a sister taxon to the clade including other S. murinus. Rag 1 gene sequences in Udawalawe individuals suggest recombination of S. murinus and S. montanus DNA within the gene. However, additional nuclear genes are necessary to study the extent of the hybridization of S. murinus and S. montanus.",M1
20138222,"Introgressive <e>hybridization</e> in North American hakes after secondary contact.High levels of bidirectional introgressive hybridization were found between the two Atlantic North American hakes Merluccius albidus and M. bilinearis in their overlapping distribution area between the 34 and the 42 degrees N parallels, employing mitochondrial and nuclear DNA markers. Absence of F(1) hybrids, and varied levels of bidirectional introgression, indicate long-time hybridization and backcrossing. Based on the evolutionary history of the genus Merluccius, originated in this area from the ancestor of the present M. bilinearis by the rise of the Panama Isthmus, secondary contact between the two species has probably been promoted by northwards displacement of M. albidus. Higher introgression rates in southern areas of M. albidus could be explained by restricted gene flow in that area which may allow long-term accumulation of introgressed genes.",M1
20122132,"Long-term persistence of crop alleles in weedy populations of wild radish (Raphanus raphanistrum).*<e>Hybridization</e> allows transgenes and other crop alleles to spread to wild/weedy populations of related taxa. Researchers have debated whether such alleles will persist because low hybrid fitness and linkage to domestication traits could severely impede introgression. *To examine variation in the fates of three unlinked crop alleles, we monitored four experimental, self-seeding, hybrid populations of Raphanus raphanistrum x Raphanus sativus (radish) in Michigan, USA, over a decade. We also compared the fecundity of advanced-generation hybrid plants with wild plants in a common garden experiment. *Initially, F(1) hybrids had reduced fitness, but the populations quickly evolved wild-type pollen fertility. In Year 10, the fecundity of plants from the experimental populations was similar to that of wild genotypes. Crop-specific alleles at the three loci persisted for 10 yr in all populations, and their frequencies varied among loci, populations and years. *This research provides a unique case study of substantial variation in the rates and patterns of crop allele introgression after a single hybridization event. Our findings demonstrate that certain crop alleles can introgress easily while others remain rare, supporting the assumption that neutral or beneficial transgenes that are not linked to maladaptive traits can persist in the wild.",M1
20109479,"Quantifying stochastic introgression processes with hazard rates.Introgression is the permanent incorporation of genes from one population into another through <e>hybridization</e> and backcrossing. It can have large environmental consequences, such as the spread of insecticide or herbicide resistant genes, the escape of transgenes from genetically modified crops, and the invasion of exotic genes into new habitats. Introgression usually involves strong random components, such as rare hybridization and backcrossing events, and demographic variation in reproduction and survival. Most introgression studies ignore these random effects, and consequently fail to accurately assess the risk of introgression. This paper presents a methodology for quantifying stochastic introgression processes, based on multitype branching process models. We derive a quantity called the hazard rate, which can be used to investigate how the risk of introgression depends on crop management and life history.",M1
20102517,"Investigating temporal changes in <e>hybridization</e> and introgression in a predominantly bimodal hybridizing population of invasive sika (Cervus nippon) and native red deer (C. elaphus) on the Kintyre Peninsula, Scotland.We investigated temporal changes in hybridization and introgression between native red deer (Cervus elaphus) and invasive Japanese sika (Cervus nippon) on the Kintyre Peninsula, Scotland, over 15 years, through analysis of 1513 samples of deer at 20 microsatellite loci and a mtDNA marker. We found no evidence that either the proportion of recent hybrids, or the levels of introgression had changed over the study period. Nevertheless, in one population where the two species have been in contact since approximately 1970, 44% of individuals sampled during the study were hybrids. This suggests that hybridization between these species can proceed fairly rapidly. By analysing the number of alleles that have introgressed from polymorphic red deer into the genetically homogenous sika population, we reconstructed the haplotypes of red deer alleles introduced by backcrossing. Five separate hybridization events could account for all the recently hybridized sika-like individuals found across a large section of the Peninsula. Although we demonstrate that low rates of F1 hybridization can lead to substantial introgression, the progress of hybridization and introgression appears to be unpredictable over the short timescales.",M1
20092040,"Compatibility of interspecific Manihot crosses presaged by protein electrophoresis .Cross incompatibility of wild Manihot species with cassava (M. esculenta) can impede their utilization for improving this cultigen. We tested whether compatibility could be determined based on electrophoresis results. Manihot pilosa, M. glaziovii, M. reptans, and M. cearulescens were tested. These species were allowed to hybridize with cassava to determine whether <e>hybridization</e> coincides with the similarity index based on electrophoresis analysis. Gene markers of leaf shape, stem surface, disk color, and fruit shape were used to confirm hybridization.

This result coincided with the similarity index from electrophoresis.",M1
20070520,"Marine genetic swamping: hybrids replace an obligately estuarine fish.Populations of obligately estuarine taxa are potentially small and isolated and may lack genetic variation and display regional differentiation as a result of drift and inbreeding. <e>Hybridization</e> with a wide-ranging marine congener should introduce genetic variation and reduce the effects of inbreeding depression and genetic drift. However, high levels of hybridization can cause demographic and genetic swamping. In southeastern Australia hybridization occurs between obligately estuarine Black bream (Acanthopagrus butcheri) and migratory marine Yellowfin bream (Acanthopagrus australis). Here, we surveyed genetic variation at eight microsatellite loci and the mitochondrial control region of juvenile fish from five coastal lagoons (including temporal replication in two lagoons) (total n = 970) to determine the frequency and persistence of hybridization, and its likely consequence for the estuarine restricted A. butcheri. Of 688 juvenile fish genotyped 95% were either A. australis (347) or hybrids (309); only 5% (32) were A. butcheri. Most hybrids were later generation hybrids or A. butcheri backcrosses, which are likely multi-generational residents within lagoons. Far greater proportions of hybrid juveniles were found within two lagoons that are generally closed to the ocean (&gt;90% hybrid fish within generally closed lagoons vs. 12-27% in permanently or intermittently open lagoons). In both lagoons, this was consistent across multiple cohorts of fish [79-97% hybrid fish (n = 282)]. Hybridization and introgression represent a major threat to the persistence of A. butcheri and have yet to be investigated for large numbers of estuarine taxa.",M1
20064268,"Molecular and cellular evidence for biased mitotic gene conversion in hybrid scallop.BACKGROUND: Concerted evolution has been believed to account for homogenization of genes within multigene families. However, the exact mechanisms involved in the homogenization have been under debate. Use of interspecific hybrid system allows detection of greater level of sequence variation, and therefore, provide advantage for tracing the sequence changes. In this work, we have used an interspecific hybrid system of scallop to study the sequence homogenization processes of rRNA genes. RESULTS: Through the use of a hybrid scallop system (Chlamys farreri female symbol x Argopecten irradians male symbol), here we provide solid molecular and cellular evidence for homogenization of the rDNA sequences into maternal genotypes. The ITS regions of the rDNA of the two scallop species exhibit distinct sequences and thereby restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) patterns, and such a difference was exploited to follow the parental ITS contributions in the F1 hybrid during early development using PCR-RFLP. The representation of the paternal ITS decreased gradually in the hybrid during the development of the hybrid, and almost diminished at the 14th day after fertilization while the representation of the maternal ITS gradually increased. Chromosomal-specific fluorescence in situ <e>hybridization</e> (FISH) analysis in the hybrid revealed the presence of maternal ITS sequences on the paternal ITS-bearing chromosomes, but not vice versa. Sequence analysis of the ITS region in the hybrid not only confirmed the maternally biased conversion, but also allowed the detection of six recombinant variants in the hybrid involving short recombination regions, suggesting that site-specific recombination may be involved in the maternally biased gene conversion. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these molecular and cellular evidences support rapid concerted gene evolution via maternally biased gene conversion. As such a process would lead to the expression of only one parental genotype, and have the opportunities to generate recombinant intermediates; this work may also have implications in novel hybrid zone alleles and genetic imprinting, as well as in concerted gene evolution. In the course of evolution, many species may have evolved involving some levels of hybridization, intra- or interspecific, the sex-biased sequence homogenization could have led to a greater role of one sex than the other in some species.",M1
20056653,"Interspecific gene flow in a multispecies oak hybrid zone in the Sierra Tarahumara of Mexico.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Interspecific gene flow can occur in many combinations among species within the genus Quercus, but simultaneous <e>hybridization</e> among more than two species has been rarely analysed. The present study addresses the genetic structure and morphological variation in a triple hybrid zone formed by Q. hypoleucoides, Q. scytophylla and Q. sideroxyla in north-western Mexico. METHODS: A total of 247 trees from ten reference and 13 presumed intermediate populations were characterized using leaf shape variation and geometric morphometrics, and seven nuclear microsatellites as genetic markers. Discriminant function analysis was performed for leaf shape variation, and estimates of genetic diversity and structure, and individual Bayesian genetic assignments were obtained. KEY RESULTS: Reference populations formed three completely distinct groups according to discriminant function analysis based on the morphological data, and showed low, but significant, genetic differentiation. Populations from the zone of contact contained individuals morphologically intermediate between pairs of species in different combinations, or even among the three species. The Bayesian admixture analysis found that three main genetic clusters best fitted the data, with good correspondence of reference populations of each species to one of the genetic clusters, but various degrees of admixture evidenced in populations from the contact area. CONCLUSIONS: The three oak species have formed a complex hybrid zone that is geographically structured as a mosaic, and comprising a wide range of genotypes, including hybrids between different species pairs, backcrosses and probable triple hybrids.",M1
20044166,"Understanding the onset of hybrid speciation.Natural <e>hybridization</e> between closely related taxa is a common phenomenon in both plants and animals. Hybridization has often been viewed as a destructive force that could erode established gene pools, but it is increasingly being recognized as a potentially creative force in evolution because it can lead to a mixture of novel genotypes, some of which have the potential for rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions. However, the evolutionary dynamics leading to the emergence of newly adapted gene pools after hybridization are largely unexplored. Here, we argue that the identification and analysis of the dynamic processes that occur after the first contact deserve specific attention, because this is the phase where hybrid speciation is most different from other forms of speciation.",M1
20033439,"Post-pollination mechanisms in Nicotiana longiflora and N. plumbaginifolia: pollen tube growth rate, offspring paternity and <e>hybridization</e>.In natural populations where interfertile species coexist, conspecific and heterospecific pollen can be delivered to the stigmas. Post-pollination mechanisms might determine the seed siring success of different pollen donors within species as well as the chances for hybridization between species. Nicotiana longiflora and N. plumbaginifolia occur in sympatry in Northwest Argentina, where they have overlapping flowering seasons and share floral visitors. We explored (1) pollen tube growth rates for outcross versus self pollen in single-donor pollinations; (2) siring success of self versus outcross pollen donors in competitive pollinations, and (3) possibilities for hybridization by performing two- (outcross conspecific vs. heterospecific) and three-pollen donor (self vs. outcross vs. heterospecific) crosses. In N. longiflora, both pollen tube growth rate and siring success favored outcross pollen over self pollen and strong rejection of heterospecific pollen. In N. plumbaginifolia, pollen tube growth rate was similar for self and outcross pollen, self pollen sired similar numbers of offspring than outcross pollen and heterospecific pollen sired roughly the same number of progeny than self pollen. Results suggest that in natural sympatric populations, interspecific crosses would likely lead to unidirectional hybridization with N. plumbaginifolia as the seed parent.",M1
20033391,"Development of a novel Sinapis arvensis disomic addition line in Brassica napus containing the restorer gene for Nsa CMS and improved resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and pod shattering.An allo-cytoplasmic male sterile line, which was developed through somatic <e>hybridization</e> between Brassica napus and Sinapis arvensis (thus designated as Nsa CMS line), possesses high potential for hybrid production of rapeseed. In order to select for restorer lines, fertile plants derived from the same somatic hybridization combination were self-pollinated and testcrossed with the parental Nsa CMS line for six generations. A novel disomic alien addition line, B. napus-S. arvensis, has been successfully developed. GISH analysis showed that it contains one pair of chromosomes from S. arvensis and 19 pairs from B. napus, and retains stable and regular mitotic and meiotic processes. The addition line displays very strong restoration ability to Nsa CMS line, high resistance to Sclerotinia sclerotiorum and a low incidence of pod shattering. Because the addition line shares these very important agricultural characters, it is a valuable restorer to Nsa CMS line, and is named NR1 here (Nsa restorer no. 1).",M1
20002578,"Repeated unidirectional introgression towards Populus balsamifera in contact zones of exotic and native poplars.As the evolutionary significance of <e>hybridization</e> is largely dictated by its extent beyond the first generation, we broadly surveyed patterns of introgression across a sympatric zone of two native poplars (Populus balsamifera, Populus deltoides) in Quebec, Canada within which European exotic Populus nigra and its hybrids have been extensively planted since the 1800s. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that appeared fixed within each species were characterized by DNA-sequencing pools of pure individuals. Thirty-five of these diagnostic SNPs were employed in a high-throughput assay that genotyped 635 trees of different age classes, sampled from 15 sites with various degrees of anthropogenic disturbance. The degree of admixture within sampled trees was then assessed through Bayesian clustering of genotypes. Hybrids were present in seven of the populations, with 2.4% of all sampled trees showing spontaneous admixture. Sites with hybrids were significantly more disturbed than pure stands, while hybrids comprised both immature juveniles and trees of reproductive age. All three possible F1s were detected. Advanced-generation hybrids were consistently biased towards P. balsamifera regardless of whether hybridization had occurred with P. deltoides or P. nigra. Gene exchange between P. deltoides and P. nigra was not detected beyond the F1 generation; however, detection of a trihybrid demonstrates that even this apparent reproductive isolation does not necessarily result in an evolutionary dead end. Collectively, results demonstrate the natural fertility of hybrid poplars and suggest that introduced genes could potentially affect the genetic integrity of native trees, similar to that arising from introgression between natives.",M1
20002320,"Evolutionary rate variation, genomic dominance and duplicate gene expression evolution during allotetraploid cotton speciation.Here, we describe the evolution of gene expression among a diversified cohort of five allopolyploid species in the cotton genus (Gossypium). Using this phylogenetic framework and comparisons with expression changes accompanying F(1) <e>hybridization</e>, we provide a temporal perspective on expression diversification following a shared genome duplication. Global patterns of gene expression were studied by the hybridization of petal RNAs to a custom microarray. This platform measures total expression for c. 42 000 duplicated genes, and genome-specific expression for c. 1400 homoeologs (genes duplicated by polyploidy). We report homoeolog expression bias favoring the allopolyploid D genome over the A genome in all species (among five polyploid species, D biases ranging from c. 54 to 60%), in addition to conservation of biases among genes. Furthermore, we find surprising levels of transgressive up- and down-regulation in the allopolyploids, a diminution of the level of bias in genomic expression dominance but not in its magnitude, and high levels of rate variation among allotetraploid species. We illustrate how phylogenetic and temporal components of expression evolution may be partitioned and revealed following allopolyploidy. Overall patterns of expression evolution are similar among the Gossypium allotetraploids, notwithstanding a high level of interspecific rate variation, but differ strikingly from the direction of genomic expression dominance patterns in the synthetic F(1) hybrid.",M1
19996431,"Short report: Natural hybrid between Anopheles kleini and Anopheles sinensis.While analyzing wild mosquitoes caught in Paju, South Korea, we identified one egg-laying hybrid female between Anopheles kleini and Anopheles sinensis. Additional evidence was obtained by identifying several F(1) progeny and conducting self-crossing between them. Sequencing of mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 sequence suggested that the maternal origin of the female should be An. sinensis . Additionally, observation of only two distinct genotypes of F(1) progeny (double band, hybrid type, and single-band An. sinensis type) more closely resembled a situation of natural back-crossing between a hybrid female and male An. sinensis. Results of self-crossing between F(1) progeny was impaired and yielded abnormally low larval hatchings (3.7%). Overall, the observation of 1 female from 658 caught-wild mosquitoes indicated possible natural <e>hybridization</e> among members of the Hyrcanus group from South Korea.",M1
19968862,"Patterns of contemporary <e>hybridization</e> inferred from paternity analysis in a four-oak-species forest.BACKGROUND: Few studies address the issue of hybridization in a more than two-species context. The species-rich Quercus complex is one of the systems which can offer such an opportunity. To investigate the contemporary pattern of hybridization we sampled and genotyped 320 offspring from a natural mixed forest comprising four species of the European white oak complex: Quercus robur, Q. petraea, Q. pubescens, and Q. frainetto. RESULTS: A total of 165 offspring were assigned unambiguously to one of the pollen donors within the study plot. The minimum amount of effective pollen originating from outside the plot varied markedly among the seed parents, ranging from 0.18 to 0.87. The majority of the successful matings (64.1%) occurred between conspecific individuals indicating the existence of reproductive barriers between oak species. However, the isolation was not complete since we found strong evidence for both first-generation (8.4%) and later-generation hybrids (27.5%). Only two out of eight seed parents, belonging to Q. petraea and Q. robur, showed a high propensity to hybridize with Q. pubescens and Q. petraea, respectively. Significant structure of the effective pollen pools (Phipt=0.069, P=0.01) was detected in our sample. However, no support was found for the isolation by distance hypothesis. The proportion of hybrids was much higher (79%) in the seed generation when compared to the adult tree generation. CONCLUSION: First-generation hybrids were observed only between three out of six possible species combinations. Hybrids between one pair of species preferred to mate with one of their parental species. The observation of first and later-generation hybrids in higher frequency in acorns than in adults might be explained by selection against hybrid genotypes, the history of this uneven-aged forest or past introgression between species.",M1
19968694,"Avoidance by grazers facilitates spread of an invasive hybrid plant.Biological invasions greatly increase the potential for <e>hybridization</e> among native and non-native species. Hybridization may influence the palatability of novel hybrids to consumers potentially influencing invasion success; however, the palatability of non-native hybrids relative to the parent species is poorly known. In contrast, studies of native-only hybrids find they are nearly always more palatable to consumers than the parent species. Here, I experimentally demonstrate that an invasive hybrid cordgrass (Spartina) is dramatically less palatable to grazing geese than the native parent species. Using field and aviary experiments, I show that grazing geese ignore the hybrid cordgrass and preferentially consume native Spartina. I also experimentally demonstrate that reduced herbivory of the invasive hybrid may contribute to faster spread in a California estuary. These results suggest that biological invasions may increase future opportunities for creating novel hybrids that may pose a greater risk to natural systems than the parent species.",M1

F(1) and F(2) generations were produced by crosses between parental insects from the two populations with little indication of hybrid sterility. Gpi, Mdh, and Idh loci were inherited in a simple Mendelian fashion in families of two sympatric populations. Sixteen populations of Nilaparvata spp. from eight locations were collected. The Mdh, Idh, Pgm, Gpi, 6Pgd, and Acp loci were polymorphic. The N. lugens of rice with high esterase activity were clustered into a group and characterized by the presence of alleles Gpi (110) and Gpi (120), whereas N. lugens from weeds with low esterase activity were clustered into another group and characterized by Gpi (100) and Gpi (90) . There was a lack of heterozygotes between the common alleles of the two populations. This means that the two groups of individuals belong to different gene pools.",M1
19961584,"Phenotypic novelty in experimental hybrids is predicted by the genetic distance between species of cichlid fish.BACKGROUND: Transgressive segregation describes the occurrence of novel phenotypes in hybrids with extreme trait values not observed in either parental species. A previously experimentally untested prediction is that the amount of transgression increases with the genetic distance between hybridizing species. This follows from QTL studies suggesting that transgression is most commonly due to complementary gene action or epistasis, which become more frequent at larger genetic distances. This is because the number of QTLs fixed for alleles with opposing signs in different species should increase with time since speciation provided that speciation is not driven by disruptive selection. We measured the amount of transgression occurring in hybrids of cichlid fish bred from species pairs with gradually increasing genetic distances and varying phenotypic similarity. Transgression in multi-trait shape phenotypes was quantified using landmark-based geometric morphometric methods. RESULTS: We found that genetic distance explained 52% and 78% of the variation in transgression frequency in F1 and F2 hybrids, respectively. Confirming theoretical predictions, transgression when measured in F2 hybrids, increased linearly with genetic distance between hybridizing species. Phenotypic similarity of species on the other hand was not related to the amount of transgression. CONCLUSION: The commonness and ease with which novel phenotypes are produced in cichlid hybrids between unrelated species has important implications for the interaction of <e>hybridization</e> with adaptation and speciation. Hybridization may generate new genotypes with adaptive potential that did not reside as standing genetic variation in either parental population, potentially enhancing a population's responsiveness to selection. Our results make it conceivable that hybridization contributed to the rapid rates of phenotypic evolution in the large and rapid adaptive radiations of haplochromine cichlids.",M1
19941029,"Molecular evidence for natural intergeneric <e>hybridization</e> between Liquidambar and Altingia.Since its establishment, a hybrid origin for Semiliquidambar has been proposed based on morphological intermediacy and sympatric distribution with Altingia and Liquidambar. This hypothesis, however, has lacked convincing molecular evidence. In this study, two nuclear genes, pin2 and cab4, and a chloroplast gene, matK, from Semiliquidambar cathayensis and its putative parental species Liquidambar and Altingia in Jianfengling, Hainan, and Heishiding and Nanling, Guangdong, China, were sequenced to test this hypothesis. Our results showed that L. formosana and L. acalycina were closely related and constituted an inseparable clade in the phylogenetic trees of both pin2 and cab4 genes. Phylogenetic analyses revealed two types of sequences for S. cathayensis, which were clustered with its putative parents, L. formosana-L. acalycina and A. obovata in Jianfengling, and with L. formosana-L. acalycina and A. chinensis in Heishiding and Nanling. The partial chloroplast matK gene sequences showed four nucleotide substitutions between L. formosana and A. obovata in Jianfengling; the sequences of the two individuals of S. cathayensis were identical with those of A. obovata. No diagnostic chloroplast markers including matK and three other chloroplast genes were found to distinguish L. formosana and A. chinensis in Heishiding and Nanling. Molecular data clearly demonstrated that S. cathayensis is of intergeneric hybrid origin between L. formosana-L. acalycina and A. obovata or A. chinensis and that A. obovata functions as the maternal parent in the hybridization event in Jianfengling, Hainan.",M1
19937057,"Allochronic isolation and incipient hybrid speciation in tiger swallowtail butterflies.<e>Hybridization</e> leading to reproductively isolated, novel genotypes is poorly understood as a means of speciation and few empirical examples have been studied. In 1999, a previously non-existent delayed flight of what appeared to be the Canadian tiger swallowtail butterfly, Papilio canadensis, was observed in the Battenkill River Valley, USA. Allozyme frequencies and morphology suggest that this delayed flight was the product of hybridization between Papilio canadensis and its sibling species Papilio glaucus. The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) restriction fragment length polymorphisms presented here indicate that only P. canadensis-like mtDNA occurs in this population, suggesting that introgression likely occurred from hybrid males mating with P. canadensis females. Preliminary studies of this population indicated that delayed post-diapause pupal emergence in this hybrid genotype was the root cause behind the observed delayed flight, which suggests a potential empirical example of a mechanism leading to reproductive isolation. Here we provide further evidence of the role of adult pupal emergence as a reproductive barrier likely leading to reproductive isolation. In particular, we present results from pupal emergence studies using four different spring and two different winter temperature treatments. The results indicate a clear separation of adult emergences between the hybrid population and both parental species. However, our results indicate that exceptionally hot springs are likely to lead to greater potential for overlap between the local parental species, P. canadensis, and this delayed population with hybrid origins. Conversely, our results also show that warmer winters are likely to increase the temporal separation of the hybrid population and the parental species. Finally, we report recently collected evidence that this hybrid population remains morphologically distinct.",M1

In the present study the previous cytogenetic and SSR marker analyses were expanded to include 25 other SSR markers assigned to wheat chromosomes 7A and 7D to confirm the presence of a 7A.7D translocation and to specify its composition. An almost complete chromosome 7A and a short chromosome segment derived from the terminal region of 7DL were detected, confirming the presence of a terminal translocation involving the distal regions of 7AL and 7DL. In both cases the position of the translocation breakpoint was different from that of known deletion lines. The identification of the 7AL.7DL translocation and its breakpoint position provides a new physical landmark for future physical mapping studies, opening up the possibility of more precise localization of genes or molecular markers within the terminal regions of 7DL and 7AL.",M1
19916869,"Breakdown in postmating isolation and the collapse of a species pair through <e>hybridization</e>.Species that evolved through ecological speciation and that lack intrinsic genetic incompatibilities may nonetheless be maintained by extrinsic postmating isolating barriers that impose selection against hybrids. These species, however, may be vulnerable to a breakdown in postmating isolation. Here, we investigate a model system for ecological speciation: sympatric limnetic-benthic pairs of threespine sticklebacks. Recently, stickleback hybrid abundance in Enos Lake has increased. Given that ecological selection against hybrids was historically an important component of total reproductive isolation, we tested whether ecologically dependent postmating isolation is still functioning. We compared body shape, diet, growth, and survival in present-day Enos fish with trait data in the undisturbed Paxton Lake species pair and with historical Enos Lake data. In both Paxton and historical Enos data, we found a strong correlation between body shape and diet; however, in present-day Enos fish, this correlation was absent. Using fitness estimates based on growth rates and survival, we found no evidence of selection against intermediate morphologies. It appears that postmating isolation has broken down, allowing hybrids to persist and contributing to the collapse of the species pair.",M1
19906065,"Spontaneous interspecific <e>hybridization</e> and patterns of pollen dispersal in ex situ populations of a tree species (Sinojackia xylocarpa) that is extinct in the wild.For endangered plants interspecific hybridization occurring in ex situ collections may lead to failure of reintroduction actions. We used Sinojackia xylocarpa, a well documented Chinese endemic species that is extinct in the wild, as a model case to address this concern. We used paternity analyses to assess the spontaneous hybridization and patterns of pollen flow between S. xylocarpa and its congener species, S. rehderiana, in conserved populations in Wuhan Botanic Garden. Interspecific hybridization events were detected in seven out of eight maternal trees of S. xylocarpa, and an average of 32.7% seeds collected from maternal trees of S. xylocarpa were hybrids. The paternity of 93 out of 249 seedlings from S. xylocarpa assigned to S. rehderiana provided convincing evidence that spontaneous interspecific hybridization occurred extensively in the living garden collection we studied. Different patterns of pollen dispersal (predominantly short-distance vs. long-distance pollination) were observed between intra- and interspecific hybridization events in the garden. Pollen dispersal within the ex situ populations was not restricted by distance, as evidenced by a lack of significant correlations between the average effective pollen dispersal distance (delta) and the geographic distances (d1 and d2) between maternal and paternal trees. The interspecific pollen-dispersal distance ranged from 10 to 620.1 m (mean 294.4 m). Such extensive hybridization in ex situ collections could jeopardize the genetic integrity of endangered species and irrevocably contaminate the gene pool if such hybrids are used for reintroduction and restoration. We recommend strongly that measures be taken to minimize the genetic risks of this kind of hybridization, including establishing buffer zones in ex situ collections, manipulating flowering phenology, testing seed lots before use in reintroduction programs, and controlling pollination for seed purity.",M1
19902245,"High frequency of HMW-GS sequence variation through somatic <e>hybridization</e> between Agropyron elongatum and common wheat.A symmetric somatic hybridization was performed to combine the protoplasts of tall wheatgrass (Agropyron elongatum) and bread wheat (Triticum aestivum). Fertile regenerants were obtained which were morphologically similar to tall wheatgrass, but which contained some introgression segments from wheat. An SDS-PAGE analysis showed that a number of non-parental high-molecular weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) were present in the symmetric somatic hybridization derivatives. These sequences were amplified, cloned and sequenced, to deliver 14 distinct HMW-GS coding sequences, eight of which were of the y-type (Hy1-Hy8) and six x-type (Hx1-Hx6). Five of the cloned HMW-GS sequences were successfully expressed in E. coli. The analysis of their deduced peptide sequences showed that they all possessed the typical HMW-GS primary structure. Sequence alignments indicated that Hx5 and Hy1 were probably derived from the tall wheatgrass genes Aex5 and Aey6, while Hy2, Hy3, Hx1 and Hy6 may have resulted from slippage in the replication of a related biparental gene. We found that both symmetric and asymmetric somatic hybridization could promote the emergence of novel alleles. We discussed the origination of allelic variation of HMW-GS genes in somatic hybridization, which might be the result from the response to genomic shock triggered by the merger and interaction of biparent genomes.",M1
19897524,"Intragenic recombination events and evidence for hybrid speciation in Nicotiana (Solanaceae).Reticulate evolution may function both at the species level, through homoploid and polyploid <e>hybridization</e>, and below the species level, through inter and intragenic recombination. These processes represent challenges for the reconstruction of evolutionary relationships between species, because they cannot be represented adequately with bifurcating trees. We use data from low-copy nuclear genes to evaluate long-standing hypotheses of homoploid (interspecific) hybrid speciation in Nicotiana (Solanaceae) and reconstruct a complex series of reticulation events that have been important in the evolutionary history of this genus. Hybrid origins for three diploid species (Nicotiana glauca, N. linearis, and N. spegazzinii) are inferred on the basis of gene tree incongruence, evidence for interallelic recombination between likely parental alleles, and support for incompatible splits in Lento plots. Phylogenetic analysis of recombinant gene sequences illustrates that recombinants may be resolved with one of their progenitor lineages with a high posterior probability under Bayesian inference, and thus there is no indication of the conflict between phylogenetic signals that results from reticulation. Our results illustrate the importance of hybridization in shaping evolution in Nicotiana and also show that intragenic recombination may be relatively common. This finding demonstrates that it is important to investigate the possibility of recombination when aiming to detect hybrids from DNA-sequence data and reconstruct patterns of reticulate evolution between species.",M1
19887474,"Asymmetric <e>hybridization</e> in Rhododendron agastum: a hybrid taxon comprising mainly F1s in Yunnan, China.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Rhododendron (Ericaceae) is a large woody genus in which hybridization is thought to play an important role in evolution and speciation, particularly in the Sino-Himalaya region where many interfertile species often occur sympatrically. Rhododendron agastum, a putative hybrid species, occurs in China, western Yunnan Province, in mixed populations with R. irroratum and R. delavayi. METHODS: Material of these taxa from two sites 400 km apart (ZhuJianYuan, ZJY and HuaDianBa, HDB) was examined using cpDNA and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences, and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci, to test the possibility that R. agastum was in fact a hybrid between two of the other species. Chloroplast trnL-F and trnS-trnG sequences together distinguished R. irroratum, R. delavayi and some material of R. decorum, which is also considered a putative parent of R. agastum. KEY RESULTS: All 14 R. agastum plants from the HDB site had the delavayi cpDNA haplotype, whereas at the ZJY site 17 R. agastum plants had this haplotype and four had the R. irroratum haplotype. R. irroratum and R. delavayi are distinguished by five unequivocal point mutations in their ITS sequences; every R. agastum accession had an additive pattern (double peaks) at each of these sites. Data from AFLP loci were acquired for between ten and 21 plants of each taxon from each site, and were analysed using a Bayesian approach implemented by the program NewHybrids. The program confirmed the identity of all accessions of R. delavayi, and all R. irroratum except one, which was probably a backcross. All R. agastum from HDB and 19 of 21 from ZJY were classified as F1 hybrids; the other two could not be assigned a class. CONCLUSIONS: Rhododendron agastum represents populations of hybrids between R. irroratum and R. delavayi, which comprise mostly or only F1s, at the two sites examined. The sites differ in that at HDB there was no detected variation in cpDNA type or hybrid class, whereas at ZJY there was variation in both.",M1

Williamson has made a series of predictions arising from his hypothesis and urged genomicists to test them. Here, we use data already in the literature to show these predictions to be false. Hybridogenesis between distantly related animals does not explain patterns of morphological and life-history evolution in general, and the genes and genomes of animals provide strong evidence against hybridization or larval transfer between a velvet worm and an insect in particular.",M1
19878583,"Genetic load and transgenic mitigating genes in transgenic Brassica rapa (field mustard) x Brassica napus (oilseed rape) hybrid populations.BACKGROUND: One theoretical explanation for the relatively poor performance of Brassica rapa (weed) x Brassica napus (crop) transgenic hybrids suggests that <e>hybridization</e> imparts a negative genetic load. Consequently, in hybrids genetic load could overshadow any benefits of fitness enhancing transgenes and become the limiting factor in transgenic hybrid persistence. Two types of genetic load were analyzed in this study: random/linkage-derived genetic load, and directly incorporated genetic load using a transgenic mitigation (TM) strategy. In order to measure the effects of random genetic load, hybrid productivity (seed yield and biomass) was correlated with crop- and weed-specific AFLP genomic markers. This portion of the study was designed to answer whether or not weed x transgenic crop hybrids possessing more crop genes were less competitive than hybrids containing fewer crop genes. The effects of directly incorporated genetic load (TM) were analyzed through transgene persistence data. TM strategies are proposed to decrease transgene persistence if gene flow and subsequent transgene introgression to a wild host were to occur. RESULTS: In the absence of interspecific competition, transgenic weed x crop hybrids benefited from having more crop-specific alleles. There was a positive correlation between performance and number of B. napus crop-specific AFLP markers [seed yield vs. marker number (r = 0.54, P = 0.0003) and vegetative dry biomass vs. marker number (r = 0.44, P = 0.005)]. However under interspecific competition with wheat or more weed-like conditions (i.e. representing a situation where hybrid plants emerge as volunteer weeds in subsequent cropping systems), there was a positive correlation between the number of B. rapa weed-specific AFLP markers and seed yield (r = 0.70, P = 0.0001), although no such correlation was detected for vegetative biomass. When genetic load was directly incorporated into the hybrid genome, by inserting a fitness-mitigating dwarfing gene that that is beneficial for crops but deleterious for weeds (a transgene mitigation measure), there was a dramatic decrease in the number of transgenic hybrid progeny persisting in the population. CONCLUSION: The effects of genetic load of crop and in some situations, weed alleles might be beneficial under certain environmental conditions. However, when genetic load was directly incorporated into transgenic events, e.g., using a TM construct, the number of transgenic hybrids and persistence in weedy genomic backgrounds was significantly decreased.",M1
19878500,"Alternative reproductive tactics and the propensity of <e>hybridization</e>.One explanation for hybridization between species is the fitness benefits it occasionally confers to the hybridizing individuals. This explanation is possible in species that have evolved alternative male reproductive tactics: individuals with inferior tactics might be more prone to hybridization provided it increases their reproductive success and fitness. Here we experimentally tested whether the propensity of hybridization in the wild depends on male reproductive tactic in Calopteryx splendens damselflies. Counter to our expectation, it was males adopting the superior reproductive tactic (territoriality) that had greatest propensity to hybridize than males adopting the inferior tactics (sneakers and floaters). Moreover, among the territorial males, the most ornamented males had greatest propensity to hybridize whereas the pattern was reversed in the sneaker males. Our results suggest that there is fluctuating selection on male mate discrimination against heterospecific females depending on both ornament size and the male's reproductive tactic.",M1

We identified haploid gametophytes of V. kalamocarpa (one of the two putative parents of V.xstenosiphon) in a hybrid sporophyte population in Japan that lacks fertile non-hybrid individuals. Furthermore, diploid sporophytes of the species were not found within a 50-km radius. This finding supports a hypothesis of hybridization involving the 'independent gametophyte' phenomenon and provides a new perspective on the geographical distribution of fern hybrids.",M1

Analysis showed a total of 356 polymorphic sites of which approximately 80% were parsimony informative. Phylogenetic reconstruction by neighbor joining and maximum parsimony methods placed the 57 Vigna accessions (belonging to 15 species) into 5 major clades. Five species viz. Vigna heterophylla, Vigna pubigera, Vigna parkeri, Vigna laurentii, and Vigna gracilis whose position in the subgenus was previously not known were placed in the section Vigna. A single accession (Vigna unguiculata ssp. tenuis, NI 1637) harbored 2 intragenomic ITS variants, indicative of 2 different types of ribosomal DNA (rDNA) repeat units. ITS variant type-I was close to ITS from V. unguiculata ssp. pubescens, whereas type-II was close to V. unguiculata ssp. tenuis. Transcript analysis clearly demonstrates that in accession NI 1637, rDNA repeat units with only type-II ITS variants are transcriptionally active. Evidence from sequence analysis (of 5.8S, ITS1, and ITS2) and secondary structure analysis (of ITS1 and ITS2) indicates that the type-I ITS variant probably does not belong to the pseudogenic rDNA repeat units. The results from phylogenetic and transcript analysis suggest that the rDNA units with the type-I ITS may have introgressed as a result of hybridization (between ssp. tenuis and ssp. pubescens); however, it has been epigenetically silenced. The results also demonstrate differential evolution of ITS sequence among wild and cultivated forms of V. unguiculata.",M1
19853055,"Rapid radiation, ancient incomplete lineage sorting and ancient <e>hybridization</e> in the endemic Lake Tanganyika cichlid tribe Tropheini.The evolutionary history of the endemic Lake Tanganyika cichlid tribe Tropheini, the sister group of the species flocks of Lake Malawi and the Lake Victoria region, was reconstructed from 2009 bp DNA sequence of two mitochondrial genes (ND2 and control region) and from 1293 AFLP markers. A period of rapid cladogenesis at the onset of the diversification of the Tropheini produced a multitude of specialized, predominantly rock-dwelling aufwuchs-feeders that now dominate in Lake Tanganyika's shallow habitat. Nested within the stenotopic rock-dwellers is a monophyletic group of species, which also utilize more sediment-rich habitat. Most of the extant species date back to at least 0.7 million years ago. Several instances of disagreement between AFLP and mtDNA tree topology are attributed to ancient incomplete lineage sorting, introgression and hybridization. A large degree of correspondence between AFLP clustering and trophic types indicated fewer cases of parallel evolution of trophic ecomorphology than previously inferred from mitochondrial data.",M1

(RCC) generated sterile triploid (3nRB) and fertile tetraploid (4nRB) hybrid offspring. Utilizing inverted terminal repeats (ITRs) of transposon Tdr1 from Danio rerio as PCR primer, the results showed that evident change in the number of Tc1-like transposons in 4nRB relative to BSB occurred, whereas such change did not arise in 3nRB compared to BSB. No Tc1-like transposon was found in RCC. A novel transposon was isolated from both BSB and 3nRB and designated as Tma1, which consisted of multiple copies after dot-blot <e>hybridization</e>. Based on the analysis of PCR amplified flanking sequence, characterization of Tma1 indicated that this element flanked by a duplicated TA dinucleotide and harbored an ITR of about 224 bp. Tma1 also harbored an incomplete transposase gene. Another novel transposon designated as Tte1 was detected in 4nRB, which harbored an ITR of roughly 130 bp and consisted of multiple copies, but had no transposase gene. The analysis of PCR amplification and Southern blot hybridization showed that DNAs of 4nRB, which were hybridized to DIG-labeled pTma1, did not give band by PCR with Tma1 primer, on the other hand, 7 of 15 DNA samples from BSB, which were hybridized to DIG-labeled pTte1, did not produce band by PCR with Tte1 primer. These results suggest that Tte1 may be a recent invasion in BSB population and burst in 4nRB offspring. Our data provide clues as to the possible role of transposons as a driving mechanism for genomic evolution.",M1
19825641,"Epigenetic programming: the challenge to species <e>hybridization</e>.In many organisms, the genomes of individual species are isolated by a range of reproductive barriers that act before or after fertilization. Successful mating between species results in the presence of different genomes within a cell (hybridization), which can lead to incompatibility in cellular events due to adverse genetic interactions. In addition to such genetic interactions, recent studies have shown that the epigenetic control of the genome, silencing of transposons, control of non-additive gene expression and genomic imprinting might also contribute to reproductive barriers in plant and animal species. These genetic and epigenetic mechanisms play a significant role in the prevention of gene flow between species. In this review, we focus on aspects of epigenetic control related to hybrid incompatibility during species hybridization, and also consider key mechanism(s) in the interaction between different genomes.",M1
19824932,"Intergenomic epistasis causes asynchronous hatch times in whitefish hybrids, but only when parental ecotypes differ.Support for the theory of ecological speciation requires evidence for ecological divergence between species which directly or indirectly causes reproductive isolation. This study investigates effects of ecological vs. genetic disparity of parental species on the presence of endogenous selection (deformation and mortality rates) and potential sources of exogenous selection (growth rates and hatch timing) on hybrids. Hybrid embryonic development is analysed in a common-garden full-sib cross of three species belonging to two different ecotypes within the Coregonus lavaretus species flock in the central Alpine region of Europe. Although hatch timing was similar across the three species, embryonic growth rates and egg sizes differed between ecotypes. This led to a mismatch between embryonic growth rate and egg size in hybrid crosses that reveals epistasis between the maternal and embryonic genomes and transgressive hatch times that were asynchronous with control crosses. A strong constraint of egg size to embryo size at late development was also evident. We argue that this demonstrates potential for coadaptation of a maternal trait (egg size) with offspring growth rate to be an important source of selection against <e>hybridization</e> between ecotypes with different egg sizes. Implications for the measurement and quantification of early life-history traits affected by this additive relationship, such as hatch day and larval size, are also discussed.",M1
19822002,"Cyto-nuclear discordance in the phylogeny of Ficus section Galoglychia and host shifts in plant-pollinator associations.BACKGROUND: <e>Hybridization</e> events are relatively common in vascular plants. However, the frequency of these events is unevenly distributed across the plant phylogeny. Plant families in which individual species are pollinated by specific pollinator species are predicted to be less prone to hybridization than other families. However, exceptions may occur within these families, when pollinators shift host-plant species. Indeed, host shifts are expected to increase the rate of hybridization events. Pollinators of Ficus section Galoglychia are suspected to have changed host repeatedly, based on several cases of incongruence between plant phylogeny and taxonomy, and insect phylogeny and taxonomy. We tracked cyto-nuclear discordance across section Galoglychia as evidence for hybridization. To achieve a proper global view, we first clarified the monophyly of section Galoglychia as it had been questioned by recent phylogenetic studies. Moreover, we investigated if fig size could be a factor facilitating host shifts. RESULTS: Phylogenetic chloroplast and nuclear results demonstrated the monophyly of section Galoglychia. Within section Galoglychia, we detected several cases of statistically significant cyto-nuclear discordance. Discordances concern both terminal nodes of the phylogenetic trees and one deep node defining relationships between subsections. Because nuclear phylogeny is congruent with morphological taxonomy, discordances were caused by the chloroplast phylogeny. Introgressive hybridization was the most likely explanation for these discordances. We also detected that subsections pollinated by several wasp genera had smaller figs and were pollinated by smaller wasps than subsections pollinated by a single wasp genus. CONCLUSION: As hypothesized, we discovered evidences of past hybridization in Ficus section Galoglychia. Further, introgression was only detected in subsections presenting incongruence between plant and pollinator phylogenies and taxonomy. This supports the hypothesis that host shift is the cause for plant-pollinator incongruence. Moreover, small fig size could facilitate host shifts. Eventually, this study demonstrates that non-coding chloroplast markers are valuable to resolve deep nodes in Ficus phylogeny.",M1

Evolution by cooperative interaction.What's in a word?  <e>Hybridization</e>  is easy to say (for professors) but carries surprisingly deep meaning from an evolutionary viewpoint. Cliff Jolly's research contributions have included important work and thought on the nature of baboon diversity and interactions. Hybridization among baboon subspecies reflects compatible genes for many different physical and behavioral traits, essentially all traits, each of them complex. Modern developmental genetics has shown that a few general principles characterize the phenogenetic logic by which genes assemble embryos and maintain the complex traits and abilities of organisms, including behavior. How cooperative viability is maintained while complex adaptive traits evolve and populations diverge is a question we can begin to answer more definitively than has been possible before. A careful look leads us to challenge the nature of the Darwinian explanations that have been the standard for more than a century.",M1
19814778,"When divergent life histories hybridize: insights into adaptive life-history traits in an annual weed.*Colonizing weed populations face novel selective environments, which may drive rapid shifts in life history. These shifts may be amplified when colonists are hybrids of species with divergent life histories. Selection on such phenotypically diverse hybrids may create highly fecund weeds. We measured the phenotypic variation, strength of natural selection and evolutionary response of hybrid and nonhybrid weeds. *We created F(1) hybrids of wild radish, an early flowering, small-stemmed weed, and its late-flowering, large-stemmed, crop relative (Raphanus spp.). Replicate wild and hybrid populations were established in an agricultural landscape in Michigan, USA. The consequences of three generations of natural selection were measured in a common garden experiment. *Hybrid populations experienced strong selection for larger, earlier flowering plants whereas selection was relatively weak on wild populations. Large plant size evolved two to three times faster in the hybrid populations than in wild populations, yet hybrid populations did not evolve earlier flowering. Strong selection on size and phenotypic correlations between age at reproduction and size may have limited the response of flowering phenology. *Our findings demonstrate <e>hybridization</e> between species with divergent life histories may catalyse the rapid evolution of certain adaptive, weedy traits while tradeoffs limit the evolution of others.",M1
19805056,"Small RNAs serve as a genetic buffer against genomic shock in Arabidopsis interspecific hybrids and allopolyploids.Small RNAs, including microRNAs (miRNAs), small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), and trans-acting siRNAs (tasiRNAs), control gene expression and epigenetic regulation. Although the roles of miRNAs and siRNAs have been extensively studied, their expression diversity and evolution in closely related species and interspecific hybrids are poorly understood. Here, we show comprehensive analyses of miRNA expression and siRNA distributions in two closely related species Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, a natural allotetraploid Arabidopsis suecica, and two resynthesized allotetraploid lines (F(1) and F(7)) derived from A. thaliana and A. arenosa. We found that repeat- and transposon-associated siRNAs were highly divergent between A. thaliana and A. arenosa. A. thaliana siRNA populations underwent rapid changes in F(1) but were stably maintained in F(7) and A. suecica. The correlation between siRNAs and nonadditive gene expression in allopolyploids is insignificant. In contrast, miRNA and tasiRNA sequences were conserved between species, but their expression patterns were highly variable between the allotetraploids and their progenitors. Many miRNAs tested were nonadditively expressed (deviating from the mid-parent value, MPV) in the allotetraploids and triggered unequal degradation of A. thaliana or A. arenosa targets. The data suggest that small RNAs produced during interspecific <e>hybridization</e> or polyploidization serve as a buffer against the genomic shock in interspecific hybrids and allopolyploids: Stable inheritance of repeat-associated siRNAs maintains chromatin and genome stability, whereas expression variation of miRNAs leads to changes in gene expression, growth vigor, and adaptation.",M1
19804402,"Morphological and molecular evidence reveals recent <e>hybridization</e> between gorilla taxa.Molecular studies have demonstrated a deep lineage split between the two gorilla species, as well as divisions within these taxa; estimates place this divergence in the mid-Pleistocene, with gene flow continuing until approximately 80,000 years ago. Here, we present analyses of skeletal data indicating the presence of substantial recent gene flow among gorillas at all taxonomic levels: between populations, subspecies, and species. Complementary analyses of DNA sequence variation suggest that low-level migration occurred primarily in a westerly-to-easterly direction. In western gorillas, the locations of hybrid phenotypes map closely to expectations based on population refugia and riverine barrier hypotheses, supporting the presence of significant vicariance-driven structuring and occasional admixture within this taxon. In eastern lowland gorillas, the high frequency of hybrid phenotypes is surprising, suggesting that this region represents a zone of introgression between eastern gorillas and migrants from the west, and underscoring the conservation priority of this critically endangered group. These results highlight the complex nature of evolutionary divergence in this genus, indicate that historical gene flow has played a major role in structuring gorilla diversity, and demonstrate that our understanding of the evolutionary processes responsible for shaping biodiversity can benefit immensely from consideration of morphological and molecular data in conjunction.",M1

The rocky-shore, plankton-feeding cichlid fish Cynotilapia afra is endemic to Lake Malawi, but naturally absent from many suitable sites. In the 1960s, this species was introduced to the southern areas of the lake, presumably as a result of the aquarium fish trade. It has now become established on a number of rocky areas within the Lake Malawi National Park. Here, we analysed DNA sequence variation in the mitochondrial control region of six native and four introduced populations of C. afra, and three populations of the closely-related and hybridizing Pseudotropheus zebra. In contrast to previous studies of Lake Malawi rock dwelling cichlids, network analyses suggested that native populations of C. afra showed high levels of lineage sorting in mtDNA. Introduced populations showed higher sequence and haplotype diversity than their native counterparts. Our analyses suggested that the elevated gene diversity was largely attributed to the fact that the introduced C. afra populations were derived from several genetically distinct and geographically separate populations, and to a lesser extent because of introgressive hybridization with native P. zebra. The establishment and spread of C. afra may be partly because of its ability to occupy a vacant ecological niche, but it may also have been facilitated by its enhanced genetic diversity.",M1

Molecular studies based on the internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS-2) have subdivided this species into four potential taxonomic groups. Using both ITS-2 and cytochrome B markers, we confirmed the sibling species status of ITS-2 Group 3 and detected an apparent sympatry of ITS-2 Groups 2 and 3 in the Yucatan peninsula, Mexico. Here we examine the geographic distribution of T. dimidiata ITS-2 genotypes in the region and compare their egg production and Trypanosoma cruzi infection rates, as indicators of biological differences between groups. PCR genotyping of large natural populations showed an extensive sympatry of Groups 2 and 3 in most of the peninsula, often within the same house. We also detected a large proportion of individuals displaying ITS-2 sequences from both Groups 2 and 3, suggesting <e>hybridization</e>. Analysis of ITS-2 genotype frequencies indicated a strong departure from Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium in female hybrids, but not in males, due to a large heterozygote deficit. These results suggest random mating between ITS-2 Groups 2 and 3 combined with reduced viability and/or survival in female hybrids. This and other factors may allow for the maintenance of distinct ITS-2 Groups 2 and 3 populations despite high hybrid frequencies. Importantly, T. cruzi infection was much higher in hybrids compared to ITS-2 Groups 2 and 3 individuals, but all three genotypes appeared to seasonally infest houses in a similar manner in the region. These findings warrant further studies on T. dimidiata taxonomy and its epidemiologic implications.",M1

Many hybrid plants have been generated from fusion combinations of different phylogenetic species, some of which have been utilized in crop breeding programs. Among them, asymmetric hybrid, which usually contains a fraction of alien genome, has received more attention because of its importance in crop improvement. However, few studies have dealt with the heredity of the genome of somatic hybrid for a long time, which has limited the progress of this approach. Over recent ten years, along with the development of an effective cytogenetical tool  in situ hybridization (ISH) , asymmetric fusion of common wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) with different grasses or cereals has been greatly developed. Genetics, genomes, functional genes and agricultural traits of wheat asymmetric hybrids have been subject to systematic investigations using gene cloning, genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and molecular makers.

Genomic alteration appeared preferentially in the maternal subgenome, and the environment of TEs was specifically affected by large maternal-specific methylation changes, demonstrating that TEs fuel epigenetic alterations at the merging of diverged genomes. *Such genome changes indicate that nuclear incompatibilities in Spartina trigger immediate alterations, which are TE-specific with an important epigenetic component.

19780975,"Complete mitochondrial DNA replacement in a Lake Tanganyika cichlid fish.We used nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) sequences from specimens collected throughout Lake Tanganyika to clarify the evolutionary relationship between Lamprologus callipterus and Neolamprologus fasciatus. The nuclear data support the reciprocal monophyly of these two shell-breeding lamprologine cichlids. However, mtDNA sequences show that (i) L. callipterus includes two divergent and geographically disjunct (North-South) mtDNA lineages; and that (ii) N. fasciatus individuals cluster in a lineage sister group to the northern lineage of L. callipterus. The two mtDNA lineages of L. callipterus diverged c. 684 kya to 1.2 Ma, coinciding with a major water level low stand in Lake Tanganyika, which divided the lake into isolated sub-lakes. This suggests that the two mtDNA lineages originated as the result of the separation of L. callipterus populations in different sub-basins. The incongruent phylogenetic position of N. fasciatus can best be explained by an ancient unidirectional introgression from L. callipterus into N. fasciatus. Remarkably, our data indicate that this event resulted in the complete mtDNA replacement in N. fasciatus. Our data suggest that <e>hybridization</e> occurred soon after the divergence of the two L. callipterus mtDNA lineages, probably still during the water level low stand, and that subsequently the invading mtDNA lineage spread throughout the lake.",M1

Interactions between hybrid plants and the herbivores of the parental taxa may be used to elucidate the various cues being used by the pests for host location or other processes. The chemical composition of plants, and their physical foliar attributes, including leaf thickness, trichome density, moisture content and specific leaf weight were compared between allopatric pure and commercial hybrid species of Corymbia, an important subtropical hardwood taxon. The leaf-eating beetle Paropsis atomaria, to which the pure taxa represented host (C. citriodora subsp. variegata) and non-host (C. torelliana) plants, was used to examine patterns of herbivory in relation to these traits. Hybrid physical foliar traits, chemical profiles, and field and laboratory beetle feeding preference, while showing some variability, were generally intermediate to those exhibited by parent taxa, thus suggesting an additive inheritance pattern. The hybrid susceptibility hypothesis was not supported by our field or laboratory studies, and there was no strong relationship between adult preference and larval performance. The most-preferred adult host was the sympatric taxon, although this species supported the lowest larval survival, while the hybrid produced significantly smaller pupae than the pure species. The results are discussed in relation to plant chemistry and physical characteristics. The findings suggest a chemical basis for host selection behavior and indicate that it may be possible to select for resistance to this insect pest in these commercially important hardwood trees.",M1
19776058,"Rapid adaptive evolution of northeastern coyotes via <e>hybridization</e> with wolves.The dramatic expansion of the geographical range of coyotes over the last 90 years is partly explained by changes to the landscape and local extinctions of wolves, but hybridization may also have facilitated their movement. We present mtDNA sequence data from 686 eastern coyotes and measurements of 196 skulls related to their two-front colonization pattern. We find evidence for hybridization with Great Lakes wolves only along the northern front, which is correlated with larger skull size, increased sexual dimorphism and a five times faster colonization rate than the southern front. Northeastern haplotype diversity is low, suggesting that this population was founded by very few females moving across the Saint Lawrence River. This northern front then spread south and west, eventually coming in contact with an expanding front of non-hybrid coyotes in western New York and Pennsylvania. We suggest that hybridization with wolves in Canada introduced adaptive variation that contributed to larger size, which in turn allowed eastern coyotes to better hunt deer, allowing a more rapid colonization of new areas than coyotes without introgressed wolf genes. Thus, hybridization is a conduit by which genetic variation from an extirpated species has been reintroduced into northeastern USA, enabling northeastern coyotes to occupy a portion of the niche left vacant by wolves.",M1

Moreover, a Bayesian clustering analysis as well as a hybrid index-based analysis showed evidence of mixed ancestry, with approximately two thirds of the S. diegensis nuclear genome derived from S. exigua. These results provide strong support for a homoploid hybrid origin of S. diegensis. Finally, contrary to the finding that homoploid hybrid species are typically multiply-derived, our results were most consistent with a single origin of this species.",M1

19744120,"Species hybrids in the laboratory but not in nature: a reanalysis of premating isolation between Drosophila arizonae and D. mojavensis.Understanding speciation relies critically on the identification of mechanisms responsible for maintaining species integrity (i.e., reproductive isolation) especially when closely related species are sympatric in nature. Studies of reproductive isolation in Drosophila often involve laboratory mating experiments that assume that patterns of mate choice in the laboratory are similar to those in the wild. Two sibling species, Drosophila arizonae and D. mojavensis, known to exhibit low levels of interspecific <e>hybridization</e> in the laboratory, but not in nature, were used in multiple-choice mating trials using various mating chamber designs as well as synthetic and natural media for developing larvae and courting adults. Sympatric populations were more sexually isolated than allopatric ones, consistent with past studies, and all experimental variables tested (chamber size, host plant presence and rearing substrates) had significant effects on levels of premating isolation between these species. Flies reared on cactus showed increased premating isolation versus those reared on synthetic laboratory food as did providing fermenting host plant tissue during mating trials. Also, surprisingly, smaller mating chambers led to an increase in premating isolation versus larger containers. The design of these types of mating trials is thus critical to understanding how mating behaviors in the laboratory are related to those in natural populations.",M1
19733249,"Origins of Allium ampeloprasum horticultural groups and a molecular phylogeny of the section Allium (Allium: Alliaceae).The subgenus Allium section Allium includes economically important species, such as garlic and leek, as well as other polyploid minor crops. Phylogenetic studies within this section, with a focus on horticultural groups within A. ampeloprasum, were performed on 31 accessions of 17 species using the nuclear ribosomal DNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region and the chloroplast trnL-F and trnD-T regions. The results confirmed the monophyly of section Allium. Four main clades were identified on all ITS analyses but the relationships among those and the remaining species studied within section Allium remained unresolved. Trees based on cpDNA recovered two major clades and a topology only partly congruent with that of the ITS tree. Intra-individual polymorphism of the ITS region proved useful in tracking putative parent species of polyploid taxa. The allopolyploid origin of great headed garlic (GHG), A. iranicum and A. polyanthum was confirmed. No signs of <e>hybridization</e> in leek or kurrat were detected but possible introgression events were identified in pearl onion and bulbous leek. Although GHG is often used as a garlic substitute, molecular analysis revealed only a distant relationship with garlic. We also clarified the previous incorrect classification of cultivated forms within A. ampeloprasum, by showing that leek, kurrat, pearl onion, and bulbous leek should be considered separately from GHG.",M1
19730700,"Bidirectional introgressive <e>hybridization</e> between a cattle and human schistosome species.Schistosomiasis is a disease of great medical and veterinary importance in tropical and subtropical regions, caused by parasitic flatworms of the genus Schistosoma (subclass Digenea). Following major water development schemes in the 1980s, schistosomiasis has become an important parasitic disease of children living in the Senegal River Basin (SRB). During molecular parasitological surveys, nuclear and mitochondrial markers revealed unexpected natural interactions between a bovine and human Schistosoma species: S. bovis and S. haematobium, respectively. Hybrid schistosomes recovered from the urine and faeces of children and the intermediate snail hosts of both parental species, Bulinus truncatus and B. globosus, presented a nuclear ITS rRNA sequence identical to S. haematobium, while the partial mitochondrial cox1 sequence was identified as S. bovis. Molecular data suggest that the hybrids are not 1st generation and are a result of parental and/or hybrid backcrosses, indicating a stable hybrid zone. Larval stages with the reverse genetic profile were also found and are suggested to be F1 progeny. The data provide indisputable evidence for the occurrence of bidirectional introgressive hybridization between a bovine and a human Schistosoma species. Hybrid species have been found infecting B. truncatus, a snail species that is now very abundant throughout the SRB. The recent increase in urinary schistosomiasis in the villages along the SRB could therefore be a direct effect of the increased transmission through B. truncatus. Hybridization between schistosomes under laboratory conditions has been shown to result in heterosis (higher fecundity, faster maturation time, wider intermediate host spectrum), having important implications on disease prevalence, pathology and treatment. If this new hybrid exhibits the same hybrid vigour, it could develop into an emerging pathogen, necessitating further control strategies in zones where both parental species overlap.",M1
19729094,"Chapter 6: The genomes of lager yeasts.Yeasts used in the production of lagers belong to the genus Saccharomyces pastorianus. Species within this genus arose from a natural <e>hybridization</e> event between two yeast species that appear to be closely related to Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces bayanus. The resultant hybrids contain complex allopolyploid genomes and retain genetic characteristics of both parental species. Recent genome analysis using both whole genome sequencing and competitive genomic hybridization techniques has revealed the underlying composition of lager yeasts genomes. There appear to be at least 36 unique chromosomes, many of which are lager specific, resulting from recombination events between the homeologous parental chromosomes. The recombination events are limited to a defined set of genetic loci, which are highly conserved within strains of lager yeasts. In addition to the hybrid chromosomes, several non-reciprocal chromosomal translocations and inversions are also observed. Remarkably, in response to exposure to environmental stresses such as high temperatures and high osmotic pressure, the genomes appear to be highly dynamic and undergo recombination events at defined loci and alterations in the telomeric regions. The ability of environmental stress to alter the structure and composition of the genomes of lager yeasts may point to mechanisms of adaptive evolution in these species.",M1
19727825,"Anthocyanin biosynthesis genes location and expression in wheat-rye hybrids.Studies into gene expression in a foreign background contribute toward understanding of how genes derived from different species or genera manages to co-exist in a common nucleus, on the one hand, and help to estimate possible effectiveness of wide <e>hybridization</e> for cultivated plant improvement, on the other hand. The aim of this study was to investigate conservation of wheat and rye expression networks, using the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (ABP) genes as a model system. We isolated and analyzed ABP genes encoding enzymes acting at different steps of the pathway: chalcone-flavanone isomerase (CHI), flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), and anthocyanidin-3-glucoside rhamnosyltransferase (3RT). The rye ABP genes locations we determined (Chi on chromosome 5RL, F3h on 2RL, Ans on 6RL, 3Rt on 5RL, the regulatory Rc--red coleoptile--gene on 4RL) were in agreement with the rearrangements established between rye and wheat chromosomes. Expression of the ABP structural genes was studied in wheat-rye chromosome addition and substitution lines. F3h activation by the Rc gene was found to be critical for the red coleoptile trait formation. It was shown that the rye regulatory Rc gene can activate the wheat target gene F3h and vice versa wheat Rc induces expression of rye F3h. However, lower level of expression of rye F3h in comparison with that of the two wheat orthologues in the wheat-rye chromosome substitution line 2R(2D) was observed. Thus, although work of the wheat and rye ABP gene systems following the formation of wheat-rye hybrids is finely coordinated, some divergence exists between rye and wheat ABP genes, affecting level of gene expression.",M1
19717430,"Caterpillars evolved from onychophorans by hybridogenesis.I reject the Darwinian assumption that larvae and their adults evolved from a single common ancestor. Rather I posit that, in animals that metamorphose, the basic types of larvae originated as adults of different lineages, i.e., larvae were transferred when, through <e>hybridization</e>, their genomes were acquired by distantly related animals.  Caterpillars,  the name for eruciforms with thoracic and abdominal legs, are larvae of lepidopterans, hymenopterans, and mecopterans (scorpionflies). Grubs and maggots, including the larvae of beetles, bees, and flies, evolved from caterpillars by loss of legs. Caterpillar larval organs are dismantled and reconstructed in the pupal phase. Such indirect developmental patterns (metamorphoses) did not originate solely by accumulation of random mutations followed by natural selection; rather they are fully consistent with my concept of evolution by hybridogenesis. Members of the phylum Onychophora (velvet worms) are proposed as the evolutionary source of caterpillars and their grub or maggot descendants. I present a molecular biological research proposal to test my thesis. By my hypothesis 2 recognizable sets of genes are detectable in the genomes of all insects with caterpillar grub- or maggot-like larvae: (i) onychophoran genes that code for proteins determining larval morphology/physiology and (ii) sequentially expressed insect genes that code for adult proteins. The genomes of insects and other animals that, by contrast, entirely lack larvae comprise recognizable sets of genes from single animal common ancestors.",M1
19711051,"Transpositional activation of mPing in an asymmetric nuclear somatic cell hybrid of rice and Zizania latifolia was accompanied by massive element loss.We have reported previously that the most active miniature inverted terminal repeat transposable element (MITE) of rice, mPing, was transpositionally mobilized in several rice recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from an introgressive <e>hybridization</e> between rice and wild rice (Zizania latifolia Griseb.). To further study the phenomenon of hybridization-induced mPing activity, we undertook the present study to investigate the element's behavior in a highly asymmetric somatic nuclear hybrid (SH6) of rice and Z. latifolia, which is similar in genomic composition to that of the RILs, though probably contains more introgressed alien chromatins from the donor species than the RILs. We found that mPing, together with its transposase-donor, Pong, underwent rampant transpositional activation in the somatic hybrid (SH6). Because possible effects of protoplast isolation and cell culture can be ruled out, we attribute the transpositional activation of mPing and Pong in SH6 to the process of asymmetric somatic hybridization, namely, one-step introgression of multiple chromatin segments of the donor species Z. latifolia into the recipient rice genome. A salient feature of mPing transposition in the somatic hybrid is that the element's activation was accompanied by massive loss of its original copies, i.e., abortive transpositions, which was not observed in previously reported cases of mPing activity. These data not only corroborated our earlier finding that wide hybridization and introgression may trigger transpositional activation of otherwise quiescent transposable elements, but also suggest that transpositional mobilization of a MITE like mPing can be accompanied by dramatic reduction of its original copy numbers under certain conditions, thus provide novel insights into the dynamics of MITEs in the course of genome evolution.",M1
19690967,"A potential species-specific molecular marker suggests interspecific <e>hybridization</e> between sibling species Littorina arcana and L. saxatilis (Mollusca, Caenogastropoda) in natural populations.Three sister species of rough periwinkles, viz. Littorina saxatilis (Olivi 1792), L. arcana (Hannaford Ellis 1978) and L. compressa (Jeffreys 1865) from the Barents Sea (Russia), the White Sea (Russia) and the Norwegian Sea (Norway) were studied. The identification of two sibling species L. saxatilis and L. arcana is often difficult as both species have extremely similar shell morphology and reproductive systems. Only mature females can be unambiguously distinguished, with a jelly gland present in female L. arcana, but which is replaced by a brood pouch containing developing embryos in L. saxatilis. No clear-cut diagnostic features have been found to discriminate between males or juveniles of the two species. The very first diagnostic DNA marker (DNA fragment A2.8, 271 bp length) for L. arcana and L. saxatilis separation was developed. The marker was derived from apparently species-specific L. arcana DNA fragments obtained via Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. This fragment was cloned and sequenced, whereupon specific primers were designed and the amplification was surveyed in a large number of morphologically well-identified females of both species. Subsequently, the specific DNA marker was used for the identification of male L. arcana and partners in copulating pairs. In this way, we obtained evidence of possible interspecific hybridization between the sibling species L. arcana and L. saxatilis living in sympatry in natural populations: the presence of A2.8 fragment in 12% of morphologically well identified L. saxatilis females and its absence in 14% of morphologically well identified L. arcana females. The A2.8 fragment never amplified in L. saxatilis from sites without L. arcana. The A2.8 fragment did not amplify in L. compressa, not even in microsympatric populations, and we did not observe interspecific copulations between L. arcana and L. compressa.",M1
19690829,"Intraspecific hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed no gross alterations in endopolyploidy, DNA methylation, histone modifications and transcript levels.Arabidopsis accessions Col-0 and C24 and their reciprocal hybrids were employed as a model system to investigate the potential relationship between changes in DNA methylation, chromatin structure, endopolyploidization and gene expression in heterotic genotypes. Nucleolus size, endopolyploidization level and distribution of DNA and histone H3 methylation at the microscopic level does not differ between parents and their hybrids. Methylation sensitive amplified polymorphism revealed a largely constant pattern of DNA methylation (97% of signals analyzed) after intraspecific crosses. The parental expression profile of selected genes was maintained in hybrid offspring. No correlation was found between expression pattern and DNA methylation levels at restriction sites within 5' regulatory regions.

19682305,"Pollen competition as an asymmetric reproductive barrier between two closely related Silene species.Reproductive barriers are important determinants of gene flow between divergent populations or species. We studied pollen competition as a post-mating reproductive barrier between Silene dioica and S. latifolia. Gene flow between these species is extensive, but early-generation hybrids are rare. In an experiment with conspecific, heterospecific and 50 : 50 mixed pollinations in the two species, pollination treatments did not significantly affect seed set and seed weight. However, molecular determination of siring success after mixed pollinations showed that fewer than expected hybrids were produced in S. latifolia (18% hybrids) but not in S. dioica (51% hybrids). This constitutes an asymmetric post-mating reproductive barrier and likely contributes to the rarity of early-generation hybrids. Our study shows that pollen competition can be an effective barrier to <e>hybridization</e> between closely related species that likely acts in concert with other reproductive barriers.",M1
19674331,"Novel Phr1 mutations and the evolution of phenol reaction variation in US weedy rice (Oryza sativa).*Red rice, a major agricultural weed, is phenotypically diverse and possesses traits that are similar to both wild and cultivated rice. The genetic resources available for rice make it possible to examine the molecular basis and evolution of traits characterizing this weed. Here, we assess the phenol reaction - a classical trait for distinguishing among cultivated rice varieties - in red rice at the phenotypic and molecular levels. *We phenotyped more than 100 US weed samples for the phenol reaction and sequenced the underlying Phr1 locus in a subset of samples. Data were analyzed in combination with previously published Phr1 data for cultivated rice. *Most weed accessions (96.3%) are positive for the phenol reaction, and samples with a negative response carry loss-of-function alleles that are rare or heretofore undocumented. One such allele may have evolved through mutational convergence of a 1-bp frameshift insertion. Haplotype sharing between red rice and US cultivars suggests occasional crop-weed <e>hybridization</e>. *Our discovery of previously undocumented nonfunctional phr1 alleles suggests that there are likely to be other loss-of-function mutations segregating in Oryza sativa around the world.

19671130,"Haplotype inference in crossbred populations without pedigree information.BACKGROUND: Current methods for haplotype inference without pedigree information assume random mating populations. In animal and plant breeding, however, mating is often not random. A particular form of nonrandom mating occurs when parental individuals of opposite sex originate from distinct populations. In animal breeding this is called crossbreeding and <e>hybridization</e> in plant breeding. In these situations, association between marker and putative gene alleles might differ between the founding populations and origin of alleles should be accounted for in studies which estimate breeding values with marker data. The sequence of alleles from one parent constitutes one haplotype of an individual. Haplotypes thus reveal allele origin in data of crossbred individuals. RESULTS: We introduce a new method for haplotype inference without pedigree that allows nonrandom mating and that can use genotype data of the parental populations and of a crossbred population. The aim of the method is to estimate line origin of alleles. The method has a Bayesian set up with a Dirichlet Process as prior for the haplotypes in the two parental populations. The basic idea is that only a subset of the complete set of possible haplotypes is present in the population. CONCLUSION: Line origin of approximately 95% of the alleles at heterozygous sites was assessed correctly in both simulated and real data. Comparing accuracy of haplotype frequencies inferred with the new algorithm to the accuracy of haplotype frequencies inferred with PHASE, an existing algorithm for haplotype inference, showed that the DP algorithm outperformed PHASE in situations of crossbreeding and that PHASE performed better in situations of random mating.",M1

We examined two closely related Cyclamen species. One is a narrow endemic, and the other is more geographically widespread (both protected by law in continental southern France). We used floral traits and genetic variability to test for hybridization among the species in peripheral populations of the rare species. The species co-occurred on Corsica in a disjunct, peripheral part of the distribution of the endemic species and in an ecologically marginal area for the widespread species. The two species have hybridized and the endemic species showed high levels of introgression with its widespread congener. Genetic and floral variability in sites with both species was markedly higher than in sites with a single species. Our results highlight the need for a conservation strategy that integrates hybrid populations because they represent a source of novel diversity that may have adaptive potential.",M1

The species is infamous for evolving resistance to multiple herbicides, and predicting whether these resistances may be transferred to widespread weeds of the Amaranthus hybridus aggregate is a matter of epidemiological concern. Here, we explore the patterns of genetic exchange between Amaranthus tuberculatus and A. hybridus in an effort to understand whether allele introgression occurs throughout the genome and if fecundity penalties are associated with genetic exchange. *We evaluated 192 homoploid BC(1)s at 197 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) loci, as well as two loci associated with herbicide resistance: ALS and PPO. We also assessed the fecundity of each genotype by evaluation of seed production or pollen development. *It was discovered that genetic exchange between the species is unidirectional. Whereas A. hybridus alleles transfer with little or no penalty to A. tuberculatus, the reciprocal exchange is significantly distorted and potentially of limited evolutionary consequence. *Our previous hypothesis suggesting unidirectional introgression at ALS owing to circumstantial linkage is now modified to account for the more generalized distortion of genetic exchange observed in this study.",M1

The fitness of crop-wild hybrids is often dependent on environmental factors, but less is understood about how aspects of the environment affect individual cultivar alleles. *This study investigated the effects of naturally occurring herbivory on patterns of phenotypic selection and the genetic architecture of plant-herbivore interactions in an experimental sunflower crop-wild hybrid population in two locales. *Phenotypic selection analyses suggested that cultivar alleles conferring increased size were generally favored, but at one site cultivar-like flowering time was favored only if three types of herbivory were included in the selection model. Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping identified three regions in which the cultivar allele conferred a selective advantage for a number of co-localized traits. Quantitative trait loci for several measures of insect herbivory were detected and, although the cultivar allele increased herbivory damage at the majority of these QTLs, they rarely colocalized with advantageous cultivar alleles for morphological traits. *These results suggest that a subset of cultivar traits/alleles are advantageous in natural environments but that herbivory may mitigate the selective advantage of some cultivar alleles.",M1

Given the remarkable optical properties that they possess, they have been proposed as an ideal material for use in fluorescent in-situ <e>hybridization</e> (FISH). That is, they are resistant to photobleaching and they excite at a wide range of wavelengths but emit light in a very narrow band that can be controlled by particle size and thus have the potential for multiplexing experiments. The principal aim of this study was to compare the potential of QDs against traditional organic fluorochromes in both indirect (i.e. QD-conjugated streptavidin) and direct (i.e. synthesis of QD-labelled FISH probes) detection methods. In general, the indirect experiments met with a degree of success, with FISH applications demonstrated for chromosome painting, BAC mapping and use of oligonucleotide probes on human and avian chromosomes/nuclei. Many of the reported properties of QDs (e.g. brightness, 'blinking' and resistance to photobleaching) were observed. On the other hand, signals were more frequently observed where the chromatin was less condensed (e.g. around the periphery of the chromosome or in the interphase nucleus) and significant bleed-through to other filters was apparent (despite the reported narrow emission spectra). Most importantly, experimental success was intermittent (sometimes even in identical, parallel experiments) making attempts to improve reliability difficult. Experimentation with direct labelling showed evidence of the generation of QD-DNA constructs but no successful FISH experiments. We conclude that QDs are not, in their current form, suitable materials for FISH because of the lack of reproducibility of the experiments; we speculate why this might be the case and look forward to the possibility of nanotechnology forming the basis of future molecular cytogenetic applications.",M1

A study of their reproductive isolation is necessary to understand the process of speciation and maintenance of the two sister species as two discrete taxonomic and biological entities. Cross-mating tests were conducted (homo and hetero-specific) and monitored under two criteria: biological (presence of copulation and offspring) and genetic (using two isozymic markers diagnostic for the L. longipalpis complex; enzyme diagnosis AK and HK). Results indicate reproductive isolation, with an asymmetrical genetic exchange in a direction of <e>hybridization</e> between the two species under experimental conditions, and production of a low number of heterozygotes.

Three Casuarina tree species, Casuarina glauca, Casuarina cunninghamiana and Casuarina equisetifolia, native to Australia, are naturalized in Florida, USA. Many Florida Casuarina trees are considered unidentifiable, presumably due to interspecific hybridization. We collected tissue from over 500 trees from Australia and Florida and genotyped these using amplified fragment length polymorphisms. Our goal was to determine the exact identity of the Florida species, including any putative hybrid combinations. In Australia, we found high assignment values to the three parental species, and no evidence of hybridization. In Florida, we found many trees with strong assignment to any one of the three species, as well as 49 trees with assignment values intermediate to C. glauca and C. equisetifolia, suggesting hybridization between these species. One population of 10 trees had assignment values intermediate to C. cunninghamiana and C. glauca, suggesting additional hybridization. For 69 of these putative hybrid and parental types, we sequenced a low-copy intron of nuclear G3pdh, and these sequences indicated that some Florida trees contain heterozygotic combinations of C. glauca and C. equisetifolia haplotypes.

19627487,"Fine-scale geographical structure of genetic diversity in inland wild beet populations.Introgression arising from crop-to-wild gene flow provides novel sources of genetic variation in plant species complexes. <e>Hybridization</e> within the Beta vulgaris species complex is of immediate concern; crop lineages (B. vulgaris ssp. vulgaris) hybridize easily with their wild relatives (B. vulgaris ssp. maritima) thereby threatening wild beet gene diversity with genetic swamping. Hybridization 'hotspots' occur in European seed production areas because inland ruderal wild beets occur and reproduce in sympatry with cultivated beets. We studied gene flow occurring between seed-producing cultivars and ruderal wild B. vulgaris in southwestern France to determine whether feral beets, arising from unharvested cultivated seed, represent an opportunity for crop-to-wild gene flow. We surveyed 42 inland ruderal beet populations located near seed production fields for nucleo-cytoplasmic variation and used a cytoplasmic marker diagnostic of cultivated lines. Occurrence of cultivated-type cytoplasm within ruderal populations clearly reflected events of crop seed escape. However, we found no genetic signatures of nuclear cultivated gene introgression, which suggests past introgression of cultivated cytoplasm into a wild nuclear background through seed escape rather than recent direct pollen flow. Overall, patterns of genetic structure suggested that inland ruderal wild beet populations act as a metapopulation, with founding events involving a few sib groups, followed by low rates of seed or pollen gene flow after populations are established. Altogether, our results indicate that a long-lived seed bank plays a key role in maintaining cultivated-type cytoplasm in the wild and highlight the need for careful management of seed production areas where wild and cultivated relatives co-occur.",M1
19627486,"Does <e>hybridization</e> between divergent progenitors drive whole-genome duplication?Hybridization and whole-genome duplication are both potential mechanisms of rapid speciation which sometimes act in concert. Recent surveys, showing that homoploid hybrid species tend to be derived from parents that are less evolutionarily divergent than parents of polyploid hybrid species (allopolyploids), have been interpreted as supporting a hypothesis that high divergence between hybridizing species drives whole-genome duplication. Here, we argue that such conclusions stem from problems in sampling (especially the omission of autopolyploids) and null model selection, and underestimate the importance of selection. The data simply demonstrate that hybridization between divergent parents has a higher probability of successfully producing a species if followed by polyploidization.",M1

Species-specific biotin-labelled primer pairs were used in a single mPCR to amplify target regions in each of seven pathogens. The amplified biotin-labelled PCR products were hybridized with membrane-bound-specific oligonucleotide probes and were detected by chemiluminescence. Two hundred and eleven specimens (104 male urethral and 107 female vaginal swabs), collected from patients with suspected genital infections attending the Wuhan First Hospital Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STD) clinic, were tested by mPCR/RLB and results were confirmed by single PCR using different species-specific targets. The sensitivity of the assay was assessed using dilutions of positive DNA controls with known copy numbers, for each target. The assay correctly identified all reference strains and detected potential pathogens in a high proportion of clinical specimens. There was no cross-reaction between the seven pathogens. The mPCR/RLB can detect &lt;or= 10(2) copies of the target gene fragments. Comparison of mPCR/RLB and single PCR assays showed discrepant results in six of 211 (2.8%) clinical specimens, which were positive by mPCR/RLB assay, but negative by the corresponding single PCR. Nested PCR on the six discrepant specimens gave results consistent with those of mPCR/RLB.

This assay has demonstrated good performance and a rapid time to results, making this a promising tool to accelerate MDR-TB diagnosis and improve MDR-TB control. Validation of rapid tests for MDR-TB detection in different settings is needed to ensure acceptable performance, particularly in Asia, which has the largest number of MDR-TB cases in the world but only one previous report, in Vietnam, about the performance of the GenoType MDRplus assay. Thailand is ranked 18th of 22  high-burden  TB countries in the world, and there is evidence to suggest that rates of MDR-TB are increasing in Thailand.

METHODS: 50 stored isolates and 164 stored AFB-positive sputum specimens were tested using both the MGIT AST and the GenoType MTBDRplus assay. RESULTS: The GenoType MTBDRplus assay had a sensitivity of 95.3%, 100%, and 94.4% for INH resistance, RIF resistance, and MDR-TB, respectively. The difference in sensitivity between sputum specimens (93%) and isolates (100%) for INH resistance was not statistically significant (p = 0.08). Specificity was 100% for all resistance patterns and for both specimens and isolates. The laboratory processing time was a median of 25 days for MGIT AST and 5 days for the GenoType MTBDRplus (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: The GenoType MTBDRplus assay has been validated as a rapid and reliable first-line diagnostic test on AFB-positive sputum or MTB isolates for INH resistance, RIF resistance, and MDR-TB in Bangkok, Thailand. Further studies are needed to evaluate its impact on treatment outcome and the feasibility and cost associated with widespread implementation.",M2

However, targeted resequencing of large parts of nuclear genomes has yet to be demonstrated for ancient DNA. Here we show that <e>hybridization</e> capture on microarrays can successfully recover more than a megabase of target regions from Neandertal DNA even in the presence of approximately 99.8% microbial DNA. Using this approach, we have sequenced approximately 14,000 protein-coding positions inferred to have changed on the human lineage since the last common ancestor shared with chimpanzees. By generating the sequence of one Neandertal and 50 present-day humans at these positions, we have identified 88 amino acid substitutions that have become fixed in humans since our divergence from the Neandertals.",M2
20437146,"Psychroflexus lacisalsi sp. nov., a moderate halophilic bacterium isolated from a hypersaline lake (Hunazoko-Ike) in Antarctica.A novel gram-negative, aerobic, moderate halophilic, and psychrotolerant bacterium, designated as strain H7(T), was isolated from a hypersaline lake located in Skarvsnes, Antarctica. Cells were filaments with varying lengths. Coccoid bodies developed in old cultures. Growth occurred with 0.5-15% (w/v) NaCl (optimum, 5.8-7.0%), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 7.0-8.0), and at 10-28 degrees C (optimum, 25 degrees C). The strain had a G+C content of 34.9 mol%, which is within the range of 32-36 mol% reported for the genus Psychroflexus. Chemotaxonomic data (major respiratory quinone: MK-6; major fatty acids: aC(15:0), iC(16:0) 3-OH, and aC(15: 1) A) supported the classification of strain H7(T) within the genus Psychroflexus. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequences indicated that strain H7(T) should be assigned to the genus Psychroflexus and has a homology with Psychroflexus salinarum (98.2%), P. sediminis (96.1%), P. torquis (95.2%), P. tropicus (95.8%), and P. gondwanense (92.2%). Strain H7 is not identified as P. salinarum because that DNA-DNA <e>hybridization</e> data were 8.5% between strain H7(T) and P. salinarum. The combination of phylogenetic analysis, DNA-DNA hybridization data, phenotypic characteristics, and chemotaxonomic differences supported the view that strain H7(T) represents a novel species of the genus Psychroflexus. The name Psychroflexus lacisalsi is proposed, and the type strain is H7(T) (=JCM 16231(T) =KACC 14089(T)).",M2
20424423,"Characterization, evolution and chromosomal distribution of two satellite DNA sequence families in Lathyrus species.DNA clones containing highly repetitive DNA sequences were selected from partial libraries of Lathyrus sativus and L. sylvestris. Two satellite DNA sequence families were isolated from the genome of the former species. A first family was made up of repeats that varied in length from 54-56 bp, and shared 51.7-94.8% nucleotide sequence similarity. The repeats of the second sequence family were 52-62 bp in length, and shared a 58.5-78.5% nucleotide sequence similarity. All the repeat units contained in a clone from L. sylvestris were 41 bp in length and showed an almost perfect structural conservation (95.1-100% nucleotide sequence similarity). The evolution of the first sequence family from L. sativus and of that isolated from L. sylvestris was studied by dot-blot <e>hybridization</e> to the genomic DNA of these species and 3 other Lathyrus species, L. clymenum, L. latifolius and L. odoratus. The former repeats were found to be species-specific and their redundancy was calculated to be 2.9 x 10(7). The satellite DNA sequence isolated from L. sylvestris was present also in L.latifolius, with a redundancy of 1.4 x 10(7) and 1.1 x 10(7), respectively. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to investigate the chromosomal distribution of the two sequence families and of 45S and 5S ribosomal genes. The species-specific sequences of L. sativus were located around the centromere of chromosome pair IV, where they occupied a very broad region, and, in a much smaller amount, close to the centromere in the short arm of pair II. Sequences related to the repeat units isolated from L. sylvestris were found, both in this species and L. latifolius, in all of the chromosome pairs at terminal and interstitial regions, where they co-localize with the vast majority of DAPI bands. The pattern of distribution of the satellite DNA sequences investigated, together with that of DAPI bands and ribosomal DNA, allowed each chromosome pair of the 3 complements studied to be identified unambiguously.",M2

This panel allows to estimate the genetic structure of individual TBEV strains, as the targets for probes are both variable and genotype (subtype)-specific sequences of all TBEV genes. With the help of this panel using the method of molecular hybridization of nucleic acids 268 archived TBEV isolates were investigated and the distribution of its genotypes and subgenotypes of genotype 3 was made more precise in the territory of Eurasia. The conclusion made earlier has confirmed that five genotypes of TBEV co-circulate in Eastern Siberia. It is generally recognized that the Far Eastern (TBE-FE), European (TBE-Eu), and Siberian (TBE-Sib) genotypes are widespread and epidemiologically important. The fourth genotype is presented by only one isolate, TBE178-79, originated from Irkutsk region, Russia.

20398885,"Value for money? Array genomic <e>hybridization</e> for diagnostic testing for genetic causes of intellectual disability.Array genomic hybridization (AGH) provides a higher detection rate than does conventional cytogenetic testing when searching for chromosomal imbalance causing intellectual disability (ID). AGH is more costly than conventional cytogenetic testing, and it remains unclear whether AGH provides good value for money. Decision analytic modeling was used to evaluate the trade-off between costs, clinical effectiveness, and benefit of an AGH testing strategy compared to a conventional testing strategy. The trade-off between cost and effectiveness was expressed via the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed via Monte Carlo simulation. The baseline AGH testing strategy led to an average cost increase of $217 (95% CI $172-$261) per patient and an additional 8.2 diagnoses in every 100 tested (0.082; 95% CI 0.044-0.119). The mean incremental cost per additional diagnosis was $2646 (95% CI $1619-$5296). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis demonstrated that there was a 95% probability that AGH would be cost effective if decision makers were willing to pay $4550 for an additional diagnosis. Our model suggests that using AGH instead of conventional karyotyping for most ID patients provides good value for money. Deterministic sensitivity analysis found that employing AGH after first-line cytogenetic testing had proven uninformative did not provide good value for money when compared to using AGH as first-line testing.",M2
20398883,"Rare deletions at 16p13.11 predispose to a diverse spectrum of sporadic epilepsy syndromes.Deletions at 16p13.11 are associated with schizophrenia, mental retardation, and most recently idiopathic generalized epilepsy. To evaluate the role of 16p13.11 deletions, as well as other structural variation, in epilepsy disorders, we used genome-wide screens to identify copy number variation in 3812 patients with a diverse spectrum of epilepsy syndromes and in 1299 neurologically-normal controls. Large deletions (&gt; 100 kb) at 16p13.11 were observed in 23 patients, whereas no control had a deletion greater than 16 kb. Patients, even those with identically sized 16p13.11 deletions, presented with highly variable epilepsy phenotypes. For a subset of patients with a 16p13.11 deletion, we show a consistent reduction of expression for included genes, suggesting that haploinsufficiency might contribute to pathogenicity. We also investigated another possible mechanism of pathogenicity by using <e>hybridization</e>-based capture and next-generation sequencing of the homologous chromosome for ten 16p13.11-deletion patients to look for unmasked recessive mutations. Follow-up genotyping of suggestive polymorphisms failed to identify any convincing recessive-acting mutations in the homologous interval corresponding to the deletion. The observation that two of the 16p13.11 deletions were larger than 2 Mb in size led us to screen for other large deletions. We found 12 additional genomic regions harboring deletions &gt; 2 Mb in epilepsy patients, and none in controls. Additional evaluation is needed to characterize the role of these exceedingly large, non-locus-specific deletions in epilepsy. Collectively, these data implicate 16p13.11 and possibly other large deletions as risk factors for a wide range of epilepsy disorders, and they appear to point toward haploinsufficiency as a contributor to the pathogenicity of deletions.",M2

By tuning AC field frequency and DNA DEP mobility relative to its electrophoretic mobility due to electrostatic repulsion from like-charged nanocolloids, mismatch-specific binding of DNA molecules at the cusp is achieved by the converging flow, with a concentration factor about 6 orders of magnitude higher than the bulk, thus allowing fluorescent quantification of concentrated DNAs at the singularity in a generic buffer, at room temperature within a minute. Optimum flow rate and the corresponding <e>hybridization</e> rate change by nearly a factor of 2 with a single mismatch in the 26 base docking sequence and are also sensitive to the mismatch location.

The genomes of 30 individuals from three Asian populations (Korean, Chinese and Japanese) were interrogated with an ultra-high-resolution array CGH platform containing 24 million probes. Whole-genome sequencing data from a reference genome (NA10851, with 28.3x coverage) and two Asian genomes (AK1, with 27.8x coverage and AK2, with 32.0x coverage) were used to transform the relative copy number information obtained from array CGH experiments into absolute copy number values. We discovered 5,177 CNVs, of which 3,547 were putative Asian-specific CNVs. These common CNVs in Asian populations will be a useful resource for subsequent genetic studies in these populations, and the new method of calling absolute CNVs will be essential for applying CNV data to personalized medicine.",M2

However, fewer than 10% of known germline CNVs have been mapped to the single-nucleotide level. We characterized the sequence breakpoints from a dataset of all CNVs detected in three unrelated individuals in previous array-based CNV discovery experiments. We used targeted <e>hybridization</e>-based DNA capture and 454 sequencing to sequence 324 CNV breakpoints, including 315 deletions. We observed two major breakpoint signatures: 70% of the deletion breakpoints have 1-30 bp of microhomology, whereas 33% of deletion breakpoints contain 1-367 bp of inserted sequence. The co-occurrence of microhomology and inserted sequence is low (10%), suggesting that there are at least two different mutational mechanisms. Approximately 5% of the breakpoints represent more complex rearrangements, including local microinversions, suggesting a replication-based strand switching mechanism. Despite a rich literature on DNA repair processes, reconstruction of the molecular events generating each of these mutations is not yet possible.",M2

A valine-to-phenylalanine substitution at position 617 (V617F) in the Janus kinase 2 (JAK2) gene has been recently associated with key signaling abnormalities in the transduction of haemopoietic growth-factor receptors and is now considered as a useful clinical marker of myeloproliferative neoplasms. Several methods have recently been reported to detect the JAK2 V617F point mutation and show variable sensitivity.

The method was based on polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by <e>hybridization</e> to specific probes coupled with internally dyed microspheres. The assay comprises 3 steps: genomic DNA extraction, end point PCR reaction, direct hybridization of PCR fragments and quantification. It has been tested with different sources of nucleic acid.

Mapping of this deletion using fluorescence in situ <e>hybridization</e> revealed three deleted genes-CDH19, DSEL, and TXNDC10, and one gene that contained the deletion breakpoint, CCDC102B. We selected DSEL for further study in 125 patients with diaphragmatic hernias, as it is involved in the synthesis of decorin, a protein that is required for normal collagen formation and that is upregulated during myogenesis. We found p.Met14Ile in an unrelated patient with a late-presenting, anterior diaphragmatic hernia. In the murine diaphragm, Dsel was only weakly expressed at the time of diaphragm closure and its expression in C2C12 myoblast cells did not change significantly during myoblast differentiation, thus reducing the likelihood that the gene is involved in myogenesis of the diaphragm. Although it is possible that the 18q22.1 deletion and haploinsufficiency for DSEL contributed to the diaphragmatic defect in the patient, a definite role for DSEL and decorin in the formation of the collagen-containing, central tendon of the diaphragm has not yet been established.",M2

Single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) wrapped around the SWNTs to form ssDNA-wrapped SWNTE structures based on the interaction between ssDNA and SWNT. A sensitive differential pulse voltammetric (DPV) response was obtained at the ssDNA-wrapped SWNTE owing to the electrooxidation of guanine bases. Double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) was formed when ssDNA on the ssDNA-wrapped SWNTE was hybridized with complementary ssDNA (cDNA). The dsDNA was removed from the SWNTs by undergoing a process of preconditioning at -0.6 V. Consequentially, the DPV response of guanine bases decreased. The used SWNTE could be renewed easily via ultrasonically rinsing. On the basis of this mechanism, a label-free and readily reusable electrochemical DNA hybridization biosensor was designed by directly monitoring the current change of guanine bases. Under optimum conditions, the plot of the measurement signal of guanine bases versus the cDNA concentrations was a good straight line in the range of 40-110 nM with a detection limit of 20 nM (3s).

The modifier was synthesized from ferrocenecarboxylic acid by attaching a phenyltriazene derivative to one of the ferrocene Cp rings, while the other Cp ring containing the carboxylic acid was converted to an activated ester. The modifier was conjugated to an amine-modified DNA sequence. For immobilization of the conjugate at Au or GC electrodes, the triazene was activated by dimethyl sulfate for release of the diazonium salt. The salt was reductively converted to the aryl radical which was readily immobilized at the surface. DNA grafted onto electrodes exhibited remarkable <e>hybridization</e> properties, as detected through a reversible shift in the redox potential of the Fc redox label upon repeated hybridization/denaturation procedures with a complementary target DNA sequence. By using a methylene blue (MB) labeled target DNA sequence the hybridization could also be followed through the MB redox potential. Electrochemical studies demonstrated that grafting through the triazene modifier can successfully compete with existing protocols for DNA immobilization through the commonly used alkanethiol linkers and diazonium salts. Furthermore, the triazene modifier provides a practical one-step immobilization procedure.",M2
20303736,"Ternary mixed monolayers for simultaneous DNA orientation control and surface passivation for label free DNA <e>hybridization</e> electrochemical sensing.Target recognizing ternary mixed monolayer is constructed by simple sequential adsorption of thiol caped single stranded DNA (HS-ssDNA), 6-mercapto-1-hexanol (MCH) and 3-mercaptopropionic acid (MPA) diluents (abbreviated as HS-ssDNA/MPA/MCH) and applied for detection of DNA hybridization sequence by electrochemical method. The method is more reliable and reproducible on both conventional wire electrode and 100 nm scale gold-coated silicon chips. Detection limit of 10 pM is observed constantly on all types of electrodes. This ternary layer approach provides 60-80% discrimination effect between the hybridized and un-hybridized surfaces compared to the binary mixed monolayers HS-ssDNA/MCH and HS-ssDNA/MPA that showed 20-30% only. Characterization by impedance spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and surface Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) techniques reveals 'head-to-head' anisotropic hydrogen bonding between MPA and MCH diluents that controls the HS-ssDNA orientation and enhancing the electrostatic blockade for K3[Fe(CN)6]. This is the first report characterizing the ternary layer for DNA molecular affinity sensing. Results provided unprecedented insight onto the label free electrochemical sensing and understanding of the complex sensing mechanism to develop sensors that is more reliable.",M2
20303735,"Detection of <e>hybridization</e> of single-strand DNA PCR products in temperature change process by a novel metal-clamping piezoelectric sensor.Oligonucleotide probes on the sensor surface can be hybridized with single-strand DNA (ssDNA) that is formed from PCR products in ice bath after degeneration. Thus, detection of PCR products by piezoelectric sensors requires the participation of ssDNA PCR products in ice bath. When PCR products in ice bath are added into the buffer of the sensor well at room temperature, there will be a temperature change process during mixing. However, it still remains unclear whether the temperature change affects the frequency baseline stability of the sensor and the result judgment, which is the basic condition for detecting hybridization of nucleic acid. In this study, we detected the hybridization of HPV PCR products during temperature change process by a self-designed adjustable metal-clamping piezoelectric sensor. The study mainly involves sensor adjustment, probe immobilization and ice bath sample addition (at different concentrations and different volumes). The response curve of basic frequency in temperature change process showed three stages, i.e., increase, decrease to baseline, and continuous decrease to stability. The early increase of frequency and duration of the time can reach 55+/-7.4 Hz and 39 min when 40 microL sample (0-1 degrees C) was added into 110 microL buffer (25 degrees C). The frequency increase effect caused by temperature difference at early stage depends on the volume ratio of two liquids and on the temperature difference. The results indicate that we should pay more attention to possibly small volume of PCR products in ice bath and minor temperature difference of two liquids in operation.",M2
20299199,"A sensitive ligase-based ATP electrochemical assay using molecular beacon-like DNA.A sensitive and selective ligase-based signal-on electrochemical sensing method for adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) detection had been developed using molecular beacon (MB)-like DNA. In this method, the biotin-tagged MB-like DNA was self-assembled onto a gold electrode to form a stem-loop structure by means of facile gold-thiol chemistry, which resulted in blockage of electronic transmission. It was eT OFF state. In the presence of ATP, two nucleotide fragments which were complementary to the loop of the MB-like DNA could be ligated by the ATP-dependent T4 DNA ligase. <e>Hybridization</e> of the ligated DNA with the MB-like DNA induced a significant conformational change in this surface-confined DNA structure, which in turn released the biotin from the surface allowing free exchange of electrons with the electrode generating a measurable electrochemical signal (eT ON). The resulting change in electron transfer efficiency was readily measured by differential pulse voltammetry at target ATP concentrations as low as 0.05 nM and with linear response range from 0.1 to 1000 nM. Moreover, it was also able to discriminate ATP from its analogues. The proposed method had been successfully applied to the determination of ATP in the Escherichia coli O157:H7 extracts of water samples, and the linear response was found between the concentrations of 10(3) and 10(7) cfu/mL.",M2
20298599,"Differential expression of genes in salivary glands of male Rhipicephalus (Boophilus)microplus in response to infection with Anaplasma marginale.BACKGROUND: Bovine anaplasmosis, caused by the rickettsial tick-borne pathogen Anaplasma marginale (Rickettsiales: Anaplasmataceae), is vectored by Rhipicephalus (Boophilus)microplus in many tropical and subtropical regions of the world. A. marginale undergoes a complex developmental cycle in ticks which results in infection of salivary glands from where the pathogen is transmitted to cattle. In previous studies, we reported modification of gene expression in Dermacentor variabilis and cultured Ixodes scapularis tick cells in response to infection with A. marginale. In these studies, we extended these findings by use of a functional genomics approach to identify genes differentially expressed in R. microplus male salivary glands in response to A. marginale infection. Additionally, a R. microplus-derived cell line, BME26, was used for the first time to also study tick cell gene expression in response to A. marginale infection. RESULTS: Suppression subtractive <e>hybridization</e> libraries were constructed from infected and uninfected ticks and used to identify genes differentially expressed in male R. microplus salivary glands infected with A. marginale. A total of 279 ESTs were identified as candidate differentially expressed genes. Of these, five genes encoding for putative histamine-binding protein (22Hbp), von Willebrand factor (94Will), flagelliform silk protein (100Silk), Kunitz-like protease inhibitor precursor (108Kunz) and proline-rich protein BstNI subfamily 3 precursor (7BstNI3) were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR to be down-regulated in tick salivary glands infected with A. marginale. The impact of selected tick genes on A. marginale infections in tick salivary glands and BME26 cells was characterized by RNA interference. Silencing of the gene encoding for putative flagelliform silk protein (100Silk) resulted in reduced A. marginale infection in both tick salivary glands and cultured BME26 cells, while silencing of the gene encoding for subolesin (4D8) significantly reduced infection only in cultured BME26 cells. The knockdown of the gene encoding for putative metallothionein (93 Meth), significantly up-regulated in infected cultured BME26 cells, resulted in higher A. marginale infection levels in tick cells. CONCLUSIONS: Characterization of differential gene expression in salivary glands of R. microplus in response to A. marginale infection expands our understanding of the molecular mechanisms at the tick-pathogen interface. Functional studies suggested that differentially expressed genes encoding for subolesin, putative von Willebrand factor and flagelliform silk protein could play a role in A. marginale infection and multiplication in ticks. These tick genes found to be functionally relevant for tick-pathogen interactions will likely be candidates for development of vaccines designed for control of both ticks and tick-borne pathogens.",M2

Suppression subtraction hybridization (SSH) provides a sensitive method to isolate fungal genes expressed in planta. Total RNA is isolated from infected plants for comparison with the pathogen in axenic culture, or, in the application described here, plants infected with a wild type isolate are compared with plants infected with a mutant.

20232819,"Flow cytometric detection of Bacillus spoOA gene in biofilm using quantum dot labeling.Quantum dot (QD)-induced fluorescence detection of bead-based DNA sandwich <e>hybridization</e> was studied for rapid analysis of the Bacillus spoOA gene in biofilms. Hybridization between two DNA probes and target DNA occurred and the hybridization signal was detected in a flow cytometer. To prepare the bead-DNA capture and QD-DNA detection probes, the coupling or bioconjugation reactions were carefully controlled. It was successfully demonstrated that the fluorescence response of the hybrid complex was linear in the range of 3.2-1000 nM of synthetic target DNA (R(2) = 0.97) and that the detection limit was 0.02 nM. An optimized labeling method and bead-based DNA hybridization were then applied to real PCR products from a biofilm sample with satisfactory results (R(2) = 0.94), thereby confirming that the proposed assay provides a rapid, sensitive, and specific method for Bacillus spoOA gene detection in bofilms. This approach enables multiple target detection using multicolor QD-DNA probes in a shorter time.",M2

In reciprocal DNA/DNA <e>hybridization</e> experiments, DNA relatedness was high (69-100%) between P. syringae pv. alisalensis strains and the type strain of P. cannabina (genomospecies 9). In contrast, DNA relatedness was low (below 48%) between P. syringae pv. alisalensis and reference strains from the remaining genomospecies of P. syringae including the type strain of P. syringae and reference strain of genomospecies 3 (P. syringae pv. tomato) although the well-known crucifer pathogen, P. syringae pv. maculicola, also belongs to genomospecies 3. Additional evidence that P. syringae pv. alisalensis belongs to P. cannabina was sequence similarity in five gene fragments used in multilocus sequence typing, as well as similar rep-PCR patterns when using the BOX-A1R primers. The description of P. cannabina has been emended to include P. syringae pv. alisalensis. Host range testing demonstrated that P. syringae pv. alisalensis strains, originally isolated from broccoli, broccoli raab or arugula, were not pathogenic on Cannabis sativa (family Cannabinaceae). Additionally, P. cannabina strains, originally isolated from the C. sativa were not pathogenic on broccoli raab or oat while P. syringae pv. alisalensis strains were pathogenic on these hosts. Distinct host ranges for these two groups indicate that P. cannabina emend. consists of at least two distinct pathovars, P. cannabina pv. cannabina pv. nov., and P. cannabina pv. alisalensis comb. nov. Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola strain CFBP 1637 is a member of P. cannabina.",M2

The length and weight of mature females are over twice greater than those of mature males. To obtain sufficient information on gonad differentiation and the relationship between gonad development and growth in the fish, we compared gene expression between the ovary and testis using suppression subtractive <e>hybridization</e> (SSH). Testis cDNAs are subtracted from ovary cDNAs and are used to establish an ovary testis-subtracted cDNA library. A total of 41 nonredundant clones are identified, including 20 known cDNAs, 9 uncharacterized cDNAs (EST clones), and 12 novel sequences. For selected genes such as ZPC, RacGAP, survivin, aquaporin, CPEB, O5, O15, and O18, gene expression patterns are analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The results confirm that these genes are only expressed in the ovary and not in the testis, or at higher levels in the ovary than in the testis. At the same time, expressions of certain genes such as ZPC, survivin, aquaporin, CPEB, and O15 are demonstrated to possess sexual dimorphism in the kidney or muscle, and spleen. The results suggest that these genes could play key roles not only in the ovary but in other female tissues as well.",M2

The Eu(TTA)(3)(5-NH(2)-phen) with the characteristics of long lifetime and intense luminescence was labeled with reporter probe. The original extracted DNA samples without the purification and amplification process were directly used in the hybridization assay. The concentration of capture probe, hybridization temperature, hybridization and washing time were optimized.

20217621,"DNA sensors based on mixed self-assembled DNA/alkanethiol films.When designing DNA biosensors, the immobilization of specific DNA probes is one of the most essential parts. Unfortunately, many of the existing strategies (e.g., adsorption, complexation, and entrapment) can only be used on standard microscope slides, while for more tailored surfaces alternative strategies are still required. In the case of gold surfaces, the self-assembly of mixed DNA/alkanethiol films is a very common approach to directly couple single-stranded DNA probes. The quality of these mixed films greatly depends on different parameters including the sensitivity and the detection limit.

20210364,"Probing the transition state for nucleic acid <e>hybridization</e> using phi-value analysis.Genetic regulation by noncoding RNA elements such as microRNA and small interfering RNA (siRNA) involves hybridization of a short single-stranded RNA with a complementary segment in a target mRNA. The physical basis of the hybridization process between the structured nucleic acids is not well understood primarily because of the lack of information about the transition-state structure. Here we use transition-state theory, inspired by phi-value analysis in protein folding studies, to provide quantitative analysis of the relationship between changes in the secondary structure stability and the activation free energy. Time course monitoring of the hybridization reaction was performed under pseudo-steady-state conditions using a single fluorophore. The phi-value analysis indicates that the native secondary structure remains intact in the transition state. The nativelike transition state was confirmed via examination of the salt dependence of the hybridization kinetics, indicating that the number of sodium ions associated with the transition state was not substantially affected by changes in the native secondary structure. These results propose that hybridization between structured nucleic acids undergoes a transition state leading to formation of a nucleation complex and then is followed by sequential displacement of preexisting base pairings involving successive small energy barriers. The proposed mechanism might provide new insight into physical processes during small RNA-mediated gene silencing, which is essential to selection of a target mRNA segment for siRNA design.",M2

The detection limit was determined to be 0.5 pM with the signal-to-noise ratio of 3. The synergistic performances of DNA hybridization, strong biotin-streptavidin binding ability, and highly efficient polymerization provide a general platform for simple, highly sensitive and selective biosensor for the detection of the specific polA gene fragment of T. pallidum. It is expected that the proposed biosensor holds great promise for diagnosing disease in practice.",M2

Capture DNA is conjugated to the surface of microtiter plate wells through a biotin-streptavidin interaction. Target DNA is incubated with the plate in high salt concentrations. The reporter DNA-tagged liposomes encapsulating PQQ, the prosthetic group of the apo-enzyme glucose dehydrogenase (GDH), are used as the label to probe for bound target DNA. After washing away unbound liposomes and subsequent lysis of the bound fraction by surfactant, PQQ is released and available to activate the apo-enzyme. In the presence of glucose and a redox dye, 2,6-dichlorophenol indophenol (DCPIP), the dye is reduced to yield an optical color change from blue to colorless. This transition is observed visually or spectrophotometrically. The degree of optical change is proportional to the amount of PQQ present, which directly relates to the number of liposomes and, thus, the total amount of target DNA. An arbitrary target DNA sequence is used as a model system, and a limit of detection of 62 fmol is achieved.",M2

We first designed a control experiment with eight cDNA clones corresponding to sequences located on chromosome 4 and obtained robust and specific hybridization signals. Furthermore, hybridization signals along chromosome 4 were in good agreement with sRNA abundance as previously determined by Massive Parallel Sequence Signature (MPSS) in the case of untreated plants, but differed substantially after stress treatment.

In field-collected ticks, we used PCR to amplify a portion of the 18S rRNA gene in remnant blood meal DNA. Reverse line blot <e>hybridization</e> with host-specific probes was then used to subsequently detect and identify amplified DNA. Although several other taxa of wildlife hosts contribute to tick infection rates, our results confirm that the white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) is a reservoir host for several A. americanum-associated pathogens.

Both the conformation and surface density can be independently and deterministically controlled by taking advantage of the preferential adsorption of adenine nucleotides (dA) on gold, as previously demonstrated using a model system in Opdahl, A.; Petrovykh, D. Y.; Kimura-Suda, H.; Tarlov, M. J.; Whitman, L. J. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 2007, 104, 9-14. Here, we describe the immobilization and subsequent hybridization properties of a 15-nucleotide DNA probe sequence that has additional m adenine nucleotides, (dA)(m), at the 5' end. Quantitative analysis of immobilization and hybridization for these probes indicates that the (dA)(m) block preferentially adsorbs on gold, forcing the probe portion of the strand to adopt an upright conformation suited for efficient hybridization. In addition, a wide range of probe-to-probe lateral spacing can be achieved by coimmobilizing the probe DNA with a lateral spacer, a strand of k adenine nucleotides, (dA)(k). Altering either the length or relative concentration of the (dA)(k) spacers added during probe immobilization controls the average surface density of probes; the density of probes, in turn, systematically modulates their hybridization with solution targets.",M2
20193074,"Filifactor alocis--involvement in periodontal biofilms.BACKGROUND: Bacteria in periodontal pockets develop complex sessile communities that attach to the tooth surface. These highly dynamic microfloral environments challenge both clinicians and researchers alike. The exploration of structural organisation and bacterial interactions within these biofilms is critically important for a thorough understanding of periodontal disease. In recent years, Filifactor alocis, a fastidious, Gram-positive, obligately anaerobic rod was repeatedly identified in periodontal lesions using DNA-based methods. It has been suggested to be a marker for periodontal deterioration. The present study investigated the epidemiology of F. alocis in periodontal pockets and analysed the spatial arrangement and architectural role of the organism in in vivo grown subgingival biofilms. RESULTS: A species-specific oligonucleotide probe, FIAL, was designed and evaluated. A total of 490 subgingival plaque samples were submitted to PCR and subsequent dot blot <e>hybridization</e> to compare the prevalence of F. alocis in patients suffering from generalized aggressive periodontitis (GAP), chronic periodontitis (CP), and control subjects resistant to periodontitis. Moreover, a specially designed carrier system was used to collect in vivo grown subgingival biofilms from GAP patients. Subsequent topographic analysis was performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization.While the majority of patients suffering from GAP or CP harboured F. alocis, it was rarely detected in the control group. In the examined carrier-borne biofilms the organism predominantly colonized apical parts of the pocket in close proximity to the soft tissues and was involved in numerous structures that constitute characteristic architectural features of subgingival periodontal biofilms. CONCLUSIONS: F. alocis is likely to make a relevant contribution to the pathogenetic structure of biofilms accounting for periodontal inflammation and can be considered an excellent marker organism for periodontal disease.",M2
20192867,"The microbiota associated with implants restored with platform switching: a preliminary report.BACKGROUND: It was demonstrated that implants restored according to a platform-switching concept presented less crestal bone loss than implants restored with standard protocols. The aim of this study is to examine differences between the composition of the peri-implant microbiotas associated with implants restored with the platform-switching approach and implants restored with a standard internal connection protocol. METHODS: A total of 48 implants were examined in 18 subjects: 33 implants were restored with platform switching, and 15 implants were restored using the traditional approach. Thirty-six months after prosthetic loading, subgingival plaque samples were taken from the mesio- and disto-buccal aspects of each implant and from one tooth adjacent to one of the implants in each subject. The levels of 40 subgingival species were measured using checkerboard DNA-DNA <e>hybridization</e>. Microbiologic parameters were averaged within each subject and across subjects in each clinical group (platform switching versus control) and site category (implants versus teeth) separately. The significance of differences between clinical groups and site categories was determined using the Mann-Whitney test and the Wilcoxon test, respectively. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between groups for any of the species. The platform-switching group showed a small trend for lower levels of early colonizer members of the Actinomyces, purple and yellow complexes, Campylobacter species, Tannerella forsythia (previously T. forsythensis), and Porphyromonas gingivalis. Teeth and implants presented similar microbial profiles. CONCLUSION: The results of the study suggest that the difference in bone crest resorption between implants restored with platform switching compared to traditionally restored implants is not associated with differences in the peri-implant microbiota.",M2
20188968,"DNA quantification based on FRET realized by combination with surfactant CPB.In this work, we developed a novel DNA quantitative analysis based on fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) realized by combination with a surfactant CPB. The approach was capable of detecting long-stranded DNA in a separation-free format. A sandwich-type FAM-c-DNA-t-DNA-r-DNA-TAMRA conjugate was first formed by the capture probe tagged with FAM, the reporter probe tagged with TAMRA and the target DNA through <e>hybridization</e>. The donor (FAM) and the acceptor (TAMRA) were bridged to afford a FRET system. Subsequently, an addition of the cationic surfactant CPB to the system resulted in a substantial change of the microenvironment and an effective condensation of DNA strands. Consequently, without altering the component of the double strands, an enhanced acceptor fluorescence signal from FRET was achieved and a quantification of the target DNA containing 30 bases was enabled. Under the optimal experimental conditions, an excellent linear relationship between the increase of acceptor fluorescent peak area and the target DNA concentration was obtained over the range from 1.0 x 10(-7) to 3.0 x 10(-9) mol L(-1). The proposed approach offered adequate sensitivity for the detection of the target DNA at 1.0 x 10(-9) mol L(-1).",M2
20181279,"Free energy estimation of short DNA duplex <e>hybridizations</e>.BACKGROUND: Estimation of DNA duplex hybridization free energy is widely used for predicting cross-hybridizations in DNA computing and microarray experiments. A number of software programs based on different methods and parametrizations are available for the theoretical estimation of duplex free energies. However, significant differences in free energy values are sometimes observed among estimations obtained with various methods, thus being difficult to decide what value is the accurate one. RESULTS: We present in this study a quantitative comparison of the similarities and differences among four published DNA/DNA duplex free energy calculation methods and an extended Nearest-Neighbour Model for perfect matches based on triplet interactions. The comparison was performed on a benchmark data set with 695 pairs of short oligos that we collected and manually curated from 29 publications. Sequence lengths range from 4 to 30 nucleotides and span a large GC-content percentage range. For perfect matches, we propose an extension of the Nearest-Neighbour Model that matches or exceeds the performance of the existing ones, both in terms of correlations and root mean squared errors. The proposed model was trained on experimental data with temperature, sodium and sequence concentration characteristics that span a wide range of values, thus conferring the model a higher power of generalization when used for free energy estimations of DNA duplexes under non-standard experimental conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Based on our preliminary results, we conclude that no statistically significant differences exist among free energy approximations obtained with 4 publicly available and widely used programs, when benchmarked against a collection of 695 pairs of short oligos collected and curated by the authors of this work based on 29 publications. The extended Nearest-Neighbour Model based on triplet interactions presented in this work is capable of performing accurate estimations of free energies for perfect match duplexes under both standard and non-standard experimental conditions and may serve as a baseline for further developments in this area of research.",M2
20175901,"Transcriptome screen for fast evolving genes by Inter-Specific Selective <e>Hybridization</e> (ISSH).BACKGROUND: Fast evolving genes are targets of an increasing panel of biological studies, from cancer research to population genetics and species specific adaptations. Yet, their identification and isolation are still laborious, particularly for non-model organisms. We developed a method, named the Inter-Specific Selective Hybridization (ISSH) method, for generating cDNA libraries enriched in fast evolving genes. It utilizes transcripts of homologous tissues of distinct yet related species. Experimental hybridization conditions are monitored in order to discard transcripts that do not find their homologous counterparts in the two species sets as well as transcripts that display a strong complementarity between the two species. Only heteroduplexes that disanneal at low stringency are used for constructing the resulting cDNA library. RESULTS: We demonstrate the efficiency of the ISSH method by generating a brain cDNA library enriched in fast evolving transcripts of a non-model catfish species as well as a control, non-enriched library. Our results indicate that the enriched library contains effectively more fast evolving sequences than the control library. Gene annotation analyses also indicate enrichment in genes with low expression levels and non-ubiquitously expressed genes, both categories encompassing the majority of fast evolving genes. Furthermore, most of the identified transcripts show higher sequence divergence between two closely related catfish species as compared to recognized fast evolving DNA markers. CONCLUSIONS: The ISSH method offers a simple, inexpensive and efficient way to screen the transcriptome for isolating fast evolving genes. This method opens new opportunities in the investigation of biological mechanisms that include fast evolving genes, such as the evolution of lineage specific processes and traits responsible for species adaptation to their environment.",M2

In this proof-of-concept study, we evaluated the single-base mismatch recognition power of surface immobilized and self-assembled stem-loop hairpin DNA oligonucleotide probes modified to contain locked nucleic acid residues (LNA-HP). The stiffness change in conjunction with the stem opening of the interfacial molecules before and after <e>hybridization</e> led to clear variations of the overall film thickness or miniaturized nanospot height, which could be directly measured using an atomic force microscopy (AFM) nanolithography technique. Particularly, LNA-HP achieved highly differentiable readouts between perfectly complementary and singly mismatched targets (discrimination ratio as high as 2 to 3), outperforming the selectivity of its linear and hairpin counterparts with no LNA modification.",M2

The  sandwich-type  DNA technique comprises NH(2)-functionalized capture DNA immobilized on magnetic beads that can hybridize with one end of the target DNA. The other end of the target is recognized by a reporter DNA probe labeled with Au NPs on its 3-terminus. The hybridization events were monitored by a simple and direct luminol-AgNO(3) CL reaction with a detection limit of 0.5 pM through a non-stripping Au NPs catalysis. Moreover, the CL reaction of non-stripping Au NPs-luminol-AgNO(3) offers the advantages of being simpler and faster as compared to previous stripping Ag NPs and CuS methods. This simple and easy-to-use technique holds great promise for clinical applications of DNA hybridization.",M2
20174716,"Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy for facile DNA detection using gold nanoparticle aggregates formed via photoligation.We present a new type of nanoparticle-based DNA sensor using surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS) on gold nanoparticle (Au NP) aggregates formed by DNA photoligation. The DNA sensor exploits the photoligation reaction between oligodeoxynucleotides (ODNs) attached to the surfaces of Au NPs in the presence of target DNA (T-DNA). When <e>hybridization</e> takes place between the ODNs and T-DNA, Au NPs are covalently crosslinked to form aggregates via photoligation. Once the NP aggregates are formed, the interspace between Au NPs in the aggregate act as a stable  hot spot , and a SERS signal from the Raman-active molecules (sodium cacodylate) present in the hot spot is easily and sensitively detected. In contrast, a SERS signal is not detected if the hybridization is unsuccessful, because the stable hot spot does not form. This DNA sensor does not require an enzymatic reaction, fluorescent dye, precise temperature control, or complicated operating procedures.",M2
20174700,"A CdTe nanoparticle-modified hairpin probe for direct and sensitive electrochemical detection of DNA.Detection of specific sequences of target DNA is of high importance in many fields, especially in medicinal diagnostics. DNA sensors should exhibit fast response to minute concentrations of the target sequence and have the ability to distinguish single-base mismatches from fully complementary target. This study focuses on the response of an electrochemical, CdTe nanoparticle-modified hairpin DNA sensor. The stem-loop structured probes and the blocking poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) molecules were self-assembled on the gold electrode through S-Au bonding, to form a mixed monolayer employed as the sensing platform. Water-soluble CdTe nanoparticles were covalently attached to the hairpin probes (HPPs) and impedance spectroscopy was used for investigation of the electron transfer processes at a modified gold electrode before and after <e>hybridization</e> with the target DNA. The sensor showed reliable and sensitive detection of 4.7 fM of target. Although the selectivity of the sensor towards one-base mismatch targets needs to be improved, discrimination of non-complementary targets was achieved.",M2

Two of them (H30 and H40) have hairpin-like structures which show a large difference in thermal stability (Delta T(m) = 17.5 degrees C and 11.6 degrees C) comparing to uncaged ones. The other three (C20, C30 and C40) without stable secondary structures have the middle 20 deoxynucleotides complementary to 40-mer RNA. All caged asODNs have restricted opening which provides control over RNA/asODN interaction. RNase H assay results showed that 40-mer RNA digestion could be photo-modulated 2- to 3-fold upon light-activation with H30, H40, C30 and C40, while with C20, RNA digestion was almost not detectable; however, photo-activation triggered &gt;20-fold increase of RNA digestion. And gel shift assays showed that it needed &gt;0.04 microM H40 and 0.5 microM H30 to completely bind 0.02 microM 40-mer RNA, and for C40 and C30, it needed &gt;0.2 microM and 0.5 microM for 0.02 microM 40-mer RNA binding. However, even 4 microM C20 was not able to fully bind the same concentration of 40-mer RNA.

20162589,"Optimized DNA <e>hybridization</e> detection on nanocolloidal particles by dielectrophoresis.Oligonucleotides of varying surface coverage are functionalized onto the surface of 100 nm silica particles and the corresponding hybridization reaction with target ssDNA is studied using dielectrophoresis (DEP). The measured DEP cross-over frequency (cof) is found to be sensitive to the oligonucleotide surface conformation. Zeta potential and particle size measurements suggest that at low oligo surface concentrations, non-specific binding of oligo to the particle surface prevents efficient hybridization. At high surface coverage, steric hindrance due to the fully stretched, tightly packed oligo conformation prevents diffusion of DNA molecules to the particle surface. The optimum surface coverage exists at intermediate coverage where the particle is found to be the least electrically conductive, and hence exhibits the lowest measured cof. A simple DEP cof measurement hence allows one to determine the optimal oligo surface coverage for increased hybridization efficiency and detection sensitivity.",M2
20154106,"Distribution of virulence factors and molecular fingerprinting of Aeromonas species isolates from water and clinical samples: suggestive evidence of water-to-human transmission.A total of 227 isolates of Aeromonas obtained from different geographical locations in the United States and different parts of the world, including 28 reference strains, were analyzed to determine the presence of various virulence factors. These isolates were also fingerprinted using biochemical identification and pulse-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE). Of these 227 isolates, 199 that were collected from water and clinical samples belonged to three major groups or complexes, namely, the A. hydrophila group, the A. caviae-A. media group, and the A. veronii-A. sobria group, based on biochemical profiles, and they had various pulsotypes. When virulence factor activities were examined, Aeromonas isolates obtained from clinical sources had higher cytotoxic activities than isolates obtained from water sources for all three Aeromonas species groups. Likewise, the production of quorum-sensing signaling molecules, such as N-acyl homoserine lactone, was greater in clinical isolates than in isolates from water for the A. caviae-A. media and A. hydrophila groups. Based on colony blot DNA <e>hybridization</e>, the heat-labile cytotonic enterotoxin gene and the DNA adenosine methyltransferase gene were more prevalent in clinical isolates than in water isolates for all three Aeromonas groups. Using colony blot DNA hybridization and PFGE, we obtained three sets of water and clinical isolates that had the same virulence signature and had indistinguishable PFGE patterns. In addition, all of these isolates belonged to the A. caviae-A. media group. The findings of the present study provide the first suggestive evidence of successful colonization and infection by particular strains of certain Aeromonas species after transmission from water to humans.",M2

FRET probes have an improved toleration for single base mismatches than other probe chemistries, reducing the chances of missing highly variable RNA viruses. The assay could detect 2.5-25 DNA/RNA copies/microl (2.5 x 10(3)-2.5 x 10(4) copies/ml). Validation on 91 known positive respiratory specimens indicated similar specificity as commercial direct immunofluorescence assays (IFA) or single-round PCRs used in initial identification. Screening of 270 IFA negative respiratory specimens identified new viruses in 40/270 (14.8%) cases and additional 79/270 (29.3%) well recognized viruses missed by routine diagnostic assays including 6.7% co-infections.

The method consisted of PCR amplification of the ITS regions with universal primers, followed by <e>hybridization</e> of the digoxigenin-labeled PCR products to a panel of 35 oligonucleotide probes (17- to 30-mers) immobilized on a nylon membrane. The performance of the array was determined by testing 310 target strains (strains which we aimed to identify), including 122 reference strains and 188 clinical isolates. In addition, 98 nontarget strains were used for specificity testing. The sensitivity and the specificity of the array for the identification of pure cultures were 99.7 and 97.1%, respectively. The array was further assessed for its ability to detect anaerobic bacteria in 49 clinical specimens. Two species (Finegoldia magna and Bacteroides vulgatus) were detected in two specimens by the array, and the results were in accordance with those obtained by culture. The whole procedure of array hybridization took about 8 h, starting with the isolated colonies.

However, it is difficult to determine the quantitative abundance of various mutants in heterogeneous mixtures by conventional methods such as direct sequencing or the TaqMan assay. In this study, we investigated the possibility of using both allele-specific oligonucleotide hybridization (ASOH) and allele-specific oligonucleotide competitive hybridization (ASOCH) with the Handy Bio-Strand system for the quantitative identification of three well-defined HBV variants: the basal core promoter (BCP) mutations (nt1762 and nt1764), the pre-core (PC) mutation (nt1896), and variance at nt1858. Using standardized mixtures of wild-type and mutant DNA, optimal hybridization conditions for ASOH and ASOCH were determined. Next, the performance of these methods was evaluated using actual serum DNAs from HBV patients. Excellent reproducibility was obtained both in the analysis of internal positive controls and in the semi-quantitative categorization of heterogeneous viral mixtures into five abundance groups (0%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100% mutant virus).

METHODS: One-hundred and sixteen subjects, who had been treated for chronic periodontitis and were in a maintenance program, were randomly assigned one of four mouthrinses, to be used twice daily for three months. The mouthrinses were herbal 1, herbal 2, essential oil, and chlorhexidine. Clinical measurements and subgingival plaque samples were taken at baseline and at three months. Plaque samples were individually evaluated for 18 test species/taxa using checkerboard DNA-DNA <e>hybridization</e>. Significance of differences between baseline and three months for both microbiological and clinical parameters were determined using the Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test. Significance of difference among groups for change in clinical and microbiological parameters was determined using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA), adjusting for baseline values. RESULTS: Shifts in species proportions differed significantly for 9/18 test species/taxa among the four mouthrinse groups. Streptococcus and Capnocytophaga species were reduced most in the herbal rinse groups, while Veillonella parvula was reduced most in the essential oil and chlorhexidine groups. Actinomyces were also markedly reduced in the chlorhexidine group. Mean Plaque (PI) and Gingival Indices (GI) were reduced between baseline and three months in each group. Results emphasize that chlorhexidine (p &lt; 0.001) and herbal (p &lt; 0.05) rinses significantly reduced PI. Some subjects in each group responded better than others.

20126641,"Distinct genetic alterations in colorectal cancer.BACKGROUND: Colon cancer (CRC) development often includes chromosomal instability (CIN) leading to amplifications and deletions of large DNA segments. Epidemiological, clinical, and cytogenetic studies showed that there are considerable differences between CRC tumors from African Americans (AAs) and Caucasian patients. In this study, we determined genomic copy number aberrations in sporadic CRC tumors from AAs, in order to investigate possible explanations for the observed disparities. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We applied genome-wide array comparative genome <e>hybridization</e> (aCGH) using a 105k chip to identify copy number aberrations in samples from 15 AAs. In addition, we did a population comparative analysis with aCGH data in Caucasians as well as with a widely publicized list of colon cancer genes (CAN genes). There was an average of 20 aberrations per patient with more amplifications than deletions. Analysis of DNA copy number of frequently altered chromosomes revealed that deletions occurred primarily in chromosomes 4, 8 and 18. Chromosomal duplications occurred in more than 50% of cases on chromosomes 7, 8, 13, 20 and X. The CIN profile showed some differences when compared to Caucasian alterations. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Chromosome X amplification in male patients and chromosomes 4, 8 and 18 deletions were prominent aberrations in AAs. Some CAN genes were altered at high frequencies in AAs with EXOC4, EPHB6, GNAS, MLL3 and TBX22 as the most frequently deleted genes and HAPLN1, ADAM29, SMAD2 and SMAD4 as the most frequently amplified genes. The observed CIN may play a distinctive role in CRC in AAs.",M2
20112804,"Comparative genomic <e>hybridization</e> array study and its utility in detection of constitutional and acquired anomalies.The last decade has witnessed an upsurge in the knowledge of cytogenetic disorders and putting the old technology in a new basket with molecular genetics.

However, with the advent of technology of fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), the resolution of genetic aberrations can reach to 3-5 Mb, nonetheless the anomalies smaller than the above, need further precision which has been achieved using comparative genomic hybridization array (CGH-array). Introduction of array-CGH has brought higher sensitivity with automated DNA fragment analyzer and DNA chip for submicroscopic chromosomal anomalies that are missed till date in many of the acquired and constitutional genetic disorders. The resolution of the technology varies from several Kb to 1 Mb depending upon the type of array selected.

20110385,"Reverse line blot <e>hybridization</e> and DNA sequencing studies of the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer regions of five emerging pathogenic Nocardia species.The objective of this study was to examine DNA sequence polymorphisms in the 16S-23S rRNA gene intergenic spacer (ITS) regions of five emerging pathogenic Nocardia species: Nocardia beijingensis, Nocardia blacklockiae, Nocardia thailandica, Nocardia elegans and Nocardia vinacea. A set of six isolates belonging to the species of interest and 135 isolates belonging to other Nocardia species was studied. A PCR-based reverse line blot (RLB) hybridization assay incorporating species- or intraspecies ITS rRNA gene operon-specific probes was then developed for species identification. Substantial intraspecies sequence variation among different ITS operons was identified. Four sequence types of N. thailandica, eight sequence types of N. beijingensis (four types for each of two strains) and five sequence types of N. blacklockiae, N. elegans and N. vinacea were found. The results represent the first evidence of ITS sequence heterogeneity in emerging species of Nocardia. By incorporating species/operon-specific probes into a RLB assay, unique RLB patterns were identified for each of the species and every sequence type. The PCR/RLB assay demonstrated high specificity and showed promise in both the identification and genotyping of Nocardia species.

20108214,"Molecular detection methods of human papillomavirus (HPV).Human papillomavirus (HPV) testing can identify women at risk of cervical cancer. Currently, molecular detection methods are the gold standard for identification of HPV. The three categories of molecular assays that are available are based on the detection of HPV DNA and include (1) non-amplified <e>hybridization</e> assays, such as Southern transfer hybridization (STH), dot blot hybridization (DB) and in situ hybridization (ISH); (2) signal amplified hybridization assays, such as hybrid capture assays (HC2); (3) target amplification assays, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ PCR. STH requires large amounts of DNA, is laborious and not reproducible, while ISH has only moderate sensitivity for HPV. The sensitivity of the HC2 assay is similar to that of PCR-based assays, with high sensitivity being achieved by signal rather than target amplification. PCR-based detection is both highly sensitive and specific. Since PCR can be performed on very small amounts of DNA, it is ideal for use on specimens with low DNA content.

20104556,"Effect of the ortho modification of azobenzene on the photoregulatory efficiency of DNA <e>hybridization</e> and the thermal stability of its cis form.We synthesized various azobenzenes methylated at their ortho positions with respect to the azo bond for more effective photoregulation of DNA hybridization. Photoregulatory efficiency, evaluated from the change of T(m) (DeltaT(m)) induced by trans-cis isomerization, was significantly improved for all ortho-modified azobenzenes compared with non-modified azobenzene due to the more stabilized trans form and the more destabilized cis form. Among the synthesized azobenzenes, 4-carboxy-2',6'-dimethylazobenzene (2',6'-Me-Azo), in which two ortho positions of the distal benzene ring with respect to carboxyl group were methylated, exhibited the largest DeltaT(m), whereas the newly synthesized 2,6-Me-Azo (4-carboxy-2,6-dimethylazobenzene), which possesses two methyl groups on the two ortho positions of the other benzene ring, showed moderate improvement of DeltaT(m). Both NMR spectroscopic analysis and computer modeling revealed that the two methyl groups on 2',6'-Me-Azo were located near the imino protons of adjacent base pairs; these stabilized the DNA duplex by stacking interactions in the trans form and destabilized the DNA duplex by steric hindrance in the cis form. In addition, the thermal stability of cis-2',6'-Me-Azo was also greatly improved, but not that of cis-2,6-Me-Azo. Solvent effects on the half-life of the cis form demonstrated that cis-to-trans isomerization of all the modified azobenzenes proceeded through an inversion route. Improved thermal stability of 2',6'-Me-Azo but not 2,6-Me-Azo in the cis form was attributed to the retardation of the inversion process due to steric hindrance between lone pair electrons of the pi orbital of the nitrogen atom and the methyl group on the distal benzene ring.",M2

Thus we were be able to find the genes that are related with cervical tumors of Uigur women. A total of 300 samples were subject to DNA sequencing analysis and 46 genes were found to express differentially in tumors compared with normal tissues. Of the 46 genes, 24 genes were up-regulated whereas 22 genes were down-regulated in cervical tumors.

20099912,"Combining chemoselective ligation with polyhistidine-driven self-assembly for the modular display of biomolecules on quantum dots.One of the principle hurdles to wider incorporation of semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) in biology is the lack of facile linkage chemistries to create different types of functional QD--bioconjugates. A two-step modular strategy for the presentation of biomolecules on CdSe/ZnS core/shell QDs is described here which utilizes a chemoselective, aniline-catalyzed hydrazone coupling chemistry to append hexahistidine sequences onto peptides and DNA. This specifically provides them the ability to ratiometrically self-assemble to hydrophilic QDs. The versatility of this labeling approach was highlighted by ligating proteolytic substrate peptides, an oligoarginine cell-penetrating peptide, or a DNA-probe to cognate hexahistidine peptidyl sequences. The modularity allowed subsequently self-assembled QD constructs to engage in different types of targeted bioassays. The self-assembly and photophysical properties of individual QD conjugates were first confirmed by gel electrophoresis and Forster resonance energy transfer analysis. QD-dye-labeled peptide conjugates were then used as biosensors to quantitatively monitor the proteolytic activity of caspase-3 or elastase enzymes from different species. These sensors allowed the determination of the corresponding kinetic parameters, including the Michaelis constant (K(M)) and the maximum proteolytic activity (V(max)). QDs decorated with cell-penetrating peptides were shown to be successfully internalized by HEK 293T/17 cells, while nanocrystals displaying peptide--DNA conjugates were utilized as fluorescent probes in <e>hybridization</e> microarray assays.

By using Cy5-labeled model oligonucleotides for UV immobilization and Cy3-labeled complementary sequences for hybridization, we measured independently the number of immobilized and hybridized oligonucleotides on the microarray surface. By using a two-color fluorescence LED setup and a novel method to compile the data, a full analysis has been made of the effects of oligonucleotide composition (length and sequence) on both immobilization and hybridization. Short homo-oligomer sequences (tails) of uracils, thymines, and, to a limited extent, guanines attached to a hybridization sequence improve immobilization. We propose a possible mechanism explaining the grafting of these nucleotides to amine-functionalized substrates, and we found evidence that the DNA backbone is possibly involved in the immobilization process. Hybridization, on the other hand, greatly improves as a function of tail length regardless of tail composition. On the basis of statistical arguments, the probes increasingly bind via their tail, with the hybridization sequence becoming more accessible to its complement. We conclude that all tails, sequence independent, improve hybridization signals, which is caused by either improved immobilization (especially thymine and uracil) or improved hybridization (most pronounced with guanine tails).",M2
20092797,"Screening of differentially expressed genes in the hypothalamus of a rat neuropathic pain model following sciatic nerve injury.BACKGROUND: Neuropathic pain is induced by injury or disease of the nervous system. Most studies have so far focused only on a few known molecules and signaling pathways among neurons. However, all signal transmissions involved in neuropathic pain appear to be an integral system at different molecular levels. This study was designed to screen the differentially expressed genes of the hypothalamus in chronic constriction injury (CCI) rats and analyze their functions in developing neuropathic pain. METHODS: Ten adult female Sprague-Dawley rats ((200 +/- 10) g) were used in experimental group and sham group (n = 5 in each group). Mechanical allodynia tests were performed to ensure that the CCI rat model was constructed successfully. Total hypothalamus RNAs were isolated from each group. Forward suppression subtractive <e>hybridization</e> (SSH) library of rat hypothalamus was constructed and up-regulated cDNA clones at neuropathic pain states were obtained via suppressed subtractive hybridization technique and the functions of these genes were analyzed bioinformatically. RESULTS: Mechanical allodynia tests showed that the experimental rats had a significantly reduced mechanical allodynia threshold 3 to 13 days after CCI vs sham surgery rats (P &lt; 0.01), indicating that the model was successful. Forward SSH library of the rat hypothalamus was constructed successfully and 26 over-expressed expression sequence tags (ESTs) were obtained from these up-regulated cDNA clones. CONCLUSION: Twenty-six up-regulated genes, involved in the regulation of cell cycle and apoptosis, signal transduction, and neuroprotection, may play key roles in decreasing mechanical withdraw thresholds in CCI rats, which implicates a multidimensional and integrated molecular mechanism at gene level in developing neuropathic pain with the supraspinal contributions.",M2
20092337,"Sensitive and selective amplified fluorescence DNA detection based on exonuclease III-aided target recycling.A limitation of many traditional approaches to the detection of specific oligonucleotide sequences, such as molecular beacons, is that each target strand hybridizes with (and thus activates) only a single copy of the relevant probe sequence. This 1:1 <e>hybridization</e> ratio limits the gain of most approaches and thus their sensitivity. Here we demonstrate a nuclease-amplified DNA detection scheme in which exonuclease III is used to  recycle  target molecules, thus leading to greatly improved sensitivity relative to, for example, traditional molecular beacons without any significant restriction in the choice of target sequences. The exonuclease-amplified assay can detect target DNA at concentrations as low as 10 pM when performed at 37 degrees C, which represents a significant improvement over the equivalent molecular beacon alone. Moreover, at 4 degrees C we can obtain a detection limit as low as 20 aM, albeit at the cost of a 24 h incubation period. Finally, our assay can be easily interrogated with the naked eye and is thus amenable to deployment in the developing world, where fluorometric detection is more problematic.",M2
20092310,"Detection of the most common corneal dystrophies caused by BIGH3 gene point mutations using a multispot gold-capped nanoparticle array chip.The localized surface plasmon resonance (LSPR) optical property has recently been well employed as an effective platform for the quantitative detection of protein-protein interactions on the nanoscale. However, its advantage has not been fully explored yet in the DNA diagnosis field, especially in detecting point mutations of DNA. Point mutations of the BIGH3 gene are associated with the most common corneal dystrophies (CDs), such as Avellino corneal dystrophy, Reis-Bucklers corneal dystrophy, and lattice corneal dystrophy. Since the detection of these corneal dystrophies is urgently needed before laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis operation to prevent blindness, genetic analysis of the BIGH3 gene is critical in most ophthalmological clinics. In this study, we report LSPR-based detection of the BIGH3 gene mutations by using a multispot gold-capped nanoparticle array (MG-NPA) chip. The analytical range and sensitivity of the MG-NPA chip were determined by measuring different concentrations of each CD target DNA in the range of 1 fM to 1 microM. Under the optimal conditions, the detection of DNA <e>hybridization</e> with each CD target DNA was performed with a detection limit of 1 pM target DNA. The selective discrimination against a single-base mismatch DNA sequence was also achieved by using both homozygous and heterozygous CD samples. It demonstrates that the label-free LSPR-based optical biosensor system employing the MG-NPA chip provides a new diagnostic platform allowing the selective and sensitive detection of various DNA point mutations, leading to possible diagnosis of mutation-related diseases including corneal dystrophies reported here.",M2
20091768,"Photoregulated assembly/disassembly of DNA-templated protein arrays using modified oligonucleotide carrying azobenzene side chains.DNA-templated self-assembly of nanomaterials provides great potential for applications including biosensors, nanoelectronics, and programmable and autonomous molecular machines. To switch or regulate the activities of those nanobiotechnological devices, non-invasive methods to assemble and disassemble specific nanoscale components are needed. Here, we describe photocontrol of assembly of DNA-templated protein arrays in solution, by using photo-controlled duplex formation of oligonucleotides carrying azobenzene. As a proof of concept prototype, we designed a one-dimensional protein array system that consists of a scaffold of DNA and two kinds of anchor DNA that were conjugated with fluorescent proteins (CFP and YFP, respectively). The scaffold DNA was modified to carry multiple azobenzene side chains so that the <e>hybridization</e> involving the scaffold DNA is regulated by photoirradiation through conformational changes of the azobenzene moieties. Melting temperatures of duplex made of the modified DNA scaffold and an anchor oligonucleotide were shifted significantly and reversibly by UV and visible photoirradiation (difference of T(m) was 34.8 degrees C in 150 mM potassium acetate). Measurements of Förster resonance energy transfer between CFP and YFP showed that the assembly of the protein array system was also changed by photoirradiation. Such non-invasive and reversible method to control assembly/disassembly of multiple, specific proteins in a DNA-templated protein array system would provide many functions for nanobiotechnological devices such as on/off switches and the ability to change the configuration reversibly.",M2
20090970,"<e>Hybridization</e>-sensitive fluorescent DNA probe with self-avoidance ability.Hybridization-sensitive fluorescent probes have an inherent disadvantage: self-dimerization of the probe prevents the fluorescence quenching prior to hybridization with the target, resulting in a high background signal. To avoid self-dimerization of probes, we focused on a base pair formed by 2'-deoxyinosine (I) and N(4)-ethyl-2'-deoxycytidine (E). I and E bases form more stable base pairs with cytosine and guanine, respectively, compared with an I/E base pair. New hybridization-sensitive fluorescent probes, IE probes, were prepared containing three unnatural nucleotides, I, E and D(514) as a doubly thiazole orange-labeled nucleotide. The IE probes had low thermostability, sufficient to avoid self-dimerization. Absorption spectra of the IE probes exhibited a hybridization-dependent shift of the absorption maximum, suggesting that excitonic interaction was working between the thiazole orange dyes in the probe. Interdye excitonic interaction of IE probes was very effective; thus, replacement of guanine and cytosine with I and E improved the ratio of fluorescence intensities after and before hybridization (I(hybrid)/I(nonhybrid)). Although a significant weakness in fluorescence intensity was observed for several IE probes after hybridization with the target sequence when both or either of the bases adjacent to D(514) is E, a dramatic recovery of the fluorescence intensity of hybrids was observed when any E adjacent to D(514) was replaced with cytosine. Improvement of the I(hybrid)/I(nonhybrid) value by incorporation of I and E helped the design of a long probe sequence for mRNA imaging.",M2

20090815,"Surface-enhanced plasmon resonance detection of nanoparticle-conjugated DNA <e>hybridization</e>.We have investigated surface-enhanced plasmon resonance detection of DNA hybridization. Surface enhancement was based on the excitation of localized surface plasmon using subwavelength nanogratings, at a 300 nm period, coated with 24-mer ssDNA oligonucleotide, while optical signatures of DNA were amplified at the same time by gold nanoparticles conjugated with complementary ssDNA strands. When using nanoparticles of different sizes, maximum sensitivity enhancement, of more than 18 times, was obtained with nanoparticles of 20 nm diameter. This enhancement is mainly due to nanoparticle-associated signal amplification. Additional surface enhancement boosted the detection sensitivity by 57%. We have also confirmed the sensitivity enhancement to be linearly related to nanoparticle volume.",M2
20087765,"Robinia pseudoacacia in Poland and Japan is nodulated by Mesorhizobium amorphae strains.Robinia pseudoacacia microsymbionts from plants growing in Poland and Japan were evaluated for phylogeny and taxonomic position by genomic approach. Based on the comparative analyses of atpD (368 bp) and dnaK (573 bp) gene sequences as well as 16S rDNA restriction analysis (RFLP-16S rDNA), R. pseudoacacia microsymbionts were identified as Mesorhizobium strains. In dnaK and atpD gene phylograms R. pseudoacacia nodulators formed robust, monophyletic clusters with Mesorhizobium species with the nucleotide sequence similarity of 91-98% and 90-98%, respectively. The classification of R. pseudoacacia rhizobia to the genus Mesorhizobium was also supported by amplified 16S rDNA restriction analysis. The studied bacteria formed common clusters with Mesorhizobium species, and their DNA patterns were identical or nearly identical to Mesorhizobium genus strains. When DNA-DNA <e>hybridization</e> was performed, the total DNA of the representative R. pseudoacacia rhizobia exhibited 51-75% relatedness to DNA of Mesorhizobium amorphae ICMP15022 strain and below 41% to DNA of other Mesorhizobium species. These results showed that R. pseudoacacia and M. amorphae belong to the same genomospecies. The G+C content of DNA of R. pseudoacacia two microsymbionts was 59.7 and 60.6 mol% compared to 61-64 mol% across M. amorphae strains.",M2
20084277,"Identification of two critically deleted regions within chromosome segment 7q35-q36 in EVI1 deregulated myeloid leukemia cell lines.Chromosomal rearrangements involving the EVI1 proto-oncogene are a recurrent finding in myeloid leukemias and are indicative of a poor prognosis. Rearrangements of the EVI1 locus are often associated with monosomy 7 or cytogenetic detectable deletions of part of 7q. As EVI1 overexpression alone is not sufficient to induce leukemia, loss of a 7q tumour suppressor gene might be a required cooperating event. To test this hypothesis, we performed high-resolution array comparative genomic <e>hybridization</e> analysis of twelve EVI1 overexpressing patients and three EVI1 deregulated cell lines to search for 7q submicroscopic deletions. This analysis lead to the delineation of two critical regions, one of 0.39 Mb on 7q35 containing the CNTNAP2 gene and one of 1.33 Mb on chromosome bands 7q35-q36 comprising nine genes in EVI1 deregulated cell lines. These findings open the way to further studies aimed at identifying the culprit EVI1 implicated tumour suppressor genes on 7q.",M2
20083083,"Optimization of a microfluidic microarray device for the fast discrimination of fungal pathogenic DNA.A microfluidic microarray device, which has been developed for parallel DNA detection, is now further optimized for more rapid and sensitive DNA detection and for the single-base-pair discrimination of two fungal pathogenic PCR products. Two poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS)-based microfluidic chips consist of radial and spiral microchannels in which flexible probe creation and convenient sample delivery have been achieved by centrifugal pumping. The microarray <e>hybridizations</e> occurred at the cross sections within the spiral channels intersecting the preprinted radial probe lines. The centrifugal pumping method showed advantages over the vacuum suction method in terms of parallel solution delivery and less signal variations between replicate samples. The effect of microchannel depth was studied, and hybridization time is predictable at a certain rotation speed. Cy5 dye labels were proved to show much higher hybridization efficiency as well as less photobleaching effect as compared with the fluorescein dye labels used in our previous work. With these optimized conditions, the method was applied to the detection of three fungal pathogenic polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products with a sample load of 0.2 ng (in 1 microl). Furthermore, the single-base-pair discrimination between the PCR products of two relevant Botrytis species (B. cinerea and B. squamosa) was achieved in a duration as short as 3 min.",M2

In addition to gains of 1q and 5p, and losses of 10p and 13q14 approximately q22, this tumor had also losses of two regions to which tumor suppressor genes are mapped: 1p36 (SDHB) and 17q11.2 (NF1). Both genes are associated with hereditary cancer syndromes, including gastrointestinal stromal tumors. Whether these two genes played a role in the development or progression of this phyllodes tumor of the breast with a sarcomatous stromal component warrants further investigation of similar cases.",M2
20078092,"Homogeneous competitive <e>hybridization</e> assay based on two-photon excitation fluorescence resonance energy transfer.Recently, we have successfully developed a two-photon excitation fluorescence resonance energy transfer (TPE-FRET)-based homogeneous immunoassay using two-photon excitable small organic molecule as the energy donor. In the present work, the newly emerging TPE-FRET technique was extended to the determination of oligonucleotide. A new TPE molecule with favorable two-photon action cross section was synthesized [2-(2,5-bis(4-(dimethylamino)styryl)-1H-pyrrol-1-yl)acetic acid, abbreviated as TP-COOH], with the tagged reactive carboxyl group allowing facile conjugation with streptavidin (SA). Employing the TP-COOH molecule as energy donor and black hole quencher 1 (BHQ-1) as acceptor, a TPE-FRET-based homogeneous competitive hybridization model was constructed via a biotin-streptavidin bridge. Through the hybridization between a biotinylated single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) and a BHQ-1-linked ssDNA, and the subsequent capture of the as-formed hybrid by TP-COOH labeled SA, the donor fluorescence was quenched due to the FRET between TP-COOH and BHQ-1. Upon the competition between a target ssDNA and the quencher-linked ssDNA toward the biotinylated oligonucleotide, the donor fluorescence was recovered in a target-dependent manner. Good linearity was obtained with the target oligonucleotide ranging from 0.08 to 1.52 microM. The method was applied to spiked serum and urine samples with satisfying recoveries obtained. The results of this work verified the applicability of TPE-FRET technique in hybridization assay and confirmed the advantages of TPE-FRET in complicated matrix.",M2
20064998,"Genotyping of Trypanosoma cruzi sublineage in human samples from a North-East Argentina area by <e>hybridization</e> with DNA probes and specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR).We have evaluated blood samples of chronic and congenital Trypanosoma cruzi-infected patients from the city of Reconquista located in the northeast of Argentina where no information was previously obtained about the genotype of infecting parasites. Fourteen samples of congenital and 19 chronical patients were analyzed by hybridization with DNA probes of minicircle hypervariable regions (mHVR). In congenital patients, 50% had single infections with TcIId, 7% single infections with TcIIe, 29% mixed infections with TcIId/e, and 7% had mixed infections with TcIId/b and 7% TcIId/b, respectively. In Chronical patients, 52% had single infections with TcIId, 11% single infections with TcIIe, 26% had mixed infections with TcIId/e, and 11% had non-identified genotypes. With these samples, we evaluated the minicircle lineage-specific polymerase chain reaction assay (MLS-PCR), which involves a nested PCR to HVR minicircle sequences and we found a correlation with hybridization probes of 96.4% for TcIId and 54.8% for TcIIe.",M2
20055593,"HIV type 1 molecular epidemiology among high-risk clients attending the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic in Bangkok, Thailand.Several studies have reported an increasing number of non-CRF01_AE infections in high-risk groups in Thailand suggesting a more complex HIV-1 epidemic. This study assessed the complexity of the HIV epidemic among high-risk clients tested for HIV-1 at the Thai Red Cross Anonymous Clinic (TRCAC) between July 1, 2006 and February 28, 2007. HIV-1 genotypes were determined from plasma of infected subjects (n = 401) by the multiregion <e>hybridization</e> assay (MHAbce, v.2). Univariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to determine risk factors associated with HIV prevalence and non-CRF01_AE infection. The estimated overall HIV prevalence was 14.1%: 25.3% among men who have sex with men (MSM), 18.4% among heterosexual women, and 9.6% among heterosexual men. Among the risk factors found to be associated with HIV prevalence were age (25-29 years), risk behavior (MSM), marital status (not single), education (less than high school), and inconsistent condom use. Overall, non-CRF01_AE strains accounted for 18.9% of the infections: 25.3% among MSM and 14.8% and 20.4% among heterosexual women and men, respectively. Our results indicate a concentrated and genetically complex HIV epidemic among Thai MSM.

Genomic DNA and mRNA were quantified using real-time quantitative PCR. RESULTS: A novel amplification was found at the chromosomal region 1p32-31 in a JHH-2 HCC cell line within which JUN is amplified and overexpressed.

20056677,"Extrachromosomal amplification mechanisms in a glioma with amplified sequences from multiple chromosome loci.Accumulation of extrachromosomal DNA molecules (double minute) is often responsible for gene amplification in cancers, but the mechanisms leading to their formation are still largely unknown. By using quantitative PCR, chromosome walking, in situ <e>hybridization</e> on metaphase chromosomes and whole genome analysis, we studied a glioma containing four extrachromosomally amplified loci (7p11, 1q32.1, 5p15 and 9p2). Complex extrachromosomal DNA molecules were formed by the fusion of several syntenic or non-syntenic DNA fragments from 7p11, 5p15 to 9p2. Fragments ranged from a few base pairs to megabase pairs. Scars of the amplification process remained at the original locus in the form of deletions or chromosome rearrangements. Chromosome fragmentation, due to replication stress, could explain this complex situation. In contrast, at 1q32.1, the initial extrachromosomal DNA molecule resulted from the circularization of a single fragment associated with an intrachromosomal deletion including, but larger than, the amplified sequence. The nature of the sequences involved in these rearrangements suggests that a V(D)J-like illegitimate recombination contributes to its formation.",M2
