20303917,"Treatment of the obstructive sleep apnea syndrome in adults by mandibular advancement device: the state of the art.The obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) constitutes a non-negligible risk which requires management by specialists of the upper airways. When OSAS is diagnosed, it needs to be treated and different resources are listed. Different forms of treatment can be envisaged: positive pressure ventilation (VCPP), mandibular advancement devices (MAD), and surgery (soft and hard tissues). The authors focus especially the treatments for MAD, outlining their positive and negative impact on ventilation, <e>TMJ</e>, the bony base and interarch relationships.",M1
20213034,"Use of a structural equation model for prediction of pain symptoms in patients with orofacial pain and temporomandibular disorders.AIMS: To develop and test a biopsychosocial model using structural equation modeling for predicting orofacial pain symptoms in a sample of patients with masticatory muscle pain (MMP). METHODS: Data were collected from clinic records of 251 adult patients who presented for initial evaluation to the Orofacial Pain Center at the University of Kentucky College of Dentistry and were subsequently diagnosed with MMP. Data were used to fit a model relating stressors, psychological distress, arousal, sleep problems, oral parafunction, and pain symptoms. Items from the Multidimensional Pain Inventory (MPI) and the IMPATH:<e>TMJ</e>, a comprehensive biopsychosocial assessment of patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD), were used to construct a measurement model of five latent variables. RESULTS: Estimation of the model indicated a good fit to the data and significant associations between stressors, psychological distress, arousal, sleep problems, and pain symptoms. Sleep problems partially mediated the relation between arousal and pain symptoms. Contrary to hypotheses, no association occurred between oral parafunction and pain symptoms, possibly indicating that any relationship between oral parafunction and pain symptoms may not exist. CONCLUSION: Results from the model tested in the present study are an additional step toward developing a more comprehensive biopsychosocial model explaining the nature and etiology of MMP in orofacial pain and TMD. With additional development and testing, it may also serve as an aid to planning interventions, especially psychosocial interventions targeting stress management, psychophysiological regulation, psychological distress, and sleep problems.",M1
19767710,"Electromyographic study of activity of the masseter and anterior temporalis muscles in patients with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) dysfunction: comparison with the clinical dysfunction index.OBJECTIVES: A comparison was made between the electromyographic patterns specific to patient with temporomandibular disorders and that of normal healthy patients. STUDY DESIgn: Electromyographic tests were carried out during rest and function of the masseter muscles and anterior temporalis muscles in a homogeneous group consisting of 95 patients for whom such pathology and its different degree of severity had been previously studied by means of a Helkimo Test. The electromyographic exploration results were compared to those of a control group consisting of 31 healthy subjects. RESULTS: There were significant differences among patients with a different degree of clinical dysfunction, as well as between these and the control group. These differences were more important during maximum effort clenching and mastication. During maximum effort clenching, differences in masseteric activity were observed between control group and group III, between groups I and II and between groups I and III. Meanwhile, differences in temporalis activity were significant among all groups except between groups I and II. The multiple comparison analysis demonstrated the existence of significant statistical differences between healthy subjects and patients with severe TMD. However, the linear combination of these electromyographic (EMG) variables led us to elaborate four linear functions that classify all subjects into four well defined groups. Once extreme cases were eliminated, our EMG classification revealed an 80% match with that of the Helkimo Test. We thus conclude that in many cases, classification using electromyographic criteria matches that established by the Helkimo Test.",M1
19592309,"Bilateral widespread mechanical pain sensitivity in women with myofascial temporomandibular disorder: evidence of impairment in central nociceptive processing.Our aim was to investigate bilateral, widespread pressure-pain hypersensitivity in nerve, muscle, and joint tissues in women with myofascial temporomandibular disorders (TMD) without concomitant comorbid conditions. Twenty women with myofascial TMD (aged 20 to 28 years old), and 20 healthy matched women (aged 20 to 29 years), were recruited. Pressure-pain thresholds (PPT) were bilaterally assessed over supra-orbital (V1), infra-orbital (V2), mental (V3) nerves, median (C5), radial (C6) and ulnar (C7) nerve trunks, the C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, the lateral pole of the temporo mandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>), and the tibialis anterior muscle in a blinded design. The results showed that PPTs were significantly decreased bilaterally over the supra-orbital, infra-orbital, and mental nerves, median, ulnar, and radial nerve trunks, the lateral pole of the TMJ, the C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint, and the tibialis anterior muscle in patients with myofascial TMD as compared to healthy controls (all sites: P &lt; .001). There were no significant differences in the magnitude of PPT decreases between the trigeminal and extratrigeminal test sites. PPT over the mental nerve, the TMJ, C5-C6 zygapophyseal joint and tibialis anterior muscle were negatively correlated to both duration of pain symptoms and TMD pain intensity (P &lt; .05). Our findings revealed bilateral, widespread pressure hypersensitivity in women presenting with myofascial TMD, suggesting that widespread central sensitization is involved in myofascial TMD women. PERSPECTIVE: This article reveals the presence of bilateral and widespread pressure-pain hypersensitivity in women with myofascial TMD, suggesting that widespread central sensitization is involved in myofascial TMD. This finding has implications for development of management strategies.",M1
19492539,"Association of sense of coherence and clinical signs of temporomandibular disorders.AIMS: To investigate the association of sense of coherence (SOC) with clinical findings of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) among 30- to 64-year-old subjects. METHODS: A nationally representative health examination survey called the Health 2000 Survey was carried out from 2000 to 2001. The data for this study were obtained from 4859 subjects aged 30 to 64 years who had participated in an interview, been clinically examined, and returned a self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire included a SOC scale which was a 12-item version of the SOC-13 scale. Based on a clinical examination for TMD, the following variables were formed: maximum interincisal distance &lt;40 mm, clicking, crepitation, pain in the temporomandibular joints (<e>TMJs</e>), and pain in the masticatory muscles. Odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were estimated using logistic regression models. RESULTS: Subjects with low SOC had higher odds to have distinct TMD findings, especially masticatory muscle pain, than those with high SOC. After adjustment for confounders, those with low SOC had more than twofold odds to have masticatory muscle pain (in at least one painful site) compared to those with high SOC (OR 2.2, 95% CI 1.4-3.6). Low SOC was also associated with TMJ pain on palpation (OR 3.2, 95% CI 1.5-6.6). CONCLUSION: Low SOC associates with myogenous TMD findings. SOC as a psychosocial aspect has a role in the background of TMD.",M1
19207446,"Psychosocial profiles of painful TMD patients.The aim of the present investigation is to test the null hypothesis that the presence of psychopathology in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is related to the presence of pain, independent of its location [(i.e. myofascial and/or temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pain]. Ninety-six (n = 96) patients affected by painful TMD underwent a clinical assessment in accordance with the research diagnostic criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) guidelines and filled out the Symptoms Check List - Revised (SCL-90-R) instrument to investigate the presence of symptoms of psychopathology. Patients with myofascial pain, alone or combined with TMJ pain, endorsed the highest scores in all SCL-90-R scales and showed the highest percentage of abnormal values in the depression (DEP) and somatization (SOM) scales for the assessment of depressive and somatization symptoms. Nonetheless, anova revealed no significant differences between groups in any of the SCL-90-R scales, except than in the Positive Symptom Total Index (F = 3.463; P = 0.035), and the chi-squared test did not detect any significant differences between groups for the prevalence of abnormal scores in the DEP and SOM scales. The existence of a close association between pain and psychosocial disorders in TMD patients was supported by the present study. The null hypothesis is that no differences exist between patients with different painful TMD cannot be fully accepted for the presence of psychosocial disorders because of the trend evidencing higher SCL-90-R scores for myofascial pain patients, alone or combined with TMJ pain, with respect to TMJ pain alone.",M1
19162287,"[Massage of the lateral pterygoid muscle in acute <e>TMJ</e> dysfunction syndrome]INTRODUCTION: Massage of the lateral pterygoid muscle according to Cyriax's principles is an unrecognized procedure. This procedure was tried on patients presenting with temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen patients were treated. Pain, joint clicking, measurement of mouth opening, lateral excursion and propulsion were recorded. Assessment was made before and after the massage in the same consultation. RESULTS: Joint clicking was solved in 80% and pain in 50% of the cases. Mouth opening increased by 12.8%, propulsion by 11.6% and lateral excursion by 41.3%. DISCUSSION: Massage of the lateral pterygoid muscle according to Cyriax's principles is a simple and efficient method that can be recommended for patients presenting with temporomandibular joint dysfunction syndrome. We performed a brief anatomical and radiological MRI study supporting the feasibility of lateral pterygoid muscle palpation.",M1
18990679,"Surface electromyographic patterns of masticatory, neck, and trunk muscles in temporomandibular joint dysfunction patients undergoing anterior repositioning splint therapy.The aim of this study was to investigate the surface electromyographic (sEMG) activity of neck, trunk, and masticatory muscles in subjects with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) internal derangement treated with anterior mandibular repositioning splints. sEMG activities of the muscles in 34 adult subjects (22 females and 12 males; mean age 30.4 years) with TMJ internal derangement were compared with a control group of 34 untreated adults (20 females and 14 males; mean age 31.8 years). sEMG activities of seven muscles (anterior and posterior temporalis, masseter, posterior cervicals, sternocleidomastoid, and upper and lower trapezius) were studied bilaterally, with the mandible in the rest position and during maximal voluntary clenching (MVC), at the beginning of therapy (T0) and after 10 weeks of treatment (T1). Paired and Student's t-tests were undertaken to determine differences between the T0 and T1 data and in sEMG activity between the study and control groups. At T0, paired masseter, sternocleidomastoid, and cervical muscles, in addition to the left anterior temporal and right lower trapezius, showed significantly greater sEMG activity (P = 0.0001; P = 0.0001; for left cervical, P = 0.03; for right cervical, P = 0.0001; P = 0.006 and P = 0.007 muscles, respectively) compared with the control group. This decreased over the remaining study period, such that after treatment, sEMG activity revealed no statistically significant difference when compared with the control group. During MVC at T0, paired masseter and anterior and posterior temporalis muscles showed significantly lower sEMG activity (P = 0.03; P = 0.005 and P = 0.04, respectively) compared with the control group. In contrast, at T1 sEMG activity significantly increased (P = 0.02; P = 0.004 and P = 0.04, respectively), but no difference was observed in relation to the control group. Splint therapy in subjects with internal disk derangement seems to affect sEMG activity of the masticatory, neck, and trunk muscles.",M1
18946571,"Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation of temporomandibular joint derangement in symptomatic and asymptomatic patients.OBJECTIVE: To highlight the importance of MRI in evaluation of the tempromandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>). METHODS: The MRI examination was performed at King Khalid University Hospital, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia with the approval from the local ethics committee, on 34 patients (68 joints) between January 2006 and November 2007, in which 10 were considered asymptomatic subjects (control). The remaining had symptoms and signs of TMJ pain or dysfunction, including limitation of movement and clicking. All our subjects were examined in both closed and open mouth position. Images were obtained by 1.5-T MRI system, in oblique sagittal plane utilizing 3 pulse sequences including T1 and T2 spin-echo, and spoiled gradient recall sequences. The evaluation of the meniscal disc configuration and position was carried out by 2 radiologists. RESULTS: Sixteen out of 20 joints of asymptomatic subjects were normal. In the other 2 asymptomatic subjects, the MRI showed anterior disc displacement with reduction in 3 joints, and degenerative changes in 2 joints. Out of the 48 symptomatic joints, 26 (45%) joints were considered normal, while the other 22 joints showed anterior dislocation without reduction. Degenerative joint disease was also seen in 18 joints. CONCLUSION: The MRI with the use of surface coils markedly improves the delineation of internal derangement of the TMJ, therefore, it enhanced the capability of detecting certain abnormalities, which proved to have a statistical significance in symptomatic patients.",M1
18835127,"[Delayed diagnosis of a postanaesthesia temporomandibular joint dislocation]Temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) dislocation during anaesthesia is a rare occurrence. Patients with a history of prior dislocations or TMJ dysfunction, and patients with mandibular retrognathism are at risk of this complication. This is a case report of delayed diagnosis of TMJ dislocation after a general anaesthesia for aortic valvular replacement surgery in a predisposed patient. Considering this unusual presentation, TMJ evaluation should be performed during preoperative anaesthetic assessment. In at-risk patients, one should not worry about TMJ dislocation during intubation but concentrate on glottic exposure. However, afterwards, one should be highly aware of this possible complication in order to detect it early, allowing an immediate simple manual reduction. This manoeuver may be performed with or without sedation by a practitioner, familiar with this way of resetting a dislocated jaw.",M1
18830934,"Expression of ADAMTS-5 in deformed human temporomandibular joint discs.OBJECTIVE: To study the expression of a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs 5 (ADAMTS-5) in tissue samples of deformed human temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) discs and cells obtained from the discs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven adult human TMJ discs (nine diseased discs and two normal discs) were used in this study. The nine diseased discs were obtained from nine patients with internal derangement (ID) and osteoarthritis (OA) in the TMJ. These patients all had anteriorly displaced discs and deformed mandibular condyles, making conservative therapy impossible. The tissues were immunohistochemically stained using ADAMTS-5 antibodies. In addition, an articular disc cell line from one case was established by collagenase treatment. The subcultured cells under both normal and hypoxic conditions (O2: 2%) were incubated for 3, 6, 12 and 24 h after addition of interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) (1 ng/mL). Subsequently, the expression of ADAMTS-5 was examined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: The control group showed negative reactions on immunohistochemical staining. The discs extracted from cases with ID and OA presented positive reactions for ADAMTS-5. The expression of ADAMTS-5 mRNA increased under both normoxia and hypoxia with the addition of IL-1beta, and the peak was observed after 3 h. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that ADAMTS-5 is related to deformation and destruction of human TMJ discs affected by ID and OA.",M1
18797094,"Soft occlusal splint therapy in the management of myofascial pain dysfunction syndrome: a follow-up study.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Myofascial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome (MPDS) has been recognized as the most common, nontooth-related chronic orofacial pain condition that confronts dentists. A variety of therapies has been described in literature for its management. The present study is a prospective study carried out to evaluate the efficacy of occlusal splint therapy and compare it with pharmacotherapy (using analgesics and muscle relaxants) in the management of Myofascial Pain Dysfunction Syndrome. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients in the age range of 17-55 years were included in the study and randomly assigned to one of two equally sized groups, A and B. Group A patients received a combination of muscle relaxants and analgesics while Group B patients received soft occlusal splint therapy. All the patients were evaluated for GPI, VAS, maximum comfortable mouth opening, <e>TMJ</e> clicking and tenderness during rest and movement as well as for the number of tender muscles at the time of diagnosis, after the 1 st week of initiation of therapy and every month for three months of follow-up. RESULTS: There was a progressive decrease in GPI scores, number of tender muscles, TMJ clicking and tenderness with various jaw movements and significant improvement in mouth opening in patients on occlusal splint therapy during the follow-up period as compared to the pharmacotherapy group. CONCLUSION: Occlusal splint therapy has better long-term results in reducing the symptoms of MPDS. It has better patient compliance, fewer side effects, and is more cost-effective than pharmacotherapy; hence, it can be chosen for the treatment of patients with MPDS.",M1
18717084,"Relationship between the frequency of sleep bruxism and the prevalence of signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders in an adolescent population.PURPOSE: The relationship between sleep bruxism (SB) and temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is unclear. This study aimed to estimate SB prevalence in an adolescent population and to investigate the relationship between SB frequency and prevalence of TMD signs/symptoms. MATERIALS AND METHODS: First-year students at a high school in Okayama, Japan, were recruited in 2005, with 195 subjects responding. The SB detection device was a miniature disposable device (BiteStrip, SLP) that indicated the total SB events per night on a 4-grade score. The subjects were divided into severe and nonsevere SB groups with SB frequency cutoffs. The subjects were examined for temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) noise during mouth opening/closing, tenderness of the masticatory/cervical muscles, and range of TMJ condylar movement. The presence/absence of headache and shoulder stiffness was also determined by the interview. The odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval (CI) were calculated to test the relationship between SB frequency, gender difference, and presence of the TMD signs/symptoms by multiple regression analysis. RESULTS: Severe SB (more than 125 events per night) was significantly related to the presence of TMJ clicking (OR: 3.74, CI: 1.22-11.49, P = .02), while gender (male) was not related to the presence of TMJ clicking. Severe SB was not related to headache, though gender (male) was significantly related to headache (OR: 2.52, Cl: 1.04-6.11, P= .04) in these subjects. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the presence of TMJ clicking was closely related to severe SB in an adolescent population.",M1
18583095,"Operative versus simple arthroscopic surgery for chronic closed lock of the temporomandibular joint: a clinical study of 344 arthroscopic procedures.Arthroscopic surgery has been reported to decrease pain in relation to the <e>TMJ</e>, improving maximal interincisal opening (MIO). The aim of the present study was to report the clinical outcome of arthroscopic surgery for the treatment of chronic closed lock (CCL) of the TMJ. Five hundred consecutive patients (670 joints) with TMJ derangement who underwent arthroscopy between 1995 and 2004 were retrospectively analysed. All were classified as II-V according to Wilkes. Within the series, various arthroscopic procedures were performed. The inclusion criteria for CCL of the TMJ were met by 257 patients (344 joints). The mean age was 30.24 years; 237 (92%) were female and 20 (8%) male. Mean preoperative visual analogue scale score for evaluation of TMJ pain was 53.21+/-23.02. Mean MIO was 24.75+/-4.89 mm. Following arthroscopy, a significant decrease in TMJ pain was achieved (p&lt;0.0001). For MIO, mandibular protrusion and lateral excursion movements, a significant increase in mean values was observed following surgery (p&lt;0.0001). No statistical differences were observed between arthroscopic lysis and lavage and operative arthroscopy in relation to postoperative pain or MIO at any stage of the follow-up period. Arthroscopy should be considered as a first-line treatment for CCL of the TMJ.",M1
18540516,"Treatment of temporomandibular disorders with a combination of hard acrylic stabilisation appliance and a soft appliance in the opposing jaw. A retro- and prospective study.The aim of this study was to evaluate the treatment effect of a combined treatment with a stabilisation appliance and a soft appliance in the opposing jaw in patients refractory to previous TMD treatment. During a 5-year-period, 2001-2005, a total of 98 patients received the combined treatment at the Department of Stomatognathic Physiology, the Institute for Postgraduate Dental Education, Jönköping, Sweden. Before the patients received the combined treatment, they had already been given several different TMD treatments during a long period of time, either before referral or at the specialist clinic, with only minor or no effect on their TMD symptoms. The patients were followed prospectively (n=10), or analysed retrospectively (n=88). The data registered were gender, age, main indication for TMD treatment, number of visits to the clinic before and after the introduction of the combined treatment, as well as according to a clinical (Di) and anamnestic (Ai) dysfunction index. The most common causes for treatment in the retrospective material were problems of muscular origin and problems of both muscular and <e>TMJ</e> origin. In the prospective material, most of the patients had mainly muscular symptoms. Both the clinical and anamnestic dysfunction index decreased statistically significantly in the retrospective material after the introduction of the combined treatment. There was a numerical improvement of both indices also in the prospective material. In conclusion, the present investigation showed that a combined treatment with a hard acrylic stabilisation appliance and a soft appliance in the opposing jaw seems to give a remarkable improvement of TMD signs and symptoms in apparently therapy resistant TMD patients. General conclusions should, however, be made with caution due to the fact that the study did not include any control group. There is an obvious need for randomized controlled studies concerning the efficacy and effectiveness of the combined treatment presented in this study.",M1
18314857,"Psychopathology and clinical features in an Italian sample of patients with myofascial and temporomandibular joint pain: preliminary data.OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to provide data on the relationships between psychopathological variables and temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Sixty-three TMD patients were investigated using clinical and anamnestical psychiatric informations and psychopathological measures. METHODS: Three groups of TMD patients were recruited according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD guidelines: a group of patients presenting myofascial pain alone (RDC/TMD axis I group I), a group with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pain alone (RDC/TMD axis I group IIIa, IIIb), and a group presenting both myofascial and TMJ pain. Two secondary groups were identified on the basis of the presence/absence of myofascial pain. The study design provided a psychiatric interview and psychometric assessment including the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HARS). RESULTS: --Psychiatric evaluation: Myofascial pain patients had higher scores for personal psychiatric history and a history of more frequent psychotropic drug use. --HDRS and HARS: The sample presented scores indicating mild depressive symptoms and moderate anxiety symptoms. --SCL-90-R: The global sample showed acute levels of psychological distress as measured by the GSI score (Global Severity Index). Myofascial pain patients scored higher than TMJ pain patients in the GSI (p = .028), PAR (paranoia; p = .015), PSY (psychoticism; p = .032), and HOS (hostility; p = .034) subscales. CONCLUSIONS: TMD patients showed elevated levels of depression, somatization, and anxiety. These characteristics did not differ significantly between patients with myofascial or TMJ pain. Other specific psychopathological dimensions, detected with SCL-90-R, appeared to be closely associated to the myofascial component.",M1
18254795,"Diagnostic sub-types, psychological distress and psychosocial dysfunction in southern Chinese people with temporomandibular disorders.The study aimed to assess the distribution of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) sub-types, psychological distress and psychosocial dysfunction in southern Chinese people seeking treatment for TMD using Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD) and investigate potential cross-cultural differences in sub-type prevalence and psychosocial impact. Eighty-seven consecutive patients (77 females; 10 males) with a mean age of 39.3 years (s.d. 12.8) newly referred to the specialist TMD clinic at the Prince Philip Dental Hospital, Hong Kong over a 20-month period took part in the study. RDC/TMD history questionnaire and clinical assessment data were used to derive Axis I and II findings. Group I muscle disorders were the most common and found in 57.5% of patients. Group II (disc displacement) disorders were found in 42.5% and 47.1% of the right and left temporomandibular joints (<e>TMJ</e>) respectively. Group III disorders (arthralgia/arthrosis/arthritis) were revealed in 19.5% and 23.0% of right and left TMJ's respectively. In the Axis II assessment, 42.5% of patients had moderate/severe depression scores, 59.7% had moderate/severe somatization scores and based on graded chronic pain scores 15.0% had psychosocial dysfunction (grade III and IV). While acknowledging the small sample size, the distribution of RDC/TMD Axis I and II diagnoses was fairly similar in Chinese TMD patients compared with Western and other Asian patient groups. However, in Chinese patients, myofascial pain with limited jaw opening and TMJ disc displacement with reduction were more common and a significant number experienced psychological distress and psychosocial dysfunction. The findings have implications for the management of TMD in Chinese people.",M1

Biochemical studies of blood revealed the more marked lowering of the level of histamin, adrenalin, cortizol in blood serum of patients after the treatment of alternative methods than after pharmaco- and physiotherapy. the high informative level of the studying of ATPh, histamin, kortisol of blood's serum for diagnostics and evaluation of the efficiency of treatment of the pain disfunction of temporomandibular joint syndrome was proved.",M1
17977563,"Involvement of peripheral TRPV1 in <e>TMJ</e> hyperalgesia induced by ethanol withdrawal.Ethanol withdrawal increases nociception after the injection of formalin into the rat's temporomandibular joint (TMJ). Little is known about the neurological basis for hyperalgesia induced by ethanol withdrawal, but it has been reported that ethanol can potentiate the response of transient receptor potential vanilloid receptor-1 (TRPV1) in superficial tissues. The present study was designed to test the hypothesis that peripheral TRPV1 could be involved on nociceptive behavioral responses induced by the injection of formalin into the TMJ region of rats exposed to chronic ethanol administration and ethanol withdrawal. Behavioral hyperalgesia was verified 12 h after ethanol withdrawal in rats that drank an ethanol solution (6.5%) for 10 days. In another group submitted to the same ethanol regimen, the selective vanilloid receptor antagonist capsazepine (300, 600 or 1200 microg/25 microl) or an equal volume of vehicle were injected into the TMJ regions 30 min before the TMJ formalin test. The local injections of capsazepine reduced the increased nociceptive responses induced by ethanol withdrawal. The effect of capsazepine on rats that did not drink ethanol was not significant. These results indicate that the peripheral TRPV1 can contribute to the hyperalgesia induced by ethanol withdrawal on deep pain conditions.",M1
17670875,"Delayed temporomandibular joint pain and dysfunction induced by whiplash trauma: a controlled prospective study.BACKGROUND: The Quebec Task Force on Whiplash-Associated Disorders urged for controlled, prognostic studies of symptoms after whiplash trauma. The authors conducted a study that met the design requirements to enhance knowledge about short-term and long-term temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pain, dysfunction or both induced by whiplash trauma. METHODS: The authors studied 60 consecutive patients who had neck symptoms after whiplash trauma and were seen at a hospital emergency department. They followed up 59 subjects one full year later. At the inceptive examination and at follow-up, each subject completed a self-administered questionnaire, followed by a comprehensive interview. Fifty-three frequency-matched control subjects followed the same protocol concurrently. RESULTS: The incidence of new symptoms of TMJ pain, dysfunction or both between the inceptive examination and follow-up was five times higher in subjects (34 percent) than in control subjects (7 percent). The frequency of TMJ pain increased significantly in female subjects, as did the frequency of TMJ symptoms that were reported to be the main complaint. At the follow-up, 20 percent of all subjects reported that TMJ symptoms were their main complaint. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that one in three people who are exposed to whiplash trauma is at risk of developing delayed TMJ symptoms that may require clinical management. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Awareness of a significant risk for delayed onset of TMJ symptoms after whiplash trauma is crucial for making adequate diagnoses, prognoses and medicolegal decisions.",M1
17547122,"Prevalence and impact of post-traumatic stress disorder symptoms in patients with masticatory muscle or temporomandibular joint pain: differences and similarities.AIMS: To evaluate temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients for differences between masticatory muscle (MM) and temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pain patients in the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms and evaluate the level of psychological dysfunction and its relationship to PTSD symptoms in these patients. METHODS: This study included 445 patients. Psychological questionnaires included the Symptom Check List-90-Revised (SCL-90-R), the Multidimensional Pain Inventory, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the PTSD Check List Civilian. The total sample of patients was divided into 2 major groups: the MM group (n = 242) and the TMJ group (n = 203). Each group was divided into 3 subgroups based on the presence of a stressor and severity of PTSD symptoms. RESULTS: Thirty-six patients (14.9%) in the MM group and 20 patients (9.9%) in the TMJ group presented with PTSD symptomatology (P = .112). Significant differences were found between the MM and the TMJ group in several psychometric domains, but when the presence of PTSD symptomatology was considered, significant differences were mostly maintained in the subgroups without PTSD. MM and TMJ pain patients in the  positive PTSD  subgroups scored higher on all SCL-90-R scales (P &lt; .001) than patients in the other 2 subgroups and reached levels of distress indicative of psychological dysfunction. TMJ pain patients (58.3%; P = .008) in the positive-PTSD subgroups were more often classified as dysfunctional. Both positive-PTSD subgrounps of the MM and TMJ groups presented with more sleep disturbance (P &lt; .005) than patients in the other 2 subgroups. CONCLUSION: A somewhat elevated prevalence rate for PTSD symptomatology was found in the MM group compared to the TMJ group. Significant levels of psychological dysfunction appeared to be linked to TMD patients with PTSD symptoms.",M1

17321048,"Blockade of central cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways enhances the cannabinoid-induced antinociceptive effects on inflammatory temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) nociception.The present study is the first to investigate the participation of central cyclooxygenase (COX) pathways in modulating the antinociceptive effects of intracisternally administered cannabinoid on nociception induced by inflammation of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) in freely moving rats. Following intra-articular injection of 5% formalin in the TMJ, nociceptive scratching behavior was recorded for nine successive 5-min intervals in Sprague-Dawley rats. Intracisternal injection of 30 microg of WIN 55,212-2, a synthetic non-subtype-selective CB1/2 agonist, administered 20 min prior to formalin injection significantly reduced the number of scratches and duration of scratching induced by formalin compared with the vehicle-treated group. Antinociceptive effect of WIN 55,212-2 was blocked by intracisternal injection of 10 microg of AM251, a CB1 receptor-selective antagonist, but not by AM630, a CB2 receptor-selective antagonist. A 10 microg dose of WIN 55,212-2 that was ineffective in producing antinociception became effective following intracisternal administration of NS-398, a selective COX-2 inhibitor; indomethacin, a non-selective COX 1/2 inhibitor; acetaminophen, a putative COX-3 inhibitor, but not following pretreatment with the selective COX-1 inhibitor, SC-560. The ED(50) value of WIN 55,212-2 in the NS-398-treated group was significantly lower than that in the vehicle-treated group. Importantly, administration of low doses of COX inhibitors alone did not attenuate nociception. These results indicate that inhibition of central COX pathways, presumably via COX-2 inhibition, reduces inflammatory pain by enhancing the cannabinoid-induced antinociceptive effect. Based on our observations, combined administration of cannabinoids with COX inhibitors may hold a therapeutic promise in the treatment of inflammatory TMJ pain.",M1
17240935,"The four dimensions of orthodontic diagnosis--Part II.There are three traditional dimensions of orthodontic diagnosis--transverse, vertical, and anterior-posterior of the maxilla and mandible. However, there is a  fourth dimension --proper condylar position. The condyles, at the other end of the teeth, can be influenced by orthodontic treatment. The chief problem in 90% of my patients referred for <e>TMJ</e> dysfunction is posteriorly and/or superiorly displaced condyles. Whether these patients have had a problem for 2 months or 10-20 years, most of them will have major relief (50-70%) of their symptoms within 2 weeks to 2 months. They frequently report 50-70% relief of their symptoms. This is accomplished by placing the condyles in the proper position in the glenoid fossae with an appliance worn full time. This article will discuss how to determine proper condylar position and the construction of a mandibular appliance (VG) to correctly reposition the condyles in the glenoid fossae. After 3-4 months, when symptoms are relieved, an upper inclined biteplane appliance (VMI) is added for nighttime wear and the lower appliance is  shortened  to allow eruption of posterior teeth. Spacers are used to encourage eruption of posterior teeth. Several patient examples are included and the results achieved are written in the patients own words on a progress report form.",M1
17039910,"[The prevalence of craniomandibular disorders in the military population of the Republic of Serbia]INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of craniomandibular dysfunction (CMD) in the military personnel of the Republic of Serbia, as well as the distribution of sings and symptoms of CMD in this population group. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The epidemiological investigation included 284 male persons between 18 - 25 years of age. The sample consisted of Military Academy students, and soldiers from different regions of the Republic of Serbia. A questionnaire was designed using Helkimo's clinical dysfunction index and sings and symptoms of CMD were evaluated, namely the anamnestic index (Ai) and the dysfunction index (Di). RESULTS: According to the anamnestic dysfunction index (Ai), 85% of persons among the examined group presented without any symptoms of CMD (Ai = 0), 14% had mild symptoms (Ai =1) and 1% had severe symptoms of CMD (Ai = 5). Functional analysis of the orofacial system in the examined group (evaluation of dysfunction index - Di) revealed, however, that 70% of solders had at least one sign of CMD, precisely a dysfunction index Di &gt; 0. The analysis of signs and symptoms of CMD revealed that disturbances in mandibular kinematics were the most prevalent sign of CMD in this population group, which was confirmed in 56% of examined persons. Disturbed functions of temporomandibular (TM) joints (click, and reciprocal click, deviation and deflection during mandibular opening) were established in 31% of examined persons, and sensitivity of TM joints and masticatory muscles during palpation in 4% of examined persons. Pain during mandibular movements was established only in 1% of examined persons. CONCLUSION: The results of this investigation point to significant prevalence of craniomandibular disorders in the examined population group. The incidence of <e>TMJ</e> and masticatory muscle pain in 4% of examined persons and of pain during mandibular movements only in 1% of examined persons, points to presence of mild or initial types of CMD in this population group.",M1
16957793,"Prevalence, intensity, and correlation of different <e>TMJ</e> symptoms in Lebanese and Italian subpopulations.AIM: The aim of this study was to compare self reported joint related temporomandibular disorder (TMD) symptoms in Lebanese and Italian dental and non-dental students and to detect any correlation between different symptoms. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A questionnaire was distributed in Sardinia (Italy) to dental and psychology students and in Lebanon to dental, physical therapy, and biology students to investigate the prevalence, intensity, and correlation of four temporomandibular joint (TMJ) symptoms. RESULTS: Prevalence of earache varied among the groups from 10.1% to 29.2%, ear stuffiness from 22.5% to 30.8%, TMJ pain from 13.2% to 21.2%, and TMJ sounds from 18.4% to 46.2%. DISCUSSION: Different prevalence and intensity of earache and TMJ sounds were found in the examined sub-populations diverse in cultural background and education. However, prevalence and intensity of ear stuffiness and TMJ pain were similar. Association between TMJ sounds and TMJ pain was detected in selected sub-populations, and correlation between one symptom on one side of the head with the same symptom on the contralateral side were noted suggesting most of these symptoms are bilateral. CONCLUSION: The results of the study might be useful to anticipate the possible occurrence of associated symptoms or the same symptom on both sides of the head. Correlations with cultural background and education are difficult to establish.",M1

16932932,"[Arthrocentesis--a highly efficient therapy for acute <e>TMJ</e> arthropathy]PURPOSE: This clinical study deals with the efficiency of arthrocentesis in acute arthropathy of the temporomandibular joint (TMJ). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In total 142 patients (41.5 years average) were included in the examination. Inclusion criteria were a restriction of mouth opening &lt;40 mm and/or TMJ pain &gt;3 on a visual analog scale (VAS). The first examination took place the day before surgery; follow-up was performed 1 day and 4 weeks after arthrocentesis. Study parameters were active mouth opening, TMJ pain on preauricular or intra-auricular palpation, myalgia of the temporalis or masseter muscle, and a deviation clicking or crepitation during mouth opening. Arthrocentesis was performed in all patients under general anesthesia by a double puncture, continuous rinsing technique in an inferolateral approach as recommended by Murakami. The upper temporomandibular joint space was rinsed with 250 ml of a physiological sterile saline solution and a pressure of 200 mmHg. RESULTS: Arthrocentesis resulted in a highly significant increase of mouth opening and a highly significant reduction of TMJ pain on palpation (p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: It can be postulated that TMJ arthrocentesis represents a highly efficient therapy of acute TMJ arthropathy. Whether the results have to be judged as a palliative short-time therapy or if even long-term results can be achieved has to be proved by long-term follow-up studies.",M1
16708831,"The reliability and validity of self-reported temporomandibular disorder pain in adolescents.AIMS: To evaluate the reliability and validity of self-reported pain associated with temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in adolescents and to determine how this validity may change over time. The authors' hypothesis was that self-reported pain can be used to reliably and accurately detect adolescents with TMD pain. METHODS: One hundred twenty adolescents, 60 with self-reported TMD pain and 60 age- and gender-matched controls without TMD pain, were examined twice. At the first examination at a Public Dental Service clinic, self-reported TMD pain was recorded for each patient. At the second examination, a clinical examination was completed, blind to the patients' self-report of pain symptoms, after which self-reported TMD pain was again recorded. The clinical examination was based upon the Research Diagnostic Criteria for TMD (RDC/TMD). Self-reported TMD pain in this investigation was based upon the subjects' responses to 2 questions: (1) Do you have pain in your temples, face, temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>), or jaws once a week or more? and (2) Do you have pain when you open your mouth wide or chew once a week or more? RESULTS: Test-retest reliability of .83 (kappa) was found for the 2 questions. The sensitivity was .98 (95% CI, .90 to 1.0) and specificity was .90 (95% CI, .81 to .95) for comparison of assessments made on the same day. Sensitivity was .96 (95% CI, .85 to .99) and specificity .83 (95% CI, .72 to .90) for assessments made 2 to 4 weeks apart. CONCLUSION: Very good reliability and high validity were found for the self-reported pain questions. A short time interval between the screening question and examination slightly increased the accuracy of the measure. In adolescent populations, the questions in this study can be used to screen for TMD pain.",M1

16340272,"Oral parafunctions and positive clinical examination findings.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Oral parafunctional activity can be fatigued and painful masticatory muscles and/or pain in the temporomandibular joints. There is controversial discussion in the literature as to what role parafunctional activity plays in the multi-causal pathologic process. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to determine any association between the level of parafunctional habits versus the level of mandibular dysfunction and to test the hypothesis that TMD/bruxer patients have significantly increased muscle tension and joint pain. MATERIAL AND METHODS: There were 307 subjects (140 males und 167 females) selected for this investigation. 299 subjects were examined regarding any relationships between clenching and the incidence of muscle sensitivity. The age of subjects ranged from 20 to 54 years old, with a mean age of 35.4. 114 subjects had at least one sign of temporomandibular disorders (tenderness/pain on palpation of the joints or muscles, <e>TMJ</e> sounds, pain or deviation during maximum mouth opening (active/passive). RESULTS: 81 subjects admitted to clenching, while 218 said they did not. Among the  non-clenchers , 68.8% had no sensitive muscles, 31.2% indicated sensitive masticatory muscles. Those who clenched their teeth were distributed as follows: 53.1% were diagnosed with bilateral masticatory muscle sensitivity, 46.9% showed no such indications. The two groups were not homogeneously divided, with regard to pain/discomfort (p = 0.001; Fisher's precision test). CONCLUSION: This study found a statistically solid relationship between the incidence of  clenching  and muscle palpation findings, as well as between sensitivity in the mandibular joints from lateral and to cranial and dorsal with positive muscle palpation findings. The agreement between sensitivity of the masticatory musculature and the mandibular joint demonstrates that intensive clenching can predominantly lead to pathologic phenomena in the muscles or joints.",M1
16320863,"Chiropractic treatment of temporomandibular disorders using the activator adjusting instrument and protocol.OBJECTIVE: To describe the chiropractic management of a 30-year-old woman with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pain and to discuss the general etiology and management of TMJ conditions. CLINICAL FEATURES: The patient suffered from daily unremitting jaw pain for 7 years, which was the apparent sequela of a series of 8 root canals on the same tooth. Pain radiated from her TMJ into her shoulder and was accompanied by headache, tinnitus, decreased hearing, and a feeling of congestion in her right ear. Symptoms were not reduced by medication or other dental treatments. OUTCOME AND INTERVENTION: The patient underwent a series of chiropractic treatments using the instrument and protocol of Activator Methods, International. During the first 5 months, her VAS rating of jaw pain decreased from 60 (on a scale of 0 to 100) to 9, her ability to eat solid foods increased, headache intensity and frequency diminished, and her maximum mouth opening without pain measurement increased from 22 to 28 mm. Overall, 20 months of chiropractic treatment along with 2 concurrent months of massage therapy yielded slow but continual progress that finally resulted in total resolution of all symptoms except some fullness of the right cheek. CONCLUSION: Use of the Activator Methods protocol of chiropractic treatment was beneficial for this patient and merits further study in similar cases.",M1
16128354,"An electromyographic study of masseter and anterior temporalis muscles in extra-articular myogenous <e>TMJ</e> pain patients compared to an asymptomatic and normal population.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of the therapy with a centric relation stabilization appliance (CRSA) in patients with temporomandibular disorders of myogenous origin by electromyography and compare the results with two asymptomatic control groups. Three groups of 20 patients each were selected for the study. Electromyography (EMG) of masseter and anterior temporalis muscles was performed during mandibular rest position. In the treated group, the occlusal appliance reduced the electrical activity of the analyzed muscles at right and left sides (p&lt;0.0001), and equilibrated muscular activity between right and left sides (p&lt;0.0001), reaching values close to the control groups. Although there was not a statistically significant difference, the normal control group presented lower EMG values than control group II and presented the lowest asymmetry index of all subjects. More than 85% of all subjects, including the controls, demonstrated a statistically significant temporal anterior activity prevalence (p&lt;0.0001). Treatment with the CRSA reduced the activity index, although the prevalence of the temporal muscle over the masseter was maintained. The significant laterodeviating (torque) effect found in the temporomandibular disorder patients was reduced after treatment. No side prevalence was found in the control groups.",M1
16102077,"Flexure deformation in temporomandibular joint disk displacement without reduction may predict treatment outcome.To identify whether the direction of disk flexure deformation predicts the prognosis in cases of anterior disk displacement without reduction of painful temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>), the relationship between the direction of flexure, observed on pseudodynamic magnetic resonance (MR) images, and the outcome of conservative treatment using a flat occlusal splint was analysed in 40 female patients who perceived occasional or constant pain at unilateral TMJ with disk displacement without reduction. From the MR findings, 20 patients were classified as having upward flexure deformation of the disk and 20 as having downward flexure deformation. Patients' TMJ pain, masticatory muscle pain, amount of maximal mouth opening, and MR findings were evaluated before treatment. All patients were treated with a flat occlusal splint for 6 months. The patients' signs and symptoms were analysed statistically within each group before treatment and 3 and 6 months afterwards, and were also compared between the upward and downward flexure groups. There was no statistical difference between the groups before treatment, except in the amount of maximal mouth opening and the extent of disk displacement. The upward flexure group had persistent TMJ pain and tendency of delayed alleviation of masticatory muscle pain compared with the downward flexure group, although maximal opening gradually increased in both groups. Thus, the direction of the flexure in deformation of the disk, which can be observed only with pseudodynamic MR imaging, may predict the prognosis of painful disk displacement without reduction following treatment with a flat occlusal splint.",M1

We present a 23-year-old woman with long-standing TMJ dysfunction and restricted interincisal opening, who developed a progressive zygomatic asymmetry. The patient underwent treatment by intraoral coronoidectomy and homolateral TMJ arthroscopy in the same surgery. The histopathological diagnosis of the coronoid sample was cartilage-capped exostoses with presence of articular fibrous cartilage. Although the low prevalence of this entity, it should be considered as a possible diagnosis in patients with progressive limitation of mouth opening, although a TMJ syndrome may be present as a cause of this entity.",M1
15600196,"[The long term stability after orthognathic surgery in prognathic patients with mandibular asymmetry]OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to evaluate the skeletal stability after mandibular osteotomy, the effect of the two-fixation method used (unilateral plate versus bilateral plates), the influence of condylar bony change, and the relationship between the magnitude of setback and the relapse. METHODS: Twenty-three patients who have mandibular prognathism with asymmetry were selected from a pool of orthodontic patients at the Department of Orthodontics, Niigata University Dental Hospital. To evaluate the stability after surgery, the lateral and frontal cephalograms taken just before surgery (T1), just after surgery (T2), and retention time (long term postoperatively, &gt;6 months) (T3) were used. RESULTS: In general, the long-term post-operative stability term was satisfied. <e>TMJ</e> symptom was relieved after surgery. The The long-term relapse tendency was larger in those patients who had pre-operative condylar bony change. From our data, there was no significant difference about the long-term change due to post-operative skeletal relapse between bilateral SSRO cases and USSRO+IVRO cases. There was no correlation between the magnitude of setback and the long-term post-operative relapse. CONCLUSION: It was suggested that even if condylar bony change existed before surgery, the patient could receive mandibular osteotomy and enjoy a good post-operative stability. Condylar bony change might be one of the risk factors for the stability after mandibular osteotomy in prognathic patients with mandibular asymmetry. The type of mandibular osteotomy, the fixation of mandibular and the amount of setback might have no relationship with the postoperative relapse in prognathism with mandibular deviation.",M1
15503982,"[Efficacy of treatment with hard and soft occlusal appliance in TMD]Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) include clinical disorders involving the masticatory muscles, the temporomandibular joints (<e>TMJ</e>) and the adjacent structures. TMD was recognized as a main source for pains in the orofacial area, which are not caused from dental origin, and is defined by the American Academy of Orofascial Pain (AAOP) as a sub-group within the frame of musculoskeletal disorders. The main etiology for TMD has not been found yet. The customary treatments for this disorder include treatment with occlusal splints, physiotherapy, medicaments, behavioral-cognitive treatment, hypnosis, acupuncture and surgery that should be considered only if all conservative treatments were unsuccessful. Occlusal splint is the most common and efficient treatment for TMD patients proved by many studies with a successful rate of 70-90%. The following article reviews the different opinions in the treatment of TMD with special attention to hard and soft occlusal appliances. Based upon much research, and despite the many disagreements regarding its efficacy, the hard splint is a customary application which has the most successful outcome in patients who suffer from functional disorders of the masticatory system. The stabilization splint has an important benefit for being a non-penetrating and reversible appliance. However, despite this, the dentist should evaluate the joint or muscular problem, and seriously consider the various available treatments before deciding to use the appliance as a means of treatment.",M1
15452812,"Advantages of intraoral verticosagittal ramus osteotomy in skeletofacial deformity patients with temporomandibular joint disorders.PURPOSE: This preliminary study was performed to clarify the usefulness of intraoral verticosagittal ramus osteotomy (IVSRO) in patients with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) disorders. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We examined 34 sides in 19 consecutive patients with dentofacial deformities with TMJ dysfunction undergoing IVSRO. Preoperatively, 15 patients had TMJ sounds bilaterally and 4 had sounds unilaterally. Five sides in 3 patients had pain in the TMJ, and 4 sides in 3 patients had masticatory muscle pain. The TMJ symptoms, including TMJ sounds, pain in the TMJ, and masticatory muscle pain in each patient, were assessed clinically before and approximately 12 months after IVSRO. Magnetic resonance imaging was also performed to determine joint status, including determination of the positions of the condyle and disc. RESULTS: The symptoms of the TMJ after 12 months of orthodontic treatment showed marked improvements, with the disappearance of the TMJ sounds in 94% of the sides examined. Pain in the TMJ improved in 4 of 5 sides, and pain of the masticatory muscle improved in 3 of 4 sides. With regard to the relative positions of the condyle and disc on magnetic resonance imaging, 6 of 8 joints and 5 of 7 joints showed improvement in anterior disc displacement with and without reduction, respectively. The direction and mean amount of movement in the distal segment were 8 mm in setback, 4 mm in advance, and 5 mm counterclockwise. CONCLUSION: IVSRO is potentially as useful for the treatment of TMJ disorders in orthognathic surgery patients as is intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy, and IVSRO can be used selectively in cases in which intraoral vertical ramus osteotomy is contraindicated.",M1
15315217,"[Dental occlusion and subjective temporomandibular joint symptoms in men and women. Results of the Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP)]Aim of the study was to determine whether associations exist in men as well as in women between occlusal factors like malocclusions or factors of functional occlusion and subjective temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) symptoms, based on the population-based Study of Health in Pomerania (SHIP-0). A representative sample of 4310 men and women (response rate 68.8%) aged 20 to 81 years was examined for subjective temporomandibular joint symptoms, malocclusions (incl. normal occlusion), factors of functional occlusion and for sociodemographic parameters. Men and women were analyzed separately with multiple logistic regression analyses, adjusted for age. The results were compared to other population-based studies from an own systematic review on this subject. In men and women, none of the 48 occlusal factors under survey (malocclusions or functional occlusion) was significantly more frequently associated with the dependent variable  subjective temporomandibular joint symptoms . In contrast, the parafunction  frequent clenching  was associated more frequently and clinically relevant with TMJ symptoms in both sexes (for men, odds ratio = 4.2, prevalence 4.9%; for women OR = 2.9, prevalence 5.6%). Malocclusions and functional occlusion factors only explained a smaller part of the differences between the male and female population with and without subjective TMJ symptoms. Compared to other population-based studies only few and inconsistent associations between occlusal factors and subjective temporomandibular symptoms were ascertainable in both sexes.",M1
15293779,"Mood spectrum in patients with different painful temporomandibular disorders.The purpose of this study was to investigate for difference in the prevalence of mood disorders between patients with different painful temporomandibular disorders (TMD). After a sample size necessary for the study was calculated, 60 patients with a painful TMD were selected and divided into the following groups: myofascial pain (n=20), temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pain (n=18), combined myofascial and TMJ pain (n=22). Two distinct comparison groups were selected: subjects with a nonpainful TMD (n=25) and TMD-free subjects (n=29). All participants filled out a self-report validated instrument (MOODS-SR) to evaluate psychopathological symptoms related to mood disturbances. A one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Bonferroni's post hoc test for multiple comparisons was performed to investigate for significant differences among the groups. The three groups of patients with painful TMD scored significantly higher than comparison groups in all MOODS-SR domains investigating depression, but no difference was shown between subjects with myofascial pain and those with TMJ pain. No significant differences among the groups emerged for the presence of manic symptoms, indicating that depressive disorders associated with TMD are not an expression of a more complex manic depressive illness. The study concluded that the presence of depressive symptoms in TMD patients seems to be related to the presence of a painful condition and seems to be unrelated to the location of pain. Furthermore, depressive disturbances in painful TMD patients affect the whole spectrum of depressive psychopathology.",M1
15103917,"Oral habits of temporomandibular disorder patients with malocclusion.The purpose of this study was to clarify the relationship between oral habits and symptoms of temporomandibular joint disorder in patients who had sought orthodontic treatment by analyzing their present and past history. The subjects were 57 female patients (average age: 23 years and 6 months old) who had visited the  Temporomandibular Disorder Section  in our orthodontic department. Their chief complaints were the symptom of <e>TMJ</e> and the abnormalities of occlusion such as maxillary protrusion, open bite, crowding, mandibular protrusion, cross bite, deep bite, edge-to-edge bite, and spacing. Their present conditions and past histories were examined and evaluated. The most typical primary symptom was joint sound (23 patients, 40.0%). The second was joint sound and pain (15 patients, 26.3%). Of the symptoms present at the time of examination, the most prevalent were joint sound and pain (20 patients, 35.1%). The 48 patients (82.8%) had significant oral habits. Unilateral chewing was seen in 35 patients (72.9%), bruxism in 27 (56.3%), abnormality of posture in 14 (29.2%), habitual crunching in 10 (20.8%) and resting the check on the hand in 4 (8.3%), respectively. When comparing the primary symptoms to those at the time of examination, the patients with unilateral chewing and bruxism tended to have more complicated symptoms.

14973990,"Stabilisation splint therapy for temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome.BACKGROUND: Pain dysfunction syndrome (PDS) is the most common temporomandibular disorder (TMD). There are many synonyms for this condition including facial arthromylagia, <e>TMJ</e> dysfunction syndrome, myofacial pain dysfunction syndrome, craniomandibular dysfunction and myofacial pain dysfunction. The aetiology of PDS is multifactorial and many different therapies have been advocated. OBJECTIVES: To establish the effectiveness of stabilisation splint therapy in reducing symptoms in patients with pain dysfunction syndrome. SEARCH STRATEGY: Electronic databases (including the Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register; the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL); The Cochrane Library Issue 2, 2003; MEDLINE (1966 to June 2001); EMBASE (1966 to June 2001)) were searched. Handsearching of relevant journals was undertaken and reference lists of included studies screened. Experts in the field were contacted to identify unpublished articles. There was no language restriction. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised or quasi-randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in which splint therapy was compared concurrently to no treatment, other occlusal appliances, or any other active intervention. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Data extraction was carried out independently and in duplicate. Validity assessment of the included trials was carried out at the same time as data extraction. Discrepancies were discussed and a third reviewer consulted. The author of the primary study was contacted where necessary. The studies were grouped according to treatment type and duration of follow up. MAIN RESULTS: Twenty potentially relevant RCTs were identified. Eight trials were excluded leaving 12 RCTs for analysis. Stabilisation splint therapy was compared to: acupuncture, bite plates, biofeedback/stress management, visual feedback, relaxation, jaw exercises, non-occluding appliance and minimal/no treatment. There was no evidence of a statistically significant difference in the effectiveness of stabilisation splint therapy (SS) in reducing symptoms in patients with pain dysfunction syndrome compared with other active treatments. There is weak evidence to suggest that the use of SS for the treatment of PDS may be beneficial for reducing pain severity, at rest and on palpation, when compared to no treatment. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence either for or against the use of stabilisation splint therapy for the treatment of temporomandibular pain dysfunction syndrome. This review suggests the need for further, well conducted RCTs that pay attention to method of allocation, outcome assessment, large sample size, and enough duration of follow up. A standardisation of the outcomes of the treatment of PDS should be established in the RCTs.",M1
14604143,"Signs and symptoms of temporomandibular joint dysfunction in children with primary dentition.The presence of signs and symptoms of TMD in 99 children with primary dentition was evaluated through clinical exam and a questionnaire. The results showed that 34.34% presented signs and/or symptoms of TMD. Among the children with symptoms, 50% presented at least one sign or more, differing significantly from the ones without symptoms, and from those 21.6% presented sign (p = 0.0185). The most prevalent symptom was frequent headache (7.07%) followed by jaw pain (4.04%), earache (3.03%) and difficulty in swallowing (3.03%). The most prevalent sign was jaw deviation (18.18%) followed by occlusal interferences (7.07%), asymmetric condylar movement (5.05%) and <e>TMJ</e> sounds (3.03%).

A self-administered postal questionnaire concerning items on demographic background, employment details, perceived general state of health, medication, psychosocial status, and use of health-care services, was mailed to all employees with at least 5 years at their current job. The questionnaire was completed by 1339 subjects (75%). Frequent (often or continual) TMJ-related painless symptoms were found in 10%, orofacial pain in 7%, neck pain in 39%, and headache in 15% of subjects. Females reported all pain symptoms significantly more often than men (P &lt; 0.001). Frequent pain and TMJ-related symptoms were significantly associated with self-reported stress, depression, and somatization (P &lt; 0.001). Perceived poor general state of health (P &lt; 0.001), health care visits (P &lt; 0.001), overload at work (P &lt; 0.001), life satisfaction (P &lt; 0.05), and work satisfaction (P &lt; 0.05) were also significantly associated with pain symptoms, but the work duty was not (P &gt; 0.05). Our findings are in accordance with earlier studies and confirm the strong relationship between neck pain, headache, orofacial pain. TMJ-related painless symptoms, and psychosocial factors. Furthermore, TMJ-related symptoms and painful conditions seem to be more associated with work-related psychosocial factors than with type of work itself.",M1
14582587,"Treatment of temporomandibular disorders among adolescents: a comparison between occlusal appliance, relaxation training, and brief information.In a randomized trial the effects of occlusal appliance and relaxation therapy, each combined with brief information, were compared with brief information only, in adolescents with temporomandibular disorder (TMD) pain. One-hundred-and-twenty-two adolescents (93 F and 29 M aged 12-18 years) were randomly assigned to one of the following 3 groups: brief information + occlusal appliance (BI + OA), brief information + relaxation therapy (BI + RT), or brief information (BI). Included were subjects reporting pain once a week or more often, in addition to receiving a diagnosis of TMD according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria (RDC/TMD). They were evaluated before and after treatment and at a 6-month follow-up by means of self-reports and clinical assessment. The result revealed a significantly higher reduction in frequency of pain, in pain intensity (visual analog scale [VAS]), and in a composite pain index (intensity x frequency) for patients treated with BI + OA compared with those treated with BI alone. In the BI + OA group, 60% of the patients attained a clinically significant improvement (at least 50% or more) on the pain index, a significantly higher proportion compared to that obtained in the other 2 treatment groups. Analgesic consumption was also significantly more reduced in the BI + OA group compared to the BI group. However, no significant differences were found between the treatment groups in jaw opening or in muscle and <e>TMJ</e> tenderness scores. Occlusal appliance was found to be superior to both relaxation therapy and brief information regarding pain reduction and can therefore be recommended when treating adolescents with TMD pain.",M1
12928140,"[Bruxism, temporo-mandibular dysfunction and botulinum toxin]Tooth grinding and tooth clenching are unvoluntary mainly nocturnal habits that result in an hypertrophy of masseter and temporalis muscles with an unbalance between opening and closing muscles of the jaw and lead to an alteration of mandibular condyles movements and to hyper pressure in the temporo-mandibular joints (<e>TMJ</e>) which can generate severe pain. Intra muscular injections of botulinum toxin permit to restablish the balance between closing and opening muscles, to relieve pain, to treat masseteric hypertrophy with improvement of face outline and to recover a normal cinetic of temporo-mandibular joints. Moreover, botulinum toxin injections permit to quit habits of tooth grinding and clenching and one single session of injections is curative for 2/3 of the patients. There are no side effects apart from slight diffusion to superficial muscles of the face resulting in a  fixed  smile for about 6 to 8 weeks. So injections of botulinum toxin in masseter and temporalis muscles are an efficient treatment of bruxism and TMJ dysfunction, cheap with no lasting side effect.",M1

The treatment has been based on functional rest, a liquid diet for 5 days and than a functional physiotherapy aimed at rehabilitation of the TMJ. The efficacy of treatment has been showed after 2 months by restoring the dental occlusion and the TMJ's function in nine out of ten cases. Three out of four patients (75%) at the same control showed a full resolution of the facial nerve palsy. At an eighth month's follow-up all the cases had a complete resolution of the symptoms. Finally no significant studies have been reported in literature to set standardized protocols for the treatment of glenoid cavity fractures. According to the experience of authors the fractures of the medium cranial base involving the glenoid cavity should be treated as the current trends of intracapsular TMJ fractures.

12759126,"Meal pattern changes associated with temporomandibular joint inflammation/pain in rats; analgesic effects.Establishing a valid animal model to study temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pain has proven extremely difficult. Using complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) to induce TMJ inflammation, we recently showed that meal pattern analysis could be used as a noninvasive biological marker to study TMJ pain in an animal model. The purpose of this study was to further validate our animal model by determining whether aspects of CFA-induced TMJ inflammation/pain are reversed with ibuprofen (IBU) treatment. In the first trial, 48 male rats were used and in the second trial, 32 female ovariectomized rats, given 17beta-estradiol replacement, were used. The rats were assigned to one of four groups: control (CON-CON); control+IBU (CON+IBU); CFA-CON; and CFA+IBU. In the male trial, CFA injection (P&lt;.01) caused TMJ swelling and chromodacryorrhea (CFA-CON); IBU eliminated these changes in the CFA+IBU group. Meal pattern analysis showed the pertinent CFA-induced change and the IBU effect was that meal duration was increased in the CFA-CON group (P&lt;.01), but normal in the CFA+IBU-treated group on the first, but not second, day postinjection. In the female trial, CFA increased TMJ swelling, but did not cause significant chromodacryorrhea (CFA-CON); IBU eliminated swelling in the CFA+IBU group. Meal duration was increased (P&lt;.01) in the CFA-CON group, but was normal in the CFA+IBU-treated group on both the first and second days postinjection. In both trials, interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta) levels were increased similarly in CFA-CON and CFA+IBU groups (P&lt;.01). This study shows that CFA-induced TMJ inflammation/pain can cause changes in meal patterns (i.e., meal duration), which may be used as a behavioral marker for TMJ inflammation/pain.",M1

METHODS: Subjects were 155 consecutive patients and 80 community cases identified from an age-stratified representative population sample; all met the primary selection criterion of reporting pain in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) or masticatory muscles. The 2 groups were combined to yield a total sample of 235 subjects (50 male, 185 female; mean age = 39 years). Subjects were evaluated at baseline, 1 year, 3 years, and 5 years by trained examiners using standardized, reliable methods. Psychological and behavioral factors were assessed by self report. RESULTS: According to RDC/TMD criteria, 50 (31%) of the 165 subjects presenting with myofascial pain (MFP) at baseline continued to have their disorder over a period of 5 years; 55 (33%) remitted, and 60 (36%) were recurrent cases. Bivariate statistics and multivariate logistic regression analyses indicated that baseline pain frequency, number of painful palpation sites, and total number of body sites with pain were significant predictors of persistent vs remitted and recurrent cases. No predictors that distinguished remission vs recurrence could be identified. Thirty subjects from the 70 without a diagnosis of MFP at baseline developed a new MFP. A high baseline somatization score (without pain items) was a significant risk factor for onset of MFP. CONCLUSION: Muscle disorders classified by RDC/TMD are predominantly chronic or fluctuating pain conditions, with a modest probability (31%) of remission.",M1

The relationship between TMJ ID-III pain and TMJ internal derangement, osteoarthrosis and effusion was analysed in MR images of 84 TMJs in 42 patients with a clinical unilateral diagnosis of TMJ ID-III pain. Criteria for including a TMJ ID-III pain patient were report of orofacial pain referred to the TMJ, with the presence of unilateral TMJ pain during palpation, function and/or unassisted or assisted mandibular opening. Bilateral sagittal and coronal MR images were obtained to establish the presence or absence of TMJ internal derangement, osteoarthrosis and effusion. Using chi-square analysis for pair-wise comparison, the data showed a significant relationship between the MR imaging findings of TMJ ID-III pain and those of internal derangement (P=0.01) and effusion (P=0.00). Of the MR imaging variables considered simultaneously in the multiple logistic regression analysis, osteoarthrosis (P=0.82) and effusion (P=0.08) dropped out as non-significant in the diagnostic TMJ pain group when compared with the TMJ non-pain group. The odds ratio that a TMJ with an internal derangement type of disk displacement without reduction might belong to the pain group was strong (2.7:1) and highly significant (P=0.00). Significant increases in risk of TMJ pain occurred with 'disk displacement without reduction in combination with osteoarthrosis' (5.2:1) (P=0.00) and/or 'disk displacement without reduction in combination with osteoarthrosis and effusion' (6.6:1) (P=0.00). The results suggest that TMJ pain is related to internal derangement, osteoarthrosis and effusion.

PATIENTS AND MATERIALS: Sixty joints in 56 patients who presented with mandibular hypomobility suggestive of chronic closed lock were prospectively examined and treated with TMJ arthroscopic lavage and lysis during a 3-year period from 1996 to 1999. RESULTS: Eighty-seven percent (49 of 56) of patients were found to have chronic closed lock of the TMJ. The most common intra-articular findings were fibrillation (76%) and synovitis (54%). TMJ arthroscopic lavage and lysis were found to be effective in the management of chronic closed lock in 84% (47 of 56) of patients, with an average 66% reduction in pain levels and a mean improvement of 9.8 mm in interincisal mouth opening up to 6 weeks after the procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic mandibular hypomobility is a clinical sign that is often but not always caused by chronic closed lock of the TMJ. The intra-articular findings of this study suggest that cartilage degradation and synovial inflammation are important components of chronic closed lock of the TMJ that respond well to arthroscopic lavage. Patients with mandibular hypomobility not caused by closed lock of the TMJ (ie, myofascial pain and dysfunction, osteoarthrosis, and others) are less likely to derive benefit from arthroscopic lavage and lysis, so other treatment methods should be considered.",M1

11887674,"The MAS (mandibular advancement series) difference.So now it may be seen what is meant by the term  The MAS Difference . The American orthodontic specialty has for the most part been slow, or even in isolated pockets, willfully resistant to expansion of orthodontic technique up out of the  Procrustean bed  of fixed appliance limitations to the panorama of attacking the teeth-bone-muscle triangle of malocclusion with separate techniques and appliance systems designed specifically for each. What makes this anathema to those of a broader view is that it is only with those expanded, combined fixed AND functional techniques, that one has any chance at all of rendering anything close to significantly successful treatment of major <e>TMJ</e>-pain-headache-dysfunction chronic pain problems. And that is serious stuff. So, if you want to do  ortho  you had better know  TMJ . And, if you want to do  TMJ , at least TMJ to any meaningful degree, you had better know  ortho , and that means the discipline of functional orthodontics (or  maxillofacial orthopedics  if you will). The  why  of it is easily understandable once one truly understands the orthopedic (condylar displacement), myofunctional (Class II neuromuscular sling), and neurological (chronic repetitive compression nerve damage) aspects of the common functionally induced TMJ problem. The  how  of it all is another matter. That is why knowledge of a broad variety of various specific orthodontic techniques is required for the clinician because there are a vast variety of malocclusive situations with their own unique demands. But in the broadest sense, since a major portion of the orthodontic patient population suffers from somewhat of a skeletal Class II relationship, or  Class II effect  with respect to the joint, somewhere in the proposed treatment plan for these patients the clinician will have to consider some form of mandibular advancement series, whatever that series may be. But it is that MAS difference that sets that clinician and his or her specific treatment plan apart from the older, more restricted ways. It is a difference we must pay attention to, for Nature surely will.",M1

The sample comprised 96 children (51F, 45M) aged 7-13 years, sequentially admitted for orthodontic treatment of malocclusions entailing health risks. Symptoms and signs of TMD were assessed by 37 variables describing the occurrence of headache and facial pain, clicking, jaw mobility, tenderness of muscles and joints, and the Helkimo Anamnestic and Dysfunction indices. Craniofacial dimensions (33 variables), and head and cervical posture (nine variables) were recorded from lateral cephalometric radiographs taken with the subject standing with the head in a standardized posture (mirror position). Dental arch widths were measured on plaster casts and bite force was measured at the first molars on each side by means of a pressure transducer. Associations were assessed by Spearman correlations and multiple stepwise logistic regression analyses. The magnitudes of the significant associations were generally low to moderate. On average, temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) dysfunction was seen in connection with a marked forward inclination of the upper cervical spine and an increased craniocervical angulation, but no firm conclusion could be made regarding any particular craniofacial morphology in children with symptoms and signs of TMJ dysfunction. Muscle tenderness was associated with a 'long face' type of craniofacial morphology and a lower bite force. Headache was associated with a larger maxillary length and increased maxillary prognathism.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Before undergoing treatment, 258 patients were administered the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), the Pain Disability Index (PDI), and the Social Readjustment Rating Scale (SRRS). Follow-up data on pain disability, current level of pain, depression, and satisfaction with treatment were obtained on 48 of these patients who were contacted at varying intervals after completing treatment. RESULTS: BDI scores obtained at the outset of treatment were significantly elevated and were positively correlated with SRRS and PDI scores. MPD patients had higher SRRS, BDI depression, and PDI pain disability scores than TMJ patients, and differences between the 2 groups in pain disability were greatest in areas that are often sources of interpersonal stress. Among follow-up patients, PDI scores declined after treatment, with MPD patients showing greater decreases than TMJ patients. Independent of patients' diagnostic status, their pretreatment PDI scores were predictive of their pain level at follow-up and were inversely related to their degree of satisfaction with treatment at follow-up; their pretreatment BDI scores were predictive of their depression level at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The findings are consistent with previous research indicating a link between emotional dysfunction and TMD and are largely supportive of the conclusion that psychological factors play a more pronounced role when pain is of muscular origin. Promising behavioral interventions are available for TMD patients in whom psychological factors appear to be playing a significant role.",M1
11394375,"Prevalence of temporomandibular dysfunction in Turkish children with mixed and permanent dentition.This study was carried out to determine the prevalence of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) dysfunction in mixed and permanent dentition and to evaluate the sex distribution in Turkish children. One hundred and eighty-two children with mixed dentition and 212 with permanent dentition were selected for the study, which used a questionnaire and clinical examination. Children with one or more signs (TMJ sounds, TMJ tenderness, muscle tenderness, restricted mouth opening) and/or symptoms (TMJ pain during mastication and mouth opening, restriction of the jaw opening and TMJ sounds) met the criterion of TMJ dysfunction. The total prevalence of signs and symptoms of TMJ dysfunction in the studied population was 68% (68% in girls and 68% in boys) in mixed dentition and 58% (61% in girls and 56% in boys) in permanent dentition. The Z-test and analysis of variance (ANOVA) were used for statistical analysis of the difference between the results. The total prevalence of signs and symptoms of TMJ dysfunction in mixed dentition was found to be higher than in permanent dentition (P &lt; 0.05). No statistically significant difference was found in the total prevalence of TMJ dysfunction between girls and boys.",M1
11392601,"Individual prediction of treatment outcome in patients with temporomandibular disorders.Out of 3159 patients referred to a specialist clinic of stomatognathic physiology, 1297 patients started treatment because of temporomandibular disorders. All those patients were divided into subgroups of patients with mainly muscular or <e>TMJ</e> symptoms, respectively. A prediction of the treatment outcome as good or dubious was also made. This prediction was based on the patient's history and the clinical findings. A total of 989 patients (76%) completed the treatment. They all graded the degree of improvement of their initial symptoms using a Numeric Rating Scale. An improvement of initial complaints of 50% or more was judged to be a relevant change. In 85% of the patients with mainly muscular symptoms, the treatment was predicted to have a good outcome. The corresponding figures for those patients with mainly TMJ symptoms were 93%. Not less than 88% of all the patients reported an improvement of 50% or more of their initial complaints. The possibility to predict the treatment outcome as good in patients with mainly muscular symptoms was very good: 90% fulfilled the criteria of a positive treatment result. For those with a dubious prognosis, 56% had a positive outcome of treatment. The possibility to predict treatment outcome as good in those with mainly TMJ symptoms was also very good: 94% responded positively on the treatment. Almost the same figure, 88%, of those with a poor prognosis had a positive treatment outcome.",M1

11203765,"A longitudinal epidemiologic study of signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders from 15 to 35 years of age.AIMS: To study the development over 20 years of signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in an epidemiologic sample and to analyze possible correlations between these signs and symptoms and some other variables. METHODS: The original group comprised 135 randomly selected 15-year-old subjects who were examined clinically and by means of a questionnaire for signs and symptoms of TMD. The examination was repeated after 5, 10, and 20 years by the same methods. After 20 years, when the original group had reached the age of 35 years, 124 individuals (92%) could be traced, and they were sent a questionnaire and invited for a clinical examination. The response rate was high: 114 subjects (92%) completed and returned the questionnaire, and 100 subjects (81%) attended the clinical examination. RESULTS: There was a substantial fluctuation of both reported symptoms and clinically recorded signs over the 20-year period, but progression to severe pain and dysfunction of the masticatory system was rare. In both the 15-year-old and 35-year-old subjects, 13% reported 1 or more frequent TMD symptoms. At age 35, only 3 subjects (3%) were classified as having severe or moderate clinical signs of dysfunction according to the Helkimo Index, fewer than in previous investigations. Women reported TMD symptoms and headache and had muscle tenderness and joint sounds more often than men. Correlations between the studied variables were mainly weak. Among the highest correlations found (rs = 0.4) were those between reported clenching and bruxing habits and <e>TMJ</e> sounds and jaw fatigue. CONCLUSION: In this epidemiologic sample followed from age 15 to 35 years, a substantial fluctuation of TMD signs and symptoms was found over time. Progression to severe pain and dysfunction was extremely rare.",M1
11202833,"The craniocervical connection: a retrospective analysis of 300 whiplash patients with cervical and temporomandibular disorders.Because the concept of whiplash as a causative factor for temporomandibular disorders (TMD) is highly controversial, we decided to do a retrospective analysis of patients treated in our office who had sustained whiplash injuries and were treated for cervical and temporomandibular disorders. The records of 300 patients with TMD preceded by a motor vehicle accident were examined retrospectively. The most common presenting symptoms, in order, were: jaw pain, neck pain, post-traumatic headache, jaw fatigue, and severe temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) clicking. The most common TMD diagnoses were: masseter trigger points, closing jaw muscle hyperactivity, TMJ synovitis, opening jaw muscle hyperactivity, and advanced TMJ disk derangement. Based primarily on the physical examination, we concluded that the TMJ and surrounding musculature should be examined similarly to other joints, with no preconceived notion that TMD pathology after whiplash is unlikely.",M1

11106990,"Electromyographic activity in patients with temporomandibular disorders.Evaluation of masticatory muscle activity by surface electromyography (EMG) is a valuable tool for diagnosing dysfunction of the masticatory apparatus. However, controversy exists with regard to the usefulness of the EMG for patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMD). Forty patients with TMD were subjected to surface EMG of the masticatory muscles. These patients had consulted because of temporomandibular pain and clicks. In most cases (75%), the symptoms affected the patient's left side. Overall mean resting activity was 2.52 microV+/-1.25 microV (s.d.), which is slightly higher than in comparable healthy subjects (1.92+/-1.20 microV). Mean resting activity was highest in the anterior digastric muscle (3.49 microV) on the left side. Overall mean activity during clenching was 66.77+/-35.22 microV, which is about half that observed in healthy subjects (110.30+/-82.97 microV). During leftward movement of the jaw, activity was on average highest in the left digastric, while during rightward movement, activity was on average highest in the right anterior temporal (AT). Our results thus indicate that patients with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) disorder show: (1) a slight increase in basal tone; (2) a significantly reduced capacity for clenching; and (3) an apparently paradoxical inhibition of the dysfunctional-side AT during movement of the mandible towards that side.",M1
11020186,"Tumors and tumorous masses presenting as temporomandibular joint syndrome.OBJECTIVE: Neoplasms of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) usually mimic common causes of TMJ syndrome, leading to delay in diagnosis. To increase awareness of TMJ neoplasms and establish guidelines for early intervention, we performed a retrospective analysis of a series of patients with neoplasms of the TMJ. STUDY DESIGN AND SETTING: A retrospective review of the records of patients with neoplasms of the TMJ from 1990 to 1997 was done. RESULTS: Six patients were identified. The neoplasms included benign and malignant neoplasms. The time from initial presentation to final diagnosis was in most cases prolonged, ranging from 3 months to 8 years. Patients typically showed advanced lesions radiographically. All patients required surgical extirpation. Postoperative radiation therapy was used for malignant lesions. Patient outcomes were delineated. CONCLUSIONS AND SIGNIFICANCE: Neoplasms, both benign and malignant, of the TMJ are rare but represent a challenging diagnostic problem. In patients with 1 month or more of recalcitrant TMJ swelling or pain, radiographic imaging may be considered to rule out these rare neoplasms. This may lead to earlier intervention and improved outcome.",M1
10970079,"Effects of orthognathic surgery on temporomandibular joint dysfunction. A controlled prospective 4-year follow-up study.A prospective follow-up study was performed to examine the influence of contemporary orthognathic treatment on signs and symptoms of <e>TMJ</e> dysfunction. Sixty consecutive patients were examined once preoperatively and twice postoperatively, and Helkimo's Anamnestic and Dysfunction Indices (Ai and Di) were determined. The prevalence of headache was also assessed. The average follow-up was 4 years from the initial examination. A group of 20 patients with a similar type and grade of dentofacial deformity, who did not wish to have surgery or other occlusal therapy, served as a control group. The majority (73.3%) of the patients had signs and symptoms of TMJ dysfunction (TMD) in the initial phase. At final examination the prevalence of TMD had been reduced to 60% (P=0.013). There was a dramatic improvement in headache: initially 38 (63%) patients reported that they suffered from headache, but at the final visit only 15 (25%) did so. It is concluded that functional status can be significantly improved and pain levels reduced with orthognathic treatment. The risk for new TMD is extremely low. No association, however, could be shown between TMD and the specific type or magnitude of dentofacial deformity.",M1
10901603,"Symptoms and signs of temporomandibular disorders before, during and after orthodontic treatment.The relationship between orthodontic treatment and symptoms and signs of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) was studied prospectively and longitudinally in 65 adolescent girls with Class II malocclusion. The subjects received orthodontic fixed appliance treatment with the straight-wire technique combined with or without extractions and were examined for symptoms and signs of TMD before, during, after, and finally one year post-treatment. Both symptoms and signs of TMD showed considerable fluctuations over the three-year period within the individuals. The general tendency was a decreased prevalence of symptoms of TMD over the three years. The prevalence of pain on mandibular movement and tenderness to palpation of the masticatory muscles was significantly less common during and after orthodontic treatment than before. Clinically registered <e>TMJ</e> clicking increased slightly over the three year period. One orthodontic treatment effect when normalizing Class II malocclusions with fixed appliances was a decreased prevalence of functional occlusal interferences. We concluded that the orthodontic treatment either with or without tooth extractions did not increase the risk for TMD or worsen pre-treatment signs of TMD. Subjects with Class II malocclusion and pre-treatment signs of TMD of muscular origin seemed rather to benefit functionally from orthodontic treatment in a three-year perspective.",M1
10806952,"TMD: it's our responsibility! Part Two.Dentists modify and construct occlusions. This occurs on a daily basis in the disciplines of restorative, fixed and removable prosthetics and orthodontics. These procedures influence the <e>TMJ</e>, the muscles of mastication, the supporting structure of the teeth and the teeth as well. Dentists have an opportunity to not only objectively analyze how they all interrelate, but to create a physiological harmonious relationship. This will reduce a traumatic occlusion to one that is within the histological adaptive range for the tissue to accommodate. This knowledge can be applied to not only help patientsí pain and dysfunction, but to ensure confidence that dentists are not going to be responsible for iatrogenic results. The future of dentistry is not only being able to effectively deal with TMD but to prevent the problems. Management of mandibular whiplash and migraine headaches are also becoming our responsibility. Dentists are the specialists of occlusion. With the technology available to render this quality of care, they must fulfill their obligation to the public, take responsibility and continue to increase their capability. This approach to dentistry provides a new  window of opportunity  as its many applications have yet to be explored.",M1
10790446,"Prevalence of signs and symptoms of temporomandibular disorders in young Nigerian adults.The objective of this study was to determine the prevalence of signs and symptoms of TMD in young Nigerian adults and to establish a baseline for comparison with other studies. It consisted of a cross-sectional study at Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, Nigeria in 1997. The subjects consisted of 308 medical and dental students (207 males and 101 females) randomly selected from a Nigerian University. Their ages ranged from 17 to 32 years with a mean age of 23 +/- 3.0 years. They were assessed according to the criteria of Helkimo (1974). Whilst 26.3 per cent of the subjects reported mild symptoms (Ai I) of TMD, only 2.9 per cent reported severe symptoms (Ai II). Similarly, 46 per cent showed mild dysfunction signs (Di I), whilst 16.5 and 0.3 per cent exhibited moderate (Di II) and severe (Di III) signs of TMD, respectively. No significant relationships were found between sex, anamnestic index, and the clinical dysfunction index scores. However, there were low but significant correlations between ananmestic index scores (Ai) and the recorded signs (Di), as well as the clinical dysfunction scores (CDS). There is some evidence to show that signs and symptoms of TMD occur amongst Nigerians, although restricted lateral and protrusive mandibular movements contributed significantly to clinical dysfunction scores.

Thirty-two patients participated in the study, ranging from 43.0 to 79.8 years of age (mean 54.4 years, SD 8.78) at the start of treatment. All patients had been referred from the ENT department for treatment with a mandibular advancement splint. The acrylic splint advanced the mandible 50-70 per cent of maximal protrusion, opened 5 mm vertically, and was used 6-8 hours per night and 5-7 nights per week. Overjet, overbite, and molar relationship were measured on dental casts. The patients were asked to answer a questionnaire concerning symptoms of craniomandibular dysfunction (CMD). They were also clinically examined in a standardized manner, including registration of range of mandibular movements, TMJ sounds, pain on movement, and palpatory tenderness of the TMJ and the masticatory muscles. None of the patients showed more than five symptoms of dysfunction either at the start of or after 2 years of treatment. A decrease in the frequency of headache was found for nine of those 18 patients that reported headache (P = 0.004). A minor, but significant decrease in overjet and overbite was found and the molar relationship was also changed. It was concluded that 2 years' treatment with a mandibular advancement splint had no adverse effects on the craniomandibular status and function, but the observed occlusal changes requires further evaluation.",M1

10650397,"Role of temporomandibular disorders (TMD) in facial pain: occlusion, muscle and <e>TMJ</e> pain.Temporomandibular disorders (TMD) which comprise myogenic and arthralgic components have been reported to predispose subjects to headache and facial pain. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of these components in patients with facial pain and to investigate the influence of treatment of TMD on pain of these patients. The subject group consisted of 25 patients suffering from facial pain. The clinical stomatognathic examination was performed before conservative treatment of TMD, and one-two weeks, three months and one year after treatment. The severity of TMD was assessed using the anamnestic (AI) and clinical dysfunction (DI) indices of Helkimo. The intensity of pain was evaluated on a numerical rating scale (NRS). According to clinical findings the patients were classified to following diagnostic subgroups: TMD myo (mainly myogenic), TMD arthro (mainly arthrogenous) and TMD comb (both myogenic and arthrogenous components involved). Fifteen patients were classified in the TMD myo group, nine in the TMD comb group and one in the TMD arthro group. The DI index decreased significantly one-two weeks after treatment and remained at this level at three month and one year follow-up examinations. At the first examination the TMD myo group had the highest level of NRS index, which decreased significantly during the time of follow-up, while no significant changes were found in other groups. Bruxism reported by the patient had a positive correlation with the amount of painful muscles on the right side at first examination. The results show that facial pain combined with TMD may be mostly of myogenic origin, and myogenic pain seems to have most favorable response to conservative treatment of TMD.",M1
10650396,"The incidence and influence of abnormal styloid conditions on the etiology of craniomandibular functional disorders.This study aimed to examine the incidence and influence of craniomandibular functional disorders caused by abnormal styloid-stylohyoid chains. Seven hundred sixty-five patients with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) disorders were divided into two groups (with and without radiographically visible abnormal styloid conditions). In the group with abnormal stylohyoid conditions, the etiology of TMJ disorders was further subdivided into poly-, oligo- and monoetiological factors, and, after this classification, evaluated regarding a clear, possible or unlikely involvement of abnormal stylohyoid conditions in TMJ disorders. One hundred thirty-six out of 765 patients presented abnormal styloid-stylohyoid chains. One hundred five of the patients (77.2%) demonstrated polyetiological causes of TMJ symptoms with an unlikely involvement of the abnormal styloid-stylohyoid chain. Twenty-nine of the patients (21.3%) showed oligoetiological causes with possible involvement of the abnormal styloid-stylohyoid chain. In two patients (1.5%), the abnormal styloid conditions showed up as the only definite cause of TMJ symptoms (monoetiological). Detailed knowledge of variations and possible effects of suprahyoid structures is important for an accurate diagnosis of TMJ disorders. All in all, the incidence of a stylohyoid involvement in TMJ disorders is very low. However, after an initial subdivision into abnormal and normal stylohyoid conditions, the incidence of pathological stylohyoid chains gains significant importance in the etiology of TMJ disorders.",M1

10547505,"Case report of malocclusion with abnormal head posture and <e>TMJ</e> symptoms.Abnormal cervical muscle function can cause abnormal head posture, adversely affecting the development and morphology of the cervical spine and maxillofacial skeleton, which in turn leads to facial asymmetry and occlusal abnormality. There can be morphologic abnormalities of the mandibular fossa, condyle, ramus, and disk accompanying the imbalance of the cervical and masticatory muscles activities. Two normally growing Japanese female patients with Class II Division 1 malocclusion presented with TMJ symptoms and poor head posture as a result of abnormal sternocleidomastoid and trapezius cervical muscle activities. One patient underwent tenotomy of the two heads of the sternocleidomastoid muscle and the other patient did not. In addition to orthodontics, the 2 patients received physiotherapy of the cervical muscles during treatment. Both were treated with a functional appliance as a first step, followed by full multi-bracketed treatment to establish a stable form of occlusion and to improve facial esthetics with no head gear. This interdisciplinary treatment approach resulted in normalization of stomatognathic function, elimination of TMJ symptoms, and improvement of facial esthetics. In the growing patients, the significant response of the fossa, condyle, and ramus on the affected side during and after occlusal correction contributed to the improvement of cervical muscle activity. Based on the result, early occlusal improvement, combined with orthopedic surgery of the neck muscles or physiotherapy to achieve muscular balance of the neck and masticatory muscles, was found to be effective. Two patients illustrate the potential for promoting symmetric formation of the TMJ structures and normal jaw function, with favorable effects on posttreatment growth of the entire maxillofacial skeleton.",M1
10425927,"Temporomandibular treatment outcomes within five diagnostic categories.This study of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) treatment outcomes examines 274 consecutive patients in five diagnostic categories and a 25 patient comparison group to determine relative levels of symptom improvement. Employing a psychometric outcome measure, the <e>TMJ</e> Scale, it was found that patients receiving active TMD treatments manifest statistically significant symptom improvements. Untreated patients reported minor and statistically insignificant symptom variations. Patients with intracapsular TM joint dysfunctions exhibited higher levels of improvement in pain and other TMD symptoms than patients presenting with primarily muscle symptoms. This research supports the hypothesis that TMDs are not self-limiting and require active treatment interventions. It is suggested that some studies cited to show that TMDs are self-limiting have major methodological limitations, relying upon unvalidated and subjective assessments of symptom levels. This research also outlines a procedure for TMD practitioners to measure treatment efficacy and the relative effectiveness of differing treatment modalities in a valid, consistent and unbiased manner.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study was approved by a regional committee for medical research ethics, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. Forty-seven patients with JIA (32 women, 15 men; mean age, 35 years) were examined, on average, 30 years after the initial diagnosis. The findings of TMJ imaging, including CT and MR imaging, were evaluated by three observers. Bone and disk abnormalities, joint effusion, bone marrow abnormalities, and contrast enhancement were analyzed. RESULTS: The TMJs were involved in 33 (70%) of the 47 patients with JIA, with bilateral involvement in 29 patients. Slight to moderate contrast enhancement was observed on the images obtained in 14 (42%) of the 33 patients with TMJ JIA abnormalities. All main joint components were abnormal in 28 of the 33 patients, mainly showing flat deformed condyles, wide flat fossae, and thin or perforated disks in the normal position, or absent disks. Condylar concavity or bifidity, and secondary osteoarthritis were found in approximately half of the abnormal joints.

Participants provided anatomical data used in a joint load minimization numerical model to predict, and jaw-tracking data used to measure, eminence shapes. Coordinate data (x,y) of shapes were fit to third-order polynomials for two sessions, sides, and methods (predicted, measured) for each participant. Inter-session data were reliable and averaged. Those with, compared with those without, disc displacement had higher measured shape range (5:1) and left-right asymmetry prevalence (4:1).

However, there is no information regarding MRI evaluation of equine TMJ. OBJECTIVES: To describe the normal sectional MRI anatomy of equine TMJ by using frozen and plastinated anatomical sections as reference; and determine the best imaging planes and sequences to visualise TMJ components. METHODS: TMJs from 6 Spanish Purebred horse cadavers (4 immature and 2 mature) underwent MRI examination. Spin-echo T1-weighting (SE T1W), T2*W, fat-suppressed (FS) proton density-weighting (PDW) and fast spin-echo T2-weighting (FSE T2W) sequences were obtained in oblique sagittal, transverse and dorsal planes. Anatomical sections were procured on the same planes for a thorough interpretation. RESULTS: The oblique sagittal and transverse planes were the most informative anatomical planes. SE T1W images showed excellent spatial resolution and resulted in superior anatomic detail when comparing to other sequences. FSE T2W sequence provided an acceptable anatomical depiction but T2*W and fat-suppressed PDW demonstrated higher contrast in visualisation of the disc, synovial fluid, synovial pouches and articular cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: The SE T1W sequence in oblique sagittal and transverse plane should be the baseline to identify anatomy. The T2*W and fat-suppressed PDW sequences enhance the study of the articular cartilage and synovial pouches better than FSE T2W. POTENTIAL RELEVANCE: The information provided in this paper should aid clinicians in the interpretation of MRI images of equine TMJ and assist in the early diagnosis of those problems that could not be diagnosed by other means.",M2
20437698,"Serum S100A12 and temporomandibular joint magnetic resonance imaging in juvenile idiopathic arthritis Egyptian patients: a case control study.This study aimed to measure serum levels of the proinflammatory protein S100A12, investigate clinical as well as contrast enhanced magnetic resonance imaging findings of temporomandibular joint inflammation among juvenile idiopathic arthritis patients and to find out the correlation between each of them, moreover with different disease parameters as temporomandibular joint inflammation may occur without clinical manifestations; it is in need for thorough evaluation and S100A12 may be a future anti-inflammatory treatment in JIA. Twenty patients with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) and 10 healthy control subjects underwent measurement of S100A12 serum concentrations by sandwich ELISA. Temporomandibular Joints (<e>TMJs</e>); clinical and post contrast Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) examinations were performed. MRI findings were scored. Results showed that TMJ arthritis was detected in 80% of JIA patients using MRI. Serum S100A12 levels were significantly increased in patients compared to controls. Serum concentrations of S100A12 and total MRI scores were significantly higher in JIA patients with active disease compared to those without activity. Systemic and polyarticular JIA patients showed significant increase in S100A12 levels and total MRI scores compared to those with oligoarticular JIA. The MRI TMJ abnormalities revealed significant association with clinical signs of TMJ inflammation but not with symptoms. A significant correlation was found between serum S100A12 concentrations and MRI score as well as between each of them and different clinical, laboratory disease parameters. Serum S100A12 levels showed significant positive correlation with synovial enhancement score. To conclude TMJ arthritis could be detected in most cases of JIA patients using contrast enhanced MRI. Increased S100A12 levels may point to synovial inflammation. Clinical signs of TMJ arthritis may be used as filter for MRI examination. Further studies on larger scale of JIA patients are needed for monitoring TMJ inflammation and S100A12 may be a potential target of future anti-inflammatory therapy.",M2
20430506,"Modified preauricular approach and rigid internal fixation for intracapsular condyle fracture of the mandible.PURPOSE: This article reports a modified preauricular approach for intracapsular condyle fracture (ICF) of the mandible and evaluates the stability of various internal fixation methods in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) division of the Shanghai Ninth People's Hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred fifty-one patients with 208 ICFs diagnosed by panoramic radiograph and computed tomographic (CT) scan received open treatment in the TMJ division from 1999 to 2008. Their charts were reviewed. Classification of the fracture was based on coronal CT scan. Forty-three patients also underwent magnetic resonance imaging before the operation to check displacement of the disc. A modified preauricular approach was used for all patients. Various internal fixation methods from wire, to screw, to plate were evaluated for stability. RESULTS: There were 110 ICFs of type A fracture, 60 of type B fracture, 9 of type C fracture, 25 of type M fracture, and 4 fractures without displacement. A modified preauricular approach was used for open treatment, which can better expose and protect the TMJ and superficial temporal vessels. Wire and plate is the commonly used stable fixation method for type A, B, and M fractures, which accounted for 56.7% (101/178). Small fracture fragments were removed with disc repositioning for all type C fractures (n = 9) and some type B (n = 9) and M fractures (n = 5). Three type M fracture and 3 nondisplaced ICFs were treated closed. Eighty-nine patients with 115 ICFs had postoperative CT scan, which showed anatomic and nearly anatomic fracture reduction rates of 95.6%. Thirty-five patients with 44 ICFs had long-term follow-ups from 3 months to 5 years. Among them, 63.2% (n = 12/19) pediatric ICFs had continuous condyle growth after open reduction and rigid fixation; 92% adults had ICFs that healed well (n = 23/25). Postoperative complications were facial nerve injury (n = 3), TMJ clicking (n = 1), and condyle resorption that required plate removal (n = 4). CONCLUSION: A modified preauricular approach provides better exposure and protection of the TMJ and superficial temporal vessels. Wire and plate provides stable fixation for type A and some type B and M fractures. Open reduction and rigid fixation produce good results for adult patients.",M2
20392197,"The effects of acute restraint stress on nociceptive responses evoked by the injection of formalin into the temporomandibular joint of female rats.The temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) formalin test was used to evaluate the effects of acute restraint stress on the nociceptive behavioral responses of female rats during proestrus and estrus phases of the estrous cycle. Rats were subjected to one session of restraint stress (15, 30 min or 1 h). They were then either immediately killed to allow the collection of blood for hormonal radioimmunoassay determinations or subjected to TMJ formalin test to evaluate nociception. All stress protocols significantly raised the plasma concentrations of corticosterone. The performance of rats subjected to 15 and 30 min of restraint stress was similar to that of control rats, whereas rats that were stressed for 1 h showed a decrease in nociceptive responses, during both proestrus and estrus phases. The stress-induced analgesia (SIA) was greater in the proestrus phase. To evaluate the role of kappa-opioid receptors, the selective receptor kappa-opioid antagonist nor-binaltorphimine (nor-BNI; 200 microg or saline) was injected into the TMJ 24 h prior to the 1 h stress period and the TMJ formalin test. The local administration of nor-BNI partially reversed the SIA during the proestrus phase. These findings suggest that (1) acute stress for 1 h can produce analgesia both during proestrus and estrus phases; this effect is greater during the proestrus phase and (2) kappa-opioid receptor activation is involved in the SIA observed in the proestrus phase.",M2
20359450,"[Diagnosis and treatment of temporo-mandibular disorders in orthodontics]Orthodontists are fully prepared to treat the problems of occlusion that they are called upon to deal with every day. On the other hand temporo-mandibular joint disorders present more obscure difficulties from the point of view of detection and diagnosis as well the management of their treatment. That is why a profound understanding of the anatomical and physiological functioning of the temporo-mandibular joint has become indispensable for today's orthodontists who are now asked to detect and diagnose an assortment of <e>TMJ</e> disturbances whose etiology may vary greatly. By performing a rigorous diagnostic procedure, based on a thorough clinical examination supported by careful axiographic and radiological studies, of temporo-mandibular malfunctioning and its underlying etiological causes, which are primarily dento-alveolar and occlusal in nature, orthodontists will be able to adopt an appropriate therapeutic approach that might be purely orthodontic or multi-disciplinary and carried out with the collaboration of specialists in occlusion, oral surgery, and even osteopathy.",M2

OBSERVATION: A 18-year-old man with otomandibular dysplasia was treated by grafting in a homologous joint and bone branch. DISCUSSION: There is no consensus on the best age to treat the syndrome and on treatment for mandibular hypoplasia and to reconstruct the temporo-mandibular joint. An alternative to the suggested treatments consists in reconstructing the joint and the branch affected by hypoplasia by grafting in a homologous joint and bone branch.",M2
20219583,"Neurogenic temporomandibular joint dislocation treated with botulinum toxin: report of 4 cases.Many patients suffer recurrent episodes of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) dislocation due to an excess of muscle contraction or spasticity in the depressor muscles of the jaw. The manual repositioning using the Nelaton maneuver is the first treatment. Occasionally, it may be necessary to use sedation or general anesthesia to achieve the desired muscle relaxation. In case of recurrence, surgical treatment is indicated. One nonsurgical method of treatment is the local infiltration of botulinum toxin type A. We present 4 cases of recurrent TMJ dislocation in patients suffering from conditions of neurologic origin, with considerable motor deterioration, treated with local infiltration of botulinum toxin type A. In conclusion, the injection of botulinum toxin type A is an effective method in cases of neurogenic TMJ dislocation, with low morbididty and side effects, improving patients' quality of life.",M2
20200412,"Indian hedgehog roles in post-natal <e>TMJ</e> development and organization.Indian hedgehog (Ihh) is essential for embryonic mandibular condylar growth and disc primordium formation. To determine whether it regulates those processes during post-natal life, we ablated Ihh in cartilage of neonatal mice and assessed the consequences on temporomandibular joint (TMJ) growth and organization over age. Ihh deficiency caused condylar disorganization and growth retardation and reduced polymorphic cell layer proliferation. Expression of Sox9, Runx2, and Osterix was low, as was that of collagen II, collagen I, and aggrecan, thus altering the fibrocartilaginous nature of the condyle. Though a disc formed, it exhibited morphological defects, partial fusion with the glenoid bone surface, reduced synovial cavity space, and, unexpectedly, higher lubricin expression. Analysis of the data shows, for the first time, that continuous Ihh action is required for completion of post-natal TMJ growth and organization. Lubricin overexpression in mutants may represent a compensatory response to sustain TMJ movement and function.",M2
20179391,"Stress distribution in mandible and temporomandibular joint by mandibular distraction: a 3-dimensional finite-element analysis.The effects of mandibular distraction on the mandible and its surrounding tissue remain to be clarified. Here, we used a 3-dimensional finite-element method to investigate the effects of unilateral horizontal lengthening of the mandibular body and vertical lengthening of the mandibular ramus on the mandible and temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>). With horizontal loading that assumed mandibular body lengthening, tensile and compressive stresses were great near the anterior region of the mandibular angle (the loading area). With vertical loading that assumed mandibular ramus lengthening, tensile and compressive stresses were great at the center of the mandibular ramus (the loading area). Under both loading conditions, stress distribution in the TMJ was greater on the loading side than on the non-loading side. With mandibular body lengthening, the center of the mandible deviated in the direction of the non-lengthened side to widen the mandible in the lateral direction. With mandibular ramus lengthening, the occlusal plane tilted in the inferior direction on the lengthened side. In the TMJ, stress was greatest on the affected side during mandibular ramus lengthening, suggesting the need to consider the mandibular condyle on the affected side during this procedure.",M2

20163970,"An experimental study on reconstruction of the condyle of the temporomandibular joint using free autogenous costal perichondrial grafts in rabbits.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to develop a new method to regenerate articular cartilage of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) by transplantation of free autogenous costal perichondrium (PC). STUDY DESIGN: In the study, 50 adult rabbits received the operation. For the surgery in the test group, the rabbits were randomly matched in pairs within the group and underwent the surgery of cross transplantation of costal PC after trimming the articular surface of the condyle. Operations were carried out in the same way in the experimental group except for PC transplantation. Instead, the suture was stitched in stratified order in the control group. Examination methods included observation of sections under the microscope, observation of specimens under the electron microscope, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) staining, and biochemical analysis of glucuronic acid (GA) content and collagen content. The results of different groups were compared with ANOVA. RESULTS: The transplanted homologous PC escaped observable immune repulsion so that it could survive to form new joint cartilage with approximately normal tissue structure and biochemical constitution. The reproduction process was similar to the normal one, but was prolonged a little. At the later stage, the degeneration and calcification in the basal layer increased. However, because of its limited scope, no apparent effect on cartilage growth and function was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Homologous xenografting of free costal PC will not result in an apparent immunorejection of the host. Instead, the grafts can maintain their existence by obtaining nutrition from surrounding tissues and regenerate cartilage tissue.",M2

Pre- and postoperative assessment included history, radiological and physical examination, and mouth opening. Age, sex, aetiology, joint(s) affected, surgical modality, complications and follow up periods were evaluated. Various types (fibrous, fibro-osseous and bony) of TMJ ankylosis were diagnosed; trauma was the commonest aetiology. The patients' age range was 2-41 years, 62% were female, and the follow up period ranged from 14 to 96 months. Average mouth opening was significantly increased from 5.3mm pre-operatively to 32.9 mm 12 months postoperatively (P=0.0001). Marked improvement in mouth opening was documented when the ramus-joint complex was reconstructed using distraction osteogenesis (34.7 mm), costochondral graft (34.4mm) and Surgibone (34.6mm). Gap arthroplasty showed least satisfactory mouth opening compared with other techniques (P=0.001). Minor and major complications were encountered in 33% of cases, including 5% recurrence rate. Early release of TMJ ankylosis; reconstruction of the ramus height with distraction osteogenesis or bone grafting combined with interpositional arthroplasty, followed by vigorous physiotherapy is successful for managing TMJ ankylosis.",M2

The common symptoms were trismus and pain. A series of imaging studies showed widening of joint space in 1 patient with plain film; MRI demonstrated increased joint effusion in 4 patients; accompanying cellulitis in adjacent tissues was discerned by CT in 2 patients. Under the arthroscope, a reddened and swollen synovial membrane was found in 2 patients who were in the acute stage, whereas strong adhesions, destruction of cartilage, and bony defects were discovered in other 5 patients in the chronic stage. Additionally, the disc was ruptured in 3 patients, and fibrosis was confirmed for 2 patients. Lavage, lysis of adhesion, and debridement of articular surface were common procedures for treatments. The average follow-up period was 57.4 months, and no recurrence was found. Arthroscopy has proven to be a useful method for management of septic arthritis of TMJ, especially for patients in the chronic stage.",M2
20097104,"Clinical and radiologic findings of synovial chondromatosis affecting the temporomandibular joint.OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to study the clinical and radiologic findings of synovial chondromatosis (SC) affecting the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) and provide references for diagnosis and treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty patients confirmed as SC histopathologically were included in the investigation. Nineteen cases were treated with arthrotomy and 1 case with arthroscopy. The clinical manifestations, radiographic findings, histopathologic features, surgical treatment, and differential diagnosis were combined to study this disease. The SC features of TMJ on magnetic resonance (MR) images were summarized on proton density-weighted (PD) and T2-weighted images. RESULTS: Synovial chondromatosis of TMJ occurred more often in women and on the right. Symptoms included preauricular pain, swelling, limitation of mouth opening, crepitations, and deviation on opening. The detection rate of calcified loose bodies was 30% on conventional radiographs and 53.3% on computerized tomography. Multiple small ring-like or tubular signals could be seen on PD and T2-weighted MR images. SC mainly affected the superior joint space; it could involve the inferior space when a perforated or deformed disc was present. SC could extend into intracranial fossa, infratemporal fossa, and lateral pytergoid muscle. CONCLUSIONS: The characteristic ring-like signals could be found on MR images of the patients with SC of TMJ. This lesion should be differentially diagnosed with TMJ disorders and preauricular masses. Considering its recurrence and the different behavior of SC in different patients, various treatment strategies should be considered.",M2
20096414,"Differences in loading of the temporomandibular joint during opening and closing of the jaw.Kinematics of the human masticatory system during opening and closing of the jaw have been reported widely. Evidence has been provided that the opening and closing movement of the jaw differ from one another. However, different approaches of movement registration yield divergent expectations with regard to a difference in loading of the temporomandibular joint between these movements. Because of these diverging expectations, it was hypothesized that joint loading is equal during opening and closing. This hypothesis was tested by predicting loading of the temporomandibular joint during an unloaded opening and closing movement of the jaw by means of a three-dimensional biomechanical model of the human masticatory system. Model predictions showed that the joint reaction forces were markedly higher during opening than during closing. The predicted opening trace of the centre of the mandibular condyle was located cranially of the closing trace, with a maximum difference between the traces of 0.45 mm. The hypothesis, postulating similarity of joint loading during unloaded opening and closing of the jaw, therefore, was rejected. Sensitivity analysis showed that the reported differences were not affected in a qualitative sense by muscular activation levels, the thickness of the cartilaginous layers within the temporomandibular joint or the gross morphology of the model. Our predictions indicate that the <e>TMJ</e> is loaded more heavily during unloaded jaw opening than during unloaded jaw closing.",M2
20096228,"Effect of temporal bone resection on temporomandibular joint function: a quality of life study.OBJECTIVES: Temporal bone resection for carcinoma may affect quality of life (QOL) and result in temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) disorders. The aims of this study were to 1) assess TMJ function after temporal bone resection, and 2) assess the impact of TMJ dysfunction on QOL. STUDY DESIGN: Chart and patient review and QOL study. SETTING: Tertiary referral center (Manchester Royal Infirmary). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Thirty patients who had undergone temporal bone resection were identified. Thirteen patients were alive and were included in the study. All patients were submitted to a clinical examination to identify TMJ disorders and determine facial nerve function, and they all answered the University of Washington QOL (UW-QOL) questionnaire (version 4). RESULTS: Eight patients had TMJ disorders with reduced mobility in either direction and/or significant pain. Main factors affecting QOL were pain (P = 0.001), appearance (P = 0.001), and anxiety (P = 0.000). Neither facial nerve palsy nor TMJ disorders affected QOL. The responses to the UW-QOL questionnaire showed that 69 percent of our patients had a good QOL. A total of 61.53 percent of our patients had TMJ dysfunction presenting as restriction of jaw mobility with or without pain. CONCLUSION: TMJ dysfunction is present in a significant number of patients after temporal bone resection, resulting in longstanding problems, which should be addressed accordingly. Poor QOL results from ongoing pain and psycho-social disturbance.",M2

The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the effect of the use of occlusal bite splints (stabilizing and repositioning) on the sounds produced in the TMJ, by means of the electrovibratography (EVG). Thirty-one patients with TMD from the Dental School of Ribeirão Preto, University of São Paulo, Brazil were selected for this study. Group 1 (n=23) wore stabilizing bite splints and Group 2 (n=8) used anterior repositioning splints. Before and after treatment with occlusal splints both groups were analyzed using the SonoPAK Q/S recording system (BioResearch System, Inc.). The treatments with stabilizing bite splints were satisfactory, since they reduced the total amount of the sound energies (p&lt;0.05), but the use of anterior repositioning splints for no more than 4 weeks produced significantly better results (p&lt;0.01). The total amount of vibration energy involved in the vibrating movements of the TMJ showed significant improvement using anterior repositioning splints.",M2
20043825,"Estrogen and inflammation modulate estrogen receptor alpha expression in specific tissues of the temporomandibular joint.BACKGROUND: Estrogen is known to play role in temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) disorders and estrogen effects can be mediated by estrogen receptor (ER) alpha present in the TMJ. Cells expressing the estrogen receptor ERalpha are present in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) but changes in expression due to estrogen and inflammation have not been characterized. In this study, ERalpha protein content and the number of cells expressing ERalpha was measured in 17 beta-estradiol-treated rats after inflammation was induced in the TMJ. METHODS: Sixteen ovariectomized female rats were divided into two groups such that one group received 17 beta estradiol (E2) and the other was given vehicle (VEH). Groups were then subdivided further, one received injections of saline and the other received Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) within the superior joint space of the TMJ. Thus the four groups include no E2/saline, E2/saline, no E2/CFA and E2/CFA. After treatment, the rats were sacrificed, and the TMJ anterior, disc, retrodiscal and synovial tissues were analyzed by western blot and immunocytochemistry. Positive stained cells were counted using a Nikon epifluorescent microscope. RESULTS: The western blot showed that ERalpha protein significantly decreased with inflammation. The number of ERalpha-positive cells in the TMJ was not affected by inflammation or 17 beta-estradiol with exception of the retrodiscal tissue. In the retrodiscal tissue 17 beta-estradiol significantly decreased the number of ERalpha-positive cells but only in a non-inflamed joint. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, inflammation and 17 beta-estradiol can modulate ERalpha expression in the TMJ but the effects are tissue specific.",M2
20042741,"Finite element analysis of a <e>TMJ</e> implant.To determine the causes of failure of an artificial temporomandibular joint implant, one must study the magnitude and location of the maximum stresses under physiological loading. In this study, we analyzed the stresses in a commercially available TMJ implant, the bone (i.e., mandible), and the bone-implant interface using a finite element software package. Both titanium and Co-Cr-Mo/Vitallium metals as well as bones with various degrees of osteoporosis were studied. The results of the analysis showed that the maximum stresses occurred at the location of the first screw hole (closest to the condyle) of the implant. In addition, the highest microstrains were observed in the bone adjacent to the first screw hole. The results of our study have potential clinical benefit in terms of improved implant design and hence better performance.",M2
20034821,"The levels of vascular endothelial growth factor in the synovial fluid correlated with the severity of arthroscopically observed synovitis and clinical outcome after temporomandibular joint irrigation in patients with chronic closed lock.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to investigate the level of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) synovial fluid (SF) and the severity of arthroscopically observed synovitis before and after visually guided TMJ irrigation (VGIR) in patients with chronic closed lock (CCL). In addition, the findings were correlated with the clinical outcome. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four patients with unilateral CCL, who underwent a second VGIR either as a repeated therapeutic TMJ irrigation or as a follow-up arthroscopy, were enrolled in the study. They were divided into either successful (s-group; n = 11) and unsuccessful (u-group; n = 13) groups. The VEGF level in the aspirated SF and the severity of synovitis were compared between the s- and u-groups. In each group, the same parameters were compared before and after VGIR. The correlation of the VEGF level with the severity of synovitis was also studied. RESULTS: At the first VGIR, the VEGF levels showed no significant differences when comparing s- and u-groups. At the second VGIR, the VEGF level was significantly higher in the u-group. The VEGF level significantly decreased after the first VGIR in the s-group but remained unchanged in the u-group. There was no significant correlation between the VEGF level and the severity of synovitis. CONCLUSIONS: The level of VEGF in TMJ SF seems to reflect the clinical status in patients with CCL. Moreover, VEGF may be an important target molecule in future chemotherapy of TMJ CCL.",M2
20022729,"Relationship between the canthal-tragus distance and the puncture point in temporomandibular joint arthroscopy.This study investigated whether a relationship exists between the length of the canthal-tragus line and the distance from the tragus at which the puncture point for arthroscope insertion should be made. On one side of 11 cadaver heads, a puncture point was marked 7 mm from the midtragus and 2 mm below the canthal-tragus line. On the other side, the distances were 10 mm and 2 mm, respectively. The arthroscope trocar and cannula were inserted at the marked points. The anatomical location of the arthroscope after insertion was confirmed by open dissection with the arthroscope in place. Following dissection, the canthal-tragus line was measured on each side of the cadaver's head. For measurements &gt; 70 mm, puncture points 10 mm from the midtragus led to insertion of the arthroscope inside the upper joint compartment. For measurements &lt; or = 70 mm, puncture points 7 mm from the midtragus led to insertion of the arthroscope inside the upper joint compartment. This suggests that for canthal-tragus distances of &gt; 70 mm, the arthroscope should be inserted 10mm from the midtragus and for distances &lt; or = 70 mm it should be inserted at 7 mm for the greatest likelihood of entering the upper joint compartment of the <e>TMJ</e>.",M2

METHODS: In this randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, 55 subjects with TMJ and/or masticatory pain (Group I patients according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorder (RDC/TMD) received Ping On ointment for 4 weeks, or placebo for 4 weeks. Subjects were evaluated with standard measures of efficacy: pain intensity measured by visual analogue scale and maximal comfortable mandibular opening, at baseline and again after 4 weeks of treatment. RESULTS: Ping On ointment significantly reduced the symptoms of painful TMJs and/or masticatory muscles. Maximal comfortable mandibular opening also improved in the Ping On ointment group compared with the placebo, but was not clinically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary study suggests that topical application of Ping On ointment may be considered for further investigation as a potential first-line treatment modality, before prescribing analgesics, for the management of TMDs. It is topically applied, safe, reversible, and effective in managing TMDs and masticatory muscle pain.",M2
19922317,"Spectrum of magnetic resonance imaging appearances of juvenile temporomandibular joints (<e>TMJ</e>) in non-rheumatic children.BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular joints (TMJ) are frequently involved in children with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA), and gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the only modality for an early diagnosis. However, only very few data exist on the appearance of contrast-enhanced MRI of normal juvenile TMJ. PURPOSE: To define the spectrum of normal MRI findings of juvenile TMJ, and to assess a possible overlap with findings typical for active synovitis in JIA. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 96 children (192 TMJ), 51 boys and 45 girls with a median age of 7.8 years (range 3-13 years), underwent a head MRI. The presence of autoimmune disease, including JIA, was excluded via chart history, available laboratory findings, and the absence of known typical pathological MRI changes (degree of synovial enhancement, hyperintense signal on T2-weighted images in the synovia or bone marrow, and morphologic changes of the mandibular condyle) of the TMJ affected by JIA. RESULTS: In 90 (94%) children, the TMJ showed no MRI abnormalities compatible with arthritis. In three children (3%), the only abnormal MRI finding was a small bilateral joint effusion. A further three children (3%) had a mild synovial enhancement seen on both axial and coronal MR planes in one child and only in the axial plane in the other two children. Signal hyperintensity on T2-weighted images and other corresponding characteristics of TMJ inflammation were lacking in all these six patients. CONCLUSION: The vast majority of juvenile TMJ in non-rheumatic children shows no MRI abnormalities. Exceptions, including a discrete enhancement of the synovial membrane (3%) or small joint effusions (3%), can occur in a minority of patients, but none of them are accompanied by other signs of inflammation or morphological changes of the TMJ.",M2
19910127,"Stomatognathic adaptive motor syndrome is the correct diagnosis for temporomandibular disorders.Temporomandibular disorder is a generic and inadequate conception to be used as a diagnosis. It fails to express the etiology or the pathophysiology and it is mainly associated with the anatomical site. Moreover, the clinical condition presents a mandibular motor problem and not a joint problem. The hypothesis presents the new diagnosis stomatognathic motor adaptive syndrome, which comprehend a motor response and the adaptive processes it induces. Inadequate occlusal contacts cause the mandible to shift in order to reach an ideal intercuspal position. The condylar displacements are proportional to such movements. Temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) receptors respond to the capsular mechanical stress and the information reaches the trigeminal sensory nuclei. The mandibular modified position seems to be relevant information and may interfere with catecholaminergic neurotransmission in basal ganglia. The main motor responses comprise increased jaw muscle tone, decreased velocity of movements and incoordination. The overload of muscle function will produce adaptive responses on many stomatognathic structures. The muscle adaptive responses are hypertonia, pain, fatigue and weakness. Temporomandibular joint presents tissue modification, disc alteration and cracking noise. Periodontium show increased periodontal membrane, bone height loss and gingival recession. Teeth manifest increased wear facets, abfraction and non-accidental fractures. The periodontal and teeth adaptive processes are usually identified as occlusal trauma. The altered stomatognathic functions will show loss of velocity during mastication and speech. Fatigue, weakness in jaw muscle and difficulties to chew hard food are related to hypertonia. Incoordination between stomatognathic muscles groups is found, causing involuntary tongue/cheek biting and lateral jaw movements on speech. Otologic complaints, as aural fullness and tinnitus, are related to the tensor tympani muscle, innervated by the trigeminal nerve.",M2
19888478,"Evaluation of the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders for the recognition of an anterior disc displacement with reduction.The aim of this Focus Article is to review critically the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders (RDC/TMD) for the recognition of an anterior disc displacement with reduction (ADDR) in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>). This evaluation is based upon the experience gained through the careful analysis of mandibular movement recordings of hundreds of patients and controls with or without an ADDR. Clinically, it is a challenge to discriminate between the two most prevalent internal derangements of the TMJ: ADDR and symptomatic hypermobility. It is due to the very nature of these derangements that they both show clicking on opening and closing (reciprocal clicking), making reciprocal clicking not a distinguishing feature between these disorders. However, there is a difference in timing of their opening and closing clicks. Unfortunately, it is not feasible to use this difference in timing clinically to distinguish between the two internal derangements, because it is the amount of mouth opening at the time of the clicking which is clinically noted, not the condylar translation. Two other criteria proposed by the RDC/TMD for the recognition of an ADDR are the 5-mm difference in mouth opening at the time of the opening and closing clicks, and the detection of joint sounds on protrusion or laterotrusion in case of non?reciprocal clicking. These, however, run the risk of false-positive or negative results and therefore have no great diagnostic value. Instead, it is recommended that the elimination of clicking on protrusive opening and closing be examined in order to distinguish ADDRs from symptomatic hypermobility.",M2
19840284,"Simplified stress analysis on the temporomandibular joint in Class III patients with and without mandibular asymmetry using a rigid body spring model.OBJECTIVE: Aim of this study was to investigate the differences in stress on the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) between Class III patients with and without mandibular asymmetry using a rigid body spring model (RBSM). DESIGN: Menton (Me), the centre point of occlusal force on the line that connected the bilateral buccal cusps of the second molars and the most lateral, superior and medial points of the condyle were plotted on frontal cephalograms, and stress on the condyles was calculated with the 2-dimensional RBSM program of fortran. SETTING AND SAMPLE POPULATION: Eighty Japanese patients with diagnosed mandibular prognathism were divided into two groups, a symmetry group and asymmetry group on the basis of the Mx-Md midline position. OUTCOME MEASURE: The degree (force partition) of the resultant force, the direction (angulation) and displacement (X, Y) of each condyle were calculated. The horizontal displacement vector (u), the vertical displacement vector (v) and rotation angle (theta) of the mandibular body at Menton were also calculated. RESULTS: There were significant differences between the deviated and non-deviated sides of both groups regarding resultant force (symmetry group: p = 0.0372, asymmetry group: p = 0.0054), X (symmetry group: p &lt; 0.0001, asymmetry group: p = 0.0001) and Y (symmetry group: p = 0.0354, asymmetry group: p = 0.0043). For angulation, there was a significant difference between the deviated and non-deviated sides in the asymmetry group (p = 0.0095). CONCLUSION: The results of this study suggest that difference in stress angulation on the condyles could be associated with asymmetry in mandibular prognathism.",M2
19824779,"Contribution of endogenous opioids to gonadal hormones-induced temporomandibular joint antinociception.The authors have recently demonstrated that the high serum estradiol level during the proestrus phase of the estrous cycle and that the administration of estradiol or progesterone in ovariectomized female and of testosterone in orchiectomized male rats significantly decrease formalin-induced temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) nociception. In this study, the authors investigate the contribution of endogenous opioids to this antinociceptive effect of gonadal hormones in the TMJ formalin test. The opioid receptor antagonist naloxone was administrated either in the surrounding of the trigeminal sensory complex or in the TMJ region. The antinociceptive effect induced by endogenous estradiol in proestrus females and by exogenous estradiol in ovariectomized females was blocked by the administration of naloxone in the surrounding of the trigeminal sensory complex, but not in the TMJ region. The antinociceptive effect induced by the administration of progesterone in ovariectomized females and of testosterone in orchiectomized males was blocked by the administration of naloxone either in the surrounding of the trigeminal sensory complex or in the TMJ region. The authors conclude that central and peripheral opioid mechanisms mediate the antinociceptive effect of progesterone and testosterone, and central opioid mechanisms mediate the antinociceptive effect of estradiol. These findings suggest that the enhanced pain perception during low gonadal hormone periods in women and animals may be mediated by a decrease in endogenous opioid activity. This suggestion helps explain the higher severity of some pain conditions, such as temporomandibular dysfunctions in women than in men, that have no hormonal fluctuations.",M2
19821126,"Short-term effects of arthrocentesis plus viscosupplementation in the management of signs and symptoms of painful <e>TMJ</e> disc displacement with reduction. A pilot study.AIM: To provide data on the short-term effect of a cycle of five weekly arthrocenteses plus hyaluronic acid injections in the management of signs and symptoms of painful disc displacements. METHODS: Thirty-one consecutive patients (25 females, six males; mean age 42.4) with a combined diagnosis of disc displacement with reduction and arthralgia according to the Research Diagnostic Criteria for Temporomandibular Disorders underwent a cycle of five arthrocenteses with injections (one per week) of 1 ml hyaluronic acid. A number of subjective and objective clinical parameters were assessed at the time of the diagnosis (baseline), at each appointment during the treatment, at the end of the treatment, and three follow-up appointments (1 week, 1 month, and 3 months). RESULTS: At the end of the treatment period, marked improvements with respect to baseline values were recorded in all the outcomes variables, and they were maintained over the 3-month follow-up span. Significant changes were shown in subjective outcome variables, viz., masticatory efficiency, maximum pain levels, functional limitation, perceived efficacy, and objective clinical parameters, viz., jaw range of motion on different movements. Tolerability of treatment was acceptable since the first intervention and was moderately improved over time. CONCLUSIONS: A cycle of five weekly hyaluronic acid injections performed immediately following arthrocentesis is effective to improve signs and symptoms in patients with painful temporomandibular joint disc displacement with reduction and to maintain them over a 3-month follow-up.",M2
19820164,"Engineering anatomically shaped human bone grafts.The ability to engineer anatomically correct pieces of viable and functional human bone would have tremendous potential for bone reconstructions after congenital defects, cancer resections, and trauma. We report that clinically sized, anatomically shaped, viable human bone grafts can be engineered by using human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) and a  biomimetic  scaffold-bioreactor system. We selected the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) condylar bone as our tissue model, because of its clinical importance and the challenges associated with its complex shape. Anatomically shaped scaffolds were generated from fully decellularized trabecular bone by using digitized clinical images, seeded with hMSCs, and cultured with interstitial flow of culture medium. A bioreactor with a chamber in the exact shape of a human TMJ was designed for controllable perfusion throughout the engineered construct. By 5 weeks of cultivation, tissue growth was evidenced by the formation of confluent layers of lamellar bone (by scanning electron microscopy), markedly increased volume of mineralized matrix (by quantitative microcomputer tomography), and the formation of osteoids (histologically). Within bone grafts of this size and complexity cells were fully viable at a physiologic density, likely an important factor of graft function. Moreover, the density and architecture of bone matrix correlated with the intensity and pattern of the interstitial flow, as determined in experimental and modeling studies. This approach has potential to overcome a critical hurdle-in vitro cultivation of viable bone grafts of complex geometries-to provide patient-specific bone grafts for craniofacial and orthopedic reconstructions.",M2
19815519,"Temporomandibular joint formation requires two distinct hedgehog-dependent steps.We conducted a genetic analysis of the developing temporo-mandibular or temporomandi-bular joint (<e>TMJ</e>), a highly specialized synovial joint that permits movement and function of the mammalian jaw. First, we used laser capture microdissection to perform a genome-wide expression analysis of each of its developing components. The expression patterns of genes identified in this screen were examined in the TMJ and compared with those of other synovial joints, including the shoulder and the hip joints. Striking differences were noted, indicating that the TMJ forms via a distinct molecular program. Several components of the hedgehog (Hh) signaling pathway are among the genes identified in the screen, including Gli2, which is expressed specifically in the condyle and in the disk of the developing TMJ. We found that mice deficient in Gli2 display aberrant TMJ development such that the condyle loses its growth-plate-like cellular organization and no disk is formed. In addition, we used a conditional strategy to remove Smo, a positive effector of the Hh signaling pathway, from chondrocyte progenitors. This cell autonomous loss of Hh signaling allows for disk formation, but the resulting structure fails to separate from the condyle. Thus, these experiments establish that Hh signaling acts at two distinct steps in disk morphogenesis, condyle initiation, and disk-condyle separation and provide a molecular framework for future studies of the TMJ.",M2
19799971,"NMDA receptor blockade reduces temporomandibular joint-evoked activity of trigeminal subnucleus caudalis neurons in an estrogen-dependent manner.Estrogen status is a risk factor in painful temporomandibular disorders (TMJD). Previously we reported that estradiol (E2) enhanced nociceptive processing of <e>TMJ</e> input by neurons in superficial laminae at the spinomedullary (Vc/C(1-2)) region; however, the mechanisms for this enhancement are not known. The present study determined if ionotropic glutamate receptors contribute to TMJ nociceptive processing in an E2-dependent manner. Ovariectomized (OvX) female rats were treated with high E2 (HE2) or low dose E2 (LE2) for 2 days and neural activity was recorded in laminae I-II at the Vc/C(1-2) region. TMJ-responsive units were activated by ATP injections into the joint space. ATP-evoked unit responses in HE2 rats were reduced significantly by topical application of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, D(-)-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoic acid (AP5) in a dose-related manner, while units from LE2 were not affected. Application of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist, 6,7-dinitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (DNQX), inhibited the ATP-evoked responses in both groups. Spontaneous activity of TMJ units was not influenced by AP5, whereas it was reduced by DNQX similarly in both groups. The high threshold convergent cutaneous receptive field area of TMJ units was not changed by AP5, whereas DNQX caused a significant reduction in both groups. These results suggest that NMDA-dependent mechanisms contribute to the enhanced ATP-evoked responses of TMJ units in superficial laminae at the Vc/C(1-2) region under high E2 conditions, while non-NMDA-dependent mechanisms modify the encoding properties of TMJ units independent of E2 status.",M2
19788427,"Fracture of the tympanic plate with soft tissue extension into the auditory canal resulting from an unfavorable chewing experience.We present a case where a patient sustained a tympanic plate fracture of the right side while chewing a sandwich. Intense pain with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) symptoms such as restrained painful mouth opening and functional pain in full occlusion followed the incident and the fracture was diagnosed after ocular and CT-examination of the right external auditory canal. Non-ruptured soft tissue could be seen protruding into the external auditory canal and the size of the mass changed during movement of the TMJ. Treatment was not needed to resolve the situation and at 3-year follow-up the patient has no clinical symptoms.",M2
19786077,"Chronic inflammation and estradiol interact through MAPK activation to affect <e>TMJ</e> nociceptive processing by trigeminal caudalis neurons.The mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) pathway plays a key role in mediating estrogen actions in the brain and neuronal sensitization during inflammation. Estrogen status is a risk factor in chronic temporomandibular muscle/joint (TMJ) disorders; however, the basis for this relationship is not known. The present study tested the hypothesis that estrogen status acts through the MAPK/ERK signaling pathway to alter TMJ nociceptive processing. Single TMJ-responsive neurons were recorded in laminae I-II at the spinomedullary (Vc/C(1-2)) junction in naïve ovariectomized (OvX) female rats treated for 2 days with high-dose (20 microg/day; HE2) or low-dose estradiol (2 microg/day; LE2) and after chronic inflammation of the TMJ region by complete Freund's adjuvant for 12-14 days. Intra-TMJ injection of ATP (1 mM) was used to activate Vc/C(1-2) neurons. The MAPK/ERK inhibitor (PD98059, 0.01-1 mM) was applied topically to the dorsal Vc/C(1-2) surface at the site of recording 10 min prior to each ATP stimulus. In naïve HE2 rats, low-dose PD98059 caused a maximal inhibition of ATP-evoked activity, whereas even high doses had only minor effects on units in LE2 rats. By contrast, after chronic TMJ inflammation, PD98059 produced a marked and similar dose-related inhibition of ATP-evoked activity in HE2 and LE2 rats. These results suggested that E2 status and chronic inflammation acted, at least in part, through a common MAPK/ERK-dependent signaling pathway to enhance TMJ nociceptive processing by laminae I-II neurons at the spinomedullary junction region.",M2
19782622,"Management of temporomandibular joint ankylosis: 11 years' clinical experience.OBJECTIVE: Many surgical techniques to manage temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) ankylosis have been described in the literature. The purpose of this paper is to report one institution's experience using various management techniques and to evaluate the results of these surgical interventions. STUDY DESIGN: The records from our hospital of 42 patients treated for TMJ ankylosis between 1996 and 2007 were reviewed. Pre- and postoperative assessment included age, gender, etiology, ankylosis type/classification, existing facial asymmetry, maximal pre- and postoperative mouth opening, arthroplasty method (gap or interpositional arthroplasty), complications, and recurrence of ankylosis. RESULTS: The mean maximal incisal opening in the preoperative period was 7.51 +/- 6.48 mm and in the post operative period was 27.74 +/- 7.86 mm. All patients experienced significant reduction of pain during function and resumed eating a normal diet. There was no facial nerve paralysis. There was recurrence in 3 cases. CONCLUSION: Joint reconstruction with interpositional arthroplasty for the treatment of ankylosis proved to be effective regarding the prevention of recurrence and restoration of joint function and patient quality of life. Early postoperative exercises, appropriate physiotherapy, and close follow-up play an important role in the prevention of recurrence.",M2
19767517,"Diagnostic accuracy of microcomputed tomography for osseous abnormalities in the rat temporomandibular joint condyle.OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of in vivo micro-CT for osseous abnormalities of the rat temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) condyle, using macroscopic observations as the  gold standard . METHODS: A 30 TMJ arthritis model was prepared by injecting inflammatory complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) into one side of the TMJ cavities of rats. The TMJ condyles were then imaged using micro-CT. The samples were macroscopically evaluated for osseous abnormalities, including erosions, osteophytes, flattening and concavity. The micro-CT images were independently assessed for abnormalities using the same criteria. Images in three planes were produced using the micro-XYZ technique with the micro-CT equipment. RESULTS: According to the macroscopic observations, 26 of the 60 rat condyles showed osseous abnormalities. The micro-XYZ images detected abnormalities in 25 of the condyles. The condyle diagnostic accuracy of micro-CT was 0.98, the sensitivity was 0.96 and the specificity was 1.0. CONCLUSIONS: Good diagnostic results were obtained using micro-CT. It is therefore an effective technique for the evaluation of osseous abnormalities in the rat TMJ condyle.",M2
19761954,"Effects of the myofascial release in diffuse systemic sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: To improve breathing and functionality of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) and hands, by increasing the range of motion (ROM), and to reduce the level of pain. METHOD: Twenty myofascial release (MR) sessions in 2002 with assessments (chest expansion, mouth opening, ROM of wrist and fingers). Between the 19th and the 20th session there was a break of 110 days. Every winter, 1-3 sessions have been made. RESULTS: Chest: expansion increased by 3.5 cm and pain was eliminated at the scar from a biopsy; TMJ: an 8mm increase in mouth opening with pain eliminated; hands and fingers: increase of ROM in all joints of fingers and wrists, of up to 100%, reduction in ulcerations and recovery of nail growth. CONCLUSION: The connective tissue affected by diffuse systemic sclerosis (dSSc) is subject to remodeling through MR, receding when the work is interrupted. Resuming the treatment on a regular basis increased the ROM in joints, reduced the effects of the Raynaud Phenomenon and the pain.",M2
19732676,"Effects of Herbst appliance treatment on temporomandibular joint disc position and morphology: a prospective magnetic resonance imaging study.INTRODUCTION: The objective of this prospective study was to evaluate changes in the position and morphology of the disc in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). METHODS: The subjects were 32 consecutive adolescent patients with Class II Division 1 malocclusion treated with the Herbst appliance. The MRIs were obtained immediately before treatment (T1), 8 to 10 weeks after appliance placement (T2), and 12 months later (T3). RESULTS: Qualitative evaluation of the MRIs showed that, in 42 (65.62%) of the 64 TMJs, the disc was positioned within normal limits at T1. Because of the advancements caused by the Herbst appliance, a tendency for disc retrusion was observed at T2, but at T3 the disc had returned to normal limits. In 22 TMJs (34.37%), the disc was displaced at T1, and no changes were observed at T3. In most subjects, comparison of the morphology of the disc at T1, T2, and, T3 showed no significant change. CONCLUSIONS: Herbst therapy does not cause adverse effects on the morphology and position of the articular disc in the short term.",M2
19716503,"Protection of articular cartilage from degeneration by injection of transforming growth factor-beta in temporomandibular joint osteoarthritis.OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to examine the effect of injection of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) on articular cartilage in osteoarthritic temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>). STUDY DESIGN: Disc perforation was performed bilaterally in 24 rabbits to induce osteoarthritis (OA). The right joint was injected with TGF-beta as experimental groups, and the left joint with physiologic saline as control. Animals were killed at different intervals. Histology and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was performed for comparison. RESULTS: All joints showed OA-like changes, but the degree in the experimental was significantly less severe than in the control. At 12 weeks a significantly greater expression of aggrecan and collagen type II was found in the experimental compared with the control joints. However, no difference in either anabolic or catabolic genes was found between the two groups at 24 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Transforming growth factor beta may have a potential benefit in protecting articular cartilage during the development of TMJ OA.",M2
19714632,"Role of Wnt-5A in interleukin-1beta-induced matrix metalloproteinase expression in rabbit temporomandibular joint condylar chondrocytes.OBJECTIVE: To determine the possible involvement and regulatory mechanisms of Wnt-5A signaling in interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta)-induced increase in matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MMP-1), MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 expression in temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) condylar chondrocytes. METHODS: Primary rabbit condylar chondrocytes were treated with IL-1beta, purified Wnt-5A protein, or both and transfected with Wnt-5A expression vector. Expression of Wnt-5A, MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, MMP-13, and type II collagen, as well as cell morphologic changes, were examined. To explore the mechanisms of action of Wnt-5A, the accumulation and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin, the transcription activity of the beta-catenin-Tcf/Lef complex, phosphorylated JNK, phosphorylated ERK, and phosphorylated p38 were analyzed. SP600125, a JNK inhibitor, was used to investigate the role of the JNK pathway in Wnt-5A induction of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13. RESULTS: Treatment of rabbit condylar chondrocytes with IL-1beta up-regulated Wnt-5A expression. Purified Wnt-5A protein and transfection with Wnt-5A expression vector promoted the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13. Wnt-5A did not cause accumulation and nuclear translocation of beta-catenin or activation of the beta-catenin-Tcf/Lef transcription complex. Instead, Wnt-5A activated JNK, and an inhibitor of JNK blocked the Wnt-5A-induced up-regulated expression of MMPs. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that IL-1beta up-regulates Wnt-5A, and the activation of Wnt-5A signaling induces the expression of MMP-1, MMP-3, MMP-9, and MMP-13 via the JNK signaling pathway in rabbit TMJ condylar chondrocytes. Blockage of JNK signaling impairs the Wnt-5A-induced up-regulation of MMPs. Thus, Wnt-5A may be associated with cartilage destruction by promoting the expression of MMPs.",M2
19705933,"Functional changes of temporomandibular joint mechanoreceptors induced by reduced masseter muscle activity in growing rats.OBJECTIVE: To determine the influence of masseter muscle activity during growth on the functional characteristics of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) mechanoreceptors. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixty-six 3-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into an experimental group, in which the masseter muscles were bilaterally resected at 3 weeks of age, and a control group. Single-unit activities of the TMJ mechanoreceptors were evoked by indirect stimulation of passive jaw movement. Electrophysiologic recordings of TMJ units were made at 5, 7, and 9 weeks of age. RESULTS: During this period, the firing threshold of the TMJ units was significantly lower and the maximum instantaneous frequency of the TMJ units was significantly higher in the experimental group than in the control group. CONCLUSION: Reduced masseter activity during the growth period alters the response properties of TMJ mechanoreceptors.",M2
19705932,"Low-intensity pulsed ultrasound stimulation of condylar growth in rats.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) stimulation does not histologically affect the growth of mandibular condylar cartilage. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five 20-day-old Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned to experimental and control groups. Experimental rats were stimulated with LIPUS in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) region unilaterally, for 10 or 20 minutes for 20 days. After euthanasia, histological specimens were analyzed qualitatively and histomorphometrically at the anterior and posterior aspects of the mandibular condyle, including the condylar cartilage and the area and perimeter of subchondral bony trabeculae. RESULTS: LIPUS stimulation may alter the histological arrangement of the condylar bone and cartilage, showing qualitative differences on specimens treated for 10 or 20 minutes daily compared with controls. Cartilaginous layer thickness was not affected by LIPUS stimulation to a significant level, but was modified at the relative layer thickness within the cartilage at the anterior aspect of the condyle (P &lt; .05). At the subchondral bone level, 20-minute stimulation significantly increases trabecular perimeter (P = .01). CONCLUSIONS: LIPUS application may affect mandibular growth pattern in rats acting at the cartilage and bone level. The effect of LIPUS on the growing condyle is expressed through a variation in trabecular shape and perimeter. A greater response is achieved when stimulated for 20 minutes instead of 10 minutes daily.",M2
19700262,"Ultrasonography of the temporomandibular joint: a literature review.This review summarizes knowledge on the accuracy and clinical usefulness of ultrasonography (US) for the diagnosis of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) disorders. A systematic search in the National Library of Medicine's Database was performed to identify all peer-reviewed papers in the English literature that assessed the accuracy of US with respect to magnetic resonance (MR), computerized tomography (CT), clinical assessment or autopsy specimens for the diagnosis of TMJ disk displacement, effusion and osteoarthrosis. The combined search words  ultrasonography  and  temporomandibular joint ,  temporomandibular disorders ,  effusion ,  disk displacement ,  condyle , yielded 20 papers. Most studies (N=17) focused on detecting disk displacement, with less emphasis on assessing joint effusion (N=6) and osteoarthrosis (N=7). US accuracy was 54-100% for diagnosing disk displacement, 72-95% for joint effusion and 56-93% for osteoarthrosis. US is operator-dependent. Better standardization of the technique is required and normal parameters must be set. Standardization is also required for the taxonomic aspects of pathologies. Despite these limitations, US remains potentially useful as an alternative imaging technique for monitoring TMJ disorders, particularly the presence of intrarticular effusion.",M2
19697644,"Temporomandibular joint vibration in bruxers.Temporomandibular joint vibration is considered an important physical sign of joint dysfunction and/or joint pathology. The aim of this study was to compare the difference of joint vibration between bruxers and asymptomatic individuals, evaluate the effect of bruxism on the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) and the association between bruxism and temporomandibular disorders. Twenty-four (24) bruxers and 16 asymptomatic subjects were included in the study. Bilateral joint vibrations with jaw tracking were recorded using a TMJ detecting instrument during rhythmic jaw opening and closing movement. The results showed that the vibratory energy and amplitude of the moderate to severe bruxers were significantly higher than that of the mild bruxers and asymptomatic subjects. The percentage of joint vibration occurrence in asymptomatic subjects, mild bruxers, and moderate to severe bruxers was 75.0%, 77.8%, and 100%, respectively. It was concluded that bruxism might induce abnormal joint vibrations, and that the energy of abnormal vibrations might increase with the degree of bruxism.",M2
19690841,"Response properties of trigeminal ganglion mechanosensitive neurons innervating the temporomandibular joint of the rabbit.The primary mechanosensitive neurons innervating the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e> neurons) may play an important role in controlling mandibular movement and position. The purpose of the study was to investigate the neurophysiological properties of TMJ neurons during passive movement of the isolated condyle in 55 rabbits and the intact condyle in 29 rabbits. Discharges of TMJ neurons from the trigeminal ganglion were recorded with a microelectrode as the isolated condyle was moved manually and by a computer-regulated mechanostimulator and as the intact condyle was manually stimulated. A total of 237 TMJ neurons were recorded rostrocaudally from the mandibular nerve area lateral to the maxillary region in the dorsal half of the trigeminal ganglion. Of the recorded TMJ units, 97% were slowly adapting (SA) and 67% of the SA units had an accompanying ongoing discharge. The proportion of adaptation types and appearance of ongoing discharges for the isolated condyle did not differ significantly from those for the intact condyle. Most of the TMJ units (89%) responded multidirectionally to the rostral and ventral movements of the isolated condyle. The discharge frequencies of the TMJ units increased as the condylar displacement and velocity increased within a 5-mm anterior displacement of the isolated condyle. Displacement of the isolated condyle influenced the discharge frequency of the units to a greater extent than the velocity of the condyle movement. No responses of TMJ units were observed during the descending ramp. Based on these results, we conclude that sensory information is transmitted by TMJ neurons encoding joint position, displacement and velocity in a physiological range of mandibular displacement.",M2
19686936,"A protocol for management of temporomandibular joint ankylosis in children.Temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) ankylosis in children is a challenging problem. Surgical correction is technically difficult and the incidence of recurrence after treatment is high. The purpose of the present report is to describe the protocol currently used at the Massachusetts General Hospital for the management of TMJ ankylosis in children. It has been our observation that the most common cause of treatment failure is inadequate resection of the ankylotic mass and failure to achieve adequate passive maximal opening in the operating room. The 7-step protocol consists of 1) aggressive excision of the fibrous and/or bony ankylotic mass, 2) coronoidectomy on the affected side, 3) coronoidectomy on the contralateral side, if steps 1 and 2 do not result in a maximal incisal opening greater than 35 mm or to the point of dislocation of the unaffected TMJ, 4) lining of the TMJ with a temporalis myofascial flap or the native disc, if it can be salvaged, 5) reconstruction of the ramus condyle unit with either distraction osteogenesis or costochondral graft and rigid fixation, and 6) early mobilization of the jaw. If distraction osteogenesis is used to reconstruct the ramus condyle unit, mobilization begins the day of the operation. In patients who undergo costochondral graft reconstruction, mobilization begins after 10 days of maxillomandibular fixation. Finally (step 7), all patients receive aggressive physiotherapy. A case series of children with ankylosis treated using this protocol is presented.",M2
19686927,"Endogenous glutamate in association with inflammatory and hormonal factors modulates bone tissue resorption of the temporomandibular joint in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between plasma level of glutamate and extent of radiographic bone erosion of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) in patients with early rheumatoid arthritis (RA) in relation to inflammatory disease activity as well as estradiol and testosterone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 47 patients (29 women and 18 men) of whom 24 were seropositive were included shortly after being diagnosed with RA. Radiographic signs of bone tissue resorption (erosions) in the TMJ were recorded by cone-beam CT images, and an erosion score (0 to 24) was calculated for each patient. Venous blood was analyzed for rheumatoid factor, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, leukocyte particle count, glutamate, estradiol, and testosterone. Nonparametric statistical methods were used in the analysis. RESULTS: Resorptive changes of the TMJ were found in a major part of the patients. There was a significant positive correlation between plasma level of glutamate and extension of radiographic erosions that was strongest in the patients with low levels of C-reactive protein, estradiol, or testosterone. By contrast, erosions were correlated with C-reactive protein in patients with high levels of estradiol. The highest levels of glutamate were found in patients with low levels of C-reactive protein and estradiol. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that a majority of patients with early RA presents radiographic signs of bone tissue resorption of the TMJ and that circulating glutamate is associated with the extent of these changes. The relationship between glutamate and bone resorption seems to be influenced by systemic inflammatory activity as well as estradiol and testosterone levels.",M2
19686922,"Single-stage comprehensive surgical treatment of the rheumatoid arthritis temporomandibular joint patient.PURPOSE: To prospectively evaluate the outcomes of single-stage reconstruction of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pathologic features and an associated dentofacial deformity. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifteen patients (12 females, 3 males) with RA underwent TMJ reconstruction, with or without a Le Fort I osteotomy in a single operation. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed before surgery, immediately after surgery, and at the longest follow-up intervals. Numeric analog scales were used for subjective evaluation of TMJ pain, jaw function, diet, and disability. The maximal interincisal opening, lateral excursions, and TMJ crepitus were recorded at each visit. Standardized cephalometric acetate tracings were superimposed to assess for surgical (immediately after surgery compared with before surgery) and postoperative (longest follow-up interval compared with immediately after surgery) changes. RESULTS: The average patient age was 27.4 years (range 15 to 61), and the follow-up was 34.3 months (range 10 to 77). At the longest follow-up interval, all 15 patients had had a statistically significant reduction in the incidence and severity of TMJ pain and headaches. The average maximal interincisal opening increased after surgery, but the difference was not statistically significant. Lateral excursions decreased significantly after surgery. Dietary restrictions and disability were significantly improved, and TMJ crepitus had reduced significantly. The average advancement at point B was 21.7 mm (range 14 to 28), and the postoperative change at the longest follow-up interval was 0.1 mm (range 0 to 1). The average pogonion advancement was 29.2 mm (range 19.5 to 38), with a postoperative change of 0.2 mm (range 0 to 1). The average gonion vertical lengthening was 20.7 mm (range 10.5 to 29) with a postoperative change of 1.4 mm (range 0 to 4.5). The average occlusal plane angle change was a decrease of 20.7 degrees (range 16 degrees to 26 degrees), with a postoperative change of 0.4 degrees (range 0 degrees to 2 degrees). Of the 15 patients, 10 had undergone maxillary orthognathic surgery performed at the same operation. The average advancement of these 10 patients at point A was 3 mm (range 2 to 7), and the postoperative change was 0.5 mm (range 0 to 1). CONCLUSIONS: Surgical correction of rheumatoid-associated TMJ disease and the resulting dentofacial deformity can successfully be performed in a single operation using custom-made TMJ total joint prostheses to reconstruct the TMJs and advance the mandible, with maxillary orthognathic surgery and genioplasty performed at the same operation when indicated. The significant reduction in TMJ dysfunction symptoms and the long-term stability of the orthognathic surgery movements show the benefits and predictability of treating these complex patients with this treatment protocol.",M2
19647045,"Activation of peripheral kappa/delta opioid receptors mediates 15-deoxy-(Delta12,14)-prostaglandin J2 induced-antinociception in rat temporomandibular joint.This study assessed the effect of the agonist 15d-PGJ(2) administered into the rat temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) on nociceptive behavioral and the anti-inflammatory potential of this prostaglandin on TMJ. It was observed that 15-deoxy-(Delta12,14)-prostaglandin J(2) (15d-PGJ(2)) significantly reduced formalin-induced nociceptive behavior in a dose dependent manner, however injection of 15d-PGJ(2) into the contralateral TMJ failed to reduce such effects. This antinociceptive effect is dependent on peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors-gamma (PPAR-gamma) since pre-treatment with GW9662 (PPAR-gamma receptor antagonist) blocked the antinociceptive effect of 15d-PGJ(2) in the TMJ. In addition, the antinociceptive effect of 15d-PGJ(2) was also blocked by naloxone suggesting the involvement of peripheral opioids in the process. Confirming this hypothesis pre-treatment with kappa, delta, but not mu receptor antagonists significantly reduced the antinociceptive effect of 15d-PGJ(2) in the TMJ. Similarly to opioid agonists, the 15d-PGJ(2) antinociceptive action depends on the nitric oxide (NO)/guanilate cyclase (cGMP)/ATP-sensitive potassium channel blocker(K(+)(ATP)) channel pathway since it was prevented by the pre-treatment with the inhibitors of nitric oxide synthase (NOS; aminoguanidine), cGMP (ODQ), or the K(+)(ATP) (glibenclamide). In addition, 15d-PGJ(2) (100 ng/TMJ) inhibits 5-HT-induced TMJ hypernociception. Besides, TMJ treated with 15d-PGJ(2) showed lower vascular permeability, assessed by Evan's Blue extravasation, and also lower neutrophil migration induced by carrageenan administration. Taken together, these results demonstrate that 15d-PGJ(2) has a potential peripheral antinociceptive and anti-inflammatory effect in the TMJ via PPAR-gamma activation. The results also suggest that 15d-PGJ(2) induced-peripheral antinociceptive response in the TMJ is mediated by kappa/delta opioid receptors by the activation of the intracellular l-arginine/NO/cGMP/K(+)(ATP) channel pathway. The pharmacological properties of the peripheral administration of 15d-PGJ(2) highlight the potential use of this PPAR-gamma agonist on TMJ inflammatory pain conditions.",M2
19644555,"Effects of condylar elastic properties to temporomandibular joint stress.Mandibular condyle plays an important role in the growth and reconstruction of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>). We aimed to obtain orthotropic elastic parameters of the condyle using a continuous-wave ultrasonic technique and to observe the effects of condylar elastic parameters on stress distribution of the TMJ using finite element analysis (FEA). Using the ultrasonic technique, all nine elastic parameters were obtained, which showed that the mandibular condyle was orthotropic. With the condyle defined as orthotropic, the occlusal stress was transferred fluently and uniformly from the mandible to the TMJ. The stress distribution in the isotropic model showed stepped variation among different anatomical structures with higher stress values in the cartilage and condyle than in the orthotropic model. We conclude that anisotropy has subtle yet significant effects on stress distribution of the TMJ and could improve the reality of simulations.",M2
19643222,"Magnetic resonance imaging on <e>TMJ</e> disc thickness in TMD patients: a pilot study.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Studies of temporomandibular joint (TMJ) discs removed from autopsy specimens and in surgery indicate that they are often thicker in patients with temporomandibular disorders (TMDs). Disc thickness may also change when the condyle moves in and out of the joint fossa during opening and closing. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to test the hypothesis that the TMJ disc thickness is greater in TMD patients than in healthy subjects and is affected by the degree of jaw opening. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Magnetic resonance images (MRI) were made of the TMJs in young volunteers, 9 asymptomatic subjects and 9 TMD subjects, at closed and at 10-, 20-, and 30-mm open positions. The thickness of the anterior and posterior bands of the discs and the intermediate zones was measured and compared between TMD and control groups, and between closed and opened positions, using the repeated-measures method in general linear model (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The hypothesis that the disc was thicker in the TMD than in the control group was supported with respect to the anterior band and intermediate zone (P&lt;.046), but not with respect to the posterior band. The hypothesis that the thickness is affected by the degree of jaw opening was only supported for the posterior band, where it increased during opening in both groups (P&lt;.005). CONCLUSIONS: The results indicate that the anterior band and the intermediate zone of the TMJ discs are thicker in TMD patients than in healthy subjects. The posterior band thickness increases with mouth opening in both asymptomatic and TMD subjects.",M2
19639107,"Chondrosarcoma of the temporomandibular joint: a case report in a child.This article reports a rare case of a temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) chondrosarcoma in a child. Chondrosarcoma is a malignant cartilaginous neoplasm that resembles synovial chondromatosis. In the head and neck region, chondrosarcoma is uncommon, corresponding to 6.4% to 12% of all reported cases. The majority of patients with chondrosarcoma are in the third to fourth decades of life. A Pubmed search showed that 20 TMJ chondrosarcoma cases had been reported up to 2008. The present case was of an 11-year-old girl referred to an Oral Disease Center and presenting with a preauricular swelling on the right side and normal ENT evaluation. The patient was healthy. Discrete pain and mild limitation of mouth opening were observed. A panoramic radiograph as well as computed tomography (CT), ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) revealed an osteolytic lesion in the right TMJ. The skull base and adjacent spaces were preserved but adjacent anatomic structures were displaced. After an incisional biopsy, the patient underwent high condylectomy. Microscopic findings showed a tumor exhibiting cartilaginous tissue proliferation with cellular pleomorphism, nuclear hyperchromasia, and mixoid changes in the matrix. The immunohistochemical analysis of the expression of Ki-67 and Cyclin B1 proteins (cellular proliferation markers) revealed a very low proliferative cell index. The 3.5 years of clinical and imaging follow-up have shown no evidence of recurrence or metastasis, but signs of myofascial disorders could be observed. It is concluded that cartilaginous lesions in the jaws must be regarded with suspicion, since benign and malignant lesions may show similar clinical features. This case emphasized the importance of interdisciplinary approaches to minimize the possibility of misdiagnosis.",M2
19629626,"New quantitative method for bone tracer uptake of temporomandibular joint using Tc-99m MDP skull SPECT.OBJECTIVES: Quantitative bone SPECT studies have several advantages over qualitative studies for evaluating a temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>), yet in certain cases additional images are still needed. Accordingly, the current study developed a new easy SPECT quantification method for the bone tracer uptake in a TMJ and evaluated its usefulness and inter-observer variability in patients with TMJ pain. METHODS: Sixty-six adult patients (11 males, 55 females) with a mean age of 31 years (range 22-79 years) suffering from TMJ pain were questioned regarding the history of their condition, and then subjected to an oromaxillofacial examination and bone SPECT. New quantitative data for TMJs (TMJ index) were calculated from a formula using TMJ and skull counts. RESULTS: TMJs with spontaneous pain had higher TMJ indices than those without spontaneous pain (8.87 vs. 6.87, P = 0.032). TMJs with mouth-opening pain or palpatory pain also exhibited higher TMJ indices than those without such pains, although the differences were not statistically significant. Positive TMJs, according to a visual SPECT interpretation, had much higher TMJ indices than the negative ones (8.99 vs. 5.37, P &lt; 0.001). The reference skull count, mean TMJ count and TMJ index obtained using the proposed TMJ quantification method demonstrated an excellent correlation based on two independent observers (r = 0.996, r = 0.993 and r = 0.989, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: The current results indicate that the proposed quantitative TMJ bone SPECT is easy to perform, plus the resulting TMJ index has a lower inter-observer variability, making it an effective TMJ evaluation method for patients with painful TMJs, and especially useful for serial studies.",M2
19627519,"Induction of MMP-1 (collagenase-1) by relaxin in fibrocartilaginous cells requires both the AP-1 and PEA-3 promoter sites.OBJECTIVES - Relaxin induces the matrix metalloproteinase MMP-1 (collagenase-1) in <e>TMJ</e> fibrocartilaginous cells, and this response is potentiated by beta-estradiol. We identified the MMP-1 promoter sites and transcription factors that are induced by relaxin with or without beta-estradiol in fibrocartilaginous cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS - Early passage cells were transiently transfected with the pBLCAT2 plasmid containing specific segments of the human MMP-1 promoter regulating the chloramphenicol acyl transferase (CAT) gene and co-transfected with a plasmid containing the beta-galactosidase gene. The cells were cultured in serum-free medium alone or medium containing 0.1 ng/ml relaxin, or 20 ng/ml beta-estradiol or both hormones, and lysates assayed for CAT and beta-galactosidase activity. RESULTS - Cells transfected with the -1200/-42 or -139/-42 bp MMP-1 promoter-reporter constructs showed 1.5-fold and 3-fold induction of CAT by relaxin in the absence or presence of beta-estradiol, respectively. Relaxin failed to induce CAT in the absence of the -137/-69 region of the MMP-1 promoter, which contains the AP-1-and PEA3-binding sites. Using wild type or mutated minimal AP-1 and PEA-3 promoters we found that both these promoter sites are essential for the induction of MMP-1 by relaxin. The mRNAs for transcription factors c-fos and c-jun, which together form the AP-1 heterodimer, and Ets-1 that modulates the PEA-3 site, were upregulated by relaxin or beta-estradiol plus relaxin. CONCLUSION - These studies show that both the AP-1 and PEA-3 promoter sites are necessary for the induction of MMP-1 by relaxin in fibrocartilaginous cells.",M2

A 43-year-old woman visited our department the day after the injury occurred. At the initial examination, she experienced pain in the left temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) when opening her mouth. Maximum mouth opening distance was 15 mm. Routine radiography showed normal findings, but CT revealed vertical fracture of the left mandibular condyle.

After 10 days, mouth opening distance increased to 36 mm, and pain in the left TMJ disappeared.",M2
19615581,"Intracapsular condylar fracture of the mandible: our classification and open treatment experience.PURPOSE: We studied the classification of intracapsular condylar fracture (ICF) of the mandible based on coronal computed tomography (CT) scans and present our open treatment experience at the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) division of Shanghai's Ninth People's Hospital (Shanghai, China). MATERIALS AND METHODS: From 1999 to 2008, 229 patients with 312 ICFs were treated in our division. Among them, 195 patients (269 joints) had CT scans for classification. We modified the classification of Neff et al, adding a new fracture type according to our experience: type A, fracture line through lateral third of condylar head with reduction of ramus height; type B, fracture line through middle third of condylar head; type C, fracture line through medial third of condylar head; and type M, comminuted fracture of condylar head. There was no ramus height reduction in fracture types B and C. Our treatment protocol is open reduction for a fracture in which the superolaterally dislocated ramus stump is out of the glenoid fossa or any type of fracture with displaced or dislocated fragments that may cause TMJ dysfunction later. RESULT: Among the 269 joints, 116 had type A fractures (43.1%), 81 had type B fractures (30.1%), 11 had type C fractures (4.1%), and 58 had type M fractures (21.6%); 3 joints (1.1%) had fractures that were not displaced. Of the joints, 173 had open reduction-internal fixation; postoperative CT scans showed that 95.6% of these had absolute anatomic or nearly anatomic reduction. In all of them normal mouth opening and occlusion were restored. No or little deviation was found during mouth opening. Complications were pain in the joint (n = 1), crepitations (n = 2), and facial nerve (temporal branch) paralysis (n = 1). Two patients had the plate removed because of these complications. CONCLUSION: Our new classification based on CT scans can better guide clinical treatment. Open reduction for ICF can restore the anatomic position for both the condyle and TMJ soft tissues with few complications, which can yield better functional and radiologic results.",M2

19587162,"IL-1beta inhibits TGFbeta in the temporomandibular joint.Similarly to humans, healthy, wild-type mice develop osteoarthritis, including of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>), as a result of aging. Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNFalpha, are known to contribute to the development of osteoarthritis, whereas TGFbeta has been associated with articular regeneration. We hypothesized that a balance between IL-1beta and TGFbeta underlies the development of TMJ osteoarthritis, whereby IL-1beta signaling down-regulates TGFbeta expression as part of disease pathology. Our studies in wild-type mice, as well as the Col1-IL1beta(XAT) mouse model of osteoarthritis, demonstrated an inverse correlation between IL-1beta and TGFbeta expression in the TMJ. IL-1beta etiologically correlated with joint pathology, whereas TGFbeta expression associated with IL-1beta down-regulation and improvement of articular pathology. Better understanding of the underlying inflammatory processes during disease will potentially enable us to harness inflammation for orofacial tissue regeneration.",M2
19582656,"[Comparison of magnetic resonance imaging signs and clinical findings in follow-up examinations in children and juveniles with temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis]PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to analyze the extent to which pathological findings of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up examinations are correlated with clinical symptoms in patients with TMJ involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) over time. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Data from 34 patients with TMJ involvement in JIA was retrospectively examined. Shortly after two clinical examinations, the first MRI and the follow-up MRI were performed. The MRI examinations took place with 1.5 T MRI. RESULTS: In both MRI examinations alterations on the condyle (MRI1: 88 %, MRT2: 91 %) and contrast enhancement (MRT1: 76 %, MRT2 65 %) were found most frequently. TMJ pain (65 %) and lower mouth opening capacity (65 %) were the number one finding in the first clinical examination. A statistically significant correlation was found between the alterations on the condyle and TMJ pain (p = 0.025) and between the alterations on the condyle and lower mouth opening capacity (p = 0.019). By comparing the results of the first MRI with the results of the follow-up MRI, we identified a trend towards a progression of TMJ arthritis, while the clinical follow-up showed an improvement in most patients. CONCLUSION: We found a discrepancy between the progressive or stable trends of pathological findings in follow-up MRI and the decrease in clinical symptoms over time. Therefore, follow-up examination by MRI shows important information for correct evaluation about the stage of TMJ arthritis and about the need for treatment. Consequently, follow-up examination by MRI is an appropriate addition to clinical examination in the therapeutic concept.",M2
19577430,"Navigation-guided gap arthroplasty in the treatment of temporomandibular joint ankylosis.Gap arthroplasty, used in the treatment of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) ankylosis, is challenging, requiring resecting of massive abnormal bone formation at the skull base with complex and distorted anatomy. This study evaluated the application of image-guided navigation to gap arthroplasty. Four gap arthroplasties were performed on patients with unilateral TMJ ankylosis under computer-assisted navigation guidance. After preoperative planning and 3-dimensional simulation, the normal anatomic structures of the TMJ were created by superimposing and comparing the unaffected and affected sides. The amount and range of ankylotic bone to be resected was determined and displayed. Registration achieved an accurate match between the intra-operative anatomy and the CT virtual images. Anatomic structures and the position of surgical instruments were shown real time on the screen. In all cases the accuracy of the system measured by the computer did not exceed 1mm. No complications occurred and the mean minimal thickness of the skull base between middle cranial fossa and reconstructed glenoid fossa was 1.97 mm. Using image-guided navigation resulted in safe surgical excision of the bony ankylosis from the skull base. Navigation-guided resection of the ankylotic bone in the TMJ gap arthroplasty was a valuable and safe technique in this potentially complicated procedure.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: Descriptive study. ANIMALS: Cadaveric equine skulls (n=11); 8 horses with a history of quidding or headshaking. METHODS: Tangential radiographic projections were taken of a TMJ of a cadaveric skull before and after intra-articular injection of radiographic contrast. Additional tangential radiographic projections were taken after TMJ dissection and placement of a wire along the articular surface of the mandibular condyle. Subsequently, 3 tangential radiographs were taken of both TMJs of 10 skulls at 75 degrees , 70 degrees , and 65 degrees to the dorsal plane (Rt/Le15Cd70D-Le/RtRVO). Each of the 3 images for each TMJ was ranked by 4 observers who were unaware of the projection angle. Interobserver variation was calculated using a Friedman analysis of variance and significance of the most prevalent angle with a 1-sample repeated measures test. Tangential radiographic projections of both TMJs were then taken of 8 standing sedated horses. RESULTS: Tangential radiographic projections allowed the lateral half of the TMJ to be viewed without superimposition of other structures and the anatomic orientation was determined. A 70 degrees projection to the dorsal plane was ranked as significantly better than other views (P&lt;.001). There was no significant interobserver variation and the technique was safely performed in standing sedated horses with excellent image quality obtained. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Tangential radiography of the TMJ may complement and add to information obtained from clinical examination and ultrasonography before referral for more advanced imaging techniques.",M2
19567249,"Gonadal hormones decrease temporomandibular joint kappa-mediated antinociception through a down-regulation in the expression of kappa opioid receptors in the trigeminal ganglia.We have previously demonstrated that activation of kappa-opioid receptor located in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) of rats induces a significantly greater TMJ antinociception in diestrus females than in proestrus females (higher estradiol serum levels than diestrus) and males. These findings indicate that gonadal hormones decrease TMJ kappa-mediated antinociception. The aim of this study was to investigate some of the mechanisms by which gonadal hormones decrease TMJ kappa-mediated antinociception. Western blot analysis demonstrated a significantly lower kappa-opioid receptor expression in the trigeminal ganglia of intact males than in intact and ovariechtomized (OVX) females and orchidectomized (ORX) males. In females, kappa-opioid receptor expression in the trigeminal ganglia was significantly lower in proestrus than in diestrus and OVX females. Taken together these findings suggest that gonadal hormones, especially male gonadal hormones, down-regulate kappa-opioid receptor expression. Co-application of the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA or the NO-sensitive guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ with the kappa-opioid receptor agonist U50,488 blocked TMJ kappa-mediated antinociception in males and females. These findings suggest that antinociception induced by activation of kappa opioid receptors in the TMJ region is mediated by the L-arginine/NO/cGMP pathway in both sexes. Despite the involvement of the L-arginine/NO/cGMP pathway in TMJ kappa-mediated antinociception in both sexes, gonadal hormones do not diminish the activity of this pathway to decrease TMJ kappa-mediated antinociception. Alternatively, they significantly reduce kappa-opioid receptor expression in the trigeminal ganglia.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: Radiographic TMJ evaluations of 60 JIA patients were obtained at baseline (mean age 8.6 years, mean disease duration 3.2 years) and 1 to 3 times thereafter, with the final examination on average 27 years after baseline. A radiographic grading system for severity of TMJ abnormality was applied. RESULTS: Cumulative radiographic TMJ abnormalities increased from baseline to final examination (42% to 75%, P &lt; .001), as did bilateral TMJ involvement (60% to 82%, P &lt; .001). Of patients with TMJ abnormalities, 53% showed progression, and 16% revealed signs of improvement. TMJ abnormalities were associated with physical limitations at baseline and reduced well-being and more extensive joint involvement at the final examination. CONCLUSION: The frequency of TMJ abnormalities in JIA was high and increased from childhood to adulthood. Although progression of TMJ abnormalities was the general rule, near normalization also occurred on occasion.",M2
19534789,"Intra-articular adhesions of the temporomandibular joint: Relation between arthroscopic findings and clinical symptoms.BACKGROUND: Intra-articular adhesion (IA) is one of the important pathologic signs of intracapsular temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) diseases, but this factor has been rarely described with respect to its arthroscopic characteristics and histology. The purpose of this study was to describe the incidence and distribution of IA in patients with internal derangement (ID) and to investigate the correlation between adhesions and the clinical symptoms of patients with ID of TMJ with closed-lock. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted of 1822 TMJs with ID that were refractory to nonsurgical treatments and underwent arthroscopic surgery between May 2001 and June 2008 in our department. Clinical findings were assessed on the basis of mandibular range of motion, patients' age and locking duration at the initial visit. ID stages were judged according to the Wilkes and Bronstein classification based on clinical symptoms and pre-operative magnetic resonance imaging. 1506 patients (1822 joints) with ID were divided into an adhesion group (486 patients) and a non-adhesion group (1020 patients). The associations between the two groups with respect to interincisal opening, clicking duration, locking duration and patients' age were statistically analyzed using a t-test. RESULTS: Arthroscopy confirmed occurrences of adhesion in 28.76% of the joints (524 joints out of a total of 1822). Grade 1 adhesion was found in 68.89% of those cases; grade 2 in 20.61%; grade 3 in 4.58%; and grade 4 in 5.92%. The percentages of instances of adhesion in different stages were as follows: 13.89% of the joints in Stage II had adhesion, 25.47% in Stage III, 37.99% in Stage IV, and 40.37% in Stage V. There were statistically significant differences for patients' age (t = 10.41, P &lt; 0.001), interincisal opening (t = 9.54, P &lt; 0.001), paining duration (t = 3.66, P &lt; 0.001) and locking duration (t = 3.89, P &lt; 0.001) between the two groups, while no statistically significant difference was found for clicking duration (t = 1.08, P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The arthroscopic findings confirmed that the incidence ratio of adhesion was high and occurred predominantly with older patients with longer locking duration and less interincisal opening. As the stage of ID increased, the adhesion grade rose.",M2

19524834,"Stress distribution in the temporomandibular joint after mandibular protraction: a 3-dimensional finite element study. Part 2.INTRODUCTION: Patterns of stress generation in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) after mandibular protraction with a construction bite of 5 mm advancement and 4 mm opening were investigated by using a 3-dimensional finite element method; the results were reported in Part 1. In Part 2, the effects of varying the construction bite are reported. METHODS: A 3-dimensional computer-aided design model was developed from the magnetic resonance images of a growing boy (age, 12 years), by using I-DEAS NX (version 11.0, Siemens PLM Software, Plano, Tex). Sagittal advancement was 5 mm, as in Part 1; however, the vertical openings of the construction bite were changed from 4 mm to 2 and 6 mm. The stresses thus obtained were compared for differences in magnitude and pattern. RESULTS: Tensile stresses migrated more posteriorly on the condylar head with increased bite height. The locations of the tensile stresses in the glenoid fossa were similar in all simulations. The TMJ as a whole showed increased loading with the increasing vertical openings. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that increasing the construction bite height might give more favorable stress patterns in the TMJ, thereby improving the condylar response to functional appliances. The findings of this preliminary study need to be investigated in an animal model and in humans before deriving clinical implications.",M2

19500996,"Ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint.INTRODUCTION: True ankylosis of the temporo-mandibular joint must be differentiated from other reasons why a patient is unable to open his mouth properly. It can be treated by various methods. It is the purpose of this paper to (a) Present various cases with different disorders that had lead to a restricted mouth opening and (b) Report upon the long-term post-operative results achieved by having applied various treatment options for true ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 40 patients a true ankylosis was treated surgically by applying one of the two protocols: Either by interposing silastic sheetings or by implanting a TMJ prosthesis made of metal and consisting of 2 parts, a condylar head and a temporal fossa. Twenty patients could be followed up after 113 months on average - 13 patients of these have been treated by interposition of silastic and 7 have received endoprostheses. In 7 other patients, different reasons were found inhibiting freely opening the mouth. Congenital bony ankylosis of upper and lower alveolar processes, congenital or acquired bony fusion of the coronoid process with the zygomatic arch and/or temporal bone, acquired ankylosis between mandible and lateral pterygoid plate, ossifying myositis, or fibrosis of masticatory muscles following tumour irradiation. Not all of these could be operated upon and not all of these could be followed up. However, all patients operated upon followed a strict postoperative physiotherapeutic regimen. RESULTS: Long-term follow-up maximum interincisal distances (MiDs) were callipered: 34mm (mean; min. 22, max. 52) following silastic sheeting; 18mm (mean; min. 10, max. 23) following endoprosthesis implantation. In the one of the two patients who could be followed up after ankylosis of the coronoid with the temporal bone, the MiD measured 49mm 1 year postoperatively. In that one of the two patients who could be operated because of a unilateral bony fusion between the mandible and the pterygoid plate, MiD was only 26mm 8 years postoperatively. And in the one of the two males who could be followed up 8 years after operation of myositis ossificans, MiD measured 50mm. CONCLUSION: There are several possible reasons why a patient cannot open his mouth widely. Six of these have been touched upon, 4 of these have been operated upon.

19477310,"Biomechanical and biochemical characteristics of the mandibular condylar cartilage.The human masticatory system consists of a mandible which is able to move with respect to the skull at its bilateral temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) through contractions of the masticatory muscles. Like other synovial joints, the TMJ is loaded mechanically during function. The articular surface of the mandibular condyle is covered with cartilage that is composed mainly of collagen fibers and proteoglycans. This construction results in a viscoelastic response to loading and enables the cartilage to play an important role as a stress absorber during function. To understand its mechanical functions properly, and to assess its limitations, detailed information about the viscoelastic behavior of the mandibular condylar cartilage is required. The purpose of this paper is to review the fundamental concepts of the biomechanical behavior of the mandibular condylar cartilage. This review consists of four parts. Part 1 is a brief introduction of the structure and function of the mandibular condylar cartilage. In Part 2, the biochemical composition of the mandibular condylar cartilage is summarized. Part 3 explores the biomechanical properties of the mandibular condylar cartilage. Finally, Part 4 relates this behavior to the breakdown mechanism of the mandibular condylar cartilage which is associated with the progression of osteoarthritis in the TMJ.",M2
19467842,"Treatment of chronic mandibular dislocations using miniplates: follow-up of 8 cases and literature review.Temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) dislocation is an excessive forward movement of the condyle beyond the articular eminence with complete separation of the articular surfaces and fixation in that position. This study reports 8 cases using miniplates for chronic mandibular dislocations, evaluates the results and critically reviews the literature. The sample was obtained from the records of the Oswaldo Cruz University Hospital and comprises patients undergoing chronic mandibular dislocation treatment using 2.0mm titanium miniplates between August 2002 and March 2004. Pre- and postoperative assessment included a thorough history and physical examination to determine the maximal mouth opening, presence of pain and sounds, frequency of luxations, recurrence rate and presence of facial nerve paralysis. The mean maximal mouth opening preoperatively was 42.75+/-11.53 mm and was 45.62+/-8.52 mm postoperatively. There was no facial nerve paralysis. Miniplate fracture was observed in 2 cases and there was one recurrence. Treating chronic mandibular dislocation using miniplates was shown to be efficient in relation to postoperative maximal mouth opening, recurrence and articular function, however, the possibility of the miniplate fracturing must be considered.",M2

The alternative available reconstructive techniques are discussed and the advantages and disadvantages of the method selected.",M2
19464145,"Historical development of alloplastic temporomandibular joint replacement after 1945 and state of the art.The variety of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) prostheses and condylar reconstruction plates available is in contradiction to their rare application. This emphasizes that alloplastic TMJ reconstruction is still evolving. This article reviews the history of TMJ reconstruction. Medline as well as public and private libraries have been searched. Current systems are reviewed. Prosthetic devices can be differentiated into fossa-eminence prostheses, ramus prostheses and condylar reconstruction plates, and total joint prostheses. Fossa and total joint prostheses are recommended when the glenoid fossa is exposed due to excessive stress (degenerative disorders, arthritis, ankylosis, multiply operated pain patients). Singular replacement of the condyle is preferred as a temporary solution in ablative surgery. The use of prosthetic devices for long-term replacement should be restricted to selected cases, taking care to retain the disk, in order to prevent penetration into the middle cranial fossa. The term 'condylar reconstruction plate' reflects this more clearly than 'ramus prosthesis' which suggests permanent reconstruction. Long-term studies comparing the functional and aesthetic results of the various prostheses and condylar reconstruction plates are not available, which leaves the choice to personal experience.",M2
19451004,"Changes in the temporomandibular joint disc position after orthognathic surgery.OBJECTIVE: This clinical research was carried out to investigate the influences of orthognathic surgery on the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken before and after the surgery. STUDY DESIGN: There were 23 subjects who had a bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy in Seoul National University Bundang Hospital from June 2004 to December 2006 and their condyles. The mean age of patients was 22.09 +/- 3.65 and the number of men and women was 10 and 13, respectively. Bilateral sagittal planes of 46 condyles had taken MRI in both closed and open mouth states before and 3 months after surgery. The differences between pre- and postoperative disc positions and internal disc derangement (IDD) stages were evaluated. Furthermore, a correlation analysis of the amounts of mandibular set-back and disc positions was carried out. Paired-samples of the T tests, the McNemar-Bowker test and Pearson correlation analysis were applied as statistical methods. In this study, a significance level is considered to be less than 0.05. RESULTS: The disc positions had not shown statistically significant differences between pre- and post-operation in the closed state. However there were significant increases of distances between the discs and condyle on mouth opening. For instance, 0.70 +/- 1.30 mm was an average (P &lt; .01). The derangement stages of each condyle were not changed through the operation. Although there were improved or aggravated cases, the orthognathic surgery had no influence on derangement stages in this study. Last, there was no significant correlation between the 2 variables of the amounts of set-back and the changes of disc position. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were significant differences of the disc positions in the open mouth state, the orthognathic surgery appears not to have had an effect on the TMJ.",M2
19449962,"Stress relaxation behavior of mandibular condylar cartilage under high-strain compression.During temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) function, the mandibular condylar cartilage plays a prime role in the distribution and absorption of stresses generated over the condyle. Biomechanical characterization of the tissue under compression, however, is still incomplete. The present study investigates the regional variations in the elastic and equilibrium moduli of the condylar cartilage under high strains using unconfined compression and stress relaxation, with aims to facilitate future tissue engineering studies. Porcine condylar cartilages from five regions (anterior, central, lateral, medial, and posterior) were tested under unconfined compression. Elastic moduli were obtained from the linear regions of the stress-strain curves corresponding to the continuous deformation. Equilibrium moduli were obtained from the stress relaxation curves using the Kelvin model. The posterior region was the stiffest, followed by the middle (medial, central, and lateral) regions and the anterior region, respectively. Specifically, in terms of the equilibrium modulus, the posterior region was 1.4 times stiffer than the middle regions, which were in turn 1.7 times stiffer than the anterior region, although only the difference between anterior and posterior regions was statistically significant. No significant differences in stiffness were observed among the medial, central, lateral, and posterior regions. A positive correlation between the thickness and stiffness of the cartilage was observed, reflecting that their regional variations may be related phenomena caused in response to cartilage loading patterns. Condylar cartilage was less stiff under compression than in tension. In addition, condylar cartilage under compression appears to behave in a manner similar to the TMJ disc in terms of the magnitude of moduli and drastic initial drop in stress after a ramp strain.",M2
19423969,"Three-dimensional evaluation of <e>TMJ</e> parameters in Class II and Class III patients.The aim of our study was to assess condylar parameters and condyle position within glenoid fossa of TMJ in volumetric 3D imaging in patients with Class II and Class III malocclusions. MATERIALS AND METHODS. The study group included 15 patients with severe skeletal Class II (mean age 18.0 yrs) and 14 patients with severe skeletal Class III ( mean age 19,2 yrs) with an indication for combined orthodontic and orthognathic treatment. CT examination was performed, pictures were reconstructed in three - dimensional (3D) rendering and measured in two dimension projection (2D) pictures using IAC review and Transparent bone programs to quantify following condylar and glenoid fossa parameters - glenoid fossa width and height; tuberculum articulare angle; anterior, superior and posterior joint space; height and width of condyle, height of procesus condylaris. Mean values were calculated separately for left and right side. Differences of the mean values were tested using paired t-test. RESULTS. There were statistically significant differences (p&lt;0,05) between two study groups for all spatial measurements on both sides with larger spatial measurements in patients with Class II malocclusions. Also the height of procesus condylaris varied between groups with statistical difference. Unilateral differences were detected for width of fossa glenoidale and height of condyle. CONCLUSION. Results show that there are a tendency for smaller condyle and wider spaces between condyle and walls of glenoid fossa comparing TMJ of Class II with Class III patients.",M2
19413383,"Disk position and temporomandibular joint structure associated with mandibular setback in mandibular asymmetry patients.OBJECTIVE: To determine the changes in articular disk position and the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) structure in patients who had an asymmetric setback of the mandible performed by a bilateral sagittal split ramus osteotomy with manual positioning of the condyle. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-two patients with skeletal Class III malocclusion being treated at Nara Medical University Hospital were evaluated using clinical examination and pre- and postoperative magnetic resonance images of their TMJs. RESULTS: Changes in articular disk position after asymmetric setback surgery were not statistically significant, although a tendency of anterior displacement in the fossa was noted. The anterior and posterior joint spaces did not show significant changes, whereas the condyle head of the deviated or contralateral side tended to be positioned downward. CONCLUSION: The asymmetric setback of the mandible with intraoperative manual positioning of the condyle does not significantly change the disk position in the fossa.",M2
19386819,"Early diagnosis of temporomandibular joint involvement in juvenile idiopathic arthritis: a pilot study comparing clinical examination and ultrasound to magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVES: To study the validity of both rheumatological and orthodontic examinations and ultrasound (US) as screening methods for early diagnosis of <e>TMJ</e> arthritis against the gold standard MRI. METHODS: Thirty consecutive juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) patients were included in this pilot study. Rheumatological and orthodontic examinations as well as US were performed within 1 month of the MRI in a blinded fashion. Joint effusion and/or increased contrast enhancement of synovium or bone were considered signs of active arthritis on MRI. RESULTS: A total of 19/30 (63%) patients and 33/60 (55%) joints had signs of TMJ involvement on MRI. This was associated with condylar deformity in 9/19 (47%) patients and 15/33 (45%) joints. Rheumatological, orthodontic and US examinations correctly diagnosed 11 (58%), 9 (47%) and 6 (33%) patients, respectively, with active TMJ arthritis, but misdiagnosed 8 (42%), 10 (53%) and 12 (67%) patients, respectively, as having no signs of inflammation. The best predictor for active arthritis on MRI was a reduced maximum mouth opening. CONCLUSION: None of the methods tested was able to reliably predict the presence or absence of MRI-proven inflammation in the TMJ in our cohort of JIA patients. US was the least useful of all methods tested to exclude active TMJ arthritis.",M2
19386520,"Condyle replacement after tumor resection: comparison of individual prefabricated titanium implants and costochondral grafts.OBJECTIVE: The indications for temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) reconstruction are well established, but the method of reconstruction is controversial. The purpose of this retrospective study was to compare individual prefabricated condyle implants and costochondral grafts in condyle reconstruction after tumor resection. STUDY DESIGN: We conducted a retrospective review of a case series with 28 patients treated with costochondral grafting and 23 patients treated with individual prefabricated titanium implants. For each patient, variables included both subjective (pain and interference with eating) and objective (interincisal distance) data. RESULTS: Baseline patient characteristics were similar in the 2 groups; all patients were followed for a minimum of 2 years. Patients in both groups showed an improvement in symptoms. Those treated with individual prefabricated implants had greater improvement and fewer complications than those in the costochondral group; also, more patients in the autogenous group required reoperation. CONCLUSION: Individual prefabricated condyle implants are effective in reconstruction of TMJ tumor defects. These prostheses are a viable choice in the setting of tumor resection and reconstruction, with improvement of jaw function, reduction of joint pain, and esthetic improvement.",M2
19382627,"[Metric analysis of temporomandibular joint in asymptomatic persons by magnetic resonance imaging]AIM: The objective of this study was to investigate the prevalence of anterior disk displacement and condyle position in volunteers free from clinical symptoms and signs of temporomandibular disorders. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Bilateral parasagittal T1-weighted magnetic resonance images of temporomandibular joints (<e>TMJ</e>) in 25 asymptomatic volunteers (age range 21-27, mean 23.4 years; 18 (72%) female and 7 (28%) male) were analyzed and metric measurements of disk and condyle position were investigated. Metric analysis of the position and relationship between the disk and the condyles were described using Kurita et al. method of measuring relative and absolute distances of reference points. On statistical data analysis, the left and right TMJs of each person were presented as two separate entities. The methods of nonparametric statistics were used. RESULTS: Anterior disk displacement was found in 5 (20%) asymptomatic volunteers (four of them female). Anterior displacement with unilateral reduction and anterior displacement without reduction unilaterally was present in two subjects each, whereas one volunteer had anterior displacement without reduction bilaterally. There was no difference in the calculated position of condyle between joints with and without disk displacement (Kruskal-Wallis test, p &lt; 0.05). DISCUSSION: This study evaluated the prevalence of asymptomatic anterior disk displacement in symptom-free healthy volunteers and the condyle position in the glenoid fossa. Displaced disk is the main cause of temporomandibular pain; however, studies in asymptomatic volunteers also suggest it to be an anatomic variant. The relationship between dorsocranially positioned condyle and anteriorly displaced temporomandibular joint disk is a controversial issue. Metric analyses were only made in parasagittal plane. CONCLUSION: There was difference in the calculated disk position between joints with and without disk displacement, but this study found no difference in the calculated condyle positions according to the presence or absence of disk displacement.",M2

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Closed lock patients who had not shown response to the conservative treatment for more than 3 months were included in this study. The clinical data were collected using standard protocol including questionnaire. Under the informed consent, TMJ lysis and lavage were performed using ultrathin arthroscopy. For the evaluation of the treatment outcome, maximum mouth opening (MMO) and visual analog scale (VAS) were used. RESULTS: A total of 15 patients were included in this study. Concerning arthroscopic findings, fibrillation and adhesion were detected in 9 patients. Synovial hyperemia and ecchymosis was detected in 6 patients. There were no complications related with arthroscopic procedure in this study. Improvement of mouth opening more than 5 mm was detected in 14 patients. VAS score was reduced more than 60%, and VAS was recorded no more than 2 postoperatively in 12 patients. Good outcome was obtained in 12 patients (80%) from the total 15 patients. CONCLUSION: From the clinical outcomes, TMJ lysis and lavage using ultrathin TMJ arthroscopy could be considered as an alternative treatment for the closed lock patients.",M2
19369919,"Morphometric evaluation of the temporomandibular joint and the masticatory spaces: the role of high-definition MRI.AIM: The aim of this work was to describe the anatomy of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>), the masticator spaces and their possible variance by means of magnetic resonance imaging MRI. METHODS: We evaluated one TMJ in each of 28 volunteers (14 males and 14 females) without temporomandibular disorders. The TMJ with mouth closed was evaluated on axial, coronal and sagittal planes obtained with a 1.5 Tesla magnetic resonance scanner. MRI scans of the anatomic patterns of the temporomandibular region were analyzed and compared with the classical anatomy notions reported in the literature. Morphometric evaluation of the temporomandibular region and the medial and lateral pterygoid muscles was carried out. RESULTS: MRI anatomy of the TMJ, the masticator spaces and their possible variance were accurately described. In addition, morphometric evaluation of the TMJ and the masticator spaces was performed. Statistical analysis of the measurements showed that the length of the structures related to the glenoid fossa were usually longer in the female than in the males, whereas the condyle and masticator muscles were usually greater in the males than in the females. T-tests showed no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) between the measurements of the right and left TMJ. CONCLUSIONS: In preoperative maxillofacial surgery assessment, MRI is a useful tool to reduce operating time, avert surgical complications and improve patient outcome.",M2
19359384,"The effects of cycling levels of 17beta-estradiol and progesterone on the magnitude of temporomandibular joint-induced nociception.A greater incidence of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) pain is reported in females, suggesting that gonadal hormones may play a role in this condition. However, the exact roles of 17beta-estradiol (E2) and progesterone (P4) in TMJ pain are not completely known. Two experiments were performed to determine the separate roles of E2 and P4 in TMJ nociception at various stages of the estrous cycle. Ovariectomized (OVX) rats were cycled with physiological concentrations of E2 or P4. The E2-cycled rats then received bilateral TMJ injections of saline (SAL) or complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) on the morning of diestrus-2 (low E2 condition) or proestrus (high E2 condition). As a control, OVX rats (no ovarian E2 and no replacement) were injected with SAL or CFA. The TMJ nociception was measured using a validated novel method in which an increase in meal duration directly correlated to the intensity of deep TMJ nociception. In the E2 experiment, CFA injection, but not SAL, increased TMJ nociception in the OVX group, but the effect was less pronounced in diestrus-2 and even less in proestrus. In the P4 experiment, the rats receiving TMJ CFA in diestrus-2 (end of minor P4 surge) did not show an increase in TMJ nociception, whereas the rats injected in proestrus (major P4 surge), estrus (low P4), and metestrus (low P4) had similar increases in TMJ nociception. The hormones' concentration did not affect TMJ IL-1beta, IL-6, C-C motif ligand 20, or C-X-C motif ligand 2 or the trigeminal ganglia calcitonin gene-related peptide. The high physiological concentrations of E2 observed at proestrus and the low P4 concentrations observed at diestrus-2 attenuated or eliminated CFA-induced TMJ nociception. The results suggest that the cyclic estrous cycle concentrations of E2 and P4 can influence CFA-induced TMJ nociception in the rat.",M2
19329458,"Proteoglycans and mechanical behavior of condylar cartilage.Mandibular condylar cartilage functions as the load-bearing, shock-absorbing, lubricating material in temporomandibular joints. Little is known about the precise nature of the biomechanical characteristics of this fibro-cartilaginous tissue. We hypothesized that the fixed charge density associated with proteoglycans that introduces an osmotic pressure inside condylar cartilage will significantly increase the tissue's apparent stiffness. Micro-indentation creep tests were performed on porcine <e>TMJ</e> condylar cartilage at 5 different regions-anterior, posterior, medial, lateral, and central-in physiologic and hypertonic solutions. The intrinsic and apparent mechanical properties, including aggregate modulus, shear modulus, and permeability, were calculated by indentation test data and the biphasic theory. The apparent properties (with osmotic effect) were statistically higher than those of the intrinsic solid matrix (without osmotic effect). Regional variations in fixed charge density, permeability, and mechanical modulus were also calculated for condylar surface. The present results provide important quantitative data on the biomechanical properties of TMJ condylar cartilage.",M2
19304036,"A quantitative evaluation of inflammatory cells in human temporomandibular joint tissues from patients with and without implants.PURPOSE: Previous studies made only qualitative assessments of immune cell responses to temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) implant wear debris. The aim of this study was to perform a quantitative comparison of inflammatory cell types in TMJ tissues with implant wear debris, TMJ tissues with a history of disc pathology without implant debris, and TMJ tissues from normal control subjects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: TMJ tissues were collected from the following 3 groups of subjects: 1) individuals with failed TMJ implants (implant group, n = 10), 2) patients with TMJ disc pathology but no history of implant placement (nonimplant surgery group, n = 10), and normal cadaveric tissues with no history of surgery (control group, n = 10). Tissue sections (5 microm) from all subjects were stained with hematoxylin-eosin, after which cell counts were done for 2 types of inflammatory cells: multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes. Mean inflammatory cell counts from the 3 groups were compared by use of a 1-way analysis of variance procedure and Bonferroni adjustment to maintain an overall type I error rate of .05. RESULTS: Implant group tissues contained significantly more inflammatory cells than tissues from the nonimplant surgery and control groups (P &lt; .0001). Multinucleated giant cells were only present in implant group tissues. Although the high number of multinucleated giant cells present in the implant group obscured a total count of lymphocytes for that group, lymphocyte cell counts were still significantly greater (P &lt; .005) in implant group tissues than in tissues from the other 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our data provide quantitative confirmation that the presence of Proplast-Teflon implant (Vitek, Houston, TX) wear debris is associated with a significant increase in the number of local multinucleated giant cells and lymphocytes.",M2
19278993,"Effects of a liquid diet on temporomandibular joint mechano-receptors.Load during mastication is an important factor for the development and maintenance of mechano- receptor properties. The purpose of this study was to examine property changes in the rat <e>TMJ</e> mechano-receptors under conditions of liquid diet feeding and low articular load during the growth period. The hypothesis was that alterations in mastication of liquid diet might increase TMJ mechano-receptor sensitivity. Sixty-six two-week-old male Wistar rats were divided into two groups: a control group that was fed on whole pellets, and an experimental group that was fed a liquid diet. Electrophysiological recordings from the TMJ units were obtained from the trigeminal ganglion when the rats were 5, 7, and 9 weeks old. In the experimental group, TMJ mechanoreceptor sensitivity increased, because the firing threshold gradually decreased and the maximum instantaneous frequency gradually increased. In conclusion, functional properties of TMJ mechano-receptors under low articular loading conditions cannot mature normally within the growth period.",M2
19261390,"A new hypothesis of mechanisms of traumatic ankylosis of temporomandibular joint.Temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) ankylosis is a disease that severely affects the human health. Although it is well known that trauma is the most common cause of TMJ ankylosis, the mechanisms by which the traumatic TMJ ankylosis develops are unclear. The existing hypothesis is not convincing in explaining the genesis of traumatic TMJ ankylosis. We make a hypothesis that the distraction osteogenesis (DO) of the lateral pterygoid muscle combining with the dislocated and damaged disc is an important factor in genesis of traumatic TMJ ankylosis. If this hypothesis is verified, it will be helpful for the prevention of traumatic TMJ ankylosis and change the principle of management of sagittal fracture of mandibular condyle (SFMC).",M2
19248171,"Morphological changes in the mandible of male mice associated with aging and biomechanical stimulus.Degenerative changes in the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) associated with aging can affect mandibular shape and reduce growth potential when stimulated by functional appliance therapy. This study was designed to evaluate the morphological changes in the mandibles of male mice associated with aging and biomechanical stimulus. Every 3 days over the course of 1 month, the lower incisors were trimmed by 1 mm to induce mandibular advancement (MA) when the animal was feeding. The left mandibles of the 23 experimental and 27 control animals were subsequently dissected, and digital images were obtained to analyze nine linear/angular measurements. Because mandibular morphology depends on the maintenance of condylar cartilage, the surfaces of the condylar cartilage and the ascending ramus of the mandible were also analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The linear measurements of the mandible showed changes according to age in the control group and a growth response in the mandibular condyle in 7- and 15-month-old mice after MA. Moreover, SEM analysis revealed depressions in the anterior region of the condylar cartilage and inclined vascular grooves in the ascending ramus in the 7- and 15-month-old experimental mice. Although the growth potential is reduced in mice after 6 months of age, the results showed that continuous growth of the mandible occurs after maturation, except in the condyle, and that biomechanical stimulus of the TMJ of male mice leads to condylar growth. These results suggest that mature and old individuals can favorably respond to maxillary functional orthopedic therapy.",M2
19234435,"Temporomandibular joint bilateral post-traumatic ankylosis: a report of a case treated with interpositional arthroplasty.Ankylosis of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) is a severe disorder which leads to jaw function impairment and restricted mouth opening. The surgical approach to TMJ ankylosis can be performed according to different techniques. The present paper is a report of a bilateral post-traumatic case of TMJ ankylosis. The patient suffered bilateral condylar fractures as a consequence of a road accident and showed a limited mouth opening (22 mm) along with dental occlusion abnormalities. Conservative treatments were uneffective to improve jaw impairment, so a computerized tomography was requested for surgical treatment planning. Both temporomandibular joints showed severe ankylosis with a bone fragment located medially to the condyle. An arthroplasty with the interposition of a combined flap (temporalis muscle, fascia, periosteum) was performed. The post-treatment course was uneventful, and the patient has undergone physiatric rehabilitation immediately after the intervention. At the 5-years follow-up mouth opening was 46 mm. TMJ arthroplasty with the interposition of autogenous material is an effective technique to restore jaw function and to prevent recurrencies in cases of ankylosis.",M2
19233617,"Historical development of alloplastic temporomandibular joint replacement before 1945.Resections of the temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) have been carried out for about 150 years. This article reviews the beginning of TMJ surgery technique before 1945 by carrying out extensive inquiries in public and private libraries and collections. Before 1945 the technique of alloplastic reconstruction of the TMJ was mainly influenced by German and French surgeons. Reconstruction was limited to replacement of the condyle. The role of the TMJ within the orofacial system was not considered. Interposition of alloplastic implants, resection dressings and prostheses were the dominant technique. The main concerns were sterilisation, biocompatibility and implant fixation. No evidence-based data on outcomes are available from that time. By 1945 reconstruction of the TMJ involved the close cooperation of surgeons and dentists.",M2
19225083,"Comparison of three radiographic methods for detection of morphological temporomandibular joint changes: panoramic, scanographic and tomographic examination.OBJECTIVES: To compare the diagnostic accuracy of panoramic, scano- and tomographic examination for the detection of morphological temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) changes. METHODS: TMJs in 80 dry human skulls were radiographed using digital panoramic examination, 4x sagittal (lateral) scanography, and sagittal cross-sectional tomography. All images were examined by three independent observers for the presence or absence of flattening, defects and osteophytes in the various joint components. The true presence of the morphological changes was unanimously decided by consensus of three independent observers using naked-eye inspection. The accuracy for detection of the specific changes in each joint component was expressed as sensitivity and specificity values, whereas the accuracy for detection of morphological changes in general in the condyle and in the TMJ in toto was expressed as the number of matching radiographic and  gold standard  scores. RESULTS: Up to 23% and 9% of the three joint components were recorded as non-accessible to examination with panoramic examination and sagittal (lateral) scanography, respectively, whereas all components were accessible to examination with sagittal cross-sectional tomography. The difference was significant between panoramic examination and sagittal cross-sectional tomography (P = 0.018). No significant differences between the three methods for detection of specific morphological changes in the condyles and defects in the articular tubercles and changes in the TMJ in toto were found. CONCLUSION: No differences in accuracies between the methods were found for the detection of morphological TMJ changes. However, with panoramic examination and sagittal (lateral) scanography markedly more joint components were non-accessible to examination than with sagittal cross-sectional tomography, with which all components were accessible.",M2
19155105,"Current thinking in temporomandibular joint management.The management of temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) disorders in secondary care has progressed through the 1990s from a condition dealt with by generalists to one with an increasing number of surgeons with a subspecialist interest. Within this latter group there is a subgroup of those with a specific training towards joint replacement surgery. Increasingly patients who previously had surgery for pain are being managed with non-surgical options. Alternative pain management regimens with the introduction of botulinum toxin as well as tricyclic medication have reduced the need for any invasive management. The surgical management of the TMJ has been revolutionised by the introduction of arthroscopy in the late 1970s. The use of arthroscopy and arthrocentesis has lead to a reduction in indications for open joint surgery. There is no longer a perceived need to correct internal derangement with disc repositioning surgery. The primary management of acute restriction of opening and joint pain is now with arthrocentesis and arthroscopy. Degenerative and ankylotic conditions of the joint can be safely treated by the use of alloplastic joint replacement, which has less morbidity and more predictable outcomes than costochondral grafting, with the latter still the method of choice in children. The revolution continues with the introduction of national guidelines and databases supported by BAOMS.",M2

Ventura, CA) with maxillary osteotomies being performed at the same operation. All patients were operated at Baylor University Medical Center, Dallas TX, USA, by one surgeon (Wolford). Forty-seven females were studied; the average post-surgical follow-up was 40.6 months. Lateral cephalograms were analyzed to estimate surgical and post-surgical changes. During surgery, the occlusal plane angle decreased 14.9+/-8.0 degrees. The maxilla moved forward and upward. The posterior nasal spine moved downward and forward. The mandible advanced 7.9+/-3.5 mm at the lower incisor tips, 12.4+/-5.4 mm at Point B, 17.3+/-7.0 mm at menton, 18.4+/-8.5 mm at pogonion, and 11.0+/-5.3 mm at gonion. Vertically, the lower incisors moved upward -2.9+/-4.0 mm. At the longest follow-up post surgery, the maxilla showed minor horizontal changes while all mandibular measurements remained stable.

Cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 was one of the genes in FLS upregulated following stimulation by interleukin (IL)-1beta, a cytokine thought to play a key role in several pathological conditions. This study investigated the expression of COX-1 and COX-2 in cultured human FLS and rat TMJ synovium following stimulation with IL-1beta. METHODS: RNA was isolated from human FLS after IL-1beta treatment. COX-1 and -2 expression was examined using a GeneChip and real-time polymerase chain reaction. Prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) levels in conditioned media from FLS were measured using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Synovial tissues from TMJs of IL-1beta-injected rats were examined for COX-1 and COX-2 expression by immunohistochemical staining. RESULTS: Following treatment of FLS with IL-1beta, expression of the COX-2 gene increased up to 8 h and peaked at 4 h, whereas COX-1 expression did not change. Stimulation with IL-1beta increased the level of PGE(2) in conditioned media of cultured FLS in a time-dependent manner up to 48 h. Immunohistochemistry showed a strong positive staining for COX-2 in the lining and sub-lining synovial tissues of the TMJ of IL-1beta-injected rats. In contrast, staining for COX-1 was the same in synovial tissues with and without IL-1beta injection. CONCLUSION: These data suggest that COX-2 expression stimulated by IL-1beta stimulates the production of PGE(2) in FLS and plays important roles in the progression of inflammation in TMJ.",M2
19138604,"MRI findings of patients with temporomandibular joint internal derangement: before and after performance of arthrocentesis and stabilization splint.PURPOSES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) changes of patients with temporomandibular joint (<e>TMJ</e>) internal derangement before and after performance of arthrocentesis and stabilization splint therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Thirty-three patients with unilateral TMJ internal derangement that was successfully treated were included in this study. The clinical outcome and changes in the disc position, disc mobility, disc morphology, joint effusion, bone marrow edema pattern in the mandibular condyle, and the degenerative change before and after arthrocentesis and stabilization splint therapy were compared using MRI. RESULTS: The average maximum mouth opening (MMO) was increased and the average pain during MMO was decreased significantly after treatment. The disc position, disc mobility, and joint effusion were significantly improved after treatment. CONCLUSION: The results in this study indicate that arthrocentesis and stabilization splint therapy provide significant improvement in the clinical outcome, disc position, disc mobility and joint effusion.",M2

19177849,"Effect of occlusion on joint sounds in asymptomatic individuals.Occlusion is a predisposing factor for Temporomandibular Dysfunctions (TMD) of the joint, whose first sign and/or symptom is usually joint sound. To verify the effect of occlusion on joint sounds, temporomandibular joints (<e>TMJ</e>) were analyzed in 78 asymptomatic individuals with various dental conditions. Electrosonography was used to determine the intensity of the vibration in the temporomandibular joint (TMJ) on opening and closing the mouth. Transducers (piezoelectric accelerometer) were placed on the right and left joints. Results were tabled and analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis test (a=0.05). It was concluded that TMJ vibration in partly edentulous individuals from Kennedy classes I, II and III is statistically higher than in dentate and fully edentulous subjects.",M2
