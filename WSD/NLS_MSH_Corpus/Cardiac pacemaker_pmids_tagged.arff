20228256,"A novel quantitative explanation for the autonomic modulation of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cell automaticity via a dynamic system of sarcolemmal and intracellular proteins.Classical numerical models have attributed the regulation of normal cardiac automaticity in sinoatrial node cells (SANCs) largely to G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) modulation of sarcolemmal ion currents. More recent experimental evidence, however, has indicated that GPCR modulation of SANCs automaticity involves spontaneous, rhythmic, local Ca(2+) releases (LCRs) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR). We explored the GPCR rate modulation of SANCs using a unique and novel numerical model of SANCs in which Ca(2+)-release characteristics are graded by variations in the SR Ca(2+) pumping capability, mimicking the modulation by phospholamban regulated by cAMP-mediated, PKA-activated signaling. The model faithfully predicted the entire range of physiological chronotropic modulation of SANCs by the activation of beta-adrenergic receptors or cholinergic receptors only when experimentally documented changes of sarcolemmal ion channels are combined with a simultaneous increase/decrease in SR Ca(2+) pumping capability. The novel numerical mechanism of GPCR rate modulation is based on numerous complex synergistic interactions between sarcolemmal and intracellular processes via membrane voltage and Ca(2+). Major interactions include changes of diastolic Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger current that couple earlier/later diastolic Ca(2+) releases (predicting the experimentally defined LCR period shift) of increased/decreased amplitude (predicting changes in LCR signal mass, i.e., the product of LCR spatial size, amplitude, and number per cycle) to the diastolic depolarization and ultimately to the spontaneous action potential firing rate. Concomitantly, larger/smaller and more/less frequent activation of L-type Ca(2+) current shifts the cellular Ca(2+) balance to support the respective Ca(2+) cycling changes. In conclusion, our model simulations corroborate recent experimental results in rabbit SANCs pointing to a new paradigm for GPCR heart rate modulation by a complex system of dynamically coupled sarcolemmal and intracellular proteins.",M1
20203315,"A coupled SYSTEM of intracellular Ca2+ clocks and surface membrane voltage clocks controls the timekeeping mechanism of the heart's pacemaker.Ion channels on the surface membrane of sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells (SANCs) are the proximal cause of an action potential. Each individual channel type has been thoroughly characterized under voltage clamp, and the ensemble of the ion channel currents reconstructed in silico generates rhythmic action potentials. Thus, this ensemble can be envisioned as a surface  membrane clock  (M clock). Localized subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases are generated by the sarcoplasmic reticulum via ryanodine receptors during late diastolic depolarization and are referred to as an intracellular  Ca(2+) clock,  because their spontaneous occurrence is periodic during voltage clamp or in detergent-permeabilized SANCs, and in silico as well. In spontaneously firing SANCs, the M and Ca(2+) clocks do not operate in isolation but work together via numerous interactions modulated by membrane voltage, subsarcolemmal Ca(2+), and protein kinase A and CaMKII-dependent protein phosphorylation. Through these interactions, the 2 subsystem clocks become mutually entrained to form a robust, stable, coupled-clock system that drives normal <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cell automaticity. G protein-coupled receptors signaling creates pacemaker flexibility, ie, effects changes in the rhythmic action potential firing rate, by impacting on these very same factors that regulate robust basal coupled-clock system function. This review examines evidence that forms the basis of this coupled-clock system concept in cardiac SANCs.",M1
20133911,"Mapping <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> circuits: methodological puzzles of the sinoatrial node optical mapping.Historically, milestones in science are usually associated with methodological breakthroughs. Likewise, the advent of electrocardiography, microelectrode recordings and more recently optical mapping have ushered in new periods of significance of advancement in elucidating basic mechanisms in cardiac electrophysiology. As with any novel technique, however, data interpretation is challenging and should be approached with caution, as it cannot be simply extrapolated from previously used methodologies and with experience and time eventually becomes validated. A good example of this is the use of optical mapping in the sinoatrial node (SAN): when microelectrode and optical recordings are obtained from the same site in myocardium, significantly different results may be noted with respect to signal morphology and as a result have to be interpreted by a different set of principles. Given the rapid spread of the use of optical mapping, careful evaluation must be made in terms of methodology with respect to interpretation of data gathered by optical sensors from fluorescent potential-sensitive dyes. Different interpretations of experimental data may lead to different mechanistic conclusions. This review attempts to address the origin and interpretation of the  double component  morphology in the optical action potentials obtained from the SAN region. One view is that these 2 components represent distinctive signals from the SAN and atrial cells and can be fully separated with signal processing. A second view is that the first component preceding the phase 0 activation represents the membrane currents and intracellular calcium transients induced diastolic depolarization from the SAN. Although the consensus from both groups is that ionic mechanisms, namely the joint action of the membrane and calcium automaticity, are important in the SAN function, it is unresolved whether the double-component originates from the recording methodology or represents the underlying physiology. This overview aims to advance a common understanding of the basic principles of optical mapping in complex 3D anatomic structures.",M1
19837079,"Mesoangioblasts from ventricular vessels can differentiate in vitro into cardiac myocytes with sinoatrial-like properties.Cardiac mesoangioblasts (MABs) are a class of vessel-associated clonogenic, self-renewing progenitor cells, recently identified in the post-natal murine heart and committed to cardiac differentiation. Cardiomyocytes generated during cardiogenesis from progenitor cells acquire several distinct phenotypes, corresponding to different functional properties in diverse structures of the adult heart. Given the special functional relevance to rhythm generation and rate control of sinoatrial cells, and in view of their prospective use in therapeutical applications, we sought to determine if, and to what extent, cardiac mesoangioblasts could also differentiate into myocytes with properties typical of mature pacemaker myocytes. We report here that a subpopulation of cardiac mesoangioblasts, induced to differentiate in vitro into cardiomyocytes, do acquire a phenotype with specific mature pacemaker myocytes properties. These include expression of the HCN4 isoform of pacemaker ( funny , f-) channels and connexin 45 (Cx45), as well as reduced expression of inwardly-rectifying potassium channels. Furthermore, MAB-derived myocytes form agglomerates of pacing cells displaying stable rhythmic activity, and as in native <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells, f-channel modulation by autonomic transmitters contributes to control of spontaneous rate in differentiated mesoangioblasts. These data represent the first evidence for in vitro generation of pacemaker-like myocytes from proliferating non-embryonic stem/progenitor cells.",M1
19591835,"The <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> current.In mammals cardiac rate is determined by the duration of the diastolic depolarization of sinoatrial node (SAN) cells which is mainly determined by the pacemaker I(f) current. f-channels are encoded by four members of the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated gene (HCN1-4) family. HCN4 is the most abundant isoform in the SAN, and its relevance to pacemaking has been further supported by the discovery of four loss-of-function mutations in patients with mild or severe forms of cardiac rate disturbances. Due to its selective contribution to pacemaking, the I(f) current is also the pharmacological target of a selective heart rate-reducing agent (ivabradine) currently used in the clinical practice. Albeit to a minor extent, the I(f) current is also present in other spontaneously active myocytes of the cardiac conduction system (atrioventricular node and Purkinje fibres). In working atrial and ventricular myocytes f-channels are expressed at a very low level and do not play any physiological role; however in certain pathological conditions over-expression of HCN proteins may represent an arrhythmogenic mechanism. In this review some of the most recent findings on f/HCN channels contribution to pacemaking are described.",M1
19573534,"Regulation of basal and reserve <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> function by interactions of cAMP-mediated PKA-dependent Ca2+ cycling with surface membrane channels.Decades of intensive research of primary cardiac pacemaker, the sinoatrial node, have established potential roles of specific membrane channels in the generation of the diastolic depolarization, the major mechanism allowing sinoatrial node cells to generate spontaneous beating. During the last three decades, multiple studies made either in the isolated sinoatrial node or sinoatrial node cells have demonstrated a pivotal role of Ca(2+) and, specifically Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum, for spontaneous beating of cardiac pacemaker. Recently, spontaneous, rhythmic local subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases from ryanodine receptors during late half of the diastolic depolarization have been implicated as a vital factor in the generation of sinoatrial node cell spontaneous firing. Local Ca(2+) releases are driven by a unique combination of high basal cAMP production by adenylyl cyclases, high basal cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterases and a high level of cAMP-mediated PKA-dependent phosphorylation. These local Ca(2+) releases activate an inward Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange current which accelerates the terminal diastolic depolarization rate and, thus, controls the spontaneous pacemaker firing. Both the basal primary pacemaker beating rate and its modulation via beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation appear to be critically dependent upon intact RyR function and local subsarcolemmal sarcoplasmic reticulum generated Ca(2+) releases. This review aspires to integrate the traditional viewpoint that has emphasized the supremacy of the ensemble of surface membrane ion channels in spontaneous firing of the primary cardiac pacemaker, and these novel perspectives of cAMP-mediated PKA-dependent Ca(2+) cycling in regulation of the heart pacemaker clock, both in the basal state and during beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation.",M1
19477969,"The <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>-specific channel Hcn4 is a direct transcriptional target of MEF2.AIMS: Hcn4, which encodes the hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-sensitive channel (I(h)), is a well-established marker of the cardiac sino-atrial node. We aimed to identify cis-elements in the genomic locus of the Hcn4 gene that regulate the transcription of Hcn4. METHODS AND RESULTS: We screened evolutionarily conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs) that are often involved in the regulation of gene expression. The VISTA Enhancer Browser identified 16 regions, termed CNS 1-16, within the Hcn4 locus. Using the luciferase reporter assay in primary neonatal rat cardiomyocytes, we found that CNS13 conferred a prominent enhancer activity (more than 30-fold) on the Hcn4 promoter. Subsequent mutation analysis revealed that the Hcn4 enhancer function was dependent on myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF2) and activator protein-1 (AP1) binding sequences located in CNS13. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin immunoprecipitation confirmed that MEF2 and AP1 proteins bound CNS13. Furthermore, overexpression of a dominant negative MEF2 mutant inhibited the enhancer activity of CNS13, decreased Hcn4 mRNA expression and also decreased the amplitude of I(h) current in myocytes isolated from the inflow tract of embryonic heart. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the novel enhancer CNS13 and MEF2 may play a critical role in the transcription of Hcn4 in the heart.",M1
19376127,"Functional role of CLC-2 chloride inward rectifier channels in cardiac sinoatrial nodal pacemaker cells.A novel Cl(-) inward rectifier channel (Cl,ir) encoded by ClC-2, a member of the ClC voltage-gated Cl(-) channel gene superfamily, has been recently discovered in cardiac myocytes of several species. However, the physiological role of Cl,ir channels in the heart remains unknown. In this study we tested the hypothesis that Cl,ir channels may play an important role in <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> activity. In isolated guinea-pig sinoatrial node (SAN) cells, Cl,ir current was activated by hyperpolarization and hypotonic cell swelling. RT-PCR and immunohistological analyses confirmed the molecular expression of ClC-2 in guinea-pig SAN cells. Hypotonic stress increased the diastolic depolarization slope and decreased the maximum diastolic potential, action potential amplitude, APD(50), APD(90), and the cycle-length of the SAN cells. These effects were largely reversed by intracellular dialysis of anti-ClC-2 antibody, which significantly inhibited Cl,ir current but not other pacemaker currents, including the hyperpolarization-activated non-selective cationic  funny  current (I(f)), the L-type Ca(2+) currents (I(Ca,L)), the slowly-activating delayed rectifier I(Ks) and the volume-regulated outwardly-rectifying Cl(-) current (I(Cl,vol)). Telemetry electrocardiograph studies in conscious ClC-2 knockout (Clcn2(-/-)) mice revealed a decreased chronotropic response to acute exercise stress when compared to their age-matched Clcn2(+/+) and Clcn2(+/-) littermates. Targeted inactivation of ClC-2 does not alter intrinsic heart rate but prevented the positive chronotropic effect of acute exercise stress through a sympathetic regulation of ClC-2 channels. These results provide compelling evidence that ClC-2-encoded endogenous Cl,ir channels may play an important role in the regulation of cardiac pacemaker activity, which may become more prominent under stressed or pathological conditions.",M1
19289639,"Molecular architecture of the human sinus node: insights into the function of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>.BACKGROUND: Although we know much about the molecular makeup of the sinus node (SN) in small mammals, little is known about it in humans. The aims of the present study were to investigate the expression of ion channels in the human SN and to use the data to predict electrical activity. METHODS AND RESULTS: Quantitative polymerase chain reaction, in situ hybridization, and immunofluorescence were used to analyze 6 human tissue samples. Messenger RNA (mRNA) for 120 ion channels (and some related proteins) was measured in the SN, a novel paranodal area, and the right atrium (RA). The results showed, for example, that in the SN compared with the RA, there was a lower expression of Na(v)1.5, K(v)4.3, K(v)1.5, ERG, K(ir)2.1, K(ir)6.2, RyR2, SERCA2a, Cx40, and Cx43 mRNAs but a higher expression of Ca(v)1.3, Ca(v)3.1, HCN1, and HCN4 mRNAs. The expression pattern of many ion channels in the paranodal area was intermediate between that of the SN and RA; however, compared with the SN and RA, the paranodal area showed greater expression of K(v)4.2, K(ir)6.1, TASK1, SK2, and MiRP2. Expression of ion channel proteins was in agreement with expression of the corresponding mRNAs. The levels of mRNA in the SN, as a percentage of those in the RA, were used to estimate conductances of key ionic currents as a percentage of those in a mathematical model of human atrial action potential. The resulting SN model successfully produced pacemaking. CONCLUSIONS: Ion channels show a complex and heterogeneous pattern of expression in the SN, paranodal area, and RA in humans, and the expression pattern is appropriate to explain pacemaking.",M1
19181406,"Pacemaker activity of the human sinoatrial node: role of the hyperpolarization-activated current, I(f).The mechanism of primary, spontaneous <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> activity of the sinoatrial node (SAN) has extensively been studied in several animal species, but is virtually unexplored in man. Understanding the mechanisms of human SAN pacemaker activity is important for developing new therapeutic approaches for controlling the heart rate in the sick sinus syndrome and in diseased myocardium. Here we review the functional role of the hyperpolarization-activated 'funny' current, I(f), in human SAN pacemaker activity. Despite the many animal studies performed over the years, the contribution of I(f) to pacemaker activity is still controversial and not fully established. However, recent clinical data on mutations in the I(f) encoding HCN4 gene, which is thought to be the most abundant isoform of the HCN gene family in SAN, suggest a functional role of I(f) in human pacemaker activity. These clinical findings are supported by recent experimental data from single isolated human SAN cells that provide direct evidence that I(f) contributes to human SAN pacemaker activity. Therefore, controlling heart rate in clinical practice via I(f) blockers offers a valuable approach to lowering heart rate and provides an attractive alternative to conventional treatment for a wide range of patients with confirmed stable angina, while upregulation or artificial expression of I(f) may relieve disease-causing bradycardias.",M1
19166829,"Shox2 is essential for the differentiation of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells by repressing Nkx2-5.The pacemaker is composed of specialized cardiomyocytes located within the sinoatrial node (SAN), and is responsible for originating and regulating the heart beat. Recent advances towards understanding the SAN development have been made on the genetic control and gene interaction within this structure. Here we report that the Shox2 homeodomain transcription factor is restrictedly expressed in the sinus venosus region including the SAN and the sinus valves during embryonic heart development. Shox2 null mutation results in embryonic lethality due to cardiovascular defects, including an abnormal low heart beat rate (bradycardia) and severely hypoplastic SAN and sinus valves attributed to a significantly decreased level of cell proliferation. Genetically, the lack of Tbx3 and Hcn4 expression, along with ectopic activation of Nppa, Cx40, and Nkx2-5 in the Shox2(-/-) SAN region, indicates a failure in SAN differentiation. Furthermore, Shox2 overexpression in Xenopus embryos results in extensive repression of Nkx2-5 in the developing heart, leading to a reduced cardiac field and aberrant heart formation. Reporter gene expression assays provide additional evidence for the repression of Nkx2-5 promoter activity by Shox2. Taken together our results demonstrate that Shox2 plays an essential role in the SAN and pacemaker development by controlling a genetic cascade through the repression of Nkx2-5.",M1

19136600,"Synergism of coupled subsarcolemmal Ca2+ clocks and sarcolemmal voltage clocks confers robust and flexible pacemaker function in a novel pacemaker cell model.Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that sinoatrial node cells (SANC) generate spontaneous, rhythmic, local subsarcolemmal Ca(2+) releases (Ca(2+) clock), which occur during late diastolic depolarization (DD) and interact with the classic sarcolemmal voltage oscillator (membrane clock) by activating Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger current (I(NCX)). This and other interactions between clocks, however, are not captured by existing essentially membrane-delimited <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cell numerical models. Using wide-scale parametric analysis of classic formulations of membrane clock and Ca(2+) cycling, we have constructed and initially explored a prototype rabbit SANC model featuring both clocks. Our coupled oscillator system exhibits greater robustness and flexibility than membrane clock operating alone. Rhythmic spontaneous Ca(2+) releases of sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR)-based Ca(2+) clock ignite rhythmic action potentials via late DD I(NCX) over much broader ranges of membrane clock parameters [e.g., L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and/or hyperpolarization-activated ( funny ) current (I(f)) conductances]. The system Ca(2+) clock includes SR and sarcolemmal Ca(2+) fluxes, which optimize cell Ca(2+) balance to increase amplitudes of both SR Ca(2+) release and late DD I(NCX) as SR Ca(2+) pumping rate increases, resulting in a broad pacemaker rate modulation (1.8-4.6 Hz). In contrast, the rate modulation range via membrane clock parameters is substantially smaller when Ca(2+) clock is unchanged or lacking. When Ca(2+) clock is disabled, the system parametric space for fail-safe SANC operation considerably shrinks: without rhythmic late DD I(NCX) ignition signals membrane clock substantially slows, becomes dysrhythmic, or halts. In conclusion, the Ca(2+) clock is a new critical dimension in SANC function. A synergism of the coupled function of Ca(2+) and membrane clocks confers fail-safe SANC operation at greatly varying rates.",M1
18375576,"The missing link in the mystery of normal automaticity of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells.Earlier studies of the initiating event of normal automaticity of the heart's pacemaker cells, inspired by classical quantitative membrane theory, focused upon ion currents (IK, I f) that determine the maximum diastolic potential and the early phase of the spontaneous diastolic depolarization (DD). These early DD events are caused by the prior action potential (AP) and essentially reflect a membrane recovery process. Events following the recovery process that ignite APs have not been recognized and remained a mystery until recently. These critical events are linked to rhythmic intracellular signals initiated by Ca2+ clock (i.e., sarcoplasmic reticulum [SR] cycling Ca2+). Sinoatrial cells, regardless of size, exhibit intense ryanodine receptor (RyR), Na+/Ca2+ exchange (NCX)-1, and SR Ca2+ ATPase-2 immunolabeling and dense submembrane NCX/RyR colocalization; Ca2+ clocks generate spontaneous stochastic but roughly periodic local subsarcolemmal Ca2+ releases (LCR). LCRs generate inward currents via NCX that exponentially accelerate the late DD. The timing and amplitude of LCR/I NCX-coupled events control the timing and amplitude of the nonlinear terminal DD and therefore ultimately control the chronotropic state by determining the timing of the I CaL activation that initiates the next AP. LCR period is precisely controlled by the kinetics of SR Ca2+ cycling, which, in turn, are regulated by 1) the status of protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation of SR Ca2+ cycling proteins; and 2) membrane ion channels ensuring the Ca2+ homeostasis and therefore the Ca2+ available to Ca2+ clock. Thus, the link between early DD and next AP, missed in earlier studies, is ensured by a precisely physiologically regulated Ca2+ clock within pacemaker cells that integrates multiple Ca2+-dependent functions and rhythmically ignites APs during late DD via LCRs-I NCX coupling.",M1
19808392,"Distinguishing properties of cells from the myocardial sleeves of the pulmonary veins: a comparison of normal and abnormal pacemakers.BACKGROUND: A common source of arrhythmogenic spontaneous activity instigating atrial fibrillation is the myocardial tissue, or sleeves, at the base of the pulmonary veins. This study compared the properties of cells from the myocardial sleeves of the pulmonary veins (PV(m)) with cells from the normal <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> (the sinoatrial node) and regions of the atria. Our objective was to identify key features of these cells that predispose them to becoming the focus of cardiac arrhythmias. METHODS AND RESULTS: Single cells were isolated from samples of rabbit PV(m), central and peripheral sinoatrial node, crista terminalis, and left and right atria. Detailed morphology of cells was assessed and intracellular calcium concentrations measured with the use of Fluo-3. Cells from the PV(m) were smaller than atrial cells and showed large elevations in diastolic calcium during activation at physiological rates, a feature the PV(m) cells shared with cells from the sinoatrial node. Unstimulated spontaneous activity was observed in a minority of cells from the PV(m), but numerous cells from this region showed spontaneous activity for a brief period immediately subsequent to stimulation at physiological rates. This was not observed in atrial cells. Assessment of calcium removal pathways showed sarcolemmal calcium extrusion in cells from the PV(m) to have a high reliance on  slow  extrusion pathways to maintain intracellular calcium homeostasis because of a low expression of sodium-calcium exchanger. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that cells from the PV(m) share some features with cells from the sinoatrial node but also have distinctly unique features that predispose them to the development of spontaneous activity.",M1
18276917,"Constitutive phosphodiesterase activity restricts spontaneous beating rate of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells by suppressing local Ca2+ releases.Spontaneous beating of rabbit sinoatrial node cells (SANCs) is controlled by cAMP-mediated, protein kinase A-dependent local subsarcolemmal ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) releases (LCRs). LCRs activated an inward Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange current that increases the terminal diastolic depolarization rate and, therefore, the spontaneous SANC beating rate. Basal cAMP in SANCs is elevated, suggesting that cAMP degradation by phosphodiesterases (PDEs) may be low. Surprisingly, total suppression of PDE activity with a broad-spectrum PDE inhibitor, 3'-isobutylmethylxanthine (IBMX), produced a 9-fold increase in the cAMP level, doubled cAMP-mediated, protein kinase A-dependent phospholamban phosphorylation, and increased SANC firing rate by approximately 55%, indicating a high basal activity of PDEs in SANCs. A comparison of specific PDE1 to -5 inhibitors revealed that the specific PDE3 inhibitor, milrinone, accelerated spontaneous firing by approximately 47% (effects of others were minor) and increased amplitude of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca,L)) by approximately 46%, indicating that PDE3 was the major constitutively active PDE in the basal state. PDE-dependent control of the spontaneous SANC firing was critically dependent on subsarcolemmal LCRs, ie, PDE inhibition increased LCR amplitude and size and decreased LCR period, leading to earlier and augmented LCR Ca(2+) release, Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchange current, and an increase in the firing rate. When ryanodine receptors were disabled by ryanodine, neither IBMX nor milrinone was able to amplify LCRs, accelerate diastolic depolarization rate, or increase the SANC firing rate, despite preserved PDE inhibition-induced augmentation of I(Ca,L) amplitude. Thus, basal constitutive PDE activation provides a novel and powerful mechanism to decrease cAMP, limit cAMP-mediated, protein kinase A-dependent increase of diastolic ryanodine receptor Ca(2+) release, and restrict the spontaneous SANC beating rate.",M1
18006441,"Dynamic interactions of an intracellular Ca2+ clock and membrane ion channel clock underlie robust initiation and regulation of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> function.For almost half a century it has been thought that the initiation of each heartbeat is driven by surface membrane voltage-gated ion channels (M clocks) within sinoatrial nodal cells. It has also been assumed that pacemaker cell automaticity is initiated at the maximum diastolic potential (MDP). Recent experimental evidence based on confocal cell imaging and supported by numerical modelling, however, shows that initiation of cardiac impulse is a more complex phenomenon and involves yet another clock that resides under the sarcolemma. This clock is the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR): it generates spontaneous, but precisely timed, rhythmic, submembrane, local Ca(2+) releases (LCR) that appear not at the MDP but during the late, diastolic depolarization (DD). The Ca(2+) clock and M clock dynamically interact, defining a novel paradigm of robust cardiac pacemaker function and regulation. Rhythmic LCRs during the late DD activate inward Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger currents and ignite action potentials, which in turn induceCa(2+) transients and SR depletions, resetting the Ca(2+) clock. Both basal and reserve protein kinaseA-dependent phosphorylation of Ca(2+) cycling proteins control the speed and amplitude of SR Ca(2+) cycling to regulate the beating rate by strongly coupled Ca(2+) and M clocks.",M1

17932143,"The relevance of non-excitable cells for <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> function.Age-dependent changes in the architecture of the sinus node comprise an increasing ratio between fibroblasts and cardiomyocytes. This change is discussed as a potential mechanism for sinus node disease. The goal of this study was to determine the mechanism through which non-excitable cells influence the spontaneous activity of multicellular cardiomyocyte preparations. Cardiomyocyte monolayers (HL-1 cells) or embryonic stem cell-derived cardiomyocytes were used as two- and three-dimensional cardiac pacemaker models. Spontaneous activity and conduction velocity (theta) were monitored by field potential measurements with microelectrode arrays (MEAs). The influence of fibroblasts (WT-fibs) was determined in heterocellular cultures of different cardiomyocyte and fibroblast ratios. The relevance of heterocellular gap junctional coupling was evaluated by the use of fibroblasts deficient for the expression of Cx43 (Cx43(-/-)-fibs). The beating frequency and of heterocellular cultures depended negatively on the fibroblast concentration. Interspersion of fibroblasts in cardiomyocyte monolayers increased the coefficient of the interbeat interval variability. Whereas Cx43(-/-)-fibs decreased theta significantly less than WT-fibs, their effect on the beating frequency and the beat-to-beat variability seemed largely independent of their ability to establish intercellular coupling. These results suggest that electrically integrated, non-excitable cells modulate the excitability of cardiac pacemaker preparations by two distinct mechanisms, one dependent and the other independent of the heterocellular coupling established. Whereas heterocellular coupling enables the fibroblast to depolarize the cardiomyocytes or to act as a current sink, the mere physical separation of the cardiomyocytes by fibroblasts induces bradycardia through a reduction in frequency entrainment.",M1
17827062,"Normal heart rhythm is initiated and regulated by an intracellular calcium clock within pacemaker cells.For almost half a century it has been thought that the heart rhythm originates on the surface membrane of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells and is driven by voltage-gated ion channels (membrane clocks). Data from several recent studies, however, conclusively show that the rhythm is initiated, sustained, and regulated by oscillatory Ca(2+) releases (Ca(2+) clock) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum, a major Ca(2+) store within sinoatrial node cells, the primary heart's pacemakers. Activation of the local oscillatory Ca(2+) releases is independent of membrane depolarisation and driven by a high level of basal state phosphorylation of Ca(2+) cycling proteins. The releases produce Ca(2+) wavelets under the cell surface membrane during the later phase of diastolic depolarisation and activate the forward mode of Na(+)/Ca(2+) exchanger resulting in inward membrane current, which ignites an action potential. Phosphorylation-dependent gradation of speed at which Ca(2+) clock cycles is the essential regulatory mechanism of normal pacemaker rate and rhythm. The robust regulation of pacemaker function is insured by tight integration of Ca(2+) and membrane clocks: the action potential shape and ion fluxes are tuned by membrane clocks to sustain operation of the Ca(2+) clock which produces timely and powerful ignition of the membrane clocks to effect action potentials.",M1
17822952,"Store-operated Ca2+ entry and TRPC expression; possible roles in <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> tissue.Store-operated Ca(2+) channels (SOCCs) were first identified in non-excitable cells by the observation that depletion of Ca(2+) stores caused increased influx of extracellular Ca(2+). Recent studies have suggested that SOCCs might be related to the transient receptor potential (TRPC) gene family. The mechanism of cardiac pacemaking involves voltage-dependent pacemaker current; in addition there is growing evidence that intracellular sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) release plays an important role. In the present short review we assess preliminary evidence for Ca(2+) entry related to SR store depletion and expression of TRPCs in pacemaker tissue. These newer findings suggest that Ca(2+) entry and inward current triggered by store depletion might also contribute to the pacemaker current. Many hormones, drugs and interventions such as ischaemia and stretch, which alter Ca(2+) handling, will also modulate pacemaker firing thought their effect on SOCCs.",M1
17692005,"Molecular regulation and pharmacology of pacemaker channels.The spontaneous activity of cardiac tissue originates in specialized pacemaker cells in the sino-atrial node that generate autonomous rhythmic electrical impulses. A number of regions in the brain are also able to generate spontaneous rhythmic activity to control and regulate important physiological functions. The generation of pacemaker potentials relies on a complex interplay between different types of currents carried by cation channels. Among these currents, the hyperpolarization-activated current (termed I(f), <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>  funny  current, and I(h) in neurons) is the major component contributing to the initiation of cardiac and neuronal excitability and to the modulation of this excitability by neurotransmitters and hormones. I(f) is an inward current activated by hyperpolarization of the membrane potential and by intracellular cyclic nucleotides such as cAMP. The identification at the end of the 1990s of a family of mammalian genes that encode for four Hyperpolarization-activated Cyclic Nucleotide-gated channels, HCN1-4, has made analysis of the location of these channels and the study of their biophysical properties an obtainable goal. As a result, specific agents have been developed for their ability to selectively reduce heart rate by lowering cardiac pacemaker activity where f-channels are their main natural target. These drugs include alinidine, zatebradine, cilobradine, ZD-7288 and ivabradine. Recent data indicate that pharmacological tools such as W7 and genistein, which have been used to identify some intracellular pathways involved in ionic channel modulation, also have the ability to inhibit I(f) directly. This opens new perspectives for the future development of other specific rhythm-lowering agents.",M1
17543331,"Modulation of rate by autonomic agonists in SAN cells involves changes in diastolic depolarization and the pacemaker current.Two distinct intracellular mechanisms have been proposed to affect the firing rate of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells: one involves modulation of the I(f) current by the second messenger cAMP, and one relies upon disruption or alteration of SR Ca2+ transients during activity. Although both mechanisms are necessary for proper automaticity and autonomic rate control, the specific contribution of each to pacemaking is still debated. We investigated if the two processes can be separated based on potentially different effects on action potential characteristics during rate modulation. To identify specific I(f)-mediated effects, we used the selective I(f) blocker ivabradine and found that ivabradine (3 microM) slows rate (-16.2%) by selectively reducing (-31.9%) the steepness of early diastolic depolarization (EDD). On the other hand ryanodine (3 microM), used to evaluate the effects of abolishment of SR Ca2+ transients, slowed rate (-31.3%) by depolarizing the take-off potential (TOP, 18.1%) without affecting EDD. We therefore used these two parameters to identify I(f)-based or SR Ca2+ transients-based processes and analyzed the effects on action potential's characteristics of Rp-cAMPs (50 microM), a membrane permeable cAMP analogue directly activating f-channels; we found that Rp-cAMPs accelerates rate by increasing EDD (+42.3%) without modifying TOP. Finally, rate modulation was achieved by muscarinic (ACh 0.01 microM) or beta-adrenergic (Iso 1 microM) stimulation; in both cases, rate changes were associated with modifications of EDD (ACh, -29.3% and Iso, +47.6%) and not of TOP. We conclude that rate-related changes in the EDD induced by autonomic agonists are mediated by I(f) and not by processes involving SR Ca2+ transients.",M1
17413045,"Regulation of L-type calcium channel and delayed rectifier potassium channel activity by p21-activated kinase-1 in guinea pig sinoatrial node pacemaker cells.Phosphorylation of ion channels plays an important role in the regulation of cardiac function, but signaling mechanisms controlling dephosphorylation are not well understood. We have tested the hypothesis that p(21)-activated kinase-1 (Pak1), a serine-threonine protein kinase regulated by Ras-related small G proteins, regulates sinoatrial node (SAN) ion channel activity through a mechanism involving protein phosphatase 2A. We report a novel role of Pak1-mediated signaling in attenuating isoproterenol-induced enhancement of L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) and delayed rectifier potassium current (I(K)) in guinea pig SAN pacemaker cells. We demonstrate that in guinea pig SAN: (1) there is abundant expression of endogenous Pak1 in pacemaker cells; (2) expression of constitutively active Pak1 depresses isoproterenol-induced upregulation of I(CaL) and I(K); (3) inhibition of protein phosphatase 2A increases the enhancement of I(K) and I(CaL) by isoproterenol in Ad-Pak1-infected cells; (4) protein phosphatase 2A coimmunoprecipitates with endogenous Pak1 in SAN tissue; and (5) expression of constitutively active Pak1 suppresses the chronotropic action of isoproterenol on pacemaker activity of intact SAN preparations. In conclusion, our data demonstrate that a Pak1 signaling pathway exists in <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells and that this novel pathway plays a role in the regulation of ion channel activity.",M1
17339548,"Declining into failure: the age-dependent loss of the L-type calcium channel within the sinoatrial node.BACKGROUND: The spontaneous activity of pacemaker cells in the sinoatrial (SA) node controls heart rate under normal physiological conditions. Clinical studies have shown the incidence of SA node dysfunction increases with age and occurs with peak prevalence in the elderly population. The present study investigated whether aging affected the expression of Ca(v)1.2 channels and whether these changes could affect pacemaker activity, in turn leading to age-related SA node degeneration. METHODS AND RESULTS: The SA node region was isolated from the right atrium of guinea pigs between birth and 38 months of age. Immunofluorescence studies showed Ca(v)1.2 protein was present as punctate labeling around the outer membrane of atrial cells but was absent from the center of the SA node. The area lacking Ca(v)1.2-labeled protein progressively increased from 2.06+/-0.1 (mean+/-SEM) mm2 at 1 month to 18.72+/-2.2 mm2 at 38 months (P&lt;0.001). Western blot provided verification that Ca(v)1.2 protein expression within the SA node declined during aging. Functional measurements showed an increased sensitivity to the L-type calcium blocker nifedipine; SA node preparations stopped beating in 100 micromol/L nifedipine at 1 day old, compared with 30 micromol/L at 1 month and 10 micromol/L at 38 months of age. Furthermore, the amplitude of extracellular potentials declined within the center and periphery of the SA node during aging. CONCLUSIONS: The present data show Ca(v)1.2 channel protein decreases concurrently with reduced spontaneous activity of the SA node with increased age, which provides further evidence of mechanisms underlying the age-related deterioration of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>.",M1

Because of these specific functions, a search for molecules able to interfere selectively with the 'funny' current was undertaken soon after its discovery, with the aim of developing tools for the pharmacological control of heart rate. This search has succeeded in generating a new class of drugs, the heart rate-reducing agents, which act through specific blockade of f-channels; one of these drugs, ivabradine, is presently marketed against stable angina.

17073608,"Heart rate lowering by inhibition of the pacemaker current: a new therapeutic perspective in cardiovascular disease.Several studies have demonstrated that resting heart rate is an important correlate of cardiovascular and all-cause mortality and that the mortality benefit of some cardiovascular drugs seems to be related in part to their heart rate-lowering effects. Since the currently available classes of drugs with heart-rate lowering effect (e.g. beta-blockers and calcium channel antagonists) also exert multiple structural and functional actions on the cardiovascular system, which may be in some cases undesired, the introduction of a new class of agents exclusively affecting the pacemaker activity of the sinus node is of particular interest. The first molecule of this class - sinus node modulators or I(f)-current inhibitors - to reach clinical application is ivabradine. <e>Cardiac pacemaker</e> cells generate a spontaneous slow diastolic depolarisation that drives the membrane voltage away from a hyperpolarised level towards the threshold level for initiating a subsequent action potential, generating rhythmic action potentials that propagate through the heart and trigger myocardial contraction. The I(f) current is an inward ionic current that determines the slope of diastolic depolarisation, which in turn controls the heart beating rate. Extensive work has amply demonstrated its involvement in the generation of spontaneous activity. The molecular basis of the generation of the pacemaker current was landmarked by the cloning of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels, which constitute the structural units of the f-channels. This review addresses the major basic properties of cardiac f-channels, with a focus on the mode of action of I(f)-current inhibitors and outlines the therapeutic implications of the existing research data.",M1
16877551,"Computational evaluation of the roles of Na+ current, iNa, and cell death in cardiac pacemaking and driving.Voltage-dependent sodium (Na(+)) channels are heterogeneously distributed through the pacemaker of the heart, the sinoatrial node (SA node). The measured sodium channel current (i(Na)) density is higher in the periphery but low or zero in the center of the SA node. The functional roles of i(Na) in initiation and conduction of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> activity remain uncertain. We evaluated the functional roles of i(Na) by computer modeling. A gradient model of the intact SA node and atrium of the rabbit heart was developed that incorporates both heterogeneities of the SA node electrophysiology and histological structure. Our computations show that a large i(Na) in the periphery helps the SA node to drive the atrial muscle. Removal i(Na) from the SA node slows down the pacemaking rate and increases the sinoatrial node-atrium conduction time. In some cases, reduction of the SA node i(Na) results in impairment of impulse initiation and conduction that leads to the SA node-atrium conduction exit block. Decrease in active SA node cell population has similar effects. Combined actions of reduced cell population and removal of i(Na) from the SA node have greater impacts on weakening the ability of the SA node to pace and drive the atrium.",M1
16847148,"Remodeling of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> L-type calcium current and its beta-adrenergic responsiveness in hypertension after neuronal NO synthase gene transfer.Hypertension is associated with abnormal neurohumoral activation. We tested the hypothesis that beta-adrenergic hyperresponsiveness in the sinoatrial node (SAN) of the spontaneously hypertensive rat occurs at the level of the L-type calcium current because of altered cyclic nucleotide-dependent signaling. Furthermore, we hypothesized that NO, a modulator of cGMP and cAMP, would normalize the beta-adrenergic phenotype in the hypertensive rat. Chronotropic responsiveness to norepinephrine (NE), together with production of cAMP and cGMP, was assessed in isolated atrial preparations from age-matched hypertensive and normotensive rats. Right atrial/SAN pacemaking tissue was injected with adenovirus encoding enhanced green fluorescent protein (control vector) or neuronal NO synthase (nNOS). In addition, L-type calcium current was measured in cells isolated from the SAN of transfected animals. Basal levels of cGMP were lower in hypertensive rat atria. These atria were hyperresponsive to NE at all of the concentrations tested, with elevated production of cAMP. This was accompanied by increased basal and norepinephrine-stimulated L-type calcium current. Using enhanced green fluorescent protein, we observed transgene expression within both tissue sections and isolated pacemaking cells. Adenoviral nNOS increased right atrial nNOS protein expression and cGMP content. NE-stimulated cAMP concentration and L-type calcium current were also attenuated by adenoviral nNOS, along with the chronotropic responsiveness to NE in hypertensive rat atria. Decreased calcium current after cardiac nNOS gene transfer contributes to the normalization of beta-adrenergic hyperresponsiveness in the SAN from hypertensive rats by modulating cyclic nucleotide signaling.",M1
16838059,"Considerations on the sinus node microangioarchitecture.The importance of the sinus node as the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> is well known. The aim of the present study was to investigate the microangioarchitecture at the level of the sinus node. Ten human adult hearts were injected with India ink in the initial segments of the coronary arteries. Pieces were drawn and diaphanized. The results of the study can be summarized: (1) the sinus node is rather an irregularly shaped structure, with peripheral strands intermingling with strands of the atrial myocardium; at this level two vascular patterns can be recognized: (a) the myocardial capillary networks that parallels the muscular bundles, and (b) the peripheral nodal networks built upon dichotomizing arterioles; (2) it seems that while the thick and large sinus node artery does not branch in the nodal tissue, the blood supply of this tissue is ensured by the peripheral nodal networks; (3) characteristically, in the periphery of the nodal tissue are largely present glomeruli made by capillaries with pericellular dispositions. The results strongly suggest that the nodal tissue is mainly supplied from its periphery and the sinus node artery is rather a scaffold than a supplier of that tissue.",M1

Clinical proof of the antianginal efficacy and tolerability of ivabradine comes from the largest clinical development programme that has ever been performed in stable angina, involving more than 5000 patients.

16485745,"A comparison of 1-D models of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> heterogeneity.In this paper, we investigate the role of sinoatrial node (SAN) cellular heterogeneity in two key aspects of normal cardiac pacemaker function: frequency entrainment of the SAN, and propagation of excitation into the atrial tissue. Using detailed ionic models of electrical activity in SAN and atrial myocytes, we have formulated a number of one-dimensional models of SAN heterogeneity based on discrete-region (in which central and peripheral SAN type cell are separated into discrete regions), gradient and mosaic models of SAN organization. Each of the different models were assessed on their ability to achieve frequency entrainment of the SAN and activation of the adjoining atrial tissue in the presence of both uniform and linearly increasing conductivity profiles. Simulation results suggest that the gradient model of SAN heterogeneity, in which cells display a smooth variation in membrane properties from the center to the periphery of the SAN, produces action potential waveshapes and a site of earliest activation consistent with experimental observations in the intact SAN. The gradient model also achieves frequency entrainment of the SAN more easily than other models of SAN heterogeneity. Based on these results, we conclude that the gradient model of SAN heterogeneity, in the presence of a uniform conductivity profile, is the most likely model of SAN organization.",M1
16424365,"High basal protein kinase A-dependent phosphorylation drives rhythmic internal Ca2+ store oscillations and spontaneous beating of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells.Local, rhythmic, subsarcolemmal Ca2+ releases (LCRs) from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) during diastolic depolarization in sinoatrial nodal cells (SANC) occur even in the basal state and activate an inward Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger current that affects spontaneous beating. Why SANC can generate spontaneous LCRs under basal conditions, whereas ventricular cells cannot, has not previously been explained. Here we show that a high basal cAMP level of isolated rabbit SANC and its attendant increase in protein kinase A (PKA)-dependent phosphorylation are obligatory for the occurrence of spontaneous, basal LCRs and for spontaneous beating. Gradations in basal PKA activity, indexed by gradations in phospholamban phosphorylation effected by a specific PKA inhibitory peptide were highly correlated with concomitant gradations in LCR spatiotemporal synchronization and phase, as well as beating rate. Higher levels of basal PKA inhibition abolish LCRs and spontaneous beating ceases. Stimulation of beta-adrenergic receptors extends the range of PKA-dependent control of LCRs and beating rate beyond that in the basal state. The link between SR Ca2+ cycling and beating rate is also present in vivo, as the regulation of beating rate by local beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation of the sinoatrial node in intact dogs is markedly blunted when SR Ca2+ cycling is disrupted by ryanodine. Thus, PKA-dependent phosphorylation of proteins that regulate cell Ca2+ balance and spontaneous SR Ca2+ cycling, ie, phospholamban and L-type Ca2+ channels (and likely others not measured in this study), controls the phase and size of LCRs and the resultant Na(+)-Ca2+ exchanger current and is crucial for both basal and reserve cardiac pacemaker function.",M1

16004681,"<e>Cardiac pacemaker</e> I(f) current and its inhibition by heart rate-reducing agents.The 'funny' (I(f)) current, first described by Brown et al. in 1979 in pacemaker myocytes, is an inward current that slowly activates on hyperpolarization to the diastolic range of voltages. Extensive work has amply demonstrated its involvement in the generation of spontaneous activity. The extent of current activation determines the slope of diastolic depolarization and hence of pacemaker rate. Since I(f) is under cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP)-mediated control by beta-adrenergic and muscarinic stimulation, this mechanism underlies neurotransmitter modulation of cardiac rate and is therefore of fundamental physiological relevance. Their key role in pacemaking makes f-channels a natural target for drugs aiming at regulation of pacemaker activity and cardiac rate. Both in the past and more recently, rate-reducing drugs that slow pacemaker activity by decreasing the rate of diastolic depolarization have been developed. These drugs act as specific f-channel inhibitors. One of the latest such molecules developed, ivabradine, has a highly specific inhibitory action on f-channels, which atypically depends on the current flow across the channel. These specific properties make the I(f) inhibition by ivabradine 'use-dependent,' a therapeutically beneficial property. Investigation of the interaction between rate-reducing molecules and specific regions of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotidegated (HCN) channels, the molecular components of native f-channels, will provide new strategies for more specific and efficient drug design.

Compared to working myocardial cells, pacemaker cells express a specific array of ionic channels. The functional importance of different ionic channels in the generation and regulation of cardiac automaticity is currently subject of an extensive research effort and has long been controversial. Among families of ionic channels, Ca(2+) channels have been proposed to substantially contribute to pacemaking. Indeed, Ca(2+) channels are robustly expressed in pacemaker cells, and influence the cell beating rate. Furthermore, they are regulated by the activity of the autonomic nervous system in both a positive and negative way. In this manuscript, we will first discuss how the concept of the involvement of Ca(2+) channels in cardiac pacemaking has been proposed and then subsequently developed by the recent advent in the domain of cardiac physiology of gene-targeting techniques. Secondly, we will indicate how the specific profile of Ca(2+) channels expression in pacemaker tissue can help design drugs which selectively regulate the heart rhythm in the absence of concomitant negative inotropism. Finally, we will indicate how the new possibility to assign a specific gene activity to a given ionic channel involved in cardiac pacemaking could implement the current postgenomic research effort in the construction of the cardiac Physiome.",M1
15963351,"Physiology and pharmacology of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> ( funny ) current.First described over a quarter of a century ago, the cardiac pacemaker  funny  (I(f)) current has been extensively characterized since, and its role in cardiac pacemaking has been thoroughly demonstrated. A similar current, termed I(h), was later described in different types of neurons, where it has a variety of functions and contributes to the control of cell excitability and plasticity. I(f) is an inward current activated by both voltage hyperpolarization and intracellular cAMP. In the heart, as well as generating spontaneous activity, f-channels mediate autonomic-dependent modulation of heart rate: beta-adrenergic stimulation accelerates, and vagal stimulation slows, cardiac rate by increasing and decreasing, respectively, the intracellular cAMP concentration and, consequently, the f-channel degree of activation. Four isoforms of hyperpolarization-activated, cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels have been cloned more recently and shown to be the molecular correlates of native f-channels in the heart and h-channels in the brain. Individual HCN isoforms have kinetic and modulatory properties which differ quantitatively. A comparison of their biophysical properties with those of native pacemaker channels provides insight into the molecular basis of the pacemaker current properties and, together with immunolabelling and other detection techniques, gives information on the pattern of HCN isoform distribution in different tissues. Because of their relevance to cardiac pacemaker activity, f-channels are a natural target of drugs aimed at the pharmacological control of heart rate. Several agents developed for their ability to selectively reduce heart rate act by a specific inhibition of f-channel function; these substances have a potential for the treatment of diseases such as angina and heart failure. In the near future, devices based on the delivery of f-channels in situ, or of a cellular source of f-channels (biological pacemakers), will likely be developed for use in therapies for diseases of heart rhythm with the aim of replacing electronic pacemakers.",M1
15644313,"An arginine residue in the pore region is a key determinant of chloride dependence in <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> channels.The modulation of ion channel activity by extracellular ions plays a central role in the control of heart function. Here, we show that the sinoatrial pacemaker current I(f) is strongly affected by the extracellular Cl- concentration. We investigated the molecular basis of the Cl- dependence in heterologously expressed hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels that represent the molecular correlate of I(f). Currents carried by the two cardiac HCN channel isoforms (HCN2 and HCN4) showed the same strong Cl- dependence as the sinoatrial I(f) and decreased to about 10% in the absence of external Cl-. In contrast, the neuronal HCN1 current was reduced to only 50% under the same conditions. Depletion of Cl- did not affect the voltage dependence of activation or the ion selectivity of the channels, indicating that the reduction of I(f) was caused by a decrease of channel conductance. A series of chimeras between HCN1 and HCN2 was constructed to identify the structural determinants underlying the different Cl- dependence of HCN1 and HCN2. Exchange of the ion-conducting pore region was sufficient to switch the Cl- dependence from HCN1- to HCN2-type and vice versa. Replacement of a single alanine residue in the pore of HCN1 (Ala-352) by an arginine residue present in HCN2 at equivalent position (Arg-405) induced HCN2-type chloride sensitivity in HCN1.

During metamorphosis the MN-1 in segments 7 and 8 undergoes dendritic reorganization. Long new dendrites extend anteriorly in the terminal ganglion neuropil. Intracellular and extracellular recordings showed that broader action potentials, increased firing rate, and development of a bursting activity pattern accompany MN-1 respecification. Cardiac mechanograms showed that MN-1 activity bursts always correlate with the anterograde cardiac beat. Bilateral MNs-1 fire at similar times to activate and sustain the putative cardiac pacemaker activity of the terminal chamber synergistically. After remodeling, MN-1 output could be influenced rapidly by sensory inputs during evoked cardiac reversal.

Guinea-pigs were studied throughout their lifespan (i.e. birth to 38 months) to investigate the possible mechanism leading to nodal dysfunction. Using immunofluorescence with confocal microscopy, Cx43 protein expression was shown at birth to be present throughout the sinoatrial node and atrial muscle, however, at one month Cx43 protein was not expressed in the centre of the sinoatrial node. Throughout the remainder of the animal's lifespan the area of tissue lacking Cx43 protein progressively increased. Western blot provided verification by quantitative analysis that Cx43 protein expression within the sinoatrial node decreased with age; however, the expression of other cardiac connexins, Cx40 and Cx45, did not differ with age. Analysis of conduction maps showing propagation of the action potential across the sinoatrial node, from the initiation point to the crista terminalis, found that the action potential conduction time taken and conduction distance increased proportionally with age; conversely the conduction velocity decreased with age.

State transition rates are given by non-linear sigmoid functions of membrane potential. By appropriate selection of parameters, the generic model is able to accurately reproduce a wide range of action potential waveforms observed experimentally. Specifically, the model can fit recordings from central and peripheral regions of the SAN with RMS errors of 0.3987 and 0.7628 m V, respectively. Using a custom least squares parameter optimisation routine, we have constructed a spatially-varying gradient model that exhibits a smooth transition in action potential characteristics from the central to the peripheral region, whilst ensuring individual membrane currents remain physiologically accurate. Smooth transition action potential characteristics include maximum diastolic potential, overshoot potential, upstroke velocity, action potential duration and cycle length.

14695028,"Sino-atrial nodal cells of mammalian hearts: ionic currents and gene expression of pacemaker ionic channels.The <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> is a sino-atrial (SA) nodal cell. The signal induced by this pacemaker is distributed over the heart surface by a specialised conduction system and is clinically recorded as the ECG. The SA nodal cells are highly resistant to cardiac failure and ischemia. Under calcium overload conditions, some dysrythmias of SA nodal cells occur easily. Morphological analysis under these conditions shows swelling of the cisternae of the Golgi apparatus, with little or no other histological change or damage being observed. The rate of sinus rhythm is quite different between various species. The investigations of SA nodal cells have so far clarified the pacemaker mechanisms involved. A number of ionic channel currents or pacemaker currents, contribute to the depolarization of the pacemaker potential (phase 4). This will not occur with a single current. Recent experiments have identified several novel pacemaker currents and have also revealed several differences in the pacemaker currents between species. The marked hyperpolarization-activated inward current (I(f)) appears in SA nodal cells of most species, while the inwardly rectifying K+ current (I(K1)) with masked I(f) current is found in those of the rat and monkey. In addition, the rapidly activated current (I(Kr)) and slowly activated current (I(Ks)) of the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(K)) contribute to the pacemaker potential in guinea pig SA nodal cells, with only the I(Ks) current in porcine SA nodal cells and only the I(Kr) current in the rat and rabbit. These differences in ionic channels presumably result from differences in gene expression. Some smooth muscle cells also possess the capacity to beat spontaneously. Uterine smooth muscle cells also exhibit an I(f) current. The basal mechanism for spontaneous activity in both SA nodal cells and smooth muscle cells is almost the same, but some differences in the ionic channels and their genetic expression may contribute to their respective pacemaker currents.",M1

These drugs reduce dose dependently the amplitude of the If, without modifying either the voltage dependence or the kinetics of channel activation. When voltage-clamp pulse trains were applied, cilobradine induced a use-dependent blockade of If that was stronger and faster than that with zatebradine. Recovery from blockade during prolonged hyperpolarization was significantly faster with zatebradine. Presumably, both drugs block the hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channel by gaining access to a binding site within the open channel pore, and are removed from the blocking site by strong hyperpolarization with large inward If through the open channel. Cilobradine, compared to zatebradine blocks If more effectively and faster in both preparations. Consequently cilobradine strongly reduces the pacemaker diastolic depolarization rate and the cell's firing frequency.",M1

In study one, the right cardiac sympathetic nerves were isolated as they exit the stellate ganglion and were stimulated to produce graded (low, 20-30 bpm; high 40-50 bpm) increases in heart rate (HR). LE (1.5 nmoles/min) was added to the dialysis inflow and the sympathetic stimulations were repeated after 5 and 20 min of LE infusion. After 5 min, LE reduced the tachycardia during sympathetic stimulation at both low (18.2 +/- 1.3 bpm to 11.4 +/- 1.4 bpm) and high (45 +/- 1.5 bpm to 22.8 +/- 1.5 bpm) frequency stimulations. The inhibition was maintained during 20 min of continuous LE exposure with no evidence of opioid desensitization.

Nodal delta-receptors are vagolytic and vagal stimulations were included in the protocol as positive controls. LE reduced vagal bradycardia by 50% and naltrindole completely restored the vagal bradycardia. In Study 2, additional opioid antagonists were used to determine if alternative opioid receptors might be implicated in the sympatholytic response. Increasing doses of the kappa-antagonist, norbinaltorphimine (norBNI), were combined with LE during sympathetic stimulation. NorBNI completely restored the sympathetic tachycardia with an ED50 of 0.01 nmoles/min. A single dose of the micro -antagonist, CTAP (1.0 nmoles/min), failed to alter the sympatholytic effect of LE. Study 3 was conducted to determine if the sympatholytic effect was prejunctional or postjunctional in character. Norepinephrine was added to the dialysis inflow at a rate (30-45 pmoles/min) sufficient to produce intermediate increases (35.2 +/- 1.8 bpm) in HR. LE was then combined with norepinephrine and responses were recorded at 5-min intervals for 20 min. The tachycardia mediated by added norepinephrine was unaltered by LE or LE plus naltrindole. At the same 5-min intervals, LE reduced vagal bradycardia by more than 50%. This vagolytic effect was again completely reversed by naltrindole. Collectively, these observations support the hypothesis that the local nodal sympatholytic effect of LE was mediated by kappa-opioid receptors that reduced the effective interstitial concentration of norepinephrine and not the result of a postjunctional interaction between LE and norepinephrine.",M1

However, disruption of Ca(2+) release from sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) by ryanodine (Ry) has been recently shown to slow spontaneous rate and inhibit beta-adrenergic receptor (betaAR)-induced rate acceleration, leading to the suggestion that the target of betaAR modulation of pacemaking is the intracellular Ca(2+)-regulatory process. We have investigated whether the Ry-induced decrease of betaAR rate modulation alternatively involves disruption of the betaAR-adenylate-cyclase-cAMP-I(f) mechanism. Prolonged exposure to Ry (3 microM, &gt;2 min) slowed spontaneous rate of pacemaker cells by 29.8% via a depolarizing shift of take-off potential (TOP) without significantly changing early diastolic depolarization rate. Ry depressed rate acceleration caused by isoproterenol (Iso) (1 microM, 23.6% in control vs. 8.0%), but did not modify that caused by two membrane-permeable cAMP analogs, CPT-cAMP (300 microM, 17.7% vs. 17.3%) and Rp-cAMPs (50 microM, 18.0% vs. 20.6%). Consistent with the rate effect, exposure to Ry decreased the shift induced by Iso, but not that induced by either cAMP analog on the I(f)-activation curve. We conclude that disruption of Ry receptor function and SR Ca(2+) release depresses betaAR-induced modulation of heart rate, but does not impair cAMP-dependent rate acceleration mediated by I(f). However, abolishment of normal Ca(2+) homeostasis may result in the failure of betaAR agonists to sufficiently elevate cAMP near f-channels. The molecular basis for Ca(2+)-dependent interference in beta-adrenergic signaling remains to be determined.",M1
12700358,"Functional role of L-type Cav1.3 Ca2+ channels in <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> activity.The spontaneous activity of pacemaker cells in the sino-atrial node (SAN) controls the heart rhythm and rate under physiological conditions. Pacemaker activity in SAN cells is due to the presence of the diastolic depolarization, a slow depolarization phase that drives the membrane voltage from the end of an action potential to the threshold of a new action potential. SAN cells express a wide array of ionic channels, but we have limited knowledge about their functional role in pacemaker activity and we still do not know which channels play a prominent role in the generation of the diastolic depolarization. It is thus important to provide genetic evidence linking the activity of genes coding for ionic channels to specific alterations of pacemaker activity of SAN cells. Here, we show that target inactivation of the gene coding for alpha(1D) (Ca(v)1.3) Ca(2+) channels in the mouse not only significantly slows pacemaker activity but also promotes spontaneous arrhythmia in SAN pacemaker cells. These alterations of pacemaker activity are linked to abolition of the major component of the L-type current (I(Ca,L)) activating at negative voltages. Pharmacological analysis of I(Ca,L) demonstrates that Ca(v)1.3 gene inactivation specifically abolishes I(Ca,L) in the voltage range corresponding to the diastolic depolarization. Taken together, our data demonstrate that Ca(v)1.3 channels play a major role in the generation of cardiac pacemaker activity by contributing to diastolic depolarization in SAN pacemaker cells.",M1
12514127,"Absence epilepsy and sinus dysrhythmia in mice lacking the pacemaker channel HCN2.Hyperpolarization-activated cation (HCN) channels are believed to be involved in the generation of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> depolarizations as well as in the control of neuronal excitability and plasticity. The contributions of the four individual HCN channel isoforms (HCN1-4) to these diverse functions are not known. Here we show that HCN2-deficient mice exhibit spontaneous absence seizures. The thalamocortical relay neurons of these mice displayed a near complete loss of the HCN current, resulting in a pronounced hyperpolarizing shift of the resting membrane potential, an altered response to depolarizing inputs and an increased susceptibility for oscillations. HCN2-null mice also displayed cardiac sinus dysrhythmia, a reduction of the sinoatrial HCN current and a shift of the maximum diastolic potential to hyperpolarized values. Mice with cardiomyocyte- specific deletion of HCN2 displayed the same dysrhythmia as mice lacking HCN2 globally, indicating that the dysrhythmia is indeed caused by sinoatrial dysfunction. Our results define the physiological role of the HCN2 subunit as a major determinant of membrane resting potential that is required for regular cardiac and neuronal rhythmicity.",M1

The free-running cycle length of the cell models was perturbed using two independent techniques and the minimum coupling conductance required to achieve frequency entrainment was used to assess the relative ease with which various cell pairs achieve entrainment. The factors effecting entrainment were further investigated using single-cell models paced with an artificial biphasic coupling current. Our simulation results suggest that dissimilar cell types, those with largely different upstroke velocities entrain more easily, that is, they require less coupling conductance to achieve 1:1 frequency entrainment. We, therefore, propose that regional variation in action-potential waveshape within the sinoatrial node assists frequency synchronization in vivo.",M1
11328811,"Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 1 is a molecular determinant of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> current I(f).The pacemaker current I(f) of the sinoatrial node (SAN) is a major determinant of cardiac diastolic depolarization and plays a key role in controlling heart rate and its modulation by neurotransmitters. Substantial expression of two different mRNAs (HCN4, HCN1) of the family of pacemaker channels (HCN) is found in rabbit SAN, suggesting that the native channels may be formed by different isoforms. Here we report the cloning and heterologous expression of HCN1 from rabbit SAN and its specific localization in pacemaker myocytes. rbHCN1 is an 822-amino acid protein that, in human embryonic kidney 293 cells, displayed electrophysiological properties similar to those of I(f), suggesting that HCN1 can form a pacemaker channel. The presence of HCN1 in the SAN myocytes but not in nearby heart regions, and the electrophysiological properties of the channels formed by it, suggest that HCN1 plays a central and specific role in the formation of SAN pacemaker currents.",M1
11055979,"Sinoatrial node pacemaker activity requires Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activation.Cardiac beating arises from the spontaneous rhythmic excitation of sinoatrial (SA) node cells. Here we report that SA node pacemaker activity is critically dependent on Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). In freshly dissociated rabbit single SA node cells, inhibition of CaMKII by a specific peptide inhibitor, autocamtide-2 inhibitory peptide (AIP, 10 micromol/L), or by KN-93 (0.1 to 3.0 micromol/L), but not its inactive analog, KN-92, depressed the rate and amplitude of spontaneous action potentials (APs) in a dose-dependent manner. Strikingly, 10 micromol/L AIP and 3 micromol/L KN-93 completely arrested SA node cells, which indicates that basal CaMKII activation is obligatory to the genesis of pacemaker AP. To understand the ionic mechanisms of the CaMKII effects, we measured L-type Ca(2+) current (I(Ca, L)), which contributes both to AP upstroke and to pacemaker depolarization. KN-93 (1 micromol/L), but not its inactive analog, KN-92, decreased I:(Ca, L) amplitude from 12+/-2 to 6+/-1 pA/pF without altering the shape of the current-voltage relationship. Both AIP and KN-93 shifted the midpoint of the steady-state inactivation curve leftward and markedly slowed the recovery of I(Ca, L) from inactivation. Similar results were observed using the fast Ca(2+) chelator BAPTA, whereas the slow Ca(2+) chelator EGTA had no significant effect, which suggests that CaMKII activity is preferentially regulated by local Ca(2+) transients. Indeed, confocal immunocytochemical imaging showed that active CaMKII is highly localized beneath the surface membrane in the vicinity of L-type channels and that AIP and KN-93 significantly reduced CaMKII activity. Thus, we conclude that CaMKII plays a vital role in regulating <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> activity mainly via modulating I(Ca, L) inactivation and reactivation, and local Ca(2+) is critically involved in these processes.",M1

Their relative contribution to total L-type Ca2+ currents and their physiological role and significance as a drug target remain unknown. Therefore, we generated D-LTCC deficient mice (alpha1D-/-) that were viable with no major disturbances of glucose metabolism. alpha1D-/-mice were deaf due to the complete absence of L-type currents in cochlear inner hair cells and degeneration of outer and inner hair cells. In wild-type controls, D-LTCC-mediated currents showed low activation thresholds and slow inactivation kinetics.

We conclude that alpha1D can form LTCCs with negative activation thresholds essential for normal auditory function and control of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> activity.",M1
10903990,"Sustained inward current during pacemaker depolarization in mammalian sinoatrial node cells.Several time- and voltage-dependent ionic currents have been identified in <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells, including Na(+) current, L- and T-type Ca(2+) currents, hyperpolarization-activated cation current, and various types of delayed rectifier K(+) currents. Mathematical models have demonstrated that spontaneous action potentials can be reconstructed by incorporating these currents, but relative contributions of individual currents vary widely between different models. In 1995, the presence of a novel inward current that was activated by depolarization to the potential range of the slow diastolic depolarization in rabbit sinoatrial (SA) node cells was reported. Because the current showed little inactivation during depolarizing pulses, it was called the sustained inward current (I(st)). A similar current is also found in SA node cells of the guinea pig and rat and in subsidiary pacemaker atrioventricular node cells. Recently, single-channel analysis has revealed a nicardipine-sensitive, 13-pS Na(+) current, which is activated by depolarization to the diastolic potential range in guinea pig SA node cells. This channel differs from rapid voltage-gated Na(+) or L-type Ca(2+) channels both in unitary conductance and gating kinetics. Because I(st) was observed only in spontaneously beating SA node cells, ie, it was absent in quiescent cells dissociated from the same SA or atrioventricular node, an important role of I(st) for generation of intrinsic cardiac automaticity was suggested.",M1
10461125,"A neural explanation of fetal heart rate patterns: A test of the polyvagal theory.The current study applies a neurophysiological model based on the Polyvagal Theory (Porges, 1995) to interpret fetal heart rate patterns. Beat-to-beat heart rate data from 7 fetuses monitored during the first and second stages of labor were analyzed. Transitory heart rate accelerations and reduced beat-to-beat variability reliably preceded heart rate decelerations. The data are interpreted within the context of the Polyvagal Theory, which provides a plausible explanation of the neurophysiological mechanisms that mediate fetal heart rate decelerations. Specifically, it is proposed that both the transitory heart rate accelerations and the depression of the respiratory rhythm in the beat-to-beat heart rate pattern reflect a withdrawal of the vagal tone determined by myelinated vagal pathways originating in the nucleus ambiguus. Functionally, withdrawal of vagal tone originating in the nucleus ambiguus results in the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> becoming vulnerable to sympathetic influences and to the more-primitive unmyelinated vagal pathways originating in the dorsal motor nucleus of the vagus, which may contribute to clinically relevant bradycardia.",M1

Amrinone (0.1-1.0 mM) progressively increased the AP amplitude, maximal rate of depolarization, and spontaneous firing frequency, shortened the AP duration, and made the threshold potential more negative. In voltage-clamp experiments using double microelectrode techniques, 0.1 mM amrinone increased the Ca2+ current (I(Ca)) obtained on step depolarization from -40 to -10 mV by 25.86% +/-4.6% (P &lt; 0.05, n = 6), the delayed rectifier K+ current (I(K)) tail obtained on repolarization from 10 to -60 mV by 22.8%+/-4.7% (P &lt; 0.05, n = 6), and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih) at -90 mV by 19.5%+/-7.3% (P &lt; 0.05, n = 6), respectively. Amrinone did not affect the slope factors of either the inactivation curve for I(Ca) (finfinity curve) or the activation curve for the delayed rectifier I(K) (pinfinity curve).

To address this question, right atria were microdissected, the SA node area was identified by acetylcholinesterase staining, and, using a RT-PCR method, the accumulation of mRNA molecules encoding beta1- and beta2-adrenergic (beta1- and beta2-AR) and muscarinic (M2-R) receptor was quantified to define the proportion between beta-AR and M2-R mRNAs within the sinoatrial area of adult (3 months) and senescent (24 months) individual rat hearts. In adult hearts, the highest M2-R/beta-AR mRNA ratio was observed within the sinoatrial area compared with adjacent atrial myocardium, while in the senescent hearts, no difference was observed between sinoatrial and adjacent areas. This change was specific of the sinoatrial area since adult and senescent whole atrial or ventricular myocardium did not differ in their M2-R/beta-AR mRNA ratio, and was associated with a fragmentation of acetylcholinesterase staining of the senescent SA node. Quantitative changes in the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in heart rate regulation specifically affect the sinoatrial area of the senescent heart.",M1
9152858,"Acetylcholine modulates I(f) and IK(ACh) via different pathways in rabbit sino-atrial node cells.The aim of the present study was to examine whether a direct G-protein pathway was necessary to explain the depression of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> current (I(f)) by acetylcholine (ACh). Pacemaker current and spontaneous fluctuations of muscarinic K+ current (IK(ACh)) were simultaneously measured in sino-atrial (SA) node cells isolated from rabbit hearts, using cell-attached and outside-out macro-patches. The effects of 1 microM ACh, added to the bathing solution, were compared on I(f) and on IK(ACh), known to be activated via a direct G-protein mechanism. In a cell-attached configuration where cytoplasmic substrates were present, ACh depressed I(f) by a negatively directed shift of the open probability curve of 7.6 +/- 0.3 mV. ACh never induced modifications in spontaneous openings of muscarinic K+ channels. These results indicate that ACh added to the external solution is unable to modulate IK(ACh) recorded in the membrane-delimited mode, via a G-protein pathway. The ACh depressing effect on I(f) is related to changes in second messenger activity. In outside-out conditions, with guanosine triphosphate (GTP) added to the pipette solution. ACh increased the variance of IK(ACh) fluctuations from 1.66 +/- 0.50 pA2 to 6.60 +/- 2.05 pA2 (at -120 mV). indicating direct G-protein action. ACh had no effect on I(f). It is concluded that in SA node cells, the regulation of I(f) by muscarinic receptors does not involve a direct G-protein pathway. ACh depresses I(f) by a mechanism that probably implicates reduction of intracellular cAMP production.",M1
8891874,"Atrioventricular junctional rhythm induced by sympathetic stimulation in E-4031-treated dog hearts.To investigate the role of delayed rectifier potassium current (IK) on the sympathetic control of the heart, we studied the effects of E-4031, a blocker of the rapidly activating type of IK (IKr), on the chronotropic, dromotropic, and inotropic responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation in the autonomically decentralized hearts of open-chest anesthetized dogs, E-4031 (0.01-3 mumol/kg intravenously, i.v.) decreased the heart rate (HR) dose dependently without affecting other cardiac functions. After E-4031 treatment, cardiac sympathetic nerve stimulation changed the sinus rhythm to the atrioventricular (AV) junctional rhythm in 6 of 11 anesthetized dogs (55%). In three of six junctional rhythm hearts, sinus rhythm supervened during sympathetic stimulation for 2 min. The number of pacemaker shifts to junctional rhythm increased as the dose of E-4031 was increased. However, E-4031 attenuated neither the positive chronotropic, dromotropic, nor right atrial and ventricular inotropic responses to sympathetic nerve stimulation. These results suggest that IKr inhibition may induce the AV junctional rhythm due to the combination of the different participation of IKr, the different resting potentials, and the different sensitivity to sympathetic activation among <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells.",M1
8917735,"Vagal control of sinoatrial rhythm: a mathematical model.The ionic mechanisms underlying vagal control of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> were investigated using a new single cell mathematical model of sinoatrial node electrical activity. The model was formulated from a wide range of electrophysiological data available in the literature, with particular reference to whole cell recordings from enzymatically isolated sinoatrial node cells. Development of the model was prompted by the lack of an existing physiologically accurate formulation of sinoatrial node activity that could reproduce the known complex chronotropic response of the pacemaker to brief-burst vagal stimulation, as observed in whole animal and isolated sinus node preparations. Features of the model include the dynamic modulation of the hyperpolarisation-activated current (i(f)) and the L-type calcium current (iCa,L) by acetylcholine, the improved characterisation of the muscarinic potassium current (iK,ACh), assigning the entire background potassium current (ib,K) to spontaneous openings of its channels, and the utilisation of second order kinetics for acetylcholine within the neuroeffector junction. Simulations performed using brief vagal stimuli elicited a strong hyperpolarisation of the membrane which prolonged the cycle in which it was delivered in a phase-dependent manner. This phase-dependency was presented in the form of a standard phase response curve which was characterised by a positive linear slope region, a breakpoint characteristic and a  no effect  zone in which the vagal pulse could no longer prolong the cycle. The breakpoint was manifested as a discontinuity in the curve which was examined by bracketing this point at the limit of the double precision arithmetic employed. At these boundary points on either side of the breakpoint, the vagal stimulus was able to activate outward iK,ACh in such a manner as to finely balance the increasing inward iCa,L trying to generate phase 0 upstroke. On decay of iK,ACh, the membrane either subsequently repolarised or fired to produce an action potential depending on the precise phase of the stimulus. The positive linear slope portion of the PRC was characterised by a strong resetting type behaviour in which the membrane hyperpolarised to approximately the same value, irrespective of the phase of stimulus delivery. For vagal stimulus bursts applied throughout the  no effect  zone, outward iK,ACh was not sufficiently activated in order to overcome the strong inward drive of iCa,L and could not prevent upstroke occurring. For these vagal stimuli, the subsequent cycle was hyperpolarised and prolonged. The size of the  no effect  zone was directly related to the inherent latency incorporated in the activation characteristic of iK,ACh. In contrast to previous models of vagal pacemaker control, our new model was able to reproduce the classical triphasic chronotropic response to brief vagal stimulation characterised by a primary inhibition response, a postinhibitory rebound and a secondary inhibition response. In particular, the postinhibitory rebound was due to activation of the inward hyperpolarisation-activated current by the vagally-induced membrane hyperpolarisation, whilst the secondary inhibition phase resulted from the inhibition of the hyperpolarisation-activated current by acetylcholine. The model suggests that the complex chronotropic responses of the cardiac pacemaker to brief vagal stimulation arises from inherent ionic mechanisms operating within the sinoatrial node.",M1
8920247,"Positive chronotropic responses of rabbit sino-atrial node cells to flash photolysis of caged isoproterenol and cyclic AMP.The kinetics of onset and the intracellular biochemical signalling mechanisms which are responsible for the positive chronotropic effect of sympathetic stimulation in rabbit <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells were examined by using flash photolysis of caged isoproterenol (ISO) and cyclic AMP (cAMP). When caged ISO (10 microM) was present in the superfusate, a single ultraviolet flash caused gradual increases in the spontaneous beating frequency and action potential height of S-A node cells. Both these effects developed after an initial latency of approximately 5 s. Photorelease of ISO also increased the L-type Ca2+ current (ICa-L) with a time-course similar to that of the changes in action potential waveform and heart rate. All of these ISO-induced effects were blocked completely by 1 microM propranolol, demonstrating that they were beta-adrenergic responses. Flash photolysis of caged cAMP (50 microM) also resulted in increased firing frequency and ICa-L. However, these responses to cAMP developed with little or no latency. Intracellular dialysis with a selective inhibitor of the cAMP-dependent protein kinase, Rp-cAMPS, completely abolished the increase in ICa-L demonstrating that it is mediated exclusively via cAMP-dependent activation of protein kinase A, as opposed to a direct G-protein mediated mechanism.",M1
9129243,"The role of Ca2+ release from sarcoplasmic reticulum in the regulation of sinoatrial node automaticity.The role of Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in modulating physiological automaticity of the sinoatrial (SA) node was studied by recording transmembrane action potentials and membrane ionic currents in small preparations of the rabbit SA node. Ryanodine, which modifies the conductance and gating behavior of the Ca2+ release channels, was used to block Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. Superfusion of 1-mM ryanodine decreased the spontaneous firing frequency as well as the maximal rate of depolarization of the SA, and these reductions reached a steady state within approximately 5 min. The action potential recordings revealed that the latter part of diastolic depolarization was depressed and that the take-off potential became less negative. This suggested that the negative chronotropic effect of ryanodine resulted from the blockade of physiological Ca2+ release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. In voltage clamp experiments, using double-microelectrode techniques, ryanodine did not markedly reduce the Ca2+ current (ICa) but decreased the delayed rectifying K+ current (IK), the steady-state inward current (Iss), and the hyperpolarization-activated inward current (Ih). These observations suggest that, even when the function of C2+ channels in the cell membrane is normally maintained, depression of Ca2+ release channels in the sarcoplasmic reticulum would prevent sufficient elevation of the Ca2+ concentration in SA node cells for the activation of various ionic currents, and, thus adversely affect the physiological automaticity of this primary <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>.",M1

Fentanyl (0.1-3 microM) progressively decreased the AP amplitude (APA), maximal rate of depolarization (MRD), and spontaneous firing frequency (SFF) and prolonged the AP duration (APD) and diastolic interval in a concentration-dependent manner. At 1 microM, the spontaneous activity ceased in two of the eight preparations.

We found that the tachycardia produced by the successive vagal stimulations progressively decreased to &lt; 20% of the initial tachycardia response within 84 min.

This finding indicates that the postjunctional responsiveness of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells had not diminished over the course of the vagal stimulation regimen. In isolated, perfused right atrial preparations, we observed a close correlation between the efflux of VIP from the atrial tissues and the chronotropic responses to vagal stimulation. Our results support the hypotheses that 1) VIP is a mediator of vagally induced tachycardia, 2) the reduction in VIP efflux is associated with a diminished vagally induced tachycardia, and 3) the reduced efflux of VIP probably reflects a diminution in neuronal release, perhaps by depletion of this peptide from the vagus nerve endings consequent to the prolonged neural stimulation.",M1

8214817,"Modification of DiFrancesco-Noble equations to simulate the effects of vagal stimulation on in vivo mammalian sinoatrial node electrical activity.We present a new mathematical model for vagal control of rabbit sinoatrial (SA) node electrical activity based on the DiFrancesco-Noble equations. The original equations were found to be unstable, resulting in progressive cycle by cycle depletion or accumulation of ions in intra- and extracellular compartments. This problem was overcome by modifying the maximum Na-K pump current and the time constant for uptake of intracellular calcium. We also included a formulation for the acetylcholine (ACh)-activated potassium current which was consistent with experimental data. This formulation was based on kinetics first proposed by Osterrieder and later modified by Yanagihara. The resulting model exhibits cycle-cycle ionic stability, and includes an ACh-activated potassium current which accurately reproduces experimentally observed effects of vagal stimulation on both the membrane potential and its time-derivative. Simulations were performed for both brief-burst and prolonged vagal stimulation using simplified square wave profiles for the concentration of ACh in the synaptic cleft space. This protocol permits the isolation of cardiac period dynamics caused by changes in membrane potential and intra- and extracellular ionic concentrations from those caused by other mechanisms including the dynamics of ACh release, diffusion, hydrolysis and washout. Simulation results for the effects of brief-burst single cycle stimulation on the cardiac period agree closely with experimental data reported in the literature, accurately reproducing changes in membrane potential and the phasic dependency of the response to the position of vagal stimulus bursts within the cycle. Simulation of the effects of prolonged vagal stimulation accurately reproduced the steady-state characteristics of heart period response, but did not yield the complex multimodal dynamics of the recovery phase, or the pronounced post vagal tachycardia observed experimentally at the termination of the stimulus. Our results show that the major chronotropic effects of vagal stimulation on the SA cell membrane can be explained in terms of the ACh-activated potassium current. The effects of this membrane current however are generally fast acting and cannot contribute to any long lasting dynamics of the cardiac period response.

1877672,"Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide enhances automaticity of supraventricular pacemakers in anesthetized dogs.Effects of the cardiac neuropeptide vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) and isoproterenol (ISO) were compared on sinus nodal, subsidiary atrial, and atrioventricular junctional pacemaker automaticity in pentobarbital sodium-anesthetized dogs (n = 14). Autonomic cardiac nerves were decentralized by bilateral vagotomy and stellectomy. VIP and ISO (30, 100, and 300 pmol/kg iv) were administered during sinus rhythm and either after crushing the sinus node to unmask a latent subsidiary atrial pacemaker (n = 7 dogs) or after injecting pentobarbital sodium into the sinus node artery to elicit an atrioventricular junctional pacemaker (n = 7). Spontaneous sinus nodal, subsidiary atrial, and atrioventricular junctional pacemaker rates (after autonomic nerve decentralization) were 142 +/- 4, 114 +/- 3, and 79 +/- 4 beats/min (means +/- SE), respectively. Both VIP and ISO dose dependently increased the rates of all three pacemaker sites. Combined muscarinic-cholinergic (atropine; 0.11 mg/kg iv) and beta-adrenergic receptor blockade (nadolol; 0.5 mg/kg iv) abolished the stimulatory effects of ISO on subsidiary atrial and atrioventricular junctional pacemakers but did not affect the responses to VIP. We conclude that exogenous VIP enhances the automaticity of sinus nodal, subsidiary atrial, and atrioventricular junctional pacemakers independently of muscarinic-cholinergic and beta-adrenergic receptors. Based on the previous demonstration of VIP-immunoreactive nerves throughout the heart, our findings also suggest that endogenous VIP may be involved in <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> regulation.",M1
1745719,"Behavioral modulation patterns fit an animal model of vagus-<e>cardiac pacemaker</e> interactions.The present study used a computer model of the dynamic interaction between the vagus nerve and the sinoatrial pacemaker membrane potential in the heart of the rabbit to reconstruct heart rate changes under vagal excitation conditions. We asked whether a hypothetical pattern of vagal acetylcholine (ACh) release, which was based on human heart rate results in a reaction time task, could be fit to this model. The reconstructed heart rate results showed changes that were highly consistent with experimental human heart rate changes. The model reliably reproduced effects of parameters such as intrinsic heart rate level, ACh stimulus intensity, and ACh stimulus duration. In addition, the effects of anticipatory vagal ACh release, stimulus-induced ACh, and subsequent blocking of ACh, which usually interact in human cardiac cycle time functions, could be untangled in the reconstructed heart rate results. We concluded that the mathematical model may be useful for formulating hypotheses and constructing experimental task designs for studies of human heart rate.",M1
1709448,"Direct activation of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> channels by intracellular cyclic AMP.Cyclic AMP acts as a second messenger in the modulation of several ion channels that are typically controlled by a phosphorylation process. In cardiac pacemaker cells, adrenaline and acetylcholine regulate the hyperpolarization-activated current (if), but in opposite ways; this current is involved in the generation and modulation of pacemaker activity. These actions are mediated by cAMP and underlie control of spontaneous rate by neurotransmitters. Whether the cAMP modulation of if is mediated by channel phosphorylation is, however, still unknown. Here we investigate the action of cAMP on if in excised patches of cardiac pacemaker cells and find that cAMP activates if by a mechanism independent of phosphorylation, involving a direct interaction with the channels at their cytoplasmic side. Cyclic AMP activates if by shifting its activation curve to more positive voltages, in agreement with whole-cell results. This is the first evidence of an ion channel whose gating is dually regulated by voltage and direct cAMP binding.",M1
2057325,"Block of the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> current (If) in the rabbit sino-atrial node and in canine Purkinje fibres by 9-amino-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroacridine.We have investigated the action of 9-amino-1, 2, 3, 4-tetrahydroacridine (THA) on the pacemaker current If in rabbit sino-atrial node myocytes and in canine Purkinje fibers. THA at concentrations in the range 3-300 microM blocked If in a voltage-independent manner, as revealed by measurements on the fully activated I/V relation for If. The dose/response relationship of the If maximal slope conductance (Gf) can be fitted by assuming a cooperative binding reaction where two THA molecules are required to block one If channel. Half-maximal block occurred at 18.2 microM in the sino-atrial node and 36.6 microM in Purkinje fibers. THA also affected the If kinetic properties. This was examined in the sino-atrial node where the current activation curve was shifted in the negative direction on the voltage axis (- 21 mV at 30 microM THA). The delayed rectifier current, IK, was also reduced by THA in sino-atrial node myocytes: at - 40 mV the IK fully activated value was decreased to 37% of its control value by 30 microM THA, with only a minor modification of the position of the activation curve at the same potential. Thus, although THA blocks If at a lower concentration than other known If-channel blockers [DiFrancesco (1982) J Physiol (Lond) 329:485-507], its action on the pacemaker current is not specific.",M1

1697697,"Heart rate regulation by G proteins acting on the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> channel.Heart rate is determined by pacemaker currents, of which the most important is the hyperpolarization-activated current I(f). Heart rate and I(f) are increased by beta-adrenergic agonists and decreased by muscarinic agonists released from cardiac sympathetic and vagal nerves, respectively. The hypothesis that the receptors for each agonist are directly coupled to I(f) channels by G proteins was tested. Under substrate-free conditions, preactivated G protein Gs stimulated and preactivated G protein G(o) inhibited I(f) channels of sinoatrial node pacemaker cells. These effects were mimicked by the corresponding preactivated alpha subunits of the G proteins. Unexpectedly, the two G proteins acted simultaneously, with G(o) being the more potent. This result may explain in molecular terms the classical observation in cardiac physiology, that vagal inhibition of heart rate is much greater on a background of sympathetic stimulation.",M1
2163222,"Regulation of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> current If in excised membranes from sinoatrial node cells.We have proposed that voltage-gated ionic channels are regulated by receptor-guanine-nucleotide binding (G) protein pathways that are membrane delimited (direct) or cytoplasmic (indirect). Since indirect pathways are known to couple muscarinic and beta-adrenergic receptors to hyperpolarization-activated current (If) channels, we tested our hypothesis that direct pathways might also be present by measuring If currents in rabbit sinoatrial node cells using the gigaseal patch clamp method. Whole cell If currents were increased by the beta-agonist isoproterenol (Iso) and decreased by the muscarinic agonist carbachol (Carb) at rates that were similar to the rate at which carbachol increased muscarinic K(+)-acetylcholine channel (K+[ACh]) current in the same cells. K+[ACh] currents are directly gated by a G protein, and the results therefore supported our hypothesis. Much stronger support came after we established for the first time that If could be recorded from excised inside out membrane patches in the absence of cytoplasmic substrates. Under these conditions Iso increased and Carb decreased cell-free patch If provided guanosine 5'-triphosphate and Mg2+ were present. Thus G proteins couple autonomic receptors to If within the plasma membrane, probably by a direct action.",M1

Above 100 microM, the compound also exerted a bradycardiac effect and decreased the rate of diastolic depolarization significantly. 3 On the current systems, NTC produced dose-related decreases in the slow inward Ca2+ current and the time-dependent outward K+ current. 4 It is concluded that NTC depresses the spontaneous discharge of the sino-atrial node through decreases in both inward and outward current systems.",M1
2855644,"Ionic mechanisms of adenosine actions in pacemaker cells from rabbit heart.1. Whole-cell and patch clamp techniques have been applied to cells isolated from the rabbit sino-atrial (S-A) node to study the ionic mechanism(s) of adenosine-induced slowing of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> activity. 2. Viable spontaneously active cells were isolated from the central region of the S-A node of the rabbit heart by an enzymatic dispersion procedure similar to that reported by Giles &amp; van Ginneken (1985) and van Ginneken &amp; Giles (1988). In these spontaneously beating cells application of adenosine caused a dose-dependent slowing accompanied by a small hyperpolarization of the maximum diastolic potential. Relatively high doses of adenosine (greater than 20 microM) caused complete arrest, associated with a hyperpolarization of 12-15 mV. 3. In corresponding whole-cell voltage clamp experiments adenosine activated a time-independent potassium current, IK(ADO), which at -50 mV is approximately 30 pA in normal Tyrode solution and 50 pA in high [K+]o (20 mM) Tyrode solution. This current is similar to the one identified previously in guinea-pig atrium (Belardinelli &amp; Isenberg, 1983a; Kurachi, Nakajima &amp; Sugimoto, 1986). 4. Patch clamp recordings of the single-channel events underlying IK(ADO) showed that they have a conductance of approximately 25.0 +/- 1.9 pS. The whole-cell or macroscopic current, IK(ADO), and the adenosine-induced single-channel events exhibit strong inward-going rectification. 5. Adenosine in doses (10 microM) which significantly activate IK(ADO) failed to produce any measurable effect on the calcium current, ICa, in these isolated cardiac pacemaker cells. However, after ICa has been enhanced by the addition of isoprenaline, adenosine (1-10 microM) caused a significant inhibition: it reduced ICa back to approximately the control levels. 6. A similar 'indirect' effect of adenosine was observed on If, the slow time- and voltage-dependent inward current which is activated by hyperpolarizing these S-A node cells. Adenosine (10(-5) M) failed to influence the control or basal If; however, after If was enhanced by isoprenaline, adenosine markedly inhibited it. 7. These results provide explanations for both the direct and the indirect effects of adenosine in mammalian cardiac pacemaker tissue: activation of IK(ADO), and of a time-independent background potassium current and inhibition of ICa and If, respectively. Since it is known that there is significant adrenergic tone in the mammalian S-A node both the indirect and the direct effects of adenosine may be of physiological importance.",M1

3618494,"Sinus node shift after the Senning procedure compared with the Mustard procedure for transposition of the great arteries.To investigate the nature of the dominant intrinsic <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> activity after the Senning procedure, endocardial mapping of the systemic venous atrium was accomplished a mean of 13 months after operation in 10 patients, aged 22 +/- 6 months. Multiple endocardial sites were measured to find the earliest atrial electrical activity timed back from the QRS complex. These data were compared with data from endocardial mapping performed in 6 patients late after the Mustard procedure. In 8 of 10 patients who had undergone the Senning procedure, the earliest activation time, corresponding by definition to the origin of the intrinsic pacemaker, was located in the inferior medial portion of the superior limb of the systemic venous atrium. In the other 2 patients who had undergone the Senning procedure, the earliest activity was in the high superior limb of the baffle at its junction with the superior vena cava. In contrast, the earliest activity in all patients who underwent the Mustard operation was at the junction of the superior vena cava and the superior limb of the systemic venous atrium. In response to programmed extrastimulation, the electrophysiologic behavior of the intrinsic pacemaker in the Senning group was abnormal compared with known normal sinus node (SN) data in only 3 of 10 patients, whereas all patients in the Mustard group had SN dysfunction.

6509386,"Effects of digoxin on the chronotropic responses to repetitive vagal stimulus bursts in the dog.We studied the effects of digoxin on the chronotropic responses of the heart to repetitive bursts of vagal stimulation in chloralose-anesthetized dogs. The frequency of the stimulus bursts was increased linearly with time. Over a certain range of frequencies, the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> became synchronized with the vagal stimulation in a 1:1 ratio of heart beats to stimulus bursts. Digoxin increased the range of cardiac cycle lengths over which 1:1 synchronization occurred during repetitive vagal stimulation. This increment in the range of synchronization varied directly with the dose of digoxin. Before digoxin was given, the range of cardiac cycle lengths over which synchronization occurred when the vagus nerve was stimulated with 10 pulses per burst was 272 +/- 50 (mean +/- SE) ms. However, after a cumulative dose of 120 micrograms/kg-1 digoxin had been given, the range of 1:1 synchronization increased to 396 +/- 32 ms. Digoxin did not appear to have a proportionately greater effect on those processes that take place in the phase of the cardiac cycle during which the pacemaker cells are maximally responsive than on those processes that occur in the phase of the cycle during which the pacemaker cells are minimally responsive. Therefore, we conclude that the augmented entrainment induced by digoxin is ascribable to its tendency to enhance the chronotropic response to vagal stimulation.",M1

Shifts in the position of the cardiac pacemaker were accompanied by changes in spontaneous contractions. They were also attended by changes in the pattern of the total electrogram of the preparation which was indicative of an altered electrical activation of the right atrium. It is noteworthy that these changes occurred only when the cardiac pacemaker shifted along the terminal crest.

6861283,"Dynamic vagal control of pacemaker activity in the mammalian sinoatrial node.Dynamic heart rate control by parasympathetic nervous input involves feedback mechanisms and reflex bursting of efferent cardiac vagal fibers. Periodic vagal bursting induces phasic changes in sinoatrial cycle length and can entrain the pacemaker to beat at periods that may be identical to those of the vagal burst. We investigated the electrophysiological basis of these phenomena in isolated sinus node preparations (rabbit, cat, and sheep). In the presence of propranolol (3.9 X 10(-6)M), relatively brief (50-150 msec) trains of stimuli, applied onto the endocardial surface of the preparation, activated postganglionic vagal terminals and induced a brief hyperpolarization of sinoatrial pacemaker cells. This vagally mediated hyperpolarization could alter the pacemaker rhythm by an amount that depended on its duration and its position in the cycle, as well as on the duration of the free-running pacemaker period. When the free-running period was sufficiently long and the hyperpolarization was induced sufficiently early in the spontaneous cycle, a  paradoxical  acceleration of the pacemaker rhythm ensued. Phasic changes were plotted on phase-response curves, constructed by scanning systematically the sinoatrial pacemaker period with single or repetitive vagal trains. These phase-response curves enabled us to predict the entrainment characteristics and the levels of synchronization of the pacemaker to the vagal periodicity. The overall data explain the cellular mechanisms involved in the phasic effects of brief vagal discharges on sinoatrial periodicity, and provide conclusive evidence for the prediction that repetitive vagal input is capable of forcing the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> to beat at rates that can be faster or slower than the intrinsic pacemaker rate. These data should improve our knowledge of the dynamic control of heart rate by neural reflexes and aid in our understanding of rhythm disturbances generated by the interaction of the cardiac pacemaker with vagal activity.",M1
6639981,"Synchronization in chains of pacemaker cells by phase resetting action potential effects.Interactions between pacemaker cells in a chain were calculated according to a  phase-reset  model. It is based on effects of action potentials in the cells on the cycle lengths of neighbouring cells. These effects were defined for each cell by a latency-phase curve (LPC), giving the latency time (L) until the onset of the next action potential in that cell, as a function of the phase (phi) at which a neighbour cell fired an action potential. Neighbour cells with simultaneous action potentials did not influence each others cycle length. We investigated how stable synchronization depends on the shape of the LPC's of the pacemaker cells and on chain length. Three types of interactive behaviour were distinguished. First, anti-phase synchrony, in which neighbouring cells fired with large phase differences with respect to the synchronized period Ps. Second, asynchrony, in which the periods of the cells did not become equal and constant. Third, in-phase synchrony, in which the phase differences between the neighbouring cells were zero or much smaller than the synchronized period Ps, depending on the differences between the intrinsic periods. Asynchrony and anti-phase synchrony may be seen as cardiophysiological arrhythmias, while in-phase synchrony represents the physiological type of synchrony in the heart. In-phase synchrony appeared to be strongly favoured by LPC's, which have a no-effect (refractory) part at early phases, a lengthened latency (or phase delay) part at intermediate phases and a shortened latency (or phase advance) part at late phases in the cycle. Such LPC-shapes are commonly found in preparations of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> cells. When the pacemaker cells were identical, the synchronized period Ps during in-phase synchrony was equal to their intrinsic period P*i. For different intrinsic periods, Ps was equal to the intrinsic period of the fastest cell if the LPC's contained a sufficiently long initial no-effect period at early phases and a shortened latency part at late phases. When, on the other hand, such cell chains had a linear gradient in their intrinsic periods,  action potentials  started from the fast end and traveled along the chain. The propagation of an action potential wave slowed down as it reached the slower cells. When the gradient in the intrinsic periods was too steep, only the intrinsically fast end of the chain developed synchrony.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M1

When the atria and ventricles contracted at different rates, the pulse-synchronized contractions were locked to the atrial rate. Excision of the right atrium, but not the left, resulted in the abolition of pulse-synchronized contractions.

Functional inhomogeneity of the rabbit sinus node.In the isolated rabbit sinus node, adrenaline induced a pacemaker shift toward the inferior part of the node (distance, 2.5 mm). Acetylcholine gave a pacemaker shift either toward the inferior part of the node (distance, 1.2 mm) or, at higher acetylcholine concentrations, toward cells near the upper part of the crista terminalis. After severing the superior from the inferior part of the preparation, we compared the chronotropic responses in the two parts. The node appeared to be functionally inhomogeneous: in the inferior part the adrenaline-induced acceleration was larger and the acetylcholine-induced deceleration was smaller than in the superior part. In the total preparation and the isolated inferior part, the acceleration due to adrenaline was suppressed by acetylcholine and the deceleration due to acetylcholine was enhanced by adrenaline. Such an interference could not be established in the isolated superior part. The acetylcholine-induced pacemaker also dominated during the simultaneous addition of the two neurotransmitters. We conclude therefore that the functional inhomogeneity of the sinus node explains the predominance of the effect of acetylcholine over that of adrenaline.",M1

Sustained stepwise applications of current across the gap produce lasting variations in pacemaker cycle length that depend on current magnitude and polarity, but not on the phase of the pacemaker period at the time of the input. Brief current pulses, whether hyperpolarizing or depolarizing, may abbreviate or prolong the immediately affected cycle depending on their timing. These changes result in phase shifts of the subsequent discharges, but they do not alter the pacemaker period permanently. The phasic effects of brief current pulses can be described by a phase response curve (PRC), which is a plot of the phase shift as a function of the position of the stimulus in the pacemaker cycle. PRCs were constructed for inputs of different polarity and several strengths and durations.

The mode of the inhibitory action of acetylcholine on pacemaker cells is considered. In the amphibian pacemaker cell, acetylcholine probably reduces slow inward current (as it certainly does in amphibian atrium) but in mammalian sino-atrial node it seems that such action, if present at all, is much less marked. In the pacemakers of both amphibian and mammal, acetylcholine greatly increases outward potassium current and there is recent evidence that it may do so by opening up a special acetylcholine-activated potassium channel. 4. Adrenaline greatly increases the slow inward current in pacemaker as in other cardiac tissues. This increase, together with (in mammal at least) an increased change of an additional pacemaking current, overrides an adrenaline-induced increase in outward current and leads to acceleration of the pacemaking rate. 5. The Appendix contains a brief consideration of the experimental and theoretical basis for the method of exponential separation of outward current components in the presence of the extracellular potassium accumulation that inevitably accompanies the flow of outward membrane current.",M1

20424536,"Prognostic value of NT-proBNP levels in patients undergoing permanent pacemaker implantation.INTRODUCTION: Several reports confirmed the prognostic value of the N-terminal fragment of B-type natriuretic peptide prohormone (NT-proBT) in various patient populations. Patients with medical indications for implantation of an artificial <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> are at high risk of cardiovascular events. There is limited data assessing the prognostic value of NT-proBNP in this group. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to establish the prognostic value of NT-proBNP in patients scheduled for the implantation of a cardiac stimulator. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The study included 59 patients (average age 79.8 +/-6.3 years) with indications for implantation of a permanent pacemaker. NT-proBNP was measured in each patient on admission and 46 patients had their NT-proBNP measured 1 month after implantation. All patients were followed up for 4 years. We examined the incidence of cardiovascular events as endpoints. Finally, we analyzed the relationship between the initial concentration of NT-proBNP measured on admission and at 1 month and the risk of the occurrence of the endpoint (analysis in the group in whom events occurred vs. group without the endpoint). RESULTS: NT-proBNP values at baseline and at 1 month (NT-proBNP1month) were significantly higher in patients who experienced cardiovascular events than in those who were free of such events (NT-proBNP: 2310.6 +/-2657.7 pg/ml vs. 1177.6 +/-1364.6 pg/ml, P &lt;0.2; NT-proBNP1month: 2538 +/-3341.4 pg/ml vs. 1139.4 +/-1294.1 pg/ml, P &lt;0.03, respectively). A cut-off point of the initial NT-proBNP value of 577 pg/ml was estimated as the most accurate prognostic risk factor for cardiovascular events within a 4-year follow-up (sensitivity 77%, specificity 52%). CONCLUSIONS: The level of NT-proBNP prior to as well as 1 month after cardiac pacemaker implantation can be useful in identifying patients with higher risk of future cardiovascular events. We suggest using the baseline NT-proBNP concentration of 577 pg/ml as a cut-off value for assessing the risk for such events.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 487 consecutive patients (men 45%, mean age 69.9+/-12.3 years), who were defined as having an indication for <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> (PM) for SSS, were investigated. The ECG before an initial PM implantation and occurrence of VF or sudden cardiac death (SCD) was examined retrospectively. Brugada-type ECG was found in 14 patients (2.87%) including 4 (0.82%) with type 1 and 10 (2.05%) with type 2. During the follow-up period of 7.2+/-5.4 years, 2 out of the 4 patients with type 1 ECG had experienced a VF episode after the device implantation. In 10 patients with type 2 ECG, none had VF or SCD. The incidence of spontaneous VF (Brugada syndrome) in SSS patients was calculated as 14.1 per 100 person-years with type 1 ECG. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of typical Brugada-type (type 1) ECG in SSS patients seems to be higher compared with the general population.

After clinical evaluation, cardiac pacemaker was placed, but he still suffered from the syncope. Then, he received the chemotherapy with docetaxel and cisplatin. The last hypotension event occurred on day 10 of the chemotherapy. Six months after 3 cycles of chemotherapy, he remained in complete remission and resolution of syncope. We report a case in which syncope was associated with a recurrence of tonsilar cancer and successfully treated with chemotherapy.",M2
19838495,"Conventional ventricular stimulation effects on patients with normal ventricular function.BACKGROUND: The stimulation of the right ventricle (RV) may be deleterious in patients with ventricular dysfunction; however there is little evidence about the impact of this stimulation in patients with normal ventricular function. OBJECTIVES: To assess the clinical and laboratory evolution of patients with normal ventricular function submitted to implant of artificial <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> (PM). METHODS: 16 patients enrolled according to the following inclusion criteria: normal ventricular function defined by echocardiogram and presence of upper ventricular stimulation &gt; 90% (generator telemetry assessment) submitted to a PM implant were prospectively studied. The following parameters were assessed: Functional Class (FC), walk test, BNP levels, echocardiography evaluation (conventional and intraventricular dyssynchrony) and quality of life test (SF36). The patients were assessed after 10 (t1), 120 (t2) and 240 days (t3). Data was compared throughout time according to ANOVA. Multiple comparisons of means were performed through Tukey's test. RESULTS: Among the assessed data, the following did not present significant statistic variation (p&gt; 0.05): functional class, BNP levels, conventional echocardiographic parameters, intraventricular dyssynchrony (tissue Doppler). The walk test (between t2 and t3) and the time between septal contraction and LV posterior wall showed worsening (p&lt;0.05), although they did not meet the dyssynchrony criteria. The quality of life assessment (SF36) showed improvement in the functional capacity, social aspects, and general status sub-items. CONCLUSION: After 8 months, patients with normal ventricular function did not show clinical (FC and SF36) or laboratory alterations (conventional echocardiography, dyssynchrony parameters and BNP levels); however, there was a worsening in the walk test.",M2

Our objective was to evaluate, in a large cohort, hemorrhagic complications in patients having implantation or replacement of a cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, and to assess perioperative anticoagulation effect on hemorrhagic risk. METHODS AND RESULTS: A cohort of 461 consecutive patients having implantation or replacement of a cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator has been analyzed. Thirty patients (6,5%) had oral anticoagulants (OAC) switched to heparin/low-molecular-weight heparin, while 76 (16,5%) had their oral anticoagulation disrupted habitually for 48 hours. A total of six over 30 (20%) and two over 76 (2.6%) patients in the bridge and OAC, respectively experienced a pocket hematoma (bridge vs. OAC, p&lt;0.05), while ten over 355 (2.8%) had a pocket hematoma in the control group (bridge vs. control p=0.006). Duration of the hospital stay was longer in the bridge group in comparison with OAC and control groups (9 vs. 7 vs. 6 days, respectively, p=0.006). CONCLUSION: Oral anticoagulation bridging with heparin or low-molecular-weight heparin is associated with a higher risk of pocket hematoma and a longer duration of hospitalization, in comparison with a strategy allowing a temporary disruption of OAC adapted to the thromboembolic risk.",M2

In his past history, a cardiac pacemaker was implanted for sick sinus syndrome. Further examination showed esophageal cancer had metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes and invaded the trachea. There was no surgical indication. In terms of chemoradiotherapy, it was thought to be possible because the patient was not pacemaker- dependent and radiotherapy could be planned in such a way as to keep the dose to the pacemaker as low as possible. Electrocardiogram was monitored during the treatment. In addition to the usual observation, the patient's cardiac symptoms and pacemaker status were assessed before and soon after the completion of radiotherapy. S-1 was selected as a concomitant chemotherapy. In liaising with the cardiologist and radiologist, chemoradiotherapy was achieved without pacemaker malfunction, and shrinking of tumors was also detected.",M2
19481505,"Tertiapin-Q removes a large and rapidly acting component of vagal slowing of the guinea-pig <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>.The participation of acetylcholine-activated potassium current (I(K,ACh)) and hyperpolarization-activated pacemaker current (I(f)) in vagal bradycardia were examined using vagally-innervated preparations of guinea-pig atria. Preparations were maintained in Krebs-Henseleit solution (36 degrees C). Before treatment, trains of vagal stimuli (10 s at 2, 5 and 10 Hz) produced graded bradycardias displaying rapid onset and offset. Tertiapin-Q (300 nM), which blocks I(K,ACh), had no effect on baseline atrial rate. In tertiapin-Q, vagal bradycardia displayed a gradual onset and offset, with a peak response ~50% of that recorded in control conditions. Cumulative addition of 1 mM ZD7288 (blocker of I(f)) caused atrial rate to fall by ~60%, but had no further effect on the amplitude of the vagal bradycardia, while response onset and offset became slightly faster. From these observations, we argue that (i) vagal bradycardia was attributable primarily to activation of I(K,ACh), (ii) vagal modulation of I(f) had a minor influence on the rate of onset and offset of bradycardia, and (iii) removal of the influence of I(K,ACh) unmasked a slow response, of undetermined origin, to vagal stimulation. In a separate set of experiments we compared the effects of 1 mM Ba(2+) and 300 nM tertiapin-Q on vagal bradycardia. Ba(2+) reduced baseline atrial rate and the response to vagal stimulation. Subsequent cumulative addition of tertiapin-Q had no additional effect on baseline atrial rate, but caused further reduction in the amplitude of vagal bradycardia, suggesting that 1 mM Ba(2+) did not achieve a complete block of I(K,ACh) in this preparation.",M2

This entity has been proven by multiple case reports and small case series. The management of the patients with IA is still in early phase of discussion. We report a patient with medically intractable cryptogenic partial epilepsy for 27 years who presented with new onset drop attacks. During the epilepsy monitoring unit stay he was found to have a left fronto-temporal partial onset seizures which triggered brady-arrhythmia followed by asystole for 20s. A cardiac pacemaker was implanted and the patient was followed for 2 years. He continued to have simple and complex partial seizures but did not have drop attacks anymore. He still occasionally feels the activation of his pacemaker during simple partial phase of his seizures but the characteristic loss of muscle tone never happened again which made him highly satisfied. Our case demonstrates that IA can even happen decades after the onset of epilepsy. Cardiac pacemaker should be considered in all patients with IA as it prevents ictal falls and possibly SUDEP.",M2
19357445,"[Factors influencing development of atrial fibrillation after implantation of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> for sinus node dysfunction]OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate factors influencing the success of atrial fibrillation treatment associated with the sick sinus syndrome after pacemaker implantation. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 163 patients with sick sinus syndrome followed up after pacemaker implantation, statistical analysis showed that the recurrence of atrial fibrillation increased 2.8 times and 2.5 times when the left atrium or the right atrium, respectively, were increased by 1 cm (P=0.001). In addition, the recurrence of atrial fibrillation increased 2.5 times when the interventricular septum was thickened (P=0.007). Probability of atrial fibrillation recurrence was 2.73 times higher in the presence of grade II mitral regurgitation as compared to absent or grade I mitral regurgitation (P=0.029). The results of atrial fibrillation treatment did not significantly depend on age, gender, duration of atrial fibrillation symptoms, other cardiac structural changes, and concomitant noncardiac diseases. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with sick sinus syndrome, the effectiveness of atrial fibrillation treatment after pacemaker implantation is influenced by enlargement of the left and the right atria, increased interventricular septum thickness, and grade II mitral regurgitation. Evaluation of echocardiographic data before pacemaker implantation has prognostic value for determining the probability of maintenance of sinus rhythm.",M2
19330500,"Artificial neural interfaces for bionic cardiovascular treatments.An artificial nerve, in the broad sense, may be conceptualized as a physical and logical interface system that reestablishes the information traffic between the central nervous system and peripheral organs. Studies on artificial nerves targeting the autonomic nervous system are in progress to explore new treatment strategies for several cardiovascular diseases. In this article, we will review our research targeting the autonomic nervous system to treat cardiovascular diseases. First, we identified the rule for decoding native sympathetic nerve activity into a heart rate using transfer function analysis, and established a framework for a neurally regulated <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>. Second, we designed a bionic baroreflex system to restore the baroreflex buffering function using electrical stimulation of the celiac ganglion in a rat model of orthostatic hypotension. Third, based on the hypothesis that autonomic imbalance aggravates chronic heart failure, we implanted a neural interface into the right vagal nerve and demonstrated that intermittent vagal stimulation significantly improved the survival rate in rats with chronic heart failure following myocardial infarction. Although several practical problems need to be resolved, such as those relating to the development of electrodes feasible for long-term nerve activity recording, studies of artificial neural interfaces with the autonomic nervous system have great possibilities in the field of cardiovascular treatment. We expect further development of artificial neural interfaces as novel strategies to cope with cardiovascular diseases resistant to conventional therapeutics.",M2

There are few case reports in literature of high cervical spinal cord injury requiring permanent cardiac pacemaker due to this complication, but an injury as low as cervico-dorsal junction requiring permanent cardiac pacemaker has never been reported. A 47-year-old male suffered traumatic C7-D1 dislocation and continued to have severe bradycardia with multiple episodes of cardiac arrest till 2 months after injury, which finally warranted permanent cardiac pacemaker as a life saving measure. Following permanent cardiac pacemaker no cardiac arrest occurred and the patient was successfully rehabilitated. The case directs our attention to a rare complication of cardiac arrest occurring in an injury as low as cervico-dorsal junction when all other causes are ruled out and shows importance of using permanent cardiac pacemaker to ensure patient safety in community.",M2
19238754,"Caveolin-3 associates with and affects the function of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4.Targeting of ion channels to caveolae, a subset of lipid rafts, allow cells to respond efficiently to extracellular signals. Hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel (HCN) 4 is a major subunit for the <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>. Caveolin-3 (Cav3), abundantly expressed in muscle cells, is responsible for forming caveolae. P104L, a Cav3 mutant, has a dominant negative effect on wild type (WT) Cav3 and associates with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy and cardiomyopathy. HCN4 was previously shown to localize to lipid rafts, but how caveolae regulate the function of HCN4 is unknown. We hypothesize that Cav3 associates with HCN4 and regulates the function of HCN4 channel. In this study, we applied whole-cell patch clamp analysis, immunostaining, biotinylation, and immunoprecipitation methods to investigate this hypothesis. The immunoprecipitation results indicated an association of HCN4 and Cav3 in the heart and in HEK293 cells. Our immunostaining results showed that HCN4 colocalized with Cav3 but only partially colocalized with P104L in HEK293 cells. Transient expression of Cav3, but not P104L, in HEK 293 cells stably expressing HCN4 caused a 45% increase in HCN4 current (IHCN4) density. Transient expression of P104L caused a two-fold increase in the activation time constant for IHCN4 and shifted the voltage of the steady-state inactivation to a more negative potential. We conclude that HCN4 associates with Cav3 to form a HCN4 macromolecular complex. Our results indicated that disruption of caveolae using P104L alters HCN4 function and could cause a reduction of cardiac pacemaker activity.",M2

19132759,"Measuring RF-induced currents inside implants: Impact of device configuration on MRI safety of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> leads.Radiofrequency (RF)-related heating of cardiac pacemaker leads is a serious concern in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Recent investigations suggest such heating to be strongly dependent on an implant's position within the surrounding medium, but this issue is currently poorly understood. In this study, phantom measurements of the RF-induced electric currents inside a pacemaker lead were performed to investigate the impact of the device position and lead configuration on the amount of MRI-related heating at the lead tip. Seven hundred twenty device position/lead path configurations were investigated. The results show that certain configurations are associated with a highly increased risk to develop MRI-induced heating, whereas various configurations do not show any significant heating. It was possible to precisely infer implant heating on the basis of current intensity values measured inside a pacemaker lead. Device position and lead configuration relative to the surrounding medium are crucial to the amount of RF-induced heating in MRI. This indicates that a considerable number of implanted devices may incidentally not develop severe heating in MRI because of their specific configuration in the body. Small variations in configuration can, however, strongly increase the risk for such heating effects, meaning that hazardous situations might appear during MRI.",M2
19125341,"Experimental and theoretical investigation of implantable <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> exposed to low frequency magnetic field.This paper presents in vitro investigation of an implantable cardiac pacemaker exposed to low frequency magnetic fields. The method used in this study is based on the interaction by inductive coupling through the loop formed by the pacemaker and its loads and the surrounding medium. This interaction results in an induced electromotive force between the terminals of the pacemaker, which can potentially disturb its operation. The studied frequencies are 50/60 Hz and 10/25 kHz. The experimental tests were carried out on several cardiac pacemakers, single chamber, and dual chamber. The results show a window effect of the detection circuits of cardiac pacemakers for the four studied frequencies. The modelling of the test bed requires studying the effects of the induced currents generated by the application of a magnetic field. Analytical calculations and Numerical simulations were carried out. We modelled the interactions of the magnetic field with a simplified representation of pacemaker embedded in the medium. The comparison of the results in the air and in vitro enabled us to make an equivalent electric model. The results obtained in experimental and theoretical studies allowed us to validate the test bed. The method applied is valid for other medical implants such as cardiac defibrillators, implant hearing aids system...etc.",M2

The aim of this study is to find out the anatomical and physiological worst-case conditions for patients with an implanted pacemaker adjusted to unipolar sensing in external time-varying electric fields. The results of this study with 15 volunteers show that, in electric fields, variation of the interference voltage at the input of a cardiac pacemaker adds up to 200% only because of individual factors. These factors should be considered in human studies and in the setting of safety regulations.",M2
19100958,"Incidence and mortality rates of syncope in the United States.PURPOSE: Syncope is a common cause of hospitalization in the US. The main objective of this study is to determine the incidence and mortality rates when patients are admitted with a principle diagnosis of syncope. METHODS: An observational cross-sectional study included patients with the principle diagnosis of syncope identified from the National Inpatient Sample database for the years 2000-2005. Incidence rate of syncope was adjusted according to the US Census data. In-hospital mortality and its predictors were identified by a logistic regression analysis, and Cochran-Armitage test was used for trend analysis. RESULTS: After data cleansing, 305,932 patients were included in the analysis. Adjusted incidence rate of syncope varied between 0.80 and 0.93 per 1000 person-years and was unchanged over the years included in the analysis. Overall mortality rate is 0.28%, a trend that has not changed over the years (P=0.07). The odds ratio (OR) of death increased with age, becoming more prominent after age 40 years. Hospital mortality is higher in men (OR 1.49; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.30-1.71) and in patients with higher comorbidity index (OR 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20-1.62) for moderate, and (OR 4.14; 95% CI, 3.05-5.61) for severe comorbidity index. The median cost of hospitalization is $8579, which increased by 3- to 11-fold if patients had a <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator. CONCLUSIONS: Syncope remains a common cause of hospital admission. The hospital mortality rate for syncope is low.

METHODS: The clinical data of 57 patients, 38 males and 19 females, aged 74 +/- 8 (56-94), 31 with sick sinus syndrome, 26 with II or III degree atrioventricular block, who underwent 63 times of cardiac permanent pacemaker replacement, including 13 times of lead replacement, were analyzed. RESULTS: The reason of replacement included battery normal exhaustion for 57 case-times, battery exhaustion before the defined schedule for 2 case-times, lead electrodes incompletely fractured for 2 case-times, and infection of pacemaker pocket for 2 case-times. There were 9 cases of placement-related complications: pacemaker pocket hematoma (n=4), lead dislocation (n=3), and abandoned leads falling into the right ventricle (n=2). The average lifetime of old pacemakers was 9. 25 years (2 -15 years). The pacing threshold of ventricular leads after pacemaker replacement was (0.77 +/- 0. 40)V, significantly higher than the initial pacing threshold [(0.60 +/- 0.21)V, P &lt; 0.01]. There were no significant differences in the lead impedance and R wave amplitude between the pacemaker replacement and initial implantation [(854 +/- 136)omega vs. (828 +/- 176)omega, and (12 +/- 4)mV vs. (12 +/- 4)mV, both P &gt; 0.05]. CONCLUSION: The main reason of pacemaker replacement is battery exhaustion. Most implanted ventricular leads still can be used. A rare serious complication of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> replacement operation is abandoned lead falling into the right ventricle, and correct disposing of initial leads help avoid this complication .",M2

RESULTS: There were contributions from 43 countries: 16 from Europe, 13 from the Asia Pacific region, four from the Middle East and Africa, and 10 from the Americas. The United States had the largest number of <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> implants (223,425). Virtually all countries showed increases in implant numbers over the 4 years. High-degree atrioventricular block and sick sinus syndrome remain the major indications for implantation of a cardiac pacemaker, although indications data were not available for large implanting regions such as Europe, Australia, and the United States. There remains a high percentage of VVI(R) pacing in the developing countries, although compared to the 2001 survey, virtually all countries had increased the percentage of DDDR implants, together with a fall in single-lead VDD implants. Pacing leads were predominantly transvenous, bipolar, and passive fixation. There was, however, an increased use of active fixation leads in both the atrium and ventricle. All countries surveyed showed a significant rise in the use of ICDs with the largest implanter being the United States (119,121) with 401 new implants per million population. CONCLUSIONS: Although the numbers of participating countries have fallen, there still remains a group of loyal enthusiastic survey coordinators. Recruitment of new coordinators will hopefully continue in order to obtain a fully global experience of cardiac pacing and ICD usage.",M2

METHODS: We performed a systematic review of the literature to assess the safety (pocket hematoma risk) and efficacy (thromboembolism risk) of different management strategies. We included studies involving patients who were having pacemaker or ICD implantation whenever a portion of these patients were receiving a coumarin and also assessed pocket hematoma or thromboembolism. RESULTS: We identified eight studies that assessed two strategies used for perioperative anticoagulation management: interruption of a coumarin and use of bridging anticoagulation with a short-acting heparin; and perioperative continuation of a coumarin. A strategy involving bridging anticoagulation with therapeutic-dose heparin was associated with an incidence of pocket hematoma of 12-20%. A strategy involving perioperative continuation of a coumarin was associated with an incidence of pocket bleeding of 1.9-6.6%. The incidence of thromboembolic events was 0-1%, irrespective of the perioperative anticoagulation strategy used. CONCLUSION: The perioperative anticoagulation management of patients who require pacemaker or ICD implantation is not established but a strategy involving postoperative bridging with intravenous heparin confers a high risk for bleeding whereas perioperative continuation of a coumarin appears to confer a lower risk for bleeding.",M2

METHODS AND MATERIALS: After a phantom study confirmed the safety of PBT in patients with cardiac pacemakers, we treated 8 patients with implanted pacemakers using PBT to a total tumor dose of 33-77 gray equivalents (GyE) in dose fractions of 2.2-6.6 GyE. The combined total number of PBT sessions was 127. Although all pulse generators remained outside the treatment field, 4 patients had pacing leads in the radiation field. All patients were monitored by means of electrocardiogram during treatment, and pacemakers were routinely examined before and after PBT. RESULTS: The phantom study showed no effect of neutron scatter on pacemaker generators. In the study, changes in heart rate occurred three times (2.4%) in 2 patients. However, these patients remained completely asymptomatic throughout the PBT course. CONCLUSIONS: PBT can result in pacemaker malfunctions that manifest as changes in pulse rate and pulse patterns. Therefore, patients with cardiac pacemakers should be monitored by means of electrocardiogram during PBT.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of five patients with iatrogenic arterial lesions of the internal mammary artery (IMA). The lesions occurred in three patients from a puncture of the subclavian vein during insertion of a central venous catheter and in two patients from a puncture of the subclavian vein for insertion of a pacemaker lead. Four patients had acute symptoms of bleeding with mediastinal hematoma and hematothorax and one patient was investigated in a chronic stage. A pseudoaneurysm was detected in all five patients. All four acute and hemodynamic unstable patients required hemodynamic support. RESULTS: In all patients, embolization was performed using a coaxial catheter technique, and a long segment of the IMA adjacent distally and proximally to the source of bleeding was occluded with pushable microcoils. In one patient, additional mechanically detachable microcoils were used at the very proximal part of the IMA. Microcoil embolization of the IMA was successful in all patients, and the source of bleeding was eliminated in all patients. CONCLUSION: Transarterial coil embolization is a feasible and efficient method in treating acute bleeding and pseudoaneurysm of the IMA and should be considered if mediastinal hematoma or hemathorax occurs after blind puncture of the subclavian vein.",M2

We report the case of a 41-year-old man who presented with refractory partial seizures resulting in syncope leading to severe head trauma, as the only ictal semiology. During presurgical video-EEG monitoring, two episodes of ictal bradycardia followed by asystole and syncope were recorded. A cardiac pacemaker was implanted. At the nine-month follow-up, the patient reported no overt seizures, syncopes or traumatic falls. Our case demonstrates that implantation of a cardiac pacemaker while continuing AEDs may render a patient free from ictal symptoms and prevent ictal syncope and subsequent trauma.

18320115,"[Frequency of Trypanosoma cruzi infection in patients with implanted pacemaker]INTRODUCTION: In Colombia the impact of infections of Trypanosoma cruzi are known to produce chronic cardiopathy and expressed by bradycardia. In Colombia the extent and impact of these infections has not been examined. OBJECTIVE: The current study aimed to determine the prevalence of T. cruzi infection as measured by serology, in a population of patients with cardiopathy that required a permanent pacemaker as treatment for cardiac rhythm abnormalities and conduction blocking. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A cross sectional study sampled 332 patients from the pacemaker clinic at the San Pedro Claver Hospital in Bogotá, Colombia, for one year (2004-2005). Epidemiological and clinical data were obtained through interviews and physical examination. Serological tests consisted of indirect inmunofluorescence assay and ELISA. Statistical analyses were accomplished with chi-square and Students t tests. RESULTS: Of patients with pacemakers, 17.1% had anti-T. cruzi antibodies (seropositive). At the time when the pacemaker was implanted, chronic Chagas disease patients were younger (55+/-13 years) than those patients with cardiopathy (60+/-17 years) with no anti-T. cruzi antibodies (p&lt;0.01). The seropositive group was aware of the Chagas disease vector (83.6%) in contrast to the seronegative group (39.6%, p&lt;0.001). In 60% of the patients of the seropositive group, no clinical signs of the disease were apparent. The geographical origin of the seropositive group were traced to regions in Colombia known to be endemic for Chagas disease transmission. CONCLUSION: Chagas disease prevalence is high in Colombian patients who required a permanent <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>. Chronic Chagas disease patients required pacemaker implant at a younger age in contrast with patients with other cardiac pathologies. The clinical recognition of Chagas disease associated with cardiopathy is low despite the epidemiological data.",M2
18241327,"Low frequency magnetic emissions and resulting induced voltages in a pacemaker by iPod portable music players.BACKGROUND: Recently, malfunctioning of a <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> electromagnetic, caused by electromagnetic interference (EMI) by fields emitted by personal portable music players was highly publicized around the world. A clinical study of one patient was performed and two types of interference were observed when the clinicians placed a pacemaker programming head and an iPod were placed adjacent to the patient's implanted pacemaker. The authors concluded that  Warning labels may be needed to avoid close contact between pacemakers and iPods . We performed an in-vitro study to evaluate these claims of EMI and present our findings of no-effects  in this paper. METHODS: We performed in-vitro evaluations of the low frequency magnetic field emissions from various models of the Apple Inc. iPod music player. We measured magnetic field emissions with a 3-coil sensor (diameter of 3.5 cm) placed within 1 cm of the surface of the player. Highly localized fields were observed (only existing in a one square cm area). We also measured the voltages induced inside an 'instrumented-can' pacemaker with two standard unipolar leads. Each iPod was placed in the air, 2.7 cm above the pacemaker case. The pacemaker case and leads were placed in a saline filled torso simulator per pacemaker electromagnetic compatibility standard ANSI/AAMI PC69:2000. Voltages inside the can were measured. RESULTS: Emissions were strongest ( approximately 0.2 muT pp) near a few localized points on the cases of the two iPods with hard drives. Emissions consisted of 100 kHz sinusoidal signal with lower frequency (20 msec wide) pulsed amplitude modulation. Voltages induced in the iPods were below the noise level of our instruments (0.5 mV pp in the 0 - 1 kHz band or 2 mV pp in the 0 - 5 MHz bandwidth. CONCLUSION: Our measurements of the magnitude and the spatial distribution of low frequency magnetic flux density emissions by 4 different models of iPod portable music players. Levels of less than 0.2 muT exist very close (1 cm) from the case. The measured voltages induced inside an 'instrumented-can' pacemaker were below the noise level of our instruments. Based on the observations of our in-vitro study we conclude that no interference effects can occur in pacemakers exposed to the iPod devices we tested.",M2
18209691,"[Prognosis of isolated atrioventricular block in children. Single center study of 135 cases]INTRODUCTION: Isolated complete atrio-ventricular (AV) block in children occurs in anatomically normal hearts in the absence of any known predisposing factor likely to have caused the block. This study aimed to define the current prognosis of these conduction disorders. METHODS: 135 patients with isolated complete AV block, diagnosed before the age of 15 years, were included in this monocentric, retrospective study. RESULTS: 52.6% of the cases were diagnosed in the antenatal or neonatal period, demonstrating their congenital nature. The disease was heralded by symptoms in only 6.7% of cases. A search for maternal anti-Ro/La antibodies was performed in 111 of the patients. It was positive in 56 cases, and was associated with an early diagnosis, a short delay in <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> implantation, and the occurrence of cardiomyopathy (16 cases), the latter representing a critical point in the progression of the disease (37.5% mortality at 6 years). Among the 55 cases not associated with antibodies, 2 cases were familial and no etiology was discovered in the others. The diagnosis was therefore made later, and no progression to cardiomyopathy was noted. A cardiac pacemaker was implanted in 122 patients (66 epicardial, 56 endocardial). CONCLUSIONS: Isolated complete AV block in children is not a homogenous entity: 'immunological' blocks are genuinely congenital and their prognosis remains grave, owing to the risk of cardiomyopathy, which is sometimes diagnosed late. The other types of block are diagnosed much later in childhood, and their mechanism is still unknown. They have a good prognosis as long as the indications for pacing the child are respected.",M2
18161651,"Successful videocapsule endoscopy in patients with an abdominal <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>.Pacemaker location in the abdominal wall is considered a contraindication to videocapsule endoscopy (VCE). The aim of this study was to review our experience on the use of VCE in patients with a pacemaker located in the abdominal wall. VCE was carried out with monitoring of cardiac rhythm. This was a retrospective review of VCE case studies performed at two tertiary care university medical centers (pediatric and adult). The main outcome measures were adverse events and quality of VCE images. No adverse events were experienced in any of the five patients with implanted cardiac pacemakers, including the two with abdominal pacemaker. No interference with the VCE recording was observed during the studies, although the capsule was observed to be briefly inactivated by the pacemaker in one case. The present study, though small, suggests that VCE is safe in adult and pediatric patients who are fitted with cardiac pacemakers, even when implanted in the abdominal wall. The VCE exam can be carried out successfully under close supervision. Dysfunction of the capsule appears to be more likely than problems with cardiac pacing.",M2

18067067,"Capsule endoscopy and <e>cardiac pacemakers</e>: investigation for possible interference.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: The diagnostic benefit of capsule endoscopy in suspected small-bowel disease is high and seems to be superior to that with conventional methods and scintigraphy. Because of the limited clinical experience in patients with cardiac pacemakers and other implanted electrical devices, it is recommended that capsule endoscopy should not be used in such cases. We investigated the potential for capsule endoscopy to interfere with cardiac pacemakers in vitro. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 21 different pacemakers and leads were positioned in a 0.9 % saline solution in a tank. Pin jacks were placed that were in contact with the solution. The pacemaker impulse was recorded and an inhibiting signal could be coupled in. The capsules (Given Imaging and Olympus) were placed in different positions relative to the cardiac pacemaker and finally placed on the case of the pacemaker, for 1 minute in each site. The functioning of the pacemaker was observed continuously. The effect on the pacemaker was noted particularly as inhibition, synchronization, or no effect. The pacemaker was then inhibited using a standard test signal. RESULTS: There was no interference between the video capsule and the cardiac pacemakers in our experiment in spite of the close proximity of the two devices. CONCLUSION: The clinical use of capsule endoscopy is unproblematic in patients with cardiac pacemakers.",M2
18062936,"Assessment of heart failure and left ventricular systolic dysfunction after cardiac pacing in patients with preserved left ventricular systolic function.BACKGROUND: There is an accumulating data suggesting the deleterious effects of right ventricular pacing on left ventricular performance. Such pacing mimics left bundle branch block resulting in a prolonged QRS duration and causes ventricular asynchrony. AIMS: The purpose of this study is to assess heart failure and left ventricular systolic function after <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> implantation in patients with atrioventricular block and preserved systolic left ventricular function. Secondly, we sought to search for predictive factors of developing left ventricular dysfunction after pacing. METHODS: In this prospective study, we included patients who had been implanted for at least six months. They underwent medical history and examination, 12 leads electrocardiogram and echocardiography before pacemaker implantation and when attending to routine pacemaker follow up. RESULTS: Forty-three patients (22 men and 21 women, age 71+/-12 years) were included in this study. Twenty-nine patients had DDD pacing and 14 VVI pacing. The ventricular lead was implanted in the apex in all patients. After a median follow up of 18+/-11 months, 11 patients (25%) developed signs of congestive heart failure. NYHA was higher after implantation (1.64+/-0.7 versus 2.27+/-0.8, p&gt;0.00001). Left ventricular ejection fraction decreased significantly during follow up (60+/-6% versus 51+/-13%, p=0.0002). Eleven (25%) patients developed left ventricular dysfunction. We compared patients who had left ventricular ejection fraction (LV EF) less or equal to 40% (group A) and patients having LV EF greater than 40% (group B) after implantation. Patients in group A had a paced QRS width significantly larger than group B (181+/-32 ms versus 151+/-26 ms, p=0.002), a significantly prolonged intra left ventricular electromechanical delay (115+/-59 ms versus 45+/-35 ms, p&lt;0.0001) and interventricular delay (44+/-29 ms versus 27+/-18 ms, p=0.02). Age, sex, diabetes hypertension, pacing mode and percentage of ventricular pacing were similar in both groups. A paced QRS width of 180 ms had the best sensitivity and specificity for detecting left ventricular dysfunction: sensitivity=54% and specificity=93%, p=0.01, area under the curve=0.75. CONCLUSION: Patients with atrioventricular block and preserved left ventricular systolic function at baseline decrease significantly left ventricular ejection fraction after pacing. Induced ventricular asynchronism plays a major role in the deterioration of left ventricular function. Prolonged paced QRS width is a good predictor of left ventricular dysfunction after pacing. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm these data.",M2

17938455,"Experimental and numeric investigation about electromagnetic interference between implantable <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> and magnetic fields at power line frequency.The present contribute describes the investigation about the implantable pacemaker (PM) immunity against high level magnetic interfering fields at 50 Hz that a pacemaker wearer could find in his working environment. To this purpose, a test bench has been set up based on a Helmholtz coil for producing extremely low frequency (ELF) magnetic fields and a heart simulator rightly fed by electric signals that simulate atrium and ventricle signals. A widely diffused PM has been tested, under different operation modes and configurations, for both continuous interfering waves (CW) and variously pulsed interfering waves (PW). Pertaining the obtained results, high levels of CW field, only in unipolar mode, produce a behaviour called 'asynchronous mode' (not dangerous). For PW fields, under particular and rare conditions, the complete inhibition occurred (the most dangerous effect for PM wearer). In order to validate experimental results, a numerical 3-D model has been developed to simulate the whole bench system formed by Helmholtz coil, human trunk, pacemaker case and its electric leads. In this model the electromagnetic problem is solved by reconstructing the inhomogeneous bench system associating the relative values of conductivity to each cubic cell in which the whole system is discretized. Application of Maxwell's equations in their integral form has allowed to obtain a 3-D electrical network, whose solution gives the current density distribution inside the heart simulator.",M2

OBJECTIVE: This article discusses the indications for pacemakers, currently available devices, insertion procedure, and patient follow up. DISCUSSION: Pacemakers have evolved from simple, single chamber devices to multichambered devices capable of treating not only bradycardias but also tachycardias and heart failure. An international classification has been developed regarding arrhythmias and the benefits of pacemakers. In class I conditions, the benefits of pacemakers are well established, decreasing symptoms and improving prognosis. The most common indications are for patients with symptomatic bradycardia associated with sick sinus syndrome and heart block. Patients need to attend for regular device follow up and be aware of precautions relating to electromagnetic radiation, but this usually involves little disruption to their day-to-day life.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: The study was a case series of 3 patients with cardiac pacemakers who underwent sacral nerve stimulation for refractory urgency, frequency, and urge incontinence. RESULTS: Each patient underwent placement of an InterStim lead wire in the S3 foramen. Intraoperative cardiac monitoring revealed no evidence of cross-interference, even at maximum stimulation. Postoperative telemetry for 24 hours did not reveal any interference from the sacral nerve stimulator. All patients had a greater than 50% reduction in incontinence episodes during their test trial and underwent placement of the InterStim implantable pulse generator (IPG). Intraoperative and postoperative IPG programming was done with cardiac monitoring; no interaction was detectable.

However, the pacing lead is not always clearly visible because of cardiac insertion via the mediastinum and low contrast on the chest radiograph. We developed an image-processing technique that improves visualization of the cardiac pacing lead on chest radiographs to facilitate management after pacemaker implantation. In this study, 117 chest radiographs obtained during pacemaker follow-up were analyzed. These chest images were smoothed using a median filter, sharpened by unsharp masking, then binarized by thresholding using the moving average method. To evaluate the usefulness of these processed images, four cardiologists compared the original and processed images using the two-sample preference test. As a result, visualization of the pacing lead was significantly improved on all processed images compared with that on the original images. We conclude that this image processing technique can facilitate pacemaker management.",M2
17479032,"The patient with a <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> or implanted defibrillator and management during anaesthesia.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Worldwide, nearly 3 million patients have cardiac pacemakers and more than 300,000 have implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. Many factors cause confusion regarding perioperative care of these patients, since conventional wisdom, case reports, textbooks, and literature reviews have either not kept pace with technologic developments or contain incorrect statements. Additionally, recalls or alert notices have prompted programming changes that might not be understood or recognized. RECENT FINDINGS: The complexity of the devices, as well as features designed to improve both the quality of life and the survival of the patient, can masquerade as pacing malfunction. Additionally, algorithms designed to detect heart rate, ST segment behavior, and arrhythmias in electrocardiographic monitors may lead to inappropriate behavior on the part of the perioperative team. SUMMARY: Appropriate education of perioperative practitioners, as well as preoperative interrogation of a pacemaker or implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, may prevent perioperative delays, cancellations, and deaths. Additionally, evidence suggests that postoperative re-interrogation of any cardiac generator is warranted if an operative event includes the use of monopolar electrosurgery ('Bovie') or significant fluid or blood component administration.",M2
17434892,"Analysis of terminal arrhythmias stored in the memory of pacemakers from patients dying suddenly.AIMS: Stored electrograms or marker channels are available in most of modern <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> models. We sought to analyse these information to uncover terminal events of pacemaker patients dying suddenly. Method and results We made post-mortem pacemaker (PM) interrogations in 19 patients dying suddenly out of hospital between the years 1997 and 2005 (mean age 59 +/- 13 years, 90% males). The systems had activated arrhythmia monitoring algorithms. Indications of pacing were sick sinus syndrome in seven, AV-block in five, and heart failure due to asynchrony in seven cases. The interrogated pacemakers were CHORUS 7034 (n = 12), CONTAK TR (n = 2), and INSYNC III (n = 5). For interpretation stored marker channels and electrograms were analysed. The mean observation time after PM implantation prior death was 2.11 +/- 1.44 years, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction from the last available echo examination in the year prior death was 27.5 +/- 8%, mean age was 63 +/- 12 years. In 17/19 cases (89%), a tachycardia (most likely ventricular tachycardia) was found correlating to the time of death. The mean cycle length of the terminal arrhythmia was 307 +/- 144 (250-344) ms, corresponding to a heart rate of 195 +/- 95 (174-240) bpm. We found no evidence of specific pacemaker-related problems such as electronic failure, battery depletion, or undersensing. CONCLUSIONS: Post-mortem analysis of arrhythmia monitoring of pacemaker patients revealed tachycardias (most likely ventricular tachycardia) to be related to sudden death.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Inclusion criteria were presence of a cardiac pacemaker and urgent clinical need for an MRI examination. Pacemaker-dependent patients and those requiring examinations of the thoracic region were excluded. The study group consisted of 82 pacemaker patients who underwent a total of 115 MRI examinations at 1.5T. To minimize radiofrequency-related lead heating, the specific absorption rate was limited to 1.5 W/kg. All pacemakers were reprogrammed before MRI: If heart rate was &lt;60 bpm, the asynchronous mode was programmed to avoid magnetic resonance (MR)-induced inhibition; if heart rate was &gt;60 bpm, sense-only mode was used to avoid MR-induced competitive pacing and potential proarrhythmia. Patients were monitored with ECG and pulse oximetry. All pacemakers were interrogated immediately before and after the MRI examination and after 3 months, including measurement of pacing capture threshold (PCT) and serum troponin I levels. All MR examinations were completed safely. Inhibition of pacemaker output or induction of arrhythmias was not observed. PCT increased significantly from pre- to post-MRI (P=0.017). In 2 of 195 leads, an increase in PCT was only detected at follow-up. In 4 of 114 examinations, troponin increased from a normal baseline value to above normal after MRI, and in 1 case (troponin pre-MRI 0.02 ng/mL, post-MRI 0.16 ng/mL), this increase was associated with a significant increase in PCT. CONCLUSIONS: Extrathoracic MRI of non-pacemaker-dependent patients can be performed with an acceptable risk-benefit ratio under controlled conditions and by taking both MR- and pacemaker-related precautions.",M2
16923750,"Wild-type and mutant HCN channels in a tandem biological-electronic <e>cardiac pacemaker</e>.BACKGROUND: Biological pacemakers (BPM) implanted in canine left bundle branch function competitively with electronic pacemakers (EPM). We hypothesized that BPM engineered with the use of mE324A mutant murine HCN2 (mHCN2) genes would improve function over mHCN2 and that BPM/EPM tandems confer advantage over either approach alone. METHODS AND RESULTS: In cultured neonatal rat myocytes, activation midpoint was -46.9 mV in mE324A versus -66.1 mV in mHCN2 (P &lt; 0.05). mE324A manifested a positive shift of voltage dependence of gating kinetics of activation and deactivation compared with mHCN2 (P &lt; 0.05) in myocytes as well as Xenopus oocytes. In intact dogs in complete atrioventricular block, saline (control), mHCN2, or mE324A virus was injected into left bundle branch, and EPM were implanted (VVI 45 bpm). Twenty-four-hour ECGs were monitored for 14 days. With EPM discontinued, there was no difference in duration of overdrive suppression among groups. However, basal heart rates in controls were less than those in mHCN2, which did not differ from those in E324A (45 versus 57 versus 53 bpm; P &lt; 0.05). When spontaneous rate fell below 45 bpm, EPM intervened at that rate, triggering 83% of beats in control, contrasting (P &lt; 0.05) with 26% (mHCN2) and 36% (mE324A). On day 14, epinephrine (1 microg/kg per minute IV) induced a 50% heart rate increase in all mE324A, one third of mHCN2, and one fifth of control (P &lt; 0.05 mE324A versus control or mHCN2). CONCLUSIONS: mE324A induces faster, more positive pacemaker current activation than mHCN2 and stable, catecholamine-sensitive rhythms in situ that compete with EPM comparably but more catecholamine responsively than mHCN2. BPM/EPM tandems function reliably, reduce the number of EPM beats, and confer sympathetic responsiveness to the tandem.",M2

We describe an extremely thin 79-year-old Japanese male with a pressure cutaneous ulcer caused by the presence of a pacemaker device. This patient was referred to us with a 1-month history of repeated cutaneous ulcer and exposure of the cardiac pacemaker in the left pectoral area. Conservative treatment was not effective. Treatment with left subcostal implantation of a new pacemaker, which was not wrapped, and disposition of the electrodes in the subcutaneous tissue of the thorax was successful. Cutaneous manifestations have not recurred for 5 years. Considering the poor condition of the patient, subcostal translocation of the pacemaker was a simple and acceptable treatment for pressure cutaneous ulcer over the pacemaker.",M2
16900306,"Implantation of a <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> - comparison of subjective stress and mood between in- and outpatients.BACKGROUND: An increasing number of cardiac pacemaker implantations are performed in the outpatient setting. Studies have compared costs and complication rates of outpatient versus inpatient pacemaker implantations but little is known on the subjective experience of the procedure by patients. METHODS: Between 1999 and 2000, patients were prospectively included at admission to a teaching hospital and to an outpatient clinic for elective pacemaker implantations in Cottbus, Germany. Perioperative stress was assessed prior to the operation as well as on the day after the implantation and 3-4 days later. We used three validated questionnaires to assess stress: the  Short Questionnaire of Current Stress , the  Multidimensional Mood Questionnaire , and the  List of Mood and Emotion Descriptors . RESULTS: A total of 138 patients were enrolled. Of those, 74 patients (mean age: 71+/-12 years; 45% female) had an outpatient implantation compared to 64 patients in the hospital setting (mean age: 73+/-12 years; 53% female). Stress was highest immediately prior to the implantation and lowest on day 3-4 in both groups. Inpatients were significantly less likely to experience agitation compared to outpatients (P=0.002). On the other hand, outpatients reported a significantly higher activity level. There were no differences regarding any of the other dimensions between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Both in- and outpatient cardiac pacemaker implantation are associated with increased preoperative stress. In both groups, however, stress decreases rapidly following the intervention. In the referral of patients, sociodemographic factors such as area of residence will probably play the key role.",M2

To determine the performance of the new MCMS-0102, six devices were implanted in beagle dogs, and two of these devices were reimplanted for continued pacing in a total of eight beagle dogs. The hearts were paced at 260 beats per minute for 4 weeks (P group: n = 8). The hemodynamic status of the P group was examined and compared with nonpaced dogs (NP group: n = 8). The neurohumoral status of the P group was evaluated before and after rapid pacing. Stable operation of the six devices during rapid pacing was confirmed using the telemetry system. Postmortem examinations revealed features similar to clinical heart failure characterized by massive ascites, pleural effusion, cardiomegaly, and liver congestion in all the paced dogs. Cardiac output was 1.1 +/- 0.2 l/min in the NP group and 0.5 +/- 0.1 l/min in the P group (P &lt; 0.0001). The left atrial pressure and the central venous pressure of the P group and the NP group were 23 +/- 6 versus 6 +/- 2 mmHg (P &lt; 0.0001) and 10 +/- 3 versus 4 +/- 3 mmHg (P &lt; 0.001), respectively.

16670254,"Differential regional gene expression from cardiac dyssynchrony induced by chronic right ventricular free wall pacing in the mouse.Routine clinical right ventricular pacing generates left ventricular dyssynchrony manifested by early septal shortening followed by late lateral contraction, which, in turn, reciprocally stretches the septum. Dyssynchrony is disadvantageous to cardiac mechanoenergetics and worsens clinical prognosis, yet little is known about its molecular consequences. Here, we report the influence of cardiac dyssynchrony on regional cardiac gene expression in mice. Mice were implanted with a custom-designed miniature <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> and subjected to 1-wk overdrive right ventricular free wall pacing (720 beats/min, baseline heart rate 520-620 beats/min) to generate dyssynchrony (pacemaker: 3-V lithium battery, rate programmable, 1.5 g, bipolar lead). Electrical capture was confirmed by pulsed-wave Doppler and dyssynchrony by echocardiography. Gene expression from the left ventricular septal and lateral wall myocardium was assessed by microarray (dual-dye method, Agilent) using oligonucleotide probes and dye swap. Identical analysis was applied to four synchronously contracting controls. Of the 22,000 genes surveyed, only 18 genes displayed significant (P &lt; 0.01) differential expression between septal/lateral walls &gt;1.5 times that in synchronous controls. Gene changes were confirmed by quantitative PCR with excellent correlations. Most of the genes (n = 16) showed greater septal expression. Of particular interest were seven genes coding proteins involved with stretch responses, matrix remodeling, stem cell differentiation to myocyte lineage, and Purkinje fiber differentiation. One week of iatrogenic cardiac dyssynchrony triggered regional differential expression in relatively few select genes. Such analysis using a murine implantable pacemaker should facilitate molecular studies of cardiac dyssynchrony and help elucidate novel mechanisms by which stress/stretch stimuli due to dyssynchrony impact the normal and failing heart.",M2

She had undergone spinal fustion surgery 10 days previously, and had a history of chronic renal insufficiency. The patient had been using milk of magnesia and magnesium citrate in unknown amounts to alleviate her constipation over this time frame. During her ED stay she became progressively hypotensive and bradycardic, and despite aggressive resuscitative measures she suffered an asystolic arrest 1 hour into her ED course. She was resuscitated with conventional therapy, but her haemodynamic profile did not improve significantly until transvenous cardiac pacing was employed. Her magnesium level was 10.4 mmol/l. Treatment of magnesium overload has focused upon haemodialysis, forced diuresis, and the use of intravenous calcium salts. Case reports have previously documented survival of moderately to severely ill patients when these modalities have been used. Likewise, failure of resuscitation despite use of these methods has been previously noted. To our knowledge, this is the first reported case clearly demonstrating the efficacy of transvenous cardiac pacing to successfully resuscitate a patient upon whom multiple vasopressors, fluids, and calcium previously had no clear effect.",M2
16442911,"<e>Cardiac pacemaker</e>: in vitro assessment at 1.5 T.BACKGROUND: In vitro testing is used to determine safe parameters before performing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) on a patient with an implant. Therefore, the objective of this study was to evaluate a cardiac pacemaker using a 1.5-T magnetic resonance (MR) system. METHODS: A modern cardiac pacemaker (INSIGNIA I PLUS, Model 1298, and FINELINE II, Model 4471, pacing leads; Guidant Corporation, St Paul, MN) was evaluated for magnetic field interactions at 1.5 T. Magnetic resonance imaging-related heating was assessed using 3 different 1.5-T scanners operating at various levels of radio-frequency power and imaging conditions. Functional aspects of the pacemaker were evaluated immediately before and after MRI (9 different pulse sequences). Artifacts were also characterized. RESULTS: Magnetic field interactions for the pacemaker were minor. Temperature changes measured in vitro were at levels that are not expected to pose a risk for specific MR conditions (&lt; 4.0 degrees C). The function of the pacemaker was unaffected by MRI. Artifacts were minor for the leads and relatively large for the implantable pulse generator. CONCLUSION: The findings indicated that this pacemaker exhibited acceptable safety features relative to the use of a 1.5-T MR system. If induced currents do not occur for this device, it may be safe for a patient to undergo MRI by following specific conditions. The results are specific to the pacemaker tested, the MR systems, and conditions used in this evaluation.",M2

A swab culture, despite poor sensitivity, is the most common method used in specimen collection. OBJECTIVE: To determine the relative value of swab and tissue specimen cultures in patients with implantable <e>cardiac pacemakers</e> and defibrillators. DESIGN: Prospective patient cohort study. SETTING: A 1,000-bed tertiary referral center in Cleveland, Ohio. PATIENTS: Consecutive patients with implantable cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator presenting for lead extraction from October 1, 2000 to March 31, 2001. METHODS: Tissue and swab cultures were prospectively collected during pacemaker and implantable defibrillator surgeries that required lead extraction. Clinical manifestations, microbiology, and echocardiographic data were recorded in patients with and without a clinical diagnosis of device system infection. RESULTS: Seventy-one patients with implantable pacemaker (n = 49, 69%), implantable defibrillator (n = 18, 25%), or both devices (n = 4, 6%) requiring lead extraction had pocket swab and tissue cultures for analysis. Infection was evident clinically in 35 (49%) of the patients and absent in the remainder. The most common bacteria isolated were coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (37%) and Staphylococcus aureus (10%). Patients with clinical infection had positive cultures more frequently (P = 0.002) by pocket tissue culture (n = 24, 69%) than by swab culture (n = 11, 31%). However, patients without clinical infections had positive cultures at similar rates by pocket tissue culture (n = 10, 28%) and by swab culture (n = 8, 22%; P = 0.48). Patients without clinical infection were not treated with other than perioperative antibiotics, and did not develop clinical infections. CONCLUSION: Pocket tissue cultures are more effective than pocket swab cultures for the isolation and identification of the infectious pathogens in cardiac device infections. Positive cultures by pocket swab or tissue cultures in the absence of clinical signs and symptoms of infection does not imply infection or the need for specific therapy.",M2
16329014,"Effects of capsule endoscopy on <e>cardiac pacemakers</e>.BACKGROUND AND STUDY AIMS: Capsule endoscopy is a new, noninvasive diagnostic technique which enables visualization of the mucosa of the small intestine in physiological conditions and without the need to subject the patient to external radiation. Wireless capsule video endoscopy is contraindicated in patients with a cardiac pacemaker. However, on the basis of the characteristics of the radiofrequency band used by the endoscopic capsule, together with a series of other factors, it is possible that the patient's use of a pacemaker should not be a contraindication to capsule endoscopy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This work had two phases: an in vitro study, using an interference detector, and an in vivo study involving 20 patients with cardiac pacemakers who showed symptoms or signs that justified a capsule endoscopy investigation. RESULTS: No interference was observed during the first, in vitro, phase of the study. In the second phase, patients wore a Holter recorder for a mean time of 10 hours, during which the average number of recorded QRS complexes exceeded 30,000. All the pacemakers functioned normally. Interference due only to myopotentials was detected in a single patient in whom modification of the pacemaker programming was necessary. In the other 19 patients, neither sensing nor stimulation failures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: No interference between the pacemaker and the endoscopic capsule was observed. All the pacemakers functioned normally, and no increased incidence of adverse effects was observed. Neither was any pacemaker-induced interference observed on the capsule endoscopy images.",M2

METHODS: From 1991, 71 patients with AVB or SSS who used 9 kinds of dual-chamber PM were followed up. Every installed PM's related parameters, such as sensing electric current, resistance and pacing electric voltage, which may affect the PM longevity voltage had been recorded regularly. At the end point of survey, according to the related parameters of patients and PMs, the 71 patients were grouped into several groups. Then the related parameters were analyzed by statistical methods. RESULTS: The average of PM service life is 111 months +/- 19 months. Patient's basal heart rate, battery capacity, pacing electric voltage, pacing frequency, resistance, threshold value, pulse width and sensing electric current had all affected the PM's longevity (all P &lt; 0.05) counted by Wilcoxon (Gehan) test. Sensing electric current (P = 0.000, RR = 3.072, 95% CI = 2.130 - 4.429), pacing electric voltage (P = 0.040, RR = 2.121, 95% CI = 1.126 - 3.998) and resistance (P = 0.049, RR = 1.786, 95% CI = 1.007 - 3.169) were the important predicting indictors of the PM longevity by Cox'proportional hazard risk regression analysis. CONCLUSION: Sensing electric current, pacing electric voltage and resistance are the important affecting factors of the PM longevity.

16216763,"Twins with implanted pacemakers: Is there an increased mortality risk for the co-twin? A follow-up study based on the Danish Twin Registry and the Danish Pacemaker Register.BACKGROUND: The main indications for implanting a <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> are either acquired atrio-ventricular block (AVB) or sick sinus syndrome (SSS). In general, the exact aetiology of these conditions is unknown. Genetic factors may play a role. Untreated AVB is associated with increased mortality but SSS seems to have a good prognosis. The present study was designed to assess whether first-degree relatives of these patients have an increased mortality risk. METHODS: We investigated the survival pattern of the co-twins of twins who have had a cardiac pacemaker implanted, by linking two nationwide registries in Denmark: the Danish Pacemaker Register and the Danish Twin Registry. For each  pacemaker-twin  four control-twins matched with respect to age, sex, and zygosity were selected among the twins who were alive at the time of the pacemaker implantation. A total of 159 twins with a pacemaker treated bradycardia of unknown aetiology were identified of which 73 had AVB and 64 had SSS. A total of 622 matched control-twins could be identified. The survival from age six of the co-twins of the  pacemaker-twins  was compared with that of the co-twins of the control-twins. The follow-up period ended January 1st, 2000. FINDINGS: The survival curves for the co-twins of the  pacemaker-twins  were virtually identical to those of the co-twins of the control-twins. This finding was consistent for both AVB and SSS and for monozygotic as well as dizygotic twins.

METHODS: For 55 procedures concerning three different types of pacemakers (DDD, VDD, and VVI), the dose-area product (DAP) meter readings and fluoroscopy times were recorded. From these data, the dose to the operating cardiologist was estimated. RESULTS: The median values of DAP and fluoroscopy time for all the procedures monitored were 11.4 Gycm(2) and 6.6 minute, respectively. For the 22 DDD, 21 VDD, and 12 VVI pacemakers implanted, the respective DAP median values were 14.7, 9.9, and 7.3 Gycm(2) and the respective median fluoroscopy times were 8.4, 5, and 2.9 minutes. The median doses to the hands, chest, eyes, and legs of the cardiologist conducting the manipulations were estimated to 0.21, 0.06, 0.03, and 0.11 mGy, respectively, per procedure. CONCLUSIONS: Compared to the existing literature, the median DAP value of this study is almost identical to the 11.2 Gycm(2) reported from a sample of 627 patients in 17 different x-ray rooms, whereas the fluoroscopy times are within the range of values reported by other authors. Concerning the cardiologist exposure, the estimated values indicate that the implantation of pacemakers is a procedure that does not involve a severe risk, especially if it is taken into account that lead aprons and collars are routinely used.",M2

The purpose of this study was to investigate a safer and improved implanting procedure. METHODS AND RESULTS: Venipuncture guided by US with a 7.5 MHz convex transducer was performed to implant 32 leads in 18 patients. US enabled identification and location of the vein and needle tip during puncture and clarified the reasons for unsuccessful venipuncture. Venipuncture was successful on the second attempt or within 2 min in 90.6% (29/32) and 84.4% (27/32) of lead placements, respectively, although the vein was small (mean, 7.8 mm), deep (mean, 22.7 mm), and required a large angle of entry (mean, 52.4). The subclavian artery or lung was adjacent to the vein in 50.0% and 27.8% of cases, respectively. The flexible wall of the vein interfered with the penetration of the needle in 33.3% of cases. It was often difficult to locate the needle tip because of poor visualization.

However, the simultaneous influence of multiphase electric and magnetic fields beneath high voltage overhead lines (HVOLs) has not yet been investigated. Therefore, the distribution of the electric and the magnetic field as well as the phase angle between both components for an exemplary HVOL was numerically calculated. The calculations show that the phase difference of the capacitive and the inductive induced voltage on the input of an implanted cardiac pacemaker is position-dependent. Based on these and our earlier results a worst-case-scenario for two virtual patients beneath an exemplary HVOL was derived. It turned out that although the interference of CPMs by the electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of HVOLs cannot be ruled out, the life-threatening interference condition 'inhibition by EMF' is unlikely. Due to various factors depending on technical parameters and the individual patient a definite answer about the disturbance of an implanted CPM beneath HVOLs can be given by studies with real CPM patients only.",M2

In an attempt to quantitatively investigate the electromagnetic interference caused by an induction oven on implantable unipolar cardiac pacemakers, we measured the distribution profile of the magnetic field intensity, both with and without a pan on the induction oven. We also performed the inhibition test and asynchronous test using four kinds of pacemakers housed in the standardized Irnich human body model, and measured the maximal distance from the induction oven up to which the interference occurred. In the pan-detection mode of the oven in the absence of a pan, the distribution profile of the magnetic field intensity peaked at the center of the cooking plate, and during induction heating of a pan placed on the induction oven, it was the largest at the circular top-edge of the pan. Pacemaker pulses were inhibited by the induction oven, or generated by the reversion mechanism. The maximal interference distance from the oven was 34 cm for one of the pacemakers. Thus, the safe distance from an induction oven of a patient with an implanted cardiac pacemaker is considered to be 50 cm or more. In conclusion, in the pan-detection mode of the oven in the absence of a pan, the distribution profile of the magnetic field intensity peaked at the center of the cooking plate, and during the induction heating of a pan placed on the oven, it peaked at the circular edge of the pan.

15897520,"Ictal asystole with convulsive syncope mimicking secondary generalisation: a depth electrode study.Ictal bradycardia is rare and its localising value is debated. Bradyarrhythmias are, however, important because of their potential connection to sudden death and ability to affect clinical seizure manifestations. Cerebral hypoperfusion induces loss of consciousness, at times with myoclonic jerks, whose clinical differentiation from a generalised convulsive seizure may prove difficult. Two invasive and five surface monitored seizures recorded over two years in a 51 year old woman with post-traumatic epilepsy characterised by seizure-triggered asystole were analysed. All seven seizures showed left temporal onset. Both intracranially recorded events started in the left anterior hippocampus/amygdala, spreading to the contralateral hippocampus in 35 and 25 seconds. Within 10 seconds an electrocardiogram showed asystole lasting 21 and 28 seconds, associated with suppression of recorded cerebral electrical activity, except a polyspike suppression pattern remaining in the hippocampi. Clinically, the patient, concomitantly with the cerebral suppression, developed myoclonic twitches of the limbs. A dual chamber <e>cardiac pacemaker</e> was implanted; at 11 months follow up, the patient has experienced only infrequent partial seizures, with none involving falls or shaking. Left temporal lobe seizures produced convulsive syncope initiated by ictal asystole. These observations suggest that intertemporal spread is necessary, though not sufficient, to produce bradycardia and asystole. Furthermore, pacemakers may decrease seizure severity, as well as potentially protect against malignant bradyarrhythmias.",M2
