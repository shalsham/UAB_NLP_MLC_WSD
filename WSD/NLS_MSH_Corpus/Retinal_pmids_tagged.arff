20369810,"Studies of the ground and excited-state surfaces of the <e>retinal</e> chromophore using CAM-B3LYP.The isomerization of the 11-cis isomer (PSB11) of the retinal chromophore to its all-trans isomer (PSBT) is examined. Optimized structures on both the ground state and the excited state are calculated, and the dependence on torsional angles in the carbon chain is investigated. Time-dependent density functional theory is used to produce excitation energies and the excited-state surface. To avoid problems with the description of excited states that can arise with standard DFT methods, the CAM-B3LYP functional was used. Comparing CAM-B3LYP with B3LYP results indicates that the former is significantly more accurate, as a consequence of which detailed cross sections of the retinal excited-state surface are obtained.",M1
20331421,"Femtosecond formation dynamics of primary photoproducts of visual pigment rhodopsin.The coherent 11-cis-<e>retinal</e> photoisomerization dynamics in bovine rhodopsin was studied by femtosecond time-resolved laser absorption spectroscopy at 30-fs resolution. Femtosecond pulses of 500, 535, and 560 nm wavelength were used for rhodopsin excitation to produce different initial Franck-Condon states and relevant distinct values of the vibrational energy of the molecule in its electron excited state. Time evolution of the photoinduced rhodopsin absorption spectra was monitored after femtosecond excitation in the spectral range of 400-720 nm. Oscillations of the time-resolved absorption signals of rhodopsin photoproducts represented by photorhodopsin(570) with vibrationally-excited all-trans-retinal and rhodopsin(498) in its initial state with vibrationally-excited 11-cis-retinal were studied. These oscillations reflect the dynamics of coherent vibrational wave-packets in the ground state of photoproducts. Fourier analysis of these oscillatory components has revealed frequencies, amplitudes, and initial phases of different vibrational modes, along which the motion of wave-packets of both photoproducts occurs. The main vibrational modes established are 62, 160 cm(-1) and 44, 142 cm(-1) for photorhodopsin(570) and for rhodopsin(498), respectively. These vibrational modes are directly involved in the coherent reaction under the study, and their amplitudes in the power spectrum obtained through the Fourier transform of the kinetic curves depend on the excitation wavelength of rhodopsin.",M1
20237707,"Coherent ultrafast torsional motion and isomerization of a biomimetic dipolar photoswitch.Femtosecond fluorescence up-conversion, UV-Vis and IR transient absorption spectroscopy are used to study the photo-isomerization dynamics of a new type of zwitterionic photoswitch based on a N-alkylated indanylidene pyrroline Schiff base framework (ZW-NAIP). The system is biomimetic, as it mimics the photophysics of <e>retinal</e>, in coupling excited state charge translocation and isomerization. While the fluorescence lifetime is 140 fs, excited state absorption persists over 230 fs in the form of a vibrational wavepacket according to twisting of the isomerizing double bond. After a short  dark  time window in the UV-visible spectra, which we associate with the passage through a conical intersection (CI), the wavepacket appears on the ground state potential energy surface, as evidenced by the transient mid-IR data. This allows for a precise timing of the photoreaction all the way from the initial Franck-Condon region, through the CI and into both ground state isomers, until incoherent vibrational relaxation dominates the dynamics. The photo-reaction dynamics remarkably follow those observed for retinal in rhodopsin, with the additional benefit that in ZW-NAIP the conformational change reverses the zwitterion dipole moment direction. Last, the pronounced low-frequency coherences make these molecules ideal systems for investigating wavepacket dynamics in the vicinity of a CI and for coherent control experiments.",M1
20230054,"Sequential rearrangement of interhelical networks upon rhodopsin activation in membranes: the Meta II(a) conformational substate.Photon absorption by rhodopsin is proposed to lead to an activation pathway that is described by the extended reaction scheme Meta I &lt;==&gt;Meta II(a) &lt;==&gt; Meta II(b) &lt;==&gt; Meta II(b)H(+), where Meta II(b)H(+) is thought to be the conformational substate that activates the G protein transducin. Here we test this extended scheme for rhodopsin in a membrane bilayer environment by investigating lipid perturbation of the activation mechanism. We found that symmetric membrane lipids having two unsaturated acyl chains, such as 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DOPC), selectively stabilize the Meta II(a) substate in the above mechanism. By combining FTIR and UV-visible difference spectroscopy, we characterized the structural and functional changes involved in the transition to the Meta II(a) intermediate, which links the inactive Meta I intermediate with the Meta II(b) states formed by helix rearrangement. Besides the opening of the Schiff base ionic lock, the Meta II(a) substate is characterized by an activation switch in a conserved water-mediated hydrogen-bonded network involving transmembrane helices H1/H2/H7, which is sensed by its key residue Asp83. On the other hand, movement of <e>retinal</e> toward H5 and its interaction with another interhelical H3/H5 network mediated by His211 and Glu122 is absent in Meta II(a). The latter rearrangement takes place only in the subsequent transition to Meta II(b), which has been previously associated with movement of H6. Our results imply that activating structural changes in the H1/H2/H7 network are triggered by disruption of the Schiff base salt bridge and occur prior to other chromophore-induced changes in the H3/H5 network and the outward tilt of H6 in the activation process.",M1
20230053,"Low-temperature FTIR study of Gloeobacter rhodopsin: presence of strongly hydrogen-bonded water and long-range structural protein perturbation upon <e>retinal</e> photoisomerization.Gloeobacter rhodopsin (GR) is a light-driven proton-pump protein similar to bacteriorhodopsin (BR), found in Gloeobacter violaceus PCC 7421, a primitive cyanobacterium. In this paper, structural changes of GR following retinal photoisomerization are studied by means of low-temperature Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The initial motivation was to test our hypothesis that proton-pumping rhodopsins possess strongly hydrogen-bonded water molecules in the active center. Water O-D stretching vibrations at &lt;2400 cm(-1) in D(2)O have been regarded as coming from such strongly hydrogen-bonded water, and there is a strong correlation between the proton-pumping activity and the presence of such water molecule. Since GR pumps protons, we expected that GR also possesses strongly hydrogen-bonded water molecule(s), and the FTIR results clearly show that this is indeed the case. In addition, another unexpected finding was gained from the frequency region of protonated carboxylic acids in the GR(K) minus GR spectra at 77 K, where we observed the unique bands of a protonated carboxylic acid at 1735 (+)/1730 (-) cm(-1). Comprehensive mutation study revealed that the vibrational bands originate from the carboxylic C=O stretch of Glu132 at the position corresponding to Asp96 in BR. Glu132 presumably functions as an internal proton donor for the retinal Schiff base, but they may be located far apart (ca. 12 A in BR). The present study demonstrates the long-range structural changes of GR along the proton pathway, even though the protein matrix is frozen at 77 K.",M1
20192770,"Structure and activation of the visual pigment rhodopsin.Rhodopsin is a specialized G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) found in vertebrate rod cells. Absorption of light by its 11-cis <e>retinal</e> chromophore leads to rapid photochemical isomerization and receptor activation. Recent results from protein crystallography and NMR spectroscopy show how structural changes on the extracellular side of rhodopsin induced by retinal isomerization are coupled to the motion of membrane-spanning helices to create a G protein binding pocket on the intracellular side of the receptor. The signaling pathway provides a comprehensive explanation for the conservation of specific amino acids and structural motifs across the class A family of GPCRs, as well as for the conservation of selected residues within the visual receptor subfamily. The emerging model of activation indicates that, rather than being unique, the visual receptors provide a basis for understanding the common structural and dynamic elements in the class A GPCRs.",M1
20182540,"The <e>retinal</e> pigment epithelium: something more than a constituent of the blood-retinal barrier--implications for the pathogenesis of diabetic retinopathy.The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) is an specialized epithelium lying in the interface between the neural retina and the choriocapillaris where it forms the outer blood-retinal barrier (BRB). The main functions of the RPE are the following: (1) transport of nutrients, ions, and water, (2) absorption of light and protection against photooxidation, (3) reisomerization of all-trans-retinal into 11-cis-retinal, which is crucial for the visual cycle, (4) phagocytosis of shed photoreceptor membranes, and (5) secretion of essential factors for the structural integrity of the retina. An overview of these functions will be given. Most of the research on the physiopathology of diabetic retinopathy has been focused on the impairment of the neuroretina and the breakdown of the inner BRB. By contrast, the effects of diabetes on the RPE and in particular on its secretory activity have received less attention. In this regard, new therapeutic strategies addressed to modulating RPE impairment are warranted.",M1
20155894,"Degenerate two-photon absorption in all-trans <e>retinal</e>: nonlinear spectrum and theoretical calculations.In this work we investigate the degenerate two-photon absorption spectrum of all-trans retinal in ethanol employing the Z-scan technique with femtosecond pulses. The two-photon absorption (2PA) spectrum presents a monotonous increase as the excitation wavelength approaches the one-photon absorption band and a peak at 790 nm. We attribute the 2PA band to the mixing of states (1)B(u)(+)-like and |S(1)&gt;, which are strongly allowed by one- and two-photon, respectively. We modeled the 2PA spectrum by using the sum-over-states approach and obtained spectroscopic parameters of the electronic transitions to |S(1)&gt;, |S(2)&gt; ( (1)B(u)(+) ), |S(3)&gt;, and |S(4)&gt; singlet-excited states. The results were compared with theoretical predictions of one- and two-photon transition calculations using the response functions formalism within the density functional theory framework with the aid of the CAM-B3LYP functional.",M1
20060393,"Regulation of photoreceptor gene expression by the <e>retinal</e> homeobox (Rx) gene product.The retinal homeobox (Rx) gene product is essential for eye development. However little is known about its molecular function. It has been demonstrated that Rx binds to photoreceptor conserved element (PCE-1), a highly conserved element found in the promoter region of photoreceptor-specific genes such as rhodopsin and red cone opsin. We verify that Rx is co-expressed with rhodopsin and red cone opsin in maturing photoreceptors and demonstrate that Rx binds to the rhodopsin and red cone opsin promoters in vivo. We also find that Rx can cooperate with the Xenopus analogs of Crx and Nrl, otx5b and XLMaf (respectively), to activate a Xenopus opsin promoter-dependent reporter. Finally, we demonstrate that reduction of Rx expression in tadpoles results in decreases in expression of several PCE-1 containing photoreceptor genes, abnormal photoreceptor morphology, and impaired vision. Our data suggests that Rx, in combination with other transcription factors, is necessary for normal photoreceptor gene expression, maintenance, and function. This establishes a direct role for Rx in regulation of genes expressed in a differentiated cell type.",M1
20053991,"A pivot between helices V and VI near the <e>retinal</e>-binding site is necessary for activation in rhodopsins.Rhodopsins are photoreceptor proteins that have diverged from ligand-binding G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Unlike other GPCRs, rhodopsins contain an intrinsic antagonist, 11-cis-retinal, which is converted to the agonist all-trans-retinal upon absorption of a photon. Through evolution, vertebrate rhodopsins have lost the ability of direct binding to the agonist, but some invertebrate and vertebrate non-visual rhodopsins have retained this ability. Here, we investigated the difference in the agonist-binding state between these rhodopsins to further our understanding of the structural and functional diversity of rhodopsins. Mutational analyses of agonist-binding rhodopsin showed that replacement of Ala-269, one of the residues constituting the antagonist-binding site, with bulky amino acids resulted in a large spectral shift in its active state and a great reduction in G protein activity, whereas these were rescued by subsequent replacement of Phe-208 with smaller amino acids. Although similar replacements in vertebrate rhodopsin did not cause a spectral shift in the active state, a similar reduction in and recovery of G protein activity was observed. Therefore, the agonist is located close to Ala-269 in the agonist-binding rhodopsin, but not in vertebrate rhodopsins, and Ala-269 with Phe-208 acts as a pivot for the formation of the G protein-activating state in both rhodopsins. The positions corresponding to Ala-269 and Phe-208 in other GPCRs have been reported to form part of an agonist-binding site. Therefore, an agonist-binding rhodopsin has the molecular architecture of the agonist-binding site similar to that of a general GPCR, whereas vertebrate rhodopsins changed the architecture, resulting in loss of agonist binding during molecular evolution.",M1
20042594,"Covalent bond between ligand and receptor required for efficient activation in rhodopsin.Rhodopsin is an extensively studied member of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Although rhodopsin shares many features with the other GPCRs, it exhibits unique features as a photoreceptor molecule. A hallmark in the molecular structure of rhodopsin is the covalently bound chromophore that regulates the activity of the receptor acting as an agonist or inverse agonist. Here we show the pivotal role of the covalent bond between the <e>retinal</e> chromophore and the lysine residue at position 296 in the activation pathway of bovine rhodopsin, by use of a rhodopsin mutant K296G reconstituted with retinylidene Schiff bases. Our results show that photoreceptive functions of rhodopsin, such as regiospecific photoisomerization of the ligand, and its quantum yield were not affected by the absence of the covalent bond, whereas the activation mechanism triggered by photoisomerization of the retinal was severely affected. Furthermore, our results show that an active state similar to the Meta-II intermediate of wild-type rhodopsin did not form in the bleaching process of this mutant, although it exhibited relatively weak G protein activity after light irradiation because of an increased basal activity of the receptor. We propose that the covalent bond is required for transmitting structural changes from the photoisomerized agonist to the receptor and that the covalent bond forcibly keeps the low affinity agonist in the receptor, resulting in a more efficient G protein activation.",M1
19995077,"Fluoro derivatives of <e>retinal</e> illuminate the decisive role of the C(12)-H element in photoisomerization and rhodopsin activation.Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the vertebrate rod cell, is among the best investigated members of the G-protein-coupled receptor family. Within this family a unique characteristic of visual pigments is their covalently bound chromophore, 11-cis retinal, which acts as an inverse agonist. Upon illumination it can be transformed into the all-trans isomer that acts as a full agonist. This photoisomerization process is extremely efficient: 2 out of 3 photons are effective, full stereoselectivity is achieved, and stereoinversion occurs within 200 fs. The mechanism behind this process is still not really understood, although the available evidence points at the twisted C(9)-C(13) segment of the 11-cis ligand as the quintessence. To further dissect the role of this segment, we have generated the 10-fluoro, 12-fluoro, and 14-fluoro analogues of rhodopsin. A fluoro substituent brings in only little more volume than hydrogen, but considerably more mass and polarizability. The analogue pigments were compared to rhodopsin with respect to their photosensitivity (quantum yield), light-induced structural transitions (UV-vis and FT-IR spectroscopy), and signaling activity (G protein activation rate). We find that 14-F substitution is quite neutral, while 10-F and 12-F substitutions exert significant but distinct effects. The 10-F pigment exhibits a quantum yield similar to that of rhodopsin (0.65) but strongly perturbed thermodynamics of the structural transitions following photoactivation and only 20% of the native signaling activity. The 12-F pigment exhibits a significantly decreased quantum yield (0.47) and signaling activity (30%) but mixed effects on the structural transitions. These properties are compared to those of the corresponding methyl derivatives. We conclude that rotation of the C(12)-H bond of the rhodopsin chromophore is a major rate-limiting factor in the photoisomerization process, while the C(10)-H moiety plays a dominant role in ligand relaxation and further rearrangements following photoactivation.",M1
19928893,"Reaction pathways of photoexcited <e>retinal</e> in proteorhodopsin studied by pump-dump-probe spectroscopy.Proteorhodopsin (pR) is a membrane-embedded proton pump from the microbial rhodopsin family. Light absorption by its retinal chromophore initiates a photocycle, driven by trans/cis isomerization on the femtosecond to picosecond time scales. Here, we report a study on the photoisomerization dynamics of the retinal chromophore of pR, using dispersed ultrafast pump-dump-probe spectroscopy. The application of a pump pulse initiates the photocycle, and with an appropriately tuned dump pulse applied at a time delay after the dump, the molecules in the initial stages of the photochemical process can be de-excited and driven back to the ground state. In this way, we were able to resolve an intermediate on the electronic ground state that represents chromophores that are unsuccessful in isomerization. In particular, the fractions of molecules that undergo slow isomerization (20 ps) have a high probability to enter this state rather than the isomerized K-state. On the ground state reaction surface, return to the stable ground state conformation via a structural or vibrational relaxation occurs in 2-3 ps. Inclusion of this intermediate in the kinetic scheme led to more consistent spectra of the retinal-excited state, and to a more accurate estimation of the quantum yield of isomerization (Phi = 0.4 at pH 6).",M1
19913029,"Molecular mechanisms of rhodopsin retinitis pigmentosa and the efficacy of pharmacological rescue.Variants of rhodopsin, a complex of 11-cis <e>retinal</e> and opsin, cause retinitis pigmentosa (RP), a degenerative disease of the retina. Trafficking defects due to rhodopsin misfolding have been proposed as the most likely basis of the disease, but other potentially overlapping mechanisms may also apply. Pharmacological therapies for RP must target the major disease mechanism and contend with overlap, if it occurs. To this end, we have explored the molecular basis of rhodopsin RP in the context of pharmacological rescue with 11-cis retinal. Stable inducible cell lines were constructed to express wild-type opsin; the pathogenic variants T4R, T17M, P23A, P23H, P23L, and C110Y; or the nonpathogenic variants F220L and A299S. Pharmacological rescue was measured as the fold increase in rhodopsin or opsin levels upon addition of 11-cis retinal during opsin expression. Only Pro23 and T17M variants were rescued significantly. C110Y opsin was produced at low levels and did not yield rhodopsin, whereas the T4R, F220L, and A299S proteins reached near-wild-type levels and changed little with 11-cis retinal. All of the mutant rhodopsins exhibited misfolding, which increased over a broad range in the order F220L, A299S, T4R, T17M, P23A, P23H, P23L, as determined by decreased thermal stability in the dark and increased hydroxylamine sensitivity. Pharmacological rescue increased as misfolding decreased, but was limited for the least misfolded variants. Significantly, pathogenic variants also showed abnormal photobleaching behavior, including an increased ratio of metarhodopsin-I-like species to metarhodopsin-II-like species and aberrant photoproduct accumulation with prolonged illumination. These results, combined with an analysis of published biochemical and clinical studies, suggest that many rhodopsin variants cause disease by affecting both biosynthesis and photoactivity. We conclude that pharmacological rescue is promising as a broadly effective therapy for rhodopsin RP, particularly if implemented in a way that minimizes the photoactivity of the mutant proteins.",M1
19889630,"NinaB is essential for Drosophila vision but induces <e>retinal</e> degeneration in opsin-deficient photoreceptors.In animals, visual pigments are essential for photoreceptor function and survival. These G-protein-coupled receptors consist of a protein moiety (opsin) and a covalently bound 11-cis-retinylidene chromophore. The chromophore is derived from dietary carotenoids by oxidative cleavage and trans-to-cis isomerization of double bonds. In vertebrates, the necessary chemical transformations are catalyzed by two distinct but structurally related enzymes, the carotenoid oxygenase beta-carotenoid-15,15'-monooxygenase and the retinoid isomerase RPE65 (retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa). Recently, we provided biochemical evidence that these reactions in insects are catalyzed by a single enzyme family member named NinaB. Here we show that in the fly pathway, carotenoids are mandatory precursors of the chromophore. After chromophore formation, the retinoid-binding protein Pinta acts downstream of NinaB and is required to supply photoreceptors with chromophore. Like ninaE encoding the opsin, ninaB expression is eye-dependent and is activated as a downstream target of the eyeless/pax6 and sine oculis master control genes for eye development. The requirement for coordinated synthesis of chromophore and opsin is evidenced by analysis of ninaE mutants. Retinal degeneration in opsin-deficient photoreceptors is caused by the chromophore and can be prevented by restricting its supply as seen in an opsin and chromophore-deficient double mutant. Thus, our study identifies NinaB as a key component for visual pigment production and provides evidence that chromophore in opsin-deficient photoreceptors can elicit retinal degeneration.",M1
19842712,"Reconstitution of Gloeobacter violaceus rhodopsin with a light-harvesting carotenoid antenna.We show that salinixanthin, the light-harvesting carotenoid antenna of xanthorhodopsin, can be reconstituted into the <e>retinal</e> protein from Gloeobacter violaceus expressed in Escherichia coli. Reconstitution of gloeobacter rhodopsin with the carotenoid is accompanied by characteristic absorption changes and the appearance of CD bands similar to those observed for xanthorhodopsin that indicate immobilization and twist of the carotenoid in the binding site. As in xanthorhodopsin, the carotenoid functions as a light-harvesting antenna. The excitation spectrum for retinal fluorescence emission shows that ca. 36% of the energy absorbed by the carotenoid is transferred to the retinal. From excitation anisotropy, we calculate the angle between the two chromophores as being ca. 50 degrees , similar to that in xanthorhodopsin. The results indicate that gloeobacter rhodopsin binds salinixanthin in a manner similar to that of xanthorhodopsin and suggest that it might bind a carotenoid also in vivo. In the crystallographic structure of xanthorhodopsin, the conjugated chain of the carotenoid lies on the surface of helices E and F, and the 4-keto ring is immersed in the protein at van der Waals distance from the ionone ring of the retinal. The 4-keto ring is in the space occupied by a tryptophan in bacteriorhodopsin, which is replaced by the smaller glycine in xanthorhodopsin and gloeobacter rhodopsin. Specific binding of the carotenoid and its light-harvesting function are eliminated by a single mutation of the gloeobacter protein that replaces this glycine with a tryptophan. This indicates that the 4-keto ring is critically involved in carotenoid binding and suggests that a number of other recently identified retinal proteins, from a diverse group of organisms, could also contain carotenoid antenna since they carry the homologous glycine near the retinal.",M1
19809672,"Acceleration of the Z to E photoisomerization of penta-2,4-dieniminium by hydrogen out-of-plane motion: theoretical study on a model system of <e>retinal</e> protonated Schiff base.We report the result of comparison between two reaction coordinates [on the potential energy surface of the first excited state (S(1))] produced by CASSCF and these energies recalculated by MRMP2 in the Z to E photoisomerization of penta-2,4-dieniminium (PDI) as the minimal model of the retinal protonated Schiff base (RPSB). One coordinate is the S(1) state minimum-energy-path (MEP) in mass-weighted coordinates from the S(1) vertically excited point, where a strong hydrogen-out-of plane (HOOP) motion is not exhibited. The energy profile of the S(1) MEP at the MRMP2//CASSCF level shows a barrier for the rotation around the reactive C-C and hits the S(1)/S(0) degeneracy space where the central C-C-C-C dihedral angle is distorted by 65 degrees . The other coordinate is an S(1) coordinate obtained by the relaxed scan strategy. The relaxed coordinate along the central C-C-C-C dihedral angle, which we call the HOOP coordinate, shows strong HOOP motion. According to the MRMP2//CASSCF calculation, there is no barrier on the HOOP coordinate. Furthermore, the S(1) to S(0) transition may be possible without the large skeletal deformation by HOOP motion because the HOOP coordinate encounters the S(1)/S(0) degeneracy space where the central C-C-C-C dihedral angle is distorted by only 40 degrees . Consequently, if PDI is a suitable model molecule for the RPSB as often assumed, the 11-cis to all-trans photoisomerization is predicted to be accelerated by the HOOP motion.",M1
19801547,"Calnexin improves the folding efficiency of mutant rhodopsin in the presence of pharmacological chaperone 11-cis-<e>retinal</e>.The lectin chaperone calnexin (Cnx) is important for quality control of glycoproteins, and the chances of correct folding of a protein increase the longer the protein interacts with Cnx. Mutations in glycoproteins increase their association with Cnx, and these mutant proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. However, until now, the increased interaction with Cnx was not known to increase the folding of mutant glycoproteins. Because many human diseases result from glycoprotein misfolding, a Cnx-assisted folding of mutant glycoproteins could be beneficial. Mutations of rhodopsin, the glycoprotein pigment of rod photoreceptors, cause misfolding resulting in retinitis pigmentosa. Despite the critical role of Cnx in glycoprotein folding, surprisingly little is known about its interaction with rhodopsin or whether this interaction could be modulated to increase the folding of mutant rhodopsin. Here, we demonstrate that Cnx preferentially associates with misfolded mutant opsins associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Furthermore, the overexpression of Cnx leads to an increased accumulation of misfolded P23H opsin but not the correctly folded protein. Finally, we demonstrate that increased levels of Cnx in the presence of the pharmacological chaperone 11-cis-retinal increase the folding efficiency and result in an increase in correct folding of mutant rhodopsin. These results demonstrate that misfolded rather than correctly folded rhodopsin is a substrate for Cnx and that the interaction between Cnx and mutant, misfolded rhodopsin, can be targeted to increase the yield of folded mutant protein.",M1
19795853,"6-s-cis Conformation and polar binding pocket of the <e>retinal</e> chromophore in the photoactivated state of rhodopsin.The visual pigment rhodopsin is unique among the G protein-coupled receptors in having an 11-cis retinal chromophore covalently bound to the protein through a protonated Schiff base linkage. The chromophore locks the visual receptor in an inactive conformation through specific steric and electrostatic interactions. This efficient inverse agonist is rapidly converted to an agonist, the unprotonated Schiff base of all-trans retinal, upon light activation. Here, we use magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy to obtain the (13)C chemical shifts (C5-C20) of the all-trans retinylidene chromophore and the (15)N chemical shift of the Schiff base nitrogen in the active metarhodopsin II intermediate. The retinal chemical shifts are sensitive to the conformation of the chromophore and its molecular interactions within the protein-binding site. Comparison of the retinal chemical shifts in metarhodopsin II with those of retinal model compounds reveals that the Schiff base environment is polar. In particular, the (13)C15 and (15)Nepsilon chemical shifts indicate that the C horizontal lineN bond is highly polarized in a manner that would facilitate Schiff base hydrolysis. We show that a strong perturbation of the retinal (13)C12 chemical shift observed in rhodopsin is reduced in wild-type metarhodopsin II and in the E181Q mutant of rhodopsin. On the basis of the T(1) relaxation time of the retinal (13)C18 methyl group and the conjugated retinal (13)C5 and (13)C8 chemical shifts, we have determined that the conformation of the retinal C6-C7 single bond connecting the beta-ionone ring and the retinylidene chain is 6-s-cis in both the inactive and the active states of rhodopsin. These results are discussed within the general framework of ligand-activated G protein-coupled receptors.",M1
19795787,"[Studies on the conformational state of the chromophore group (11-cis-<e>retinal</e>) in rhodopsin by computer molecular simulation methods]Based on computer simulation methods, the molecular dynamics of the rhodopsin chromophore group (11-cis-retinal) has been analyzed. The molecular dynamics has been traced within a 3-ns time interval; thereby 3 x 10(6) discrete conformational states of opsin and rhodopsin were compared and analyzed. It was shown that, within a short time of about 0.3-0.4 ns from the start of simulation, the retinal beta-ionone ring becomes twisted around the C6-C7 bond by approximately 60 degrees compared with that of the initial configuration. The influence of retinal conformation on the positions of the maximum of the absorption band of rhodopsin at the conformational states of t=0 and t=3 ns were estimated using the ab initio methods. The results indicated that the absorption maximum for the final (3-ns) state is shifted by 10 nm toward the long wavelength region compared with the initial state. This suggests that the rhodopsin molecule with its twisted chromophore will possess a considerably lower activation energy than the rhodopsin molecule where the beta-ionone ring is in a planar orientation to the retinal polyene chain.",M1
19766701,"Kinetic characterization of recombinant mouse <e>retinal</e> dehydrogenase types 3 and 4 for retinal substrates.BACKGROUND: Retinal dehydrogenases (RALDHs) catalyze the dehydrogenation of retinal into retinoic acids (RAs), which are required for embryogenesis and tissue differentiation. This study sought to determine the detailed kinetic properties of 2 mouse RALDHs, namely RALDH3 and 4, for retinal isomer substrates, to better define their specificities in RA isomer synthesis. METHODS: RALDH3 and 4 were expressed in Escherichia coli as His-tagged proteins and affinity-purified. Enzyme kinetics were performed with retinal isomer substrates. The enzymatic products were analyzed by high pressure liquid chromatography. RESULTS: RALDH3 oxidized all-trans retinal with high catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km=77.9) but did not show activity for either 9-cis or 13-cis retinal substrates. On the other hand, RALDH4 was inactive for all-trans retinal substrate, exhibited high activity for 9-cis retinal oxidation (Vmax/Km=27.4), and oxidized 13-cis retinal with lower catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km=8.24). beta-ionone, a potent inhibitor of RALDH4 activity, suppressed 9-cis and 13-cis retinal oxidation competitively with inhibition constants of 0.60 and 0.32, respectively, but had no effect on RALDH3 activity. The divalent cation MgCl2 activated 13-cis retinal oxidation by RALDH4 by 3-fold, did not significantly influence 9-cis retinal oxidation, and slightly activated RALDH3 activity. CONCLUSIONS: These data extend the kinetic characterization of RALDH3 and 4, providing their specificities for retinal isomer substrates. GENERAL SIGNIFICANCE: The kinetic characterization of RALDHs should give useful information in determining amino acid residues that are involved in the specificity for retinal isomers and on the role of these enzymes in the synthesis of RAs in specific tissues.",M1
19766652,"<e>Retinal</e>-protein interactions in halorhodopsin from Natronomonas pharaonis: binding and retinal thermal isomerization catalysis.Halorhodopsin from Natronomonas pharaonis (NpHR) is a member of the retinal protein group and serves as a light-driven chloride pump in which chloride ions are transported through the membrane following light absorption by the retinal chromophore. In this study, we examined two main issues: (1) factors controlling the binding of the retinal chromophore to the NpHR opsin and (2) the ability of the NpHR opsin to catalyze the thermal isomerization of retinal isomers. We have revealed that the reconstitution process of pharaonis HR (NpHR) pigment from its apoprotein and all-trans retinal depends on the pH, and the process has a pK(a) of 5.8+/-0.1. It was proposed that this pK(a) is associated with the pK(a) of the lysine residue that binds the retinal chromophore (Lys256). The pigment formation is regulated by the concentration of sodium chloride, and the maximum yield was observed at 3.7 M NaCl. The low yield of pigment in a lower concentration of NaCl (&lt;3 M) may be due to an altered conformation adopted by the apomembrane, which is not capable of forming the pigment. Unexpectedly and unlike the apomembrane of bacteriorhodopsin, NpHR opsin produces pigments with 11-cis retinal and 9-cis retinal owing to the thermal isomerization of these retinal isomers to all-trans retinal. The isomerization rate depends on the pH, and it is faster at a higher pH. The pK(a) value of the isomerization process is similar to the pK(a) of the binding process of these retinals, which suggests that Lys256 is also involved in the isomerization process. The isomerization is independent of the sodium chloride concentration. However, in the absence of sodium chloride, the apoprotein adopts such a conformation, which does not prevent the isomerization of retinal, but it prevents a covalent bond formation with the lysine residue. The rate and the thermodynamic parameter analysis of the retinal isomerization by NpHR apoprotein led to the conclusion that the apomembrane catalyzes the isomerization via a triplet mechanism.",M1
19720654,"The evolution of early vertebrate photoreceptors.Meeting the challenge of sampling an ancient aquatic landscape by the early vertebrates was crucial to their survival and would establish a <e>retinal</e> bauplan to be used by all subsequent vertebrate descendents. Image-forming eyes were under tremendous selection pressure and the ability to identify suitable prey and detect potential predators was thought to be one of the major drivers of speciation in the Early Cambrian. Based on the fossil record, we know that hagfishes, lampreys, holocephalans, elasmobranchs and lungfishes occupy critical stages in vertebrate evolution, having remained relatively unchanged over hundreds of millions of years. Now using extant representatives of these 'living fossils', we are able to piece together the evolution of vertebrate photoreception. While photoreception in hagfishes appears to be based on light detection and controlling circadian rhythms, rather than image formation, the photoreceptors of lampreys fall into five distinct classes and represent a critical stage in the dichotomy of rods and cones. At least four types of retinal cones sample the visual environment in lampreys mediating photopic (and potentially colour) vision, a sampling strategy retained by lungfishes, some modern teleosts, reptiles and birds. Trichromacy is retained in cartilaginous fishes (at least in batoids and holocephalans), where it is predicted that true scotopic (dim light) vision evolved in the common ancestor of all living gnathostomes. The capacity to discriminate colour and balance the tradeoff between resolution and sensitivity in the early vertebrates was an important driver of eye evolution, where many of the ocular features evolved were retained as vertebrates progressed on to land.",M1
19720653,"Evolution of vertebrate <e>retinal</e> photoreception.Recent findings shed light on the steps underlying the evolution of vertebrate photoreceptors and retina. Vertebrate ciliary photoreceptors are not as wholly distinct from invertebrate rhabdomeric photoreceptors as is sometimes thought. Recent information on the phylogenies of ciliary and rhabdomeric opsins has helped in constructing the likely routes followed during evolution. Clues to the factors that led the early vertebrate retina to become invaginated can be obtained by combining recent knowledge about the origin of the pathway for dark re-isomerization of retinoids with knowledge of the inability of ciliary opsins to undergo photoreversal, along with consideration of the constraints imposed under the very low light levels in the deep ocean. Investigation of the origin of cell classes in the vertebrate retina provides support for the notion that cones, rods and bipolar cells all originated from a primordial ciliary photoreceptor, whereas ganglion cells, amacrine cells and horizontal cells all originated from rhabdomeric photoreceptors. Knowledge of the molecular differences between cones and rods, together with knowledge of the scotopic signalling pathway, provides an understanding of the evolution of rods and of the rods' retinal circuitry. Accordingly, it has been possible to propose a plausible scenario for the sequence of evolutionary steps that led to the emergence of vertebrate photoreceptors and retina.",M1
19716801,"<e>Retinal</e> dynamics during light activation of rhodopsin revealed by solid-state NMR spectroscopy.Rhodopsin is a canonical member of class A of the G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) that are implicated in many of the drug interventions in humans and are of great pharmaceutical interest. The molecular mechanism of rhodopsin activation remains unknown as atomistic structural information for the active metarhodopsin II state is currently lacking. Solid-state (2)H NMR constitutes a powerful approach to study atomic-level dynamics of membrane proteins. In the present application, we describe how information is obtained about interactions of the retinal cofactor with rhodopsin that change with light activation of the photoreceptor. The retinal methyl groups play an important role in rhodopsin function by directing conformational changes upon transition into the active state. Site-specific (2)H labels have been introduced into the methyl groups of retinal and solid-state (2)H NMR methods applied to obtain order parameters and correlation times that quantify the mobility of the cofactor in the inactive dark state, as well as the cryotrapped metarhodopsin I and metarhodopsin II states. Analysis of the angular-dependent (2)H NMR line shapes for selectively deuterated methyl groups of rhodopsin in aligned membranes enables determination of the average ligand conformation within the binding pocket. The relaxation data suggest that the beta-ionone ring is not expelled from its hydrophobic pocket in the transition from the pre-activated metarhodopsin I to the active metarhodopsin II state. Rather, the major structural changes of the retinal cofactor occur already at the metarhodopsin I state in the activation process. The metarhodopsin I to metarhodopsin II transition involves mainly conformational changes of the protein within the membrane lipid bilayer rather than the ligand. The dynamics of the retinylidene methyl groups upon isomerization are explained by an activation mechanism involving cooperative rearrangements of extracellular loop E2 together with transmembrane helices H5 and H6. These activating movements are triggered by steric clashes of the isomerized all-trans retinal with the beta4 strand of the E2 loop and the side chains of Glu(122) and Trp(265) within the binding pocket. The solid-state (2)H NMR data are discussed with regard to the pathway of the energy flow in the receptor activation mechanism.",M1
19687232,"Metabolic constraints on the recovery of sensitivity after visual pigment bleaching in <e>retinal</e> rods.The shutoff of active intermediates in the phototransduction cascade and the reconstitution of the visual pigment play key roles in the recovery of sensitivity after the exposure to bright light in both rod and cone photoreceptors. Physiological evidence from bleached salamander rods suggests this recovery of sensitivity occurs faster at the outer segment base compared with the tip. Microfluorometric measurements of similarly bleached salamander rods demonstrate that the reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol also occurs more rapidly at the outer segment base than at the tip. The experiments reported here were designed to test the hypothesis that these two phenomena are linked, e.g., that slowed recovery of sensitivity at the tip of outer segments is rate limited by the reduction of all-trans retinal and results from a shortage of cytosolic nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH), the reducing agent for all-trans retinal reduction. Extracellular measurements of membrane current and sensitivity were made from isolated salamander rods under dark-adapted and bleached conditions while intracellular NADPH concentration was varied by dialysis from a micropipette attached to the inner segment. Sensitivity at the base and tip of the outer segment was assessed before and after bleaching. After exposure to a light that photoactivates 50% of the visual pigment, rods were completely insensitive for nearly 10 minutes, after which the base recovered sensitivity and responsiveness with a time constant of approximately 200 seconds, but tip sensitivity recovered more slowly with a time constant of approximately 680 seconds. Dialysis of 5 mM NADPH into the rod promoted an earlier recovery and eliminated the previously observed tip/base difference. Dialysis of 1.66 mM NADPH failed to eliminate the tip/base recovery difference, suggesting the steady-state NADPH concentration in rods is approximately 1 mM. These results indicate the inner segment is the primary source of reducing equivalents after pigment bleaching, with the reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol playing a key step in the recovery of sensitivity.",M1
19678662,"Picosecond time-resolved ultraviolet resonance Raman spectroscopy of bacteriorhodopsin: primary protein response to the photoisomerization of <e>retinal</e>.Protein dynamics in the primary processes during the bacteriorhodopsin (BR) photocycle under physiological conditions were investigated by measuring picosecond time-resolved ultraviolet resonance Raman (UVRR) spectra of the BR suspended solution at ambient temperature. We used a 565 nm pump pulse to initiate the BR photocycle and two kinds of probe pulses with wavelengths of 225 and 238 nm to detect spectral changes in the tryptophan and tyrosine bands, respectively. The observed spectral changes of the Raman bands are most likely due to tryptophan and tyrosine residues located in the vicinity of the retinal chromophore, that is, Trp86, Trp182, Tyr57, and Tyr185. The 225 nm UVRR spectra exhibited bleaching of intensity for all the tryptophan bands within the instrumental response, followed by recovery with a time constant of 30 ps and no further changes up to 1 ns. This suggests that the stepwise structural changes in the tryptophan residues proceed in response to the retinal photoreaction. It is concluded that the initial intensity bleach arises from the J-intermediate formation and the 30 ps recovery is associated with the K-KL transition. The 30 ps process in the BR photocycle has been detected for the first time. In the 238 nm UVRR spectra, spectral features attributable to the K and KL intermediates were observed. The observed spectral changes showed that the temporal behaviors of the observed spectral changes in each Raman band of both tryptophan and tyrosine were different. This indicates that the spectral changes originated from structural changes of at least two tryptophan and two tyrosine residues.",M1
19666736,"Phospholipid meets all-trans-<e>retinal</e>: the making of RPE bisretinoids.The lipid phase of the photoreceptor outer segment membrane is essential to the photon capturing and signaling functions of rhodopsin. Rearrangement of phospholipids in the bilayer accompanies the formation of the active intermediates of rhodopsin following photon absorption. Furthermore, evidence for the formation of a condensation product between the photolyzed chromophore all-trans-retinal and phosphatidylethanolamine indicates that phospholipid may also participate in the movement of the retinoid in the membrane. The downside of these interactions is the formation of bisretinoid-phosphatidylethanolamine compounds that accumulate in retinal pigment epithelial cells with age and that are particularly abundant in some retinal disorders. The propensity of these compounds to negatively impact on the cells has been linked to the pathogenesis of some retinal disorders including juvenile onset recessive Stargardt disease and age-related macular degeneration.",M1
19653674,"Is the photoinduced isomerization in <e>retinal</e> protonated Schiff bases a single- or double-torsional process?Nonadiabatic photodynamical simulations are presented for the all-trans and 5-cis isomers of the hepta-3,5,7-trieniminium cation (PSB4) with the goal of characterizing the types of torsional modes occurring in the cis-trans isomerization processes in retinal protonated Schiff base (RPSB), the rhodopsin and bacteriorhodopsin chropomhore. Steric hindrance of these processes due to environmental effects have been modeled by imposing different sets of mechanical restrictions on PSB4 and studying its response in the photodynamics. Both the mechanism toward the conical intersection and the initial phase of the hot ground state dynamics has been studied in detail. A total of 600 trajectories have been computed using a complete active space self-consistent field wave function. Careful comparison with higher level methods has been made in order to verify the accuracy of the results. The most important mechanism driving restricted PSB4 isomerization in the excited state is characterized by two concerted twist motions (bipedal and closely related to it nonrigid bipedal) from which only one torsion tends to be continued during the relaxation into the ground state. The one-bond-flip is found to be important for the trans isomer as well. The main isomerization trend is a torsion around C(5)C(6) (equivalent to C(11)C(12) in RPSB) in the case of the cis isomer and around C(3)C(4) (C(13)C(14) in RPSB) in the case of the trans isomer. The simulations show an initial 70 fs relaxation into twisted regions and give an average internal conversion time of 130-140 fs, timings that are fully compatible with the general picture described by femtosecond transient absorption spectroscopic studies.",M1
19637932,"<e>Retinal</e>-salinixanthin interactions in xanthorhodopsin: [corrected] a circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy study with artificial pigments.Xanthorhodopsin (xR) is a recently discovered retinal protein that contains, in addition to the retinal chromophore, a carotenoid (salinixanthin) absorbing at 456, 486, and 520 nm, which functions as a light-harvesting antenna. We have studied the interactions between the two chromophores by monitoring the absorbance and circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopies of artificial pigments derived from synthetic retinal analogues characterized by shifted absorption maxima. In addition, we have followed the binding process of the synthetic chromophores to the apomembrane of xR. We have revealed that the CD spectrum of xR originated mainly from the carotenoid chromophore without a significant contribution of the retinal chromophore. Because the binding process rate of these analogues is slower compared to all-trans retinal, it was possible to detect and analyze the major alterations in the CD spectrum. It was revealed that the main changes occur as a result of binding site occupation by the retinal chromophore and not because of the formation of the retinal-protein covalent bond.",M1
19635855,"The 9-methyl group of <e>retinal</e> is essential for rapid Meta II decay and phototransduction quenching in red cones.Cone photoreceptors of the vertebrate retina terminate their response to light much faster than rod photoreceptors. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this rapid response termination in cones are poorly understood. The experiments presented here tested two related hypotheses: first, that the rapid decay rate of metarhodopsin (Meta) II in red-sensitive cones depends on interactions between the 9-methyl group of retinal and the opsin part of the pigment molecule, and second, that rapid Meta II decay is critical for rapid recovery from saturation of red-sensitive cones after exposure to bright light. Microspectrophotometric measurements of pigment photolysis, microfluorometric measurements of retinol production, and single-cell electrophysiological recordings of flash responses of salamander cones were performed to test these hypotheses. In all cases, cones were bleached and their visual pigment was regenerated with either 11-cis retinal or with 11-cis 9-demethyl retinal, an analogue of retinal lacking the 9-methyl group. Meta II decay was four to five times slower and subsequent retinol production was three to four times slower in red-sensitive cones lacking the 9-methyl group of retinal. This was accompanied by a significant slowing of the recovery from saturation in cones lacking the 9-methyl group after exposure to bright (&gt;0.1% visual pigment photoactivated) but not dim light. A mathematical model of the turn-off process of phototransduction revealed that the slower recovery of photoresponse can be explained by slower Meta decay of 9-demethyl visual pigment. These results demonstrate that the 9-methyl group of retinal is required for steric chromophore-opsin interactions that favor both the rapid decay of Meta II and the rapid response recovery after exposure to bright light in red-sensitive cones.",M1
19630373,"Color tuning in short wavelength-sensitive human and mouse visual pigments: ab initio quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics studies.We have investigated the protonation state and photoabsorption spectrum of Schiff-base (SB) nitrogen bound 11-cis-<e>retinal</e> in human blue and mouse UV cone visual pigments as well as in bovine rhodopsin by hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) calculations. We have employed both multireference (MRCISD+Q, MR-SORCI+Q, and MR-DDCI2+Q) and single reference (TD-B3LYP and RI-CC2) QM methods. The calculated ground-state and vertical excitation energies show that UV-sensitive pigments have deprotonated SB nitrogen, while violet-sensitive pigments have protonated SB nitrogen, in agreement with some indirect experimental evidence. A significant blue shift of the absorption maxima of violet-sensitive pigments relative to rhodopsins arises from the increase in bond length alternation of the polyene chain of 11-cis-retinal induced by polarizing fields of these pigments. The main counterion is Glu113 in both violet-sensitive vertebrate pigments and bovine rhodopsin. Neither Glu113 nor the remaining pigment has a significant influence on the first excitation energy of 11-cis-retinal in the UV-sensitive pigments that have deprotonated SB nitrogen. There is no charge transfer between the SB and beta-ionone terminals of 11-cis-retinal in the ground and first excited states.",M1

Each step of this process has been dissected and four residues (Lys132, Tyr134, Arg111, and Glu121) within the CRABPII binding site have been identified as crucial for imine formation and/or protonation. The precise role of each residue has been examined through site directed mutagenesis and crystallographic studies. The crystal structure of the R132K:L121E-CRABPII (PDB-3I17) double mutant suggests a direct interaction between engineered Glu121 and the native Arg111, which is critical for both Schiff base formation and protonation.",M1
19584000,"Ustilago maydis accumulates beta-carotene at levels determined by a <e>retinal</e>-forming carotenoid oxygenase.The basidiomycete Ustilago maydis, the causative agent of corn smut disease, has emerged as a model organism for dimorphism and fungal phytopathogenicity. In this work, we line out the key conserved enzymes for beta-carotene biosynthesis encoded by the U. maydis genome and show that this biotrophic fungus accumulates beta-carotene. The amount of this pigment depended on culture pH and aeration but was not affected by light and was not increased by oxidative stress. Moreover, we identified the U. maydis gene, cco1, encoding a putative beta-carotene cleavage oxygenase. Heterologous overexpression and in vitro analyses of purified enzyme demonstrated that Cco1 catalyzes the symmetrical cleavage of beta-carotene to yield two molecules of retinal. Analyses of beta-carotene and retinal contents in U. maydiscco1 deletion and over-expression strains confirmed the enzymatic function of Cco1, and revealed that Cco1 determines the beta-carotene content. Our data indicate that carotenoid biosynthesis in U. maydis is carried out to provide retinal rather than to deliver protective pigments. The U. maydis genome also encodes three potential opsins, a family of photoactive proteins that use retinal as chromophore. Two opsin genes showed different light-regulated expression patterns, suggesting specialized roles in photobiology, while no mRNA was detected for the third opsin gene in the same experiments. However, deletion of the cco1 gene, which should abolish function of all the retinal-dependent opsins, did not affect growth, morphology or pathogenicity, suggesting that retinal and opsin proteins play no relevant role in U. maydis under the tested conditions.",M1
19564608,"Control of <e>retinal</e> isomerization in bacteriorhodopsin in the high-intensity regime.A learning algorithm was used to manipulate optical pulse shapes and optimize retinal isomerization in bacteriorhodopsin, for excitation levels up to 1.8 x 10(16) photons per square centimeter. Below 1/3 the maximum excitation level, the yield was not sensitive to pulse shape. Above this level the learning algorithm found that a Fourier-transform-limited (TL) pulse maximized the 13-cis population. For this optimal pulse the yield increases linearly with intensity well beyond the saturation of the first excited state. To understand these results we performed systematic searches varying the chirp and energy of the pump pulses while monitoring the isomerization yield. The results are interpreted including the influence of 1-photon and multiphoton transitions. The population dynamics in each intermediate conformation and the final branching ratio between the all-trans and 13-cis isomers are modified by changes in the pulse energy and duration.",M1
19505100,"Thermal decay of rhodopsin: role of hydrogen bonds in thermal isomerization of 11-cis <e>retinal</e> in the binding site and hydrolysis of protonated Schiff base.Although thermal stability of the G protein-coupled receptor rhodopsin is directly related to its extremely low dark noise level and has recently generated considerable interest, the chemistry behind the thermal decay process of rhodopsin has remained unclear. Using UV-vis spectroscopy and HPLC analysis, we have demonstrated that the thermal decay of rhodopsin involves both hydrolysis of the protonated Schiff base and thermal isomerization of 11-cis to all-trans retinal. Examining the unfolding of rhodopsin by circular dichroism spectroscopy and measuring the rate of thermal isomerization of 11-cis retinal in solution, we conclude that the observed thermal isomerization of 11-cis to all-trans retinal happens when 11-cis retinal is in the binding pocket of rhodopsin. Furthermore, we demonstrate that solvent deuterium isotope effects are involved in the thermal decay process by decreasing the rates of thermal isomerization and hydrolysis, suggesting that the rate-determining step of these processes involves breaking hydrogen bonds. These results provide insight into understanding the critical role of an extensive hydrogen-bonding network on stabilizing the inactive state of rhodopsin and contribute to our current understanding of the low dark noise level of rhodopsin, which enables this specialized protein to function as an extremely sensitive biological light detector. Because similar hydrogen-bonding networks have also been suggested by structural analysis of two other GPCRs, beta1 and beta2 adrenergic receptors, our results could reveal a general role of hydrogen bonds in facilitating GPCR function.",M1
19407011,"Cone outer segment morphology and cone function in the Rpe65-/- Nrl-/- mouse retina are amenable to retinoid replacement.PURPOSE: RPE65, a major <e>retinal</e> pigment epithelium protein, is essential in generating 11-cis retinal, the chromophore for all opsins. Without chromophore, cone opsins are mislocalized and cones degenerate rapidly (e.g., Rpe65(-/-) mouse). Function, survival, and correct targeting of opsins is increased in Rpe65(-/-) cones on supplying 11-cis retinal. Here, we determine the consequences of 11-cis retinal withdrawal and supplementation on cone development in the all-cone Nrl(-/-) retina. METHODS: Rpe65(-/-) Nrl(-/-), Nrl(-/-), and wild-type mice were examined. Cone structure was analyzed by using TUNEL assay, electron microscopy, and cone-specific antibodies. Cone function was assessed with light-adapted single-flash ERGs. RESULTS: Rpe65(-/-)Nrl(-/-) mice had an increased number of TUNEL-positive photoreceptors during programmed cell death compared with Nrl(-/-) mice, in addition to accelerated age-related degeneration. Cone function in Rpe65(-/-)Nrl(-/-) mice was minimal, and opsins were mislocalized. Treatment with 11-cis retinal restored cone function, promoted outer segment formation, and enabled opsin trafficking to outer segments. Eliminating Rpe65 prevented rosette formation in Nrl(-/-) retinas; supplementation of Rpe65(-/-)Nrl(-/-) mice with 11-cis retinal resulted in their reoccurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, function and opsin trafficking in Nrl(-/-) and wild-type cones are comparable, confirming and extending our findings that cone maturation and outer segment development are dependent on the presence of chromophore. The data on age-related cone death in Rpe65(-/-)Nrl(-/-) mice and the reintroduction of rosettes after 11-cis retinal injections confirm that outer segments, which for steric reasons appear to introduce rosettes in an all-cone retina, are essential for cell survival. These results are important for understanding and treating chromophore-related cone dystrophies.",M1
19405533,"Long-distance proton transfer with a break in the bacteriorhodopsin active site.Bacteriorhodopsin is a proton-pumping membrane protein found in the plasma membrane of the archaeon Halobacterium salinarium. Light-induced isomerization of the <e>retinal</e> chromophore from all-trans to 13-cis leads to a sequence of five conformation-coupled proton transfer steps and the net transport of one proton from the cytoplasmic to the extracellular side of the membrane. The mechanism of the long-distance proton transfer from the primary acceptor Asp85 to the extracellular proton release group during the O --&gt; bR is poorly understood. Experiments suggest that this long-distance transfer could involve a transient state [O] in which the proton resides on the intermediate carrier Asp212. To assess whether the transient protonation of Asp212 participates in the deprotonation of Asp85, we performed hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics proton transfer calculations using different protein structures and with different retinal geometries and active site water molecules. The structural models were assessed by computing UV-vis excitation energies and C=O vibrational frequencies. The results indicate that a transient [O] conformer with protonated Asp212 could indeed be sampled during the long-distance proton transfer to the proton release group. Our calculations suggest that, in the starting proton transfer state O, the retinal is strongly twisted and at least three water molecules are present in the active site.",M1
19390642,"Release of 11-cis-<e>retinal</e> from cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein by acidic lipids.PURPOSE: To determine molecular mechanisms for the release of 11-cis-retinal from the binding pocket of cellular retinaldehyde-binding protein (CRALBP). METHODS: Binding of CRALBP to lipid surfaces was assessed with a lipid-immunoblot assay. Lipids were presented to CRALBP as small unilamellar vesicles (SUVs) consisting of phosphatidylcholine (PC) plus other lipids. Release of 9-cis-retinal or 11-cis-retinal from CRALBP was measured with spectral and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) assays based on the protection of the protein-bound retinal carbonyl group from reaction with NH(2)OH. The electrostatic surface potential of CRALBP was calculated from a model of its structure using the program CCP4mg. RESULTS: Incubation of CRALBP.11-cis-retinal with lipids absorbed on nitrocellulose revealed binding to the acidic lipids, phosphatidic acid (PA)&gt;phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate [PI(3,4,5)P(3)]&gt;phosphatidylserine (PS)&gt; PI(4,5)P(2) and little or no binding to PC, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), or PI(4)P. 11-cis-retinal was released during incubation of CRALBP with SUVs consisting of PC plus 50 mol% PA but not during incubation with those composed of 100 mol% PC. The efficacy of release of 9-cis-retinal or 11-cis-retinal from CRALBP by phospholipid-containing SUVs generally paralleled that of the binding of CRALBP to the lipids (PA&gt;PS&gt;PI&gt;&gt;PC). Examination of the electrostatic surface potential of the protein structure revealed a basic recess on one face of the protein, which may bind acidic lipids. CONCLUSIONS: Our results identify the first physiologic substances that release 11-cis-retinal from CRALBP. PA and PS are relatively minor membrane lipids that can be generated in the cytoplasmic leaflet of the plasma membrane in response to various signal transduction pathways, where they could interact with cytosolic CRALBP. The mechanism for release of retinal from CRALBP by acidic lipids remains to be determined but could involve binding of the acidic lipid in the 11-cis-retinal binding site or to the positive basic recess on the protein surface. These results open a new facet in our understanding of how CRALBP functions in the regeneration of visual pigments.",M1

The expressed enzyme cleaved beta-carotene at its central double bond (15,15') to yield two molecules of all-trans-<e>retinal</e>. The molecular mass of the native purified enzyme was approximately 64 kDa as a dimer of 32-kDa subunits. The K(m), k(cat), and k(cat)/K(m) values for beta-carotene as substrate were 37 mum, 3.6 min(-1), and 97 mm(-1) min(-1), respectively. The enzyme exhibited the highest activity for beta-carotene, followed by beta-cryptoxanthin, beta-apo-4'-carotenal, alpha-carotene, and gamma-carotene in decreasing order, but not for beta-apo-8'-carotenal, beta-apo-12'-carotenal, lutein, zeaxanthin, or lycopene, suggesting that the presence of one unsubstituted beta-ionone ring in a substrate with a molecular weight greater than C(35) seems to be essential for enzyme activity. The oxygen atom of retinal originated not from water but from molecular oxygen, suggesting that the enzyme was a beta-carotene 15,15'-dioxygenase. Although the Blh protein and beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenases catalyzed the same biochemical reaction, the Blh protein was unrelated to the mammalian beta-carotene 15,15'-monooxygenases as assessed by their different properties, including DNA and amino acid sequences, molecular weight, form of association, reaction mechanism, kinetic properties, and substrate specificity.

Both enzymes participate in the retinoid (visual) cycle, the enzymatic pathway that continuously generates 11-cis-<e>retinal</e>, the chromophore of visual pigments in rod and cone photoreceptor cells needed for vision. We investigated human RPE65-LCA patients and mice with visual cycle abnormalities to determine the impact of chronic chromophore deprivation on cones. Young patients with RPE65 mutations showed foveal cone loss along with shortened inner and outer segments of remaining cones; cone cell loss also was dramatic in young mice lacking Rpe65 or Lrat gene function. To selectively evaluate cone pathophysiology, we eliminated the rod contribution to electroretinographic (ERG) responses by generating double knockout mice lacking Lrat or Rpe65 together with an inactivated rod-specific G protein transducin gene (Gnat1-/-). Cone ERG responses were absent in Gnat1-/-Lrat-/- mice which also showed progressive degeneration of cones. Cone ERG responses in Gnat1-/-Rpe65-/- mice were markedly reduced and declined over weeks. Treatment of these mice with the artificial chromophore pro-drug, 9-cis-retinyl acetate, partially protected inferior retinal cones as evidenced by improved ERGs and retinal histochemistry. Gnat1-/- mice chronically treated with retinylamine, a selective inhibitor of RPE65, also showed a decline in the number of cones that was ameliorated by 9-cis-retinyl acetate. These results suggest that chronic lack of chromophore leads to progressive loss of cones in mice and humans. Therapy for LCA patients should be geared toward early adequate delivery of chromophore to cone photoreceptors.",M1

The goal of this study was to determine whether regulatory elements of the retinaldehyde binding protein 1 (Rlbp1; formerly Cralbp) gene can drive robust Müller glial gene expression in vivo. METHODS: Transgenic mice were generated by pronuclear injection of a construct carrying a 3-kilobase (kb) region of the Rlbp1 gene and 5'-flanking sequences linked to the enhanced green fluorescent protein (GFP) cDNA. GFP expression was analyzed by immunohistology in regions of the central nervous system in which RLBP1 protein is expressed, in retinas from wild-type and retinal degeneration 1 (rd1) mice, and during retinal development. RESULTS: Three transgenic lines were generated, and the one with the strongest and most consistent GFP expression was characterized further. Müller glia displayed robust GFP expression at all postnatal developmental stages and in the rd1 retina. Onset of expression occurred by birth in retinal progenitor cells. CONCLUSIONS: Regulatory elements in a restricted region of the Rlbp1 gene are sufficient to drive GFP expression in vivo. This transgenic line provides robust GFP expression that can be used to visualize retinal progenitor cells during postnatal development and Müller glia during their differentiation and in the healthy or degenerating adult retina.",M1
19298071,"Nonadiabatic ab initio dynamics of two models of Schiff base <e>retinal</e>.On-the-fly classical dynamics calculations combined with ab initio quantum chemical computations are carried out for two models of protonated Schiff base retinal in vacuo. The models are the 6pi system of 2-cis-penta-2,4-dieneimminium cation and the 12pi system in which two methyl groups are removed from the Schiff base of retinal. The CASSCF(6,6) level with the 6-31G basis set was employed for the quantum chemical part and the velocity Verlet algorism is utilized for time evolution of trajectories. The probabilities of nonadiabatic transition between the excited and ground state are estimated by the Zhu-Nakamura formulas. The 9-cis form product in addition to the all-trans one is generated in the present gas phase calculation for the 12pi model, despite the 9-cis generation being suppressed in protein. We have found that energy relaxation on the ground state occurs in two steps in the 12pi model. In the first step a metastable intermediate state is formed at approximately 100 fs after photoexcitation at the energy around 20-40 kcal/mol down from the excited potential energy surface, then it further relaxes to the energy around 60-80 kcal/mol from the excited surface, leading to the final state (second step). This relaxation pattern can be seen in all the three pathways to the all-trans, 9-cis, and (reverted) 11-cis form. Fourier transformation analysis reveals that the effective vibrational frequencies of the intermediate state are 1600-2000 cm(-1), which can be attributed to the conjugate CC bond frequencies in the electronic ground state. The two-step relaxation may be due to dynamical barriers. The two-step relaxation is not revealed in the smaller 6pi model. The crank-shaft motion of the C11C12 and C9C10 bonds is found in the isomerization, which indicates the motion is intrinsic in retinal, not due to the surrounding protein. The branching ratio is about 1:1:2 for the all-trans, 9-cis, and 11-cis form generation. The ratio is different from earlier works where Tully's fewest switching scheme was employed. The bond length and the dihedral angle at the transitions are also analyzed to investigate the transition mechanism.",M1
19267873,"Structural coupling of 11-cis-7-methyl-<e>retinal</e> and amino acids at the ligand binding pocket of rhodopsin.It was previously shown that opsin can be regenerated with the newly synthesized 11-cis-7-methyl-retinal forming an artificial visual pigment. We now extend this study to include mutants at positions close to the retinal to further dissect the interactions of native and artificial chromophores with opsin. Several mutants at M207, W265 and Y268 have been obtained and regenerated with 11-cis-retinal and the 7-methyl analog. M207 is the site of the point mutation M207R associated with the retinal degenerative disease retinitis pigmentosa. All the studied mutants regenerated with 11-cis-retinal except for M207C which proved to be completely misfolded. The naturally occurring M207R mutant formed a pigment with an unprotonated Schiff base linkage, altered photobleaching and low MetarhodopsinII stability. Mutants regenerated with the 7-methyl analog showed altered photobleaching reflecting a structural perturbation in the vicinity of M207. The newly obtained mutants at M207 also showed reduced levels of transducin activation with M207R showing essentially no transducin activation. Our results highlight the tight coupling of the vicinity of C7 of retinal and M207 and support the involvement of this amino acid residue in the conformational changes associated with rhodopsin photoactivation.",M1
19267870,"<e>Retinal</e> conformation and dynamics in activation of rhodopsin illuminated by solid-state H NMR spectroscopy.Solid-state NMR spectroscopy gives a powerful avenue for investigating G protein-coupled receptors and other integral membrane proteins in a native-like environment. This article reviews the use of solid-state (2)H NMR to study the retinal cofactor of rhodopsin in the dark state as well as the meta I and meta II photointermediates. Site-specific (2)H NMR labels have been introduced into three regions (methyl groups) of retinal that are crucially important for the photochemical function of rhodopsin. Despite its phenomenal stability (2)H NMR spectroscopy indicates retinal undergoes rapid fluctuations within the protein binding cavity. The spectral lineshapes reveal the methyl groups spin rapidly about their three-fold (C(3)) axes with an order parameter for the off-axial motion of SC(3) approximately 0.9. For the dark state, the (2)H NMR structure of 11-cis-retinal manifests torsional twisting of both the polyene chain and the beta-ionone ring due to steric interactions of the ligand and the protein. Retinal is accommodated within the rhodopsin binding pocket with a negative pretwist about the C11=C12 double bond. Conformational distortion explains its rapid photochemistry and reveals the trajectory of the 11-cis to trans isomerization. In addition, (2)H NMR has been applied to study the retinylidene dynamics in the dark and light-activated states. Upon isomerization there are drastic changes in the mobility of all three methyl groups. The relaxation data support an activation mechanism whereby the beta-ionone ring of retinal stays in nearly the same environment, without a large displacement of the ligand. Interactions of the beta-ionone ring and the retinylidene Schiff base with the protein transmit the force of the retinal isomerization. Solid-state (2)H NMR thus provides information about the flow of energy that triggers changes in hydrogen-bonding networks and helix movements in the activation mechanism of the photoreceptor.",M1

19240024,"Melanoregulin (MREG) modulates lysosome function in pigment epithelial cells.Melanoregulin (MREG), the product of the Mreg(dsu) gene, is a small highly charged protein, hypothesized to play a role in organelle biogenesis due to its effect on pigmentation in dilute, ashen, and leaden mutant mice. Here we provide evidence that MREG is required in lysosome-dependent phagosome degradation. In the Mreg(-/-) mouse, we show that loss of MREG function results in phagosome accumulation due to delayed degradation of engulfed material. Over time, the Mreg(-/-) mouse <e>retinal</e> pigment epithelial cells accumulate the lipofuscin component, A2E. MREG-deficient human and mouse retinal pigment epithelial cells exhibit diminished activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, cathepsin D, due to defective processing. Moreover, MREG localizes to small intracellular vesicles and associates with the endosomal phosphoinositide, phosphatidylinositol 3,5-biphosphate. Collectively, these studies suggest that MREG is required for lysosome maturation and support a role for MREG in intracellular trafficking.",M1
19226378,"Retinoid metabolism in the small intestine during development of liver cirrhosis.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Retinoids are important mediators of cellular differentiation and proliferation in various epithelia of the body including the small intestine. Though alterations in intestinal epithelial cell proliferation have been noted in liver cirrhosis, mechanisms involved in the process are not well understood. This study examined the levels of various retinoids and retinoid-metabolizing enzymes in the small intestine during development of liver cirrhosis. METHODS: Four groups of animals were used (control, phenobarbitone control, thioacetamide and carbon tetrachloride treatment). Twice-weekly intragastric or i.p. administration of carbon tetrachloride or thioacetamide, respectively, produced liver cirrhosis after 3 months, which was confirmed through histology and serum markers. Retinoid levels were measured by high-performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: A decrease in the levels of <e>retinal</e>, retinoic acid and retinol was evident in the intestine by 3 months, when cirrhosis was evident histologically, and these remained low until 6 months. A decrease in the activities of retinaldehyde oxidase, retinaldehyde reductase and retinol dehydrogenase was also seen in intestine from cirrhotic rats. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that altered retinoid metabolism in the intestine of cirrhotic rats might have an influence on changes in intestinal epithelial cell differentiation, seen in liver cirrhosis.",M1
19194506,"A ligand channel through the G protein coupled receptor opsin.The G protein coupled receptor rhodopsin contains a pocket within its seven-transmembrane helix (TM) structure, which bears the inactivating 11-cis-<e>retinal</e> bound by a protonated Schiff-base to Lys296 in TM7. Light-induced 11-cis-/all-trans-isomerization leads to the Schiff-base deprotonated active Meta II intermediate. With Meta II decay, the Schiff-base bond is hydrolyzed, all-trans-retinal is released from the pocket, and the apoprotein opsin reloaded with new 11-cis-retinal. The crystal structure of opsin in its active Ops* conformation provides the basis for computational modeling of retinal release and uptake. The ligand-free 7TM bundle of opsin opens into the hydrophobic membrane layer through openings A (between TM1 and 7), and B (between TM5 and 6), respectively. Using skeleton search and molecular docking, we find a continuous channel through the protein that connects these two openings and comprises in its central part the retinal binding pocket. The channel traverses the receptor over a distance of ca. 70 A and is between 11.6 and 3.2 A wide. Both openings are lined with aromatic residues, while the central part is highly polar. Four constrictions within the channel are so narrow that they must stretch to allow passage of the retinal beta-ionone-ring. Constrictions are at openings A and B, respectively, and at Trp265 and Lys296 within the retinal pocket. The lysine enforces a 90 degrees elbow-like kink in the channel which limits retinal passage. With a favorable Lys side chain conformation, 11-cis-retinal can take the turn, whereas passage of the all-trans isomer would require more global conformational changes. We discuss possible scenarios for the uptake of 11-cis- and release of all-trans-retinal. If the uptake gate of 11-cis-retinal is assigned to opening B, all-trans is likely to leave through the same gate. The unidirectional passage proposed previously requires uptake of 11-cis-retinal through A and release of photolyzed all-trans-retinal through B.",M1
19182802,"Helix movement is coupled to displacement of the second extracellular loop in rhodopsin activation.The second extracellular loop (EL2) of rhodopsin forms a cap over the binding site of its photoreactive 11-cis retinylidene chromophore. A crucial question has been whether EL2 forms a reversible gate that opens upon activation or acts as a rigid barrier. Distance measurements using solid-state (13)C NMR spectroscopy between the <e>retinal</e> chromophore and the beta4 strand of EL2 show that the loop is displaced from the retinal binding site upon activation, and there is a rearrangement in the hydrogen-bonding networks connecting EL2 with the extracellular ends of transmembrane helices H4, H5 and H6. NMR measurements further reveal that structural changes in EL2 are coupled to the motion of helix H5 and breaking of the ionic lock that regulates activation. These results provide a comprehensive view of how retinal isomerization triggers helix motion and activation in this prototypical G protein-coupled receptor.",M1
19178351,"Complex thermal behavior of 11-cis-<e>retinal</e>, the ligand of the visual pigments.Upon heating to 80 degrees C, 11-cis-retinal yields a mixture of all-trans-retinal and 13-cis-retinal. This isomerization has been studied by means of density functional theory methods, and the computational results suggest a close competition between two mechanisms of very different nature. A classical internal rotation around the C11-C12 cis double bond, via a diradical transition state, accounts for the formation of the all-trans isomer. An intricate sequence of pericyclic reactions, namely a reversible [1,7]-H sigmatropic shift and a reversible 6-pi-oxa-electrocyclic reaction, is responsible for the formation of 13-cis-retinal. Experiments using 11-cis-retinal labeled with deuterium at C19 confirmed the mechanistic proposal and also revealed an unprecedented outcome on the product composition of isotopologues.",M1
19173678,"Retinoids synergize with insulin to induce hepatic Gck expression.Hepatic GK (glucokinase) plays a key role in maintaining glucose homoeostasis. Many stimuli regulate GK activity by controlling its gene transcription. We hypothesized that endogenous lipophilic molecules modulate hepatic Gck expression. Lipophilic molecules were extracted from rat livers, saponified and re-constituted as an LE (lipophilic extract). LE synergized with insulin to induce primary hepatocyte, but not beta-cell, Gck expression in an SREBP-1c (sterol-regulatory-element-binding protein-1c)-independent manner. The dramatic induction of Gck mRNA resulted in a significant increase in GK activity. Subsequently, the active molecules were identified as retinol and <e>retinal</e> by MS after the purification of the active LE fractions. Retinoids synergized with insulin to induce Gck expression by the activation of both RAR [RA (retinoic acid) receptor] and RXR (retinoid X receptor). Inhibition of RAR activation completely abolished the effect of retinal. The hepatic GK specific activity and Gck mRNA levels of Zucker lean rats fed with a VAD [VA (vitamin A)-deficient] diet were significantly lower than those of rats fed with VAS (VA-sufficient) diet. Additionally, the hepatic Gck mRNA expression of Sprague-Dawley rats fed with a VAD diet was lower than that of rats fed with VA-marginal, -adequate or -supplemented diets. The reduced expression of Gck mRNA was increased after an intraperitoneal dose of RA in VAD rats. Furthermore, an intravenous injection of RA rapidly raised hepatic Gck expression in rats fed with a VAS control diet. Understanding the underlying mechanism that mediates the synergy may be helpful for developing a treatment strategy for patients with diabetes.",M1
19167292,"Photochemical reaction dynamics of the primary event of vision studied by means of a hybrid molecular simulation.The photoisomerization reaction dynamics of a <e>retinal</e> chromophore in the visual receptor rhodopsin was investigated by means of hybrid quantum mechanical/molecular mechanical (QM/MM) molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The photoisomerization reaction of retinal constitutes the primary step of vision and is known as one of the fastest reactions in nature. To elucidate the molecular mechanism of the high efficiency of the reaction, we carried out hybrid ab initio QM/MM MD simulations of the complete reaction process from the vertically excited state to the photoproduct via electronic transition in the entire chromophore-protein complex. An ensemble of reaction trajectories reveal that the excited-state dynamics is dynamically homogeneous and synchronous even in the presence of thermal fluctuation of the protein, giving rise to the very fast formation of the photoproduct. The synchronous nature of the reaction dynamics in rhodopsin is found to originate from weak perturbation of the protein surroundings and from dynamic regulation of volume-conserving motions of the chromophore. The simulations also provide a detailed view of time-dependent modulations of hydrogen-out-of-plane vibrations during the reaction process, and identify molecular motions underlying the experimentally observed dynamic spectral modulations.",M1
19147682,"In conditions of limited chromophore supply rods entrap 11-cis-<e>retinal</e> leading to loss of cone function and cell death.RPE65 is a retinoid isomerase required for the production of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of both cone and rod visual pigments. We recently established an R91W knock-in mouse strain as homologous animal model for patients afflicted by this mutation in RPE65. These mice have impaired vision and can only synthesize minute amounts of 11-cis-retinal. Here, we investigated the consequences of this chromophore insufficiency on cone function and pathophysiology. We found that the R91W mutation caused cone opsin mislocalization and progressive geographic cone atrophy. Remnant visual function was mostly mediated by rods. Ablation of rod opsin corrected the localization of cone opsin and improved cone retinal function. Thus, our analyses indicate that under conditions of limited chromophore supply rods and cones compete for 11-cis-retinal that derives from regeneration pathway(s) which are reliant on RPE65. Due to their higher number and the instability of cone opsin, rods are privileged under this condition while cones suffer chromophore deficiency and degenerate. These findings reinforce the notion that in patients any effective gene therapy with RPE65 needs to target the cone-rich macula directly to locally restore the cones' chromophore supply outside the reach of rods.",M1
19138111,"Isomerization reactions on single adsorbed molecules.Molecular switches occur throughout nature. In one prominent example, light induces the isomerization of <e>retinal</e> from the compact 11-cis form to the elongated all-trans form, a conversion that triggers the transformation of light into a neural impulse in the eye. Applying these natural principles to synthetic systems offers a promising way to construct smaller and faster nanoelectronic devices. In such systems, electronic switches are essential components for storage and logical operations. The development of molecular switches on the single-molecule level would represent a major step toward incorporating molecules as building units into nanoelectronic circuits. Molecular switches must be both reversible and bistable. To meet these requirements, a molecule must have at least two different thermally stable forms and a way to repeatedly interconvert between those forms based on changes in light, heat, pressure, magnetic or electric fields, pH, mechanical forces, or electric currents. The conversion should be connected to a measurable change in electronic, optical, magnetic, or mechanical properties. Because isomers can differ significantly in physical and chemical properties, isomerization could serve as a molecular switching mechanism. Integration of molecular switches into larger circuits will probably require arranging them on surfaces, which will require a better understanding of isomerization reactions in these environments. In this Account, we describe our scanning tunneling microscopy studies of the isomerization of individual molecules adsorbed on metal surfaces. Investigating chlorobenzene and azobenzene derivatives on the fcc(111) faces of Ag, Cu, and Au, we explored the influence of substituents and the substrate on the excitation mechanism of the isomerization reaction induced by inelastically tunneling electrons. We achieved an irreversible configurational (cis-trans) isomerization of individual 4-dimethyl-amino-azobenzene-4-sulfonic acid molecules on Au(111), a reversible configurational (cis-trans) isomerization of amino-nitro-azobenzene on Au(111), a constitutional (meta-ortho) isomerization of chloronitrobenzene molecules adsorbed on Cu(111) and Au(111), and a constitutional (meta-para) isomerization of dichlorobenzene molecules adsorbed on Cu(111) and Ag(111). These studies demonstrate that we can induce a variety of isomerization reactions by electron excitation on a metal surface. Our model isomerization studies provide a way to manipulate properties of single molecules, changing both their geometric structure and their physicochemical properties. The control of isomerization of single molecules will advance the development of single-molecule electronics and other nanoscale processes.",M1

On the basis of the results of QM/MM simulations, we propose that the primary function of the methyl group is not to properly align the chromophore in the ground state, but that it is a prerequisite for the peculiarly twisted and strained chromophore observed in the batho state. With the methyl group firmly anchored in the protein binding pocket the protein, at the cost of the incipient photon energy, manages to increase the strain energy stored in the chromophore by 25%, which may be crucial for driving the subsequent transformations.",M1
19056333,"Molecular determinants for the stereospecific reduction of 3-ketosteroids and reactivity towards all-trans-<e>retinal</e> of a short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase (DHRS4).DHRS4, a member of the short-chain dehydrogenase/reductase superfamily, reduces all-trans-retinal and xenobiotic carbonyl compounds. Human DHRS4 differs from other animal enzymes in kinetic constants for the substrates, particularly in its low reactivity to retinoids. We have found that pig, rabbit and dog DHRS4s reduce benzil and 3-ketosteroids into S-benzoin and 3alpha-hydroxysteroids, respectively, in contrast to the stereoselectivity of human DHRS4 which produces R-benzoin and 3beta-hydroxysteroids. Among substrate-binding residues predicted from the crystal structure of pig DHRS4, F158 and L161 in the animal DHRS4 are serine and phenylalanine, respectively, in the human enzyme. Double mutation (F158S/L161F) of pig DHRS4 led to an effective switch of its substrate affinity and stereochemistry into those similar to human DHRS4. The roles of the two residues in determining the stereospecificity in 3-ketosteroid reduction were confirmed by reverse mutation (S158F/F161L) in the human enzyme. The stereochemical control was evaluated by comparison of the 3D models of pig wild-type and mutant DHRS4s with the modeled substrates. Additional mutation of T177N into the human S158F/F161L mutant resulted in almost complete kinetic conversion into a pig DHRS4-type form, suggesting a role of N177 in forming the substrate-binding cavity through an intersubunit interaction in pig and other animal DHRS4s, and explaining why the human enzyme shows low reactivity towards retinoids.",M1
19020100,"NinaB combines carotenoid oxygenase and retinoid isomerase activity in a single polypeptide.In animals, successful production of the visual chromophore (11-cis-<e>retinal</e> or derivatives thereof such as 11-cis-3-hydroxy-retinal) is essential for photoreceptor cell function and survival. These carotenoid-derived compounds must combine with a protein moiety (the opsin) to establish functional visual pigments. Evidence from cell culture systems has implicated that the retinal pigment epithelium protein of 65 kDa (RPE65) is the long-sought all-trans to 11-cis retinoid isomerase. RPE65 is structurally related to nonheme iron oxygenases that catalyze the conversion of carotenoids into retinoids. In vertebrate genomes, two carotenoid oxygenases and RPE65 are encoded, whereas in insect genomes only a single representative of this protein family, named NinaB (denoting neither inactivation nor afterpotential mutant B), is encoded. We here cloned and functionally characterized the ninaB gene from the great wax moth Galleria mellonella. We show that the recombinant purified enzyme combines isomerase and oxygenase (isomerooxygenase) activity in a single polypeptide. From kinetics and isomeric composition of cleavage products of asymmetrical carotenoid substrates, we propose a model for the spatial arrangement between substrate and enzyme. In Drosophila, we show that carotenoid-isomerooxygenase activity of NinaB is more generally found in insects, and we provide physiological evidence that carotenoids such as 11-cis-retinal can promote visual pigment biogenesis in the dark. Our study demonstrates that trans/cis isomerase activity can be intrinsic to this class of proteins and establishes these enzymes as key components for both invertebrate and vertebrate vision.",M1
18987202,"Night blindness and the mechanism of constitutive signaling of mutant G90D rhodopsin.The G90D rhodopsin mutation is known to produce congenital night blindness in humans. This mutation produces a similar condition in mice, because rods of animals heterozygous (D+) or homozygous (D+/+) for this mutation have decreased dark current and sensitivity, reduced Ca(2+), and accelerated values of tau(REC) and tau(D), similar to light-adapted wild-type (WT) rods. Our experiments indicate that G90D pigment activates the cascade, producing an equivalent background light of approximately 130 Rh* rod(-1) for D+ and 890 Rh* rod(-1) for D+/+. The active species of the G90D pigment could be unregenerated G90D opsin or G90D rhodopsin, either spontaneously activated (as Rh*) or in some other form. Addition of 11-cis-<e>retinal</e> in lipid vesicles, which produces regeneration of both WT and G90D opsin in intact rods and ROS membranes, had no effect on the waveform or sensitivity of dark-adapted G90D responses, indicating that the active species is not G90D opsin. The noise spectra of dark-adapted G90D and WT rods are similar, and the G90D noise variance is much less than of a WT rod exposed to background light of about the same intensity as the G90D equivalent light, indicating that Rh* is not the active species. We hypothesize that G90D rhodopsin undergoes spontaneous changes in molecular conformation which activate the transduction cascade with low gain. Our experiments provide the first indication that a mutant form of the rhodopsin molecule bound to its 11-cis-chromophore can stimulate the visual cascade spontaneously at a rate large enough to produce visual dysfunction.",M1

The enzyme converted beta-carotene under maximal conditions (pH 8.0 and 37 degrees C) with a k (cat) of 1.65 min(-1) and a K (m) of 26 muM and its conversion yield of beta-carotene to retinal was 120% (mol mol(-1)).

18922772,"Crystallographic structure of xanthorhodopsin, the light-driven proton pump with a dual chromophore.Homologous to bacteriorhodopsin and even more to proteorhodopsin, xanthorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump that, in addition to <e>retinal</e>, contains a noncovalently bound carotenoid with a function of a light-harvesting antenna. We determined the structure of this eubacterial membrane protein-carotenoid complex by X-ray diffraction, to 1.9-A resolution. Although it contains 7 transmembrane helices like bacteriorhodopsin and archaerhodopsin, the structure of xanthorhodopsin is considerably different from the 2 archaeal proteins. The crystallographic model for this rhodopsin introduces structural motifs for proton transfer during the reaction cycle, particularly for proton release, that are dramatically different from those in other retinal-based transmembrane pumps. Further, it contains a histidine-aspartate complex for regulating the pK(a) of the primary proton acceptor not present in archaeal pumps but apparently conserved in eubacterial pumps. In addition to aiding elucidation of a more general proton transfer mechanism for light-driven energy transducers, the structure defines also the geometry of the carotenoid and the retinal. The close approach of the 2 polyenes at their ring ends explains why the efficiency of the excited-state energy transfer is as high as approximately 45%, and the 46 degrees angle between them suggests that the chromophore location is a compromise between optimal capture of light of all polarization angles and excited-state energy transfer.",M1
18836074,"Highly efficient <e>retinal</e> metabolism in cones.After bleaching of visual pigment in vertebrate photoreceptors, all-trans retinal is reduced to all-trans retinol by retinol dehydrogenases (RDHs). We investigated this reaction in purified carp rods and cones, and we found that the reducing activity toward all-trans retinal in the outer segment (OS) of cones is &gt;30 times higher than that of rods. The high activity of RDHs was attributed to high content of RDH8 in cones. In the inner segment (IS) in both rods and cones, RDH8L2 and RDH13 were found to be the major enzymes among RDH family proteins. We further found a previously undescribed and effective pathway to convert 11-cis retinol to 11-cis retinal in cones: this oxidative conversion did not require NADP(+) and instead was coupled with reduction of all-trans retinal to all-trans retinol. The activity was &gt;50 times effective than the oxidizing activity of RDHs that require NADP(+). These highly effective reactions of removal of all-trans retinal by RDH8 and production of 11-cis retinal by the coupling reaction are probably the underlying mechanisms that ensure effective visual pigment regeneration in cones that function under much brighter light conditions than rods.",M1
18788756,"Oxidation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols by human aldo-keto reductase AKR1B10.AKR1B10 has been identified as a potential biomarker for human nonsmall cell lung carcinoma and as a tobacco exposure and response gene. AKR1B10 functions as an efficient <e>retinal</e> reductase in vitro and may regulate retinoic acid homeostasis. However, the possibility that this enzyme is able to activate polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) trans-dihydrodiols to form reactive and redox-active o-quinones has not been investigated to date. AKR1B10 was found to oxidize a wide range of PAH trans-dihydrodiol substrates in vitro to yield PAH o-quinones. Reactions of AKR1B10 proceeded with improper stereochemistry, since it was specific for the minor (+)-benzo[a]pyrene-7S,8S-dihydrodiol diastereomer formed in vivo. However, AKR1B10 displayed reasonable activity in the oxidation of both the (-)-R,R and (+)-S,S stereoisomers of benzo[g]chrysene-11,12-dihydrodiol and oxidized the potentially relevant, albeit minor, (+)-benz[a]anthracene-3S,4S-dihydrodiol metabolite. We find that AKR1B10 is therefore likely to play a contributing role in the activation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols in human lung. AKR1B10 retinal reductase activity was confirmed in vitro and found to be 5- to 150-fold greater than the oxidation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols examined. AKR1B10 was highly expressed at the mRNA and protein levels in human lung adenocarcinoma A549 cells, and robust retinal reductase activity was measured in lysates of these cells. The much greater catalytic efficiency of retinal reduction compared to PAH trans-dihydrodiol metabolism suggests AKR1B10 may play a greater role in lung carcinogenesis through dysregulation of retinoic acid homeostasis than through oxidation of PAH trans-dihydrodiols.",M1
18658157,"Retinopathy in mice induced by disrupted all-trans-<e>retinal</e> clearance.The visual (retinoid) cycle is a fundamental metabolic process in vertebrate retina responsible for production of 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of rhodopsin and cone pigments. 11-cis-Retinal is bound to opsins, forming visual pigments, and when the resulting visual chromophore 11-cis-retinylidene is photoisomerized to all-trans-retinylidene, all-trans-retinal is released from these receptors. Toxic byproducts of the visual cycle formed from all-trans-retinal often are associated with lipofuscin deposits in the retinal pigmented epithelium (RPE), but it is not clear whether aberrant reactions of the visual cycle participate in RPE atrophy, leading to a rapid onset of retinopathy. Here we report that mice lacking both the ATP-binding cassette transporter 4 (Abca4) and enzyme retinol dehydrogenase 8 (Rdh8), proteins critical for all-trans-retinal clearance from photoreceptors, developed severe RPE/photoreceptor dystrophy at an early age. This phenotype includes lipofuscin, drusen, and basal laminar deposits, Bruch's membrane thickening, and choroidal neovascularization. Importantly, the severity of visual dysfunction and retinopathy was exacerbated by light but attenuated by treatment with retinylamine, a visual cycle inhibitor that slows the flow of all-trans-retinal through the visual cycle. These findings provide direct evidence that aberrant production of toxic condensation byproducts of the visual cycle in mice can lead to rapid, progressive retinal degeneration.",M1
18654326,"Imaging the dynamic behaviour of individual <e>retinal</e> chromophores confined inside carbon nanotubes.Retinal is the molecule found in photoreceptor cells that undergoes a change in shape when it absorbs light. Specifically, the cis/trans isomerization of a carbon-carbon double bond in this chromophore sets in motion the chain of biochemical processes responsible for vision. Here, we obtain atomically resolved images of individual structural isomers of the retinal chromophore attached to C60 molecules and study their dynamic behaviour inside a confined space--that is, inside single-walled carbon nanotubes--using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM). Sequential HR-TEM images with sub-second time resolution directly reveal the isomerization between the cis and all-trans forms of retinal, as well as conformational changes and volume-conserving effects. This work opens up the possibility of investigating in vitro the biological activities of these photoresponsive molecules on an individual basis, and the molecular imaging technique described here is a general one that can be applied to a wide range of systems.",M1
18638482,"Agonist-induced conformational changes in bovine rhodopsin: insight into activation of G-protein-coupled receptors.Activation of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) is initiated by conformational changes in the transmembrane (TM) helices and the intra- and extracellular loops induced by ligand binding. Understanding the conformational changes in GPCRs leading to activation is imperative in deciphering the role of these receptors in the pathology of diseases. Since the crystal structures of activated GPCRs are not yet available, computational methods and biophysical techniques have been used to predict the structures of GPCR active states. We have recently applied the computational method LITiCon to understand the ligand-induced conformational changes in beta(2)-adrenergic receptor by ligands of varied efficacies. Here we report a study of the conformational changes associated with the activation of bovine rhodopsin for which the crystal structure of the inactive state is known. Starting from the inactive (dark) state, we have predicted the TM conformational changes that are induced by the isomerization of 11-cis <e>retinal</e> to all-trans retinal leading to the fully activated state, metarhodopsin II. The predicted active state of rhodopsin satisfies all of the 30 known experimental distance constraints. The predicted model also correlates well with the experimentally observed conformational switches in rhodopsin and other class A GPCRs, namely, the breaking of the ionic lock between R135(3.50) at the intracellular end of TM3 (part of the DRY motif) and E247(6.30) on TM6, and the rotamer toggle switch on W265(6.48) on TM6. We observe that the toggling of the W265(6.48) rotamer modulates the bend angle of TM6 around the conserved proline. The rotamer toggling is facilitated by the formation of a water wire connecting S298(7.45), W265(6.48) and H211(5.46). As a result, the intracellular ends of TMs 5 and 6 move outward from the protein core, causing large conformational changes at the cytoplasmic interface. The predicted outward movements of TM5 and TM6 are in agreement with the recently published crystal structure of opsin, which is proposed to be close to the active-state structure. In the predicted active state, several residues in the intracellular loops, such as R69, V139(3.54), T229, Q237, Q239, S240, T243 and V250(6.33), become more water exposed compared to the inactive state. These residues may be involved in mediating the conformational signal from the receptor to the G protein. From mutagenesis studies, some of these residues, such as V139(3.54), T229 and V250(6.33), are already implicated in G-protein activation. The predicted active state also leads to the formation of new stabilizing interhelical hydrogen-bond contacts, such as those between W265(6.48) and H211(5.46) and E122(3.37) and C167(4.56). These hydrogen-bond contacts serve as potential conformational switches offering new opportunities for future experimental investigations. The calculated retinal binding energy surface shows that binding of an agonist makes the receptor dynamic and flexible and accessible to many conformations, while binding of an inverse agonist traps the receptor in the inactive state and makes the other conformations inaccessible.",M1
18620541,"Mechanism of photoisomerization of the rhodopsin chromophore.This work is devoted to the problem connected with rhodopsin activation. Electrostatic forces involved in photoisomerization of <e>retinal</e> are considered. It is suggested that the repulsion force and rotating moment between electric dipole moments of methyl groups on the C5 and C13 atoms of retinal can promote isomerization upon light absorption because the pi-pi* transition is accompanied by a decrease in the potential barrier for torsional rotations around the C11-C12 bond.",M1
18606814,"Retinyl ester homeostasis in the adipose differentiation-related protein-deficient retina.The <e>retinal</e> pigmented epithelium (RPE) plays an essential role in vision, including storing and converting retinyl esters of the visual chromophore, 11-cis-retinal. Retinyl ester storage structures (RESTs), specialized lipid droplets within the RPE, take up retinyl esters synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Here we report studies of mice lacking exons 2 and 3 of the gene encoding adipose differentiation-related protein (Adfp), a structural component of RESTs. We found that dark adaptation was slower in Adfp(Delta2-3/Delta2-3) than in Adfp+/+ mice and that Adfp(Delta2-3/Delta2-3) mice had consistently delayed clearances of all-trans-retinal and all-trans-retinol from rod photoreceptor cells. Two-photon microscopy revealed aberrant trafficking of all-trans-retinyl esters in the RPE of Adfp(Delta2-3/Delta2-3) mice, a problem caused by abnormal maintenance of RESTs in the dark-adapted state. Retinyl ester accumulation was also reduced in Adfp(Delta2-3/Delta2-3) as compared with Adfp+/+ mice. These observations suggest that Adfp plays a unique role in vision by maintaining proper storage and trafficking of retinoids within the eye.",M1
18590305,"<e>Retinal</e> models: comparison of electronic absorption spectra in the gas phase and in methanol solution.An accurate study on several models of the 11-cis-retinal protonated Schiff base (PSB) has been performed both in vacuo and in methanol solution. Condensed phase calculations have been carried out making use of the ASEP/MD method, which permits the employment of the same high-level ab initio calculations usually applied in gas phase studies as well as a detailed description of the solvent structure around the solute through molecular dynamics simulations of the complete system. The solute structure was completely optimized in vacuo and in solution at the CASSCF level and/or MP2 level, and the CASPT2 method was applied for the calculation of the vertical transition energies and solvent shift values. Our results reproduce and explain the main features of the experimental absorption spectra of the 11-cis-retinal PSB. Two well-resolved bands can be identified in vacuo (separated by roughly 1.0 eV), whereas only a single broad band is observed in solution. This fact is explained by the existence of two almost degenerate excited states in methanol. The inclusion of two methyl groups at the iminium end of the system permits the reproduction of the experimental solvent shift value.",M1
18563917,"11-cis- and all-trans-retinols can activate rod opsin: rational design of the visual cycle.Rhodopsin is the photosensitive pigment in the rod photoreceptor cell. Upon absorption of a photon, the covalently bound 11- cis-<e>retinal</e> isomerizes to the all- trans form, enabling rhodopsin to activate transducin, its G protein. All -trans-retinal is then released from the protein and reduced to all -trans-retinol. It is subsequently transported to the retinal pigment epithelium where it is converted to 11- cis-retinol and oxidized to 11- cis-retinal before it is transported back to the photoreceptor to regenerate rhodopsin and complete the visual cycle. In this study, we have measured the effects of all -trans- and 11- cis-retinals and -retinols on the opsin's ability to activate transducin to ascertain their potentials for activating the signaling cascade. Only 11- cis-retinal acts as an inverse agonist to the opsin. All -trans-retinal, all -trans-retinol, and 11- cis-retinol are all agonists with all -trans-retinal being the most potent agonist and all -trans-retinol being the least potent. Taken as a whole, our study is consistent with the hypothesis that the steps in the visual cycle are optimized such that the rod can serve as a highly sensitive dim light receptor. All -trans-retinal is immediately reduced in the photoreceptor to prevent back reactions and to weaken its effectiveness as an agonist before it is transported out of the cell; oxidation of 11- cis-retinol occurs in the retinal pigment epithelium and not the rod photoreceptor cell because 11- cis-retinol can act as an agonist and activate the signaling cascade if it were to bind an opsin, effectively adapting the cell to light.",M1
18563085,"Crystal structure of the ligand-free G-protein-coupled receptor opsin.In the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) rhodopsin, the inactivating ligand 11-cis-<e>retinal</e> is bound in the seven-transmembrane helix (TM) bundle and is cis/trans isomerized by light to form active metarhodopsin II. With metarhodopsin II decay, all-trans-retinal is released, and opsin is reloaded with new 11-cis-retinal. Here we present the crystal structure of ligand-free native opsin from bovine retinal rod cells at 2.9 ångström (A) resolution. Compared to rhodopsin, opsin shows prominent structural changes in the conserved E(D)RY and NPxxY(x)(5,6)F regions and in TM5-TM7. At the cytoplasmic side, TM6 is tilted outwards by 6-7 A, whereas the helix structure of TM5 is more elongated and close to TM6. These structural changes, some of which were attributed to an active GPCR state, reorganize the empty retinal-binding pocket to disclose two openings that may serve the entry and exit of retinal. The opsin structure sheds new light on ligand binding to GPCRs and on GPCR activation.",M1

18515390,"Excitation energy-transfer and the relative orientation of <e>retinal</e> and carotenoid in xanthorhodopsin.The cell membrane of Salinibacter ruber contains xanthorhodopsin, a light-driven transmembrane proton pump with two chromophores: a retinal and the carotenoid, salinixanthin. Action spectra for transport had indicated that light absorbed by either is utilized for function. If the carotenoid is an antenna in this protein, its excited state energy has to be transferred to the retinal and should be detected in the retinal fluorescence. From fluorescence studies, we show that energy transfer occurs from the excited singlet S(2) state of salinixanthin to the S(1) state of the retinal. Comparison of the absorption spectrum with the excitation spectrum for retinal emission yields 45 +/- 5% efficiency for the energy transfer. Such high efficiency would require close proximity and favorable geometry for the two polyene chains, but from the heptahelical crystallographic structure of the homologous retinal protein, bacteriorhodopsin, it is not clear where the carotenoid can be located near the retinal. The fluorescence excitation anisotropy spectrum reveals that the angle between their transition dipole moments is 56 +/- 3 degrees . The protein accommodates the carotenoid as a second chromophore in a distinct binding site to harvest light with both extended wavelength and polarization ranges. The results establish xanthorhodopsin as the simplest biological excited-state donor-acceptor system for collecting light.",M1
18515067,"Xanthorhodopsin: a bacteriorhodopsin-like proton pump with a carotenoid antenna.Xanthorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump like bacteriorhodopsin, but made more effective for collecting light by its second chromophore, salinixanthin, a carotenoid. Action spectra for transport and fluorescence of the <e>retinal</e> upon excitation of the carotenoid indicate that the carotenoid functions as an antenna to the retinal. The calculated center-to-center distance and angle of the transition moments of the two chromophores are 11 A and 56 degrees , respectively. As expected from their proximity, the carotenoid and the retinal closely interact: tight binding of the carotenoid, as indicated by its sharpened vibration bands and intense induced circular dichroism in the visible, is removed by hydrolysis of the retinal Schiff base, and restored upon reconstitution with retinal. This antenna system, simpler than photosynthetic complexes, is well-suited to study features of excited-state energy migration.",M1
18512957,"Crystal structures of substrate-free and retinoic acid-bound cyanobacterial cytochrome P450 CYP120A1.The crystal structures of substrate-free and all-trans-retinoic acid-bound CYP120A1 from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 were determined at 2.4 and 2.1 A resolution, respectively, representing the first structural characterization of a cyanobacterial P450. Features of CYP120A1 not observed in other P450 structures include an aromatic ladder flanking the channel leading to the active site and a triple-glycine motif within SRS5.

Metabolism of retinoic acid by CYP120A1 suggests that CYP120A1 hydroxylates a variety of retinoid derivatives in vivo.

18480818,"Crystal structure of squid rhodopsin.Invertebrate phototransduction uses an inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate signalling cascade in which photoactivated rhodopsin stimulates a G(q)-type G protein, that is, a class of G protein that stimulates membrane-bound phospholipase Cbeta. The same cascade is used by many G-protein-coupled receptors, indicating that invertebrate rhodopsin is a prototypical member. Here we report the crystal structure of squid (Todarodes pacificus) rhodopsin at 2.5 A resolution. Among seven transmembrane alpha-helices, helices V and VI extend into the cytoplasmic medium and, together with two cytoplasmic helices, they form a rigid protrusion from the membrane surface. This peculiar structure, which is not seen in bovine rhodopsin, seems to be crucial for the recognition of G(q)-type G proteins. The <e>retinal</e> Schiff base forms a hydrogen bond to Asn 87 or Tyr 111; it is far from the putative counterion Glu 180. In the crystal, a tight association is formed between the amino-terminal polypeptides of neighbouring monomers; this intermembrane dimerization may be responsible for the organization of hexagonally packed microvillar membranes in the photoreceptor rhabdom.",M1
18474598,"<e>Retinal</e> pigment epithelium-retinal G protein receptor-opsin mediates light-dependent translocation of all-trans-retinyl esters for synthesis of visual chromophore in retinal pigment epithelial cells.Visual perception begins with the absorption of a photon by an opsin pigment, inducing isomerization of its 11-cis-retinaldehyde chromophore. After a brief period of activation, the resulting all-trans-retinaldehyde dissociates from the opsin apoprotein rendering it insensitive to light. Restoring light sensitivity to apo-opsin requires thermal re-isomerization of all-trans-retinaldehyde to 11-cis-retinaldehyde via an enzyme pathway called the visual cycle in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) cells. Vertebrates can see over a 10(8)-fold range of background illumination. This implies that the visual cycle can regenerate a visual chromophore over a similarly broad range. However, nothing is known about how the visual cycle is regulated. Here we show that RPE cells, functionally or physically separated from photoreceptors, respond to light by mobilizing all-trans-retinyl esters. These retinyl esters are substrates for the retinoid isomerase and hence critical for regenerating visual chromophore. We show in knock-out mice and by RNA interference in human RPE cells that this mobilization is mediated by a protein called  RPE-retinal G protein receptor  (RGR) opsin. These data establish that RPE cells are intrinsically sensitive to light. Finally, we show that in the dark, RGR-opsin inhibits lecithin:retinol acyltransferase and all-trans-retinyl ester hydrolase in vitro and that this inhibition is released upon exposure to light. The results of this study suggest that RGR-opsin mediates light-dependent translocation of all-trans-retinyl esters from a storage pool in lipid droplets to an  isomerase pool  in membranes of the endoplasmic reticulum. This translocation permits insoluble all-trans-retinyl esters to be utilized as substrate for the synthesis of a new visual chromophore.",M1
18469196,"Reprogramming progeny cells of embryonic RPE to produce photoreceptors: development of advanced photoreceptor traits under the induction of neuroD.PURPOSE: In examining the prospect of producing functional photoreceptors by reprogramming the differentiation of RPE progeny cells, this study was conducted to investigate whether reprogrammed cells can develop highly specialized ultrastructural and physiological traits that characterize <e>retinal</e> photoreceptors. METHODS: Cultured chick RPE cells were reprogrammed to differentiate along the photoreceptor pathway by ectopic expression of neuroD. Cellular ultrastructure was examined with electron microscopy. Cellular physiology was studied by monitoring cellular free calcium (Ca(2+)) levels in dark-adapted cells in response to light and in light-bleached cells in response to 9-cis-retinal. RESULTS: Reprogrammed cells were found to localize red opsin protein appropriately to the apex. These cells developed inner segments rich in mitochondria, and while in culture, some formed rudimentary outer segments, analogous to those of developing photoreceptors in the retina. In response to light, reprogrammed cells reduced their Ca(2+) levels, as observed with developing retinal photoreceptors in culture. Further, on exposure to 9-cis-retinal, the light-bleached, reprogrammed cells increased their Ca(2+) levels, reminiscent of visual cycle recovery. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the potential of reprogrammed cells to develop advanced ultrastructural and physiological traits of photoreceptors and point to reprogramming progeny cells of embryonic RPE as a possible alternative in producing developing photoreceptors.",M1
18433714,"Screening and characterization of proteorhodopsin color-tuning mutations in Escherichia coli with endogenous <e>retinal</e> synthesis.Proteorhodopsin is photoactive 7-transmembrane protein, which uses all-trans retinal as a chromophore. Proteorhodopsin subfamilies are spectrally tuned in accordance with the depth of habitat of the host organisms, numerous species of marine picoplankton. We try to find residues critical for the spectral tuning through the use of random PCR mutagenesis and endogenous retinal biosynthesis. We obtained 16 isolates with changed color by screening in Escherichia coli with internal retinal biosynthesis system containing genes for beta-carotene biosynthesis and retinal synthase. Some isolates contained multiple substitutions, which could be separated to give 20 single mutations influencing the spectral properties. The color-changing residues are distributed through the protein except for the helix A, and about a half of the mutations is localized on the helices C and D, implying their importance for color tuning. In the pumping form of the pigment, absorption maxima in 8 mutants are red-shifted and in 12 mutants are blue-shifted compared to the wild-type. The results of flash-photolysis showed that most of the low pumping activity mutants possess slower rates of M decay and O decay. These results suggest that the color-tuning residues are not restricted to the retinal binding pocket, in accord with a recent evolutionary analysis.",M1
18422873,"Activity switches of rhodopsin.Rhodopsin, the visual pigment of the rod photoreceptor cell contains as its light-sensitive cofactor 11-cis <e>retinal</e>, which is bound by a protonated Schiff base between its aldehyde group and the Lys296 side chain of the apoprotein. Light activation is achieved by 11-cis to all-trans isomerization and subsequent thermal relaxation into the active, G protein-binding metarhodopsin II state. Metarhodopsin II decays via two parallel pathways, which both involve hydrolysis of the Schiff base eventually to opsin and released all-trans retinal. Subsequently, rhodopsin's dark state is regenerated by a complicated retinal metabolism, termed the retinoid cycle. Unlike other retinal proteins, such as bacteriorhodopsin, this regeneration cycle cannot be short cut by light, because blue illumination of active metarhodopsin II does not lead back to the ground state but to the formation of largely inactive metarhodopsin III. In this review, mechanistic details of activating and deactivating pathways of rhodopsin, particularly concerning the roles of the retinal, are compared. Based on static and time-resolved UV/Vis and FTIR spectroscopic data, we discuss a model of the light-induced deactivation. We describe properties and photoreactions of metarhodopsin III and suggest potential roles of this intermediate for vision.",M1

These assays function well with small, complex biological samples (10-20mg tissue). Coefficients of variation range from 5.9 to 10.0% (intraday) and from 5.9 to 11.0% (interday). Quantification of endogenous RE, ROL, and RAL in mouse serum and tissues (liver, kidney, adipose, muscle, spleen, testis, skin, brain, and brain regions) reveals utility. Ability to discriminate spatial concentrations of ROL and RE is illustrated with C57BL/6 mouse brain loci (hippocampus, cortex, olfactory bulb, thalamus, cerebellum, and striatum). We also developed a method to distinguish isomeric forms of ROL to investigate precursors of retinoic acid. The ROL isomer assay has limits of detection between 3.5 and 4.5 pmol and has a linear range and coefficient of variation similar to those of the ROL/RE and RAL assays. The assays described here provide for sensitive and rigorous quantification of endogenous RE, ROL, and RAL to elucidate retinoid homeostasis in disease states such as Alzheimer's disease, type 2 diabetes, obesity, and cancer.",M1

In Lrat(-/-) and Rpe65(-/-) mice, models of human Leber congenital amaurosis, the retinoid cycle is disrupted and 11-cis-retinal, the chromophore of visual pigments, is not produced. The Lrat(-/-) and Rpe65(-/-) retina phenotype presents with rapid sectorial cone degeneration, and the visual pigments, S-opsin and M/L-opsin, fail to traffic to cone outer segments appropriately. In contrast, rod opsin traffics normally in mutant rods. Concomitantly, guanylate cyclase 1, cone T alpha-subunit, cone phosphodiesterase 6alpha' (PDE6alpha'), and GRK1 (G-protein-coupled receptor kinase 1; opsin kinase) are not transported to Lrat(-/-) and Rpe65(-/-) cone outer segments. Aberrant localization of these membrane-associated proteins was evident at postnatal day 15, before the onset of ventral and central cone degeneration. Protein levels of cone T alpha and cone PDE6alpha' were reduced, whereas their transcript levels were unchanged, suggesting posttranslational degradation. In an Rpe65(-/-)Rho(-/-) double knock-out model, trafficking of cone pigments and membrane-associated cone phototransduction polypeptides to the outer segments proceeded normally after 11-cis-retinal administration. These results suggest that ventral and central cone opsins must be regenerated with 11-cis-retinal to permit transport to the outer segments. Furthermore, the presence of 11-cis-retinal is essential for proper transport of several membrane-associated cone phototransduction polypeptides in these cones.",M1
18399915,"Chromophore interaction in xanthorhodopsin--<e>retinal</e> dependence of salinixanthin binding.Xanthorhodopsin is a light-driven proton pump in the extremely halophilic bacterium Salinibacter ruber. Its unique feature is that besides retinal it has a carotenoid, salinixanthin, with a light harvesting function. Tight and specific binding of the carotenoid antenna is controlled by binding of the retinal. Addition of all-trans retinal to xanthorhodopsin bleached with hydroxylamine restores not only the retinal chromophore absorption band, but causes sharpening of the salinixanthin bands reflecting its rigid binding by the protein. In this report we examine the correlation of the changes in the two chromophores during bleaching and reconstitution with native all-trans retinal, artificial retinal analogs and retinol. Bleaching and reconstitution both appear to be multistage processes. The carotenoid absorption changes during bleaching occurred not only upon hydrolysis of the Schiff base but continued while the retinal was leaving its binding site. In the case of reconstitution, the 13-desmethyl analog formed the protonated Schiff base slower than retinal, and provided the opportunity to observe changes in carotenoid binding at various stages. The characteristic sharpening of the carotenoid bands, indicative of its reduced conformational heterogeneity in the binding site, occurs when the retinal occupies the binding site but the covalent bond to Lys-240 via a Schiff base is not yet formed. This is confirmed by the results for retinol reconstitution, where the Schiff base does not form but the carotenoid exhibits its characteristic spectral change from the binding.",M1
18399914,"Rhodopsin regeneration is accelerated via noncovalent 11-cis <e>retinal</e>-opsin complex--a role of retinal binding pocket of opsin.The regeneration of bovine rhodopsin from its apoprotein opsin and the prosthetic group 11-cis retinal involves the formation of a retinylidene Schiff base with the epsilon-amino group of the active lysine residue of opsin. The pH dependence of a Schiff base formation in solution follows a typical bell-shaped profile because of the pH dependence of the formation and the following dehydration of a 1-aminoethanol intermediate. Unexpectedly, however, we find that the formation of rhodopsin from 11-cis retinal and opsin does not depend on pH over a wide pH range. These results are interpreted by the Matsumoto and Yoshizawa (Nature 258 [1975] 523) model of rhodopsin regeneration in which the 11-cis retinal chromophore binds first to opsin through the beta-ionone ring, followed by the slow formation of the retinylidene Schiff base in a restricted space. We find the second-order rate constant of the rhodopsin formation is 6100+/-300 mol(-1) s(-1) at 25 degrees C over the pH range 5-10. The second-order rate constant is much greater than that of a model Schiff base in solution by a factor of more than 10(7). A previous report by Pajares and Rando (J Biol Chem 264 [1989] 6804) suggests that the lysyl epsilon-NH(2) group of opsin is protonated when the beta-ionone ring binding site is unoccupied. The acceleration of the Schiff base formation in rhodopsin is explained by stabilization of the deprotonated form of the lysyl epsilon-NH(2) group which might be induced when the beta-ionone ring binding site is occupied through the noncovalent binding of 11-cis retinal to opsin at the initial stage of rhodopsin regeneration, followed by the proximity and orientation effect rendered by the formation of noncovalent 11-cis retinal-opsin complex.",M1
18390613,"Mechanism of signal propagation upon <e>retinal</e> isomerization: insights from molecular dynamics simulations of rhodopsin restrained by normal modes.As one of the best studied members of the pharmaceutically relevant family of G-protein-coupled receptors, rhodopsin serves as a prototype for understanding the mechanism of G-protein-coupled receptor activation. Here, we aim at exploring functionally relevant conformational changes and signal transmission mechanisms involved in its photoactivation brought about through a cis-trans photoisomerization of retinal. For this exploration, we propose a molecular dynamics simulation protocol that utilizes normal modes derived from the anisotropic network model for proteins. Deformations along multiple low-frequency modes of motion are used to efficiently sample collective conformational changes in the presence of explicit membrane and water environment, consistent with interresidue interactions. We identify two highly stable regions in rhodopsin, one clustered near the chromophore, the other near the cytoplasmic ends of transmembrane helices H1, H2, and H7. Due to redistribution of interactions in the neighborhood of retinal upon stabilization of the trans form, local structural rearrangements in the adjoining H3-H6 residues are efficiently propagated to the cytoplasmic end of these particular helices. In the structures obtained by our simulations, all-trans retinal interacts with Cys(167) on H4 and Phe(203) on H5, which were not accessible in the dark state, and exhibits stronger interactions with H5, while some of the contacts made (in the cis form) with H6 are lost.",M1
18351404,"The molecular structure of a curl-shaped <e>retinal</e> isomer.Computational studies of retinal protonated Schiff base (PSB) isomers show that a twisted curl-shaped conformation of the retinyl chain is a new low-lying minimum on the ground-state potential energy surface. The curl-shaped isomer has a twisted structure in the vicinity of the C(11)=C(12) double bond where the 11-cis retinal PSB isomerizes in the rhodopsin photoreaction. The twisted configuration is a trapped structure between the 11-cis and all-trans isomers. Rotation around the C(10)-C(11) single bond towards the 11-cis structure is prevented by steric interactions of the two methyl groups on the retinyl chain and by the torsion barrier of the C(10)-C(11) bond in the other direction. Calculations of spectroscopic properties of the 11-cis, all-trans, and curl-shaped isomers provide useful data for future identification of the new retinal PSB isomer. Circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy might be used to distinguish between the retinal PSB isomers. The potential energy surface for the orientation of the beta-ionone ring of the 11-cis retinal PSB reveals three minima depending on the torsion angle of the beta-ionone ring. Two of the minima correspond to 6-s-cis configurations and one has the beta-ionone ring in 6-s-trans position. The calculated CD spectra for the two 6-s-cis configurations differ significantly indicating that the sign of the beta-ionone ring torsion angle could be determined using CD spectroscopy. Calculations of the CD spectra suggest that a flip of the beta-ionone ring might occur during the first 1 ps of the photoreaction.

18346085,"Alpha-<e>retinals</e> as rhodopsin chromophores--preference for the 9-Z configuration and partial agonist activity.The visual pigment rhodopsin, the photosensory element of the rod photoreceptor cell in the vertebrate retina, shows in combination with an endogenous ligand, 11-Z retinal, an astonishing photochemical performance. It exhibits an unprecedented quantum yield (0.67) in a highly defined and ultrafast photoisomerization process. This triggers the conformational changes leading to the active state Meta(rhodopsin) II. Retinal is covalently bound to Lys-296 of the protein opsin in a protonated Schiff base. The resulting positive charge delocalization over the terminal part of the polyene chain of retinal creates a conjugation defect that upon photoexcitation moves to the opposite end of the polyene. Shortening the polyene as in 4,5-dehydro,5,6-dihydro (alpha), 5,6-dihydro or 7,8-dihydro-analogs might facilitate photoisomerization of a 9-Z and a 11-Z bond. Here we describe pigment analogs generated with bovine opsin and 11-Z or 9-Z 4,5-dehydro,5,6-dihydro-retinal that were further characterized by UV-Vis and FTIR spectroscopy. The preference of opsin for native 11-Z retinal over the 9-Z isomer is reversed in 4,5-dehydro,5,6-dihydro-retinal. 9-Z 4,5-dehydro,5,6-dihydro-retinal readily generated a photosensitive pigment. This modification has no effect on the quantum yield, but affects the Batho&lt;--&gt;blueshifted intermediate (BSI) equilibrium and leads to a strong decrease in the G-protein activation rate because of a downshift of the pK(a) of the Meta I&lt;--&gt;Meta II equilibrium.",M1
18326740,"Nrl-knockout mice deficient in Rpe65 fail to synthesize 11-cis <e>retinal</e> and cone outer segments.PURPOSE: To define rod and cone function further in terms of visual cycle mechanism, the retinal phenotype resulting from Rpe65 (retinoid isomerase I) deficiency in Nrl(-)(/)(-) mice having a single class of photoreceptors resembling wild-type cones was characterized and outcomes of retinoid supplementation evaluated. METHODS: Rpe65(-)(/)(-)/Nrl(-)(/)(-) mice were generated by breeding Rpe65(-)(/)(-) and Nrl(-)(/)(-) strains. Retinal histology, protein expression, retinoid content, and electroretinographic (ERG) responses were evaluated before and after treatment with 11-cis retinal by intraperitoneal injection. Results Retinas of young Rpe65(-)(/-)/Nrl(-)(/-) mice exhibited normal lamination, but lacked intact photoreceptor outer segments at all ages examined. Rpe65, Nrl, and rhodopsin were not detected, and S-opsin and M/L-opsin levels were reduced. Retinyl esters were the only retinoids present. In contrast, Nrl(-)(/)(-) mice exhibited decreased levels of retinaldehydes and retinyl esters, and elevated levels of retinols. ERG responses were elicited from Rpe65(-)(/-)/Nrl(-)(/-) mice only at the two highest intensities over a 4-log-unit range. Significant retinal thinning and outer nuclear layer loss occurred in Rpe65(-)(/-)/Nrl(-)(/-) mice with aging. Administration of exogenous 11-cis retinal did not rescue retinal morphology or markedly improve ERG responses. CONCLUSIONS: The findings provide clarification of reported cone loss of function in Rpe65(-)(/-)/Nrl(-)(/-) mice, now showing that chromophore absence results in destabilized cone outer segments and rapid retinal degeneration. The data support the view that rod-dominant retinas do not have a cone-specific mechanism for 11-cis retinal synthesis and have potential significance for therapeutic strategies for rescue of cone-rich retinal regions affected by disease in the aging human population.",M1

We have demonstrated that irradiation of such a system with visible light (400-700 nm) distorts the most important functional property of native visual pigment--its ability to regenerate after addition of 11-cis-retinal in the dark. We have also shown that all-trans-retinal bound to membrane phospholipids and rhodopsin has less photosensitizing activity that free all-trans-retinal.",M1
18296659,"Rpe65-/- and Lrat-/- mice: comparable models of leber congenital amaurosis.PURPOSE: The Rpe65-/- mouse, used as a model for Leber congenital amaurosis, has slow rod degeneration and rapid cone loss, presumably because of the mistrafficking of cone opsins. This animal does not generate 11-cis <e>retinal</e>, and both cone loss and rod response are restored by 11-cis retinal administration. Similarly, the Lrat-/- mouse does not produce 11-cis retinal. The authors sought to determine whether the same effects on rod and cone opsins in the Rpe65-/- mouse are also present in the Lrat-/- mouse, thereby establishing that these changes can be attributed to the lack of 11-cis retinal rather than to some unknown function of RPE65. METHODS: Rod and cone opsins were localized by immunohistochemical methods. Functional opsin levels were determined by regeneration with 11-cis retinal. Isorhodopsin levels were determined from pigment extraction. Opsin phosphorylation was determined by mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Rods in both models degenerated slowly. Regenerable rod opsin levels were similar over the 6-month time course investigated, rod opsin was phosphorylated at a low level (approximately 10%), and minimal 9-cis retinal was generated by a nonphotic process, giving a trace light response. In both models, S-opsin and M/L-opsin failed to traffic to the cone outer segments appropriately, and rapid cone degeneration occurred. Cone opsin mistrafficking in both models was arrested on 11-cis retinal administration. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that the Lrat-/- and Rpe65-/- mice are comparable models for studies of Leber congenital amaurosis and that the destructive cone opsin mistrafficking is caused by the lack of 11-cis retinal.",M1

In the NOCV framework, the formation of the sigma-bond appears as the sum of two complementary charge transfer processes from each vinyl fragment to the bond region, and partially to the other fragment.

The NOCV eigenvalues and the related fragment-fragment bond multiplicities were used as quantitative measures of the sigma- and pi- contributions.

18195010,"Metabolic basis of visual cycle inhibition by retinoid and nonretinoid compounds in the vertebrate retina.In vertebrate <e>retinal</e> photoreceptors, the absorption of light by rhodopsin leads to photoisomerization of 11-cis-retinal to its all-trans isomer. To sustain vision, a metabolic system evolved that recycles all-trans-retinal back to 11-cis-retinal. The importance of this visual (retinoid) cycle is underscored by the fact that mutations in genes encoding visual cycle components induce a wide spectrum of diseases characterized by abnormal levels of specific retinoid cycle intermediates. In addition, intense illumination can produce retinoid cycle by-products that are toxic to the retina. Thus, inhibition of the retinoid cycle has therapeutic potential in physiological and pathological states. Four classes of inhibitors that include retinoid and nonretinoid compounds have been identified. We investigated the modes of action of these inhibitors by using purified visual cycle components and in vivo systems. We report that retinylamine was the most potent and specific inhibitor of the retinoid cycle among the tested compounds and that it targets the retinoid isomerase, RPE65. Hydrophobic primary amines like farnesylamine also showed inhibitory potency but a short duration of action, probably due to rapid metabolism. These compounds also are reactive nucleophiles with potentially high cellular toxicity. We also evaluated the role of a specific protein-mediated mechanism on retinoid cycle inhibitor uptake by the eye. Our results show that retinylamine is transported to and taken up by the eye by retinol-binding protein-independent and retinoic acid-responsive gene product 6-independent mechanisms. Finally, we provide evidence for a crucial role of lecithin: retinol acyltransferase activity in mediating tissue specific absorption and long lasting therapeutic effects of retinoid-based visual cycle inhibitors.",M1

18175323,"Expanding GPCR homology model binding sites via a balloon potential: A molecular dynamics refinement approach.Homology modeling of G protein-coupled receptors is becoming a widely used tool in drug discovery. However, unrefined models built using the bovine rhodopsin crystal structure as the template, often have binding sites that are too small to accommodate known ligands. Here, we present a novel systematic method to refine model active sites based on a pressure-guided molecular dynamics simulation. A distinct advantage of this approach is the ability to introduce systematic perturbations in model backbone atoms in addition to side chain adjustments. The method is validated on two test cases: (1) docking of <e>retinal</e> into an MD-relaxed structure of opsin and (2) docking of known ligands into a homology model of the CCR2 receptor. In both cases, we show that the MD expansion algorithm makes it possible to dock the ligands in poses that agree with the crystal structure or mutagenesis data.",M1
18172125,"Ocular biometry in preterm infants: implications for estimation of <e>retinal</e> illuminance.PURPOSE: Retinal illuminance varies with stimulus luminance, pupil size, eye size, and transmissivity of the ocular media. There are few published data to inform estimates of retinal illuminance in early infancy, and no concurrent studies of pupil size and ocular length have been described. The goals were to document simultaneously the measured ocular parameters in growing preterm infants and to estimate the potential errors associated with using either stimulus luminance or troland value as a proxy for retinal illuminance in this population. METHODS: Ocular biometry including diameters of the eye, vitreous chamber depth (VCD) and dilated pupil diameter was performed on 111 occasions in 33 preterm infants aged between 30 and 55 weeks' postmenstrual age. RESULTS: Eye size increased rapidly between 30 and 55 postmenstrual weeks and was comparable to that of term-born infants. The ratio of dilated pupil area to VCD(2) was highly variable. Retinal illuminance of the infant eye compared with adult eyes was underestimated by both stimulus luminance and troland values. CONCLUSIONS: Stimulus luminance and troland values cannot be used to infer retinal illuminance when comparing eyes of markedly differing sizes or transmissivities. Error in estimating retinal illuminance in prematurely born infants is inevitable because of uncertainty regarding media transmissivity, but this discrepancy can be minimized by using directly measured pupil diameter and data presented herein for eye size in this population.",M1

Toluene was the most hydrophobic among the organic solvents tested; thus, it was used to dissolve beta-carotene, which is a hydrophobic compound. Tween 80 was selected as the detergent because it supported the highest level of retinal production among all of the detergents tested. The maximum production of retinal was achieved in detergent micelles containing 200 mg/L of beta-carotene and 2.4% (w/v) Tween 80. Under these conditions, the recombinant enzyme produced 97 mg/L of retinal after 16 h with a conversion yield of 48.5% (w/w). The amount of retinal produced, which is the highest ever reported, is a result of the ability of our system to dissolve large amounts of beta-carotene.",M1
18063586,"Rhodopsin and 9-demethyl-<e>retinal</e> analog: effect of a partial agonist on displacement of transmembrane helix 6 in class A G protein-coupled receptors.Rhodopsin is the visual pigment of rod cells and a prototypical G protein-coupled receptor. It is activated by cis--&gt;trans photoisomerization of the covalently bound chromophore 11-cis-retinal, which acts in the cis configuration as an inverse agonist. Light-induced formation of the full agonist all-trans-retinal in situ triggers conformational changes in the protein moiety. Partial agonists of rhodopsin include a retinal analog lacking the methyl group at C-9, termed 9-demethyl-retinal (9-dm-retinal). Rhodopsin reconstituted with this retinal (9-dm-rhodopsin) activates G protein poorly. Here we investigated the molecular nature of the partial agonism in 9-dm-rhodopsin using site-directed spin labeling. Earlier site-directed spin labeling studies of rhodopsin identified a rigid-body tilt of the cytoplasmic segment of [corrected] transmembrane helix 6 (TM6) by approximately 6A as a central event in rhodopsin activation. Data presented here provide additional evidence for this mechanism. Only a small fraction of photoexcited 9-dm pigments reaches the TM6-tilted conformation. This fraction can be increased by increasing proton concentration or [corrected] by anticipation of the activating protonation step by the mutation E134Q in 9-dm-rhodopsin. These results on protein conformation are in complete accord with previous findings regarding the biological activity of the 9-dm pigments. When the proton concentration is further increased, a new state arises in 9-dm pigments that is linked to direct proton uptake at the retinal Schiff base. This state apparently has a conformation distinguishable from the active state.",M1

20534668,"Proper differentiation of photoreceptors and amacrine cells depends on a regulatory loop between NeuroD and Six6.Timely generation of distinct neural cell types in appropriate numbers is fundamental for the generation of a functional retina. In vertebrates, the transcription factor Six6 is initially expressed in multipotent retina progenitors and then becomes restricted to differentiated <e>retinal</e> ganglion and amacrine cells. How Six6 expression in the retina is controlled and what are its precise functions are still unclear. To address this issue, we used bioinformatic searches and transgenic approaches in medaka fish (Oryzias latipes) to characterise highly conserved regulatory enhancers responsible for Six6 expression. One of the enhancers drove gene expression in the differentiating and adult retina. A search for transcription factor binding sites, together with luciferase, ChIP assays and gain-of-function studies, indicated that NeuroD, a bHLH transcription factor, directly binds an 'E-box' sequence present in this enhancer and specifically regulates Six6 expression in the retina. NeuroD-induced Six6 overexpression in medaka embryos promoted unorganized retinal progenitor proliferation and, most notably, impaired photoreceptor differentiation, with no apparent changes in other retinal cell types. Conversely, Six6 gain- and loss-of-function changed NeuroD expression levels and altered the expression of the photoreceptor differentiation marker Rhodopsin. In addition, knockdown of Six6 interfered with amacrine cell generation. Together, these results indicate that Six6 and NeuroD control the expression of each other and their functions coordinate amacrine cell generation and photoreceptor terminal differentiation.",M2
20534447,"The orphan nuclear hormone receptor ERRbeta controls rod photoreceptor survival.Mutation of rod photoreceptor-enriched transcription factors is a major cause of inherited blindness. We identified the orphan nuclear hormone receptor estrogen-related receptor beta (ERRbeta) as selectively expressed in rod photoreceptors. Overexpression of ERRbeta induces expression of rod-specific genes in retinas of wild-type as well as Nrl(-/-) mice, which lack rod photoreceptors. Mutation of ERRbeta results in dysfunction and degeneration of rods, whereas inverse agonists of ERRbeta trigger rapid rod degeneration, which is rescued by constitutively active mutants of ERRbeta. ERRbeta coordinates expression of multiple genes that are rate-limiting regulators of ATP generation and consumption in photoreceptors. Furthermore, enhancing ERRbeta activity rescues photoreceptor defects that result from loss of the photoreceptor-specific transcription factor Crx. Our findings demonstrate that ERRbeta is a critical regulator of rod photoreceptor function and survival, and suggest that ERRbeta agonists may be useful in the treatment of certain <e>retinal</e> dystrophies.",M2
20517936,"Longitudinal study of vision and <e>retinal</e> nerve fiber layer thickness in multiple sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: Cross-sectional studies of optical coherence tomography (OCT) show that retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness is reduced in multiple sclerosis (MS) and correlates with visual function. We determined how longitudinal changes in RNFL thickness relate to visual loss. We also examined patterns of RNFL thinning over time in MS eyes with and without a prior history of acute optic neuritis (ON). METHODS: Patients underwent OCT measurement of RNFL thickness at baseline and at 6-month intervals during a mean follow-up of 18 months at 3 centers. Low-contrast letter acuity (2.5%, 1.25% contrast) and visual acuity (VA) were assessed. RESULTS: Among 299 patients (593 eyes) with &gt;or=6 months follow-up, eyes with visual loss showed greater RNFL thinning compared to eyes with stable vision (low-contrast acuity, 2.5%: p &lt; 0.001; VA: p = 0.005). RNFL thinning increased over time, with average losses of 2.9microm at 2 to 3 years and 6.1microm at 3 to 4.5 years (p &lt; 0.001 vs 0.5-1-year follow-up interval). These patterns were observed for eyes with or without prior history of ON. Proportions of eyes with RNFL loss greater than test-retest variability (&gt;or=6.6microm) increased from 11% at 0 to 1 year to 44% at 3 to 4.5 years (p &lt; 0.001). INTERPRETATION: Progressive RNFL thinning occurs as a function of time in some patients with MS, even in the absence of ON, and is associated with clinically significant visual loss. These findings are consistent with subclinical axonal loss in the anterior visual pathway in MS, and support the use of OCT and low-contrast acuity as methods to evaluate the effectiveness of putative neuroprotection protocols.",M2

DESIGN: Interventional case series. METHODS: Retrospective evaluation of 10 eyes with newly diagnosed DME that underwent barely visible Pascal photocoagulation using an array of 10-microm, 10-millisecond photocoagulation burns. FD OCT and camera-based AF was performed at baseline and at 1 hour, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after laser. Changes in <e>retinal</e> thickening after laser treatment were measured using retinal thickness maps within the treated sector and the central foveal subfield. RESULTS: At 1 hour after treatment, burns were visualized partially with clinical biomicroscopy. AF demonstrated spots lacking autofluorescence that confirmed effective laser uptake within the Pascal arrays. Sequential changes in hyperreflectivity on FD OCT correlated with morphologic alterations seen on AF. Burns became increasingly hyperautofluorescent between 2 and 4 weeks. There were significant reductions in the retinal thickness within treated sectors on FD OCT at 2 weeks (26 +/- 32 microm; P = .012) and 3 months after laser (20 +/- 21 microm; P = .02) compared with baseline. Clinical biomicroscopic reduction of DME was the most common finding in 80%. CONCLUSIONS: Barely visible 10-millisecond Pascal laser seems to produce an effect at the level of the inner and outer photoreceptor segments and apical retinal pigment epithelium, with minimal axial and lateral spread of burns. FD OCT confirmed spatial localization of AF signal changes that correlated with laser burn-tissue interactions over 3 months. The technique of lower-fluence barely visible 10-millisecond laser may reduce retinal edema within affected sectors and effectively treat DME with minimization of scar formation.",M2

The following maneuver has been performed in two cases. After reducing the PFC bubble volume to the level of the border of the flap, the tip of the same perfluorocarbon injection cannula is used to capture the inverted retinal flap with gentle suction. The flap is lifted and brought centripetally to  cover  the PFC bubble and then released by stopping suction.

We show that knocking down the calmodulin-activated adenylate cyclase ADCY8 makes retinal axons insensitive to SDF1. Experiments in vivo using male and female zebrafish (Danio rerio) confirm a mutual antagonism between slit signaling and ADCY8-mediated signaling. Unexpectedly, knockdown of ADCY8 or another calmodulin-activated cyclase, ADCY1, induces ipsilateral misprojections of retinal axons that would normally cross the ventral midline. We demonstrate a cell-autonomous requirement for ADCY8 in retinal neurons for normal midline crossing. These findings are the first to show that ADCY8 is required for axonal pathfinding before axons reach their targets. They support a model in which ADCY8 is an essential component of a signaling pathway that opposes repellent signaling.

20505081,"Dendritic calcium signaling in ON and OFF mouse <e>retinal</e> ganglion cells.Retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) are the output cells of the retina; they convert synaptic input into spike output that carries visual information to the brain. Synaptic inputs are received, integrated and communicated to the spike initiation zone of the axon by dendrites whose properties are poorly understood. Here simultaneous patch-clamp recording and 2-photon Ca(2+) imaging are used to study voltage- and light-evoked Ca(2+) signals in the dendrites of identified types of mouse RGCs from parallel ON and OFF pathways, which encode the onset and offset of light, respectively. The results show pathway-specific differences in voltage-dependent Ca(2+) signaling. While both ON and OFF cells express high-voltage-activated (HVA) Ca(2+) channels, only OFF RGCs also express low-voltage-activated (LVA) Ca(2+) channels. LVA Ca(2+) channels in OFF cells are deinactivated by hyperpolarization from the resting potential and give rise to rebound excited Ca(2+) spikes at the termination of a step of either hyperpolarizing current or light. This suggests that the differential expression of voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels in ON and OFF RGC dendrites contributes to differences in the way the two cell types process visual stimuli.",M2
20504962,"The zebrafish flotte lotte mutant reveals that the local <e>retinal</e> environment promotes the differentiation of proliferating precursors emerging from their stem cell niche.It is currently unclear how intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms cooperate to control the progression from self-renewing to neurogenic divisions in retinal precursor cells. Here, we use the zebrafish flotte lotte (flo) mutant, which carries a mutation in the elys (ahctf1) gene, to study the relationship between cell cycle progression and neuronal differentiation by investigating how proliferating progenitor cells transition towards differentiation in a retinal stem cell niche termed the ciliary marginal zone (CMZ). In zebrafish embryos without Elys, CMZ cells retain the capacity to proliferate but lose the ability to enter their final neurogenic divisions to differentiate as neurons. However, mosaic retinae composed of wild-type and flo cells show that despite inherent cell cycle defects, flo mutant cells progress from proliferation to differentiation when in the vicinity of wild-type retinal neurons. We propose that the differentiated retinal environment limits the proliferation of precursors emerging from the CMZ in a manner that explains the spatial organisation of cells in the CMZ and ensures that proliferative retinal progenitors are driven towards differentiation.",M2
20471354,"Distinct contributions of rod, cone, and melanopsin photoreceptors to encoding irradiance.Photoreceptive, melanopsin-expressing <e>retinal</e> ganglion cells (mRGCs) encode ambient light (irradiance) for the circadian clock, the pupillomotor system, and other influential behavioral/physiological responses. mRGCs are activated both by their intrinsic phototransduction cascade and by the rods and cones. However, the individual contribution of each photoreceptor class to irradiance responses remains unclear. We address this deficit using mice expressing human red cone opsin, in which rod-, cone-, and melanopsin-dependent responses can be identified by their distinct spectral sensitivity. Our data reveal an unexpectedly important role for rods. These photoreceptors define circadian responses at very dim  scotopic  light levels but also at irradiances at which pattern vision relies heavily on cones. By contrast, cone input to irradiance responses dissipates following light adaptation to the extent that these receptors make a very limited contribution to circadian and pupillary light responses under these conditions. Our data provide new insight into retinal circuitry upstream of mRGCs and optimal stimuli for eliciting irradiance responses.",M2

Although Blimp1 expression in developing retinal photoreceptor cells has been reported, its function remains unclear. We identified Blimp1 as a downstream factor of Otx2, which plays an essential role in photoreceptor cell fate determination. To investigate Blimp1 function in the mouse retina, we ablated Blimp1 in the developing retina by conditional gene targeting. In the Blimp1 conditional knockout (CKO) retina, the number of photoreceptor cells was markedly reduced in the differentiated retina. We found that the numbers of both bipolar-like cells and proliferating retinal cells increased noticeably, with ectopic localizations in the postnatal developing retina. In contrast, a reduction of the number of photoreceptor precursors was observed during development. Forced expression of Blimp1 by in vivo electroporation suppressed bipolar cell genesis in the developing retina. Multiple genes involved in bipolar development, including Chx10, were upregulated in the Blimp1 CKO retina. Furthermore, we showed that Blimp1 can bind to the Chx10 enhancer and repress Chx10 enhancer activity. These results suggest that Blimp1 plays a crucial role in photoreceptor development by repressing genes involved in bipolar cell fate specification and retinal cell proliferation in differentiating photoreceptor precursors.",M2

In the retina of Epo-green fluorescent protein transgenic mice, Epo-expressing cells were identified and found to be distributed in the retinal ganglion cell layer. Treatment of retinal wholemount cultures with recombinant Epo resulted in a significant decrease of apoptotic ganglion cells as well as photoreceptor cells throughout retinal development. Moreover, transforming growth factor-beta-induced apoptosis was completely antagonized by Epo when both factors were simultaneously applied. Investigations on the signaling pathway revealed a decrease in Bax mRNA levels in Epo-treated retinal cells. We conclude that Epo exerts wide and prolonged neuroprotective activity in physiologically occurring apoptosis and thus contributes to proper retinal development.",M2
20459797,"The long noncoding RNA RNCR2 directs mouse <e>retinal</e> cell specification.BACKGROUND: Recent work has identified that many long mRNA-like noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are expressed in the developing nervous system. Despite their abundance, the function of these ncRNAs has remained largely unexplored. We have investigated the highly abundant lncRNA RNCR2 in regulation of mouse retinal cell differentiation. RESULTS: We find that the RNCR2 is selectively expressed in a subset of both mitotic progenitors and postmitotic retinal precursor cells. ShRNA-mediated knockdown of RNCR2 results in an increase of both amacrine cells and Müller glia, indicating a role for this lncRNA in regulating retinal cell fate specification. We further report that RNCR2 RNA, which is normally nuclear-retained, can be exported from the nucleus when fused to an IRES-GFP sequence. Overexpression of RNCR2-IRES-GFP phenocopies the effects of shRNA-mediated knockdown of RNCR2, implying that forced mislocalization of RNCR2 induces a dominant-negative phenotype. Finally, we use the IRES-GFP fusion approach to identify specific domains of RNCR2 that are required for repressing both amacrine and Müller glial differentiation. CONCLUSION: These data demonstrate that the lncRNA RNCR2 plays a critical role in regulating mammalian retinal cell fate specification. Furthermore, we present a novel approach for generating dominant-negative constructs of lncRNAs, which may be generally useful in the functional analysis of this class of molecules.",M2
20457972,"Single-session vs multiple-session pattern scanning laser panretinal photocoagulation in proliferative diabetic retinopathy: The Manchester Pascal Study.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of pattern scanning laser (Pascal; OptiMedica, Santa Clara, California) multispot panretinal photocoagulation given in a single-session (SS-PRP) vs single-spot multiple-session PRP (MS-PRP) on proliferative diabetic retinopathy (PDR). METHODS: Single-center, randomized clinical trial of 40 eyes. Proliferative diabetic retinopathy was treated with a 400-mum spot size in 1500 burns given either as Pascal in 20-millisecond SS-PRP or in 3 sessions (100-millisecond MS-PRP) during a 4-week period. Visual acuity, central subfield <e>retinal</e> thickness (CRT), and 24-2 Swedish interactive thresholding algorithm visual fields were recorded at baseline and 4 and 12 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Central subfield retinal thickness, mean deviation, and PDR grade at 12 weeks. RESULTS: There was a significant increase in mean CRT with MS-PRP (22 mum at 4 weeks, 95% CI, -32.25 to -10.75; 20 mum at 12 weeks, 95% CI, -28.75 to -10.82; P &lt; .001) and no significant increase in the SS-PRP group. The mean deviation increased significantly in the SS-PRP group after 4 weeks (0.73 dB, P = .048), with no significant changes in either group at other points. A positive effect on PDR was observed in 74% of eyes in the SS-PRP group vs 53% in the MS-PRP group (P = .31). Mean treatment time for SS-PRP was 5.04 minutes (SD, 1.5 minutes) compared with 59.3 (SD, 12.7 minutes) in the MS-PRP group (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: There were no adverse outcomes (CRT, visual acuity, or visual field) from using multispot SS-PRP vs single-spot MS-PRP at 12 weeks postlaser, and treatment times were significantly shorter for multispot SS-PRP. Pascal SS-PRP was as effective as MS-PRP in the treatment of PDR. APPLICATION TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Twenty-millisecond Pascal SS-PRP may be safely and rapidly performed in 1500 burns with a similar efficacy to conventional MS-PRP.

20451172,"A splice-site mutation in a retina-specific exon of BBS8 causes nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa.Tissue-specific alternative splicing is an important mechanism for providing spatiotemporal protein diversity. Here we show that an in-frame splice mutation in BBS8, one of the genes involved in pleiotropic Bardet-Biedl syndrome (BBS), is sufficient to cause nonsyndromic retinitis pigmentosa (RP). A genome-wide scan of a consanguineous RP pedigree mapped the trait to a 5.6 Mb region; subsequent systematic sequencing of candidate transcripts identified a homozygous splice-site mutation in a previously unknown BBS8 exon. The allele segregated with the disorder, was absent from controls, was completely invariant across evolution, and was predicted to lead to the elimination of a 10 amino acid sequence from the protein. Subsequent studies showed the exon to be expressed exclusively in the retina and enriched significantly in the photoreceptor layer. Importantly, we found this exon to represent the major BBS8 mRNA species in the mammalian photoreceptor, suggesting that the encoded 10 amino acids play a pivotal role in the function of BBS8 in this organ. Understanding the role of this additional sequence might therefore inform the mechanism of <e>retinal</e> degeneration in patients with syndromic BBS or other related ciliopathies.",M2
20421569,"Evaluating loss of visual function in multiple sclerosis as measured by low-contrast letter acuity.BACKGROUND: Disturbances in visual function are common in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and are often accompanied by substantial impairments in daily functioning and quality of life. Lesions associated with these impairments frequently involve the afferent visual pathway. EXPERT CLINICAL OPINION: Because these impairments are often not readily apparent on commonly used high-contrast acuity tests, low-contrast charts (e.g., low-contrast Sloan letter charts) have gained validity in the assessment of visual dysfunction in patients with MS. Decrements in low-contrast letter acuity are associated with MS and correlate with increasing disability, MRI abnormalities, and reduced <e>retinal</e> nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness as measured by optical coherence tomography (OCT). These findings suggest that low-contrast letter acuity testing is a potentially useful addition to disability scales such as the Multiple Sclerosis Functional Composite, serving as another surrogate marker for MS disability. Assessment of RNFL thickness by OCT, which is also associated with visual impairment, also may be considered for inclusion in clinical trials evaluating treatments for MS. FUTURE DIRECTIONS: The effects of disease-modifying therapies on visual dysfunction in patients with MS have been evaluated only recently. Two phase 3 studies of natalizumab showed that low-contrast letter acuity testing, included as an exploratory outcome, demonstrated treatment effects. Other ongoing studies have incorporated low-contrast acuity and OCT measures of RNFL thickness. The availability and wider use of low-contrast letter acuity tests, in combination with ocular imaging techniques, may improve assessment of treatment efficacy in patients with MS.",M2
20424226,"Resveratrol inhibits neuronal apoptosis and elevated Ca2+/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II activity in diabetic mouse retina.OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the effects of resveratrol, a natural polyphenol with neuroprotective properties, on <e>retinal</e> neuronal cell death mediated by diabetes-induced activation of Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMKII). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Diabetes was induced in C57BL/6 mice by five consecutive intraperitoneal injections of 55 mg/kg streptozotocin (STZ). Control mice received buffer. All mice were killed 2 months after the injections, and the extent of neuronal cell death, CaMKII, and phospho-CaMKII protein expression levels and CaMKII kinase activity were examined in the retinas. To assess the role of CaMKII in the death of retinal neurons, a small-interfering RNA (siRNA) or specific inhibitor of CaMKII was injected into the right vitreous humor, and vehicle only was injected into the left vitreous humor, 2 days before death. Resveratrol (20 mg/kg) was administered by oral gavage daily for 4 weeks, beginning 1 month after the fifth injection of either STZ or buffer. RESULTS: The death of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs), CaMKII, phospho-CaMKII protein levels, and CaMKII activity were all greatly increased in the retinas of diabetic mice compared with controls, 2 months after induction of diabetes. Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL)-positive signals co-localized with CaMKII- and phospho-CaMKII immunoreactive RGCs. However, in addition to CaMKII knockdown and inhibition by siRNA or a specific inhibitor, respectively, resveratrol provided complete protection from diabetes-induced retinal cell death. CONCLUSIONS: In the present study, resveratrol prevented diabetes-induced RGC death via CaMKII downregulation, implying that resveratrol may have potential therapeutic applications for prevention of diabetes-induced visual dysfunction.",M2
20422825,"Early ultrasonographic diagnosis of <e>retinal</e> detachment: multidisciplinary approach and benefit.Patients with eye problems are often present in family medicine and emergency wards, whether it is isolated disturbances of vision, or as part of other diseases. A large number of pathological entities of the eye require prompt and accurate diagnosis and appropriate therapy before they get to specialized ophthalmological institutions. Ultrasonography of the eye is a simple, non-invasive, painless method that can be done at the first contact with patients and can provide very important information for accurate diagnosis of pathological changes. Early detection of retinal ablation, intra ocular bleeding and tumors by this method can save sight and lives of patients. Sonography of the eye in 667 patients over two years revealed 27 retinal ablation and hemophthalmos in 36 patients. Every fifth patient with retinal ablation was referred by a doctor of family medicine. Knowing the possibilities of ultrasonography in ophthalmology, teamwork at the level of primary health care can open access to ultrasonography of the eye for other specialty physicians which can improve population health and provide a new quality in the prevention of vision loss.",M2
20418777,"Expression of hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase enzyme in the human central nervous system and in pineal parenchymal cell tumors.Pineal parenchymal tumor (PPT) cells usually show immunoreactivity for synaptophysin, neuron-specific enolase, neurofilament protein, class III beta-tubulin, tau protein, PGP9.5, chromogranin, serotonin, <e>retinal</e> S-antigen, and rhodopsin, but these markers are not specific for PPTs. Melatonin is produced and secreted mainly bypineal parenchymal cells; hydroxyindole-O-methyltransferase (HIOMT) catalyzes the final reaction in melatonin biosynthesis. We hypothesized that HIOMT could serve as a tumor marker of PPTs, and we investigated HIOMT localization and HIOMT expression in samples of normal human tissue and in PPTs, primitive neuroectodermal tumors, and medulloblastomas. In normal tissue, HIOMT was expressed in retinal cells, pineal parenchymal cells, neurons of the Edinger-Westphal nucleus, microglia, macrophages, thyroid follicular epithelium, principal and oxyphil cells of parathyroid gland, adrenal cortical cells, hepatic parenchymal cells, renal tubule epithelium, and enteroendocrine cells of stomach and duodenum. The HIOMT was also expressed in all 46 PPTs studied. The proportions of HIOMT-immunoreactive cells successively decreased in the following tumors: pineocytoma, pineal parenchymal tumor of intermediate differentiation, and pineoblastoma. A few HIOMT-immunoreactive cells were observed in one of 6 primitive neuroectodermal tumors and 23 of 42 medulloblastomas. These results indicate that HIOMT immunohistochemistry may be useful for the diagnosis of PPTs and be a prognostic factor in PPTs.",M2
20410241,"Simultaneous determination of multiple mRNA levels utilizing MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry and biotinylated dideoxynucleotides.Here we report an efficient method to simultaneously measure multiple mRNA levels utilizing mass spectrometry (MS) and molecular affinity isolation. In this approach, reverse transcription products of a group of mRNAs are subjected to competitive PCR with competitors and internal standards of known concentrations, and the PCR products are differentiated and quantified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) MS to determine the mRNA levels. The method provides high accuracy in quantitative MS analysis due to the facilitated purification of oligonucleotides by molecular affinity isolation. Additionally, owing to the molecular affinity isolation, only those oligonucleotides required for expression level determination are introduced into the mass spectrometer, while other irrelevant reaction components that could overlap with peaks of gene transcripts or competitors are removed prior to MS analysis. Thus the approach enhances the parallel analysis of multiple gene transcripts by MS. Utilizing the method we have simultaneously measured mRNA levels of four genes (Rho, Nrl, Hprt, and Lhx2) in mouse <e>retinal</e> tissue.",M2
20410146,"Ocular pathology in multiple sclerosis: <e>retinal</e> atrophy and inflammation irrespective of disease duration.There has been growing interest in the use of retinal imaging for tracking disease progression in multiple sclerosis. However, systematic and detailed pathological descriptions of retinal tissue in multiple sclerosis are lacking. Graded, histological evaluations on eyes from 82 patients with multiple sclerosis and 10 subjects with other neurological diseases, with immunohistochemistry on a subset, were performed and correlated with clinical and pathological findings. Multiple sclerosis cases demonstrated evidence of retinal atrophy and inflammation even in late-stage disease. Retinal ganglion cell loss was significant and remaining neurons appeared shrunken and were partially engulfed by human leukocyte antigen-DR positive cells with the phenotype of microglia in samples subjected to immunohistochemistry. Neurofilament staining revealed variable but prominent degrees of axonal loss and injury. Neuronal loss was noted in the inner nuclear layer with focal reduction in cell density. Foamy-appearing human leukocyte antigen-DR positive cells were evident near vessels and periphlebitis was found in a small but significant number of multiple sclerosis cases. Glial fibrillary acidic protein staining showed extensive astrocyte hypertrophy and proliferation with prominent gliosis in multiple sclerosis cases. Frequent but previously unreported abnormalities in the iris were documented in the majority of chronic multiple sclerosis cases. The injury to both iris and retina could be seen at all stages of disease. Severity of retinal atrophy was correlated with overall brain weight at time of autopsy (P = 0.04) and a trend for increased atrophy was seen with longer disease duration (P = 0.13). This study provides the first large-scale pathological description of retinas in multiple sclerosis, including patients with different subtypes of disease at all stages, and with variable clinical severity. Changes were seen not only in the retinal nerve fibre layer and ganglion cell layer, but also in the inner nuclear layer, suggesting that retinal injury is more widespread than previously appreciated. Furthermore, the human retina is devoid of myelin, but inflammation was demonstrated to be prominent in multiple sclerosis and to persist in the retina at late stages of disease. The prominent gliosis and inflammation surrounding vessels of the inner retina could potentially impact optical coherence tomography evaluations in multiple sclerosis-as standard techniques exploit presumed differences in tissue reflectivity and utilize automated edge detection algorithms to judge axon loss in the nerve fibre layer. Deciphering the relationships between the different types of retinal pathology may aid us in understanding the factors that drive both inflammation and tissue atrophy in multiple sclerosis.",M2
20410107,"The ON pathway rectifies the OFF pathway of the mammalian retina.In the vertebrate visual system, ON cells respond to positive contrasts and OFF cells respond to negative contrasts, and thus both ON and OFF cells exhibit rectification. We investigated the <e>retinal</e> circuits by which the ON pathway rectifies the OFF pathway. White noise was projected onto an in vitro preparation of the mammalian retina and excitatory currents were recorded from retinal ganglion cells under whole-cell voltage clamp. Currents in OFF cells were more rectified than those in ON cells: thus, currents in ON cells were able to signal both positive and negative contrasts, but currents in OFF cells were virtually restricted to negative contrasts. Blocking signals in the ON pathway derectified currents in OFF ganglion cells, thus allowing them to be modulated by positive contrasts, indicating that the ON pathway normally rectifies currents in OFF ganglion cells. Such cross-rectification from ON to OFF pathways required intact glycinergic inhibition, indicating that a glycinergic amacrine cell, most likely the AII amacrine cell, allows the ON bipolar cell to hyperpolarize the OFF bipolar cell close to the threshold for transmitter release, thus rectifying excitatory currents in the OFF ganglion cell. Asymmetrical rectification of ON and OFF cells may be an adaptation to natural scenes that have more contrast levels below the mean than above. Thus, in order for ON and OFF pathways to encode an equal number of contrast levels, the ON cells must signal some negative contrasts.",M2
20408179,"Expression and function of iron-regulatory proteins in retina.Iron is essential for cell survival and function; yet excess iron is toxic to cells. Therefore, the cellular and whole-body levels of iron are regulated exquisitely. At least a dozen proteins participate in the regulation of iron homeostasis. Hemochromatosis, a genetic disorder of iron overload, is caused by mutations in at least five genes, namely HFE, hemojuvelin, Transferrin receptor 2, ferroportin, and hepcidin. Retina is separated from systemic circulation by inner and outer blood-<e>retinal</e> barriers; therefore it is widely believed that this tissue is immune to changes in systemic circulation. Even though hemochromatosis is associated with iron overload and dysfunction of a variety of systemic organs, little is known on the effects of this disease on the retina. Recent studies have shown that all five genes that are associated with hemochromatosis are expressed in the retina in a cell type-specific manner. The retinal pigment epithelium, which forms the outer blood-retinal barrier, expresses all of these five genes. It is therefore clearly evident that iron homeostasis in the retina is maintained locally by active participation of various iron-regulatory proteins. Excess iron is detrimental to the retina as evidenced from human studies and from mouse models of iron overload. Retinal iron homeostasis is disrupted in various clinical conditions such as hemochromatosis, aceruloplasminemia, age-related macular degeneration, and bacterial and viral infections.",M2
20404157,"Palmitoylation stabilizes unliganded rod opsin.S-palmitoylation is a conserved feature in many G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) involved in a broad array of signaling processes. The prototypical GPCR, rhodopsin, is S-palmitoylated on two adjacent C-terminal Cys residues at its cytoplasmic surface. Surprisingly, absence of palmitoylation has only a modest effect on in vitro or in vivo signaling. Here, we report that palmitoylation-deficient (Palm(-/-)) mice carrying two Cys to Thr and Ser mutations in the opsin gene displayed profound light-induced <e>retinal</e> degeneration that first involved rod and then cone cells. After brief bright light exposure, their retinas exhibited two types of deposits containing nucleic acid and invasive phagocytic macrophages. When Palm(-/-) mice were crossed with Lrat(-/-) mice lacking lecithin:retinol acyl transferase to eliminate retinoid binding to opsin and thereby rendering the eye insensitive to light, rapid retinal degeneration occurred even in 3- to 4-week-old animals. This rapid degeneration suggests that nonpalmitoylated rod opsin is unstable. Treatment of 2-week-old Palm(-/-)Lrat(-/-) mice with an artificial chromophore precursor prevented this retinopathy. In contrast, elimination of signaling to G protein in Palm(-/-)Gnat1(-/-) mice had no effect, indicating that instability of unpalmitoylated opsin lacking chromophore rather than aberrant signal transduction resulted in retinal pathology. Together, these observations provide evidence for a structural role of rhodopsin S-palmitoylation that may apply to other GPCRs as well.",M2
20399206,"Granulocyte colony-stimulating factor facilitates recovery of <e>retinal</e> function following retinal ischemic injury.The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether systemically administered granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) can protect against acute ischemic reperfusion injury. Two groups of anesthetized adult male Lewis rats (n = 8 per group) were subjected to an acute (45 min) episode of retinal ischemic injury followed by subcutaneous administration of vehicle (5% dextrose) or G-CSF (0.1 mg/kg/day) once per day x 5 days. Prior to and one week following ischemic insult, retinal function was measured by scotopic electroretinography (ERG). Retinas were harvested and morphologically analyzed one week after ischemic insult. ERG a- and b-wave amplitudes were significantly reduced following ischemic reperfusion injury. G-CSF treatment attenuated ischemic-induced loss of retinal function. In control vehicle-treated rats, ischemic reperfusion injury elicited marked and selective thinning of inner retinal layers while only minimally affecting outer retinal layers. Therapeutically administered G-CSF minimized ischemic-mediated thinning of whole retina and inner retinal layers. G-CSF may be of therapeutic interest for the management of retinal ischemic disorders.",M2
20398884,"Mutations in C2ORF71 cause autosomal-recessive retinitis pigmentosa.With a worldwide prevalence of 1 in 4,000, retinitis pigmentosa (RP) is the most common form of hereditary <e>retinal</e> degeneration. More than 30 genes and loci have been implicated in nonsyndromic autosomal-recessive (ar) RP. Genome-wide homozygosity mapping was conducted in one Dutch and one Israeli family affected by arRP. The families were found to share a 5.9 Mb homozygous region on chromosome 2p23.1-p23.3. A missense variant in one of the genes residing in this interval, C2ORF71, has recently been reported to be associated with RP. C2ORF71, encoding a putative protein of 1,288 amino acids, was found to be specifically expressed in human retina. Furthermore, RT-PCR analysis revealed that in the mouse eye, C2orf71 is expressed as early as embryonic day 14. Mutation analysis detected a 1 bp deletion (c.946 del; p.Asn237MetfsX5) segregating with RP in the Dutch family, whereas a nonsense mutation (c.556C &gt; T; p.Gln186X) was identified in the Israeli family. Microsatellite-marker analysis in additional Israeli families revealed cosegregation of a C2ORF71-linked haplotype in one other family, in which a 13 bp deletion (c.2756_2768 del; p.Lys919ThrfsX) was identified. Clinically, patients with mutations in C2ORF71 show signs of typical RP; these signs include poor night vision and peripheral field loss, typical retinal bone-spicule-type pigment deposits, pale appearance of the optic disk, and markedly reduced or completely extinguished electroretinograms. In conclusion, truncating mutations in C2ORF71 were identified in three unrelated families, thereby confirming the involvement of this gene in the etiology of arRP.",M2
20398654,"Development of a novel instrument to measure the pulsatile movement of ocular tissues.We demonstrate an optical instrument that can measure the axial displacement of different eye tissues, including the cornea and the fundus.

Longitudinal <e>retinal</e> and corneal movements were successfully measured in vivo in live rats, and Fourier analysis of the signal revealed the signature of the respiratory and cardiac cycles at 1.0 and 3.5 Hz, respectively. The effective amplitudes of retinal and corneal displacements at the cardiac frequency were found to be about 1.10 and 1.37 mum, respectively. The synchrony and direction of these two movements relative to the systole and diastole were found to be nearly the same. This novel instrument can be applied to assess biomechanical properties of the eye, which could be important for early diagnosis and for understanding the pathophysiology of glaucoma and other ocular diseases.",M2
20398652,"S-opsin protein is incompletely modified during N-glycan processing in Rpe65(-/-) mice.<e>Retinal</e> pigment epithelium-specific protein 65 kDa (RPE65) is a key enzyme for the visual cycle in the eye. Rpe65(-/-) mice lack 11-cis-retinal, and show early cone degeneration and mislocalization of cone opsins. The present study investigated whether abnormal modification of cone opsins at the protein level is present in Rpe65(-/-) mice. Retina-RPE-choroids of Rpe65(-/-) mice at 3, 5 and 7 weeks old were used. Immunohistochemistry of opsins was performed using cryosections and retinal flatmounts. We evaluated levels of mRNA for cone and rod opsin genes by RT-PCR and levels of proteins by western blotting. To examine modification patterns of N-glycan in Rpe65(-/-) mice, cone opsins were digested with peptide-N-glycosidase (PNGase) F. S-opsin protein was detected at approximately 40-kDa as a major band in wild-type mice, whereas approximately 42-kDa S-opsin protein was detected in Rpe65(-/-) mice. After PNGase F treatment, mobility of S-opsin protein in wild-type and Rpe65(-/-) mice on SDS-PAGE was similar. In addition, approximately 25-kDa S-opsin polypeptide was notably detected in Rpe65(-/-) mice. Conversely, M-opsin proteins were not observed by immunohistochemistry or western blotting in Rpe65(-/-) mice, but expression of M-opsin mRNA in Rpe65(-/-) mice did not differ significantly from that in wild-type mice at 3 and 5 weeks. Mobility of M-opsin protein in Rpe65(-/-) mice was unchanged. Our data suggest that S-opsin protein is incompletely modified during N-glycan processing in Rpe65(-/-) mice, whereas M-opsin protein is severely reduced by posttranslational degradation in the absence of incomplete N-glycan processing in Rpe65(-/-) mice.",M2
20396773,"Molecular genetic and immunophenotypical analysis of Pax6 transcription factor and neural differentiation markers in human fetal neocortex and retina in vivo and in vitro.Neurotransplantation of various cells, including heterotransplantation of fetal cerebral stem/progenitor cells into the eye is used in experimental studies of central nervous tissue repair during neurodegeneration. For evaluation of this approach, human fetal (weeks 9-20) stem/progenitor cells of the neocortex and retina were studied in vivo and in vitro by quantitative PCR and immunohistochemical staining. Native tissues and cultures were characterized by expression of Pax6 transcription factor (critical for the development of the retina and neocortex) and differentiation markers (nestin, betaIII-tubulin, glial fibrillary acidic protein, recoverin, NeuN, neurofilaments, Ki-67). The expression of Pax6 gene in the retina during active neurogenesis was stable and much higher than in the neocortex. In primary cultures, the pattern of Pax6 gene expression is retained and repeats that in native tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed similarity of nestin and betaIII-tubulin expression in the neocortex and retina during the early (9-10 weeks) and later (20 weeks) periods and differences in cell phenotypes and their distribution. Culture studies showed that neocortical and <e>retinal</e> stem/progenitor cells are determined and exhibit specific differentiation characteristic of the corresponding native tissues. It can be hypothesized that heterotransplantation of the cerebral progenitor cells into the retina of experimental animals can lead to realization of their neurotrophic effect, but not to their functional integration.",M2
20394057,"Synaptic input of ON-bipolar cells onto the dopaminergic neurons of the mouse retina.In the retina, dopamine fulfills a crucial role in neural adaptation to photopic illumination, but the pathway that carries cone signals to the dopaminergic amacrine (DA) cells was controversial. We identified the site of ON-cone bipolar input onto DA cells in transgenic mice in which both types of catecholaminergic amacrine (CA) cells were labeled with green fluorescent protein or human placental alkaline phosphatase (PLAP). In confocal Z series of <e>retinal</e> whole mounts stained with antibodies to tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), DA cells gave rise to varicose processes that descended obliquely through the scleral half of the inner plexiform layer (IPL) and formed a loose, tangential plexus in the middle of this layer. Comparison with the distribution of the dendrites of type 2 CA cells and examination of neurobiotin-injected DA cells proved that their vitreal processes were situated in stratum S3 of the IPL. Electron microscope demonstration of PLAP activity showed that bipolar cell endings in S3 established ribbon synapses onto a postsynaptic dyad in which one or both processes were labeled by a precipitate of lead phosphate and therefore belonged to DA cells. In places, the postsynaptic DA cell processes returned a reciprocal synapse onto the bipolar endings. Confocal images of sections stained with antibodies to TH, kinesin Kif3a, which labels synaptic ribbons, and glutamate or GABA(A) receptors, confirmed that ribbon-containing endings made glutamatergic synapses onto DA cells processes in S3 and received from them GABAergic synapses. The presynaptic ON-bipolar cells most likely belonged to the CB3 (type 5) variety.",M2

AIMS: To study the association of various systemic risk factors with retinal hard exudates in type 2 diabetic north Indian patients and to measure the incidence of dyslipidemia in them. SETTINGS AND DESIGN: A tertiary-hospital-based cross-sectional study. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An observational case-study which included 180 type 2 diabetic patients (180 eyes) of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy (NPDR) with clinically significant macular edema (CSME). In these patients the retinal hard exudates were graded on a central 500 fundus picture using modified Airlie House classification and divided into three groups of absent or minimal hard exudates (Group 1), hard exudates present (Group 2) and prominent hard exudates (Group 3). Their association with various risk factors, namely the age of onset of diabetes and its duration, gender, insulin therapy, and various systemic parameters like hypertension, blood hemoglobin, glycosylated hemoglobin, serum (s.) creatinine levels, 24-h proteinuria and complete lipid profile including total s. cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL), very low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (VLDL) and s. triglyceride (TG) was studied. The incidence of dyslipidemia was also calculated among these groups of patients. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: ANOVA test, linear regression analysis and Spearman's correlation test. RESULTS: On univariate analysis, the retinal hard exudates were significantly associated with s. creatinine (P=0.016), systolic blood pressure (P=0.014), s. cholesterol (P &lt; 0.001), s. LDL (P=0.008) and s. TG (P=0.013) levels. While on linear regression analysis, s. cholesterol (P &lt; 0.001) and s. LDL cholesterol (P=0.028) were found to be independent risk factors affecting the density of retinal hard exudates. On Spearman's correlation test, the retinal hard exudates showed a significant positive correlation with systolic blood pressure (P=0.019), s. cholesterol (P &lt; 0.001), LDL (P=0.002) and TG (P=0.014) levels. The incidence of dyslipidemia varied from as high as nearly 70% among patients of Group 3 compared to as low as 18% among Group 1 patients. CONCLUSION: Serum cholesterol and LDL are independent risk factors for retinal hard exudates in type 2 diabetic north Indian patients who suffer from a remarkably high incidence of dyslipidemia.",M2
20389502,"Fast dispersion encoded full range optical coherence tomography for <e>retinal</e> imaging at 800 nm and 1060 nm.The dispersion mismatch between sample and reference arm in frequency-domain optical coherence tomography (OCT) can be used to iteratively suppress complex conjugate artifacts and thereby increase the imaging range. In this paper, we propose a fast dispersion encoded full range (DEFR) algorithm that detects multiple signal components per iteration. The influence of different dispersion levels on the reconstruction quality is analyzed experimentally using a multilayered scattering phantom and in vivo retinal tomograms at 800 nm. Best results have been achieved with 30 mm SF11, with neglectable resolution decrease due to finite resolution of the spectrometer. Our fast DEFR algorithm achieves an average suppression ratio of 55 dB and typically converges within 5 to 10 iterations. The processing time on non-dedicated hardware was 5 to 10 seconds for tomograms with 512 depth scans and 4096 sampling points per depth scan. Application of DEFR to the more challenging 1060 nm wavelength region is also demonstrated by introducing an additional optical fibre in the sample arm.",M2
20389409,"Photoacoustic ophthalmoscopy for in vivo <e>retinal</e> imaging.We have developed a non-invasive photoacoustic ophthalmoscopy (PAOM) for in vivo retinal imaging. PAOM detects the photoacoustic signal induced by pulsed laser light shined onto the retina. By using a stationary ultrasonic transducer in contact with the eyelids and scanning only the laser light across the retina, PAOM provides volumetric imaging of the retinal micro-vasculature and retinal pigment epithelium at a high speed. For B-scan frames containing 256 A-lines, the current PAOM has a frame rate of 93 Hz, which is comparable with state-of-the-art commercial spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). By integrating PAOM with SD-OCT, we further achieved OCT-guided PAOM, which can provide multi-modal retinal imaging simultaneously. The capabilities of this novel technology were demonstrated by imaging both the microanatomy and microvasculature of the rat retina in vivo.",M2
20388654,"von Hippel-Lindau protein regulates transition from the fetal to the adult circulatory system in retina.In early neonates, the fetal circulatory system undergoes dramatic transition to the adult circulatory system. Normally, embryonic connecting vessels, such as the ductus arteriosus and the foramen ovale, close and regress. In the neonatal retina, hyaloid vessels maintaining blood flow in the embryonic retina regress, and <e>retinal</e> vessels take over to form the adult-type circulatory system. This process is regulated by a programmed cell death switch mediated by macrophages via Wnt and angiopoietin 2 pathways. In this study, we seek other mechanisms that regulate this process, and focus on the dramatic change in oxygen environment at the point of birth. The von Hippel-Lindau tumor suppressor protein (pVHL) is a substrate recognition component of an E3-ubiquitin ligase that rapidly destabilizes hypoxia-inducible factor alphas (HIF-alphas) under normoxic, but not hypoxic, conditions. To examine the role of oxygen-sensing mechanisms in retinal circulatory system transition, we generated retina-specific conditional-knockout mice for VHL (Vhl(alpha)(-CreKO) mice). These mice exhibit arrested transition from the fetal to the adult circulatory system, persistence of hyaloid vessels and poorly formed retinal vessels. These defects are suppressed by intraocular injection of FLT1-Fc protein [a vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) receptor-1 (FLT1)/Fc chimeric protein that can bind VEGF and inhibit its activity], or by inactivating the HIF-1alpha gene. Our results suggest that not only macrophages but also tissue oxygen-sensing mechanisms regulate the transition from the fetal to the adult circulatory system in the retina.",M2
20379461,"<e>Retinal</e> protective effects of resveratrol via modulation of nitric oxide synthase on oxygen-induced retinopathy.PURPOSE: Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is one of the leading causes of blindness, with retinal detachment occurring due to oxygen toxicity in preterm infants. Recently, advances in neonatal care have led to improved survival rates for preterm infants, and ROP has increased in incidence. In the present study, we aimed to determine whether or not resveratrol exhibits protective effects in an animal model of ROP and in primary retinal cell cultures of neonatal rat via nitric oxide (NO)-modulating actions using western blotting and real-time PCR with inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), endothelial NOS (eNOS) and neuronal NOS (nNOS) antibodies and mRNAs. METHODS: In an in vivo oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) model, cyclic hyperoxia was induced with 80% O(2) for one day and 21% O(2) for one day from P1 to P14 in newborn Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats. Resveratrol was injected intravitreally for seven days and rats were sacrificed at P21. In vitro OIR primary retinal cell culture was performed using P0-2 SD rats. Hyperoxia injuries were induced through 100% O(2) exposure for six hours. Western blotting and real-time PCR using iNOS, eNOS, nNOS antibodies and primers were performed in the rat model of ROP and the dispersed retinal cell culture. RESULTS: In both in vivo and in vitro OIR, the expression of iNOS antibody and mRNA was increased and of eNOS and nNOS were reduced in the resveratrol-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, resveratrol appeared to exert retinal protective effects via modulation of NO-mediated mechanism in in vivo and in vitro OIR models.",M2
20377621,"LINGO-1 negatively regulates TrkB phosphorylation after ocular hypertension.The antagonism of LINGO-1, a CNS-specific negative regulator of neuronal survival, was shown to promote short-term survival of <e>retinal</e> ganglion cell (RGC) in an ocular hypertension model. LINGO-1 antagonists, combined with brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), can increase the length of neuron survival through an unclear molecular mechanism. To determine the relationship between LINGO-1 and BDNF/TrkB receptor in neuronal protection, we show here that LINGO-1 forms a receptor complex with TrkB and negatively regulates its activation in the retina after ocular hypertension injury. LINGO-1 antagonist antibody 1A7 or soluble LINGO-1 (LINGO-1-Fc) treatment upregulates phospho-TrkB phosphorylation and leads to RGC survival after high intraocular pressure injury. This neuronal protective effect was blocked by anti-BDNF antibody. LINGO-1 antagonism therefore promotes RGC survival by regulating the BDNF and TrkB signaling pathway after ocular hypertension.",M2
20374282,"Glycine transport accounts for the differential role of glycine vs. D-serine at NMDA receptor coagonist sites in the salamander retina.In this study, we demonstrate that d-serine interacts with N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) coagonist sites of <e>retinal</e> ganglion cells of the tiger salamander retina by showing that exogenous d-serine overcomes the competitive antagonism of 7-chlorokynurenic acid for this site. Additionally, we show that exogenous d-serine was more than 30 times as effective at potentiating NMDAR currents compared with glycine. We thus examined the importance of glycine transport through the application of selective antagonists of the GlyT1 (NFPS) and GlyT2 (ALX-5670) transport systems, while simultaneously evaluating the degree of occupancy of the NMDAR coagonist binding sites. Analysis was carried out with electrophysiological recordings from the inner retina, including whole-cell recordings from retinal ganglion cells and extracellular recordings of the proximal negative field potential. Blocking the GlyT2 transport system had no effect on the light-evoked NMDAR currents or on the sensitivity of these currents to exogenous d-serine. In contrast, when the GlyT1 system was blocked, the coagonist sites of NMDARs showed full occupancy. These findings clearly establish the importance of the GlyT1 transporter as an essential component for maintaining the coagonist sites of NMDARs in a non-saturated state. The normal, unsaturated state of the NMDAR coagonist binding sites allows modulation of the NMDAR currents, by release of either d-serine or glycine. These results are discussed in light of contemporary findings which favor d-serine over glycine as the major coagonist of the NMDARs found in ganglion cells of the tiger salamander retina.",M2
20373900,"Effect of ZnCl2 and chelation of zinc ions by N,N-diethyldithiocarbamate (DEDTC) on the ERG b-wave amplitude from the isolated superfused vertebrate retina.PURPOSE: NiCl(2) (15 microM) enhances the ERG b-wave amplitude of vertebrate retina, up to 1.5-fold by blocking E/R-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels, which is mediated by blocking the release of GABA onto ionotropic GABA-A and GABA-C receptors. In vivo, it is likely that zinc, rather than nickel ions, may be involved in the modulation of <e>retinal</e> signalling. Therefore, we tested the effect of both, ZnCl(2) (10 to 500 microM) and DEDTC (100 to 500 microM), which chelates zinc ions for the capacity to influence the ERG b-wave amplitude. METHODS: Transretinal potentials from the isolated bovine retina were recorded as electroretinograms and Ca(2+) inward currents by patch-clamp recordings of stably Ca(v)2.3 transfected HEK-293 cells, yielding an IC(50) value of 5.3 microM for ZnCl(2). RESULTS: ZnCl(2) (10-15 microM) increased the b-wave amplitude by 1.52-fold +/- 0.12 (n = 6 retinas), which was partially reversible upon washout. The same 1.5-fold stimulation of the b-wave amplitude was reported recently for 15 microM NiCl(2). The superfusion of isolated retinas by DEDTC (100 microM) caused a transient decrease of the ERG b-wave amplitude (0.75-fold +/- 0.06; n = 4), suggesting that the co-secretion of Zn(2+) ions may occur under scotopic conditions. CONCLUSION: The stimulatory effect of ZnCl(2) on the ERG b-wave amplitude resembles the stimulatory effect of NiCl(2) and may be mediated rather by the NiCl(2)-sensitive, Ca(v)2.3 E-/R-type voltage-gated Ca(2+) channels than by NiCl(2)-sensitive T-type channels.",M2
20373885,"Effects of pegaptanib sodium on <e>retinal</e> function in isolated perfused vertebrate retina.PURPOSE: To evaluate the short-term toxic effects of pegaptanib sodium on retinal function. At present, intraocular anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) therapy is the primary choice of treatment for neovascular maculopathy. The isoform VEGF(165) is specifically inhibited by pegaptanib sodium. Therefore, since VEGF(165) has neuroprotective effects against apoptosis of neuronal cells, blockage of VEGF(165) by pegaptanib could induce retinal dysfunction. In the present study, we used an electrophysiological technique for testing retinal toxicity in order to evaluate the short-term toxic effects of pegaptanib sodium on retinal function in a model of isolated perfused vertebrate retina. METHODS: Isolated bovine retinas were perfused with an oxygenated, pre-incubated nutrient solution. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded as trans-retinal potentials using Ag/AgCl electrodes. Pegaptanib sodium (0.006, 0.06, or 0.2 mg/ml) and solvent carrier were added to the nutrient solution for 45 min. ERGs were monitored before, during, and after exposure. RESULTS: No significant reductions of b-wave (p = 0.357, p = 0.31, and p = 0.11, respectively) or a-wave (p = 0.189, p = 0.46, and p = 0.23, respectively) amplitudes were detected during application of pegaptanib (0.006, 0.06, or 0.2 mg/ml). The solvent carrier alone had no effect on ERG b- or a-waves (p = 0.98 and p = 0.42, respectively). During washout, ERG amplitudes of all test series remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that both pegaptanib sodium and its solvent carrier have good safety profiles. Intraocular application of 0.3 mg pegaptanib sodium induced no significant changes in ERGs in our ex vivo model and, thus, appears to be safe.",M2
20371817,"A common progenitor for <e>retinal</e> astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.Developing neural tissue undergoes a period of neurogenesis followed by a period of gliogenesis. The lineage relationships among glial cell types have not been defined for most areas of the nervous system. Here we use retroviruses to label clones of glial cells in the chick retina. We found that almost every clone had both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes. In addition, we discovered a novel glial cell type, with features intermediate between those of astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, which we have named the diacyte. Diacytes also share a progenitor cell with both astrocytes and oligodendrocytes.",M2
20371244,"A novel middle-wavelength opsin (M-opsin) null-mutation in the <e>retinal</e> cone dysfunction rat.The disease-causing gene which underlies a naturally occurring X-linked mutant cone dysfunction Sprague-Dawley rat model was investigated. Full-field electroretinogram (ERG) and simple sequence length polymorphism analyses were applied to 441-second filial generation rats that were derived from crossing a mutant rat and a Brown-Norway rat. After identifying a mutation mapping within the telomeric region of chromosome X, a candidate gene related to retinal cone function in this region was further screened using real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry and histological methods. The results showed that a G-to-T substitution at the splice acceptor site of intron 4 was present in the opsin 1, medium-wave sensitive (Opn1mw) gene, thereby causing down-regulated transcription and translation. These changes were consistent with abnormities seen in the ERG response. However, there was no significant histological change in the mutant rat retina. Therefore, we infer from this that the causative gene for the mutation is Opn1mw and consequently term this a middle-wavelength opsin cone dysfunction (MCD) rat model. The deficiency in vision of the MCD rat is similar to the color vision defects that occur in humans with a color vision defect but without recessive retinal degeneration. This rat model may be useful for understanding the mechanism that is responsible for color vision and for developing clinical therapies for several retinal dystrophies caused by cone opsin deficiencies.",M2
20368623,"Intraflagellar transport molecules in ciliary and nonciliary cells of the retina.The assembly and maintenance of cilia require intraflagellar transport (IFT), a process mediated by molecular motors and IFT particles. Although IFT is a focus of current intense research, the spatial distribution of individual IFT proteins remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed the subcellular localization of IFT proteins in <e>retinal</e> cells by high resolution immunofluorescence and immunoelectron microscopy. We report that IFT proteins are differentially localized in subcompartments of photoreceptor cilia and in defined periciliary target domains for cytoplasmic transport, where they are associated with transport vesicles. IFT20 is not in the IFT core complex in photoreceptor cilia but accompanies Golgi-based sorting and vesicle trafficking of ciliary cargo. Moreover, we identify a nonciliary IFT system containing a subset of IFT proteins in dendrites of retinal neurons. Collectively, we provide evidence to implicate the differential composition of IFT systems in cells with and without primary cilia, thereby supporting new functions for IFT beyond its well-established role in cilia.",M2
20368504,"RILLKKMPSV influences the vasculature, neurons and glia, and (pro)renin receptor expression in the retina.The (pro)renin receptor [(P)RR] is implicated in organ pathology. We examined the cellular location of the (P)RR and whether a putative (P)RR antagonist, RILLKKMPSV, corresponding to the handle region of the prorenin prosegment (handle region peptide [HRP]) influences angiogenesis, inflammation, and neuronal and glial function in rat retina. The (P)RR was localized to <e>retinal</e> vessels, endothelial cells, and pericytes, but most immunolabeling was in ganglion cells and glia. HRP (1 mg/kg per day by IP injection) reduced physiological angiogenesis in developing retina. Moreover, HRP (0.1 mg/kg per day by subcutaneous minipump) reduced pathological retinal angiogenesis, inflammation, and vascular endothelial growth factor and intercellular adhesion molecule-1 mRNA in rats with oxygen-induced retinopathy (OIR) to an extent similar to valsartan (10 mg/kg per day, IP). In contrast to its effects on vasculature, HRP compromised the electroretinogram in shams and OIR and increased phosphorylated extracellular-signal-related protein kinase 1/2 immunolabeling in shams but not in OIR, whereas valsartan did not affect the electroretinogram and reduced extracellular-signal-related protein kinase 1/2 immunolabeling in OIR. Retinal (P)RR mRNA levels were increased in OIR; HRP, but not valsartan, increased (P)RR mRNA levels in shams, whereas both HRP and valsartan reduced (P)RR mRNA levels in OIR. A control peptide (VSPMKKLLIR, 0.1 mg/kg per day) did not influence retinal vasculopathy or function. Circulating HRP levels in rats administered 1 mg/kg per day HRP were undetectable (&lt;3 pmol/L). We conclude that HRP had protective effects on the retinal vasculature similar to those of valsartan; however, unlike valsartan, HRP injured neuro-glia, which may involve the (P)RR, although the undetectable circulating HRP level makes a direct effect of HRP on retinal (P)RR function unlikely.",M2
20365198,"Effect of correlated lateral geniculate nucleus firing rates on predictions for monocular eye closure versus monocular <e>retinal</e> inactivation.Monocular deprivation experiments can be used to distinguish between different ideas concerning properties of cortical synaptic plasticity. Monocular deprivation by lid suture causes a rapid disconnection of the deprived eye connected to cortical neurons whereas total inactivation of the deprived eye produces much less of an ocular dominance shift. In order to understand these results one needs to know how lid suture and retinal inactivation affect neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) that provide the cortical input. Recent experimental results by Linden showed that monocular lid suture and monocular inactivation do not change the mean firing rates of LGN neurons but that lid suture reduces correlations between adjacent neurons whereas monocular inactivation leads to correlated firing. These, somewhat surprising, results contradict assumptions that have been made to explain the outcomes of different monocular deprivation protocols. Based on these experimental results we modify our assumptions about inputs to cortex during different deprivation protocols and show their implications when combined with different cortical plasticity rules. Using theoretical analysis, random matrix theory and simulations we show that high levels of correlations reduce the ocular dominance shift in learning rules that depend on homosynaptic depression (i.e., Bienenstock-Cooper-Munro type rules), consistent with experimental results, but have the opposite effect in rules that depend on heterosynaptic depression (i.e., Hebbian/principal component analysis type rules).",M2
20356843,"FATP1 inhibits 11-cis retinol formation via interaction with the visual cycle retinoid isomerase RPE65 and lecithin:retinol acyltransferase.The isomerization of all-trans retinol (vitamin A) to 11-cis retinol in the <e>retinal</e> pigment epithelium (RPE) is a key step in the visual process for the regeneration of the visual pigment chromophore, 11-cis retinal. LRAT and RPE65 are recognized as the minimal isomerase catalytic components. However, regulators of this rate-limiting step are not fully identified and could account for the phenotypic variability associated with inherited retinal degeneration (RD) caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene. To identify new RPE65 partners, we screened a porcine RPE mRNA library using a yeast two-hybrid assay with full-length human RPE65. One identified clone (here named FATP1c), containing the cytosolic C-terminal sequence from the fatty acid transport protein 1 (FATP1 or SLC27A1, solute carrier family 27 member 1), was demonstrated to interact dose-dependently with the native RPE65 and with LRAT. Furthermore, these interacting proteins colocalize in the RPE. Cellular reconstitution of human interacting proteins shows that FATP1 markedly inhibits 11-cis retinol production by acting on the production of all-trans retinyl esters and the isomerase activity of RPE65. The identification of this new visual cycle inhibitory component in RPE may contribute to further understanding of retinal pathogenesis.",M2
20351289,"Attenuation of Forkhead signaling by the <e>retinal</e> determination factor DACH1.The Drosophila Dachshund (Dac) gene, cloned as a dominant inhibitor of the hyperactive growth factor mutant ellipse, encodes a key component of the retinal determination gene network that governs cell fate. Herein, cyclic amplification and selection of targets identified a DACH1 DNA-binding sequence that resembles the FOX (Forkhead box-containing protein) binding site. Genome-wide in silico promoter analysis of DACH1 binding sites identified gene clusters populating cellular pathways associated with the cell cycle and growth factor signaling. ChIP coupled with high-throughput sequencing mapped DACH1 binding sites to corresponding gene clusters predicted in silico and identified as weight matrix resembling the cyclic amplification and selection of targets-defined sequence. DACH1 antagonized FOXM1 target gene expression, promoter occupancy in the context of local chromatin, and contact-independent growth. Attenuation of FOX function by the cell fate determination pathway has broad implications given the diverse role of FOX proteins in cellular biology and tumorigenesis.",M2
20348463,"In vivo quantification of the <e>retinal</e> reflectance spectral composition in elderly subjects before and after cataract surgery: Implications for the non-visual effects of light.Light is the signal that entrains the biological clock in humans to the 24-hour external time. Recently, it has been shown that short wavelengths play a key role in this process. In the present study, we describe a procedure to measure, objectively and in a quick way, the spectral composition of the light reaching the retina in vivo. The instruments involved are the foveal reflection analyzer (FRA) and the macular pigment reflectometer (MPR). By making use of these reflectometers, we show quantitatively that in subjects with cataracts, the light input is especially reduced in the short wavelength range. After cataract surgery during which the crystalline lens is replaced by a transparent artificial lens, the transmittance of the short wavelengths (between 420-500 nm) improved on average by a factor of 4. We conclude that this technique holds great promises for the chronobiological field because it allows for quantification of the spectral composition and light levels reaching the retina in vivo.",M2
20347921,"Protective effects of memantine and epicatechin on catechol-induced toxicity on Müller cells in vitro.This study evaluates the toxic effects of catechol (a component from cigarette smoke) on Müller cells (MIO-M1) in vitro, and investigates the inhibitors memantine and epicatechin to determine if they can reverse the catechol toxic effects. MIO-M1 cells were exposed to varying concentrations of catechol with or without memantine or epicatechin. Cell viability (CV) was measured by a trypan blue dye-exclusion assay. Caspase-3/7 activity was measured by fluorochrome assay. The production of reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) was measured with 2',7'-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate dye assay. Mitochondrial membrane potential (DeltaPsim) was measured using JC-1 assay. Intracellular ATP content was determined by the ATPLite kit. MIO-M1 cells showed significant decrease in cell viability, increased caspase-3/7 activity, elevated ROS/RNS levels, decreased DeltaPsim value, and decreased intracellular ATP content after exposure to catechol 150, 300, and 600 microM compared with control. Pre-treatment with memantine 10 microM or epicatechin 15 microM reversed loss of cell viability in catechol 150 microM-treated cultures (22.3%, p&lt;0.01 and 17.8%, p&lt;0.05), respectively. Similarly, pre-treatment with memantine 10 microM and epicatechin 15 microM prior to catechol resulted in decreased caspase-3/7 activities (77% and 64.2%, p&lt;0.001), decreased ROS/RNS levels (82.3% and 79%, p&lt;0.001), increased DeltaPsim value (76.4% and 72.2%, p&lt;0.001), and increased ATP levels (46.6% and 40.4%, p&lt;0.001) compared to 150 microM catechol-treated cultures. Catechol, a component of smoking, can diminish cell viability and mitochondrial function in MIO-M1 cells in vitro. However, memantine and epicatechin can partially reverse the cytotoxic effect of catechol.

20347154,"The ocular pathology of Terson's syndrome.PURPOSE: To improve understanding of vision loss and clinical findings, we studied gross and microscopic pathology of retinas and optic nerves of individuals with Terson's syndrome. DESIGN: Retrospective case series with clinicopathologic correlation. PARTICIPANTS: We included 109 deceased individuals with Terson's syndrome. METHODS: Histologic sections and gross photographs from 109 cases of Terson's Syndrome, accessed from 1955 to 1992 at the Wm R. Green Laboratory of Ocular Pathology, were studied and photographed; a representative case is described in detail. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Abnormalities in retina and optic nerve. RESULTS: Hemorrhages occur in vitreous, subhyaloid, sub-internal limiting membrane (ILM), intraretinal, and subretinal spaces, in association with macular holes, <e>retinal</e> detachments, and optic neuropathy. Subhyaloid hemorrhages have diffuse morphology, whereas sub-ILM are well-demarcated. Continuous and noncontinuous blood occurs along optic nerves, within nerve sheaths, and in the subdural and subarachnoid spaces. CONCLUSIONS: Blood occurring in various layers and locations of the retina, particularly the macula, causes various complications that influence clinical management and visual outcome. Morphology differentiates subhyaloid from sub-ILM hemorrhage. Patterns of hemorrhages of optic nerve contribute to understanding mechanisms of Terson's syndrome.

20346779,"Retromode <e>retinal</e> imaging of macular retinoschisis in highly myopic eyes.PURPOSE: To determine the characteristics of a macular retinoschisis using noninvasive retromode imaging by a new, commercial confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscope (F10; Nidek, Aichi, Japan) and to compare the findings with those obtained by conventional optical coherence tomography (OCT). DESIGN: Open-label, consecutive, interventional case series. METHODS: Sixty-six consecutive highly myopic eyes were examined by multiple scans of the posterior fundus within the retinal vascular arcade using the Cirrus OCT (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Oberkochen, Germany). The retinas also were examined with the F10. RESULTS: OCT examinations showed that 22 (33.3%) of the 66 eyes had a macular retinoschisis. Retromode imaging by F10 showed a characteristic fingerprint pattern at the corresponding area of the macular retinoschisis in all 22 eyes. The fingerprint pattern consisted of radiating retinal striae centered on the fovea and many light dots and lines that ran in parallel to the striae or formed a whorled pattern surrounded the radiating striae. Two patients had both inner and outer retinoschisis, and the border between them was outlined as a change in the course of the linear reflex by the retromode imaging. Also, an inner lamellar hole was found in 2 patients and was observed as a circular defect of the deep retinal reflex by the retromode imaging. In contrast, the 44 eyes that did not have a macular retinoschisis by OCT showed no abnormal findings by F10. CONCLUSIONS: Retromode imaging by F10 shows characteristic alteration of the retina that corresponds to the site of the macular retinoschisis.",M2
20346776,"Ultraviolet-B phototoxicity and hypothetical photomelanomagenesis: intraocular and crystalline lens photoprotection.PURPOSE: Ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation can cause phototoxic macular injuries in young people who have been sunbathing but not sungazing and in welders. Welders have a reportedly increased risk of uveal melanoma. We analyze phakic and pseudophakic risks for solar and welding arc UV-B exposure. DESIGN: Optical radiation measurement, analysis, and perspective. METHODS: Spectral transmittances were measured for UV-transmitting, UV-blocking, and blue-blocking intraocular lenses (IOLs). The photoprotective performances of crystalline and intraocular lenses were analyzed using relevant epidemiologic and laboratory data and action spectra for acute <e>retinal</e> phototoxicity and melanoma photocarcinogenesis. RESULTS: Crystalline lens UV-B retinal protection is deficient in children and young adults, increasing their potential susceptibility to acute retinal phototoxicity and hypothetical photomelanomagenesis. UV-B radiation has sufficient energy/photon to induce primary melanomagenic DNA lesions, unlike blue light or UV-A radiation. UV-blocking and blue-blocking IOLs have negligible UV-B transmittance. UV-transmitting IOL transmittance of UV-B radiation is equivalent to that of a 15-year-old crystalline lens. CONCLUSIONS: If optical radiation exposure is responsible for welders' increased risk of uveal melanoma, then UV-B radiation is the most probable causative agent and spectacle wear is a potential confounding factor in epidemiologic studies of ocular melanoma. Welders under 30 years of age are at greater risk for welding maculopathy than older welders. Children, adults under 30 years of age, and pseudophakic individuals with UV-transmitting IOLs should wear sunglasses in bright environments because of the UV-B window in their crystalline lenses or IOLs.",M2
20346762,"<e>Retinal</e> parallel processors: more than 100 independent microcircuits operate within a single interneuron.Most neurons are highly polarized cells with branched dendrites that receive and integrate synaptic inputs and extensive axons that deliver action potential output to distant targets. By contrast, amacrine cells, a diverse class of inhibitory interneurons in the inner retina, collect input and distribute output within the same neuritic network. The extent to which most amacrine cells integrate synaptic information and distribute their output is poorly understood. Here, we show that single A17 amacrine cells provide reciprocal feedback inhibition to presynaptic bipolar cells via hundreds of independent microcircuits operating in parallel. The A17 uses specialized morphological features, biophysical properties, and synaptic mechanisms to isolate feedback microcircuits and maximize its capacity to handle many independent processes. This example of a neuron employing distributed parallel processing rather than spatial integration provides insights into how unconventional neuronal morphology and physiology can maximize network function while minimizing wiring cost.",M2
20346118,"Neural computation of visual imaging based on Kronecker product in the primary visual cortex.BACKGROUND: What kind of neural computation is actually performed by the primary visual cortex and how is this represented mathematically at the system level? It is an important problem in the visual information processing, but has not been well answered. In this paper, according to our understanding of <e>retinal</e> organization and parallel multi-channel topographical mapping between retina and primary visual cortex V1, we divide an image into orthogonal and orderly array of image primitives (or patches), in which each patch will evoke activities of simple cells in V1. From viewpoint of information processing, this activated process, essentially, involves optimal detection and optimal matching of receptive fields of simple cells with features contained in image patches. For the reconstruction of the visual image in the visual cortex V1 based on the principle of minimum mean squares error, it is natural to use the inner product expression in neural computation, which then is transformed into matrix form. RESULTS: The inner product is carried out by using Kronecker product between patches and function architecture (or functional column) in localized and oriented neural computing. Compared with Fourier Transform, the mathematical description of Kronecker product is simple and intuitive, so is the algorithm more suitable for neural computation of visual cortex V1. Results of computer simulation based on two-dimensional Gabor pyramid wavelets show that the theoretical analysis and the proposed model are reasonable. CONCLUSIONS: Our results are: 1. The neural computation of the retinal image in cortex V1 can be expressed to Kronecker product operation and its matrix form, this algorithm is implemented by the inner operation between retinal image primitives and primary visual cortex's column. It has simple, efficient and robust features, which is, therefore, such a neural algorithm, which can be completed by biological vision. 2. It is more suitable that the function of cortical column in cortex V1 is considered as the basic unit of visual image processing (such unit can implement basic multiplication of visual primitives, such as contour, line, and edge), rather than a set of tiled array filter. Fourier Transformation is replaced with Kronecker product, which greatly reduces the computational complexity. The neurobiological basis of this idea is that a visual image can be represented as a linear combination of orderly orthogonal primitive image containing some local feature. In the visual pathway, the image patches are topographically mapped onto cortex V1 through parallel multi-channels and then are processed independently by functional columns. Clearly, the above new perspective has some reference significance to exploring the neural mechanisms on the human visual information processing.",M2
20345762,"LIF-dependent JAK3 activation is not essential for <e>retinal</e> degeneration.Retinal degeneration causes the induction of a leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-controlled survival pathway which includes Janus kinase/signal transducer and activator of transcription signaling. Lack of LIF prevents activation of this signaling cascade and accelerates disease progression leading to a fast loss of photoreceptor cells. In this study, we show that expression of Janus kinase 3 (Jak3), but not of the other members of the family of Janus kinases, is induced in four different models of retinal degeneration and that LIF is essential and sufficient to activate Jak3 gene expression. We also show that the induction of Jak3 and Lif may not depend directly on cell death but rather on the retinal stress during photoreceptor degeneration. However, despite its dependence on LIF, JAK3 is not essential for LIF-mediated photoreceptor protection or gene expression. Also, absence of JAK3 in knockout mice did not affect immune-related responses in the degenerating retina. JAK3 may therefore play a different, yet unknown, role in the retinal response to photoreceptor injury.",M2
20345748,"Role of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase pathway in <e>retinal</e> excitotoxicity, and neuroprotection by its inhibition.Retinal excitotoxicity is associated with retinal ischemia, and with glaucomatous and traumatic optic neuropathy. The present study investigates the role of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) activation in NMDA-mediated retinal excitotoxicity and determines whether neuroprotection can be obtained with the JNK pathway inhibitor, D-form of JNK-inhibitor 1 (D-JNKI-1). Young adult rats received intravitreal injections of 20 nmol NMDA, which caused extensive neuronal death in the inner nuclear and ganglion cell layers. This excitotoxicity was associated with strong activation of calpain, as revealed by fodrin cleavage, and of JNK. The cell-permeable peptide D-JNKI-1 was used to inhibit JNK. Within 40 min of its intravitreal injection, FITC-labeled D-JNKI-1 spread through the retinal ganglion cell layer into the inner nuclear layer and interfered with the NMDA-induced phosphorylation of JNK. Injections of unlabeled D-JNKI-1 gave unprecedentedly strong neuroprotection against cell death in both layers, lasting for at least 10 days. The NMDA-induced calpain-specific fodrin cleavage was likewise strongly inhibited by D-JNKI-1. Moreover the electroretinogram was partially preserved by D-JNKI-1. Thus, the JNK pathway is involved in NMDA-mediated retinal excitotoxicity and JNK inhibition by D-JNKI-1 provides strong neuroprotection as shown morphologically, biochemically and physiologically.",M2
20339831,"Low-dose erythropoietin inhibits oxidative stress and early vascular changes in the experimental diabetic retina.AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Diabetic retinopathy is the result of increased oxidative and nitrosative stress induced by chronic hyperglycaemia, and affects the vasculature and the neuroglia. Erythropoietin is a neuroprotective and an endothelial survival factor. We assessed the effect of suberythropoietic epoetin delta doses on variables of oxidative stress in target tissues of diabetic complications and on pericyte loss in the diabetic retina. METHODS: We administered epoetin delta to streptozotocin-induced diabetic Wistar rats at doses of 384 IU/kg body weight once weekly or 128 IU/kg body weight three times a week. The treatment lasted for 3 months. Oxidative stress and formation of AGEs were assessed by immunoblotting, expression of Ang-2 (also known as Angpt2) by RT-PCR, activation of protein kinase B (AKT) and heat shock protein (HSP)-27 levels by immunofluorescence, and incipient <e>retinal</e> vascular changes by quantitative morphometry of retinal digest preparations. RESULTS: Diabetes increased variables of oxidative stress and nitrosative stress (N(epsilon)-carboxymethyl-lysine, nitrotyrosine and methylglyoxal-type AGEs) in retina, kidney and heart of diabetic rats. Epoetin delta reduced oxidative and nitrosative stress in all tissues, and AGEs in the retina. It also reduced increased retinal Ang-2 expression and pericyte loss, and ameliorated p-AKT and HSP-27 levels. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Epoetin delta has antioxidative properties in organs affected by diabetes and may prevent incipient microvascular damage in the diabetic retina.",M2
20338219,"<e>Retinal</e> afferents to the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus in the rock cavy (Kerodon rupestris).The MD has reciprocal connections with the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (PFC) and with limbic cortices and appears to participate in learning and memory-related processes. In this study, we report the identification of a hitherto not reported direct retinal projection to the MD of the rock cavy, a typical rodent species of the Northeast region of Brazil. After unilateral intravitreal injections of cholera toxin subunit B (CTb), anterogradely transported CTb-imunoreactive fibers and presumptive terminals were seen in the MD. A few labeled retinal fibers/terminals detected in the MD of the rock cavy brain show clear varicosities, suggesting terminal fields. The present work is the first to show a direct retinal projection to the MD of rodents and may contribute for elucidating the anatomical substrate of the functional involvement of this thalamic nucleus in the modulation of the visual recognition, emotional learning and object-reward association memory.",M2
20336521,"Directing human embryonic stem cells to a <e>retinal</e> fate.Substantial progress has been made in the development of methods to direct embryonic stem cells to differentiate into various regions of the central nervous system (CNS). We have used the current model of eye specification to develop a protocol for directing human embryonic stem cells to generate retinal progenitors and various types of retinal neurons. Our method uses a multistep protocol in which embryoid bodies are treated with inhibitors of both BMP signaling and canonical Wnt signaling to promote expression of key eye field transcription factors (EFTFs), as assayed by RT-PCR and immunofluorescence microscopy. The retinal progenitor cells spontaneously undergo differentiation into various types of retinal neurons, including photoreceptors, and this can be promoted by treatment with small molecule inhibitors of the Notch pathway.",M2
20335468," Slow activity transients  in infant rat visual cortex: a spreading synchronous oscillation patterned by <e>retinal</e> waves.A primary feature of the preterm infant electroencephalogram is the presence of large infra-slow potentials containing rapid oscillations called slow activity transients (SATs). Such activity has not been described in animal models, and their generative mechanisms are unknown. Here we use direct-current and multisite extracellular, as well as whole-cell, recording in vivo to demonstrate the existence of regularly repeating SATs in the visual cortex of infant rats before eye opening. Present only in absence of anesthesia, SATs at postnatal day 10-11 were identifiable as a separate group of long-duration (approximately 10 s) events that consisted of large (&gt;1 mV) negative local-field potentials produced by the summation of multiple bursts of rapid oscillatory activity (15-30 Hz). SATs synchronized the vast majority of neuronal activity (87%) in the visual cortex before eye opening. Enucleation eliminated SATs, and their duration, interevent interval, and sub-burst structure matched those of phase III retinal waves recorded in vitro. Retinal waves, however, lacked rapid oscillations, suggesting that they arise centrally. Multielectrode recordings showed that SATs spread horizontally in cortex and synchronize activity at coactive locales via the rapid oscillations. SATs were clearly different from ongoing cortical activity, which was observable as a separate class of short bursts from postnatal day 9. Together, our data suggest that, in vivo, early cortical activity is primarily determined by peripheral inputs-retinal waves in visual cortex-that provide excitatory input, and by thalamocortical circuitry, which transforms this input to beta oscillations. We propose that the synchronous oscillations of SATs participate in the formation of visual circuitry.",M2
20333740,"Semiautomated intraocular laser surgery using handheld instruments.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: In laser <e>retinal</e> photocoagulation, hundreds of dot-like burns are applied. We introduce a robot-assisted technique to enhance the accuracy and reduce the tedium of the procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Laser burn locations are overlaid on preoperative retinal images using common patterns such as grids. A stereo camera/monitor setup registers and displays the planned burn locations overlaid on real-time video. Using an active handheld micromanipulator, a 7 x 7 grid of burns spaced 650 microm apart is applied to both paper slides and porcine retina in vitro using 30 milliseconds laser pulses at 532 nm. Two scenarios were tested: unaided, in which the micromanipulator is inert and the laser fires at a fixed frequency, and aided, in which the micromanipulator actively targets burn locations and the laser fires automatically upon target acquisition. Error is defined as the distance from the center of the observed burn mark to the preoperatively selected target location. RESULTS: An experienced retinal surgeon performed trials with and without robotic assistance, on both paper slides and porcine retina in vitro. In the paper slide experiments at an unaided laser repeat rate of 0.5 Hz, error was 125+/-62 microm with robotic assistance and 149+/-76 microm without (P &lt; 0.005), and trial duration was 70+/-8 seconds with robotic assistance and 97+/-7 seconds without (P &lt; 0.005). At a repeat rate of 1.0 Hz, error was 129+/-69 microm with robotic assistance and 166+/-91 microm without (P &lt; 0.005), and trial duration was 26+/-4 seconds with robotic assistance and 47+/-1 seconds without (P &lt; 0.005). At a repeat rate of 2.0 Hz on porcine retinal tissue, error was 123+/-69 microm with robotic assistance and 203+/-104 microm without (P &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSION: Robotic assistance can increase the accuracy of laser photocoagulation while reducing the duration of the operation.",M2
20307040,"Combination of internal limiting membrane peeling and endophotocoagulation for <e>retinal</e> detachment related to high myopia in patients with macular hole.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:To evaluate the anatomic and visual outcomes of undergoing combined internal limiting membrane peeling and endophotocoagulation in retinal detachment related to high myopia in patients with macular hole. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Fifty-two eyes of 52 consecutive patients with macular hole and retinal detachment related to high myopia were recruited into the study. The combination treatment group underwent vitrectomy and perfluoropropane gas injection with the assistance of indocyanine green internal limiting membrane peeling and additional endophotocoagulation 2 weeks postoperatively. The control group only underwent vitrectomy and perfluoropropane gas injection and was matched to the combination treatment group according to the refractive errors and the size of macular hole. RESULTS:The primary macular hole closure rate was significantly higher in the combination treatment group (96.2%) than in the control group (57.7%) (P &lt; .05). Six months postoperatively, a best-corrected visual acuity improvement of 2 or more lines was found in more eyes in the combination treatment group (100%) than in the control group (53.8%) (P &gt; .05). CONCLUSION:Combined internal limiting membrane peeling and endophotocoagulation for retinal detachment related to high myopia in patients with macular hole has a promising anatomic closure rate and visual acuity and may be a better choice for retinal detachment in this group.",M2
20307034,"Association between <e>retinal</e> thickness and retinal pigment epithelium elevation in age-related macular degeneration.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:To determine the association between retinal pigment epithelium elevation and maximum retinal thickness in patients with age-related macular degeneration. PATIENTS AND METHODS:Fifteen patients (mean age = 76 +/- 8 years) with age-related macular degeneration and pigment epithelial detachment underwent optical coherence tomography. The images were analyzed by two observers to measure maximum retinal thickness and the width and maximum height of the pigment epithelial detachment. Linear regression analysis was performed to determine the association between maximum retinal thickness and retinal pigment epithelium elevation. RESULTS:The results indicated high correlations between observers in identifying pigment epithelial detachment edges and measuring retinal pigment epithelium elevation and maximum retinal thickness. Pigment epithelial detachment height ranged from 82 to 599 microns. Mean maximum retinal thickness was 424 +/- 150 microns. Increased maximum retinal thickness was associated with more elevated retinal pigment epithelium (r = 0.7; P = .003). CONCLUSION:Retinal thickness was associated with pigment epithelial detachment height, warranting future investigations into pathophysiologic mechanisms leading to and potential treatment for pigment epithelial detachment and associated retinal thickening.",M2
20307033,"Assessing the reliability of automated OCT <e>retinal</e> thickness measurements in patients with choroidal neovascularization due to age-related macular degeneration.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:To compare automated versus manual retinal measurement using Stratus optical coherence tomography (OCT) (Carl Zeiss Meditec, Dublin, CA) in patients with choroidal neovascularization (CNV) due to age-related macular degeneration (AMD). PATIENTS AND METHODS:Patients with subfoveal CNV due to AMD underwent Stratus OCT imaging. Each scan was evaluated for automated: foveal center point thickness, central subfield thickness, signal strength, and manual: central retinal thickness, central retinal/lesion thickness, CNV thickness, pigment epithelial detachment thickness, and number of correct retinal boundaries (CRBs). RESULTS:A total of 209 OCT visits (49 patients) were assessed. On fast macular thickness map, 52% of scans had less than 4 (of possible 6) CRBs placed by the automated OCT algorithm. There was a mean difference of 34 microm between automated foveal center point thickness and manual central retinal thickness (P &lt; .00005). Only 40% and 27% of automated foveal center point thickness and central subfield, respectively, lay within +/- 25 microm of manual central retinal thickness. As the number of CRBs or signal strength increased, the difference between manual and automated measurements decreased. CONCLUSION:Manual retinal thickness measurements differ significantly from those calculated by the current automated Stratus OCT software in exudative AMD.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study included 181 eyes: 106 normal, 37 with ocular hypertension, and 38 with juvenile glaucoma. Diagnostic groups were classified based on intraocular pressure, optic nerve head appearance, visual field examination, and central corneal thickness measurement. RNFL measurements were taken using the Zeiss Stratus OCT. RESULTS: The RNLF average thickness was 94.2 + or -13.2 microm in glaucomatous eyes, 105.4 + or - 6.8 microm in ocular hypertensive eyes, and 104.8 + or - 10.3 microm in normal eyes. RNFL average thickness, inferior thickness, and superior thickness showed statistically significant differences between normal and glaucomatous eyes (p&lt;0.01) and between normal and ocular hypertensive eyes (p&lt;0.01). There was no difference found between normal and ocular hypertensive eye. CONCLUSION: OCT has already shown its diagnostic efficiency in adult glaucoma. This study shows that OCT is useful in childhood glaucoma diagnosis, helping to differentiate between ocular hypertension and beginning juvenile glaucoma.",M2
20300563,"FOXO1 plays an essential role in apoptosis of <e>retinal</e> pericytes.PURPOSE: An early and significant event in diabetic retinopathy is the loss of retinal microvascular pericytes. Studies were performed to investigate pathways through which an advanced glycation endproduct and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha stimulate apoptosis in retinal pericytes through the activation of the pro-apoptotic transcription factor Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1). METHODS: Human retinal pericytes were stimulated by carboxymethyllysine (CML)-collagen, an advanced glycation endproduct, or TNF-alpha in vitro. Apoptosis was assessed by measuring cytoplasmic histone-associated DNA. The role of FOXO1 was examined by RNA interference (RNAi), and specific inhibitors were used to investigate the role of p38 and Jun N-terminal kinase mitogen-activated protein kinase (JNK MAP) kinases, Akt, and nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB). Caspase-3 activity was measured with a luminescent substrate, and FOXO1 DNA-binding activity was measured by electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). RESULTS: TNF-alpha and CML-collagen but not control collagen stimulated apoptosis, caspase-3 activity, and FOXO1 DNA-binding activity in pericytes. Silencing FOXO1 by small interfering RNA prevented apoptosis of pericytes in response to both TNF-alpha and CML-collagen. By use of specific inhibitors, we demonstrated that both FOXO1 activation and subsequent apoptosis was mediated, in part, by p38 and JNK MAP kinases. In contrast Akt and NF-kappaB inhibitors had the opposite effect on pericyte apoptosis. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate pathways through which two different mediators, TNF-alpha and an advanced glycation endproduct, can induce pericyte apoptosis through activation of the transcription factor FOXO1.",M2
20299105,"Vitrectomy outcomes in eyes with diabetic macular edema and vitreomacular traction.PURPOSE: To evaluate vitrectomy for diabetic macular edema (DME) in eyes with at least moderate vision loss and vitreomacular traction. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS: The primary cohort included 87 eyes with DME and vitreomacular traction based on investigator's evaluation, visual acuity 20/63-20/400, optical coherence tomography (OCT) central subfield &gt;300 microns and no concomitant cataract extraction at the time of vitrectomy. METHODS: Surgery was performed according to the investigator's usual routine. Follow-up visits were performed after 3 months, 6 months (primary end point), and 1 year. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, OCT <e>retinal</e> thickening, and operative complications. RESULTS: At baseline, median visual acuity in the 87 eyes was 20/100 and median OCT thickness was 491 microns. During vitrectomy, additional procedures included epiretinal membrane peeling in 61%, internal limiting membrane peeling in 54%, panretinal photocoagulation in 40%, and injection of corticosteroids at the close of the procedure in 64%. At 6 months, median OCT central subfield thickness decreased by 160 microns, with 43% having central subfield thickness &lt;250 microns and 68% having at least a 50% reduction in thickening. Visual acuity improved by &gt; or =10 letters in 38% (95% confidence interval, 28%-49%) and deteriorated by &gt; or =10 letters in 22% (95% confidence interval, 13%-31%). Postoperative complications through 6 months included vitreous hemorrhage (5 eyes), elevated intraocular pressure requiring treatment (7 eyes), retinal detachment (3 eyes), and endophthalmitis (1 eye). Few changes in results were noted between 6 months and 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: After vitrectomy performed for DME and vitreomacular traction, retinal thickening was reduced in most eyes. Between 28% and 49% of eyes with characteristics similar to those included in this study are likely to have improvement of visual acuity, whereas between 13% and 31% are likely to have worsening. The operative complication rate is low and similar to what has been reported for this procedure. These data provide estimates of surgical outcomes and serve as a reference for future studies that might consider vitrectomy for DME in eyes with at least moderate vision loss and vitreomacular traction.",M2
20237281,"Temporal requirement of the protein tyrosine phosphatase Shp2 in establishing the neuronal fate in early <e>retinal</e> development.FGF signaling is critical in the development of the vertebrate retina, which differentiates in a wave-like pattern similar to that found in the Drosophila eye. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of FGF signaling in vertebrate eye development by identifying Shp2, a protein tyrosine phosphatase, as a novel factor in orchestrating retinal morphogenesis. Using a series of Shp2 conditional mutants, we have shown that Shp2 is specifically required for the initiation of retinal neurogenesis but not for the maintenance of the retinal differentiation program. By mosaic deletion of Shp2, we further demonstrated that Shp2 ablation did not prevent the spreading of the retinal differentiation wave. Shp2 instead controls the patterning of the optic vesicle by regulating the retinal progenitor factors and cell proliferation. In ex vivo culture models and genetic rescue experiments, we showed that Shp2 acts downstream to FGF signaling in retinal development and that it can be functionally substituted by activated Ras signaling. Together, these results demonstrate that Shp2 mediates FGF-Ras signaling to control retinal progenitor cell fate.",M2
20237275,"Dicer is required for the transition from early to late progenitor state in the developing mouse retina.MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small 19-25 nucleotide RNAs that influence gene expression through posttranscriptional regulation of mRNA translation and degradation, have recently emerged as important regulators of neural development. Using conditional knock-out of Dicer, an RNase III enzyme required for miRNA maturation, previous studies have demonstrated an essential role for miRNAs in mouse cortical, inner ear, and olfactory development. However, a previous study (Damiani et al., 2008) using a Chx10cre mouse to delete Dicer in <e>retinal</e> progenitors reported no defects in the retina before the second postnatal week, suggesting that miRNAs are not required for mouse retinal development. In an effort to further study the role of miRNAs during retinal development and resolve this apparent conflict, we conditionally knocked out Dicer using a different (alphaPax6cre) line of transgenic mice. In contrast to the previous study, we demonstrate an essential role for miRNAs during mouse retinal development. In the absence of Dicer in the embryonic retina, production of early generated cell types (ganglion and horizontal cells) is increased, and markers of late progenitors are not expressed. This phenotype persists into postnatal retina, in which we find the Dicer-deficient progenitors fail to generate late-born cell types such as rods and Müller glia but continue to generate ganglion cells. We further characterize the dynamic expression of miRNAs during retinal progenitor differentiation and provide a comprehensive profile of miRNAs expressed during retinal development. We conclude that Dicer is necessary for the developmental change in competence of the retinal progenitor cells.",M2
20234980,"[Visual loss under silicone oil]Silicone oil is used as intravitreal tamponading agent in surgery for rhegmatogenous <e>retinal</e> detachment (RRD) cases complicated with proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). Recently, a number of case series have appeared where profound central visual loss has been found in eyes after uncomplicated vitrectomy with silicone tamponade for RRD in eyes with seemingly good visual potential. Several reports have demonstrated the migration of silicone oil droplets into the retina and the optic nerve, others the widespread loss of myelinated optic nerve fibres. These reports are reviewed, and it is concluded that caution is warranted when silicone oil is used in eyes with good visual potential. Finally the additional danger of central visual loss should be taken into consideration when deciding to use silicone oil or gas as intravitreal tamponade.",M2
20230820,"Iron, the retina and the lens: a focused review.This review is focused on iron metabolism in the retina and in the lens and its relation to their respective age-related pathologies, macular degeneration (AMD) and cataract (ARC). Several aspects of iron homeostasis are considered first in the retina and second in the lens, paying particular attention to the transport of iron through the blood-<e>retinal</e> barrier and through the lens epithelial cell barrier, to the immunochemistry of iron-related proteins and their expression in both the retina and the lens, and to the nature of the photochemical damage caused by UV light on both tissues. A comparative overview of some iron related parameters (total iron, transferrin (Tf), transferrin saturation and total iron binding capacity), in plasma and ocular tissues and fluids of three animal species is also presented. Based on results selected from the literature reviewed, and our own results, a scheme for the overall circulation of iron within and out of the eye is proposed, in which, (i) iron is pumped from the retina to the vitreous body by a ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated process at the endfeet of Müller cells, (ii) vitreal Tf binds this iron and the complex diffuses towards the lens, (iii) the iron/Tf complex is incorporated into the lens extracellular space probably at the lens equator and moves to the epithelial-fiber interface, (iv) upon interaction with Tf receptors of the apical pole of lens epithelial cells, the iron/Tf complex is endocytosed and iron is exported as Fe(3+) by a ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated process taking place at the basal pole of the epithelial cells, and (v) Fe(3+) is bound to aqueous humor Tf and drained with the aqueous humor into systemic blood circulation for recycling. The proposed scheme represents an example of close cooperation between the retina and the lens to maintain a constant flow of iron within the eye that provides an adequate supply of iron to ocular tissues and secures the systemic recycling of this element. It does not discount the existence of additional ways for iron to leave the eye through the blood-retinal barrier. In this review both AMD and ARC are recognized as multifactorial diseases with an important photoxidative component, and exhibiting a remarkable similitude of altered local iron metabolism. The epidemiological relationship between ARC and ferropenic anemia is explained on the basis that hepcidin, the hormone responsible for the anemia of chronic inflammation, could paradoxically cause intracellular iron overload in the lens by interfering with the proposed ferroportin/ferroxidase-mediated export of iron at the basal side of the anterior lens epithelium. Other authors have suggested that a similar situation is created in the retina in the case of AMD.",M2

20219535,"Three-dimensional optical coherence tomography imaging of <e>retinal</e> sheet implants in live rats.PURPOSE: To obtain three-dimensional images from retinal transplants in live animals and evaluate the placement and structural quality of the transplants. METHODS: Donor retinal sheets were isolated from E19 fetuses of transgenic rats expressing human alkaline phosphatase (hPAP), and transplanted to the subretinal space of 19-56 days old S334ter-3 rat recipients with fast retinal degeneration (average age at surgery 32 days). A total of 143 rats were imaged 1 day to 2.8 months after surgery, using a Fourier-domain optical coherence tomography (FDOCT) system, with an axial resolution of 3.5 microm. The CCD A-line integration time was set at 200 micros for better visualization of degenerated retina. After targeting the transplant area, 139 or 199 consecutive slices were scanned. Projection images and movies of the retinal transplant area were computed and later compared with histology. RESULTS: OCT scans identified 137 of 141 transplants as a thickening of the degenerated retina. OCT indicated the laminar structure of the transplants and surgical defects, such as RPE/choroid damage with an accuracy rate between 83 and 99%. Three-dimensional projections showed the transplant position in the retina in relation to the optic disc. Histology of transplants by hPAP and hematoxylin-eosin staining was correlated with the OCT results. CONCLUSIONS: Optical coherence tomography is an excellent tool to image retinal layers in a live rat. This procedure helps to evaluate the placement and quality of the transplants in the living eye.",M2
20216293,"Comparison of laser photocoagulation for diabetic retinopathy using 532-nm standard laser versus multispot pattern scan laser.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the efficacy, collateral damage, and convenience of panretinal photocoagulation for proliferative diabetic retinopathy or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy using a 532-nm solid-state green laser (GLX) versus a multispot 532-nm pattern scan laser (PASCAL). METHODS: This study was a prospective randomized clinical trial. Sixty patients with bilaterally symmetrical proliferative diabetic retinopathy or severe nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy participated. Each patient underwent panretinal photocoagulation: one eye with GLX and the other with PASCAL, two sittings per eye. Grade 3 burns with a 200-mum spot size were placed with both modalities. The fluence, pain using the visual analog scale, time, laser spot spread with infrared images, and <e>retinal</e> sensitivity were compared. RESULTS: Pattern scan laser and GLX required an average fluence of 40.33 vs 191 J/cm(2), respectively. Average time required per sitting was 1.43 minutes with PASCAL and 4.53 minutes with GLX. Average visual analog scale reading for GLX was 4.6, whereas that for PASCAL was 0.33. Heidelberg retinal angiography images showed the spot spread as being 430 versus 310 microm at 3 months with GLX and PASCAL. The eyes treated with PASCAL showed higher average retinal sensitivity in the central 15 degrees and 15 degrees to 30 degrees zones (25.08 and 22.08 dB, respectively) than the eyes treated with GLX (23.16 and 17.14 dB), respectively. CONCLUSION: Pattern scan laser showed lesser collateral damage and similar regression of retinopathy compared with GLX. Pattern scan laser treatment was less time consuming and less painful for the patient compared with GLX.",M2

20213429,"GABAa and GABAc receptor-mediated modulation of responses to color stimuli: electroretinographic study in the turtle Emys orbicularis.GABAergic transmission is involved in color coding in the retina. The specific contribution of different GABA receptors to spectral sensitivity of the <e>retinal</e> responses is not well characterized. We studied GABAa and GABAc receptor-mediated effects on the intensity-response functions of the electroretinographic ON (b-wave) and OFF (d-wave) responses to color stimuli. For this purpose, we compared the effects of GABAa receptor blockade by bicuculline with the effects of GABAa + GABAc receptor blockade by picrotoxin. The blockade of both GABAa and GABAc receptors caused an amplitude increase of the electroretinographic responses, but the effects of the two blockades depended in a specific manner on stimulus intensity and wavelength. The effects of GABAa receptor blockade showed distinct color ON/OFF asymmetry. The absolute and relative sensitivities of the ON responses to blue stimuli and OFF responses to red stimuli were increased to the greatest degree while the sensitivity of the ON responses to red stimuli and OFF responses to blue stimuli was least increased. In contrast, color ON/OFF asymmetry was not typical of the effects of GABAc receptor blockade. The most prominent GABAc effect was the sensitivity increase of the ON and OFF responses to blue stimuli and, to some lesser extent, to green stimuli. The results of this study indicate a specific role of GABAa and GABAc receptor-mediated influences in processing of chromatic information in the distal retina.",M2

DESIGN: Interventional family study (ophthalmic examination and candidate gene testing). RESULTS: The proband (mother), who complained of poor vision since early childhood, had bilateral helicoid subretinal fibrosis mostly involving the macula. Two children were symptomatic; one had ophthalmic findings similar to her mother while the second had macular retinoschisis, <e>retinal</e> pigment epithelium changes, and refractive accommodative esotropia. The father and third child were asymptomatic and had unremarkable ophthalmic examination findings. Based on the findings in the second symptomatic child, NR2E3 analysis was performed, which revealed homozygosity for a novel mutation, p.S44X, in all 3 affected individuals and heterozygosity for the mutation in both asymptomatic individuals. CONCLUSION: Helicoid subretinal fibrosis is another potential phenotypic manifestation of recessive NR2E3 mutation. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Examination of affected relatives can be helpful in guiding molecular genetic testing for hereditary eye disease when the proband's diagnosis is unclear.",M2
20211445,"Effect of nearwork-induced transient myopia on distance <e>retinal</e> defocus patterns.The purpose of the current study was to assess the effect of nearwork-induced transient myopia (NITM) on retinal defocus patterns during distance viewing. An empirically derived, conceptual model of human blur perception and related retinal defocus patterns has been extended to determine the effect of NITM on the relative contributions of myopic and hyperopic retinal defocus during distance viewing. Under the normal hyperfocal refractive condition during distance viewing with isolated stimulus conditions, there is very small myopic defocus (approximately 0.25 diopters), and no hyperopic defocus, present. After sustained nearwork generating NITM, a moderate increase in this myopic defocus contribution takes place. In the normal isolated distance viewing situation with only very small myopic defocus present, as would occur with many far outdoor activities, the paucity of overall retinal defocus may provide a  protected  condition against myopia development. In contrast, with the addition of NITM producing increased myopic retinal defocus only, there is an imbalance of retinal defocus that may be myopigenic, especially in the context of foveal and peripheral retinal interactions.",M2
20210467,"Detection of <e>retinal</e> nerve fiber layer defects on retinal fundus images for early diagnosis of glaucoma.Retinal nerve fiber layer defect (NFLD) is a major sign of glaucoma, which is the second leading cause of blindness in the world. Early detection of NFLDs is critical for improved prognosis of this progressive, blinding disease. We have investigated a computerized scheme for detection of NFLDs on retinal fundus images. In this study, 162 images, including 81 images with 99 NFLDs, were used. After major blood vessels were removed, the images were transformed so that the curved paths of retinal nerves become approximately straight on the basis of ellipses, and the Gabor filters were applied for enhancement of NFLDs. Bandlike regions darker than the surrounding pixels were detected as candidates of NFLDs. For each candidate, image features were determined and the likelihood of a true NFLD was determined by using the linear discriminant analysis and an artificial neural network (ANN). The sensitivity for detecting the NFLDs was 91% at 1.0 false positive per image by using the ANN. The proposed computerized system for the detection of NFLDs can be useful to physicians in the diagnosis of glaucoma in a mass screening.",M2

METHODS: All 4325 patients with retinal detachment underwent scleral buckling surgery. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Complete anatomic attachment of the retina. RESULTS: The overall success rate in all 4325 MUSTARD cases was 83.98%. The highest success rate was achieved in patients aged 51 to 60 years, with 86.72%. With regard to refractive error, success rates were highest in moderate myopes, that is, in 707 patients with a refractive error between -2.75 and -8.0 diopters (86.70%) and in 573 patients with mild myopia between -0.5 and -2.0 diopters (86.21%). The lens status did not play a significant role in outcome. In patients with nontrauma-related retinal detachment, success rates were 84.45% for phakic patients, 82.88% for pseudophakic patients, and 81.88% for aphakic patients. An epidemiologically surprising result was the lower than expected number of myopic individuals among patients with retinal detachment: Only approximately one quarter had myopia of -2.75 diopters or more. In phakic patients aged 51 to 80 years, only 16% were myopic. CONCLUSIONS: Scleral buckling is an established and generally successful method for the treatment of retinal detachment. As our case series has demonstrated, myopia, aphakia, and pseudophakia do not constitute factors that might diminish the chances of success.

20206286,"<e>Retinal</e> ultrastructure of murine models of dry age-related macular degeneration (AMD).Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is the most prevalent form of irreversible blindness worldwide in the elderly population. The pathology of dry AMD consists of macular degeneration of photoreceptors and the RPE, lipofuscin (A2E) accumulation, and drusen formation. Mice have been widely used for generating models that simulate human AMD features for investigating the pathogenesis, treatment and prevention of the disease. Although the mouse has no macula, focal atrophy of photoreceptors and RPE, lipofuscin accumulation, and increased A2E can develop in aged mouse eyes. However, drusen are rarely seen in mice because of their simpler Bruch's membrane and different process of lipofuscin extrusion compared with humans. Thus, analyzing basal deposits at the ultrastructural level and understanding the ultrastructural pathologic differences between various mouse AMD models are critical to comprehending the significance of research findings and response to possible therapeutic options for dry AMD. Based on the multifactorial pathogenesis of AMD, murine dry AMD models can be classified into three groups. First, genetically engineered mice that target genes related to juvenile macular dystrophies are the most common models, and they include abcr(-/-) (Stargardt disease), transgenic ELOVL4 (Stargardt-3 dominant inheritary disease), Efemp1(R345W/R345W) (Doyne honeycomb retinal dystrophy), and Timp3(S156C/S156C) (Sorsby fundus dystrophy) mice. Other murine models target genes relevant to AMD, including inflammatory genes such as Cfh(-/-), Ccl2(-/-), Ccr2(-/-), Cx3cr1(-/-), and Ccl2(-/-)/cx3cr1(-/-), oxidative stress associated genes such as Sod1(-/-) and Sod2 knockdown, metabolic pathway genes such as neprilysin(-/-) (amyloid beta), transgenic mcd/mcd (cathepsin D), Cp(-/-)/Heph(-/Y) (ferroxidase ceruloplasmin/hepaestin, iron metabolism), and transgenic ApoE4 on high fat and high cholesterol diet (lipid metabolism). Second, mice have also been immunologically manipulated by immunization with carboxyethylpyrrole (CEP), an oxidative fragment of DHA found in drusen, and found to present with dry AMD features. Third, natural mouse strains such as arrd2/arrd2 (Mdm gene mutation) and the senescence accelerated mice (SAM) spontaneously develop features of dry AMD like photoreceptor atrophy and thickening of Bruch's membrane. All the aforementioned models develop retinal lesions with various features that simulate dry AMD lesions: focal photoreceptor degeneration, abnormal RPE with increased lipofuscin, basal infolding, decreased melanosomes and degeneration. However, Bruch's membrane changes are less common. Most mice develop retinal lesions at an older age (6-24 months, depending on the models), while the Ccl2(-/-)/cx3cr1(-/-) mice develop lesions by 4-6 weeks. Although murine models present various degrees of retinal and/or RPE degeneration, classical drusen is extremely rare. Using electron microscopy, small drusenoid deposits are found between RPE and Bruch's membrane in a few models including Efemp1(R345W/R345W), Ccl2(-/-)/cx3cr1(-/-), neprilysin(-/-), transgenic mcd/mcd, and ApoE4 transgenic mice on a high fat diet. High A2E levels are measured in the retinas of abcr(-/-), transgenic ELOVL4, and Ccl2(-/-)/cx3cr1(-/-) mice. In summary, murine models provide useful tools for studying AMD pathogenesis and evaluating novel therapies for this disease. This review compares the major dry AMD murine models and discusses retinal pathology at the ultrastructural level.",M2
20206241,"Reaction of Müller cells in an experimental rat model of increased intraocular pressure following timolol, latanoprost and brimonidine.The aim of this study was to evaluate the reaction of Müller cells in an experimental rat model of intraocular pressure (IOP) and their response to treatment with ocular hypotensive drugs. Episcleral vein cauterization in unilateral eyes of Wistar rats was performed to produce elevated IOP. The animals were divided into five groups: control, experimental, and experimental treated with timolol, latanoprost or brimonidine. Histological sections of retina were studied by immunochemistry with antibodies to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), and the percentage of labeled area was measured to evaluate the degree of reactive gliosis. In the experimental group, the Müller cells showed hypertrophy and a significant increase in GFAP (4.39+/-0.32%) in relation to retinas of the control group (2.05+/-0.14%). Gliosis was detected in all three treated groups, with a varying increase in GFAP intensity. The timolol-treated group showed the most intense and persistent glial reactivity after 3 months of treatment (13.89+/-0.63%). Treatment with brimonidine, however, resulted in a decrease in the level of GFAP immunoreactivity (8.37+/-0.4%). The group treated with latanoprost showed the lowest glial reactivity (4.8+/-0.36%). Given that all three drugs are effective hypotensive agents, their neuroprotective effect could be related with other factors, such as gliosis, which, over long periods may have noxious effects on the neurons. Thus, hypotensives like brimonidine, and specially latanoprost, may afford greater neuroprotection to the ganglion cells by attenuating the <e>retinal</e> glial reaction.",M2
20205556,"Circadian modulation of crustacean hyperglycemic hormone in crayfish eyestalk and retina.Previous studies suggested the retina could be a putative locus of daily crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) secretion, as it possesses its own metabolic machinery and is independent of the well-known CHH eyestalk locus responsible for the circadian secretion of this peptide. However, it has been proposed that hemolymph glucose and lactate concentrations play a dual role in the regulation of CHH in crayfish. To elucidate the temporal relationship between these two different CHH production loci and to examine their relationship with glucose regulation, we investigated the expression of CHH daily and circadian rhythms in the eyestalk and retina of crayfish using biochemical methods and time series analysis. We wanted to determine whether (1) putative retina and eyestalk CHH rhythmic expressions are correlated and if the oscillations of the two metabolic products of lactate and glucose in the blood due to CHH action on the target tissue correlate, and (2) retina CHH (RCHH) and the possible <e>retinal</e> substrate glycogen and its product glucose are temporally correlated. We found a negative correlation between daily and circadian changes of relative CHH abundance in the retina and eyestalk. This correlation and the cross-correlation values found between eyestalk CHH and hemolymph and glucose confirm that CHH produced by the X-organ sinus gland complex is under the previously proposed dual feedback control system over the 24 h time period. However, the presence of both glycogen and glucose in the retina, the cross-correlation values found between these parameters and hemolymph lactate and glucose, as well as RCHH and hemolymph and retina metabolic markers suggest RCHH is not under the same temporal metabolic control as eyestalk CHH. Nonetheless, their expression may be linked to common rhythms-generating processes.",M2
20202686,"Accidental macular injury from prolonged viewing of a plasma flash produced by a femtosecond laser.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of macular injury caused by prolonged exposure to a flash from the plasma formed at the focus of a femtosecond laser. DESIGN: Interventional case report. PARTICIPANT: A patient with macular injury caused by sustained observation of the plasma flash produced by a femtosecond laser. INTERVENTION: The patient was examined with complete ophthalmologic evaluation (including Amsler grid test, funduscopy, fluorescein angiography, and optical coherence tomography [OCT]) at 3 hours, 1 month, and 6 months after injury. The injured right eye received a retrobulbar injection of 40 mg triamcinolone acetonide (TransTon), at 4 hours and at 10 days after injury, respectively. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Visual acuity, ophthalmoscopic, and OCT findings. RESULTS: Three hours after injury, the best-corrected visual acuity of the right eye was 20/30 with a very small relative scotoma nasal to fixation. Funduscopy disclosed a well-circumscribed, yellow-white spot lesion located immediately temporal to the foveal center. As time passed, the patient's vision returned to 20/20 and the scotoma and <e>retinal</e> abnormalities had become less prominent, but were still present. In the acute stage, OCT showed a hyperreflective lesion involved all foveal retinal layers. At 1 and 6 months of follow-up, OCT revealed abnormal reflectivity located within the outer foveal retina. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged viewing of a plasma flash induced by a focused femtosecond laser in the air without eye protection may produce persistent damage to the retina. The observed macular injury was probably the result of a combination of thermal and photochemical damage.",M2
20196930,"Ocular manifestations of sickle cell disease.Sickle cell disease (SCD) is the most common genetic disease worldwide. The increase in life expectancy of SCD patients in recent years has led to the emergence of more complications of the disease, e.g. ocular, which in the past were uncommon. This review describes current knowledge of the ocular manifestations of patients with SCD. SCD can affect virtually every vascular bed in the eye and can cause blindness in the advanced stages. The most significant ocular changes are those which occur in the fundus, which can be grouped into proliferative sickle retinopathy, and non-proliferative <e>retinal</e> changes based on the presence of vascular proliferation. This distinction is important because the formation of new vessels is the single most important precursor of potentially blinding complications. Although various systemic complications of SCD are known to be more common in patients with the Hb SS genotype, visual impairment secondary to proliferative sickle retinopathy is more common in patients with the Hb SC genotype. There is also an increase with age in the incidence and prevalence rates of all ocular complications of SCD. It is therefore recommended that all patients with SCD undergo periodic ophthalmological screening from the age of 10 years.",M2
20194762,"Distal axonopathy with structural persistence in glaucomatous neurodegeneration.An early hallmark of neuronal degeneration is distal transport loss and axon pathology. Glaucoma involves the degeneration of <e>retinal</e> ganglion cell (RGC) neurons and their axons in the optic nerve. Here we show that, like other neurodegenerations, distal axon injury appears early in mouse glaucoma. Where RGC axons terminate in the superior colliculus, reduction of active transport follows a retinotopic pattern resembling glaucomatous vision loss. Like glaucoma, susceptibility to transport deficits increases with age and is not necessarily associated with elevated ocular pressure. Transport deficits progress distal-to-proximal, appearing in the colliculus first followed by more proximal secondary targets and then the optic tract. Transport persists through the optic nerve head before finally failing in the retina. Although axon degeneration also progresses distal-to-proximal, myelinated RGC axons and their presynaptic terminals persist in the colliculus well after transport fails. Thus, distal transport loss is predegenerative and may represent a therapeutic target.",M2
20188655,"The immune protein CD3zeta is required for normal development of neural circuits in the retina.Emerging evidence suggests that immune proteins regulate activity-dependent synapse formation in the central nervous system (CNS). Mice with mutations in class I major histocompatibility complex (MHCI) genes have incomplete eye-specific segregation of <e>retinal</e> ganglion cell (RGC) axon projections to the CNS. This effect has been attributed to causes that are nonretinal in origin. We show that a key component of MHCI receptor, CD3zeta, is expressed in RGCs. CD3zeta-deficient mice have reduced RGC dendritic motility, an increase in RGC dendritic density, and a selective defect of glutamate-receptor-mediated synaptic activity in the retina. Disrupted RGC synaptic activity and dendritic motility is associated with a failure of eye-specific segregation of RGC axon projections to the CNS. These results provide direct evidence of an unrecognized requirement for immune proteins in the developmental regulation of RGC synaptic wiring and indicate a possible retinal origin for the disruption of eye-specific segregation found in immune-deficient mice.",M2
20188625,"<e>Retinal</e> origin of phosphenes to transcranial alternating current stimulation.OBJECTIVE: To examine possible retinal contributions to cortically induced phosphenes by transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) involving the visual cortex. METHODS: Self-reported phosphene ratings and voltage-related potentials from the canthus, supra-orbital and sub-orbital regions of the right eye were measured to 2, 10 and 20 Hz tACS at 250 and 1000 microA intensities in healthy volunteers. RESULTS: Qualitatively similar, but more intense phosphenes were reported during frontalis-vertex tACS as compared to occiput-vertex tACS. In addition, voltage-related potentials were recorded at the canthus and orbit regions of the eye during frontalis-vertex, occiput-vertex and occiput-right shoulder tACS. CONCLUSIONS: The experience of phosphenes during tACS involving the visual cortex is influenced by volume conductions effects of the scalp. SIGNIFICANCE: Retinal effects should be taken into account when studying the cortical modulatory effects of tACS.",M2
20188438,"Absence of functional active zone protein Bassoon affects assembly and transport of ribbon precursors during early steps of photoreceptor synaptogenesis.The <e>retinal</e> photoreceptor ribbon synapse is a structurally and functionally unique type of chemical synapse, specialized for tonic release of neurotransmitter in the dark. It is characterized by the presynaptic ribbon, an electron-dense organelle at the active zone, which is covered by hundreds of synaptic vesicles. Recently we showed that photoreceptor ribbon complexes are assembled from non-membranous, spherical densities--the precursor spheres--during the first two postnatal weeks of photoreceptor synaptogenesis. A core component of the precursor spheres and a key player in attaching the ribbon to the active zone is the presynaptic cytomatrix protein Bassoon. In this study, we examined in a comprehensive light and electron microscopic analysis whether Bassoon plays a role in the formation of the precursor spheres using Bassoon mutant mice lacking functional Bassoon. We report that developing Bassoon mutant photoreceptors contain fewer and smaller precursor spheres and that transport of precursor spheres to nascent synapses is delayed compared to wild-type controls. Moreover, western blot analyses of homogenates from postnatal day 0 (P0) to P14 Bassoon mutant retinae exhibit lower RIBEYE and Piccolo protein levels compared to the wild type, indicating elevated protein degradation in the absence of Bassoon. Our findings reveal a novel function of Bassoon in the early formation and delivery of precursor spheres to nascent ribbon synaptic sites in addition to its known role in ribbon anchoring during later stages of photoreceptor ribbon synaptogenesis.",M2
20187850,"Multiple receptor tyrosine kinases are expressed in adult rat <e>retinal</e> ganglion cells as revealed by single-cell degenerate primer polymerase chain reaction.BACKGROUND: To achieve a better understanding of the repertoire of receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) in adult retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) we performed polymerase chain reaction (PCR), using degenerate primers directed towards conserved sequences in the tyrosine kinase domain, on cDNA from isolated single RGCs univocally identified by retrograde tracing from the superior colliculi. RESULTS: All the PCR-amplified fragments of the expected sizes were sequenced, and 25% of them contained a tyrosine kinase domain. These were: Axl, Csf-1R, Eph A4, Pdgfrbeta, Ptk7, Ret, Ros, Sky, TrkB, TrkC, Vegfr-2, and Vegfr-3. Non-RTK sequences were Jak1 and 2. Retinal expression of Axl, Csf-1R, Pdgfrbeta, Ret, Sky, TrkB, TrkC, Vegfr-2, and Vegfr-3, as well as Jak1 and 2, was confirmed by PCR on total retina cDNA. Immunodetection of Csf-1R, Pdgfralpha/beta, Ret, Sky, TrkB, and Vegfr-2 on retrogradely traced retinas demonstrated that they were expressed by RGCs. Co-localization of Vegfr-2 and Csf-1R, of Vegfr-2 and TrkB, and of Csf-1R and Ret in retrogradely labelled RGCs was shown. The effect of optic nerve transection on the mRNA level of Pdgfrbeta, Csf-1R, Vegfr-2, Sky, and Axl, and of the Axl ligands Gas6 and ProteinS, was analysed. These analyses show transection-induced changes in Axl and ProteinS mRNA levels. CONCLUSIONS: The repertoire of RTKs expressed by RGCs is more extensive than previously anticipated. Several of the receptors found in this study, including Pdgfrbeta, Csf-1R, Vegfr-2, Sky, and Axl, and their ligands, have not previously been primarily associated with retinal ganglion cells.",M2
20190693,"Early detection of <e>retinal</e> thickness changes in diabetes using Optical Coherence Tomography.BACKGROUND: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a severe and widely spread eye disease. Thus, an objective test for the early diagnosis and evaluation of treatment in DR is certainly needed. In this study, the ability of intraretinal layer segmentation to locally detect early retinal changes in diabetic patients is assessed using optical coherence tomography (OCT). MATERIAL/METHODS: Fifty diabetic patients with no or minimal DR underwent ophthalmic examination, OCT and fundus photography. Automated segmentation of intraretinal layers of the OCT images was performed using a custom-built algorithm. Mean thickness of the macula and intraretinal layers of patients with no DR (DM) was calculated in the fovea, pericentral and peripheral regions and compared with those in patients with mild DR (MDR). RESULTS: We found reduced retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL) thickness in the pericentral and peripheral regions (27 + or - 2 versus 18 + or - 5 microm and 42 + or - 3 versus 33 + or - 9 microm, respectively, p&lt;0.001) and reduced thickness of ganglion cell/inner plexiform layer (GCL+IPL) complex in the pericentral region of the macula (92 + or - 7 microm versus 80 + or - 10 microm, p&lt;0.001) in the MDR group. Accordingly, macular thickness was reduced in the pericentral and peripheral region of the macula in the MDR group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the view of neurodegeneration in diabetes in the early stage of retinopathy which seems to involve the ganglion cells and cells of the inner plexiform layers (RNFL+GCL+IPL) mostly. Local retinal thickness measures can be obtained from OCT scans using an intraretinal layer segmentation procedure, and these measures could be helpful in finding a surrogate for following development of retinopathy that could affect vision.",M2
20190181,"From combinatorial peptide selection to drug prototype (I): targeting the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor pathway.Inhibition of blood vessel formation is a viable therapeutic approach in angiogenesis-dependent diseases. We previously used a combinatorial screening on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-activated endothelial cells to select the sequence CPQPRPLC and showed that the motif Arg-Pro-Leu targets VEGF receptor-1 and neuropilin-1. Here, we evaluated and validated (D)(LPR), a derivative molecule with strong antiangiogenesis attributes. This prototype drug markedly inhibits neovascularization in three mouse models: Matrigel-based assay, functional human/murine blood vessel formation, and retinopathy of prematurity. In addition to its systemic activity, (D)(LPR) also inhibits <e>retinal</e> angiogenesis when administered in an eye-drop formulation. Finally, in preliminary studies, we have showed targeted drug activity in an experimental tumor-bearing mouse model. These results show that drugs targeting extracellular domains of VEGF receptors are active, affect signal transduction, and have potential for clinical application. On a larger context, this study illustrates the power of ligand-directed selection plus retro-inversion for rapid drug discovery and development.",M2
