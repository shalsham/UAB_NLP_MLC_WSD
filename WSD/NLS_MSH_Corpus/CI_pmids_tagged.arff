20107144,"In a randomized controlled trial of iron fortification, anthelmintic treatment, and intermittent preventive treatment of malaria for anemia control in Ivorian children, only anthelmintic treatment shows modest benefit.Anemia is common among children in sub-Saharan Africa and its etiology is multifactorial. Likely causes of anemia are low bioavailability of dietary iron, malaria, and helminth infection. In this study, we aimed to assess the effect of iron fortification, intermittent preventive treatment (IPT) of malaria, and anthelmintic treatment on hemoglobin concentration and anemia prevalence among school children. The study was a 6-mo, randomized, double-blind, controlled trial enrolling 591 6- to 14-y-old school children in Côte d'Ivoire using the following: 1) iron-fortified biscuits providing an additional 20 mg iron/d as electrolytic iron 4 times/wk; 2) IPT of malaria with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine at 0 and 3 mo; and 3) anthelmintic treatment at 0 and 3 mo as the interventions. Prevalence of anemia, iron deficiency, malaria parasitemia, and helminth infection was 70.4, 9.3, 57.7, and 54.8%, respectively. Iron fortification did not improve iron status, IPT of malaria did not affect malaria burden, and neither had an impact on anemia prevalence. Anthelmintics significantly reduced the burden of helminth infections and decreased anemia prevalence (odds ratio: 0.4, 95% <e>CI</e>: 0.3, 0.7). The low prevalence of iron deficiency and an extended dry season that decreased malaria transmission likely reduced the potential impact of iron fortification and IPT. In this setting, anthelmintic treatment was the only intervention that modestly decreased rates of anemia.",M1
19951316,"Risk behaviors in volunteer blood donors who seroconverted for HIV, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire 1997 to 2005.BACKGROUND: The residual risk of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from blood products in the Abidjan National Blood Transfusion Center was estimated to be 1 in 5780 blood donations over the period 2002 through 2004. We aimed at describing risk behaviors in blood donors who seroconverted for HIV in Abidjan to improve the pre-blood donation selection. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: We investigated the behavioral profile of HIV seroconverters assessed before their HIV diagnosis, during the blood donation selection at the blood bank of Abidjan, and compared it to the profile documented after this HIV diagnosis, at enrollment in the PRIMO-<e>CI</e> cohort. Since 1997, enrollment in this cohort is offered to every blood donor whose delay since HIV seroconversion was 36 months or less. RESULTS: Among the 418 blood donors who seroconverted for HIV between 1997 and 2005, 241 were enrolled in the cohort. Median age was 28 years and 63% were men. The median time between the last HIV-negative test and the first positive test was 7 months. Since the last blood donation, 29% of donors reported unprotected sexual intercourse with multiple casual sexual partners, 55% unprotected sexual intercourse with one casual sexual partner, and 36% sharing of nail clippers. During the pre-blood donation questionnaire, 69% of HIV seroconverters had reported unprotected sexual intercourse since the last blood donation (vs. 89% reported after donation), and 7% had had multiple casual sexual partners (vs. 32%). CONCLUSION: Volunteer blood donors who seroconverted for HIV in Abidjan reported a high proportion of unprotected sexual intercourse with casual sexual partners.",M1
19873851,"[Antibiotics dispensed upon the recommendation of staff in private dispensaries in Abidjan in the Ivory Coast]BACKGROUND: The inappropriate dispensing of antibiotics and inadequate antibiotic treatment leads to the emergence of bacterial resistance. The aim of this study is to assess and describe the antibiotics dispensed upon the recommendation of staff in private pharmacies in Abidjan. It is also a matter of determining whether the information given when the drug is dispensed encourages the correct compliance of the antibiotic treatment by the patients. METHODS: Eighteen private pharmacies were in these private pharmacies was recorded using observation handbooks. Focus groups were set up with staff from the private pharmacies with the aim of better understanding of the actions observed. In the study, only antibiotics administered in systemic way were taken into account. RESULTS: One thousand one hundred and twenty-three purchases of antibiotics were observed in total, 158 of which were dispensed upon the recommendation of staff in the private pharmacies (14.1%) [95% <e>CI</e> = 12.1-16.3%]. Penicillin, co-trimoxazole and macrolides constituted the most frequently recommended groups of antibiotics. Compared with the assistants, the pharmacists recommended antibiotics more frequently to customers. The three main groups of symptoms leading to the dispensing of antibiotics upon recommendation were respiratory, gastro-intestinal and cutaneous symptoms. The staff in private pharmacies almost systematically recommended antibiotics for loose coughs lasting more than three days without taking into account the customer's age, general condition and extra-respiratory signs. The duration of the antibiotic treatment was clearly given in 25 cases (15.8%) and information telling customers to take antibiotics at mealtimes was only given on exceptional occasions. It transpired from the meetings conducted with pharmacy staff that there were indirect financial incentives, known as  Unités Gratuites , offered by the medical reps from certain pharmaceutical laboratories, encouraging the excessive dispensing of antibiotics. CONCLUSION: The staff in private pharmacies in Abidjan advise customers to take antibiotics even though they are prescription-only drugs. This leads to the inappropriate dispensing of antibiotics. Some information essential for the correct compliance of the treatment by patients, such as the duration of the treatment and taking it at mealtimes, are often omitted. Educational interventions aimed at pharmacy staff and measures encouraging the application of the law on the sale of antibiotics, are necessary to improve the dispensing of these drugs in private pharmacies in Abidjan.",M1
19861019,"Tobacco use and its determinants in HIV-infected patients on antiretroviral therapy in West African countries.BACKGROUND: Tobacco smoking is common in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected patients from industrialised countries. In West Africa, few data concerning tobacco consumption exist. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey of the International Epidemiological Database to Evaluate AIDS (IeDEA) network in West Africa was conducted. Health workers administered a questionnaire assessing tobacco and cannabis consumption among patients receiving antiretroviral treatment. Regular smokers were defined as current smokers who smoked &gt;1 cigarette per day for &gt;or=1 year. RESULTS: Overall, 2920 patients were enrolled in three countries. The prevalence of ever smokers and regular smokers were respectively 46.2% (95%<e>CI</e> 42.8-49.5) and 15.6% (95%CI 13.2-18.0) in men and 3.7% (95%CI 2.9-4.5) and 0.6% (95%CI 0.3-0.9) in women. Regular smoking was associated with being from Côte d'Ivoire or Mali compared to Benin (OR 4.6, 95%CI 2.9-7.3 and 7.7, 95%CI 4.4-13.6), severely impaired immunological status at highly active antiretroviral treatment initiation (OR 1.5, 95%CI 1.1-2.2) and history of tuberculosis (TB; OR 1.8, 95%CI 1.1-3.0). CONCLUSION: There are marked differences in smoking prevalence among these West African countries. This survey approach also provides proof of the association between cigarette smoking and TB in HIV-infected patients, a major public health issue in this part of the world.",M1
19745754,"Comparison of early CD4 T-cell count in HIV-1 seroconverters in Côte d'Ivoire and France: the ANRS PRIMO-<e>CI</e> and SEROCO cohorts.OBJECTIVE: We compared CD4+ decline among untreated HIV-1-infected seroconverters living in Côte d'Ivoire (CI) and in France. METHODS: HIV-1-infected adults were enrolled in the ANRS1220 PRIMO-CI (CI, 1997-2006) and ANRSCO2 SEROCO (France, 1988-1995) cohorts. CD4+ count and percentage declines were estimated from enrollment until 24 months of seroconversion by linear random-effect models adjusted for time since seroconversion, age, gender, cell-associated HIV DNA, HIV RNA, and country. RESULTS: Overall 521 seroconverters (CI 148, 62% men; France 373, 77% men) were enrolled after a median of 7.6 months since seroconversion. Median follow-up duration was 12.7 months. Median age was 28 years. Median baseline CD4+ count was 472 and 560 cells per cubic millimeter, respectively. Median baseline HIV RNA was 4.4 and 4.0 log10 copies per milliliter and median HIV DNA was 3.0 and 2.8 log10 copies per 10(6) peripheral blood mononuclear cells, respectively. In adjusted models, CD4+ count and percentage at baseline were lower in CI than in France (P &lt; 0.01), and the difference did not vary during follow-up (P = 0.55). Low HIV RNA and low HIV DNA at baseline were associated with higher CD4+ count at baseline. CONCLUSIONS: CD4+ count and percentage were lower in CI than in France. These differences were already observed during early infection and remained similar after adjustment.",M1
19393976,"[In vitro activity of different fungicides on the growth in Mycosphaerella fijiensis var. difformis Stover and Dickson, Cladosporium musae Morelet and Deightoniella torulosa (Syd.) Ellis, isolated parasites of the banana phyllosphere in the Ivory Coast.]In Côte-d'Ivoire, banana leaf surfaces are attacked by Mycosphaerella fijiensis var. difformis, Cladosporium musae, and Deigthonielle torulosa. Control is based on fungicides recommanded for Mycosphaerella fijiensis. Fungicides belonging to triazoles and strobilurines types were added, at different concentrations, to the PDA medium, using this PDA medium containing no fungicide as the control. Mycelium disc and spores of Cladosporium musae, Mycosphaerella fijiensis and Deightoniella torulosa were put on the different media. Total inhibition of mycelium growth of every fungus on the PDA amended with propiconazole was observed. The fungicides used show different activities according to their concentration and their mode of action. The application of a fungicide should talke into account the pathogenic fungus involved in the leaf attacked. Against Mycosphaerella fijiensis var. difformis, the <e>Ci</e>(50) are different according to the concentrations (0.44 to 1.06 ppm). Correlations ranked from 0.71 to 0.91 are also different according to fungicide used. The Ci(50) of Cladosporium musae (0.10 to 2.44 ppm) and Deightoniella torulosa (0.26 to 0.52 ppm) are different and their correlations are respectively 0.78 to 0.99 and 0.86 to 0.95. An assessment of the sensitivity of parasitic fungi of banana can be made by mycelium growth measurement of fungi isolated from resistance zones.",M1
19304422,"[Contraceptive use and incidence of pregnancy among women after HIV testing in Abidjan, Ivory Coast]BACKGROUND: Within the framework of programs for the prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission, women who discover their HIV-infection during their pregnancy receive perinatal interventions in order to reduce the risk of HIV transmission to the child. They also receive family planning counselling and free contraceptives in order to avoid a new pregnancy. In this study, we compared contraceptive use and pregnancy incidence between HIV-positive and HIV-negative women who were offered HIV counselling and testing during a program of prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission. METHODS: In the Ditrame Plus program in Abidjan, 546 HIV-positive and 393 HIV-negative women were HIV-tested prenatally and followed up 2 years after delivery. At each post-partum visit, proportions of contraceptive use were noted, by method. The pregnancy incidence was calculated as the number of pregnancies for 100 women-years at risk. Factors related to the arrival of a new pregnancy were analyzed by Cox model. RESULTS: Between 6 and 24 months post-partum, proportions of women using modern contraception varied from 52 to 65% among HIV-positive women, and from 65 to 75% among HIV-negative women. Pregnancy incidence for 100 women-years at risk was 5.70 (95%<e>CI</e>: 4.17-7.23) and 4.37 (95%CI : 2.83-5.91) (p=0.237) and unwanted pregnancy incidence was 1.07 (95%CI: 0.41-1.73) and 2.39 (95%CI: 1.25-3.53) (p=0.023), respectively among HIV-positive and HIV-negative women. The end of post-partum abstinence, the death of the index child and the end of breastfeeding were positively linked to the arrival of a new pregnancy in the post-partum period. CONCLUSION: Among these women prenatally HIV-tested, family planning counselling and regular follow-up was accompanied by a high rate of contraceptive use after delivery, and consecutively to a low pregnancy incidence irrespective of serostatus. In particular, HIV-positive women had fewer unwanted pregnancies than HIV-negative women. Integration of adequate family planning services in the post-partum follow-up in prevention programs plays an important role in reducing the risk of mother-to-child transmission, by reducing pregnancies among HIV-positive women.",M1
19087306,"Sexual abstinence behavior among never-married youths in a generalized HIV epidemic country: evidence from the 2005 Côte d'Ivoire AIDS indicator survey.BACKGROUND: Sexual abstinence is the best available option for preventing both pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections, including HIV/AIDS. Identifying the factors associated with sexual abstinence among youths would have meaningful implications in a generalized HIV epidemic country such as the Côte d'Ivoire. Thus, we explored sexual abstinence behavior among never-married individuals aged 15 to 24 in Côte d'Ivoire and assessed factors that predict sexual abstinence. METHODS: We obtained data from the nationally representative and population-based 2005 Côte d'Ivoire AIDS Indicator Survey, conducted from September 2004 to October 2005. Our sample included 3041 never-married people aged 15 to 24. Of these, 990 reported never having sexual intercourse (primary abstinence) and 137 reported sexual experience but not in the 12 months prior to the survey (secondary abstinence). In all, 1127 youths reported sexual abstinence practice. RESULTS: Of the 3041 never-married youths, 54.4% were male and 45.6% were female. About 33.0%, 6.7%, and 37.1% of them were practicing primary, secondary, and sexual abstinence behavior, respectively. Females of higher education level were significantly 11.14 times as likely as those of no education to practice either primary or secondary abstinence. Males who were animists, had no religion, or were practicing religions other than Christianity or Muslim were significantly less likely than other male youths to practice sexual abstinence (OR = 0.53, 95% <e>CI</e> = 0.30-0.95). Living in the north-west region of the country significantly decreased the odds of sexual abstinence among female youths. Similarly, female youths living in rural areas were significantly 0.42 times as likely as those in the urban zones to practice sexual abstinence. CONCLUSION: HIV/AIDS prevention program components could include media campaigns, educational intervention improvement, as well as promoting policies that shape female youth livelihoods. Likewise, youth involvement in initiatives to design appropriate messages, and activities to promote positive behaviors or to change negative perceptions could impact on youths' decision to exert abstinence behavior.",M1
18986246,"Two-months-off, four-months-on antiretroviral regimen increases the risk of resistance, compared with continuous therapy: a randomized trial involving West African adults.BACKGROUND: A randomized trial was launched in Côte d'Ivoire in 2002 to compare continuous antiretroviral treatment (hereafter,  C-ART ) to an ART regimen of 2 months off and 4 months on therapy (hereafter,  2/4-ART ). We report the final analysis. METHODS: A total of 435 adults who were receiving successful ART ((median CD4 cell count prior to ART, 272 cells/mm(3); 88% were receiving a zidovudine-lamivudine-efavirenz regimen) were randomized to receive C-ART or 2/4-ART. The main primary end point was the percentage of patients with &lt;350 CD4 cells/mm(3) at 24 months. The sample size ensured 80% power to demonstrate noninferiority (noninferiority bound, -15%), assuming that 30% of the patients in the C-ART arm would have &lt;350 CD4 cells/mm(3). Other end points were mortality, morbidity, cost of care, genotypic resistance, adherence, and toxicity. RESULTS: The percentage of patients with &lt;350 CD4 cells/mm(3) at 24 months was 5.6% (6 of 107) in the C-ART arm and 14.6% (46 of 315) in the 2/4-ART arm (lower bound of the 95% <e>CI</e> for the difference, -14%). Cost was 18% higher in the C-ART arm, and resistance to nonnucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs) was 20% higher in the 2/4-ART arm. Other end points were nonconclusive. CONCLUSIONS: Although 2/4-ART met the predetermined criteria for noninferiority, the percentage of patients with &lt;350 CD4 cells/mm(3) in the C-ART arm was lower than anticipated, which makes the clinical significance of this noninferiority uncertain. In addition, 2/4-ART led to an unacceptable additional risk of selecting for drug-resistant virus. This new argument against episodic ART strategies is also a caveat against any unplanned ART interruptions in Africa, where most patients receive NNRTIs.",M1
18814048,"Tobacco smoking and chewing as risk factors for multiple human papillomavirus infections and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions in two countries (Côte d'Ivoire and Finland) with different tobacco exposure.Our objective was to compare the association between tobacco smoking and chewing and the risk of multiple human papillomavirus (HPV) infections and cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) in two populations with different tobacco exposure. We studied 2,162 women from Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa, and 419 women from Finland, Northern Europe, with baseline data on cervical screening, HPV DNA status and smoking and chewing habits. The proportion of women who smoked and/or chewed tobacco was higher in Finland (36.8%) than in Côte d'Ivoire (3.7%), where tobacco chewing (2.6%) was more common than tobacco smoking (1.4%). Having multiple HPV infections was common in HPV16 and/or 18-infected women (60.4% in Finland and 47.2% in Côte d'Ivoire). There was no increased risk of multiple HPV infections among tobacco consumers. We found that women &gt;or=30 years of age exposed to tobacco through smoking in Finland (OR: 2.2, 95% <e>CI</e>: 0.5-8.7) and chewing in Côte d'Ivoire (OR: 5.5, 95% CI: 2.1-14) had a moderately or highly increased risk of high-grade SIL, respectively. In the latter, the risk was statistically significant. Our findings emphasize the need for health initiatives targeted to prevent tobacco smoking or chewing among women especially in less industrialized countries.",M1
18753864,"Antiretroviral therapy in pregnant women with advanced HIV disease and pregnancy outcomes in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.BACKGROUND: Pregnancy outcomes in women receiving highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) in Africa are not well described. METHODS: HIV-1-infected pregnant women in the ANRS Ditrame Plus and the MTCT-Plus projects were included. Between March 2001 and July 2003, when HAART was not yet available, women eligible for HAART received a short-course antiretroviral regimen, zidovudine (ZDV) or (ZDV + lamivudine) and single dose of nevirapine for preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT group). Between August 2003 and August 2007, eligible women for HAART received it (HAART group). The frequencies of low birth weight (LBW) (&lt;2500 g), stillbirth and infant mortality are reported. Risk factors associated with LBW were investigated using a logistic regression model. RESULTS: Of the 326 HIV-infected pregnant women, 175 women received short-course antiretroviral (median CD4 cell count 177 cells/microl) and 151 received HAART (median CD4 cell count 182 cells/microl). At 12 months, three paediatric infections (2.3%) occurred in the HAART group vs. 25 (16.1%) in the PMTCT group (P &lt; 0.001). The rate of LBW was 22.3% in the HAART group and 12.4% in the PMTCT group (P = 0.02). In multivariable analysis (n = 309), after adjustment on maternal CD4 cell count, WHO stage, age and maternal BMI, HAART initiated before pregnancy [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.88, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 1.10-7.51] and during pregnancy (adjusted OR 2.12, 95% CI 1.15-4.65) and maternal BMI at delivery (adjusted OR 2.43, 95% CI 1.20-4.91) were associated with LBW. CONCLUSION: HAART in pregnant African women with advanced HIV disease substantially reduced mother-to-child transmission, but was associated with LBW.",M1
18593341,"Virologic and immunologic response to antiretroviral therapy and predictors of HIV type 1 drug resistance in children receiving treatment in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.We describe changes in HIV-1 viral load, CD4+ T cell percentage, and incidence of drug resistance and factors associated with drug resistance for 134 children receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) for approximately 1 year in Abidjan. Between August 1998 and September 2003, ART was initiated for 395 HIV-infected children ages 0-15 years in the Côte d'Ivoire national drug access initiative. All 1-year samples with detectable HIV RNA &gt;1000 copies/ml were tested for HIV-1 drug resistance and changes in viral load and CD4+ T cell counts were also determined. At treatment initiation, 80% of children had CD4+ T cell percentages &lt;15% and a median viral RNA load of 5.6 log copies/ml. The median age at treatment initiation was 7 years with only 25% of patients less than 4 years of age. Of the 134 children receiving therapy, 72 (54%) had undetectable viral load. The estimated 1-year viral load decline was 1.9 log10 copies/ml and the CD4+ T cell percentage increase was 10.9%. The estimated 1-year cumulative probability for developing any class of drug resistance was 0.44 (95% <e>CI</e>, 0.35, 0.53). In a multivariate analysis, the magnitude of virologic response to therapy was inversely associated with development of drug resistance. Children with less CD4+ T cell rise from baseline values and the use of dual therapy were also associated with the development of drug resistance. Guidelines are needed for the treatment of pediatric HIV infection in Africa in order to minimize the occurrence of drug resistance and enhance better virologic, immunologic, and clinical outcomes.",M1
18545149,"HIV-1 DNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells is strongly associated with HIV-1 disease progression in recently infected West African adults.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association between the HIV-1 DNA level in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and disease progression in recently infected West African adults. METHODS: HIV-1 DNA levels were measured in the PBMCs of 200 adults in the French National Agency for Research on AIDS and viral Hepatitis (ANRS) 1220 cohort who had recently been infected with HIV-1. The association between baseline HIV-1 DNA levels and disease progression was analyzed using multivariate Cox regression. Disease progression was defined as the occurrence of any of the following outcomes: death, first World Health Organization stage 3-4 event, or CD4 count&lt;200/mm. RESULTS: About 200 participants were followed for a median of 30 months. At baseline, the median time from HIV-1 seroconversion was 9 months, median CD4 T-cell count was 471/mm, median HIV-1 DNA level was 3.0 log10 copies/10 PBMCs, and median plasma HIV-1 RNA level was 4.6 log10 copies/mL. The 5-year probability of remaining free of any outcome was 0.74 [95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 0.61 to 0.83] and 0.36 (95% CI: 0.23 to 0.49) in patients with baseline HIV-1 DNA&lt;or=3.0 and &gt;3.0 log10 copies/10 PBMCs, respectively (P&lt;0.001). The adjusted hazard ratio of disease progression was 2.17 in patients with HIV-1 DNA&gt;3.0 log10 copies/10 PBMCs compared with other patients (95% CI: 1.24 to 3.80, P=0.007). The only other factor associated with progression was follow-up CD4 count (hazard ratio=1.23 per 100 cells/mm decrease; 95% CI: 1.07 to 1.41, P=0.003). DISCUSSION: PBMC HIV-1 DNA level was strongly associated with HIV-1 disease progression, even after adjusting for HIV-1 RNA and CD4 T-cell count. Further studies should assess whether patients with high HIV-1 DNA levels should start antiretroviral therapy earlier than other patients.",M1
18541325,"Full genome sequences of two virulent strains of peste-des-petits ruminants virus, the Côte d'Ivoire 1989 and Nigeria 1976 strains.Peste-des-petits ruminants virus (PPRV) causes acute febrile illness in both farmed and wild small ruminants, with associated mortality rates of 50-80%. PPRV is a member of the Morbillivirus genus within the Paramyxovirus family and although there are many full length genome sequences available for members of this family, their availability for PPRV in particular is limited. We have determined the full length sequences representing two virulent strains of PPRV, the Côte d'Ivoire 1989 (<e>CI</e>/89) and Nigeria 1976 (Ng76/1) strains. We present an alignment of the promoter regions of these viruses with other available PPRV promoter sequences and have identified domains in PPRV proteins believed to be critical for paramyxovirus promoter attenuation. We have also analysed the proteins of these viruses, comparing them to other available PPRV protein sequences and identified motifs that were previously recognised as being required for the function of other paramyxovirus proteins.",M1
18492259,"18-month occurrence of severe events among early diagnosed HIV-infected children before antiretroviral therapy in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: a cohort study.OBJECTIVE: To assess the 18-month field effectiveness on severe events of a pediatric package combining early HIV-diagnosis and targeted cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in HIV-infected children from age six-week before the antiretroviral era, in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: Data from two consecutive prevention of HIV mother-to-child transmission programs were compared: the ANRS 1201/1202 Ditrame-Plus cohort (2001-2005) and the pooled data of the ANRS 049a Ditrame randomized trial and its following open-labeled cohort (1995-2000), used as a reference group. HIV-infected pregnant women &gt; or = 32-36 weeks of gestation were offered a short-course peri-partum antiretroviral prophylaxis (ZDV in Ditrame, and ZDV +/- 3TC+single-dose (sd) NVP in Ditrame-Plus). Neonatal prophylaxis was provided in Ditrame-Plus only: 7-day ZDV and sdNVP 48-72 h after birth. A 6-week pediatric HIV-RNA diagnosis was provided on-line in the Ditrame-Plus while it was only oriented on clinical symptoms in Ditrame. Six-week HIV-infected children received a daily cotrimoxazole prophylaxis in Ditrame-Plus while no prophylaxis was provided in Ditrame. The determinants of severe events (death or hospitalization &gt; 1 day) were assessed in a Cox regression model. RESULTS: Between 1995 and 2003, 98 out of the 1121 live-births were diagnosed as HIV-infected in peri-partum: 45 from Ditrame-Plus and 53 from Ditrame. The 18-month Kaplan-Meier cumulative probability of presenting a severe event was 66% in Ditrame-Plus (95% confidence interval [95%<e>CI</e>]: 50%-81%) and 77% in Ditrame (95%CI: 65%-89%), Log Rank test: p = 0.47. After adjustment on maternal WHO clinical stage, maternal death, 6-week pediatric viral load, birth-weight, and breastfeeding exposure, the 18-month risk of severe event was lower in Ditrame-Plus than in Ditrame (adjusted Hazard Ratio (aHR): 0.55, 95%CI: 0.3-1.1), although the difference was not statistically significant; p = 0.07). Maternal death was the only variable determinant of the occurrence of severe events in children (aHR: 3.73; CI: 2.2-11.2; p = 0.01). CONCLUSION: Early cotrimoxazole from 6 weeks of age in HIV-infected infants seemed to reduce probability of severe events but the study lacked statistical power to prove this. Even with systematic cotrimoxazole prophylaxis, infant morbidity and mortality remained high pointing towards a need for early pediatric HIV-diagnosis and antiretroviral treatment in Africa.",M1
18436354,"A non-randomized vaccine effectiveness trial of accelerated infant hepatitis B immunization schedules with a first dose at birth or age 6 weeks in Côte d'Ivoire.Most African countries do not initiate hepatitis B vaccination at birth. We conducted a non-randomized controlled trial comparing hepatitis B vaccination given at age 0, 6, and 14 weeks versus the current Côte d'Ivoire schedule of 6, 10, and 14 weeks. Pregnant women were enrolled at four health centers in Abidjan. At age 9 months, 0.5% of infants in both the birth and 6-week cohorts were positive for HBsAg and all were born to HBeAg-positive women. Among infants of HBeAg-positive mothers, 9 of 24 (37.5%) in the birth cohort and 10 of 17 (58.8%) in the 6-week cohort were HBsAg positive (adjusted OR, 2.7; 95% <e>CI</e>: 0.7-11.0). While both vaccine schedules prevented most cases of infant HBV transmission, both also had high failure rates among infants of HBeAg-positive mothers. African infants may benefit from a birth dose but additional studies are needed to verify this hypothesis.",M1
18197758,"Maternal 12-month response to antiretroviral therapy following prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV type 1, Ivory Coast, 2003-2006.OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to study the response to antiretroviral treatment among women exposed to single-dose nevirapine (NVP) and/or short-course zidovudine (ZDV; with or without lamivudine [3TC]) for the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. METHODS: All HIV type 1-infected women who initiated antiretroviral treatment with stavudine or ZDV, 3TC, and NVP or efavirenz were eligible for the MTCT-Plus program in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Exposed women had received either single-dose NVP alone or short-course ZDV (with or without 3TC) plus single-dose NVP during previous pregnancy. Genotypic resistance testing was performed at week 4 after delivery. Virologic failure was defined as a plasma HIV RNA level &gt;500 copies/mL 12 months after initiation of antiretroviral treatment. RESULTS: Among 247 women who received antiretroviral treatment, 109 (44%) were unexposed; 81 had received short-course ZDV with 3TC, as well as single-dose NVP; 5 had received short-course ZDV plus 3TC; 50 had received short-course ZDV plus single-dose NVP; and 2 had received single-dose NVP alone. No ZDV mutation was detected in the 115 women whose specimens were available for genotypic testing; 11 (15.1%) of 73 women with 3TC exposure who were tested after delivery had 3TC resistance mutations. Three (4.3%) of 69 women exposed to short-course ZDV and 3TC plus single-dose NVP and 16 (38.1%) of 42 women exposed to short-course ZDV plus single-dose NVP had NVP resistance mutations. Antiretroviral treatment was initiated a median of 21 months after the intervention to prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission (median CD4(+) T lymphocyte count, 188 cells/mm(3)). Month 12 virologic failure was identified in 42 (19.2%) of 219 women for whom data were available, and multivariate analysis revealed that it was associated with poor adherence to treatment (adjusted odds ratio [aOR], 12.7; 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 3.0-53.9), postpartum 3TC resistance mutations (aOR, 6.9; 95% CI, 1.1-42.9), and a baseline CD4(+) T lymphocyte count &lt;200 cells/mm(3) (aOR, 0.3; 95% CI, 0.2-0.8). NVP resistance was not associated with virological failure (aOR, 1.8; 95% CI, 0.5-6.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our study found that poor adherence and 3TC resistance acquired after the intervention to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV infection were associated with virologic failure in women who initiated antiretroviral treatment.",M1
18190955,"Early mixed feeding and breastfeeding beyond 6 months increase the risk of postnatal HIV transmission: ANRS 1201/1202 Ditrame Plus, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the risk of postnatal HIV transmission among women in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire offered alternatives to prolonged breastfeeding, and to assess the impact of the breastfeeding pattern and duration on this risk. METHODS: In 2001-2003, HIV-infected pregnant women received peri-partum antiretroviral prophylaxis and were counselled antenatally regarding infant feeding options: formula feeding or exclusive breastfeeding with early cessation from 4 months of age. The primary outcome was HIV postnatal transmission by 18 months of age, defined by a positive HIV test after a negative test &gt; or =30 days. The effect of the pattern (mixed feeding, defined as breastmilk plus food-based fluid, solid food or non-human milk) and duration (less vs. more than 6 months) of breastfeeding on postnatal transmission was assessed. RESULTS: Of 622 live-born infants who were HIV uninfected at or after 30 days, 15 were infected postnatally, 13/324 among breastfed, and 2/298 among formula-fed infants. The 18-month probability of remaining free from HIV infection was 0.95 [95% <e>CI</e>, 0.92-0.97] and 0.99 [95% CI, 0.97-1.00] in the breastfeeding and formula-feeding groups respectively (p&lt;0.001). In adjusted analysis, breastfeeding for more than 6 months and mixed feeding during the first month of life were independently associated with a 7.5 (AOR 95% CI, 2.0-28.2, p=0.003)- and a 6.3 (95% CI, 1.1-36.4, p=0.04)-fold increase of postnatal transmission among breastfed children. CONCLUSIONS: Mixed feeding during the first month of life and breastfeeding beyond 6 months are strong determinants of HIV transmission and should be avoided when replacement feeding after breastfeeding cessation can be safely and sustainably provided.",M1
18186569,"Child-Pugh-Turcott versus Meld score for predicting survival in a retrospective cohort of black African cirrhotic patients.AIM: To compare the performance of the Child-Pugh-Turcott (CPT) score to that of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) score in predicting survival of a retrospective cohort of 172 Black African patients with cirrhosis on a short and mid-term basis. METHODS: Univariate and multivariate (Cox model) analyses were used to identify factors related to mortality. Relationship between the two scores was appreciated by calculating the correlation coefficient. The Kaplan Meier method and the log rank test were used to elaborate and compare survival respectively. The Areas Under the Curves were used to compare the performance between scores at 3, 6 and 12 mo. RESULTS: The study population comprised 172 patients, of which 68.9% were male. The mean age of the patient was 47.5 +/- 13 years. Hepatitis B virus infection was the cause of cirrhosis in 70% of the cases. The overall mortality was 31.4% over 11 years of follow up. Independent factors significantly associated with mortality were: CPT score (HR = 3.3, 95% <e>CI</e> [1.7-6.2]) (P &lt; 0.001) (stage C vs stage A-B); Serum creatine (HR = 2.5, 95% CI [1.4-4.3]) (P = 0.001) (Serum creatine &gt; 1.5 mg/dL versus serum creatine &lt; 1.5 mg/dL); MELD score (HR = 2.9, 95% CI [1.63-5.21]) (P &lt; 0.001) (MELD &gt; 21 vs MELD &lt; 21). The area under the curves (AUC) that predict survival was 0.72 and 0.75 at 3 mo (P = 0.68), 0.64 and 0.62 at 6 mo (P = 0.67), 0.69 and 0.64 at 12 mo (P = 0.38) respectively for the CPT score and the MELD score. CONCLUSION: The CPT score displays the same prognostic significance as does the MELD score in black African patients with cirrhosis. Moreover, its handling appears less cumbersome in clinical practice as compared to the latter.",M1
18171303,"Frequent occurrence of chronic hepatitis B virus infection among West African HIV type-1-infected children.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study, conducted in Ivory Coast, was to evaluate the prevalence and evolution of viral hepatitis in children coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1). METHODS: Hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) markers were retrospectively and longitudinally assessed among 280 HIV-1-infected children enrolled in the Agence Nationale de Recherches sur le SIDA et les Hépatites Virales B et C 1244/1278 cohort. Among these, 173 (61.8%) received highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), including lamivudine (3TC) for 122 children. Detection of the hepatitis B s antigen (HBsAg) was performed on specimens collected at inclusion and 6 months later. If results of both tests were positive, hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg)/hepatitis B e antibody (HBeAb) and HBV DNA levels were measured at inclusion and during follow-up. A fourth-generation HCV enzyme immunoassay was used for HCV screening at inclusion. RESULTS: In our pediatric cohort, no patients were infected with HCV, but the prevalence of HBsAg at inclusion was 12.1% (34 of 280; 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 8.6-16.6). Among the HBV-HIV-1-coinfected children, a high rate of positive HBeAg chronic hepatitis B (CHB) was noted at inclusion (82.4% [ 28 of 34]; 95% CI, 65.5%-93.2%) and after a median follow-up of 18 months (78.3%; 95% CI, 45.5%-92.7%), with no significant difference between children treated with HAART (with or without 3TC) and untreated ones. These children showed high HBV DNA levels (usually &gt;8.0 log(10) copies/mL) and viral population consisting of nearly exclusively wild-type HBeAg-positive HBV strains, strongly suggesting that most of them were in the initial immunotolerant phase of chronic hepatitis B. CONCLUSION: In sub-Saharan Africa, children with chronic hepatitis B and who are treated with 3TC-based HAART are at risk of developing 3TC resistance. Further studies are required to guide the management of HBV-HIV-1-coinfected children.",M1
18048000,"[Characteristics of potential living kidney donors in Ivory Coast: a survey prior to a project of kidney transplantation in French Black Africa]The source of living kidney donors in the general population remains underused. The present study aims at assessing the prevalence and the characteristics of potential living kidney donors in Ivory Coast in a view of a project of kidney transplantation in French Black Africa. A survey was undertaken in Abidjan from 30 June to 7 July 2006. Nine hundred (and) sixty-two subjects living in the capital and aged between 19 and 64 years old were randomly chosen using data from the 1998 population census. Subjects were asked their age, gender, nationality, marital status, information on kidney graft and renal failure, and their willingness to donate kidney to a relative or friend for transplantation purpose. Seventy per cent of the population study appeared favourable to kidney donation. Potentials living kidney donors have displayed following characteristics: age inferior to 26 years old [OR=2.08, P&lt;0.02, 95%<e>CI</e>: 1.10-3.92]; Ivorians national [OR=2.72, P&lt;0.002, 95% CI 1.42-5.21]; having heard of kidney transplantation (OR=1.89, P&lt;0.047, 95% CI 1-3.54]); the death of a relative or friend from renal failure [OR=1.82, P&lt;0.002, 95% CI 1.25 2.67].

17974361,"Outbreak of beriberi in a prison in Côte d'Ivoire.BACKGROUND: A beriberi outbreak occurred in the Maison d'Arrêt et de Correction d'Abidjan (MACA), a detention center in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, between October 2002 and April 2003. OBJECTIVE: A retrospective investigation was conducted to document the outbreak in April 2003. METHODS: A descriptive analysis and a case-control study were performed. A probable case patient was defined as a person detained in the center between October 2002 and April 2003 with at least two of the following symptoms: bilateral leg edema, dyspnea, positive squat test, motor deficiencies, and paresthesia. A definite case patient was defined as a probable case patient who showed clinical improvement under thiamin treatment. RESULTS: Of 712 cases reported, 115 (16%) were probable and 597 (84%) were definite. The overall attack rate was 14.1%, and the case fatality rate was 1.0% (7/712). The highest attack rate was reported in the building housing prisoners with long-term sentences (16.9%). All patients were male, and the mean age was 28 years. During the period studied, the penal ration provided a fifth of the quantity of thiamin recommended by international standards. After adjustment for potential confounders, a history of cholera infection (adjusted odds ratio [OR(a)], 12.9; 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 2.9 to 54.1) and incarceration in the building for severe penalties (OR(a), 4.8; 95% CI, 1.3 to 18.5) were associated with the disease. CONCLUSIONS: Beriberi has been underreported among prisoners. Further attention should be given to its risk factors, especially a history of acute diarrhea. Systematic food supplementation with vitamins and micronutrients should be discussed when the penal ration does not provide the necessary nutrient intake recommended according to international standards.",M1
17713983,"Antiretroviral treatment and prevention of peripartum and postnatal HIV transmission in West Africa: evaluation of a two-tiered approach.BACKGROUND: Highly active antiretroviral treatment (HAART) has only been recently recommended for HIV-infected pregnant women requiring treatment for their own health in resource-limited settings. However, there are few documented experiences from African countries. We evaluated the short-term (4 wk) and long-term (12 mo) effectiveness of a two-tiered strategy of prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) in Africa: women meeting the eligibility criteria of the World Health Organization (WHO) received HAART, and women with less advanced HIV disease received short-course antiretroviral (scARV) PMTCT regimens. METHODS AND FINDINGS: The MTCT-Plus Initiative is a multi-country, family-centred HIV care and treatment program for pregnant and postpartum women and their families. Pregnant women enrolled in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire received either HAART for their own health or short-course antiretroviral (scARV) PMTCT regimens according to their clinical and immunological status. Plasma HIV-RNA viral load (VL) was measured to diagnose peripartum infection when infants were 4 wk of age, and HIV final status was documented either by rapid antibody testing when infants were aged &gt; or = 12 mo or by plasma VL earlier. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate the rate of HIV transmission and HIV-free survival. Between August 2003 and June 2005, 107 women began HAART at a median of 30 wk of gestation, 102 of them with zidovudine (ZDV), lamivudine (3TC), and nevirapine (NVP) and they continued treatment postpartum; 143 other women received scARV for PMTCT, 103 of them with sc(ZDV+3TC) with single-dose NVP during labour. Most (75%) of the infants were breast-fed for a median of 5 mo. Overall, the rate of peripartum HIV transmission was 2.2% (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>] 0.3%-4.2%) and the cumulative rate at 12 mo was 5.7% (95% CI 2.5%-9.0%). The overall probability of infant death or infection with HIV was 4.3% (95% CI 1.7%-7.0%) at age week 4 wk and 11.7% (95% CI 7.5%-15.9%) at 12 mo. CONCLUSIONS: This two-tiered strategy appears to be safe and highly effective for short- and long-term PMTCT in resource-constrained settings. These results indicate a further benefit of access to HAART for pregnant women who need treatment for their own health.",M1
17690579,"Determinants of adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy among HIV-1-infected patients in Côte d'Ivoire.OBJECTIVE: To assess adherence to HAART and to determine factors associated with poor adherence among HIV-1-infected patients in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: A prospective observational study of 614 consecutive patients attending an HIV/AIDS outpatient clinic. Adherence was measured twice at 3-month intervals by self-report of missing doses over 4 days. An adherence level of less than 95% was defined as poor adherence. We used generalized estimating equation models for binomial distribution with repeated measures for data analysis. RESULTS: Of the 591 subjects who completed the study, 74.3% reported adherence levels of 95% or greater. Six factors were independently related to poor adherence: age less than 35 years [relative risk (RR) 1.45; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 1.17-1.79], absence of social support (RR 1.66; 95% CI 1.24-2.24), number of daily pills 10 or more (RR 1.47; 95% CI 1.14-1.91), time of adherence assessment (first versus second time assessment RR 1.36; 95% CI 1.12-1.66), CD4 cell count of 250 cells/mul or greater (RR 1.43; 95% CI 1.10-1.88), and not being less worried about HIV infection now that treatments have improved (RR 1.26; 95% CI 1.01-1.58). Drug supply interruptions in the pharmacies were reported by 10.0% of the non-adherent patients as the reason for missing pills. CONCLUSION: Psychosocial factors were found to impact adherence and should be analysed in more detail by further studies. Scaling up antiretroviral therapy in sub-Saharan Africa should be preceded by reliable drug supply and distribution systems.",M1
17502726,"Impact of genotypic drug resistance mutations on clinical and immunological outcomes in HIV-infected adults on HAART in West Africa.OBJECTIVES: To analyse the association between the presence of resistance mutations and treatment outcomes. The impact of HIV-1 drug resistance mutations in African adults on HAART has so far never been reported. METHODS: In 2004 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 106 adults on HAART had plasma viral load measurements. Patients with detectable viral loads had resistance genotypic tests. Patients were followed until 2006. Main outcomes were serious morbidity and immunological failure (CD4 cell count &lt; 200 cells/microl). RESULTS: At study entry, the median previous time on HAART was 37 months and the median CD4 cell count was 266 cells/microl; 58% of patients had undetectable viral loads, 20% had detectable viral loads with no major resistance mutations, and 22% had detectable viral loads with one or more major mutations. The median change in CD4 cell count between study entry and study termination was +129 cells/microl in patients with undetectable viral loads, +51 cells/microl in those with detectable viral loads with no mutations and +3 cells/microl in those with detectable viral loads with resistance mutations. Compared with patients with undetectable viral loads, those with detectable viral loads with resistance mutations had adjusted hazard ratios of immunological failure of 4.32 (95%<e>CI</e> 1.38-13.57, P = 0.01). One patient died. The 18-month probability of remaining free of morbidity was 0.79 in patients with undetectable viral loads and 0.69 in those with resistance mutations (P = 0.19). CONCLUSION: In this setting with restricted access to second-line HAART, patients with major resistance mutations had higher rates of immunological failure, but most maintained stable CD4 cell counts and stayed alive for at least 20 months.",M1
17381972,"Mild riboflavin deficiency is highly prevalent in school-age children but does not increase risk for anaemia in Côte d'Ivoire.There are few data on the prevalence of riboflavin deficiency in sub-Saharan Africa, and it remains unclear whether riboflavin status influences the risk for anaemia. The aims of this study were to: (1) measure the prevalence of riboflavin deficiency in children in south-central Côte d'Ivoire; (2) estimate the riboflavin content of the local diet; and (3) determine if riboflavin deficiency predicts anaemia and/or iron deficiency. In 5- to 15-year-old children (n 281), height, weight, haemoglobin (Hb), whole blood zinc protoporphyrin (ZPP), erythrocyte glutathione reductase activity coefficient (EGRAC), serum retinol, C-reactive protein (CRP) and prevalence of Plasmodium spp. (asymptomatic malaria) and Schistosoma haematobium (bilharziosis) infections were measured. Three-day weighed food records were kept in twenty-four households. Prevalence of anaemia in the sample was 52%; 59% were iron-deficient based on an elevated ZPP concentration, and 36% suffered from iron deficiency anaemia. Plasmodium parasitaemia was found in 49% of the children. Nineteen percent of the children were infected with S. haematobium. Median riboflavin intake in 5- to 15-year-old children from the food records was 0.42 mg/d, approximately 47% of the estimated average requirement for this age group. Prevalence of riboflavin deficiency was 65%, as defined by an EGRAC value &gt; 1.2. Age, elevated CRP and iron deficiency were significant predictors of Hb. Riboflavin-deficient children free of malaria were more likely to be iron deficient (odds ratio; 3.07; 95% <e>CI</e> 1.12, 8.41). In conclusion, nearly two-thirds of school-age children in south-central Côte d'Ivoire are mildly riboflavin deficient. Riboflavin deficiency did not predict Hb and/or anaemia, but did predict iron deficiency among children free of malaria.",M1
17227132,"Two-year morbidity-mortality and alternatives to prolonged breast-feeding among children born to HIV-infected mothers in Côte d'Ivoire.BACKGROUND: Little is known about the long-term safety of infant feeding interventions aimed at reducing breast milk HIV transmission in Africa. METHODS AND FINDINGS: In 2001-2005, HIV-infected pregnant women having received in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, a peripartum antiretroviral prophylaxis were presented antenatally with infant feeding interventions: either artificial feeding, or exclusive breast-feeding and then early cessation from 4 mo of age. Nutritional counseling and clinical management were provided for 2 y. Breast-milk substitutes were provided for free. The primary outcome was the occurrence of adverse health outcomes in children, defined as validated morbid events (diarrhea, acute respiratory infections, or malnutrition) or severe events (hospitalization or death). Hazards ratios to compare formula-fed versus short-term breast-fed (reference) children were adjusted for confounders (baseline covariates and pediatric HIV status as a time-dependant covariate). The 18-mo mortality rates were also compared to those observed in the Ditrame historical trial, which was conducted at the same sites in 1995-1998, and in which long-term breast-feeding was practiced in the absence of any specific infant feeding intervention. Of the 557 live-born children, 262 (47%) were breast-fed for a median of 4 mo, whereas 295 were formula-fed. Over the 2-y follow-up period, 37% of the formula-fed and 34% of the short-term breast-fed children remained free from any adverse health outcome (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]: 1.10; 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 0.87-1.38; p = 0.43). The 2-y probability of presenting with a severe event was the same among formula-fed (14%) and short-term breast-fed children (15%) (adjusted HR, 1.19; 95% CI, 0.75-1.91; p = 0.44). An overall 18-mo probability of survival of 96% was observed among both HIV-uninfected short-term and formula-fed children, which was similar to the 95% probability observed in the long-term breast-fed ones of the Ditrame trial. CONCLUSIONS: The 2-y rates of adverse health outcomes were similar among short-term breast-fed and formula-fed children. Mortality rates did not differ significantly between these two groups and, after adjustment for pediatric HIV status, were similar to those observed among long-term breast-fed children. Given appropriate nutritional counseling and care, access to clean water, and a supply of breast-milk substitutes, these alternatives to prolonged breast-feeding can be safe interventions to prevent mother-to-child transmission of HIV in urban African settings.",M1
17031317,"Acceptability of formula-feeding to prevent HIV postnatal transmission, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: ANRS 1201/1202 Ditrame Plus Study.OBJECTIVE: To describe the maternal acceptability of formula-feeding proposed to reduce postnatal HIV transmission in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: Each consenting HIV-infected pregnant women, age &gt; or =18 years, who received a perinatal antiretroviral prophylaxis was eligible. Two hierarchical infant-feeding options were proposed antenatally: exclusive formula-feeding or short-term exclusive breast-feeding. Formula-feeding was provided free up to age 9 months. Determinants of acceptability were analyzed using a logistic regression. Formula-feeding failure was defined as having breast-fed one's child at least once. RESULTS: Between March 2001 and March 2003, 580 women delivered: 97% expressed their infant-feeding choice before delivery; 53% chose formula-feeding. Significant prenatal determinants for refusing formula-feeding were: living with her partner, being Muslim, having a low educational level, being followed in one of the study sites, having not disclosed her HIV status, and having been included within the first 6 months of the project. Among the 295 mothers who formula-fed, the Kaplan-Meier probability of success of the formula-feeding option was 93.6% at Day 2 (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>]: 90.7% to 96.3%) and 84.2% at 12 months (95% CI: 79.9% to 88.5%): 46 of 295 (15.6%) women breast-fed at least once, of whom 41% temporarily practiced mixed-feeding at Day 2 because of social stigma or newborn poor health. CONCLUSIONS: In settings with general access to clean water, structured antenatal counseling, and sustained provision of free formula, slightly over half of HIV-infected women chose to artificially feed their newborn infant. Low mixed-feeding rates were observed. This social acceptability must be balanced with mother-child long-term health outcomes to guide safe recommendations on infant-feeding among HIV-infected women in African urban settings.",M1
16841136,"Impact of opportunistic diseases on chronic mortality in HIV-infected adults in Côte d'Ivoire.OBJECTIVE: To estimate incidence rates of opportunistic diseases (ODs) and mortality for patients with and without a history of OD among HIV-infected patients in Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: Using incidence density analysis, we estimated rates of ODs and chronic mortality by CD4 count in patients in a cotrimoxazole prophylaxis trial in Abidjan before the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) era. Chronic mortality was defined as death without a history of OD or death more than 30 days after an OD diagnosis. We used Poisson's regression to examine the effect of OD history on chronic mortality after adjusting for age, gender, and current CD4 count. RESULTS: Two hundred and seventy patients (40% male, mean age 33 years, median baseline CD4 count 261 cells/microl) were followed up for a median of 9.5 months. Bacterial infections and tuberculosis were the most common severe ODs. Of 47 patients who died, 9 (19%) died within 30 days of an OD, 26 (55%) died more than 30 days after an OD, and 12 (26%) died with no OD history. The chronic mortality rate was 31.0/100 person-years for those with an OD history, and 11.1/100 person-years for those with no OD history (rate ratio (RR) 2.81, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 1.43 - 5.54). Multivariate analysis revealed that OD history remained an independent predictor of mortality (RR 2.15, 95% CI: 1.07 - 4.33) after adjusting for CD4 count, age and gender. CONCLUSIONS: Before the HAART era, a history of OD was associated with increased chronic HIV mortality in Côte d'Ivoire, even after adjusting for CD4 count. These results provide further evidence supporting OD prophylaxis in HIV-infected patients.",M1
16584573,"Rapid Urban Malaria Appraisal (RUMA) III: epidemiology of urban malaria in the municipality of Yopougon (Abidjan).BACKGROUND: Currently, there is a significant lack of knowledge concerning urban malaria patterns in general and in Abidjan in particular. The prevalence of malaria, its distribution in the city and the fractions of fevers attributable to malaria in the health facilities have not been previously investigated. METHODS: A health facility-based survey and health care system evaluation was carried out in a peripheral municipality of Abidjan (Yopougon) during the rainy season of 2002, applying a standardized Rapid Urban Malaria Appraisal (RUMA) methodology. RESULTS: According to national statistics, approximately 240,000 malaria cases (both clinical cases and laboratory confirmed cases) were reported by health facilities in the whole of Abidjan in 2001. They accounted for 40% of all consultations. In the health facilities of the Yopougon municipality, the malaria infection rates in fever cases for different age groups were 22.1% (under one year-olds), 42.8% (one to five years-olds), 42.0% (&gt; five to 15 years-olds) and 26.8% (over 15 years-olds), while those in the control group were 13.0%. 26.7%, 21.8% and 14.6%, respectively. The fractions of malaria-attributable fever were 0.12, 0.22, 0.27 and 0.13 in the same age groups. Parasitaemia was homogenously detected in different areas of Yopougon. Among all children, 10.1% used a mosquito net (treated or not) the night before the survey and this was protective (OR = 0.52, 95% <e>CI</e> 0.29-0.97). Travel to rural areas within the last three months was frequent (31% of all respondents) and associated with a malaria infection (OR = 1.75, 95% CI 1.25-2.45). CONCLUSION: Rapid urbanization has changed malaria epidemiology in Abidjan and endemicity was found to be moderate in Yopougon. Routine health statistics are not fully reliable to assess the burden of disease, and the low level of the fractions of malaria-attributable fevers indicated substantial over-treatment of malaria.",M1
16458337,"Incidence of neutropenia in HIV-infected African adults receiving co-trimoxazole prophylaxis: a 6-year cohort study in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.In a placebo-controlled trial of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in Côte d'Ivoire, neutropenia was the most frequent short-term side effect. The long-term incidence of neutropenia in sub-Saharan African adults receiving co-trimoxazole has never been reported. We followed a prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults receiving co-trimoxazole (sulphamethoxazole 800 mg/trimethoprim 160 mg daily) in Abidjan. Grades of neutropenia were successively defined as at least one absolute neutrophil count (ANC) of: &lt;1500/mm(3) (severity grade &gt;/=1), &lt;1000/mm(3) (grade &gt;/=2), &lt;750/mm(3) (grade &gt;/=3) or &lt;500/mm(3) (grade 4). In total, 533 adults were followed-up during 1450 person-years, with a total of 3154 ANCs. The probability of remaining free of neutropenia at 48 months was 0.29 (95% <e>CI</e> 0.23-0.34) for grade &gt;/=1, 0.64 (95% CI 0.60-0.71) for grade &gt;/=2, 0.82 (95% CI 0.77-0.86) for grade &gt;/=3 and 0.96 (95% CI 0.93-0.99) for grade 4. The only factor significantly associated with a higher rate of all grades of neutropenia was a low baseline CD4 count. There was no association between any grade of neutropenia and the global risk of serious morbidity during the study period. In adults receiving co-trimoxazole in Abidjan, mild neutropenia is a common observation with no evidence of negative clinical consequences.

The frequency with which resistance mutations were detected in mothers at week 4 postpartum was 1.14% (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 0.03%-6.17%) for NVP and 8.33% (95% CI, 3.66%-15.76%) for 3TC. In multivariate analysis, 3TC resistance was associated with a longer duration of ZDV plus 3TC prepartum prophylaxis (P=.009). This regimen, which is feasible in resource-limited settings, prevents most peripartum HIV-1 transmission and minimizes the development of NVP resistance.",M1
16119438,"Outbreak of typhoid fever in vaccinated members of the French Armed Forces in the Ivory Coast.In 2001, an outbreak of typhoid fever occurred among the members of the French Armed Forces. All had received a typhoid vaccination as per the immunization schedule practiced in the Armed Forces (every 5 years). A retrospective cohort study was conducted in 94 personnel. The objectives were to confirm the diagnosis, determine the source of contamination and identify the factors associated with defective vaccinal efficacy. Twenty-four cases were clinically identified. A cucumber salad was identified as the contaminating dish (Risk Ratio = 3.6; 95%<e>CI</e> 1.5-8.9). Only one factor was related to defective vaccinal efficacy; the risk of typhoid fever was two-fold higher in people vaccinated more than 3 years previously (Risk Ratio = 2.2; 95%CI, 1.1-4.2). Compliance with food hygiene rules could have prevented 24 cases of typhoid fever. Nevertheless, repeat vaccination against typhoid fever is now conducted every 3 years in the French Forces, in compliance with the manufacturers' recommendations.",M1
15805184,"Risk factors for active tuberculosis after antiretroviral treatment initiation in Abidjan.RATIONALE: In sub-Saharan Africa: (1) tuberculosis is the first cause of HIV-related mortality; (2) the incidence of tuberculosis in adults receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is lower than in untreated HIV-infected adults but higher than in HIV-negative adults; and (3) factors associated with the occurrence of tuberculosis in patients receiving HAART have never been described. OBJECTIVE: To look for the risk factors for active tuberculosis in HIV-infected adults receiving HAART in Abidjan. METHODS: Seven-year prospective cohort of HIV-infected adults, with standardized procedures for documenting morbidity. We analyzed the incidence of active tuberculosis in patients who started HAART and the association between the occurrence of tuberculosis and the characteristics of these patients at HAART initiation. MAIN RESULTS: A total of 129 adults (median baseline CD4 count 125/mm(3)) started HAART and were then followed for 270 person-years (P-Y). At HAART initiation, 31 had a history of tuberculosis and none had current active tuberculosis. During follow-up, the incidence of active tuberculosis was 4.8/100 P-Y (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 2.5-8.3) overall, 3.0/100 P-Y (95% CI, 1.1-6.6) in patients with no tuberculosis history, and 11.3/100 P-Y (95% CI, 4.1-24.5) in patients with a history of tuberculosis (adjusted hazard ratio, 4.64; 95% CI, 1.29-16.62, p = 0.02). CONCLUSION: The risk of tuberculosis after HAART initiation was significantly higher in patients with a history of tuberculosis than in those with no tuberculosis history. If confirmed by others, this finding could lead to assessment of new patterns of time-limited tuberculosis secondary chemoprophylaxis during the period of initiation of HAART in sub-Saharan African adults.",M1
15718842,"Field efficacy of zidovudine, lamivudine and single-dose nevirapine to prevent peripartum HIV transmission.OBJECTIVES: In Africa, single-dose nevirapine (NVPsd), short regimens of zidovudine (ZDV) or ZDV + lamivudine (3TC) are recommended to prevent peripartum mother-to-child HIV transmission (PMTCT). We evaluated the 6-week field efficacy of two more PMTCT drug combinations. DESIGN: An open-label intervention cohort in Abidjan. METHODS: In 2001-2002, consenting women started oral ZDV 300 mg twice daily (bid) at &gt; or =36 weeks of gestation, with 600 mg of ZDV + 200 mg NVPsd orally at beginning of labour. In 2002-2003, the antepartum regimen at &gt; or =32 weeks comprised ZDV as previously + 3TC 150 mg bid; the labour dose comprised ZDV + NVPsd as previously + 300 mg 3TC orally. Neonates received ZDV syrup (2 mg/kg per 6 h) for 7 days + NVPsd syrup (2 mg/kg) on day 2 in both periods. Each woman was assisted to either use breast milk substitutes or breastfeed exclusively. Paediatric HIV infection was diagnosed by plasma HIV RNA viral load at 4 weeks, confirmed at 6 weeks. The reference group was a cohort receiving a short regimen of ZDV &gt; or = 36-38 weeks in 1995-2000 in the same population. RESULTS: A total of 1144 HIV-infected pregnant women were included: 351 with ZDV, 420 with ZDV + NVPsd and 373 with ZDV + 3TC + NVPsd; 1010 livebirths were eligible for analysis; 79 children were HIV-infected peripartum. Six-week transmission probability was 6.5% [95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>), 3.9-9.1%) with ZDV + NVPsd, a 72% reduction compared with ZDV alone (95% CI, 52-88%; P = 0.0002 adjusted on maternal CD4, clinical stage and breastfeeding). It was 4.7% (95% CI, 2.4-7.0%) with ZDV + 3TC + NVPsd (P = 0.34 compared with ZDV + NVPsd). CONCLUSIONS: A short-course of ZDV + NVPsd prevents most peripartum HIV transmission in Africa. This regimen could be added to international guidelines.",M1
15258966,"HBV and HCV prevalence and viraemia in HIV-positive and HIV-negative pregnant women in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: the ANRS 1236 study.A retrospective survey estimating the prevalence of hepatitis viruses B (HBV) and C (HCV) was conducted on samples taken in 1,002 African pregnant women (501 diagnosed as HIV-1 positive and 501 HIV-1 negative) participating in a clinical trial program conducted in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (West Africa). Hepatitis B markers studied were HBs antigen (HBsAg), and if positive, HBe antigen/anti-HBe antibodies and HBV DNA. Two third generation (G3) HCV enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were used for primary HCV screening. All anti-HCV antibody-positive sera were assessed further with supplementary assays (one another G3 EIA, RIBA 3.0, and HCV RNA). HCV genotypes were also determined. HBsAg was found in a similar proportion among HIV-positive (45/499, 9.0%, 95% confidence interval [95% <e>CI</e>], 6.6-11.9) and HIV-negative (40/498, 8.0%, 95% CI, 5.8-10.8) women (P = 0.58). The diagnosis of chronic hepatitis B, based on HBV DNA positive results, was more frequent in HIV-positive women (26.7%), compared to HIV-negative women (9.4%) (P = 0.06). In the case of hepatitis C infection, after supplementary testing allowing the elimination of frequent false-positive screening results, a prevalence rate of about 1% was found, both in HIV-positive (6/501, 1.2%, 95% CI, 0.44-2.59) and HIV-negative (4/501, 0.8%, 95% CI, 0.22-2.03) women (P = 0.53). Of the 10 samples confirmed positive and assessed for HCV RNA, eight (80%) were viraemic and belonged to HCV genotypes 1 or 2. The relative high frequency of HIV/HBV coinfection in Côte d'Ivoire emphasises the need for monitoring the risk of hepatotoxicity by antiretroviral therapy in such patients. We propose an accurate and cost-efficient algorithm for HCV diagnosis in Africa.",M1
15224556,"[Prevalence and risk factors for otomycosis treated in the hospital setting in Abidjan (Ivory Coast)]Otomycosis is frequently encountered in tropical and subtropical zones. In Ivory Coast diagnosis of this disease is often based solely on the clinical symptoms. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence, predisposing factors, and etiologic agents associated with otomycosis at the Treichville University Hospital Center in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. Mycological examinations were performed on specimens obtained from 115 patients presenting with external otitis at the d'Oto-Rhino-Laryngology Department. Fungi-positive cultures were obtained in 49 patients for an overall otomycosis prevalence of 42.6 (95% Confidence Interval (<e>CI</e>), 34.4-52.2). Univariate analysis showed that the predisposing factors for otomycosis were frequent swimming in natural or artificial pools (Relative Risk (RR) 3.7; CI 1.7-8.1), daily ear cleaning (RR 3.5; CI 1.8-6.8) and excessive use of eardrops containing antibiotics and corticoids (RR = 9.3; IC95% = 4.3-20.1). The most common etiologic agents were Aspergillus flavus (20.4%), Candida albicans (16.3%), Candida parapsilosis (14.3%), and Aspergillus niger (12.2%). A combination of two agents was found in five cases. These data show that otomycosis is endemic in Ivory Coast. Management of otomycosis must include mycological examination for diagnosis as well as changing behavior patterns leading to infection.",M1
14640385,"Medium-term survival, morbidity and immunovirological evolution in HIV-infected adults receiving antiretroviral therapy, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate survival, morbidity, and CD4 and viral load (VL) evolution in HIV-infected adults receiving antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: Since 1996, 723 HIV-infected adults have been followed up in the ANRS 1203 cohort study in Abidjan. For those patients who received ART, we describe data between ART initiation and August 2002. RESULTS: One-hundred-and-one adults (61% women) were followed up under ART for a median of 17 months. At ART initiation, median age, CD4 count and VL were 36 years, 135/mm3 and 5.3 log10 copies/ml, respectively. Initial ART regimens were two nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs) plus one protease inhibitor in 74 patients, two NRTIs plus one non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in 16, and two NRTIs in 11. No patient was lost to follow-up. The most frequent causes of severe morbidity were bacterial infections [11.6/100 person-years (PY), 95% <e>CI</e>: 7.2-18.7], drug-related events (6.5/100 PY, 3.5-12.0), tuberculosis (3.1/100 PY, 1.3-7.4) and malaria (3.1/100 PY, 1.3-7.4). The incidence of death was 3.0/100 PY (1.1-8.0) in patients with baseline CD4 &gt; or = 50/mm3 and 16.1/100 PY (7.2-35.9) in patients with CD4 &lt; 50/mm3. Fifty percent of causes of death were active infections pre-existing ART initiation, mainly atypical mycobacteriosis. After 1 year, 51% of patients had undetectable VL, 28% had detectable VL reduced by more than 0.5 log10 copies/ml since ART initiation, and the median gain in CD4 was +115/mm3. CONCLUSION: Medium-term survival under ART may be as good in Africa as in industrialized countries, provided that patients benefit from access to care for opportunistic infections, including bacterial diseases, tuberculosis and malaria.",M1
14615662,"HIV-1 viral load and other risk factors for mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in a breast-feeding population in Cote d'Ivoire.Short-course antiretroviral regimens have been evaluated to reduce mother-to-child transmission of HIV in resource-limited settings. This report from Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, examines the risk factors for HIV transmission by 1 and 24 months among breast-feeding women. Eligible HIV-1-seropositive pregnant women enrolled in this randomized double-blind clinical trial were randomly assigned to receive either oral zidovudine (ZDV) (n = 126) prophylaxis or placebo (n = 124). Maternal prophylaxis began at 36 weeks of gestation (300 mg ZDV twice daily antepartum and 300 mg every 3 hours intrapartum); there was no neonatal prophylaxis component. The cumulative risk of transmission in the treatment group was 11.9% and 22.1% by 1 and 24 months, respectively. In adjusted analyses, viral load at enrollment was the strongest predictor of transmission (per log increment: odds ratio [OR] = 4.8, 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>]: 2.5-9.5 at 1 month; OR = 5.7; 95% CI: 3.1-10.8 at 24 months). Overall, ZDV prophylaxis was not significantly protective for infection at 1 or 24 months. Comparing ZDV with placebo following dichotomization of viral load (&lt;50,000 vs. &gt; or =50,000 copies/mL) at enrollment, however, there was a significant effect of ZDV seen only among those women with a low viral load at enrollment. The substantial risk of transmission despite ZDV prophylaxis, particularly among those with higher viral loads, underscores the need to find more effective regimens appropriate for use in resource-limited settings.",M1
14600570,"Field evaluation of an improved assay using a heat-dissociated p24 antigen for adults mainly infected with HIV-1 CRF02_AG strains in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa.The aim of this study was to evaluate the heat-dissociated p24 antigen (HD p24 Ag) assay as an alternative low-cost tool for diagnosis of HIV-1 infection and quantitation of HIV-1 RNA levels in African adults mainly infected with HIV-1 CRF02_AG strains. One hundred seventeen plasma specimens were obtained from HIV-1-seropositive subjects enrolled in the ANRS 1220 PRIMO-<e>CI</e> cohort (Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa). Results of the HD p24 Ag assay were comparable with those of HIV-1 RNA levels quantified in the same antibody-positive plasma samples by the Amplicor HIV-1 Monitor assay (1.5 version; Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN): sensitivity, 95.7% versus 96.6%, respectively; specificity (evaluated with samples from 75 seronegative subjects), 94.7% versus 100%, respectively. HD p24 Ag and HIV-1 RNA assays were weakly correlated (Spearman coefficient correlation, r = 0.33; P &lt; 0.001) except for HIV-1 RNA levels of &gt;/=5 log10 copies/mL (r = 0.62; P &lt; 0.001). Quantitation of HD p24 antigenemia in 76 plasma specimens from 14 patients treated with highly active antiretroviral therapy demonstrated weaker changes during treatment than those observed with the HIV-1 RNA assay. Follow-up of infected patients using both markers showed different results. The reliability of the HD p24 Ag assay is questionable for clinical and biologic management as a surrogate tool for measurement of HIV-1 RNA levels in Africa.",M1
14565614,"The most efficient use of resources to identify those in need of antiretroviral treatment in Africa: empirical data from Côte d'Ivoire's Drug Access Initiative.OBJECTIVE: To describe the cost and outcome associated with the use of CD4 cell count and viral load tests as part of screening strategies to identify persons eligible for subsidized antiretroviral therapy (ART) in Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: Empirical data from the Drug Access Initiative in Côte d'Ivoire (DAI-<e>CI</e>) were used to describe the laboratory cost of patient screening using sequential clinical staging, CD4 cell count, and viral load and the proportion of screened patients identified as eligible for ART. We also estimated costs modelling a parallel screening algorithm, across a range of laboratory costs and with current international recommendations to assess treatment eligibility. Benefit was defined as being found eligible for ART. RESULTS: Of the 2138 HIV-positive, ART-naive, adults who presented to the DAI-CI between July 1998 and July 2000, median CD4 cell count was 172 x 10(6) cells/microl. DAI-CI criteria identified 2057 (96%) of these persons eligible for antiretroviral treatment. In a serial screening algorithm, 75% were eligible by CDC clinical stage B or C; 18% by CD4 cell count less than 500 x 10(6) cells/microl; and an estimated 3.9% by a viral load greater than 10 000 copies/ml. Use of the current US recommendations and a serial algorithm would have resulted in 1977 (92%) persons eligible for ART: 75% by CDC clinical stage B or C; 15% by CD4 cell count less than 350 x 10(6) cells/microl (including 8% &lt; 200 x 10(6) cells/microl); and an estimated 3.6% due to viral load greater than 55 000 copies/ml. Using DAI-CI criteria and heavily subsidized laboratory test costs, the addition of CD4 cell count to clinical criteria cost US dollar 50 (serial algorithm) and US dollar 203 (parallel algorithm) to identify each additional eligible person. Modelling current recommendations with a serial algorithm, CD4 cell count cost an average US dollar 62/eligible person (US recommendations) and US dollar 109 (WHO recommendations). The addition of viral load cost between US dollar 108 (serial algorithm DAI) to US dollar 1700 (parallel algorithm DAI) to identify each additional eligible person. CONCLUSION: In the African context of scarce resources and the huge unmet demands for voluntary HIV testing and for ART, simple screening strategies are needed to identify those most in need of ART. Health personnel should be trained to identify and refer clinically symptomatic persons. Viral load testing is of high cost and dubious benefit and should not be part of screening algorithms for initiating ART.",M1
14523214,"Pediatric viral human immunodeficiency virus type 1 RNA levels, timing of infection, and disease progression in African HIV-1-infected children.OBJECTIVE: To describe plasma human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) RNA levels in African HIV-1-infected children in relation to the timing of infection and disease progression. METHODS: A retrospective cohort study was conducted of 80 children who were born to HIV-1-positive mothers and clinically followed from birth to 18 months of age in the ANRS 049 Ditrame project, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (West Africa). The diagnosis and timing of pediatric HIV-1 infection were determined prospectively according to HIV-1 DNA polymerase chain reaction results. A total of 364 HIV-1 RNA viral load (VL) measurements were assessed retrospectively. Kaplan-Meier analyses and proportional hazards models were used to evaluate the prognostic value of pediatric VL and covariates for HIV disease progression or death. RESULTS: Mean initial positive VL was significantly lower among children who were infected in utero (4.94 log10/mL, n = 12) than in children who were infected later (5.6-6.1 log10/mL, n = 68). In the first 6 months after diagnosis, HIV-1 RNA levels peaked (&gt; or =6 log10/mL), regardless of timing of infection. Then, a slow decline (overall slope, -0.076 log10 copies/mL/mo) was observed until 18 months of age. A 1 log10 higher value of the pediatric peak VL (risk ratio [RR]: 1.85; 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>]: 1.0-3.44) and of the maternal VL at delivery (RR: 1.90; CI: 1.16-3.12) were independently associated with an increased risk of rapid progression to acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) or death at 18 months of life (23 AIDS diagnoses and 31 deaths). Disease progression or death was more rapid for girls than for boys (RR: 2.26; CI: 1.39-4.96). CONCLUSIONS: In Africa, pediatric HIV-1 RNA levels are very close to those described in industrialized countries and seem to be predictive of AIDS stage or death, as in industrialized countries. With antiretroviral therapy becoming more widely available, the early identification and monitoring of pediatric HIV disease remains of paramount importance in Africa.",M1
12824787,"Postnatal transmission of HIV-1 after a maternal short-course zidovudine peripartum regimen in West Africa.BACKGROUND: To assess the postnatal transmission (PT) risk of HIV-1 after a maternal short-course zidovudine regimen in a breastfeeding population. METHODS: Data were pooled from two trials: ANRS 049a DITRAME (Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina-Faso) and RETROCI (Abidjan). Consenting HIV-1 seropositive women were randomized at 36-38 weeks' gestation between September 1995 and February 1998, to receive oral zidovudine or placebo: one tablet twice daily until delivery, and in DITRAME only, for 7 more days. A PT case was infection in a child with a negative HIV-1 PCR at age &gt;/= 30 days who later became infected as defined by a positive HIV-1 PCR, or if aged &gt;/= 15 months, a positive HIV serology. Cumulative risks (CR) of PT were computed using a competing risk approach with weaning as a competing event. FINDINGS: At age 24 months, CR for PT were similar in the zidovudine (9.8%, n = 254) and placebo groups (9.1%, n = 225). In a multivariate model of PT risk factors, the treatment effect was not significant, maternal CD4 cell count &lt; 500 x 10(6)/l at entry tripled the hazard compared to women with CD4 cell counts &gt;/= 500 x 10(6)/l [hazard ratio (HR), 3.14; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>), 1.31-7.49] as well as an increased maternal plasma viral load at entry (HR, 2.65 for 1 log(10) increase; CI, 1.75-4.00). INTERPRETATION: PT occurred at a similar rate between arms and therefore reduced the long-term overall efficacy of this peripartum zidovudine regimen at age 24 months. The higher risk of PT among women with low CD4 cell count emphasizes the importance of identifying interventions to prevent PT for these women.",M1
12556143,"Randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral artemether for the prevention of patent Schistosoma haematobium infections.Artemether is an efficacious antimalarial drug that also displays antischistosomal properties. Laboratory studies have found that artemether curtails the development of adult worms of Schistosoma japonicum, S. mansoni and S. haematobium, and thus prevents morbidity. These findings have been confirmed in clinical trials for the former two parasites; administered orally once every 2-3 weeks, artemether significantly reduced the incidence and intensity of patent infections. Here, we present the first randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of artemether against S. haematobium, done in a highly endemic area of Côte d'Ivoire. Urine specimens from 440 schoolchildren were examined over 4 consecutive days, followed by two systematic praziquantel treatments 4 weeks apart. S. haematobium-negative children were randomized to receive 6 mg/kg artemether (N = 161) or placebo (N = 161). Medication was administered orally for a total of six doses once every 4 weeks. Adverse events were assessed 72 hours after medication, and perceived illness episodes were monitored throughout the study period. Incidence and intensity of S. haematobium infections, and microhematuria and macrohematuria were assessed 3 weeks after the final dosing. We also monitored malaria parasitemia and treated positive cases with sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP). Oral artemether was well tolerated. The incidence of patent S. haematobium infections in artemether recipients was significantly lower than in placebo recipients (49% versus 65%, protective efficacy: 0.25, 95% <e>CI</e>: 0.08-0.38, P = 0.007). The geometric mean infection intensity in the artemether group was less than half that of the placebo recipients (3.4 versus 7.4 eggs/10 mL urine, P &lt; 0.001). Heavy S. haematobium infections, microhematuria and macrohematuria, and the incidence of malaria parasitemia were all significantly lower in artemether recipients. In conclusion, previous findings of efficacy of artemether against S. japonicum and S. mansoni were confirmed for S. haematobium, although the protective efficacy was considerably lower. These findings enlarge the scope and potential of artemether and further contribute to discussions of its role as an additional tool for integrated schistosomiasis control.",M1
12441802,"Primary HIV-1 infection in African children infected through breastfeeding.OBJECTIVES: To describe acute retroviral syndrome and associated primary viraemia in African children infected with HIV-1 through breastfeeding. DESIGN: Matched case-control study performed retrospectively within the ANRS 049 DITRAME project conducted in 1995-1998 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: Cases were children infected by HIV-1 postnatally through breastfeeding. All were HIV-1 negative by DNA PCR at least 45 days of age, but positive on a subsequent sample. This period was considered as surrounding the estimated date of postnatal contamination. Signs/symptoms occurring within this period were recorded in cases and compared with those occurring during the same time period in uninfected breastfed children (controls). For cases, plasma specimens were tested for HIV-1 plasma RNA using the branched DNA assay. RESULTS: Of 22 infants infected postnatally (median age at first positive sample, 185 days; range, 87-373 days), 21 (95.5%) exhibited at least one clinical sign, compared with only 27 of the 44 (61.4%) uninfected children (P = 0.003). Three independent factors were associated with primary HIV-1 infection: mononucleosis-like syndrome [odds ratio (OR), 8.3; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>), 1.4-47.8], dermatitis (OR, 6.0; CI, 1.1-31.9), and generalized lymphadenopathy (OR, 26.5; CI, 2.0-348.4). Among cases, initial median plasma HIV-1 RNA viral load was 5.92 log10 copies/ml; this declined to 4.96 log10 12 months after the first positive viral load. CONCLUSIONS: These results may be useful for the recognition of early paediatric cases of postnatal transmission in Africa and could enable targeting of those who should benefit from HIV RNA or DNA testing for primary HIV-1 infection and their subsequent care.",M1
12181464,"15 Month follow up of African children following vaginal cleansing with benzalkonium chloride of their HIV infected mothers during late pregnancy and delivery.OBJECTIVES: To study mother to child HIV-1 transmission (MTCT) and infant mortality following benzalkonium chloride (BC) disinfection. METHODS: A randomised, double blind phase II placebo controlled trial. Women testing positive for HIV-1 infection in prenatal care units in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso, from November 1996 to April 1997 were eligible, with their informed consent. Women self administered daily a vaginal suppository of 1% BC (53) or matched placebo (54) from 36 weeks of pregnancy, plus a single dose during labour. The neonate was bathed with 1% BC solution or placebo within 30 minutes after birth. MTCT rate was assessed based on repeated polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and serology results. For the present analysis, children were followed up to 15 months. RESULTS: A total of 107 women were enrolled. Of 103 eligible liveborn children, 23 were HIV infected, 75 uninfected, and five of indeterminate status. MTCT transmission rate was 24.2% overall (95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 14.3% to 30.4%). On an intent to treat basis, the transmission rate did not differ between the two groups (23.5%, CI 13.8 to 38.5, in the BC group and 24.8%, CI 15.0 to 39.6, in the placebo group at 15 months). Similarly, there was no difference in mortality at 15 months (22.9%, CI 13.7 to 36.9, in the BC group and 16.5%, CI 9.0 to 29.4, in the placebo group). CONCLUSION: This analysis failed to suggest any benefit of BC disinfection on mother to child HIV transmission or perinatal and infant mortality.",M1
12062494,"Reduction in the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infections after praziquantel treatment for schistosomiasis infection.Praziquantel exhibits activity against all major human schistosome parasites and has become the cornerstone for treatment and morbidity control of schistosomiasis. Praziquantel is also active against a wide range of trematodes, human and veterinary cestodes and displays cysticidal effects. To the best of our knowledge anthelminthic properties have never been documented. Here, we report a study among 96 schoolchildren from an area highly endemic for Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm infection, and place particular emphasis on the effect of praziquantel on the prevalence and intensity of hookworm infections. Stool specimens were screened over several consecutive days prior and 4 weeks after systematic administration of praziquantel. We found a significant reduction in the prevalence of hookworm infection from 75.0 to 40.6% (odds ratio (OR)=0.21; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 0.11-0.40). Infection intensities, expressed by geometric mean egg counts of all children, were also reduced significantly from 10.7 to 2.0 eggs per gram stool (paired t-test=7.78, P&lt;0.001). If these findings are confirmed in other epidemiological settings - following a similarly sensitive diagnostic approach - they might become of considerable relevance. In areas where both schistosome and hookworm coexist, and praziquantel is being recommended for schistosomiasis control, large-scale application of this drug might also reduce the burden of hookworms.",M1

A 1998-1999 cross-sectional study.BACKGROUND: Tinea capitis is a worldwide public health problem that poses specific therapeutic challenges. This dermatophytosis of the scalp is endemic in Africa. The objectives of this study were to determine the prevalence, the associated demographic factors, causative species, and clinical types of tinea capitis in Abidjan, Ivory Coast. METHODS: From June 1998 to March 1999, 1913 children aged between 4 and 15 years, and schooling in seven urban primary schools of Abidjan (Ivory Coast), were examined clinically for tinea capitis. Among all children showing symptoms suggestive of scalp ringworm, hair stumps and scales were collected and exposed to direct microscopic examination using 30% potassium hydroxide solution, and cultivation on Sabouraud's dextrose agar with or without actidione. RESULTS: Among 227 symptomatic children, cultures positive for fungi were found in 217, yielding an overall tinea capitis prevalence of 11.34% [95% Confidence Interval (<e>CI</e>), 9.97-12.85]. By univariate analysis, tinea capitis was significantly associated with boys [odds ratio (OR) 7.85; CI 5.22-11.81] and in children belonging to the intermediate 8-11 years age group (OR 1.93; CI 1.29-2.90). Trichophyton soudanense and Microsporum langeronii were the most prevalent etiologic agents (63.6% and 31.3%, respectively), whereas a mixture of both T. soudanense and M. langeronii was observed in a 2.8% proportion. Finally, 2.3% of isolated species were represented by T. violaceum. CONCLUSIONS: Our survey provided evidence that tinea capitis is endemic in Ivory Coast, constituting a substantial infectious dermatological disturbance. T. soudanense was the most frequent causative agent, whereas T. violaceum was isolated for the first time in this sub-Saharan western African country.",M1
11832684,"Clinical and biological evolution of HIV-1 seroconverters in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 1997-2000.OBJECTIVE: To describe the clinical and biologic evolution of HIV-1 infection in Africa. METHODS: One hundred four HIV-1-infected individuals were identified prospectively from regular blood donors in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. The date of seroconversion was estimated from results of sequential serologic tests. Biologic and clinical follow-up was performed every 6 months, starting as early as possible after seroconversion. Case management followed national guidelines. RESULTS: The median interval between estimated seroconversion and study inclusion was 9.7 months, and the median window of seroconversion was 2.8 months. At baseline, all but two patients were asymptomatic; the median CD4 + cell count was 527/mm 3 (interquartile range [IR], 395-684), and the median plasma HIV RNA level was 4.6 log 10 copies/ml (IR, 3.8-4.9). The median follow-up was 23.9 months, and 95% of the patients received primary prophylaxis with co-trimoxazole for opportunistic infections. Of the patients, 1 presented with wasting syndrome, 3 developed tuberculosis, and 17 had a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention category B-defining event. The 3-year AIDS-free and symptom-free probabilities were 96.7% (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 87.0-99.2] and 79.3% (95% CI, 67.5-87.2), respectively. During the first 3 years of follow-up, we observed that the median plasma viral load stabilized at &gt;4 log 10 copies/ml and that the median CD4 + cell count declined by 20 to 25/mm 3 per year. CONCLUSION: These African seroconverters were moderately immunosuppressed. The median HIV RNA level was high and varied very little during the first 3 years, and there were few clinical events.",M1
11821134,"Seasonal epidemiology of ticks and aspects of cowdriosis in N'Dama village cattle in the Central Guinea savannah of Côte d'Ivoire.In the Central Guinea savannah of Côte d'Ivoire, cattle breeding started only approximately 30 years ago. The impact of parasitism on the overall health status and productivity of the trypanotolerant N'Dama cattle in this area is unknown. In close collaboration with national veterinary institutions and local farmers, we studied spectrum, burden and seasonal dynamics of ticks (including aspects of cowdriosis) on N'Dama village cattle. In a longitudinal study, three randomly selected cattle herds (traditional farming type) of one village were examined repeatedly for ticks. Spectrum, burden, seasonal epidemiology of ticks were assessed. In these traditional herds (which lack (ecto)parasite management), all animals were infested by ticks at monthly counts. Five different tick species were identified; the four genera in order of frequency were: Amblyomma (overall prevalence 96%), Boophilus (47%), Hyalomma (&lt;1%) and Rhipicephalus (&lt;1%). Amblyomma variegatum was the most-abundant tick on cattle in all seasons. Seroprevalence of Cowdria ruminantium was 31% (95% <e>CI</e>: 26, 36%). Most of the animals typically carried low tick burdens. N'Dama cattle seem well adapted to their environment and can resist the tick burdens under this traditional farming system.",M1
11427407,"Prognostic value of cross-sectional anthropometric indices on short-term risk of mortality in human immunodeficiency virus-infected adults in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.In sub-Saharan Africa where weight loss is very difficult to estimate, cross-sectional anthropometric indicators could be useful to predict human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated mortality. The study objective was to look for threshold values of baseline body mass index, arm muscle circumference, and fat mass to predict the risk of death in HIV-infected adults included in a 1996-1998 trial of early cotrimoxazole chemoprophylaxis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire (COTRIMO-<e>CI</e>-ANRS 059 trial). The authors graphically determined if consecutive anthropometric categories with the closest hazards ratios of the risk of death could be clustered to obtain a unique threshold that distinctly separated two categories. When the threshold values were determined, the authors estimated the hazards ratio of mortality of this two-category model. A significant increase of mortality was observed for a body mass index of &lt; or =20.3 in men (hazards ratio = 2.6; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.4, 5.0) and of &lt; or =18.5 in women (hazards ratio = 2.2; 95% CI: 1.05, 4.5) and for a fat mass of &lt; or =6% in men (hazards ratio = 4.6; 95% CI: 2.3, 9.4) and of &lt; or =18% in women (hazards ratio = 2.4; 95% CI: 1.2, 4.9). No simple threshold could be identified for arm muscle circumference. In Côte d'Ivoire where chemoprophylaxis of opportunistic infections has recently been recommended to be widely initiated on clinical criteria, such thresholds may help to screen patients with higher risks of mortality.",M1
11399959,"Effect of early chemoprophylaxis with co-trimoxazole on nutritional status evolution in HIV-1-infected adults in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, malnutrition is a major complication of HIV disease. Measuring accurately the nutritional benefits of a therapeutic intervention could be an easy-to-monitor secondary outcome. METHODS: Anthropometric data were analysed from patients participating in a placebo-controlled trial of co-trimoxazole prophylaxis in adults recruited at early stages of HIV-1 infection in Côte d'Ivoire (COTRIMO-<e>CI</e> ANRS 059 trial). Body mass index (BMI), arm muscle circumference (AMC) and percentage of fat mass (FM) were measured at baseline and quarterly during the follow up. Percentage of variation from the baseline value was compared between treatment groups and within the groups using Student t-test. RESULTS: An improvement of all anthropometric indicators was observed in the first 3 months of follow up in both treatment groups, significant in the co-trimoxazole group (P &lt; or = 0.0006) but not in the placebo group (P &gt; or = 0.06). In the co-trimoxazole group, this improvement was maintained for up to 24 months for BMI (P = 0.007), 21 months for AMC (P = 0.02) and only up to 12 months for FM (P = 0.04). The placebo group had a stable anthropometric status up to the end of the trial. Differences between treatment groups were significant for up to 15 months for BMI and AMC and 12 months for FM. CONCLUSION: As co-trimoxazole prophylaxis is now recommended in Africa as part of a minimum package of care for HIV-infected symptomatic subjects, the short-term improvement of these anthropometric indicators in adults who start co-trimoxazole prophylaxis should be considered as an effective clinical outcome.",M1

OBJECTIVE: To assess whether HCWs in Abidjan are at increased risk for occupationally acquired Mycobacterium tuberculosis infection. DESIGN: From October 1996 to January 1997, consenting HCWs from four services where tuberculosis (TB) prevalence among patients was high and two services where it was low were evaluated with a questionnaire, TST (including evaluation of anergy) and chest radiograph. RESULTS: Of the 512 participants, 405 (79%) had a TST reaction of &gt; or =10 mm, eight (2%) were anergic, five (1%) had a radiograph compatible with TB, and two had confirmed TB. Using a cut-off of 10 mm, we found a higher prevalence of TST positivity in services with high TB prevalence than in those with low TB prevalence (92% vs 72%; odds ratio [OR] 4.3; 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>] 2.3-8.0]) and among HCWs with direct (87%; OR 2.9; 95%CI 1.6-5.1) and indirect patient contact (80%, OR 1.7; 95%CI 1.0-2.3) than among those with minimal patient contact (69%). CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that TST positivity among HCWs is related to level of exposure to TB patients, and suggest that HCWs in Abidjan are at risk for the nosocomial transmission of TB.",M1
10776745,"Oral artemether for prevention of Schistosoma mansoni infection: randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy with praziquantel is the current strategy of choice to control schistosomiasis. However, in view of concern about praziquantel tolerance or resistance, new drugs are needed. Artemether, a derivative of the antimalarial drug artemisinin, kills immature schistosomes of Schistosoma japonicum, and reduces the incidence of infection in field trials. Laboratory studies have also showed activity by this drug against S. mansoni. We report a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial of artemether to prevent S. mansoni infection. METHODS: The trial was done in an area of western Côte d'Ivoire endemic for S. mansoni. 354 schoolchildren were enrolled. Stool specimens were screened over four consecutive days, followed by two mass treatments with praziquantel 4 weeks apart. All S. mansoni negative children were randomly assigned to placebo (n=151) or artemether 6 mg/kg (n=138) orally six times once every 3 weeks. Adverse events were assessed 24 h after treatment. Perceived illness episodes were recorded once a week by interviewing the children with a standardised questionnaire. 3 weeks after the final medication S. mansoni infections were assessed by screening stool samples. Blood samples were examined for Plasmodium falciparum before the first and after the last artemether treatment. FINDINGS: Oral artemether showed no adverse reactions. The group that received artemether had a significantly lower incidence of S. mansoni infection (31/128 versus 68/140, relative risk: 0.50 [95% <e>CI</e> 0.35-0.71], p=0.00006). The geometric mean egg output among positive children in the artemether group was significantly lower than in placebo recipients (19 vs 32 eggs/g stool, p=0.017). There was also a significant reduction in the prevalence of P. falciparum. INTERPRETATION: Oral artemether is safe and shows a prophylatic effect against S. mansoni. The use of artemether may be recommended in appropriated situations as an additional tool for more effective schistosomiasis control measures. However the application needs to be carefully assessed especially in view of the concern that it could select for resistant plasmodia.This randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled trial examined the efficacy of oral artemether for the prevention of Schistosoma mansoni infection among 354 children from Cote d'Ivoire.  Stool specimens were screened over 4 consecutive days, followed by two mass treatments with praziquantel 4 weeks apart.  All S. mansoni negative children were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 151) or artemether (n = 138).  An assessment after 24 hours and examination of blood samples after the 3rd week of initial administration was conducted.  Findings revealed that administration of oral artemether showed no adverse reaction, with an observation of a relatively lower incidence of S. mansoni infection (31/128 vs. 68/140; relative risk, 0.50; 95% confidence interval, 0.35-0.71; p = 0.00006).  In addition, the geometric mean egg output among positive children in the artemether group was significantly lower in placebo treatment (19 vs. 32 eggs/g stool; p = 0.017).  Furthermore, there was a significant reduction in the prevalence of Plasmodium falciparum.  The study confirmed the safety and prophylactic effect of oral artemether against S. mansoni, and recommends its use as an additional tool for a more effective schistosomiasis control measure.",M1

METHODS: The study population and methods are described in the companion paper. Additional methods include a Papanicolaou smear for cytological diagnosis and statistical analysis. RESULTS: In maternal women, both HIV-1 and high risk HPV were significant independent risk factors for squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 11.0 (95% <e>CI</e> 1.1-112) and 5.4 (1.5-18.8), respectively). Only high levels of HPV DNA in the lavage were associated with SIL (OR 13.2 (3.6-47.8)) in the maternal group. In female sex workers, high risk HPV was significantly associated with SIL (OR 23.7 (4.4-126)); HIV seropositivity was not. Any positive level (high or low amounts) of HPV DNA was significantly associated with SIL in sex workers (ORs 15.9 (3.3-76) and 12.7 (3.6-44), respectively). There was no association of SIL with CD4 cell counts &lt; or = 500 x 10(6)/l in HIV seropositive women from either group.

METHODS: We conducted a cross sectional study of two groups of women. One group had low numbers of lifetime sex partners (maternal women, n = 258) and were enrolled based on HIV serostatus. The other group had high numbers of sex partners (female sex workers, n = 278) and all consenting self identified sex workers were admitted to this study. We collected epidemiological and clinical data, and cervicovaginal lavage for HPV testing. RESULTS: The groups had different distributions of HIV seroreactivity, but the rates of HPV DNA detection were similar. Most of the HPV DNAs detected in both groups were high risk types. A strong association of high risk HPV DNA and HIV-1 seropositivity was found in both maternal women (adjusted odds ratio (OR) 7.5 (95% <e>CI</e> 3.2-17.4)) and in sex workers (OR 5.0 (2.1-12.0)). The maternal group also showed an association of high risk HPV DNA detection with HIV-2 (OR 3.7 (1.6-8.5)) and HIV-D (OR 12.7 (4.3-37.5)) that was not observed in the sex workers. In addition, the association of high risk HPV DNA with HIV-1 in the maternal group was independent of low CD4 cell count, while in the sex workers the association depended on CD4 cell counts &lt; or = 500 x 10(6)/l.

10513758,"Cervical screening in Africa: discordant diagnosis in a double independent reading. DYSCER-<e>CI</e> Group.Interobserver variation in the cytological diagnosis of cervical lesions poses a problem for public health screening programs. This study assessed the frequency of discordant diagnoses between two independent cytopathologists in the screening of African women. In Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 2157 women were recruited from three outpatient gynecology clinics and screened for cervical abnormalities and genital and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. The degree of agreement between the cytopathologists was assessed by kappa statistics. The overall agreement was poor (kappa = 0.33); however, the degree of agreement increased with the severity of the lesions and was fairly good (kappa = 0.53) for high-grade and invasive lesions requiring curative treatment. Discordance was associated with HIV infection but not with genital infections. For a prevention program of cervical cancer in this African context, strategies must be developed to minimize errors in cervical screening. Particularly, HIV-infected women require a systematic rereading to reduce false-negative results.",M1

DITRAME Study Group. DIminution de la Transmission Mère-Enfant.BACKGROUND: Zidovudine reduces the rate of vertical transmission of HIV in non-breastfed populations. We assessed the acceptability, tolerance, and 6-month efficacy of a short regimen of oral zidovudine in African populations practising breastfeeding. METHODS: A randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial was carried out in public clinics of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, and Bobo-Dioulasso, Burkina Faso. Eligible participants were women aged 18 years or older, who had confirmed HIV-1 infection and pregnancy of 36-38 weeks duration, and who gave written informed consent. Exclusion criteria were severe anaemia, neutropenia, abnormal liver function, and sickle-cell disease. Women were randomly assigned zidovudine (n=214; 300 mg twice daily until labour, 600 mg at beginning of labour, and 300 mg twice daily for 7 days post partum) or matching placebo (n=217). The primary outcome was the diagnosis of HIV-1 infection in the infant on the basis of sequential DNA PCR tests at days 1-8, 45, 90, and 180. We compared the probability of infection at a given age in the two groups. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Women were enrolled between September, 1995, and February, 1998, when enrolment to the placebo group was stopped. Analysis was based on 421 women and 400 lifeborn infants. Baseline demographic, clinical, and laboratory characteristics were similar in the two groups. The Kaplan-Meier probability of HIV infection in the infant at 6 months was 18.0% in the zidovudine group (n=192) and 27.5% in the placebo group (n=197; relative efficacy 0.38 [95% <e>CI</e> 0.05-0.60]; p=0.027). Adjustment for centre, period of recruitment, mode of delivery, maternal CD4-cell count, duration of labour, prolonged rupture of membranes, and duration of breastfeeding did not change the treatment effect. The proportions of women taking more than 80% of the planned maximum dose were 75% before delivery, 81% during labour, and 83% post partum, without statistical difference between the groups. No major adverse biological or clinical event was reported in excess among women and children of the zidovudine group. INTERPRETATION: A short course of oral zidovudine given during the peripartum period is well accepted and well tolerated, and provides a 38% reduction in early vertical transmission of HIV-1 infection despite breastfeeding.",M1

Short-course perinatal oral zidovudine might decrease the rate of transmission. We assessed the safety and efficacy of such a regimen among HIV-1-seropositive breastfeeding women in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: From April, 1996, to February, 1998, all consenting, eligible HIV-1-seropositive pregnant women attending a public antenatal clinic in Abidjan were enrolled at 36 weeks' gestation and randomly assigned placebo or zidovudine (300 mg tablets), one tablet twice daily until the onset of labour, one tablet at onset of labour, and one tablet every 3 h until delivery. We used HIV-1-DNA PCR to test the infection status of babies at birth, 4 weeks, and 3 months. We stopped the study on Feb 18, 1998, when efficacy results were available from a study in Bangkok, Thailand, in which the same regimen was used in a non-breastfeeding population. FINDINGS: 280 women were enrolled (140 in each group). The median duration of the prenatal drug regimen was 27 days (range 1-80) and the median duration of labour was 7.5 h. Treatment was well tolerated with no withdrawals because of adverse events. All babies were breastfed. Among babies with known infection status at age 3 months, 30 (26.1%) of 115 babies in the placebo group and 19 (16.5%) of 115 in the zidovudine group were identified as HIV-1 infected. The estimated risk of HIV-1 transmission in the placebo and zidovudine groups were 21.7% and 12.2% (p=0.05) at 4 weeks, and 24.9% and 15.7% (p=0.07) at 3 months. Efficacy was 44% (95% <e>CI</e> -1 to 69) at age 4 weeks and 37% (-5 to 63) at 3 months.

10414878,"Short-term follow up of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions associated with HIV and human papillomavirus infections in Africa.A prospective study in gynaecology clinics was conducted in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, to assess the short-term evolution of squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs). Of 94 women with a cytological diagnosis of SIL, 38 were infected with HIV. The average follow-up period after the initial smear was 5 months. Detection of human papillomavirus (HPV) by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed at both the time of enrolment and final follow-up smear. There were 39 cases of persistent SILs. HIV-positive women had a higher percentage of persistent SIL (76%) than HIV-negative women (18%, relative risk (RR)=4.3, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) = 2.4, 7.7). SILs were more frequent among women infected with HPV at the time of enrolment or with persistent HPV infection, but these associations disappeared after adjusting for HIV serostatus. Spontaneous regression of SILs commonly occurs in HIV-negative African women. HIV-infected women with cervical dyskaryosis require gynaecology follow-up.A prospective study was conducted in a gynecology clinic in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, to assess the  short-term evolution of cervical squamous intraepithelial lesions (SIL) associated with HIV and human  papillomavirus (HPV) infections.  Final analysis included 94 women with cytological diagnosis of SIL,  who were seen for initial and follow-up smear control.  All women underwent HIV antibody testing after  pre-test counseling upon recruitment, and polymerase chain reaction was performed to detect HPV.   Out of the 94 women, 38 were infected with HIV and 39 had persistent cases of SIL.  HIV-positive  women had a higher percentage of persistent SIL (76%) than those who were HIV-negative.  SIL  incidence was more frequent among women infected with HPV at the time of enrollment or with  persistent HPV infection.  This study concludes that if HPV infection plays a major role in cervical SIL,  other factors contribute to the progression or regression of the lesion, particularly HIV-induced  immunosuppression.  Therefore, HIV screening should be offered to women with SIL, and specific  gynecology follow-up should be conducted on HIV-infected women with cervical SIL in Africa.",M1
10232312,"Efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole prophylaxis to decrease morbidity and mortality in HIV-1-infected patients with tuberculosis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: There is a high incidence of opportunistic infection among HIV-1-infected patients with tuberculosis in Africa and, consequently, high mortality. We assessed the safety and efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole 800 mg/160 mg (co-trimoxazole) prophylaxis in prevention of such infections and in decrease of morbidity and mortality. METHODS: Between October, 1995, and April, 1998, we enrolled 771 HIV-1 seropositive and HIV-1 and HIV-2 dually seroreactive patients who had sputum-smear-positive pulmonary tuberculosis (median age 32 years [range 18-64], median CD4-cell count 317 cells/microL) attending Abidjan's four largest outpatient tuberculosis treatment centres. Patients were randomly assigned one daily tablet of co-trimoxazole (n=386) or placebo (n=385) 1 month after the start of a standard 6-month tuberculosis regimen. We assessed adherence to study drug and tolerance monthly for 5 months and every 3 months thereafter, as well as rates of admission to hospital. FINDINGS: Rates of laboratory and clinical adverse events were similar in the two groups. 51 patients in the co-trimoxazole group (13.8/100 person-years) and 86 in the placebo group (25.4/100 person-years) died (decrease In risk 46% [95% <e>CI</e> 23-62], p&lt;0.001). 29 patients on co-trimoxazole (8.2/100 person-years) and 47 on placebo (15.0/100 person-years) were admitted to hospital at least once after randomisation (decrease 43% [10-64]), p=0.02). There were significantly fewer admissions for septicaemia and enteritis in the co-trimoxazole group than in the placebo group. INTERPRETATION: In HIV-1-infected patients with tuberculosis, daily co-trimoxazole prophylaxis was well tolerated and significantly decreased mortality and hospital admission rates. Our findings may have important implications for improvement of clinical care for such patients in Africa.",M1
10232311,"Early chemoprophylaxis with trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole for HIV-1-infected adults in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: a randomised trial. Cotrimo-<e>CI</e> Study Group.BACKGROUND: In sub-Saharan Africa, various bacterial diseases occur before pneumocystosis or toxoplasmosis in the course of HIV-1 infection, and are major causes of morbidity and mortality. We did a randomised, double blind, placebo-controlled clinical trial at community-health centres in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, to assess the efficacy of trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (co-trimoxazole) chemoprophylaxis at early stages of HIV-1 infection. METHOD: 843 HIV-infected patients were screened and 545 enrolled in the study. Eligible adults (with HIV-1 or HIV-1 and HIV-2 dual seropositivity at stages 2 or 3 of the WHO staging system) received co-trimoxazole chemoprophylaxis (trimethoprim 160 mg, sulphamethoxazole 800 mg) daily or a matching placebo. The primary outcome was the occurrence of severe clinical events, defined as death or hospital admission irrespective of the cause. Analyses were by intention to treat. FINDINGS: Four of the randomised patients were excluded (positive for HIV-2 only). 120 severe events occurred among 271 patients in the co-trimoxazole group and 198 among 270 in the placebo group. Significantly fewer patients in the co-trimoxazole group than in the placebo group had at least one severe event (84 vs 124); the probability of remaining free of severe events was 63.7% versus 45.8% (hazard ratio 0.57 [95% CI 0.43-0.75], p=0.0001) and the benefit was apparent in all subgroups of initial CD4-cell count. Survival did not differ between the groups (41 vs 46 deaths, p=0.51). Co-trimoxazole was generally well tolerated though moderate neutropenia occurred in 62 patients (vs 26 in the placebo group). INTERPRETATION: Patients who might benefit from co-trimoxazole could be recruited on clinical criteria in community clinics without knowing the patients CD4-cell count. This affordable measure will enable quick public-health intervention, while monitoring bacterial susceptibility and haematological tolerance.",M1
10197381,"Impaired fertility in HIV-1-infected pregnant women: a clinic-based survey in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 1997.OBJECTIVE: Differences in fertility among HIV-1-positive and HIV-negative women tested in prenatal clinics were suspected by routine data collection in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. This study was conducted on detailed fertility patterns among women at the same antenatal care centres, in order to assess these differences. METHOD: The survey was carried out on 1201 consecutive women who agreed to be tested for HIV. Data collected included a detailed account of pregnancies, the time interval between the last two pregnancies, and the health status at the time of the survey. Blood samples were tested for HIV and syphilis with informed consent. RESULTS: Despite an earlier exposure to pregnancy risk, HIV-1-infected women aged 25 years and above, had, on the average, fewer pregnancies than uninfected women. An analysis of the interval between the last two pregnancies among multigravidae showed that, all things being equal, being HIV-1 positive decreased the risk of being pregnant by 17% (Cox regression, hazard ratio = 0.83, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 0.69-0.99). This shift in the occurrence of the last pregnancy was more profound among HIV-1-positive women already at the symptomatic or AIDS stage, than among asymptomatic women. CONCLUSION: These data confirm that women infected by HIV-1 would become pregnant less often than uninfected women, for an equal exposure to the risk of pregnancy. Therefore HIV-1-positive women could be under-represented at antenatal centres. Programmes involving such settings both for epidemiological surveillance and the reduction of mother-to-child transmission should take this observation into account.",M1

OBJECTIVES: To describe the spectrum of opportunistic infection among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infected adults hospitalised in the respiratory medicine unit in Abidjan, and the level of immunosuppression at which these diseases occur. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. RESULTS: Overall, 75% of patients were HIV-positive: among these patients, the most frequent diagnosis was tuberculosis, in 61%, followed by bacterial pneumonia (15%), Gram-negative septicaemia (particularly non-typhoid Salmonella) (9%) and empyema (5%). Atypical pneumonias appeared to be rare. Most HIV-positive patients had CD4 counts indicative of advanced immunosuppression: 36% had CD4 counts below 100 x 10(6)/l, 19% between 100 and 199 x 10(6)/l, 29% between 200 and 499 x 10(6)/l, and 16% above 500 x 10(6)/l. Overall in-hospital mortality was 27% for HIV-positive patients and 22% for HIV-negative patients (P = 0.5). In a multivariate analysis, the strongest independent risk factors for death were cachexia (odds ratio [OR] 7.4, 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>] 2.1-26.3), male sex (OR 4.5, 95% CI 1.2-17.4) and age over 40 (OR 4.1, 95% CI 1.0-17.2). CONCLUSIONS: Tuberculosis and bacterial infections are the major causes of respiratory morbidity in immunosuppressed HIV-infected adults in this population. Efforts to improve the management of HIV-related disease need to focus on prevention and treatment of these infections.",M1
9702593,"HIV-1 infection and reproductive history: a retrospective study among pregnant women, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, 1995-1996. Ditrame Project.The aim of this paper is to determine the differences of fertility between HIV-1 infected and uninfected women in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, using data available in an observational study conducted in 1995 and 1996 in 2 antenatal care centres in the district of Yopougon, Abidjan, within an intervention programme to reduce mother-to-child HIV-1 transmission (DITRAME project, ANRS 049). Fertility indicators have been constructed from retrospective data on pregnancies and births, and univariate and multivariate analyses have been performed on these indicators and stratified by age groups to compare HIV-1 positive and HIV-negative populations. The main outcome measures were the number of pregnancies, the number of miscarriages, the risk of miscarriage and the proportion of primigravida. Four thousand, three hundred and ninety-six women agreed to HIV testing: 12.1% were found to be HIV-1 infected. HIV-1 positive women had significantly fewer pregnancies than HIV-negatives in age-groups 25-29 (P = 0.05) and 30-34 (P = 0.008). The risk of having had at least one abortion or stillbirth was significantly higher for HIV-1 infected women than for HIV-negatives (OR = 1.28, 95% <e>CI</e>: 1.02-1.60), when controlling for social and demographic factors. This study suggests that HIV-1 infection has deleterious consequences on female fertility, with lower fertility rates and more frequent adverse pregnancy outcomes. Family planning and antenatal care services should consider antenatal HIV counselling and testing in women in areas of high HIV prevalence.",M1
9635533,"Squamous intraepithelial lesions of the cervix, invasive cervical carcinoma, and immunosuppression induced by human immunodeficiency virus in Africa. Dyscer-<e>CI</e> Group.BACKGROUND: Squamous intraepithelial lesions (SILs) of the cervix are associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but multiple risk factors must be considered in this context. The authors performed a cross-sectional study to assess the prevalence of and the factors associated with SILs and invasive cervical carcinoma (ICC). METHODS: In Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, women were recruited from three outpatient gynecology clinics and screened for both cervical disease and HIV infection. A CD4 cell count was performed for HIV-infected women. RESULTS: A total of 2198 women were included in the study. The prevalence of HIV infection was 21.7%. Of the 2170 women who underwent a cervical screening, 254 (11.7%) presented with a dysplasia or neoplasia: 7.6% had low grade SILs (LSILs), 3.3% had high grade SILs (HSILs), and 0.8% had ICCs. In multivariate analyses, factors associated with these lesions were as follows: for LSILs, HIV-1 seropositivity, age &lt;24 years, parity &gt;1, consultation for genital infection, and no use of oral contraception in the past; for HSILs, HIV-1 seropositivity, chewing tobacco use, low educational level, and parity &gt;1; and for ICCs, age &gt;33 years, parity &gt;3, and illiteracy. In women infected with HIV-1, the prevalence of LSILs increased with a decrease in CD4 cell count, whereas this relation was not found among patients with HSILs. ICCs were linked to HIV-2 infection, but not to HIV-1 infection, in univariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In Africa, the prevalence of SILs is high. The factors associated with precancerous and cancerous lesions are different. Cancers in women infected with HIV-1 often may not reach the invasive stage. These findings could have implications for cervical screening programs in the future.",M1
9562051,"HIV counseling and testing: behavior and practices of women of childbearing age in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. DYSCER-<e>CI</e> Group.We assessed factors associated with women's attitudes toward HIV test results in gynecology clinics in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. HIV testing was systematically offered to nonpregnant women attending two gynecology clinics in Abidjan. Individual pretest counseling was performed by trained midwives. Posttest counseling was given 2 weeks later to women who wished to know their HIV test results. HIV testing was offered to a total of 1482 women, of whom 1401 (94.5%) agreed to be screened. The prevalence of HIV infection was 21.3%. Of the women who participated, 10% failed to return. Youth, low educational level, and absence of genital infection were findings individually associated with failure by participants to return for their test results. Among the 1242 women who returned, 13.7% did not wish to know the results of their HIV test. A positive HIV test result, being native to Côte d'Ivoire, a high educational level, and knowing the existence of the asymptomatic stage of HIV infection were factors independently associated with declining to know the HIV test result. In conclusion, women who declined to know their HIV test results presented a specific profile at the time of HIV testing. This information can be used to improve pretest counseling and the efficacy of future HIV screening programs.",M1
9342059,"The associations between cervicovaginal HIV shedding, sexually transmitted diseases and immunosuppression in female sex workers in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.OBJECTIVE: To measure the frequency and associated factors of cervicovaginal HIV shedding and to determine the impact of sexually transmitted disease (STD) treatment on HIV shedding. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with 1-week follow-up. SETTING: Confidential clinic for female sex workers in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1201 female sex workers. INTERVENTIONS: STD treatment based on clinical signs. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV serostatus; cervicovaginal HIV shedding at enrollment and at 1-week follow-up; STD status at enrollment and at 1-week follow-up. RESULTS: Cervicovaginal shedding of HIV-1 in HIV-1-seropositive women was more frequent (96 out of 404, 24%) than shedding of HIV-2 in HIV-2-seropositive women [one out of 21, 5%; odds ratio (OR), 6.2; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>), 1.0-261]. Among 609 HIV-1-seropositive or dually seroreactive women, HIV-1 shedding was significantly more frequent in immunosuppressed women [adjusted OR (AOR), 6.3; 95% CI, 3.4-11.9; and AOR, 2.9; 95% CI, 1.6-5.0 for CD4 &lt; 14% and CD4 14-28%, respectively, versus CD4 &gt; 28%], and in women with Neisseria gonorrhoeae (AOR, 1.9; 95% CI, 1.2-3.0), those with Chlamydia trachomatis (AOR, 2.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8), and with a cervical or vaginal ulcer (AOR, 3.9; 95% CI, 2.1-7.4). HIV-1 shedding decreased from 42 to 21% (P &lt; 0.005) in women whose STD were cured. CONCLUSIONS: These data help to explain the difference in transmissibility between HIV-1 and HIV-2 and the increased infectiousness of HIV in the presence of immunosuppression and STD. In addition, they lend biological plausibility to arguments for making STD control an integral part of HIV prevention strategies in Africa.",M1
9302446,"Profound immunosuppression across the spectrum of opportunistic disease among hospitalized HIV-infected adults in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.OBJECTIVES: To describe the spectrum of opportunistic disease in HIV-infected patients admitted to hospital in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, and to describe the level of immunosuppression at which these diseases occur. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: In-patient wards of the University Hospital Infectious Diseases Unit. PATIENTS: A total of 250 adult patients recruited by systematic sampling at the point of hospital admission. MAIN MEASURES: HIV status; CD4 count; diagnoses, confirmed by microbiological/radiological investigations whenever possible; and outcome of hospitalization (death or discharge). RESULTS: Overall, 79% patients were HIV-positive. The most frequent diagnoses in HIV-positive patients were septicaemia (20%, with non-typhoid salmonellae, Escherichia coli and Streptococcus pneumoniae the most common organisms), HIV wasting (16%), meningitis (14%), tuberculosis (TB; 13%), isosporiasis (10%), cerebral toxoplasmosis (7%) and bacterial enteritis (7%). Most HIV-positive patients had evidence of severe immunosuppression: 39% had CD4 counts &lt; 50 x 10(6)/l, 17% had 50-99 x 10(6)/l, and 20% had 100-199 x 10(6)/l. In-hospital mortality among HIV-positive patients was 38% compared with 27% among HIV-negative patients [age-adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.5; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>), 0.7-2.9]. Among HIV-positive patients, the highest case-fatality rates were among patients with meningitis, toxoplasmosis and TB: in a multivariate analysis the strongest independent risk factors for death were an abnormal level of consciousness (OR, 9.3; 95% CI, 3.5-24.6), a haemoglobin concentration below 8 g/dl (OR, 4.2; 95% CI, 1.4-12.8) and age &gt; 40 years (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.5-10.2). CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that, as in industrialized countries, most HIV-infected individuals admitted to and dying in hospital in Abidjan are profoundly immunosuppressed. Potentially preventable infections are the main causes of in-hospital morbidity and mortality among HIV-infected persons in Abidjan, and the evaluation of appropriate primary prophylactic regimes is a priority.",M1
9107243,"Late postnatal mother-to-child transmission of HIV-1 in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.BACKGROUND: HIV-1 can be transmitted from an infected mother to her infant through breastfeeding, although the precise risk of transmission by this route is unknown. A long-term follow-up of children born to HIV-infected women in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire, has enabled us to estimate this risk. METHODS: Children born to 138 HIV-1-seropositive women, 132 HIV-2-seropositive women, 69 women seroreactive to both HIV-1 and HIV-2, and 274 HIV-seronegative women were enrolled at birth and followed up for as long as 48 months. All children were breastfed (median duration 20 months). Blood samples for either or both HIV PCR and HIV serology were obtained at 1, 2, and 3 months of age, and every 3 months thereafter. Early HIV infection was defined as a positive HIV-1 PCR result obtained in the first 6 months of life. Late postnatal transmission was diagnosed when a child had a negative PCR at 3 or 6 months of age, followed by either or both a positive HIV-1 PCR at 9 months or older, or persistently positive HIV-1 serology at 15 months or older. FINDINGS: 82 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and 57 children born to mothers seropositive for both HIV-1 and HIV-2 had PCR results for samples taken within the first 6 months. By 6 months of age, 23 (28%; 95% <e>CI</e> 19-39) of the 82 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and ten (18%; 95% CI 9-30) of the 57 children born to dually seropositive mothers were HIV-1 infected. Among children whose PCR results were negative at or before age 6 months, and who were followed up beyond 6 months, an additional four (9%) of the 45 children born to HIV-1-seropositive mothers and two (5%) of the 39 children born to dually seropositive mothers became HIV infected. The estimated rates of late postnatal transmission, with account taken of loss to follow-up and the observed pattern of weaning, were 12% (95% CI 3-23) and 6% (0-14), respectively. One of the five children whose mothers seroconverted from HIV-negative to HIV-1, and one of seven children whose mothers seroconverted from HIV-2 to dual reactivity, became HIV-1 positive. No case of late postnatal transmission occurred in children born to HIV-2-positive or persistently HIV-negative mothers. INTERPRETATION: Breastfed children born to mothers seropositive for HIV-1 alone or seropositive for HIV-1 and HIV-2 in Abidjan are at substantial risk of late postnatal transmission. Early cessation of breastfeeding at 6 months of age should be assessed as a possible intervention to reduce postnatal transmission of HIV.",M1
8827224,"In vivo and in vitro sequence diversity of the V3 env region of HIV type 1 from the Ivory Coast.Nine divergent clades of HIV-1 have been detected in Africa, indicating a far greater genetic diversity of the virus on the continent relative to elsewhere in the world.  The envelope of HIV-1, especially the V3 loop, which is implicated in viral tropism and in the neutralizing domain, is considered to be a major target for vaccine research.  The authors analyzed proviral DNA and RNA viral sequences of the V3 region of the env gene obtained from the plasma and lymphocytes of six people with AIDS originating from the Ivory Coast.  The four men and two women exhibited clinical AIDS and pulmonary tuberculosis.  The inferred amino acid sequence of the V3 region derived from the DNA sequences obtained in the study were aligned together with the reference sequence of subtype A from the Los Alamos HIV sequence database.  The identity of the conserved tetrapeptide motif at the tip of the V3 loop in all the isolates is GPGQ and is consistent with the common motif sequence found in the database for the A subtype.  The major changes in the amino acids are localized in the flanking sequences of the V3 loop.  The V3 loop of HIV isolates from patient <e>CI</e>-39 presents a change of D to R in position 25, associated with an unusual change in position 24 of G to D.  These mutations were found in both viral RNA sequences and in the proviral DNA sequences from uncultured peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs), possibly reflecting an infectious viral variant which is actively expressed in vivo and present in plasma.  The change of an acidic amino acid to a basic amino acid at position 25 appears to be an important viral tropism determinant.",M1
8556401,"High rates of sexual contact with female sex workers, sexually transmitted diseases, and condom neglect among HIV-infected and uninfected men with tuberculosis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.To characterize human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk practices among men with tuberculosis, and to determine what factors are associated with HIV infection in this population, we conducted a case-control analysis of data collected during enrollment in a prospective cohort study in the two large tuberculosis treatment centers of Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Demographic information and data on risk factors for HIV infection, including history of sex with female sex workers (FSWs) and history of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), were collected on 490 HIV-infected and 239 HIV-uninfected men diagnosed with pulmonary tuberculosis between 1989 and 1992. HIV-infected men were significantly more likely than uninfected men to have had sex with FSWs in their lifetime [83 versus 63%, odds ratio (OR) 2.9, 95% confidence internal (<e>CI</e>) 2.0-4.2], genital ulcer disease in the past 5 years (38 versus 15%, OR 3.4, 95% CI 2.2-5.2), urethritis in the past 5 years (44 versus 23%, OR 2.6, 95% CI 1.8-3.8), and sex with FSWs in the past year (43 versus 25%, OR 2.3, 95% CI 1.6-3.3); no difference was found in the proportion with at least one non-FSW partner in the past year (84 versus 79%, OR 1.3, 95% CI 0.9-2.0). Among all men, 74% never used condoms, and only 1.4% always used condoms. In a multivariate analysis, sex with FSWs, genital ulcer disease, urethritis, and lack of circumcision were all significantly associated with HIV. This study demonstrates the critical roles of commercial sex, STDs, and condom neglect in fueling the HIV/AIDS epidemic in Abidjan, and illustrates the urgent need for widespread HIV education both in the general population and in men with tuberculosis.",M1
8594681,"Human immunodeficiency virus infection and human African trypanosomiasis: a case-control study in Côte d'Ivoire.To assess the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection and human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) in Côte d'Ivoire, West Africa, a cross-sectional case-control study was conducted on 301 HAT patients recruited in the main foci of the country. For each HAT patient, 3 controls, matched for sex, age and residence, were selected. Data relating to socio-demographic factors and potential risk factors for Trypanosoma brucei gambiense and HIV infections were obtained, and serum samples were collected for HIV-1 and HIV-2 tests. A positive test consisted of enzyme immunoassay reactive to HIV-1, HIV-2 or both and confirmed by a synthetic peptide test or Western blot. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression with EGRET software. No statistically significant difference was found between the prevalence of HIV infection in HAT patients and controls (4.3% and 3.5% respectively; crude odds ratio (OR) 1.28, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 0.65-2.50). In multivariate analysis, allowance for 5 covariates did not change the association between the 2 infections (adjusted OR 1.27, 95% CI 0.64-2.52). Although this study had limited statistical power, no significant association was found between HIV infection and T.b. gambiense infection in rural Côte d'Ivoire. Studies are needed to determine whether HIV infection influences the clinical course of HAT, a question not addressed in the present study.",M1
7552498,"The epidemic of HIV/AIDS in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire: a review of data collected by Projet RETRO-<e>CI</e> from 1987 to 1993.We present a review of epidemiologic data collected by Projet RETRO-CI between 1987 and 1993 on trends in human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and HIV-2 infections and on cases of AIDS in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. Overall rates of HIV infection in pregnant women had already reached 10% in 1987, and have increased only modestly since then. In contrast, in 1992-1993, rates in men with sexually transmitted diseases and in female commercial sex workers reached 27 and 86%, respectively. The increases in infection rates have been largely due to transmission of HIV-1, whereas rates of HIV-2 have remained stable or have declined. Among persons with tuberculosis and hospitalized patients, rates of 46-71% have been reached, increases in recent years again being largely attributable to HIV-1. Among the 15,245 AIDS cases reported by Projet RETRO-CI, a steady decline in the male:female sex ratio has occurred over time, from 4.8:1 in 1988 to 1.9:1 in 1993. It is likely that AIDS cases were initially concentrated among a core group of female commercial sex workers and their male clients. A substantial proportion of sex workers and their clients originate from neighboring countries, and migration is likely to have contributed to the spread of HIV infection in West Africa. Including HIV-associated pulmonary tuberculosis as an AIDS-defining illness increased AIDS cases reported by Projet RETRO-CI by 13% in 1993. Despite a need for interventional research, careful description of the evolution of HIV/AIDS in this region remains essential.",M1
7898177,"Response to treatment, mortality, and CD4 lymphocyte counts in HIV-infected persons with tuberculosis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.We examined the severity of immune deficiency in patients with HIV-associated tuberculosis in Côte d'Ivoire and assessed its effect on mortality and response to treatment. Consecutive patients attending a tuberculosis treatment centre in Abidjan with smear-positive pulmonary or clinically diagnosed extrapulmonary tuberculosis were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections and had CD4 lymphocyte counts measured. Patients received standard short-course chemotherapy. Analysis of outcome (restricted to smear-positive tuberculosis patients) was done at 6 months. The 247 HIV-positive patients were significantly more likely than the 312 HIV-negative patients to have CD4 lymphocyte counts of less than 200/microL (43% vs 1%; odds ratio 56.9; [95% <e>CI</e> 19.7-185.3]) and 200-499/microL (39% vs 14%, odds ratio 3.8; [2.5-5.9]). Among HIV-positive patients, median CD4 lymphocyte counts in those with extrapulmonary tuberculosis (198/microL; n = 67) was lower, but not significantly so, than among those with pulmonary tuberculosis (257/microL; n = 180). Among 460 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis, the overall mortality rate was significantly higher in HIV-positive than HIV-negative persons (6% vs 0.4%; relative risk 17.1 [2.2-131.4]), and increased with the severity of immune deficiency; mortality rates in HIV-positive patients with CD4 counts of &lt; 200/microL and 200-499/microL were 10% and 4%, relative risk 27.6 (3.5-220.8); and 11.5 (1.2-109), respectively, compared to HIV-negatives. Among patients completing treatment, cure rates were similar in HIV-positive patients (93%) and HIV-negative patients (92%), and were not related to CD4 counts. Severity of immune deficiency was the major determinant of mortality in HIV-associated tuberculosis. Among people completing treatment, microbiological response was satisfactory irrespective of serological or immune status.",M1
7694962,"Emergence of Buruli ulcer disease in the Daloa region of Cote d'Ivoire.Recent reports have suggested increases in Buruli ulcer (BU), an infection caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans in west Africa. In 1991, we conducted surveillance for BU in a rural area of Cote d'Ivoire and identified 312 cases of active or healed ulceration. A case-control study was then performed to investigate risk factors for this infection. The rate of illness did not appear to differ between males and females (5.2% versus 7.5%; P = 0.11). The highest rate of illness was seen in the 10-14-year-old age group (143 cases per 1,000 population). New cases increased more than three-fold between 1987 and 1991, and local prevalence of BU was as high as 16.3%. Twenty-six percent of persons with healed ulcers had chronic functional disability. Participation in farming activities near the main river in the region was identified in the case-control study as a risk factor for infection (odds ratio [OR] for each 10-min decrease in walking distance between the fields and the river = 1.52, 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>] 1.01, 2.28, P = 0.046). Wearing long pants was protective (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.06, 0.62, P &lt; 0.005). We conclude that the incidence of BU is increasing rapidly in Cote d'Ivoire. Specific causes of this increase were not identified, but wearing protective clothing appeared to decrease the risk of disease.",M1
7718839,"Impact of the HIV epidemic on trends in tuberculosis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire.SETTING: West African capital city with excellent, population-based notification of tuberculosis cases during a decade with a rapidly emerging HIV epidemic. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of the HIV epidemic on tuberculosis in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. DESIGN: Review of data on all cases of tuberculosis registered in the city in alternate years from 1981 to 1991 and calculation of population-based rates using census data. Also, systematic study of HIV seroprevalence among tuberculosis patients in 1989 and 1991. RESULTS: In 1981, several years before any health consequences of HIV were discernible in Abidjan, the incidence of tuberculosis was 155 per 100,000. By 1991, the rate of tuberculosis among HIV-seronegative persons had decreased by 38% to 96 per 100,000; however, 43.6% of tuberculosis patients were HIV-infected, and the incidence of tuberculosis among HIV-infected persons was 1104 per 100,000 (relative risk 11.5, 95% <e>CI</e> 10.8-12.3), yielding an overall observed incidence of tuberculosis of 159 per 100,000 population. The population attributable risk of tuberculosis due to HIV infection increased from 36% to 40% between 1989 and 1991. CONCLUSIONS: The HIV epidemic has reversed the expected steep decline in tuberculosis in Abidjan over the past decade, and the impact of HIV infection on the incidence of tuberculosis may be accelerating.",M1

DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. SETTING: Maternal and child health center in a lower socioeconomic class district of Abidjan, Ivory Coast. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 18,099 women delivering between 1990 and 1992 were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies. A cohort of 613 pregnant women and their infants was followed prospectively (138 women reactive to HIV-1, 132 reactive to HIV-2, 69 reactive to both viruses, and 274 HIV-seronegative). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of perinatal transmission for HIV-1, HIV-2, and both viruses, determined from results of serological and polymerase chain reaction tests on children; survival of infants born to HIV-1-positive, HIV-2-positive, dually reactive, and HIV-seronegative women. RESULTS: Of the 18,099 women tested, 9.4% were reactive to HIV-1 alone, 1.6% to HIV-2 alone, and 1.0% to both viruses. The rate of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 was 24.7% (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 15.8% to 33.7%), compared with 1.2% (95% CI, 0.0% to 3.5%) for HIV-2 (relative risk, 21.3; 95% CI, 2.9 to 154.3). Overall, 19.0% (95% CI, 9.0% to 29.0%) of infants of dually reactive women became infected; of the 11 children concerned, 10 were infected with HIV-1 and one with HIV-1 and HIV-2. Infants of HIV-seropositive mothers had a reduced survival; mortality rates were 15.1, 13.0, 6.5, and 3.4 deaths per 100 child-years, respectively, for children of HIV-1-positive, dually reactive, HIV-2-positive, and HIV-seronegative women. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of perinatal transmission of HIV-2 (1.2%) was much lower than the rate of perinatal transmission of HIV-1 (24.7%), and this was associated with more favorable survival for infants of HIV-2-infected mothers. Dually reactive women could transmit both viruses, although transmission usually involved HIV-1 only. Public health guidelines should incorporate advice that perinatal transmission of HIV-2 is rare.",M1
8274919,"Excluding blood donors at high risk of HIV infection in a west African city.OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential impact of deferral of blood donors at high risk of HIV infection in a west African city where blood is screened for HIV antibodies but no other special measures are taken to protect the blood supply. DESIGN: Cross sectional study. SETTING: National Blood Transfusion Centre and Project RETRO-<e>CI</e>, an international collaborative AIDS research project, Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. SUBJECTS: 1257 male first time blood donors. INTERVENTIONS: Blood donors were interviewed about demographic and behavioural characteristics and tested for HIV antibodies by enzyme immunoassay and, if positive, synthetic peptide based tests. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: HIV antibody status in relation to presence of behavioural risk factors; calculation of sensitivity, specificity, and predictive values of specific criteria for excluding HIV infected donors. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of HIV infection was 11.4%. The most important risk factors for HIV positivity were prostitute contact and being aged 30-39 years. For identifying seropositive donors individual criteria had sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values ranging from 15% to 98%, 38% to 91%, and 17% to 30% respectively. Prostitute contact in the past five years would have excluded 31% of all donors and 73% of HIV infected donors. 27% of those excluded would have been HIV positive. CONCLUSIONS: The widespread assumption that donor deferral is not feasible in sub-Saharan Africa needs reassessment. In Abidjan this approach was well accepted and potentially effective. Donor deferral requires evaluation as a strategy for improving blood safety in resource poor areas with high rates of HIV infection.During February-November 1991 in Abidjan, the Ivory Coast, interviews with 1257 male first-time blood donors and screening of their blood for antibodies to HIV-1 and HIV-2 were conducted at the National Blood Transfusion Center to determine whether it is feasible to exclude or defer donors at high risk of HIV infection. 143 (11.4%) men had antibodies to HIV. The multivariate analysis showed that the strongest risk factor for HIV infection was sex with prostitutes in the last 5 years without regular condom use (odds ratio [OR] = 10, confidence interval [CI] = 6.6-15) followed by prostitute contact in the last 5 years regardless of condom use (OR = 8.4, CI = 5.6-12.6), and an age of 30-39 years (OR = 6.9, CI = 18). 27% of all donors with prostitute contact in the last 5 years were infected (positive predictive value). If the center had used prostitute contact in the last 5 years as a criterion, it would have discarded 31% of all units of blood. Thus, more than 75% of all potentially excluded units would have been from donors infected with HIV. The sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values ranged from 15% to 98%, 38% to 91%, and 17% to 30%, respectively. These findings suggest that it is feasible in Abidjan to exclude donors based on behavioral characteristics of those most at risk of HIV infection. Donor deferral should be evaluated as a strategy to improve blood safety in resource-poor areas with high rates of HIV infection.",M1
8395857,"Rapid and simple screening and supplemental testing for HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections in west Africa.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate a combination of rapid tests as a strategy for screening and supplemental testing of serum for HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 antibodies. DESIGN: Cross-sectional evaluation. SETTING: Projet RETRO-<e>CI</e>, an AIDS research project in Abidjan, Côte d'Ivoire. METHODS: Serum specimens were collected from 1000 consecutive women giving birth in an Abidjan maternal and child health centre and from 185 hospitalized patients. All serum specimens were tested for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies by whole-virus enzyme immunoassay; repeatedly reactive specimens were further tested by virus-specific Western blot and synthetic peptide-based tests. This was the reference strategy against which the algorithm under evaluation was compared. All specimens were subsequently tested by a mixed (HIV-1 and HIV-2) recombinant antigen-based test (Abbott Testpack), followed, if positive, by a rapid synthetic peptide-based test (Genetic Systems Genie) as a supplemental test. RESULTS: According to the reference strategy the prevalence of HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 infection was 13% among the pregnant women and 78% among the hospitalized patients. Compared with the reference strategy, the combination of rapid tests was associated with a sensitivity of 99.6%, a specificity of 99.9%, and positive and negative predictive values of 99.6 and 99.9%, respectively. Four per cent of HIV-2-positive and 1% of HIV-1-positive specimens were considered dually reactive by the rapid test combination. CONCLUSIONS: Synthetic peptide-based tests provide an alternative to Western blots for supplemental testing for HIV-1 and HIV-2. This combination of rapid tests offers performance characteristics comparable to an enzyme immunoassay and Western blot-based strategy, without requiring running water, electricity, or a well-developed laboratory. High-quality serodiagnosis of HIV-1 and HIV-2 infections is possible at the most peripheral levels of the health-care system in developing countries, the limiting factors being the costs of tests and training of staff.Researchers from an AIDS research project took blood samples from 1000 consecutive women during childbirth at a maternal and child health center in Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, and from 185 hospitalized patients to compare the results of a combination of synthetic peptide-based rapid tests (product names, Testpack and Genie), which check for HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies, with those of the Western Blot-based test.  They also wanted to see whether the rapid test-based strategy could replace the Western Blot-based test as a supplemental test.  The Western Blot indicated the HIV-1 and/or HIV-2 prevalence to be 13% among the new mothers and 78% among the hospitalized patients for an overall prevalence of 23%.  3.3% of all people were positive for both HIV-1 and HIV-2.  17.4% tested positive for just HIV-1.  2.1% were positive for HIV-2.  The rapid tests had a sensitivity of 99.6% and a specificity of 99.9%.  The positive predictive value was 99.6% and the negative predictive value was 99.9%.  The rapid tests identified 4% of the HIV-2 positive samples and 1% of the HIV-1 samples to be dually reactive. These findings demonstrated that rapid synthetic peptide-based assays reliably detect HIV-1 and HIV-2 antibodies and can be supplemental tests.  High quality HIV serology can be performed in a setting without running water and electricity which was the case in this study.  A further advantage of this strategy is that each test takes only 10 minutes.  These tests would have significant effects on HIV testing and counseling, diagnosis, and screening of blood for transfusion in rural areas of developing countries.",M1

20088925,"Air pollution and hospitalization for venous thromboembolic disease in Chile.BACKGROUND: Ambient air pollution is a risk factor for stroke and myocardial infarction, possibly because of alterations in coagulation that influence the arterial circulation. Whether air pollution influences diseases associated with peripheral venous thrombogenesis remains largely unknown. OBJECTIVES: To determine the association between air pollution and venous thromboembolic disease (VTE) in a sample of the general population. METHODS: A time-series analysis was used to test the association between daily air pollution and VTE hospitalizations in Santiago between 2001 and 2005. Results were adjusted for long-term trends, day of the week and average daily humidex. RESULTS: From a population of 5.4 million, there were, on average, 2.3 admissions for VTE per day. Pooled estimates of relative risk (RR) [95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>)] of hospitalization for venous disease were: 1.07 (1.05, 1.09) for a 58.4 p.p.b. increase in ozone (O(3)); 1.06 (1.02, 1.09) for a 5.85 p.p.b. increase in sulphur dioxide (SO(2)); 1.08 (1.03, 1.12) for a 29.25 microg/m(3) increase in nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)); and 1.05 (1.03, 1.06) for a 20.02 microg/m(3) increase in particulate matter &lt; or = 2.5 microm in mean aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5)).

20066914,"Particulate air pollution and health effects for cardiovascular and respiratory causes in Temuco, Chile: a wood-smoke-polluted urban area.Temuco is one of the most highly wood-smoke-polluted cities in the world. Its population in 2004 was 340,000 inhabitants with 1587 annual deaths, of which 24% were due to cardiovascular and 11% to respiratory causes. For hospital admissions, cardiovascular diseases represented 6% and respiratory diseases 13%. Emergency room visits for acute respiratory infections represented 28%. The objective of the study presented here was to determine the relationship between air pollution from particulate matter less than or equal to 10 microm in aerodynamic diameter (PM10; mostly PM2.5, or particulate matter &lt;2.5 microm in aerodynamic diameter) and health effects measured as the daily number of deaths, hospital admissions, and emergency room visits for cardiovascular, respiratory, and acute respiratory infection (ARI) diseases. The Air Pollution Health Effects European Approach (APHEA2) protocol was followed, and a multivariate Poisson regression model was fitted, controlling for trend, seasonality, and confounders for Temuco during 1998-2006. The results show that PM10 had a significant association with daily mortality and morbidity, with the elderly (population &gt;65 yr of age) being the group that presented the greatest risk. The relative risk for respiratory causes, with an increase of 100 microg/m3 of PM10, was 1.163 with a 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) of 1.057-1.279 for mortality, 1.137 (CI 1.096-1.178) for hospital admissions, and 1.162 for ARI (CI 1.144-1.181). There is evidence in Temuco of positive relationships between ambient particulate levels and mortality, hospital admissions, and ARI for cardiovascular and respiratory diseases. These results are consistent with those of comparable studies in other similar cities where wood smoke is the most important air pollution problem.",M2
20064497,"Influence of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA haplogroups on thrombosis susceptibility and frequency of four genetic prothrombotic variants in Southern Chilean subjects.BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that the ethnic background may determine the susceptibility to cardiovascular diseases. Considering the genetic composition of Chilean population, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible association between Amerindian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) haplogroups and venous thrombosis susceptibility and the influence on frequency of factor V 1691G&gt;A, prothrombin 20210G&gt;A, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C&gt;T and beta-fibrinogen -148C&gt;T polymorphisms in Southern Chilean population. METHODS: A total of 172 individuals, 60 patients with diagnosis of deep venous thrombosis (DVT) confirmed by Doppler ultrasonography and 112 controls were included in this study. The single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and the Amerindian mtDNA haplogroups were detected by PCR and PCR-RFLP techniques, respectively. RESULTS: The presence of mtDNA haplogroups did not modify the thrombosis susceptibility. Of 4 SNPs genotyped, only the MTHFR 677C&gt;T variant was more frequent in DVT patients when compared to controls (OR 3.46; 95%<e>CI</e>, 1.50-8.00). A lower frequency of 1691G&gt;A (factor V) and a total absence of prothrombin 20210G&gt;A variants were observed in subjects with Amerindian background. CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Amerindian haplogroups did not modify the susceptibility to DVT in the studied subjects. Only MTHFR 677C&gt;T polymorphism was associated to venous thrombosis in Chilean subjects. The lower frequency of factor V 1691G&gt;A and the absence of prothrombin 20210G&gt;A polymorphism confirm the poor utility of the molecular detection of these variants in the thrombophilia study in populations with Amerindian background.",M2

The 894G&gt;T, -786T&gt;C and 4a/4b polymorphic variants of the NOS3 gene have been implicated in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated the association between occurrence of CAD documented by angiography and the 894G&gt;T, -786T&gt;C and 4a/4b polymorphisms of the NOS3 gene in Southern Chilean individuals. METHODS: A total of 112 unrelated patients with diagnosis of CAD confirmed by angiography and 112 controls were included in this study. The 894G&gt;T and -786T&gt;C single nucleotide polymorphisms were analyzed by PCR-RFLP, and 4a/4b polymorphism just for PCR. RESULTS: The genotype distribution and the relative allelic frequencies for the 3 variants investigated were not significantly different between CAD and control subjects (p=NS). Moreover, the odds ratio for CAD associated with the 894T (OR=1.22, 95% <e>CI</e> 0.76-1.95), -786C (OR=1.16, 95% CI 0.75-1.80) and 4a (OR=0.97, 95% CI 0.48-1.95) variants failed to reach statistical significance.

Their clinical assessment usually includes a fine needle aspiration biopsy (FNAB). AIM: To identify ultrasonographic characteristics associated to papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and generate a score that predicts the risk of PTC. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective review of all fine needle aspiration biopsies of the thyroid performed in a lapse of two years. Biopsies that were conclusive for PTC were selected and compared with an equal amount of randomly selected biopsies that disclosed a benign diagnosis. RESULTS: One hundred twenty two biopsies of a total of 1,498 were conclusive for PTC. Univariate analysis showed associations with PTC for the presence of micro-calcifications (Odds ratio (OR) 49.2: 95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>) 18.7-140.9), solid predominance (OR 25.1; 95% CI 6-220), hypoechogenicity (OR 23.5, 95% CI 6.5-122.6), irregular borders (OR 17, 95% CI 7.2-42.9), lymph node involvement (OR 12.3, 95% CI2.7-112), central vascularization (OR 12.2, 95% CI 4.8-33.3), local invasion and hyperechogenicity (OR 0.2; CI 95% CI 0.03-0.6). Multivariate analysis disclosed microcalcifications (OR 28.1; CI 95% 8.9-89), hypoechogenicity (OR 9.4; 95% CI 1.5-59.5) and irregular borders (OR 4.7; CI 95% 1.5-15) as the variables independently associated with the presence of PTC. The prevalence of PTC in the presence of the three variables was 97.6% (Likelihood ratio (LR) 45) and 5.4% in their absence (LR 0.06).

19915762,"[Predictive factors for smoking initiation and quitting among a cohort of Chilean women followed for 5.5 years]BACKGROUND: Chilean women have one of the highest smoking prevalence in the world. Aim To estimate the main factors associated with smoking initiation and quitting among a cohort of adult women living in a low socioeconomic status area of Santiago, Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A random population-based sample of 1,100 women, 18 years and older, were selected from a community located in the South East area of Santiago. Sociodemographic, as well as smoking, beliefs, behaviors, stages of change and nicotine addiction level were recorded during a personal interview. After an average follow-up period of 5.5 years, women were re-evaluated. RESULTS: Seventy-three percent of women completed the study. At baseline, 39% of women were smokers. At the end of the study, there was an absolute smoking rate reduction of 7.1% (p &lt;0.001). The main variables associated with smoking initiation were younger age (Odds ratio (OR): 1.08, 95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>): 1.05-1.12), higher education level (OR: 1.2, 95% CI: 1.07-1.35), and having fewer children (OR: 1.3 95% CI: 1.01-1.66). Factors related with quitting were younger age of onset (OR: 1.06 95% CI: 1.02-1.1), higher level of nicotine dependence (OR: 4.22, 95% CI: 1.74-10.27), and higher perception of smoking addiction (OR: 4.34, 95% CI: 2-9.09). Stage of change was associated with smoking cessation but its effect was diluted after adjusting for the level of nicotine addiction. CONCLUSIONS: Sociodemographic and family factors were the main variables related with initiation, whereas age of onset, belief of addiction, and nicotine dependence were the main factors related with cessation. Women with a high motivation for quitting should be evaluated for nicotine addiction level to define the best strategy for intervention.",M2

19845936,"The relationship of bottle feeding and other sucking behaviors with speech disorder in Patagonian preschoolers.BACKGROUND: Previous studies have shown that children's nonnutritive sucking habits may lead to delayed development of their oral anatomy and functioning. However, these findings were inconsistent. We investigated associations between use of bottles, pacifiers, and other sucking behaviors with speech disorders in children attending three preschools in Punta Arenas (Patagonia), Chile. METHODS: Information on infant feeding and sucking behaviors, age starting and stopping breast- and bottle-feeding, pacifier use, and other sucking behaviors, was collected from self-administered questionnaires completed by parents. Evaluation of speech problems was conducted at preschools with subsequent scoring by a licensed speech pathologist using age-normative standards. RESULTS: A total of 128 three- to five-year olds were assessed, 46% girls and 54% boys. Children were breastfed for an average of 25.2 (SD 9.6) months and used a bottle 24.4 (SD 15.2) months. Fifty-three children (41.7%) had or currently used a pacifier for an average of 11.4 (SD 17.3) months; 23 children (18.3%) were reported to have sucked their fingers. Delayed use of a bottle until after 9 months appeared to be protective for subsequent speech disorders. There was less than a one-third lower relative odds of subsequent speech disorders for children with a delayed use of a bottle compared to children without a delayed use of a bottle (OR: 0.32, 95% <e>CI</e>: 0.10-0.98). A three-fold increase in relative odds of speech disorder was found for finger-sucking behavior (OR: 2.99, 95% CI: 1.10-8.00) and for use of a pacifier for 3 or more years (OR: 3.42, 95% CI: 1.08-10.81).

DESIGN: Population validation. SETTING: Intensive care units in a 600-bed university hospital. PATIENTS: We studied 29 critical patients undergoing mechanical ventilation. Mean age was 70 years (range 58-77 years), mean APACHE II score 16 (range 13-21), and mean SOFA score 7 (range 4-8). INTERVENTION: Two independent operators applied the Spanish version of the CAM-ICU and a psychiatrist applied the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition-Revised (DSM IV TR). MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLES: Concordance (kappa index), internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha), and validity (sensitivity and specificity) of the Spanish version of the CAM-ICU were compared to the DSM IV TR, which is considered the current gold standard. RESULTS: The translation and cultural adaptation was carried out in accordance with current international guidelines. A total of 65 assessments were performed in 29 patients. The interobserver concordance was high: kappa statistic 0.91 (95% <e>CI</e>: 0.86-0.96). The internal consistence was adequate: Cronbach's alpha=0.84 (unilateral 95% CI: 0.77). For observer A (a physician), the sensitivity of the Spanish version of the CAM-ICU was 80% and the specificity was 96%. For observer B, (a nurse) the sensitivity was 83% and the specificity was 96%. CONCLUSIONS: The Spanish version of the CAM-ICU is a valid, reliable, and reproducible instrument that can be satisfactorily applied to diagnose delirium in Spanish-speaking ICU patients.",M2

Results were adjusted for day of the week and humidex. Three categories of headache-migraine, headache with cause specified, and headache not otherwise specified-were all associated with air pollution. Relative risks for migraine associated with interquartile-range increases in specific air pollutants were as follows: 1.11 (95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 1.06, 1.17) for a 1.15-ppm increase in carbon monoxide; 1.11 (95% CI: 1.06, 1.17) for a 28.97-microg/m(3) increase in nitrogen dioxide; 1.10 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.17) for a 6.20-ppb increase in sulfur dioxide; 1.17 (95% CI: 1.08, 1.26) for a 69.51-ppb increase in ozone; 1.11 (95% CI: 1.00, 1.19) for a 21.51-microg/m(3) increase in particulate matter less than 2.5 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM(2.5)); and 1.10 (95% CI: 1.04, 1.15) for a 37.79-microg/m(3) increase in particulate matter less than 10 mum in aerodynamic diameter (PM(10)). There was no significant effect modification by age, sex, or season. The authors conclude that air pollution appears to increase the risk of headache in Santiago Province. If the relation is causal, the morbidity associated with headache should be considered when estimating the burden of illness and costs associated with poor air quality.",M2
19640961,"Effect of growth on cardiometabolic status at 4 y of age.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks are increasingly being diagnosed in children and track into adulthood. Growth is associated with CVD risk in adulthood; however, its contribution to CVD risks in children facing the obesity epidemic is unclear. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess relations between growth from age 0 to 4 y and CVD status at 4 y in 323 Chilean children with normal birth weight. DESIGN: From health records we obtained weight and height every 6 mo from age 0 to 3 y and calculated body mass index (BMI; weight/height(2)). At age 4 y, we measured height, waist circumference, insulin, glucose, and plasma lipids; infant feeding information was provided by the mothers. Outcomes were metabolic score (waist-to-height ratio + glucose + insulin + triglycerides - HDL-cholesterol z scores/5), total cholesterol (TC):HDL cholesterol, and homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance. RESULTS: At 4 y, the prevalence of obesity was 13%. Changes in BMI, particularly from 6 to 24 mo, predicted a higher metabolic score (standardized regression coefficient = 0.29; 95% <e>CI</e>: 0.16, 0.42) but were unrelated to homeostasis model of assessment of insulin resistance and TC:HDL cholesterol. Height changes were not associated with CVD risks at the age of 4 y. Mode of infant feeding was unrelated to CVD status at 4 y; however, in children who were exclusively breastfed at 4 mo, an increase in BMI from 0 to 6 mo was positively associated with TC:HDL cholesterol at 4 y (standardized regression coefficient = 0.24; 95% CI: -0.02, 0.50), whereas in children who were partially or nonbreastfed at 4 mo, it was negatively associated with TC:HDL cholesterol at 4 y (standardized regression coefficient = -0.30; 95% CI: -0.52, -0.08). CONCLUSION: In children with normal birth weight and a high prevalence of obesity at 4 y, changes in BMI after 6 mo predicted a higher overall CVD risk at 4 y.",M2

However, general use of the technique is hampered by its complexity and the lack of standardization. METHODOLOGY: We here present the development and phase I evaluation of the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT, a simple and standardized dipstick format for detection of PCR amplified T. cruzi DNA. The specificity and sensitivity of the assay were evaluated on blood samples from 60 Chagas non-endemic and 48 endemic control persons and on biological samples from 33 patients, 7 reservoir animals, and 14 vectors collected in Chile. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The lower detection limits of the T. cruzi OligoC-TesT were 1 pg and 1 to 10 fg of DNA from T. cruzi lineage I and II, respectively. The test showed a specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>]: 96.6%-100%) on the control samples and a sensitivity of 93.9% (95% CI: 80.4%-98.3%), 100% (95% CI: 64.6%-100%), and 100% (95% CI: 78.5%-100%) on the human, rodent, and vector samples, respectively.

Using factor analysis, a group of elements consistent with a mobile combustion source (carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, elemental and organic carbon) was significantly associated with total mortality (RR 1.11; 95% CI = 1.083-1.138). Soil-sourced particles had a weaker but statistically significant mortality effect. Of the many sources of particulate air pollution, those from motor vehicle exhaust had the greatest observed effect on mortality.",M2
19423240,"The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) as a screening instrument for adolescents.BACKGROUND: The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT) is an international screening instrument extensively employed in adult target groups. However, there is scarce information on screening with the AUDIT in adolescent populations. The purpose of this study was to determine the cut-off point for hazardous, harmful, and dependent alcohol use through the validation of the AUDIT in a Chilean adolescent sample. METHODS: The original English version of the AUDIT was translated into Spanish, using the procedure recommended by the World Health Organization. The text was then back-translated and sent to one of the original authors (Thomas Babor), who approved the translation. Students attending public schools in Santiago, Chile, self-administered the AUDIT, and those older than 15 years completed the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Substance Abuse Module (CIDI-SAM), which served as a gold standard. Between 1 and 4 weeks after the CIDI-SAM, participants answered a second AUDIT. RESULTS: A total of 42 female and 53 male adolescents (mean age: 15.9 [SD=1.2]) completed the AUDIT, with a mean score of 4.3. Reliability according to Cronbach's alpha was 0.83. Test-retest correlation was also satisfactory (intra-class correlation 0.81 [95% <e>CI</e> 0.73-0.87]). Analysis of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve yielded cut-off points for hazardous, harmful, and dependent alcohol use of 3, 5, and 7 points, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The Chilean version of the AUDIT is a valid and reliable tool for identifying adolescents with hazardous, harmful, and dependent alcohol use. The suggested cut-off points make screening with the AUDIT more accurate for adolescent populations.",M2
19399325,"[Discordance between nutritional status and self perception of weight among adults from Talca, Chile]BACKGROUND: Obesity is related to underestimation of one's own weight. AIM: To determine the agreement between nutritional status and self perception of weight status in apparently healthy adults from Talca. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Data were obtained from a survey applied at 1007 randomly selected subjects, aged 18-74 years old (66% women). The survey identified age, gender, educational level and socioeconomic status. Self-perception of weight was estimated with pictures representing the four nutritional status categories: underweight, normal, overweight and obese. Body Mass index (BMI, kg/m(2)) was calculated to determine nutritional status. Statistical analysis included kappa index, Bowman s symmetry test and a logistic regression model to calculate the odds ratio in different variables related to underestimation of weight. RESULTS: Seventy three percent of subjects were overweight or obese and 44% underestimated their nutritional status. Sixty percent of subjects with a BMI between 25 and 26 kg/m(2), perceived themselves as normal. A higher underestimation was observed in obese subjects (odds ratio (OR) 17.2 95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>) 10.9-27.1), in overweight individuals (OR 3.5 95% CI 2.3-5.3), in men (OR 1.5 95% CI 1.1-2.1) and in people aged from 45 to 59 years (OR 1.7 95% CI 1.0-2.7). Conclusion: Almost half of studied population had an erroneous self-perception of weight, mainly due to underestimation. Obese subjects, males and people older than 45 years were those with the higher degree of underestimation.",M2
19370783,"Incidence and survival of stomach cancer in a high-risk population of Chile.AIM: To study the incidence and survival rate of stomach cancer (SC) and its associated factors in a high risk population in Chile. METHODS: The population-based cancer registry of Valdivia, included in the International Agency for Research on Cancer system, covers 356 396 residents of Valdivia Province, Southern Chile. We studied all SC cases entered in this Registry during 1998-2002 (529 cases). Population data came from the Chilean census (2002). Standardized incidence rates per 100 000 inhabitants (SIR) using the world population, cumulative risk of developing cancer before age 75, and rate ratios by sex, age, ethnicity and social factors were estimated. Relative survival (Ederer II method) and age-standardized estimates (Brenner method) were calculated. Specific survival rates (Kaplan-Meier) were measured at 3 and 5 years and survival curves were analyzed with the Logrank and Breslow tests. Survival was studied in relation to demographics, clinical presentation, laboratory results and medical management of the cases. Those variables significantly associated with survival were later included in a Cox multivariate model. RESULTS: Between 1998 and 2002, 529 primary gastric cancers occurred in Valdivia (crude incidence rate 29.2 per 100 000 inhabitants). Most cases were male (69.0%), residents of urban areas (57.5%) and Hispanic (83.2%), with a low education level (84.5% &lt; 8 school years). SC SIR was higher in men than women (40.8 and 14.8 respectively, P &lt; 0.001), risk factors were low education RR 4.4 (95% <e>CI</e>: 2.9-6.8) and 1.6, (95% CI: 1.1-2.1) for women and men respectively and Mapuche ethnicity only significant for women (RR 2.2, 95% CI: 1.2-3.7). Of all cases, 76.4% were histologically confirmed, 11.5% had a death certificate only (DCO), 56.1% were TNM stage IV; 445 cases (84.1%) were eligible for survival analysis, all completed five years follow-up; 42 remained alive, 392 died of SC and 11 died from other causes. Specific 5-year survival, excluding cases with DCO, was 10.6% (95% CI: 7.7-13.5); 5-year relative survival rate was 12.3% (95% CI: 9.1-16.1), men 10.9% (95% CI: 7.4-15.2) and women 16.1% (95% CI: 9.5-24.5). Five-year specific survival was higher for patients aged &lt; 55 years (17.3%), with intestinal type of cancer (14.6%), without metastasis (22.2%), tumor size &lt; 4 cm (60.0%), without lymphatic invasion (77.1%), only involvement of the mucous membrane (100%). Statistically significant independent prognostic factors were: TNM staging, diffuse type, metastasis, supraclavicular adenopathy, palpable tumor, and hepatitis or ascites. CONCLUSION: Social determinants are the main risk factors for SC, but not for survival. An advanced clinical stage at consultation is the main cause of poor SC survival.",M2
19301771,"[Nutritional status and lifestyles of workers from two regions in Chile]BACKGROUND: Lifestyles and a poor nutritional status are two factors influencing the high prevalence of non communicable chronic diseases among Chilean workers. AIM: To characterize lifestyles and nutritional status of workers from the public and private sector, residing in the Fifth and in the Metopolitan regions of Chile. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nutritional status, blood pressure, cholesterol, glyeemia, previous medical history, feeding habits and smoking status were assessed in 1036 women and 709 men aged 38 +/- 11 years. RESULTS: Feeding habits were characterized by a low consumption of fruits, vegetables, fish and dairy products and a high consumption of fat and sugar. Forty five percent smoked and 88% were sedentary. Forty two percent were overweight, 18% were obese, 39% had high blood cholesterol, 23% hypertension and 4% diabetes. There was a positive relationship between obesity and hypertension with an odds ratio (OR) adjusted for sex and educational levels of 2.6 (95% confidence intervals (CT) 1.9-3.7) and diabetes with an OR of 2.8 (95% <e>CI</e> 1.6-4.7). Eighty two percent of obese and 28% of overweight subjects underestimated their nutritional status. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of overweight and inadequate lifestyles was found in this population. There was a low self perception of obesity and lack of knowledge about risk factors for chronic diseases.",M2
19204433,"Factor XII 46C --&gt; T gene polymorphism in Chilean subjects with coronary artery disease and controls.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the possible association between factor XII (F12) gene variant and the presence of coronary artery disease (CAD) in Chilean subjects. METHODS: A total of 112 unrelated patients with a diagnosis of CAD confirmed by angiography (33-74 years old) and 107 healthy controls (30-68 years old) were included in this study. PCR-RFLP was used to evaluate the 46C --&gt; T polymorphism of the F12 gene. RESULTS: The genotype distribution for the 46C --&gt; T variant of the F12 gene in CAD patients (CC: 41%, CT: 39%, TT: 20%) and controls (CC: 38%, CT: 48%, TT: 14%) was comparable (p = 0.365). Similarly, the allelic frequency was equivalent (p = 0.833). The odds ratio for CAD associated with the mutated 46T allele was 1.06 (95% <e>CI</e> = 0.72-1.56) confirming the absence of an association. CONCLUSION: This study showed that the F12 46C --&gt; T gene polymorphism is not related to CAD in the studied population. However, this study is limited by its sample size and the use of controls not matched by age and sex.",M2
19129997,"Association between p53 codon 72 genetic polymorphism and tobacco use and lung cancer risk.Lung cancer (LCa) is the leading cause of death by cancer in men. Genetic and environmental factors play a synergistic role in its etiology. We explore in 111 lung cancer cases and 133 unrelated noncancer controls the gene-environment interaction (G x E) between p53cd72 polymorphism variants and smoking and the effect on LCa risk in two kinds of case-control designs. We assessed the interaction odds ratio (IOR) using an adjusted unconditional logistic model. We found a significant and positive interaction association between Pro* allele carriers and smoking habits in both case-control and case-only designs: IOR = 3.90 (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>] = 1.10-13.81) and 3.05 (95% CI = 1.63-5.72), respectively. These exploratory results suggest a synergistic effect of the smoking habit and the susceptibility of the Pro allele on lung cancer risk compared with each risk factor alone.",M2
19110888,"Prevalence of sleep related symptoms in four Latin American cities.STUDY OBJECTIVES: to estimate the prevalence of the most common sleep related symptoms (SRS) in the metropolitan areas of Mexico City, Montevideo (Uruguay), Santiago (Chile), and Caracas (Venezuela). METHODS: The study consisted of a multistage cluster sampling of adults aged &gt; or = 40 years living in metropolitan areas. All participants completed a questionnaire on sleep related symptoms. Simplified respiratory polygraphy during sleep was conducted on 188 subjects from Mexico City. Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome was defined as Epworth Sleepiness Scale score &gt; or = 11 and respiratory disturbance index (RDI) &gt; or = 15 events/h; a cut-off of 15 was chosen because of its high sensitivity and specificity in association with the portable monitor used in the study. RESULTS: The study included 4,533 subjects (1,062 in Mexico City, 941 in Montevideo, 1,173 in Santiago, and 1,357 in Caracas). Snoring was reported by 60.2% (95% <e>CI</e> 58.8% to 61.6%), excessive daytime sleepiness by 16.4% (15.3% to 17.5%), observed apneas by 12.3% (11.4% to 13.3%), insomnia by 34.7% (33.3% to 36%), sedative use by 15.1% (14.1% to 16.2%), daytime napping by 29.2% (27.7% to 30.6%), and a combination of snoring, sleepiness, and observed apneas by 3.4% (2.9% to 4%). Men had a higher frequency of snoring and daytime napping, whereas women reported more insomnia and sedative use. Prevalence of OSAS varied from 2.9% among subjects who denied snoring, excessive daytime sleepiness, and observed apneas, to 23.5% among those reporting these 3 symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of sleep related symptoms and undiagnosed obstructive sleep apnea in Latin America was observed.",M2
19095703,"Modelling the non-linear multiple-lag effects of ambient temperature on mortality in Santiago and Palermo: a constrained segmented distributed lag approach.OBJECTIVES: Exposure to ambient temperature can affect mortality levels for days or weeks following exposure, making modelling such effects in regression analysis of daily time-series data complex. METHODS: We propose a new approach involving a multi-lag segmented approximation to account for the non-linear effect of temperature and the use of two different penalized spline bases to model the distributed lag of both heat and cold exposure. Compared with standard splines, the novel penalized framework is more flexible at short lags where change in coefficients is greatest, and selection of the maximum lag appears substantially less important in determining the overall pattern of the effect. RESULTS: Applying the approach to daily mortality in Santiago (Chile) and Palermo (Italy), we observed a heat effect that was mostly immediate and followed by negative estimates consistent with short-term mortality displacement (harvesting). Cold effects were mostly positively sustained and more evenly distributed across the 60-day analysis period: in Santiago we estimated an overall increase in deaths of 2.36% (95% <e>CI</e> 0.26% to 4.51%) in the 65+ age group associated with every 1 degrees C decrease below the cold threshold, and an increase of 1.11% (0.09% to 2.14%) per 1 degrees C for Palermo. Heat effects for Palermo were much larger than for Santiago, and less harvesting of heat deaths was evident. The estimated heat thresholds were higher in Palermo than in Santiago. CONCLUSIONS: Our approach provides a flexible and precise method to quantify health effects of both heat and cold exposure at individual lags and to model the overall pattern of the delayed effect.",M2
19008679,"Nutritional status and obesity in children and young adults with disabilities in Punta Arenas, Patagonia, Chile.Childhood obesity is reaching epidemic proportions throughout the world; however, little is known on the nutritional status of children with disabilities. To address this issue, medical records of 748 children aged 18 years or younger receiving physical therapy during 2004-2005 at a privately sponsored free rehabilitation clinic in Punta Arenas, Patagonia, Chile were abstracted. Data included demographic, clinical, and anthropometric information recorded at the first visit. As a comparison, height and weight were also collected in 215 children attending local schools. Nutritional status was calculated as body mass index (above 6 years of age) or evaluated by growth curves (6 years of age or below) as undernourished, normal, overweight, obese, or morbidly obese. Logistic regression was used to determine risk factors for obesity in these children. Overall, a significant difference in nutritional status between disabled and non-disabled children was found (P&lt;0.001). Children with disabilities had a higher prevalence of both below and above normal weight than non-disabled children. Risk factors for obesity included increasing age and living with a grandparent independent of other socioeconomic factors. Compared with normal children, risk of obesity was doubled for those with developmental delays [odds ratio (OR): 1.96; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 1.16-3.34] and neurological disorders (OR: 2.58, 95% CI: 1.26-5.29), whereas individuals with cerebral palsy were less than half as likely to be obese than non-disabled children (OR: 0.46, 95% CI: 0.20-1.03). We conclude that overnutrition continues to be a problem for both disabled and non-disabled children in Patagonia. Programs to increase physical activity and improve nutrition are needed in this isolated part of the world.",M2
18949178,"[Characteristics and factors associated with mortality in patients receiving mechanical ventilation: first Chilean multicenter study]BACKGROUND: The outcome of mechanically ventilated patients can be influenced by factors such as the indication of mechanical ventilation (MV) and ventilator parameters. AIM: To describe the characteristics of patients receiving MV in Chilean critical care units. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Prospective cohort of consecutive adult patients admitted to 19 intensive care units (ICU) from 9 Chilean cities who received MV for more than 12 hours between September lst, 2003, and September 28th, 2003. Demographic data, severity of illness, reason for the initiation of MV, ventilation modes and settings as well as weaning strategies were registered at the initiation and then, daily throughout the course of MV for up to 28 days. ICU and hospital mortality were recorded. RESULTS: Of 588 patients admitted, 156 (26.5%) received MV (57% males). Mean age and Simplified Acute Physiology Score-II (SAPS II) were 54.6+/-18 years and 40.6+/-16.4 points respectively The most common indications for MV were acute respiratory failure (71.1%) and coma (22.4%). Assist-control mode (71.6%) and synchronized intermittent mandatory ventilation (SIMV) (14,2%) were the most frequently used. T-tube was the main weaning strategy. Mean duration of MV and length of stay in ICU were 7.8+/-8.7 and 11.1+/- 14 days respectively. Overall ICU mortality was 33.9% (53 patients). The main factors independently associated with increased mortality were (1) SAPS II &gt; or =60 points (Odds Ratio (OR), 10.5; 95% <e>CI</e>, 1.04-106.85) and (2) plateau pressure &gt; or =30 cm H2O at second day (OR, 3.9; 95% CI, 1.17-12.97). CONCLUSIONS: Conditions present at the onset of MV and ventilator management were similar to those reported in the literature. Magnitude of multiorgan dysfunction and high plateau pressures are the most important factors associated with mortality.",M2
18833418,"Prevalence and correlates of physical fighting among school-going adolescents in Santiago, Chile.OBJECTIVE: There is a growing interest in injury as a public health issue across the world. There is paucity of data on the prevalence and social correlates of non-fatal interpersonal violence in low- and middle-income income nations. The objective of this study was to estimate the prevalence of, and associated factors for physical fighting among school-going adolescents in Santiago, Chile. METHOD: We conducted a secondary analysis of the Chilean Global School-Based Health Survey conducted in 2004 in Santiago. We aimed to assess the prevalence and social correlates of having been involved in a physical fight in the prior 12 months. RESULTS: Of the 2111 respondents, 40.7% (54.3% males and 26.6% females) reported having been in a physical fight in the prior 12 months. Males were more likely to have been in a physical fight than females [OR = 3.89, 95% <e>CI</e> (3.11, 4.85)]. Substance use (cigarette smoking, drinking alcohol, and using drugs) and bullying victimization were positively associated with fighting [OR = 3.05, 95% CI (2.40, 3.87) for substance use, and OR = 1.65, 95% CI (1.32, 2.05) for bullying]. Parental supervision was negatively associated with physical fighting [OR = 0.62, 95% CI (0.50, 0.78)]. CONCLUSION: We have estimated the prevalence of having engaged in a physical fight among in-school adolescents in Santiago, Chile. We have found that the prevalence is similar to what has been reported in diverse settings in Africa, Europe and North America.",M2
18769831,"[Body distribution and density of acquired melanocytic nevi in adolescents of low socioeconomic status of Santiago, Chile]BACKGROUND: There is an increase in the incidence of malignant melanoma in Chile. Previous studies have shown that the density and size of acquired melanocytic nevi (AMN) are a risk factor for developing malignant melanoma. AIM: To assess the number and anatomical distribution of acquired melanocytic nevi in Chilean adolescents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The number of AMN was counted in 30 anatomical sites in 201 Chilean school children (111 females), aged from 11 to 15 years. The number of small AMN (2-4.9 mm) and large AMN (&gt;5 mm of diameter) was determined. RESULTS: Mean AMN number per person was 32.7 (95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 30.7-42.3) in males and 29 (95% CI 271-38.6) in females (p =NS). Males had a higher number of AMN in the face, neck and trunk. Females had a higher number of AMN in the upper and lower limbs. Older children, adolescents with history of sunburns and with lighter skin had a higher number of total, small and large nevi. CONCLUSIONS: The average number of AMN found in this study is similar to that reported in the literature. The differences in site distribution between males and females may be explained by a different sun exposure pattern.",M2
18728531,"Secular and seasonal trends in obesity in Chilean preschool children, 1996-2004.OBJECTIVES: Chile is a unique example of the nutrition transition, with improvements in undernutrition and subsequent rapid increases in obesity occurring at a rate much faster than in other countries. This study aims to describe the cross-sectional obesity trends in Chilean preschool children from 1996 to 2004. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Anthropometric measurements from preschool children (ages 2-5) registered in the Junta Nacional de Jardines Infantiles program from 1996 to 2004 were analysed. The weight-for-height z score using the World Health Organization 1977/1985 reference curves for age, sex, height, and weight were defined to estimate overweight and obesity. The overall trends in obesity were described for each study year and generalized estimating equation models were used to describe trends in obesity after adjusting for the correlated nature of repeated measurements in individual children in consecutive years. RESULTS: The prevalence of obese and overweight children has remained constant in both boys and girls during the past 9 years; however, after adjustment for repeated measurements in individual children, the odds of obesity increased by 30% each year (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>] 1.27-1.31, P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, the odds of obesity were significantly greater in both August and November compared with March. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of obesity in Chilean preschool children continues to be a major public health concern, and cross-sectional trends may underestimate the magnitude of the problem.",M2
18722363,"Association between CAPN10 UCSNP-43 gene polymorphism and polycystic ovary syndrome in Chilean women.BACKGROUND: Studies have suggested that the Calpain-10 gene polymorphisms may play a role in polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) susceptibility. Thus, the aim of the present study was to evaluate the possible association between three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the calpain-10 gene (UCSNPs -43, -19, and -63) and polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) in Chilean women. METHODS: Fifty women with PCOS (28.8+/-8.2 y) and 70 healthy women (28.6+/-8.6 y) were included in this study. Serum lipids, hormonal status, fasting glucose, oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), insulin, HOMAIR, and uric acid levels were determined by conventional methods. The calpain-10 gene variants were detected by PCR and PCR-RFLP, respectively. RESULTS: The presence of uncommon allele (A) for the UCSNP-43 was associated with increased risk of PCOS (odds ratio=1.93, 95% <e>CI</e>: 1.11-3.34). The UCSNP-63 (OR=1.11, 95% CI: 0.59-2.11) and UCSNP-19 (OR=0.93, 95% CI: 0.55-1.57) were not associated to PCOS. However, the PCOS women carrying the CC genotype for UCSNP-63 exhibited higher values of total cholesterol and LDL-C (P&lt;0.05). Similarly, control women carrying the CC genotype showed higher serum levels of triglycerides, HDL-C and uric acid (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Our data suggest the contribution of CAPN10 UCSNP-43 gene polymorphism to PCOS in Chilean women. However, further studies with larger samples are necessary to confirm this observation.",M2
18709898,"National food-fortification program with folic acid in Chile.The Chilean Ministry of Health legislated to add folic acid (2.2 mg/100 g) to wheat flour to reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTD), beginning in January 2000. This policy resulted in a significant increase in serum and red blood cell folate in women of childbearing age 1 year after fortification. The frequency of NTD was studied in all births, both live and stillbirths, in a prospective hospital-based design including 25% of national births during 1999-2000 (prefortification period) and 2001-2002 (postfortification period). During the prefortification period, there was a total of 120,566 newborns, and the NTD rate was 17.1/10,000 births. During the postfortification period (2001-2002) there was a total of 117,704 newborns, and the NTD rate was significantly reduced by 43% to 9.7/10,000 births (RR = 0.57; 95% <e>CI</e>, 0.45 to 0.71). This implies a reduction of 43% in the rate of NTD. The costs per NTD case and infant death averted were 1,200 international dollars (I$) and I$11,000, respectively. The cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted was I$91, or 0.8% of the country's per capita GDP. On the overall, fortification resulted in net cost savings of I$1.8 million. Fortification of wheat flour with folic acid has proven to be an effective and cost saving strategy for the primary prevention of NTD in a middle-income country in a postepidemiological transition, and in a dramatically short period of time.",M2
18708388,"Increased childhood liver cancer mortality and arsenic in drinking water in northern Chile.Arsenic in drinking water is an established cause of lung, bladder, and skin cancers in adults and may also cause adult kidney and liver cancers. Some evidence for these effects originated from region II of Chile, which had a period of elevated arsenic levels in drinking water, in particular from 1958 to 1970. This unique exposure scenario provides a rare opportunity to investigate the effects of early-life arsenic exposure on childhood mortality; to our knowledge, this is the first study of childhood cancer mortality and high concentrations of arsenic in drinking water. In this article, we compare cancer mortality rates under the age of 20 in region II during 1950 to 2000 with those of unexposed region V, dividing subjects into those born before, during, or after the peak exposure period. Mortality from the most common childhood cancers, leukemia and brain cancer, was not increased in the exposed population. However, we found that childhood liver cancer mortality occurred at higher rates than expected. For those exposed as young children, liver cancer mortality between ages 0 and 19 was especially high: the relative risk (RR) for males born during this period was 8.9 [95% confidence interval (95% <e>CI</e>), 1.7-45.8; P = 0.009]; for females, the corresponding RR was 14.1 (95% CI, 1.6-126; P = 0.018); and for males and females pooled, the RR was 10.6 (95% CI, 2.9-39.2; P &lt; 0.001). These findings suggest that exposure to arsenic in drinking water during early childhood may result in an increase in childhood liver cancer mortality.",M2
18701728,"Social capital and self-rated health in urban low income neighbourhoods in Chile.OBJECTIVE: To examine the potential association between social capital and self-rated health within a low income community of Santiago, Chile. METHOD: Cross-sectional survey, based on in-home interviews in the municipality of Puente Alto in Santiago, Chile. The participants were 781 residents of four neighbourhoods within Puente Alto (mean age 45.5 years). RESULTS: Principal components analysis with varimax rotation identified five domains of social capital: perceived trust in neighbours, perceived trust in organisations, reciprocity within the neighbourhood, neighbourhood integration, and social participation (Cronbach alphas: 0.58 to 0.77). Trust and reciprocity were significantly associated with better self-rated health. For example, a one standard deviation increase in trust in neighbours was associated with an adjusted odds ratio of 1.10 (95% confidence interval, <e>CI</e>: 1.05 to 1.15) for reporting good self-rated health. By contrast, social participation was associated with a lower odds (0.89, 95% CI: 0.89 to 1.06) of reporting good health. CONCLUSION: Neighbourhood social cohesion, measured by trust and reciprocity, is associated with higher self-rated health. However, social participation did not appear to be associated with better health in this predominantly low income neighbourhood. These findings provide preliminary support to the relevance for social capital as a determinant of health in Chile.",M2
18647235,"Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and its association with obesity, insulin resistance and increased serum levels of C-reactive protein in Hispanics.BACKGROUND: Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is a metabolic disorder of the liver, which may progress to fibrosis or cirrhosis. Recent studies have shown a significant impact of ethnicity on susceptibility to steatosis-related liver disease. AIMS: To estimate the prevalence of NAFLD among Chilean Hispanics as well as the clinical and biochemical variables associated with the disease. METHODS: Population-based study among Chilean Hispanics. The diagnosis of NAFLD was made on the basis of ultrasound evidence of fatty liver and absence of significant alcohol consumption and hepatitis C virus infection. RESULTS: A total of 832 Hispanic subjects were included. Ultrasound findings revealed diffuse fatty liver in 23% of the subjects. Variables associated with fatty liver in multivariate analysis were body mass index &gt;26.9 [odds ratio (OR) 6.2; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 3.3-11.5], abnormal aspartate aminotransferase levels (OR 14; 95% CI 8.2-23.7), presence of insulin resistance as measured by homoeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (OR 3; 95% CI 1.8-4.8) and serum levels of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) greater than 0.86 mg/L (OR 2.9; 95% CI 1.6-5.2). Among subjects with NAFLD, levels of hs-CRP were similar regardless of the alanine aminotransferase (ALT) level. CONCLUSIONS: Chilean Hispanics exhibit a high prevalence of NAFLD. Obesity, insulin resistance, abnormal aminotransferase levels and elevated hs-CRP were independently associated with the presence of NAFLD. ALT elevation underestimates the presence of ultrasonographical fatty liver, whereas hs-CRP is a sensitive independent marker of NAFLD, which may be useful for detecting fatty liver in the general population.",M2

OBJECTIVE: To assess the level of associations and AF between sensitization to five allergens and atopic conditions in two settings. METHODS: We studied 2063 Brazilians and 1231 Chileans of both sexes using representative samples selected at birth in the 1970s. Information on asthma and rhinitis was based on the European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire. We assessed bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine and sensitization to Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus, cat, dog, grass blend and Alternaria alternata. RESULTS: The prevalence of sensitization to one or more allergens was 50% in Brazilians and 22% in Chileans. The level of associations varied according to the outcome used. Strong associations between sensitization and asthma, defined as wheeze or awakening with breathlessness at night and positive BHR, were found for each of the five allergens in Chileans [varying from odds ratio (OR) 3.24, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 1.47, 7.15 for D. pteronyssinus to 8.44, 95% CI 3.82, 18.66 for cat], whereas the level of associations was restricted to D. pteronyssinus, cat and dog in Brazilians and was somewhat weaker (highest OR 3.90, 95% CI 2.80-5.44). The AF of sensitization on asthma was 54% in Brazil and 44% in Chile. D. pteronyssinus and cat made an independent contribution to asthma in the two samples. The patterns of associations between sensitization and rhino-conjunctivitis were similar to those for asthma. CONCLUSION: The associations between sensitization, and asthma and rhinitis were high in Chile and moderately high in Brazil, but the AF were higher in Brazil, reflecting a higher prevalence of sensitization. In Brazil, dust mite had the greatest impact on atopic conditions while in Chile several allergens had an impact. Sensitization is as serious a problem in Chile and Brazil as in developed countries.",M2
18626431,"Influence of extrahepatic viral infection on the natural history of hepatitis C.HCV is primarily hepatotropic, but there is mounting evidence pointing to infection and replication of extrahepatic sites. Here we evaluated the occurrence of HCV infection of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and explored the possible association between viral extrahepatic infection and the natural history of the disease. Forty seven Chilean, HCV infected, treatment naïve patients were included in the study. HCV RNA was isolated from plasma and PBMC and subsequently reverse transcribed, amplified and sequenced. Most patients harbored HCV 1b genotype and the most common route of infection showed to be blood transfusion. HCV RNA was readily detected in PBMCs of 34 out of the 47 patients (72%). We report that HCV sequences found in PBMC differ from those in plasma of the same subjects strongly suggesting HCV compartmentalization. In addition, we found that patients with detectable HCV RNA in PBMC had a tendency for being more likely cirrhotic [OR 3.8 (95% <e>CI</e>: 0.98 to 14)]. In conclusion, this study provides further arguments for the existence of HCV infection of extrahepatic sites and suggests that extrahepatic infection could be a factor influencing the natural history of the disease.",M2
18566990,"Geographic variation of gallbladder cancer mortality and risk factors in Chile: a population-based ecologic study.Chile's gallbladder cancer rates are among the highest in the world, being the leading cause of cancer deaths among Chilean women. To provide insights into the etiology of gallbladder cancer, we conducted an ecologic study examining the geographical variation of gallbladder cancer and several putative risk factors. The relative risk of dying from gallbladder cancer between 1985 and 2003 was estimated for each of the 333 Chilean counties, using a hierarchical Poisson regression model, adjusting for age, sex and geographical location. The risk of gallbladder cancer mortality was analyzed in relation to region, poverty, Amerindian (Mapuche) population, typhoid fever and access to cholecystectomy, using logistic regression analysis. There were 27,183 gallbladder cancer deaths, with age and sex-adjusted county mortality rates ranging from 8.2 to 12.4 per 100,000 inhabitants. Rates were highest in inland and southern regions. Compared to the northern-coast, the northern-inland region had a 10-fold risk (95% of confidence interval (95% <e>CI</e>): 2.4-42.2) and the southern-inland region had a 26-fold risk (95% CI: 6.0-114.2). Independent of region, other risk factors for gallbladder cancer included a high Mapuche population (Odds ratio (OR):3.9, 95% CI 1.8-8.7), high typhoid fever incidence (OR:2.9, 95% CI 1.2-6.9), high poverty (OR:5.1, 95% CI 1.6-15.9), low access to cholecystectomy (OR:3.9, 95% CI 1.5-10.1), low access to hospital care (OR:14.2, 95% CI 4.2-48.7) and high urbanization (OR:8.0, 95% CI 3.4-18.7). Our results suggest that gallbladder cancer in Chile may be related to both genetic factors and poor living conditions. Future analytic studies are needed to further clarify the role of these factors in gallbladder cancer etiology.",M2
18534887,"A comparative study of two different methods for the detection of latent tuberculosis in HIV-positive individuals in Chile.OBJECTIVE: To compare the performance of two tests for diagnosing latent tuberculosis (TB) infection in the HIV-positive population in Chile, in order to better identify the subjects who might benefit from TB chemoprophylaxis. DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study among individuals attending three HIV outpatient clinics in Santiago, tested with a 2-TU purified protein derivative, QuantiFERON((R))-TB Gold 'in-tube' (QFT-G), and a chest X-ray. RESULTS: A total of 116 subjects were enrolled in the study, having a mean CD4 count of 393cells/microl (range 100-977). The tuberculin skin text (TST; 5mm cutoff) and QFT-G results were positive in 10.9% and 14.8% of the individuals, respectively, with moderate agreement between both tests (kappa=0.59). A history of both known TB exposure (odds ratio (OR) 3.46, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 1.02-11.22) and past TB (OR 4.31, 95% CI 1.13-15.5) were associated with a positive QFT-G result. Only past TB was significantly associated with a positive TST result (OR 6.63, 95% CI 1.62-26.3). Among the subjects with TST&lt;5mm, 8.2% were positive by QFT-G test. These individuals had a lower mean CD4 cell count than those detected positive by both tests (328cells/microl and 560cells/microl, respectively, p=0.03). CONCLUSIONS: In this population of HIV-infected individuals, QFT-G and TST showed an acceptable level of agreement, although QFT-G appears less affected by more advanced immunosuppression.",M2
18511489,"Vulnerability to heat-related mortality in Latin America: a case-crossover study in Sao Paulo, Brazil, Santiago, Chile and Mexico City, Mexico.BACKGROUND: Factors affecting vulnerability to heat-related mortality are not well understood. Identifying susceptible populations is of particular importance given anticipated rising temperatures from climatic change. METHODS: We investigated heat-related mortality for three Latin American cities (Mexico City, Mexico; São Paulo, Brazil; Santiago, Chile) using a case-crossover approach for 754 291 deaths from 1998 to 2002. We considered lagged exposures, confounding by air pollution, cause of death and susceptibilities by educational attainment, age and sex. RESULTS: Same and previous day apparent temperature were most strongly associated with mortality risk. Effect estimates remained positive though lowered after adjustment for ozone or PM(10). Susceptibility increased with age in all cities. The increase in mortality risk for those &gt;or=65 comparing the 95th and 75th percentiles of same-day apparent temperature was 2.69% (95% <e>CI</e>: -2.06 to 7.88%) for Santiago, 6.51% (95% CI: 3.57-9.52%) for São Paulo and 3.22% (95% CI: 0.93-5.57%) for Mexico City. Patterns of vulnerability by education and sex differed across communities. Effect estimates were higher for women than men in Mexico City, and higher for men elsewhere, although results by sex were not appreciably different for any city. In São Paulo, those with less education were more susceptible, whereas no distinct patterns by education were observed in the other cities. CONCLUSIONS: Elevated temperatures are associated with mortality risk in these Latin American cities, with the strongest associations in São Paulo, the hottest city. The elderly are an important population for targeted prevention measures, but vulnerability by sex and education differed by city.",M2
18482808,"Maternal, perinatal and infant outcome of spontaneous pregnancy in the sixth decade of life.Pregnancy in the older woman is a well-known risk factor for perinatal morbidity and mortality. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate perinatal and infant morbidity and mortality in women 50 or more years old. METHODS: A retrospective population based study (1990-2004) evaluating spontaneously pregnant Chilean women more than 50 years old (217 live or stillbirths) compared to women 20-34 years old (2,817,742 neonates, control group). The comparison was performed using Chi Square with Yates's correction or exact Fisher test as appropriate. The risk analysis was performed by odds ratio (OR) and confidence interval of 95% (<e>CI</e> 95%). RESULTS: Women over 50 had a significantly greater risk of fetal (OR: 3.7; CI 95%: 1.2-10.5), neonatal (OR: 10.4; CI 95%: 5.7-18.7), post-neonatal (OR: 9.5; CI 95%: 4.6-19.1) and infant death (OR: 10.5; CI 95%: 6.6-16.7). There were no differences between groups in the incidences of low and very low birth weight. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy over 50 years of age entails a very high risk of fetal, neonatal and early childhood death. Unprotected sexual life for these women should be considered only after evaluation of their potential fertility.",M2
18458649,"Predictors of severe sepsis not clinically apparent during the first twenty-four hours of hospitalization in children with cancer, neutropenia, and fever: a prospective, multicenter trial.BACKGROUND: Severe sepsis is not clinically apparent during the first 24 hours of hospitalization in most children with cancer and febrile neutropenia (FN), delaying targeted interventions that could impact mortality. The aim of this study was to prospectively evaluate biomarkers obtained within 24 hours of hospitalization as predictors of severe sepsis before it becomes clinically evident. METHODS: Children with cancer, admitted with FN at high risk for an invasive bacterial infection in 6 public hospitals in Santiago, Chile, were monitored throughout their clinical course for occurrence of severe sepsis. Clinical, demographic and 6 biomarkers [eg, blood urea nitrogen, serum glucose, lactic dehydrogenase, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), interleukin (IL)-8, and procalcitonin] were obtained at the time of admission and after 24 hours. Biomarkers independently associated with severe sepsis diagnosed after the first 24 hours of hospitalization were identified by logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: A total of 601 high risk FN episodes were enrolled between June 2004 and October 2006; 151 (25%) developed severe sepsis of which 116 (77%) were not clinically apparent during the first 24 hours of hospitalization. Risk factors for severe sepsis were age &gt; or =12 years [odds ratio (OR): 3.85; 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 2.41-6.15], admission CRP &gt; or =90 mg/L (OR: 2.03; 95% CI: 1.32-3.14), admission IL-8 &gt; or =200 pg/mL (OR: 2.39; 95% CI: 1.51-3.78), 24-hour CRP &gt; or =100 mg/L (OR: 3.06; 95% CI: 1.94-4.85), and 24-hour IL-8 &gt; or =300 pg/mL (OR: 3.13; 95% CI 1.92-5.08). CONCLUSIONS: Age &gt; or =12 years and admission or 24-hour values of CRP &gt; or =90/100 mg/L and IL-8 &gt; or =200/300 pg/mL are predictors of sepsis not clinically apparent during the first 24 hours of hospitalization.",M2
18433505,"Association of common ATM variants with familial breast cancer in a South American population.BACKGROUND: The ATM gene has been frequently involved in hereditary breast cancer as a low-penetrance susceptibility gene but evidence regarding the role of ATM as a breast cancer susceptibility gene has been contradictory. METHODS: In this study, a full mutation analysis of the ATM gene was carried out in patients from 137 Chilean breast cancer families, of which 126 were BRCA1/2 negatives and 11 BRCA1/2 positives. We further perform a case-control study between the subgroup of 126 cases BRCA1/2 negatives and 200 controls for the 5557G&gt;A missense variant and the IVS38-8T&gt;C and the IVS24-9delT polymorphisms. RESULTS: In the full mutation analysis we detected two missense variants and eight intronic polymorphisms. Carriers of the variant IVS24-9delT, or IVS38-8T&gt;C, or 5557G&gt;A showed an increase in breast cancer risk. The higher significance was observed in the carriers of IVS38-8T&gt;C (OR = 3.09 [95%<e>CI</e> 1.11-8.59], p = 0.024). The IVS24-9 T/(-T), IVS38-8 T/C, 5557 G/A composite genotype confered a 3.19 fold increase in breast cancer risk (OR = 3.19 [95%CI 1.16-8.89], p = 0.021). The haplotype estimation suggested a strong linkage disequilibrium between the three markers (D' = 1). We detected only three haplotypes in the cases and control samples, some of these may be founder haplotypes in the Chilean population. CONCLUSION: The IVS24-9 T/(-T), IVS38-8 T/C, 5557 G/A composite genotype alone or in combination with certain genetic background and/or environmental factors, could modify the cancer risk by increasing genetic instability or by altering the effect of the normal DNA damage response.",M2
18261426,"Risk factors for X-ray pneumonia in the first year of life and its relation to wheezing: a longitudinal study in a socioeconomic disadvantaged population.BACKGROUND: Although thousands of infants under the age of 12 months die each year from pneumonia in Latin America, little is known regarding the true occurrence of pneumonia, wheezing and other related respiratory illnesses in this age group. METHODS AND RESULTS: In order to describe the prevalence and risk factors for radiologically confirmed pneumonia during the first year of life, a birth-cohort (n = 188) of infants born in a low-income area in Santiago, Chile was followed up monthly. RESULTS: The prevalence of pneumonia during the first year of life was 13.3 % and there were no fatal events. Exclusive breastfeeding during the first 4 months of life was more prevalent in the non pneumonia group; conversely, wheezing episodes during 0-3 and 3-6 months of age, and hospitalization due to lower respiratory infection during 3-6 and 9-12 months of age were more prevalent in the pneumonia group. After a logistic multivariate analysis, the only risk factor that remained related with pneumonia was wheezing during the first 3 months of life (adjusted OR: 7.7, 95 <e>CI</e>: 1.32-44.92, p = 0.024); while breastfeeding during the first 4 months was an independent protective factor for pneumonia (adjusted OR: 0.11, 95 CI: 0.03-0.44, p = 0.002). CONCLUSION: The significant protective effect of exclusive breast feeding against pneumonia in this cohort and the evident role of recurrent wheezing as risk factor for pneumonia during the first year of life support the implementation or reinforcement of public policies encouraging exclusive breastfeeding and an adequate management of wheezing since the first months of life.",M2
18259999,"Childhood environment and atopic conditions, with emphasis on asthma in a Chilean agricultural area.BACKGROUND: An explanation of the etiology of atopic conditions based on the hygiene hypothesis remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To analyze exposure variables in childhood to assess their impact on hay fever, asthma, and sensitization. METHODS: Data were collected on 1,232 young Chilean adults born between 1974 and 1978. Information was available on consultations for infections early in life, number of siblings, sharing a bedroom, nursery school attendance, and contact with animals in the first 5 years of life. Information on asthma symptoms and rhinitis were obtained from a standardized questionnaire. Sensitization to eight allergens and bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR) to methacholine were assessed. The study design was non-concurrent longitudinal for infectious episodes and nutritional status in the first year and cross-sectional for the other outcomes. RESULTS: Number of siblings was associated with sensitization only (p = 0.0048). Nursery school attendance was negatively associated with positive BHR (odds ratio (OR) 0.54, 95% <e>CI</e> 0.30-0.95). A severe respiratory infection early in life was protective of sensitization and wheeze combined (OR 0.29, 95%CI 0.12-0.74). Contact with dogs in the first year was a protective factor of rhinitis (OR 0.47, 95%CI 0.28-0.80), but contact with poultry and cats early in life increased the risk of rhinitis (OR 1.42, 95%CI 1.06-1.88; 1.82, 95%CI 1.06-3.14). CONCLUSION: The pattern of associations between environmental exposure in early life and atopic conditions was inconsistent. The significant associations were evenly distributed as protective and risk factors of atopic conditions.",M2
18259647,"[Socioeconomic and educational inequities as independent predictors for mortality in a developing country: A cohort study in San Francisco, Chile]BACKGROUND: The socioeconomic position (SEP) and educational level of individuals have an inverse correlation with mortality in developed societies. AIM: To assess in a society undergoing a socioeconomic transition, the mortality risk associated to a low SEP (combination of education and income, scale 0-25 points, reference &gt; 10 points) and low education (education years, reference &gt; 8 years), adjusting for other known risk factors. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In this prospective cohort study, a random sample of 920 subjects, living in San Francisco de Mostazal, Chile, aged more than 20 years (395 males) was examined for the first time in 1997-1999 and re-examined in 2005-2006. All had information about economic household income and level of education. A Cox regression model was used to evaluate the association between mortality and socioeconomic measures. RESULTS: The crude mortality hazard ratio (HR) was 3.34 (95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 2.88-3.87) and 6.05 (95% CI 5.04-7.26) for low SEP and low educational level, respectively. After adjusting for age, gender, hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidemia, abdominal obesity, smoking, alcohol intake and family history of cardiovascular disease, the figures were 1.23 (95% CI 1.04-1.43) and 1.54 (95% CI 1.23-1.85) for low SEP and low educational level, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: In a society in socioeconomic transition, low SEP and especially low educational level are risk factors for mortality even after adjusting for known mortality risk factors.",M2
18222120,"No association between common Gly972Arg variant of the insulin receptor substrate-1 and polycystic ovary syndrome in Southern Chilean women.BACKGROUND: Previously studies have indicated that the insulin receptor substrate-1 (IRS-1) Gly972Arg (G972R) polymorphism is associated with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). We examined the possible association between G972R common variant of the IRS-1 gene and PCOS in Southern Chilean women with PCOS and controls. METHODS: A total of 50 women with PCOS (29.1+/-8.1 yr) and 75 healthy women (29.3+/-9.3 yr) were included. Serum lipids, glucose and uric acid concentrations were determined by enzymatic-colorimetric methods. The G972R variant of the IRS-1 gene was detected by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: Women with PCOS exhibited a higher concentrations of total testosterone, glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-C and uric acid, and lower HDL-C concentrations than controls (P&lt;0.05). The presence of G972R polymorphism in PCOS and control women was not significantly different (16% vs. 6.6%, P=0.276). The OR for PCOS associated to 972R variant was 2.67 (95% <e>CI</e>: 0.82-8.69, P=NS). Moreover, neither association between G972R genotypes and metabolic parameters were observed in PCOS women or controls. CONCLUSION: Our data do not support an association between G972R variant of the IRS-1 with PCOS or its metabolic parameters in Southern Chilean women.",M2

There is evidence that proinsulin blood levels and the proinsulin/insulin ratio are associated to the MS. The purpose of this study was to compare proinsulin and insulin, insulin resistance index, and the proinsulin/insulin ratio as predictors of MS. This is a cross-sectional study involving 440 men and 556 women with a mean age of 24 years. Diagnosis of MS was made according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III. Blood levels of insulin and proinsulin were measured, and the insulin resistance status was estimated using the homeostatic model assessment (HOMA-IR). The prevalence of MS was 10.1%. HOMA-IR was the best MS risk factor for both women and men (OR = 2.04; 95% <e>CI</e>: 1.68-2.48 and 1.09; 95% CI: 1.05-1.13, respectively). HOMA-IR presented the best positive predictive value for MS: 22% and 36% for men and women, respectively, and was the best MS indicator. The proinsulin/insulin ratio did not show significant association with MS. HOMA-IR, proinsulin, and insulin presented good negative predictive values for both genders that could be used to identify an at-risk population.",M2
18085687,"Transfer of complex frontline anticancer therapy to a developing country: the St. Jude osteosarcoma experience in Chile.BACKGROUND: A frontline protocol for newly diagnosed osteosarcoma was conducted simultaneously at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (sponsor) and Calvo Mackenna Hospital (CMH, partner), a public pediatric hospital and national center for the treatment of bone tumors in Santiago, Chile. PROCEDURE: Of 72 eligible patients, 22 (31%) were enrolled and managed in Santiago, without travel to Memphis. Pathology specimens and imaging material were centrally reviewed at St. Jude. Patients received 12 intensive courses of systemic chemotherapy with hematopoietic growth factor support over 35 weeks, and amputation or limb-salvage surgery as indicated for local control. The sponsor assisted the partner site to establish a clinical research infrastructure and obtain hematopoietic growth factor. Communication among medical and nursing teams was maintained throughout the study. Patient-care and protocol issues were discussed frequently between the two centers via scheduled videoconferences and electronic communications. Auditors monitored appropriate study conduct at the international site. RESULTS: No major discrepancies were identified in histologic findings, staging, or imaging studies. Preliminary results demonstrated similar outcome and treatment tolerance; the 2-year event-free survival estimate was 78.5% (95% <e>CI</e>, 51-100%) for patients treated at CMH (median follow-up, 1.6 years) and 74.3% (95% CI, 62-87%) for patients treated at St. Jude (median follow-up, 4 years). Overall per-patient costs were significantly lower in Chile. CONCLUSIONS: Through a twinning mechanism, it is feasible to simultaneously conduct complex front-line osteosarcoma clinical trials at two institutions in countries with different levels of resources.",M2
17993363,"Treatment of postnatal depression in low-income mothers in primary-care clinics in Santiago, Chile: a randomised controlled trial.BACKGROUND: The optimum way to improve the recognition and treatment of postnatal depression in developing countries is uncertain. We compared the effectiveness of a multicomponent intervention with usual care to treat postnatal depression in low-income mothers in primary-care clinics in Santiago, Chile. METHODS: 230 mothers with major depression attending postnatal clinics were randomly allocated to either a multicomponent intervention (n=114) or usual care (n=116). The multicomponent intervention involved a psychoeducational group, treatment adherence support, and pharmacotherapy if needed. Usual care included all services normally available in the clinics, including antidepressant drugs, brief psychotherapeutic interventions, medical consultations, or external referral for specialty treatment. The primary outcome measure was the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) score at 3 and 6 months after randomisation. Analysis was by intention to treat. This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT00518830. FINDINGS: 208 (90%) of women randomly assigned to treatment groups completed assessments. The crude mean EPDS score was lower for the multicomponent intervention group than for the usual care group at 3 months (8.5 [95% <e>CI</e> 7.2-9.7] vs 12.8 [11.3-14.1]). Although these differences between groups decreased by 6 months, EPDS score remained better in multicomponent intervention group than in usual care group (10.9 [9.6-12.2] vs 12.5 [11.1-13.8]). The adjusted difference in mean EPDS between the two groups at 3 months was -4.5 (95% CI -6.3 to -2.7; p&lt;0.0001). The decrease in the number of women taking antidepressants after 3 months was greater in the intervention group than in the usual care group (multicomponent intervention from 60/101 [59%; 95% CI 49-69%] to 38/106 [36%; 27-46%]; usual care from 18/108 [17%; 10-25%] to 11/102 [11%; 6-19%]). INTERPRETATION: Our findings suggest that low-income mothers with depression and who have newly born children could be effectively helped, even in low-income settings, through multicomponent interventions. Further refinements to this intervention are needed to ensure treatment compliance after the acute phase.",M2
17992975,"[Socioeconomic level and nutritional status: a study in schoolchildren]Obesity increased in recent years at different rates among socioeconomic levels (SEL). The purpose of this study was to analyze the association between SEL and nutritional status in schoolchildren attending elementary schools in the six counties that show the highest prevalence of obesity in Santiago, Chile. Within the counties schools were stratified according to obesity and children were randomly selected from each school. Anthropometric assessment was performed in children whilst a socio-demographic survey and a 24 hour recall of food intake were applied to their mothers. We classified the sample according to SEL in two categories (higher and a lower vulnerability). The prevalence of excess weight was 51.1% (24.7% overweight and 26,4% obese) without significant differences among SEL. The most vulnerable group had lower values of body mass index, skinfold thickness, arm circumference and food intake however, these differences were not statistically significant. At the same time, these children were physically more active, showing higher use of community places to play [OR 1.91; 95% <e>CI</e> 1.05-3.48] and walked larger distances from houses to schools OR 6.6; CI 2.5-16.7).

17989859,"[Effect of the consumption of a food supplement on plasma zinc concentrations of free-living Chilean elderly adults]BACKGROUND: Zinc intake is well below recommendation among Chilean free living elderly adults of low socioeconomic level. AIM: To assess the effect of the consumption of a food supplement on plasma zinc concentrations in elderly adults (EA). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ambulatory EA (&gt; or = 70) with controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus or high blood pressure, ascribed to public family health centers were studied. They were separated in a control and intervention group, without blinding techniques. The intervention group consumed daily 50 g of a special nutritional supplement prepared as a soup or porridge, provided by the Government, for 3 months. The control group did not receive the supplement. A good compliance with the supplement was defined as a consumption of 7 portions per week. A fasting venous blood sample was obtained to determine plasma zinc at the beginning and end of the study. RESULTS: Forty three supplemented EA aged 76+/-5 years (21 women) and 31 non supplemented EA aged 78+/-5 years (20 women), completed 3 months of follow up. Mean compliance with the supplement was 40.5% (95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>) 40.3-40.6%). General characteristics of the study subjects upon recruitment were similar, except for the literacy that was higher in the intervention group. We fitted a multiple linear regression model which explained 39% of the variance, where the consumption of the nutritional supplement increased the concentration of plasmatic zinc by 4.14 microg/dL (95% CI 0.25-8.02) (p&lt;0.037), after controlling for sex, age, energy, vitamin E and calcium consumption. CONCLUSIONS: The consumption of a food supplement significantly increased plasma zinc concentrations in Chilean elderly adults.",M2
17988917,"Immunogenicity, safety, and interchangeability of two inactivated hepatitis A vaccines in Chilean children.OBJECTIVES: To compare the immunogenicity, safety, and interchangeability of two pediatric hepatitis A vaccines, Avaxim 80U-Pediatric and Havrix 720, in Chilean children. METHODS: In this randomized trial, 332 hepatitis A virus (HAV) seronegative children from 1 to 15 years of age received two doses of Avaxim, two doses of Havrix, or Havrix followed by Avaxim, 6 months apart. Anti-HAV antibody titers were measured before and 14 days after the first dose of vaccine, and before and 28 days after the second dose of vaccine. Immediate reactions were monitored; reactogenicity was evaluated from parental reports. RESULTS: Seroconversion rates after the first vaccination were 99.4% and 100% for Avaxim and Havrix, respectively. Anti-HAV geometric mean concentrations (GMCs) were 138 mIU/ml for Havrix (95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 120; 159) and 311 mIU/ml for Avaxim (95% CI: 274; 353). GMCs increased to 4008 mIU/ml after two doses of Havrix, 8537 mIU/ml following two doses of Avaxim, and 7144 mIU/ml in children who received Havrix with Avaxim as the second dose. Following the first injection, 36% of subjects given Avaxim and 44% given Havrix reported local reactions; 38% of subjects in the Avaxim group and 40% in the Havrix group reported systemic reactions related to vaccination. Solicited reactions were less frequent after the second dose of Avaxim or Havrix, occurring in 27% to 37% of subjects. CONCLUSIONS: No significant difference in seroconversion rates was seen 14 days after a single dose of vaccine. A two-dose schedule with either vaccine or with Havrix/Avaxim provided a strong booster response. Both vaccines were well tolerated and can be recommended for routine vaccination of Chilean children.

17927970,"-786T&gt;C polymorphism of the endothelial nitric oxide synthase gene in Chilean subjects with coronary artery disease and controls.BACKGROUND: The vascular endothelium plays an important role in the atherosclerotic process through the release of mediators such as nitric oxide. The NO relaxes vascular smooth muscle, inhibits platelet activation, and modulates migration and growth of vascular smooth muscle cells; consequently eNOS may have a significant atheroprotective function through this mechanism. The -786T&gt;C polymorphism of the eNOS gene has been implicated in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated the possible association between presence of CAD documented by angiography and the -786T&gt;C polymorphism of the NOS3 gene in Chilean individuals. METHODS: A total of 112 unrelated patients with diagnosis of CAD and 109 controls were included in this study. The -786T&gt;C gene polymorphism was analyzed by PCR-RFLP. RESULTS: The frequency of CC homozygous genotype for -786T&gt;C polymorphism was 6% in CAD patients and 4% in the control group. However, the genotype distribution and allele frequencies were not significantly different between CAD and control subjects (P=NS). Moreover, the odds ratio for CAD associated with the C variant failed to reach statistical significance (OR=1.03; 95% <e>CI</e>: 0.60-1.76, P=NS). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the -786T&gt;C polymorphism of the eNOS gene was not associated with CAD in study Chilean individuals.",M2
17901160,"Heightened bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the absence of heightened atopy in children with current wheezing and low income status.BACKGROUND: Although global studies such as the International Study of Asthma and Allergies in Childhood (ISAAC) have provided valuable data on the prevalence of asthma in children in Latin America, there is little information on the relationship between asthma symptoms, pulmonary function, bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) and atopy in the region. METHODS: This study examined the relationship between self-reported wheezing in the past 12 months, pulmonary function, airway responsiveness and atopy in children from a low income population in a neighbourhood of Santiago, Chile. Two random samples (100 each) of children aged 13-14 years who participated in ISAAC phase I were selected according to whether or not they reported wheezing in the past 12 months. Spirometry, the methacholine bronchial challenge test and the prick test were performed in all individuals. RESULTS: Children who reported current wheezing had significantly higher BHR to methacholine compared with those without wheezing (71.6% vs 52.6%; p = 0.007) and no significant difference was found in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (116.7 (12.3)% vs 120.3 (14.5%); p = 0.11). The prevalence of atopy was not significantly different between those children who reported wheezing compared with those who did not (44.2% vs 42.3%; p = 0.89). Multiple regression analysis showed that only BHR to methacholine (OR 2.72, 95% <e>CI</e> 1.25 to 4.13; p = 0.01) and maternal asthma (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.2 to 8.3, p = 0.03) were significant risk factors for current wheezing. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support previous findings suggesting that in adolescents from underprivileged populations, self-reported current wheezing is related to BHR but not to atopy.",M2
17889711,"RAD51 135G&gt;C polymorphism and risk of familial breast cancer in a South American population.Several studies have reported that mutations in genes involved in maintenance of genome integrity may be responsible for increased cancer risk. Human RAD51, known to function in DNA repair, interacts with a number of proteins implicated in breast cancer (BC), including BRCA1 and BRCA2. Few studies have investigated the role of RAD51 gene variations in familial BC. To detect potential novel gene defects that may contribute to hereditary BC susceptibility, 143 patients belonging to 143 Chilean families tested for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations were screened for mutations in RAD51, using conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis (CSGE) and DNA sequencing. No mutations were detected in the exon or splice-boundary regions of the RAD51 gene in these families. The RAD51 135G&gt;C polymorphism (c.-98G&gt;C, rs1801320) was studied in a case-control design, to evaluate its possible association with BC susceptibility. The frequency of the RAD51 135C allele was established in 143 cases and 247 controls, using restriction fragment length polymorphism-polymerase chain reaction. RAD51 135C genotypes (G/C and C/C) were associated with an increased BC risk only among women with (a) a family history of BC, (b) BRCA1/2 negative (n = 131), and (c) age at onset &lt;50 years (P = 0.020; OR = 2.17, 95% <e>CI</e> = 1.11-4.24). Thus, we propose that RAD51 135G&gt;C polymorphism presents an increased risk of familial BC in women with age &lt; 50 years at diagnosis, and this polymorphism may be a BC risk variant. This finding should be confirmed in other populations.",M2
17885940,"Nosocomial candiduria in women undergoing urinary catheterization. Clonal relationship between strains isolated from vaginal tract and urine.We determined the incidence of nosocomial candiduria associated with indwelling urinary catheters in 42 women with and without Candida spp. vaginal colonization being treated in the intensive care unit (ICU). We established a relationship between strains initially isolated from the vaginal tract and those subsequently recovered from urine samples through the use of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD). The overall incidence of nosocomial candiduria in these patients was 21.4%. Vaginal colonization by Candida spp. was detected in 11 patients (26.2%) of whom 6 (54.5%) developed candiduria. In comparison, only 3 (9.7%) cases of candiduria were found in women who were not colonized by the yeast (RR: 4.4, 95% <e>CI</e> 1.61-86.8, P=0.005). The dendrogram obtained by RAPD using 14 primers showed that the strains isolated from vagina and urine samples in five women had high similarity values (SAB &gt;0.9) forming independent clusters. Our study suggests that women vaginally colonized by Candida spp. in an ICU setting have a high risk of acquiring nosocomial candiduria and that strains isolated from both sites in a single patient may be genetically related.",M2
17875584,"Acute myocardial infarction mortality in comparison with lung and bladder cancer mortality in arsenic-exposed region II of Chile from 1950 to 2000.Arsenic in drinking water is known to be a cause of lung, bladder, and skin cancer, and some studies report cardiovascular disease effects. The authors investigated mortality from 1950 to 2000 in the arsenic-exposed region II of Chile (population: 477,000 in 2000) in comparison with the unexposed region V. Increased risks were found for acute myocardial infarction (AMI), with mortality rate ratios of 1.48 for men (95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 1.37, 1.59; p &lt; 0.001) and 1.26 for women (95% CI: 1.14, 1.40; p &lt; 0.001) during the high-exposure period in region II from 1958 to 1970. The highest rate ratios were for young adult men aged 30-49 years who were born during the high-exposure period with probable exposure in utero and in early childhood (rate ratio = 3.23, 95% CI: 2.79, 3.75; p &lt; 0.001). Compared with lung and bladder cancer, AMI mortality was the predominant cause of excess deaths during and immediately after the high-exposure period. Ten years after reduction of exposures, AMI mortality had decreased, and longer latency excess deaths from lung and bladder cancer predominated. With these three causes of death combined, increased mortality peaked in 1991-1995, with estimated excess deaths related to arsenic exposure constituting 10.9% of all deaths among men and 4.0% among women.",M2
17676252,"Smoking and common mental disorders: a population-based survey in Santiago, Chile.BACKGROUND: Smoking and common mental disorders (CMD), anxiety and depression, tend to co-exist and are important public health challenges for countries at all levels of development. We aimed to study the association between smoking and common mental disorders after adjusting for alcohol, illicit drug use and other confounders. METHODS: Cross-sectional household survey. CMD were assessed with a detailed psychiatric interview and smoking, alcohol, and illicit drug use with self-reported questionnaires. RESULTS: About 3,870 randomly selected adults were interviewed of whom 12.9% (95% <e>CI</e> 12-15) met criteria for ICD-10 CMD diagnoses. 38% (36-40) of the respondents were current smokers and 11% (10-13) ex-smokers. There was a robust association between heavier smoking and the presence and severity of CMD. However there were no major differences between non-smokers, ex-smokers and light smokers. In the fully adjusted models those individuals with ICD-10 CMD were significantly more likely to be current smokers [OR 1.6 (1.1-2.2)]. Smoking was also strongly associated with drinking heavily [OR 5.4 (4.0-7.3)] and illicit drug use [(OR 2.1 (1.1-4.1)] but there were no significant interactions. CONCLUSIONS: Smoking is highly prevalent and associated with CMD and other addictive behaviours in Chile. These are major public health problems in need of urgent action.",M2
17657329,"[Psychopathology and social functioning among offspring of depressed women]BACKGROUND: Offspring of depressive parents have two times more risk of developing a depression, other psychiatric diseases or a poor social functioning. AIM: To assess psychopathology and social functioning among offspring of currently depressed mothers. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We enrolled 290 depressed mother-child pairs in five primary-care clinics in Santiago. A two-stage screening process to identify female primary-care patients with current major depressive illness with children aged 6-16 years, was used. AH eligible and consenting patients were asked to complete the general health questionnaire (GHQ-12). Those scoring 5 or more were invited to participate in a baseline assessment. The final sample consisted of 290 mother-child pairs. Patients with a current DSM-IV diagnosis of major depression were eligible unless they had current psychotic symptoms, imminent suicide risk, history of mania, or current alcohol abuse. Child psychopathology was assessed with the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), a highly reliable and widely used parent-rated checklist to assess competencies and behavioural and emotional problems in children 4 to 18 years of age. RESULTS: Fifty percent (95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>): 43.9-55.7) of children had overall CBCL psychopathology scores in clinical range. Internalizing symptoms were more prevalent than externalizing symptoms (62.2% [9596CI: 56.3-67.8] and 35.7% [9596CI: 30.2-41.5]. CONCLUSIONS: A large proportion of children of depressed poor mothers attending primary care clinics in Chile, had psychopathological symptom scores in the clinical range, with a predominance of internalizing symptoms. These results are similar to those previously reported in the United States of America.",M2
17597241,"Diagnostic validity and costs of pooled fecal samples and individual blood or fecal samples to determine the cow- and herd-status for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis.Two tests are used on a regular basis to detect Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map): ELISA and fecal culture. Fecal culture is considered more sensitive and specific but is costly and requires 3-4 months for results. Pooling of fecal samples of individual animals may reduce the high costs of fecal culture. The objective of the study was to investigate the diagnostic validity and costs for pooling of fecal samples in dairy farms relative to culture or an ELISA on individual samples to determine the cow- or herd-status for Map. Fifty fecal and blood samples per herd were collected in 12 Chilean dairy herds. The sensitivity of pooling was estimated given the pool-size, amount of shedding in the pool and the prevalence in the herd. The sensitivity of the pools relative to individual fecal culture was 46% (95% <e>CI</e> 29-63%) and 48% (28-68%) for pools of 5 and 10 cows, respectively. The sensitivity of the pools was lower in pools with low shedders (26 and 24% for pools of 5 and 10, respectively) than in pools with moderate or heavy shedders (&gt;75% sensitivity). Pools of 10 cows are the better option to determine or monitor the herd status. A whole-herd ELISA is the least expensive way to determine the status of individual cows but has a lower Se and Sp than individual culture.",M2
17589748,"[Early tobacco and alcohol consumption as modifying risk factors on marijuana use]OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between early tobacco and alcohol use and the risk of marijuana consumption among schoolchildren. METHODS: A cross-sectional study comprising data from the Fourth National Study on Drug Use in the Chilean School Population (2001). There were studied 54,001 schoolchildren aged between eight and 20 years. Predictors were self-reported tobacco and alcohol use (ever users), age at initiation of tobacco and/or alcohol use, and intensity of tobacco use. The study outcome was self-reported marijuana use (ever users versus never users) and age at initiation of marijuana use. Poisson regression and Weibull regression were used for data analysis. RESULTS: Lifetime prevalence of tobacco use was high: 77%, alcohol 79%, and marijuana 23%. Tobacco consumption increased the likelihood of marijuana use (PR=10.4; 95% <e>CI</e>: 8.9;12.2). Later initiation of tobacco (HR=0.85; 95% CI: 0.84;0.86) and alcohol (HR=0.90; 95% CI: 0.89;0.91) decreased the risk of marijuana use. Marijuana use was higher in heavy smokers compared to light smokers (PR=3.11; 95% CI: 2.96;3.26 versus PR=1.70; 95% CI: 1.58;1.83). CONCLUSIONS: Tobacco use is strongly associated with marijuana use, which is significantly associated with the age at initiation of tobacco use, intensity of tobacco use and concurrent use of alcohol. Prevention strategies should target prevention of adolescent early tobacco use.",M2
17565762,"Effects of a dairy product fortified with multiple micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids on birth weight and gestation duration in pregnant Chilean women.OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that maternal food fortification with omega-3 fatty acids and multiple micronutrients increases birth weight and gestation duration, as primary outcomes. DESIGN: Non-blinded, randomised controlled study. SETTING: Pregnant women received powdered milk during their health check-ups at 19 antenatal clinics and delivered at two maternity hospitals in Santiago, Chile. SUBJECT: Pregnant women were assigned to receive regular powdered milk (n = 477) or a milk product fortified with multiple micronutrients and omega-3 fatty acids (n = 495). RESULTS: Intention-to-treat analysis showed that mean birth weight was higher in the intervention group than in controls (65.4 g difference, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 5-126 g; P = 0.03) and the incidence of very preterm birth (0.80 just for mean birth weight and birth length in the on-treatment analysis; birth length in that analysis had a difference of 0.57 cm (95% CI 0.19-0.96 cm; P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: The new intervention resulted in increased mean birth weight. Associations with gestation duration and most secondary outcomes need a larger sample size for confirmation.",M2
17565158,"Fifty-year study of lung and bladder cancer mortality in Chile related to arsenic in drinking water.BACKGROUND: Region II of Chile (the second most northerly administrative region) experienced dramatic increases in average arsenic water concentrations beginning in 1958, followed by marked declines in the 1970s when water treatment plants were installed. This history provides a unique opportunity to study time trends in the development of arsenic-related cancers, including lung and bladder cancers. METHODS: We investigated lung and bladder cancer mortality from 1950 to 2000 for region II compared with region V, where drinking water was not contaminated with arsenic. Mortality data were obtained from 218,174 death certificates for the two regions for 1950-1970 and from mortality data tapes that identified 307,541 deaths in the two regions for 1971-2000. Poisson regression models were used to identify time trends in rate ratios (RRs) of mortality from lung and bladder cancers comparing region II with region V. RESULTS: Lung and bladder cancer mortality rate ratios for region II compared with region V started to increase about 10 years after high arsenic exposures commenced and continued to rise until peaking in 1986-1997. The peak lung cancer mortality RRs were 3.61 (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>] = 3.13 to 4.16) for men and 3.26 (95% CI = 2.50 to 4.23) for women. The peak bladder cancer RRs were 6.10 (95% CI = 3.97 to 9.39) for men and 13.8 (95% CI = 7.74 to 24.5) for women. Combined lung and bladder cancer mortality rates in region II were highest in the period 1992-1994, with mortality rates of 153 and 50 per 100,000 men and women, respectively, in region II compared with 54 and 19 per 100,000 in region V. CONCLUSIONS: Such large increases in total population cancer mortality rates have, to our knowledge, not been documented for any other environmental exposure. The long latency pattern is noteworthy, with mortality from lung and bladder cancers continuing to be high until the late 1990s, even though major decreases in arsenic exposure occurred more than 25 years earlier.",M2
17554451,"[Under diagnosis of fetal growth restriction by the new growth curves of the Chilean Ministry of Health]BACKGROUND: Fetal growth restriction (FGR) is associated with increased risk of perinatal morbidity or death. Nationwide implementation of new fetal growth charts, requires a lower fetal weight for the diagnosis of FGR, compared to previous ones. This may lead to an under diagnosis of FGR in a large proportion of neonates. AIM: To compare the morbidity, mortality and anthropometry of neonates with FGR, diagnosed by MINSAL and Juez curves, with normal weight newborns in the same period (2000-2004). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Revision of medical records of all births occurring in a maternity hospital between 2000 and 2004. The number of neonatal deaths, and the presence of hyperbilirubinemia, polyglobulia, hypoglycemia and hypothermia, were compared among children classified to be below percentile 10 of fetal growth according to both growth charts. RESULTS: FGR was diagnosed in 4,4% (502/11.289) and 9% (1.029/11.289) of newborns by MINSAL and Juez curves respectively. Compared to normal weight controls, the 527 newborns without FGR according to MINSAL curves, but below percentile 10 of Juez curves, had an odds ratio (OR) for polyglobulina of 8.14 (95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>): 1.01-65.34), an OR for neonatal hypoglycemia of 5.10 (95% CI: 1.11-23.39) and an OR for a ponderal index below 10th percentile of 10.98 (95% CI: 6.84-17.64). CONCLUSIONS: Newborns without a diagnosis of FGR by MINSAL curves but below 10th percentile by Juez curves, have neonatal outcomes suggesting a true FGR. Juez curves should be maintained as a standard for the evaluation of fetal growth in our population.",M2
17531933,"Relation between insulin resistance and breast cancer among Chilean women.PURPOSE: In Chile, diabetes and breast cancer are important public health problems. The association between insulin resistance and breast cancer, however, remains largely unexplored. METHODS: We conducted a case-control study to assess the relationship of insulin resistance (IR) and breast cancer in Chilean premenopausal and postmenopausal women. We compared 170 women, 33 to 86 years old, with incident breast cancer and 170 normal mammography controls, matched by 5-year age interval. Plasmatic insulin and glucose were measured and IR was calculated by the homeostasis model assessment method. Anthropometric measurements and sociodemographic and behavioral data were also collected. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (<e>CIs</e>) were estimated by multivariable conditional logistic regression. RESULTS: IR was independently associated with breast cancer in postmenopausal women (OR = 2.70, 95%CI = 1.10-6.63), but not in premenopausal women (OR = 0.84, 95%CI = 0.20-3.52). Obesity was not associated with breast cancer at any age (OR = 0.68, 95%CI = 0.39-1.20). CONCLUSION: In this sample, IR increased the risk of breast cancer among postmenopausal women.",M2
17459841,"Diagnosis of paratuberculosis by fecal culture and ELISA on milk and serum samples in two types of Chilean dairy goat herds.Fecal culture has been the primary method used to diagnose paratuberculosis in goats. It is laborious, slow, and expensive. Validation of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) on milk samples could make paratuberculosis testing more widely available for goat farmers. The aim of this study was to determine the accuracy of serum and milk ELISAs for paratuberculosis, relative to fecal culture, in Chilean dairy goats. Eight dairy goat herds were selected. Feces, blood, and milk samples were collected from all female goats &gt;2 years old. Fecal samples were cultured using Herrold egg yolk medium with mycobactin J and antibiotics. Serum and milk samples were tested using a commercial ELISA kit for Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis antibody detection. A total of 383 goats were tested by ELISA and fecal culture. The sensitivity of ELISA on serum and milk relative to fecal culture was 74.3% (95% <e>CI</e>: 59.8-88.8) and 60% (95% CI: 43.8-76.2), respectively. The corresponding values for ELISA specificity based on the percentage of non- M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis-infected goats testing ELISA-negative were 98.6% (95% CI: 96.6-100) and 99.3% (95% CI: 97.9-100) on serum and milk, respectively. Proportions of positive results for serum and fecal samples were significantly different, whereas the proportions of positive results for milk and fecal samples were not significantly different. The milk ELISA had a moderate level of agreement with fecal culture results (Kappa = 0.57). The paratuberculosis ELISA on goat milk samples may be a cost-effective, accurate alternative to fecal culture.",M2
17416755,"Gastric cancer is related to early Helicobacter pylori infection in a high-prevalence country.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Chile ranks fifth in the world among countries with the highest incidence of gastric cancer. The aim was to quantify the association between Helicobacter pylori infection and gastric cancer mortality at the county of residence. METHODS: A cross-sectional household survey, a probability sample of the Chilean adult population, provided 2,615 participants in whom serum H. pylori IgG antibodies were measured (ELISA). The spatial pattern of 48,367 deaths due to gastric cancer which occurred from 1985 to 2002 was analyzed using a hierarchical Poisson regression model; 333 counties were categorized as low, medium, and high gastric cancer mortality with median gastric cancer death rates of 11.4, 19.1, and 26.0 per 100,000 inhabitants, respectively. The association between H. pylori positivity and gastric cancer mortality in the county of residence was assessed by multivariate Poisson regression for complex samples. RESULTS: H. pylori prevalence was 73.0% [95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>), 70.0-76.0], higher in men [prevalence rate ratio (PRR), 1.1 (95% CI, 1.01-1.20)], peaked at ages 45 to 64, and dropped after age 65. It was higher among residents in counties with high gastric cancer mortality (79.7%; 95% CI, 76.4-82.6) compared to counties with low gastric cancer mortality (62.3%; 95% CI, 53.8-70.2; corresponding PRR, 1.3; 95% CI, 1.1-1.5); under age 24, H. pylori infection was 79.7% (95% CI, 72.2-85.6) versus 39.8% (95% CI, 19.6-64.2) among residents in counties with high and low gastric cancer mortalities, respectively (PRR, 2.0; 95% CI, 1.1-3.7). CONCLUSIONS: The high prevalence of H. pylori at younger ages was associated with high gastric cancer mortality in the base population.",M2
17356093,"Etiology of community-acquired pneumonia in hospitalized patients in chile: the increasing prevalence of respiratory viruses among classic pathogens.BACKGROUND AND STUDY OBJECTIVES: The range and relative impact of microbial pathogens, particularly viral pathogens, as a cause of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in hospitalized adults has not received much attention. The aim of this study was to determine the microbial etiology of CAP in adults and to identify the risk factors for various specific pathogens. METHODS: We prospectively studied 176 patients (mean [+/- SD] age, 65.8 +/- 18.5 years) who had hospitalized for CAP to identify the microbial etiology. For each patient, sputum and blood cultures were obtained as well as serology testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydophila pneumoniae, urinary antigen testing for Legionella pneumophila and Streptococcus pneumoniae, and a nasopharyngeal swab for seven respiratory viruses. RESULTS: Microbial etiology was determined in 98 patients (55%). S pneumoniae (49 of 98 patients; 50%) and respiratory viruses (32%) were the most frequently isolated pathogen groups. Pneumococcal pneumonia was associated with tobacco smoking of &gt; 10 pack-years (odds ratio [OR], 2.6; 95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>], 1.2 to 5.4; p = 0.01). Respiratory viruses were isolated more often in fall or winter (28%; p = 0.011), and as an exclusive etiology tended to be isolated in patients &gt;/= 65 years of age (20%; p = 0.07). Viral CAP was associated with antimicrobial therapy prior to hospital admission (OR, 4.5; 95% CI, 1.4 to 14.6). CONCLUSIONS: S pneumoniae remains the most frequent pathogen in adults with CAP and should be covered with empirical antimicrobial treatment. Viruses were the second most common etiologic agent and should be tested for, especially in fall or winter, both in young and elderly patients who are hospitalized with CAP.",M2
17292994,"FABP2 Ala54Thr polymorphism and diabetes in Chilean elders.OBJECTIVE: The FABP2 Ala54Thr polymorphism has been associated with insulin resistance and diabetes in several populations. The aim of this study was to estimate the prevalence of FABP2 genotypes in 223 Chilean subjects (136 women and 87 men aged 65-79 years) and its association with type 2 diabetes in a 4 years follow-up. METHODS: Glucose, Insulin and lipids were measured in fasting plasma samples. Insulin resistance was estimated through the homeostasis model assessment. Diabetes was diagnosed according ADA criteria. The Ala54Thr allelic variant was determined by polymerase chain reaction and restriction fragment-length polymorphism analysis. Logistic regression techniques were used to assess gene-disease associations. RESULTS: Genotype frequencies were estimated as 30.5, 49.3 and 20.2% for the Ala/Ala, Ala/Thr and Thr/Thr, respectively. The crude OR for the association between Thr54 carriers and diabetes was estimated as 2.18 (1.12-4.24). The corresponding OR for the association between Thr54 carriers with Metabolic Syndrome was 1.06 (0.59-1.88). After adjustment by BMI and age, a significant association persists for Thr54Thr carriers and diabetes (OR 2.70; 95% <e>CI</e> 1.113-6.527). The 4-year cumulative incidence of diabetes was higher in Thr carriers than in non-carriers (20.1% versus 8.5%; p&lt;0.04). The adjusted association between Thr54Thr polymorphism and diabetes incidence was OR 3.84 (95% CI: 1.140-12.910) CONCLUSION: Our results strongly suggest an association between the Ala54Thr polymorphism of FABP2 with diabetes, revealing a genetic dosage effect regarding its association with diabetes in Chilean elders.",M2
17211557,"Lack of association between the fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) polymorphism with obesity and insulin resistance in two aboriginal populations from Chile.The aim of this study was to assess the frequency of fatty acid binding protein 2 (FABP2) Ala54Thr genetic polymorphism and to evaluate its association with obesity and insulin resistance in Chilean aboriginal populations. A sample of 96 urban Aymara and 111 urban Mapuche subjects aged 20-80 years were recruited for this cross-sectional study. Glucose, insulin and lipid profile were measured in fasting plasma samples. Insulin resistance was estimated through the HOMA-IR model. FABP2 Ala54Thr genotypes were determined by PCR followed by RFLP analysis. The allele frequency of Thr54 variant was estimated as 18.2% in Aymara subjects, which is one of the lowest reported to date. The corresponding frequency in Mapuche subjects was 31.9% (p&lt;0.002). Regarding genotype-phenotype associations, no significant differences were found in any of the anthropometric or metabolic variables according to Ala54Thr genotypes. After adjustment by BMI and metabolic variables through a logistic regression analysis, the association of the FABP2 polymorphism with ethnic group persisted (Mapuche group: OR=2.37, 95% <e>CI</e> 1.319-4.277, p=0.004) It is unlikely that Ala54Thr polymorphism of the FABP2 gene plays a relevant role in obesity and insulin resistance in Chilean ethnic groups.",M2
17188381,"Bayesian analysis to validate a commercial ELISA to detect paratuberculosis in dairy herds of southern Chile.In Chile, Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) has been isolated on several occasions and clinical cases have been reported. Nevertheless, diagnostic tests have not yet been validated for this agent in the Chilean setting. The objective of the study was to validate a commercial ELISA to detect Map shedding dairy cows in management conditions, prevalence and stages of infection existing in Southern Chile, utilising different statistical approaches. Blood and faeces were collected from 1333 lactating cows in 27 dairy herds (both large commercial and smallholder dairy farms) between September 2003 and August 2004. Within the herds up to a maximum of 100 dairy cows were selected based on age (&gt;or=3 years old) and, if present, clinical signs of a Map infection. In herds with less than 100 cows, all cows &gt;or=3 years old were sampled. Blood samples were tested using a commercial ELISA kit (IDEXX Laboratories, Inc.). Faecal samples were cultured on Herrold's Egg Yolk Medium (HEYM). Latent class models (i.e. maximum likelihood (ML) methods and Bayesian inference) were used to determine the validity of the ELISA. Map was cultured from 54 (4.1%) cows and 10 (37.0%) herds, which were all large, commercial dairy herds. As a result of empty cells in the cross-tabulations, the ML model provided the same results as the validation with faecal culture as the gold-standard. In the Bayesian model, the Se and Sp of the ELISA were estimated to be 26% (95% <e>CI</e>: 18-35%) and 98.5% (95% CI: 97.4-99.4%), respectively. For faecal culture, the Se was 54% (95% CI: 46-62%) and the Sp was 100% (95% CI: 99.9-100%). Interestingly, the prevalence in the smallholder dairy farms was estimated to be 8% even though there were no faecal culture positive cows detected in those herds. There was no significant correlation between the two tests. The advantage of Bayesian inference is that the Se and Sp of both tests are obtained in one model relative to the (latent) true disease status, the model can handle small datasets and empty cells and the estimates can be corrected for the correlation between tests when the tests are not conditionally independent. Therefore, Bayesian analysis was the preferred method for Map that lacks a gold-standard and usually has low cow-level prevalence.",M2
17186097,"[Smoking and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease: attributable risk determination]BACKGROUND: Smoking is the main risk factor for Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), an important cause of morbidity and mortality. AIM: To estimate smoking attributable risk and population attributable risk in COPD patients attended in Public Health Services of Santiago. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A case control study matched by sex and age was carried out. Crude and adjusted attributable risks as well as population attributable risk were estimated, controlled by potential confounders and by interaction variables. RESULTS: Mean ages for cases and controls were 68 and 67 years respectively. When compared to the control group, COPD patients had a higher smoking prevalence (at least 100 cigarettes in their life span: 89.7% vs 60.3%; p &lt;0.01). Among COPD patients, heavy smokers proportion was 4 times higher than in controls, they smoked for more years (43 vs 31; p &lt;0.01) and more cigarettes per day (18 vs 5; p &lt;0.01). Adjusted attributable risk was 87% (95% Confidence Interval (<e>CI</e>): 63.7-94.8). If a patient smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his/her life span and this risk was 92.7% (CI: 82.4-96.9) for heavy smokers. Projecting this index to Santiago inhabitants, about 87,000 individuals older than 40 years would be suffering COPD due to smoking. CONCLUSIONS: This article confirms the strong association between smoking and COPD. Attributable risks are high and significant, even when they are adjusted by confounding variables. Women had a higher risk than men, at lower levels of tobacco consumption.",M2
17183086,"The association between reproductive performance and milk yield in Chilean Holstein cattle.The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between reproductive performance and milk yield in central-southern Chilean Holstein cattle that calved from 1990 to 2003. The analysis included 150,457 lactations obtained from a certified recording system. Reproductive indexes included in the study were calving interval (<e>CI</e>, d), calving to first service interval (CFSI, d), calving to conception interval (CCI, d), services per conception (SC), and conception rate at first service (CRFS). Survival analysis for the risk of pregnancy was also conducted. Models for reproductive indexes were significant and included, as independent variables, year and season of parturition, parity, length of dry period, milk and fat production standardized to 305 d, herd size, and herd. In 1990 and 2003, respectively, means +/- SEM for CI were 399 +/- 1.6 and 415 +/- 1.1 d; for CFSI were 85 +/- 0.6 and 97 +/- 0.6 d; for CCI were 124 +/- 1.3 d and 137 +/- 1 d; and for SC were 1.6 +/- 0.02 and 1.7 +/- 0.01. For every 100 kg of 305-d standardized milk yield, the CCI increased by 0.6 d and CRFS decreased by 0.9%. Association between milk yield and the risk of pregnancy was almost zero when a Cox proportional regression model was conducted (hazard ratio = 1.005; 95% confidence interval = 1.002 to 1.008). We conclude that CCI has increased over time and is related negatively to the increase in milk yield experienced by central-southern Chilean Holstein cattle during the last 15 yr. Nevertheless, risk of pregnancy was not explained by the individual level of standardized 305-d milk yield of cows studied.",M2
17171211,"[Allelic variants of cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1), glutathione S transferase M1 (GSTM1) polymorphisms and their association with smoking and alcohol consumption as gastric cancer susceptibility biomarkers]BACKGROUND: Gastric cancer (GaC) is the second cause of death by cancer in the world and one of the first causes in Chile. However, the burden of this disease shows remarkable worldwide variation probably explained by environmental and genetic factors. The role of susceptibility low penetrance genes and environmental and dietary factors in the etiology of gastric cancer is not well-known. Aim: To analyze the possible association between CaG susceptibility, genetic (CYP1A1 and GSTM1 polymorphisms) and environmental (tobacco and alcohol) factors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a case-control study, we included 73 patients with a pathologically diagnosed GaC and 263 controls. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood to detect allele variants for CYP1A1 and GSTM1, using polymerase chain reactions and digestion with restriction enzymes. RESULTS: There was a clear association of smoking and alcohol ingestion with GaC with odds ratios (OR) of 2.54 (95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>) of 1.45-4.46 and OR of 3.36 (95% CI 1.76-6.41), respectively. Polymorphic variants of CYP1A1 and GSTM1 had no association with GaC. However, the m2 variant of CYP1A1 significantly modifies the risk induced by tobacco or alcohol (OR 13.65; 95% CI 3.15-59.05 y 8.37; 95% CI 1.86-37.64, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Subjects that carry the m2 allelic variant of CYP1A1 and are exposed to tobacco smoke or alcohol have a significantly higher risk of developing gastric cancer.",M2
17167709,"[Predictors of hospital death and prolonged hospitalization in patients with cardiac failure in Chilean hospitals]BACKGROUND: Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common causes for hospital admission. Aim: To evaluate clinical predictors of mortality and prolonged hospital stay among patients admitted for HF in Chilean hospitals. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Prospective registry of 14 centers. Patients admitted for HF in functional class III and IV were included. Epidemiological, clinical data, functional class, decompensation cause, electrocardiogram, echocardiogram, treatment and evolution were registered. The endpoint was hospital death and hospital stay greater than 10 days. RESULTS: Data from 646 patients (mean age 69+/-13 years, 56% men) was collected. The main etiologies of HF were hypertensive in 29.6%, ischemic in 27.1% and valvular in 20%. Mean hospital stay was 10+/-9 days and mortality was 5.6%. Independent predictors of death and prolonged hospital stay were serum sodium &lt;130 mEq/L at admission (odds ratio (OR) 2.6, confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) = 1.2-5.9), serum albumin &lt;3 g/dL (OR 3.2, CI= 1.42-7.2) and a history of hypertension (OR 1.98, CI = 1.1-3.85). The model predicted correctly the occurrence of the endpoint in 67% of cases. CONCLUSIONS: In patients admitted for worsening HF, low serum sodium, decreased serum albumin on admission and a history of hypertension increase the risk for in-hospital death and prolonged hospital stay.",M2
17130951,"[Impact of air pollution by fine particulate matter (PM10) on daily mortality in Temuco, Chile.]BACKGROUND: Temuco (304,000 inhabitants) has high levels of air pollution, mainly due to fine particulate matter of less than 10 microm (PM10). The effects of this pollution on population health have not been studied. AIM: To study the short-term effects of PM10 on daily mortality in Temuco, in Southern Chile, due to respiratory and cardiovascular causes. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We followed the APHEA methodology (Air Pollution and Health European Approach) by estimating poisson multivariate regression models and controlling by trends, seasonality and meteorology. The PM10 variable was introduced after controlling by the confounders and checking by statistical adjustment and autocorrelation of errors. Mortality data was obtained from the Ministry of Health, registering age, gender, place of residence and cause of death. Cancer, respiratory and cardiovascular deaths, occurring between 1997 and 2002, were recorded for this study. RESULTS: There was a significant and positive association between PM10 concentration and daily mortality caused by respiratory disease (p-value=0.046, relative risk (RR) 1.236, 95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 1.004-1.522) and cardiovascular diseases in people aged 65 years and more (p-value=0.042; RR 1.176 95% CI 1.006-1.374). CONCLUSIONS: There is a significant association between daily air pollution by PM10 particulate matter and mortality in Temuco, Chile.",M2
17047469,"Urine microscopy as screen for urinary tract infections in a pediatric emergency unit in Chile.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy of urine microscopy as a predictor of urinary tract infections (UTIs), taking the urine culture as a criterion standard in a pediatric emergency unit. METHODS: Retrospective study in which all medical charts were analyzed for children younger than 15 years who underwent urine culture and sediment tests. Urine microscopy test was considered positive for leukocyturia when there were more than 10 leukocytes per microliter, and bacteriuria test was considered positive when any presence of bacteria was detected at x40 magnification. The method of sample taking was also recorded. RESULTS: Of 18,302 consultations of children younger than 15 years, 1173 (6.4%) needed both a urine culture and a urine microscopy. Urine cultures demonstrated that 20.9% of the samples were consistent with the diagnosis of UTI. Bacteriuria and leukocyturia tests had a sensitivity of 87.4% (95% <e>CI</e>, 82.7%-91.0%), a specificity of 94.8% (95% CI, 93.2%-96.1%), a likelihood ratio for a positive test of 16.7 (95% CI, 16.18-17.61), and a likelihood ratio for a negative test of 0.13 (95% CI, 0.12-0.14). Samples taken by sterile methods (suprapubic aspiration and bladder catheterization) had a better positive predictive value than those taken by nonsterile methods (urine bag and midstream clean-catch) without having an adverse impact on the negative predictive value. CONCLUSIONS: Urine microscopy without Gram stain is a good test for predicting the presence of UTIs in children, which supports the use of this screening method in pediatric emergency units.",M2
16882542,"Increased mortality from lung cancer and bronchiectasis in young adults after exposure to arsenic in utero and in early childhood.Arsenic in drinking water is an established cause of lung cancer, and preliminary evidence suggests that ingested arsenic may also cause nonmalignant lung disease. Antofagasta is the second largest city in Chile and had a distinct period of very high arsenic exposure that began in 1958 and lasted until 1971, when an arsenic removal plant was installed. This unique exposure scenario provides a rare opportunity to investigate the long-term mortality impact of early-life arsenic exposure. In this study, we compared mortality rates in Antofagasta in the period 1989-2000 with those of the rest of Chile, focusing on subjects who were born during or just before the peak exposure period and who were 30-49 years of age at the time of death. For the birth cohort born just before the high-exposure period (1950-1957) and exposed in early childhood, the standardized mortality ratio (SMR) for lung cancer was 7.0 [95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>), 5.4-8.9; p&lt;0.001] and the SMR for bronchiectasis was 12.4 (95% CI, 3.3-31.7; p&lt;0.001). For those born during the high-exposure period (1958-1970) with probable exposure in utero and early childhood, the corresponding SMRs were 6.1 (95% CI, 3.5-9.9; p&lt;0.001) for lung cancer and 46.2 (95% CI, 21.1-87.7; p&lt;0.001) for bronchiectasis. These findings suggest that exposure to arsenic in drinking water during early childhood or in utero has pronounced pulmonary effects, greatly increasing subsequent mortality in young adults from both malignant and nonmalignant lung disease.",M2
16848335,"Respiratory consequences of light and moderate smoking in young adults in Chile.OBJECTIVE: To assess the association between smoking and respiratory symptoms, lung function and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) in young adults in Chile. SETTING: Selected sample of 1232 subjects aged 22-28 years. DESIGN: In this cross-sectional study, the outcome measures were: respiratory symptoms, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1), forced vital capacity (FVC), forced expiratory flow between 25% and 75% (FEF25-75), FEV1/FVC and BHR. RESULTS: Among the 1232 subjects, 67.7% of the men and 49.4% of the women were smokers; the median cigarettes smoked per day was four for men and three for women. Smoking was associated with wheezing, waking up with a cough, breathlessness following exercise and persistent cough, with odds ratios (OR) between 1.94 (95% <e>CI</e> 1.41-2.66) and 3.12 (95% CI 2.21-4.40) among those smoking &gt; or = 5 cigarettes per day, compared to non-smokers. Smoking &lt; 5 cigarettes was significantly associated with wheezing and waking up with a cough. Smokers had a lower FEV1/FVC than non-smokers by approximately 0.8%. Smoking was not associated with FEV1, FEF25-75 or BHR status. CONCLUSIONS: This study highlights the early effects of smoking on respiratory symptoms. It could help governments in Latin America take vigorous action to deter young people from starting smoking.",M2
16724168,"Val/Leu247 and Trp/Ser316 polymorphisms in beta 2 glycoprotein I and their association with thrombosis in unselected Chilean patients.It is known that polymorphisms of beta (2)-glycoprotein I (beta (2)GPI) in exon 7 affect interaction between the phospholipid binding site and the antibodies, and that other polymorphisms in exon 8 increase the generation of antibodies. In this study, we analyzed genetic polymorphisms of beta (2)GPI in unselected Chilean patients to determine the prevalence of beta (2)GPI polymorphisms in the phospholipid domain in patients with venous and arterial thrombosis and the clinical correlation with thromboembolic complications. This study comprised 149 patients with venous and arterial thrombosis (62 with venous thrombosis and 87 with arterial thrombosis) and 160 healthy controls with no previous history of thrombosis. Polymorphisms of exons 7 and 8 of beta (2)GPI, which encode for its fifth domain, were determined by PCR-RFLP. The presence of aPL or anti-beta (2)GPI in the patients was detected by ELISA. Anti-beta (2)GPI were present in 8/149 patients (5.4%); of these, five had aCL antibodies of low titer. The allele containing Val/Leu(247) and Trp/Ser(316) was significantly more frequent in patients with thrombosis than in the control group (OR=3.1, <e>CI</e> 1.6-6.0, p=0.0003; OR=2.9, CI 1.1-8.6, p=0.027, respectively). These polymorphisms did not correlate with aPL or anti-beta (2)GPI but significant differences were observed with venous thrombosis (p=&lt;0.0001) and arterial thrombosis (p=0.026). In conclusion, the beta (2)GPI polymorphisms Val/Leu(247) and Trp/Ser(316) are not related to the presence of anti-beta (2)GPI antibodies in unselected Chilean patients with venous and arterial thrombosis, but they are significantly associated with venous and arterial thrombosis.",M2
16616056,"Endothelial nitric oxide synthase G894T gene polymorphism in Chilean subjects with coronary artery disease and controls.BACKGROUND: Nitric oxide (NO) from the endothelium, produced by oxidation of l-arginine to L-citruline for the action at the endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS), is considered an important atheroprotective factor. The Glu298Asp (G894T) polymorphic variant of the eNOS gene has been implicated in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). We investigated the association between occurrence of CAD documented by angiography and the G894T polymorphism of the NOS3 gene in Chilean individuals. METHODS: A total of 112 unrelated patients with diagnosis of CAD and 72 controls were included in this study. G894T gene polymorphism was analyzed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). RESULTS: The frequency of TT homozygous genotype for G894T polymorphism was 7% in CAD patients and 1% in the control group. However, the genotype distribution and allele frequencies were not significantly different between CAD and control subjects (P&gt;0.05). Moreover, the odds ratio for CAD associated with the T variant failed to reach statistical significance (OR=1.5; 95% <e>CI</e>: 0.87-2.59, P&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: These findings suggest that the G894T polymorphism of the eNOS gene was not associated with CAD in Chilean individuals.",M2
16516330,"Gallbladder disease is associated with insulin resistance in a high risk Hispanic population.BACKGROUND/AIMS: We tested whether cholesterol gallstone disease (GS) is associated to insulin resistance and serum C-reactive protein (CRP) in a high risk population. METHODS: This was a nested case-control study on 881 Chilean subjects that included clinical examination, abdominal ultrasound and blood chemistries. Insulin resistance was determined by the homeostasis model assessment index (IR-HOMA). RESULTS: Compared to controls (n = 582), age and sex adjusted median IR-(HOMA) was significantly elevated in subjects with GS (n = 299) (P &lt; 0.001). Risks of GS in subjects with insulin resistance and different body mass index (BMI) were: BMI &lt; 25, 2.2 (1.1-4.7); BMI 25-30, 1.5 (0.9-2.5) and BMI &gt; 30, 1.7 (1.0-2.9). Risk of GS in subjects with metabolic syndrome was 1.7 (<e>CI</e>, 1.2-2.5) and with fatty liver, 1.5 (1.1-2.2). Risk of GS in subjects with CRP &gt; 1 mg/dL was 1.0 (0.7-1.7). CONCLUSIONS: GS is associated to insulin resistance, fatty liver and to metabolic syndrome, but not to serum CRP in a high risk Hispanic population. Insulin resistance could have a major role in the pathogenesis of GS favoring the production of cholesterol supersaturated bile and altering gallbladder function.",M2
16333939,"Prevalence of asthma, atopy and bronchial hyperresponsiveness and their interrelation in a semi-rural area of Chile.OBJECTIVE: To assess the prevalence of asthma symptoms and their association with sensitisation to eight allergens and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine. SETTING: A random sample of 1232 adults, aged 22 to 28 years, studied in a Chilean semi-rural area. DESIGN: A cross-sectional design for the purpose of this analysis. RESULTS: The prevalence of wheeze was 27.4% (95%<e>CI</e> 24.9-29.9) and waking with breathlessness 13.7% (95%CI 11.8-15.6), higher than the results of a multi-centre European study. Only 7.8% (95%CI 6.3-9.3) had a positive BHR (&lt; or =8 mg/ml) and 26.3% (95%CI 23.8-28.8) were atopic. The Youden index of asthma symptoms in non-atopic subjects varied from 0.184 to 0.259 when using BHR as gold standard for asthma, and increased from 0.379 to 0.504 among those with positive atopy. Only 4.5% reported asthma, and the Youden index was slightly higher in comparison to the asthma symptom groups. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of asthma symptoms in young adults was high, but only a small proportion of these were sensitised or had a positive BHR. We believe that aetiological studies of asthma should analyse subjects with asthma symptoms separately from those with positive atopic status or positive BHR.",M2
16317207,"Inequities in mental health care after health care system reform in Chile.OBJECTIVES: We compared differences in mental health needs and provision of mental health services among residents of Santiago, Chile, with private and public health insurance coverage. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional survey of a random sample of adults. Presence of mental disorders and use of health care services were assessed via structured interviews. Individuals were classified as having public, private, or no health insurance coverage. RESULTS: Among individuals with mental disorders, only 20% (95% confidence interval [<e>CI</e>]=16%, 24%) had consulted a professional about these problems. A clear mismatch was found between need and provision of services. Participants with public insurance coverage exhibited the highest prevalence of mental disorders but the lowest rates of consultation; participants with private coverage exhibited exactly the opposite pattern. After adjustment for age, income, and severity of symptoms, private insurance coverage (odds ratio [OR]=2.72; 95% CI=1.6, 4.6) and higher disability level (OR=1.27, 95% CI=1.1, 1.5) were the only factors associated with increased frequency of mental health consultation. CONCLUSIONS: The health reforms that have encouraged the growth of the private health sector in Chile also have increased risk segmentation within the health system, accentuating inequalities in health care provision.",M2
16311691,"[Predictors of non fatal cardiovascular events in a Chilean cohort: results of the San Francisco Project]BACKGROUND: The San Francisco Project is a prospective study aiming to determine the most important cardiovascular risk factors in the Chilean population. AIM: To report the results of the San Francisco Project after a mean follow up of five years. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between 1997 and 1999, 920 subjects (aged 39.5 +/- 16.3 years, 382 males), free of cardiovascular events, were examined to determine their cardiovascular risk factors. The prevalence of risk factors was compared with the Chilean National Health Survey. All non fatal cardiovascular events were registered until 2003. A logistic regression model including gender, obesity, family history, educational level and classical cardiovascular risk factors, was performed to identify independent predictors of cardiovascular events. RESULTS: The prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors in the studied population was similar to that of the Chilean National Health Survey, except for serum lipid levels, that were lower in the latter. The mean follow up was 5.3 +/- 0.3 years (range 4-6 years), and 26 cardiovascular events were registered. The independent predictors of these events were age, with a relative risk (RR) of 4.3 and 95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>) of 1.9 to 9.5 (p &lt;0.001), high blood pressure with a RR of 5.2 (95% CI 2.3-11.7, p &lt;0.001), diabetes mellitus with a RR of 4.5 (95% CI 1.9-10.7, p &lt;0.01) and a low socioeconomic level with a RR of 3.5 (95% CI 1.5-7.9, p &lt;0.01). The model did not accept serum lipid levels, smoking and alcohol intake as independent predictors. CONCLUSIONS: In this cohort of Chilean people, the independent predictors of non fatal cardiovascular events were high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus and a low socioeconomic level.",M2
16010246,"Incidence and prevalence of hepatitis C virus infection in Chile.Chronic hepatitis C is a major cause of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Epidemiological data regarding this infection in developing countries is scanty. METHODS: Prevalence of hepatitis C (HCV) infection was investigated in a random sample of Chilean general adult population older than 20 years of age. Additionally, frequency of HCV infection was assessed in group of native Chilean Amerindians (Mapuche Indians) living in an isolated locality of the Southern Chile. Incidence of HCV infection was estimated using serum samples separated by 7 years (1993-2000). RESULTS: Among 959 subjects, prevalence of anti-HCV antibodies was 1.15% (95% <e>CI</e> 0.48-1.82%) and 0.83% when only RIBA-confirmed cases were considered. Among these subjects, 62.5% had detectable HCV RNA in serum and 40% of them had a history of blood transfusion. Age distribution of cases showed a steadily increasing prevalence with age. Estimated incidence of new HCV infections was 15 per 100,000 subjects per year in the period 1993-2000. No cases were detected among the 145 Mapuche subjects studied. CONCLUSIONS: HCV infection is a prevalent disease in the Hispanic population of Chile with a low incidence in the last decade, whereas it was not detected in an isolated Mapuche Indian community. Age distribution of prevalence suggests that the peak of infection in Chile occurred 30 to 50 years ago.",M2
15994261,"The early origins hypothesis with an emphasis on growth rate in the first year of life and asthma: a prospective study in Chile.BACKGROUND: There is uncertainty about the impact of the programming hypothesis in terms of nutritional status at birth, rate of growth in the first year of life, length of gestation, breast feeding, and episodes of illness on asthma. An analysis was therefore carried out to test this hypothesis. METHODS: Data were collected on 1232 children born between 1974 and 1978 in a semi-rural area of Chile. Measurements at birth and growth in the first year of life were obtained from a birth registry and clinical notes. Information on asthma was collected using the European Community Respiratory Health Survey questionnaire. Sensitisation to eight allergens and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR) to methacholine were determined. All other information was obtained using a questionnaire. Polytomous logistic analyses were carried out to explore the association of factors at birth and during the first year of life with asthma symptoms, atopy, and BHR. RESULTS: Weight and length gain in the first year were positively associated with wheeze (odds ratio (OR) 1.004, 95% <e>CI</e> 1.001 to 1.007 and OR 1.11, 95% CI 0.98 to 1.25, respectively). A higher body mass index (BMI) at birth was protective in subjects reporting both wheeze and waking with breathlessness (OR 0.54, 95% CI 0.35 to 0.84). Length rate in tertiles divided by length at birth in tertiles was related to asthma symptoms (OR 1.68, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.37). Most other assessments were not associated with asthma. CONCLUSION: These results show promising but inconclusive evidence that a rapid rate of growth in length, especially in newborn infants of low length, might be involved in the aetiology of asthma.",M2
15978929,"Incidence, 30-day case-fatality rate, and prognosis of stroke in Iquique, Chile: a 2-year community-based prospective study (PISCIS project).BACKGROUND: The epidemiology of stroke in Latin-American populations and variation of subtypes between communities are unclear. Our aim was to ascertain prospectively the incidence of first-ever stroke in the predominantly Hispanic-Mestizo population of Iquique, a city in the northern desert region of Chile. METHODS: We prospectively identified all possible cases of stroke and transient ischaemic attacks between July 1, 2000, and June 30, 2002, from several overlapping sources. Patients were rapidly assessed by two field neurologists. Standard definitions for incident cases, stroke, transient ischaemic attack, pathological type, and infarction subtype were used. All cases identified were adjudicated by at least two stroke neurologists and followed up at 6 months. Incidence rates of first-ever strokes were calculated from the population of Iquique (214 526) according to the national census of 2002. FINDINGS: Of 380 cases of stroke identified, 292 were incident. CT scans were done in 267 (91%) patients and the mean time to scan was 2.2 days. The hospital admission rate was 71% (207/292). The overall age-adjusted incidence rate of first-ever stroke was 140.1 per 100,000 (95% <e>CI</e> 124.0-156.2). The incidence rates per 100,000 according to pathological type were: infarcts 87.3, intracerebral haemorrhage 27.6, and subarachnoid haemorrhage 6.2. The 30 day and 6-month case-fatality rates were 23.3% and 33.0%, respectively. INTERPRETATION: Our results show incidence rates of stroke similar to those reported in other community studies. Although the proportion of intracerebral haemorrhages was higher than reported in previous studies, the overall incidence was not, which could indicate a slightly lower incidence of ischaemic strokes in this population than in other countries. The prognosis was similar to that found in other population-based studies.",M2
15974847,"Association of interleukin-1 polymorphisms with periodontal disease.BACKGROUND: Several studies have investigated genetic polymorphisms for cytokines as potential genetic markers for periodontitis. Some studies have found that interleukin (IL)-1A and IL-1B polymorphisms are associated with a higher severity of periodontitis, while others found no association. The aims of this study were to determine the prevalence of the IL-1A-889 and IL-1B+3954 (previously described as +3953) polymorphisms in Chileans and their association with periodontitis. METHODS: Subjects aged 20 to 48 were selected from people requesting dental treatment at a public health center in Santiago, Chile. A case-control study of 330 cases of periodontitis patients and 101 healthy controls was performed. A full-mouth periodontal examination was performed on each subject and a structured questionnaire was conducted to determine smoking habits. Cases were categorized as having initial, moderate, or severe periodontitis according to the percentage of sites with clinical attachment loss &gt; or =3 mm. Genomic DNA was analyzed for polymorphism in the IL-1A gene at site -889 and IL-1B gene at site +3954 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. Data were analyzed by chi square test, analysis of variance (ANOVA), and by calculating odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>). RESULTS: Demographic and socio-economic characteristics of subjects were similar in cases and in controls. A higher frequency of heterozygous of the IL-1A-889 was found in cases than in controls, but the difference was not significant. The heterozygous of the IL-1B+3954 was significantly higher in cases than in controls and was associated with periodontitis (OR 3.12, 95% CI 1.59 to 6.09, P = 0.001). The homozygous for allele 1 of the IL-1B+3954 was a protective factor for periodontitis (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.19 to 0.66, P = 0.001). The prevalence of positive genotype (at least one allele 2 present at each locus) was significantly higher in cases (26.06%) than in controls (9.9%) and was significantly associated with periodontitis (OR 3.21, 95% CI 1.60 to 6.44, P = 0.001), irrespective of the smoking status and periodontitis severity. Sensitivity of positive genotype was 26%, the specificity 90%, and the positive predictive value 89%. CONCLUSION: Within the limits of this study, the results show that individuals carrying the positive genotype have significantly greater risk for developing periodontitis.",M2
15970977,"[Prevalence of latex hypersensitivity in operating room workers of the University of Chile Clinical Hospital]BACKGROUND: Health care workers (HCW) are a high risk group for developing natural rubber latex (NRL) hypersensitivity and allergy. Some studies showed a correlation between time and frequency of exposure to NRL gloves and hypersensitivity, but a recent meta-analysis showed no clear evidences for such assumption. AIM: To determine the prevalence of NRL hypersensitivity and allergy in a group of HCW at the University of Chile Clinical Hospital. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ninety five HCW (aged 37+/-10 years, 59 females) were interviewed about time of exposure, atopic diseases and latex-related allergy symptoms. Different NRL extracts and seven NRL gloves brands were tested by the prick test method. RESULTS: Twenty four workers (25%, 95% <e>CI</e> = 16.9%-35.2%) were sensitized. No gender differences were found. No symptomatic cases were found in the sensitized group. In the workplace, six and two non sensitized subjects had respiratory symptoms or contact urticaria, respectively. Sensitivity to bananas, avocadoes, kiwi and chestnut was not significantly more common among latex sensitive individuals. No differences between sensitized and non sensitized subjects were observed for the presence of atopic diseases or the mean number of years at the workplace. The sensitization rate to NRL increased along with years of work, from 18.6% in patients working less than 10 years, to 28.1% in the group between 10 and 20 years and to 35% in those working more than 21 years (p=0.693). Sensitization was also related to the weekly hours of exposure: 1-10 hours, 17%; 11-20 hours, 23.5%; 21-30 hours, 50% and 31-40 hours, 28.5% (p=0.036). CONCLUSIONS: Sensitization increased proportionally to the years and weekly hours wearing NLR gloves. We did not find symptomatic patients in the sensitized group.",M2
15953955,"[Influence of Mapuche origin and socioeconomic conditions on adult height]BACKGROUND: Studies in Chilean adults of low socioeconomic level suggest that their low height is likely to be due to their indigenous background. However this group also has been marginalized from socioeconomic development. AIM: To determine the influence of Mapuche ethnic origin and socioeconomic factors on the height of adults. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: In a cross sectional design, the height of 1,293 adults (528 males and 765 females) of Mapuche and non Mapuche origin were studied in the Araucania Region (Southern Chile) and in the Metropolitan Region (Central Chile). Subjects with Mapuche surnames were considered as pertaining to this ethnic community and those with Spanish surnames were considered as non Mapuche. Linear regression models were done, stratifying by sex, considering ethnic origin, to live in counties of different social vulnerability, and the level of family poverty. RESULTS: Among males, the mean height was 166.6+/-7.3 cm and among females, the figure was 153.6+/-5.9 cm. Mapuche subjects were significantly shorter: -3.2 cm (95% Confidence Interval (<e>CI</e>) -4.0 to -2.3) among females and -4.8 cm (CI -6.0 to -3.6) among males (non adjusted models). This deficit increased to -4.5 and -7.6 cm among females and males, respectively when they lived in poverty and in areas with highest social vulnerability. These differences decreased significantly if Mapuche subjects lived in communities with low social vulnerability and less poverty (-0.59 and -1.14 cm among females and males respectively). CONCLUSIONS: The studied population had low height, being lower in Mapuche subjects. The differences decreased among subjects living in counties of less vulnerability and less family poverty.",M2
15953947,"[Frequency and characteristics of aspirin resistance in Chilean cardiovascular patients]BACKGROUND: Studies performed in Anglo-Saxon countries show that 5% of patients are resistant to the antiplatelet effects of aspirin. AIM: To assess the prevalence of aspirin resistance in a sample of Chilean cardiovascular patients and its association with clinical and laboratory characteristics. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Ninety nine patients (30 women, 63+/-10 years) treated for stable cardiovascular diseases with aspirin 100-325 mg/day were studied. Clinical and basic coagulation variables were assessed. Platelet aggregation was studied with platelet rich plasma using three different agonists in an optical aggregometer. Aspirin resistance was defined as an aggregation 20% with arachidonic acid and an aggregation 70% with ADP or collagen. RESULTS: Eleven patients (11.11%, 95% <e>CI</e>= 4.95-17.27%) complied with both criteria and were classified as aspirin resistant. Current smoking was more common in aspirin resistant patients (63.6 vs 29.6%, p=0.039). CONCLUSIONS: Aspirin resistance was found in a significant proportion of cardiovascular patients and was more common among current smokers.",M2
15880184,"[Seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) infection in two clinics for sexually transmitted diseases in Santiago, Chile]BACKGROUND: Genital herpes, a sexually transmitted disease caused by herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2), is found in 3.8% of all sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in Chile. AIM: To determine the seroprevalence of herpes simplex virus type 2 (HSV-2) and to identify an association between HSV-2 and HIV-1, other STD, and to study its demographic characteristics. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional study at two STD public clinics in Santiago was conducted among 200 consecutive patients. Samples were tested for HSV-2, HIV-1, syphilis and hepatitis B virus surface antigen. RESULTS: The seroprevalence for HSV-2 was 43%. Four patients had a history of genital herpes. There was a strong association between HSV-2 infection and HIV-1 positivity (OR=8.7, 95% <e>CI</e> 3.4-22.4, p &lt;0.001) and the condition of being a sexual worker (OR=4.5, 95% CI 1.7-11.9, p &lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The high association with HIV-1 and sexual workers, emphasizes the need of having HSV-2 specific diagnostic tests, counseling on sign and symptom recognition and taking preventive measures.",M2
15824747,"Is there a causal relation between obesity and asthma? Evidence from Chile.OBJECTIVE: An association between obesity and asthma symptoms has been reported in the literature, but such a relationship is inconsistent if atopic status or bronchial hyper responsiveness (BHR) is considered. The objective was to assess the association between obesity and asthma symptoms or BHR in adults. METHODS: A study was carried out in 1232 people born between 1974 and 1978 in Chile. The participants completed the European Community Health Survey questionnaire, were skin tested and subject to a BHR challenge to methacholine. MEASUREMENTS: Weight, height and waist circumference were measured and body mass index (BMI) was calculated. RESULTS: There was a positive association between wheeze and breathlessness following exercise and BMI (both with an OR 1.03, 95% <e>CI</e> 1.00-1.06), the associations with wheeze tended to disappear in women who did react at least to one allergen, and persisted in those who did not react to any allergens. BMI was negatively associated with BHR (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.89-0.97). Waist circumference was not associated with asthma symptoms and it was negatively associated with BHR. CONCLUSION: Although there was an association between BMI and asthma symptoms, there were weaknesses in the evidence because waist circumference, a more direct measure of obesity than BMI, was not associated with asthma symptoms, and BMI and waist circumference were negatively associated with BHR.",M2
15661598,"Adolescent pregnancy prevention: An abstinence-centered randomized controlled intervention in a Chilean public high school.PURPOSE: To evaluate the efficacy of an abstinence-centered sex education program in adolescent pregnancy prevention, the TeenSTAR Program was applied in a high school in Santiago, Chile. METHODS: A total of 1259 girls from a Santiago high school were divided into three cohorts depending on the year they started high school: the 1996 cohort of 425 students, which received no intervention; the 1997 cohort, in which 210 students received an intervention and 213 (control group) did not; and the 1998 cohort, in which 328 students received an intervention and 83 (control group) did not. Students were randomly assigned to control and intervention groups in these cohorts, before starting with the program. We conducted a prospective, randomized study using the application of the TeenSTAR sex education program during the first year of high school to the intervention groups in the 1997 and 1998 cohorts. All cohorts were followed up for 4 years; pregnancy rates were recorded and subsequently contrasted in the intervention and control groups. Pregnancy rates were measured and Risk Ratio with 95% confidence interval were calculated for intervention and control groups in each cohort. RESULTS: Pregnancy rates for the intervention and control groups in the 1997 cohort were 3.3% and 18.9%, respectively (RR: 0.176, <e>CI</e>: 0.076-0.408). Pregnancy rates for the intervention and control groups in the 1998 cohort were 4.4% and 22.6%, respectively (RR 0.195, CI: 0.099-0.384). CONCLUSIONS: The abstinence-centered TeenSTAR sex education intervention was effective in the prevention of unintended adolescent pregnancy.",M2
15633328,"Association of interleukin-1 polymorphisms with aggressive periodontitis.BACKGROUND: Genetic polymorphisms for interleukin (IL)-1alpha and -1beta have been proposed as potential genetic markers for periodontal diseases. Since the prevalence of these polymorphisms could be race-related, and no data exist about the frequency of these polymorphisms in the Chilean population, the aim of the current study was to investigate the association of the interleukin-1 gene polymorphisms with aggressive periodontitis (AgP). METHODS: Thirty-six patients with AgP, 75 healthy controls, and 75 subjects of unknown periodontal status (reference population) were genotyped for the IL-1A -889 and IL-1B +3954 loci, by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification followed by restriction enzyme digestion and gel electrophoresis. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test, calculating odds ratios (OR) and confidence intervals (<e>CI</e>). RESULTS: The prevalence of the positive composite IL-1 genotype was higher in patients (25%) than in healthy controls (12%), but the difference was not significant (P= 0.14). The IL-1B +3954 homozygous for allele 1 frequency was higher in controls than in patients suggesting a protective factor for AgP. The heterozygous for allele 2 of the IL- 1B showed a significant association with AgP (OR = 2.86, 95% CI 1.06 to 7.71, P= 0.030). No association was observed in localized AgP and generalized AgP between the extent of disease and the presence of the composite positive genotype. Because the number of smokers was too small in patients and in controls, no other analyses were performed. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study support a positive association between AgP and the presence of the IL-1B +3954 allele 2 polymorphism.",M2
15598792,"Population-based prevalence and age distribution of human papillomavirus among women in Santiago, Chile.More than 18 types of human papillomavirus (HPV) are associated with cervical cancer, the relative importance of the HPV types may vary in different populations.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the types of HPV, age distribution, and risk factors for HPV infection in women from Santiago, Chile.METHODS: We interviewed and obtained two cervical specimens from a population-based random sample of 1,038 sexually active women (age range, 15-69 years). Specimens were tested for the presence of HPV DNA using a GP5+/6+ primer-mediated PCR and for cervical cytologic abnormalities by Papanicolaou smears.RESULTS: 122 women tested positive for HPV DNA, 87 with high risk types (HR), and 35 with low risks (LR) only. Standardized prevalence of HPV DNA was 14.0% [95% confidence interval (95% <e>CI</e>), 11.5-16.4]. HR HPV by age showed a J reverse curve, whereas LR HPV showed a U curve, both statistically significant in comparison with no effect or with a linear effect. We found 34 HPV types (13 HR and 21 LR); HPV 16, 56, 31, 58, 59, 18, and 52 accounted for 75.4% of HR infections. Thirty-four (3.6%) women had cytologic lesions. Main risk factor for HPV and for cytologic abnormalities was number of lifetime sexual partners, odds ratios for &gt; or =3 versus 1 were 2.8 (95% CI, 1.6-5.0) and 3.8 (95% CI, 1.3-11.4), respectively.CONCLUSIONS: LR HPV presented a clear bimodal age pattern; HR HPV presented a J reverse curve. HPV prevalence was similar to that described in most Latin American countries.",M2
15449553,"[Smoking habit in school age children, in Chile]BACKGROUND: In Chile, there is no information about the prevalence of smoking among basic and high school students. AIM: To study the prevalence of smoking among school age population. MATERAL AND METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted during 2001, assessing tobacco use and smoking habit in a representative sample of 15,119 randomly selected students. RESULTS: Sixty four percent of students had smoked at least once in their lifetime. Eighteen percent of students smoked daily and 15%, occasionally. The figures for women were higher (19 and 18% respectively). The mean age for the first contact with smoking was 12.3 years and, for starting the smoking habit, 13.2 years. Smokers increased the amount of cigarettes during weekends. Higher prevalence rates of smoking were observed in students from the Southern region of the country and of lower socioeconomic levels. From the 3rd grade on, there is an increased risk of having contact with tobacco and smoking for the first time and from 6th grade on, this risk becomes permanent. The adjusted Odds Ratio to be a smoker is significantly higher when the mother is a current or irregular smoker (OR 1.9 95 <e>CI</e>; 1.7-2.0). CONCLUSIONS: High smoking prevalence rates were detected in this survey, mainly in women. The risk for smoking starts early during school life. Therefore, health promotion programs must include elementary and high school students.",M2
15382519,"[Validation of a screening test for age associated cognitive impairment, in Chile]BACKGROUND: The real prevalence of dementia in a given population must be determined through prevalence studies, using validated screening tests. AIM: To validate and determine cutoff points for a cognitive impairment screening test composed by the Folstein Mini Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Pfeffer Functional Activities Questionnaire (PFAQ). MATERIAL AND METHODS: Validation of the diagnostic test in a sample of 100 subjects over 65 years old (85 from the project  Age associated dementias  and 15 with a confirmed diagnosis of dementia). All were subjected to a complete neuropsychological test by a trained neurologist, that constituted the  gold standard  for the diagnosis of dementia. An independent interviewer applied the MMSE to the subjects and the PFAQ to a next of kin informer. Cutoff points were calculated using ROC curves. The points with the better equilibrium between sensitivity and specificity were selected, considering differences in results between groups with low and high educational level. RESULTS: The cutoff point for MMSE was 21/22, with a sensitivity of 93.6% (95% <e>CI</e> 70.6-99.7%) and a specificity of 46.1% (95% CI 34.7-57.8%). The figure for PFAQ was 5/6, with a sensitivity of 89.2% (95% CI 70.6-99.7%) and a specificity of 70.7% (95% CI 58.9-80.3%). The combination of both instruments gave a sensitivity of 94.4% (95% CI 58.9-80.3%) and a specificity of 83.3% (95% CI 72.3-90.7%). CONCLUSIONS: This screening test, using MMSE and PFAQ, has a good sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of dementia in Chile. Being simple and of low cost, it can be applied in primary health care.",M2
15478293,"[Maternal obesity and reproductive risk]BACKGROUND: The prevalence of obesity in school children and pregnant women, a known risk factor of the reproductive cycle, has increased significantly over the last few years. AIM: To analyze the association between maternal obesity and the outcome of pregnancy and newborn health. To quantify the attributable population risk of obesity in relation to negative events of pregnancy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A prospective study in 883 pregnant women of 6 public health centers in Santiago. Weight, height, arm circumference, skinfold thicknesses, body mass index (BMI) and fat mass were determined in each trimester. Maternal socio demographic history, smoking habits, incidence of diseases during pregnancy, labor and newborn characteristics were analyzed. Logistic regressions of multiple factors were used to determine nutritional and non-nutritional variables associated to negative events, to determine the population attributable risk of each variable that the model retained. RESULTS: Controlling the effect of other variables, a BMI &gt; or = 30 or initial body fat mass &gt; or = 35% determined a greater risk for assisted labor with an odds ratio (OR) of 1.9 (95% confidence interval (<e>CI</e>) 1.3-2.9), gestational diabetes with an OR of 6.4 (95% CI 2.1-19.6), hypertension with an OR of 7.8 (95% CI 3.0-20.4), late fetal mortality with an OR of 3.4 (95% CI 1.2-10.0), p &lt; 0.001. The risk was mostly associated with the initial maternal nutritional status and in a lesser degree, with the weight gained during pregnancy. CONCLUSIONS: Maternal obesity is an important risk factor during pregnancy. The prenatal control obesity could reduce approximately 10% of the cesarean sections and late fetal deaths and half of the hypertension and gestational diabetes cases.",M2
