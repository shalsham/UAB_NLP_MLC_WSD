20548978,"Effect of perioperative glucose-insulin-<e>potassium</e> infusions on mortality and atrial fibrillation after coronary artery bypass grafting: a systematic review and meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Glucose-insulin infusions (with potassium [GIK] or without [GI]) have been advocated in the setting of coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery to optimize myocardial glucose use and to minimize ischemic injury.OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis assessing whether the use of GIKGI infusions perioperatively reduce in-hospital mortality or atrial fibrillation (AF) after CABG surgery.METHODS: Electronic databases (Medline, EMBASE and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL]) and references of retrieved articles were searched for randomized controlled trials that evaluated the effects of GIK or GI infusions, before or during CABG surgery, on in-hospital mortality andor postoperative AF. Pooled ORs and 95% CIs were calculated for each outcome.RESULTS: Twenty trials were identified and eligible for review. The summary OR for in-hospital mortality was 0.88 (95% CI 0.56 to 1.40), based on 44 deaths among 2326 patients. While postoperative AF was a more frequent outcome (occurring in 519 of 1540 patients in the 10 trials reporting this outcome), the overall pooled estimate of effect was nonsignificant (OR 0.79, 95% CI 0.54 to 1.15). This latter finding needs to be interpreted cautiously because it is accompanied by significant heterogeneity across trials.CONCLUSIONS: Perioperative use of GIKGI does not significantly reduce mortality or atrial fibrillation in patients undergoing CABG surgery. Unless future trial data in support of GIKGI infusions become available, the routine use of these treatments in patients undergoing CABG surgery should be discouraged because the safety of these infusions has not been systematically examined.",M1
20543823,"Activity-dependent relocation of the axon initial segment fine-tunes neuronal excitability.In neurons, the axon initial segment (AIS) is a specialized region near the start of the axon that is the site of action potential initiation. The precise location of the AIS varies across and within different neuronal types, and has been linked to cells' information-processing capabilities; however, the factors determining AIS position in individual neurons remain unknown. Here we show that changes in electrical activity can alter the location of the AIS. In dissociated hippocampal cultures, chronic depolarization with high extracellular <e>potassium</e> moves multiple components of the AIS, including voltage-gated sodium channels, up to 17 mum away from the soma of excitatory neurons. This movement reverses when neurons are returned to non-depolarized conditions, and depends on the activation of T- and/or L-type voltage-gated calcium channels. The AIS also moved distally when we combined long-term LED (light-emitting diode) photostimulation with sparse neuronal expression of the light-activated cation channel channelrhodopsin-2; here, burst patterning of activity was successful where regular stimulation at the same frequency failed. Furthermore, changes in AIS position correlate with alterations in current thresholds for action potential spiking. Our results show that neurons can regulate the position of an entire subcellular structure according to their ongoing levels and patterns of electrical activity. This novel form of activity-dependent plasticity may fine-tune neuronal excitability during development.",M1
20539177,"<e>Potassium</e> in hemorrhagic shock: a potential marker of tissue hypoxia.BACKGROUND: This study was designed to evaluate serum potassium level variation in a porcine model of hemorrhagic shock (HS). METHODS: Eight pigs were studied in a controlled hemorrhage model of HS. Blood withdrawal began at a 50 mL/min to 70 mL/min rate, adjusted to reach a mean arterial pressure (MAP) level of 60 mm Hg in 10 minutes. When MAP reached 60 mm Hg, the blood withdrawal rate was adjusted to maintain a MAP decrease rate of 10 mm Hg every 2 minutes to 4 minutes. Arterial and mixed venous blood samples were collected at MAP levels of 60 mm Hg, 50 mm Hg, 40 mm Hg, 30 mm Hg, 20 mm Hg, and 10 mm Hg and analyzed for oxygen saturation, Po2, Pco2, potassium, lactate, bicarbonate, hemoglobin, pH, and standard base excess. RESULTS: Significant increase in serum potassium occurred early in all animals. The rate of rise in serum potassium and its levels accompanied the hemodynamic deterioration. Hyperkalemia (K &gt;5 mmol/L) incidence was 12.5% at 60 mm Hg and 50 mm Hg, 62.5% at 40 mm Hg, 87.5% at 30 mm Hg, and 100% at 20 mm Hg. Strong correlations were found between potassium levels and lactate (R = 0.82), SvO2 (R = 0.87), DeltapH (R = 0.83), and DeltaPco2 (R = 0.82). CONCLUSIONS: Serum potassium increase accompanies the onset of HS. The rise in serum potassium was directly related to the hemodynamic deterioration of HS and strongly correlated with markers of tissue hypoxia.",M1
20494058,"Resuscitation after prolonged cardiac arrest: role of cardiopulmonary bypass and systemic hyperkalemia.BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to determine (1) the role of emergency cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) after prolonged cardiac arrest and failed cardiopulmonary resuscitation, and (2) the use of systemic hyperkalemia during CPB to convert intractable ventricular fibrillation (VF). METHODS: Thirty-one pigs (34 +/- 2 kg) underwent 15 minutes of cardiac arrest after induced VF, followed by 10 minutes of cardiopulmonary resuscitation-advanced life support. Peripheral CPB was used if cardiopulmonary resuscitation failed to restore stable circulation. Damage was assessed by evaluating hemodynamics, biochemical variables (creatine kinase-MB, neuron-specific enolase), neurologic deficit score, and brain magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: Cardiopulmonary resuscitation alone was successful in only 19% (6 of 31 pigs). Cardiopulmonary bypass was initiated in 81% of animals (25 of 31 pigs) either for hypotension (5 of 25 pigs) or intractable VF (20 of 25 pigs). Defibrillation was successful in 7 of 20 animals during the first 10 minutes after initiating CPB. Ventricular fibrillation persisted more than 10 minutes in 13 of 20 pigs, and animals were treated either with repeated defibrillation (6 of 13 pigs) or with a <e>potassium</e> bolus (7 of 13 pigs) to induce transient cardiac arrest. Overall survival at 24 hours was 84% with cardiopulmonary resuscitation (100% of pigs with hypotension; 71% in CPB-VF &lt; 10 minutes). Despite CPB, fatal myocardial failure occurred after VF duration of more than 10 minutes in all pigs treated with electrical defibrillation, whereas hyperkalemia allowed 100% cardioversion and 86% survival. Biochemical variables remained elevated in all groups. Similarly, severe brain injury was present in all animals as confirmed by neurologic deficit score (197 +/- 10) and magnetic resonance imaging. CONCLUSIONS: Emergency CPB after prolonged cardiac arrest improves survival and allows systemic hyperkalemia to convert intractable VF, but fails to reduce neurologic damage.",M1
20483947,"Spironolactone use and renal toxicity: population based longitudinal analysis.OBJECTIVE: To determine the safety of spironolactone prescribing in the setting of the UK National Health Service. DESIGN: Population based longitudinal analysis using a record linkage database. SETTING: Tayside, Scotland. Population All patients who received one or more dispensed prescriptions for spironolactone between 1994 and 2007. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Rates of prescribing for spironolactone, hospital admissions for hyperkalaemia, and hyperkalaemia and renal function without admission, before and after the publication of results from the Randomised Aldactone Evaluation Study (RALES). RESULTS: Prescriptions for spironolactone and measurements of serum creatinine and serum <e>potassium</e> all increased in parallel in Tayside after the release of the RALES results in 1999 (from 2847, 5345, and 5246 in the first half of 1999 to 6582, 10,753, and 10,534 by the second half of 2001, and to 8619, 17,844, and 17,649 by 2007). These increases occurred in patients with and without heart failure. Few hospital admissions for hyperkalaemia occurred over this time: three in the first quarter of 1995, two in the last quarter of 2001, and three in 2007. Among patients who were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors and who had recently been admitted to hospital for heart failure, the rate of spironolactone use was 19.8 per 100 patients in early 1999 rising to 70.1 per 100 patients by late 2001 (P&lt;0.01) and 61.3 by 2007. The rate of outpatient measured hyperkalaemia (serum K(+)&gt;6 mmol/l) did not increase over time (9.9 per 100 patients in early 1999, 6.9 per 100 patients in late 2001, and 2.9 per 100 patients in 2007) despite the increased use of spironolactone. CONCLUSIONS: Despite a marked increased in the use of spironolactone in patients with and without heart failure, no increase was seen in hospital admissions for hyperkalaemia and outpatient hyperkalaemia actually fell. Careful monitoring of patients prescribed spironolactone seems to have been associated with no increase in risk of hyperkalaemia.",M1
20463214,"High firing rate of neonatal hippocampal interneurons is caused by attenuation of afterhyperpolarizing <e>potassium</e> currents by tonically active kainate receptors.In the neonatal hippocampus, the activity of interneurons shapes early network bursts that are important for the establishment of neuronal connectivity. However, mechanisms controlling the firing of immature interneurons remain elusive. We now show that the spontaneous firing rate of CA3 stratum lucidum interneurons markedly decreases during early postnatal development because of changes in the properties of GluK1 (formerly known as GluR5) subunit-containing kainate receptors (KARs). In the neonate, activation of KARs by ambient glutamate exerts a tonic inhibition of the medium-duration afterhyperpolarization (mAHP) by a G-protein-dependent mechanism, permitting a high interneuronal firing rate. During development, the amplitude of the apamine-sensitive K+ currents responsible for the mAHP increases dramatically because of decoupling between KAR activation and mAHP modulation, leading to decreased interneuronal firing. The developmental shift in the KAR function and its consequences on interneuronal activity are likely to have a fundamental role in the maturation of the synchronous neuronal oscillations typical for adult hippocampal circuitry.",M1
20444939,"Adiponectin modulates excitability of rat paraventricular nucleus neurons by differential modulation of <e>potassium</e> currents.The adipocyte-derived hormone adiponectin acts at two seven-transmembrane domain receptors, adiponectin receptor 1 and adiponectin receptor 2, present in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus to regulate neuronal excitability and endocrine function. Adiponectin depolarizes rat parvocellular preautonomic neurons that secrete either thyrotropin releasing hormone or oxytocin and parvocellular neuroendocrine corticotropin releasing hormone neurons, leading to an increase in plasma adrenocorticotropin hormone concentrations while also hyperpolarizing a subgroup of neurons. In the present study, we investigate the ionic mechanisms responsible for these changes in excitability in parvocellular paraventricular nucleus neurons. Patch clamp recordings of currents elicited from slow voltage ramps and voltage steps indicate that adiponectin inhibits noninactivating delayed rectifier potassium current (I(K)) in a majority of neurons. This inhibition produced a broadening of the action potential in cells that depolarized in the presence of adiponectin. The depolarizing effects of adiponectin were abolished in cells pretreated with tetraethyl ammonium (0/15 cells depolarize). Slow voltage ramps performed during adiponectin-induced hyperpolarization indicate the activation of voltage-independent potassium current. These hyperpolarizing responses were abolished in the presence of glibenclamide [an ATP-sensitive potassium (K(ATP)) channel blocker] (0/12 cells hyperpolarize). The results presented in this study suggest that adiponectin controls neuronal excitability through the modulation of different potassium conductances, effects which contribute to changes in excitability and action potential profiles responsible for peptidergic release into the circulation.",M1
20432725,"[Effect of ascorbic acid on the intestinal transport of glycine in chick]The effect of different doses of ascorbic acid on the absorptive functions of the gut has been investigated in chicks. The study describes evidence for the existence of a H+/glycine symport system in chick intestinal brush border, because in sodium-free conditions acidification of the apical medium with ascorbic acid causes a dose-dependent stimulation of glycine absorption. Under the above circumstances, <e>potassium</e> acts as a non-essential activator of H+-dependence glycine cotransport. Our results also suggest that glycine uptake is stimulated in a lesser degree by inward sodium gradient. Ascorbic acid stimulation of glycine uptake from K+- free sodium abundant media was diminished, when the dietary level of ascorbic acid was increased to 2000 mg in 1 kg of food. This may result from conformational change in the Na(-)-dependent glycine transporter protein that lowers glycine binding site affinity induced by the over-acidification of the gut lumen. In addition, there was a possible competition between sodium-dependent glycine and ascorbic acid transporters for sodium.",M1
20427672,"Type 4 phosphodiesterase plays different integrating roles in different cellular domains in pyramidal cortical neurons.We investigated the role of phosphodiesterases (PDEs) in the integration of cAMP signals and protein kinase A (PKA) activity following beta-adrenergic stimulation, by carrying out real-time imaging of male mouse pyramidal cortical neurons expressing biosensors to monitor cAMP levels (Epac1-camps and Epac2-camps300) or PKA activity (AKAR2). In the soma, isoproterenol (ISO) increased the PKA signal to approximately half the maximal response obtained with forskolin, with a characteristic beta(1) pharmacology and an EC(50) of 4.5 nm. This response was related to free cAMP levels in the submicromolar range. The specific type 4 PDE (PDE4) inhibitor rolipram had a very small effect alone, but strongly potentiated the PKA response to ISO. Blockers of other PDEs had no effect. PDE4 thus acts as a brake in the propagation of the beta(1)-adrenergic signal from the membrane to the bulk somatic cytosol. The results for a submembrane domain were markedly different, whether recorded with a PKA-sensitive <e>potassium</e> current related to the slow AHP or by two-photon imaging of small distal dendrites. The responses to ISO were stronger than in the bulk cytosol. This is consistent with the cAMP/PKA signal being strong at the membrane, as shown by electrophysiology, and favored in cellular domains with a high surface area to volume ratio, in which this signal was detected by imaging. Rolipram alone also produced a strong cAMP/PKA signal, revealing tonic cAMP production. PDE4 thus appears as a crucial integrator with different physiological implications in different subcellular domains.",M1
20412803,"Regulation of Trk-dependent <e>potassium</e> transport by the calcineurin pathway involves the Hal5 kinase.The phosphatase calcineurin and the kinases Hal4/Hal5 regulate high-affinity potassium uptake in Saccharomyces cerevisiae through the Trk1 transporter. We demonstrate that calcineurin is necessary for high-affinity potassium uptake even in the absence of Na(+) stress. HAL5 expression is induced in response to stress in a calcineurin-dependent manner through a newly identified functional CDRE (nt -195/-189). Lack of calcineurin decreases Hal5 protein levels, although with little effect on Trk1 amounts. However, the growth defect of cnb1 cells at K(+)-limiting conditions can be rescued in part by overexpression of HAL5, and this mutation further aggravates the potassium requirements of a hal4 strain. This suggests that the control exerted by calcineurin on Hal5 expression may be biologically relevant for Trk1 regulation.",M1
20412800,"K+ transport characteristics of the plasma membrane tandem-pore channel TPK4 and pore chimeras with its vacuolar homologs.Vacuolar tandem-pore channels could not be analysed in Xenopus oocytes so far, due to misguided translocation. Owing to the conservation of their pore regions, we were able to prepare functional pore-chimeras between the plasma membrane localised TPK4 and vacuolar TPKs. Thereby, we found evidence that TPK2, TPK3 and TPK5, just like TPK4, form <e>potassium</e>-selective channels with instantaneous current kinetics. Homology modelling and mutational analyses identified a pore-located aspartate residue (Asp110), which is involved in potassium permeation as well as in inward rectification of TPK4. Furthermore, dominant-negative mutations in the selectivity filter of either pore one or two (Asp86,Asp200) rendered TPK4 non-functional. This observation supports the notion that the functional TPK4 channel complex is formed by two subunits.",M1
20409481,"Single-molecule TPM studies on the conversion of human telomeric DNA.Human telomere contains guanine-rich (G-rich) tandem repeats of single-stranded DNA sequences at its 3' tail. The G-rich sequences can be folded into various secondary structures, termed G-quadruplexes (G4s), by Hoogsteen basepairing in the presence of monovalent cations (such as Na+ and K+). We developed a single-molecule tethered particle motion (TPM) method to investigate the unfolding process of G4s in the human telomeric sequence AGGG(TTAGGG)3 in real time. The TPM method monitors the DNA tether length change caused by formation of the G4, thus allowing the unfolding process and structural conversion to be monitored at the single-molecule level. In the presence of its antisense sequence, the folded G4 structure can be disrupted and converted to the unfolded conformation, with apparent unfolding time constants of 82 s and 3152 s. We also observed that the stability of the G4 is greatly affected by different monovalent cations. The folding equilibrium constant of G4 is strongly dependent on the salt concentration, ranging from 1.75 at 5 mM Na+ to 3.40 at 15 mM Na+. Earlier spectral studies of Na+- and K+-folded states suggested that the spectral conversion between these two different folded structures may go through a structurally unfolded intermediate state. However, our single-molecule TPM experiments did not detect any totally unfolded intermediate within our experimental resolution when sodium-folded G4 DNA molecules were titrated with high-concentration, excess <e>potassium</e> ions. This observation suggests that a totally unfolding pathway is likely not the major pathway for spectral conversion on the timescale of minutes, and that interconversion among folded states can be achieved by the loop rearrangement. This study also demonstrates that TPM experiments can be used to study conformational changes in single-stranded DNA molecules.",M1
20401399,"The application of stop-flow microwave technology to scaling-out SNAr reactions using a soluble organic base.A model S(N)Ar reaction which gives a range of substituted diaryl ethers has been re-developed to function with the soluble organic base DBU in the place of insoluble <e>potassium</e> carbonate. Manufacture of these diaryl ethers has then been achieved by scaling-out in an automated stop-flow microwave reactor to give productivities of &gt;0.5 kg per day. Analogous reaction partners have also been scaled up in this reactor to extend the scope of the study. Brief comparison in a scale-up batch microwave reactor is also made. Lastly, continuous 24 h processing is reported in this small microwave stop-flow reactor, which requires no manual intervention once started.",M1
20400944,"Native GABA(B) receptors are heteromultimers with a family of auxiliary subunits.GABA(B) receptors are the G-protein-coupled receptors for gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain. They are expressed in almost all neurons of the brain, where they regulate synaptic transmission and signal propagation by controlling the activity of voltage-gated calcium (Ca(v)) and inward-rectifier <e>potassium</e> (K(ir)) channels. Molecular cloning revealed that functional GABA(B) receptors are formed by the heteromeric assembly of GABA(B1) with GABA(B2) subunits. However, cloned GABA(B(1,2)) receptors failed to reproduce the functional diversity observed with native GABA(B) receptors. Here we show by functional proteomics that GABA(B) receptors in the brain are high-molecular-mass complexes of GABA(B1), GABA(B2) and members of a subfamily of the KCTD (potassium channel tetramerization domain-containing) proteins. KCTD proteins 8, 12, 12b and 16 show distinct expression profiles in the brain and associate tightly with the carboxy terminus of GABA(B2) as tetramers. This co-assembly changes the properties of the GABA(B(1,2)) core receptor: the KCTD proteins increase agonist potency and markedly alter the G-protein signalling of the receptors by accelerating onset and promoting desensitization in a KCTD-subtype-specific manner. Taken together, our results establish the KCTD proteins as auxiliary subunits of GABA(B) receptors that determine the pharmacology and kinetics of the receptor response.",M1

20393194,"Molecular background of leak K+ currents: two-pore domain <e>potassium</e> channels.Two-pore domain K(+) (K(2P)) channels give rise to leak (also called background) K(+) currents. The well-known role of background K(+) currents is to stabilize the negative resting membrane potential and counterbalance depolarization. However, it has become apparent in the past decade (during the detailed examination of the cloned and corresponding native K(2P) channel types) that this primary hyperpolarizing action is not performed passively. The K(2P) channels are regulated by a wide variety of voltage-independent factors. Basic physicochemical parameters (e.g., pH, temperature, membrane stretch) and also several intracellular signaling pathways substantially and specifically modulate the different members of the six K(2P) channel subfamilies (TWIK, TREK, TASK, TALK, THIK, and TRESK). The deep implication in diverse physiological processes, the circumscribed expression pattern of the different channels, and the interesting pharmacological profile brought the K(2P) channel family into the spotlight. In this review, we focus on the physiological roles of K(2P) channels in the most extensively investigated cell types, with special emphasis on the molecular mechanisms of channel regulation.",M1
20392959,"Changes in membrane excitability and <e>potassium</e> currents in sensitized dorsal horn neurons of mice pups.Rationally, an increased intrinsic excitability of dorsal horn neurons could be a factor contributing to alter the gain of the nociceptive system during central sensitization, however direct evidence is scarce. Here we have examined this hypothesis using current and voltage-clamp recordings from dorsal horn neurons in the spinal cord in vitro preparation obtained from mice pups of either sex. Cords were extracted from carrageenan-pretreated and control animals to allow for comparison. Dorsal horn neurons from treated animals showed significantly larger and faster synaptic responses. Synaptic changes started developing shortly after inflammation (1 h) and developed further after a longer-term inflammation (20 h). However, these neurons showed biphasic changes in membrane excitability with an increase shortly after inflammation and a decrease in the longer term. Concomitant changes were observed in transient (I(A)) and sustained potassium currents (I(DR)). Prolonged superfusion of naive spinal cords with NMDA led to a decreased neuronal excitability and to increased potassium currents. Results suggest that excitability plays a role more complex than expected during the process of central sensitization of dorsal horn neurons and that modulation of potassium currents may contribute to shape the changing states of excitability. The decreased excitability observed after long-term inflammation is interpreted as a homeostatic correction to an abnormal state of synaptic activity.",M1
20392804,"Detrusor overactivity is associated with downregulation of large-conductance calcium- and voltage-activated <e>potassium</e> channel protein.Large-conductance voltage- and calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels have been shown to play a role in detrusor overactivity (DO). The goal of this study was to determine whether bladder outlet obstruction-induced DO is associated with downregulation of BK channels and whether BK channels affect myosin light chain 20 (MLC(20)) phosphorylation in detrusor smooth muscle (DSM). Partial bladder outlet obstruction (PBOO) was surgically induced in male New Zealand White rabbits. The rabbit PBOO model shows decreased voided volumes and increased voiding frequency. DSM from PBOO rabbits also show enhanced spontaneous contractions compared with control. Both BK channel alpha- and beta-subunits were significantly decreased in DSM from PBOO rabbits. Immunostaining shows BKbeta mainly expressed in DSM, and its expression is much less in PBOO DSM compared with control DSM. Furthermore, a translational study was performed to see whether the finding discovered in the animal model can be translated to human patients. The urodynamic study demonstrates several overactive DSM contractions during the urine-filling stage in benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) patients with DO, while DSM is very quiet in BPH patients without DO. DSM biopsies revealed significantly less BK channel expression at both mRNA and protein levels. The degree of downregulation of the BK beta-subunit was greater than that of the BK alpha-subunit, and the downregulation of BK was only associated with DO, not BPH. Finally, the small interference (si) RNA-mediated downregulation of the BK beta-subunit was employed to study the effect of BK depletion on MLC(20) phosphorylation. siRNA-mediated BK channel reduction was associated with an increased MLC(20) phosphorylation level in cultured DSM cells. In summary, PBOO-induced DO is associated with downregulation of BK channel expression in the rabbit model, and this finding can be translated to human BPH patients with DO. Furthermore, downregulation of the BK channel may contribute to DO by increasing the basal level of MLC(20) phosphorylation.",M1
20382953,"Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis with KCNJ2 mutations: a novel mutation in the pore selectivity filter residue.Andersen cardiodysrhythmic periodic paralysis or Andersen-Tawil syndrome includes the distinct clinical features of periodic paralysis, cardiac arrhythmia, and facial and skeletal dysmorphisms and exhibits autosomal dominant inheritance. Mutations in the KCNJ2 gene, which encodes the human inward rectifier <e>potassium</e> channel Kir2.1, have been identified in the majority of cases. Despite well-established clinical and molecular characteristics, treatment is still case oriented, and timely diagnosis could be delayed because of the low incidence and phenotypic heterogeneity of this disease. This article describes the clinical and molecular features of 3 cases of Andersen-Tawil syndrome in 2 families. One of the mutations (G144D) was located in the pore selectivity filter residue (which is mutated recurrently) and was considered novel.

20380432,"Tetrahydrochromenoimidazoles as <e>potassium</e>-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs): structure-activity relationship of their antisecretory properties and their affinity toward the hERG channel.Potassium-competitive acid blockers (P-CABs) constitute a new therapeutic option for the treatment of acid-related diseases that are widespread and constitute a significant economical burden. Enantiomerically pure tetrahydrochromenoimidazoles were prepared using the readily available candidate 4 (BYK 405879) as starting material or the Noyori asymmetric reduction of ketones as key reaction. A comprehensive SAR regarding the influence of the 5-carboxamide and the 8-aryl residue on in vitro activity, acid-suppression in the Ghosh Schild rat, and affinity toward the hERG channel was established. In addition, efficacy and duration of the antisecretory action was examined for the most promising target compounds by 24 h pH-metry in the fistula dog and a significantly different SAR was observed as compared to the Ghosh Schild rat. Several tetrahydrochromenoimidazoles were identified that possessed a comparable profile as the candidate 4.",M1
20375644,"[Diagnostic usefulness of the random urine Na/K ratio in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a pilot study]BACKGROUND/AIMS: Twenty-four hour urinary sodium excretion (24-h UNa) of greater than 78 mmol/day is important in the management of cirrhotic ascites. Although the random urine sodium-to-<e>potassium</e> ratio (UNa/K) is strongly correlated with 24-h UNa, and approximately 95% of patients with a random UNa/K greater than 1 have 24-h UNa greater than 78 mmol, few data have been published on the correlation between 24-h UNa and random UNa/K. We evaluated diagnostic value of morning and afternoon random UNa/K (AM UNa/K and PM UNa/K, respectively) with 24-h UNa. METHODS: A total of 42 male patients were enrolled from October 2007 to March 2008. Each patient collected 5 mL of urine twice at random times during 24-h urine collection (at 10-12 a.m. and 3-5 p.m.). ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the feasibility of AM and PM UNa/K for differentiating 24-h UNa greater than 78 mmol/day. RESULTS: Forty patients with a 24-h urinary creatinine of greater than 15 mg/kg were analyzed. The 24-h UNa, AM UNa/K, and PM UNa/K were 107.9+/-91.2 mmol (mean+/-SD), 3.44+/-3.64, and 3.97+/-4.60, respectively. When compared with 24-h UNa greater than 78 mmol, AUROC values for AM and PM UNa/K were 0.861 (95% CI, 0.715-0.950) and 0.929 (95% CI, 0.802-0.986), respectively (P=0.0001). No difference was found between the AUROC for AM and PM UNa/K (95% CI, -0.161-0.153, P=0.113). UNa/K greater than 1.25 was sensitive and specific for prediction of 24-h UNa greater than 78 mmol. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that anytime random UNa/K greater than 1.25 is an accurate, cost-effective, and convenient method for replacing 24-h UNa. Large multicentered cohort studies are needed to confirm our results.",M1
20375276,"Ceramide modulates HERG <e>potassium</e> channel gating by translocation into lipid rafts.Human ether-à-go-go-related gene (HERG) potassium channels play an important role in cardiac action potential repolarization, and HERG dysfunction can cause cardiac arrhythmias. However, recent evidence suggests a role for HERG in the proliferation and progression of multiple types of cancers, making it an attractive target for cancer therapy. Ceramide is an important second messenger of the sphingolipid family, which due to its proapoptotic properties has shown promising results in animal models as an anticancer agent. Yet the acute effects of ceramide on HERG potassium channels are not known. In the present study we examined the effects of cell-permeable C(6)-ceramide on HERG potassium channels stably expressed in HEK-293 cells. C(6)-ceramide (10 microM) reversibly inhibited HERG channel current (I(HERG)) by 36 +/- 5%. Kinetically, ceramide induced a significant hyperpolarizing shift in the current-voltage relationship (DeltaV(1/2) = -8 +/- 0.5 mV) and increased the deactivation rate (43 +/- 3% for tau(fast) and 51 +/- 3% for tau(slow)). Mechanistically, ceramide recruited HERG channels within caveolin-enriched lipid rafts. Cholesterol depletion and repletion experiments and mathematical modeling studies confirmed that inhibition and gating effects are mediated by separate mechanisms. The ceramide-induced hyperpolarizing gating shift (raft mediated) could offset the impact of inhibition (raft independent) during cardiac action potential repolarization, so together they may nullify any negative impact on cardiac rhythm. Our results provide new insights into the effects of C(6)-ceramide on HERG channels and suggest that C(6)-ceramide can be a promising therapeutic for cancers that overexpress HERG.",M1

Only PK reduced (P&lt;0.05) all bacterial types evaluated. The PN treatment remained (P&lt;0.05) redder (a*), contained more (P&lt;0.05) oxymyoglobin and had less (P&lt;0.05) discoloration than CON by days 3-7 of display.

20371222,"Triuret as a potential hypokalemic agent: Structure characterization of triuret and triuret-alkali metal adducts by mass spectrometric techniques.Triuret (also known as carbonyldiurea, dicarbamylurea, or 2,4-diimidotricarbonic diamide) is a byproduct of purine degradation in living organisms. An abundant triuret precursor is uric acid, whose level is altered in multiple metabolic pathologies. Triuret can be generated via urate oxidation by peroxynitrite, the latter being produced by the reaction of nitric oxide radical with superoxide radical anion. From this standpoint, an excess production of superoxide radical anions could indirectly favor triuret formation; however very little is known about the potential in vivo roles of this metabolite. Triuret's structure is suggestive of its ability to adopt various conformations and act as a flexible ligand for metal ions. In the current study, HPLC-MS/MS, energy-resolved mass spectrometry, selected ion monitoring, collision-induced dissociation, IRMPD spectroscopy, Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and computational methods were employed to characterize the structure of triuret and its metal complexes, to determine the triuret-alkali metal binding motif, and to evaluate triuret affinity toward alkali metal ions, as well as its affinity for Na(+) and K(+) relative to other organic ligands. The most favored binding motif was determined to be a bidentate chelation of triuret with the alkali metal cation involving two carbonyl oxygens. Using the complexation selectivity method, it was observed that in solution triuret has an increased affinity for <e>potassium</e> ions, compared to sodium and other alkali metal ions. We propose that triuret may act as a potential hypokalemic agent under pathophysiological conditions conducive to its excessive formation and thus contribute to electrolyte disorders. The collision- or photo-induced fragmentation channels of deprotonated and protonated triuret, as well as its alkali metal adducts, are likely to mimic the triuret degradation pathways in vivo.",M1
20357183,"Normal targeting of a tagged Kv1.5 channel acutely transfected into fresh adult cardiac myocytes by a biolistic method.The transfection of cardiac myocytes is difficult, and so most of the data regarding the regulation of trafficking and targeting of cardiac ion channels have been obtained using heterologous expression systems. Here we apply the fast biolistic transfection procedure to adult cardiomyocytes to show that biolistically introduced exogenous voltage-gated <e>potassium</e> channel, Kv1.5, is functional and, like endogenous Kv1.5, localizes to the intercalated disc, where it is expressed at the surface of that structure. Transfection efficiency averages 28.2 +/- 5.7% of surviving myocytes at 24 h postbombardment. Ventricular myocytes transfected with a tagged Kv1.5 exhibit an increased sustained current component that is approximately 40% sensitive to 100 microM 4-aminopyridine and which is absent in myocytes transfected with a fluorescent protein-encoding construct alone. Kv1.5 deletion mutations known to reduce the surface expression of the channel in heterologous cells similarly reduce the surface expression in transfected ventricular myocytes, although targeting to the intercalated disc per se is generally unaffected by both NH(2)- and COOH-terminal deletion mutants. Expressed current levels in wild-type Kv1.5, Kv1.5DeltaSH3(1), Kv1.5DeltaN209, and Kv1.5DeltaN135 mutants were well correlated with apparent surface expression of the channel at the intercalated disc. Our results conclusively demonstrate functionality of channels present at the intercalated disc in native myocytes and identify determinants of trafficking and surface targeting in intact cells. Clearly, biolistic transfection of adult cardiac myocytes will be a valuable method to study the regulation of surface expression of channels in their native environment.",M1
20355110,"Capsaicin accumulation is related to nitrate content in placentas of habanero peppers (Capsicum chinense Jacq.).BACKGROUND: The presence of capsaicin, the pungent principle of peppers, is restricted to the fruits of hot cultivars. This compound, which is produced in the fruits' placenta, requires 3 mol of nitrogen to be formed. Hence nitrogen availability may affect pepper pungency through its content in the fruit tissues. On the other hand, <e>potassium</e> may also affect pepper pungency given its positive effect on fruit development. In order to address this issue, plants of habanero pepper (Capsicum chinense Jacq.) were hydroponically cultured with various doses of nitrate and potassium and the contents of these ions and capsaicin were analyzed in the different fruit tissues. RESULTS: Treatments did not produce major effects on pod yield or size during the experimental period, and pepper pods from plants growing under low nitrate concentrations presented no significant differences in total nitrate content. However, lower nitrate, as well as low capsaicin contents, were found in the isolated placentas from peppers grown on the lowest nitrate doses. Variations in potassium availability resulted in differences in pod production per plant, but not in capsaicinoid accumulation. CONCLUSION: Under the assayed conditions, nitrate content in the placenta affects capsaicin synthesis.",M1
20352375,"The effects of copper (II) ions on Enterococcus hirae cell growth and the proton-translocating FoF1 ATPase activity.Enterococcus hirae grow well under anaerobic conditions at alkaline pH (pH 8.0) producing acids by glucose fermentation. Bacterial growth was shown to be accompanied by decrease of redox potential from positive values (approximately +35 mV) to negative ones (approximately -220 mV). An oxidizer copper (II) ions (Cu(2+)) affected bacterial growth in a concentration-dependent manner (within the range of 0.05 mM to 1 mM) increasing lag phase duration and decreasing specific growth rate. These effects were observed with the wild-type strain ATCC9790 and the atpD mutant strain MS116 (with absent beta subunit of F(1) of the F(o)F(1) ATPase) both. Also ATPase activity and proton-<e>potassium</e> ions exchange were assessed with and without N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCCD), inhibitor of the F(o)F(1) ATPase. In both cases (DCCD +/-), even low Cu(2+) concentrations had noticeable effect on ATPase activity, but with less visible concentration-dependent manner. Changes in the number of accessible SH-groups were observed with E. hirae ATCC9790 and MS116 membrane vesicles. In both strains Cu(2+) markedly decreased the number of SH-groups in the presence of K(+) ions. The addition of ATP increased the amount of accessible SH-groups in ATCC9790 and decreased this number in MS116; Cu(2+) blocked ATP-installed increase in SH-groups number in ATCC9790. H(+)-K(+)-exchange of bacteria was markedly inhibited by Cu(2+), but stronger effects were detected together with DCCD. Moreover, discrimination between Cu(2+) and other bivalent cation--Ni(2+) was shown. It is suggested that Cu(2+) ions inhibit E. hirae cell growth by direct affect on the F(o)F(1) ATPase leading to conformational changes in this protein complex and decrease in its activity.",M1
20351263,"A rice high-affinity <e>potassium</e> transporter (HKT) conceals a calcium-permeable cation channel.Plant high-affinity K(+) transport (HKT) proteins are so named because of their relation to bacterial and fungal transporters that mediate high-affinity K(+) uptake. The view that HKT family members are sodium-selective uniporters or sodium-potassium symporters is widely held. We have found that one of the rice HKT proteins also functions as a Ca(2+)-permeable cation channel that conducts current carried by a wide range of monovalent and divalent cations. The HKT rice gene, named OsHKT2;4, is expressed in several cell types, including root hairs and vascular parenchyma cells. The protein is localized to the plasma membrane, thereby providing a mechanism for cation uptake and extrusion. This finding goes against firmly entrenched dogma in showing that HKT proteins can function as both ion carriers and channels. The study further extends the function of HKT proteins to Ca(2+)-linked processes and, in so doing, defines a previously undescribed type of Ca(2+)-permeable cation channels in plants. The work also raises questions about the evolutionary changes in this protein family following the divergence of monocots and dicots.",M1
20351106,"Separate gating mechanisms mediate the regulation of K2P <e>potassium</e> channel TASK-2 by intra- and extracellular pH.TASK-2 (KCNK5 or K(2P)5.1) is a background K(+) channel that is opened by extracellular alkalinization and plays a role in renal bicarbonate reabsorption and central chemoreception. Here, we demonstrate that in addition to its regulation by extracellular protons (pH(o)) TASK-2 is gated open by intracellular alkalinization. The following pieces of evidence suggest that the gating process controlled by intracellular pH (pH(i)) is independent from that under the command of pH(o). It was not possible to overcome closure by extracellular acidification by means of intracellular alkalinization. The mutant TASK-2-R224A that lacks sensitivity to pH(o) had normal pH(i)-dependent gating. Increasing extracellular K(+) concentration acid shifts pH(o) activity curve of TASK-2 yet did not affect pH(i) gating of TASK-2. pH(o) modulation of TASK-2 is voltage-dependent, whereas pH(i) gating was not altered by membrane potential. These results suggest that pH(o), which controls a selectivity filter external gate, and pH(i) act at different gating processes to open and close TASK-2 channels. We speculate that pH(i) regulates an inner gate. We demonstrate that neutralization of a lysine residue (Lys(245)) located at the C-terminal end of transmembrane domain 4 by mutation to alanine abolishes gating by pH(i). We postulate that this lysine acts as an intracellular pH sensor as its mutation to histidine acid-shifts the pH(i)-dependence curve of TASK-2 as expected from its lower pK(a). We conclude that intracellular pH, together with pH(o), is a critical determinant of TASK-2 activity and therefore of its physiological function.",M1
20349709,"[Nutrient uptake characteristics of nitrogen, phosphorus and <e>potassium</e> of Pinellia ternate from Sichuan during growth stage]OBJECTIVE: To study the absorption characteristics of nitrogen (N) , phosphorus (P) , and potassium (K) of Pinellia ternate from Sichuan under the cultivated condition. METHOD: The samples of P. ternate S-29 and S-33 from Sichuan were regularly collected randomly, the contents of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium of each part (aerial and underground parts) were determined, and their distribution and accumulation characters of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium were also studied. RESULT: The absorption rate of aerial and underground parts of P. ternate were different in nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium at different growing stages. Among them, the potassium uptake was the highest, while the phosphorus uptake was the lowest. Totally, the uptakes of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium of P. ternate from Sichuan during  sprout tumble  stage were comparatively higher than that not at  sprout tumble  stage. A significant correlation was observed between the phosphorus and potassium uptake of the aerial and underground parts, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). And there was also significant positive correlation between the nitrogen and phosphorus uptake at underground parts (P &lt; 0.05). During the growth stage of P. ternate, for producing 100 kg air-dried P. ternate, 5.02-5.64 kg N, 2.44-2.56 kg P205, 11.62-13.49 kg K20 were needed to be absorbed. CONCLUSION: P. ternate from Sichuan should be given enough base fertilizer in field cultivation, and then be supplied with phosphorus and potassium by combining foliar spray with field application during the middle ten days of June and last ten days of August. The ratios of potassium should be properly improved. There was promoting effect in the phosphorus and nitrogen assimilations of the underground parts of P. ternate from Sichuan.",M1
20349424,"Role of renal sympathetic nervous system in the control of renal <e>potassium</e> handling.BACKGROUND: It is well established that renal sympathetic nerves are primarily involved in renal sodium and water regulation. However, the relationship between renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) and renal potassium handling is not extensively known. The present study was performed to investigate the role of the renal sympathetic nervous system in the regulation of tubular potassium reabsorption and secretion. METHODS: Male Sprague Dawley (SD) rats (each group, n=6) were fasted overnight, anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (60 mg/kg intraperitoneal), denervated by application of phenol to the left renal artery and maintained on an intravenous infusion of saline for 2 hours. During this period, 6 urine and plasma samples were collected at 20-minute intervals to study kidney function parameters. RESULTS: In denervated rats, there were significantly higher (all p&lt;0.05 vs. innervated control) urine flow rate (UFR), glomerular filtration rate (GFR), absolute sodium excretion (U(Na)V), fractional sodium excretion (FE(N)a), absolute potassium excretion (U(K)V), fractional potassium excretion (FE(K)) and urinary sodium to urinary potassium ratio (U(Na)/U(K)). No appreciable differences were seen in the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and plasma sodium (P(Na)) between denervated and innervated SD rats. However, plasma potassium (P(K)) levels were significantly lower (p&lt;0.05) in denervated rats as compared with innervated counterparts. CONCLUSIONS: There is a possible involvement of renal nerves in the regulation of renal potassium handling. This effect is largely attributable to a direct action of renal sympathetic nerves on the renal tubular segments.",M1
20334900,"Accumulation of <e>potassium</e>, rubidium and caesium (133Cs and 137Cs in various fractions of soil and fungi in a Swedish forest.Radiocaesium ((137)Cs) was widely deposited over large areas of forest in Sweden as a result of the Chernobyl accident in 1986 and many people in Sweden eat wild fungi and game obtained from these contaminated forests. In terms of radioisotope accumulation in the food chain, it is well known that fungal sporocarps efficiently accumulate radiocaesium ((137)Cs), as well as the alkali metals potassium (K), rubidium (Rb) and caesium (Cs). The fungi then enhance uptake of these elements into host plants. This study compared the accumulation of these three alkali metals in bulk soil, rhizosphere, soil-root interface, fungal mycelium and sporocarps of mycorrhizal fungi in a Swedish forest. The soil-root interface was found to be distinctly enriched in K and Rb compared with the bulk soil. Potassium concentrations increased in the order: bulk soil&lt;rhizosphere&lt;fungal mycelium&lt;soil-root interface&lt;fungal sporocarps; and Rb concentration in the order: bulk soil&lt;rhizosphere&lt;soil-root interface&lt;fungal mycelium&lt;fungal sporocarps. Caesium was more or less evenly distributed within the bulk soil, rhizosphere and soil-root interface fractions, but was actively accumulated by fungi. Fungi showed a greater preference for Rb and K than Cs, so the uptake of (137)Cs could be prevented by providing additional Rb or K at contaminated sites. The levels of K, Rb, and Cs found in sporocarps were at least one order of magnitude higher than those in fungal mycelium. These results provide new insights into the use of transfer factors or concentration ratios. The final step, the transfer of alkali metals from fungal mycelium to sporocarps, raised some specific questions about possible mechanisms.",M1
20333647,"Role of voltage-gated <e>potassium</e> channels in the fate determination of embryonic stem cells.Embryonic stem cells (ESCs) possess two unique characteristics: self-renewal and pluripotency. In this study, roles of voltage-gated potassium channels (K(v)) in maintaining mouse (m) ESC characteristics were investigated. Tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)), a K(v) blocker, attenuated cell proliferation in a concentration-dependent manner. Possible reasons for this attenuation, including cytotoxicity, cell cycle arrest and differentiation, were examined. Blocking K(v) did not change the viability of mESCs. Interestingly, K(v) inhibition increased the proportion of cells in G(0)/G(1) phase and decreased that in S phase. This change in cell cycle distribution can be attributed to cell cycle arrest or differentiation. Loss of pluripotency as determined at both molecular and functional levels was detected in mESCs with K(v) blockade, indicating that K(v) inhibition in undifferentiated mESCs directs cells to differentiate instead of to self-renew and progress through the cell cycle. Membrane potential measurement revealed that K(v) blockade led to depolarization, consistent with the role of K(v) as the key determinant of membrane potential. The present results suggest that membrane potential changes may act as a  switch  for ESCs to decide whether to proliferate or to differentiate: hyperpolarization at G(1) phase would favor ESCs to enter S phase while depolarization would favor ESCs to differentiate. Consistent with this notion, S-phase-synchronized mESCs were found to be more hyperpolarized than G(0)/G(1)-phase-synchronized mESCs. Moreover, when mESCs differentiated, the differentiation derivatives depolarized at the initial stage of differentiation. This investigation is the first study to provide evidence that K(v) and membrane potential affect the fate determination of ESCs.",M1
20333436,"<e>Potassium</e> and sodium transport in non-animal cells: the Trk/Ktr/HKT transporter family.Bacterial Trk and Ktr, fungal Trk and plant HKT form a family of membrane transporters permeable to K(+) and/or Na(+) and characterized by a common structure probably derived from an ancestral K(+) channel subunit. This transporter family, specific of non-animal cells, displays a large diversity in terms of ionic permeability, affinity and energetic coupling (H(+)-K(+) or Na(+)-K(+) symport, K(+) or Na(+) uniport), which might reflect a high need for adaptation in organisms living in fluctuating or dilute environments. Trk/Ktr/HKT transporters are involved in diverse functions, from K(+) or Na(+) uptake to membrane potential control, adaptation to osmotic or salt stress, or Na(+) recirculation from shoots to roots in plants. Structural analyses of bacterial Ktr point to multimeric structures physically interacting with regulatory subunits. Elucidation of Trk/Ktr/HKT protein structures along with characterization of mutated transporters could highlight functional and evolutionary relationships between ion channels and transporters displaying channel-like features.",M1
20329393,"Dynamics of nitrogen in subtropical wetland and its uptake and storage by Pistia stratiotes.The paper describes the dynamics of nitrogen in different components (water, soil and plants) of Kabar wetland situated in Begusarai district of Bihar. Contents of nitrogen in the natural components were determined and were compared with the rate of uptake and accumulation under the experimental conditions. Physico-chemical characteristics of natural water and of test basins were quite similar. The trend of seasonal variation of NO3(-)-N in water and total N in soil and P. stratiotes tissue was almost similar but content of nitrogen differed significantly in the different components. The accumulation of nitrogen in the tissues of P. stratiotes was 5 to 15 fold higher than the concentration of nitrogen in the water and 2 to 3 fold higher than the nitrogen content measured in the soil. Maximum accumulation of nitrogen in P. stratiotes was 15.25 mg g(-1) when the concentration of NO3(-)-N in water was 0.86 mg l(-1). Under experimental conditions six different nitrogen concentrations were supplied and determined the uptake and accumulation of nitrogen in P. stratiotes. Maximum uptake and accumulation was 82.87 g m(-2) at the end of 60 days after starting the experiment but still the rate of accumulation was in rising trend. In another part of experiment no nitrogen was left in the basins of low concentrations (0.5 and 5 mg N l(-1)) at the end of 60 days of experiment but at higher concentrations (50 and 65 mg N l(-1)) significant amount of N was left in the test basin. The biomass enhancement was parallel with nitrogen supply till 15 mg N l(-1). This was opposite to the relationship between the nitrogen accumulation in the tissues and nitrogen supply in the experimental basins. Though, <e>potassium</e> was added as an essential growth nutrient but its accumulation was 95g m(-2) at 5 mg l(-1).",M1

DESIGN: Prospective, case-controlled, observational study. SETTING: Tertiary-level university teaching hospital in Eastern Finland. PATIENTS: 48 ASA physical status I, II, and III patients, aged 51 to 84 years, 24 of whom were scheduled for hip arthroplasty (12 pts with and 12 without statin therapy) and 24 patients who were to undergo knee arthroplasty (12 pts with and 12 without statin therapy).

MAIN MEASUREMENTS: S-creatine kinase, S-alanine aminotransferase, P-creatinine, S-lactate dehydrogenase, P-<e>potassium</e>, S-myoglobin, and U-myoglobin were measured at baseline and at 6, 24, and 72 hours after surgery. MAIN RESULTS: S-creatine kinase and S-myoglobin increased in all study groups at 6 hours after surgery and remained elevated for 72 hours, with no differences noted in patients treated with or without statins. There was no increase in the amount of muscular or hepatic complaints after surgery. CONCLUSION: Long-term statin therapy does not appear to increase the risk of muscular adverse effects in patients receiving major endoprosthesis surgery.",M1
20299355,"Intercalated cell BK-alpha/beta4 channels modulate sodium and <e>potassium</e> handling during potassium adaptation.The large-conductance, calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels help eliminate potassium in mammals consuming potassium-rich diets. In the distal nephron, principal cells contain BK-alpha/beta1 channels and intercalated cells contain BK-alpha/beta4 channels. We studied whether BK-beta4-deficient mice (Kcnmb4(-/-)) have altered renal sodium and potassium clearances compared with wild-type mice when fed a regular or potassium-rich diet for ten days. We did not detect differences in urinary flow or fractional excretions of potassium (FE(K)) or sodium (FE(Na)) between Kcnmb4-deficient and wild-type mice fed a regular diet. However, a potassium-rich diet led to &gt;4-fold increases in urinary flows for both groups of mice, although Kcnmb4-deficient mice exhibited less urinary flow, higher plasma potassium concentration, more fluid retention, and significantly lower FE(K) and FE(Na) than wild-type mice despite similar plasma aldosterone levels. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased basolateral Na-K-ATPase in principal cells of all potassium-adapted mice, but expression of Na-K-ATPase in intercalated cells was &gt;10-fold lower. The size of intercalated cells reduced and luminal volume increased among potassium-adapted wild-type but not Kcnmb4-deficient mice. Paradoxically, this led to increased urinary fluid velocity in potassium-adapted Kcnmb4-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Taken together, these data suggest that BK-alpha/beta4 channels in intercalated cells reduce cell size, increasing luminal volume to accommodate higher distal flow rates during potassium adaptation. These changes streamline flow across the principal cells, producing gradients more favorable for potassium secretion and less favorable for sodium reabsorption.",M1
20222410,"[Absorption and distribution of nitrogen, phosphorus and <e>potassium</e> in Chrysanthemum morifolium]OBJECTIVE: To study Chrysanthemum morifolium dry matter accumulation and absorption characteristics of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium at different growth stages. METHOD: Through the field experiment and the sampling analysis, the absorbing capacity of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium as well as the growth of plant at different growth stages in Ch. morifolium were analyzed. RESULT: The dry matter accumulation reached 70.4% of the total accumulation within 60-150 days after transplantation. Dry matter mainly distributed in leaf within 60 days after transplantation, the distribution ratio in the stem was higher than that in leaf within 60-150 days after transplantation, the highest distribution ratio was the flower, and the second was the root within 150-210 days after transplantation. The accumulative capacity of N, P and K by Ch. morifolium was lower within 45 days after transplantation, which only accounted for 16.14%, 13.39% and 10.19% of total absorptive capacity, respectively. But it increased rapidly within 45-150 days after transplantation, which accounted for 71.86%, 63.81% and 62.94% respectively. The nitrogen accumulation was slower, while the accumulation of phosphorus and potassium was increased rapidly, within 150-210 days after transplantation. The distribution ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was different within different organs in different growth stages. The distribution ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was mainly distributed in stem and leaf, within 150 days after transplantation, then transferring to the flower and root, the transferring efficiency was N &gt; P &gt; K. CONCLUSION: the absorption capacity of K was the highest, followed by N and P. The N : P205 : K2O ratio was 1 : 0.88 : 1.58. Correlation analysis showed that dry matter accumulation and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium accumulation correlated positively. For producing 1g dry matter, Ch. morifolium needed to absorb 5.198 1 mg N, 4.329 5 mg P205 and 7.138 5 mg K20 from soil and fertilizer.",M1
20220129,"<e>Potassium</e>-activated GTPase reaction in the G Protein-coupled ferrous iron transporter B.FeoB is a prokaryotic membrane protein responsible for the import of ferrous iron (Fe(2+)). A defining feature of FeoB is that it includes an N-terminal 30-kDa soluble domain with GTPase activity, which is required for iron transport. However, the low intrinsic GTP hydrolysis rate of this domain appears to be too slow for FeoB either to function as a channel or to possess an active Fe(2+) membrane transport mechanism. Here, we present crystal structures of the soluble domain of FeoB from Streptococcus thermophilus in complex with GDP and with the GTP analogue derivative 2'-(or -3')-O-(N-methylanthraniloyl)-beta,gamma-imidoguanosine 5'-triphosphate (mant-GMPPNP). Unlike recent structures of the G protein domain, the mant-GMPPNP-bound structure shows clearly resolved, active conformations of the critical Switch motifs. Importantly, biochemical analyses demonstrate that the GTPase activity of FeoB is activated by K(+), which leads to a 20-fold acceleration in its hydrolysis rate. Analysis of the structure identified a conserved asparagine residue likely to be involved in K(+) coordination, and mutation of this residue abolished K(+)-dependent activation. We suggest that this, together with a second asparagine residue that we show is critical for the structure of the Switch I loop, allows the prediction of K(+)-dependent activation in G proteins. In addition, the accelerated hydrolysis rate opens up the possibility that FeoB might indeed function as an active transporter.",M1
20219632,"Distinct signaling pathways of precursor BDNF and mature BDNF in cultured cerebellar granule neurons.Recent studies have focused on a distinctive contrast between bioactivities of precursor brain-derived neurotrophic factor (proBDNF) and mature BDNF (matBDNF). In this study, using a proteolytic cleavage-resistant proBDNF mutant (CR-proBDNF), signaling mechanisms underlying the proapoptotic effect of proBDNF and antiapoptotic effect of matBDNF on the low <e>potassium</e> (LK)-inducing cell death of cultured cerebellar granule neurons (CGNs) were analyzed. A time course study demonstrated that unlike matBDNF, CR-proBDNF failed to induce TrkB phosphorylation for up to 360 min. CR-proBDNF did not activate ERK-1, ERK-2 and Akt, which are involved in TrkB-induced cell survival signaling, while matBDNF activated these kinases. On the other hand treatment of CGNs with CR-proBDNF led to a rapid activation of Rac-GTPase and phosphorylation of JNK which are involved in p75(NTR)-induced apoptosis. In addition, a JNK-specific inhibitor, SP600125, inhibited the CR-proBDNF-induced apoptosis but did not affect the antiapoptotic effect of matBDNF. CR-proBDNF treatment led to an earlier appearance of active caspase-3. In contrast, matBDNF dramatically postponed the appearance of active caspase-3. Not like other signaling molecules, activation of caspase-3 was conversely regulated by both CR-proBDNF and matBDNF. These results thus suggest that in CGNs proBDNF elicits apoptosis via activation of p75(NTR), Rac-GTPase, JNK, and caspase-3, while matBDNF signals cell survival via activation of TrkB, ERKs and Akt, and deactivation of caspase-3.",M1
20217345,"Influence of extracellular [K+]o on inspiratory network complexity of phrenic and hypoglossal nerve discharge in arterially-perfused adult rat.Many in vitro mammalian preparations are used to study multiple aspects of central respiratory control.

20212150,"Structural basis underlying the dual gate properties of KcsA.KcsA is a prokaryotic pH-dependent <e>potassium</e> (K) channel. Its activation, by a decrease in the intracellular pH, is coupled with its subsequent inactivation, but the underlying mechanisms remain elusive. Here, we have investigated the conformational changes and equilibrium of KcsA by using solution NMR spectroscopy. Controlling the temperature and pH of KcsA samples produced three distinct methyl-TROSY and NOESY spectra, corresponding to the resting, activated, and inactivated states. The pH-dependence of the signals from the extracellular side was affected by the mutation of H25 on the intracellular side, indicating the coupled conformational changes of the extracellular and intracellular gates. K(+) titration and NOE experiments revealed that the inactivated state was obtained by the replacement of K(+) with H(2)O, which may interfere with the K(+)-permeation. This structural basis of the activation-coupled inactivation is closely related to the C-type inactivation of other K channels.",M1
20211677,"Mechanism underlying hypokalemia induced by trimethyltin chloride: Inhibition of H+/K+-ATPase in renal intercalated cells.Trimethyltin chloride (TMT), a byproduct of plastic stabilizers, has caused 67 poisoning accidents in the world; more than 98% (1814/1849) of the affected patients since 1998 have been in China. As a long-established toxic chemical, TMT severely affects the limbic system and the cerebellum; however, its relationship with hypokalemia, a condition observed in the majority of the cases in the last decade, remains elusive. To understand the mechanism underlying hypokalemia induced by TMT, Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were administered TMT to determine the relationship between H(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity and the blood and urine K(+) concentration and pH, respectively. H(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein and mRNA were observed too. In vitro changes to intracellular pH, K(+) channels in renal cells were measured. The results showed that TMT increased <e>potassium</e> leakage from the kidney, raised urine pH, and inhibited H(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity both in vitro and in vivo. In the tested animals, H(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity was positively correlated with the decrease of plasma K(+) and blood pH but was negatively correlated with the increase of urine K(+) and urine pH (P&lt;0.01), while TMT did not change the expression of H(+)/K(+)-ATPase protein and mRNA. TMT decreased intracellular pH and opened K(+) channels in renal intercalated cells. Our findings suggest TMT can directly inhibit the activity of H(+)/K(+)-ATPases in renal intercalated cells, reducing urine K(+) reabsorption and inducing hypokalemia.",M1
20185945,"Effect of artificial endolymph injection into the cochlear duct on perilymph <e>potassium</e>.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between endolymphatic hydrops and perilymphatic potassium. METHODS: 20 pigmented guinea pigs were used: 10 for scala vestibuli study and 10 for scala tympani study. Acute endolymphatic hydrops was produced by microinjection of an artificial endolymph into the scala media. Injections were performed in the second turn at rates up to 500 nl/min for a period of 10 min. The injection volume was up to 5 microl. Endocochlear potential (EP) was monitored during injections. Simultaneous with the injections, the potassium concentrations in scala vestibuli (K(SV)) or tympani (K(ST)) perilymph were measured with ion-sensitive double-barreled microelectrodes sealed into in the scalae in the 3rd turn with cyanoacrylate glue. RESULTS: For endolymphatic injections of &lt;or=3 microl, perilymphatic K(SV) and K(ST) changes were generally small. With larger volume injections, substantial increases in both K(ST) and K(SV) were observed, with larger increases observed in K(SV) compared to K(ST). CONCLUSION: An increase of perilymph potassium ion concentration is associated with endolymphatic hydrops and the perilymphatic increase could contribute to the inner ear dysfunction of patients with Ménière's disease. Although mild hydrops may not cause perilymphatic changes, extended hydrops may increase perilymphatic K which could contribute to vertigo and/or hearing loss during the attack.",M1
20205277,"Mechanisms mediating CCK-8S-induced contraction of proximal colon in guinea pigs.AIM: To investigate the effects of sulfated cholecystokinin octapeptide (CCK-8S) on the contractile activity of guinea-pig proximal colon. METHODS: Proximal colonic smooth muscle (PCSM) strips were obtained from adult female guinea pigs and contractile response of PCSM strips was recorded using a polyphysiograph. PCSM cells were isolated by enzymatic digestion. Resting potential (RP), action potential (AP), large conductance <e>potassium</e> channel currents (I(BKCa)) and L-type calcium currents (I(Ca-L)) were recorded by patch-clamp techniques. RESULTS: (1) CCK-8S (10(-7) mol/L) enhanced the mean contractile amplitude of colonic circular muscle and longitudinal muscle (LM) strips by 56.53% + or - 11.92% (P = 0.038) and 65.93% + or - 12.98% (P = 0.019), respectively, as well as the mean frequency of LM by 31.69% + or - 13.58% (P = 0.023), which were significantly attenuated by pretreating strips with devazepide, nifedipine, iberiotoxin, thapsigargin (TG) and BAPTA-AM (BA) respectively; (2) CCK-8S (10(-7) mol/L) increased the AP amplitude by 38.6% + or - 3.2% (P = 0.015), decreased AP duration by 36.9% + or - 8.7% (P = 0.026), and depolarized the RP from -61.3 + or - 2.7 mV to -29.8 + or - 5.9 mV (P = 0.032); and (3) Compared with the normal control group, CCK-8S (10(-7) mol/L) enhanced the peak current of I(BKCa) by 18.7% + or - 2.1% (from 916 + or - 183 pA to 1088 + or - 226 pA; at +60 mV; P = 0.029), which was inhibited by respective pretreatment with iberiotoxin and devazepide. Additionally, CCK-8S (10(-7) mol/L) intensified the peak current of I(Ca-L) by 40% (from 60 + or - 8 pA to 84 + or - 11 pA; at +10 mV; P = 0.012), compared to the normal control group, which was apparently suppressed by respective pretreatment with nifedipine, devazepide, TG and BA. In the respective presence of heparin and staurosporine, CCK-8S did not significantly enhance I(BKCa) and I(Ca-L). CONCLUSION: The results suggest that CCK-8S promotes guinea-pig proximal colon contraction by CCK1 receptors, following activation of the inositol triphosphate-protein kinase C signal transduction pathway.",M1
20204721,"Two-pore domain k(+) channels and their role in chemoreception.A number of tandem P-domain K(+)- channels (K(2)P) generate background K(+)-currents similar to those found in enteroreceptors that sense a diverse range of physiological stimuli including blood pH, carbon dioxide, oxygen, <e>potassium</e> and glucose. This review presents an overview of the properties of both cloned K(2)P tandem-P-domain K-channels and the endogenous chemosensitive background K-currents found in central chemoreceptors, peripheral chemoreceptors, the adrenal gland and the hypothalamus. Although the identity of many of these endogenous channels has yet to be confirmed they show striking similarities to a number of K(2)P channels especially those of the TASK subgroup. Moreover these channels seem often (albeit not exclusively) to be involved in pH and nutrient/metabolic sensing.",M1

20201128,"Hypokalemic periodic paralysis: a case series, review of the literature and update of management.The objective of this study was to present a case series of patients with hypokalemic periodic paralysis. We described all patients with diagnosis of hypokalemic periodic paralysis admitted to the Al Ain Hospital (UAE) during the year 2006. Seventeen patients, all males and mostly Asians, were presented to the Al Ain Hospital over a 12-month period. The majority were admitted during the summer months. Four were thyrotoxic. All of the 17 patients received oral <e>potassium</e> supplements and recovered well without any major complications. In conclusion, clinicians should have a high index of suspicion, especially among Asians presenting with flaccid paralysis and hypokalemia. The main steps in the management include exclusion of other causes of hypokalemia, potassium replacement, hydration and close monitoring of the cardiac rhythm and serum potassium levels. When possible, the underlying cause must be adequately addressed to prevent the persistence or recurrence of paralysis.",M1
20199092,"Ions and hydrogen bonding in a hydrophobic environment: CCl(4).It is generally expected that ions in an aqueous ionic solution in contact with a hydrophobic phase enter the hydrophobic phase accompanied by a hydration shell. This expectation suggests that the ion mole fraction in the hydrophobic phase is less than, or at most, equal to that of water. Both gravimetric and spectroscopic evidence shows that for a model hydrophobic phase, carbon tetrachloride, this is not the case: In contact with a 1 M simple salt solution (sodium or <e>potassium</e> halide), the salt concentration in carbon tetrachloride ranges from 1.4 to nearly 3 times that of water. Infrared spectra of the OH stretch region support a model in which water associates with the cation, primarily as water monomers. Salts containing larger, more polarizable anions can form outer-sphere ion pairs that support water dimers, giving rise to a spectral signature at 3440 cm(-1). In CCl(4), the infrared spectral signature of the normally strongly ionized acid HCl clearly shows the presence of molecular HCl. Additionally, the presence of a Q branch for HCl indicates restricted rotational motion. The spectral and gravimetric data provide compelling evidence for ion clusters in the hydrophobic phase, which is a result that may have implications for hydrophobic matter in both biological and environmental systems.",M1

20185830,"SLC4A11 prevents osmotic imbalance leading to corneal endothelial dystrophy, deafness, and polyuria.Maintenance of ion concentration gradients is essential for the function of many organs, including the kidney, the cornea, and the inner ear. Ion concentrations and fluid content in the cornea are regulated by endothelial cells that separate the collagenous avascular corneal stroma from the anterior eye chamber. Failure to maintain correct ion concentrations leads to swelling and destruction of the cornea. In the inner ear, the stria vascularis is responsible for generating proper ion concentrations in the endolymph, which is essential for hearing. Mutations of SLC4A11 in humans lead to syndromes associated with corneal dystrophy and perceptive deafness. The molecular mechanisms underlying these symptoms are poorly understood, impeding therapeutic interventions. The ion transporter SLC4A11 mediates sodium-dependent transport of borate as well as flux of sodium and hydroxyl ions in vitro. Here, we show that SLC4A11 is expressed in the endothelial cells of the cornea where it prevents severe morphological changes of the cornea caused by increased sodium chloride concentrations in the stroma. In the inner ear, SLC4A11 is located in fibrocytes underlying the stria vascularis. Loss of SLC4A11 leads to morphological changes in the fibrocytes and deafness. We demonstrate that SLC4A11 is essential for the generation of the endocochlear potential but not for regulation of <e>potassium</e> concentrations in the endolymph. In the kidney, SLC4A11 is expressed in the thin descending limb of Henle loop. SLC4A11 is essential for urinary concentration, suggesting that SLC4A11 participates in the countercurrent multiplication that concentrates urine in the kidney medulla.",M1
20185796,"A novel mitochondrial K(ATP) channel assay.RATIONALE: The mitochondrial ATP sensitive <e>potassium</e> channel (mK(ATP)) is implicated in cardioprotection by ischemic preconditioning (IPC), but the molecular identity of the channel remains controversial. The validity of current methods to assay mK(ATP) activity is disputed. OBJECTIVE: We sought to develop novel methods to assay mK(ATP) activity and its regulation. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using a thallium (Tl(+))-sensitive fluorophore, we developed a novel Tl(+) flux based assay for mK(ATP) activity, and used this assay probe several aspects of mK(ATP) function. The following key observations were made. (1) Time-dependent run down of mK(ATP) activity was reversed by phosphatidylinositol-4,5-bisphosphate (PIP(2)). (2) Dose responses of mK(ATP) to nucleotides revealed a UDP EC(50) of approximately 20 micromol/L and an ATP IC(50) of approximately 5 micromol/L. (3) The antidepressant fluoxetine (Prozac) inhibited mK(ATP) (IC(50)=2.4 micromol/L). Fluoxetine also blocked cardioprotection triggered by IPC, but did not block protection triggered by a mK(ATP)-independent stimulus. The related antidepressant zimelidine was without effect on either mK(ATP) or IPC. CONCLUSIONS: The Tl(+) flux mK(ATP) assay was validated by correlation with a classical mK(ATP) channel osmotic swelling assay (R(2)=0.855). The pharmacological profile of mK(ATP) (response to ATP, UDP, PIP(2), and fluoxetine) is consistent with that of an inward rectifying K(+) channel (K(IR)) and is somewhat closer to that of the K(IR)6.2 than the K(IR)6.1 isoform. The effect of fluoxetine on mK(ATP)-dependent cardioprotection has implications for the growing use of antidepressants in patients who may benefit from preconditioning.",M1

The parameters were analyzed using semi-automated clinical chemistry analyzer Microlab 300, microprocessor-controlled analyzer EasyLite and spectrophotometer Genesys 10. Cells were cultured with lead acetate trihydrate [Pb(CH(3)COO)(2).3H(2)O] as follows: group Max (5 mg Pb(CH(3)COO)(2).3H(2)O/10 mL), group A (2.5 mg/10 mL), group B (0.83 mg/10 mL), group C (0.625 mg/10 mL), group D (0.455 mg/10 mL) and the control group without lead exposure for 18 hrs. The highest TAS was estimated in the control group without lead treatment in comparison with other groups (MAX, A, B, C, D). Statistical analyses showed significantly lower value (P &lt; 0.05) in group B. The activity of SOD was the lowest in the control group in comparison to those exposed to in vitro lead culture. A significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) of calcium content in group MAX in comparison with control group was determined. Release of phosphorus by ovarian granulosa cells was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05; 0.01; 0.001) in all the treated groups in comparison with control group. Lead was found to stimulate the release of magnesium and potassium by granulosa cells, but the increase remained statistically insignificant.

No significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were detected in concentration of other studied parameters among observed groups, too.",M1
20132149,"Repolarization of the cardiac action potential. Does an increase in repolarization capacity constitute a new anti-arrhythmic principle?The cardiac action potential can be divided into five distinct phases designated phases 0-4. The exact shape of the action potential comes about primarily as an orchestrated function of ion channels. The present review will give an overview of ion channels involved in generating the cardiac action potential with special emphasis on <e>potassium</e> channels involved in phase 3 repolarization. In humans, these channels are primarily K(v)11.1 (hERG1), K(v)7.1 (KCNQ1) and K(ir)2.1 (KCNJ2) being the responsible alpha-subunits for conducting I(Kr), I(Ks) and I(K1). An account will be given about molecular components, biophysical properties, regulation, interaction with other proteins and involvement in diseases. Both loss and gain of function of these currents are associated with different arrhythmogenic diseases. The second part of this review will therefore elucidate arrhythmias and subsequently focus on newly developed chemical entities having the ability to increase the activity of I(Kr), I(Ks) and I(K1). An evaluation will be given addressing the possibility that this novel class of compounds have the ability to constitute a new anti-arrhythmic principle. Experimental evidence from in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo settings will be included. Furthermore, conceptual differences between the short QT syndrome and I(Kr) activation will be accounted for.",M1
20172287,"Evaluation of hemodynamic, metabolic, and electrolytic changes after graft reperfusion in a porcine model of intestinal transplantation.BACKGROUND: We sought to establish an anesthetic protocol to evaluate the hemodynamic, metabolic, and electrolytic changes after graft reperfusion in pigs undergoing orthotopic intestinal transplant (ITx). METHODS: Fifteen pigs were distributed into two groups: GI (n = 6), without immunosuppression, and GII (n = 9), immunosuppressed before surgery with tacrolimus (0.3 mg/kg). The animals were premedicated at 1 hour before surgery with IM acepromazine (0.1 mg/kg), morphine (0.4 mg/kg), ketamine (10 mg/kg), and atropine (0.044 mg/kg IM). Anesthesia induction used equal proportions of diazepam and ketamine (0.1-0.15 mL/kg/IV) and for maintenance in IV infusion of xylazine (1 mg/mL), ketamine (2 mg/mL), and guaiacol glyceryl ether 5% (50 mg/mL), diluted in 250 mL of 5% glucose solution. In addition, recipient pigs were treated with isofluorane inhalation. Heart rate (HR), systolic (SAP), mean (MAP), and diastolic (DAP) arterial pressure, pulse oximetry, respiratory frequency (f), capnography, body temperature (T), blood gas analysis (pH, Paco(2), Pao(2), base excess, BE; Hco(3)(-), Sato(2)), serum <e>potassium</e> (K), calcium (Ca), sodium, hematocrit (Hct), and glucose (Glu) were measured at four times; M0: after incision (basal value); M1: 10 minutes before reperfusion; and M2 and M3: 10 and 20 minutes after graft reperfusion. RESULTS: All groups behaved in a similar pattern. There was significant hypotension after graft reperfusion in GI and GII (M2 = 56.2 +/- 6.4 and M3 = 57.2 +/- 8.3 mm Hg and M2 = 65.7 +/- 10.2 and M3 = 67.8 +/- 16.8 mm Hg, respectively), accompanied by elevated HR. The ETco(2) was elevated at M2 (42 mm Hg) and M3 (40 mm Hg). Metabolic acidosis was observed after reperfusion, with significant increase in K levels. CONCLUSION: The anesthetic protocol for donors and recipients was safe to perform the procedure, allowing control of hemodynamic and metabolic changes after reperfusion without differences regarding immunosuppression.",M1
20166546,"[Clinical characteristics of five elderly patients with severe hypokalemia induced by glycyrrhizin derivatives]Although hypokalemia is a common clinical problem, symptoms generally do not become manifest unless the serum <e>potassium</e> (K) falls rapidly. We encountered five cases with symptomatic severe hypokalemia (K&lt;2.0 mEq/L) hospitalized for the past 15 months at our hospital. We examined the clinical characteristics and treatment of these patients. All five patients were women, and their mean age was 77.8 (73-82)years. They suffered from hypertension. Mean K level at admission was 1.66 (1.4-1.9) mEq/L and HCO3(-) was 48.3 (33.6-56.1) mmol/L. Plasma aldosterone level was low and plasma rennin activity was suppressed. All patients developed progressive muscle weakness with elevated creatinine phosphokinase. Three of the patients had received Chinese medicine which contained licorice, one received glycyrrhizin and the other one had received both. We diagnosed these cases as pseudoaldosteronism induced by glycyrrhizin. With discontinuation of the drugs and intravenous as well as oral K supplementation, serum K were normalized and clinical symptoms improved within 12 days. For one patient who developed cardiac dysfunction, concentrated K solution (230 mEq/L) was infused into the central vein. These findings show that glycyrrhizin ingestion should be kept in mind as a cause of an extreme degree of an hypokalemia, especially in elderly patients.",M1

A survey was conducted at the Kyoto University experimental farm in Kyoto Prefecture, Japan, and included 9.5 ha of meadow and about 160 head of beef cattle. Forages cultivated on the meadow were ensiled and offered to breeding cows. The whole farm was regarded as a beef-forage production system. The system consisted of three components: animals, manure and soil/crop. Nutrient inputs, flows through the soil-plant-animal pathway and outputs were quantified for 2 periods for the whole farm. Nutrient utilization was evaluated by nutrient balances, utilization efficiencies (ratio of nutrient export to nutrient input) and cycling index. The average nutrient balances of N, P and K for the whole farm (kg/year/ha) were 435.7, 136.3, and 262.8, and the average nutrient utilization efficiencies were 0.08, 0.06, and 0.01, respectively. The characteristics of nutrient balances and utilization efficiencies for each component differed among the nutrients. The average cycling indices for N, P and K were 0.19, 0.17 and 0.49, respectively.

20163190,"The putative Na+/H+ antiporter of Vibrio cholerae, Vc-NhaP2, mediates the specific K+/H+ exchange in vivo.The existence of bacterial K(+)/H(+) antiporters that prevent the overaccumulation of <e>potassium</e> in the cytoplasm was predicted by Peter Mitchell almost 50 years ago. The importance of K(+)/H(+) antiport for bacterial physiology is widely recognized, but its molecular mechanisms remain underinvestigated. Here, we demonstrate that a putative Na(+)/H(+) antiporter, Vc-NhaP2, protects cells of Vibrio cholerae growing at pH 6.0 from high concentrations of external K(+). Resistance of V. cholerae to Na(+) was found to be independent of Vc-NhaP2. When assayed in inside-out membrane vesicles derived from antiporter-deficient Escherichia coli, Vc-NhaP2 catalyzed the electroneutral K(+)(Rb(+))/H(+) exchange with a pH optimum of approximately 7.75 with an apparent K(m) for K(+) of 1.62 mM. In the absence of K(+), it exhibited Na(+)/H(+) antiport, albeit rather weakly. Interestingly, while Vc-NhaP2 cannot exchange Li(+) for protons, elimination of functional Vc-NhaP2 resulted in a significantly higher Li(+) resistance of V. cholerae cells growing at pH 6.0, suggesting the possibility of Vc-NhaP2-mediated Li(+)/K(+) antiport. The peculiar cation specificity of Vc-NhaP2 and the presence of its two additional paralogues in the same genome make this transporter an attractive model for detailed analysis of the structural determinants of the substrate specificity in alkali cation exchangers.",M1
20162834,"Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis in the Chinese population: clinical features in 45 cases.OBJECTIVE: Thyrotoxic periodic paralysis (TPP) occurs predominantly in Asian males, but there are few reports about TPP in the mainland of the People's Republic of China. The purpose of this study was to report the clinical features of cases of TPP in mainland China. METHODS: Forty-five cases of TPP, admitted to Zhongnan Hospital of Wuhan University during a 5-year period, were retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS:Patients typically presented with acute paralysis of the limbs, almost half (48.6%) initiated with legs, while the rest (51.4%) with both arms and legs. Twenty of 45 patients (44.4%) who had been diagnosed with hyperthyroidism suffered sudden attacks, while the remaining 25 patients were newly diagnosed with TPP. 16 patients had low <e>potassium</e> serum concentrations (1.44-3.00 mmol/L). There was a correlation between the lowest muscle strengths of the proximal and distal legs and serum potassium concentrations (Spearman correlation, r=0.556, P=0.049). CONCLUSIONS: TPP is not an uncommon disease in mainland China. Thyrotoxic patients need to improve medication compliance and follow-up. At the time of the TPP attack, a detailed interview and inquiry with a thorough physical examination usually provide clues to the diagnosis. Leg muscle strength evaluation may be useful to assess the severity of hypokalemia.",M1
20162564,"Characterization of a stretch-activated <e>potassium</e> channel in chondrocytes.Chondrocytes possess the capacity to transduce load-induced mechanical stimuli into electrochemical signals. The aim of this study was to functionally characterize an ion channel activated in response to membrane stretch in isolated primary equine chondrocytes. We used patch-clamp electrophysiology to functionally characterize this channel and immunohistochemistry to examine its distribution in articular cartilage. In cell-attached patch experiments, the application of negative pressures to the patch pipette (in the range of 20-200 mmHg) activated ion channel currents in six of seven patches. The mean activated current was 45.9 +/- 1.1 pA (n = 4) at a membrane potential of 33 mV (cell surface area approximately 240 microm(2)). The mean slope conductance of the principal single channels resolved within the total stretch-activated current was 118 +/- 19 pS (n = 6), and reversed near the theoretical potassium equilibrium potential, E(K+), suggesting it was a high-conductance potassium channel. Activation of these high-conductance potassium channels was inhibited by extracellular TEA (K(d) approx. 900 microM) and iberiotoxin (K(d) approx. 40 nM). This suggests that the current was largely carried by BK-like potassium (MaxiK) channels. To further characterize these BK-like channels, we used inside-out patches of chondrocyte membrane: we found these channels to be activated by elevation in bath calcium concentration. Immunohistochemical staining of equine cartilage samples with polyclonal antibodies to the alpha1- and beta1-subunits of the BK channel revealed positive immunoreactivity for both subunits in superficial zone chondrocytes. These experiments support the hypothesis that functional BK channels are present in chondrocytes and may be involved in mechanotransduction and chemotransduction.",M1
20162198,"Synthesis and in situ transformation of PST-1: a <e>potassium</e> gallosilicate natrolite with a high Ga content.The synthetic details of a novel potassium gallosilicate natrolite with Si/Ga = 1.28, denoted PST-1, are described. The presence of K(+) and Ga with well-defined levels of concentration in the synthesis mixture is essential for directing its crystallisation. PST-1 transforms rapidly into TNU-6 under hydrothermal conditions, behaviour that contrasts sharply with its very high thermal and hydrothermal stability, which is unusual for a material of such a high Ga content. These stability issues are discussed and rationalized based on chemical composition, likely violations of Loewenstein's rule and the temperature of dehydration of as-made K-PST-1. The crystal structure of TNU-6 has been resolved through the combined use of synchrotron X-ray and electron diffraction data; it has the BaFeGaO(4) structure type with an additional radical 3a x radical 3a  GeAlO(4)  superstructure that arises from tilting of some of the tetrahedral units in all of the 6-rings.",M1
20157258,"Specific neuromodulatory actions of amyloid-beta on dopamine release in rat nucleus accumbens and caudate putamen.We previously demonstrated that amyloid-beta (Abeta) has a neuromodulatory action in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). In this area of the brain, the peptide disrupts the cholinergic control of dopamine (DA) release both in vivo and in vitro. The aim of the present work was to extend the research on the neuromodulatory effect of Abeta (1-40) on DA transmission to different release stimuli and to another dopaminergic brain area, the caudate putamen (CPu), in order to clarify whether the effect of the peptide is stimulus- or brain area-selective. We performed both in vivo (microdialysis associated to HPLC) and in vitro studies (synaptosomes in superfusion). Both in NAc and in CPu and both in vivo and in vitro, Abeta did not affect either basal or <e>potassium</e>-stimulated DA release. In CPu, the Abeta ability to impair the DA release evoked by the cholinergic agonist carbachol, observed in NAc, was confirmed only in vitro. Moreover, in vitro Abeta affected a specific component of the DA overflow evoked by the non-selective metabotropic glutamate receptors agonist t-ACPD. Altogether, these results show that Abeta may have different neuromodulatory actions depending upon the secretory stimulus and, in vivo, the brain area investigated.",M1

Endocrinologic findings revealed a decrease in the renin-aldosterone system and normal adrenoglucocorticoid function. The results were consistent with the abnormalities seen in selective hypoaldosteronism with low renin activity. In addition, 9 of 11 patients, selected randomly from 72 bedridden elderly patients with normal serum sodium and <e>potassium</e> levels in our hospital, had diminished plasma renin activity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC). The present patient was prescribed nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). NSAID reduces renal potassium excretion through the inhibition of renal prostaglandin synthesis.

20150448,"<e>Potassium</e> homeostasis and renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system inhibitors.Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is a key strategy in treating hypertension and cardiovascular and renal diseases. However, RAAS inhibitors (angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors) increase the risk of hyperkalemia (serum potassium &gt;5.5 mmol/L). This review evaluates the effects on serum potassium levels of RAAS inhibitors. Using PubMed, we searched for clinical trials published up to December 2008 assessing the effects on serum potassium levels of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers, aldosterone receptor antagonists, and direct renin inhibitors, alone and in combination, in patients with hypertension, heart failure (HF), or chronic kidney disease (CKD); 39 studies were identified. In patients with hypertension without risk factors for hyperkalemia, the incidence of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitor monotherapy is low (&lt; or =2%), whereas rates are higher with dual RAAS inhibition ( approximately 5%). The incidence of hyperkalemia is also increased in patients with HF or CKD (5% to 10%). However, increases in serum potassium levels are small ( approximately 0.1 to 0.3 mmol/L), and rates of study discontinuation due to hyperkalemia are low, even in high-risk patient groups (1% to 5%). Patients with HF or CKD are at greater risk of hyperkalemia with RAAS inhibitors than those without these conditions. However, the absolute changes in serum potassium are generally small and unlikely to be clinically significant. Moreover, these patients are likely to derive benefit from RAAS inhibition. Rather than denying them an effective treatment, electrolyte levels should be closely monitored in these patients.",M1
20149860,"In vitro and in vivo haemolytic studies of tentacle-only extract from jellyfish Cyanea capillata.To approach the real haemolytic process of jellyfish toxins, both in vitro and in vivo haemolysis of tentacle-only extract (TOE) from jellyfish Cyanea capillata has been studied. Dose-response curves of the haemolytic activity of TOE in vitro were sigmoid shaped in both erythrocyte suspension and diluted whole blood, with the former more sensitive to TOE. The in vivo haemolysis increased sharply in the first 10 min and was followed by a gradual increase in the following 3h, with increasing blood <e>potassium</e> and lactic acid accordingly. SC5b-9 complexes were significantly up-regulated in vitro, but not in vivo. These results showed that the haemolysis of TOE in diluted whole blood and in vivo is not totally consistent with that in the erythrocyte suspension, and blood plasma might play a protective role against haemolysis. Thus we suggested that erythrocyte suspension can be used to test the damage of toxin on erythrocyte membrane, while the diluted whole blood may be more suitable to test the haemolysis of toxins.",M1

20146837,"Relationship of soybean aphid (Hemiptera: Aphididae) to soybean plant nutrients, landscape structure, and natural enemies.In the north central United States, populations of the exotic soybean aphid, Aphis glycines Matsumura (Hemiptera: Aphididae), are highly variable across space, complicating effective aphid management. In this study we examined relationships of plant nutrients, landscape structure, and natural enemies with soybean aphid abundance across Iowa, Michigan, Minnesota, and Wisconsin, representing the range of conditions where soybean aphid outbreaks have occurred since its introduction. We sampled soybean aphid and its natural enemies, quantified vegetation land cover and measured soybean nutrients (<e>potassium</e> [K] and nitrogen [N]) in 26 soybean sites in 2005 and 2006. Multiple regression models found that aphid abundance was negatively associated with leaf K content in 2005, whereas it was negatively associated with habitat diversity (Simpson's index) and positively associated with leaf N content in 2006. These variables accounted for 25 and 27% of aphid variability in 2005 and 2006, respectively, suggesting that other sources of variability are also important. In addition, K content of soybean plants decreased with increasing prevalence of corn-soybean cropland in 2005, suggesting that landscapes that have a high intensification of agriculture (as indexed by increasing corn and soybean) are more likely to have higher aphid numbers. Soybean aphid natural enemies, 26 species of predators and parasitoids, was positively related to aphid abundance; however, enemy-to-aphid abundance ratios were inversely related to aphid density, suggesting that soybean aphids are able to escape control by resident natural enemies. Overall, soybean aphid abundance was most associated with soybean leaf chemistry and landscape heterogeneity. Agronomic options that can ameliorate K deficiency and maintaining heterogeneity in the landscape may reduce aphid risk.",M1
20144697,"Role for ionic fluxes on cell death and apoptotic volume decrease in cultured cerebellar granule neurons.Recent evidence suggests a major role for ionic fluxes in apoptotic cell death and apoptotic volume decrease. Cerebellar granule neurons (CGN) undergo apoptosis when they are treated with staurosporine or camptothecin (CPT) or when cells are transferred from high extracellular <e>potassium</e> (25 mM KCl [K(+)](e), K25) to low potassium concentration (5 mM KCl [K(+)](e), K5). In this study we described that all three apoptotic conditions induced apoptotic volume decrease in CGN and that two different potassium channel blockers, cesium (Cs(+)) and tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)), prevented the apoptotic volume decrease, caspase-3 activation, nuclear condensation and cell death induced by K5 and CPT, but not by staurosporine. Cs(+) and TEA(+) also blocked membrane currents generated in K5 conditions in CGN. On the other hand, non specific Cl(-) channel blockers such as 4,4'-diisothiocyanato-stilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid (DIDS) prevented loss of cell volume induced by K5 or staurosporine. Only the Cl(-) channels blocker but not the K(+) channels blockers protected from staurosporine-induced death of CGN. These data suggest that ionic fluxes play a key role in the activation of the apoptotic volume decrease and apoptotic death of CGN, but the fine mechanism seems to depend on the apoptotic condition.",M1
20144338,"A physiological model of the effect of hypoglycemia on plasma <e>potassium</e>.BACKGROUND: Adrenaline release and excess insulin during hypoglycemia stimulate the uptake of potassium from the bloodstream, causing low plasma potassium (hypokalemia). Hypokalemia has a profound effect on the heart and is associated with an increased risk of malignant cardiac arrhythmias. It is the aim of this study to develop a physiological model of potassium changes during hypoglycemia to better understand the effect of hypoglycemia on plasma potassium. METHOD: Potassium counterregulation to hypokalemia was modeled as a linear function dependent on the absolute potassium level. An insulin-induced uptake of potassium was modeled using a negative exponential function, and an adrenaline-induced uptake of potassium was modeled as a linear function. Functional expressions for the three components were found using published data. RESULTS: The performance of the model was evaluated by simulating plasma potassium from three published studies. Simulations were done using measured levels of adrenaline and insulin. The mean root mean squared error (RMSE) of simulating plasma potassium from the three studies was 0.09 mmol/liter, and the mean normalized RMSE was 14%. The mean difference between nadirs in simulated and measured potassium was 0.12 mmol/liter. CONCLUSIONS: The presented model simulated plasma potassium with good accuracy in a wide range of clinical settings. The limited number of hypoglycemic episodes in the test set necessitates further tests to substantiate the ability of the model to simulate potassium during hypoglycemia. In conclusion, the model is a good first step toward better understanding of changes in plasma potassium during hypoglycemia.",M1
20144151,"[Morphology of acute myocardial infarction at prenecrotic stage]We studied morphological changes of myocardium and content of glucose, <e>potassium</e>, calcium, sodium in pericardial fluid in persons who died suddenly of myocardial infarction at its prenecrotic stage at prehospital phase. It was established that acute myocardial infarction at prenecrotic stage can run in 2 morphological forms - either with transmural or with subendo- or epicardial localization of ischemic process in left ventricular wall. Transmural injury is characterized by large volume of ischemic damage of the left ventricle, generalized spasm of arterial system of the heart, changes of cardiomyocytes with derangement of their energy metabolism and contractile capacity. In subendo- or epicardial localization foci of ischemic injury alternated with areas of normal blood supply. Similar character of disturbances of rheological properties of blood with thrombosis of microcirculatory bed and of number of markers of ventricular fibrillation between these two forms create preconditions for increase of the zone of necrosis in myocardium and cause high risk of development of rhythm disorders.",M1

The nutrients including silicates, sulphates, phosphates, nitrates and potassium are in sufficient quantities for the growth of aquatic plants and animals in the reservoir. In all 13 species of macrophytes were recorded from the reservoir. Macrophytic diversity was higher at the points where nallahas join the reservoir and in the areas where agricultural practices are performed. This was due to allocthonous nutrients brought into the reservoir from the surrounding catchments area. The above study indicated that the Ramsagar reservoir is under the category of mesotrophic water body slightly inclined towards eutrophication. Therefore, the conservation and management of this water body are very much required.",M1
20143237,"Colonic <e>potassium</e> handling.Homeostatic control of plasma K+ is a necessary physiological function. The daily dietary K+ intake of approximately 100 mmol is excreted predominantly by the distal tubules of the kidney. About 10% of the ingested K+ is excreted via the intestine. K+ handling in both organs is specifically regulated by hormones and adapts readily to changes in dietary K+ intake, aldosterone and multiple local paracrine agonists. In chronic renal insufficiency, colonic K+ secretion is greatly enhanced and becomes an important accessory K+ excretory pathway. During severe diarrheal diseases of different causes, intestinal K+ losses caused by activated ion secretion may become life threatening. This topical review provides an update of the molecular mechanisms and the regulation of mammalian colonic K+ absorption and secretion. It is motivated by recent results, which have identified the K+ secretory ion channel in the apical membrane of distal colonic enterocytes. The directed focus therefore covers the role of the apical Ca2+ and cAMP-activated BK channel (KCa1.1) as the apparently only secretory K+ channel in the distal colon.",M1
20133899,"Extracellular K+ is a prerequisite for the function and plasma membrane stability of HERG channels.RATIONALE: The human ether-a-go-go-related gene (HERG) encodes the pore-forming subunits of the rapidly activating delayed rectifier <e>potassium</e> channel (I(Kr)) that is important for cardiac repolarization. Dysfunction of HERG causes long QT syndrome (LQTS) which can lead to sudden cardiac death. We previously showed that a reduction in extracellular K(+) concentration ([K(+)](o)) prolongs QT intervals in intact rabbits, and decreases the cell surface density of I(Kr) in rabbit ventricular myocytes and of the HERG channel expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells. OBJECTIVE: The goal of the present study was to gain insights into the mechanisms for low [K(+)](o) induced reduction in HERG expression levels. METHODS AND RESULTS: Using patch clamp, Western blot and confocal imaging methods, we demonstrated that at low [K(+)](o), the HERG channel entered a novel nonconducting state. Furthermore, this novel functional state triggered rapid internalization and degradation of the cell surface HERG channels. Thus, our data demonstrated for the first time a direct link between a gating state and the plasma membrane stability of an ion channel, HERG. Using HERG-permeant cations and site-directed mutagenesis, we identified the sites in the channel which are involved in the K(+)(o) dependence of HERG channels. CONCLUSIONS: Extracellular K(+) is a prerequisite for HERG function and membrane stability.",M1
20133576,"Astrocytic endfoot Ca2+ and BK channels determine both arteriolar dilation and constriction.Neuronal activity is thought to communicate to arterioles in the brain through astrocytic calcium (Ca(2+)) signaling to cause local vasodilation. Paradoxically, this communication may cause vasoconstriction in some cases. Here, we show that, regardless of the mechanism by which astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) was elevated, modest increases in Ca(2+) induced dilation, whereas larger increases switched dilation to constriction. Large-conductance, Ca(2+)-sensitive <e>potassium</e> channels in astrocytic endfeet mediated a majority of the dilation and the entire vasoconstriction, implicating local extracellular K(+) as a vasoactive signal for both dilation and constriction. These results provide evidence for a unifying mechanism that explains the nature and apparent duality of the vascular response, showing that the degree and polarity of neurovascular coupling depends on astrocytic endfoot Ca(2+) and perivascular K(+).",M1
20132951,"Normokalemic adenosine-lidocaine cardioplegia: importance of maintaining a polarized myocardium for optimal arrest and reanimation.OBJECTIVE: Depolarizing <e>potassium</e> cardioplegia does not afford optimal cardioprotection in pediatric or adult patients requiring complicated operative procedures. Polarizing adenosine-lidocaine cardioplegia has been shown to be cardioprotective without hyperkalemia. Our aim was to examine the effects of changing extracellular potassium levels in adenosine-lidocaine cardioplegia on arrest and reanimation properties. METHODS: Isolated-perfused rat hearts (n = 96) were arrested at 32 degrees C to 33 degrees C for 1 or 2 hours with intermittent 200 mumol/L adenosine and 500 mumol/L lidocaine in modified Krebs-Henseleit buffer with 0.1, 3.0, 5.9, 10, and 16 mmol/L potassium or with 16 or 25 mmol/L potassium in Krebs-Henseleit buffer (n = 8 for each group). Membrane potentials were estimated in the arrested ventricular myocardium (n = 42), and recovery function was measured in working mode during 60 minutes' reperfusion. RESULTS: Arrest was interrupted by breakout beats in the adenosine-lidocaine hypokalemic (0.1 and 3 mmol/L potassium) and non-adenosine-lidocaine hyperkalemic (16 and 25 mmol/L potassium) groups. The membrane potentials for the non-adenosine-lidocaine 16 and 25 mmol/L potassium groups were -51 and -39 mV, and those for the adenosine-lidocaine groups (0.1, 3.0, 5.9, 10, and 16 mmol/L potassium) were -183, -94, -75, -65, and -49 mV, respectively. After 1 hour of arrest, coronary vascular resistance increased linearly in adenosine-lidocaine cardioplegia with increasing potassium levels (5.9, 10, and 16 mmol/L), and the slope increased more than 2-fold after 2 hours. Nearly 40% of hearts in the adenosine-lidocaine (0.1 mmol/L potassium) and non-adenosine-lidocaine 25 mmol/L potassium groups failed to recover after 1 hour arrest. After 2 hours, hearts in the polarizing (5.9 mmol/L potassium) adenosine-lidocaine group increased coronary vascular resistance by only 30% and spontaneously recovered 107% heart rate, 92% systolic pressure, 81% aortic flow, and 113% coronary flow (all metrics returned 85% to 100% at 15 minutes) with no reperfusion arrhythmias. In contrast, hearts in the adenosine-lidocaine (3, 10, and 16 mmol/L potassium) groups were all slow to recover (15% to 40% return at 15 minutes) and experienced arrhythmias. Increasing potassium levels in adenosine-lidocaine cardioplegia from 5.9 to 16 mmol/L resulted in a 67% loss of left ventricular contractility. CONCLUSIONS: Polarizing adenosine-lidocaine cardioplegia (5.9 mmol/L potassium) administered intermittently at 33 degrees C provides superior arrest and reanimation profiles under normokalemic conditions when the myocardial cell membrane potential is close to its resting state.",M1
20126460,"Identification of trkH, encoding a <e>potassium</e> uptake protein required for Francisella tularensis systemic dissemination in mice.Francisella tularensis is a highly infectious bacterium causing the zoonotic disease tularaemia. During its infectious cycle, F. tularensis is not only exposed to the intracellular environment of macrophages but also resides transiently in extracellular compartments, in particular during its systemic dissemination. The screening of a bank of F. tularensis LVS transposon insertion mutants on chemically defined medium (CDM) led us to identify a gene, designated trkH, encoding a homolog of the potassium uptake permease TrkH. Inactivation of trkH impaired bacterial growth in CDM. Normal growth of the mutant was only restored when CDM was supplemented with potassium at high concentration. Strikingly, although not required for intracellular survival in cell culture models, TrkH appeared to be essential for bacterial virulence in the mouse. In vivo kinetics of bacterial dissemination revealed a severe defect of multiplication of the trkH mutant in the blood of infected animals. The trkH mutant also showed impaired growth in blood ex vivo. Genome sequence analyses suggest that the Trk system constitutes the unique functional active potassium transporter in both tularensis and holarctica subspecies. Hence, the impaired survival of the trkH mutant in vivo is likely to be due to its inability to survive in the low potassium environment (1-5 mM range) of the blood. This work unravels thus the importance of potassium acquisition in the extracellular phase of the F. tularensis infectious cycle. More generally, potassium could constitute an important mineral nutrient involved in other diseases linked to systemic dissemination of bacterial pathogens.",M1

Both effects were ameliorated by elevated calcium (Ca(2+)). As well, K(+) efflux was strongly stimulated by KCl, NH(4)Cl and mannitol , and NaCl also stimulated (13)NH(4)(+) efflux. The Na(+)-stimulated K(+) efflux was insensitive to cesium (Cs(+)) and pH 4.2, weakly sensitive to the K(+)-channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) and quinine, and moderately sensitive to zinc (Zn(2+)) and lanthanum (La(3+)). *We conclude that the stimulated efflux is: specific neither to Na(+) as effector nor K(+) as target; composed of fluxes from both cytosol and vacuole; mediated neither by outwardly-rectifying K(+) channels nor nonselective cation channels; attributable, alternatively, to membrane disintegration brought about by ionic and osmotic components; of limited long-term significance, unlike the suppression of K(+) influx by Na(+), which is a greater threat to K(+) homeostasis under salt stress.",M1

Plasma sodium and potassium levels of the control rats fluctuated between 153.14 +/- 2.88 - 157.23 +/- 2.16 meq l(-1) and 5.04 +/- 0.32 - 5.63 +/- 0.41 meq l(-1), respectively.

For the present investigations maize seeds were sown in petridishes on filter paper in triplicate containing different doses of cadmium viz. 0.05, 0. 10, 0.25, 0.50, 0.75 and 1.0 mM and for interactive studies maize seeds sown in 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 mM Cd concentration were subjected to 0.50 and 1.00 mM concentration of potassium and copper respectively. At the high cadmium concentrations, germination percentage was decreased. I also showed considerable reduction in plumule length, radicle length and number of lateral roots while the potassium and copper combination with cadmium increased the seedling growth. The calculated values of SVI were found to be decreased with increase in the concentration of cadmium. Decreased GRI values were observed in maize treated with three higher concentrations of cadmium but the combination of potassium and copper showed recovery in GRI values. The fresh weight, dry weight and moisture contents were also found reduced with higher cadmium concentrations but the potassium and copper combination showed recovery when used with higher concentration of cadmium. Declined chlorophyll contents were noticed under the influence of higher cadmium concentrations. Both the combination of potassium and copper used with 0.50, 0.75 and 1.00 mM cadmium concentrations resulted in increased chlorophyll and pheophytin contents and decreased in Cu combination respectively. The potassium and copper (both 0.50 and 1.00 mM) with 0.75 and 1.00 mM cadmium increased the carotenoid contents although lone cadmium decreased it. Amylase activity was found to be gradually reduced at all concentrations of cadmium. The 0.50 mM and 1.00mM potassium combination improved amylase activity. Marked increase in catalase and peroxidase activity by the application of test chemical was observed in different doses of cadmium. The potassium and copper combination used with cadmium concentration reduced catalase activity while peroxidase activity was promoted.",M1
20111008,"Meta-analysis of dose-response characteristics of hydrochlorothiazide and chlorthalidone: effects on systolic blood pressure and <e>potassium</e>.BACKGROUND: Evidence supporting the benefit of low-dose thiazide-based regimens to reduce cardiovascular events is primarily derived from studies using chlorthalidone, yet low-dose hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) (12.5-25 mg) remains more widely prescribed. We sought to describe their comparative dose-response relationships for changes in systolic blood pressure (SBP) and potassium. METHODS: PubMed from 1948 to July 2008 was systematically searched to identify clinical trials using either HCTZ or chlorthalidone monotherapies. A total of 108 clinical trials with HCTZ and 29 with chlorthalidone were analyzed. Data were pooled to evaluate the effects on SBP and potassium of both drugs throughout their respective dose-response curves. Equivalence analysis was performed for the clinically recommended low-dose range of 12.5-25 mg, grouped by study duration, using the two one-sided tests procedure described by Schuirmann. RESULTS: When evaluated on a milligram-per-milligram basis using pooled data, chlorthalidone generally produces slightly greater reductions in SBP and potassium than HCTZ. In the low-dose range of 12.5-25 mg, equivalence analysis reveals that the reductions in SBP are not equivalent between the two drugs, using upper and lower equivalence bounds of 4 mm Hg. Within the same dosing range, the mean changes in potassium were determined to be equivalent when upper and lower equivalence bounds of 0.29 mEq/l are used. CONCLUSIONS: Equivalence analysis using data from several studies suggests that the SBP reductions achieved with HCTZ and chlorthalidone cannot be considered equivalent within the low-dose range currently recommended. However, within this dosing range, reductions in potassium can be considered equivalent.",M1

Periodic follow-up abdominal ultrasonography revealed a tumor measuring 4 cm in diameter in an area adjacent to the upper pole of the right kidney. Abdominal computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed a right adrenal tumor. Furthermore, adrenal scintigraphy after dexamethasone inhibition showed accumulation in the right adrenal gland. An endocrinological test revealed that the plasma renin activity (PRA) was normal, and that the plasma aldosterone (PAC) level was increased to 1,021.8 ng/dl. The PAC-to-PRA ratio (ARR) was 5,109. Under a diagnosis of aldosterone-producing adrenal tumor, laparoscopic right adrenalectomy was performed. After surgery, the PAC level was normalized. Pathological findings showed adrenal cortical adenoma. Primary aldosteronism causes hypertension, hypopotassiumemia, hyporeninemia, and hyperaldosteronemia via excessive secretion of aldosterone in the adrenal glands. However, the patient showed a high serum level of <e>potassium</e> due to anuria, and hypertension was not noted.

20097760,"The role of <e>potassium</e> in inflammasome activation by bacteria.Many Gram-negative bacteria possess a type III secretion system (TTSS( paragraph sign)) that can activate the NLRC4 inflammasome, process caspase-1 and lead to secretion of mature IL-1beta. This is dependent on the presence of intracellular flagellin. Previous reports have suggested that this activation is independent of extracellular K(+) and not accompanied by leakage of K(+) from the cell, in contrast to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome. However, non-flagellated strains of Pseudomonas aeruginosa are able to activate NLRC4, suggesting that formation of a pore in the cell membrane by the TTSS apparatus may be sufficient for inflammasome activation. Thus, we set out to determine if extracellular K(+) influenced P. aeruginosa inflammasome activation. We found that raising extracellular K(+) prevented TTSS NLRC4 activation by the non-flagellated P. aeruginosa strain PA103DeltaUDeltaT at concentrations above 90 mm, higher than those reported to inhibit NLRP3 activation. Infection was accompanied by efflux of K(+) from a minority of cells as determined using the K(+)-sensitive fluorophore PBFI, but no formation of a leaky pore. We obtained exactly the same results following infection with Salmonella typhimurium, previously described as independent of extracellular K(+). The inhibitory effect of raised extracellular K(+) on NLRC4 activation thus reflects a requirement for a decrease in intracellular K(+) for this inflammasome component as well as that described for NLRP3.",M1
20091484,"Dialysate <e>potassium</e> and risk of death in chronic hemodialysis patients.BACKGROUND: Few data guide the prescription of dialysate potassium (dK) in hemodialysis, which is usually prescribed empirically on the basis of predialysis serum potassium levels. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study of prospectively collected data. We studied all patients initiating chronic hemodialysis in the Northern Alberta Renal Program (NARP) between January 2001 and December 2006. Data on demographic, clinical and treatment characteristics as well as the dates of death or transplant were extracted from the NARP database. We aimed to examine the relation between dialysate potassium level and all-cause death. RESULTS: During the study, 515/1,267 of patients (41%) died. The frequency of dK of 0 or 1 mEq/L, 2, 3 and 4 mEq/L was 6%, 40%, 51% and 3%, respectively. In our base model, which considered dK as a categorical exposure, the hazard ratios associated with 0 or 1 mEq/L, 2, 3 and 4 mEq/L were 1.13 (95% confidence interval [95% CI], 0.78-1.63), 1 (referent), 1.29 (95% CI, 1.07-1.56) and 1.74 (95% CI, 1.09-2.77), respectively. When markers of inflammation or malnutrition were adjusted for separately, the association between dK and mortality was attenuated but remained significant. After simultaneous adjustment for markers of inflammation and malnutrition, the risk of death associated with the higher dK categories was attenuated, and the overall trend was eliminated. Analyses using dK as a time-varying covariate found similar results. CONCLUSIONS: Although unadjusted and partially adjusted models suggested a graded association between higher dK and the risk of all-cause death, this association was apparently due to confounding by factors suggesting malnutrition and inflammation. The relative paucity of data on the association between dK and clinical outcomes despite the biological importance of potassium suggest that further studies are needed.",M1
20088519,"<e>Potassium</e> is critical for the Ni(II)-responsive DNA-binding activity of Escherichia coli NikR.The Escherichia coli NikR transcription factor is a Ni(II)-dependent repressor that regulates the production of a nickel ion transporter. The X-ray crystal structure of the Ni(II)-NikR-DNA bound complex revealed a K(+)-binding site positioned at the interface of the metal- and DNA-binding domains, but the significance of the potassium was unclear. Mutation of one of the K(+) ligands impairs the affinity and specificity of DNA binding in the presence of either stoichiometric or excess Ni(II). Removal of K(+) abrogates Ni(II)-responsive DNA binding completely while the addition of K(+) restores this activity. Furthermore, the observed K(+) dependence can be relieved by replacing the K(+) ligand Asp34 with an arginine. These mutagenesis and cation exchange experiments reveal that K(+) is a critical structural component for the activation of Ni(II)-responsive DNA binding by NikR.",M1
20086212,"A thallium transport FLIPR-based assay for the identification of KCC2-positive modulators.KCC2, <e>potassium</e> chloride cotransporter 2, is expressed exclusively in the CNS (on inhibitory neurons) and plays a major role in maintaining appropriately low intracellular chloride levels that ensure inhibitory actions of GABA(A) and glycine receptors. As such, it plays a pivotal role in inhibitory mechanisms that control neuronal excitation in the CNS. KCC2 downregulation has been implicated in various excitatory disorders, such as epilepsy and neuropathic pain. Positive modulators of KCC2 expression or activity may thus provide effective therapy for these disorders. However, the identification of such agents is hindered by the lack of a high-throughput screening method. Here the authors report the development of a fluorescence-based thallium (Tl(+)) transport assay using a Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader (FLIPR), in which KCC2 activity is assessed by measuring the initial rate of KCC2-mediated Tl(+) transport/influx. The authors demonstrate Tl(+)/Cl(-) cotransport by KCC2, which exhibits a high apparent affinity for Tl(+) and dependency on the presence of the Cl(-) ion. Pharmacological studies revealed anticipated effects and potencies of known KCC-positive (NEM, staurosporine) and KCC-negative (DIOA, furosemide) modulators. The authors demonstrate that the assay is robust and reproducible and can be employed in high-throughput screening for positive modulators of KCC2 as potential therapeutic agents.",M1

Urinary potassium was 77+/-16, 122+/-25, and 125+/-27 mmol/24 hours after 4 weeks on placebo, potassium chloride, and potassium bicarbonate, respectively. There were no significant differences in office blood pressure among the 3 treatment periods, and only 24-hour and daytime systolic blood pressures were slightly lower with potassium chloride. Compared with placebo, both potassium chloride and potassium bicarbonate significantly improved endothelial function as measured by brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation, increased arterial compliance as assessed by carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity, decreased left ventricular mass, and improved left ventricular diastolic function. There was no significant difference between the 2 potassium salts in these measurements. The study also showed that potassium chloride reduced 24-hour urinary albumin and albumin:creatinine ratio, and potassium bicarbonate decreased 24-hour urinary calcium, calcium:creatinine ratio, and plasma C-terminal cross-linking telopeptide of type 1 collagen significantly. These results demonstrated that an increase in potassium intake had beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system, and potassium bicarbonate may improve bone health. Importantly, these effects were found in individuals who already had a relatively low-salt and high-potassium intake.",M1
20083182,"Diuretic activity and kidney medulla AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, V2R expression of the aqueous extract of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus FRIES in normal rats.AIM OF THE STUDY: Zhuling, sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus FRIES, a Traditional Chinese Medicine, has long been used as a diuretic. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diuretic effect on the urinary electrolyte concentration (Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-)) and regulation of the relative mRNA expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP1), aquaporin-2 (AQP2), aquaporin-3 (AQP3) and vasopressin V(2) receptor (V(2)R) post-oral administration of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellata aqueous extract in normal rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous extract of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus (50 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg) or the reference drug, furosemide (10mg/kg) were administrated orally to male SD rats and their urine output was quantified and collected 24h and 8 days after the treatment. The kidney medulla AQP1, AQP2, AQP3 and V(2)R mRNA relative expressions were measured with RT-PCR. RESULTS: After single dose of the exact of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellata, urine output was found to be significantly increased, which began at 4h, and at 24h after the treatment, the sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus extract and furosemide treatment produced the similar total volume of urine excreted. The extract increases urinary levels of Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-), to about the same extent, while furosemide increased urinary levels of Na(+) and Cl(-). After the 8-day doses, all two substances induced significant diuresis, natriuresis and chloriuresis. These two substances do not regulate the AQP1 and AQP3 mRNA level in normal rat kidney medulla. The AQP2 mRNA level of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellata extract was down-regulated significantly, the V(2)R mRNA level of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellata extract 50mg/kg dose group and 250 mg/kg dose group were down-regulated significantly too. Interestingly, the low-dose group had higher effect on regulation of AQP2 and V(2)R mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Aqueous extract of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus has conspicuous diuretic effect confirming its ethnopharmacological use. From the pattern of excretion of water, sodium, <e>potassium</e>, chlorine, AQP2 and V2R mRNA level, it may be logically concluded that it has effect from down-regulating AQP2, and down-regulate AQP2 by down-regulating V(2)R.",M1
20081258,"Effect of peptide and nonpeptide antagonists of angiotensin II receptors on noradrenaline release in hypothalamus of rats with angiotensin II-induced increase of water intake.Angiotensin II (Ang II) administered intracerebroventriculary (icv) at a dose that induces drinking behavior in rats significantly increased K(+)-stimulated release of [(3)H] noradrenaline (NA) in hypothalamus without affecting basal [(3)H] NA release. The observed difference between the effects of Ang II on basal and K(+)-stimulated [(3)H]NA release may possibly be due to the fact that peptides are released after increased neuronal activity. It can be suggested that Ang II is important primarily in pathological states and that NA plays a substantial role in the brain Ang II-induced drinking response. The imidazolic nonpeptidic compound 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-5-hydroxymethyl-1-{[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)biphenyl-4-yl]methyl}imidazole <e>potassium</e> salt (DuP 753, losartan), its active metabolite 2-n-butyl-4-chloro-1-{[2-(1H-tetrazol-5-yl)- biphenyl-4-yl]methyl}imidazole-5-carboxylic acid (EXP 3174) and peptide Ang II analogue, sarmesin, antagonized the Ang II-induced effect on [(3)H]NA release, in spite of the differences in their chemical structures. Thus, the drugs tested inhibited K(+)-stimulated [(3)H]NA release in hypothalamus, acting via the angiotensin (AT)(1) receptor subtype. We could not reject the possibility of a non-receptor mechanism of action for DuP753, EXP3174 and sarmesin. This research allows us to suggest a neurochemical mechanism for the modulatory role of these drugs on the NA-ergic system. The Ang II receptor antagonists studied may become important therapeutic agents, which act preferentially on pathologically activated systems. These agents may be of use for the prevention of excessive ingestion of water in some neuropsychotic diseases.",M1
20074622,"Inwardly rectifying <e>potassium</e> channel Kir4.1 is responsible for the native inward potassium conductance of satellite glial cells in sensory ganglia.Satellite glial cells (SGCs) surround primary afferent neurons in sensory ganglia, and increasing evidence has implicated the K(+) channels of SGCs in affecting or regulating sensory ganglion excitability. The inwardly rectifying K(+) (Kir) channel Kir4.1 is highly expressed in several types of glial cells in the central nervous system (CNS) where it has been implicated in extracellular K(+) concentration buffering. Upon neuronal activity, the extracellular K(+) concentration increases, and if not corrected, causes neuronal depolarization and uncontrolled changes in neuronal excitability. Recently, it has been demonstrated that knockdown of Kir4.1 expression in trigeminal ganglia leads to neuronal hyperexcitability in this ganglia and heightened nociception. Thus, we investigated the contribution of Kir4.1 to the membrane K(+) conductance of SGCs in neonatal and adult mouse trigeminal and dorsal root ganglia. Whole cell patch clamp recordings were performed in conjunction with immunocytochemistry and quantitative transcript analysis in various mouse lines. We found that in wild-type mice, the inward K(+) conductance of SGCs is blocked almost completely with extracellular barium, cesium and desipramine, consistent with a conductance mediated by Kir channels. We then utilized mouse lines in which genetic ablation led to partial or complete loss of Kir4.1 expression to assess the role of this channel subunit in SGCs. The inward K(+) currents of SGCs in Kir4.1+/- mice were decreased by about half while these currents were almost completely absent in Kir4.1-/- mice. These findings in combination with previous reports support the notion that Kir4.1 is the principal Kir channel type in SGCs. Therefore Kir4.1 emerges as a key regulator of SGC function and possibly neuronal excitability in sensory ganglia.",M1
20072789,"Hypokalemic rhabdomyolysis in a child with Gitelman's syndrome.We report here the first published case of a pediatric patient with Gitelman's syndrome (GS) in whom hypokalemia-associated rhabdomyolysis developed.

Laboratory data showed a serum <e>potassium</e> level of 2.1 mmol/l and a serum creatinine phosphokinase level of 1,248 IU/l plus myoglobinemia. The presence of normomagnesemia was the basis for a genetic analysis of the thiazide-sensitive sodium chloride cotransporter gene, which revealed compound heterozygous mutations in this gene. Prompt fluid expansion and potassium supplementation led to regression of the muscle symptoms. Hypokalemia can be a rare cause of rhabdomyolysis in patients with GS, even in childhood. We emphasize that genetic analysis is advisable to determine whether the suspicion of GS is warranted.",M1

20067181,"[Different domain organization of two main conformational states of Na+/K+-ATPase]Na+/K+-ATPase generates an electrochemical gradient of Na+ and K+, which is necessary for the functioning of animal cells. During the catalytic act, the enzyme passes through two ground conformational states, E1 and E2. To characterize the domain organization of the protein in these conformations, the thermal denaturation of Na+/K+-ATPase from duck salt glands and rabbit kidneys has been studied in the presence of Na+ and K+, which induce the transition of the enzyme to the conformation E1 or E2. The melting curves for the apoforms of Na+/K+-ATPases have different shapes: the curve for the enzyme from the rabbit shows one transition at 56.1 degrees C, whereas the denaturation of Na+/K+-ATPase from the duck is characterized by two transitions, at 49.8 and 56.9 degrees C. Sodium and <e>potassium</e> ions abolish the difference in the domain organization of Na+/K+-ATPases. The melting curves for Na+/K+-ATPases in conformation E2 in both cases exhibit a single peak of thermal absorption at about 63 degrees C. The melting curves for the enzymes in conformation E1 show three peaks of thermal absorption, indicating the denaturation of three domains. The difference in the domain organization of Na+/K+-ATPase in conformations E1 and E2 may be of importance in different sensitivity of these conformations of the enzyme to temperature, proteolytic enzymes, and oxidative stress.",M1

METHOD: The sampling were carried out on the different growing time of C. morifolium, and the amount of dry matter and the content of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in all parts of the plant were measured. RESULT: The dry matter accumulation was lineally increased with the absorption and accumulation of N, P, K, Ca, and Mg. In different growing periods, the accumulation and distribution of mineral nutrition were different in C. morifolium. The mineral nutrition was mostly in the leaf of the plant in the vegetative period. When the growth changed from vegetative growth to reproductive growth, the mineral nutrition was transferred and distributed into bud, flower and root shoot. And the period of flower bud differentiation of C. morifolium was the period of maximal accumulation of dry matter and showed the maximum efficiency of N, P and K nutrition. For production of 100 kg dry flower 4.13 kg N, 0.37 kg P, 5.03 kg K, 3.03 kg Ca and 0.81 kg Mg were needed. And the ratio of them was 1:0.09:1.22:0.73:0.20. CONCLUSION: The period of flower bud differentiation is the most crucial period in the growth of C. morifolium. And it must pay attention to the supply of mineral nutrition and moisture of plant to promote flower formation and dry matter accumulation in this period. It is strongly recommended that the phosphorus and potassium fertilizers should be early applied, the nitrogenous fertilizer should be applied dividedly, and the calcium magnesium fertilizers are also applied properly.",M1
20065504,"Solute-free water retention in preascitic cirrhotic rats following intravenous water loading.Increased extracellular fluid volume (ECF) characterizes compensated cirrhosis. To identify the mechanisms of fluid retention in cirrhosis through clearance methods, 10 control and 10 preascitic rats with CCl(4)-induced cirrhosis were studied following i.v. loading with 1 ml 5% glucose solution. Glomerular filtration rate and renal plasma flow were evaluated through inulin and para-aminohippurate clearances; water and electrolyte handling was assessed measuring urine and plasma osmolarity, electrolyte excretions, and tubular solute-free water reabsorption (TFWR = osmolar clearance minus urinary output); ECF was assessed through hormonal status determination. After water loading, cirrhotic rats had increased ECF (lower plasma renin activity and aldosterone and higher atrial natriuretic peptide levels, all P&lt;0.03), solute-free water retention (increased TFWR and decreased plasma osmolarity, all P&lt;0.05), reduced absolute and fractional sodium excretions (P&lt;0.05). Cirrhotic rats showed sodium retention in the medullary thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (i.e. increased values of TFWR for any given value of osmolar clearance). Trans-tubular <e>potassium</e> gradient in medullary collecting duct was similar in the two groups (P=0.55), ruling out aldosterone-dependent sodium retention and potassium hyper-secretion.

We analyzed the results of 75 (19.5%) of the 398 renal transplants performed over a five-year period from 2002 to 2007, who were converted from a CNI-based immunosuppression to rapamycin including patients with chronic allograft dysfunction, chronic allograft injury and malignancy. The data analyzed included serial rapamycin levels, serum creatinine, eGFR by nankivel formula, lipid profile, hemoglobin and serum <e>potassium</e> levels. Statistical analysis was performed using student's t test and the Kaplan Meir survival curve was used to predict probability of survival among patients on rapamycin. The mean age of the study patients was 39.6 + or - 12.2 yrs and there was a male predominance (74.6%). Diabetic nephropathy was the predominant cause (36%) of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Statistical analysis revealed a significant improvement in GFR of 14.6 mL/min and decrease in potassium by 0.7 mmol/L after initiation of rapamycin. There were no significant differences in terms of lipid profile, platelet count, hemoglobin and urine albumin levels. Rapamycin was discontinued in one patient due to hypokalemic nephropathy and in another patient due to delayed wound healing. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide information on the conversion from a CNI to rapamycin-based immunosuppression in a cohort of Indian renal transplant recipients.

Control group animals received 0.5 mL phosphate buffered saline (PBS) injected subcutaneously into the internal portion of the left thigh, whilst dogs in the envenomed group were injected with scorpion venom (250 microg/kg in 0.5 mL PBS). No significant alterations were detected in the urine of envenomed dogs. Levels of plasma glucose and serum urea, creatinine, total protein, <e>potassium</e>, alanine aminotransferase (ALT), aspartate aminotransferase (AST), creatine kinase (CK), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), and amylase were determined. Semi-quantitative analysis of serum cardiac troponin I (cTnI) was performed using an immunochromatographic test. The concentrations of cortisol and insulin were determined using commercial radioimmunoassay kits. Increases in serum cortisol levels in experimental group animals coincided with hyperglycaemia and was probably a response to pain. Increased insulin levels were observed during the hyperglycaemic peaks. Envenomed dogs presented discreet increases in ALT, AST and CK, but no alterations in LDH, amylase, cTnI, urea, creatinine and potassium levels were observed.

METHODS: We obtained data from NIPPON DATA80 and 90 that were conducted with the National Nutrition Surveys in 1980 and in 1990. Then we estimated nutrient and food intakes of individuals in the National Nutrition Survey of 1980 and that of 1990, which were adjusted on the basis of data of the National Nutrition Survey of 1995. We analyzed data for 10,422 participants (4585 men and 5837 women) in NIPPON DATA80 and 8342 participants (3488 men and 4854 women) in NIPPON DATA90 having dietary potassium intake information. RESULTS: In NIPPON DATA80 and 90 it was observed that there was a significant relationship between the dietary potassium intake and age for both men and women. Higher potassium intake was associated with higher age, intake of protein, iron, calcium, sodium, vitamins, and fiber. Regarding food groups, lower amount of dietary cereals, rice, flour, fats and oils were associated with higher dietary potassium for both men and women. On the other hand, higher intake of nuts, potatoes, soy beans, fruits, vegetables, mushrooms, sea algae, fish and shellfish were associated with higher dietary potassium.

He was started on <e>potassium</e> supplements (120 mmol/d) and advised to increase dietary potassium by the surgical team. A detailed personal history revealed ingestion of 300-500 g licorice per day. Physical examination was unremarkable apart from increased blood pressure of 180/105 mmHg. Following the initial visit, his serum electrolyes (K+3.7 mmol/l) were normal with potassium supplementation and as were morning cortisol, ACTH, 11-deoxycortisol and plasma metanephrines. 17 OH-P, DHEAS and androstenedione were normal but testosterone was low. Morning ambulant aldosterone was slightly increased at 801 pmol/L and renin activity was undetectable. Urinary 24 h aldosterone excretion was significantly increased at 162 ng/24 h with normal cortisol and catecholamine excretion. Four weeks following advice to stop licorice, serum potassium decreased to 3.4 mmol/L despite continuous supplementation. Morning plasma aldosterone increased to 1 449 pmol/ml, renin activity remained undetectable but 24 h urine aldosterone excretion increased to 434 ng/24 h with a reduction in urinary cortisol excretion. Interestingly 17 OH-P and androstenedione levels, although within the reference range, were slightly higher compared to the levels whilst on licorice.

Beginning 21 d before expected parturition, cows were fed a control diet (1.29% K; +10 mEq/100 g; n = 21) or a low dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) diet (1.29% K; -15 mEq/100 g; n = 22) with anions provided through a combination of sulfate from calcium sulfate dihydrate (0.40% S total ration) and chloride (1.17% Cl total ration) from SoyChlor 16-7 (West Central, Ralston, IA). All cows were fed the same postpartum diet from parturition through 63 d postpartum. Feeding anions decreased overall urine pH (8.17 vs. 6.70) during the prepartum period. Overall, peripartum concentrations of plasma Ca, P, and Mg were similar between treatments; however, concentrations of plasma Ca tended to be increased during the first 24 h postcalving in cows fed the low DCAD diet. Overall, concentrations of plasma P tended to be increased by feeding the anionic diet prepartum; this effect was more pronounced during the immediate peripartal period. Anionic supplementation did not affect incidence of clinical (&lt;5 mg/dL) and subclinical (5 to 8 mg/dL) hypocalcemia, clinical hypophosphatemia (&lt;2 mg/dL), or clinical (&lt;1.1 mg/dL) and subclinical (1.1 to 1.8 mg/dL) hypomagnesemia. Nevertheless, subclinical hypophosphatemia (2 to 4 mg/dL) tended to be decreased at 16 h postcalving and was decreased at d 2 postpartum for cows fed the anionic diet prepartum. Anion supplementation decreased prepartum dry matter intake (15.6 vs. 14.4 kg/d), but did not affect postpartum dry matter intake (22.4 vs. 23.0 kg/d), milk yield (46.5 vs. 46.1 kg/d), or content and yield of milk fat and true protein. Plasma concentrations of energy-related metabolites (glucose, nonesterified fatty acids, beta-hydroxybutyrate) were similar for both groups during the prepartum and postpartum periods.

We examined the correlation between BP responses to dietary low-sodium, high-sodium, and potassium supplementation interventions in a feeding study. METHODS: A total of 1,906 Chinese aged &gt; or = 16 years participated in the dietary intervention that included a 7-day low-salt intervention (51.3 mmol/day), a 7-day high-salt intervention (307.8 mmol/day), and a 7-day high-salt plus potassium supplementation (60 mmol/day) intervention. BP was measured nine times during the 3-day baseline observation and during the last 3 days of each intervention phase using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. RESULTS: The correlation coefficients (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of the BP responses to low-sodium and high-sodium interventions were -0.47 (-0.51 to -0.44), -0.47 (-0.50 to -0.43), and -0.45 (-0.49 to -0.42) for systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP), respectively (all P &lt; 0.0001). The correlation coefficients (95% CI) of the BP responses to high-sodium intervention and potassium supplementation were -0.52 (-0.56 to -0.49), -0.48 (-0.52 to 0.45), and -0.52 (-0.55 to -0.48) for SBP, DBP, and MAP, respectively (all P &lt; 0.0001). The kappa coefficients were moderate, varying from 0.28 to 0.34, between BP responses to low-sodium and high-sodium interventions (all P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate there is a moderate correlation between BP responses to low-sodium and to high-sodium interventions, and BP responses to high-sodium intervention and potassium supplementation.

The study was conducted using a 2 x 3 factorial treatment arrangement. Factors evaluated included 2 water sources: 1) a blend of reverse osmosis and well water (RO; 608 +/- 164 mg/L of SO(4)) and 2) 100% well water with SO(4) concentration of 1,933 +/- 53 mg/L and 3 dietary K treatments. Potassium treatments included 0.75% K with supplemental K from potassium chloride (0.75% K-KCl), 0.75% K with supplemental K from potassium carbonate (0.75% K-K(2)CO(3)), and 1.0% K with supplemental K from potassium carbonate (1.0% K-K(2)CO(3)). Interactions between water quality and dietary treatments were not significant. Dry matter intake tended (P = 0.10) to be greater for steers consuming RO water compared with well water and was not affected by dietary treatment. Feed efficiency (P = 0.04) and NE(g) recovery (P = 0.04) were greater for 1.0% K-K(2)CO(3) compared with 0.75% K-KCl but were not affected by water quality. Final BW was heavier (P &lt; 0.001) and ADG was greater (P = 0.04) for RO water compared with well water but were not affected by diet. Carcasses from steers that consumed RO water tended (P = 0.08) to be heavier than carcasses from steers consuming well water. Dietary treatment did not affect HCW (P = 0.52). Yield grade calculated from carcass measurements was not affected by dietary treatment or water quality. Carcasses from steers consuming well water had greater (P = 0.04) marbling scores than RO water. These data demonstrate that steers consuming RO water achieved improved feedlot performance. Steers fed 1.0% K-K(2)CO(3) were more efficient and demonstrated improved energy recovery compared with steers fed 0.75% K-KCl. Improved efficiency and energy recovery may be related to a reduction (P = 0.06) in the liver abscess rate for steers consuming 1.0% K-K(2)CO(3).

We also used the ratio of animal protein intake to <e>potassium</e> intake as an alternative evaluation of diet-dependent net acid load. We identified 15 385 incident cases of hypertension during 995 239 person-years of follow-up. After adjusting for potential confounders, women in the top decile of estimated diet-dependent net acid load had an increased risk of hypertension (relative risk: 1.14; 95% CI: 1.05 to 1.24; P for trend=0.01) compared with women in the bottom decile. To test whether the association between estimated diet-dependent net acid load and hypertension is independent of its individual components, an additional adjustment for intakes of protein and potassium was made and resulted in a relative risk of 1.23 (95% CI: 1.08 to 1.41; P for trend=0.003) for the top decile of estimated diet-dependent net acid load. Results of the ratio of animal protein intake to potassium intake were similar with those of estimated diet-depend net acid load. In conclusion, a high diet-dependent net acid load is independently associated with a higher risk of incident hypertension.",M2
19661927,"Family-based randomized trial to detect effects on blood pressure of a salt substitute containing <e>potassium</e> and calcium in hypertensive adolescents.BACKGROUND: Potassium and calcium are important in blood pressure (BP) regulation. The aim of this study was to test the effects on BP of adding potassium and calcium to dietary salt. METHODS: A total of 325 adolescents selected with high BP (systolic BP (SBP) &gt;or=90th percentile by age and sex) along with 978 family members. The adolescents were randomized into three groups by coin toss, and their families (300 total) were also allocated to the three groups: one in which 10 mmol of potassium and 10 mmol of calcium were added to the cooking salt, one encouraged to follow a salt-restricted diet, and a control group. In the salt-restricted group, salt intake was decreased gradually through health-behavior education to reach the goal of 50-100 mmol per person per day at 2 years. No intervention took place in for the control group. Salt sensitivity was determined by a volume expansion and contraction protocol at the beginning of the study. The three groups were followed up every 6 months for 2 years. RESULTS: At 2 years, systolic and diastolic blood pressure (SBP/DBP) had decreased by 5.9/2.8 mm Hg (4.7/3.6%) in the added-potassium-and-calcium group and by 5.8/1.0 mm Hg (4.8/1.4%) in the salt-restricted group; the values rose in the control group by 1.3/2.3 mm Hg (1.1/1.8%). There was no difference between the added-potassium-and-calcium group and the restricted-salt group (P = 0.24), but both differed significantly from the controls (P &lt; 0.05). Similar changes in BP were found in family members. Subgroup analysis showed that the BP in salt-sensitive (SS) subjects decreased more than in the non-salt-sensitive (NSS) group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: A salt substitute containing potassium and calcium was as effective as sodium restriction in reducing BP in hypertensive adolescents and their families in a that rural Chinese community.",M2
19657848,"Physical and chemical characteristics of golden-yellow and purple-red varieties of tamarillo fruit (Solanum betaceum Cav.).Golden-yellow and purple-red tamarillos (Solanum betaceum Cav.) cultivated in Ecuador were studied for their physical properties, proximate composition, pH, degrees Brix, acidity, sugars, organic acids, minerals, vitamin C and beta-carotene content in the edible part. Results were compared with those for Spanish fruits. The golden-yellow and purple-red Ecuadorian fruits were larger (107 and 188 g) than the respective Spanish fruits (43 and 63 g), softer but generally similar in chemical composition except for fat (0.72 and 0.6%) and malic acid (0.32 and 0.53%) contents in the golden-yellow and purple-red Ecuadorian fruits. Tamarillo fruits are a good source of <e>potassium</e> (approximately 400 mg/100 g fresh weight). Total phenolics in the golden-yellow and purple-red varieties were 125 and 187 mg gallic acid equivalents/100 g fresh weight, respectively. The golden-yellow variety had weaker anti-DPPH radical activity than the purple-red variety. Flavonols were only found in the peel of both varieties, while hydroxycinnamic acid derivatives were found in peel and pulp.",M2
19628683,"Phosphorus and <e>potassium</e> content of enhanced meat and poultry products: implications for patients who receive dialysis.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Uncooked meat and poultry products are commonly enhanced by food processors using phosphate salts. The addition of potassium and phosphorus to these foods has been recognized but not quantified. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: We measured the phosphorus, potassium, and protein content of 36 uncooked meat and poultry products: Phosphorus using the Association of Analytical Communities (AOAC) official method 984.27, potassium using AOAC official method 985.01, and protein using AOAC official method 990.03. RESULTS: Products that reported the use of additives had an average phosphate-protein ratio 28% higher than additive free products; the content ranged up to almost 100% higher. Potassium content in foods with additives varied widely; additive free products all contained &lt;387 mg/100 g, whereas five of the 25 products with additives contained at least 692 mg/100 g (maximum 930 mg/100 g). Most but not all foods with phosphate and potassium additives reported the additives (unquantified) on the labeling; eight of 25 enhanced products did not list the additives. The results cannot be applied to other products. The composition of the food additives used by food processors may change over time. CONCLUSIONS: Uncooked meat and poultry products that are enhanced may contain additives that increase phosphorus and potassium content by as much as almost two- and three-fold, respectively; this modification may not be discernible from inspection of the food label.",M2
19626043,"DASH lowers blood pressure in obese hypertensives beyond <e>potassium</e>, magnesium and fibre.The mechanism underlying blood pressure (BP) reduction in the high fruits and vegetables arm of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study is unknown but may include potassium, magnesium and fibre. This study was designed to separate minerals and fibre from other components of DASH on BP in abdominally obese individuals with metabolic syndrome with pre-hypertension to stage 1 hypertension (obese hypertensives). A total of 15 obese hypertensives and 15 lean normotensives were studied on a standardized usual diet, randomized to DASH or usual diet supplemented with potassium, magnesium and fibre to match DASH, then crossed over to the complementary diet. All diets were 3 weeks long, isocaloric and matched for sodium and calcium. In obese hypertensives, BP was lower after 3 weeks on DASH than usual diet (-7.6+/-1.4/-5.3+/-1.4 mm Hg, P&lt;0.001/0.02) and usual diet supplemented (-6.2+/-1.4/-3.7+/-1.4 P&lt;0.005/0.06), whereas BP was not significantly different on usual and supplemented diets. BP values were not different among the three diets in lean normotensives. Small artery elasticity was lower in obese hypertensives than in lean normotensives on the usual and supplemented diets (P&lt;0.02). This index of endothelial function improved in obese hypertensives (P&lt;0.02) but not lean normotensives on DASH, and was no longer different from values in lean normotensives (P&gt;0.50). DASH is more effective than potassium, magnesium and fibre supplements for lowering BP in obese hypertensives, which suggest that high fruits and vegetables DASH lowers BP and improves endothelial function in this group by nutritional factors in addition to potassium, magnesium and fibre.",M2
19623204,"Dietary sources and correlates of sodium and <e>potassium</e> intakes in the French general population.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To investigate the dietary sources of sodium and potassium and to explore the biological, behavioural and socio-demographic factors associated with a high sodium and low potassium diet in a general population. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cross-sectional dietary survey carried out in 1998 and 1999 in nationally representative samples of adults (n=1474) and children (n=1018). Daily sodium and potassium intakes were estimated using a 7-day food record after exclusion of underreporters. RESULTS: Mean sodium intake was well above, whereas mean potassium intake was largely below the current recommendations in adults and children. The consumption of a high sodium and low potassium diet appeared very early in life and increased up to adulthood, especially in men living in small communities. Despite the fact that sodium and potassium intakes were positively correlated to each other and to total food intake, several food categories showed a sodium/potassium intake ratio well above one (cheeses, cooked pork meats, breads, breakfast cereals, soups, fast foods, pastries and sugary products) whereas others presented a ratio well below one (fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meats and hot beverages). CONCLUSIONS: High sodium and low potassium intakes were widespread in the population. The fact that the main dietary sources of sodium and potassium were, for the most part, not the same demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously decreasing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake at the individual level [corrected].",M2

19571165,"The role of dairy in meeting the recommendations for shortfall nutrients in the American diet.BACKGROUND: The 2005 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee (DGAC) recognized calcium, <e>potassium</e> and magnesium, all found in high levels in dairy foods, among the shortfall nutrients in both children and adults' diets. OBJECTIVE: The objectives were to determine: 1) the percentage of the population with intakes greater than the Adequate Intakes (AI) for calcium and potassium and the percentage of the population with inadequate magnesium intake (based on Estimated Average Requirement [EAR]) and 2) the impact of various levels of dairy consumption on intake of calcium, potassium and magnesium. DESIGN: Secondary analysis of data from the 1999-2004 NHANES. SUBJECTS/ SETTING: Participants 2 years of age and older. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Percentage of the population meeting current recommendations for calcium, potassium and magnesium. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Percentage of EAR/AI for nutrients was calculated based on age/gender specific values. All analyses were weighted using the NHANES six-year sample weights and adjusted for the complex sample design of NHANES with the statistical package SUDAAN. RESULTS: The most recent NHANES data demonstrated that a significant proportion of the American population did not meet recommendations for calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Less than 3% of the population consumed the recommended level or more of potassium. Only 30% of the US population 2 years of age and older obtained the recommended level of calcium or more and 55% consumed less than the EAR for magnesium. Recommending 3-4 servings from the dairy group for all people greater than 9 years of age may be necessary in order to ensure adequate intake of calcium and magnesium, assuming the current diet remains the same. More than 4 servings of dairy would be needed to meet the potassium recommendation at all ages. CONCLUSIONS: For those individuals who do not consume dairy products, we need to better understand the barriers to consuming specific dairy products. In addition, more research is needed to examine whether food-based recommendations are practical, feasible and cost effective to meet nutrient needs.",M2
19570885,"Expression and phosphorylation of the Na+-Cl- cotransporter NCC in vivo is regulated by dietary salt, <e>potassium</e>, and SGK1.The Na-Cl cotransporter NCC is expressed in the distal convoluted tubule, activated by phosphorylation, and has been implicated in renal NaCl and K(+) homeostasis. The serum and glucocorticoid inducible kinase 1 (SGK1) contributes to renal NaCl retention and K(+) excretion, at least in part, by stimulating the epithelial Na(+) channel and Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase in the downstream segments of aldosterone-sensitive Na(+)/K(+) exchange. In this study we confirmed in wild-type mice (WT) that dietary NaCl restriction increases renal NCC expression and its phosphorylation at Thr(53), Thr(58), and Ser(71), respectively. This response, however, was attenuated in mice lacking SGK1 (Sgk1(-/-)), which may contribute to impaired NaCl retention in those mice. Total renal NCC expression and phosphorylation at Thr(53), Thr(58), and Ser(71) in WT were greater under low- compared with high-K(+) diet. This finding is consistent with a regulation of NCC to modulate Na(+) delivery to downstream segments of Na(+)/K(+) exchange, thereby modulating K(+) excretion. Dietary K(+)-dependent variation in renal expression of total NCC and phosphorylated NCC were not attenuated in Sgk1(-/-) mice. In fact, high-K(+) diet-induced NCC suppression was enhanced in Sgk1(-/-) mice. The hyperkalemia induced in Sgk1(-/-) mice by a high-K(+) diet may have augmented NCC suppression, thereby increasing Na(+) delivery and facilitating K(+) excretion in downstream segments of impaired Na(+)/K(+) exchange. In summary, changes in NaCl and K(+) intake altered NCC expression and phosphorylation, an observation consistent with a role of NCC in NaCl and K(+) homeostasis. The two maneuvers dissociated plasma aldosterone levels from NCC expression and phosphorylation, implicating additional regulators. Regulation of NCC expression and phosphorylation by dietary NaCl restriction appears to involve SGK1.",M2
19560875,"Hypothetical hormonal mechanism by which <e>potassium</e>-rich diets benefit patients with rheumatoid arthritis.Patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) have significantly lower salivary and serum potassium (K) concentration, reduced total body K, and lower dietary K intake than healthy subjects. There may also be a subtle impairment in the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in patients with RA with both a poor cortisol secretion response as well as a lower adrenocorticotropin hormone (ACTH) response in relation to involved inflammatory factors. Patients with RA also exhibit an impaired Na+, K+-ATPase (NKA) activity which might promote the pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion seen in RA. I will use these facts to support the mechanism I propose. There are no qualitative differences between the effects of endogenous cortisol and exogenously applied synthetic glucocorticoids (GCs), which are widely used to treat RA. All effects are transmitted via the same receptor. The GC, cortisol, plays a role in normal K homeostasis and the reverse is also seen with higher K intake leading to higher cortisol secretion and biosynthesis. Results of a recent clinical trial showed elevated serum cortisol followed K supplementation. I suggest that this is what alleviated RA symptoms. I would like to suggest a  Cortisol-K  theory as a mechanism for De Coti-Marsh's proposed  K theory  while not precluding the possibility of eventual proof of a cure, possibly from effects of K inside cells other than the adrenal glands.",M2
19515740,"Relations between protein intake and blood pressure in Japanese men and women: the Circulatory Risk in Communities Study (CIRCS).BACKGROUND: An inverse association between protein intake and blood pressure has been reported in Western countries. However, the evidence is limited for Asians, whose protein sources are different from those in Western populations. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the association between protein intake and blood pressure in Japanese adults. Methods: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study of 7585 subjects (3499 men and 4086 women) from 40 to 69 y of age living in 5 communities in Japan. Dietary intakes of total, animal, and plant protein were estimated by a single 24-h dietary recall. We then examined the associations between dietary intake of those proteins and blood pressure after adjustment for age, sex, community, body mass index, antihypertensive medication use, ethanol intake, smoking, and dietary intakes of sodium, <e>potassium</e>, and calcium. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, a 25.5-g/d increment in total protein intake was associated with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 1.14 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure of 0.65 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001), and a 19.9-g/d increment in animal protein intake was associated with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 1.09 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure of 0.41 mm Hg (P = 0.003). A 13.1-g/d increment in plant protein intake was associated with a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 0.57 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001). Further adjustment for nutritional factors weakened these associations, but the inverse associations of total protein intake with diastolic blood pressure and of animal protein intake with systolic blood pressure remained statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Total and animal protein intakes were inversely associated with blood pressure in Japanese adults.",M2
19468946,"Effect of buckwheat flour on cooking quality and some chemical, antinutritional and sensory properties of erişte, Turkish noodle.In this study, wheat flour used in erişte production was replaced with whole buckwheat flour (BWF) up to a 40% level to improve the nutritional properties of erişte. The chemical composition, phytic acid content, color values, cooking quality and sensory properties of erişte samples were determined. High levels of BWF in erişte formulation increased the ash, cellulose and fat content when compared with a control made by wheat flour. The 40% BWF supplementation instead of wheat flour decreased the starch content from 65.4% to 58.4%. Increasing the BWF level in the erişte sample resulted in an expected increase (P&lt;0.05) in the phytic acid content and <e>potassium</e>, magnesium and phosphorus amounts. Significant decreases were observed in water uptake and volume increase values with BWF addition levels over 20%.

19462490,"Differential associations of dietary sodium and <e>potassium</e>  intake with blood pressure: a focus on pulse pressure.OBJECTIVE: Dietary sodium and potassium intakes are factors known to influence blood pressure (BP) through different pathways. These mechanisms likely result in differential effects on parameters characterizing BP. The aim of the study was to evaluate relationships between both sodium and potassium intake and all BP parameters--namely systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)--simultaneously in a large general population. METHODS: The present cross-sectional analysis was performed on 4919 middle-aged men and women, participants in the SU.VI.MAX study. Dietary intake was assessed through at least three 24-h dietary records. SBP and DBP were measured twice at a single visit after 10 min rest and averaged. Analysis of covariance was used to test for difference in BP parameters across tertiles of dietary sodium and potassium intakes. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, increased dietary sodium and potassium intakes were both significantly associated with increased BP parameters (P &lt; 0.0001). After relevant adjustments, sodium intake remained positively associated with PP (P = 0.006), whereas potassium intake became negatively associated with SBP, DBP and MAP (P &lt; or = 0.02) but was not linked to PP (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: The positive association between dietary sodium intake and PP observed in the present study provides further evidence for the current concept linking sodium to rise in BP through modification and stiffening of the arterial wall, whereas negative associations between dietary potassium intake and both SBP and DBP, hence MAP, support the vasodilator properties of this latter nutrient.",M2
19458124,"<e>Potassium</e> restriction, high protein intake, and metabolic acidosis increase expression of the glutamine transporter SNAT3 (Slc38a3) in mouse kidney.Kidneys produce ammonium to buffer and excrete acids through metabolism of glutamine. Expression of the glutamine transporter Slc38a3 (SNAT3) increases in kidney during metabolic acidosis (MA), suggesting a role during ammoniagenesis. Potassium depletion and high dietary protein intake are known to elevate renal ammonium excretion. In this study, we examined SNAT3, phosphate-dependent glutaminase (PDG), and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) regulation during a control (0.36%) or low-K(+) (0.02%) diet for 7 or 14 days or a control (20%) or high-protein (50%) diet for 7 days. MA was induced in control and low-K(+) groups by addition of NH(4)Cl. Urinary ammonium excretion increased during MA, after 14-day K(+) restriction alone, and during high protein intake. SNAT3, PDG, and PEPCK mRNA abundance were elevated during MA and after 14-day K(+) restriction but not during high protein intake. SNAT3 protein abundance was enhanced during MA (both control and low K(+)), after 14-day low-K(+) treatment alone, and during high protein intake. Seven-day dietary K(+) depletion alone had no effect. Immunohistochemistry showed SNAT3 staining in earlier parts of the proximal tubule during 14-day K(+) restriction with and without NH(4)Cl treatment and during high protein intake. In summary, SNAT3, PDG, and PEPCK mRNA expression were congruent with urinary ammonium excretion during MA. Chronic dietary K(+) restriction, high protein intake, and MA enhance ammoniagenesis, an effect that may involve enhanced SNAT3 mRNA and protein expression. Our data suggest that SNAT3 plays an important role as the glutamine uptake mechanism in ammoniagenesis under these conditions.",M2
19277820,"Investigation of common Indian edible salts suitable for kidney disease by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy.Salt is an essential and important dietary mineral for maintaining life. Currently, the issue of the potential benefit or damage from salt intake in chronic kidney disease patients is controversial. The attempt of this article is to bring into focus the potential role of elements particularly sodium, Na, and <e>potassium</e>, K, which are the main constituents of dietary salts, in kidney patients by using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). LIBS spectra of different salt samples have been recorded in the spectral region 200-500 nm with spectral resolution 0.1 nm and in the spectral region 200-900 nm with spectral resolution 0.75 nm. Quantitative elemental study was carried out to determine the constituents of different types of common Indian edible salts by using the calibration-free LIBS method. Our experimental results demonstrate that Saindha salt (commonly known as rock salt) is more beneficial than other edible salts for patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. The results of the quantitative elemental analysis of the salts obtained from LIBS measurements are also compared to atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).",M2
19274594,"Preliminary assessment of nutritional value of plant-based diets in relation to human nutrients.In this research, we present preliminary nutritional data for traditional vegetables and fruits including their content of mineral elements (calcium, <e>potassium</e>, sodium, zinc, and iron) and antioxidant phenolic compounds levels. Eight vegetables and vegetables were studied. Plant foods Asparagus officinalis DC, Chlorophytum comosum Linn., Cordia myxa Roxb., Portulaca oleracia Linn. and Solanum indicum Linn. were collected in Behbehan, south Iran, and also Alocacia indica Sch., Eulophia ocherata Lindl. and Momordica dioica Roxb. were collected from the south of India. Nutrients were measured with food analytical standard methods. The results of this study provide evidence that these local traditional vegetables, which do not require formal cultivation, could be important contributors to improving the nutritional content of Pune and Behbehan people. Results indicate that 50% of the vegetables have significant energy values ranging from 281.4 to 303.9 kcal/100 g. From this study, it was determined that five vegetables, namely A. officinalis, C. comosum, E. ocherata, P. oleracia and S. indicum, provide mineral concentrations exceeding 2% of the plant dry weight and are much higher than typical mineral concentrations in conventional edible vegetables; they are thus recommended for future commercial cultivation.

19248857,"Supplement use contributes to meeting recommended dietary intakes for calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C in four ethnicities of middle-aged and older Americans: the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis.BACKGROUND: Low intake of nutrients is associated with poor health outcomes. We examined the contribution of dietary supplementation to meeting recommended dietary intakes of calcium, magnesium, <e>potassium</e>, and vitamin C in participants of the Multi-Ethnic Study of Atherosclerosis, a cohort of white, African-American, Hispanic, and Chinese-American participants ages 45 to 84 years. We also assessed the prevalence of intakes above Tolerable Upper Intake Levels (ULs). METHODS: At the baseline exam in 2000-2001, 2,938 men and 3,299 women completed food frequency questionnaires and provided information about dietary supplementation. We used relative risk regression to estimate the probability of meeting Recommended Dietary Allowances (RDAs) or Adequate Intakes (AIs) in supplement users vs nonusers and Fisher's exact tests to compare the proportion of those exceeding ULs between the two groups. RDAs, AIs, and ULs were defined by the National Academy of Sciences Food and Nutrition Board's Dietary Reference Intakes (DRIs). RESULTS: After adjustment for age and education, the relative risk of meeting RDAs or AIs in supplement-users vs nonusers ranged from 1.9 (1.6, 2.3) in white men to 5.7 (4.1, 8.0) in African-American women for calcium, from 2.5 (1.9, 3.3) in Hispanic men to 5.2 (2.4, 11.2) in Chinese men for magnesium, and from 1.4 (1.3, 1.5) in African-American women to 2.0 (1.7, 2.2) in Chinese men for vitamin C. The relative risks for meeting RDAs for calcium differed significantly by ethnicity (P&lt;0.001) and sex (P&lt;0.001), and by ethnicity for magnesium (P=0.01). The relative risk for each sex/ethnicity strata was close to 1 and did not reach statistical significance at alpha=.05 for potassium. For calcium, 15% of high-dose supplement users exceeded the UL compared with only 2.1% of nonusers. For vitamin C, the percentages were 6.6% and 0%, and for magnesium, 35.3% and 0% (P&lt;0.001 for all). CONCLUSIONS: Although supplement use is associated with meeting DRI guidelines for calcium, vitamin C and magnesium, many adults are not meeting the DRI guidelines even with the help of dietary supplements, and the effect of supplementation can vary according to ethnicity and sex. However, supplementation was not significantly associated with meeting DRIs for potassium. Also, high-dose supplement use is associated with intakes above ULs for calcium, magnesium, and vitamin C.",M2
19209185,"Metabolic and physiologic improvements from consuming a paleolithic, hunter-gatherer type diet.BACKGROUND: The contemporary American diet figures centrally in the pathogenesis of numerous chronic diseases-'diseases of civilization'. We investigated in humans whether a diet similar to that consumed by our preagricultural hunter-gatherer ancestors (that is, a paleolithic type diet) confers health benefits. METHODS: We performed an outpatient, metabolically controlled study, in nine nonobese sedentary healthy volunteers, ensuring no weight loss by daily weight. We compared the findings when the participants consumed their usual diet with those when they consumed a paleolithic type diet. The participants consumed their usual diet for 3 days, three ramp-up diets of increasing <e>potassium</e> and fiber for 7 days, then a paleolithic type diet comprising lean meat, fruits, vegetables and nuts, and excluding nonpaleolithic type foods, such as cereal grains, dairy or legumes, for 10 days. Outcomes included arterial blood pressure (BP); 24-h urine sodium and potassium excretion; plasma glucose and insulin areas under the curve (AUC) during a 2 h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT); insulin sensitivity; plasma lipid concentrations; and brachial artery reactivity in response to ischemia. RESULTS: Compared with the baseline (usual) diet, we observed (a) significant reductions in BP associated with improved arterial distensibility (-3.1+/-2.9, P=0.01 and +0.19+/-0.23, P=0.05);(b) significant reduction in plasma insulin vs time AUC, during the OGTT (P=0.006); and (c) large significant reductions in total cholesterol, low-density lipoproteins (LDL) and triglycerides (-0.8+/-0.6 (P=0.007), -0.7+/-0.5 (P=0.003) and -0.3+/-0.3 (P=0.01) mmol/l respectively). In all these measured variables, either eight or all nine participants had identical directional responses when switched to paleolithic type diet, that is, near consistently improved status of circulatory, carbohydrate and lipid metabolism/physiology. CONCLUSIONS: Even short-term consumption of a paleolithic type diet improves BP and glucose tolerance, decreases insulin secretion, increases insulin sensitivity and improves lipid profiles without weight loss in healthy sedentary humans.",M2

METHODS: Two trials of sodium reduction and other interventions collected 24-hour urinary excretions intermittently during 18 months from September 17, 1987, to January 12, 1990 (Trials of Hypertension Prevention [TOHP] I), and during 36 months from December 18, 1990, to April 7, 1995 (TOHP II), among adults with prehypertension aged 30 to 54 years. Among adults not assigned to an active sodium reduction intervention, we assessed the relationship of a mean of 3 to 7 twenty-four-hour urinary excretions of sodium and potassium and their ratio with subsequent CVD (stroke, myocardial infarction, coronary revascularization, or CVD mortality) through 10 to 15 years of posttrial follow-up. RESULTS: Among 2974 participants, follow-up information was obtained on 2275 participants (76.5%), with 193 CVD events. After adjustment for baseline variables and lifestyle changes, there was a nonsignificant trend in CVD risk across sex-specific quartiles of urinary sodium excretion (rate ratio [RR] from lowest to highest, 1.00, 0.99, 1.16, and 1.20; P = .38 for trend) and potassium excretion (RR, 1.00, 0.94, 0.91, and 0.64; P = .08 for trend) but a significant trend across quartiles of the sodium to potassium excretion ratio (RR, 1.00, 0.84, 1.18, and 1.50; P = .04 for trend). In models containing both measures simultaneously, linear effects were as follows: RR, 1.42; 95% confidence interval (CI), 0.99 to 2.04 per 100 mmol/24 h of urinary sodium excretion (P = .05); and 0.67; 0.41 to 1.10 per 50 mmol/24 h of urinary potassium excretion (P = .12). A model containing the sodium to potassium excretion ratio (RR, 1.24; 95% CI, 1.05-1.46; P = .01) had the lowest Bayes information criterion (best fit). CONCLUSION: A higher sodium to potassium excretion ratio is associated with increased risk of subsequent CVD, with an effect stronger than that of sodium or potassium alone.",M2
19115121,"Application of multivariate statistical techniques for differentiation of ripe banana flour based on the composition of elements.Major (sodium, <e>potassium</e>, calcium, magnesium) and minor elements (iron, copper, zinc, manganese) and one heavy metal (lead) of Cavendish banana flour and Dream banana flour were determined, and data were analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques of factor analysis and discriminant analysis. Factor analysis yielded four factors explaining more than 81% of the total variance: the first factor explained 28.73%, comprising magnesium, sodium, and iron; the second factor explained 21.47%, comprising only manganese and copper; the third factor explained 15.66%, comprising zinc and lead; while the fourth factor explained 15.50%, comprising potassium. Discriminant analysis showed that magnesium and sodium exhibited a strong contribution in discriminating the two types of banana flour, affording 100% correct assignation. This study presents the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques for analysis and interpretation of complex mineral content data from banana flour of different varieties.",M2
19073823,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid activates BK channels in the cortical collecting duct.The cortical collecting duct (CCD), which is involved in renal <e>potassium</e> (K) excretion, expresses cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxygenase. Here, we examined the effect of high dietary K on renal expression of CYP2C23 and CYP2J2 in the rat, as well as the role of CYP-epoxygenase-dependent metabolism of arachidonic acid in the regulation of Ca(2+)-activated big-conductance K (BK) channels. By Western blot analysis, high dietary K stimulated the expression of CYP2C23 but not CYP2J2 and increased 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) levels in isolated rat CCD tubules. Application of arachidonic acid increased BK channel activity, and this occurred to a greater extent in rats on a high-K diet compared with a normal-K diet. This effect was unlikely due to arachidonic acid-induced changes in membrane fluidity, because 11,14,17-eicosatrienoic acid did not alter BK channel activity. Inhibiting CYP-epoxygenase but not cyclooxygenase- or CYP-omega-hydroxylase-dependent pathways completely abolished the stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid on BK channel activity. In addition, application of 11,12-EET mimicked the effect of arachidonic acid on BK channel activity, even in the presence of CYP-epoxygenase inhibition. This effect seemed specific to 11,12-EET, because both 8,9- and 14,15-EET failed to stimulate BK channels. Finally, inhibition of CYP-epoxygenase abolished iberiotoxin-sensitive and flow-stimulated but not basal net K secretion in isolated microperfused CCD. In conclusion, high dietary K stimulates the renal CYP-epoxygenase pathway, which plays an important role in activating BK channels and flow-stimulated K secretion in the CCD.",M2

Information on dietary intake was collected from 90 preschool children (15 boys and 15 girls each in the 3-, 4- and 5-year old groups) on 3 separate days in the school fiscal year 1999 (April 1999 to March 2000) by the duplicate-diet technique. The Ca, Mg, K, and Na concentrations were determined by atomic absorption spectrometry using wet-ashed samples. The medians of mean daily intakes of Ca, Mg, K and Na in 3- to 5-year-old children were 432 mg, 110 mg, 1.18 g and 1.60 g, respectively, and no significant differences with regard to gender were observed. Seasonal varia-tion of intake was seen for each mineral. Calcium intake in most preschool children did not meet adequate intake (AI), probably due to low intakes of milk and dairy products in Japan. Magnesium intake was below the estimated average requirement (EAR) in 13.3% of the subjects, while the K intake met the AI. Sodium intake in a quarter of preschool children exceeded the tentative dietary goal. We concluded that in Japanese children aged 3-5 years; Ca intake is low, Na intake is high, and K intake is adequate, but some children could be at risk for Mg deficiency.",M2
18788465,"Are all individuals equally sensitive in the blood pressure to high salt intake? (Review article).It has been reported that only one-third of normotensive subjects and half of hypertensive patients are salt-sensitive. Many causes of salt-sensitivity have been proposed. Our suggestion is that a reduced urinary kallikrein level may be one cause, since mutant kininogen-deficient rats, which cannot generate kinin in the urine, are salt-sensitive. Renal kallikrein is secreted by the connecting tubule cells of the kidney, which are located just distal to the macula densa or the tubuloglomerular feedback system. Excess amounts of sodium taken overflow into the distal tubules and are reabsorbed in the collecting ducts. Kinins generated inhibit sodium reabsorption in the collecting ducts. Both blacks and whites with essential hypertension excrete less urinary kallikrein than do their normotensive counterparts, but the mean value in  normotensive blacks  were not different from that in  hypertensive whites . African-Americans consume less <e>potassium</e> than whites. Potassium and ATP-sensitive potassium channel blockers are releasers of renal kallikrein. In a small-scale study, sodium loading caused more increase in the systolic blood pressure in urinary low-kallikrein group than in urinary high-kallikrein group. Large-scale clinical studies, under strict control of potassium intake, are needed to elucidate the relationship between salt-sensitivity and urinary kallikrein levels.",M2
18721742,"Fast food, phosphorus-containing additives, and the renal diet.OBJECTIVE: Fast food is commonly consumed by hemodialysis patients, but many menu items are not compatible with renal diets because of their sodium, <e>potassium</e>, or phosphorus content. Moreover, the phosphorus content of fast foods is difficult for patients to estimate, because phosphorus-containing additives are commonly added to many fast foods. We sought to determine how many fast-food entrees and side dishes are compatible with renal diets. METHODS: We examined nutrition-facts labels and ingredient lists provided by 15 fast-food chains. Each entree and side dish was first assessed according to traditional criteria (limited sodium, potassium, and naturally occurring phosphorus content), and then according to the presence of a phosphorus -containing additive. RESULTS: Of 804 total entrees across all restaurants, 415 (52%) were acceptable according to traditional criteria, but only 128 (16%) were also free of phosphorus-containing additives. Of 163 total side dishes, 37 (23%) were acceptable according to traditional criteria, and 27 (17%) were also free of phosphorus-containing additives. There were no acceptable entrees at 3 chains, and no acceptable side dishes at 5 chains. CONCLUSION: Only a small proportion of fast-food entrees and side dishes are compatible with renal diets. The widespread use of phosphorus-containing additives is a major impediment to the availability of acceptable fast-food choices for hemodialysis patients. We recommend limiting the use of phosphorus-containing additives, and including phosphorus content in nutrition-facts labels.",M2

18614741,"Relations between dietary sodium and <e>potassium</e> intakes and mortality from cardiovascular disease: the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risks.BACKGROUND: Limited evidence is available about the relations between sodium and potassium intakes and cardiovascular disease in the general population. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate relations between sodium and potassium intakes and cardiovascular disease in Asian populations whose mean sodium intake is generally high. DESIGN: Between 1988 and 1990, a total of 58,730 Japanese subjects (n = 23,119 men and 35,611 women) aged 40-79 y with no history of stroke, coronary heart disease, or cancer completed a lifestyle questionnaire including food intake frequency under the Japan Collaborative Cohort Study for Evaluation of Cancer Risk sponsored by the Ministry of Education, Sports and Science. RESULTS: After 745,161 person-years of follow-up, we documented 986 deaths from stroke (153 subarachnoid hemorrhages, 227 intraparenchymal hemorrhages, and 510 ischemic strokes) and 424 deaths from coronary heart disease. Sodium intake was positively associated with mortality from total stroke, ischemic stroke, and total cardiovascular disease. The multivariable hazard ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of sodium intake after adjustment for age, sex, and cardiovascular disease risk factors was 1.55 (95% CI: 1.21, 2.00; P for trend &lt; 0.001) for total stroke, 2.04 (95% CI: 1.41, 2.94; P for trend &lt; 0.001) for ischemic stroke, and 1.42 (95% CI: 1.20, 1.69; P for trend &lt; 0.001) for total cardiovascular disease. Potassium intake was inversely associated with mortality from coronary heart disease and total cardiovascular disease. The multivariable hazard ratio for the highest versus the lowest quintiles of potassium intake was 0.65 (95% CI: 0.39, 1.06; P for trend = 0.083) for coronary heart disease and 0.73 (95% CI: 0.59, 0.92; P for trend = 0.018) for total cardiovascular disease, and these associations were more evident for women than for men.

18460480,"Contribution of dairy products to dietary <e>potassium</e> intake in the United States population.OBJECTIVE: Adequate dietary potassium intake is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular and other chronic diseases. The Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 identifies milk and milk products as a major contributor of dietary potassium and lists dairy products, along with fruits and vegetables, as food groups to encourage. This paper further examines the impact of dairy consumption on the potassium intake of the United States (US) population. METHODS: Using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999-2002 we determined potassium intakes for various age groups of individuals who met the recommended number of dairy servings compared to those who did not. We also examined the impact of dairy servings consumed on mean and median potassium intakes and compared intakes to the age-appropriate Adequate Intakes (AI). RESULTS: For all age groups, mean and median potassium intakes did not meet the respective AI. Mean potassium intakes were significantly greater in those subjects who met dairy intake recommendations compared to those who did not for all age groups. Mean and median potassium intakes increased with increasing dairy intake but were below current intake recommendations for all age groups analyzed. For adults age 19 to 50, 16.1% consumed the recommended number of dairy servings per day. For those 51 and older, 10.7% met current dairy intake recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: Consumption of dairy products is below current recommendations which contributes in part to suboptimal dietary potassium intakes among a large proportion of the US population. Since adequate potassium intake is associated with decreased risk of chronic disease, consumption of a variety of potassium-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables and low-fat and fat free dairy products, should continue to be encouraged.",M2

18375219,"Drinking flavored or plain milk is positively associated with nutrient intake and is not associated with adverse effects on weight status in US children and adolescents.OBJECTIVE: Little research has been conducted on health effects associated with consumption of flavored milk. The purposes of this study were to compare nutrient intakes and body measures among children and adolescents drinking flavored milk (with or without plain milk), exclusively plain milk, and no milk. DESIGN: Data used in the study included intakes reported in 24-hour dietary recalls and height and weight measurements collected during a physical examination in the 1999--2002 National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys. The milk drinking status of each person was identified, and nutrient intakes and body mass index (BMI) measures were determined by milk drinking status. SUBJECTS: The study population included 7,557 children and adolescents aged 2 to 18 years. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Comparisons among mean milk intakes, energy and nutrient intakes, and BMI measures by milk drinking status were completed using linear regression analysis. RESULTS: Children and adolescents who included flavored milk in their diets reported higher total milk intakes than consumers of exclusively plain milk (P&lt;0.05). Intakes of vitamin A, calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, <e>potassium</e>, and saturated fat (adjusted for energy intake and age) were generally comparable among milk drinking groups, whereas intakes by milk nondrinkers were significantly lower (P&lt;0.05). Among females aged 12 to 18 years, calcium intakes by flavored and exclusively plain milk drinkers were 992+/-41.5 and 1,038+/-22.5 mg/day, respectively, whereas intake by nondrinkers was 576+/-11.7 mg/day. Intake of added sugars did not differ between flavored milk drinkers and milk nondrinkers. BMI measures of milk drinkers were comparable to or lower than measures of nondrinkers (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study suggest that consumption of either flavored or plain milk is associated with a positive influence on nutrient intakes by children and adolescents and is not associated with adverse effects on BMI measures.",M2
18311071,"Urinary kallikrein and blood pressure--gender-different response to <e>potassium</e> supplementation in SHR. Role of aldosterone.AIMS: To test whether blood pressure is affected by potassium supplementation which modifies urinary kallikrein (UK) in SHR of either sex, and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. DESIGN: In SHR and WKY blood pressure, renal function and hormonal profile were studied after 1% oral potassium supplementation starting at 4 weeks of age and throughout until 12 weeks of age. Results were compared with those of untreated SHR and WKY of either sex. RESULTS: Systolic blood pressure (mm Hg) started to rise in SHR and was significantly different at 6-8 weeks of age: 153.5 +/- 7.9 versus 100 +/- 5.6 in female and 157 +/- 7.7 versus 98.4 +/- 6.8 in male rats (p &lt; 0.01). Systolic blood pressure increased progressively in female and male rats reaching 164.5 +/- 4.8 and 204.5 +/- 7.6, respectively, at 12 weeks of age. At this time systolic blood pressure was higher in male than in female SHR (p &lt; 0.01) and UK activity (UKa; nkat/day/100 g body weight) was slightly lower in male SHR. After 1% oral potassium supplementation administered from 4 to 12 weeks of age, a decrease in systolic blood pressure was seen in male SHR: 204.5 +/- 7.6 versus 173.5 +/- 7.9 (p &lt; 0.05); and 164.5 +/- 4.8 versus 156.8 +/- 5.5 in female rats (NS) at 12 weeks of age, concomitant with an increase in UKa, particularly in male rats (29.35 +/- 1.92 versus 36.54 +/- 2.61, p &lt; 0.05). As expected, plasma aldosterone (pg/ml), increased markedly after potassium treatment from 129 +/- 31.4 in untreated female and male SHR and WKY to 528 +/- 180.7 in SHR and 473 +/- 88.4 in WKY (p &lt; 0.05 in both cases). After potassium supplementation, potassium excretion was significantly correlated with both aldosterone levels and UKa (p &lt; 0.001 in both cases). No significantly concurrent changes in plasma renin activity were observed, but instead a significant decrease was seen in SHR (p &lt; 0.01). The potassium blood pressure-lowering effect was blunted by aldosterone receptor antagonist treatment that also decreased UKa from 36.5 +/- 2.61 to 19.5 +/- 1.9, particularly in male SHR. No attempt was made in this experimental setting to block kallikrein or kinin receptors. CONCLUSIONS: UKa increases as a consequence of aldosterone stimulation by potassium load since an aldosterone receptor blockade abolishes UKa increment and blood pressure fall. These results further support the hypothesis that the kallikrein kinin system plays a role in blood pressure regulation and they also show a gender different response to potassium load in relation to UKa and blood pressure.",M2
18231119,"Estimated net endogenous acid production and intake of bone health-related nutrients in Hong Kong Chinese adolescents.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: To examine the daily intake of bone health-related nutrients and to explore the association between diet composition and estimated net endogenous acid production (estimated NEAP) in Hong Kong Chinese adolescents. SUBJECT/METHODS: In total, 171 boys and 180 girls aged 10-12 years of Chinese origin from nine primary schools from the Hong Kong Adolescent Bone Health Cohort Study. The study design used food frequency questionnaire. Mean daily intakes of foods and selected nutrients were estimated. Mean percentage of nutrient intake contributed by different food groups was presented. Frassetto's method was used to calculate the estimated NEAP from the diet's protein to <e>potassium</e> ratio. RESULTS: There was no significant difference in the energy-adjusted intakes of most nutrients between boys and girls, except for intakes of vitamins C and D. Mean protein, sodium and potassium intakes were higher than the Chinese dietary reference intake (DRI), whereas mean intakes of magnesium, calcium and vitamin D were lower than the DRI. Boys had significantly higher estimated NEAP than girls (P=0.0051). Estimated NEAP was significantly positively correlated with meat intake and negatively associated with the consumption of fruits, vegetables, legumes, beverages and dairy products. CONCLUSIONS: The results highlight the importance of considering whole diet quality when interpreting the effects of single nutrient or diet's net acid load on bone. The effect on high protein intake and low fruit and vegetable intake on the long-term bone health of Hong Kong Chinese adolescents warrants attention.",M2
18158352,"Protective effect of dietary <e>potassium</e> against vascular injury in salt-sensitive hypertension.Hypertensive cardiovascular damage is accelerated by salt loading but counteracted by dietary potassium supplementation. We suggested recently that antioxidant actions of potassium contribute to protection against salt-induced cardiac dysfunction. Therefore, we examined whether potassium supplementation ameliorated cuff-induced vascular injury in salt-sensitive hypertension via suppression of oxidative stress. Four-week-old Dahl salt-sensitive rats were fed a normal-salt (0.3% NaCl), high-salt (8% NaCl), or high-salt plus high-potassium (8% KCl) diet for 5 weeks, and some of the rats fed a high-salt diet were also given antioxidants. One week after the start of the treatments, a silicone cuff was implanted around the femoral artery. Examination revealed increased cuff-induced neointimal proliferation with adventitial macrophage infiltration in arteries from salt-loaded Dahl salt-sensitive rats compared with that in arteries from non-salt-loaded animals (intima/media ratio: 0.471+/-0.070 versus 0.302+/-0.037; P&lt;0.05), associated with regional superoxide overproduction and reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activation and mRNA overexpression. On the other hand, simultaneous potassium supplementation attenuated salt-induced neointimal hyperplasia (intima/media ratio: 0.205+/-0.012; P&lt;0.001), adventitial macrophage infiltration, superoxide overproduction, and reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase activation and overexpression. Antioxidants, which decrease vascular oxidative stress, also reduced neointima formation induced by salt excess. In conclusion, high-potassium diets seems to have a protective effect against the development of vascular damage induced by salt loading mediated, at least in part, through suppression of the production of reactive oxygen species probably generated by reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase.",M2
17928827,"Thiazide-induced subtle renal injury not observed in states of equivalent hypokalemia.Hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) is used to manage hypertension and heart failure; however, its side effects include mild hypokalemia, metabolic abnormalities, and volume depletion, which might have deleterious effects on renal and endothelial function. We studied whether HCTZ cause renal injury and/or altered vasoreactivity and if these changes are hypokalemia-dependent. Rats were given a normal diet or a diet moderately low in <e>potassium</e> K+ with or without HCTZ. Animals fed either a low K+ diet alone or HCTZ developed mild hypokalemia. There was no significant difference in systolic blood pressure in the different treatment groups. All three groups with hypokalemia had mild proteinuria; low K(+)-HCTZ rats had reduced creatinine clearance. HCTZ-treated rats displayed hypomagnesemia, hypertriglyceridemia, hyperglycemia, insulin resistance, and hyperaldosteronism. No renal injury was observed in the groups without HCTZ; however, increased kidney weight, glomerular ischemia, medullary injury, and cortical oxidative stress were seen with HCTZ treatment. Endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was reduced in all hypokalemic groups and correlated with reduced serum K+, serum, and urine nitric oxide. Our results show that HCTZ is associated with greater renal injury for the same degree of hypokalemia as the low K+ diet, suggesting that factors such as chronic ischemia and hyperaldosteronism due to volume depletion may be responsible agents. We also found impaired endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation was linked to mild hypokalemia.",M2

17622260,"Sodium intake in infancy and blood pressure at 7 years: findings from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children.BACKGROUND: Infancy may be a sensitive period regarding effects of sodium intake on future blood pressure (BP). This has only been demonstrated in one randomized trial of low sodium formulae with follow-up in adolescence in one-third of participants. OBJECTIVE: To prospectively assess associations between sodium intake in infancy and BP at 7 years in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). SUBJECTS: A total of 533 children with sodium data at 4 months and 710 children with sodium at 8 months. RESULTS: 0.4% of participants at 4 months and 73.0% at 8 months exceeded recommended levels for infant sodium intake. After minimal adjustment (child age, sex, energy), sodium intake at 4 months was positively associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) at 7 years (beta=0.54 mm Hg/mmol; 95% CI: 0.09, 0.98 mm Hg; P=0.02). This changed little following adjustment for confounders but attenuated after adjusting for breastfeeding. This association was not mediated by sodium intake at 7 years. Due to high sodium-<e>potassium</e> correlations, effects of sodium independent of potassium could not be estimated with reasonable precision. Sodium intake neither at 8 months nor at 7 years was associated with SBP at 7 years. CONCLUSION: The association between sodium intake at 4 months and future SBP requires replication in studies that can control for effects of potassium before we can conclude that early infancy is a sensitive period with respect to effects of sodium on future BP. The majority of infants exceeded recommended levels of sodium intake at 8 months, and interventions to reduce sodium in infants' diets should be considered.",M2
17485599,"Heritability of blood pressure responses to dietary sodium and <e>potassium</e> intake in a Chinese population.The heritability of blood pressure responses to dietary intervention has not been well studied. We examined the heritability of blood pressure responses to dietary sodium and potassium intake in a family feeding study among 1906 study participants living in rural North China. The dietary intervention included a 7-day low-sodium feeding (51.3 mmol per day), a 7-day high-sodium feeding (307.8 mmol per day), and a 7-day high-sodium plus potassium supplementation (60 mmol per day). Blood pressure was measured 9 times during the 3-day baseline period preceding the intervention and also during the last 3 days of each intervention phase using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. Heritability was computed using maximum likelihood methods under a variance components model as implemented in the computer program SOLAR. The heritabilities of baseline blood pressure were 0.31 for systolic, 0.32 for diastolic, and 0.34 for mean arterial pressure. The heritabilities increased significantly under dietary intervention and were 0.49, 0.49, and 0.51 during low sodium; 0.47, 0.49, and 0.51 during high sodium; and 0.51, 0.52, and 0.53 during potassium supplementation for systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, respectively. The heritabilities for percentage of blood pressure responses to low sodium were 0.20, 0.21, and 0.23; to high-sodium were 0.22, 0.33, and 0.33; and to potassium supplementation were 0.24, 0.21, and 0.25 for systolic, diastolic, and mean arterial pressure, respectively.

The objectives of the Genetic Epidemiology Network of Salt Sensitivity (GenSalt) are to localize and identify genes related to blood pressure (BP) responses to dietary sodium and <e>potassium</e> intervention. GenSalt utilizes a family feeding-study design. Each family was ascertained through a proband with untreated prehypertension or stage-1 hypertension in rural China. A medical history, lifestyle risk factors and responses to cold pressor tests, were obtained at baseline visits while BP, weight, blood and urine specimens were collected at baseline and follow-up visits. The dietary intervention included a 7-day low-sodium feeding (51.3 mmol/day), a 7-day high-sodium feeding (307.8 mmol/day) and a 7-day high-sodium feeding with an oral potassium supplementation (60 mmol/day). Microsatellite markers for genome-wide linkage scan and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers in candidate genes will be genotyped. Overall, 3153 participants from 658 families were recruited for GenSalt. The mean systolic and diastolic BPs were 128.0 and 80.3, 111.6 and 71.0, 112.6 and 72.6, 106.6 and 65.3 and 136.7 and 75.0 mm Hg for probands, siblings, spouses, offspring and parents, respectively.

17409277,"Downregulation of renal TonEBP in hypokalemic rats.Hypokalemia causes a significant decrease in the tonicity of the renal medullary interstitium in association with reduced expression of sodium transporters in the distal tubule. We asked whether hypokalemia caused downregulation of the tonicity-responsive enhancer binding protein (TonEBP) transcriptional activator in the renal medulla due to the reduced tonicity. We found that the abundance of TonEBP decreased significantly in the outer and inner medullas of hypokalemic rats. Underlying mechanisms appeared different in the two regions because the abundance of TonEBP mRNA was lower in the outer medulla but unchanged in the inner medulla. Immunohistochemical examination of TonEBP revealed cell type-specific differences. TonEBP expression decreased dramatically in the outer and inner medullary collecting ducts, thick ascending limbs, and interstitial cells. In the descending and ascending thin limbs, TonEBP abundance decreased modestly. In the outer medulla, TonEBP shifted to the cytoplasm in the descending thin limbs. As expected, transcription of aldose reductase, a target of TonEBP, was decreased since the abundance of mRNA and protein was reduced. Downregulation of TonEBP appeared to have also contributed to reduced expression of aquaporin-2 and UT-A urea transporters in the renal medulla. In cultured cells, expression and activity of TonEBP were not affected by reduced <e>potassium</e> concentrations in the medium. These data support the view that medullary tonicity regulates expression and nuclear distribution of TonEBP in the renal medulla in cell type-specific manners.",M2
17381878,"Effects of plant food <e>potassium</e> salts (citrate, galacturonate or tartrate) on acid-base status and digestive fermentations in rats.Potassium (K) organic anion salts, such as potassium citrate or potassium malate in plant foods, may counteract low-grade metabolic acidosis induced by western diets, but little is known about the effect of other minor plant anions. Effects of K salts (chloride, citrate, galacturonate or tartrate) were thus studied on the mineral balance and digestive fermentations in groups of 6-week-old rats adapted to an acidogenic/5 % inulin diet. In all diet groups, substantial amounts of lactate and succinate were present in the caecum, besides SCFA. SCFA were poorly affected by K salts conditions. The KCl-supplemented diet elicited an accumulation of lactate in the caecum; whereas the lactate caecal pool was low in rats fed the potassium tartrate-supplemented (K TAR) diet. A fraction of tartrate (around 50 %) was recovered in urine of rats fed the K TAR diet. Potassium citrate and potassium galacturonate diets exerted a marked alkalinizing effect on urine pH and promoted a notable citraturia (around 0.5 micro mol/24 h). All the K organic anion salts counteracted Ca and Mg hyperexcretion in urine, especially potassium tartrate as to magnesuria. The present findings indicate that K salts of unabsorbed organic anions exert alkalinizing effects when metabolizable in the large intestine, even if K and finally available anions (likely SCFA) are not simultaneously bioavailable. Whether this observation is also relevant for a fraction of SCFA arising from dietary fibre breakdown (which represents the major organic anions absorbed in the digestive tract in man) deserves further investigation.",M2

RESULTS: Of the 95 cats, 18 (19%) had a history of congestive heart failure and 73 (77%) had no clinical signs of cardiac disease. Fifty-five percent (52/95) of cats had concurrent disease. Inappetance was reported in 38% (36/95) of all cats and in 72% (68/95) of cats with a history of congestive heart failure. Most (57% [54/95]) cats received treats or table scraps on a regular basis. Approximately half the cats were receiving orally administered medications, supplements, or both. Only 34% (32/68) of owners used food to administer medications to cats. Cats consumed more than the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) minimums for protein, sodium, potassium, and magnesium, and nearly all cats consumed more than the AAFCO minimum for fat. Daily nutrient intake was variable for all of the nutrients assessed. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Dietary intake in cats with cardiac disease was variable, but results for dietary supplement use, food use for medication administration, and treat feeding were different from those found in a similar study of dogs with cardiac disease. This information may be useful for treating and designing nutritional studies for cats with cardiac disease.",M2
17299459,"Misreporting of dietary energy, protein, <e>potassium</e> and sodium in relation to body mass index in young Japanese women.OBJECTIVE: Although under-reporting of dietary intake is more common in persons with a high body mass index (BMI), it is not well known whether or not misreporting is selective for different foods (and hence energy and nutrients), particularly in non-Western populations. We examined misreporting of dietary intake against biomarkers and its relation with BMI in young Japanese women. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SUBJECTS: A total of 353 female Japanese dietetic students aged 18-22 years (mean BMI: 21.4 kg/m(2), mean fat intake: 29.8% of energy). METHODS: Misreporting of dietary energy, protein, potassium and sodium (assessed by a self-administered diet history questionnaire) was examined against respective biomarkers (estimated energy expenditure and 24-h urinary excretion). Reporting accuracy was calculated as the ratio of reported intake to that estimated from corresponding biomarkers (complete accuracy: 1.00). RESULTS: Mean reporting accuracy of absolute intake (amount per day) varied considerably (0.86-1.14). Reporting accuracy of absolute intake decreased with increasing BMI (P for trend &lt;0.001). However, no association was observed between reporting accuracy of energy-adjusted values and BMI (P for trend &gt;0.15), indicating that BMI-dependent misreporting was canceled by energy adjustment. This was owing to positive correlation between the reporting accuracy of energy intake and that of absolute intake of the three nutrients (Pearson correlation coefficient: 0.49-0.67, P&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Although differential misreporting of absolute intake was associated with BMI, differential misreporting of energy-adjusted value was not. These findings support the use of energy-adjusted values in the investigation of diet-disease relationships among lean populations with a low-fat intake.",M2
17275582,"The evolution-informed optimal dietary <e>potassium</e> intake of human beings greatly exceeds current and recommended intakes.An organism best fits the environment described by its genes, an environment that prevailed during the time period (millions of years) when evolution naturally selected the genes of its ancestors-those who survived to pass on their genes. When an organism's current environment differs from its ancestral one, the environment's mismatch with the organism's genome may result in functional disadvantages for the organism. The genetically conditioned nutritional requirements of human beings established themselves over millions of years in which ancestral hominins, living as hunter-gatherers, ate a diet markedly different from that of agriculturally dependent contemporary human beings. In that context, we sought to quantify the ancestral-contemporary dietary difference with respect to the supply of one of the body's major mineral nutrients: potassium. In 159 retrojected Stone Age diets, human potassium intake averaged 400 +/- 125 mEq/d, which exceeds current and recommended intakes by more than a factor of 4. We accounted for the transition to the relatively potassium-poor modern diet by the fact that the modern diet has substantially replaced Stone Age amounts of potassium-rich plant foods (especially fruits, leafy greens, vegetable fruits, roots, and tubers), with energy-dense nutrient-poor foods (separated fats, oils, refined sugars, and refined grains), and with potassium-poor energy-rich plant foods (especially cereal grains) introduced by agriculture (circa 10,000 years ago). Given the fundamental physiologic importance of potassium, such a large magnitude of change in potassium intake invites the consideration in human beings of whether the quantitative values of potassium-influenced physiologic phenomena (eg, blood pressure, insulin and aldosterone secretion rates, and intracellular pH) currently viewed as normal, in fact disaccord with genetically conditioned norms. We discuss the potential implications of our findings in respect to human health and disease.",M2
17235174,"Effects of dietary cation-anion difference and <e>potassium</e> to sodium ratio on lactating dairy cows in hot weather.Forty-two lactating Holstein cows 188 +/- 59 d in milk were used in an 8-wk randomized complete block trial with a 2 x 3 factorial arrangement of treatments. The objective was to determine the effects of high dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) and K:Na ratio on milk yield and composition and blood acid-base chemistry. Treatments included DCAD concentrations of 45 or 60 mEq (Na + K -Cl)/100 g of feed dry matter and K:Na ratios of 2:1, 3:1, or 4:1. Mean DCAD values were later determined to be 41 and 58. Dry matter intake was similar across treatments. Yield of milk and energy corrected milk were lower for the 3:1 K:Na ratio compared with 2:1 and 4:1 ratios. Blood urea N was lower for the highest DCAD, suggesting that DCAD possibly reduced protein degradation or altered protein metabolism and retention. Mean temperature-humidity index was 75.6 for the duration of the trial, exceeding the critical value of 72 for all weeks during the treatment period. Cows maintained relatively normal body temperature with mean a.m. and p.m. body temperature of 38.5 and 38.7 degrees C, respectively. These body temperatures suggest that cows were not subject to extreme heat stress due to good environmental control. Results of this trial indicate that the greatest effect on milk yield occurs when either Na or K is primarily used to increase DCAD, with the lowest yield of energy-corrected milk at a 3:1 K:Na ratio (27.1 kg/d) compared with ratios of 2:1 (29.3 kg/d) and 4:1 (28.7 kg/d). Results also suggest that greater DCAD improves ruminal N metabolism or N utilization may be more efficient with a high DCAD.",M2

17049926,"Defining the nutritional status and dietary intake of older heart failure patients.BACKGROUND: Little information exists about diet in the management of heart failure. AIMS: To describe the nutritional and biochemical status, and the dietary intake of older heart failure patients. METHODS: Stable outpatients and patients with recent hospitalisation for decompensated heart failure were recruited. Anthropometric measurements, handgrip strength, biochemical values and echocardiography were recorded. Patients kept 7-day food diaries and completed questionnaires concerning food provision. RESULTS: Forty-five patients with a mean (S.D.) age of 80.8 (6.8) years were studied and classed according to the New York Heart Association (NYHA) (11% Class I, 27% Class II and 62% Class III). Mean (S.D.) body mass index (BMI) was 27.1 (5.4) kg/m(2) with 7% of patients having a BMI&lt;20 kg/m(2) and 56% with a BMI above 25 kg/m(2). 64% of participants failed to achieve the estimated average requirements for energy intake; 82% took more than 2 mg of sodium daily; and 18% had a <e>potassium</e> intake above 3500 mg/day.

16966580,"Salt loading on plasma asymmetrical dimethylarginine and the protective role of <e>potassium</e> supplement in normotensive salt-sensitive asians.Asymmetrical dimethylarginine (ADMA) is an endogenous inhibitor of NO synthase. Because endothelial NO pathway is compromised in patients with salt-sensitive hypertension, we investigated whether the plasma ADMA can be modulated by chronic salt loading in normotensive salt-sensitive persons and its relationship with NO, and we further determined whether or not dietary potassium supplementation can reverse them. Sixty normotensive subjects (aged 20 to 60 years) were selected from a rural community of Northern China. All of the people were sequentially maintained on a low-salt diet for 7 days (3 g/day, NaCl), then a high-salt diet for 7 days (18 g/day), and high-salt diet with potassium supplementation for another 7 days (4.5 g/day, KCl). After salt loading, the plasma ADMA concentrations increased significantly in salt-sensitive subjects (0.89+/-0.02 micromol/L versus 0.51+/-0.02 micromol/L; P&lt;0.05), whereas the plasma NOx levels reduced considerably (41.8+/-2.1 micromol/L versus 63.5+/-2.1 micromol/L; P&lt;0.01). All of the abnormalities normalized when dietary potassium were supplemented (0.52+/-0.03 micromol/L versus 0.89+/-0.02 micromol/L for ADMA and 58.1+/-0.9 micromol/L versus 41.8+/-2.1 micromol/L for NOx). Statistically significant correlations were found among plasma ADMA level, the mean blood pressure, and the level of NO after salt loading in normotensive salt sensitive individuals. Our study indicates that high dietary potassium intake reduces blood pressure and ADMA levels while increasing NO bioactivity in normotensive salt-sensitive but not salt-resistant Asian subjects after salt loading.",M2
16961683,"An evaluation of renal inpatient meals against Renal Nutrition Group standards.BACKGROUND: The Renal Nutrition Group (RNG) of the British Dietetic Association has developed standards for the nutritional composition of meals provided to renal patients in hospital. However, no data are available as to whether these are achievable. The purpose of this study was to determine whether renal inpatient meals can meet the standards set by the RNG. METHOD: A prospective 10-day weighed food analysis of hospital meals provided to renal patients was undertaken. Two sample meals were analysed at each mealtime to include (1) the most energy dense choice and (2) the most frequent patient choice (FPC). RESULTS: Energy dense choice meals achieved the standard for protein provision on 90% of days, but provided too little energy on 100% of days (for men) and on 30% of days (for women). Although daily standards for <e>potassium</e> were met on 70% of days, those for sodium and phosphate were exceeded. FPC meals met the daily standards for potassium, sodium and phosphate on at least 80% of days, but provided too little protein on 40% of days and too little energy on 100% of days (for men and women). CONCLUSION: The majority of hospital meals fail to meet the RNG standards. Problems exist in providing sufficient energy and protein whilst restricting sodium, potassium and phosphate.",M2
16884659,"Role of diet in hypertension management.The prevalence of hypertension is high and increasing worldwide. Drug therapy is effective, but for both  prehypertensive  and treated hypertensive patients, lifestyle changes are also important. Dietary modification is a key part of these changes, although skepticism about the role of diet in determining blood pressure has slowed implementation of the available guidelines. However, there is now a large body of evidence supporting a role for dietary salt, <e>potassium</e>, alcohol, and body mass in determining blood pressure. Studies such as PREMIER have shown that salt restriction (&lt;6 g/d), alcohol moderation (&lt;2U/d in men and &lt;1U/d in women), weight loss (if BMI&gt;25), exercise, and a DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet (supplying 20-30 mmol/d of potassium) can achieve decreases in systolic blood pressure of approximately 10 to 15 mm Hg when applied together. Of the dietary changes, salt intake remains the most amenable to change. But we must further reduce salt in processed food if it is to be part of a wider strategy to lower blood pressure in the general population. Nevertheless, the message to patients must be that dietary changes made within a concerted alteration in lifestyle can have a very significant impact on their blood pressure.",M2

It is unclear whether increasing intakes of a combination of these minerals produces a larger reduction in BP. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effects of combined mineral supplementation as a treatment for primary hypertension in adults. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Library, MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Citation Index, ISI Proceedings, ClinicalTrials.gov, Current Controlled Trials, CAB abstracts, and reference lists of systematic reviews, meta-analyses and randomised controlled trials (RCTs) included in the review. The search was unrestricted by language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Inclusion criteria were: 1) RCTs of a parallel or crossover design comparing oral supplements comprising a combination of potassium, and/or calcium, and/or magnesium with placebo, no treatment, or usual care; 2) treatment and follow-up &gt;=8 weeks; 3) participants over 18 years old, with raised systolic blood pressure (SBP) &gt;=140 mmHg or diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &gt;=85 mmHg with no known primary cause; 4) SBP and DBP reported at end of follow-up. We excluded trials where participants were pregnant, or received antihypertensive medication which changed during the study. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted. MAIN RESULTS: We included three RCTs (n=277) with between 24 and 28 weeks follow-up. Three combinations of minerals were investigated: potassium &amp; magnesium, calcium &amp; magnesium, and calcium &amp; potassium. One trial investigated combinations of calcium &amp; magnesium and of calcium &amp; potassium, and for each found a statistically non-significant increase in both SBP and DBP. All three trials investigated the combination of potassium &amp; magnesium. None of the trials provided data on mortality or morbidity. The combination of potassium &amp; magnesium compared to control resulted in statistically non-significant reductions in both SBP (mean difference = -4.6 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.9 to 0.7) and DBP (mean difference = -3.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -9.5 to 1.8), although the results were heterogeneous (I(2)=68% and 85% for SBP and DBP respectively).A sensitivity analysis using alternative reported values which accounted for missing data had very little effect on DBP but resulted in a larger, statistically significant reduction in SBP (mean difference = -5.8 mmHg, 95% CI: -10.5 to -1.0). The quality of the trials was not well reported. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found no robust evidence that supplements of any combination of potassium, magnesium or calcium reduce mortality, morbidity or BP in adults. More trials are needed to investigate whether the combination of potassium &amp; magnesium is effective.",M2

DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently extracted data and assessed trial quality. Disagreements were resolved by discussion or a third reviewer. Random effects meta-analyses and sensitivity analyses were conducted. MAIN RESULTS: Six RCT's (n=483), with eight to 16 weeks follow-up, met our inclusion criteria. Meta-analysis of five trials (n=425) with adequate data indicated that potassium supplementation compared to control resulted in a large but statistically non-significant reductions in SBP (mean difference: -11.2, 95% CI: -25.2 to 2.7) and DBP (mean difference: -5.0, 95% CI: -12.5 to 2.4). The substantial heterogeneity between trials was not explained by potassium dose, quality of trials or baseline blood pressure. Excluding one trial in an African population with very high baseline blood pressure resulted in smaller overall reductions in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -3.9, 95% CI: -8.6 to 0.8; DBP mean difference: -1.5, 95% CI: -6.2 to 3.1). Further sensitivity analysis restricted to two high quality trials (n=138) also found non-significant reductions in blood pressure (SBP mean difference: -7.1, 95% CI: -19.9 to 5.7; DBP mean difference: -5.5, 95% CI: -14.5 to 3.5). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: This systematic review found no statistically significant effect of potassium supplementation on blood pressure. Because of the small number of participants in the two high quality trials, the short duration of follow-up, and the unexplained heterogeneity between trials, the evidence about the effect of potassium supplementation on blood pressure is not conclusive. Further high quality RCTs of longer duration are required to clarify whether potassium supplementation can reduce blood pressure and improve health outcomes.",M2

Cylinders (diameter 30 mm, thickness 10 mm) of plantain (Musa AAB 'barraganete') were fried at four thermal treatments (120-180 degrees C and from 24 to 4 min) to obtain products with approximately the same water content (approximately 0.8+/-0.02 kg/kg1) and fat content (approximately 0.15+/-0.06 kg/kg). The thermal study used the cook value and the mean cook value as indicators of the effect of several different treatment temperatures and times on quality. Deep-fat frying had no significant effect on carotenoid contents at any frying conditions, and on potassium content, except at 120 degrees C and 24 min (loss &lt;or= 11%). There was a significant, but not complete, loss (&lt;or=45%) of ascorbic acid. The process with the greatest effect was low temperature and long time (120 degrees C/24 min), as observed for potassium and ascorbic acid. These results are in agreement with other studies that demonstrated short thermal treatments at high temperatures protect food nutritional quality, as shown by the cook value and the mean cook value. In our work, deep-fat frying of plantain preserved most of the micronutrient contents that were evaluated.",M2
16835352,"Reciprocal congenic lines for a major stroke QTL on rat chromosome 1.We previously identified a quantitative trait locus (QTL) for stroke proneness between the kallikrein (Klk) and Mt1pa markers on rat chromosome 1. To gain functional insights, we constructed congenic strains by introgressing either the whole or selected chromosomal segments from the stroke-prone (SHRsp) onto the stroke-resistant (SHRsr) spontaneously hypertensive rat genome and vice versa. The phenotype was the latency to develop stroke under a Japanese high-salt, low-<e>potassium</e> diet for 3 mo [known as Japanese diet (JD)]. Blood pressure (BP) was measured by tail cuff throughout the experiment. Urinary protein excretion was monitored in all lines under JD.

On the other hand, a significant occurrence of stroke events (20%) was detected in the reciprocal lines by the end of the 3-mo treatment with JD (P = 0.003).

16820345,"<e>Potassium</e> magnesium supplementation for four weeks improves small distal artery compliance and reduces blood pressure in patients with essential hypertension.It has been postulated that the loss of arterial compliance may precede cardiovascular diseases, and that arterial compliance is an important parameter to consider when evaluating arterial diseases such as essential hypertension (EH) and the effects of antihypertensive treatment. In all, 133 EH patients and 147 healthy subjects were enrolled in this study. Large arterial compliance (C1) and small arterial compliance (C2) were measured by the CVProfilor DO-2020 CardioVascular Profiling System. Thirty-five patients randomly received magnesium potassium supplementation (magnesium, 70.8 mg/d; potassium, 217.2 mg/d) for four weeks, and 32 patients received lacidipin (4 mg/d) as a control. Before and after the four weeks, blood pressure, C1, and C2 were measured. It was found that arterial compliance was significantly lower in EH patients compared with healthy subjects (C1: 12.53 +/- 0.33 vs. 15.63 +/- 0.30 ml/mmHg x 10, p &lt; 0.01;C2: 3.79 +/- 0.17 vs. 5.69 +/- 0.25 ml/mmHg x 100, p &lt; 0.01). On lacidipine, systolic and diastolic BP decreased 13.27 +/- 1.76 mm Hg and 6.33 +/- 1.55 mm Hg, and C1 and C2 compliance values increased 25.05% +/- 4.49% and 34.50% +/- 7.40%, respectively. On K+ and Mg2+ supplementation, systolic and diastolic BP decreased 7.83 +/- 1.87 mm Hg and 3.67 +/- 1.03 mm Hg, and C1 and C2 compliance values increased 12.44% +/- 4.43% and 45.25% +/- 6.67%, respectively. Decreases in systemic vascular resistance (mean arterial pressure divided by cardiac output) by 11.9% and 16.6 % (p &lt; 0.01) were seen between the drug-induced changes, respectively.

16818802,"Protective effect of <e>potassium</e> against the hypertensive cardiac dysfunction: association with reactive oxygen species reduction.Potassium supplementation has a potent protective effect against cardiovascular disease, but the precise mechanism of it against left ventricular abnormal relaxation, relatively early functional cardiac alteration in hypertensive subjects, has not been fully elucidated. In the present study, we investigated the effect of potassium against salt-induced cardiac dysfunction and the involved mechanism. Seven- to 8-week-old Dahl salt sensitive rats were fed normal diet (0.3% NaCl) or high-salt diet (8% NaCl) with or without high potassium (8% KCl) for 8 weeks. Left ventricular relaxation was evaluated by the deceleration time of early diastolic filling obtained from Doppler transmitral inflow, the slope of the pressure curve, and the time constant at the isovolumic relaxation phase. High-salt loading induced a significant elevation of blood pressure and impaired left ventricular relaxation, accompanied by augmentation of reduced nicotinamide-adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity in the cardiac tissue, measured by the lucigenin chemiluminescence method. Blood pressure lowering by hydralazine could not ameliorate NADPH oxidase activity and resulted in no improvement of left ventricular relaxation. Interestingly, although the blood pressure remained high, potassium supplementation as well as treatment with 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethyl-piperidine-N-oxyl, a superoxide dismutase mimetic, not only reduced the elevated NADPH oxidase activity but also improved the left ventricular relaxation. In conclusion, a high-potassium diet has a potent protective effect on left ventricular active relaxation independent of blood pressure, partly through the inhibition of cardiac NADPH oxidase activity. Sufficient potassium supplementation might be an attractive strategy for cardiac protection, especially in the salt-sensitive hypertensive subjects.",M2
16772639,"Role of dietary sodium in osteoporosis.Sodium, in the form of sodium chloride, elevates urinary calcium excretion and, at prevailing calcium intakes, evokes compensatory responses that may lead to increased bone remodeling and bone loss. The calciuria is partly due to salt-induced volume expansion, with an increase in GFR, and partly to competition between sodium and calcium ions in the renal tubule. <e>Potassium</e> intakes in the range of current recommendations actually reduce or prevent sodium chloride-induced calciuria. At calcium intakes at or above currently recommended levels, there appear to be no deleterious effects of prevailing salt intakes on bone or the calcium economy, mainly because adaptive increases in calcium absorption offset the increased urinary loss. Such compensation is likely to be incomplete at low calcium intakes. Limited evidence suggests equivalent bone-sparing effects of either salt restriction or augmented calcium intakes. Given the relative difficulty of the former, and the ancillary benefits of the latter, it would seem that the optimal strategy to protect the skeleton is to ensure adequate calcium and potassium intakes.",M2
16772638,"Relationship and interaction between sodium and <e>potassium</e>.Compared with the Stone Age diet, the modern human diet is both excessive in NaCl and deficient in fruits and vegetables which are rich in K+ and HCO3- -yielding organates like citrate. With the modern diet, the K+/Na+ ratio and the HCO3-/Cl- ratio have both become reversed. Yet, the biologic machinery that evolved to process these dietary electrolytes remains largely unchanged, genetically fixed in Paleolithic time. Thus, the electrolytic mix of the modern diet is profoundly mismatched to its processing machinery. Dietary potassium modulates both the pressor and hypercalciuric effects of the modern dietary excess of NaCl. A marginally deficient dietary intake of potassium amplifies both of these effects, and both effects are dose-dependently attenuated and may be abolished either with dietary potassium or supplemental KHCO3. The pathogenic effects of a dietary deficiency of potassium amplify, and are amplified by, those of a dietary excess of NaCl and in some instances a dietary deficiency of bicarbonate precursors. Thus, in those ingesting the modern diet, it may not be possible to discern which of these dietary electrolytic dislocations is most determining of salt-sensitive blood pressure and hypercalciuria, and the hypertension, kidney stones, and osteoporosis they may engender. Obviously abnormal plasma electrolyte concentrations rarely characterize these dietary electrolytic dislocations, and when either dietary potassium or supplemental KHCO3 corrects the pressor and hypercalciuric effects of these dislocations, the plasma concentrations of sodium, potassium, bicarbonate and chloride change little and remain well within the normal range.",M2

However, the pathologic mechanism of salt-sensitivity is poorly understood and endothelial dysfunction might be involved in salt-sensitive hypertension. We, therefore, observed the endothelial function changes by measuring plasma and urine nitric oxide (NO) concentrations in salt-sensitive (SS) normotensive and mild hypertensive subjects underwent various salt loading protocols and the effects of potassium supplement. METHODS: Thirty-nine normotensive and mild hypertensive subjects (&lt; 160/100 mm Hg), aged 16-60, were enrolled and the study protocol is as follows: 3 days baseline investigation, 1 week low-salt loading (3 g/day), 1 week. high-salt loading (18 g/day) and 1 week high-salt loading plus potassium chloride (4.5 g/day). RESULTS: Plasma and urine NO levels were significantly lower in SS (n = 8) subjects at baseline, low-salt and high-salt loading phases compared with salt-resistant subjects (SR, n = 31) and oral potassium supplement to SS subjects with high salt loading significantly increased plasma and urine NO levels. CONCLUSION: Endothelial function is impaired in normotensive and mild hypertensive SS subjects.

The aim of the study was to examine which form, if any, of the dietary cation anion difference (DCAD) equation provided the best estimate of milk fever risk and to clarify roles of calcium, magnesium, and phosphorus concentrations of prepartum diets in the pathogenesis of milk fever. Two statistically equivalent and biologically plausible models were developed that predict incidence of milk fever. These models were validated using data from 37 trials excluded from the original data used to generate the models; missing variables were replaced with mean values from the analyzed data. The preferred models differed slightly; Model 1 included prepartum DCAD, and Model 2 included prepartum dietary concentrations of <e>potassium</e> and sulfur alone, but not sodium and chloride. Other factors, included in both models were prepartum dietary concentrations of calcium, magnesium, phosphorus; days exposed to the prepartum diet; and breed. Jersey cows were at 2.25 times higher risk of milk fever than Holstein cows in Model 1. The results support the DCAD theory of greater risk of milk fever with higher prepartum dietary DCAD (odds ratio = 1.015). The only DCAD equation supported in statistical analyses was (Na(+) + K(+)) - (Cl(-) + S(2-)). This finding highlights the difference between developing equations to predict DCAD and those to predict milk fever. The results support a hypothesis of a quadratic role for Ca in the pathogenesis of milk fever (model 1, odds ratio = 0.131; Model 2, odds ratio = 0.115). Milk fever risk was highest with a prepartum dietary concentration of 1.35% calcium. Increasing prepartum dietary magnesium concentrations had the largest effect on decreasing incidence of milk fever in both Model 1 (odds ratio = 0.006) and Model 2 (odds ratio = 0.001). Increasing dietary phosphorus concentrations prepartum increased the risk of milk fever (Model 1, odds ratio = 6.376; Model 2, odds ratio = 9.872). The models presented provide the basis for the formulation of diets to reduce the risk of milk fever and strongly support the need to evaluate macro mineral nutrition apart from DCAD of the diet.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: Population estimates of usual intake distributions of sodium, chloride (assumed to be equamolar to sodium), and potassium of 4- to 5-, 6- to 11-, and 12- to 24-month-old infants and toddlers were calculated and compared with DRIs of these nutrients by 0- to 6-month-old, 7- to 12-month-old, and 1- to 3-year-old children. SUBJECTS: Infants and toddlers (n=3,022) who participated in the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Means and distributions (percentiles) of the usual intakes of sodium, chloride, and potassium were calculated using Institute of Medicine-recommended procedures and compared with the DRIs (ie, Adequate Intake [AI] and tolerable upper intake level [UL]). RESULTS: Mean sodium and chloride intakes of 4- to 5-month-old infants (188 mg/day and 290 mg/day, respectively) were 57% greater than the AIs (120 mg/day and 180 mg/day) and mean potassium intake (730 mg/day) was 83% higher than the AI (400 mg/day). Mean sodium, chloride, and potassium intakes of 6- to 11-month-old infants were 493 mg/day, 761 mg/day, and 1,225 mg/day, respectively-33%, 33%, and 75% higher than the AIs of these nutrients for this age group (sodium, 370 mg/day; chloride, 570 mg/day; potassium, 700 mg/day). Even the 10th percentile of potassium intake of this age group was greater than the AI. The usual mean sodium and chloride intakes of 12- to 24-month-old toddlers (1,638 mg/day and 2,528 mg/day, respectively) were 64% higher than the AIs (1,000 mg/day and 1,540 mg/day, respectively) and the usual mean sodium and chloride intakes of 58% of this age group were above the ULs. In contrast, mean potassium intake of 12- to 24-month-old toddlers (1,971 mg/day) was only 66% of the AI (3,000 mg/day). At all ages, sources of sodium, chloride, and potassium intakes reflected current feeding guidelines, primarily human milk and formula prior to 6 months of age and primarily cow's milk and table foods after 1 year of age. CONCLUSIONS: Mean sodium and chloride intakes of infants and toddlers who participated in the 2002 Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study exceeded the recently established AIs of these nutrients and the mean intake of 58% of toddlers exceeded the ULs. Mean potassium intake of infants also exceeded the AI of potassium, but the mean potassium intake of toddlers was only 66% of the AI. Whether current intakes of sodium, chloride, and potassium by infants and toddlers are problematical is not clear. Nonetheless, it seems desirable to bring these intakes closer to AIs. This can be accomplished by continuing breast- or formula-feeding and delaying the introduction of cow's milk; limiting the amount of salt added to home-prepared foods; limiting the intake of high-sodium foods, such as processed meats and salty snacks; and increasing the intake of fruits (high potassium and low sodium content) and vegetables (moderate potassium and sodium content).",M2
16374423,"Modulation of renal kallikrein by a high <e>potassium</e> diet in rats with intense proteinuria.Injury of the renal tubulointerstitial compartment is recognized to play an important role in hypertension. Its damage may in turn, impair the activity of vasodepressor systems, like the kallikrein-kinin, in blood pressure regulation. The overload proteinuria model induces tubulointerstitial injury with activation of the renin-angiotensin system, but renal kallikrein and the development of hypertension have not received special attention. Sprague-Dawley rats received seven intraperitoneal doses of bovine serum albumin (BSA) 2 g/day under normosodic diet and were hydrated ad libitum. A second group received a high potassium diet to stimulate kallikrein production during the previous four weeks and while under BSA administration. A third one received potassium and BSA in the same schedule, but with the kinin B2 receptor antagonist, HOE140, added during the protein load phase. A control group received seven saline injections. Kallikrein protein was detected by immune labeling on renal sections and enzymatic activity in the urine. The BSA group showed massive proteinuria followed by intense tubulointerstitial damage. Blood pressure increased after the third dose in BSA animals, remaining elevated throughout the experiment, associated with significant reductions in renal expression and urinary activity of kallikrein, compared with controls. An inverse correlation was found between blood pressure and immunohistochemistry and urinary activity of kallikrein. Potassium induced a significant increase in both urinary activity and renal kallikrein expression, associated with significant reduction in blood pressure. The HOE140 antagonist blunted the antihypertensive effect of kallikrein stimulation in proteinuric rats. Loss of renal kallikrein, produced by tubulointerstitial injury, may participate in the pathogenesis of the hypertension observed in this model.",M2
16302005,"Why and how to implement sodium, <e>potassium</e>, calcium, and magnesium changes in food items and diets?The present average sodium intakes, approximately 3000-4500 mg/day in various industrialised populations, are very high, that is, 2-3-fold in comparison with the current Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) of 1500 mg. The sodium intakes markedly exceed even the level of 2500 mg, which has been recently given as the maximum level of daily intake that is likely to pose no risk of adverse effects on blood pressure or otherwise. By contrast, the present average potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes are remarkably lower than the recommended intake levels (DRI). In USA, for example, the average intake of these mineral nutrients is only 35-50% of the recommended intakes. There is convincing evidence, which indicates that this imbalance, that is, the high intake of sodium on one hand and the low intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium on the other hand, produce and maintain elevated blood pressure in a big proportion of the population. Decreased intakes of sodium alone, and increased intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium each alone decrease elevated blood pressure. A combination of all these factors, that is, decrease of sodium, and increase of potassium, calcium, and magnesium intakes, which are characteristic of the so-called Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diets, has an excellent blood pressure lowering effect. For the prevention and basic treatment of elevated blood pressure, various methods to decrease the intake of sodium and to increase the intakes of potassium, calcium, and magnesium should be comprehensively applied in the communities. The so-called 'functional food/nutraceutical/food-ceutical' approach, which corrects the mineral nutrient composition of extensively used processed foods, is likely to be particularly effective in producing immediate beneficial effects. The European Union and various governments should promote the availability and use of such healthier food compositions by tax reductions and other policies, which make the healthier choices cheaper than the conventional ones. They should also introduce and promote the use of tempting nutrition and health claims on the packages of healthier food choices, which have an increased content of potassium, calcium, and/or magnesium and a lowered content of sodium. Such pricing and claim methods would help the consumers to choose healthier food alternatives, and make composition improvements tempting also for the food industry.",M2
16079643,"Ethnic differences in intake and excretion of sodium, <e>potassium</e>, calcium and magnesium in South Africans.OBJECTIVES: To determine any differences in the urinary excretion and dietary intake of sodium, potassium, magnesium and calcium intake in three South African ethnic groups, and to assess whether the blood pressure-cation association varies according to ethnic status. DESIGN: A cross-sectional study of 325 black, white and mixed-ancestry men and women, conveniently sampled in Cape Town. Twenty-four-hour urine samples were collected on three separate occasions for assessment of urinary electrolytes, and three 24-h dietary recalls for the corresponding urine collection times were administered by two trained fieldworkers. Para-amino benzoic acid was used as a marker of the completeness of urine collection. RESULTS: Mean urinary sodium values equate to a daily salt (sodium chloride) intake of 7.8, 8.5 and 9.5 g in black, mixed-ancestry and white individuals, respectively. In normotensive individuals, black and mixed-ancestry subjects had significantly lower median urinary sodium concentrations than white subjects, but these differences were not evident between black and white hypertensive subjects. No ethnic differences were found for urinary potassium, except for mixed-ancestry normotensive individuals having a lower excretion than white normotensive individuals. Urinary magnesium excretion did not differ across ethnic groups. In both normotensive and hypertensive individuals, urinary calcium concentrations differed between all three groups, with black subjects having the lowest values, approximately less than half those of white subjects. CONCLUSION: White normotensive subjects in Cape Town have higher habitual intakes of sodium, but also higher calcium intakes than their black and mixed-ancestry counterparts. Dietary differences may contribute to ethnic-related differences in blood pressure.",M2
15983966,"Hypokalemia in Chinese peritoneal dialysis patients: prevalence and prognostic implication.BACKGROUND: Abnormal <e>potassium</e> metabolism may contribute to the increased cardiac morbidity and mortality seen in dialysis patients. We studied the pattern of serum potassium levels in a cohort of Chinese peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. METHODS: We studied serum potassium levels of 266 PD patients during 3 consecutive clinic visits. Dialysis adequacy, residual renal function, and nutritional status also were assessed. Patients were followed up for 33.7 +/- 20.7 months. RESULTS: Mean serum potassium level was 3.9 +/- 0.5 mEq/L (mmol/L). Five patients (1.9%) had an average serum potassium level less than 3 mEq/L (mmol/L), whereas 54 patients (20.3%) had a serum potassium level less than 3.5 mEq/L (mmol/L). Serum potassium levels correlated with overall Subjective Global Assessment score (r = 0.276; P &lt; 0.001) and serum albumin level (r = 0.173; P = 0.005) and inversely with Charlson comorbidity score (r = -0.155; P = 0.011). There was no correlation between serum potassium level and daily PD exchange volume, total Kt/V, urine volume, or residual glomerular filtration rate. By means of multivariate analysis with Cox proportional hazard model to adjust for confounders, serum potassium level was an independent predictor of actuarial patient survival. PD patients with hypokalemia (serum potassium &lt; 3.5 mEq/L [mmol/L]) had significantly worse actuarial survival (hazard ratio, 1.79; 95% confidence interval, 1.12 to 2.85; P = 0.015) than those without hypokalemia after adjusting for confounding factors. CONCLUSION: Hypokalemia is common in Chinese PD patients. Serum potassium level was associated with nutritional status and severity of coexisting comorbid condition. Furthermore, hypokalemia was an independent predictor of survival in PD patients. Additional studies may be needed to investigate the benefit of potassium supplementation for PD patients with hypokalemia.",M2
15979281,"Measurement of net acid excretion by use of paper strips.OBJECTIVE: Net endogenous acid production, reflected in the steady state as net acid excretion (NAE), is implicated in bone loss because it is positively associated with urinary calcium loss. Protein is one of the main sources of dietary acid load, whereas fruit and vegetables provide alkaline <e>potassium</e> salts that counteract the dietary acid load. This study investigated whether a pH paper strip measurement of overnight (i.e., first void) urine would reflect 24-h NAE, measured as excretion rates of titratable acid minus bicarbonate plus ammonium. METHODS: Twenty-three subjects collected 24-h urine in two parts: day (approximately 7 am to 11 pm) and overnight (approximately 11 pm to 7 am). At first void, subjects recorded pH using paper strips. Subjects recorded intake and 20 subjects provided fasting urine collected from 7 to 9 am. RESULTS: The pH paper strip measurements of first void urine was significantly correlated with 24-h titratable acid minus bicarbonate (r = -0.466, P &lt; 0.025) but not with 24-h NAE. We examined the association of dietary protein, potassium, protein:potassium ratio, and sodium with NAE, with fasting morning urinary calcium excretion, an indirect measurement of bone loss, and with urinary cross-links, a direct measurement of bone resorption. Of these, only sodium intake (measured as 24-h urine excretion) and urine potassium:sodium ratio showed a significant relation (with fasting calcium excretion). CONCLUSIONS: We did not find that the first void urine pH by paper strip measurement provided an index of daily net endogenous acid production as reflected in 24-h NAE. In our sample of young adults, daily sodium intake positively correlated with bone resorption, as reflected in fasting urine calcium, whereas daily NAE did not.",M2

ANIMALS: 46 healthy horses. PROCEDURE: Blood samples were collected before the ride; at 21-, 37-, 56-, and 80-km inspection points; and during recovery (ie, 30-minute period after the ride). Consumed electrolytes were recorded. Blood was analyzed for pH, PvCO2, and Hct, and plasma was analyzed for Na+, K+, Cl-, Ca2+, Mg2+, lactate, albumin, phosphate, and total protein concentrations. Plasma concentrations of H+ and HCO3-, the strong ion difference (SID), and osmolarity were calculated. RESULTS: 34 (17 EM-K and 17 EM+K treated) horses finished the ride. Potassium intake was 33 g less and Na+ intake was 36 g greater for EM-K-treated horses, compared with EM+K-treated horses. With increasing distance, plasma osmolarity; H+, Na+, K+, Mg2+, phosphate, lactate, total protein, and albumin concentrations; and PvCO2 and Hct were increased in all horses. Plasma HCO3-, Ca2+, and Cl- concentrations were decreased. Plasma H+ concentration was significantly lower in EM-K-treated horses, compared with EM+K-treated horses. Plasma K+ concentrations at the 80-km inspection point and during recovery were significantly less in EM-K-treated horses, compared with EM+K-treated horses. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Increases in plasma H+ and K+ concentrations in this endurance ride were moderate and unlikely to contribute to signs of muscle fatigue and hyperexcitability in horses.",M2
15817873,"Low dietary <e>potassium</e> intakes and high dietary estimates of net endogenous acid production are associated with low bone mineral density in premenopausal women and increased markers of bone resorption in postmenopausal women.BACKGROUND: The Western diet may be a risk factor for osteoporosis. Excess acid generated from high protein intakes increases calcium excretion and bone resorption. Fruit and vegetable intake could balance this excess acidity by providing alkaline salts of potassium. Algorithms based on dietary intakes of key nutrients can be used to approximate net endogenous acid production (NEAP) and to explore the association between dietary acidity and bone health. OBJECTIVE: We investigated the relation between dietary potassium and protein, NEAP (with an algorithm including the ratio of protein to potassium intake), and potential renal acid load (with an algorithm including dietary protein, phosphorous, potassium, magnesium, and calcium) and markers of bone health. DESIGN: Measurements of bone mineral density (BMD) (n = 3226) and urinary bone resorption markers (n = 2929) at the lumbar spine and femoral neck were performed in perimenopausal and early postmenopausal women aged 54.9 +/- 2.2 y (x +/- SD) in 1997-1999. BMD (g/cm(2)), free pyridinoline (fPYD), and free deoxypyridinoline (fDPD) were expressed relative to creatinine. Dietary intake was assessed with a food-frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Comparison of the highest with the lowest quartile of potassium intake or the lowest with the highest NEAP showed a 6-8% increase in fPYD/creatinine and fDPD/creatinine. A difference of 8% in BMD was observed between the highest and lowest quartiles of potassium intake in the premenopausal group (n = 337). CONCLUSIONS: Dietary potassium, an indicator of NEAP and fruit and vegetable intake, may exert a modest influence on markers of bone health, which over a lifetime may contribute to a decreased risk of osteoporosis.",M2

15811766,"Does dietary recall adequately assess sodium, <e>potassium</e>, and calcium intake in hypertensive patients?OBJECTIVE: A diet low in sodium, high in potassium, and high in calcium is recommended to lower blood pressure. However, compliance with this diet is poor, probably because of dietary intake underestimation. Therefore, we compared electrolyte intake as estimated from dietary recall with a 24-h urinary excretion. METHODS: Thirty-six patients (26 men and 10 women) with a mean age of 46 +/- 8 y participated in the study. All participants had essential hypertension and were on no drug therapy (n = 20) or non-diuretic monotherapy (n = 16). Patients were instructed to consume a low-sodium (50 mmol/d), high-potassium (supplementation with 30 to 60 mmol/d), and high-calcium (1000 mg/d) diet. Compliance with the diet was assessed at baseline and then 1, 2, and 3 mo after starting the diet. Sodium, potassium, and calcium intakes were carefully estimated from patients' dietary recall and 24-h urinary collection. RESULTS: Estimated sodium intake significantly correlated with 24-h urinary excretion (R = 0.43 P &lt; 0.001). However, estimated sodium intake was lower than urinary sodium excretion by 34% at baseline and by 47% after 3 mo of dieting (P &lt; 0.05). Estimated potassium intake correlated with 24-h urinary excretion. Estimated calcium intake significantly increased from 933 +/- 83 mg/d to 1029 +/- 171 mg/d (P &lt; 0.05). Calcium intake derived from patients' recall far exceeded and only slightly correlated with 24-h urinary excretion (R = 0.23, P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Patients tend to underestimate their sodium intake by 30% to 50%; therefore, urinary sodium excretion is more accurate to assess sodium intake. Thus, 24-h urinary sodium excretion should be used in clinical practice and in clinical trials, especially when dietary non-compliance is suspected.",M2
15798076,"<e>Potassium</e> intake and the calcium economy.BACKGROUND: Dietary potassium intake (K) lowers urinary calcium (Ca) excretion and, in short-term studies, may improve Ca balance. PURPOSE: Our objective was to assess K effects on the Ca economy under steady-state conditions. DESIGN: 8-day, inpatient metabolic studies of nitrogen, phosphorus, and Ca balance, combined with dual isotopic Ca tracer kinetics studies. Study diet matched to prestudy nutrient intakes. SUBJECTS: 191 single women studied from 1-5 times at approximately 5-year intervals, for a total of 644 inpatient studies. Median age at time of study: 50.2 yrs; 301 studies were performed postmenopausally without hormone replacement; 343 were either premenopausal or postmenopausal but on estrogen replacement therapy. RESULTS: Dietary K was highly significantly associated with urinary Ca excretion, with a coefficient of -0.0109 mmol urine Ca/mmol diet K. However, dietary K was negatively correlated with dual-tracer Ca absorption (coefficient for Ca absorption fraction: -0.00094/mmol dietary K), and was not associated with urine Ca after adjustment for Ca absorption. CONCLUSION: While a high K diet (i.e., one rich in fruits, vegetables, and dairy products) has multiple health benefits and clearly lowers urine Ca, it does not seem to exert any appreciable net influence on the Ca economy, largely because the reduced calciuria is offset by reduction of intestinal absorption. We note, however, that since the high K intakes in our studies come more from milk and meat than from fruits and vegetables, we cannot exclude a possible balance effect for different food sources of K.",M2
15699220,"Origins and evolution of the Western diet: health implications for the 21st century.There is growing awareness that the profound changes in the environment (eg, in diet and other lifestyle conditions) that began with the introduction of agriculture and animal husbandry approximately 10000 y ago occurred too recently on an evolutionary time scale for the human genome to adjust. In conjunction with this discordance between our ancient, genetically determined biology and the nutritional, cultural, and activity patterns of contemporary Western populations, many of the so-called diseases of civilization have emerged. In particular, food staples and food-processing procedures introduced during the Neolithic and Industrial Periods have fundamentally altered 7 crucial nutritional characteristics of ancestral hominin diets: 1) glycemic load, 2) fatty acid composition, 3) macronutrient composition, 4) micronutrient density, 5) acid-base balance, 6) sodium-<e>potassium</e> ratio, and 7) fiber content.

15661477,"Diet and blood pressure in South Africa: Intake of foods containing sodium, <e>potassium</e>, calcium, and magnesium in three ethnic groups.OBJECTIVES: We investigated whether habitual intakes of sodium (Na), potassium, magnesium, and calcium differ across South African ethnic groups, assessed the proportion of Na intake, which is discretionary, and identified which food sources were the major contributors to Na intake. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 325 black, white, and mixed ancestry hypertensive and normotensive subjects. Three repeated 24-h urine samples were collected for assessment of urinary Na, and three corresponding 24-h dietary recalls were administered by trained fieldworkers. Blood pressure and weight were measured at each visit. Secondary analyses were performed on existing dietary databases obtained from four regional surveys undertaken in South African adults. RESULTS: Mean urinary Na excretion values equated to daily salt (NaCl) intakes of 7.8, 8.5, and 9.5 g in black, mixed ancestry, and white subjects, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Between 33% and 46% of total Na intake was discretionary, and, of the non-discretionary sources, bread was the single greatest contributor to Na intake in all groups. Ethnic differences in calcium intake were evident, with black subjects having particularly low intakes. Urban versus rural differences existed with respect to sources of dietary Na, with greater than 70% of total non-discretionary Na being provided by bread and cereals in rural black South Africans compared with 49% to 54% in urban dwellers. CONCLUSION: White South Africans have higher habitual intakes of Na, but also higher calcium intakes, than their black and mixed ancestry counterparts. All ethnic groups had Na intakes in excess of 6 g/d of salt, whereas potassium intakes in all groups were below the recommended level of 90 mM/d. Dietary differences may contribute to ethnically related differences in blood pressure.",M2
15579526,"Dietary factors and the risk of incident kidney stones in men: new insights after 14 years of follow-up.Diet plays an important role in the pathogenesis of kidney stones. Because the metabolism of many dietary factors, such as calcium, may change with age, the relation between diet and kidney stones may be different in older adults. Uncertainty also remains about the association between many dietary factors, such as vitamin C, magnesium, and animal protein, and the risk of kidney stone formation. To examine the association between dietary factors and the risk of incident, symptomatic kidney stones in men and to determine whether these associations vary with age, a prospective cohort study was conducted of 45,619 men without a history of nephrolithiasis. Self-administered food frequency questionnaires were used to assess diet every 4 yr. A total of 1473 incident symptomatic kidney stones were documented during 477,700 person-years of follow-up. For men aged &lt;60 yr, the multivariate relative risk (RR) for stone formation in the highest quintile of dietary calcium as compared with the lowest quintile was 0.69 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.56 to 0.87; P = 0.01 for trend). By contrast, there was no association between dietary calcium and stone formation in men aged 60 yr or older. The multivariate RR for men who consumed 1000 mg or greater of vitamin C per day compared with those who consumed less than the recommended dietary allowance of 90 mg/d was 1.41 (95% CI, 1.11 to 1.80; P = 0.01 for trend). Other dietary factors showed the following multivariate RR among men in the highest quintile of intake compared with those in the lowest: magnesium, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.56 to 0.89; P = 0.01 for trend); <e>potassium</e>, 0.54 (95% CI, 0.42 to 0.68; P &lt; 0.001 for trend); and fluid, 0.71 (95% CI, 0.59 to 0.85; P &lt; 0.001 for trend). Animal protein was associated with risk only in men with a body mass index &lt;25 kg/m(2) (RR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.05 to 1.81; P = 0.03 for trend). Sodium, phosphorus, sucrose, phytate, vitamin B(6), vitamin D, and supplemental calcium were not independently associated with risk. In conclusion, the association between calcium intake and kidney stone formation varies with age. Magnesium intake decreases and total vitamin C intake seems to increase the risk of symptomatic nephrolithiasis. Because age and body size affect the relation between diet and kidney stones, dietary recommendations for stone prevention should be tailored to the individual patient.",M2
15569332,"The effect of fruits and vegetables on urinary stone risk factors.BACKGROUND: The overall effect of fruit and vegetable intake on urinary stone risk profile is not yet known. METHODS: We studied the effect of a two-week period of fruit and vegetable elimination on urinary stone risk profile in 12 normal adults, and of supplementing the diet with a fair quantity of low-oxalate fruits and vegetables in 26 idiopathic calcium stone formers characterized by hypocitraturia and a very low fruit and vegetable intake in their usual diet. RESULTS: In the normal subjects, the elimination of fruits and vegetables from the diet decreased the urinary excretion of <e>potassium</e> (-62%), magnesium (-26%), citrate (-44%) and oxalate (-31%), and increased that of calcium (+49%) and ammonium (+12%) (P &lt; 0.05 for all). The relative saturation for calcium oxalate and calcium phosphate increased from 6.33 to 8.24 (P = 0.028), and from 0.68 to 1.58 (P = 0.050), respectively. In the hypocitraturic stone formers, the introduction of these foods in the diet increased urinary volume (+64%), pH (from 5.84 to 6.19), excretion of potassium (+68%), magnesium (+23%), and citrate (+68%), while it decreased the excretion of ammonium (-18%) (P &lt; 0.05 for all). The relative saturation for calcium oxalate and uric acid fell from 10.17 to 4.96 (P &lt; 0.001), and from 2.78 to 1.12 (P = 0.003), respectively. CONCLUSION: The total elimination of fruits and vegetables in normal subjects brings about adverse changes in the urinary stone risk profile that are only partially counterbalanced by a reduction in oxalate. In contrast, the addition of these foods to the diet of hypocitraturic stone formers not used to eating them not only significantly increases citrate excretion without affecting oxalate excretion, but also decreases calcium oxalate and uric acid relative saturation.",M2
15514249,"Protective effects of high dietary <e>potassium</e>: nutritional and metabolic aspects.Potassium (K+) requirements have been largely overlooked because severe deficiencies are uncommon due to the ubiquity of this element in foods. However, a transition toward modern ( Westernized ) diets has led to a substantial decline of K+ intake compared with traditional food habits, and a large fraction of the population might now have suboptimal K+ intake. A high K+ intake was demonstrated to have protective effects against several pathologic states affecting the cardiovascular system, kidneys, and bones. Additionally, fruits and vegetables contain K/organic anion salts (malate, citrate), which exert alkalinizing effects, through KHCO(3)(-) generation, which serves to neutralize fixed acidity in urine. Low-grade metabolic acidosis, when not properly controlled, may exacerbate various catabolic processes (bone Ca++ mobilization, proteolysis), especially in the elderly. Fruits and vegetables are therefore receiving great attention in a strategy to increase the nutritional value of meals while reducing energy density and intake. The need to ensure a 2.5- to 3.5-g daily K+ supply from fruits and vegetables represents a strong rationale for the  5-10 servings per day  recommendations.",M2

SUBJECTS AND STUDY DESIGN: The reported dietary intake of 33 rheumatoid arthritis patients (17 patients on a Mediterranean-type diet and 16 patients on a control diet) participating in a dietary intervention study was assessed using the DHI method. The total energy expenditure (TEE), estimated by a 3-day AR, was used to validate the energy intake (EI). For nine subjects the activity registration was also validated by means of the doubly labelled water (DLW) method. The excretion of nitrogen, sodium and potassium in 24-h urine samples was used to validate the intake of protein, sodium and potassium. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the EI and the TEE estimated by the activity registration or between the intake of protein, sodium and potassium and their respective biological markers. However, in general, the AR underestimated the TEE compared to the DLW method. No significant differences were found between the subjects in the Mediterranean diet group and the control diet group regarding the relationship between the reported intakes and the biological markers. CONCLUSION: The DHI could capture the dietary intake fairly well, and the dietary assessment was not biased by the dietary intervention. The AR showed a bias towards underestimation when compared to the DLW method. This illustrates the importance of valid biological markers.",M2

In the present study, we evaluated the effects of an aldosterone-antagonist, spironolactone, on the extrarenal regulation of <e>potassium</e> in HD patients. Furthermore, to validate the effectiveness of the spironolactone dose-design, we measured the expression of Na(+)-channel (ENaC alpha subunit) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC), before and after a two-week course of spironolactone. METHODS: The study design included a two-week baseline period, followed by spironolactone treatment (50 mg three times weekly for 15 days), and by a two-week washout period and then a two-week placebo period. An oral K(+) load (0.3 mEq/K(+) kg body weight plus carbohydrates) was administered at the end of each period, and time-course of plasma potassium was evaluated. ENaC expression in PBMC was assessed before and after spironolactone. RESULTS: The maximal increase in plasma potassium after the K(+) carbohydrate load was: control 5.33 +/- 0.88 mEq K(+)/L; spironolactone 5.23 +/- 0.68 mEq K(+)/L; placebo 5.38 +/- 0.61 mEq K(+)/L (N= 9). No patients developed hyperkalemia during the spironolactone treatment period. ENaC expression was significantly higher in all six HD patients studied, compared to control subjects (P &lt; 0.05). Treatment with spironolactone in HD patients reduced alpha subunit mRNA expression to values similar to those of normal subjects. CONCLUSION: Spironolactone may be considered for the treatment of selected chronic HD patients. The effect of the drug on a known target of aldosterone, the ENaC, demonstrates the effectiveness of the drug to block aldosterone effects in nonepithelial tissues.",M2
15300162,"Renal <e>potassium</e> channels: recent developments.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A variety of K+ channels have been identified with the patch-clamp technique and molecular cloning in the kidney. However, it is still a challenging task to determine the location and function of the cloned K+ channels in the corresponding nephron segment. The aim of the present review is to update the recent developments regarding the location and function of the cloned K+ channels in the native tubule. Also, the review describes the new regulatory mechanism of renal outer-medullary K (ROMK) channels and the role of Ca(2+)-activated maxi K+ channels in flow-dependent K+ secretion. RECENT FINDINGS: Several types of voltage-gated K+ (Kv) channel, such as KCNQ1, KCNA10 and Kv1.3, are highly expressed at the apical membrane of proximal tubules and distal tubules. They may participate in stabilizing the cell membrane potential. Moreover, studies performed in ROMK-knockout mice have shown that the apical 70 pS K+ channel is absent in the thick ascending limb in these mice, suggesting that the ROMK channel is also involved in forming the apical 70 pS K+ channel in the thick ascending limb. Three important kinases, protein tyrosine kinase, serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase and with-no-lysine kinase, have been suggested to regulate the ROMK channel density in the cortical collecting duct. Low K+ intake increases protein tyrosine kinase expression and tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK channels. Coexpression of with-no-lysine kinase with the ROMK channel decreases K+ current whereas serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 stimulates the ROMK current in oocytes in the presence of Na/H exchanger regulatory factor 2. The Ca-activated maxi K+ channel has been shown to be activated by an increase in flow rate in the rabbit cortical collecting duct. SUMMARY: The voltage-gated K+ channels are expressed in a variety of nephron segments and play a role in stabilization of cell membrane potential. With-no-lysine kinase and serum- and glucocorticoid-inducible kinase 1 have been shown to regulate ROMK1 channels. Protein tyrosine kinase mediates the effect of K+ intake on K+ secretion by stimulation of tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK1 channels. The Ca-activated maxi K+ channel plays a role in flow-dependent K+ secretion in the distal nephron.",M2
15280155,"Apical <e>potassium</e> channels in the rat connecting tubule.Apical membrane K channels in the rat connecting tubule (CNT) were studied using the patch-clamp technique. Tubules were isolated from the cortical labyrinth of the kidney and split open to provide access to the apical membrane. Cell-attached patches were formed on presumed principal and/or connecting tubule cells. The major channel type observed had a single-channel conductance of 52 pS, high open probability and kinetics that were only weakly dependent on voltage. These correspond closely to the  SK -type channels in the cortical collecting duct, identified with the ROMK (Kir1.1) gene product. A second channel type, which was less frequently observed, mediated larger currents and was strongly activated by depolarization of the apical membrane voltage. These were identified as BK or maxi-K channels. The density of active SK channels revealed a high degree of clustering. Although heterogeneity of tubules or of cell types within a tubule could not be excluded, the major factor underlying the distribution appeared to be the presence of channel clusters on the membrane of individual cells. The overall density of channels was higher than that previously found in the cortical collecting tubule (CCT). In contrast to results in the CCT, we did not detect an increase in the overall density of SK channels in the apical membrane after feeding the animals a high-K diet. However, the activity of amiloride-sensitive Na channels was undetectable under control conditions but was increased after both 1 day (90 +/- 24 pA/cell) or 7 days (385 +/- 82 pA/cell) of K loading. Thus one important factor leading to an increased K secretion in the CNT in response to increased dietary K is an increased apical Na conductance, leading to depolarization of the apical membrane voltage and an increased driving force for K movement out into the tubular lumen.",M2
15238618,"Plasticity of mouse renal collecting duct in response to <e>potassium</e> depletion.Plasticity of mouse renal collecting duct in response to potassium depletion.--Renal collecting ducts are the main sites for regulation of whole body potassium balance. Changes in dietary intake of potassium induce pleiotropic adaptations of collecting duct cells, which include alterations of ion and water transport properties along with an hypertrophic response. To study the pleiotropic adaptation of the outer medullary collecting duct (OMCD) to dietary potassium depletion, we combined functional studies of renal function (ion, water, and acid/base handling), analysis of OMCD hypertrophy (electron microscopy) and hyperplasia (PCNA labeling), and large scale analysis of gene expression (transcriptome analysis). The transcriptome of OMCD was compared in mice fed either a normal or a potassium-depleted diet for 3 days using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) adapted for downsized extracts. SAGE is based on the generation of transcript-specific tag libraries. Approximately 20,000 tags corresponding to 10,000 different molecular species were sequenced in each library. Among the 186 tags differentially expressed (P &lt; 0.05) between the two libraries, 120 were overexpressed and 66 were downregulated. The SAGE expression profile obtained in the control library was representative of different functional classes of proteins and of the two cell types (principal and alpha-intercalated cells) constituting the OMCD. Combined with gene expression analysis, results of functional and morphological studies allowed us to identify candidate genes for distinct physiological processes modified by potassium depletion: sodium, potassium, and water handling, hyperplasia and hypertrophy. Finally, comparison of mouse and human OMCD transcriptomes allowed us to address the question of the relevance of the mouse as a model for human physiology and pathophysiology.",M2

15447920,"The ratio of animal protein intake to <e>potassium</e> intake is a predictor of bone resorption in space flight analogues and in ambulatory subjects.BACKGROUND: Bone loss is a critical concern for space travelers, and a dietary countermeasure would be of great benefit. Dietary protein and potassium-associated bicarbonate precursors may have opposing effects on the acid-base balance in the body and therefore on bone loss. OBJECTIVE: In 2 studies, we examined the ability of dietary protein and potassium to predict markers of bone metabolism. DESIGN: In the first study, 8 pairs of male identical twins were assigned to 1 of 2 groups: bed rest (sedentary, or SED, group) or bed rest with supine treadmill exercise in a lower-body negative pressure chamber (EX group). In a second study, groups of 4 subjects lived in a closed chamber for 60 or 91 d, and dietary data were collected for two or three 5-d sessions. Urinary calcium, N-telopeptide, and pyridinium cross-links were measured before bed rest; on bed rest days 5-6, 12-13, 19-20, and 26-27; and daily during the chamber studies. Data were analyzed by Pearson's correlation (P &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: The ratio of animal protein intake to potassium intake was significantly correlated with N-telopeptide in the SED group during bed rest weeks 3 and 4 (r = 0.77 and 0.80) and during the 91-d chamber study (r = 0.75). The ratio of animal protein intake to potassium intake was positively correlated with pyridinium cross-links before bed rest in the EX group (r = 0.83), in the EX group during bed rest week 1 (r = 0.84), and in the SED group during bed rest week 2 (r = 0.72) but not during either chamber study. In both studies, these relations were not significant with the ratio of vegetable protein intake to potassium intake. CONCLUSIONS: The ratio of animal protein intake to potassium intake may affect bone in ambulatory and bed-rest subjects. Changing this ratio may help to prevent bone loss on Earth and during space flight.",M2
15333723,"Blood pressure response to dietary modifications in free-living individuals.A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy foods has been shown to lower blood pressure (BP) when all foods are provided. We compared the effect on BP (measured at home) of 2 different self-selected diets: a low-sodium, high-<e>potassium</e> diet, rich in fruit and vegetables (LNAHK) and a high-calcium diet rich in low-fat dairy foods (HC) with a moderate-sodium, high-potassium, high-calcium DASH-type diet, high in fruits, vegetables and low-fat dairy foods (OD). Subjects were randomly allocated to 2 test diets for 4 wk, the OD and either LNAHK or HC diet, each preceded by a 2 wk control diet (CD). The changes in BP between the preceding CD period and the test diet period (LNAHK or HC) were compared with the change between the CD and the OD periods. Of the 56 men and 38 women that completed the OD period, 43 completed the LNAHK diet period and 48 the HC diet period. The mean age was 55.6 +/- 9.9 (+/-SD) years. There was a fall in systolic pressure between and the CD and OD [-1.8 +/- 0.5 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001)]. Compared with OD, systolic and diastolic BPs fell during the LNAHK diet period [-3.5 +/- 1.0 (P &lt; 0.001) and -1.9 +/- 0.7 (P &lt; 0.05) mmHg, respectively] and increased during the HC diet period [+3.1 +/- 0.9 (P &lt; 0.01) and +0.8 +/- 0.6 (P = 0.15) mm Hg, respectively]. A self-selected low-sodium, high-potassium diet resulted in a greater fall in BP than a multifaceted OD, confirming the beneficial effect of dietary intervention on BP in a community setting.",M2
