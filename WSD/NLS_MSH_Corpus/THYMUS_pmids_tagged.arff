19555688,"Trichinella spiralis: Effect of <e>thymus</e> factor X on apoptosis and necrosis in mice.The aim of the study was to determine the effect of thymus factor X (TFX-Jelfa) on the percentage of apoptotic and necrotic lymphocytes in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and muscle tissue of mice infected with 200 larvae of Trichinella spiralis. TFX was administered subcutaneously at a dose of 15mg/kg. On days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 60 after infection, apoptotic and necrotic cells were detected by flow cytometry after staining with the Annexin V-Fluos Staining Kit. TFX increased the percentage of apoptotic lymphocytes in the spleen, mesenteric lymph nodes, and muscle tissue of mice infected with T. spiralis. The effect of TFX on the percentage of necrotic lymphocytes was weaker and less clear. Parasite load was lower in infected mice treated with TFX than in the untreated control mice. The effect of TFX on the host immune response and the survival of parasite larvae was therefore probably affected by the extent of inflammatory infiltrates, and not by the percentage of lymphocytes undergoing apoptosis.",M1
17186670,"Reevaluation of antimicrobial and antioxidant activity of <e>Thymus</e> spp. extracts before and after encapsulation in liposomes.The antioxidant and antimicrobial activity of four Thymus species (boissieri, longicaulis, leucospermus, and ocheus) extracts were determined. Two methods (Rancimat and malondialdehyde by high-performance liquid chromatography) were used to measure the antioxidant action in comparison with common commercial antioxidants, including butylated hydroxytoluene and alpha-tocopherol. The extracts that presented high antioxidant activity were encapsulated in liposomes and their antioxidant action was again estimated. Thermal-oxidative decomposition of the samples (pure liposomes and encapsulating extracts) was studied using the differential scanning calorimetry method. The modification of the main transition temperature for the lipid mixture and the splitting of the calorimetric peak in the presence of the antioxidants were also demonstrated by differential scanning calorimetry. All extracts showed antioxidant and antimicrobial activities. Some extracts showed superior or equal antioxidant activity to alpha-tocopherol. When the extracts were encapsulated in liposomes, their antioxidant as well as antimicrobial activities proved to be superior from the same extracts in pure form.",M1

Successful immune reconstitution after AHSCT may reduce recurrence; therefore this study was to explore the characteristics of immune reconstitution after AHSCT and assess its feasibility in clinical use. METHODS: Twenty four cases after AHSCT were enrolled in our study. There were 19 Non-hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL), 3 Hodgkin Lymphoma (HD) and 2 rhabdomyosarcoma. Nineteen cases had achieved complete remission (CR) while 5 partial remission (PR) before AHSCT. All cases were administered Interleukin (IL)-2 and Interferon (IFN)-alpha after AHSCT. Some patients were given <e>thymus</e> factor and/or CIK infusion. Phenotypes of peripheral blood T, B, NK subsets and immunological profile of TH1/TH2 by intracellular staining of cytokines after PMA/ionomycin stimulation were evaluated. RESULTS: 75% of the cases achieved CR while 4.17% were progression of disease (PD) and 16.67% were relapsed during the median follow-up time of 12 (2-60) months. The changes of immune parameters after AHSCT were as followed: (1) CD4+T cells (normal control 33.5+/-6.9%) started to decrease dramatically one month after AHSCT, which was 2.5-13% (median rate 5.6%)in the 2nd month; and then slowly increased to 10-20% in the 7th month, but did not return back to normal even after one year in all patients. In addition, reversed ratio of CD4/CD8 lasted for a long period of time. B cells also began to decrease 1 month after AHSCT, and recovered to normal in the 4th month. But B cells remained 0% in the 6th month and 1% in 12th month in patients treated by rituximab before receiving AHSCT. The ratio of NK cells was 10-20% (higher than normal controls) in the 2nd month, then returned to normal thereafter. (2) The cytokine secretion by T cell: there were 48.79% patients whose TH1 was lower than normal controls or at the lower limit of normal range. All the patients with normal TH1 were treated by IFN-alpha or CIK cell infusion. TH2 was much higher than normal level among 68.29% cases and this abnormality lasted at least for 1 year in some cases. TH2 at normal range was only observed in cases receiving IFN-alpha treatment. Furthermore, IFN-alpha could significantly decrease TH2 level. (3) Increasing tendency of CD4+CD25+/CD4+, CD4+CD69+/CD4+ ratio was observed in patients received additional thymus factor treatment compared to those did not. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of CIK cells, thymus factor, IL-2 and IFN-alpha after AHSCT could improve the immunologic function of patients, and TH1/TH2 ratio may virtually reflect the immune status of patients. However more information is required to make prognostic assessments of immune reconstruction and the long-term survival rate.",M1
16407785,"Reactive oxygen intermediates and serum antioxidative system in patients with chronic C hepatitis treated with IFN-alpha and <e>thymus</e> factor X.INTRODUCTION: In this study, the chemiluminescence (CL) of peripheral blood polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNLs) and the serum total antioxidative system (TAS) were assessed in patients with chronic C hepatitis (CCH) before and after 3 and 6 months of treatment with interferon (IFN)-alpha and thymus factor X (TFX). MATERIAL/METHODS: The study included 26 patients with CCH aged between 25-63 years (mean: 42.67). Combined therapy with IFN-alpha 2a and a TFX preparation was applied. PMNL metabolic activity was assessed applying the whole-blood CL method. We measured CL response of neutrophils unstimulated and stimulated by opsonized zymosan, N-formyl-methionylleucyl-phenylalanine (N-fMLP), and phorbol-myristate-acetate (PMA) without and after priming with tumor necrosis factor alpha (10 ng/ml). The assessment of serum TAS was performed directly before the beginning of therapy with IFN-alpha and TFX and after 3 and 6 months of the treatment. A colorimetric method based on the reduction of the cationic radical ABTS*(+) (cation 2, 2'-azido-bis-[3-ethylobenzothiazolino-6-sulfonate]) in the presence of serum antioxidants was used. RESULTS: As a result of the treatment with IFN-alpha and TFX, the formation of free oxygen radicals by resting (unprimed) neutrophils increased statistically significantly both without stimulation and following stimulation by fMLP and PMA. A statistically significant increase in the serum antioxidant capacity was observed, which suggests the induction of compensatory processes. CONCLUSIONS: Increased in vitro reactive oxygen species production by both stimulated and unstimulated peripheral blood neutrophils of patients with CCH was observed. Treatment with IFN-alpha and TFX resulted in a compensatory increase in serum antioxidative capacity.",M1
15169653,"[The relationship between abnormal apoptosis and Fas expression of thymocytes from patients with myasthenia gravis]AIM: To explore the roles of abnormalities of thymocytic abnormal apoptosis and its Fas expression in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) in generation of autoimmune response. METHODS: The thymocytes were isolated and <e>thymus</e> extractive was prepared from fresh thymic tissue excised from MG patients. The proliferation of thymocyes was evaluated by MTT colorimetry. The apoptosis of thymocytes were examined by DNA electrophoresis. Expression of Fas was analyzed by a FACScan flow cytometry. Transcription and mutation of Fas gene were detected by RT-PCR and single-stranded conformation polymorphism ( SSCP) analysis. RESULTS: Thymus extractive could inhibit proliferation of normal thymocytes, while had no influence on the thymocytic proliferation of MG patients. The proliferation of thymocytes of both normal persons and MG patients could be inhibited by thymus extractive in the presence of dexamethasone. The inhibition rates were 58. 33% and 54. 26% respectively. The cocultured thymocytes with dexamethasone showed characteristic apoptosis pattern and the DNA electrophoresis exhibited 'ladder' appearance. The abnormal bands in Fas mRNA of partial MG patients' thymocytes were found by RT-PCR-SSCP analysis. CONCLUSION: Abnormalities of apoptosis and Fas gene expression of MG patients' thymocytes, and Fas gene mutation may be related to the pathogenesis and progression of MG.",M1
12512558,"Modulatory effects of calf <e>thymus</e> extract on the subset of T lymphocytes in Trichinella spiralis-infected mice.The immunotropic properties of calf thymus extract (TFX-Jelfa) is connected with the mimic action of the thymus to modulate the differentiation, maturation and function of prothymocytes and mature thymus dependent (T) cells. The studies were carried out on CFW male mice aged 3 months. The animals were infected per os with 200 larvae of Trichinella spiralis. TFX-Jelfa was administered i.p. at a dose of 10 mg/kg seven times at 24 hour intervals prior to infection. The percentage of CD4+ and CD8+ in suspension of splenocytes and mesenteric lymphonode cells by flow cytometry using monoclonal antibodies coupled with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) or phycoerythrin (PE) were determined. At the same time, cryostat preparations, made from jejunum and muscle samples, were examined by the direct immunofluorescence method using FITC-labeled antibody to mouse CD4+ and CD8+. It has been found that infection with T. spiralis in mice decreases the percentage of CD8+ splenocytes, while the percentage of CD8+ mesenteric lymphonode cells does not change. However, in infected mice the percentage of CD4+ spleen cells and mesenteric lymphonode cells is increased. It has been also found that during the course of infection an increase in the number of CD8+ and CD4+ cells in the basal lamina propria of the intestines was observed. In infected mice, CD4+ lymphocytes were visible in the inflammatory infiltrates of the muscle tissue on the 14th day, whereas CD8+ lymphocytes were first observed a week later. Pretreatment with TFX does not change the inhibitory effect of infection on the percentage of CD8+ splenocytes, but potentiates the percentage of CD4+ spleen cells and mesenteric lymphonode cells increased by infection. Furthermore, administration of TFX prior to infection also potentiates the stimulatory effect of T. spiralis on the number of CD8+ and CD4+ in the basal lamina propria of the jejunum, and on the number of CD8+ cells in the inflammatory infiltrates of the muscle tissue.",M1
11254741,"Reactivity of anti-proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) murine monoclonal antibodies and human autoantibodies to the PCNA multiprotein complexes involved in cell proliferation.Proliferating cell nuclear Ag (PCNA) occurs as a component of multiprotein complexes during cell proliferation. We found the complexes to react with murine anti-PCNA mAbs, but not with anti-PCNA Abs in lupus sera. The complexes were purified from rabbit <e>thymus</e> extract by affinity chromatography using anti-PCNA mAbs (TOB7, TO17, and TO30) and analyzed by ELISA, immunoprecipitation, immunoblotting, and HPLC gel filtration. That PCNA was complexed with other proteins was demonstrated by its copurification with a group of proteins excluded by an HPLC G3000 SW column. Although immunoblot analysis showed the mAbs to react exclusively with the 34-kDa PCNA polypeptide, they nonetheless immunoprecipitated the same group of proteins, confirming the interaction of the isolated PCNA with other proteins. Anti-PCNA sera, including AK, which reacts with biologically functional sites on PCNA, did not react with complexed PCNA, but did react with it once it was dissociated from the complexes. PCNA complexes in turn reacted with murine anti-DNA mAbs, as well as with Abs against p21, replication protein A, DNA helicase II, cyclin-dependent kinases 4 and 5, and topoisomerase I. These findings suggest that the PCNA complexes purified using anti-PCNA mAbs comprise the  protein machinery  for DNA replication and cell cycle regulation. They also suggest that anti-PCNA mAbs are useful tools with which to characterize the protein-protein interactions within PCNA complexes, as well as the autoimmune responses to proteins interacting with PCNA, which may shed light on the mechanisms of autoantibody production in lupus patients.",M1
10554540,"[Immunomodulating therapy of psoriasis vulgaris]BACKGROUND: Newest studies have shown that psoriasis is not primarily a skin disorder but an immunological disturbance under the skin. The skin manifestations are a result of overstimulation of superficial skin cells (Langerhans cells) due to increased production of interleukin 2, 6 and 8 as well as transforming growth-factor-alpha. Interleucin-10 production is diminished. In a recent study (11 German University Skin Clinics) fumaric acid was shown to improve the skin leasons in 80% of treated patients. OWN EXPERIENCES: Our own studies on 54 patients which where treated in addition with intravenous <e>thymus</e> extract (Thymoject) and selenium (Selenase) showed a faster healing rate with fumaric acid alone. From these results one can postulate that the above treatments (fumaric acid, thymus and selenium) have a synergystic effect. CONCLUSIONS: Internal immunmodulating treatments should therefore have preference over external symptomatic treatments like UV-light, ointments, salt water bath, etc.",M1

10460987,"Modulation of mouse brain cortex adrenoceptor in old mice by supplementation of zinc and thymomodulin.BACKGROUND: Previous experiments have shown that the age-related decrease of mouse brain cortex adrenoceptor density can be recovered by grafting a neonatal <e>thymus</e> into old recipients. The question arises whether similar results can also be obtained in the presence of a single thymic factor such as thymomodulin (TMD). It is worth noting that the activity of some thymic factors is strictly zinc (Zn) dependent and that their age-related decreased production is recovered in old mice supplemented with Zn. OBJECTIVE: The above-mentioned evidences prompted us to verify whether Zn and TMD, either alone or combined, are able to induce some corrective effects on age-dependent alterations of adrenoceptor characteristics of the mouse brain cortex. METHODS: Thus, we performed experiments on four groups of Balb/c mice treated with saline, Zn, TMD, or both Zn and TMD. Treatments started when animals were 18 months old and ran for 6 months. The alpha(1)- and beta-Adrenoceptor characteristics were assayed by steady state binding analysis using labelled prazosine and iodocyanopindolol, respectively. Data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance, followed, when appropriate, by multiple-comparison analysis. RESULTS: Results show an increase of beta-adrenoceptor density and a decrease of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor density in both Zn- and Zn+TMD-treated animals when compared to saline-treated controls, while receptor affinities did not change significantly. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of action of TMD suggests that this type of treatment cannot mimic the effects of grafting the whole gland; it cannot be excluded that different time-dose schedule could be more effective. Zn treatment, on the other hand, does modulate adrenoceptors; however, it shows a corrective action on the age-related decreased density of beta-adrenoceptors, but further decreases that of alpha(1)-adrenoceptors. This differential action could be due to their differential physiological role.",M1
10458105,"Effect of <e>thymus</e> extract on immunologic reactivity of chicken vaccinated with infectious bursal disease virus.The effects of crude thymus extract on the immune response and protection against challenge with virulent infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) were studied in one-day-old chick. Oral administration of thymus extract (1 ml/kg) markedly and significantly increased the total protein, albumin, globulin, Tri-iodothyronine (T3), Thyroxine (T4) and the body weight gain in one-day-old chick. In addition, it increased the total lymphocytic count over four weeks after administration. Although vaccination also increased total protein, globulin, T4 and the total lymphocytic count but it significantly decreased the body weight gain of the chick and administration of thymus extract, before, during or after vaccination markedly improved the vaccination effectiveness with significant elevation of the globulin level and body weight gain of the chick. It also prevented the decrease in the relative weights of bursa, spleen and thyroid gland which commonly prevailed during vaccination. Chicken administered thymus extract and vaccinated with infectious bursal disease (IBD) vaccine showed 100% protection against challenge with IBDV. Meanwhile the vaccinated non-thymus treated group exhibited 80% protection against IBDV challenge. These results indicate a potentiating effect of thymus extract on the immune system in baby chick. These findings are supported by ELISA results that showed a marked increase in antibody titers in thymus treated groups. Additionally, microscopical examination of the bursa and the existent lymphoid hyperplasia in thymus treated groups but not vaccinated group support our findings.",M1

8872493,"Effect of DTC on humoral response of SRBC-immunized mice exposed to restraint stress. Comparison with calf <e>thymus</e> extract.The studies were conducted on Balb/c mice exposed to restraint stress twice for 12 h at 24 h intervals. Some of the experimental mice were immunized i.p. with sheep red blood cells (SRBC). The antigen was injected before the first exposure of the mice to restraint stress, or immediately after the second loading was ended. Sodium diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) at a dose of 20 mg/kg or calf thymus extract (TFX) at a dose of 10 mg/kg were injected i.p. four times at 24 h intervals, before or after the exposure to restraint stress. In our experiment restraint stress drastically reduced the number of thymocytes and splenocytes as well as the weight ratio of the thymus and spleen and the changes sustained for 10 days of the observation. Besides, humoral response of the restrained mice to SRBC was deteriorated, as the number of plaque forming cells (PFC) and anti-SRBC antibody titers (total and 2-mercaptoethanol resistant) decreased. The suppressive action of the stress on humoral response was weaker when the antigen injection preceded the first exposure of mice to restraint stress as compared with that observed when antigen stimulation took place immediately after the exposure of mice to stress. It has been found that DTC and TFX administered to mice either before or after the exposure to restraint stress effectively inhibit stress-induced immunosupression. The protective or immunomodulating action of the two drugs is expressed in accelerated and enhanced recovery of the spleen and thymus and in total or partial restoration of the humoral response to thymus-dependent antigen. TFX, administered after the exposure of mice to restraint stress, proves to have a stronger protective and reconstructive impact on thymus, while DTC has a stronger restoring effect on the humoral response dependent on effector T lymphocytes. DTC administered immediately after the exposure of mice to restraint stress results in total restoration of humoral response to SRBC.",M1

7696339,"The <e>thymus</e> extract Thymex-L potentiates the retinoic acid-induced differentiation of the human myeloid leukemia cell line HL-60.The human promyelocytic cell line HL-60 can be differentiated with retinoic acid (RA) along the granulocytic pathway. Numerous studies have identified many synergistic combinations of RA with cytostatics, cytokines and other inducers. A combination of RA with the crude thymus extract Thymex-L increased differentiation of HL-60 cells as confirmed by two functional assays and morphology, whereas the extract itself did not show any effect. The functional markers phagocytosis-associated chemiluminescence and nitroblue tetrazolium reduction were more enhanced (up to 4-fold with 1000 micrograms/ml Thymex-L) than morphology. The effect was found over a wide RA concentration range (10(-11) - 10(-6) M) and was dependent on extract concentration. The half-maximal induction of both functional markers was reached at 400 micrograms/ml. To achieve the same effect with the combination in comparison with RA alone, an RA dose reduction of about 100-fold was estimated. The effect was also seen when the cells were pretreated with the thymus extract for two days. The enhancement of RA action by Thymex-L was not correlated with an increase of extracellular or intracellular RA concentration. The active compound in Thymex-L is heat stable and bigger than 5 kDa as confirmed by gelfiltration. The defined thymus peptides thymosin alpha 1, prothymosin alpha 1 and thymopentin were unable to synergistically enhance HL-60 differentiation. These data suggest that the treatment with a thymus extract can increase the sensitivity of HL-60 cells for RA. This may have clinical implications.",M1

Thymomodulin (TMD) contains <e>thymus</e> polypeptides (&lt; 10,000 D) and it has been used in a variety of disorders associated with defective immunological functions. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect on polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMNs) phagocytosis and oxidative burst of a 6-week treatment with 160 mg/day TMD orally in elderly subjects (85.5 +/- 9.7 years). Elderly subjects have impaired PMN phagocytosis and the following release of oxidant radicals. Treatment with TMD for 6 weeks had a restoring effect; phagocytosis and the phagocytic index were significantly improved, with increases of 132.6% and 112.5%. These findings indicate that TMD might be given to enhance the immunodefenses of immunocompromised elderly subjects. Luminol-dependent chemiluminescence was increased by 15.6%, which was not significant, indicating a different response between phagocytosis and release of oxidant radicals.",M1

7989133,"CD4-8- T-cells increase in MRI/lpr mice treated with thymic factors.The in vivo effect of thymic factors on immature lymphocytes was analysed in MRL/lpr mice. This strain carries a genetic defect that causes during their life cycle a block of T-cell differentiation and abnormal proliferation of CD4-8- (double-negative, DN) T-lymphocytes. In vivo administration of four preparations of thymic factors, thymopentin (TP-1), thymopoietin (TP-5), thymolymphotropin (TLT), and thymomodulin (TMD) into young (2-month-old) MRL/lpr mice induced a significant increase of DN T-cells both in the <e>thymus</e> and in the peripheral lymph nodes, with a concomitant decrease of double-positive (DP) T-cells in the thymus and of single-positive (SP) T-cells in the lymph nodes. The level of DNA fragmentation measured as propidium iodide fluorescence was increased in the thymus population of young mice and in the lymph node population of old mice treated with TLT. SCID mice transplanted with lymph node cells from MRL/lpr donors (MRL--&gt;SCID) developed graft versus host (GvH) reaction due to the activation of MRL CD8+ alloreactive T-cells. This model was used to analyse the effect of TMD/TLT in vivo on MRL cell proliferation and expansion; in fact, spleen cells from MRL--&gt;SCID mice after treatment with TMD/TLT showed an increased cell proliferation, and an expansion of DN T-cells with a concomitant decrease of SP cells (both CD4+ and CD8+ cells). Decreased SP cell numbers in this context could explain why TMD/TLT treatment of SCID mice engrafted with MRL cells increased their survival compared to untreated MRL--&gt;SCID mice.",M1

7534493,"Effects of non-specific immunostimulants (echinacin, isoprinosine and <e>thymus</e> factors) on the infection and antigen expression in herpesvirus-6 exposed human lymphoid cells.Non-specific immunostimulants such as plant extracts and natural and synthetic thymic preparations are widely used for enhancing the reactivity of the human defence system in chronic infections, immunodeficiency, autoimmunity and neoplastic diseases. Considering the high prevalence of latent infections by Lymphotropic herpesviruses and their frequent spontaneous reactivation, one wonders whether the stimulation of lymphoid cells by such immunostimulants may further support virus reactivation. We have performed tissue culture experiments using the well defined infectious system of human herpesvirus-6 (HHV-6) and the immature T cell HSB2 to test the effects of echinacin, isoprinosine and thymus factors on the frequency and extent of virus antigen expression in infected cells. The results show that various viral antigens related to virus replication and to the synthesis of structural components appear earlier in cells stimulated with such substances as echinacin, timunox and TP-1, but not following the stimulation with isoprinosine. Similarly, virus genome containing cells as determined by in situ hybridization techniques increased after stimulation with thymic preparations (thymostimulin and thymopentin), but not with echinacin and isoprinosine. The data suggest that the synthesis of proteins or DNA of lymphotropic viruses may be transiently enhanced when lymphoid cells are stimulated by certain non-specific immunostimulants. There was no evidence, however, of increased virus replication. Since the data presented here are rather preliminary results from tissue culture studies, the use of such substances in patients should include a critical monitoring of the activity of lymphotropic viruses to exclude untoward effects through persistent viral activity and/or autoimmune dysregulations (e.g. secondary to selective expression of viral antigens). More detailed studies are needed to this effect including long-term controls in patients treated by these substances.",M1

8472059,"Thymomodulin enhances phagocytic and intracellular killing activities of polymorphonuclear leucocytes without increasing release of chemotactic factors.Thymomodulin, a calf <e>thymus</e> derivative, is able to stimulate T-lymphocytes and monocytes, and to activate phagocytes and their precursors. However, it is not fully understood whether the effect of thymomodulin on phagocytic cells is a direct stimulation, or a phenomenon mediated by cytokines released by mononuclear cells. To answer this question, we first evaluated the effects of thymomodulin on the phagocytosis and intracellular killing of Staphylococcus aureus by blood polymorphonuclear cells (PMNs), cultured with or without autologous mononuclear cells. Secondly, during the processes of phagocytosis and intracellular killing, we evaluated the release by PMNs of chemotactic factors for PMNs, lymphocytes and monocytes. No difference was found in the phagocytosis and killing processes when PMNs were incubated alone or with autologous mononuclear cells (p &gt; 0.05, each comparison). Thymomodulin was able to increase the phagocytosis process when PMNs were incubated with lymphocytes and monocytes (p = 0.05), and to enhance the killing by PMNs cultured alone (p = 0.05), or cultured with autologous mononuclear cells (p &lt; 0.05). The release of chemotactic factors for PMNs, lymphocytes and monocytes in the supernatants of the phagocytosis experiments, was higher when PMNs were incubated with mononuclear cells, compared to cultures of PMNs alone (p &lt; 0.05, each comparison); and thymomodulin did not increase their release without the presence of autologous mononuclear cells in the cultures (p &gt; 0.05 each comparison).

The treatment resulted in the increase of CD8, CD3 determinants and a decrease of antigens determined by OKT10 antibodies (CD38). It is supposed that an increase of CD3 and CD8 determinants is caused by stimulation of T-lymphocyte proliferation and suppressor cell function by vilosen. Since CD38 marker is predominantly on the surface of immature and activated T-cells, which do not occur in circulating blood, it can be supposed that decrease of CD38 in the euglobulin fraction of serum reflects a shedding of these determinants from T-cells of <e>thymus</e> and peripheral lymphoid organs.",M1
8203274,"Pharmacokinetic investigation with 125I labeled T-actemodulin (TAM).The aim of the study was to label TAM with radioactive iodine and to follow its distribution in different organs of rats. T-actemodulin is a thymic hormone isolated from calf <e>thymus</e> by a new technology. TAM was labeled according to the method of Greenwood and Hunter. Two major peaks were observed on the gel chromatography: The first peak contained the labeled TAM; the second peak contained 125I which was not bound to the organic compound. Additional purification of the first peak was performed on a Sephadex G-75 column, and the eluate was designated as purified peak I. After a radioimmune testing it could be concluded that TAM was labeled successfully and the peak I contained 125I-TAM. Peak I, purified peak I and the peak II were applied to young male Wistar rats. The radioactivity of pancreas, kidney, spleen, adrenals, liver, thymus, bone marrow, testis and thyroid were measured after killing the animals 10 min, 60 min, and 24 h after the injections. The pharmacokinetic study showed that all organs, except for the thyroid have a higher affinity for labeled TAM than for the free 125I. Higher accumulation of labeled TAM was observed in the pancreas, kidney, adrenals and spleen. A specific uptake of labeled TAM in these organs can be suggested. Functional interrelations between thymus and pancreas, spleen, adrenals are discussed.",M1

Tołpa Peat Preparation (TPP) was administered in doses of 10 and 50 mg/kg on the day of immunization and then every 24 hours for 3 consecutive days. It was given both to mice cyclophosphamide-treated and non-treated. Calf thymus extract (TFX) was administered (1 and 5 mg/kg) parallelly, for comparison with TPP. The following immunologic indices were determined: percent of splenocytes forming E- and EAC-rosettes, number of plaque-forming cells (PFC) and the levels of 19S+7S and 7S anti-SRBC haemagglutinins. The immunosuppressing action of a single cyclophosphamide dose decreased the percentage of EAC rosettes, number of PFC and serum anti-SRBC haemagglutinin titre. TPP is able to restore the percent of EAC rosettes, the number of PFC and anti-SRBC haemagglutinin titre, either partially or totally, after cyclophosphamide-induced immunosuppression. The effectiveness of TPP depends mainly on the dose and timing of cyclophosphamide administration prior to SRBC immunization. The most pronounced restoration of the cells in mice was observed with the TPP dose of 50 mg/kg after cyclophosphamide suppression 144 h before immunization. TFX (1 mg/kg) only partially restored the number of PFC and 7S anti-SRBC haemagglutinin titre, which had been depressed due to cyclophosphamide treatment 144 h prior to immunization. However, it did not change the depressing effect of cyclophosphamide on the percent of EAC rosette-forming splenocytes.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

Screening for antibodies against U1snRNP proteins in human sera.Antibodies to uridylic acid rich small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (UsnRNP) are mainly detected in patients with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) or mixed connective tissue disease (MCTD). Particularly those directed against epitopes of the 70K protein of U1snRNP serve as important markers for the diagnosis of MCTD. To establish an ELISA for determination of anti-70K protein antibodies in patients' sera a 1239 bp long cDNA insert coding for the epitopes of the 70K protein was ligated into a fusion expression vector. The bacterially expressed fusion protein was purified by chromatography on DEAE cellulose. Microtiter plates were coated with the fusion protein as well as with partially purified calf <e>thymus</e> extract (CTE) containing all natural UsnRNP antigens and RNase digested calf thymus extract (CTERNase) in which the natural 70K antigen was destroyed by the nuclease treatment. 10,888 sera of patients with suspected or overt rheumatic disease were analyzed for antibodies against these antigens simultaneously. Antibodies against CTE or CTERNase were not detected in 9123 sera, none of these showed reactivity with the 70K protein indicating a high degree of specificity of the assay. Positive results in each the 70K protein, CTE as well as the CTERNase ELISAs were obtained with 474 sera. 319 sera were only positive with CTE and 70K protein. Of these 793 anti-70K protein ELISA positive sera, 79% could be confirmed by immunoblot. Of 967 sera reacting with CTE and CTERNase but not with the recombinant 70K protein, 31% contained antibodies against various other UsnRNP proteins as shown by immunoblotting. 2.4% of these sera revealed also antibodies against the 70K protein. The use of the recombinant 70K protein as antigen meets the criterion for a simple and specific assay to detect anti-U1snRNP antibodies. Nevertheless, the sole use of this recombinant protein for anti-U1snRNP antibody screening may not be appropriate, because antibodies against other frequently occurring U1snRNP proteins (A, C) cannot be detected with this test. Therefore it should be used together with a natural UsnRNP antigen until further studies in patients with well established diagnoses will show whether natural antigens may be omitted.",M1

Absence of the thymus during development results in ovarian dysgenesis characterized by a decrease in the number of follicles and corpora lutea, bringing about severe changes in reproductive function. To examine whether thymic secretions might affect ovarian activity, whole dispersed ovarian cells obtained from immature rats pretreated with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin were exposed to a thymus fraction of approximately 28 kDa and also to the media from incubated thymuses (TIM) and the conditioned media from cultured thymic reticuloepithelial cells (TCM). The thymic fraction caused a dose-dependent decrease in human chorionic gonadotrophin (hCG)-stimulated production of progesterone, oestradiol and testosterone, but had no effect on their synthesis in the absence of hCG. Similarly, hCG-induced production of these steroids was decreased by TIM and TCM. Progesterone secretion was the most markedly affected. These results suggest: (1) that the thymus contains a factor with a molecular weight of approximately 28 kDa which interacts with hCG in ovarian cells, (2) that the thymus can release active substances which modify steroid secretion by the ovary in vitro and (3) that the reticuloepithelial cells of the thymus are involved in the secretion of factors which modulate the stimulation by hCG of steroidogenesis in ovarian cells.",M1

2701749,"[Possibility of using TFX (<e>thymus</e> factor X) in the treatment of systemic lupus erythematosus]A case of a 32-year female patient with the systemic lupus erythematosus is presented. The patient was treated with prednisone in a daily dose of 40-60 mg. Due to the exacerbations of the symptoms and advanced renal disorders, the patient was given TFX together with corticotherapy. Thymus factor X is an extract of real thymus of immunorecorrective properties. It specifically acts on the lymphatic system, especially disordered mechanisms of both cellular and humoral immunity. Thymus factor X was given in the dose of 10 mg (one ampoule) i.m. for the three first months followed by one ampoule every three days for the next three months. The patient is given one ampoule of TFX once a week since the 6th months of therapy. Diminishment of the symptoms was observed. The patient is in remission since a one-year follow-up period. It was also possible to reduce the dose of prednisone to 15 mg a day. The patient is controlled every 3 months. Partial normalization of renal functioning and immunological mechanisms are seen. A decrease in antinuclear antibodies and immunoglobulins, normalization in complement components, an increase in T-cells percentage and conversion of the delayed skin reaction are noted. The authors conclude that TFX may be helpful in the treatment of the autoimmunological diseases, including the systemic lupus erythematosus.",M1

The skin test with recall-antigens and the neopterin-elimination were altered at the first day of the menstruation during the recurrence. The normalisation succeeded during therapy. In patients with recurrences in the perimenstrual time we observed a reduced T-helper/T-suppressor index during the first day of menstruation. Normal data were registered out of the recurrence time and/or under therapy. Inhibitors of the lymphokine: leucocyte/migration inhibitory factor (LIF) with a molecular weight of 6-12 KD were obtained with the specific stimulation of mononuclear cells of patients with recurrent infections with herpes labialis using the herpes-virus-1 antigen. The inhibition of fibrinolysis/proteolysis with aprotinin, tranexamic acid, phenyl-methyl-sulphonyl-fluoride and di-isopropyl-fluorophosphate could prevent the appearance of inhibitors.

2785857,"Migration of putative progenitor T cells in response to <e>thymus</e>-derived chemotactic factors.Progenitor T cells reach the thymus through the circulation from hematopoietic organs and then migrate toward the site of differentiation in the thymus. The mechanism that regulates such intrathymic migration is not well understood. In order to clarify this mechanism, in vitro chemotactic activity for murine thymocytes was assayed in the extracts and culture supernatants of thymic tissue elements. A potent thymocyte chemotactic activity was found in the extract and culture supernatant from Ig-, Ia- thymic stromal cells. Peanut agglutinin-positive (PNA+1), Thy 1+, TL-, Lyt 1+2-, L3T4- thymocytes, Ig-, Thy 1- bone marrow cells, and mononuclear cells of spleen and peripheral blood, but neither B cells nor lymph node cells, were chemotactically attracted by the factor(s). The chemotactic activity was found in none of the following materials tested: the extract and culture supernatant of thymocytes, culture supernatant of lymph node stromal cells, normal mouse serum, and zymosan-activated serum. The chemotactic activity was found in three molecular fractions by gel chromatography. The activity in all three fractions was destroyed by trypsin digestion or by heating at 56 degrees C for 30 min. These results suggest that Ig-, Ia- thymic stromal cells but not thymocytes secrete a chemotactic factor(s) for progenitor T cells with three molecular species. The factor is considered to play an important role in the migration of intrathymic progenitor T cells into the site of differentiation.",M1

For this purpose, systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured in cyclophosphamide-treated LH rats and in neonatally thymectomized LH rats receiving thymostimulin, a thymus extract. Cyclophosphamide treatment delayed the onset and attenuated the full development of hypertension in LH rats whereas it had no effect on SBP in normotensive rats (LN). Thymectomized LH rats also exhibited a significantly decreased SBP as compared to sham-operated controls. Thymostimulin treatment slightly increased the SBP of thymectomized LH rats but did not restore it to the level seen in sham-operated animals. These results showed that thymic hormonal secretions did not seem to be involved in the initiation of hypertension. By contrast, the fact that a reduction of hypertension could be obtained either by thymectomy or cyclophosphamide treatment suggested that immune disorders, mediated by thymus-dependent cellular reactions, could be of pathogenic importance in the development of hypertension in LH rats.",M1

In vitro and in vivo administered thymomodulin was able to induce the maturation of T-lymphocytes. Additionally, studies in vitro showed that this thymic derivative can enhance the functions of mature T-lymphocytes with cascading effects on B-cell and macrophage functions. Extensive human clinical trials with thymomodulin showed that this agent can improve the clinical symptoms observed with various disease processes, including infections, allergies and malignancies, and can improve immunological functions during ageing.",M1

Thymic hormone preparations of several types offer one type of approach; however, they are somewhat limited in their reconstitutive ability. Interleukins (IL), particularly IL-1 and IL-2, appear to be complementary to the actions of thymic hormones in promoting T-cell development. Two classes of thymomimetic drugs have been identified and are represented by levamisole and isoprinosine. These drugs mimic by indirect and direct actions, respectively, the actions of thymic hormones. Newer analogs of these compounds have emerged which appear more effective.

We sought evidence of EBV infection in thymuses from patients with myasthenia gravis (MG), an autoimmune disease characterized by intrathymic B-cell activation. METHODS: Seventeen MG thymuses (6 follicular hyperplastic, 6 diffuse hyperplastic, 5 involuted) and 6 control thymuses were analyzed using in situ hybridization for EBV-encoded small RNAs (EBERs), immunohistochemistry for EBV latent and lytic proteins, and polymerase chain reaction for EBV DNA and mRNA. RESULTS: All 17 MG thymuses showed evidence of active EBV infection, whereas none of the control thymuses were infected. Cells expressing EBERs (12 of 17) and EBV latency proteins (EBNA2, LMP1, and LMP2A) (16 of 17) were detected in medullary infiltrates and in germinal centers. Cells expressing early (BFRF1, BMRF1) and late (p160, gp350/220) lytic phase EBV proteins were present in 16 MG thymuses. Latency (EBNA1, LMP2A) or lytic (BZLF1) transcripts (often both) were present in all MG thymuses, and EBV DNA (LMP1 gene) was detected in 13 MG thymuses. We also found CD8+ T cells, CD56 + CD3-natural killer cells, and BDCA-2+ plasmacytoid dendritic cells in immune infiltrates of MG thymuses, but not germinal centers, suggesting an attempt of the immune system to counteract EBV infection. INTERPRETATION: Dysregulated EBV infection in the pathological thymus appears common in MG and may contribute to the immunological alterations initiating and/or perpetuating the disease.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study was approved by the institutional review board, and written consent was waived. Sagittal proton density-weighted images from MR imaging examinations of the neck and upper chest were obtained for various indications in 200 consecutive patients (121 male and 79 female; mean age, 9.0 years; interquartile range, 5.2-14.2). Images were retrospectively reviewed for frequency of superior extension of the thymus above the manubrium into the lower neck. When present, the greatest sagittal distance of the cervical extension was measured. Associated deformity of the trachea or great vessels was recorded as absent or present. The association between frequency of cervical extension and age group and sex was evaluated for statistically significant correlation by using chi(2) tests and multiple logistic regression. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-three (66.5%) patients had superior cervical extension of the thymus. The mean distance of the extension above the manubrium was 20.1 mm +/- 6.76 (standard deviation). There was a statistically significant relationship between younger age groups and higher frequency of cervical extension of the thymus (P &lt; .0001). Sex was not a statistically significant factor (P = .1645). No tracheal or vascular deformity was seen in any patient. CONCLUSION: Superior cervical extension of the thymus above the manubrium into the lower neck is normal anatomy in children and young adults.

Here, we have investigated the role of GATA3 in parathyroid function by challenging Gata3+/- mice with a diet low in calcium and vitamin D so as to expose any defects in parathyroid function. This led to a higher mortality among Gata3+/- mice compared with Gata3+/+ mice. Compared with their wild-type littermates, Gata3+/- mice had lower plasma concentrations of calcium and parathyroid hormone (PTH) and smaller parathyroid glands with a reduced Ki-67 proliferation rate. At E11.5, Gata3+/- embryos had smaller parathyroid-<e>thymus</e> primordia with fewer cells expressing the parathyroid-specific gene glial cells missing 2 (Gcm2), the homolog of human GCMB. In contrast, E11.5 Gata3-/- embryos had no Gcm2 expression and by E12.5 had gross defects in the third and fourth pharyngeal pouches, including absent parathyroid-thymus primordia. Electrophoretic mobility shift, luciferase reporter, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed that GATA3 binds specifically to a functional double-GATA motif within the GCMB promoter.

20471291,"Transforming growth factor-beta signaling curbs thymic negative selection promoting regulatory T cell development.<e>Thymus</e>-derived naturally occurring regulatory T (nTreg) cells are necessary for immunological self-tolerance. nTreg cell development is instructed by the T cell receptor and can be induced by agonist antigens that trigger T cell-negative selection. How T cell deletion is regulated so that nTreg cells are generated is unclear. Here we showed that transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling protected nTreg cells and antigen-stimulated conventional T cells from apoptosis. Enhanced apoptosis of TGF-beta receptor-deficient nTreg cells was associated with high expression of proapoptotic proteins Bim, Bax, and Bak and low expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2. Ablation of Bim in mice corrected the Treg cell development and homeostasis defects. Our results suggest that nTreg cell commitment is independent of TGF-beta signaling. Instead, TGF-beta promotes nTreg cell survival by antagonizing T cell negative selection. These findings reveal a critical function for TGF-beta in control of autoreactive T cell fates with important implications for understanding T cell self-tolerance mechanisms.",M2

We show that the affinity of the OT-I TCR for its endogenous positively selecting ligands, Catnb-H-2Kb and Cappa1-H-2Kb, is significantly lower than for previously reported positively selecting altered peptide ligands. To understand how these extremely weak endogenous ligands produce signals in maturing thymocytes, we generated soluble monomeric and dimeric peptide-H-2Kb ligands. Soluble monomeric ovalbumin (OVA)-Kb molecules elicited no detectable signaling in OT-I thymocytes, whereas heterodimers of OVA-Kb paired with positively selecting or nonselecting endogenous peptides, but not an engineered null peptide, induced deletion. In contrast, dimer-induced positive selection was much more sensitive to the identity of the partner peptide. Catnb-Kb-Catnb-Kb homodimers, but not heterodimers of Catnb-Kb paired with a nonselecting peptide-Kb, induced positive selection, even though both ligands bind the OT-I TCR with detectable affinity. Thus, both positive and negative selection can be driven by dimeric but not monomeric ligands. In addition, positive selection has much more stringent requirements for the partner self-pMHC.",M2

Lipopolysaccharide exposure modestly increased plasma cortisol concentration, increased nuclear factor-kappaB immunostaining in fetal thymus and reduced the number of FoxP3-positive cells by 40% at 1 day. CONCLUSION: Intraamniotic exposure to lipopolysaccharide induced thymic changes and influenced thymic FoxP3 expression.",M2
20415638,"Treatment with recombinant growth hormone is associated with modest improvement in CD4 lymphocyte reconstitution in HIV-infected persons on antiretroviral therapy: results of ACTG A5174.Pilot studies have suggested that treatment with recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) is associated with increased T-lymphocyte restoration and enhanced thymic output. We evaluated the immunologic effects of rhGH on HIV(+) subjects with incomplete immune reconstitution on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Sixty subjects were randomized to receive rhGH 1.5 mg scqd and ART for 48 weeks (Arm A) or continue ART alone for 24 weeks then add rhGH 3.0 mg scqd for 24 weeks (Arm B). Median baseline CD4 for Arms A and B were 223 and 219, respectively. There was little difference between Arm A and Arm B in change in total or naive CD4 cells or percentage from baseline to week 24. Only one subject in Arm A met the primary endpoint, an increase in naive CD4 percentage of at least 10 percentage points. By week 48 both Arms had statistically significant increases in naive CD4 cell count and percentage and <e>thymus</e> size. Within Arm B, treatment with rhGH was associated with significant increases in naive CD4(+) cell count and percentage compared with ART alone. Treatment with rhGH +ART may be associated with modest increases in CD4 lymphocytes over ART alone in subjects with CD4 &lt;350, yet the origin of these naive cells and their impact on immune function require further investigation.",M2
20413455,"Neural crest-derived pericytes promote egress of mature thymocytes at the corticomedullary junction.T cell egress from the <e>thymus</e> is essential for adaptive immunity, yet the requirements for and sites of egress are incompletely understood. We have shown that transgenic expression of sphingosine-1-phosphate receptor-1 (S1P1) in immature thymocytes leads to their perivascular accumulation and premature release into circulation. Using an intravascular procedure to label emigrating cells, we found that mature thymocytes exit via blood vessels at the corticomedullary junction. By deleting sphingosine kinases in neural crest-derived pericytes, we provide evidence that these specialized vessel-ensheathing cells contribute to the S1P that promotes thymic egress. Lymphatic endothelial cell-derived S1P was not required. These studies identify the major thymic egress route and suggest a role for pericytes in promoting reverse transmigration of cells across blood vessel endothelium.",M2

20404103,"S1P1 receptor directs the release of immature B cells from bone marrow into blood.S1P1 receptor expression is required for the egress of newly formed T cells from the <e>thymus</e> and exit of mature T and B cells from secondary lymphoid organs. In this study, we deleted the expression of the S1P1 receptor gene (S1pr1) in developing B cells in the bone marrow. Although B cell maturation within the bone marrow was largely normal in the B cell-specific S1pr1 knockout (B-S1pr1KO) mice, their newly generated immature B cells appeared in the blood at abnormally low numbers as compared with control mice. In the bone marrow of B-S1pr1KO mice, immature B cells in contact with the vascular compartment displayed increased apoptosis as compared with control mice. Forced expression of CD69, a negative regulator of S1P1 receptor expression, in developing bone marrow B cells also reduced the number of immature B cells in the blood. Attenuation of CXCR4 signaling, which is required for the proper retention of developing B cells in bone marrow, did not release immature B cells into the blood of B-S1pr1KO mice as effectively as in control mice. Our results indicate that the S1P1 receptor provides a signal necessary for the efficient transfer of newly generated immature B cells from the bone marrow to the blood.",M2
20404100,"Regulation of medullary thymic epithelial cell differentiation and function by the signaling protein Sin.Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) play an important role in T cell tolerance and prevention of autoimmunity. Mice deficient in expression of the signaling protein Sin exhibit exaggerated immune responses and multitissue inflammation. Here, we show that Sin is expressed in the thymic stroma, specifically in mTECs. Sin deficiency led to thymic stroma-dependent autoimmune manifestations shown by radiation chimeras and thymic transplants in nude mice, and associated with defective mTEC-mediated elimination of thymocytes in a T cell receptor transgenic model of negative selection. Lack of Sin expression correlated with a disorganized medullary architecture and fewer functionally mature mTECs under steady-state conditions. Additionally, Sin deficiency inhibited the expansion of mTECs in response to in vivo administration of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). These results identify Sin as a novel regulator of mTEC development and T cell tolerance, and suggest that Sin is important for homeostatic maintenance of the medullary epithelium in the adult <e>thymus</e>.",M2
20399959,"Breaking tolerance in a mouse model of multiple myeloma by chemoimmunotherapy.A unique mouse model of multiple myeloma (MM), namely 5T2MM-bearing mouse, was useful for elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. Increased accumulation of suppressive CD4(+)CD25(High)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) was observed in the <e>thymus</e> and lymphoid peripheral organs during disease progression. Adoptive transfer of Tregs, but not other thymocytes, from 5T2MM-bearing mice led to increased progression of disease manifestations in young syngeneic mice. Depletion of Tregs, a proposed strategy in cancer immunotherapy, was tested using cyclophosphamide (CYC), an alkylating agent with selective cytotoxicity. Both low- and high-dose CYC, administered to sick mice with hind limb paralysis, caused the paralysis to disappear, the plasma tumor cells in the bone marrow (BM) cavity to be replaced by normal cell populations, and the survival of the mice to be significantly prolonged. Low-dose CYC, which selectively depletes Tregs, decreased MM incidence, in contrast to high-dose CYC, which was generally cytotoxic, and did not reduce MM incidence. In contrast, low-dose CYC induced Tregs to become susceptible to apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-xL and CTLA-4 in these cells, and by decreasing the production of IL-2 by effector CD4 cells. This treatment consequently triggered the recovery of IFN-gamma-producing natural killer T cells and the maturation of dendritic cells. Transient gradual depletion of Tregs in low-dose CYC-treated 5T2MM mice was maintained beyond 45 days. Thus, less frequent injections of low-dose CYC enabled us to recruit compatible immune-derived cells that would reduce tumor load and delay or prevent tumor recurrence, hence breaking immune tolerance toward MM tumor cells.",M2
20394855,"Clonally expanding thymocytes having lineage capability in gamma-ray-induced mouse atrophic <e>thymus</e>.PURPOSE: To characterize, in the setting of gamma-ray-induced atrophic thymus, probable prelymphoma cells showing clonal growth and changes in signaling, including DNA damage checkpoint. METHODS AND MATERIALS: A total of 111 and 45 mouse atrophic thymuses at 40 and 80 days, respectively, after gamma-irradiation were analyzed with polymerase chain reaction for D-J rearrangements at the TCRbeta locus, flow cytometry for cell cycle, and Western blotting for the activation of DNA damage checkpoints. RESULTS: Limited D-J rearrangement patterns distinct from normal thymus were detected at high frequencies (43 of 111 for 40-day thymus and 21 of 45 for 80-day thymus). Those clonally expanded thymocytes mostly consisted of CD4(+)CD8(+) double-positive cells, indicating the retention of lineage capability. They exhibited pausing at a late G1 phase of cell cycle progression but did not show the activation of DNA damage checkpoints such as gammaH2AX, Chk1/2, or p53. Of interest is that 17 of the 52 thymuses showing normal D-J rearrangement patterns at 40 days after irradiation showed allelic loss at the Bcl11b tumor suppressor locus, also indicating clonal expansion. CONCLUSION: The thymocytes of clonal growth detected resemble human chronic myeloid leukemia in possessing self-renewal and lineage capability, and therefore they can be a candidate of the lymphoma-initiating cells.",M2

The effects of experimentally induced heat-stress on the embryonic development of bursa of Fabricius and thymus of the chicken were investigated by means of histological and enzyme histochemical methods. 2. In the experiments, 250 fertile eggs of the Ross 308 broiler strain were divided into two groups. The control eggs were maintained under optimal conditions (378 degrees C and 65 +/- 2% relative humidity, RH) during the whole incubation period. Heat stressed eggs were maintained under normal conditions (378 degrees C and 65 +/- 2% RH) until the 10th d of incubation and then exposed continuously (24 h per d) to high temperature (388 degrees C and 65 +/- 2% RH). Blood and tissue samples were taken from 10 animals of each group at d 13, 15, 18 and 21 of incubation and at d 2, 4 and 7 post-hatch. Tissue samples were processed for enzyme histochemical methods in addition to routine histological techniques. 3. The results revealed that egg temperatures were higher than incubator air temperature. Long-term heat-stress (401-406 degrees C egg temperature) retarded development of thymus and bursa of Fabricius. Peripheral blood ACP-ase and ANAE-positive lymphocyte levels of heat-stressed animals were lower than in the controls. 4. These results give some morphological evidence for immunosuppression induced by high temperature exposure during the embryonic development. Temperature distribution and air circulation in incubator should be questioned in the case of lower broiler flock immunity.",M2

20368632,"Detection of poliovirus-infected macrophages in <e>thymus</e> of patients with myasthenia gravis.BACKGROUND: Genetic and environmental factors are thought to contribute to the etiology of the autoimmune disease myasthenia gravis (MG). Viral involvement has long been suspected, but direct evidence of involvement has not been found. We recently reported that Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4)-a key activator of innate immunity-was overexpressed in the thymus of some patients with MG, suggesting that thymic infection by pathogens might be involved in MG pathogenesis. We searched for evidence of intrathymic infection in patients with MG. METHODS: Twenty-seven MG thymuses (6 involuted, 7 hyperplastic, 5 thymitis, and 9 thymoma) previously tested for TLR4 expression, 18 nonpathologic control thymuses, and 10 pathologic control thymuses from patients without MG (8 thymoma and 2 hyperplastic) were analyzed for cytomegalovirus, varicella-zoster virus, herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, eubacteria, respiratory syncytial virus, and enteroviruses using PCR techniques. Immunohistochemistry and double immunofluorescence were used to detect enterovirus capsid protein VP1 in thymic specimens and analyze TLR4 expression in VP1-positive cells. RESULTS: Poliovirus was detected in 4 MG thymuses (14.8%; 2 thymitis and 2 thymoma). No virus was detected in any control thymus. A linear correlation between plus and minus strand poliovirus RNA levels was observed in all 4 thymuses, suggesting persistent thymic infection. VP1 protein was detected in the cytoplasm of CD68-positive macrophages scattered through thymic medulla in all PV-positive thymuses. VP1 and TLR4 colocalized in infected cells. CONCLUSIONS: Poliovirus-infected macrophages are present in thymus of some patients with myasthenia gravis, suggesting a viral contribution to the intrathymic alterations leading to the disease.",M2
20368285,"Analysis of gamma delta T cell functions in the mouse.Mouse models of disease and injury have been invaluable in investigations of the functional role of gammadelta T cells.

They also suggest that functional development of gammadelta T cells occurs stepwise in <e>thymus</e> and periphery, and that it is governed by gammadelta TCR-signaling and other signals. Finally, they indicate that gammadelta T cell functions often segregate with TCR-defined subsets, in contrast to conventional T cells. From the functional studies in mice and other animal models, gammadelta T cells emerge as a distinct lymphocyte population with a unique and broad functional repertoire, and with important roles in Ab responses, inflammation and tissue repair. They also are revealed as a potentially useful target for immune intervention.",M2
20368277,"Gene coexpression analysis in single cells indicates lymphomyeloid copriming in short-term hematopoietic stem cells and multipotent progenitors.Progressive restriction to a differentiation pathway results from both activation and silencing of particular gene expression programs. To identify the coexpression and the expression levels of regulatory genes during hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) differentiation toward the T cell branch, we applied a new single-cell RT-PCR technique to analyze the simultaneous expression of 13 genes in 9 functionally purified populations from the bone marrow and the <e>thymus</e>. We report in this paper that Lin(-)Sca1(+)ckit(+) HSCs display, at the single-cell level, a homogeneous and high transcriptional activity as do early thymic progenitors. Moreover, the coexpression of lymphoid and myeloid genes is an early event detected in approximately 30% of short-term HSC and most multipotent progenitors, suggesting novel sources for the generation of early thymic progenitors, common lymphoid progenitors (CLPs), and common myeloid progenitors. Loss of multipotency in Lin(-)Sca1(+)ckit(+) cells directed to the lymphoid branch is characterized by Lmo2 and Gata2 gene expression downregulation. Indeed, highest levels of Gata2 expression are detected only in long-term and short-term HSC populations. Complete shutdown of Pu1 gene expression in all triple-negative (TN)3 stage thymic pre-T cells is indicative of total T cell commitment. Interestingly, this is also observed in 30% of TN2 cells and 25% of CLP in the bone marrow, suggesting a possible initiation of T cell engagement in TN2 and CLP. Also, our strategy highlights similar gene patterns among HSCs and intrathymic progenitors, proposing, therefore, that identical activation signals are maintained until further maturation and generation of CD4 and CD8 coreceptors bearing thymocytes.",M2
20356634,"Effect of cerebellar fastigial nuclear lesions on differentiation and function of thymocytes.We have previously shown that the cerebellum regulates functions of T, B and natural killer (NK) cells. Herein, we provide further evidence for cerebellar immunomodulation at the profiles of differentiation and maturation of thymocytes and function of mature T lymphocytes. Neuronal bodies of the fastigial nuclei (FN), one of three cerebellar nuclei, were damaged by microinjection of kainic acid (KA) in the bilateral FN. On days 12 and 32 following the KA injection, percentages of thymocyte subpopulations including CD4(-)CD8(-), CD4(+)CD8(+), CD4(+)CD8(-) and CD4(-)CD8(+) cells, apoptotic DNA fragmentation of thymocytes, and levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and interleukin-4 (IL-4) in the serum were measured by flow cytometry, diphenylamine assay and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), respectively. In the <e>thymus</e>, the percentage of CD4(+)CD8(-) cells in thymocyte population was elevated by the cerebellar FN lesions on both the 12th and the 32nd days post-lesion. The other thymocyte subsets only significantly changed at the late time point (day 32) post-lesion, with an increase in CD4(-)CD8(-) cells and a decrease in CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocytes relative to control rats with intact FN or saline-infused FN. The cerebellar FN lesions, regardless of the 12th or the 32nd day post-lesion, reduced the percentage of thymocyte DNA fragmentation and elevated the concentrations of IFN-gamma and IL-4 in the serum. However, the cerebellar cortex lesions, as an additional control to show the specificity of the FN-lesion results, did not significantly alter the differentiation and apoptosis of thymocytes. These results reveal that the cerebellar FN lesions accelerate the differentiation of thymocytes into mature helper T lymphocytes in the thymus and enhance function of the helper T cells in the peripheral immune tissue. Collectively, these findings suggest a substantial modulation of immune system by the cerebellum.",M2

We provide here an overview of the recent works focusing on the immunological evaluation of subjects thymectomized during early childhood due to cardiac surgery of congenital heart defects.

20348955,"SSBP2 is an in vivo tumor suppressor and regulator of LDB1 stability.SSBP proteins bind and stabilize transcriptional cofactor LIM domain-binding protein1 (LDB1) from proteosomal degradation to promote tissue-specific transcription through an evolutionarily conserved pathway. The human SSBP2 gene was isolated as a candidate tumor suppressor from a critical region of loss in chromosome 5q14.1. By gene targeting, we show increased predisposition to B-cell lymphomas and carcinomas in Ssbp2(-/-) mice. Remarkably, loss of Ssbp2 causes increased LDB1 turnover in the <e>thymus</e>, a pathway exploited in Trp53(-/-)Ssbp2(-/-) mice to develop highly aggressive, immature thymic lymphomas. Using T-cell differentiation as a model, we report a stage-specific upregulation of Ssbp2 expression, which in turn regulates LDB1 turnover under physiological conditions. Furthermore, transcript levels of pTalpha, a target of LDB1-containing complex, and a critical regulator T-cell differentiation are reduced in Ssbp2(-/-) immature thymocytes. Our findings suggest that disruption of the SSBP2-regulated pathways may be an infrequent but critical step in malignant transformation of multiple tissues.",M2
20307209,"On the composition of the preimmune repertoire of T cells specific for Peptide-major histocompatibility complex ligands.Millions of T cells are produced in the <e>thymus</e>, each expressing a unique alpha/beta T cell receptor (TCR) capable of binding to a foreign peptide in the binding groove of a host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule. T cell-mediated immunity to infection is due to the proliferation and differentiation of rare clones in the preimmune repertoire that by chance express TCRs specific for peptide-MHC (pMHC) ligands derived from the microorganism. Here we review recent findings that have altered our understanding of how the preimmune repertoire is established. Recent structural studies indicate that a germline-encoded tendency of TCRs to bind MHC molecules contributes to the MHC bias of T cell repertoires. It has also become clear that the preimmune repertoire contains functionally heterogeneous subsets including recent thymic emigrants, mature naive phenotype cells, memory phenotype cells, and natural regulatory T cells. In addition, sensitive new detection methods have revealed that the repertoire of naive phenotype T cells consists of distinct pMHC-specific populations that consistently vary in size in different individuals. The implications of these new findings for the clonal selection theory, self-tolerance, and immunodominance are discussed.",M2
20303297,"Fate mapping reveals separate origins of T cells and myeloid lineages in the <e>thymus</e>.The cellular differentiation pathway originating from the bone marrow leading to early T lymphocytes remains poorly understood. The view that T cells branch off from a lymphoid-restricted pathway has recently been challenged by a model proposing a common progenitor for T cell and myeloid lineages. We generated interleukin-7 receptor alpha (Il7r) Cre recombinase knockin mice and traced lymphocyte development by visualizing the history of Il7r expression. Il7r fate mapping labeled all T cells but few myeloid cells. More than 85% of T cell progenitors were Il7r reporter(+) and, hence, had arisen from an Il7r-expressing pathway. In contrast, the overwhelming majority of myeloid cells in the thymus were derived from Il7r reporter(-) cells. Thus, lymphoid-restricted progenitors are the major route to T cells, and distinct origins of lymphoid and myeloid lineages represent a fundamental hallmark of hematopoiesis.",M2
20237294,"An autoimmune response to odorant binding protein 1a is associated with dry eye in the Aire-deficient mouse.Sjögren's Syndrome (SS) is a human autoimmune disease characterized by immune-mediated destruction of the lacrimal and salivary glands. In this study, we show that the Aire-deficient mouse represents a new tool to investigate autoimmune dacryoadenitis and keratoconjunctivitis sicca, features of SS. Previous work in the Aire-deficient mouse suggested a role for alpha-fodrin, a ubiquitous Ag, in the disease process. Using an unbiased biochemical approach, however, we have identified a novel lacrimal gland autoantigen, odorant binding protein 1a, targeted by the autoimmune response. This novel autoantigen is expressed in the <e>thymus</e> in an Aire-dependent manner.

20236866,"<e>Thymus</e> transplantation.Thymus transplantation is a promising investigational therapy for infants born with no thymus. Because of the athymia, these infants lack T cell development and have a severe primary immunodeficiency. Although thymic hypoplasia or aplasia is characteristic of DiGeorge anomaly, in  complete  DiGeorge anomaly, there is no detectable thymus as determined by the absence of naive (CD45RA(+), CD62L(+)) T cells. Transplantation of postnatal allogeneic cultured thymus tissue was performed in sixty subjects with complete DiGeorge anomaly who were under the age of 2 years. Recipient survival was over 70%. Naive T cells developed 3-5 months after transplantation. The graft recipients were able to discontinue antibiotic prophylaxis, and immunoglobulin replacement. Immunosuppression was used in a subset of subjects but was discontinued when naive T cells developed. The adverse events have been acceptable with thyroid disease being the most common.

20231690,"Different proliferative potential and migratory characteristics of human CD4+ regulatory T cells that express either CD45RA or CD45RO.Although human naturally occurring regulatory T cells (Tregs) may express either CD45RA or CD45RO, we find in agreement with previous reports that the ( approximately 80%) majority of natural Tregs in adults are CD45RO(+). The proportion of CD45RA(+) Tregs decreases, whereas CD45RO(+) Tregs increase significantly with age. Nevertheless, a small proportion of CD45RA(+) Tregs are found even in old (&gt;80 y) adults and a proportion of these express CD31, a marker for recent thymic emigrants. We found that CD45RO(+) Tregs were highly proliferative compared with their CD45RA(+) counterparts. This was due in part to the conversion of CD45RA Tregs to CD45RO expression after activation. Another difference between these two Treg populations was their preferential migration to different tissues in vivo. Whereas CD45RA(+) Tregs were preferentially located in the bone marrow, associated with increased CXCR4 expression, CD45RO(+) Tregs were preferentially located in the skin, and this was associated with their increased expression of CLA and CCR4. Our studies therefore show that proliferation features strongly in maintenance of the adult Treg pool in humans and that the <e>thymus</e> may make a minor contribution to the maintenance of the peripheral pool of these cells, even in older adults. Furthermore, the different tissue compartmentalization of these cells suggests that different Treg niches exist in vivo, which may have important roles for their maturation and function.",M2
20231424,"Pharmacologic modulation of niche accessibility via tyrosine kinase inhibition enhances marrow and thymic engraftment after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.Essential survival signals within hematopoietic stem cell (HSC) and thymic niches are mediated by receptor tyrosine kinases, which can be reversibly inhibited using clinically available drugs. We studied whether sunitinib, a multityrosine kinase inhibitor that inhibits KIT, enhances engraftment after bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in mice. Sunitinib diminished hematopoietic progenitor cell numbers, and sunitinib enhanced marrow, peripheral myeloid, and lymphoid engraftment after BMT in Rag1(-/-) mice. Sunitinib augmented HSC engraftment because recipients displayed increased myeloid and lymphoid engraftment and because sunitinib-treated recipients of purified HSCs showed enhanced engraftment of secondary hosts. However, sunitinib preferentially augmented T-cell engraftment with lesser effects on myeloid and HSC engraftment. Consistent with this, sunitinib preferentially depleted the early thymic progenitor subset in the <e>thymus</e>. Sunitinib did not increase engraftment in mice with deficient KIT signaling, and the pattern of more potent effects on T cell compared with HSC engraftment observed in sunitinib-treated hosts was also observed after BMT into KIT(W/Wv) mice. These results implicate KIT as a critical modulator of thymic niches. We conclude that transient, pharmacologic inhibition of KIT enhances accessibility of marrow and thymic niches, and provides a novel, noncytotoxic approach to accomplish engraftment after stem cell transplantation.",M2
20229083,"Prolonged survival in mice with advanced tumors treated with syngeneic or allogeneic intra-bone marrow-bone marrow transplantation plus fetal <e>thymus</e> transplantation.Thymic function decreases in line with tumor progression in patients with cancer, resulting in immunodeficiency and a poor prognosis. In the present study, we attempted to restore thymic function by BALB/c (H-2(d)) syngeneic (Syn), or B6 (H-2(b)) allogeneic (Allo) bone marrow transplantation (BMT) using intra-bone marrow-bone marrow transplantation (IBM-BMT) plus Syn-, Allo- or C3H (H-2(k)) 3rd-party fetal thymus transplantation (TT). Although the BALB/c mice with advanced tumors (Meth-A sarcoma; H-2(d), &gt;4 cm(2)) treated with either Syn- or Allo-BMT alone showed a slight improvement in survival compared with non-treated controls, the mice treated with BMT + TT showed a longer survival. The mice treated with Allo-BMT + Allo-TT or 3rd-party TT showed the longest survival. Interestingly, although there was no difference in main tumor size among the BMT groups, lung metastasis was significantly inhibited by Allo-BMT + Allo-TT or 3rd-party TT. Numbers of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, Con A response, and IFN-gamma production increased significantly, whereas number of Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+) myeloid suppressor cells and the percentage of FoxP3(+) cells in CD4(+) T cells significantly decreased in these mice. Furthermore, there was a positive correlation between survival days and the number of T cells or T cell function, while there was a negative correlation between survival days and lung metastasis, the number of Gr-1(+)/CD11b(+) cells, or the percentage of FoxP3(+) cells. These results suggest that BMT + TT, particularly Allo-BMT + Allo-TT or 3rd-party TT, is most effective in prolonging survival as a result of the restoration of T cell function in hosts with advanced tumors.",M2
20228326,"Clinical and radiologic review of the normal and abnormal <e>thymus</e>: pearls and pitfalls.At imaging, the thymus appears in a variety of shapes and sizes, even in the same individual. It gradually involutes with age and may acutely shrink during periods of bodily stress. During the recovery period, it grows back to its original size or even larger, a phenomenon known as thymic rebound hyperplasia. These anatomic variations and dynamic changes appear to be the main source of confusion with pathologic conditions. In turn, these misinterpretations may lead to prolongation or alteration of the chemotherapy regimen or to unnecessary radiation therapy, biopsy, or thymectomy. Familiarity with the embryology, anatomy, and dynamic physiology of the thymus is essential to avoid unnecessary imaging or invasive procedures. Radiologists play a major role in differentiating normal thymic variants, ectopic thymic tissue, and nonneoplastic thymic conditions such as rebound hyperplasia from neoplastic conditions. Knowledge of the imaging findings of thymic tumors and their mimics may help radiologists arrive at the correct diagnosis.",M2
20227394,"Preferential effects of leptin on CD4 T cells in central and peripheral immune system are critically linked to the expression of leptin receptor.Leptin can enhance thymopoiesis and modulate the T-cell immune response. However, it remains controversial whether these effects correlate with the expression of leptin receptor, ObR. We herein addressed this issue by using in vivo animal models and in vitro culture systems. Leptin treatment in both ob/ob mice and normal young mice induced increases of CD4 SP thymocytes in <e>thymus</e> and CD4 T cells in the periphery. Interestingly, expression of the long form ObR was significantly restricted to DN, DP and CD4 SP, but not CD8 SP thymocytes. Moreover, in the reaggregated DP thymocyte cultures with leptin plus TSCs, leptin profoundly induced differentiation of CD4 SP but not CD8 SP thymocytes, suggesting that the effects of leptin on thymocyte differentiation might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor in developing thymocytes. Surprisingly, ObR expression was markedly higher in peripheral CD4 T cells than that in CD8 T cells. Furthermore, leptin treatment with or without IL-2 and PHA had preferential effects on cell proliferation of CD4 T cells compared to that of CD8 T cells. Collectively, these data provide evidence that the effects of leptin on differentiation and proliferation of CD4 T cells might be closely related to the expression of leptin receptor.",M2

Both protein and mRNA of CXCL13 and CXC chemokine receptor 5 (CXCR5) in the thymic tissues were significantly higher in MG patients with lymphoid hyperplasia than those with thymoma. Our data indicated that serum CXCL13 can be used as an index of disease severity and ectopic thymic expression of CXCL13 might be associated with aberrant cell trafficking to the <e>thymus</e> of MG.",M2
20214810,"Functional annotation of novel lineage-specific genes using co-expression and promoter analysis.BACKGROUND: The diversity of placental architectures within and among mammalian orders is believed to be the result of adaptive evolution. Although, the genetic basis for these differences is unknown, some may arise from rapidly diverging and lineage-specific genes. Previously, we identified 91 novel lineage-specific transcripts (LSTs) from a cow term-placenta cDNA library, which are excellent candidates for adaptive placental functions acquired by the ruminant lineage. The aim of the present study was to infer functions of previously uncharacterized lineage-specific genes (LSGs) using co-expression, promoter, pathway and network analysis. RESULTS: Clusters of co-expressed genes preferentially expressed in liver, placenta and <e>thymus</e> were found using 49 previously uncharacterized LSTs as seeds. Over-represented composite transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) in promoters of clustered LSGs and known genes were then identified computationally. Functions were inferred for nine previously uncharacterized LSGs using co-expression analysis and pathway analysis tools. Our results predict that these LSGs may function in cell signaling, glycerophospholipid/fatty acid metabolism, protein trafficking, regulatory processes in the nucleus, and processes that initiate parturition and immune system development. CONCLUSIONS: The placenta is a rich source of lineage-specific genes that function in the adaptive evolution of placental architecture and functions. We have shown that co-expression, promoter, and gene network analyses are useful methods to infer functions of LSGs with heretofore unknown functions. Our results indicate that many LSGs are involved in cellular recognition and developmental processes.

Although several groups have suggested that the decrease in the number of regulatory T (Treg) cells contributes to the onset of MG, the exact role of Treg cells in MG remains unclear. To address this point, we examined the number and distribution of Treg cells in a large number of patients with MG. METHODS: Immunohistofluorescence analysis of Foxp3 along with CD4 and CD8 was performed in thymic sections of MG (+) (n = 24) and MG (-) patients (n = 27). Circulating CD4(+)CD25(+) cells in the peripheral blood of patients with MG (n = 15) and age-matched healthy subjects (n = 15) were also analyzed. RESULTS: Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD8(-) cells were predominantly found in the thymic medulla and their number declined with age. There was no significant difference in the number or the distribution of Foxp3(+)CD4(+)CD8(-) cells in the thymus between MG (+) and MG (-) patients. The number of circulating CD4(+)CD25(+) cells in the peripheral blood of patients with MG was not significantly altered compared to that in healthy subjects. CONCLUSION: The cellularity of Treg cells in the thymus and circulation is not diminished in patients with myasthenia gravis.",M2
20208453,"Immunomodulatory effects of Aureobasidium pullulans SM-2001 exopolymers on the cyclophosphamide-treated mice.The immunomodulatory effects of exopolymers of Aureobasidium pullulans SM-2001 containing beta-1,3/1,6-glucan were evaluated on the cyclophosphamide (CPA)-treated mice. To induce immunosuppress, 150 and 110 mg/kg of CPA were intraperitoneally injected at 1 and 3 days before start of test material administrations, respectively. Exopolymers were subcutaneously or orally administered in a volume of 10 ml/kg, 4 times; 12-hr intervals from 24 hrs after second treatment of CPA. After treatment of exopolymers, the changes of <e>thymus</e> and spleen weights, splenic amounts of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-10, thymic and splenic CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and TNF-alpha+ cells were monitored in CPA-treated mice. As results of CPA treatment, dramatical decreases of the CD3+, CD4+, CD8+ and TNF-alpha+ cells were detected in thymus and spleen with decreases of thymus and spleen weights. In addition, decreases of splenic TNF-alpha, IL-1beta and IL-10 contents were also detected at flow cytometrical observations. However, oral and subcutaneous treatment of exopolymers effectively reduced the immunosuppressive changes induced by CPA. Therefore, it is concluded that exopolymers of A. pullulans can be effectively prevent the immunosuppress mediated, at least partially, recruitment of T cells and TNF-alpha+ cells or enhancement of their activity, and can provide effective prevention or treat regimes for the immunosuppress and related diseases such as cancer, sepsis and high-dose chemotherapy or radiotherapy.",M2
20208002,"Increased Foxp3+ regulatory T cells in poly(ADP-Ribose) polymerase-1 deficiency.Growing evidence is unveiling a role for poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP)-1 in the regulation of inflammatory/immune responses. In the current study, we investigated the effects of PARP-1 deficiency on regulatory T cell differentiation. Increased numbers of regulatory CD4(+)CD25(+)/Foxp3(+) T cells were found in <e>thymus</e>, spleen, and lymph nodes of PARP-1 knockout (KO) mice compared with wild-type (WT) controls. The increased frequency of regulatory T cells in the periphery resulted in impaired CD4 cell proliferation and IL-2 production, which could be restored by CD25(+) cell depletion. Phenotype and inhibitory functions of PARP-1 KO regulatory T cells were similar to WT cells, indicating that PARP-1 affects regulatory T cell differentiation rather than function. Purified naive CD4 cells from PARP-1 KO mice stimulated in vitro expressed forkhead box p3 mRNA at higher levels and generated a greater number of Foxp3(+) cells (inducible regulatory T [iTreg] cells) than the WT counterpart. This finding was due to a higher rate of naive CD4 cell to Foxp3(+) iTreg cell conversion rather than to higher resistance to apoptosis induction. Interestingly, PARP-1 deficiency did not affect retinoid-related orphan receptor-gammat mRNA expression and differentiation of purified naive CD4 cells to Th17 cells. PARP-1 KO iTreg cells showed features similar to WT regulatory T cells, suggesting that modulation of PARP-1 during the immune response might be used to induce greater numbers of functional regulatory T cells. In conclusion, our findings represent the first evidence that PARP-1 can affect regulatory T cell differentiation and open new perspectives on potential targets for modulating immune responses.",M2
20207844,"Rho GTPase Cdc42 is essential for human T-cell development.BACKGROUND: Rho GTPases are involved in the regulation of many cell functions, including some related to the actin cytoskeleton. Different Rho GTPases have been shown to be important for T-cell development in mice. However, their role in human T-cell development has not yet been explored. DESIGN AND METHODS: We examined the expression and activation of Rho GTPases along different stages of T-cell development in the human <e>thymus</e>. Early stage human thymocytes were transduced with constitutively active and dominant negative mutants of different Rho GTPases to explore their role in human T-cell development, as analyzed in fetal thymus organ cultures. The use of these mutants as well as Rho GTPase-specific inhibitors allowed us to explore the role of GTPases in thymocyte migration. RESULTS: We found that the expression of several Rho GTPases is differently regulated during successive stages of T-cell development in man, suggesting a specific role in human thymopoiesis. In chimeric fetal thymus organ culture, T-cell development was not or only mildly affected by expression of dominant negative Rac1 and Rac2, but was severely impaired in the presence of dominant negative Cdc42, associated with enhanced apoptosis and reduced proliferation. Kinetic analysis revealed that Cdc42 is necessary in human T-cell development both before and after expression of the pre-T-cell receptor. Using inhibitors and retrovirally transferred mutants of the aforementioned Rho GTPases, we showed that only Rac1 is necessary for migration of different thymocyte subsets, including the early CD34(+) fraction, towards stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha. Constitutively active mutants of Rac1, Rac2 and Cdc42 all impaired migration towards stromal cell-derived factor-1 alpha and T-cell development to different degrees. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first report on Rho GTPases in human T-cell development, showing the essential role of Cdc42. Our data suggest that enhanced apoptotic death and reduced proliferation rather than disturbed migration explains the decreased thymopoiesis induced by dominant negative Cdc42.",M2
20207296,"[Epithelial tumours of the <e>thymus</e>]Epithelial tumours of the thymus include thymomas, thymic carcinomas and neuro-endocrine tumours. Rare, they nevertheless represent 20% of all mediastinal tumours and 50% of those located in the anterior mediastinum. Thymomas, in particular, can be associated to auto-immune disorders, among which predominates myasthenia gravis. Their clinical behaviour varies widely, from a relative indolence to the potential of lymph node and/or systematic metastases. However, even patients with an invasive disease may have a long clinical history, explaining that a 10-year or 20-year survival from diagnosis does not imply a definitive cure. In daily practice, both the clinical Masaoka's staging system and the WHO histological classification condition the treatment strategies and allow to anticipate the prognosis. The initial treatment, as well as that of the recurrence, is based mainly on a complete resection. Postoperative radiotherapy is systematically added to the treatment of invasive tumours and/or to those with an aggressive histological subtype. Inoperable or metastatic tumours require a cisplatine and anthracyclin-based chemotherapy, followed by radical surgery and/or radiotherapy.",M2
20195490,"Mitochondria-targeted antioxidant SkQ1 inhibits age-dependent involution of the <e>thymus</e> in normal and senescence-prone rats.One of the most striking changes during mammal aging is a progressive involution of the thymus, associated with an increase in susceptibility to infections, autoimmune diseases and cancer. In order to delay age-related processes, we have developed mitochondria-targeted antioxidant plastoquinonyl decyltriphenyl phosphonium (SkQ1). Here we report that, at low doses, SkQ1 (250 nmol/kg per day) inhibited age-dependent involution of the thymus in normal (Wistar) and senescence-prone (OXYS) rats. SkQ1 preserved total weight and volume of the organ, the volume of thymic cortex and medulla, the thymic cellularity, and the number of CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+ cells in the thymus. Moreover, SkQ1 was especially effective in senescence-prone rats. Thus SkQ1 slows down age-linked decline of the immune system, explaining prevention by this compound of infection-caused death in rodents, previously described in our group.",M2
20188754,"Characterization of porcine CD205.Dendritic cells express a type cell-surface receptor, CD205 that plays a role in antigen capture and delivery to the endocytic pathway. Besides DCs, high CD205 expression is also detected on thymic epithelial cells but B cells, macrophages, and T cells have limited or no expression. CD205 has been characterized in several animal species except swine. The aim of this work was to characterize porcine CD205 and mRNA expression on different cells and tissues involved in immune responses. A complete porcine CD205 sequence of 5175bp was obtained from porcine <e>thymus</e> cDNA by PCR gene-walking strategy and this gene encoded a protein of 1723 amino acids. The multi-domain structure reported for murine, human, and bovine CD205 was also conserved in porcine with an overall amino acid identity of 74, 81, and 85%, respectively. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis of the CD205 mRNA profiles in normal porcine tissues and cells showed that thymus and Langerhans cells expressed the highest levels. Further characterization of porcine CD205 will lead to better understanding of the role of this receptor and development of contemporary strategies for antigen targeting to DCs in swine.",M2
20185886,"Extracranial metastasis of anaplastic oligodendroglioma with 1p19q loss of heterozygosity--case report.We report a rare case of anaplastic oligodendroglioma with extracranial metastasis, showing 1p19q co-deletion in both the brain tissue and the metastatic site. A 53-year-old man first presented with a left frontal tumor. The tumor was subtotally removed and irradiation was performed for the residual tumor and tumor bed. Two years after the initial treatment, several tumors appeared on his neck and one was resected. Histological examination revealed anaplastic oligodendroglioma, proved to be the same as the previous brain tumor. The patient refused further treatment, and died 30 months after the initial treatment. Autopsy demonstrated multiple extracranial metastases in the vertebrae, lymph nodes, spinal dura mater, <e>thymus</e> gland, and chest wall. We confirmed 1p19q loss of heterozygosity in both lesions, suggesting that 1p19q co-deletion might important to extracranial metastasis of oligodendroglioma.",M2
20181727,"A mutation in the 3'-UTR of the HDAC6 gene abolishing the post-transcriptional regulation mediated by hsa-miR-433 is linked to a new form of dominant X-linked chondrodysplasia.A family with dominant X-linked chondrodysplasia was previously described. The disease locus was ascribed to a 24 Mb interval in Xp11.3-q13.1. We have identified a variant (c.*281A&gt;T) in the 3' untranslated region (UTR) of the HDAC6 gene that totally segregates with the disease. The variant is located in the seed sequence of hsa-miR-433. Our data showed that, in MG63 osteosarcoma cells, hsa-miR-433 (miR433) down-regulated both the expression of endogenous HDAC6 and that of an enhanced green fluorescent protein-reporter mRNA bearing the wild-type 3'-UTR of HDAC6. This effect was totally abrogated when the reporter mRNA bore the mutated HDAC6 3'-UTR. The HDAC6 protein was found to be over-expressed in <e>thymus</e> from an affected male fetus. Concomitantly, the level of total alpha-tubulin, a target of HDAC6, was found to be increased in the affected fetal thymus, whereas the level of acetylated alpha-tubulin was found to be profoundly decreased. Skin biopsies were obtained from a female patient who presented a striking body asymmetry with hypotrophy of the left limbs. The mutated HDAC6 allele was expressed in 31% of left arm-derived fibroblasts, whereas it was not expressed in the right arm. Overexpression of HDAC6 was observed in left arm-derived fibroblasts. Altogether these results strongly suggest that this HDAC6 3'-UTR variant suppressed hsa-miR-433-mediated post-transcriptional regulation causing the overexpression of HDAC6. This variant is likely to constitute the molecular cause of this new form of X-linked chondrodysplasia. This represents to our knowledge the first example of a skeletal disease caused by the loss of a miRNA-mediated post-transcriptional regulation on its target mRNA.",M2
20178373,"Calf-<e>thymus</e> topoisomerase I equilibrates metastable secondary structure subsequent to relaxation of superhelical stress.After relaxation of superhelical stress by various methods not involving topoisomerases, a long-lived metastable secondary structure with an anomalously low torsion elastic constant commonly prevails. The aim here is to ascertain whether such metastable secondary structure also results from the action of calf-thymus topoisomerase I (CT Topo I) on a native supercoiled DNA and, if so, whether the enzyme catalyzes its subsequent equilibration. The action of CT Topo I on supercoiled p30delta DNA was examined over a range of times from 10 min to 6 h. We verify that the enzyme operates in an almost completely processive manner, and at each time point determine the twist energy parameter, E(T), that governs the supercoiling free energy. E(T) is initially low, 533 +/- 60, and remains essentially constant up to at least 360 min, when no further CT Topo I is added. The activity of the rather dilute enzyme dies within approximately 60 min. During the 60 min after a second addition of fresh enzyme at either 60 or 120 min, E(T) rises up to a plateau at approximately 1100, which lies within the consensus equilibrium range, 1000 +/- 100. Over that same time period, the average peak spacing between the gel bands (corresponding to individual topoisomers) decreases somewhat with increasing time of exposure to active CT Topo I. After a third addition of fresh CT Topo I at 240 min, there is no further change in either E(T) or the average gel spacing. These and other observations indicate that active CT Topo I catalyzes the equilibration of a metastable secondary structure with abnormally low torsion and bending elastic constants that prevails after the initial release of superhelical stress. An observed temporal lag of this structural equilibration behind the relaxation of native superhelical DNAs suggests that it may require cleavage and religation events at multiple sites on the DNA. A novel analysis of the unwinding kinetics using literature data accounts for the almost complete processivity of the enzyme. The action of CT Topo I was also examined in the presence of 20 and 40 w/v% ethylene glycol (EG), which shift a secondary structure equilibrium toward an alternative state with altered torsion and bending elastic constants. The present results suggest that the usual metastable state coexists with the EG-induced state, and is equilibrated more rapidly than in the absence of EG.",M2
20174557,"IFN-alpha-induced upregulation of CCR5 leads to expanded HIV tropism in vivo.Chronic immune activation and inflammation (e.g., as manifest by production of type I interferons) are major determinants of disease progression in primate lentivirus infections. To investigate the impact of such activation on intrathymic T-cell production, we studied infection of the human <e>thymus</e> implants of SCID-hu Thy/Liv mice with X4 and R5 HIV. X4 HIV was observed to infect CD3(-)CD4(+)CD8(-)CXCR4(+)CCR5(-) intrathymic T-cell progenitors (ITTP) and to abrogate thymopoiesis. R5 HIV, by contrast, first established a nonpathogenic infection of thymic macrophages and then, after many weeks, began to replicate in ITTP. We demonstrate here that the tropism of R5 HIV is expanded and pathogenicity enhanced by upregulation of CCR5 on these key T-cell progenitors. Such CCR5 induction was mediated by interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) in both thymic organ cultures and in SCID-hu mice, and antibody neutralization of IFN-alpha in R5 HIV-infected SCID-hu mice inhibited both CCR5 upregulation and infection of the T-cell progenitors. These observations suggest a mechanism by which IFN-alpha production may paradoxically expand the tropism of R5 HIV and, in so doing, accelerate disease progression.",M2
20173390,"T cells as sources and targets of TNF: implications for immunity and autoimmunity.TNF is a pleiotropic cytokine produced by many cell types upon different stimuli and in various physiological and pathological conditions.

20173030,"Thymic stromal lymphopoietin-activated plasmacytoid dendritic cells induce the generation of FOXP3+ regulatory T cells in human <e>thymus</e>.Human thymus contains major dendritic cell (DC) subsets, myeloid DCs (mDCs), and plasmacytoid DCs (pDCs). We previously showed that mDCs, educated by thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) produced by the epithelial cells of the Hassall's corpuscles, induced differentiation of CD4(+)CD25(-) thymocytes into Forkhead Box P3(+) (FOXP3(+)) regulatory T cells (T(R)) within the medulla of human thymus. In this study, we show that pDCs expressed the TSLP receptor and IL-7 receptor alpha complexes upon activation and became responsive to TSLP. TSLP-activated human pDCs secrete macrophage-derived chemokine CCL-22 and thymus- and activation-regulated chemokine CCL-17 but not Th1- or Th2-polarizing cytokines. TSLP-activated pDCs induced the generation of FOXP3(+) T(R) from CD4(+)CD8(-)CD25(-) thymocytes, which could be strongly inhibited by Th1-polarizing cytokine IL-12 or Th2-polarizing cytokine IL-4. Interestingly, the FOXP3(+) T(R) induced by the TSLP-pDCs expressed more IL-10 but less TGF-beta than that induced by the TSLP-mDCs. These data suggest that TSLP expressed by thymic epithelial cells can activate mDCs and pDCs to positively select the FOXP3(+) T(R) with different cytokine production potential in human thymus. The inability of TSLP to induce DC maturation without producing Th1- or Th2-polarizing cytokines may provide a thymic niche for T(R) development.",M2
20170963,"Novel leukocyte protein, Trojan, differentially expressed during thymocyte development. Trojan  is a novel cell surface protein, discovered from chicken embryonic thymocytes on the purpose to identify molecules involved in T cell differentiation. The molecule is predicted as a type I transmembrane protein having a Sushi and two fibronectin type III domains and a pair of intracellular phosphorylation sites. Its transcript expression is specific for lymphoid tissues and the presence of the protein on the surface of recirculating lymphocytes and macrophages was confirmed by immunofluorescence analysis. In <e>thymus</e>, about half of the double negative (CD4(-) CD8(-)) and CD8 single positive and the majority of CD4 single positive cells express Trojan with a relatively high intensity. However, only a minority of the double positive (CD4(+) CD8(+)) cells are positive for Trojan. This expression pattern, similar to that of some proteins with anti-apoptotic and function, like IL-7Ralpha, makes Trojan an attractive candidate of having an anti-apoptotic role.",M2
20162555,"c-Rel: a pioneer in directing regulatory T-cell lineage commitment?The transcription factor Foxp3 controls the differentiation and function of Treg, but the molecular mechanisms that regulate Foxp3 transcription remain elusive. In particular, signals and factors that open and remodel the Foxp3 locus and imprint developing Treg with a stable Foxp3 phenotype are largely unknown. Two reports in this issue of the European Journal of Immunology, together with recent reports published elsewhere, demonstrate that a member of the NF-kappaB family transcription factors, c-Rel, is required for thymic differentiation of Foxp3(+) Treg. Moreover, c-Rel is shown to regulate Foxp3 transcription directly by binding to cis-regulatory elements at the Foxp3 locus upon TCR/CD28 stimulation, including the promoter and the newly identified conserved non-coding DNA sequence harboring a  permissive  chromatin status in Treg precursors. These findings collectively suggest that c-Rel may act as a pioneer transcription factor in initiating Foxp3 transcription in Treg precursors in the <e>thymus</e>.",M2

Despite the reduction of thymic size, there is evidence to suggest that T cell output is still present into old age, albeit much diminished; leading to the assumption that thymocyte development is normal. However, current data suggests that recent thymic emigrant from the aged thymus are functionally less responsive, giving rise to the possibility that the generation of naïve T cell may be intrinsically impaired in the elderly. In light of these findings we discuss the evidence that suggest aged T cells may be flawed even before exiting to the periphery and could contribute to the age-associated decline in immune function.",M2

METHODS: Thirty nine MG patients who had not accepted immunosuppressive therapy before thymectomy were recruited as study group and 19 patients undergoing cardiosurgery as control. There was no significant statistical difference in age and gender between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). The location and proportion of Tregs in thymus were analyzed using indirect immunofluorescence double labeling immunohistochemistry and image analysis software. RESULTS: (1) Tregs were all located in medulla zone of thymus in control and MG groups. (2) Cells of germinal center had a high expression of CD25 and a low expression of CD4. It indicates that a majority of germinal center cells were B cells. (3) There were fewer Tregs around germinal center. (4) There was no statistical significant difference in absolute number of Tregs between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). But the proportion of Tregs was higher in control group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The proportion of thymus Tregs decreases in MG so as to weaken the function of immuno-regulation and suppression. This is probably a precipitating factor of MG.",M2
20137498,"Effects of cryptotanshinone on immune functions in rats with adjuvant arthritis.BACKGROUND: Cryptotanshinone (CT) was originally isolated from the dried roots of Salvia militorrhiza, an herb that is used extensively in Asian medicine and the extracts of this herb have been used in the treatment of several pathologies, including cardiovascular diseases, hematological abnormalities, hepatitis, and hyperlipidemia, but no studies had been carried on the treatment for rheumatic diseases with it. This study aimed to investigate the effects of cryptotanshinone on immune functions in rats with adjuvant arthritis (AA). METHODS: Complete Freund's adjuvant was used to induce AA in rats. <e>Thymus</e> and spleen was aseptically taken from normal rats and the AA rats. Then a thymus lymphoid cell suspension, splenic lymphoid cell suspension and peritoneal macrophage cell suspension were prepared. After adding CT (0.1 microg/ml, 1.0 microg/ml, 10 microg/ml, 100 microg/ml, 1000 microg/ml) into the suspension, T and B lymphocytes proliferation was determined by 3-(4,5-2 dimethylthiazal-2yl)2,5-diphenyltetrazoliumbromide (MTT) assay. And the activities of interleukin-1 (IL-1) and IL-2 were measured by the mouse lymphocytes proliferation assay. RESULTS: Thymic T and splenic B lymphocyte proliferation of the AA rat was significantly lower, and could be stored through using CT in vitro. CT (100 microg/ml and 1000 microg/ml) increased T or B lymphocytes proliferation in vitro (P &lt; 0.01). In AA rats, the levels of IL-1 released by abdominal PMPhi significantly increased whereas the level of IL-2 released by T cells decreased in vitro.

20134207,"The CXCL12/CXCR4 pair in aged human <e>thymus</e>.CXCL12 is an important CXC chemokine involved in numerous biological processes. We had previously demonstrated the synergistic participation of CXCL12 and IL-7 in the control of both survival and proliferation of CD34(+) human thymic lymphoid progenitors. On this basis, we hypothesize a presumptive role for CXCL12 and its receptor, CXCR4, in the thymus involution. In this respect, in the current report we describe the expression of both molecules in the human thymus during aging. Our results demonstrate that, despite the profound alterations observed in the thymic epithelial microenvironment of aged thymuses, the proportions of different CD4/CD8 thymocyte subsets do not undergo significant variations. Remarkably, a strong CXCL12 expression was found in older thymuses, which appeared in the same locations as in younger thymuses: the subcapsulary and medullary areas. The proportions of CXCR4(+) cells, most of them belonging to the CD3(-) compartment, showed no important variations in the older thymuses. However, within the CD34(+) cell population, a significant reduction in the expression of CXCR4 molecules was observed.",M2
20134187,"Intrathymic T cell migration is a multivectorial process under a complex neuroendocrine control.The <e>thymus</e> is responsible for normal T cell development, a process that includes cell proliferation, death, migration, and T cell receptor gene rearrangements. Moreover, it depends on interactions between developing thymocytes and thymic microenvironmental cells. Along with differentiation, thymocytes migrate and such oriented movement is regulated by several molecular interactions, comprising extracellular matrix (ECM) elements and chemokines. We postulated that intrathymic T cell migration is a multivectorial process; each individual vector being represented by a given molecular interaction. In vivo and in vitro experiments revealed that migration of developing thymocytes, including the export of mature T cells, is upregulated by hormones, such as growth hormone and triiodothyronine, through the modulation of ECM-mediated interactions, associated or not with the chemokine CXCL12. Recent data revealed that molecular interactions typically found in the nervous system also affect intrathymic T cell migration. Semaphorin-3A, a soluble member of the semaphorin family, is involved in the control of human thymocyte migration, bearing a chemorepulsive role. Such an effect is partially due to its downregulatory effect upon the interactions mediated by fibronectin and laminin, as well as CXCL12. These data unravel a complex neuroendocrine control intrathymic T cell migration, involving both endocrine and paracrine molecular interactions.",M2
20127695,"Proteomic identification of interactions between histones and plasma proteins: implications for cytoprotection.Extracellular histones released from cells during acute inflammation contribute to organ failure and death in a mouse model of sepsis, and histones are known to exert in vitro cytotoxicity in the absence of serum. Since addition of histones to serum and plasma is known to induce protein aggregation, we reasoned that plasma proteins may afford protection from cytotoxicity. We found that MODE-K mouse small intestinal epithelial cells were protected from histone-induced toxicity in the presence of 10% FCS. Therefore, the main aim of this study was to identify histone-interacting plasma proteins that might be involved in cytoprotection. The precipitate formed following addition of calf <e>thymus</e> histones to human EDTA plasma was characterised by shotgun proteomics, identifying a total of 36 protein subunits, including complement components, coagulation factors, protease inhibitors and apolipoproteins. The highly sulphated glycosaminoglycan heparin inhibited histone-induced plasma protein aggregation. Moreover, histones bound to heparin agarose were capable of pulling down plasma proteins from solution, indicating their effective cross-linking properties. It was particularly notable that inter-alpha-trypsin inhibitor was prominent among the histone-precipitated proteins, since it contains a chondroitin sulphate glycan chain, and suggests a potential role for this protein in histone sequestration during acute inflammation in vivo.",M2

Tbx1 mutations in mouse phenocopy the disorder. In order to identify the transcriptional dysregulation in Tbx1-expressing lineages we optimised fluorescent-activated cell sorting of beta-galactosidase expressing cells (FACS-Gal) to compare the expression profile of Df1/Tbx1(lacZ) (effectively Tbx1 null) and Tbx1 heterozygous cells isolated from mouse embryos. Hes1, a major effector of Notch signalling, was identified as downregulated in Tbx1(-)(/)(-) mutants. Hes1 mutant mice exhibited a partially penetrant range of 22q11DS-like defects including pharyngeal arch artery (PAA), outflow tract, craniofacial and thymic abnormalities.

Thymic DC play an essential role in shaping T cell-mediated immune responses by deleting self-reactive thymocytes to establish central tolerance and by inducing regulatory T-cell (Treg) development. It is therefore important to assess the prevalence of and alterations to thymic DC with age, as this may impact on their function. We assessed the numbers and proportions of the three distinct subsets of thymic DC in ageing mice, and showed that these subsets are differentially regulated. This is expected as thymic DC subsets have different origins of development. We further assessed the responses of thymic DC in a regenerative environment, such as that induced by sex-steroid ablation (SSA), and clearly showed that, consistent with global thymus regrowth, all three DC populations increased in numbers and regained their relative proportions to thymocytes after an initial lag period. These findings are important for the clinical translation of thymic regenerative approaches, and indicate that SSA facilitates the maintenance of critical processes such as negative selection and Treg induction through promoting thymic DC regeneration.",M2
20109747,"Defect of regulatory T cells in patients with Omenn syndrome.BACKGROUND: Omenn syndrome (OS) is an autosomal-recessive disorder characterized by severe immunodeficiency and T-cell-mediated autoimmunity. The disease is caused by hypomorphic mutations in recombination-activating genes that hamper the process of Variable (V) Diversity (D) Joining (J) recombination, leading to the generation of autoreactive T cells. We have previously shown that in OS the expression of autoimmune regulator, a key factor governing central tolerance, is markedly reduced. OBJECTIVE: Here, we have addressed the role of peripheral tolerance in the disease pathogenesis. METHODS: We have analyzed forkhead box protein P3 (FOXP3) expression in peripheral blood T cells of 4 patients with OS and in lymphoid organs of 8 patients with OS and have tested the suppressive activity of sorted CD4(+) CD25(high) peripheral blood T cells in 2 of these patients. RESULTS: We have observed that CD4(+)CD25(high)T cells isolated ex vivo from patients with OS failed to suppress proliferation of autologous or allogenic CD4(+) responder T cells. Moreover, despite individual variability in the fraction of circulating FOXP3(+) CD4 cells in patients with OS, the immunohistochemical analysis of FOXP3 expression in lymph nodes and <e>thymus</e> of patients with OS demonstrated a severe reduction of this cell subset compared with control tissues. CONCLUSION: Overall, these results suggest a defect of regulatory T cells in OS leading to a breakdown of peripheral tolerance, which may actively concur to the development of autoimmune manifestations in the disease.",M2
20107947,"Biological implications of thymectomy for myasthenia gravis.Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease mediated by autoantibodies to the striated muscle tissue. It is often treated by thymectomy. We review recent studies to investigate the biological implications of thymectomy. In anti-acetylcholine receptor antibody (anti-AchR Ab)-positive patients without a thymoma, abnormal germinal center formation in the <e>thymus</e> seems to play an essential role in the pathogenesis of MG. Specific differentiation of B cells producing anti-AchR Ab takes place uniquely in the thymus, and thymectomy is thought to assist in terminating the provision of high-affinity anti-AchR antibody-producing cells to peripheral organs. Thymectomy is not indicated for anti-AchR Ab-negative MG patients who are antimuscle specific kinase antibody (anti-MuSK Ab)-positive, although some anti-MuSK Ab-negative patients may benefit from the procedure. A thymoma can be considered as an acquired thymus with insufficient function of negative selection. The resection of a thymoma is thought to terminate the production of self-reactive T cells. Thus, the biological implications of thymectomy for MG have been partially revealed. Nevertheless, additional studies are needed to elucidate the ontogeny of T cells that recognize AchR and the mechanism of the activation of anti-AchR antibodies producing B cells.",M2
20106610,"The role of intestinal bifidobacteria on immune system development in young rats.AIM: The effects of intestinal bifidobacteria on the development of immunity in early life were explored. METHODS: Neonatal SD rats born and housed under strict barrier systems were fed from birth with sufficient antibiotics (bifidobacteria minimisation group) or supplemented daily with 1x10(10) colony-forming units of live Bifidobacterium longum (bifidobacteria supplementation group). Relevant indices of immune development were determined at one, three and six weeks old. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, minimisation of the intestinal bifidobacteria delayed maturation of dendritic cells in Peyer's Patches and the development of T cells in the <e>thymus</e>, increased IL-4 secretion in the plasma, down-regulated IL-12, IL-10 mRNA and the interferon-gamma/IL-4 mRNA ratio in intestinal mucosa, decreased interferon-gamma mRNA in cultured peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs), and reduced immunoglobulin-M production in cultured PBMCs. Conversely, supplementation with bifidobacteria promoted dendritic cell maturation in Peyer's Patches, up-regulated IL-12, IL-10, interferon-gamma mRNA and the interferon-gamma/IL-4 ratio in intestinal mucosa, increased interferon-gamma gene expression in cultured PBMCs, and raised immunoglobulin-M secretion in cultured PBMCs. CONCLUSIONS: Intestinal bifidobacteria could promote the maturation of dendritic cells and its expression of IL-12 locally in the gut, influence the development of T cells in the thymus, favour the development of T-helper cell type 1 response by increasing the local and systemic expression of interferon-gamma and ensure the intestinal regulatory T cell response by promoting the local expression of IL-10. In addition, they enhance antibody synthesis by PBMCs, thereby affecting the development of both the gut and systemic immunity in early life.",M2
20104489,"Ectopic GC in the <e>thymus</e> of myasthenia gravis patients show characteristics of normal GC.Young patients with myasthenia gravis (MG) frequently have ectopic GC in their thymus. We investigated these ectopic GC by microdissection of GC B cells and analysis of their Ig gene characteristics, in comparison to normal GC. CDR3 length distribution, a measure of clonal variability, and Ig gene family usage were similar in MG and normal tonsil samples. Lineage tree analysis demonstrated similar diversification and mutations per cell compared with normal control trees. Mutations were observed in the framework regions, responsible for the structural integrity of the BCR; however, these mutations were mostly conservative or neutral, confirming that a functional BCR is conserved in MG. In the CDR, responsible for Ag binding, selection against replacement mutations was revealed. This may indicate that the MG clones analyzed are already highly Ag-specific, and therefore potential affinity-reducing replacement mutations in the CDR3 are not propagated, due to Ag-driven selection. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) targeting motifs and aa substitution preferences in MG were similar to those of normal controls. Overall, these results suggest that B cells in the ectopic GC in MG appear to undergo normal diversification and selection, in spite of the chronic nature and different environment of the response.",M2
20100762,"An adolescent with a mediastinal mass, diagnosed with Graves disease and thymic hyperplasia.Graves disease is an autoimmune disorder characterized by thyroid enlargement and hyperthyroidism. Thyrotropin receptor (TSHR) autoantibodies bind the TSHR on the membrane of thyroid follicular cells and stimulate cell proliferation and thyroid-hormone synthesis. TSHR has also been identified in extrathyroidal organs, including the human <e>thymus</e>. Thus far, radiologically detectable thymic enlargement has only been reported in adults with Graves disease. We present here the case of a child with Graves disease and significant thymic hyperplasia. L. K. was a 15-year-old girl evaluated for cough and dyspnea on exertion. A chest radiograph was obtained, and it revealed a widened superior mediastinum. A computed-tomography scan of her chest identified a mass in the anterior mediastinum without associated lymphadenopathy. Because of these radiologic findings and her weight loss, she was referred to the oncology service; a biopsy of the mediastinal mass was obtained and revealed thymic reactive hyperplasia. Because of persistent tachycardia, thyroid studies were obtained, and the diagnosis of Graves disease was established. The child's physical examination revealed a minimally enlarged thyroid gland and no exophthalmos. One month after medical treatment was initiated, a repeat computed-tomography scan of her chest identified significantly reduced thymic size. To our knowledge, this is the first pediatric patient reported with Graves disease and significant thymic enlargement. Considering the diagnosis of Graves disease for a child with an anterior mediastinal mass and without the typical physical findings of autoimmune hyperthyroidism (goiter, exophthalmos) may prevent unnecessary diagnostic studies and their associated financial and emotional costs.",M2
20100608,"Studies on the chemical structure and antitumor activity of an exopolysaccharide from Rhizobium sp. N613.The molecular structure of the rhizobium exopolysaccharide (REPS) was analyzed by enzymolysis, periodate oxidation, and Smith degradation, and by IR and NMR spectroscopy. The results indicated that REPS was a beta-glucan with a backbone of beta-D-(1--&gt;4)-linked glucose residues and branches of beta-D-(1--&gt;6)-linked glucose residues. The branch was attached to the main chain at the 6-O-position. The molar ratio of 1--&gt;4 and 1--&gt;6 was 2:1. The terminal C3 of the (1--&gt;6)-Glc branch had an O-acetyl group. The molecular weight was estimated to be 35 kDa by Sephadex G-100 column chromatography. The antitumor activity of REPS was evaluated in mice bearing sarcoma 180, hepatoma 22, and Ehrlich ascites carcinoma tumor, respectively. At doses of 10-60 mg/kg, it was observed that tumor formation decreased significantly (P &lt;0.01), but the relative spleen and <e>thymus</e> weight, the phagocytic function of monocytes, lymphocyte proliferation, and serum hemolysis antibody increased significantly (P &lt;0.05). Results of these studies demonstrated that the REPS polysaccharide possessed antitumor activity.",M2
20100091,"Limited evolution of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 in the <e>thymus</e> of a perinatally infected child.BACKGROUND: Involvement of the thymus during human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection may impair production of naive lymphocytes leading to more rapid depletion, but the characteristics of primary strains in the thymus are not well studied because of the unavailability of tissue in living individuals. METHODS: We studied the characteristics of HIV type 1 (HIV-1) in a 5-year old perinatally infected child with thymitis and compared the genomic sequences of the HIV-1 C2-V5 region of the env gene in the thymic tissue and peripheral blood. RESULTS: The thymus harbored predominantly viral sequences close to the founder HIV-1 variant that circulated in the blood at 2 and 3 months of age, whereas the peripheral blood virus at 5 years of age had evolved extensively. Viral sequences from circulating CD8(+) T cells at 5 years of age phylogenetically clustered with those from the thymic tissue. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the existence of a distinct thymic viral reservoir and suggest that circulating CD8(+) T cells were infected in the thymus, presumably at the CD4(+)CD8(+) thymocyte stage. They also demonstrate that not all thymic HIV infections will necessarily lead to severe thymic dysfunction. The characteristics of the virus strain seeding the thymus may dictate the rate of disease progression.",M2
20093438,"The Lmo2 oncogene initiates leukemia in mice by inducing thymocyte self-renewal.The LMO2 oncogene causes a subset of human T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemias (T-ALL), including four cases that arose as adverse events in gene therapy trials. To investigate the cellular origin of LMO2-induced leukemia, we used cell fate mapping to study mice in which the Lmo2 gene was constitutively expressed in the <e>thymus</e>. Lmo2 induced self-renewal of committed T cells in the mice more than 8 months before the development of overt T-ALL. These self-renewing cells retained the capacity for T cell differentiation but expressed several genes typical of hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), suggesting that Lmo2 might reactivate an HSC-specific transcriptional program. Forced expression of one such gene, Hhex, was sufficient to initiate self-renewal of thymocytes in vivo. Thus, Lmo2 promotes the self-renewal of preleukemic thymocytes, providing a mechanism by which committed T cells can then accumulate additional genetic mutations required for leukemic transformation.",M2
20093198,"Immunopotentiation and anti-tumor activity of carboxymethylated-sulfated beta-(1--&gt;3)-d-glucan from Poria cocos.A carboxymethylated-sulfated derivative of (1--&gt;3)-beta-d-glucan (PCS3-II) extracted from Poria cocos was synthesized and coded as CS-PCS3-II. Results of infrared (IR) and Carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((13)C NMR) indicated that CS-PCS3-II contained carboxymethyl and sulfate groups with a degree of substitution (DS) of 1.05 and 0.36 respectively. By using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with laser light scatting (LLS), the dependence of radius of gyration (&lt;S(2)&gt;(z)(1/2)) on the molecular weight (M(w)) for CS-PCS3-II was established as [Formula: see text] in 0.15M NaCl solution at 25 degrees C, suggesting that CS-PCS3-II existed as an extended flexible chain. CS-PCS3-II exhibited significantly higher inhibition ratio to Sarcoma 180 tumor in BALB/c mice than PCS3-II. Histological examination of tumor cells treated with CS-PCS3-II had signs of necrosis and apoptosis. It is postulated that introduction of the carboxymethyl and sulfate groups to PCS3-II increased its possible contact with the receptors of immune cells through hydrogen binding and electrostatic attraction, leading to a stronger immunological responses that resulted in inhibition of tumor cell proliferation. Moreover, there were significant increases in phagocyte and <e>thymus</e> indexes, spleen index, hemolytic activity as well as spleen antibody production and delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), suggesting that CS-PCS3-II could significantly enhance immunpotentiation in mice.",M2
20090249,"Primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of <e>thymus</e>: a rare cause of Cushing's syndrome.Thymomas constitute majority of the thymic neoplasms. In contrast, neuroendocrine tumors (carcinoid and neuroendocrine carcinoma) of thymus are extremely rare. Thymic carcinoids may present rarely with Cushing's syndrome due to the ectopic production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Recognition of this association is imperative for appropriate management of patients. We describe three cases of rare atypical carcinoid tumor (neuroendocrine carcinoma) of the thymus. Case 1, of a 26-year-old man presenting with Cushing's syndrome, case 2--a 23-year-old female with Cushingoid features, and Case 3--a 39-year-old man complaining of progressively worsening dyspnea. Computed tomography (CT) scans of chest in all three patients revealed anterior mediastinal mass. Excision of tumors and histological examination of the three tumors showed a carcinoid tumor with nuclear pleomorphism, increased mitotic activity and focal necrosis. The features suggested a diagnosis of atypical carcinoid tumor in all the three cases. The tumor cells in Cases 1 and 2 showed focal immunohistochemical staining for ACTH. Atypical carcinoid (neuroendocrine carcinoma, well-differentiated and moderately-differentiated) of the thymus is a rare thymic tumor which carries a worse prognosis compared to thymoma and requires aggressive therapy. Hence, an accurate diagnosis is essential.",M2
20087160,"Diffuse thymic fibrosis: histologic pattern of injury or distinct entity?Thymic fibrosis in the absence of another primary thymic lesion, such as a neoplasm or cyst, is unusual. We identified 6 cases of primary extensive thymic fibrosis that developed in 3 men and 3 women, aged 28 to 60 years, mean 48 years. Patients had limited or no symptoms. Two patients had dyspnea and 1 had cough and hemoptysis. One female patient had myasthenia gravis. The lesions measured 3.5 to 17 cm in greatest dimension, mean 8 cm, and were confined to the anterior mediastinum as determined by imaging, intraoperative notes, and/or gross examination. All cases showed diffuse fibrosis with variable collagen deposition, lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates, and involution/atrophy of <e>thymus</e>. One case had rare IgG4-positive plasma cells and focal obliterative phlebitis. The histology showed overlap with that of IgG4-related sclerosing disease, which to our knowledge has not been documented earlier in this location.

Microscopically, the mass was composed of numerous varying-sized cysts lined with simple squamous epithelial cells to columnar ciliated cells. Also present within this mass was a large aggregate of loosely arranged fusiform-shaped cells. These cells also were found in smaller numbers in the connective tissue surrounding the cysts. The larger aggregate of fusiform cells was positive for desmin and S-100 and negative for smooth muscle actin. Electron microscopy revealed well-formed Z lines and I bands of skeletal muscle phenotype. A diagnosis of rhabdomyoma within a congenital multilocular thymic cyst was made. The <e>thymus</e> contains a small population of myoid cells, which should be taken in consideration when evaluating thymic tumors.",M2
20080304,"Regulation of IL-17 expression by the developmental pathway of CD4 T cells in the <e>thymus</e>.CD4 T cells selected by MHC class II expressing thymocytes (T-CD4 T cells) have distinct effector functions compared to that of epithelial cell-selected CD4 T cells (E-CD4 T cells). T-CD4 T cells produce both Th1 and Th2 effector cytokines immediately after stimulation and also express IL-4 in addition to IFN-gamma under the Th1 differentiation condition. In the present study, we investigated the capability of T-CD4 T cells to become IL-17-producing cells. We found that T-CD4 T cells express reduced IL-17 under Th17-inducing conditions. T-CD4 T cells express very low levels of receptor for TGF-beta and IL-21 that are essential to induce IL-17 expression. In addition, the induction of RORgammat, a key transcription factor for IL-17 gene expression, was compromised in T-CD4 T cells under Th17 skewing conditions and ectopic expression of RORgammat restored IL-17 expression. The defect of IL-17 and RORgammat expression in T-CD4 T cells is cell intrinsic and not due to effects of a secreted factor. Thus, the developmental pathway of CD4 T cells in the thymus plays a critical role in controlling an immune response by suppressing the generation of the Th17 lineage.",M2
20078861,"Modulatory effects of cAMP and PKC activation on gap junctional intercellular communication among thymic epithelial cells.BACKGROUND: We investigated the effects of the signaling molecules, cyclic AMP (cAMP) and protein-kinase C (PKC), on gap junctional intercellular communication (GJIC) between thymic epithelial cells (TEC). RESULTS: Treatment with 8-Br-cAMP, a cAMP analog; or forskolin, which stimulates cAMP production, resulted in an increase in dye transfer between adjacent TEC, inducing a three-fold enhancement in the mean fluorescence of coupled cells, ascertained by flow cytometry after calcein transfer. These treatments also increased Cx43 mRNA expression, and stimulated Cx43 protein accumulation in regions of intercellular contacts. VIP, adenosine, and epinephrine which may also signal through cyclic nucleotides were tested. The first two molecules did not mimic the effects of 8-Br-cAMP, however epinephrine was able to increase GJIC suggesting that this molecule functions as an endogenous inter-TEC GJIC modulators. Stimulation of PKC by phorbol-myristate-acetate inhibited inter-TEC GJIC. Importantly, both the enhancing and the decreasing effects, respectively induced by cAMP and PKC, were observed in both mouse and human TEC preparations. Lastly, experiments using mouse thymocyte/TEC heterocellular co-cultures suggested that the presence of thymocytes does not affect the degree of inter-TEC GJIC. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, our data indicate that cAMP and PKC intracellular pathways are involved in the homeostatic control of the gap junction-mediated communication in the thymic epithelium, exerting respectively a positive and negative role upon cell coupling. This control is phylogenetically conserved in the <e>thymus</e>, since it was seen in both mouse and human TEC preparations. Lastly, our work provides new clues for a better understanding of how the thymic epithelial network can work as a physiological syncytium.",M2
20072126,"Role of conserved non-coding DNA elements in the Foxp3 gene in regulatory T-cell fate.Immune homeostasis is dependent on tight control over the size of a population of regulatory T (T(reg)) cells capable of suppressing over-exuberant immune responses. The T(reg) cell subset is comprised of cells that commit to the T(reg) lineage by upregulating the transcription factor Foxp3 either in the <e>thymus</e> (tT(reg)) or in the periphery (iT(reg)). Considering a central role for Foxp3 in T(reg) cell differentiation and function, we proposed that conserved non-coding DNA sequence (CNS) elements at the Foxp3 locus encode information defining the size, composition and stability of the T(reg) cell population. Here we describe the function of three Foxp3 CNS elements (CNS1-3) in T(reg) cell fate determination in mice. The pioneer element CNS3, which acts to potently increase the frequency of T(reg) cells generated in the thymus and the periphery, binds c-Rel in in vitro assays. In contrast, CNS1, which contains a TGF-beta-NFAT response element, is superfluous for tT(reg) cell differentiation, but has a prominent role in iT(reg) cell generation in gut-associated lymphoid tissues. CNS2, although dispensable for Foxp3 induction, is required for Foxp3 expression in the progeny of dividing T(reg) cells. Foxp3 binds to CNS2 in a Cbf-beta-Runx1 and CpG DNA demethylation-dependent manner, suggesting that Foxp3 recruitment to this 'cellular memory module' facilitates the heritable maintenance of the active state of the Foxp3 locus and, therefore, T(reg) lineage stability. Together, our studies demonstrate that the composition, size and maintenance of the T(reg) cell population are controlled by Foxp3 CNS elements engaged in response to distinct cell-extrinsic or -intrinsic cues.",M2

20065992,"CD31 (PECAM-1) is a marker of recent thymic emigrants among CD4+ T-cells, but not CD8+ T-cells or gammadelta T-cells, in HIV patients responding to ART.Some severely immunodeficient HIV patients experience poor recovery of CD4(+) T-cell counts on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Evaluation of the function of thymopoiesis in T-cell production in individual patients requires a simple marker of T-cells that have recently emigrated from the <e>thymus</e>. Here, we address whether expression of CD31 on CD4(+) T-cells, CD8(+) T-cells, regulatory T-cells and gammadelta T-cells correlates with other indicators of thymus function. Adult HIV-1 patients (n=27) with nadir CD4(+) T-cell counts &lt;100 per mul and a sustained virological response to ART and healthy controls (n=23) were studied. CD31 expression was assessed by flow cytometry, T-cell receptor excision circles content by real-time PCR and thymic volume by spiral computed tomography. Proportions of CD4(+) T-cells expressing CD45RA and CD31 declined with age in HIV patients (P=0.03) and healthy controls (P&lt;0.0001), and correlated directly with other markers of thymus function. In controls, proportions of CD8(+) T-cells expressing CD45RA and CD31 declined with age (P=0.003) and correlated directly with some markers of thymus function, but this was not seen in HIV patients. Proportions of CD45RA(+) CD31(+) gammadelta T-cells were higher in patients than controls (P=0.007) and did not correlate with thymus volume. In controls, proportion of gammadelta T-cells co-expressing CD45RA and CD31 increased with age (P=0.002). These data support the use of CD31 as a marker of recent thymic origin in CD4(+) T-cells, but not CD8(+) T-cells in HIV patients receiving ART. In such patients, CD31 expression is unlikely to indicate thymic origin in gammadelta T-cells.",M2
20064453,"Spatial mapping of thymic stromal microenvironments reveals unique features influencing T lymphoid differentiation.Interaction of hematopoietic progenitors with the thymic microenvironment induces them to proliferate, adopt the T lineage fate, and asymmetrically diverge into multiple functional lineages. Progenitors at various developmental stages are stratified within the <e>thymus</e>, implying that the corresponding microenvironments provide distinct sets of signals to progenitors migrating between them. These differences remain largely undefined. Here we used physical and computational approaches to generate a comprehensive spatial map of stromal gene expression in the thymus. Although most stromal regions were characterized by a unique gene expression signature, the central cortex lacked distinctive features. Instead, a key function of this region appears to be the sequestration of unique microenvironments found at the cortical extremities, thus modulating the relative proximity of progenitors moving between them. Our findings compel reexamination of how cell migration, lineage specification, and proliferation are controlled by thymic architecture and provide an in-depth resource for global characterization of this control.",M2
20064449,"Nuclear factor-kappaB modulates regulatory T cell development by directly regulating expression of Foxp3 transcription factor.Naturally derived regulatory T (Treg) cells are characterized by stable expression of the transcription factor Foxp3 and characteristic epigenetic imprinting at the Foxp3 gene locus.

Enhancing the signal strength of the NF-kappaB pathway also induced Foxp3 expression in otherwise conventionally selected T cells. NF-kappaB directly promoted the transcription of Foxp3, and upon T cell receptor (TCR) stimulation, c-Rel, a NF-kappaB family member, bound to Foxp3 enhancer region, which is specifically demethylated in natural Treg cells. Hence, NF-kappaB signaling pathway is a key regulator of Foxp3 expression during natural Treg cell development.",M2
20061408,"Cutting edge: spontaneous development of IL-17-producing gamma delta T cells in the <e>thymus</e> occurs via a TGF-beta 1-dependent mechanism.In naive animals, gammadelta T cells are innate sources of IL-17, a potent proinflammatory cytokine mediating bacterial clearance as well as autoimmunity. However, mechanisms underlying the generation of these cells in vivo remain unclear. In this study, we show that TGF-beta1 plays a key role in the generation of IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells and that it mainly occurs in the thymus particularly during the postnatal period. Interestingly, IL-17(+) gammadelta TCR(+) thymocytes were mainly CD44(high)CD25(low) cells, which seem to derive from double-negative 4 gammadelta TCR(+) cells that acquired CD44 and IL-17 expression. Our findings identify a novel developmental pathway during which IL-17-competent gammadelta T cells arise in the thymus by a TGF-beta1-dependent mechanism.",M2

The rats were receiving it orally at a dose of 0.1 mg kg-1 bw a day for either 60 or 90 days. At the end of the experiment, the thymus was examined for histopathology by light microscopy and for epidermal growth factor (EGF) and its receptor (EGFR) by immunolocalisation. For morphometry we used the Bs200prop program to analyse images obtained with the Olympus BX51 light microscope. Cell ultrastructure was studied by electron microscopy. In rats treated with patulin, the thymus showed haemorrhage, plasma cell hyperplasia, a dilation and fibrosis in the cortex, enlarged interstitial tissue between the thymic lobules, enlarged fat tissue, thinning of the cortex, and blurring of the cortico-medullary demarcation. Electron microscopy showed signs of cell destruction, abnormalities of the nucleus and organelles, and loss of mitochondrial cristae.

20056622,"Breast cancer risk 55+ years after irradiation for an enlarged <e>thymus</e> and its implications for early childhood medical irradiation today.BACKGROUND: Radiotherapy during childhood increases long-term cancer risk, but the risk from radiation as a result of relatively higher dose diagnostic procedures remains less well known. This study, which evaluates breast cancer incidence in a cohort treated with  lower dose  chest radiotherapy over 50 years ago, can assist with estimating lifetime breast cancer risk in young children exposed to radiation from procedures such as chest computed tomography (CT) or treatment with recent  lower dose  chest radiotherapy protocols. METHODS: A population-based, longitudinal cohort of subjects exposed to thymic irradiation during infancy from 1926 to 1957 and of their unexposed siblings was re-established. Previously followed until 1987, we resurveyed cohort members from 2004 to 2008. Poisson regression models compared breast cancer incidence rates between women in the cohort by treatment and dose category groups. RESULTS: Breast cancer occurred in 96 treated (mean breast dose, 0.71 Gy) and 57 untreated women during 159,459 person-years of follow-up. After adjusting for attained age and treatment/birth cohort, the rate ratio was 3.01 (2.18-4.21). The adjusted excess relative risk per Gy was 1.10 (95% confidence interval, 0.61-1.86). Traditional breast cancer risk factors did not contribute significantly to multivariate model fit. CONCLUSION: Our results show that at radiation doses between those received by the breast from chest CT and cancer therapy during early childhood, breast cancer incidence rates remain elevated &gt;50 years after exposure. This implies that increased breast cancer risk will remain a lifelong concern in females treated during childhood with currently reduced radiotherapy doses and for infants receiving multiple chest CTs.",M2
20048123,"CD155 is involved in negative selection and is required to retain terminally maturing CD8 T cells in <e>thymus</e>.During their final maturation in the medulla, semimature single-positive (SP) thymocytes downregulate activation markers and subsequently exit into the periphery. Although semimature CD4(+) SP cells are sensitive to negative selection, the timing of when negative selection occurs in the CD8 lineage remains elusive. We show that the abundance of terminally matured CD8(+) SP cells in adult thymus is modulated by the genetic background. Moreover, in BALB/c mice, the frequency of terminally matured CD8(+) SP cells, but not that of CD4(+) SP cells present in thymus, varies depending on age. In mice lacking expression of the adhesion receptor CD155, a selective deficiency of mature CD8(+) SP thymocytes was observed, emerging first in adolescent animals at the age when these cells start to accumulate in wild-type thymus. Evidence is provided that the mature cells emigrate prematurely when CD155 is absent, cutting short their retention time in the medulla. Moreover, in nonmanipulated wild-type mice, semimature CD8(+) SP thymocytes are subjected to negative selection, as reflected by the diverging TCR repertoires present on semimature and mature CD8(+) T cells. In CD155-deficient animals, a shift was found in the TCR repertoire displayed by the pool of CD8(+) SP cells, demonstrating that CD155 is involved in negative selection.",M2
20046229,"Fat-storing multilocular cells expressing CCR5 increase in the <e>thymus</e> with advancing age: potential role for CCR5 ligands on the differentiation and migration of preadipocytes.Age-associated thymic involution is characterized by decreased thymopoiesis, adipocyte deposition and changes in the expression of various thymic microenvironmental factors. In this work, we characterized the distribution of fat-storing cells within the aging thymus. We found an increase of unilocular adipocytes, ERTR7(+) and CCR5(+ )fat-storing multilocular cells in the thymic septa and parenchymal regions, thus suggesting that mesenchymal cells could be immigrating and differentiating in the aging thymus. We verified that the expression of CCR5 and its ligands, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5, were increased in the thymus with age. Hypothesizing that the increased expression of chemokines and the CCR5 receptor may play a role in adipocyte recruitment and/or differentiation within the aging thymus, we examined the potential role for CCR5 signaling on adipocyte physiology using 3T3-L1 pre-adipocyte cell line. Increased expression of the adipocyte differentiation markers, PPARgamma2 and aP2 in 3T3-L1 cells was observed under treatment with CCR5 ligands. Moreover, 3T3-L1 cells demonstrated an ability to migrate in vitro in response to CCR5 ligands. We believe that the increased presence of fat-storing cells expressing CCR5 within the aging thymus strongly suggests that these cells may be an active component of the thymic stromal cell compartment in the physiology of thymic aging. Moreover, we found that adipocyte differentiation appear to be influenced by the proinflammatory chemokines, CCL3, CCL4 and CCL5.",M2
20045443,"Auto-reconstitution of the T-cell compartment by radioresistant hematopoietic cells following lethal irradiation and bone marrow transplantation.OBJECTIVE: In lethally irradiated bone marrow chimeras, part of the reconstituted T-cell compartment is derived from the irradiated host, but the detailed origin and functional activity of host-derived T cells has not been thoroughly analyzed. Herein, we determine the origin and function of radioresistant host-derived T cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Lethally irradiated thymectomized or nonthymectomized C57BL/6 host mice were reconstituted with syngeneic bone marrow, itself incapable of generating T cells. Using fetal thymic organ cultures, bulk and limiting dilution assays on OP9-DL1 stromal cells, unambiguous cohorts of <e>thymus</e>-derived and peripheral T-cell-derived T cells were phenotypically characterized by flow cytometry and functionally characterized by their ability to participate in a T-cell-dependent antibody response. RESULTS: Both thymus-derived and peripheral T-cell-derived host T cells are functional and can reconstitute 35% of the normal T-cell pool. By comparing thymectomized vs nonthymectomized hosts, host-derived T cells were shown to comprise a major (70%) subpopulation of de novo generated, thymus-derived, polyclonal, naïve cells, and a minor subpopulation of surviving, peripheral, oligoclonal, memory-like cells. Unlike euthymic recipients, mice whose T cells were derived from surviving peripheral T cells were frequently incapable of mounting a T-cell-dependent antibody response. Host-derived thymocytes regenerated in an interleukin-7-dependent fashion from conventional DN2 thymocytes and their differentiation recapitulated normal thymic ontogeny. CONCLUSION: We characterized, for the first time, functional radioresistant DN2-phenotype thymic T-cell precursors, the T-cell progeny of which might provide a first line of defense against infections during the lymphopenic phase post-bone marrow transplantation.",M2
20045355,"Thymoproteasome shapes immunocompetent repertoire of CD8+ T cells.How self-peptides displayed in the <e>thymus</e> contribute to the development of immunocompetent and self-protective T cells is largely unknown. In contrast, the role of thymic self-peptides in eliminating self-reactive T cells and thereby preventing autoimmunity is well established. A type of proteasome, termed thymoproteasome, is specifically expressed by thymic cortical epithelial cells (cTECs) and is required for the generation of optimal cellularity of CD8+ T cells. Here, we show that cTECs displayed thymoproteasome-specific peptide-MHC class I complexes essential for the positive selection of major and diverse repertoire of MHC class I-restricted T cells. CD8+ T cells generated in the absence of thymoproteasomes displayed a markedly altered T cell receptor repertoire that was defective in both allogeneic and antiviral responses. These results demonstrate that thymoproteasome-dependent self-peptide production is required for the development of an immunocompetent repertoire of CD8+ T cells.",M2
20043899,"Evidence for an early role for BMP4 signaling in <e>thymus</e> and parathyroid morphogenesis.The thymus and parathyroids are pharyngeal endoderm-derived organs that develop from common organ primordia, which undergo a series of morphological events resulting in separate organs in distinct locations in the embryo. Previous gene expression and functional analyses have suggested a role for BMP4 signaling in early thymus organogenesis. We have used conditional deletion of Bmp4 or Alk3 from the pharyngeal endoderm and/or the surrounding mesenchyme using Foxg1-Cre, Wnt1-Cre or Foxn1-Cre. Deleting Bmp4 from both neural crest cells (NCC) and early endoderm-derived epithelial cells in Foxg1-Cre;Bmp4 conditional mutants resulted in defects in thymus-parathyroid morphogenesis. Defects included reduced condensation of mesenchymal cells around the epithelium, partial absence of the thymic capsule, a delay in thymus and parathyroid separation, and failed or dramatically reduced organ migration. Patterning of the primordia and initial organ differentiation were not affected in any of the mutants. Deleting Bmp4 from NCC-derived mesenchyme or differentiating thymic epithelial cells (TECs) had no effects on thymus-parathyroid development, while loss of Alk3 from either neural crest cells or TECs resulted in only a mild thymic hypoplasia. these results show that the processes of cell specification and morphogenesis during thymus-parathyroid development are independently controlled, and suggest a specific temporal and spatial role for BMP4-mediated epithelial-mesenchymal interactions during early thymus and parathyroid morphogenesis.",M2
20040762,"Intrathymic transplantation of bone marrow-derived progenitors provides long-term thymopoiesis.The sustained differentiation of T cells in the <e>thymus</e> cannot be maintained by resident intrathymic (IT) precursors and requires that progenitors be replenished from the bone marrow (BM). In patients with severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) treated by hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, late T-cell differentiation defects are thought to be due to an insufficient entry of donor BM progenitors into the thymus. Indeed, we find that the intravenous injection of BM progenitors into nonconditioned zeta-chain-associated protein kinase 70 (ZAP-70)-deficient mice with SCID supports short- but not long-term thymopoiesis. Remarkably, we now show that the IT administration of these progenitors produces a significant level of donor-derived thymopoiesis for more than 6 months after transplantation. In contrast to physiologic thymopoiesis, long-term donor thymopoiesis was not due to the continued recruitment of progenitors from the BM. Rather, IT transplantation resulted in the unique generation of a large population of early c-Kit(high) donor precursors within the thymus. These ZAP-70-deficient mice that received an IT transplant had a significantly increased prothymocyte niche compared with their untreated counterparts; this phenotype was associated with the generation of a medulla. Thus, IT administration of BM progenitors results in the filling of an expanded precursor niche and may represent a strategy for enhancing T-cell differentiation in patients with SCID.",M2
20040757,"CC chemokine receptor 7 and 9 double-deficient hematopoietic progenitors are severely impaired in seeding the adult <e>thymus</e>.T-cell development depends on recruitment of bone marrow-derived precursor cells to the thymus via a multistep adhesion cascade involving the chemokine receptor CCR9. However, CCR9 deficiency does not result in complete abrogation of progenitor entry into the adult thymus. Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that additional chemokine/chemokine receptor systems might play a role in this process. To this end, we generated mice deficient in both CCR9 and CCR7. Deficiency in both chemokine receptors resulted in severely reduced numbers of early T-cell progenitors and in near-complete abrogation of thymus reconstitution. Progenitors in bone marrow and peripheral blood remained largely unaffected in CCR7(-/-)CCR9(-/-) mice, and direct intrathymic transfer of precursors from CCR7(-/-)CCR9(-/-) mice as well as single-mutant mice showed that intrathymic differentiation of these precursors remained functional. Thus, our data reveal a previously unrecognized role of CCR7 in progenitor seeding of the adult thymus, which is largely masked by compensatory effects of CCR9 signals. In turn, CCR7 signals can partially compensate for CCR9 signals, thus explaining the rather mild phenotype of CCR9(-/-) mice with respect to progenitor seeding.",M2
20038597,"Thymic development beyond beta-selection requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase activation by CXCR4.T cell development requires phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) signaling with contributions from both the class IA, p110delta, and class IB, p110gamma catalytic subunits. However, the receptors on immature T cells by which each of these PI3Ks are activated have not been identified, nor has the mechanism behind their functional redundancy in the <e>thymus</e>. Here, we show that PI3K signaling from the preTCR requires p110delta, but not p110gamma. Mice deficient for the class IB regulatory subunit p101 demonstrated the requirement for p101 in T cell development, implicating G protein-coupled receptor signaling in beta-selection. We found evidence of a role for CXCR4 using small molecule antagonists in an in vitro model of beta-selection and demonstrated a requirement for CXCR4 during thymic development in CXCR4-deficient embryos. Finally, we demonstrate that CXCL12, the ligand for CXCR4, allows for Notch-dependent differentiation of DN3 thymocytes in the absence of supporting stromal cells. These findings establish a role for CXCR4-mediated PI3K signaling that, together with signals from Notch and the preTCR, contributes to continued T cell development beyond beta-selection.",M2
20038483,"Immunosenescence and vaccination of the elderly II. New strategies to restore age-related immune impairment.One of the greatest health-care challenges in the elderly is to ensure that vaccination against infections are optimally effective, but vaccination can only be effective if cells that are capable of responding are still present in the repertoire. The reversing of immunosenescence could be achieved by improving immune responses or altering vaccine formulation. Recent vaccination strategies in the elderly exert low effectiveness. Nutritional interventions and moderate exercise delay T cell senescence. Telomerase activity and expression of toll-like receptors can be improved by chemotherapy. Reversion of thymic atrophy could be achieved by <e>thymus</e> transplantation, depletion of accumulated dysfunctional naive T cells and herpesvirus-specific exhausted memory cells. Administration of immunostimulatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines show the best practical approach. Reduced dendritic cell activity and co-receptor expression might be increased by interleukin (IL)-2 administration. IL-7 protects both B and T lymphocytes, but IL-2, IL-10, keratinocyte growth factor, thymic stromal lymphopoietin, as well as leptin and growth hormone also have a stimulatory effect on thymopoiesis. In animals, several strategies have been explored to produce more efficacious vaccines including high dose vaccines, DNA vaccines with immunostimulatory patch, virosomal vaccines and vaccines containing new adjuvants. Hopefully, one of these approaches will be translated into human therapy in a short time.",M2
20018916,"A highly efficient short hairpin RNA potently down-regulates CCR5 expression in systemic lymphoid organs in the hu-BLT mouse model.Inhibiting the expression of the HIV-1 coreceptor CCR5 holds great promise for controlling HIV-1 infection in patients. Here we report stable knockdown of human CCR5 by a short hairpin RNA (shRNA) in a humanized bone marrow/liver/<e>thymus</e> (BLT) mouse model. We delivered a potent shRNA against CCR5 into human fetal liver-derived CD34(+) hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells (HPSCs) by lentiviral vector transduction. We transplanted vector-transduced HPSCs solidified with Matrigel and a thymus segment under the mouse kidney capsule. Vector-transduced autologous CD34(+) cells were subsequently injected in the irradiated mouse, intended to create systemic reconstitution. CCR5 expression was down-regulated in human T cells and monocytes/macrophages in systemic lymphoid tissues, including gut-associated lymphoid tissue, the major site of HIV-1 replication. The shRNA-mediated CCR5 knockdown had no apparent adverse effects on T-cell development as assessed by polyclonal T-cell receptor Vbeta family development and naive/memory T-cell differentiation. CCR5 knockdown in the secondary transplanted mice suggested the potential of long-term hematopoietic reconstitution by the shRNA-transduced HPSCs. CCR5 tropic HIV-1 infection was effectively inhibited in mouse-derived human splenocytes ex vivo. These results demonstrate that lentiviral vector delivery of shRNA into human HPSCs could stably down-regulate CCR5 in systemic lymphoid organs in vivo.",M2
20017587,"An overview of IL-7 biology and its use in immunotherapy.Interleukin (IL)-7 is required for T-cell development as well as for the survival and homeostasis of mature T-cells. In the <e>thymus</e>, the double negative (DN) CD4(-) CD8(-) thymocyte progenitor transition into double positive CD4+ CD8+ cells requires Notch and IL-7 signaling. Importantly, IL-7 seems to have a dose effect on T-cell development and, at high doses, DN progression is blocked. Naïve T-cells in the thymus, and after their exit to the periphery, are dependent on IL-7 and TCR signaling for survival. Upon antigen exposure, they proliferate and differentiate into memory T-cells. Because IL-7 intervenes at all stages of T-cell development and maintenance, it has been introduced recently into clinical trials as an immunotherapeutic agent for cancer patients (of particular note, those who had undergone T-cell depleting therapy) in an attempt to increase their population sizes of CD4+ and CD8+ cells overall, and specifically of CD8+ (CD45RA+)CCR7+ and/or CD27+), CD4+ (CD45RA+CD31+), and CD4+ central memory T-cells (CD45RA(-)CCR7+). Interestingly, IL-7 in humans induced a preferential expansion of naïve T-cells, resulting in a broader T-cell repertoire than before the treatment; this effect was independent of age. This suggests that IL-7 therapy could enhance immune responses in patients with limited naïve T-cell numbers as in aged patients or after disease-induced or iatrogenic T-cell depletion. This overview highlights the role of IL-7 on T-cells in mice and humans.",M2

20013101,"Radio-guided thoracoscopic surgery with (99m)Tc-methoxy-isobutylisonitrile for treating an ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenoma in an adolescent girl.Here we report the case of a 17-year-old girl treated for an ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenoma using (99m)Tc-methoxy-isobutyl-isonitrile (MIBI) and radio-guided thoracoscopic surgery. Her serum calcium and intact parathyroid hormone levels were elevated, and an anterior mediastinal tumor was noted on her chest computed tomography scan. At 2 h before surgery, the patient was given an injection of 370 MBq of (99m)Tc-MIBI. Because it was not possible visually to distinguish the tumor from the mature thymic tissue in which it was embedded, a search for the tumor was carried out using a gamma probe under thoracoscopy. Thereafter, the left <e>thymus</e>, including the radioactivity-positive tumor, was resected. We suggest that radio-guided thoracoscopic surgery with (99m)Tc-MIBI is an excellent procedure for treating ectopic mediastinal parathyroid adenomas embedded in the mature thymus of adolescents and young adults. This approach could be especially useful for young female patients, given its cosmetic advantage.",M2
20011601,"VEGF gene expression in adult human <e>thymus</e> fat: a correlative study with hypoxic induced factor and cyclooxygenase-2.It is well known that the adult human thymus degenerates into fat tissue; however, it has never been considered as a potential source of angiogenic factors. Recently, we have described that this fat (TAT) produces angiogenic factors and induces human endothelial cell proliferation and migration, indicating its potential angiogenic properties. DESIGN: Adult thymus fat and subcutaneous adipose tissue specimens were obtained from 28 patients undergoing cardiac surgery, making this tissue readily available as a prime source of adipose tissue. We focused our investigation on determining VEGF gene expression and characterizing the different genes, mediators of inflammation and adipogenesis, and which are known to play a relevant role in angiogenesis regulation. RESULTS: We found that VEGF-A was the isoform most expressed in TAT. This expression was accompanied by an upregulation of HIF-1alpha, COX-2 and HO-1 proteins, and by increased HIF-1 DNA binding activity, compared to SAT. Furthermore, we observed that TAT contains a high percentage of mature adipocytes, 0.25% of macrophage cells, 15% of endothelial cells and a very low percentage of thymocyte cells, suggesting the cellular variability of TAT, which could explain the differences in gene expression observed in TAT. Subsequently, we showed that the expression of genes known as adipogenic mediators, including PPARgamma1/gamma2, FABP-4 and adiponectin was similar in both TAT and SAT. Moreover the expression of these latter genes presented a significantly positive correlation with VEGF, suggesting the potential association between VEGF and the generation of adipose tissue in adult thymus. CONCLUSION: Here we suggest that this fat has a potential angiogenic function related to ongoing adipogenesis, which substitutes immune functions within the adult thymus. The expression of VEGF seems to be associated with COX-2, HO-1 and adipogenesis related genes, suggesting the importance that this new fat has acquired in research in relation to adipogenesis and angiogenesis.",M2
20011042,"A cellular automata-based mathematical model for thymocyte development.Intrathymic T cell development is an important process necessary for the normal formation of cell-mediated immune responses. Importantly, such a process depends on interactions of developing thymocytes with cellular and extracellular elements of the thymic microenvironment. Additionally, it includes a series of oriented and tunely regulated migration events, ultimately allowing mature cells to cross endothelial barriers and leave the organ. Herein we built a cellular automata-based mathematical model for thymocyte migration and development. The rules comprised in this model take into account the main stages of thymocyte development, two-dimensional sections of the normal thymic microenvironmental network, as well as the chemokines involved in intrathymic cell migration. Parameters of our computer simulations with further adjusted to results derived from previous experimental data using sub-lethally irradiated mice, in which <e>thymus</e> recovery can be evaluated. The model fitted with the increasing numbers of each CD4/CD8-defined thymocyte subset. It was further validated since it fitted with the times of permanence experimentally ascertained in each CD4/CD8-defined differentiation stage. Importantly, correlations using the whole mean volume of young normal adult mice revealed that the numbers of cells generated in silico with the mathematical model fall within the range of total thymocyte numbers seen in these animals. Furthermore, simulations made with a human thymic epithelial network using the same mathematical model generated similar profiles for temporal evolution of thymocyte developmental stages. Lastly, we provided in silico evidence that the thymus architecture is important in the thymocyte development, since changes in the epithelial network result in different theoretical profiles for T cell development/migration. This model likely can be used to predict thymocyte evolution following therapeutic strategies designed for recovery of the thymus in diseases coursing with thymus involution, such as some primary immunodeficiencies, acute infections, and malnutrition.",M2
20009033,"Multiple extrathymic precursors contribute to T-cell development with different kinetics.T-cell development in the <e>thymus</e> depends on continuous supply of T-cell progenitors from bone marrow (BM). Several extrathymic candidate progenitors have been described that range from multipotent cells to lymphoid cell committed progenitors and even largely T-lineage committed precursors. However, the nature of precursors seeding the thymus under physiologic conditions has remained largely elusive and it is not known whether there is only one physiologic T-cell precursor population or many. Here, we used a competitive in vivo assay based on depletion rather than enrichment of classes of BM-derived precursor populations, thereby only minimally altering physiologic precursor ratios to assess the contribution of various extrathymic precursors to T-lineage differentiation. We found that under these conditions multiple precursors, belonging to both multipotent progenitor (MPP) and common lymphoid progenitor (CLP) subsets have robust T-lineage potential. However, differentiation kinetics of different precursors varied considerably, which might ensure continuous thymic output despite gated importation of extrathymic precursors. In conclusion, our data suggest that the thymus functions to impose T-cell fate on any precursor capable of filling the limited number of progenitor niches.",M2

19921272,"Genetic variation for sensitivity to a thyme monoterpene in associated plant species.Recent studies have shown that plant allelochemicals can have profound effects on the performance of associated species, such that plants with a history of co-existence with  chemical neighbour  plants perform better in their presence compared to naïve plants. This has cast new light on the complexity of plant-plant interactions and plant communities and has led to debates on whether plant communities are more co-evolved than traditionally thought. In order to determine whether plants may indeed evolve in response to other plants' allelochemicals it is crucial to determine the presence of genetic variation for performance under the influence of specific allelochemicals and show that natural selection indeed operates on this variation. We studied the effect of the monoterpene carvacrol-a dominant compound in the essential oil of <e>Thymus</e> pulegioides-on three associated plant species originating from sites where thyme is either present or absent. We found the presence of genetic variation in both naïve and experienced populations for performance under the influence of the allelochemical but the response varied among naïve and experienced plant. Plants from experienced populations performed better than naïve plants on carvacrol soil and contained significantly more seed families with an adaptive response to carvacrol than naïve populations. This suggests that the presence of T. pulegioides can act as a selective agent on associated species, by favouring genotypes which perform best in the presence of its allelochemicals. The response to the thyme allelochemical varied from negative to neutral to positive among the species. The different responses within a species suggest that plant-plant interactions can evolve; this has implications for community dynamics and stability.",M3

This study aimed to investigate the role of water extracts of thyme (Thymus vulgaris) and ginger (Zingiber officinale Roscoe) as natural product extracts to detoxify the injuries of alcohol abuse on liver and brain of mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Alcohol at a dose of 1.25 ml/50 ml water was orally administered at the first day of treatment with continuously increase of 1.25 ml per day to the end of experiment (14 days, 0.1 ml/45 g /d). Mice also were orally administered with alcohol and water extracts of thyme and ginger in concentration of 500 mg /kg body weight for 2 weeks. RESULTS: The results showed very highly significant increase in nitric oxide and malondialdehyde level in liver and brain and a very highly significant decrease in the total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxidase activity in alcoholic group. In addition, the liver function enzymes such as L-gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase and butyryl cholinesterase activities showed very highly significant increase in alcoholic group. In contrast, the water extracts of thyme and ginger showed significant amelioration on these changes both in liver and brain tissues. CONCLUSION: The water extracts of thyme and ginger has detoxifying and antioxidant effects. Therefore, it is recommended to use them to avoid alcohol toxicity.",M3
19449560,"[Patch diversity and spatial structure of wild <e>Thymus</e> quinquecostatus]With the combination of ISSR (inter-simple sequence repeats), SRAP (sequence-related amplified polymorphism) and spatial autocorrelation, the genetic diversity and spatial structure per unit patch of three Huaiyuan populations of Thymus quinquecostatus in southeast China were analyzed. The results showed that there existed higher levels of genetic and clonal diversity among the patches within the wild T. quinquecostatus populations, with the percentage of polymorphic loc being 75.75%, Nei's gene diversity being 0.2537, Shannon's information index being 0.3811, percent of genetype (G/N) being 0.61, Simpson index (D) being 0.96, and Fager index (E) being 0.91. Analysis of molecular variance (AMOVA) showed that only 9.65% of genetic variation resided among the populations, while 90.35% of it resided among the individuals within the populations. No genotype patches in common were observed among the three populations. The spatial distribution of the same patches showed a concentrated distribution about 0-25 m, and that of different patches showed an inlaid distribution. Except for some locations that showed par correlations in the Huaiyuan populations of T. quinquecostatus, most locations lacked in spatial structure according to spatial autocorrelation analysis. The possible mechanism causing the establishment of the patches of T. quinquecostatus populations was due to seed dispersing, and the following clonal reproduction played important roles in patch development and population expanding.",M3
19413124,"The essential oil of <e>Thymus</e> aureopunctatus (Beck) K. Malý.Essential oil of Thymus aureopunctatus (Beck) K. Malý, obtained by hydrodistillation and headspace technique, was subjected to capillary GC-MS analysis, and its volatile composition was compared with essential oil profile of Thymus serpyllum L. and a botanically undetermined thyme species, Thymus spp., all growing wild in the same habitat in Bosnia and Herzegovina. This paper presents the first report on phytochemical analysis of the rare T. aureopunctatus species, and also the first report on headspace analysis of plants belonging to the genus Thymus. One hundred and two volatile constituents were identified. The investigated Thymus species of Bosnian origin clearly belong to the thymol-chemotype with relatively abundant level of this main constituent varying from 30.5% for T. serpyllum, and 34.5% for T. aureopunctatus, to 44.2% for Thymus spp., while their corresponding headspace samples contain very high percentage of p-cymene, thymol biosynthesis precursor, in the range from 29.1% to 68.1%.",M3
19347798,"Additive antimicrobial [corrected] effects of the active components of the essential oil of <e>Thymus</e> vulgaris--chemotype carvacrol.Herbal remedies are multicomponent mixtures by their nature as well as by pharmaceutical definition. Being a multicomponent mixture is not only a crucial property of herbal remedies, it also represents a precondition for interactions such as synergism or antagonism. Until now, only a few phytomedicines are accurately described concerning the interactions of their active components. The aim of this study was to search for interactions within such a naturally given multi-component mixture and to discuss the pharmaceutical and clinical impacts. The thyme oil chosen for the examination belongs to the essential oils with the most pronounced antimicrobial activity. Antibiotic activity of thyme oil and single active components were tested against six different strains of microorganisms. The checkerboard assay was used to search for interactions. The time-kill assay was used to verify the observed effects and to get information about the temporal resolution of the antimicrobial activity. The degree of the detected interactions corresponded with the demarcating FICI measure of 0.5, which separates the additive from the over-additive (synergistic) effects. Therefore, the observed effect was called a  borderline case of synergism  or, respectively,  partial synergism . Partial synergism was observed only in the presence of Klebsiella pneumoniae. Additive antimicrobial activity was observed for the combination of the two monosubstances carvacrol plus linalool and thymol plus linalool as well as with the combination of the two essential oils of the carvacrol and linalool chemotypes. An increase of the carvacrol oil concentration from one to two times the MIC resulted in a considerable acceleration of the kill-rate. Thyme oil is composed of several different components that show antimicrobial activity (at least: carvacrol, thymol and linalool). The antimicrobial activity of thyme oil is partly based on additive effects, which might especially enhance the rapidity of the antimicrobial action. In addition, a mixture of several active ingredients that varies in its composition from year to year and from lot to lot as is the case with herbal remedies may be more stable concerning the antimicrobial activity than mixtures containing just a single active component.",M3

The fungicidal activity was determined and expressed as a Number of Decimal Reduction of the colony forming units per ml (NDR cfu). The influence of pH variation on this activity was studied. The NDR cfu varied with the essential oils and its concentration, the pH of the medium and the strain tested. The essential oils from O. gratissimum exhibited the highest activity against the six fungal strains under the three pH tested. T. vulgaris and C. citratus essential oils were less active against the Penicillium species tested and A. ochraceus, respectively. Potassium sorbate did not present any activity at pH 6 and 9. At pH 3, its NDR cfu was the lowest against the six fungal strains. At the same pH and at 4000 ppm, the three essential oils presented a NRD cfu &gt; or = 6 against strains of A. ochraceus and P. expansum. The same result was obtained with T. vulgaris and C. citratus at 8000 ppm against both strains of P. verrucosum. The highest activity of the three essential oils was recorded at pH 3 against A. ochraceus strains and at pH 9 against both species of Penicillium. From the fractionation, three active fractions were obtained each from C. citratus and O. gratissimum, and two active fractions from T. vulgaris. These active fractions exhibited a NDR cfu, two to seven folds higher than that of the complete essential oils.",M3

Many investigations are performed to find an effective and safe treatment for leishmaniasis. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy of herbal extracts of Thymus vulgaris (Thyme) and Achillea millefolium (Yarrow), propolis hydroalcoholic extract and systemic glucantime against cutaneous leishmaniasis in Balb/c mice. METHODS: A total of 45 mice were randomised into five groups each including nine mice. They were treated with pure ethanol 70 degrees, systemic glucantime, Achillea millefolium hydroalcoholic extract, Thymus vulgaris hydroalcoholic extract and propolis hydroalcoholic extract for six weeks. The statistical tests including student t-test were used for analysis. Data were analyzed by SPSS software, ver 13.00. RESULTS: Mean of ulcer size reduction were -17.66, -22.57, 43.29, 36.09 and 43.77% for the alcohol, glucantime, yarrow, thyme and propolis groups, respectively. The results were suggestive that Thymus vulgaris, Achillea millefolium and propolis hydroalcoholic extracts were significantly more effective in reduction of ulcer size as compared with glucantime (p = 0.006, 0.002 and 0.008, respectively). INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: Our results are suggestive that Thymus vulgaris, Achillea millefolium and propolis extracts are effective for treatment of cutaneous leishmaniasis in mice. Regarding these results, we suggest that efficacy of these extracts alone or in combination are evaluated against human cutaneous leishmaniasis as a randomized clinical trial.",M3

F.) Jalas was evaluated against two stored-product beetles Tribolium castaneum (Herbst) and Callosobruchus maculatus (F.). Dry flowering aerial parts of the plant were subjected to hydro distillation using a modified Clevenger-type apparatus. The repellent and fumigant toxicity were tested against 1-7 days old adult beetles at 27 +/- 1 degrees C and 65 +/- 5% RH in dark condition. The repellency on C. maculatus and T. castaneum at highest concentration (2 microL/mL acetone) was 82.40% and 70.40% respectively. Fumigation bioassays showed that C. maculatus adults were significantly more susceptible (LC50 = 2.39 microL/L air) to the essential oil than T. castaneum adults (LC50 = 234.42 microL/L air). It could be concluded that T. persicus may have potential for applications in management of stored-product pests because of its safety, strong repellency and fumigant toxicity.",M3
19200700,"Isolation and identification of antibacterial compounds from <e>Thymus</e> kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds.AIM OF THE STUDY: The aerial parts of Thymus kotschyanus Boiss. and Hohen. (Lamiaceae) and flower buds of Dianthus caryophyllus L. (Caryophyllaceae) have been traditionally implemented in the treatment of wounds, throat and gum infections and gastro-intestinal disorder by the indigenous people of northern Iraq, although the compounds responsible for the medicinal properties have not been identified. In this study, antibacterial compounds from both plants were isolated and characterized, and the biological activity of each compound was assessed individually and combined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Compounds were isolated and characterized from the extracted essential oils of both plants using different spectral techniques: TLC, FTIR spectra and HPLC. The minimum inhibitory concentrations MIC values for the compounds were assessed individually and combined based on a microdilution and the checkerboard method in 96 multi-well microtiter plates. RESULTS: Two known compounds were isolated from the essential oils of both plants and were identified as thymol and eugenol. The isolated compounds were investigated for their single and combined antibacterial activities against seven selected pathogenic bacteria; Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus cereus, Listeria monocytogenes, Proteus mirabilis, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Thymol MIC values ranged from 15.6 to 250.0 microg/ml and B. cereus was found to be the most sensitive pathogen with a MIC value of 15.6 microg/ml. Eugenol achieved stronger MIC values against most tested pathogens and the best MIC value (15.6 microg/ml) was observed against B. cereus, L. monocytogenes and K. pneumoniae whereas, S. aureus, P. mirabilis and E. coli were inhibited with a MIC value of 31.2 microg/ml. Combination results had antibacterial enhancement against most pathogens and the best synergistic result was seen against P. mirabilis and E. coli. CONCLUSIONS: The isolation of two antibacterial compounds from Thymus kotschyanus aerial parts and Dianthus caryophyllus flower buds validates the use of these species in the treatment of throat and gum infections, wound-healing and gastro-intestinal disorder.",M3
19187494,"The antimicrobial activity of four commercial essential oils in combination with conventional antimicrobials.AIMS: Due to the emergence of multi-drug resistance, alternatives to conventional antimicrobial therapy are needed. This study aims to investigate the in vitro pharmacological interactions between essential oils (considered valuable as natural therapeutic treatments) and conventional antimicrobials (ciprofloxacin/amphotericin B) when used in combination. METHODS AND RESULTS: Interactions of the essential oils (Melaleuca alternifolia, <e>Thymus</e> vulgaris, Mentha piperita and Rosmarinus officinalis) when combined with ciprofloxacin against Staphylococcus aureus indicate mainly antagonistic profiles. When tested against Klebsiella pneumoniae the isobolograms show antagonistic, synergistic and additive interactions depending on the combined ratio. The R. officinalis/ciprofloxacin combination against K. pneumoniae displayed the most favourable synergistic pattern. The interactions of M. alternifolia (tea tree), T. vulgaris (thyme), M. piperita (peppermint) and R. officinalis (rosemary) essential oils with amphotericin B indicate mainly antagonistic profiles when tested against Candida albicans. CONCLUSION: While a number of interactions show complete antagonism, others show varied (synergistic, additive and/or antagonistic) interactions, thus the efficacy is dependent on the ratio in which the two components co-exist. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The predominant antagonistic interactions noted here, suggests that some natural therapies containing essential oils should be used with caution when combined with antibiotics.",M3

The aim of this work was to examine the role of TV on acute and chronic pain and compares its effect with dexamethasone (DEX) and stress (ST) by using hot plate, tail flick and formalin tests in mice. In this study male albino mice (25-30 g.) in 21 groups (n=147) were used. TV (100, 500 and 1000 mg/kg), DEX (0.5, 1 and 2 mg/kg) and vehicle (VEH) were injected 30 minutes before pain assessment tests. Stress was applied by 1 min swimming in cold water (18-22 degrees ). Acute and chronic pain was assessed by hot plate, tail flick and formalin tests. For assessment of the role of opioid receptors in antinoceception of TV extract, Naloxon (NAL, 2mg/kg, ip) as opioid receptor antagonist was injected before the injection of the more effective dose (500 mg/kg) of TV extract. Results indicated that TV, DEX and ST have analgesic effects in all tests (P&lt;0.01 in comparison with control group).

In the present study, hydroalcoholic extracts of Glinus lotoides, Plumbago zeylanica, Rumex steudelii and <e>Thymus</e> schimperi were evaluated for their DNA damaging effects using the comet assay. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Mouse lymphoma L5178Y cells were exposed to different concentrations of the extracts for 3h with and without metabolic activation (S9-mix) using 4-nitroquinoline-N-oxide and benzo(a)pyrene as positive controls, and vehicles as negative controls. RESULTS: In the absence of S9, all extracts were found to induce significant DNA damage without affecting the cell viability. T. schimperi and R. steudelii were the most potent DNA-damaging extracts, and G. lotoides and P. zeylanica the least potent. The addition of S9 had different effects on the DNA damage induced by the extracts: it lowered the DNA damaging effect of P. zeylanica, did not affect the DNA damaging effect of T. schimperi, and increased the DNA damaging effects of R. steudelii and G. lotoides.

Gaya in South Korea), T. quinquecostotus var. japonica (Ulreung island in South Korea), T. mongolicus (Northeastern Asia), and T. serpyllum (Europe). The GC/SAW involving the fragrance pattern analysis provides a novel analytical method with a very fast separation and characterization of aromas caused by the delicate difference of chemical composition according to botanical and geographical origin. On the comparison of experiments, the characteristic components and analytical tendency for air-dried thymus species detected by GC/SAW appear to be quite similar to those obtained by headspace solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME)-GC-MS, but the abundance ratios between these two methods are different. In addition to that, the discrimination of various thymus species by using VaporPrint image based on GC/SAW provides a quite reliable result. On the basis of principal component analysis (PCA) results, the ability for classification among species of completely different chemotypes by HS-SPME-GC-MS is good enough, but the classification of same chemotypes species which are from different geographical origin in same country, original species and its variety, an air-drying term for 13 days and 16 months appear much lower than GC/SAW. Interestingly, the present experiment reveals that the air-drying term influences the aroma composition: the concentration of the pharmacologically active species, monoterpene phenol (thymol), reaches its highest concentrations after it was dried for 5 days or 13 days, which is much higher than in fresh or over-dried for a long times.",M3

Twelve accessions originating from southern France and the variety 'Deutscher Winter' were grown in an experimental field in eastern Austria. Leaf samples from these plants as well as from a commercial thyme rich in thymol were analyzed for their essential oil and the antioxidative potential in various extracts. The assays for antioxidative activity were the total phenolics according to the Folin-Ciocalteu method, DPPH decoloration, and Fe(3+) reduction (FRAP). Both extraction techniques used, in the water bath at 40 degrees C and in the ultrasonic bath at room temperature, proved to be efficient. The best results were obtained with 60% ethanol as extractant. In the comparison of the different accessions the less active and the most active of these extracts differed by factors of 2.1 and 2.6 in the total phenolics and FRAP assay, respectively, and by factors 1.5-2.0 in the DPPH assay. Rosmarinic acid accounted for 22-55% of the antioxidant activity in the ethanolic extracts. Essential oils with high proportions of the phenolic components thymol and/or carvacrol showed the highest antioxidant activity. Ethanolic extracts from the residues after distillation were considerably lower in antioxidant activity than the respective extracts from the dried leaves. Extracts with CH2Cl2 in the ultrasonic bath contained volatiles in proportions close to the essential oil but displayed very low antioxidant activity.",M3

Because of a large number of freshly cut, dried or frozen plant samples requiring the determination of essential oil amount and composition, a fast, safe, simple, efficient and highly automatic sample preparation method is needed. Five sample preparation methods (steam distillation, extraction in the Soxhlet apparatus, supercritical fluid extraction, solid phase microextraction and pressurized liquid extraction) used for the isolation of aroma-active components from Thymus vulgaris L. are compared in the paper. The methods are mainly discussed with regard to the recovery of components which typically exist in essential oil isolated by steam distillation. According to the obtained data, PLE is the most efficient sample preparation method in determining the essential oil from the thyme herb. Although co-extraction of non-volatile ingredients is the main drawback of this method, it is characterized by the highest yield of essential oil components and the shortest extraction time required. Moreover, the relative peak amounts of essential components revealed by PLE are comparable with those obtained by steam distillation, which is recognized as standard sample preparation method for the analysis of essential oils in aromatic plants.",M3

Moreover, in the hot plate test, it significantly raised the pain threshold. While in the writhing test produced a significant decrease in the number of writhing in comparison with the control group (P&lt;0.001). The results of pharmacological tests performed in the present study suggest that the extract of T. pubescens presents analgesic and anti-inflammatory effects.",M3
18380074,"In vitro antimicrobial activity and antagonistic effect of essential oils from plant species.Kahramanmaras, is a developing city located in the southern part of Turkey <e>Thymus</e> eigii (M. Zohary and RH.

The study was designed to examine the antimicrobial activities of essential oils of these plants by the disc diffusion and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) methods. In addition, antimicrobial activity of Thymus eigii was researched by effects when it was used together with antibiotics and even when it was combined with other essential oils. When the results of this study were compared with vancomycin (30 mcg) and erytromycin (15 mcg) standards, it was found that Thymus eigii essential oil was particularly found to possess strongerantimicrobial activity whereas other essential oils showed susceptible or moderate activity However, antimicrobial activity changed also by in vitro interactions between antibiotics and Thymus eigii essential oil, also between essential oils of these plants and that of Thymus eigii causing synergic, additive, antagonist effect.",M3
18326186,"Acaricidal activity of <e>Thymus</e> vulgaris oil and its main components against Tyrophagus putrescentiae, a stored food mite.The acaricidal activities of compounds derived from Thymus vulgaris (thyme) oil against Tyrophagus putrescentiae were assessed using an impregnated fabric disk bioassay, and were compared with those of the synthetic acaricides, benzyl benzoate and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide. The observed responses differed according to dosage and chemical components. The 50% lethal dose (LD50) value of the T. vulgaris oil against T. putrescentiae was 10.2 microg/cm2. Biologically active constituents derived from T. vulgaris oil were purified by using silica gel chromatography and high-performance liquid chromatography. The structures of acaricidal components were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), 13C NMR, 1H-13C COSY-NMR, and DEPT-NMR spectra, and were subsequently identified as carvacrol and thymol. Carvacrol was the most toxic compound with LD50 values (4.5 microg/cm2) significantly different from thymol (11.1 microg/cm2), benzyl benzoate (11.3 microg/cm2), and N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide (13.9 microg/cm2). Linalool was as toxic as was N,N-diethyl-m-toluamide. The lower LD50 of carvacrol indicates that it may be the major contributor of the toxicity of T. vulagaris oil against the stored food mite, although it only constitutes 14.2% of the oil. From this point of view, carvacrol and thymol can be very useful as potential control agents against stored food mite.",M3

17934650,"Cytotoxic effect of essential oil of thyme (<e>Thymus</e> broussonettii) on the IGR-OV1 tumor cells resistant to chemotherapy.The anti-tumor effect of the Moroccan endemic thyme (Thymus broussonettii) essential oil (EOT) was investigated in vitro using the human ovarian adenocarcinoma IGR-OV1 parental cell line OV1/P and its chemoresistant counterparts OV1/adriamycin (OV1/ADR), OV1/vincristine (OV1/VCR), and OV1/cisplatin (OV1/CDDP). All of these cell lines elicited various degrees of sensitivity to the cytotoxic effect of EOT. The IC50 values (mean +/- SEM, v/v) were 0.40 +/- 0.02, 0.39 +/- 0.02, 0.94 +/- 0.05, and 0.65 +/- 0.03% for OV1/P, OV1/ADR, OV1/VCR, and OV1/CDDP, respectively. Using the DBA-2/P815 (H2d) mouse model, tumors were developed by subcutaneous grafting of tumor fragments of similar size obtained from P815 (murin mastocytoma cell line) injected in donor mouse. Interestingly, intra-tumoral injection of EOT significantly reduced solid tumor development. Indeed, by the 30th day of repeated EOT treatment, the tumor volumes of the animals were 2.00 +/- 0.27, 1.35 +/- 0.20, and 0.85 +/- 0.18 cm(3) after injection with 10, 30, or 50 microL per 72 h (six times), respectively, as opposed to 3.88 +/- 0.50 cm(3) for the control animals. This tumoricidal effect was associated with a marked decrease of mouse mortality. In fact, in these groups of mice, the recorded mortality by the 30th day of treatment was 30 +/- 4, 18 +/- 4, and 8 +/- 3%, respectively, while the control animals showed 75 +/- 10% of mortality. These data indicate that the EOT which contains carvacrol as the major component has an important in vitro cytotoxic activity against tumor cells resistant to chemotherapy as well as a significant antitumor effect in mice. However, our data do not distinguish between carvacrol and the other components of EOT as the active factor.",M3

The MIC values of peppermint, fennel, thyme, pennyroyal and caraway essential oils against Escherichia coli were 0.5 +/- 0.03, 1 +/- 0.03, 0.3 +/- 0.01, 0.7 +/- 0.03 and 0.6 +/- 0.02% and in contrast, for Staphylococcus aureus were 0.4 +/- 0.01, 2 +/- 0.13, 0.1 +/- 0.01, 0.5 +/- 0.02 and 0.5 +/- 0.02%, respectively. The MBC values of peppermint, fennel, thyme, pennyroyal and caraway essential oils for Escherichia coli were 0.7 +/- 0.02, 2 +/- 0.05, 0.5 +/- 0.02, 1 +/- 0.02 and 0.8 +/- 0.02 and for Staphylococcus aureus were 0.5 +/- 0.02, 4 +/- 0.26, 0.3 +/- 0.02, 0.7 +/- 0.02 and 0.6 +/- 0.01, respectively. Statistical evaluation of the results indicated that the essential oils of thyme (Thymus vulgaris) showed the broadest spectrum of action (p &lt; 0.05). Essential oils of peppermint (Mentha piperita), caraway seed (Carum carvi), pennyroyal (Menthae pullegium) and fennel (Foeniculum vulgar) had moderate effect against tested microorganisms and in contrast, tarragon essential oil were less effective against tested microorganisms.

METHODS: Different concentrations of an aqueous extract of thyme were prepared and the effects investigated on growth of S. mutans. Furthermore, the effect of these extracts on adhesion of S. mutans to buccal epithelial cells was also investigated and compared with the effects of chlorhexidine digluconate. RESULTS: The data revealed that exposure of S. mutans to thyme extract showed a time and concentration-dependent decrease in bacterial viability. The greatest effect was observed when S. mutans had been exposed to 20% thyme extract for a period of 48 h which resulted in 96% inhibition of bacterial growth. Furthermore, the adhesion of S. mutans to buccal epithelial cells was also reduced when either buccal epithelial cells or S. mutans had been pre-incubated with different concentrations of aqueous thyme extracts (83-98% and 75-89% inhibition respectively). There was also greater reduction in the adherence of bacterial cells to buccal epithelial cells after mouth rinsing with 20% aqueous thyme extract compared to rinsing with chlorhexidine digluconate (45% and 89% inhibition of bacterial adhesion respectively). CONCLUSION: The diminished adherence of S. mutans to buccal epithelial cells after exposure to various concentrations of aqueous thyme extract as well as the antimicrobial properties of this plant may have clinical relevance.",M3

This study evaluated the effects of gamma- and e-beam ionizing radiations (25 kGy) on three plants used as food or as medicinal products (Thymus vulgaris L., Eucalyptus radiata D.C., and Lavandula angustifolia Mill.) as well as their effects on extracted or commercial essential oils and pure standard samples. Comparison between irradiated and nonirradiated samples was performed by GC/FID and GC/MS. At the studied doses, gamma and e-beam ionizing radiation did not induce any detectable qualitative or quantitative significant changes in the contents and yields of essential oils immediately after ionizing radiation of plants or commercial essential oils and standards. As the maximum dose tested (25 kGy) is a sterilizing dose (much higher than doses used for decontamination of vegetable drugs), it is likely that even decontamination with lower doses will not modify yields or composition of essential oils of these three plants.",M3

The results indicate a dose-dependent protective effect of the tested essential oils and aqueous tea infusions on the copper-induced LDL oxidation. The protective effect of essential oils is assigned to the presence of phenolic monoterpenes, thymol and carvacrol, which are identified as the dominant compounds in these essential oils. The strong protective effect of aqueous tea infusions is proposed to be the consequence of large amounts of polyphenols, namely rosmarinic acid and flavonoids (quercetin, eriocitrin, luteolin-7-O-glucoside, apigenin-7-O-glucoside, luteolin, apigenin), with the most pronounced effect in the case of oregano.

METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty samples of wall scrapes were collected from damp dwellings in Zagreb, the capital of Croatia. The members of the following mould genera were recovered from the samples: Aspergillus (44%), Penicillium (18%) Alternaria, Ulocladium, Absidia and Mucor (8%) Cladosporium, Trichoderma and Rhizopus (6%), and Chaetomium (2%). Two strains of Stachybotrys chartarum were isolated from damp dwellings in Slovakia. Antifungal activities of the thyme essential oil, which contains p-cymene (36.5%), thymol (33.0%) and 1,8-cineole (11.3%) as main components, and pure thymol were determined by the dilution method and exposure to vaporous phase of the oil. Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of both thymol and essential oil were bellow 20 microg ml(-1), except for Mucor spp. (50.20 microg ml(-1)). Thymol exhibited approximately three-times stronger inhibition than essential oil of thyme. The vaporous phase of the thyme essential oil (82 microg l(-1)) in glass chambers strongly suppressed the sporulation of moulds during 60 days of exposure. CONCLUSION: The thyme essential oil possesses a wide range spectrum of fungicidal activity. The vaporous phase of the oil exhibited long-lasting suppressive activity on moulds from damp dwellings. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: Essential oil of thyme and thymol could be used for disinfection of mouldy walls in the dwellings in low concentration.",M3

(oregano) and Thymus vulgaris L. (thyme) on growth and ultrastructure of diverse evolutive forms of Trypanosoma cruzi. Culture epimastigotes and bloodstream trypomastigotes were incubated for 24 h with different concentrations of oregano or thyme essential oils and with thymol (the main constituent of thyme), and the inhibitory concentration (IC)(50) was determined by cell counting. Crude extract of oregano essential oil inhibited epimastigote growth (IC(50)/24 h = 175 microg/ml) and also induced trypomastigote lysis (IC(50)/24 h = 115 microg/ml). Thyme essential oil presented IC(50)/24 h values of 77 microg/ml for epimastigotes and 38 mug/ml for trypomastigotes, while treatment with thymol resulted in an IC(50)/24 h of 62 microg/ml for epimastigotes and 53 microg/ml for trypomastigotes. Scanning electron microscopy of treated cells showed few morphological alterations at the plasma membrane. Observation by transmission electron microscopy showed cytoplasmic swelling with occasional morphological alterations in plasma and flagellar membrane.

The MIC and minimal lethal concentration were used to evaluate the antifungal activity against Candida (seven clinical isolates and four ATCC type strains), Aspergillus [five clinical isolates, and two Colección Española de Cultivos Tipo (CECT) and two ATCC type strains] and five clinical dermatophyte strains. Antifungal activity was evaluated for the essential oil and for its main components. To clarify its mechanism of action on yeasts and filamentous fungi, flow-cytometric studies of cytoplasmic membrane integrity were performed, and the effect on the amount of ergosterol was investigated. Results showed that T. pulegioides essential oil exhibited a significant activity against clinically relevant fungi, mainly due to lesion formation in the cytoplasmic membrane and a considerable reduction of the ergosterol content.

DP-CO2 processing insignificantly altered initial juice phytochemical and antioxidant content, whereas thermal pasteurization reduced anthocyanins (263 mg/L), ascorbic acid (42 mg/L), soluble phenolics (266 mg/L), and antioxidant capacity (6 microM Trolox equivalents/mL). Similar trends were observed during storage, and data showed that increasing the CO2 level from 8 to 16% during DP-CO2 was instrumental in reducing juice phytochemical and antioxidant degradation. Copigmentation was instrumental in retaining higher anthocyanin, soluble phenolics, and antioxidant capacity during storage without affecting initial juice aroma and flavor characteristics. Moreover, on the basis of overall likeability scores, panelists preferred copigmented juices, which had increased juice color intensity and masked the detrimental color fading that occurred during storage, especially when compared to thermally pasteurized juices.

Two essential oils were used, one from Thymus hyemalis (TH), rich in carvacrol, and the other from Thymus zygis (TZ), rich in thymol. Four experimental treatments of in vitro degradability, using the Daisy II(200/220) incubator, were conducted including a negative control (CO), a positive control at 7.5 microg/mL of monensin (MO), and two treatments with essential oils (TH or TZ) at 1.35 microL/mL. The material was incubated at 39.5 degrees C for various lengths of time. At each time, the disappearance of dry matter, crude protein, and neutral detergent fiber was measured. Volatile fatty acids (VFAs) were determined after 48 h of incubation. CO and MO provided (p &lt; 0.01) higher values of potential degradability (a + b) of DM than the TH and TZ treatments (72.6 and 70.8 vs 53.2 and 48.2%, respectively). Also, crude protein degradability was lowest in the essential oil treatments. The CO treatment showed the highest potential degradability of NDF. The values of VFA production obtained (p &lt; 0.001) with CO and MO treatments were higher than those obtained with TH and TZ treatments (21.0 and 19.1 vs 11.2 and 10.1 mM).

However, polyploids with polysomic inheritance have hitherto been severely underrepresented in plant population genetic studies, mainly due to a lack of appropriate molecular genetic markers. Here we report the establishment and experimental validation of six fully informative microsatellite markers in tetraploid gynodioecious Thymus praecox agg. Sequence data of 150 microsatellite alleles and their flanking regions revealed high variation, which may be characteristic for polyploids with a reticulate evolutionary history. Understanding the patterns of mutation (indels and substitutions) in microsatellite flanking-sequences was a prerequisite for the development of co-dominant markers for fragment analyses. Allelic segregation patterns among progeny arrays from ten test crosses revealed tetrasomic inheritance in T. praecox agg. No evidence of frequent double reduction was detected. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) based dosage effects allowed for precise assignment of allelic configuration at all six microsatellite loci. The quantification of allele copy numbers in PCR was verified by comparisons of observed and expected gametic allele frequencies and heterozygosities in test crosses. Our study illustrates how PCR based markers can provide reliable estimates of heterozygosity and, thus, powerful tools for breeding system and population genetic analyses in polyploid organisms.",M3

Thyme or oregano herbs or a combination of both were offered in two different concentrations each (1% and 0.1%) as additive (experimental diets) in standard diet in comparison to the latter without herbal additive (control diet) free of choice. The dosage of the two herbs in terms of total essential oil(s) in the feeds used in the study was 0.02% or 0.002% (v/w), which was equivalent to 1% or 0.1% herbs in the mixture, respectively. A Latin square according to Williams (1949) was used with 6 groups in order to record possible differences in feed intake. All experimental diets aside from that mixed with 0.1% thyme herb were, in comparison to the control diet, significantly less ingested.

The antioxidant activity was evaluated as a free radical scavenging capacity (RSC), together with effects on lipid peroxidation (LP). RSC was assessed measuring the scavenging activity of the essential oils on 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazil (DPPH(*)) and OH(*) radicals. Effects on LP were evaluated following the activities of essential oils in Fe(2+)/ascorbate and Fe(2+)/H(2)O(2) systems of induction. Essential oils exhibited very strong RSCs, reducing the DPPH radical formation (IC(50)) in the range from 0.17 (oregano) to 0.39 microg/mL (basil). The essential oil of T. vulgaris exhibited the highest OH radical scavenging activity, although none of the examined essential oils reached 50% of neutralization (IC(50)).

The antinociceptive effect of the aqueous, butanolic and ethyl acetate extracts of this species was examined in rats and mice using chemical and thermal models. The results obtained showed that aqueous and butanolic extracts exerted an antinociceptive activity in the two phases of formalin (50-300 mg/kg), tail immersion and writhing tests. Whereas, the ethyl acetate extract reduced the nociceptive response only in the second phase of formalin (100-300 mg/kg) and writhing tests. The aqueous extract, which is the most effective, contains active analgesic principles acting both centrally and peripherally. Furthermore, this antinociceptive effect has been avoided by naloxone at a dose of 1mg/kg in the first phase of formalin and hot plate tests indicating that this extract acts partly through an opioid-mediated mechanism. The present results demonstrated that Thymus broussonetii contains active constituents which possess antinociceptive activity justifying its popular use to relieve some pains.",M3
16450709,"The use of Thymi Herba as feed additive (0.1%, 0.5%, 1.0%) in weanling piglets with assessment of the shedding of haemolysing E. coli and the detection of thymol in the blood plasma.Thymi Herba (<e>Thymus</e> vulgaris, rubbed) was given as feed additive to weanling piglets. 3 concentrations (0.1%, 0.5%, 1%) were tested against a control group. Rectal swabs were collected weekly and were sent in for bacterial testing. The shedding of haemolysing E. coli was evaluated. There was no significant difference in the shedding of haemolysing E. coli between the 4 groups. Neither was there a difference in the distribution of the various serotypes. Thymol was detected in the blood plasma in all thyme groups. The increase in thymol level with greater amounts of thyme herb was significant. Three days after withdrawal of the feed additive no thymol levels were detected. The study results did not reveal any effects on haemolysing E. coli in the gut.",M3
16497088,"Effects of selected plant essential oils on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo.Plant essential oils (EOs) have been reported to have health benefit properties and their preventive and therapeutic use in animals is expected to increase in the future. We evaluated the influence of five essential oils obtained from plant species which are known to have positive antimicrobial, antioxidative and anti-inflammatory effects--sage EO from Salvia officinalis L. (Lamiaceae), oregano EO from Origanum vulgare L. (Lamiaceae), thyme EO from <e>Thymus</e> vulgaris L. (Lamiaceae), clove EO from Syzygium aromaticum L. (Myrtaceae) and cinnamon EO from Cinnamomum zeylanicum Blume (Lauraceae) on the growth and development of mouse preimplantation embryos in vivo. Essential oils were added to commercial diet at concentrations of 0.25% for sage EO, thyme EO, clove EO, cinnamon EO and 0.1% for oregano EO, and fed to ICR female mice for 2 weeks ad libitum. Females were then mated with males of the same strain. Embryos obtained on Day 4 of pregnancy at the blastocyst stage were stained by morphological triple staining (Hoechst, PI, Calcein-AM) and evaluated using fluorescent microscopy. The effects of essential oils were estimated by the viability of embryos, number of nuclei and distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Cinnamon EO significantly decreased the number of nuclei and the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number was significantly altered. Sage EO negatively influenced the distribution of embryos according to nucleus number. Clove and oregano EOs induced a significantly increased rate of cell death. Only thyme EO had no detectable effects on embryo development. In conclusion, none of the essential oils had any positive effect on embryo development, but some of them reduced the number of cells and increased the incidence of cell death.",M3
16397917,"Relaxant effect of <e>Thymus</e> vulgaris on guinea-pig tracheal chains and its possible mechanism(s).Thymus vulgaris for the treatment of respiratory diseases is indicated widely, and relaxant effects on smooth muscle have been shown previously. In the present study, the relaxant effects of macerated and aqueous extracts of Thymus vulgaris on tracheal chains of guinea-pigs were examined using cumulative concentrations of macerated and aqueous extracts in comparison with saline (as the negative control) and theophylline (as the positive control). The relaxant effects of four cumulative concentrations of macerated and aqueous extracts (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 g %) in comparison with saline (as the negative control) and four cumulative concentrations of theophylline (0.25, 0.5, 0.75 and 1.0 mm; as the positive control) were examined for their relaxant effects on precontracted tracheal chains of guinea-pig by 60 mm KCl and 10 microm methacholine in two different conditions: non-incubated tissues and incubated tissues with 1 microm propranolol and 1 microm chlorphenamine. There were significant correlations between the relaxant effects and the concentrations for both extracts and theophylline in all experimental groups (p &lt; 0.01 to p &lt; 0.001). These results demonstrated a potent relaxant effect of Thymus vulgaris on guinea-pig tracheal chains that was comparable to theophylline at the concentrations used.",M3
16412677,"Ultrastructural studies on antimicrobial efficacy of thyme essential oils on Listeria monocytogenes.OBJECTIVES: Listeria monocytogenes has gained increasing attention as a pathogen of public health importance owing to large numbers of food-borne outbreaks of listeriosis. Because of negative consumer perception of chemical preservatives, attention is shifting towards natural alternatives. Particular interest has been focused on the potential application of plant essential oils. The objective of the present study was to determine ultrastructural changes brought about by essential oils from two types of thyme, <e>Thymus</e> eriocalyx and Thymus x-porlock, on Listeria monocytogenes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimal bactericidal (MBC) concentrations and bactericidal kinetics of the oils were determined. Listeria monocytogenes were treated with essential oils from two thyme species and observed under a transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: The oils from the above plants were found to be strongly antimicrobial. Analysis of the oils by gas chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry lead to the identification of 18 and 19 components in T. eriocalyx and T. x-porlock oils, respectively. Listeria monocytogenes treated with essential oils from the two thyme species exhibited a thickened or disrupted cell wall with increased roughness and lack of cytoplasm. CONCLUSION: The antilisterial effects of thyme oil are stronger than the action of electric shocks in combination with nisin reported in the literature. It is concluded that essential oils such as thyme oil, which inhibited the growth of L. monocytogenes at low concentrations, could be considered as preservative materials for some kinds of foods; they could find an application as additives to foodstuffs in storage to protect them from listerial contamination.",M3
16289146,"Chemoprevention by thyme oils of Aspergillus parasiticus growth and aflatoxin production.The essential oils from <e>Thymus</e> eriocalyx and Thymus X-porlock obtained by hydrodistillation were analyzed by GC/MS. The major components of T. eriocalyx and T. X-porlock oils were thymol (63.8, 31.7%), beta-phellandrene (13.30, 38.7%), cis-sabinene hydroxide (8.1, 9.6%), 1,8-cineole (2, 1.7%), and beta-pinene (1.31, 2%), respectively. Antifungal activities of the oils were studied with special reference to the inhibition of Aspergillus parasiticus growth and aflatoxin production. Minimal inhibitory (MIC) and minimal fungicidal (MFC) concentrations of the oils were determined. Static effects of the above oils against A. parasiticus were at 250 ppm and lethal effects of T. eriocalyx and T. X-porlock were 500 and 1000 ppm of the oils, respectively. Aflatoxin production was inhibited at 250 ppm of both oils with that of T. eriocalyx being stronger inhibitor. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) of A. parasiticus exposed to MIC level (250 ppm) of the oils showed irreversible damage to cell wall, cell membrane, and cellular organelles. It is concluded that the essential oils could be safely used as preservative materials on some kinds of foods at low concentrations to protect them from fungal infections.",M3
16318274,"Effects of <e>Thymus</e> vulgaris L. as feed additive in piglets and against haemolytic E. coli in vitro.The aim of the study was to test Thymi herba (1.66% v/w essential oil with 39% p-cymene and 32% thymol) in the rearing period of piglets as feed additive. Therefore, two feeding trials were performed with piglet groups ranging from 17 to 22 animals each. Either 10 g of Thymi herba/kg feed (Thymi herba group), 10 mg flavophospholipol/kg feed (flavophospholipol group) or nothing (control group) was added to the animals' feed. No significant differences in the performance parameter daily weight gain among any groups were recorded. No differences concerning feed efficiency or isolation of haemolytic E. coli serotypes were shown. In addition, the antibacterial activity of the essential oil of Thymi herba against 39 haemolytic E. coli isolates from the same weaners was investigated in vitro by disk diffusion, minimum inhibitory concentration and bactericidal concentration testing. In contrast to the feeding results, the essential oil of the thyme batch fed showed antibacterial activity against all haemolytic E. coli investigated. This interesting antibacterial potential of Thymi herba prompts further investigations as to its value as feed additive.",M3
16224707,"A chemical polymorphism in a multitrophic setting: thyme monoterpene composition and food web structure.We investigated the effects of chemical variation in thyme (<e>Thymus</e> vulgaris L.) on its interactions with competitors, herbivores, and herbivore predators. Four different thyme monoterpene phenotypes (chemotypes) were grown in a 4x2x2 factorial of chemotype, caging (sham half-cages vs. full cages), and competition (control vs. the grass Bromus madritensis L.). Cages reduced numbers of arthropod predators. Thyme-feeding aphids Aphis serpylli Koch passed through full cage walls to increase more than fourfold. As a result, freed from their predators, aphids had a large negative effect on thyme size and flowering. Similarly, competition from Bromus had a negative effect on thyme size and flowering. Individual effects of aphids and competition were nonadditive, however, and their combined effect was significantly less than that predicted by a multiplicative null model. Differential thyme sizes among chemotypes were not mediated by herbivores or competitors, but differential flowering was due to the effects of chemotype on aphids. We thus document differential selection by aphids among thyme chemotypes and the influence of Bromus on the strength of these negative effects of aphids.",M3

Notably, the essential oil fraction of T. magnus and its main components displayed significant inhibitory action against both antibiotic-susceptible and resistant strains of S. pneumoniae, S. aureus, and S. typhimurium with minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) ranging from 0.125 to 8 mg/mL. The differential MIC values imply that the oil fraction and its main components exhibit distinct patterns of activity against the tested bacterial species. Moreover, the disk diffusion test revealed that the inhibitory activities of oil fraction and components were dose-dependent. Data from the checkerboard titer test confirmed synergism between the antibiotic, norfloxacin, and T. magnus oil or thymol, particularly against the resistant strains of S. aureus.",M3
16216455,"Preliminary study on immunological and behavioural effects of <e>Thymus</e> broussonetii Boiss., an endemic species in Morocco.In the present work, we had tried to evaluate the immunotropic and behavioural effects of Thymus broussonetii Boiss. So, we tested the neurostimulant effects of four extracts. This preliminary study allowed to identify both the immunostimulant and the neurotropic antistress effects of the studied extracts. Among the four extracts, only the aqueous and ethyl acetate ones showed an apparent effect on the tested biological activities, whereas the butanolic extract and the essential oil did not show any interesting effect (data not shown). These results showed that the aqueous and ethyl extracts of this endemic species are of interest for two reasons: stimulation of the immunizing system and protection against the stress by a neurotropic activity. Thyme extracts increased in vivo the number of leucocyte categories studied including polynuclears, total lymphocytes, TCD4+, TCD8+ and NK cells. These data suggest that the intraperitoneal administration of Thymus broussonetii extract has a potent direct effect on leucocytes in vivo. The elevation of leucocyte and thrombocyte counts produced by thyme in the peripheral blood was already reported in the literature. These results could be of practical importance in the field of phytotherapy in the treatment of some cases of human immunodeficiency such as cancer, leukaemia and AIDS.",M3
16117610,"Thyme (<e>Thymus</e> vulgaris L.) leaves and its constituents increase the activities of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes in mouse liver.The effects of thyme (Thymus vulgaris L.) leaves and its phenolic compounds, thymol and carvacrol, on the activities of xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes, i.e., phase I enzymes such as 7-ethoxycoumarin O-deethylase (ECOD) and phase II enzymes such as glutathione S-transferase (GST) and quinone reductase (QR), were investigated. Mice were fed with a diet containing thyme (0.5% or 2.0%) or treated orally with thymol (50-200 mg/kg) or carvacrol (50-200 mg/kg) once a day for 7 successive days, and then the enzyme activities in the livers were analyzed. Dietary administration of 2% thyme caused slightly but significantly higher ECOD, GST, and QR activities by 1.1-1.4-fold. Thymol (200 mg/kg) treatment resulted in significantly higher ECOD, GST, and QR activities by 1.3-1.9-fold, and carvacrol (200 mg/kg) treatment caused significantly higher ECOD, GST, and QR activities by 1.3-1.7-fold. Thymol-treated animals had significantly higher protein levels of GST alpha and GST micro, and carvacrol-treated animals had significantly higher levels of GST micro. These results imply that thyme contains bifunctional inducers (i.e., substances capable of inducing both phase I and phase II enzymes) and that thymol and carvacrol may account for the effects of thyme.",M3

METHODS: Ethyl acetate, n-butanol and acetone fractions were separated from the ethanol extracts of wild Thymus quinquecostatus Celak. Growth inhibiting effects of these extracts on human leukemia cell lines K562 and HL-60 were determined by live cell counting and cell growth curve analysis. The possible anti-tumor mechanism was studied by morphological analysis with norcantharidin as a positive control. RESULTS: Ethyl acetate fraction could significantly inhibit the proliferations of K562 and HL-60 cells, and the inhibiting effect depended on the concentration of ethyl acetate fraction. Ethyl acetate fraction could induce apoptosis of K562 and HL-60 cells. The n-butanol and acetone fractions had no significant inhibiting effect on K562 and HL-60 cells. CONCLUSION: Ethyl acetate fraction is the major anti-tumor fraction in ethanol extracts from Thymus quinquecostatus Celak.",M3

In general, fennel oil extracted by SDE and SFE showed similar compositions, with trans-anethole, estragole, and fenchone as the main components. In contrast, thymol and p-cymene, the most abundant compounds in thyme leaves, showed big differences, with generally higher amounts of monoterpenes obtained by SDE. However, in this case, the differences between the extracts were higher. Key odorants of fennel seeds determined by gas chromatography-olfactometry (GC-O) showed similar patterns when applying SDE and SFE. trans-Anethole (anise, licorice), estragole (anise, licorice, sweet), fenchone (mint, camphor, warm), and 1-octen-3-ol (mushroom) were the most intense odor compounds detected in fennel extracts.

Freeze-dried samples extracted in methanol (free or unconjugated polyphenol) and in 1.2 M hydrochloric acid (HCl) in methanol (total antioxidant that is both unconjugated and conjugated) were analyzed using two different antioxidant assay methods [Folin-Ciocalteu reagent (Folin) and the ferric reducing antioxidant power (FRAP)]. The 1.2 M HCl in methanol extracts had significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) antioxidant capacities than the methanolic extract. Generally, the FRAP antioxidant values were significantly (P &lt; 0.001) higher than the Folin antioxidant values. Although a significant correlation (P &lt; 0.05) was obtained between the Folin phenol and the FRAP antioxidant, the trends of the antioxidant capacity of the samples were different for the Folin and FRAP methods. The leaves of the Piper species top the total antioxidant tables in both Folin and FRAP assay methods, respectively. Irvingia gabonensis tops the FRAP free antioxidant list, while Piper umbellatum leads the Folin free antioxidant followed by <e>Thymus</e> vulgaris.

All 5 monoterpenes effectively repelled mosquitoes based on a human forearm bioassay. Alpha-terpinene and carvacrol showed significantly greater repellency than a commercial formulation, N,N-diethyl-m-methylbenzamide (deet), whereas thymol showed similar repellency to that of deet. The duration of repellency after application for all these monoterpenes was equal to or higher than that of deet. These findings indicate that a spray-type solution containing 2% alpha-terpinene may serve as an alternative mosquito repellent.",M3

Merril and Perry, Origanum vulgare L., Rosmarinus officinalis L. and six chemotypes of Thymus vulgaris L. on Candida albicans growth were studied. The most efficiency was obtained with the essential oil from Thymus vulgaris thymol chemotype (MIC 80% = 0.016 microL/mL and Kaff = 296 microL/mL). The presence in the culture medium of essential oil from Thymus vulgaris thymol chemotype (0.01, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 microg/mL) and amphotericin B involved a decrease of the MIC 80% of amphotericin B. In contrast, the combination of amphotericin B and low concentrations (0.00031-0.0025 microg/mL) of essential oil was antagonistic. The strongest decrease (48%) of the MIC 80% was obtained with medium containing 0.2 microL/mL of essential oil.

In the present study the genotoxic potential of major compounds of thyme oil, i.e. thymol, carvacrol, and gamma-terpinene and of the methanolic extracts of thyme, were investigated in human lymphocytes by single-cell gel electrophoresis. Also, the effects of these substances on the induction of DNA damage by 2-amino-3-methylimidazo[4,5-f]-quinoline (IQ) and mitomycin C (MMC) were evaluated. No increase in DNA strand breakage was observed at thymol and gamma-terpinene concentrations below 0.1 mM, but at the higher concentration of 0.2 mM significant increases in DNA damage were seen. Thymol and gamma-terpinene significantly reduced the DNA strand breakage induced by IQ and MMC at the lower concentrations studied. Carvacrol, which is an isomer of thymol, seemed to protect lymphocytes from the genotoxic effects of IQ and MMC at non-toxic concentrations below 0.05 mM, but at the higher concentration of 0.1 mM carvacrol itself induced DNA damage. Also the constituents of the n-hexane and ethyl acetate fractions prepared from the concentrated aqueous methanolic extracts of <e>Thymus</e> spicata protected lymphocytes against IQ- and MMC-induced DNA damage in a concentration-dependent manner.",M3
15729828,"Towards gas chromatography-mass spectrometry coupling protocols for both identifying and quantification essential oils of <e>Thymus</e> capitatus Hoff et Link.Essential oil of Thymus capitatus Hoff et Link is analysed by using four techniques: GC/pyrolyse/MS, GC/FID, electronic impact GC/MS (quadripole), and GC/MS (ion trap). Both major and trace components are analysed. The GC/pyrolyse/MS coupling provides reference to the exact mass compositions without any need of the previously purified references, neither for major or trace components. The comparison between this reference analysis and GC/FID shows that the FID response coefficients may vary by a mean 7% from one component to another. As it was expected, quadripole or ion trap response coefficients vary to a much greater extent (a mean 25%), although the two MS techniques response coefficients are first order consistent. We conclude that GC/MS coupling could be used not only as it is usual for reliable identifications, but also for a complete quantitative routine analysis of essential oils. Expected precision could be very similar to GC/FID precision provided correcting species by species the MS analysis by a mean value of the response coefficient measured for the MS 70 eV electronic impact ionisation technologies.

The method correlates the Raman peak intensity in the spectral region from 1800 to 600 cm(-1) and the concentration percentage of each particular constituent in the sample. To achieve accurate quantification results and avoid the risk of overlapping peaks of unknown Raman-active substances in natural essential oils, the peaks must be analyzed. For this purpose, PEAKSOLVE software (Ver. 1.0.5) was used. Unknown samples were measured with the FT-Raman method, and the results were compared to those of the gas chromatographic (GC) analysis. The comparison was made at a confidence level of 99%, and the two methods scored equally in terms of repeatability and accuracy even at the edge of the method specifications. The new method can provide accurate results in very short times once the setup is complete and could be utilized in areas where vast amounts of samples must be analyzed.",M3

The analytical data indicated that various monoterpene hydrocarbons and phenolic monoterpenes constitute the major components of the oils, but their concentrations varied greatly among the oils examined. The antibacterial assay results showed that 5 muL doses of the essential oils extracted from the endemic Satureja species in Greece possess remarkable bactericidal properties, which are clearly superior as compared to those of Origanum and Thymus species essential oils.

The ability of selected EO to permeabilize the cytoplasmic membrane of L. innocua was also examined. METHODS AND RESULTS: The antibacterial activity of the EO determined by the agar diffusion method showed that T. vulgaris had the highest activity followed by O. gratissimum and C. citratus. Lowest activity was recorded from Z. officinale and O. basilicum. Significant differences in sensitivity between strains of Listeria and S. aureus were observed. Flow cytometry of L. innocua stained with carboxy-fluorescein diacetate showed that the fluorescence intensity of cells exposed to EO decreased faster than nonexposed cells, indicating that EO permeabilized the cytoplasmic membrane with the leakage of carboxy-fluorescein. CONCLUSIONS: Almost all the EO tested showed antibacterial activity to a different extent. The antibacterial effect was due to permeabilization of the cytoplasmic membrane. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: This study has identified the preservative potential of the EO examined. The use of sensitive method, such as flow cytometry, is advantageous for quick generation of data on the antibacterial effect of EO.",M3

The most common complaints were: blocking of the nose (reported by 18 farmers--38.3%), dry cough (14 persons--29.8%) and general weakness (13 persons--27.7%). The mean spirometric values in the farmers group were within a normal range and did not show a significant post-work decline. The farmers showed positive skin reactions to microbial antigens in the range of 4.3-14.9%, and a frequency of positive precipitin reactions 0-56.5%. The reference group responded to most allergens with a significantly lower frequency of positive results compared to the examined group. In conclusion, thyme farmers engaged in threshing this herb represent a group of elevated professional risk because of high incidence of work-related symptoms and common occurrence of positive skin and precipitin reactions to bacterial and fungal allergens associated with organic dust.",M3
15299985,"[Improvement of diversity, trade and conservation of medicinal and aromatic plants]The significance of medicinal and aromatic plant selection has risen in recent years due to increasing requirements on quality, safety, and efficiency of herbal products. Only selected varieties could guaranty the homogeneity of raw material. The chemical diversity of spontaneous populations is one of the main directions of investigations on medicinal and aromatic plants at the Institute of Botany. The target species under research are following: Origanum vulgare, <e>Thymus</e> spp., Hypericum spp., Achillea millefolium, and Helichrysum arenarium. The analysis of trade figures pointed out that the imported raw material mainly supplies the demands of pharmaceutical industry in Lithuania. The cultivated production covers only 4-6% of the demand for raw material. Wild plant material represents about 29% of total volume used in pharmaceutics. The trade in wild plant species and their resources is regulated by the legislations. In situ and ex situ conservation methods are used to avoid potential danger and existing threats to genetic diversity of medicinal plant species.",M3
15300002,"Content and composition of the essential oil of <e>Thymus</e> serpyllum L. growing wild in Estonia.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this work was to analyze the essential oil content and its composition in the drug (Serpylli herba) of wild thyme (Thymus serpyllum L.) originating from 20 different natural places of growth in Estonia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The quantitative content of essential oil was determined according to the method of European Pharmacopoeia. Gas chromatographic analysis of essential oils was carried out using a gas chromatography with flame ionization detector on two fused silica capillary columns with bonded stationary phases NB-30 and SW-10. The identification of the oil components was accomplished by comparing their retention indices on two columns with the retention indices values of standard compounds, with our retention indices data bank and with literature data. The results obtained were confirmed by gas chromatography / mass spectrometry. RESULTS: The content of essential oil is between 0.6 and 4 ml/kg and usually is not in conformity with European Pharmacopoeia standard (3 ml/kg). There were 55 components identified in the essential oil of wild thyme of Estonian origin. Differently from the data in the literature of foreign countries, thymol and carvacrol are not the main components of the essential oil of wild thyme growing in Estonia. The main components here are (E)-nerolidol, caryophyllene oxide, myrcene, (E)-beta-caryophyllene and germacrene D. CONCLUSION: In Estonia, the (E)-nerolidol-caryophyllene oxide, (E)-nerolidol-myrcene and myrcene chemotypes of wild thyme drug are distinguishable.",M3

15005885,"In-vitro anti-inflammatory effect of Eucalyptus globulus and <e>Thymus</e> vulgaris: nitric oxide inhibition in J774A.1 murine macrophages.It is well known that nitric oxide (NO) plays an important role in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases. Eucalyptus globulus Labill. and Thymus vulgaris L. have been used in traditional medicine in the treatment of bronchitis, asthma and other respiratory diseases. The present study focuses on the effects of these two extracts on NO production induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in the murine macrophage cell line J774A.1. In addition, cell viability, scavenging activity and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) mRNA expression were evaluated. E. globulus and T. vulgaris extracts significantly inhibited the enhanced production of NO induced by LPS and IFN-gamma in a dose-dependent manner. Treatment with these two extracts did not reduce cell viability at any dose used. Both plant extracts showed significant scavenging of NO radicals released by an NO donor, PAPA-NONOate. Results also show that pre-treatment with E. globulus and T. vulgaris extracts significantly inhibits iNOS mRNA expression. This study thus suggests that the inhibition of net NO production by these two extracts may be due to their NO scavenging activity and/or their inhibitory effects on iNOS gene expression.",M3
14610426,"Role of <e>thymus</e> oil in burn wound healing.Thymus oil and its components are becoming increasingly popular as naturally occurring antimicrobial and antioxidant agents. The real importance of thymus on nitric oxide (NO) is unknown. NO is an important mediator in numerous physiologic and pathophysiologic events. Stasis and thrombosis in burn wound can progress as a result of the release of local mediators. The implication of NO in burn injury is not well studied. In this study, we tried to determine the role of burn-induced NO and whether thymus oil plays a protective role after a thermal injury. Rats were divided into five groups. We topically applied thymus oil, olive oil, and silverdin and sulfadiazine on the rats, respectively, during a period of 21 days after they were burned while under anesthesia. The burned control group and nonburned control group did not receive any treatment. The results of this study show that NO was overproduced by thermal injury and decreased during the days after burn injury. The decrease in rats treated with thymus and sulfadiazine was higher than the others. These data indicate that thymus oil may serve as a protective agent to the damaged tissues by decreasing the NO level. Histologic examination results show that the formation of new tissue in rats receiving thymus oil was more than other burned groups, and this finding supports our hypothesis.",M3
14518938,"Essential oils from Mediterranean lamiaceae as weed germination inhibitors.The essential oils obtained from rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), thyme (<e>Thymus</e> vulgaris L.), and savory (Satureja montana L.) and the four monoterpenes that are their major constituents have been analyzed by GC and GC-MS and tested for their allelopathic properties on the seeds of three different annual weeds (Chenopodium album, Portulaca oleracea, and Echinochloa crus-galli) and three crops (Raphanus sativus, Capsicum annuum, and Lactuca sativa), with the aim to evaluate in vitro their potential as germination inhibitors. The essential oil composition varied with the species, thymol being the main constituent (44%) of thyme and carvacrol (57%) that of savory oil. Differences in essential oil composition were observed within two different rosemary ecotypes, type A, with alpha-pinene (37%) and 1,8-cineole (23%), and type B, characterized by a 2-fold content of 1,8-cineole (47%). This latest essential oil inhibited completely the germination of weeds while concurrently displaying little effect on pepper. The other two oils showed less selective action. S. montana essential oil, with 57% carvacrol, is the most active compound, completely inhibiting germination both of crops and weeds. Borneol, one of the main constituents of the oil of rosemary type B, showed an activity comparable to that of the whole oil. Crop and weed seeds treated with 1,8-cineole showed germination values that were not significantly different from controls, even if a slowing of the germination process expressed in terms of a significant increase in mean germination time was observed. Monoterpene compounds also present in the essential oils mainly represented the volatile fraction released from the crops and their residues into the soil.",M3
12926892,"Watering level effect on <e>Thymus</e> hyemalis Lange essential oil yield and composition.Thymus hyemalis Lange (chemotype thymol) was cultivated as an experimental crop under different watering level conditions in order to achieve 80, 60, 40, and 20% of the local potential evapotranspiration (Eto). Two harvesting periods were considered, winter and spring. As a consequence of the great variability among plants, essential oil yield percentages did not show statistically significant differences among seasons and different levels of water supply. Capillary GC-MS analysis of the essential oils permitted the detection of 84 volatile components. Among them, 54 are described for the first time as volatile constituents of the chromatographic profile of this Thymus species. Winter harvesting showed high concentrations in thymol percentage (25.92 +/- 4.39), the 40% Eto watering level being the best with respect to obtaining the optimum quality of this essential oil. However, in spring this thyme species needs a greater water supply (80% Eto) to achieve the same amount of thymol in the essential oil (29.20 +/- 2.83). From this, it was concluded that winter harvesting could be used for the extraction of the essential oil, with a low level of water supply, whereas spring harvesting could be employed for collection of leaves as a food condiment.",M3
