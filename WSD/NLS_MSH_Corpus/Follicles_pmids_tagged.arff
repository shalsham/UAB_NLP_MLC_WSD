20437767,"Quantitative PCR of Propionibacterium acnes DNA in samples aspirated from sebaceous <e>follicles</e> on the normal skin of subjects with or without acne.To elucidate whether people with hair follicles containing many Propionibacterium acnes cells are prone to acne, we developed a novel method to count the number of P. acnes in hair follicles. We sampled sebaceous material in hair follicles by aspiration at a constant negative pressure from the nose, forehead, and upper arm of 86 patients with acne vulgaris and 209 control subjects with healthy skin, including 84 subjects age-matched to the patients. Genome-equivalents of P. acnes in samples were estimated by real-time quantitative PCR (TaqMan). Numbers of P. acnes genome-equivalents were extremely low in control subjects less than 10 years of age and generally higher at greater ages, with much variation in subjects in the same decade of life. In men, the median count was highest in controls aged 15-19 years; in women, it peaked twice, in controls aged 15-19 years and again in those aged 40 years or older. P. acnes counts on the forehead and nose were higher in the acne patients aged 10-14 years than in the age-matched controls in both sexes. The counts at three sites were similar in acne patients and controls aged 15 to 29 years in both sexes. The results suggest that people with hair follicles containing many P. acnes cells are not particularly prone to acne, except for younger teenagers. Our aspiration method with estimation by real-time PCR can be used to examine the cutaneous microflora of P. acnes.",M1
20429299,"[Cultivated human hair follicle cells are capable of integrating to skin structure in vivo]In the present study, human keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells were labeled to investigate their behaviour after intradermal transplantation. Cells were transduced by lentiviral vectors that bore marker gene encoding green fluorescent protein (copGFP) or red fluorescent protein (DsRed). A portion of transgene expressing cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Genetic constructions that we used provided high level (&gt; 95 %) of transduction of hair follicle cells. In vitro transduced cells were injected under the epidermis of human skin fragments, and these fragments were then transplanted under the skin of immunodeficient mice. Injected epidermal keratinocytes were found, mainly, in hair <e>follicles</e> and partially in a zone of interfollicular epidermis, while dermal papilla cells were found in papilla derma. The results of the present research show that the chosen genetic constructions obtained on a basis of human immunodeficiency lentivirs are capable of effective and stable transduction of human skin cells. Injected cells survived and were found in the corresponding structures of the skin.",M1
20417836,"Leucine-rich repeat-containing G-protein-coupled receptors as markers of adult stem cells.Molecular markers are used to characterize and track adult stem cells. Colon cancer research has led to the identification of 2 related receptors, leucine-rich repeat-containing, G-protein-coupled receptors (Lgr)5 and Lgr6, that are expressed by small populations of cells in a variety of adult organs. Genetic mouse models have allowed the visualization, isolation, and genetic marking of Lgr5(+ve) and Lgr6(+ve) cells and provided evidence that they are stem cells. The Lgr5(+ve) cells were found to occupy locations not commonly associated with stem cells in the stomach, small intestine, colon, and hair <e>follicles</e>. A multipotent population of skin stem cells express Lgr6. Single Lgr5(+ve) stem cells from the small intestine and the stomach can be cultured into long-lived organoids. Further studies of these markers might reveal adult stem cell populations in additional tissues. Identification of the ligands for Lgr5 and 6 will help elucidate stem cell functions and modes of intracellular signaling.",M1
20412777,"beta-catenin activity in the dermal papilla regulates morphogenesis and regeneration of hair.The activity of keratinocytes in the hair follicle is regulated by signals from a specialized mesenchymal niche, the dermal papilla (DP). Here, mice expressing cre recombinase in the DP were developed to probe the interaction between follicular keratinocytes and the DP in vivo. Inactivation of the beta-catenin gene within DP of fully developed hair <e>follicles</e> results in dramatically reduced proliferation of the progenitors and their progeny that generate the hair shaft, and, subsequently, premature induction of the destructive phase of the hair cycle. It also prevents regeneration of the cycling follicle from stem cells. Gene expression analysis reveals that beta-catenin activity in the DP regulates signaling pathways, including FGF and IGF, that can mediate the DP's inductive effects. This study reveals a signaling loop that employs Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in both epithelial progenitor cells and their mesenchymal niche to govern and coordinate the interactions between these compartments to guide hair morphogenesis.",M1
20393562,"APCDD1 is a novel Wnt inhibitor mutated in hereditary hypotrichosis simplex.Hereditary hypotrichosis simplex is a rare autosomal dominant form of hair loss characterized by hair follicle miniaturization. Using genetic linkage analysis, we mapped a new locus for the disease to chromosome 18p11.22, and identified a mutation (Leu9Arg) in the adenomatosis polyposis down-regulated 1 (APCDD1) gene in three families. We show that APCDD1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed in human hair <e>follicles</e>, and can interact in vitro with WNT3A and LRP5-two essential components of Wnt signalling. Functional studies show that APCDD1 inhibits Wnt signalling in a cell-autonomous manner and functions upstream of beta-catenin. Moreover, APCDD1 represses activation of Wnt reporters and target genes, and inhibits the biological effects of Wnt signalling during both the generation of neurons from progenitors in the developing chick nervous system, and axis specification in Xenopus laevis embryos. The mutation Leu9Arg is located in the signal peptide of APCDD1, and perturbs its translational processing from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. APCDD1(L9R) probably functions in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit the stability and membrane localization of the wild-type protein. These findings describe a novel inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway with an essential role in human hair growth. As APCDD1 is expressed in a broad repertoire of cell types, our findings indicate that APCDD1 may regulate a diversity of biological processes controlled by Wnt signalling.",M1
20393474,"Human hair <e>follicles</e>:  bulging  with neural crest-like stem cells.Several studies have reported the existence of precursor cells residing within various adult tissues that appear to either retain or recapitulate features of neural crest stem cells (NCSCs). In rodents, unique populations of both epidermal and dermal cells, resident within hair follicles, exhibit such characteristics, although the existence of equivalent NCSC-like cells in human tissues has remained uncertain. In this issue, Yu et al. show that NCSC-like cells also reside within the bulge region of adult human hair follicles.",M1
20335364,"Abnormal hair follicle development and altered cell fate of follicular keratinocytes in transgenic mice expressing DeltaNp63alpha.The transcription factor p63 plays an essential role in epidermal morphogenesis. Animals lacking p63 fail to form many ectodermal organs, including the skin and hair <e>follicles</e>. Although the indispensable role of p63 in stratified epithelial skin development is well established, relatively little is known about this transcriptional regulator in directing hair follicle morphogenesis. Here, using specific antibodies, we have established the expression pattern of DeltaNp63 in hair follicle development and cycling. DeltaNp63 is expressed in the developing hair placode, whereas in mature hair its expression is restricted to the outer root sheath (ORS), matrix cells and to the stem cells of the hair follicle bulge. To investigate the role of DeltaNp63 in hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling, we have utilized a Tet-inducible mouse model system with targeted expression of this isoform to the ORS of the hair follicle. DeltaNp63 transgenic animals display dramatic defects in hair follicle development and cycling, eventually leading to severe hair loss. Strikingly, expression of DeltaNp63 leads to a switch in cell fate of hair follicle keratinocytes, causing them to adopt an interfollicular epidermal (IFE) cell identity. Moreover, DeltaNp63 transgenic animals exhibit a depleted hair follicle stem-cell niche, which further contributes to the overall cycling defects observed in the mutant animals. Finally, global transcriptome analysis of transgenic skin identified altered expression levels of crucial mediators of hair morphogenesis, including key members of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which, in part, account for these effects. Our data provide evidence supporting a role for DeltaNp63alpha in actively suppressing hair follicle differentiation and directing IFE cell lineage commitment.",M1
20302576,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone and oestrogen differentially regulate prolactin and prolactin receptor expression in female human skin and hair <e>follicles</e> in vitro.BACKGROUND: Human skin and scalp hair follicles are both a nonclassical target and an extrapituitary source of prolactin (PRL), which is a potent hair growth modulator. However, how the expression of PRL and PRL receptor (PRLR) is regulated in human skin is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether two key stimulators of pituitary PRL secretion, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and oestrogen, also regulate cutaneous PRL and PRLR expression. METHODS: Female scalp skin and/or microdissected hair follicles were treated for 6 days in serum-free organ culture with oestrogen (100 nmol L(-1)), TRH (1-10 ng mL(-1), 3-30 nm) or vehicle control. Quantitative immunohistomorphometry of skin and hair follicle sections was complemented with quantitative polymerase chain reaction for PRL and PRLR in cultured hair follicles and/or female human outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes. RESULTS: Oestrogen treatment significantly upregulated PRL and PRLR immunoreactivity in selected skin and hair follicle compartments, at the gene and protein level (P &lt; 0.05). TRH significantly increased PRL immunoreactivity and transcription in hair follicles (P &lt; 0.05); however, while it also increased PRLR transcription in hair follicles, it downregulated PRLR immunoreactivity in the hair follicle ORS (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study shows that two key endocrine controls of pituitary PRL secretion, oestrogen and TRH, also regulate PRL and PRLR expression in human skin. This provides novel insights into the regulation of extrapituitary PRL and PRLR expression, and invites exploration of oestrogen and TRH as novel therapeutic agents in the management of skin and hair diseases characterized by aberrant PRLR-mediated signalling.",M1
20300578,"Cytokines and other mediators in alopecia areata.Alopecia areata, a disease of the hair <e>follicles</e> with multifactorial etiology and a strong component of autoimmune origin, has been extensively studied as far as the role of several cytokines is concerned. So far, IFN-gamma, interleukins, TNF-alpha, are cytokines that are well known to play a major role in the pathogenesis of the disease, while several studies have shown that many more pathways exist. Among them, MIG, IP-10, BAFF, HLA antigens, MIG, as well as stress hormones are implicated in disease onset and activity. Within the scope of this paper, the authors attempt to shed light upon the complexity of alopecia areata underlying mechanisms and indicate pathways that may suggest future treatments.",M1
20229054,"Differential expression of stem cell markers in human follicular bulge and interfollicular epidermal compartments.Although skin contains a number of stem cell repositories, their characterization has been hindered by a lack of specific markers and an unclear in vivo localization. In this study, we whole mounted single human scalp hair <e>follicles</e> and examined their profiles using in situ immunohistochemistry and multicolor immunofluorescence in search of markers to distinguish between stem cells residing in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and bulge. Our study revealed that expression of several biomarkers localized uniquely to the basal IFE (CD34 and CD117), bulge region (CD200), or both (CK15, CD49f, and CD29). In addition, we found that both basal IFE and bulge stem cells did not express CD71 or CD24 suggesting their potential utility as negative selection markers. Dermal papilla but not basal IFE or bulge stem cells expressed CD90, making it a potential positive selection marker for dermal hair follicle stem cells. The markers tested in this study may enable pursuit of cell sorting and purification strategies aimed at determining each stem cell population's unique molecular signature.",M1
20226633,"Spatial and temporal control of laminin-511 and -332 expressions during catagen.BACKGROUND: We recently reported that the basement membrane (BM) zone components laminin-511 and -332 precisely regulate hair growth spatially and temporally during the anagen stage of the hair cycle. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined the localization and roles of laminin-511 and -332 during catagen in mice. METHODS: Using tissue from C57BL/6 hair depilation model mice, we performed immunohistochemistry, in situ hybridization, western blotting, and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) studies. RESULTS: Although the distribution of laminin-332 around the BM of lower hair <e>follicles</e> changed during catagen, its total expression was stable throughout catagen stages at both the mRNA and protein levels. In sharp contrast, in situ hybridization, western blotting, and QRT-PCR studies of laminin alpha 5 showed that laminin-511 expression was gradually downregulated. Moreover, while the injection of recombinant laminin-332 at anagen stage VI did not affect catagen progression, injection of a laminin-511-rich A549 cell conditioned media protein extract at anagen stage VI delayed progression of catagen. CONCLUSION: These results indicated that downregulation of laminin-511 is important for hair regression.",M1
20223988,"Lgr6 marks stem cells in the hair follicle that generate all cell lineages of the skin.Mammalian epidermis consists of three self-renewing compartments: the hair follicle, the sebaceous gland, and the interfollicular epidermis. We generated knock-in alleles of murine Lgr6, a close relative of the Lgr5 stem cell gene. Lgr6 was expressed in the earliest embryonic hair placodes. In adult hair <e>follicles</e>, Lgr6+ cells resided in a previously uncharacterized region directly above the follicle bulge. They expressed none of the known bulge stem cell markers. Prenatal Lgr6+ cells established the hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and interfollicular epidermis. Postnatally, Lgr6+ cells generated sebaceous gland and interfollicular epidermis, whereas contribution to hair lineages gradually diminished with age. Adult Lgr6+ cells executed long-term wound repair, including the formation of new hair follicles. We conclude that Lgr6 marks the most primitive epidermal stem cell.",M1
20211547,"Laminin-511, inducer of hair growth, is down-regulated and its suppressor in hair growth, laminin-332 up-regulated in chemotherapy-induced alopecia.BACKGROUND: Chemotherapy-induced alopecia (CIA) has a devastating cosmetic effect, especially in the young. Recent data indicate that two major basement membrane components (laminin-332 and -511) of the skin have opposing effects on hair growth. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we examined the role and localization of laminin-332 and -511 in CIA. METHODS: We examined the expression of laminin-332 and -511 during the dystrophic catagen form of CIA induced in C57BL/6 mice by cyclophosphamide (CYP) treatment. RESULTS: Our data indicate that both laminin-332 and its receptor alpha 6 beta 4 integrin are up-regulated (both quantitatively and spatially) after mid to late dystrophic catagen around the outer root sheath (ORS) in the lower third of hair <e>follicles</e> in CIA. This up-regulation also occurs at the transcriptional level. In contrast, laminin-511 is down-regulated after mid dystrophic catagen at the protein level, with transcriptional inactivation of laminin-511 occurring transiently at the early dystrophic catagen stage in both epidermal and ORS keratinocytes. Laminin-511 expression correlates with expression of alpha 3 integrin in CIA and we also demonstrate that laminin-511 can up-regulate the activity of the alpha 3 integrin promoter in cultured keratinocytes. Injection of a laminin-511 rich protein extract, but not recombinant laminin-332, in the back skin of mice delays hair loss in CYP-induced CIA. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that abrupt hair loss in CIA is, at least in part, caused by down-regulation of laminin-511 and up-regulation of laminin-332 at the transcriptional and translational levels.",M1
20206225,"Hair growth promoting effect of Zizyphus jujuba essential oil.This study was undertaken to examine the efficacy of essential oil from seeds of Zizyphus jujuba for its potential role on hair growth by in vivo method. Essential oil was applied at different concentrations (0.1%, 1% and 10%) over the shaved skin onto the backs of BALB/c mice and monitored for 21 days. After 21 days, mice treated with 1% and 10% of oil produced a greater effect on the length of hair which were measured to be 9.96 and 10.02 mm, respectively, as compared to the control (8.94 mm). We measured the weight of hair/cm(2) area of dorsal skin and also evaluated hair thickness and hair <e>follicles</e> microscopically after plucking the hair immediately from the shaved area of mice and found the best results for 1% of essential oil-treated mice. From this study, it is concluded that Z. jujuba essential oil possesses hair growth promoting activity.",M1
20203417,"Hair growth stimulated by conditioned medium of adipose-derived stem cells is enhanced by hypoxia: evidence of increased growth factor secretion.Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and their secretomes mediate diverse skin-regeneration effects, such as wound-healing and antioxidant protection, that are enhanced by hypoxia. We investigated the hair-growth-promoting effect of conditioned medium (CM) of ADSCs to determine if ADSCs and their secretomes regenerate hair and if hypoxia enhances hair regeneration. If so, we wanted to identify the factors responsible for hypoxia-enhanced hair-regeneration. We found that ADSC-CM administrated subcutaneously induced the anagen phase and increased hair regeneration in C(3)H/NeH mice. In addition, ADSC-CM increased the proliferation of human follicle dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and human epithelial keratinocytes (HEKs), which are derived from two major cell types present in hair <e>follicles</e>. We investigated the effect of hypoxia on ADSC function using the same animal model in which hypoxia increased hair regrowth. Forty-one growth factors in ADSC-CM from cells cultured under hypoxic or normoxic conditions were analyzed. The secretion of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-1, IGFBP-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), M-CSF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly increased by hypoxia, while the secretion of epithelial growth factor production was decreased. It is reasonable to conclude that ADSCs promote hair growth via a paracrine mechanism that is enhanced by hypoxia.",M1
20178470,"Canine hair-follicle keratinocytes enriched with bulge cells have the highly proliferative characteristic of stem cells.Homeostasis of the epidermis and skin appendages is maintained by tissue-specific stem cells. In mice and humans, two populations of epithelial stem cells have been identified: one in the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis and another in the bulge area of hair <e>follicles</e>. However, our understanding of canine epithelial stem cells is extremely limited. In this study, in vitro colony-forming assays were performed to locate highly proliferative keratinocytes in canine skin. Their phenotypic resemblance to epithelial stem cells in other species was also assessed. When equal numbers of epidermal or hair-follicle keratinocytes were cultured, colonies derived from follicular keratinocytes were significantly larger both in total numbers and size, than those derived from epidermal keratinocytes. In addition, immunoreactivity for CD34, a putative bulge stem-cell marker in the mouse, was predominantly detected in follicular keratinocytes. Thus in dogs, follicular keratinocytes were distinct from epidermal keratinocytes in proliferative capacity and CD34 expression. Using microdissection, highly proliferative keratinocytes were located within the middle portion of hair follicles, including the bulge area. Immunohistochemical study revealed that keratin 15, an established marker of bulge stem cells in mice and humans, was also predominantly expressed in the canine bulge area. Flow cytometry analysis revealed high numbers of keratin-15-positive cells in the highly proliferative keratinocyte compartment. Of note, keratin 15(high) cells possessed the phenotypic characteristics of putative stem cells. This study represents the first in vitro identification and isolation of highly proliferative canine keratinocytes, which represent candidate epithelial stem cells.",M1
20172841,"Hair loss in elderly women.Hair loss in elderly women has been becoming a major topic in the daily practice of dermatology. Aging of hair <e>follicles</e> seems to affect hair growth and pigmentation, the molecular mechanisms of which remain to be elucidated. Further senile changes in physiology and immunity may influence the onset and course of hair diseases. Some preexisting diseases such as androgenetic alopecia usually worsen after menopause, while others, like discoid lupus erythematosus, may attenuate. Hormone surveying, especially with regard to internal androgen-producing tumors, is indicated in postmenopausal women with androgenetic alopecia of sudden exacerbation or with unusual manifestation or other virilizing signs. The prevalence of alopecia totalis and alopecia universalis appears to be much lower in postmenopausal ages as compared to earlier onset. Acute or chronic telogen effluvium is not uncommonly superimposed on androgenetic alopecia. Trichotillomania shows a marked female predominance in the senile age group with a higher rate of psychopathology. Worldwide, tinea capitis has been increasingly observed in postmenopausal women. Frontal fibrosing alopecia, giant cell arteritis and erosive pustular dermatosis involve mainly elder women leading to scarring alopecia. Alopecia induced by tumor metastasis to the scalp must be considered in women with underlying neoplasms, especially breast cancer. Overall, hair loss in postmenopausal women is often multifactorial and warrants a close inspection.",M1
20137756,"Infundibulomatosis: a case report with immunohistochemical study and literature review.Tumor of the follicular infundibulum was first described in 1961 by Mehregan and Butler in a patient presenting with multiple papules. It is more frequent, however, as an isolated lesion affecting mainly the face, neck, and upper trunk. Clinical presentation is variable, requiring histology for the diagnosis, which reveals typically a plate-like proliferation of keratinocytes in continuity with the epidermis and hair <e>follicles</e>; some morphological features are reminiscent of the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. A well defined network of elastic fibers surrounding the tumor is usually present using the appropriate staining and this finding is specific because it is not found in other benign follicular tumors. Multiple infundibulomas are usually sporadic and there is no apparent association with internal malignancy. The authors report the case of a 30-year-old female patient with a 5-year history of multiple small discrete hypopigmented macules and papules, scattered over the submental and submaxillary regions and anterior neck. Histopathological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of tumor of the follicular infundibulum. Immunohistochemical study was performed to further characterize the proliferation.",M1
20130590,"Expression of the orphan protein Plet-1 during trichilemmal differentiation of anagen hair <e>follicles</e>.The rat mAb 33A10 recognizes an antigen in a variety of mouse epithelial tissues. In this study, we investigated in detail the expression pattern of the 33A10-defined antigen in the hair follicle. We show that 33A10 reactivity is confined to the most differentiated keratinocytes of the outer root sheath (ORS), the companion layer (CL), and to cells of the sebaceous gland duct. In vitro, the 33A10-defined antigen is expressed in keratinocytes derived from the ORS and accumulates on induction of differentiation. Using microarray analysis and transient transfection approaches, we established that the 33A10-defined antigen is the orphan protein, Placenta-expressed transcript (Plet)-1. Biochemical data indicated that Plet-1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein with N-linked carbohydrates in addition to other posttranslational modifications. Although silencing of Plet-1 expression using stable RNA interference in ORS keratinocytes decreased cellular migration, it increased adhesion to collagens I and IV. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Plet-1 was primarily localized at the leading edge of epidermal wounds, where keratinocytes contacted the eschar. The restricted localization in both differentiated ORS and CL cells contacting the hair fiber and epidermal wounds suggests a role for the Plet-1 protein in regulating the interaction of keratinocytes with inert tissues.",M1
20103718,"Prolactin--a novel neuroendocrine regulator of human keratin expression in situ.The controls of human keratin expression in situ remain to be fully elucidated. Here, we have investigated the effects of the neurohormone prolactin (PRL) on keratin expression in a physiologically and clinically relevant test system: organ-cultured normal human hair <e>follicles</e> (HFs). Not only do HFs express a wide range of keratins, but they are also a source and target of PRL. Microarray analysis revealed that PRL differentially regulated a defined subset of keratins and keratin-associated proteins. Quantitative immunohistomorphometry and quantitative PCR confirmed that PRL up-regulated expression of keratins K5 and K14 and the epithelial stem cell-associated keratins K15 and K19 in organ-cultured HFs and/or isolated HF keratinocytes. PRL also up-regulated K15 promoter activity and K15 protein expression in situ, whereas it inhibited K6 and K31 expression. These regulatory effects were reversed by a pure competitive PRL receptor antagonist. Antagonist alone also modulated keratin expression, suggesting that  tonic stimulation  by endogenous PRL is required for normal expression levels of selected keratins. Therefore, our study identifies PRL as a major, clinically relevant, novel neuroendocrine regulator of both human keratin expression and human epithelial stem cell biology in situ.",M1
20090767,"Hair growth defects in Insig-deficient mice caused by cholesterol precursor accumulation and reversed by simvastatin.Insig-1 and Insig-2, two closely related proteins, are essential for feedback inhibition of cholesterol biosynthesis. Here, we characterized a line of epidermal-specific, Insig-double knockout (Epi-Insig-DKO) mice lacking both Insigs in epidermis. At birth, Epi-Insig-DKO mice were indistinguishable from control littermates, but thereafter they failed to thrive and died before 6 weeks of age. By 14 days of age, 100% of Epi-Insig-DKO mice exhibited defects in hair growth along with other skin abnormalities, including hyperkeratosis. Hair <e>follicles</e> in Epi-Insig-DKO mice developed normally through postnatal day 7, but they failed to progress to later stages and thus exhibited defects in postnatal hair cycling. Insig deficiency caused a marked buildup of cholesterol precursors in skin associated with a marked increase in 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase protein. Topical treatment of Epi-Insig-DKO mice with simvastatin, an inhibitor of reductase, reduced sterol precursors in skin and corrected the hair and skin defects. We conclude that Insig deficiency in skin causes accumulation of cholesterol precursors, and this impairs normal hair development. These findings have implications for several human genetic diseases in which mutations in cholesterol biosynthetic enzymes lead to accumulation of sterol precursors and multiple cutaneous abnormalities.",M1
20090408,"Which skin model is the most appropriate for the investigation of topically applied substances into the hair <e>follicles</e>?It has recently been demonstrated by the utilization of different techniques, such as differential stripping and laser scanning microscopy, that the hair follicles represent an efficient long-term reservoir for topically applied substances. In the present paper, the different in vivo techniques are compared to those of in vitro analysis. It was found that in vitro measurements on pig ear skin are highly superior for the analysis of follicular penetration, as compared to in vitro investigations on excised human skin, mainly due to the fact that the human skin contracts after removal. Restretching of the skin to its original size mainly stretches the interfollicular fibres, whereas the fibres around the hair follicles remain contracted. In contrast to excised human skin, pig ear tissue does not contract when the cartilage is not removed. Moreover, it has an intact barrier on both sides of the ear. Regardless of the fact that the hair follicles on pig ear skin are larger than those of humans, the porcine ear skin represents a more suitable in vitro model for the analysis of the penetration and storage of topically applied substances in the hair follicles than excised human skin.",M1
20060268,"Targeting to the hair <e>follicles</e>: current status and potential.The pilosebaceous unit is a complex structure that undergoes a specific growth cycle and comprises a few important drug targeting sites. For example, drugs can be targeted to the bulge region with stem cells or to the sebaceous glands. Interest in pilosebaceous units is directed towards their utilization as reservoirs for localized therapy and also as a transport pathway for systemic drug delivery. Improved investigative methods, such as differential stripping, are being developed in order to determine follicular penetration. This article reviews relevant aspects of effective follicle-targeting formulations and delivery systems as well as the activity status of hair follicles, and variations in follicle size and distribution throughout various body regions. Each of these factors strongly affects follicular permeation. We provide examples of improved penetration of particle-based formulations and of a size-dependent manner of follicular penetration. Contradictions are also discussed, indicating the need for detailed future investigations.",M1
20050020,"Hedgehog signaling maintains hair follicle stem cell phenotype in young and aged human skin.Skin hair <e>follicles</e> (HF) contain bulge stem cells (SC) that regenerate HFs during hair cycles, and repair skin epithelia following injury. As natural aging is associated with decreased skin repair capacity in humans, we have investigated the impact of age on human scalp HF bulge cell number and function. Here, we isolated human bulge cells, characterized as CD200+/KRT15+/KRT19+ cells of the HF, by dissection-combined CD200 selection in young and aged human skin. Targeted transcriptional profiling indicates that KRT15, KRT19, Dkk3, Dkk4, Tcf3, S100A4, Gas1, EGFR and CTGF/CCN2 are also preferentially expressed by human bulge cells, compared to differentiated HF keratinocytes (KC). Our results demonstrate that aging does not alter expression or localization of these HF SC markers. In addition, we could not detect significant differences in HF density or bulge cell number between young and aged human scalp skin. Interestingly, hedgehog (Hh) signaling is activated in human bulge cells in vivo, and down-regulated in differentiated HF KCs, both in young and aged skin. In addition, activation of Hh signaling by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of transcription factor Gli1 induces transcription of HF SC markers KRT15, KRT19, and Gas1, in cultured KCs. Together with previously reported knock-out mouse results, these data suggest a role for Hh signaling in maintaining bulge cell phenotype in young and aged human skin.",M1
20043013,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulates the in situ generation of mast cells from precursors in the human hair follicle mesenchyme.Hair <e>follicles</e> (HFs) maintain a peripheral, functional equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, whose most proximal element is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The mast cell (MC)-rich connective-tissue sheath (CTS) of mouse vibrissa HFs harbors MC precursors. Differentiation of these MC precursors into mature MCs can be induced by stem cell factor (SCF). We have investigated whether the MC progenitors of normal human scalp HF CTS respond to stimulation with CRH. Microdissected anagen HFs and full-thickness scalp skin were treated with CRH (10(-7) M). CRH treatment induced the degranulation of CTS MCs, in addition to increasing the number of CTS MCs in full-thickness skin and HF organ cultures in situ. In the latter, cells with characteristic MC features emigrated from the CTS. CRH-receptor protein expression in the CTS was colocalized with Kit expression on some CTS MCs in situ. CRH treatment upregulated SCF mRNA and protein expression within the HF epithelium. In skin organ culture, CRH-induced degranulation of CTS MCs was abolished by anti-SCF antibody. We demonstrate that human skin is an extramedullary reservoir for MC precursors, and we have identified a regulatory loop between CRH and SCF signaling. This highlights a previously unpublished finding about neuroendocrine control of human MC biology.",M1
20016249,"Effect of helium-neon laser irradiation on hair follicle growth cycle of Swiss albino mice.We report the results of a study carried out to investigate the effect of helium-neon (He-Ne) laser (632.8 nm) irradiation on the hair follicle growth cycle of testosterone-treated and untreated mice. Both histology and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were used for the measurement of hair follicle length and the relative percentage of hair <e>follicles</e> in different growth phases. A positive correlation (R = 0.96) was observed for the lengths of hair follicles measured by both methods. Further, the ratios of the lengths of hair follicles in the anagen and catagen phases obtained by both methods were nearly the same. However, the length of the hair follicles measured by both methods differed by a factor of 1.6, with histology showing smaller lengths. He-Ne laser irradiation (at approximately 1 J/cm(2)) of the skin of both the control and the testosterone-treated mice was observed to lead to a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in % anagen, indicating stimulation of hair growth. The study also demonstrates that OCT can be used to monitor the hair follicle growth cycle, and thus hair follicle disorders or treatment efficacy during alopecia.",M1
19957072,"[The influence of melatonin on hair physiology]Melatonin, the pineal gland hormone and a strong antioxidant, has long been known, particularly in animal-experiment based research and the wool-producing industry, to be a potent regulatory neuroendocrine substance in relation to hair growth, hair color and hair cycle, depending on light periods, seasonal rhythms, environmental factors and reproductive rhythms. Nevertheless, the biological mechanisms of this extremely versatile hormone, especially with regard to human hair <e>follicles</e>, are not fully understood. In recent years, however, essential knowledge has been gained on the melatoninergic system of the skin, melatonin levels in keratinocytes and hair follicles, extrapineal intrafollicular melatonin synthesis and noradrenalin-induced increase in synthesis, as well as hair cycle-dependent expression of the membrane-bound melatonin receptor MT2 and the nuclear receptor RORalpha. Functional data on the growth of human hair both in vitro and in vivo show that melatonin might play an essential role in hair physiology.",M1
19956989,"Cutaneous application of alpha-methylspermidine activates the growth of resting hair <e>follicles</e> in mice.Recent studies using transgenic animals have revealed a crucial role for polyamines in the development and the growth of skin and hair follicles. In mammals, the growth of hair is characterized by three main cyclic phases of transformation, including a rapid growth phase (anagen), an apoptosis-driven regression phase (catagen) and a relatively quiescent resting phase (telogen). The polyamine pool during the anagen phase is higher than in telogen and catagen phases. In this study, we used alpha-methylspermidine, a metabolically stable polyamine analog, to artificially elevate the polyamine pool during telogen. This manipulation was sufficient to induce hair growth in telogen phase mice after 2 weeks of daily topical application. The application site was characterized by typical features of anagen, such as pigmentation, growing hair follicles, proliferation of follicular keratinocytes and upregulation of beta-catenin. The analog penetrated the protective epidermal layer of the skin and could be detected in dermis. The natural polyamines were partially replaced by the analog in the application site. However, the combined pool of natural spermidine and alpha-methylspermidine exceeded the physiological spermidine pool in telogen phase skin. These results highlight the role of polyamines in hair cycle regulation and show that it is possible to control the process of hair growth using physiologically stable polyamine analogs.",M1
19956733,"Palmitoylation regulates epidermal homeostasis and hair follicle differentiation.Palmitoylation is a key post-translational modification mediated by a family of DHHC-containing palmitoyl acyl-transferases (PATs). Unlike other lipid modifications, palmitoylation is reversible and thus often regulates dynamic protein interactions. We find that the mouse hair loss mutant, depilated, (dep) is due to a single amino acid deletion in the PAT, Zdhhc21, resulting in protein mislocalization and loss of palmitoylation activity. We examined expression of Zdhhc21 protein in skin and find it restricted to specific hair lineages. Loss of Zdhhc21 function results in delayed hair shaft differentiation, at the site of expression of the gene, but also leads to hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and sebaceous glands, distant from the expression site. The specific delay in follicle differentiation is associated with attenuated anagen propagation and is reflected by decreased levels of Lef1, nuclear beta-catenin, and Foxn1 in hair shaft progenitors. In the thickened basal compartment of mutant IFE, phospho-ERK and cell proliferation are increased, suggesting increased signaling through EGFR or integrin-related receptors, with a parallel reduction in expression of the key differentiation factor Gata3. We show that the Src-family kinase, Fyn, involved in keratinocyte differentiation, is a direct palmitoylation target of Zdhhc21 and is mislocalized in mutant <e>follicles</e>. This study is the first to demonstrate a key role for palmitoylation in regulating developmental signals in mammalian tissue homeostasis.",M1
19951689,"SKPs derive from hair follicle precursors and exhibit properties of adult dermal stem cells.Despite the remarkable regenerative capacity of mammalian skin, an adult dermal stem cell has not yet been identified. Here, we investigated whether skin-derived precursors (SKPs) might fulfill such a role. We show that SKPs derive from Sox2(+) hair follicle dermal cells and that these two cell populations are similar with regard to their transcriptome and functional properties. Both clonal SKPs and endogenous Sox2(+) cells induce hair morphogenesis, differentiate into dermal cell types, and home to a hair follicle niche upon transplantation. Moreover, hair follicle-derived SKPs self-renew, maintain their multipotency, and serially reconstitute hair <e>follicles</e>. Finally, grafting experiments show that follicle-associated dermal cells move out of their niche to contribute cells for dermal maintenance and wound-healing. Thus, SKPs derive from Sox2(+) follicle-associated dermal precursors and display functional properties predicted of a dermal stem cell, contributing to dermal maintenance, wound-healing, and hair follicle morphogenesis.",M1
19944990,"Perioral wrinkles: histologic differences between men and women.BACKGROUND: Women tend to develop more and deeper wrinkles in the perioral region than men. Although much is known about the complex mechanisms involved in skin aging, previous studies have described histologic differences between men and women with respect to skin aging only incidentally and have not investigated the perioral region. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate gender-specific differences in the perioral skin. METHODS: To determine wrinkle severity, skin surface replicas of the upper lip region in 10 male and 10 female fresh cadavers were analyzed by using the dermaTOP blue three-dimensional digitizing system (Breuckmann, Meersburg, Germany). In 30 fresh male and female cadavers, three full-thickness lip resections were investigated in a blinded fashion for specific histologic features. All results were statistically analyzed in a linear regression model with SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). RESULTS: The female replicas showed more and deeper wrinkles than the male replicas (P &lt; .01). Histologic analysis revealed that the perioral skin of men displayed a significantly higher number of sebaceous glands (P = .000; 95% confidence interval [CI] 23.6-53.2), sweat glands (P = .002; 95% CI 2.1-8.1), and a higher ratio between vessel area and connective tissue area in the dermis (P = .009; 95% CI 0.003-0.021). The amount of hair <e>follicles</e> did not significantly differ between men and women, although the average number of sebaceous glands per hair follicle was greater in men (P = .002; 95% CI 0.33-1.28). CONCLUSIONS: Women exhibit more and deeper wrinkles in the perioral region and their skin contains a significantly smaller number of appendages than men, which could be a feasible explanation for why women are more susceptible to development of perioral wrinkles.",M1
19864043,"Spatiotemporal expression pattern of neuroepithelial stem cell marker nestin suggests a role in dermal homeostasis, neovasculogenesis, and tumor stroma development: a study on embryonic and adult human skin.BACKGROUND: Whereas keratinocytic bulge stem cells are well characterized, comparably little is known about cutaneous mesenchymal stem cells. The follicular connective tissue sheath is proposed as a niche for dermal stem cells. OBJECTIVE: Because the neuroepithelial stem cell marker nestin represents a marker for mesenchymal stem cells in various tissues, our aim was to characterize its spatiotemporal expression pattern in the skin with special reference to the follicular mesenchyme. METHODS: We studied immunohistochemically nestin expression over the course of human cutaneous embryogenesis, in postnatal skin, in scalp wounds, and in the peritumoral stroma of basal cell carcinomas and compared its expression with that of other known mesenchymal markers. RESULTS: Nestin is expressed throughout the entire early embryonic dermis but confined later during development to the follicular connective tissue sheath, where it can also be found in postnatal human hair <e>follicles</e>. Its expression is up-regulated in scalp wounds and the nestin-positive cells seem to originate from the follicular mesenchyme. Nestin is also expressed in a thin layer of fibroblasts in the immediate vicinity of basal cell carcinomas. LIMITATIONS: The examination for nestin expression of scalp wounds is considered preliminary, because we examined scalp wounds representing re-excisions of previously diagnosed neoplasms from which we had no exact time table available as to when the original excision took place. CONCLUSION: We propose that nestin functions as a stem cell marker of the follicular mesenchyme and has a major regulatory role in dermal homeostasis, cutaneous neovasculogenesis, and tumor stroma development.",M1

As the control, the skin of 10 people who died in car accidents and for other reasons, not associated with the effect of cold, as well as the skin samples taken from 10 healthy volunteers, were studied. Langerhans cells (LC) of the epidermis and hair follicle epithelium were studied using the ATPase reaction. LC structure under normal condition is described in detail. It was shown that these cells were localized in the suprabasal layer of the epidermis and of the epithelium of the external root sheath of the hair follicles. LC were forming contacts with one another by their long processes. In individuals who died as a result of general cooling, the number of LC was decreased both in the epidermis and in the epithelium of the external root sheath of the hair follicles and these cell underwent marked degenerative changes.",M1
19829300,"Stem cells with neural crest characteristics derived from the bulge region of cultured human hair <e>follicles</e>.In this study, we demonstrate that we can isolate stem cells (SCs) with neural crest characteristics from the bulge area of cultured human hair follicles (HFs). These SCs can proliferate in situ and form spheroid structures attached to the bulge area of HFs, and they express immature neural crest cell markers but not differentiation markers. An expression profiling study showed that they share a similar gene expression pattern with murine skin immature neural crest cells. These human SCs are label-retaining cells and are capable of self-renewal through asymmetric cell division in vitro. They exhibit clonal multipotency that can give rise to myogenic, melanocytic, and neuronal cell lineages after in vitro clonal single cell culture. In addition, these SCs show differentiation potential toward mesenchymal lineages, and they can be differentiated into adipocyte, chondrocyte, and osteocyte lineages. Neuronal differentiation of these cells induces global gene expression changes with a significantly increased expression of neuron-associated genes. Differentiated neuronal cells can persist in mouse brain and retain neuronal differentiation markers. The presence of SCs with neural crest characteristics in HFs may offer new opportunities for the use of these cells in regenerative medicine.",M1
19825978,"Thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH): a new player in human hair-growth control.Thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) is the most proximal component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid axis that regulates thyroid hormone synthesis. Since transcripts for members of this axis were detected in cultured normal human skin cells and since human hair <e>follicles</e> (HFs) respond to stimulation with thyrotropin, we now have studied whether human HF functions are also modulated by TRH. Here we report that the epithelium of normal human scalp HFs expresses not only TRH receptors (TRH-R) but also TRH itself at the gene and protein level. Stimulation of microdissected, organ-cultured HFs with TRH promotes hair-shaft elongation, prolongs the hair cycle growth phase (anagen), and antagonizes its termination by TGF-beta2. It also increases proliferation and inhibits apoptosis of hair matrix keratinocytes. These TRH effects may be mediated in part by reducing the ATM/Atr-dependent phosphorylation of p53. By microarray analysis, several differentially up- or down-regulated TRH-target genes were detected (e.g., selected keratins). Thus, human scalp HFs are both a source and a target of TRH, which operates as a potent hair-growth stimulator. Human HFs provide an excellent discovery tool for identifying and dissecting nonclassical functions of TRH and TRH-mediated signaling in situ, which emerge as novel players in human epithelial biology.",M1
19822478,"Promotion effect of norgalanthamine, a component of Crinum asiaticum, on hair growth.This study was conducted to evaluate the effect of Crinum asiaticum, a plant native to Jeju Island, Korea, on the promotion of hair growth. When rat vibrissa <e>follicles</e> were treated with a 95% ethanol (EtOH) extract of C. asiaticum, the hair-fiber lengths of the vibrissa follicles increased significantly. In addition, after daily topical application of the EtOH extract of C. asiaticum onto the back of C57BL/6 mice, anagen progression of the hair shaft was induced. Moreover, the extract increased the proliferation of immortalized vibrissa dermal papilla cells. When the vibrissa follicles in the anagen phase were treated with the extract, immunohistochemical analysis revealed that the extract was found to increase the expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) in the bulb region of the 7-day cultured follicles. In particular, norgalanthamine, a principal of the extract, showed activity that increased the hair-fiber lengths of vibrissa follicles and the proliferation of dermal papilla cells. These results suggest that norgalanthamine, a principal of C. asiaticum, has the potential to promote hair growth via the proliferation of dermal papilla.",M1
19804590,"Human eyelash characterization.BACKGROUND: Few biological data on human eyelash <e>follicles</e> have been reported in the literature. OBJECTIVES: To characterize eyelash follicle growth, cycle and morphology, and further investigate the biological mechanisms that determine eyelash length, curl and pigmentation, compared with scalp hair follicle. METHODS: Twenty-nine caucasian female volunteers aged between 26 and 60 years were enrolled in the study to provide eyelashes. Four of these volunteers were followed weekly for 9 months to characterize their eyelash cycle. Eyelash length and time of renewal were measured using a high-resolution camera and image analysis. Immunohistological study of the bulbs were performed on eyelid biopsies from 17 patients requiring block excision for ectropion repair. RESULTS: The calculated durations of anagen phase and complete cycle of the eyelashes were 34 + or - 9 and 90 + or - 5 days, respectively. Eyelash follicle growth rate was quite variable, with an average rate of 0.12 + or - 0.05 mm daily. Eyelash follicle morphology was very close to that of the scalp hair follicle, but some remarkable differences were noticed. For example, the K19-positive epithelial stem cell population was spread all along the follicle and not split into two reservoirs as seen in scalp hair follicles. Some asymmetry was detected in HSPG and CSPG, as well as K38 (formerly Ha8) and K82 (formerly Hb2) distribution, similar to that observed in curly hair. Finally, dopachrome tautomerase was found expressed in eyelash follicle melanocytes, while it was strikingly absent in scalp hair follicle melanocytes. CONCLUSIONS: The eyelash is structurally very close to curly hair but some biological processes related to follicle cycle and pigmentation differ markedly.",M1
19793306,"Hereditary hair loss and the ancient signaling pathways that regulate ectodermal appendage formation.All epidermal appendages, including hair, teeth, and nails, begin as a thickening of the ectoderm, called a placode. The placode arises from a primary induction signal that is sent from the underlying mesenchyme to the overlying epidermis. In mammals, the precise arrangement of hair <e>follicles</e> in the skin is due to the amount and distribution of signals that promote and inhibit hair placode formation. Continued development of a hair follicle after placode formation requires a complex cross-talk between the mesenchyme and epidermis. Here, I will review recent studies in humans and mice that have increased our understanding of the role of these signaling pathways in normal development and in hereditary hair loss syndromes. The study of normal hair development may suggest ways to restore or eliminate hair and might identify possible targets for the therapy of basal cell carcinoma, a cancer which strongly resembles embryonic hair follicles.",M1
19761392,"Hair follicle neogenesis induced by cultured human scalp dermal papilla cells.AIM: To develop a method by which human hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) cells can be expanded in vitro while preserving their hair-inductive potential for use in follicular cell implantation, a cellular therapy for the treatment of hair loss. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: DP cells were isolated from scalp hair <e>follicles</e> in biopsies from human donors. DP cell cultures were established under conditions that preserved their hair-inductive potential and allowed for significant expansion. The hair-inductive potential of cells cultured for approximately 36 doublings was tested in an in vivo flap-graft model. In some experiments, DiI was used to label cells prior to grafting. RESULTS: Under the culture conditions developed, cultures established from numerous donors reproducibly resulted in an expansion that averaged approximately five population doublings per passage. Furthermore, the cells consistently induced hair formation in an in vivo graft assay. Grafted DP cells appeared in DP structures of newly formed hairs, as well as in the dermal sheath and in the dermis surrounding follicles. Induced hair follicles persisted and regrew after being plucked 11 months after grafting. CONCLUSION: A process for the propagation of human DP cells has been developed that provides significant expansion of cells and maintenance of their hair-inductive capability, overcoming a major technical obstacle in the development of follicular cell implantation as a treatment for hair loss.",M1
19750535,"Nonviral in situ green fluorescent protein labeling and culture of primary, adult human hair follicle epithelial progenitor cells.In this article we show that cloning of the human K15 promoter before a green fluorescence protein (GFP)/geneticin-resistance cassette and transfection of microdissected, organ-cultured adult human scalp hair <e>follicles</e> generates specific K15 promoter-driven GFP expression in their stem cell-rich bulge region. K15-GFP+ cells can be visualized in situ by GFP fluorescence and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. Vital K15-GFP+ progenitor cells can then be selected by using the criteria of their green fluorescence, adhesion to collagen type IV and fibronectin, and geneticin resistance. Propagated K15-GFP+ cells express epithelial progenitor markers, show the expected differential gene expression profile of human bulge epithelium, and form holoclones. This application of nonretroviral, K15 promoter-driven, GFP labeling to adult human hair follicles facilitates the characterization and manipulation of human epithelial stem cells, both in situ and in vitro, and should be transferable to other complex human tissues.",M1
19733540,"mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.Epidermal integrity is a complex process established during embryogenesis and maintained throughout the organism lifespan by epithelial stem cells. Although Wnt regulates normal epithelial stem cell renewal, aberrant Wnt signaling can contribute to cancerous growth. Here, we explored the consequences of persistent expressing Wnt1 in an epidermal compartment that includes the epithelial stem cells. Surprisingly, Wnt caused the rapid growth of the hair <e>follicles</e>, but this was followed by epithelial cell senescence, disappearance of the epidermal stem cell compartment, and progressive hair loss. Although Wnt1 induced the activation of beta-catenin and the mTOR pathway, both hair follicle hyperproliferation and stem cell exhaustion were strictly dependent on mTOR function. These findings suggest that whereas activation of beta-catenin contributes to tumor growth, epithelial stem cells may be endowed with a protective mechanism that results in cell senescence upon the persistent stimulation of proliferative pathways that activate mTOR, ultimately suppressing tumor formation.",M1
19730084,"A revaluation of trichofolliculoma: the histopathological and immunohistochemical features.Few investigations on the histopathology of trichofolliculoma (TF) have so far included an immunohistochemical study. To seek new insight into TF with a revaluation of the histopathological features and an investigation of the immunohistochemical profile, 14 TFs were revaluated for the histopathology and the immunohistochemical profile of various cytokeratins (CKs), hair follicle stem cell markers, and others. The CK15 expression was upregulated in the basal cells from the primary cystic structures beyond to secondary <e>follicles</e> without expression of CK19. CK16 and CK17 were positive in the suprabasal cells of the primary cystic structures and the immature secondary hair follicles. No exact isthmus/bulge region was seen in the anagen secondary hair follicles, and newly developed (tertiary) hair follicles arose randomly from the involuting secondary follicles. Ber EP4 expression was generally weakened in the secondary or tertiary hair germ-like structures. The size of secondary hair follicles varied from vellus hair follicles to terminal hair follicles, even though no lesions located on the regions where the terminal hairs develop were included in this study. S-100 protein-positive wavy spindle cells were accidentally found in the surrounding connective tissue of the secondary follicles in 2 TF lesions. TFs were characterized by the proliferation of abnormal CK15-positive hair follicle stem cells, which basically differentiated toward the outer root sheath and attempting to make hair but losing the proper differentiation. The control of the size of the anagen hair follicles and the regular hair cycle were also disordered.",M1

METHODS: The polypropylene matrix for harboring the hair <e>follicles</e> was prepared and implanted subcutaneously at the neck of 5 New Zealand white rabbits by means of hair follicle unit transplantation. At 1 week after the transplantation and then on a monthly basis in the following 6 months, full-thickness skin tissues were sampled at the site of grafting to evaluate the histocompatibility of the matrix material using HE staining and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: At 1 week after implantation of the matrix material, a small number of inflammatory cells and lymphocytic infiltration were observed around the graft, with mild hyperemia in the proliferative capillaries and mild inflammatory responses. In the following 6 months, the inflammatory cells and lymphocytes around the graft decreased obviously or even disappeared, and such graft rejection responses as tissue lysis and necrosis were not observed. A large quantity of collagen fibers were found to encapsulate the polypropylene material. CONCLUSION: Polypropylene matrix graft has good histocompatibility with the rabbit subcutaneous tissue without producing obvious graft rejection responses, suggesting its feasibility for further experiments of hair follicle transplantation.",M1
19725870,"Methods in hair research: how to objectively distinguish between anagen and catagen in human hair follicle organ culture.The organ culture of human scalp hair <e>follicles</e> (HFs) is the best currently available assay for hair research in the human system. In order to determine the hair growth-modulatory effects of agents in this assay, one critical read-out parameter is the assessment of whether the test agent has prolonged anagen duration or induced catagen in vitro. However, objective criteria to distinguish between anagen VI HFs and early catagen in human HF organ culture, two hair cycle stages with a deceptively similar morphology, remain to be established. Here, we develop, document and test an objective classification system that allows to distinguish between anagen VI and early catagen in organ-cultured human HFs, using both qualitative and quantitative parameters that can be generated by light microscopy or immunofluorescence. Seven qualitative classification criteria are defined that are based on assessing the morphology of the hair matrix, the dermal papilla and the distribution of pigmentary markers (melanin, gp100). These are complemented by ten quantitative parameters. We have tested this classification system by employing the clinically used topical hair growth inhibitor, eflornithine, and show that eflornithine indeed produces the expected premature catagen induction, as identified by the novel classification criteria reported here. Therefore, this classification system offers a standardized, objective and reproducible new experimental method to reliably distinguish between human anagen VI and early catagen HFs in organ culture.",M1

Class III beta-tubulin (beta III) is a neuron-associated beta-tubulin isotype and expressed in the normal central and peripheral nervous systems. According to a previous study, beta III is not expressed in normal skin and squamous cell carcinoma. However, its expression has not been examined in basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin. Expression of beta III was analyzed together with neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM), chromogranin A, synaptophysin, epithelial membrane antigen (EMA) and cytokeratin (CK) 20 by immunohistochemical methods in 10 non-neoplastic skin tissues and 50 BCCs. In the normal skin, immunoreactivity to beta III was restricted to the nerve bundles in the dermis and subcutis, no positivity was shown in epithelial cells of the epidermis and skin appendages. beta III and NCAM were expressed in 50 and 68% of BCCs, respectively, predominantly periphery of tumor nests, although the distribution of both markers was not always identical. Chromogranin A, synaptophysin and CK 20 were not expressed in any of BCCs. EMA was focally expressed in only 8% of BCCs. beta III is a potential candidate for inclusion to the panel of immunohistochemical markers to distinguish small BCCs from non-neoplastic hair buds, because non-neoplastic hair <e>follicles</e> are not positive for beta III.",M1

19700758,"Bone morphogenetic protein antagonist noggin promotes skin tumorigenesis via stimulation of the Wnt and Shh signaling pathways.Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of skin development. To study the role of BMPs in skin tumorigenesis, BMP antagonist noggin was used to generate keratin 14-targeted transgenic mice. In contrast to wild-type mice, transgenic mice developed spontaneous hair follicle-derived tumors, which resemble human trichofolliculoma. Global gene expression profiles revealed that in contrast to anagen hair <e>follicles</e> of wild-type mice, tumors of transgenic mice showed stage-dependent increases in the expression of genes encoding the selected components of Wnt and Shh pathways. Specifically, expression of the Wnt ligands increased at the initiation stage of tumor formation, whereas expression of the Wnt antagonist and tumor suppressor Wnt inhibitory factor-1 decreased, as compared with fully developed tumors. In contrast, expression of the components of Shh pathway increased in fully developed tumors, as compared with the tumor placodes. Consistent with the expression data, pharmacological treatment of transgenic mice with Wnt and Shh antagonists resulted in the stage-dependent inhibition of tumor initiation, and progression, respectively. Furthermore, BMP signaling stimulated Wnt inhibitory factor-1 expression and promoter activity in cultured tumor cells and HaCaT keratinocytes, as well as inhibited Shh expression, as compared with the corresponding controls. Thus, tumor suppressor activity of the BMPs in skin epithelium depends on the local concentrations of noggin and is mediated at least in part via stage-dependent antagonizing of Wnt and Shh signaling pathways.",M1
19699163,"The effect of active hexose correlated compound in modulating cytosine arabinoside-induced hair loss, and 6-mercaptopurine- and methotrexate-induced liver injury in rodents.BACKGROUND: Active hexose correlated compound (AHCC) (a mixture of polysaccharides, amino acids, lipids and minerals derived from cultured mycelia of a Basidiomycete mushroom, Lentinula edodes) was used to assess amelioration of alopecia (hair loss) caused by cytosine arabinoside (Ara-C) and modulation of liver injury caused by single doses 6-mercaptopurine (6-MP) plus methotrexate (MTX). METHODS: Follicular integrity and hair growth was assessed in male and female SD neonatal rats (8 days old) treated with a single dose of Ara-C (30 mg/kg/day, i.p.) and AHCC (500 mg/kg/day, p.o.) for 7 consecutive days. The side effects of a single oral dose of 6-MP (2.5mg/kg body weight) plus MTX (30 mg/kg body weight) and their amelioration by treatment with AHCC (1000 mg/kg body weight) for 28 days were assessed in male ddY mice (8 weeks old). RESULTS: Of the Ara-C treated rats 71.4% showed severe alopecia and 28.6% showed moderate alopecia. However, the AHCC (p.o.)-treated Ara-C group was significantly protected from alopecia. Ara-C treated rats had profound loss of hair <e>follicles</e> but the Ara-C plus AHCC-treated group had mild losses of follicles. AHCC supplementation to the 6-MP- and MTX-treated mice significantly increased body weight, erythrocytes, leukocytes and serum albumin, improved liver hypertrophy and degeneration, normalized the activities of serum glutamic oxaloacetic transaminase (sGOT) and serum glutamic pyruvic transaminase (sGPT), and enhanced liver drug-metabolizing enzymes.

However, there was a recently reported case of BHD syndrome with multiple facial FP lesions and a case of tuberous sclerosis, in which one FF lesion was included among the multiple facial FPs. METHODS: The histopathological and immunohistochemical features of FF/TD and FP lesions were revaluated to study the relationship between the two. This investigation evaluated 20 FF/TD lesions including two cases of BHD syndrome and 35 FP lesions including three cases of tuberous sclerosis. RESULTS: There are common histopathological features in the two lesions, such as the follicular and perifollicular elements, an angiofibromatous element and stellate fibrocytes. The similar immunohistochemical features between the two lesions included the expression patterns of CD34, factor XIIIa, nestin and c-kit in the stromal cells as well as abnormal CK15 expression in the hair <e>follicles</e>.

The transfollicular path has been largely ignored because hair <e>follicles</e> constitute only 0.1% of the total skin. The hair follicle is a skin appendage with a complex structure containing many cell types that produce highly specialised proteins. The hair follicle is in a continuous cycle: anagen is the hair growth phase, catagen the involution phase and telogen is the resting phase. Nonetheless, the hair follicle has great potential for skin treatment, owing to its deep extension into the dermis and thus provides much deeper penetration and absorption of compounds beneath the skin than seen with the transdermal route. In the case of skin diseases and of cosmetic products, delivery to sweat glands or to the pilosebaceous unit is essential for the effectiveness of the drug. Increased accumulation in the pilosebaceous unit could treat alopecia, acne and skin cancer more efficiently and improve the effect of cosmetic substances and nutrients. Therefore, we review herein various drug delivery systems, including liposomes, niosomes, microspheres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, lipid nanocarriers, gene therapy and discuss the results of recent researches. We also review the drugs which have been investigated for pilosebaceous delivery.",M1
19660053,"De novo follicular regeneration of the skin by wingless int 3 and bone morphogenetic protein 2 genes introduced into dermal fibroblasts and fibroblast growth factor-2 protein.In this study, we regenerated skin and its appendages by transplanting cultured normal dermal fibroblasts, into which morphogen genes had been introduced. We cultured normal dermal fibroblasts obtained from Fisher 344 rats on the surface of hydroxyapatite beads, and then adsorbed them onto the surface of a collagen sponge, which was transplanted into a full-thickness skin defect prepared on the backs of rats. Before transplantation, genes were introduced into the dermal fibroblasts via adenovirus vector (ad)-bone morphogenetic protein 2 and ad-wingless int 3 genes in addition to fibroblast growth factor-2 protein. By Week 4, the appearance of follicle germs or primitive hair germs was observed only in the ad-bone morphogenetic protein 2+ad-wingless int 3 combined with the fibroblast growth factor-2 protein group. By Week 16, in that same group, hair <e>follicles</e> having mature pilosebaceous systems with equally spaced localization had formed in the ulcer wound.",M1
19659862,"Scarring alopecia: clinical and pathologic study of 54 African-American women.BACKGROUND: Cicatricial or scarring alopecia results in the destruction of hair <e>follicles</e> and is a significant cosmetic concern in African-American women. OBJECTIVE: To correlate the clinical examination and histologic findings in African-American women with scarring alopecia with a history of hairstyling practices. METHODS: We reviewed retrospectively the medical records and scalp biopsy specimens of 54 women with scarring alopecia. Patients were selected from two dermatologic practices in the Detroit Metropolitan area. RESULTS: Alopecia commonly presents in patients who use a variety of traumatic haircare techniques, including chemical and physical straighteners, traction, braiding, hair extensions, hair gluing, and chemical curls. Histologic findings are centered around the follicular infundibulum with a lymphocytic infiltrate and perifollicular fibrosis. CONCLUSION: Traumatic hairstyling techniques are common in African-American women, and all result in a similar picture of a peri-infundibular lymphocytic infiltrate and fibrosis, leading to alopecia.",M1
19645852,"Does erythropoietin modulate human hair follicle melanocyte activities in situ?Erythropoietin (EPO) is now appreciated for not only drive erythopoiesis, but also to exert additional functions. Since we had previously shown that human hair <e>follicles</e> (HFs) are both an extra-renal source and an extra-medullary target of EPO, we have now studied whether one such function is the regulation of HF pigmentation. Human anagen VI HFs were treated with EPO (100 IU/ml) in serum-free organ culture. Unexpectedly, we noticed greatly divergent pigmentary effects of EPO, since both up- and down-regulation of HF melanin content and tyrosinase activity in situ was seen in HF derived from different individuals. These divergent effects could not be attributed to differences in skin regions, the total HF melanocyte number or specific traits of individual HF donors. Our pilot study provides first evidence suggesting that EPO may modulate normal human melanocyte functions under physiologically relevant conditions in situ.",M1
19639341,"Daunomycin accumulation and induction of programmed cell death in rat hair <e>follicles</e>.The anthracycline antibiotic daunomycin (DM) is useful for the treatment of leukemia but has side-effects such as alopecia. Using immunocytochemistry, we show that, after a single i.v. injection, DM accumulates in the nuclei of matrix cells and in the outer root sheath of hair follicles. DM-positive matrix cells are detectable up to 48 h after injection and exhibit a characteristic granular morphology, which is not observed in saline-injected controls. TUNEL-staining has revealed that DM injection induces programmed cell death (PCD) in rat hair follicles. Cells undergoing PCD are detectable as late as 5 days postinjection in both the matrix and outer root sheath. Newly developed double-staining has shown that some of the DM-positive matrix cell nuclei are also TUNEL-positive. Staining for activated caspase-3 has demonstrated immunopositive cells following DM administration both in the matrix and in the outer root sheath. Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry has shown the presence of DM-positive cells with two different types of morphology. About half of the immunopositive cells exhibit a morphology typical of classical apoptosis (PCD type 1), whereas the other half show signs of autophagic cell death (PCD type 2). Interestingly, little, if any, DM accumulation or apoptosis has been detected in the dermal hair papillae. This may have a bearing on potential regeneration of the hair follicles. Thus, DM accumulates in a characteristic pattern in hair follicles. This accumulation is associated with the induction of two morphologically distinct forms of PCD.",M1
19629164,"Circadian clock genes contribute to the regulation of hair follicle cycling.Hair <e>follicles</e> undergo recurrent cycling of controlled growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes.",M1

19614992,"Cytokeratin 75 expression in central, centrifugal, cicatricial alopecia--new observations in normal and diseased hair <e>follicles</e>.BACKGROUND: Premature desquamation of the inner root sheath (IRS) is an important histological marker for central, centrifugal, cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), and an inherently defective IRS may be responsible. Cytokeratin 75 (K75; formerly K6hf) is an appealing candidate for study because K75 is specifically expressed in the companion layer of the hair follicle, the interface for IRS desquamation. Also, K75 abnormalities have been found in other hair diseases bearing similarities to CCCA. METHODS: We used a commercially available antibody to K75 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from clinically and histologically  normal  scalp (n=9); clinically diseased scalp from patients with CCCA (n=15); and clinically  normal  scalp from patients with CCCA (n=6). RESULTS: K75 expression disappears during the process of IRS desquamation, and loss of expression begins even when IRS desquamation is in its incipient phase. Also, K75 has a characteristic pattern of expression in telogen follicles. CONCLUSIONS: K75 expression is closely associated with the process of desquamation of the IRS. This process occurs prematurely (below the isthmus) in many follicles from patients with, but not without, CCCA. K75 expression highlights premature desquamation of the IRS in CCCA, but may not be directly involved in disease pathogenesis.",M1
19605494,"Sox2-positive dermal papilla cells specify hair follicle type in mammalian epidermis.The dermal papilla comprises the specialised mesenchymal cells at the base of the hair follicle. Communication between dermal papilla cells and the overlying epithelium is essential for differentiation of the hair follicle lineages. We report that Sox2 is expressed in all dermal papillae at E16.5, but from E18.5 onwards expression is confined to a subset of dermal papillae. In postnatal skin, Sox2 is only expressed in the dermal papillae of guard/awl/auchene <e>follicles</e>, whereas CD133 is expressed both in guard/awl/auchene and in zigzag dermal papillae. Using transgenic mice that express GFP under the control of the Sox2 promoter, we isolated Sox2(+) (GFP(+)) CD133(+) cells and compared them with Sox2(-) (GFP(-)) CD133(+) dermal papilla cells. In addition to the 'core' dermal papilla gene signature, each subpopulation expressed distinct sets of genes. GFP(+) CD133(+) cells had upregulated Wnt, FGF and BMP pathways and expressed neural crest markers. In GFP(-) CD133(+) cells, the hedgehog, IGF, Notch and integrin pathways were prominent. In skin reconstitution assays, hair follicles failed to form when dermis was depleted of both GFP(+) CD133(+) and GFP(-) CD133(+) cells. In the absence of GFP(+) CD133(+) cells, awl/auchene hairs failed to form and only zigzag hairs were found. We have thus demonstrated a previously unrecognised heterogeneity in dermal papilla cells and shown that Sox2-positive cells specify particular hair follicle types.",M1
19596793,"Corneodesmosin gene ablation induces lethal skin-barrier disruption and hair-follicle degeneration related to desmosome dysfunction.Corneodesmosin (CDSN) is specific to desmosomes of epithelia undergoing cornification, mainly the epidermis and the inner root sheath of the hair <e>follicles</e>. CDSN nonsense mutations are associated with hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp, a rare disease that leads to complete baldness in young adults. CDSN displays adhesive properties, mostly attributable to its N-terminal glycine-rich domain, and is sequentially proteolyzed as corneocytes migrate towards the skin surface. K14-promoter driven Cre-mediated deletion of Cdsn in mice resulted in neonatal death as a result of epidermal tearing upon minor mechanical stress. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a desmosomal break at the interface between the living and cornified layers. After grafting onto nude mice, knockout skin showed a chronic defect in the epidermal permeability barrier. The epidermis was first hyperproliferative with a thick cornified layer, then, both the epidermis and the hair follicles degenerated. In adults, Cdsn deletion resulted in similar histological abnormalities and in a lethal barrier defect. We demonstrate that Cdsn is not essential for skin-barrier formation in utero, but is vital throughout life to preserve this barrier by maintaining desmosome integrity. The strong adhesive function that the protein confers on corneodesmosomes also seems necessary for maintaining the architecture of the hair follicle.",M1
19572415,"Comparison of two in vitro models for the analysis of follicular penetration  and its prevention by barrier emulsions.The penetration of topically applied substances in and through the human skin is of special interest for the development and optimization of topically applied drugs and cosmetic products. In the present study, the efficacy of barrier emulsions in the prevention of the penetration of pollen allergens into the hair <e>follicles</e> was investigated. Because of the sensitising potential of the used pollen allergens, the study was carried out under in vitro conditions. Therefore, excised human skin and porcine ear skin were used as tissue models. Applying laser-scanning microscopy and fluorescent-labeled grass pollen allergens, we found that the preventive efficacy of the barrier emulsions could be significantly better investigated on porcine ear skin than on excised human skin. This might be due to the contraction of the elastic fibres around the hair follicles in excised human skin after its removal. In contrast to the excised human skin, the porcine ear skin remains on the cartilage during the experiment. Therefore, contraction of the tissue can be avoided. The results give further indication that in vitro studies based on membranes of excised skin are not suitable for the investigation of the follicular penetration pathway of topically applied substances.",M1

A total of 105 cadaveric skin samples from subjects of either gender aged from 19 to 83 years were available for analysis. Postmortem examination 1-2 days after death was performed at the Department of Forensic Medical Examination for the Vitebsk region. Skin samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen and studied as cryostat sections. Langerhans cells were detected using the ATPase assay as described by Wachstein and Meisel and modified by Robins and Brendon. The Langerhans cells of subjects who died from general hypothermia were shown to undergo marked morphological changes. Moreover, their number significantly decreased as a result of disintegration and transformation into fine-grain material. Surviving cells lost many of their outgrowths and exhibited enhanced ATPase activity in pericarion. The Langerhans cells from dorsal and ventral skin as well as from interfollicular epidermis and the outer sheath of hair follicles underwent virtually identical changes. A unique morphological feature of the skin in those who died from general hypothermia was formation of intraepidermal, subepidermal, and dermal blisters.",M1
19557687,"Reptile scale paradigm: Evo-Devo, pattern formation and regeneration.The purpose of this perspective is to highlight the merit of the reptile integument as an experimental model. Reptiles represent the first amniotes. From stem reptiles, extant reptiles, birds and mammals have evolved. Mammal hairs and feathers evolved from Therapsid and Sauropsid reptiles, respectively. The early reptilian integument had to adapt to the challenges of terrestrial life, developing a multi-layered stratum corneum capable of barrier function and ultraviolet protection. For better mechanical protection, diverse reptilian scale types have evolved. The evolution of endothermy has driven the convergent evolution of hair and feather <e>follicles</e>: both form multiple localized growth units with stem cells and transient amplifying cells protected in the proximal follicle. This topological arrangement allows them to elongate, molt and regenerate without structural constraints. Another unique feature of reptile skin is the exquisite arrangement of scales and pigment patterns, making them testable models for mechanisms of pattern formation. Since they face the constant threat of damage on land, different strategies were developed to accommodate skin homeostasis and regeneration. Temporally, they can be under continuous renewal or sloughing cycles. Spatially, they can be diffuse or form discrete localized growth units (follicles). To understand how gene regulatory networks evolved to produce increasingly complex ectodermal organs, we have to study how prototypic scale-forming pathways in reptiles are modulated to produce appendage novelties. Despite the fact that there are numerous studies of reptile scales, molecular analyses have lagged behind. Here, we underscore how further development of this novel experimental model will be valuable in filling the gaps of our understanding of the Evo-Devo of amniote integuments.",M1

19543555,"Extradermal melanin transfer? Lack of macroscopic spleen melanization in old C57BL/6 mice with de-synchronized hair cycle.In quest of alternate, extradermal path of melanin transfer from skin to the visceral organs, we suggested that some portions of such melanin may be deposited in the spleen, which in young black C57BL/6 mice is often melanized. Here, we confirm these observation using young C57BL/6 female mice (up to 17 weeks) and show that this phenomenon cannot be observed in old animals where the hair cycle is not synchronized any more. The experiments were carried out both on spontaneous and depilation-induced hair cycle. We have checked it as a side-observation over many other experiments carried out on young and old C57BL/6 female mice (up to 2.5 years of life). The presence or absence of melanin in the spleens was checked macroscopically, and histologically by Fontana-Masson (FM) staining, and synchronization of the hair cycle - by standard histomorphometric analysis of the back skin hair <e>follicles</e>. In about 40% of old spleens black FM-stainable  debris  could be found under closer histological examination. This study shows that, at least in part, the phenomenon of splenic melanosis in C57BL/6 mice can be correlated with the synchronized skin melanization parallel to the hair cycle progress, and that splenic melanin undergoes gradual degradation during the mouse life.",M1
19542918,"Requirement of DHCR24 for postnatal development of epidermis and hair <e>follicles</e> in mice.Desmosterolosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with severe developmental anomalies due to mutations in the DHCR24 gene, encoding an enzyme to convert desmosterol to cholesterol. We reported that DHCR24 [knockout (KO)] mice were born with wrinkleless taut skin and with impaired development of epidermis. In this study, we investigated the postnatal development of epidermis and hair follicle in the skin of KO mice grafted to the nude mice. Skin graft was required since the KO mice die within few hours after birth. Forty days after the skin graft, epidermis from the KO mice revealed the characteristic phenotype observed at birth. Furthermore, the number of hair follicles in the skin graft from KO mice to the nude mice was significantly less and development was delayed than that from control. These findings implicate that DHCR24 plays important roles for normal development of epidermis and hair follicle even in postnatal life.",M1
19542914,"Differential expression of the antioxidant repair enzyme methionine sulfoxide reductase (MSRA and MSRB) in human skin.Recently, the antioxidant repair enzymes methionine-S-sulfoxide reductase A (MSRA) and methionine-R-sulfoxide reductase B (MSRB) were described in human epidermal keratinocytes and melanocytes. Methionine sulfoxide reductases (MSRs) are thought to protect against reactive oxygen species-induced oxidative damage in many organs, including the most environmentally exposed organ, human skin. We sought to examine the expression and distribution of this enzyme family (MSRA, MSRB1, MSRB2, and MSRB3) within the various compartments of healthy and diseased human skin. Expression was assessed using polyclonal MSR antibodies and immunohistochemical staining of human skin biopsies from various anatomical sites. Remarkably, MSRA expression was not only found in the epidermis as previously described but also in hair <e>follicles</e> and eccrine glands and was most pronounced in sebaceous glands. Furthermore, MSRB2 expression was found in melanocytes while MSRB1 and MSRB3 were both expressed within vascular endothelial cells. In conclusion, MSR enzymes are differentially expressed in human skin. Thus, modulation of MSR repair antioxidants may have implications for cutaneous aging and carcinogenesis.",M1
19538195,"Transplantation of chronic wounds with epidermal sheets derived from autologous hair <e>follicles</e>--the Leipzig experience.BACKGROUND: An increasing number of chronic wounds in our society require strategies to improve wound healing and wound closure. One of several options is skin transplantation. In this article, we focus on the transplantation of tissue engineered autologous epidermal sheets derived from outer root sheath (ORS) cells of the patients' hair. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Out of the stem cells of the ORS of anagen hair, autologous keratinocytes are cultured ex vivo in organotypic cultures to form a multilayered epidermal equivalent (EpiDex, EuroDerm Biotech &amp; Aesthetics, Stuttgart, Germany). These sheets are placed on the wound bed. Patients were observed twice a week in the first 2 weeks, then once weekly for 4 weeks, then every 4 weeks for up to 12 weeks after transplantation. A total of 23 patients with (n = 18) and without (n = 5) therapeutic improvement were analyzed retrospectively. We evaluated only the effect of a single transplantation in a selected ulcer per patient. Furthermore, a subgroup-analysis for responder patients with an ulcer area &lt; 25 cm2 (n = 12) was performed. RESULTS: In the responder patients (n = 18), a total wound reduction of 23% was observed. Patients (n = 12) with ulcer area &lt; 25 cm2 had an improvement of 64%. Complete wound closure in this subgroup after a single transplantation was achieved in 33 % (n = 4) cases. CONCLUSIONS: Autologous keratinocyte transplantation with EpiDex can be performed easily and safely in patients with chronic wounds with satisfying results. Our data suggest that patients with small ulcer area &lt; 25 cm2 might profit the most from this method.",M1
19527330,"Androgenetic alopecia in males: a histopathological and ultrastructural study.BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia is a common cosmetic hair disorder, resulting from interplay of genetic, endocrine, and aging factors leading to a patterned follicular miniaturization. Microinflammation seems to be a potential active player in this process. AIMS: To study the histopathological and ultrastructural changes occurring in male androgenetic alopecia (AGA). Patients/methods Fifty-five subjects were included in this study (40 with AGA and 15 as normal age-matched controls). Skin biopsies from frontal bald area and occipital hairy area were subjected to histopathological examination, immunohistochemical staining for collagen I and ultrastructural study. RESULTS: The frontal bald area of patients showed highly significant increase in telogen hairs and decrease in anagen/telogen ratio and terminal/vellus hair ratio (P &lt; 0.001). Perifollicular inflammation was almost a constant feature in early cases and showed a significant inverse correlation with perifollicular fibrosis (P = 0.048), which was more marked with thickening of the follicular sheath in advanced cases. CONCLUSION: Follicular microinflammation plays an integral role in the pathogenesis of AGA in early cases. Over time, thickening of perifollicular sheath takes place due to increased deposition of collagen, resulting in marked perifollicular fibrosis, and sometimes ends by complete destruction of the affected <e>follicles</e> in advanced cases.",M1
19521467,"Black-hair follicular dysplasia in a New Zealand Huntaway Dog.CASE HISTORY: A 6-year-old intact male New Zealand Huntaway dog had slowly progressive alopecia that was first observed at 12 weeks of age. CLINICAL FINDINGS: Patchy alopecia was confined to the black-haired areas of the body, and was most evident on the head and dorsum of the body; tan-haired areas of skin appeared normal. Histological examination of black-haired skin revealed distended melanocytes and large aggregates of melanin within, and surrounding, the hair <e>follicles</e> and the epidermis. Macrophages distended with melanin were also visible within the peri-follicular and superficial dermis, and follicular lumina were often plugged by keratin that contained aggregates of melanin. The follicles were dysplastic and few hair shafts were visible emerging from follicular infundibula within the sections. DIAGNOSIS: The clinical and histological findings were consistent with black-hair follicular dysplasia (BHFD). CLINICAL RELEVANCE: This is the first report of BHFD in a dog in New Zealand, and is the first report in a Huntaway. The most significant effect of BHFD is a predisposition to follicular plugging and secondary bacterial skin infections. Due to the hereditary nature of the follicular dysplasias, breeding from affected dogs should be discouraged. Histological examination of the skin is required to differentiate between the different follicular dysplasias as well as differentiating between follicular dysplasia and follicular atrophy due to endocrinopathy.",M1
19513791,"A novel mutation in Hr causes abnormal hair follicle morphogenesis in hairpoor mouse, an animal model for Marie Unna Hereditary Hypotrichosis.Hairpoor mice (Hr(Hp)) were derived through N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis. These mice display sparse and short hair in the Hr(Hp)/+ heterozygous state and complete baldness in the Hr(Hp)/Hr(Hp) homozygous state. This phenotype was irreversible and was inherited in an autosomal semidominant manner. Hair <e>follicles</e> (HFs) of Hr(Hp)/+ mice underwent normal cycling and appeared normal, although smaller than those of the wild-type mice. In contrast, HFs of Hr(Hp)/Hr(Hp) mice became cyst-like structures by postnatal day (P) 21. The number and length of vibrissae decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the number of mutant alleles increased. A positional candidate gene approach was used to identify the gene responsible for the hairpoor phenotype. Genetic linkage analysis determined that the hairpoor locus is 2 cm from D14Mit34 on chromosome 14. Sequence analysis of the exons of the candidate gene hairless revealed a T-to-A transversion mutation at nucleotide position 403 (exon 2), presumably resulting in abolishment of an upstream open reading frame (uORF). In addition, we also found that the near-naked mouse (Hr(N)), a spontaneously arising mutant, harbors a A402G transition in its genome. Both mutations were in the uATG codon of the second uORF in the 5' UTR and corresponded to the mutations identified in Marie Unna Hereditary Hypotrichosis (MUHH) patients. In the present study we describe the phenotype, histological morphology, and molecular etiology of an animal model of MUHH, the hairpoor mouse.",M1
19506554,"Differential expression of stem-cell-associated markers in human hair follicle epithelial cells.Several putative biomarkers have been suggested for identifying murine follicular stem cells; however, human hair <e>follicles</e> have a different pattern of biomarker expression, and follicular stem cell isolation methods have not been established. To isolate a stem cell population applicable to clinical settings, we conducted a comprehensive survey of the expression of stem-cell-associated (K15, CD200, CD34, and CD271) and other biomarkers (K1, K14, CD29, and CD49f) in immunohistological sections of the human epidermis and follicular outer root sheath (ORS). We also examined freshly isolated and cultured epidermal or follicular cells with single- and multicolor flow cytometry or immunocytochemistry. After sorting cells by CD200, CD34, and forward scatter (FSC) values (cell size), colony-forming assays were performed. We found that biomarkers were differentially expressed in the epidermis and ORS. Basal bulge cells were mainly K15+CD200+CD34(-)CD271(-), and suprabasal cells were K15(-)CD200+CD34(-)CD271(-). We categorized follicular cells into nine subpopulations according to biomarker expression profiles. The CD200+CD34(-) bulge cells had much higher colony-forming abilities than the CD34+ population, and were divided into two subpopulations: a CD200+CD34(-)FSC(high) (K15-rich, basal) and a CD200+CD34(-)FSC(low) (K15-poor, suprabasal) population. The former formed fewer but larger-sized colonies than the latter. Follicular epithelial cell cultivation resulted in loss of K15, CD200, CD34, and CD271 expression, but maintenance of K14, CD29, and CD49f expression. We found that the bulge contained two populations with different localizations, cell sizes, and colony-forming abilities. We showed that K15, CD200, CD34, and CD271 were useful biomarkers for characterizing freshly isolated human follicular epithelial cells in diverse stages of differentiation.",M1
19474150,"KGF and EGF signalling block hair follicle induction and promote interfollicular epidermal fate in developing mouse skin.A key initial event in hair follicle morphogenesis is the localised thickening of the skin epithelium to form a placode, partitioning future hair follicle epithelium from interfollicular epidermis. Although many developmental signalling pathways are implicated in follicle morphogenesis, the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, also known as FGF7) receptors are not defined. EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands have previously been shown to inhibit developing hair <e>follicles</e>; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been characterised. Here we show that receptors for EGF and KGF undergo marked downregulation in hair follicle placodes from multiple body sites, whereas the expression of endogenous ligands persist throughout hair follicle initiation. Using embryonic skin organ culture, we show that when skin from the sites of primary pelage and whisker follicle development is exposed to increased levels of two ectopic EGFR ligands (HBEGF and amphiregulin) and the FGFR2(IIIb) receptor ligand KGF, follicle formation is inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We then used downstream molecular markers and microarray profiling to provide evidence that, in response to KGF and EGF signalling, epidermal differentiation is promoted at the expense of hair follicle fate. We propose that hair follicle initiation in placodes requires downregulation of the two pathways in question, both of which are crucial for the ongoing development of the interfollicular epidermis. We have also uncovered a previously unrecognised role for KGF signalling in the formation of hair follicles in the mouse.",M1
19470461,"The disruption of Sox21-mediated hair shaft cuticle differentiation causes cyclic alopecia in mice.Hair is maintained through a cyclic process that includes periodic regeneration of hair <e>follicles</e> in a stem cell-dependent manner. Little is known, however, about the cellular and molecular mechanisms that regulate the layered differentiation of the hair follicle. We have established a mutant mouse with a cyclic alopecia phenotype resulting from the targeted disruption of Sox21, a gene that encodes a HMG-box protein. These mice exhibit progressive hair loss after morphogenesis of the first hair follicle and become completely nude in appearance, but then show hair regrowth. Sox21 is expressed in the cuticle layer and the progenitor cells of the hair shaft in both mouse and human. The lack of this gene results in a loss of the interlocking structures required for anchoring the hair shaft in the hair follicle. Furthermore, the expression of genes encoding the keratins and keratin binding proteins in the hair shaft cuticle are also specifically down-regulated in the Sox21-null mouse. These results indicate that Sox21 is a master regulator of hair shaft cuticle differentiation and shed light on the possible causes of human hair disorders.",M1
19469906,"Gene expression profiles of BMP4, FGF10 and cognate inhibitors, in the skin of foetal Merino sheep, at the time of secondary follicle branching.The high concentration of secondary branched <e>follicles</e> is a distinctive feature of the Merino sheep. These follicles initiate from 100 days of gestation. Here, we report a transition in abundance of the BMP4 and FGF10 morphogens occurring at this time. At 103 days of gestation, FGF10 gene expression dropped steadily from maximal levels, in a trend that continued until day 143. Conversely, from day 105, BMP4 transcript levels rapidly increased to maximal levels that were maintained until 131 days, before declining. This profile closely matches reported changes in branched follicle numbers, which peak in density at day 134. SPRY4, a known regulator of FGF10, increased to maximal levels concomitant with the fall in FGF10, suggesting a relationship. Levels of the BMP4 inhibitor NOG matched the initial rise of BMP4, with a fivefold spike at 108 days; but consistent with the rise in BMP4, this high level was not sustained.",M1
19469896,"Evaluation of radiation-induced hair follicle apoptosis in mice and the preventive effects of fibroblast growth factor-1.Radiation-induced hair loss is a clinically important, but under-researched topic. The aim of the study was to develop an in vivo assay system for radiation-induced apoptosis in hair <e>follicles</e> to promote hair research and exploit new radioprotectors. BALB/c mice received total body irradiation (TBI) with gamma-rays at doses in the range from 8 to 16 Gy at 6 days after depilation. Pathological changes were detected progressively in the hair follicles over the time course after TBI and the dystrophy was evaluated on the basis of stage-specific parameters reported previously, which were found to be well-suited for classification of the radiation-induced hair follicle dystrophy. As a result, regression from anagen to catagen was determined in these follicles after irradiation. In addition, radiation-induced apoptosis was a good early dystrophic parameter. In this system, it was found that fibroblast growth factor-1 effectively prevented hair follicle apoptosis in mice.",M1
19460298,"The study of mitochondrial A3243G mutation in different samples.Mitochondrial encephalopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke-like episodes syndrome (MELAS) is the most frequent syndromic manifestation of A3243G mutation in mitochondrial DNA. Detection of A3243G mutation in blood is less helpful for the diagnosis of MELAS and the carriers, and the mutation ratio in blood correlates only in a limited extent with the severity of the disease. Here we compared the ratio of A3243G mutation in four easily available samples (blood, urine, hair follicle and saliva) in patients with MELAS carrying A3243G mutation as well as their maternal relatives from 32 families, to find out the samples appropriate for the detection of the patients and carriers and useful for the evaluation of clinical severity from their mutation ratio. In MELAS patients and the carriers with minor symptoms or normal phenotype, A3243G mutation ratio was significantly higher in urine than in blood. A close correlation between A3243G mutation ratio in blood and that in urine, hair <e>follicles</e> and saliva was found in the probands and their relatives. Clinical features closely correlated with the mutation ratio in urine. Measurement of A3243G mutation ratio in urine is a non-invasive, convenient and rapid method with its diagnostic meaning superior to blood testing.",M1
19453793,"The hair follicle melanocytes in vitiligo in relation to disease duration.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Vitiligo is an acquired pigmentary disorder of skin and hair. Active melanocytes in hair <e>follicles</e> can be detected by DOPA and immunohistochemical staining, while amelanotic melanocytes can only be detected by the latter. None of the studies on hair melanocytes in vitiligo discussed the effect of disease duration on these melanocytes. Here, we study the presence of melanotic and amelanotic melanocytes in vitiligo hair follicles and statistically correlating their presence with the disease duration. METHODS: This study was conducted on 30 patients with vitiligo and 10 normal volunteers. Three biopsies were taken from each patient: two from black and white hairs from vitiliginous areas and the third from apparently normal skin of the same patients. Sections were stained by DOPA reaction and NKI/beteb then examined for the presence of melanocytes. The presence of melanocytes and the disease duration were correlated statistically using the t-test. RESULTS: Active melanocytes were detected in black hairs of 6.7% of vitiligo patients and in 100% of apparently normal skin of the same patients and controls. On examining black hairs of the 28 vitiligo patients with negative DOPA reaction, 19 of them (67.9%) showed positive NKI/beteb stain. Disease duration was inversely correlated with the melanocytes' presence within hair follicles. Melanocytes were absent from 100% of white hairs. CONCLUSIONS: The melanotic melanocytes were the first target of the disease process followed by the amelanotic melanocytes. Since the disappearance of the latter was inversely correlated with the disease duration, early treatment in vitiligo is advised.",M1
19438810,"TGF-beta is specifically expressed in human dermal papilla cells and modulates hair folliculogenesis.Dermal papilla cells (DPCs) in the mammalian hair follicle have been shown to develop hair <e>follicles</e> through epithelial-mesenchymal interactions. A cell therapy to regenerate human hair is theoretically possible by expanding autologous human DPCs (hDPCs) and transplanting them into bald skin, though much remains to be overcome before clinical success. In this study, we compared gene signatures of hDPCs at different passages and human dermal fibroblasts, and found transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(2) to be highly expressed in cultured hDPCs. Keratinocyte conditioned medium, which is known to help preserve the hair-inducing capacity of hDPCs, up-regulated TGF-beta(2) expression of hDPCs and also enhanced their alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, a known index for hair-inductive capacity. Through screening of components secreted from keratinocytes, the vitamin D(3) analogue was found to promote TGF-beta(2) expression and ALP activity of hDPCs. In animal hair folliculogenesis models using rat epidermis and expanded hDPCs, inhibition of TGF-beta(2) signalling at the ligand or receptor level significantly impaired hair folliculogenesis and maturation. These results suggest an important role for TGF-beta(2) in hair follicle morphogenesis and provide insights into the establishment of future cell therapies for hair regrowth by transplanting expanded DPCs.",M1
19438685,"Hair regeneration from transected <e>follicles</e> in duplicative surgery: rate of success and cell populations involved.BACKGROUND: The use of bisected hair follicles in hair transplantation has been previously reported, but the capacity of each half to regenerate the entire hair has not been clarified. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate duplicative surgery rate of success and to analyze the cell populations involved in hair regeneration. METHODS: We screened 28 patients undergoing duplicative surgery. Approximately 100 hair follicles from each patient were horizontally bisected and implanted. Upper and lower portions were stained for the known epithelial stem cell markers CD200, p63, beta1-integrin, CD34, and K19. RESULTS: Similar percentages of hair regrowth after 12 months were observed when implanting the upper (72.7 +/- 0.4%) and lower (69.2 +/- 1.1%) portions. Expression of CD200, p63, and beta1-integrin was detected in both portions, whereas K19 and CD34 stained different cell populations in the upper and lower fragment, respectively. CONCLUSION: Duplicative surgery might represent a successful alternative for hair transplantation, because both portions are capable of regenerating a healthy hair. Moreover, our results suggest the possible presence of stem cells in both halves of the follicle.",M1
19438446,"The neuroepithelial stem cell protein nestin is a marker of the companion cell layer of the adult and developing human hair follicle.BACKGROUND: The interface between the inner root sheath (IRS) and the outer root sheath (ORS) represents a slippage plane for the hair shaft to evolve from the pilar canal to the skin surface. Interposed between the IRS and ORS is a single cell layer which is believed to represent the angle point of that slippage plane, termed the companion cell layer (CCL). The CCL is cited in most of the literature as part of the ORS. OBJECTIVES: To describe the expression pattern of nestin, a neuroepithelial stem cell protein, in the adult and developing human hair follicle. METHODS: Immunohistochemical evaluation with a monoclonal antibody against nestin was performed using standard techniques. RESULTS: Nestin is selectively expressed in the CCL of the adult anagen and late stage fetal hair <e>follicles</e>. Early stages of hair follicle development are negative for nestin expression. CONCLUSIONS: The selective demarcation of the CCL by nestin highlights the unique feature of this follicular cell layer and raises the question of whether the CCL should not be better conceptualized as a part of the IRS rather than the ORS. The results of the present study, together with published ultrastructural data, also suggest that the slippage plane for the evolving hair shaft may be located at the interface between the CCL and the ORS.",M1
19416266,"l-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate promotes elongation of hair shafts via the secretion of insulin-like growth factor-1 from dermal papilla cells through phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase.BACKGROUND: l-Ascorbic acid 2-phosphate (Asc 2-P), a derivative of l-ascorbic acid, promotes elongation of hair shafts in cultured human hair <e>follicles</e> and induces hair growth in mice. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether the promotion of hair growth by Asc 2-P is mediated by insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and, if so, to investigate the mechanism of the Asc 2-P-induced IGF-1 expression. METHODS: Dermal papilla (DP) cells were cultured and IGF-1 level was measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay after Asc 2-P treatment in the absence or presence of LY294002, a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitor. Also, hair shaft elongation in cultured human scalp hair follicles and proliferation of cocultured keratinocytes were examined after Asc 2-P treatment in the absence or presence of neutralizing antibody against IGF-1. In addition, keratinocyte proliferation in cultured hair follicles after Asc 2-P treatment in the absence or presence of LY294002 was examined by Ki-67 immunostaining. RESULTS: IGF-1 mRNA in DP cells was upregulated and IGF-1 protein in the conditioned medium of DP cells was significantly increased after treatment with Asc 2-P. Immunohistochemical staining showed that IGF-1 staining is increased in the DP of cultured human hair follicles by Asc 2-P. The neutralizing antibody against IGF-1 significantly suppressed the Asc 2-P-mediated elongation of hair shafts in hair follicle organ culture and significantly attenuated Asc 2-P-induced growth of cocultured keratinocytes. LY294002 significantly attenuated Asc 2-P-inducible IGF-1 expression and proliferation of follicular keratinocytes in cultured hair follicles. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that Asc 2-P-inducible IGF-1 from DP cells promotes proliferation of follicular keratinocytes and stimulates hair follicle growth in vitro via PI3K.",M1
19403398,"[Effect of alexandrite laser treatment for hair removal in Tibet mini-pigs]OBJECTIVE: To observe the histological and ultrastructural changes of the skin and hair <e>follicles</e> following hair removal by alexandrite laser in Tibet mini-pigs. METHODS: Twelve healthy Tibet mini-pigs with dark hair were treated with alexandrite laser for hair removal. The skin specimens were taken immediately and at 1 h and 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 days after the laser treatment for observation under optical and transmission electron microscope. RESULTS: Laser hair removal resulted in extensive coagulation necrosis, carbonization and falling of the subcutaneous hair shafts, and some of the cells in the outer root sheath and hair bulb underwent degenerative and necrotic changes. One hour after laser treatment, the cells in the outer root sheath and bulb exhibited nuclear condensation, fragmentation and or karyolysis characteristic of cell apoptosis. The cell apoptosis reached the peak level on day 3 after the laser exposure, accompanied by endothelial degeneration in the hair papilla vessels, edema and lymphocyte infiltration in the dermal tissues. Tissue reaction and inflammation were relieved on day 5, and the dermal tissue and follicles recovered their normal structures on day 10. At 60 days after the treatment, the hair follicles decreased markedly but the structure of the residue follicles remained normal.CONCLUSION: Alexandrite laser exposure results in selective destruction of the follicles by inducing direct coagulation and cell apoptosis to achieve permanent hair removal. Tibet mini-pigs with black hair can be used as the animal model of clinical laser hair removal.",M1
19398276,"Pathophysiology in Teladorsagia (Ostertagia) circumcincta-infected sheep selected for high fleece weight.Resilience to parasitism is considered to be the maintenance of growth and production during infection, probably associated with an immune response with lesser detrimental effects on the host relative to adverse effects on the parasite. Resilience to infection with Teladorsagia circumcincta was investigated in lambs from a flock selected for forty generations for high fleece weight (HFW), but with higher FEC and worm burdens than their unselected control (C) flock run in parallel. After recovery from surgery to implant abomasal cannulae, four parasite-naïve lambs from each flock were infected intraruminally at 6.5 months-of-age with 50,000 T. circumcincta L3, then from Day 35 to 70 post infection with 10,000 larvae at weekly intervals. Blood, abomasal fluid and faecal samples were collected daily to Day 35 and thence twice weekly for measurement of serum gastrin and pepsinogen concentrations, blood eosinophils, abomasal pH and FEC. Abomasal worm counts were made after necropsy on Day 94. Skin biopsies were collected weekly for estimation of the percentage of wool <e>follicles</e> containing paracortical cells. Total serum immunoglobulin and IgG1, IgG2, IgA and IgM titres specific for T. circumcincta antigens were estimated twice weekly to Day 42 p.i., then weekly. After the primary challenge, FEC were higher in the HFW lambs, whereas neither group shed many eggs during the 5-week trickle infection; worm burdens were small at post mortem. Resilient HFW lambs showed a lesser inflammatory response, but relatively small differences in abomasal secretion. Circulating eosinophil counts increased moderately in both groups, less in the HFW lambs, during the primary infection and more markedly during the subsequent trickle infection, when the increase in the C lambs became significantly greater. All measured serum antibody titres were low in both groups throughout. Selection for HFW altered the wool characteristics of parasite-naïve lambs (fewer follicles containing paracortical cells). There was a slower increase in the percentage of follicles containing these cells after primary infection. Abomasal function was similar in the two groups, both exhibiting typical increases in abomasal pH and serum gastrin and pepsinogen concentrations. The most marked differences in the HFW lambs were a greater rise in serum pepsinogen during the primary infection and the 2-day delay in onset of hypoacidity. Resilience to parasitism in this flock is consistent with maintenance of wool quality and small differences in abomasal secretion resulting from an attenuated immune response causing fewer detrimental effects on host tissues.",M1
19397695,"A guide to hair follicle analysis by transmission electron microscopy: technique and practice.Hair <e>follicles</e> contain several tissues and cell types that differentiate down distinct pathways to provide for growth, keratinization and the maintenance of the hair shaft. Electron microscopy is useful for examining the morphological characteristics of developing hair follicles, including special types of keratinization, the timing of keratinization, programmed cell death, cell adhesion and separation, cell movement and changes in organelles. Hair follicles are one of the more challenging targets for electron microscopic analysis, and the use of neonatal animals combined with careful treatment of the samples can yield informative photomicrographs. Detailed protocols and examples of a number of techniques are presented here.",M1
19387480,"Hair <e>follicles</e> are required for optimal growth during lateral skin expansion.The hair follicles (HFs) and the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) of intact mature skin are maintained by distinct stem cell populations. Upon wounding, however, emigration of HF keratinocytes to the IFE plays a role in acute stages of healing. In addition to this repair function, rapidly cycling cells of the upper HF have been observed transiting to the IFE in neonatal skin. Here we report that an absence of HF development leads to shortening and kinking of the mouse tail. These skeletal defects are reduced by stimulating keratinocyte proliferation, suggesting that they arise from impaired epidermal expansion. We confirm that rapidly cycling cells of the HF emigrate to the IFE of the neonatal tail. These results suggest that an absence of HFs results in impaired skin growth that is unable to keep pace with the rapidly elongating axial skeleton of the tail. Thus, in addition to their role in wound repair, HFs can make a significant contribution to lateral expansion of the IFE in the absence of trauma.",M1
19379645,"The cutaneous epidermal growth factor network: Can it be translated clinically to stimulate hair growth?The influences exerted by the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the skin act at multiple levels, which involve compartments that normally express EGFR. These include the basal and suprabasal layers of the epidermis, sebaceous glands, and the outer root sheath of the hair <e>follicles</e>. The physiological roles of EGFR ensure epidermal renewal and integrity, along with a gatekeeping and function and hair growth stimulation functions. Important cellular functions that are altered during EGF receptor blocking therapy consist of epidermal differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, and migration, with an overall dominating effect of inducing growth arrest and terminal differentiation of the keratinocytes in the basal layers. The effects of EGFR blockage on the hair cycle include terminal differentiation of the hair follicle, which in certain cases may be associated with trichomegaly. Trichomegaly of the eyelashes may occur as an isolated occurrence or, frequently, as part of a generalized phenomenon that may be associated with the use of the EGFR inhibitors. Molecular changes associated with EGFR blockage are discussed, relevant to their association with hair growth. Modulation of Akt, AP2alpha, CDK4, Notch-1, p27KIP1, and Hedgehog expression are involved in the initiation of the hair cycle and inducement of the anagen phase, followed by proliferation and differentiation of the hair follicles. Epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitors have been developed as therapeutic molecules directed against cancer; in these regimens the knowledge of EGF receptor signaling functions has been translated into significant clinical results. However, among their various collateral effects on the skin, hair growth is observed to occur in certain patients. A particular  wavy  hair phenotype is observed during the pharmacological EGFR receptor blockade, just as in murine transgenic models that carry loss of function of TGF-alpha or EGFR genes. A better characterization of the individual roles pertaining to the EGF family ligands and receptors, has the potential provide new strategies for the management of hair loss.",M1
19378257,"Analyses of regenerative wave patterns in adult hair follicle populations reveal macro-environmental regulation of stem cell activity.The control of hair growth in the adult mammalian coat is a fascinating topic which has just begun to be explored with molecular genetic tools. Complex hair cycle domains and regenerative hair waves are present in normal adult (&gt; 2 month) mice, but more apparent in mutants with cyclic alopecia phenotypes. Each hair cycle domain consists of initiation site(s), a propagating wave and boundaries. By analyzing the dynamics of hair growth, time required for regeneration after plucking, in situ hybridization and reporter activity, we showed that there is oscillation of intra-follicular Wnt signaling which is synchronous with hair cycling, and there is oscillation of dermal bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling which is asynchronous with hair cycling. The interactions of these two rhythms lead to the recognition of refractory and competent phases in the telogen, and autonomous and propagating phases in the anagen. Boundaries form when propagating anagen waves reach <e>follicles</e> which are in refractory telogen. Experiments showed that Krt14-Nog mice have shortened refractory telogen and simplified wave dynamics. Krt14-Nog skin grafts exhibit non-autonomous interactions with surrounding host skin. Implantation of BMP coated beads into competent telogen skin prevents hair wave propagation around the bead. Thus, we have developed a new molecular understanding of the classic early concepts of inhibitory  chalone , suggesting that stem cells within the hair follicle micro-environment, or other organs, are subject to a higher level of macro-environmental regulation. Such a novel understanding has important implications in the field of regenerative medicine. The unexpected links with Bmp2 expression in subcutaneous adipocytes has implications for systems biology and Evo-Devo.",M1
19369934,"Scarring alopecia and the PPAR-gamma connection.The pathobiology of primary cicatricial ( scarring ) alopecia (PCA) remains poorly understood and underinvestigated. In this issue, Karnik et al. identify a previously unsuspected player, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-gamma (PPARgamma), in the pathogenesis of the most frequent form of PCA, lichen planopilaris (LPP). The authors show that PPARgamma is required for maintenance of a functional epithelial stem cell compartment in murine hair <e>follicles</e>, that the targeted deletion of PPARgamma in the bulge/isthmus area of the hair follicle epithelium generates a skin pathology that resembles LPP, and that LPP patients show gene expression changes that indicate a defect in lipid metabolism and peroxisome biogenesis. This study invites the revisitation of many open questions in PCA pathobiology and the exploration of new avenues for future PCA management.",M1

19369394,"FGF-regulated BMP signaling is required for eyelid closure and to specify conjunctival epithelial cell fate.There are conflicting reports about whether BMP signaling is required for eyelid closure during fetal development. This question was addressed using mice deficient in BMP or TGFbeta signaling in prospective eyelid and conjunctival epithelial cells. Genes encoding two type I BMP receptors, the type II TGFbeta receptor, two BMP- or two TGFbeta-activated R-Smads or the co-Smad Smad4 were deleted from the ocular surface ectoderm using Cre recombinase. Only mice with deletion of components of the BMP pathway had an 'eyelid open at birth' phenotype. Mice lacking Fgf10 or Fgfr2 also have open eyelids at birth. To better understand the pathways that regulate BMP expression and function during eyelid development, we localized BMPs and BMP signaling intermediates in Fgfr2 and Smad4 conditional knockout (CKO) mice. We found that Fgfr2 was required for the expression of Bmp4, the normal distribution of Shh signaling and for preserving the differentiation of the conjunctival epithelium. FGF signaling also promoted the expression of the Wnt antagonist Sfrp1 and suppressed Wnt signaling in the prospective eyelid epithelial cells, independently of BMP function. Transcripts encoding Foxc1 and Foxc2, which were previously shown to be necessary for eyelid closure, were not detectable in Smad4(CKO) animals. c-Jun, another key regulator of eyelid closure, was present and phosphorylated in eyelid periderm cells at the time of fusion, but failed to translocate to the nucleus in the absence of BMP function. Smad4(CKO) mice also showed premature differentiation of the conjunctival epithelium, conjunctival hyperplasia and the acquisition of epidermal characteristics, including formation of an ectopic row of hair <e>follicles</e> in place of the Meibomian glands. A second row of eyelashes is a feature of human lymphedema-distichiasis syndrome, which is associated with mutations in FOXC2.",M1

This study was conducted in Department of Ophthalmology and Parasitology, Dokuz Eylül University, School of Medicine. Our study included 82 cases that were seen in the Ophthalmology Department and Parasitology Department for various reasons. We have also observed that the presence of Demodex spp. provokes itching and redness in the eyes and that using baby shampoo for cleansing the face reduces the risk of infestation. After the treatment of 32 cases with 4% pilocarpin HCl gel, we achieved a total cure in 12 eyes (37.5%), partial improvement in 13 eyes (40.6%), (making a total of 25 eyes, 78.1%).

19363794,"Distribution of P2X(3)-immunoreactive fibers in hairy and glabrous skin of the rat.The skin is innervated by two populations of unmyelinated sensory fibers, the peptidergic and nonpeptidergic, which transmit nociceptive information to the central nervous system. The peptidergic population expresses neuropeptides such as substance P (SP) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and has both cutaneous and visceral targets. The nonpeptidergic population expresses the purinergic receptor P2X(3), binds the isolectin B4 (IB4), and innervates mainly the epidermis. To date, the peptidergic nociceptor population in cutaneous tissue of the rat has been well characterized, whereas the nonpeptidergic innervation pattern has lacked an adequate description. To this aim, we used light microscopic immunocytochemistry to investigate the pattern of P2X(3)-immunoreactive (-IR) fiber innervation of both hairy and glabrous skin from male Sprague-Dawley rats. Our results show extensive P2X(3)-IR fibers throughout the upper and lower dermis. Thick bundles of P2X(3)-IR fibers were found to run in parallel with the dermal-epidermal junction and projected multiple thin collateral axons that penetrated the epidermal layer, creating a dense network of innervation throughout the entire epidermis. The distribution of P2X(3)-IR fibers in the epidermis was far more extensive than the distribution of CGRP-IR fibers. P2X(3)-IR fibers also innervate hair <e>follicles</e> but were rarely found in close proximity to glands and blood vessels. The present results suggest a primary role for P2X(3)-IR fibers in the detection of noxious stimuli in cutaneous tissue and provide an anatomical basis for future studies examining a possible functionally distinct role of nonpeptidergic nociceptors in the transmission of nociceptive signals.",M1
19360332,"Human keratinocytes derived from the bulge region of hair <e>follicles</e> are refractory to differentiation.Human keratinocyte strains derived from the bulge region of plucked human follicles were successfully established from all 43 donors (age 24-76) regardless of the age and gender. The total cell number, number of population doublings and population doubling time were similar among the strains. These bulge-derived keratinocytes, BDKs, expressed keratin family genes specific to basal cell layers of the epidermis. They also expressed CD34, one of the bulge stem cell marker genes. The growth behavior and positivity of CD34 indicate that BDKs contain stem cells. BDKs were cultured until confluency or treated with CaCl2 to induce differentiation. Morphology and expression of keratin family genes in BDKs before and after differentiation induction with CaCl2 were similar to those of epidermal keratinocytes obtained from skin biopsies (NHEKs). However, expression levels of keratin-10, a prickle cell layer marker, in CaCl2-treated BDKs were lower than those in CaCl2-treated NHEKs. Higher expression of integrin-alpha6, a basal cell layer marker, was also noted in BDKs than in NHEKs after differentiation induction. Expression of stem cell marker genes other than CD34, including CD200, Sox2 and NANOG, was about the same at confluency in both cells, but significantly higher in BDKs than NHEKs after differentiation. These results indicate that BDKs were more refractory to differentiation than NHEKs. We then examined Wnt signaling inhibitor genes, DKK-3 and WIF-1 that function as tumor suppressors. DKK-3 expression decreased in both BDKs and NHEKs after CaCl2-induced differentiation. Expression of WIF-1 decreased 50% in BDKs one day after CaCl2 treatment and remained low, but was induced 1.7 times in NHEKs one day after CaCl2 treatment and further induced thereafter (&gt;2.5 times), suggesting that WIF-1 may be involved in maintaining the differentiation-refractory status of BDKs. Since cancer stem cells in the skin have been reported to be similar to bulge-derived stem cells, our BDK strains may be of use in studying characteristics of cancer stem cells of the epidermis.",M1

Insulin is found in hair <e>follicles</e> and may play a role in the regulation of androgen metabolism and the hair-growth cycle. OBJECTIVES: To compare the insulin resistance between people with androgenic alopecia and a control group. METHODS: A case-control study was conducted with 97 cases in the patient and 87 in the control group. Serum fasting insulin level, fasting blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) were all measured in both groups. RESULTS: There was no difference in serum fasting insulin level, fasting blood glucose, serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, HDL and insulin resistance between the two groups (P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Despite previous reports suggesting a link, our study found no significant relationship between insulin resistance and androgenic alopecia. Further studies are warranted.",M1
19319559,"Evidence for distinct populations of human Merkel cells.Merkel cells (MCs) are neuroendocrine cells of unknown origin located in the skin. They are identified at electron microscopic level by electron dense granules, at light microscopic level by the presence of cytokeratins 8, 18, 19 and 20. Contradictory reports concerning the presence of other molecules of epithelial as well as neural origin prompted us to investigate whether there are distinct populations of human MCs. Here, we show the heterogeneous expression of villin, N-CAM, NGF-R, and neurofilaments in MCs. Synaptophysin is found in all MCs but with different intensity, nestin is absent. Expression patterns vary between interfollicular epidermis, hair <e>follicles</e> and glabrous epidermis. We conclude that there are distinct populations of MCs, but all populations contain markers for epithelial as well as neural cells. Putative functions of the distinct populations are discussed.",M1
19309374,"Expression and localization of vascular endothelial growth factor and vascular endothelial growth factor receptor-2 in human epidermal appendages: a comparison study by immunofluorescence.BACKGROUND: Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) promotes angiogenesis and plays important roles in neovascularization and development of tissues. VEGF receptors (VEGFRs) are high-affinity receptors for VEGF and are originally considered specific to endothelial cells. We have previously shown that keratinocytes from human normal skin express VEGFRs. This poses the question of whether these receptors are also expressed by epidermal appendages, as epidermal appendages are lined with epithelial cells. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of VEGFR-2 compare with VEGF in epidermal appendages, including hair <e>follicles</e>, eccrine sweat glands and sebaceous glands. METHODS: Monoclonal antibodies to VEGF and VEGFR-2 were used for immunohistochemical examination of cryostat-cut sections of normal human skin specimens from 11 donors undergoing cosmetic surgery. RESULTS: Immunoreactivities for VEGF and VEGFR-2 principally showed parallel intense expression in anagen hair follicle (including outer root sheat, inner root sheath, dermal papillae epidermal matrix), sebaceous glands (ductal and secretory portions) and eccrine sweat glands (ductal and secretory portions), respectively. In particular, abundant expression of VEGF was found in the follicular basement membrane zone surrounding the bulb matrix and in the ductal and secretory portions of eccrine sweat glands. CONCLUSION: A potential VEGF/VEGFR-2 autocrine pathway may be defined by the coexpression of VEGF and VEGFR-2 in human skin epidermal appendages.",M1
20479243,"Activation of dormant ovarian <e>follicles</e> to generate mature eggs.Although multiple follicles are present in mammalian ovaries, most of them remain dormant for years or decades. During reproductive life, some follicles are activated for development. Genetically modified mouse models with oocyte-specific deletion of genes in the PTEN-PI3K-Akt-Foxo3 pathway exhibited premature activation of all dormant follicles. Using an inhibitor of the Phosphatase with TENsin homology deleted in chromosome 10 (PTEN) phosphatase and a PI3K activating peptide, we found that short-term treatment of neonatal mouse ovaries increased nuclear exclusion of Foxo3 in primordial oocytes. After transplantation under kidney capsules of ovariectomized hosts, treated follicles developed to the preovulatory stage with mature eggs displaying normal epigenetic changes of imprinted genes. After in vitro fertilization and embryo transfer, healthy progeny with proven fertility were delivered. Human ovarian cortical fragments from cancer patients were also treated with the PTEN inhibitor. After xeno-transplantation to immune-deficient mice for 6 months, primordial follicles developed to the preovulatory stage with oocytes capable of undergoing nuclear maturation. Major differences between male and female mammals are unlimited number of sperm and paucity of mature oocytes. Thus, short-term in vitro activation of dormant ovarian follicles after stimulation of the PI3K-Akt pathway allows the generation of a large supply of mature female germ cells for future treatment of infertile women with a diminishing ovarian reserve and for cancer patients with cryo-preserved ovaries. Generation of a large number of human oocytes also facilitates future derivation of embryonic stem cells for regenerative medicine.",M2
20406781,"IGF system and ovarian folliculogenesis in dog breeds of various sizes: is there a link?The IGF system plays a crucial role in ovarian folliculogenesis, and changes in IGF-binding protein (IGFBP) levels modulate IGF bioavailability. Data from various mammalian models suggest a link between body size, IGF1 in serum and female reproduction parameters. Among the vertebrate species, the dog exhibits the widest span in body height. Height is known to be positively correlated with the concentration of serum IGF1. In this work, the ovarian physiology of 40 bitches exhibiting a wide span of height, and breed type was investigated. IGF1, IGF2, IGFBP3, estradiol (E(2)), and progesterone concentrations in plasma and preovulatory follicular fluid were quantified. A total of 455 <e>follicles</e>, 2-8 mm in diameter, were recovered at the preovulatory stage, measured, and punctured. Intrafollicular levels of IGF1 were positively correlated with plasma levels, and plasma IGF1 levels were positively correlated with both bitch height and weight. The concentrations were threefold higher in large dogs compared with small dogs. A positive correlation between intrafollicular and plasmatic IGFBP3 levels and a positive correlation between plasmatic IGFBP3 levels, and both height and weight of the bitches were observed. The number of preovulatory follicles and the diameter of the three largest follicles were positively correlated with bitch height. E(2) intrafollicular concentrations were higher in preovulatory follicles from small animals than in those from large animals. In conclusion, the strong variability in height between dogs appeared to be associated with dramatic differences in IGF1, and IGFBP3 levels, in both plasma and follicular fluid. These differences were associated with significant differences in some functional aspects of ovarian follicles.",M2

In Experiment 1, estrus was synchronized in 15 cows using two Estrumate (cloprostenol sodium) injections (250 mg cloprostenol intramuscular), the time of ovulation (Day 0) was confirmed by ultrasonography, and ovarian antral follicles were ablated on Day 5. The ensuing superovulatory treatment consisted of eight Folltropin-V injections (50 mg intramuscular) administered twice daily from Day 6 to Day 9, followed by two injections of Estrumate (Day 10 am and pm) and a single dose of Lutropin Alfa (Day 11; 750 IU intramuscular). On Day 5, both TT(3) and FT(3) concentrations were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in serum than follicular fluid from dominant (DFs) or subordinate antral follicles (SFs), and TT(4) concentrations were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in DFs compared with SFs. Serum concentrations of FT(4) were greater (P &lt; 0.05) on Day 12 than on Day 5, and TT(4) concentrations in follicular fluid collected on Day 12 were higher than those in DFs and SFs on Day 5. In Experiment 2, there were no differences (P &gt; 0.05) in thyroid hormone concentrations between the largest and all remaining antral follicles visible on the surface of the ovary (n = 20 ovaries). We concluded that: (i) physiological status of bovine antral follicles (i.e. dominant versus subordinate) may impinge on the accumulation of TT(4) in follicular fluid; and (ii) hormonal ovarian superstimulation increases circulating levels of FT(4) and follicular fluid content of TT(4).",M2
20391753,"[Reproduction of European bank vole (Myodes glareolus, Rodentia) under conditions of natural geochemical anomalies]Estimates of abundance, morpho-functional state of ovaries, potential and actual fecundity of European bank vole, Myodes glareolus, inhabiting the territories of natural geochemical anomalies that are situated over ultra-basic rock and have an excess content of chrome, nickel, and cobaltare obtained. The population adaptive response to extreme geochemical conditions that facilitates the species survival under unfavorable environmental conditions and is manifested through an increase in potential and actual fecundity, decline of pre-implantation mortality, and decrease in proportion of females with pre-implantation losses is revealed. It is shown that in anomalous areas the intensity of folliculogenesis in mature voles is independent of the population cycle phase. As for immature animals residing within geochemical anomalies, an increase in size and numbers of <e>follicles</e> in ovaries is observed which is indicative of maturation fastening. An increase in potential and actual fecundity, as well as changes in morpho-functional state of ovaries, can be interpreted as means of birth rate accelerating which is supposed to compensate high postnatal mortality and maintain population abundance.",M2
20390842,"Follicular apoptosis in the mussel (Mytella strigata) as potential indicator of environmental stress in coastal ecosystems.Follicular apoptosis in the tropical mussel Mytella strigata was assessed in three coastal lagoons located in the southern Gulf of California, Mexico. Mussels were collected from three coastal lagoons associated with different scenarios of anthropogenic stress during one year. The gonad of each mussel was dissected, weighed, and sampled for histology and apoptosis analysis by TUNEL labeling. Two apoptotic indices were used: the apoptotic index of cells (AIC) based on the number of follicular cells in apoptosis in one thousand cells counted per gonad, and the apoptotic index of <e>follicles</e> (AIF) based on the number of follicular cells per follicle per gonad. Both indices showed high association with each other for all developmental stages, although AIF seemed to better discriminate among sites. Higher AIF and AIC were observed at the Urias Estuary (1.6 and 1.5 respectively) ranked as highly polluted, followed by Ensenada del Pabellon (0.82 and 0.95 respectively), ranked as moderately polluted, and the Teacapan Estuary (0.57 and 0.76 respectively) ranked as slightly polluted. Our data indicate that the apoptotic index in tropical mussels could be a useful indicator of environmental stress in coastal ecosystems; however, the ecological relevance of follicular apoptosis in polluted environments needs further investigation.",M2
20378682,"Insufficient luteinizing hormone-induced intracellular signaling disrupts ovulation in preovulatory <e>follicles</e> lacking estrogen receptor-{beta}.Gonadotropin-stimulated estrogen receptor-beta (ERbeta)-null preovulatory follicles exhibit submaximal estradiol production, insufficient acquisition of LH receptor, and attenuated expression of essential ovulatory genes. These observations lead to low ovulatory rates compared with wild-type (WT) follicles. We hypothesize that insufficient LH receptor results in reduced cAMP production after an ovulatory stimulus. Individual preantral follicles were cultured with FSH for 4 d and then induced to ovulate with a single dose of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). cAMP levels 1 h after hCG were 50% lower in ERbeta-null than WT follicles. To determine whether the lack of LH receptor, and resulting lack of cAMP, could be bypassed by direct activation of adenylyl cyclase, WT and ERbeta-null follicles were induced to ovulate with forskolin. Ten micromolar forskolin doubled the ovulatory rate of ERbeta-null follicles compared with treatment with hCG ( approximately 50 vs. 25%, respectively). In WT follicles, 10 microm forskolin reduced the ovulation rate compared with hCG (14 vs. 83%, respectively), indicating that high doses of forskolin inhibited WT ovulation. A 10 microm concentration of forskolin induced cAMP levels in ERbeta-null follicles that were comparable to levels produced in WT follicles after hCG and either partially or completely rescued the attenuated expression of LH-responsive genes. These data indicate that direct activation of adenylyl cyclase, resulting in increased production of cAMP, partially rescues the ovulatory response of ERbeta-null follicles, suggesting that insufficient LH receptor and low cAMP levels contribute to their poor ovulatory rates. We also determined that ERbeta-null ovaries exhibit an alteration in the activation of ERK1/2. Our evaluation of the ERbeta-null ovarian phenotype indicates that ERbeta plays a role in facilitating folliculogenesis. We show that expression of ERbeta in preovulatory follicles is required for adequate cAMP production and propose that an optimal level of cAMP is required for hCG-stimulated ovulation.",M2
20349023,"The distribution of corpora lutea and ovarian follicular development in pregnant goats.The main objective of the study was to determine the number of growing <e>follicles</e> (diameter&gt;or=4 mm) with regards to the distribution of corpora lutea (CL) on the ovaries in pregnant goats. Growing follicles with a diameter greater than 5 mm i.e. large follicles were also recorded and analyzed. Daily ultrasonography (USG) examinations of ovaries were made in six Polish White Goats starting from the day of estrus detection (December/January) until parturition (May/June). An individual profile of follicular growth during the entire pregnancy was recorded for every goat. Three goats with CL present only on one ovary were included into group CL/0, and the three other goats with CL on both ovaries were in CL/CL group. The mean numbers of growing (52.0+/-11.3) and large (21.0+/-7.1) follicles during the entire pregnancy in group CL/0 were significantly (p&lt;or=0.05) higher than those of group CL/CL (growing follicles: 30.0+/-2.8, large follicles: 10.0+/-2.8). The mean numbers of growing (13.7+/-2.1) and large (4.4+/-0.9) follicles on the CL-bearing ovary were significantly (p&lt;or=0.01) lower than those on the CL-free ovary (growing follicles: 41.0+/-7.0, large follicles: 18.0+/-5.0). In conclusion, the distribution of CL in the ovaries affected a number of growing follicles during caprine pregnancy. The majority of growing follicles during this period was observed on the CL-free ovaries.",M2
20349022,"Distribution of androgen and progesterone receptors in the spiny mouse (Acomys cahirinus) ovary during postnatal life.This study describes the localization of androgen (AR) and progesterone (PR) receptors in the developing ovary in the spiny mouse. The immunohistochemical analysis showed for the first time the expression of AR and PR proteins in the ovary as early as in one day-old females. Both AR and PR were present in germinal epithelium cells, stromal cells as well as in the granulosa and theca layer of ovarian <e>follicles</e>. On days 7, 14, 21, 30, 60 and 90, the distribution of AR and PR depended on the stage of follicular development rather than on the animal's age. A novel observation was that PR protein was detected not only in granulosa cells of preovulatory follicles, but also in the growing and early antral follicles. It was demonstrated that there is a different pattern of AR and PR immunoexpression throughout folliculogenesis. In contrast to AR, whose expression decreased during follicular development, the PR immunostaining increased during this time. It is concluded that androgens and progesterone may play an important role in the early stage of follicular development in the spiny mouse.",M2
20337206,"Efficacy of letrozole in ovulation induction compared to that of clomiphene citrate in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome.OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy of letrozole with clomiphene citrate for ovulation induction in patients with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). STUDY DESIGN: In this clinical trial, 107 infertile patients with PCOS received either 100 mg clomiphene citrate (n = 57) or 5 mg letrozole (n = 50) daily since day 3-7 of their menstrual cycle. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered at a dose of 10,000 IU when at least 1 mature follicle was detected. A single intrauterine insemination was performed 34 hours later. Then the size, number and growth rate of <e>follicles</e>, ovulation rate, endometrial thickness and pregnancy rate were measured in both groups. RESULTS: The number and the size of mature follicles were similar between the 2 groups. The pregnancy rate in letrozole group was higher than that in the clomiphene group (20% vs. 14%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.286). In letrozole group, 86% of patients developed mature follicles, all showing ovulation, whereas 72% of patients in clomiphene citrate group developed mature follicles (p = 0.07). CONCLUSION: Letrozole might be an acceptable alternative to clomiphene citrate to induce ovulation and pregnancy in PCOS patients.",M2
20309501,"Cryobanking of human ovarian tissue for anti-cancer treatment: comparison of vitrification and conventional freezing.The first case of cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue with good survival of <e>follicles</e> after warming was described in 1996. Childbirth after cryopreservation of ovarian tissue is now a reality. Cryopreservation of ovarian tissue can be performed using one of two methods: conventional ( slow ) freezing and cryopreservation by direct plunging into liquid nitrogen (so called vitrification or  rapid  freezing). Comparative investigations of vitrification and conventional freezing performed on mammalian ovarian tissue are limited, and authors present different conclusions. The higher effectiveness of vitrification in comparison with conventional freezing for human oocytes and embryos was shown, whereas data on human ovarian tissue are limited. The aim of different studies was to compare the safety and effectiveness of conventional freezing and vitrification of human ovarian tissue. Below we shortly summarize the results of some investigations with different conclusions. The discussion on the post-warming quality of follicles as well as on the problems of microbial contamination of cells in liquid nitrogen at vitrification is presented. In our opinion, for cryopreservation of human ovarian tissue, conventional freezing is more promising than vitrification.",M2
20223607,"Post-weaning Altrenogest treatment in primiparous sows; the effect of duration and dosage on follicular development and consequences for early pregnancy.Our objective was to investigate follicle development in sows during and after different Altrenogest treatments post-weaning and relate this to subsequent ovulation rate and embryonic development. Primiparous UPB sows (n=47) were randomly assigned to (weaning=Day 0): control (no Altrenogest, n=12), RU8-15 (15 mg of Altrenogest, Day-1 till Day 7, n=12), RU8-20 (20 mg of Altrenogest, Day-1 till Day 7, n=12) or RU15-15 (15 mg of Altrenogest, Day-1 till Day 14, n=11). From weaning onwards, trans-abdominal ultrasound was performed daily. Sows were slaughtered on Day 4 or 5 after ovulation. Follicle size increased during Altrenogest treatment and reached a plateau around Day 6, regardless of dose (4.6+/-1.5, 4.6+/-1.6 and 4.6+/-1.6 mm for RU8-15, RU8-20 and RU15-15, respectively). This increase resulted in larger <e>follicles</e> (P=0.0002) at the onset of the follicular phase (i.e. time of weaning for control sows and 24h after last administration of Altrenogest for treated sows); 4.8+/-1.8, 4.8+/-1.4, 4.9+/-0.9 mm and 2.9+/-0.8, for RU8-15, RU8-20, RU15-15 and controls, respectively. Pre-ovulatory follicle size tended (P=0.07) to be larger for treated animals (7.9+/-2.4, 7.9+/-0.7, 8.6+/-1.3 and 6.9+/-0.9 mm for RU8-15, RU8-20, RU15-15 and controls, respectively). The interval follicular phase-oestrus was shorter (P=0.005) for treated animals. Treatment did not affect ovulation rate or early embryonic development. However, for treated animals, the increase in follicle size during treatment was positively related with ovulation rate (P=0.05). In conclusion, post-weaning treatment with Altrenogest of first litter sows influenced follicle size and shortened the follicular phase, but did not affect ovulation rate or early embryonic development.",M2
20222841,"The effects of Kisspeptin antibodies on delayed estrus in rats.In recent years, numerous studies have been conducted on the effects of Kisspeptin/GPR54 system on sexual cycle, which proved that this system regulated gonadotropin release through GnRH. This study aims to determine the effects of hyperimmune serum containing antibodies produced against Kisspeptin on the sexual cycle and GnRH receptors in rat pituitaries. To this end, five Wistar female rats were passively immunised using a hyperimmune serum obtained from two Wistar female rats against Kisspeptin 10. Another five rats were selected as the control group. Anti-Kisspeptin antibodies of the hyperimmunised rats in the serum were identified by ELISA. The sexual cycles of the rats were followed by the measurements of vaginal irrigations and the estradiol concentrations in their blood samples. The number of <e>follicles</e> and corpora lutea in their ovaries was determined through histopathological tests, and the GnRH receptors in their pituitaries were identified by immunohistochemistry. Consequently, strong seropositivity was detected in all passively immunised rats and the hyperimmune serum. However, no difference was found between the groups with regard to the number of estrous cycles observed, the interval between estrous periods, estradiol concentrations, the number of follicles and corpora lutea and immunohistochemical results.",M2
20219978,"Expression of E-cadherin and N-cadherin in perinatal hamster ovary: possible involvement in primordial follicle formation and regulation by follicle-stimulating hormone.We examined the expression and hormonal regulation of E-cadherin (CDH1) and N-cadherin (CDH2) with respect to primordial follicle formation. Hamster Cdh1 and Cdh2 cDNA and amino acid sequences were more than 90% similar to those of the mouse, rat, and human. Although CDH1 expression remained exclusively in the oocytes during neonatal ovary development, CDH2 expression shifted from the oocytes to granulosa cells of primordial <e>follicles</e> on postnatal day (P)8. Subsequently, strong CDH2 expression was restricted to granulosa cells of growing follicles. Cdh2 mRNA levels in the ovary decreased from embryonic d 13 through P10 with a transient increase on P7, which was the day before the appearance of primordial follicles. Cdh1 mRNA levels decreased from embryonic d 13 through P3 and then showed a transient increase on P8, coinciding with the formation of primordial follicles. CDH1 and CDH2 expression were consistent with that of mRNA. Neutralization of FSH in utero impaired primordial follicle formation with an associated decrease in Cdh2 mRNA and CDH2, but an increase in Cdh1 mRNA and CDH1 expression. The altered expression was reversed by equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment on P1. Whereas a CDH2 antibody significantly reduced the formation of primordial and primary follicles in vitro, a CDH1 antibody had the opposite effect. This is the first evidence to suggest that primordial follicle formation requires a differential spatiotemporal expression and action of CDH1 and CDH2. Further, FSH regulation of primordial follicle formation may involve the action of CDH1 and CDH2.",M2

20209431,"Intraovarian transplantation of stage I-II <e>follicles</e> results in viable zebrafish embryos.Maternal gene products drive early embryogenesis almost exclusively until the mid blastula transition (MBT) in many animal models including fish. However, the maternal contribution to embryogenesis does not stop at MBT, but continues to be an essential regulator of key developmental processes. The extent to which maternal effects contribute to embryonic and larval development is hard to estimate due to the technical difficulty of interfering with maternal gene products by conventional forward and reverse genetic tools. Therefore, novel methods to manipulate maternal factors in oocytes need to be developed. Here, we provide a proof of principle protocol for transplanting stage I-II zebrafish follicles into recipient mothers where donor stage I oocytes can develop to stage IV in 2 weeks and in 3 weeks they develop into mature eggs and produce viable offspring. Moreover, we show that simple microinjection of stage I-II follicles with RNA results in reporter gene expression in oocytes and paves the way for developing tools for interfering with maternal gene activity. This early stage oocyte transplantation protocol provides a means to study cellular and molecular aspects of oocyte development in the zebrafish.",M2
20202194,"Doxorubicin-induced ovarian toxicity.BACKGROUND: Young cancer patients may occasionally face infertility and premature gonadal failure. Apart from its direct effect on <e>follicles</e> and oocytes, chemotherapy may induce ovarian toxicity via an impact on the entire ovary. The role of doxorubicin in potential ovarian failure remains obscure. Our intention was to elucidate doxorubicin-related toxicity within ovaries. METHODS: Female mice were injected intraperitoneally with 7.5 or 10 mg/kg doxorubicin and their ovaries were visualized in vivo by high resolution MRI, one day and one month following treatment. Ovaries of other treated mice were excised and weighed at the same post-treatment intervals. Ovarian histological sections were stained for TUNEL or active caspase-3 and follicles were counted and categorized. Ovulation rates were evaluated in superovulated female mice treated with doxorubicin. RESULTS: A single injection of doxorubicin resulted in a major reduction in both ovarian size and weight that lasted even one month post treatment. A dramatic reduction in ovulation rate was observed one week after treatment, followed by a partial recovery at one month. Histological examination revealed positive staining of TUNEL and active caspase-3. We observed a significant reduction in the population of secondary and primordial follicles one month following treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results may imply a mechanism of chemotherapy-induced ovarian toxicity, manifested by reduced ovulation and accompanied by a reduction in ovarian size, caused probably by an acute insult to the ovary.",M2
20198416,"Activin A inhibits activation of human primordial <e>follicles</e> in vitro.PURPOSE: To determine whether Activin A affects the activation and survival of human primordial follicles in vitro. METHODS: Ovarian cortical biopsies from eight women undergoing elective caesarean sections or benign gynaecological procedures were taken and cut into small pieces (1-3 mm(3)), cultured in serum-free medium for 7 days with/without human recombinant Activin A at a concentration of either 50 or 100 ng/ml. Ovarian tissue were analysed by histology for follicle viability, development and density. RESULT(S): Significant activation of primordial follicles within cultured cortical tissue was observed after 7 days in control medium. However, medium supplemented with Activin A at 50 ng/ml resulted in significant inhibition of follicular activation. Increasing the concentration of Activin A to 100 ng/ml reversed the inhibitory effect. The effect of Activin A appeared to be specific to activation of non-growing (primordial) follicles into the growing population since no significant differences in follicle viability was observed between treatment groups. CONCLUSION(S): Activin A at a concentration of 50 ng/ml can inhibit the spontaneous activation of human primordial follicles in vitro indicating that this may be a component of the signalling mechanisms that maintain follicular quiescence.",M2
20189735,"Effect of estradiol benzoate used at the start of a progestagen treatment on superovulatory response and embryo yield in lactating and non-lactating llamas.Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of estradiol benzoate (EB) and intravaginal progestagen treatment on ovarian follicular dynamics and superstimulatory response in eCG-treated llamas. The purpose of Experiment 1 was to evaluate the effect of EB and progestagen treatment starting at different phases of dominant follicle (DF1) development on regression pattern and subsequent follicle wave emergence (WE2) in lactating and non-lactating llamas. Early lactating (n=24, 30+/-4 days postpartum) and non-lactating (n=24) females were assigned in equal numbers (n=8) to one of three groups according to the phase of DF1 (growing, static or regressing) determined by ultrasonography from day -3 to day 0. At day 0, llamas received an intravaginal sponge (MPA, 150 mg) and 5mg of MPA (i.m.). Half of the females (n=4) of each group were injected with 2mg (i.m.) of EB and half were not (control group). A 2 x 2 x 3 (lactational status, EB treatment and follicular phases) factorial design was used. Each sponge was removed 8 days later. Ovaries were monitored from day 0 to day 12. Daily blood samples were taken to determine 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) profiles from day 0 to day 8. The DF1 regression pattern was not affected (P&gt;0.05) by the phase of follicle wave at the start of the treatment or any interactions among main effects. Follicle wave emergence in EB-treated llamas was delayed (P&lt;0.05) by 2.3 days compared with non-treated llamas. Following EB treatment, plasma concentrations of E(2) were greater (P&lt;0.05) from day 1 to day 5 in the treated than in non-treated females, but not from day 6 onward (P&gt;0.05). Experiment 2 was designed to evaluate the effect of this treatment on the ovarian superovulatory response and embryo yield following eCG treatment administered on day of follicular wave emergence as determined in the Experiment 1. The same lactating (n=18, 61+/-4 days postpartum) and non-lactating (n=18) llamas at random stages of follicle wave were treated as those in Experiment 1 and received 1200IU of eCG at the time of WE2 (EB-treated=day 6.5 and non-treated=day 4.5). Llamas were mated 5 days after sponge withdrawal. A second mating was allowed 24h later. Embryos were collected between 7 and 8 days after the first mating and blood samples were taken to determine progesterone (P(4)) concentrations. The mean number of <e>follicles</e> on day of mating and the number of CL on day of embryo collection were not affected by lactational status, EB treatment or their interactions (P&gt;0.05). Ovulation rate and mean (+/-SEM) number of recovered embryos for EB treatment group (67.5% and 2.4+/-0.4) were greater (P&lt;0.05) than for no EB treatment (51.1% and 1.1+/-0.4). Plasma P(4) concentrations and number of CL per llama were correlated (r=0.49; P=0.014). In conclusion, progestagen plus EB treatment facilitates the prediction of the emergence of a new follicular wave approximately 6 days after treatment and resulted in a higher ovulation rate and embryo production in ovarian superstimulated llamas regardless of lactational status.",M2
20188028,"Inherent capacity of the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropins is not influenced by the number of ovarian <e>follicles</e> &gt; or = 3 mm in diameter in cattle.We hypothesised that higher serum FSH concentrations in cattle with low v. high follicle numbers during follicular waves are caused by a different capacity of the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropins. Dairy cows with high (&gt; or = 30; n = 5) and low (&lt; or = 15; n = 5) follicle numbers were selected and serum concentrations of oestradiol and FSH during an oestrous cycle were measured. Cows were ovariectomised at oestrus and bled frequently up to 8 days after ovariectomy. After 33 days, cows were injected with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and bled intensively up to 8 h after GnRH injection. One day later, animals were injected with follicular fluid (FF) from bovine follicles and were bled intensively up to 2 days after the first injection. Serum concentrations of FSH and LH were measured. After 2 days, cows were killed and their pituitary glands collected. Prior to ovariectomy, serum oestradiol concentrations were similar between groups, whereas FSH concentrations were higher in cattle with low v. high numbers of follicles. No differences were detected in serum gonadotropin concentrations after ovariectomy, GnRH injection or FF challenge between groups. The results indicate that the inherent capacity of the pituitary gland to secrete gonadotropins does not differ between cattle with high v. low numbers of follicles during follicular waves.",M2
20176726,"Induction of endothelin-2 expression by luteinizing hormone and hypoxia: possible role in bovine corpus luteum formation.The pattern and regulation of endothlin-2 (EDN2) expression and its putative roles in bovine ovaries were investigated. EDN2 mRNA was determined in corpus luteum (CL) and during folliculoluteal transition induced by GnRH in vivo. EDN2 was elevated only in the early CL and was not present in older CL. In the young CL, EDN2 mRNA was identified mainly in luteal cells but not endothelial cells that expressed the EDN1 gene. Similarly, in preovulatory <e>follicles</e>, EDN2 was expressed in the granulosa cells (GCs) and not in the vascular theca interna. LH and hypoxia are two major stimulants of CL formation. Therefore, GCs were cultured with bovine LH, under hypoxic conditions. GCs incubated with bovine LH resulted in increased EDN2 mRNA 42 h later. CoCl2, a hypoxia-mimicking agent, elevated EDN2 in GCs in a dose-dependent manner. Incubation of the human GC line (Simian virus 40 large T antigen) under low oxygen tension (1%) augmented EDN2 6 and 24 h later. In these two cell types, along with EDN2, hypoxia augmented VEGF. EDN2 induced in GCs changes that characterize the developing CL: cell proliferation as well as up-regulation of vascular endothelial growth factor and cyclooxygenase-2 (mRNA and protein levels). Human chorionic gonadotropin also up-regulated these two genes. Small interfering RNA targeting EDN-converting enzyme-1 effectively reduced its mRNA levels. This treatment, expected to lower the mature EDN2 peptide production, inhibited VEGF mRNA levels and GC numbers. Together these data suggest that elevated EDN2 in the early bovine CL, triggered by LH surge and hypoxia, may facilitate CL formation by promoting angiogenesis, cell proliferation, and differentiation.",M2
20176141,"Localization of phosphorylated SMAD proteins in granulosa cells, oocytes and oviduct of female mice.SMAD signaling is essential for follicular development. The distribution of activated (phosphorylated) SMADs during folliculogenesis has not been described in detail. The present results indicate that oocytes from preantral and antral <e>follicles</e> contain the mRNA for the receptor regulated Smads (-1, -2, -3, -5 and -9), Smad4 (co-SMAD), and Smad6 and Smad7 (inhibitory SMADs). Levels of Smad5, Smad6 and Smad7 mRNA decreased in fully-grown oocytes compared to growing oocytes. Immunostaining for pSMAD1/5/9, pSMAD2 and pSMAD3 was evident in oocytes from primordial, primary, secondary and antral follicles. We also observed substantial staining for pSMADs in intact fully-grown oocytes from antral follicles. In granulosa cells, immunostaining for both pSMAD2/3 and pSMAD1/5/9 was apparent in preantral granulosa cells from primordial to secondary follicles. In antral follicles, immunostaining for pSMADs became more intense in the cumulus cells surrounding the oocyte. Immunostaining for pSMAD2 and pSMAD1/5/9 was also apparent in the epithelium lining of the oviduct. Clearly, oocytes, preantral granulosa cells, cumulus cells and the epithelium of the oviduct are major targets of SMAD-mediated pathways in female reproductive tissues. The finding that pSMAD pathways are active in oocytes raises new questions regarding the role of TGF-beta superfamily members in directly promoting oocyte development. The extent to which defects in pSMAD signaling in oocytes or the oviduct contribute to infertility in humans or animals remains an open question.",M2
20172968,"Female mice expressing constitutively active mutants of FSH receptor present with a phenotype of premature follicle depletion and estrogen excess.Strong gain-of-function mutations have not been identified in humans in the FSH receptor (FSHR), whereas such mutations are common among many other G protein-coupled receptors. In order to predict consequences of such mutations on humans, we first identified constitutively activated mutants of the mouse (m) Fshr and then expressed them under the human anti-Müllerian hormone promoter in transgenic mice or created knock-in mutation into the mouse genome. We show here that mutations of Asp580 in the mFSHR significantly increase the basal receptor activity. D580H and D580Y mutations of mFSHR bind FSH, but the activity of the former is neither ligand-dependent nor promiscuous towards LH/human choriogonadotropin stimulation. Transgenic expression of mFshr(D580H) in granulosa cells leads to abnormal ovarian structure and function in the form of hemorrhagic cysts, accelerated loss of small <e>follicles</e>, augmented granulosa cell proliferation, increased estradiol biosynthesis, and occasional luteinized unruptured follicles or teratomas. The most affected mFshr(D580H) females are infertile with disturbed estrous cycle and decreased gonadotropin and increased prolactin levels. Increased estradiol and prolactin apparently underlie the enhanced development of the mammary glands, adenomatous pituitary growth, and lipofuscin accumulation in the adrenal gland. The influence of the mFSHR(D580Y) mutation is milder, mainly causing hemorrhagic cysts in transgenic mFSHR(D580Y) and mFSHR(D580Y) -knock-in mice. The results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations of the FSHR in mice bring about distinct and clear changes in ovarian function, informative in the search of similar mutations in humans.",M2
20172211,"Naturally occurring mastitis effects on timing of ovulation, steroid and gonadotrophic hormone concentrations, and follicular and luteal growth in cows.The effects of naturally occurring subclinical chronic or clinical short-term mastitis on time of ovulation, plasma steroid and gonadotropin concentrations, and follicular and luteal dynamics were examined in 73 lactating Holstein cows. Cows were sorted by milk somatic cell count and bacteriological examination into an uninfected group (n=22), a clinical mastitis group (n=9; events occurring 20+/-7 d before the study), and a subclinical chronic mastitis group (n=42). In addition, uninfected and mastitic cows were further sorted by their estrus to ovulation (E-O) interval. About 30% of mastitic cows (mainly subclinical) manifested an extended E-O interval of 56+/-9.2h compared with 28+/-0.8h in uninfected cows and 29+/-0.5h in the other 70% of mastitic cows. In mastitic cows with extended E-O interval, the concentration of plasma estradiol at onset of estrus was lower than that of uninfected cows or mastitic cows that exhibited normal E-O intervals (3.1+/-0.4, 5.8+/-0.5, and 5.5+/-0.5 pg/mL, respectively). The disruptive effect of mastitis on follicular estradiol probably does not involve alterations in gonadotropin secretion because any depressive effects of mastitis on pulsatile LH concentrations were not detected. Cortisol concentrations did not differ among groups. The preovulatory LH surge in mastitic cows with delayed ovulation varied among individuals, being lower, delayed, or with no surge noted compared with the normal LH surge exhibited by uninfected cows or mastitic cows with normal E-O interval (6.8+/-0.7 ng/mL). The diameter of the second-wave dominant follicle was larger and the number of medium <e>follicles</e> was smaller in uninfected and subclinical cows with normal intervals compared with subclinical cows with extended intervals (13.4+/-0.5 vs. 10.9+/-0.9mm, and 3.8+/-0.2 vs. 6.7+/-0.14 follicles, respectively). Mid-luteal progesterone concentrations were similar in uninfected and mastitic cows. These results indicate for the first time that around 30% of cows with subclinical chronic mastitis exhibit delayed ovulation that is associated with low plasma concentrations of estradiol and a low or delayed preovulatory LH surge.",M2
20170740,"A role for the lysosomal protease cathepsin B in zebrafish follicular apoptosis.This study presents evidence that cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease, may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis during serum-starvation in teleost <e>follicles</e>. Zebrafish vitellogenic follicles were isolated, incubated under serum-free conditions and homogenized. The follicle extracts demonstrated caspase-3-like activity using the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AMC, indicating the onset of apoptosis. Cathepsin B activity as measured using the fluorogenic cathepsin B substrate, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was elevated within the first 6h of incubation in serum-free media and coincided with the onset of apoptosis. This increase in cathepsin B activity was sensitive to the cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074-ME. Furthermore, adding CA-074-ME to the follicle incubation blocked caspase-3-like activation, suggesting that cathepsin B activity is a positive regulator of the apoptotic cascade during serum-starvation. Interestingly, the increase in cathepsin-B-like activity was not preceded by an increase in cathepsin B mRNA transcription, suggesting that regulation of this enzyme is at a level other than of the gene. These results suggest a regulatory role for cathepsin B during follicular apoptosis in zebrafish ovarian follicles.",M2
20166196,"Altered sex hormone concentrations and gonadal mRNA expression levels of activin signaling factors in hatchling alligators from a contaminated Florida lake.Activins and estrogens participate in regulating the breakdown of ovarian germ cell nests and follicle assembly in mammals. In 1994, our group reported elevated frequencies of abnormal, multioocytic ovarian <e>follicles</e> in 6 month old, environmental contaminant-exposed female alligators after gonadotropin challenge. Here, we investigated if maternal contribution of endocrine disrupting contaminants to the egg subsequently alters estrogen/inhibin/activin signaling in hatchling female offspring, putatively predisposing an increased frequency of multioocytic follicle formation. We quantified basal and exogenous gonadotropin-stimulated concentrations of circulating plasma steroid hormones and ovarian activin signaling factor mRNA abundance in hatchling alligators from the same contaminated (Lake Apopka) and reference (Lake Woodruff) Florida lakes, as examined in 1994. Basal circulating plasma estradiol and testosterone concentrations were greater in alligators from the contaminated environment, whereas activin/inhibin betaA subunit and follistatin mRNA abundances were lower than values measured in ovaries from reference lake animals. Challenged, contaminant-exposed animals showed a more robust increase in plasma estradiol concentration following an acute follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) challenge compared with reference site alligators. Aromatase and follistatin mRNA levels increased in response to an extended FSH challenge in the reference site animals, but not in the contaminant-exposed animals. In hatchling alligators, ovarian follicles have not yet formed; therefore, these endocrine differences are likely to affect subsequent ovarian development, including ovarian follicle assembly.",M2
20157580,"Aged mouse ovaries possess rare premeiotic germ cells that can generate oocytes following transplantation into a young host environment.Of all the major organ systems in the body, the ovaries of females are the first to exhibit impaired function with advancing age. Until recently, traditional thinking was that female mammals are provided with a non-renewable pool of oocyte-containing <e>follicles</e> at birth that are depleted during postnatal life to exhaustion, driving ovarian failure. However, a growing body of evidence, including the isolation of germline stem cells (GSC) from adult mouse ovaries that produce developmentally-competent oocytes, has challenged this belief. In addition, rare germline stem-like cells capable of generating oocytes in vitro that undergo parthenogenesis to form blastocyst-like structures have recently been identified in postmenopausal human ovaries. Here we show that the germline-specific meiosis-commitment genes,Stimulated by retinoic acid gene 8 (Stra8) and Deleted in azoospermia-like (Dazl), are highly expressed in aged mouse ovaries. However, histological and marker analyses fail to demonstrate the presence of oocytes, supporting that Stra8 and Dazl are expressed in premeiotic germ cells that do not undergo further differentiation. Through the use of aged germline-specific GFP-expressing transgenic mice, we further show that these germ cells can generate GFP-positive oocytes that co-express the primordial oocyte marker NOBOX and form follicles when grafted into young adult wild-type female hosts. Thus, aged mouse ovaries possess a rare population of premeiotic germ cells that retain the capacity to form oocytes if exposed to a young host environment.",M2
20156346,"Age-dependent role of steroids in the regulation of growth of the hen follicular wall.BACKGROUND: The ovaries are the primary targets of senescence effects in mammalian and avian species. In the present study, relationships between reproductive aging, sex steroids and the growth pattern of the pre-ovulatory follicle wall were investigated using young hens with long clutch (YLC), old hens with long clutch (OLC), old hens with short clutch (OSC), and old hens with interrupted long clutch (OILC). METHODS: Experiment 1: Hens were sacrificed 1.5 and 14.5 h after ovulation. Experiment 2: YLC and OILC hens were sacrificed 3.5 h after treatments with LH and/or aminoglutethimide (AG), an inhibitor of steroid synthesis. Volumes of pre-ovulatory <e>follicles</e> (F1-F5) and plasma concentrations of ovarian steroids were determined. Experiment 3: Granulosa and theca cells from F3 follicles of OSC and/or YLC hens were exposed in vitro to estradiol-17beta (E2), testosterone (T) and LH and the proliferative activity of the cells was examined using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Assay. RESULTS: In YLC and OLC groups, the total volume of F1-F5 follicles rose between 1.5 and 14.5 h after ovulation (P &lt; 0.01), negatively correlating with the plasma level of E2 (P &lt; 0.01). There was no growth of pre-ovulatory follicles in the middle of the ovulatory cycle in the OSC group, with a positive correlation being present between E2 and the follicular volume (P &lt; 0.05). In young hens, AG caused a rise in the total follicular volume. This rise was associated with a fall in E2 (r = -0.54, P &lt; 0.05). E2 enhanced proliferation of granulosa cells from YLC and OSC groups. The proliferative activity of granulosa and theca cells of YLC hens depended on the interaction between T and LH (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate for the first time that the growth pattern of pre-ovulatory follicles during the ovulatory cycle changes in the course of reproductive aging. E2 seems to play a dual role in this adjustment; it stimulates the growth of the follicular wall in reproductive aged hens, whereas it may inhibit this process in young birds. T and LH are apparently involved in the growth regulation during the pre-ovulatory surge in young hens.",M2
20153129,"Modulating peripheral gonadotrophin levels affects follicular expression of mRNAs encoding insulin-like growth factor binding proteins in sheep.Evidence suggests that the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are involved in modulating the role that IGF-I and -II play in regulating follicular growth and development in sheep. However, little information exists as to the role that key peripheral factors play in regulating the expression of IGFBP components within the follicle. The present study investigated the regulatory effects of FSH and LH on gene expression for IGFBP-2 to -6 in ovine <e>follicles</e>, using bovine follicular fluid (bFF) and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRHa) model systems to perturb endogenous gonadotrophin secretion. Gene expression studies were carried out using in situ hybridisation with sheep-specific ribonucleotide probes. Treatment of ewes with bFF had few consistent effects on IGFBP-3 and -4 mRNA expression in follicles, whereas bFF treatment resulted in significant decreases in IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-6 mRNA expression in only medium follicles 60 h after onset of bFF, and in follicles 12h after the onset of bFF, respectively. Treatment of ewes with GnRHa resulted in transient significantly increased IGFBP-2 mRNA in healthy follicles in comparison to early atretic or atretic follicles 12h post-GnRHa (P&lt;0.05), in IGFBP-3 mRNA in early atretic and atretic follicles 36 h post-GnRHa (P&lt;0.001), and IGFBP-5 mRNA in follicles 12h post-GnRHa (P&lt;0.001). In contrast, GnRHa treatment resulted in significant decreases in IGFBP-4 (P&lt;0.001) and IGFBP-6 (P&lt;0.01) mRNA expression in large follicles 36 h post-GnRHa, and atretic follicles by 60 h post-GnRHa, respectively. These data highlight that FSH and LH are involved, at least in part, in mediating the proliferative and differentiative changes in intrafollicular IGFBP levels that are observed during follicular growth and atresia in the sheep.",M2
20149359,"The role of autophagy in follicular development and atresia in rat granulosa cells.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the involvement of autophagy in folliculogenesis and its correlation with apoptosis. DESIGN: Animal model-based study. SETTING: University medical center. ANIMAL(S): Twenty-one day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTION(S): Ovaries obtained from established immature rat models primed with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) were used for the induction of follicular development and atresia. Granulosa cells isolated from developing <e>follicles</e> were cultured in serum-free condition with or without follicle-stimulating hormone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Microtubule-associated light-chain protein 3 (LC3) and autophagic vacuoles were used as autophagic markers, and cleaved caspase-3 was used as an apoptotic marker in ovaries and/or granulosa cells. RESULT(S): The LC3 protein was expressed mainly in granulosa cells during all developmental stages. In granulosa cells isolated from PMSG-primed immature rat ovaries, LC3-II expression showed a similar expression pattern to cleaved caspase-3. In addition, granulosa cells of atretic follicles that showed intense cleaved caspase-3 staining also showed intense LC3 immunoreactivity. An in vitro culture experiment revealed that the levels of LC3-II and cleaved caspase-3 proteins were gonadotropin-dependent. The induction and the gonadotropin dependency of granulosa cell autophagy were confirmed by the observation of autophagic vacuoles under transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary results suggest that autophagy is induced mainly in granulosa cells during folliculogenesis and shows good correlation with apoptosis.",M2
20140639,"A simple and efficient method for preparation of isolated ovarian <e>follicles</e> for transmission electron microscopy.OBJECTIVE: A simple method for preparation of isolated ovarian follicles for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) using transwell inserts is described. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pre-antral follicles were enzymatically isolated from mouse ovaries and cultured overnight on transwell insert polyester membranes. The following day, isolated ovarian follicles were processed for TEM by moving the transwell insert through successive wells containing the fixation and embedding reagents. After polymerization of the resin, the polyester membrane with the follicles embedded in the resin was disengaged from the transwell unit. The resin was sectioned. Semi-thin sections were stained with toluidine blue while ultra-thin sections were stained by uranyl acetate and examined by light microscopy and TEM, respectively. RESULTS: Isolated ovarian follicles were easily processed in groups for TEM. Follicles were well embedded and there appeared to be no loss of tissue during processing. The ultra-structure of processed isolated ovarian follicles was well preserved with little evidence of processing artifacts. CONCLUSIONS: In situ processing and preparation of isolated ovarian follicles by first allowing attachment on transwell insert membranes was shown to be a simple, rapid and effective method for TEM.",M2
20139425,"Sodium selenite improves the in vitro follicular development by reducing the reactive oxygen species level and increasing the total antioxidant capacity and glutathione peroxide activity.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of sodium selenite (SS) on reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, total antioxidant capacity (TAC) and glutathione peroxide (GPx) activity of cultured pre-antral <e>follicles</e> derived from vitrified and non-vitrified ovarian tissue. METHODS: Immature mouse ovaries were vitrified, and mechanically isolated pre-antral follicles from vitrified and non-vitrified samples were cultured in TCM 199 medium supplemented with different concentrations (0, 5 and 10 ng/ml) of SS. Follicular, oocyte and embryo development was assessed. In parallel, ROS, TAC and GPx levels were analyzed after 0, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 96 h of culture. RESULTS: Development rates of follicles, oocytes and embryos were significantly higher in SS-supplemented groups (P &lt; 0.005). ROS production was increased, and TAC levels and GPx activities were decreased after 24 h of culture of pre-antral follicles in vitrified and non-vitrified groups, whereas in the presence of SS, ROS production was decreased and TAC levels and selenium-dependent GPx-specific activities were increased after 96 h of culture. Vitrified and non-vitrified samples responded in a similar manner. CONCLUSION: SS caused an increase in follicular TAC level and GPx activity and a decrease in ROS level, thus improving the in vitro development of follicles.",M2
20138961,"Inhibitory effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide on the initial stages of rat follicle development.Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is transiently expressed in preovulatory <e>follicles</e> of different species and positively affects parameters correlated with the ovulatory process. It has also been shown to be expressed in the interstitial tissue and in interstitial glandular cells in the proximity of primordial and preantral follicles. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PACAP influences the recruitment of primordial follicles and the growth and differentiation of preantral follicles. Rat ovaries from 2-day-old animals were cultured for 5 days in the presence of PACAP. This treatment significantly inhibited the primordial to primary follicle transition. PACAP inhibited granulosa cell proliferation without affecting cell viability. PACAP also inhibited the growth of isolated preantral follicles cultured under basal conditions or in the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These results suggest that PACAP is significantly involved in the cyclic recruitment of primordial follicles and in the FSH-dependent growth of preantral follicles.",M2
20138422,"Differentiation potential of germ line stem cells derived from the postnatal mouse ovary.General belief in reproductive biology is that in most mammals female germ line stem cells are differentiated to primary oocytes during fetal development and oogenesis starts from a pool of primordial <e>follicles</e> after birth. This idea has been challenged previously by using follicle kinetics studies and demonstration of mitotically active germ cells in the postnatal mouse ovary (Johnson et al., 2004; Kerr et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). However, the existence of a population of self-renewing ovarian germ line stem cells in postnatal mammals is still controversial (Eggan et al., 2006; Telfer et al., 2005; Gosden, 2004). Recently, production of offspring from a germ line stem cell line derived from the neonatal mouse ovary was reported (Zou et al., 2009). This report strongly supports the existence of germ line stem cells and their ability to expand in vitro. Recently, using a transgenic mouse model in which GFP is expressed under a germ cell-specific Oct-4 promoter, we isolated and generated multipotent cell lines from male germ line stem cells (Izadyar et al., 2008). Using the same strategy we isolated and derived cell lines from postnatal mouse ovary. Interestingly, ovarian germ line stem cells expanded in the same culture conditions as the male suggesting that they have similar requirements for their self-renewal. After 1 year of culture and many passages, ovarian germ line stem cells maintained their characteristics and telomerase activity, expressed germ cell and stem cell markers and revealed normal karyotype. As standard protocol for differentiation induction, these cells were aggregated and their ability to form embryoid bodies (EBs) was investigated. EBs generated in the presence of growth factors showed classical morphology and expressed specific markers for three germ layers. However, in the absence of growth promoting factors EBs were smaller and large cells with the morphological and molecular characteristics of oocytes were formed. This study shows the existence of a population of germ line stem cell in postnatal mouse ovary with multipotent characteristics.",M2
20138269,"An ongoing pregnancy from two waves of <e>follicles</e> developing during a long follicular phase of the same cycle.OBJECTIVE: To report an ongoing pregnancy after in vitro fertilization (IVF) with ovarian stimulation using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist that resulted in two waves of follicular growth. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: University of Toronto affiliated infertility clinic. PATIENT(S): A 33-year-old woman with a 3-year history of secondary infertility. INTERVENTION(S): In vitro fertilization and embryo transfer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Ongoing pregnancy. RESULT(S): This patient successfully conceived after the GnRH antagonist-induced demise of the first cohort of follicles and the emergence of a second wave of follicles followed by oocyte retrieval on cycle day 30 and fresh embryo transfer. CONCLUSION(S): This case report is consistent with previous observations of multiple waves of follicle recruitment and growth per cycle. The window of implantation may not be adversely affected by prolonged or even variable estrogen exposure in the follicular phase of the cycle.",M2
20138115,"Pig preovulatory oocytes modulate cumulus cell protein and gene expression in vitro.This study investigated the changes in protein and gene expression in oocytectomized cumulus cells (OOX) of medium-sized <e>follicles</e> from gilts, cultured with or without denuded oocytes isolated from large oestrogenic sow follicles. Proteomic analysis identified 14 proteins that were differentially expressed in OOX, of which the protein 14-3-3 eta, a signal transduction pathway modulator, was down-regulated in the presence of oocytes. Oocyte co-culture also down-regulated FSHR mRNA expression in OOX, as measured by real-time PCR, and FSHR and 14-3-3 eta mRNA abundance were positively correlated. The oocyte also up-regulated HSD3B mRNA, suggesting an effect on cumulus cell progesterone synthesis. Together with data on gene expression in granulosa cells during the follicular phase of the sow oestrous cycle, this study suggests that modulation of the expression of steroidogenesis related proteins and genes in cumulus cells by the porcine preovulatory oocyte reflects the specific physiological requirements of the preovulatory follicle.",M2
20137781,"[Müllerian inhibitor substance: from gene to protein, its role in clinical practice]Müllerian inhibiting substance (MIS) has been discovered by Alfred Jost at the beginning of the fifties. MIS is a glycoprotein belonging to the TGF-beta family. Its various functions differ between males and females and according to the age of the individual. In male, the protein is synthesized by Sertoli's cells and induces the disappearance of Müllerian's ducts, the development of the male genital tract. Its role in adult males remains quite unknown. In female, the protein is secreted by granulosa cells and plays a role during folliculogenesis as it regulates the initial and cyclic recruitment of ovarian <e>follicles</e>. MIS is also a good marker of follicular reserve and ovarian function. Therefore, it plays a role in different areas such as assisted medical reproduction and oncology. This protein represents a potential major diagnosis as well as prognostic tool in reproduction.",M2
20132558,"Differential genome-wide gene expression profiling of bovine largest and second-largest <e>follicles</e>: identification of genes associated with growth of dominant follicles.BACKGROUND: Bovine follicular development is regulated by numerous molecular mechanisms and biological pathways. In this study, we tried to identify differentially expressed genes between largest (F1) and second-largest follicles (F2), and classify them by global gene expression profiling using a combination of microarray and quantitative real-time PCR (QPCR) analysis. The follicular status of F1 and F2 were further evaluated in terms of healthy and atretic conditions by investigating mRNA localization of identified genes. METHODS: Global gene expression profiles of F1 (10.7 +/- 0.7 mm) and F2 (7.8 +/- 0.2 mm) were analyzed by hierarchical cluster analysis and expression profiles of 16 representative genes were confirmed by QPCR analysis. In addition, localization of six identified transcripts was investigated in healthy and atretic follicles using in situ hybridization. The healthy or atretic condition of examined follicles was classified by progesterone and estradiol concentrations in follicular fluid. RESULTS: Hierarchical cluster analysis of microarray data classified the follicles into two clusters. Cluster A was composed of only F2 and was characterized by high expression of 31 genes including IGFBP5, whereas cluster B contained only F1 and predominantly expressed 45 genes including CYP19 and FSHR. QPCR analysis confirmed AMH, CYP19, FSHR, GPX3, PlGF, PLA2G1B, SCD and TRB2 were greater in F1 than F2, while CCL2, GADD45A, IGFBP5, PLAUR, SELP, SPP1, TIMP1 and TSP2 were greater in F2 than in F1. In situ hybridization showed that AMH and CYP19 were detected in granulosa cells (GC) of healthy as well as atretic follicles. PlGF was localized in GC and in the theca layer (TL) of healthy follicles. IGFBP5 was detected in both GC and TL of atretic follicles. GADD45A and TSP2 were localized in both GC and TL of atretic follicles, whereas healthy follicles expressed them only in GC. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated that global gene expression profiling of F1 and F2 clearly reflected a difference in their follicular status. Expression of stage-specific genes in follicles may be closely associated with their growth or atresia. Several genes identified in this study will provide intriguing candidates for the determination of follicular growth.",M2
20105525,"Effects of dietary fats differing in n-6:n-3 ratio fed to high-yielding dairy cows on fatty acid composition of ovarian compartments, follicular status, and oocyte quality.The objectives were to determine the incorporation of dietary encapsulated fats differing in n-6:n-3 ratio into milk fat, plasma, and various ovarian compartments and to examine the effects on ovarian follicular status, preovulatory follicle characteristics, and oocyte quality. Twenty-four multiparous Israeli Holstein cows, averaging 114 d in milk, were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) control (n=7), in which cows were fed a lactating cow diet; 2) E-FLAX (n=8), in which cows were fed a lactating cow diet that consisted of 1kg/d of encapsulated fat (3.8% of dry matter) containing 40.8% flaxseed oil, providing 242.2g of C18:3n-3 (low n-6:n-3 ratio); or 3) E-SUN (n=9), in which cows were fed a lactating cow diet that consisted of 1kg/d of encapsulated fat (3.8% of dry matter) containing 40.8% sunflower oil, providing 260.0g of C18:2n-6 (high n-6:n-3 ratio). Ovaries were monitored by ultrasonography for follicular status, and after synchronization, <e>follicles</e> &gt;7mm were aspirated and evaluated. Ovum pickup was performed (19 sessions for the control and E-FLAX groups and 11 for the E-SUN group), and in vitro maturation and oocyte fertilization were conducted. The E-FLAX treatment increased the proportions of C18:3n-3 (5.8 fold), C20:5n-3, and C22:5n-3 (approximately 4-fold) in milk fat as compared with the other 2 treatments. The proportion of C18:3n-3 fatty acid in plasma increased dramatically with the E-FLAX treatment, from 1.43 and 1.49% in the control and E-SUN groups, respectively, to 7.98% in the E-FLAX group. Consequently, the n-6:n-3 ratio in plasma was reduced from approximately 42 in the control and E-SUN groups to 6.74 in the E-FLAX group. Proportions of C18:3n-3 in follicular fluid and granulosa cells were approximately 5-fold higher in the E-FLAX group than in the other 2 groups. The percentage of C18:2n-6 in cumulus-oocyte complexes of cows in the E-SUN group was 54% higher than that in the E-FLAX group and was 2.4-fold higher than that in the control group; the proportion of C18:3n-3 in the E-FLAX group was 4.73% and was not detected in the other groups. The average numbers of 2- to 5-mm follicles on d 5 and 9 of the cycle were higher in the E-FLAX group than in the E-SUN group, whereas the average numbers of follicles &gt; or =10mm on d 5, 9, and 13 were higher in the E-SUN group than in the other 2 groups. The estrous cycles of the cows were synchronized and PGF(2alpha) was injected on d 16 to 17 of the cycle. The interval from PGF(2alpha) injection to behavioral estrus was longer in the E-FLAX group than in the E-SUN group, and the beginning of the luteal phase of the subsequent cycle was delayed. Concentrations of estradiol in follicular fluid of the preovulatory follicles were higher in the E-SUN group than in the E-FLAX group. The number of follicles aspirated by ovum pickup was higher in the E-FLAX group than in the control group, and the cleavage rate in the E-FLAX group was higher than in the control group, but not the E-SUN group. In conclusion, dietary n-3 fatty acids influenced the follicular status and increased the cleavage rate of oocytes as compared with those of control cows. These findings could be related to modifications of the fatty acid composition in plasma and ovarian compartments in response to dietary supplementation.",M2
20091563,"Interventions for 'poor responders' to controlled ovarian hyper stimulation (COH) in in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).BACKGROUND: The success of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) depends on adequate follicle recruitment by using controlled ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins. Failure to recruit adequate <e>follicles</e> is called 'poor response'. Various treatment protocols have been proposed that are targeted at this cohort of women, aiming to increase their ovarian response. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of different treatment interventions in women who have poor response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (are poor responders) in the context of IVF. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials (MDSG) (5/1/2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (4th Quarter 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to November week 3 2008), EMBASE (1980 to 2008 week 52) and The National Research Register (NRR). The citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, abstracts of scientific meetings and included studies were also searched. The authors were contacted to clarify data that were unclear from the trial reports. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one type of intervention versus another for controlled ovarian stimulation of poor responders to a previous IVF treatment, using a standard long protocol were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently scanned the abstracts, identified relevant papers, assessed trial quality and extracted relevant data for inclusion. Validity was assessed in terms of method of randomisation, completeness of treatment cycle and co-intervention. Where possible, data were pooled for analysis. MAIN RESULTS: The new search identified fifteen trials. Three trials were eligible for inclusion. Ten trials involving eight different comparison groups have been included. Only one trial reported live birth rates.The number of oocytes retrieved were significantly less in the conventional GnRHa long protocol compared to stop protocol and GnRH antagonist protocol.Total dose of gonadotrophins used was significantly higher in the GnRHa long protocol group compared to the Stop protocol and GnRH antagonist groups.Cancellation rates were significantly higher in the GnRHa flare up group compared to the GnRHa long protocol group.None of the studies reported a difference in the miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any particular intervention either for pituitary down regulation, ovarian stimulation or adjuvant therapy in the management of poor responders to controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF. More robust data from good quality RCTs with relevant outcomes are needed.",M2
20080874,"Thrombospondin-1 inhibits angiogenesis and promotes follicular atresia in a novel in vitro angiogenesis assay.Thrombospondin-1 (TSP-1) is a putative antiangiogenic factor, but its role in regulating physiological angiogenesis is unclear. We have developed a novel in vitro angiogenesis assay to study the effect of TSP-1 on follicular angiogenesis and development. Intact preantral/early antral <e>follicles</e> dissected from 21-d-old rat ovaries were cultured for 6 d in the presence or absence of TSP-1. At the end of the culture period, angiogenic sprouting from the follicles was quantified using image analysis. Follicles were fixed and sectioned, and follicular apoptosis was assessed by immunohistochemistry for activated caspase-3 in granulosa cells. The results showed that TSP-1 inhibited follicular angiogenesis (P &lt; 0.01) and promoted follicular apoptosis (P &lt; 0.001) in a dose-dependent manner. To determine whether the proapoptotic activity of TSP-1 is mediated by direct effects on granulosa cells, isolated granulosa cells were cultured with TSP-1 (0, 10, 100, and 1000 ng/ml) for 48 h. Apoptosis was quantified using a luminescent caspase-3/7 assay. TSP-1 promoted apoptosis of granulosa cells in a dose-dependent manner (P &lt; 0.05), suggesting that TSP-1 can act independently of the angiogenesis pathway to promote follicular apoptosis. These results show that TSP-1 can both inhibit follicular angiogenesis and directly induce apoptosis of granulosa cells. As such, it may have potential as a therapeutic for abnormal ovarian angiogenesis and could facilitate the destruction of abnormal follicles observed in polycystic ovary syndrome.",M2
20079584,"Luteal function induced by transvaginal ultrasonic-guided follicular aspiration in mares.Ultrasonic-guided transvaginal follicle aspiration was performed in 58 crossbreed mares in order to determine whether aspiration of various dominant follicle diameters resulted in luteal tissue capable of producing progesterone (P(4)). The mares were randomly assigned to three groups according to follicular diameter (25-29 mm; 30-35 mm and &gt;35 mm). Mares that had ovulations naturally served as controls. The serum progesterone (P(4)) concentrations in the aspirated mares were greater (P &lt; 0.0001; r(2) = 0.6687; CV = 21.52) in mares with natural ovulation compared to mares with aspirated <e>follicles</e> regardless of groups. Serum P(4) concentration in aspired mares with follicular diameter of 25-29 mm declined 0.365 ng/ml/day (P = 0.0065) from the day of aspiration (D0) up to D8. In mares with follicle diameter of 30-35 mm, serum P(4) concentration increased (0.258 ng/ml/day; P = 0.001), as well as in the mares with follicles &gt;35 mm diameter (0.481 ng/ml/day; P &lt; 0.0001), and in mares with natural ovulation (1.236 ng/ml/day; P &lt; 0.0001). Out of the 25 mares with follicular aspirations that formed Corpora hemorragica (P(4) &gt;1 ng/ml), 23 (92%) had greater (&gt;2 ng/ml) serum P(4) concentrations on Day 8 after aspiration. Of these 23 mares, 75% were in the 25-29 mm group, 9/10 (90%) in the 30-35 mm group, and 11/11 (100%) of the mares in the &gt;35 mm follicular diameter group had luteinization (P(4) &gt;2 ng/ml). These results suggest that a functional Corpus luteum can be induced in mares using follicular aspiration and that a minimum 35 mm follicular diameter is needed to reach a progesterone serum concentration compatible with that of a Corpus luteum produced by natural ovulation.",M2
20074846,"Protective effect of a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogue on chemotherapeutic agent-induced ovarian gonadotoxicity: a mouse model.OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the protective effect of triptorelin, a GnRH analogue, on chemotherapy-induced ovarian gonadotoxicity. STUDY DESIGN: Twenty-four sexually mature, virgin, female FVB/NJNarl mice were divided into four groups: busulfan (B); low-dose triptorelin plus busulfan (T(L)+B); high-dose triptorelin plus busulfan (T(H)+B); and control. Mice in the T(L)+B and T(H)+B groups were injected with 3.8 and 38 mg/kg of triptorelin subcutaneously, respectively. Four weeks later, mice in the B, T(L)+B, and T(H)+B groups were injected with busulfan intraperitoneally at a dose of 36 mg/kg. Histologic examinations were performed 4 weeks later. RESULTS: Obvious destruction of ovarian structure and significant depletion of primordial, primary, and secondary <e>follicles</e> were demonstrated in the B group compared with the control group, affirming the gonadotoxicity of busulfan. In the T(L)+B group, a greater number of larger primordial and primary follicles were enumerated compared with the B group; however, statistical significance was not achieved. In the T(H)+B group, the number of primordial and primary follicles was significantly greater than in the B group, and the ovarian tissue in the T(H)+B group was spared, demonstrating the effect of triptorelin pre-treatment on ovarian protection. CONCLUSION: Our results have demonstrated a dose-dependent protective effect against gonadotoxic chemotherapy of a GnRH analogue on ovarian reserve, thus suggesting a novel application of GnRH analogues in fertility preservation.",M2
20074723,"Markers of growth and development in primate primordial <e>follicles</e> are preserved after slow cryopreservation.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of slow cryopreservation on the morphology and function of primate primordial follicles within ovarian tissue slices. DESIGN: Fresh monkey ovarian tissue was frozen by slow cryopreservation and thawed for analysis of morphologic and functional parameters. SETTING: University-affiliated laboratory. ANIMALS: Rhesus monkey ovarian tissue. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Histologic analysis, follicle counting, assessment of protein abundance and localization. RESULT(S): After freezing and thawing, 89% of the primordial follicles maintained their laminar-based architecture, with sizes close to those of fresh fixed follicles. Molecular markers of early follicle health (activin subunits and the phosphorylated form of the signaling protein Smad2 [pSmad2]) were present in fresh and frozen-thawed primordial follicles. Stroma cells, but not follicles, had a higher level of TUNEL staining. Granulosa cells within the follicles of frozen-thawed ovarian tissue cultured for 48 hours had the capacity to proliferate and sustained expression of the activin subunits and nuclear pSmad2. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides evidence that markers of early follicle growth and development are preserved after slow cryopreservation and thaw, with little effect on follicle morphology and function.",M2
20071017,"Ovarian follicular dynamics, follicle deviation, and oocyte yield in Gyr breed (Bos indicus) cows undergoing repeated ovum pick-up.The objective of this study was to evaluate ovarian follicular dynamics during intervals between successive ovum pick-up (OPU) and determine its effects on the number and quality of recovered cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in Zebu cows (Bos indicus). Pluriparous nonlactating Gyr cows (Bos indicus; n=10) underwent four consecutive OPU sessions at 96-h intervals. The dynamics of ovarian follicular growth between OPU sessions was monitored by twice-daily ultrasonographic examinations. A single dominant follicle (DF) or two codominant (CDF) <e>follicles</e> (&gt;9mm) were present in 63.3% (19 of 30) of intervals studied, with follicle deviation beginning when the future dominant follicle (F1) achieved a diameter of 6.2+/-0.3mm. The phenomenon of codominance was observed in four (13.3%) of the inter-OPU intervals. The remaining intervals (36.6%, 11 of 30) were characterized by a greater follicular population, lower rate of follicular growth, and a smaller diameter F1 (P&lt;0.0001). There was a tendency (P=0.08) toward an increase in the number of recovered COCs when dominant follicles were not present (NDF). The quality of COCs was not affected by the presence of a single dominant follicle, but codominant follicles resulted in recovery of a lower proportion of viable embryos (40.0%, 62.1%, and 63.6%; P&lt;0.05) and higher proportions of degenerate COCs (56.0%, 30.3%, and 28.6%; P&lt;0.05) for CDF, NDF, and DF respectively. We concluded that, in Zebu cows, (a) repeated follicle aspirations altered ovarian follicular dynamics, perhaps by increasing follicular growth rate; (b) follicular dominance could be established in cows undergoing twice-a-week OPU; and (c) the presence of a dominant follicle during short inter-OPU intervals may not affect COC quality, except when a codominant follicle was present.",M2
20064216,"Intact fetal ovarian cord formation promotes mouse oocyte survival and development.BACKGROUND: Female reproductive potential, or the ability to propagate life, is limited in mammals with the majority of oocytes lost before birth. In mice, surviving perinatal oocytes are enclosed in ovarian <e>follicles</e> for subsequent oocyte development and function in the adult. Before birth, fetal germ cells of both sexes develop in clusters, or germline cysts, in the undifferentiated gonad. Upon sex determination of the fetal gonad, germ cell cysts become organized into testicular or ovarian cord-like structures and begin to interact with gonadal somatic cells. Although germline cysts and testicular cords are required for spermatogenesis, the role of cyst and ovarian cord formation in mammalian oocyte development and female fertility has not been determined. RESULTS: Here, we examine whether intact fetal ovarian germ and somatic cell cord structures are required for oocyte development using mouse gonad re-aggregation and transplantation to disrupt gonadal organization. We observed that germ cells from disrupted female gonad prior to embryonic day e13.5 completed prophase I of meiosis but did not survive following transplantation. Furthermore, re-aggregated ovaries from e13.5 to e15.5 developed with a reduced number of oocytes. Oocyte loss occurred before follicle formation and was associated with an absence of ovarian cord structure and ovary disorganization. However, disrupted ovaries from e16.5 or later were resistant to the re-aggregation impairment and supported robust oocyte survival and development in follicles. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we demonstrate a critical window of oocyte development from e13.5 to e16.5 in the intact fetal mouse ovary, corresponding to the establishment of ovarian cord structure, which promotes oocyte interaction with neighboring ovarian somatic granulosa cells before birth and imparts oocytes with competence to survive and develop in follicles. Because germline cyst and ovarian cord structures are conserved in the human fetal ovary, the identification of genetic components and molecular mechanisms of pre-follicle stage germ and somatic cell structures may be important for understanding human female infertility. In addition, this work provides a foundation for development of a robust fetal ovarian niche and transplantation based system to direct stem cell-derived oocyte differentiation as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of infertility.",M2
20057162,"Endocrine traits of polycystic ovary syndrome in prenatally androgenized female Sprague-Dawley rats.Although hyperandrogenism is an important condition and is considered the possible pathogenesis behind polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), data supporting this is still scarce. We sought to determine whether or not prenatal androgen exposure leads to PCOS and the possible cellular mechanisms involved. To induce prenatal androgen exposure, pregnant rats were treated with daily subcutaneous injections of free testosterone (T) or dihydrotestosterone (DHT) from embryonic days 16 to 19, and their female offspring were studied as adults. The mRNA expression of the progesterone receptor (PR) in the preoptic area (POA) hypothalamus was higher in the experimental groups than in the control group after ovariectomy and stimulation with estradiol benzoate. The levels of T, P, leutinizing hormone (LH), and estradiol were higher in the experimental groups than in the control groups. The frequency and magnitude of LH secretion was increased in experimental rats as compared with the control group. The anogenital distance of the experimental groups was prolonged and the nipple number was lower than that of the control group. Almost all experimental rats had prolonged or irregular estrous cycles. The experimental groups had fewer corpus luteum and preovulatory <e>follicles</e> and more preantral follicles and antral follicles than the controls. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that excess androgen during the prenatal period may cause PCOS. Additionally, we show that hyperandrogenic interference in the release of preovulatory LH surges is mediated by the suppressive effects of androgens on PR expression in POA-hypothalamic tissue.",M2
20056831,"Kit ligand and the somatostatin receptor antagonist, BIM-23627, stimulate in vitro resting follicle growth in the neonatal mouse ovary.In the mammalian ovary, kit ligand (KL), coded by a cAMP-stimulatable gene, is a protein that promotes initiation of follicle growth. The neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) is a small peptide that inhibits cAMP generation in many cell types. Consequently, SST receptor agonists might alter KL production and subsequent follicle growth. The present study was undertaken to look for the existence of a functional SST system in the mouse ovary, to test the effects of the SST receptor 2 (SSTR-2) antagonist BIM-23627 on in vitro folliculogenesis, and to compare them with those of KL, which was demonstrated to stimulate follicle growth in the neonatal rat ovary. Pairs of ovaries from 5-d-old mice were incubated in vitro during 15 d in the presence of either KL or BIM-23627. For every mouse, one ovary was cultured in culture medium (control), and the other ovary was cultured in the presence of either KL or BIM-23627. After 5, 10, and 15 d culture, the ovaries were histologically assessed for the content of primordial, primary, and secondary <e>follicles</e>. The SSTR-2 and -5, but not SST, were identified at the transcriptional and translational (mainly in granulosa cells) levels. Both KL and BIM-23627 triggered a reduction of the percentages of primordial follicles and an increase of the percentages of primary and secondary follicles when compared with control ovaries from the same animal. In conclusion, extraovarian SST, acting through its receptors 2 and 5 present on granulosa cells, may be involved in mouse folliculogenesis by reducing recruitment of resting follicles.",M2
20056201,"Acquisition and loss of oocyte meiotic and developmental competence during in vitro antral follicle growth in mouse.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of various culture periods and FSH on oocyte competence in cultured mouse <e>follicles</e>. DESIGN: Controlled in vitro laboratory experiment. SETTING: Academic research environment. INTERVENTION(S): DNA staining, maturation induction, parthenogenesis, and IVF were performed after various periods of oocyte culture. Additionally, FSH modulation during preantral follicle growth was studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Nucleolar conformation, meiotic resumption, activation potential, and preimplantation development were recorded. RESULT(S): Surrounded nucleolus (SN) conformation was found in oocytes cultured for 8 days and correlated by time with meiotic competence. Culture for 12 days increased oocyte diameter (day 8 69.8 mum vs. day 12 72.4 mum) and meiotic competence (day 8 63% vs. day 12 81% polar body oocytes), but decreased fertilization rate (day 8 75% vs. day 12 53% 2-cell embryos). Equal activation potential (49%) on both days indicated that impaired sperm entry could not account for lower fertilization rate after 12 days. Depriving early follicular growth of FSH delayed antrum formation but not SN conformation. CONCLUSION(S): Fertilization of cultured oocytes is most efficient close to the completion of SN. Omitting FSH from early follicle growth could not postpone the early onset of SN, which seems to be imposed by the time spent in vitro.",M2
20050770,"Egg formation in lepidoptera.Reproductive biology in the Twentieth Century produced comprehensive descriptions of the mechanisms of egg formation in most of the major orders of insects. While many general principles of ovarian development and physiology emerged, every order turned out to have a set of its own special motifs. Discovery of the lepidopteran motifs is summarized in this essay. The emphasis is on developmental mechanisms, beginning with the early growth and differentiation of female germ cells and ending, after many turns in morphogenesis, physiology and biosynthesis, with eggs that are filled with yolk and encased in chorions. Examples of uniquely lepidopteran traits include the cellular composition of ovarian <e>follicles</e>, the number of tubular ovarioles in which they mature, the functions of cell-to-cell junctional complexes in their maturation, their use of glycosaminoglycans to maintain intercellular patency during vitellogenesis, the role of proton and calcium pumps in their ion physiology, a separate postvitellogenic period of water and inorganic ion uptake, and the fine structure and protein composition of their chorions. Discovery of this combination of idiosyncracies was based on advances in the general concepts and techniques of cell and molecular biology and on insights borrowed from studies on other insects. The lepidopteran ovary in turn has contributed much to the understanding of egg formation in insects generally.",M2
20047754,"Changes in the gene expression of adiponectin and adiponectin receptors (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in ovarian follicular cells of dairy cow at different stages of development.Adiponectin is one of the most important, recently discovered adipocytokines that acts at various levels to control male and female fertility through central effects on the hypothalamus-pituitary axis or through peripheral effects on the ovary, uterus, and embryo. We studied simultaneous changes in the gene expression pattern of adiponectin and adiponectin receptors 1 and 2 (AdipoR1 and AdipoR2) in granulosa and theca cells, cumulus-oocyte complex, and in corpus luteum in healthy bovine (Bos tarus) <e>follicles</e> at different stages of development. The expression levels of adiponectin, AdipoR1, and AdipoR2 mRNA were lower (P&lt;0.05) in granulosa and cumulus cells in comparison with that in theca cells and oocyte. In contrast with the oocyte, AdipoR1 in granulosa, theca, and luteal cells was expressed (P&lt;0.05) more than AdipoR2. Adiponectin expression increased (P&lt;0.05) in granulosa cells and in cumulus-oocyte complex during follicular development from small to large follicles. Opposite results were observed in theca cells. Expression of adiponectin was highest in the late stages of corpus luteum (CL) regression, whereas lower expression was recorded in active CL (P&lt;0.05). AdipoR1 and AdipoR2 expression increased during the terminal follicular growth in granulosa and theca cells (P&lt;0.05) and during the luteal phase progress in CL. There was positive correlation between adiponectin mRNA level in granulosa cells from large follicles and follicular fluid estradiol concentration (r=0.48, P&lt;0.05) and negative correlation between adiponectin mRNA abundance in theca cells and follicular fluid progesterone concentration (r=-0.44, P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, we found that the physiologic status of the ovary has significant effects on the natural expression patterns of adiponectin and its receptors in follicular and luteal cells of bovine ovary.",M2
20042232,"The expression of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors in ovarian <e>follicles</e> throughout the estrous cycle in the ewe.Healthy follicles are highly vascularized whereas those undergoing atresia have poor vascularity, suggesting a relationship between follicular vascularization and follicular function. Vascularization is regulated by angiogenic factors, and among them vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-Tie (Ang-Tie) systems are of central importance. The objectives of this study were to determine if VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and components of the Ang-Tie system are expressed in ovarian follicles at both the protein and mRNA levels and to explore if their expression is related to the stage of the estrous cycle in the ewe. Ovaries from cyclic ewes were collected during the luteal phase (n=5) or before (n=5), during (n=4), and after (n=4) the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. After fixation, ovaries were wax-embedded, serially sectioned, and analyzed for both protein and mRNA expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Tie-1 (mRNA only), and Tie-2. mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled ovine riboprobes. A similar pattern of expression was observed for mRNA and protein for all of the factors. Both mRNA and protein expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-1 (mRNA only), and Tie-2 in the granulosa and theca cells of follicles &gt;or=2mm in diameter was significantly different among the stages of the estrous cycle, with the highest expression detected at the post-LH surge stage. Theca cells expressed significantly greater levels of the six angiogenic factors compared with granulosa cells at all stages of the estrous cycle. Expression levels in granulosa and theca cells were comparable between small (2.0 to 2.5mm) and medium (2.5 to 4.0mm) follicles, but large follicles (&gt;4.0mm) expressed higher mRNA and protein levels (all P&lt;0.05) for all factors at all stages of the estrous cycle. These data show (i) that VEGF, VEGFR-2, and the Ang-Tie system are present in both granulosa and theca cells of the ovarian follicle, (ii) that thecal cells consistently express greater levels of all of these factors compared with granulosa cells, and (iii) that their levels of expression are related to the stage of the estrous cycle and to follicle size.",M2
20036087,"Transvaginal follicular aspiration and embryo development in superstimulated early postpartum beef cows and subsequent fertility after artificial insemination.This study was conducted to investigate in early postpartum suckled beef cows with and without FSH pre-stimulation: (i) the influence of the postpartum period on the number and quality of oocytes recovered by ovum pick-up (OPU), (ii) the overall efficiency of the OPU/IVP embryos from days 30 to 80 postpartum and (iii) if repeated OPU negatively affect fertility following a fixed-time artificial insemination protocol. After parturition suckled Angus cows (n = 30) were divided in three groups (n = 10 group(-1)). All cows were anestrous at the commencement of experimental treatments (30.0 +/- 3.2 days postpartum, mean +/- SD; range 25-34 days). Group 1 treatments included: dominant follicle ablation (DFA), FSH treatment and OPU procedure 5 days after DFA. A total of 9 mg FSH (Ovagen) was administered s.c. once a day over 2 days at equal doses (4.5 + 4.5mg). For fertility test the cows received an intravaginal progesterone treatment from Days 78 to 86 postpartum and were fixed-time artificially inseminated (FTAI) at 56 and 72 h after device removal. Group 2: as cited for Group 1 with no FSH treatment. In both groups, OPU was repeated four times (Days 35, 49, 63 and 77 postpartum) and the collected oocytes classified as viable were in vitro matured, fertilized and presumptive embryos cultured for 8 days. Group 3 (Control FTAI): cows that had not previously aspirations were FTAI as Groups 1 and 2. Pregnancy was diagnosed by means ultrasonography 39 days after FTAI. The numbers (mean +/- SEM) of <e>follicles</e> visible and aspirated at the time of OPU in FSH-treated cows were greater (P &lt; 0.05) than in non-treated cows (10.6 +/- 0.6 and 8.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 8.0 +/- 0.5 and 4.6 +/- 0.3, respectively). Following FSH treatment, the number (mean +/- SEM) of recovered oocytes per cow per OPU session and percentage of viable oocytes were greater in the treated (P &lt; 0.05) than in non-treated animals (3.0 +/- 0.1 and 39.5% vs. 1.5 +/- 0.1 and 30.0%). The cleavage and embryo development rates were similar (P &gt; 0.05) for both groups (14.8 and 6.4% vs. 16.6 and 5.5%). After FTAI the pregnancy rates were not different (P &gt; 0.05) among groups (70, 60 and 90% for Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively). We can conclude that (1) FSH-treated suckled postpartum cows can be a source of oocytes for in vitro fertilization and (2) repeated DFA/OPU applied during postpartum period did not affect the subsequent fertility following FTAI.",M2
20033367,"Increased ovarian follicle atresia in obese Zucker rats is associated with enhanced expression of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1.It is well established that hyperinsulinemia, resulting from insulin resistance, plays a role in the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aim of this study was to investigate if ovarian follicular development and atresia are impaired in obese hyperinsulinemic (fa/fa) Zucker rats. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of follicular atresia, we also examined the expression and localization of forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, a major regulator of cell fate decisions such as differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, and cell death. Serum insulin but not gonadotropin levels were significantly higher in obese (fa/fa) rats when compared to lean controls. Total ovarian follicle number and the percentage of atretic <e>follicles</e> were also significantly increased in obese (fa/fa) rats. Follicle atresia was associated with nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 transcription factor in TUNEL-positive granulosa cells. These results suggest a role for FOXO1 in granulosa cell apoptosis and increased ovarian follicle atresia associated with hyperinsulinemia.",M2
20033213,"Dynamics of extracellular matrix in ovarian <e>follicles</e> and corpora lutea of mice.Despite the mouse being an important laboratory species, little is known about changes in its extracellular matrix (ECM) during follicle and corpora lutea formation and regression. Follicle development was induced in mice (29 days of age/experimental day 0) by injections of pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin on days 0 and 1 and ovulation was induced by injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin on day 2. Ovaries were collected for immunohistochemistry (n=10 per group) on days 0, 2 and 5. Another group was mated and ovaries were examined on day 11 (n=7). Collagen type IV alpha1 and alpha2, laminin alpha1, beta1 and gamma1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2 and perlecan were present in the follicular basal lamina of all developmental stages. Collagen type XVIII was only found in basal lamina of primordial, primary and some preantral follicles, whereas laminin alpha2 was only detected in some preantral and antral follicles. The focimatrix, a specialised matrix of the membrana granulosa, contained collagen type IV alpha1 and alpha2, laminin alpha1, beta1 and gamma1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2, perlecan and collagen type XVIII. In the corpora lutea, staining was restricted to capillary sub-endothelial basal laminas containing collagen type IV alpha1 and alpha2, laminin alpha1, beta1 and gamma1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2, perlecan and collagen type XVIII. Laminins alpha4 and alpha5 were not immunolocalised to any structure in the mouse ovary. The ECM composition of the mouse ovary has similarities to, but also major differences from, other species with respect to nidogens 1 and 2 and perlecan.",M2
20032061,"Testosterone induces redistribution of forkhead box-3a and down-regulation of growth and differentiation factor 9 messenger ribonucleic acid expression at early stage of mouse folliculogenesis.Increasing evidence has shown that excess androgen may be a main cause of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, the molecular mechanism of androgen action on the ovary is unclear. To investigate the possible impacts of androgen on early follicular development, neonatal mouse ovaries mainly containing primordial <e>follicles</e> were cultured with testosterone. We demonstrated that the number of primary follicles was increased after 10 d culture with testosterone treatment via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Androgen induced Forkhead box (Foxo)-3a activation, and translocation of Foxo3a protein from oocyte nuclei to cytoplasm, which might be a key step for primordial follicle activation. Interestingly, testosterone was also capable of down-regulating growth and differentiation factor-9 expression via its receptor. In summary, we infer that intraovarian excess androgen in PCOS might result in excess early follicles by inducing oocyte Foxo3a translocation and follicular arrest by down-regulating growth and differentiation factor-9 expression.",M2
20032053,"Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) genes are expressed in the steroidogenic cells of the ovine ovary and are differentially regulated by members of the transforming growth factor-beta family.Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins act during embryogenesis and development to repress gene transcription required for lineage commitment, while promoting cell growth. Growth factors belonging to the TGFbeta superfamily of signaling molecules, notably the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and activin, can regulate Id expression in these tissues. Id expression and function in adult physiology is less well determined, and we hypothesized a role for Id proteins in the adult mammalian ovary. Immunohistochemistry for Id1, Id2, Id3, and Id4 in the sheep ovary revealed consistent expression in granulosa and thecal cells of ovarian <e>follicles</e> throughout development. In atretic follicles, Id proteins were selectively down-regulated in thecal cells (P &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, Id1 was universally up-regulated in the cumulus cells adjacent to the oocyte. Immunohistochemistry for phospho (p)-smad 1/5/8 signaling components (stimulated by BMPs) showed a punctate pattern of expression whereas p-smad 2/3 (stimulated by activin) was ubiquitously expressed in follicles. Neither pathway, however, displayed differential staining in line with Id1 cumulus-specific expression, suggesting a more complex relationship between Id1 expression and TGFbeta signaling in these cells. Nevertheless, in vitro, stimulation of ovine granulosa cells with BMP6 or activin A led to a respective increase and decrease in Id1 (P &lt; 0.0001), Id2 (P &lt; 0.0001), Id3 (P &lt; 0.0001), and Id4 (P &lt; 0.05) transcripts, and Id1 gene expression was further manipulated by the oocyte-secreted factors BMP15 and growth differentiation factor 9 (P &lt; 0.001). These data confirm that TGFbeta signaling can regulate Id gene expression in the sheep ovarian follicle and suggest a functional role for the Id family in the mammalian ovary.",M2
20031956,"Effects of exogenous testosterone supplementation in gonadotrophin stimulated cycles.BACKGROUND: Various experiments suggest that ovarian follicular recruitment and growth may be increased by testosterone priming. Our aim was to determine the effects of exogenous testosterone supplementation in older women on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis. METHODS: A prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study was carried out. Twelve regularly menstruating non-obese women aged 38-45 years received a 12-day course of transdermal testosterone (2.5 mg per patch) or placebo patch, followed by 7 days of gonadotrophin stimulation. After at least a 1 month washout period, subjects underwent the same protocol using the opposite treatment. The main outcomes were follicular development (ultrasound measures) and hormone levels. RESULTS: Following gonadotrophin stimulation, there were no differences in average number of <e>follicles</e> over 10 mm diameter in cycles pre-treated with testosterone versus placebo [2.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11, 3.22) versus 2.08 (95% CI 1.03, 3.14), P = 0.55]. No crossover, period (first or second test) or sequence (order of treatment) effects were noted. As expected, total and free testosterone levels were increased following testosterone treatment (312.7 +/- 122.4 versus 12.3 +/- 4.5 ng/dl and 45.5+/- 16.7 versus 1.4 +/- 0.5 ng/dl, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) but no differences in free or total testosterone were noted by period. LH, FSH, estradiol and antral follicle counts before gonadotrophin stimulation were not altered by testosterone pretreatment or by period. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased testosterone levels, a short course of androgens had no significant effect on the number of follicles over 10 mm during stimulation with FSH in women of late reproductive age.",M2
20031196,"Effect of equine chorionic gonadotropin on the efficiency of superovulation induction for in vivo and in vitro embryo production in the cat.The effects of various dosages of equine chorionic gonadotropin (eCG) on superovulation induction for in vivo and in vitro embryo production were examined in stray cats (Felis catus). Cats (n=286) were allocated into five treatment groups with 0, 50, 100, 200, or 400 IU eCG, followed by 100 IU human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG). In vivo- and in vitro-produced blastocysts were obtained by artificial insemination (AI) and in vitro fertilization (IVF), somatic cell nucleus transfer (SCNT), or parthenogenetic activation (PA). The percentage of cats that developed mature <e>follicles</e>, the percentage of cats with collected embryos, and the mean number of in vivo blastocysts per cat were higher in the 200 IU treatment group (43.9%, 31.8%, and 1.53, respectively) compared with those of the other groups (P&lt;0.05). The percentage of follicular developed cats, the percentage of cumulus-expanded oocytes, and the mean number of collected cumulus-oocyte complexes per cat in the 200 IU (56.7%, 67.8%, and 26.2, respectively) and 400 IU (53.3%, 64.2%, and 26.7, respectively) groups were higher than those in the other groups (P&lt;0.05). Furthermore, the percentage of in vitro-produced blastocyst per cleaved embryos and the average cell number of the blastocysts from IVF (52.7% and 125.8, respectively) was higher than those of the blastocysts from PA (30.1% and 85.2) and higher than those of the blastocysts from SCNT (15.3% and 37.5; P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the current study demonstrated that in vivo and in vitro embryo production were affected by the dosage of eCG; the best results were obtained with 200 IU.",M2
20031022,"Ongoing pregnancies from early retrieval of prematurely developing antral <e>follicles</e> after DHEA supplementation.Two patients with severely diminished ovarian reserve who were refractory to aggressive ovarian stimulation conceived with oocytes from prematurely developing antral follicles after dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation. The first patient had 11 and 14.5 mm, and the second patient had 13 mm antral follicles on cycle days 2 and 3 respectively. In the first case, no ovarian stimulation was performed, while the second case received one dose of gonadotrophins with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist. Following very early human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) triggering on cycle day 5, when antral follicles reached 15 and 18.5 mm in the first case, and 19 mm in the second case, IVF intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment resulted in pregnancies in both cases, which are currently ongoing at 35 and 14 weeks of gestation. The results in these patients show that pregnancy can be achieved in poor responder patients with prematurely developing antral follicles following early HCG triggering based on follicle size rather than cycle day, with no or minimal stimulation. Whether DHEA supplementation had any impact on the success of these cycles remains to be determined.",M2

Detection of apoptosis was performed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labelling assay. p53 and BCL2 proteins were assessed by immunohistochemistry. Quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction was performed to evaluate BAX , BAK , BCL2 , BCL-XL , survivin and beta-actin ( ACTB ) expression. The p53 protein was positive in a significantly higher number of secondary <e>follicles</e>, whereas the B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) protein was positive in all follicles in unaffected tissue of endometriotic women, compared with the controls. Overexpression of the BCL2 and survivin genes and a decreased BAX and BAK gene expression were observed in the endometriotic group although only the difference in survivin expression was significant (P = 0.016). The BCL2 / BAX ratio showed an increased value in the ovarian cortex in controls compared with endometriosis patients. In conclusion, the reduction of apoptosis in unaffected tissue in women with endometriosis suggests that they may be predisposed to develop endometriosis.",M2
20029826,"Developmental competence of morphologically poor oocytes in relation to follicular size and oocyte diameter in the pig.The objective of this study was to assess the practical usefulness of morphologically poor oocytes (MPCOCs) in relation to follicular size and oocyte diameter. Oocytes collected from medium (3-8 mm in diameter) and small (&lt;3 mm) <e>follicles</e> were classified into five categories of morphologically good oocytes (MGCOCs) from medium follicles (MA, control), MPCOCs with larger and smaller diameters from medium follicles (ML and MS, respectively), and those from small follicles (SL and SS, respectively). The oocytes were examined for maturation and developmental competence after parthenogenesis and somatic cell nuclear transfer (SCNT). Nuclear maturation of ML oocytes (91%) was similar to that of control oocytes (94%), but higher than MS (80%), SL (79%), and SS (63%) oocytes. This pattern was also observed in the intracellular glutathione level, p34(cdc2) kinase activity, and gene (CDK1, PCNA, and ERK2) expression levels in in vitro-matured oocytes. ML oocytes showed a similar proportion of blastocyst formation (20%) after SCNT to control oocytes (21%). In addition, the use of ML oocytes resulted in a 50% farrowing rate with 1.8% efficiency of piglet production after SCNT embryo transfer, while control oocytes showed a 60% farrowing rate with 2.4% production efficiency. Our results demonstrate that MPCOCs, if appropriately selected, have a comparable ability to MGCOCs in supporting not only in vitro blastocyst formation, but also development to term in vivo after SCNT. These oocytes can be used as a source for in vitro production of embryos with normal in vivo viability in pigs.",M2
20022436,"Ovarian follicular dynamics and hormonal secretory profiles in guanacos (Lama guanicoe).The objective of the present study was to describe ovarian activity in 11 adult non-mated guanacos, evaluated every second day for 40 days by transrectal ultrasonography and by plasma estradiol-17beta and progesterone concentrations. An inverse relationship (r = -0.29, P &lt; 0.001) was observed between the diameter of the largest ovarian follicle and the total number of <e>follicles</e> indicating that follicular growth in guanacos occurs in waves. The mean duration of follicular wave was 15.1 +/- 4.2 days with a range from 9 to 26. The follicular growth phase was 7.0 +/- 2.4 days, the static phase 3.0 +/- 1.2 days, the regression phase 5.2 +/- 2.1 days and the inter-wave interval was 12.6 +/- 5.6 days. The maximum follicular diameter in each follicular wave was 10.2 +/- 2.1 mm with a range from 7.2 to 16.1 mm. Inter-wave intervals of longer duration were associated with a larger maximum follicle diameter (P &lt; 0.001). Follicular activity alternated between ovaries in 93% of the waves with 48% of dominant follicles occurring in the left and 52% in the right ovary without differences (P &gt; 0.05). Plasma estradiol-17beta concentrations showed a wave-like pattern, varying from 20.0 to 92.1 pmol/L. Plasma progesterone concentrations remained below 1 nmol/L without any ultrasonic evidence of ovulation during the study. These results in guanacos suggest a follicular wave pattern more similar to the llama (Lama glama) than previously described in other South American and Old World camelid species.",M2
20018358,"Ovarian stimulation with follicle-stimulating hormone under increasing or minimal concentration of progesterone in dairy cows.The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the presence or absence of Corpus luteum (CL) on the follicular population during superstimulation in dairy cows (Holstein-Friesian cattle). Animals were divided into two groups as follows: (1) Growing CL group (G1): Cows (n=7) received a total dose of 28 Armour units (AU) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through the first 4 d (twice daily) after spontaneous ovulation (Day 0). (2) CL Absence group (G2): Cows (n=10) received prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) at 9 or 10 d after ovulation. After 36h, all the <e>follicles</e> (larger than 5mm) were aspirated (Day 0). The FSH treatment started 24h after aspiration and continued for 4 d. The number of small (3 to &lt;5mm), medium (5 to &lt;8mm), and large (&gt; or = 8mm) follicles was examined on Days 1, 3, and 5 in all groups. Blood samples were collected daily for 5 d, and progesterone (P(4)), estradiol (E(2)), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and growth hormone (GH) in plasma were measured by enzyme immunoassays. The results showed that in G1, the P(4) level increased gradually from 0.5 ng/mL at Day 1 to 2 ng/mL at Day 5, whereas in G2, the P(4) level was completely below 0.5 ng/mL. All cows of the G2 group showed an increase of E(2) at Day 3 or Day 4 followed by an increase of IGF-1 within 24h, while GH increased concomitantly with the E(2) increase in 8 of 10 trials. On the other hand, cows of the G1 group showed neither E(2) nor IGF-1 increase. Moreover, at the end of the treatment, the number of follicles in the G2 group was significantly increased compared with that of the G1 group (22.8+/-2.0 vs. 11.6+/-2.0). In conclusion, low P(4) level during FSH treatment enhanced multiple follicular growth and E(2) secretion, which was followed by increase of IGF-1 and GH. Therefore, the absence of the CL may play a critical role in the superovulation response by controlling the number of growing follicles.",M2
20014130,"Steady-state level of kit ligand mRNA in goat ovaries and the role of kit ligand in preantral follicle survival and growth in vitro.The aims of this study were to investigate steady-state level of Kit Ligand (KL) mRNA and its effects on in vitro survival and growth of caprine preantral <e>follicles</e>. RT-PCR was used to analyze caprine steady-state level of KL mRNA in primordial, primary, and secondary follicles, and in small (1-3 mm) and large (3-6 mm) antral follicles. Furthermore, ovarian fragments were cultured for 1 or 7 days in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM(+)) supplemented with KL (0, 1, 10, 50, 100, or 200 ng/ml). Noncultured (control) and cultured fragments were processed for histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RT-PCR demonstrated an increase in steady-state level of KL mRNA during the transition from primary to secondary follicles. Small antral follicles had higher steady-state levels of KL mRNA in granulosa and theca cells than large follicles. After 7 days, only 50 ng/ml of KL had maintained the percentage of normal follicles similar to control. After 1 day, all KL concentrations reduced the percentage of primordial follicles and increased the percentage of growing follicles. KL at 10, 50, 100, or 200 ng/ml increased primary follicles, compared to MEM(+) after 7 days. An increase in oocyte and follicular diameter was observed at 50 ng/ml of KL. TEM confirmed ultrastructural integrity of follicles after 7 days at 50 ng/ml of KL. In conclusion, the KL mRNAs were detected in all follicular categories. Furthermore, 50 ng/ml of KL maintained the integrity of caprine preantral follicle cultured for 7 days and stimulated primordial follicle activation and follicle growth.",M2
20013789,"Posthatching development of Alligator mississippiensis ovary and testis.We investigated ovary and testis development of Alligator mississippiensis during the first 5 months posthatch. To better describe follicle assembly and seminiferous cord development, we used histochemical techniques to detect carbohydrate-rich extracellular matrix components in 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 5-month-old gonads. We found profound morphological changes in both ovary and testis. During this time, oogenesis progressed up to diplotene arrest and meiotic germ cells increasingly interacted with follicular cells. Concomitant with <e>follicles</e> becoming invested with full complements of granulosa cells, a periodic acid Schiff's (PAS)-positive basement membrane formed. As follicles enlarged and thecal layers were observed, basement membranes and thecal compartments gained periodic acid-methionine silver (PAMS)-reactive fibers. The ovarian medulla increased first PAS- and then PAMS reactivity as it fragmented into wide lacunae lined with low cuboidal to squamous epithelia. During this same period, testicular germ cells found along the tubule margins were observed progressing from spermatogonia to round spermatids located within the center of tubules. Accompanying this meiotic development, interstitial Leydig cell clusters become more visible and testicular capsules thickened. During the observed testis development, the thickening tunica albuginea and widening interstitial tissues showed increasing PAS- and PAMS reactivity. We observed putative intersex structures in both ovary and testis. On the coelomic aspect of testes were cell clusters with germ cell morphology and at the posterior end of ovaries, we observed  medullary rests  resembling immature testis cords. We hypothesize laboratory conditions accelerated gonad maturation due to optimum conditions, including nutrients and temperature. Laboratory alligators grew more rapidly and with increased body conditions compared with previous measured, field-caught animals. Additionally, we predict the morphological maturation observed in these gonads is concomitant with increased endocrine activities.",M2
20009084,"Sustained activity of the EGF receptor is an absolute requisite for LH-induced oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion.Mammalian reproduction depends on the release of a mature oocyte from the ovarian follicle. Maturation of the oocyte and rupture of the follicle wall constitute part of the responses to the preovulatory surge of LH, which also include cumulus expansion and granulosa cell luteinization. It was previously shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates the ovulatory response to LH in the ovarian follicle. We hypothesized that it is a sustained activity of the EGFR that generates oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion. We demonstrated that, whereas a transient exposure of rat isolated, intact, preovulatory <e>follicles</e> to either LH or forskolin was sufficient to induce oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion, these LH-induced responses were only generated upon a prolonged activity of the EGFR. In addition, the continuous activity of the EGFR is essential for the chronic phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 downstream signaling molecules, which were shown to be essential for oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion. Interestingly, EGFR-sustained activity was also necessary to maintain the up-regulation of Ptgs2, a gene essential for cumulus expansion. The unusual prolonged duration of ERK1/2 activity may possibly be attributed to the late induction of the ERK-specific phosphatase 3, demonstrated herein. These new data shed light on the unique characteristics of EGFR-ERK1/2 activity in the ovarian follicle and emphasize the fact that the ovulatory process involves a nonclassical activation of this pathway.",M2
20007639,"Inhibition of oocyte growth factors in vivo modulates ovarian folliculogenesis in neonatal and immature mice.Growth differentiation factor-9 (GDF9) and bone morphogenetic protein-15 (BMP15) are among the key regulators transmitting the signaling between the oocyte and the surrounding granulosa cells. Previously, it has been shown that a recombinant BMP type II receptor ectodomain-Fc fusion protein (BMPR2ecd-Fc) is able to inhibit the actions of GDF9 and BMP15 in vitro. Here, we have produced bioactive BMPR2ecd-Fc, which was injected i.p. into neonatal mice. Early folliculogenesis was first studied by injecting mice five times with various doses of BMPR2ecd-Fc during the postnatal days 4-12. Folliculogenesis was affected dose dependently, as evidenced by a decreased mitogenesis of granulosa cells of the growing <e>follicles</e>. Furthermore, we also noticed a decrease in the number of secondary and tertiary follicles as well as an increase in the oocyte size. Electron microscopic analysis revealed that the ultrastructure of the granulosa cells of the primary follicles was not affected by the BMPR2ecd-Fc treatment. A second study was conducted to investigate whether a longer treatment with 12 injections during postnatal days 4-28 would inhibit folliculogenesis. Similar effects were observed in the two studies on the early follicular developmental stages. However, in the long-term study, later stages of folliculogenesis were not blocked but rather increased numbers of antral follicles, preovulatory follicles, and corpora lutea were found. We conclude that BMPR2ecd-Fc is a potent modulator of ovarian folliculogenesis in vivo, and thus, is a valuable tool for studying the physiology and downstream effects of oocyte-derived growth factors in vivo.",M2
20004373,"A novel two-step strategy for in vitro culture of early-stage ovarian <e>follicles</e> in the mouse.OBJECTIVE: To develop an in vitro strategy to support the growth of early-stage follicles and produce mature oocytes competent for fertilization. DESIGN: Whole ovaries from 8-day-old mice were cultured for 4 days, and then secondary follicles were isolated and cultured for 12 days in a three-dimensional alginate or fibrin-alginate (FA) hydrogel matrix. SETTING: University-affiliated laboratory. ANIMALS: Mice. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histologic evaluation of follicle development, steroid hormone production, and rates of oocyte maturation, oocyte fertilization, and embryo formation. RESULT(S): Culture of 8-day-old mouse ovaries for 4 days resulted in transition of the follicle population from primordial and primary follicles to secondary follicles, similar to that seen in a 12-day-old ovary. Isolated secondary follicles cultured for 12 days showed larger increases in oocyte diameter and more frequent antrum formation and theca cell differentiation in the FA-hydrogel matrix compared with the alginate matrix. Steroid hormone secretion patterns were consistent with the changes in follicle morphology and cell differentiation observed in the cultured follicles. Compared with oocytes from alginate follicle cultures, a greater number of oocytes retrieved from the FA-based follicle cultures progressed to metaphase I, reached metaphase II, and could be fertilized and cleaved to two-cell embryos. The organ culture plus FA-hydrogel follicle culture strategy produced a very high rate of oocyte progression to metaphase II (88 +/- 8.7% [mean +/- SEM]) and formation of two-cell embryos (54 +/- 4%). CONCLUSION(S): A strategy combining whole ovary culture of early-stage follicles and subsequent FA hydrogel in vitro follicle culture produced a high percentage of oocytes competent for fertilization; this might provide new options for fertility preservation in women and prepubertal girls facing fertility-threatening diseases or treatments.",M2
20003852,"New approaches to superovulation and embryo transfer in small ruminants.The present paper reviews the current state of knowledge in multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) technology in small ruminants, focusing on recently reported information. Major new findings are related to follicular wave patterns in small ruminants, the elucidation of follicular dominance and the integration of this information into ovarian superstimulatory treatment protocols. Follicular dynamics determine steroid and gonadotrophin secretion, follicular responses to FSH, ovulatory responses and embryo yield. Protocols that control follicular dominance have been designed to allow the initiation of superstimulation at the beginning of a follicular wave. New approaches consist of (1) synchronisation of ovulation for superstimulation during Wave 1 (i.e. Day 0 protocol), (2) pretreatment with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist from 10 days prior to FSH treatment to avoid follicular dominance and (3) progesterone-oestradiol cotreatment to synchronise follicle wave emergence. These protocols provide a homogeneous pool of small <e>follicles</e> that are gonadotrophin responsive, enhancing the superovulatory response and embryo yield with a reduction in the incidence of unovulated follicles and early regression of corpora lutea. In addition, the rate of fertilisation failure has been reduced by using an inducer of ovulation (i.e. GnRH) associated with intrauterine insemination. In summary, the application of recently acquired knowledge has resulted in relevant improvements in MOET programmes in small ruminants.",M2
20003840,"Coordinated regulation of follicle development by germ and somatic cells.The continuum of folliculogenesis begins in the fetal ovary with the differentiation of the oogonia and their isolation within the primordial <e>follicles</e>. Primordial follicle activation is an enigmatic process, whereby some follicles enter the growing pool to become primary follicles, thereby embarking on an irreversible progression towards ovulation or atresia. This process is under the coordinated regulation of factors from the oocyte itself, as well as from the somatic cells of the ovary, in particular the theca and granulosa cells, which are structural components of the follicle. These two influences provide the principal stimuli for the growth of the follicle to the late preantral or early antral stage of development. The endocrine effects of the gonadotrophins FSH and LH are essential to the continued progression of the follicle and most atresia can be attributed to the failure to receive or process the gonadotrophin signals. The peri-ovulatory state has received intensive investigation recently, demonstrating a coordinated role for gonadotrophins, steroids, epidermal growth factor family proteins and prostaglandins. Thus, a complex programme of coordinated interaction of governing elements from both germ and somatic cell sources is required for successful follicle development.",M2
19996554,"Formation of primordial <e>follicles</e> and immunolocalization of PTEN, PKB and FOXO3A proteins in the ovaries of fetal and neonatal pigs.The assembly of primordial follicles and subsequent development and transition of the primordial follicle to the primary follicle are critical processes in ovarian biology. In order to examine follicle formation and development in fetal and neonatal pigs, ovarian samples were obtained from a famous local breed of Chinese pigs, Erhualian pigs, ranging in age from 50 days postcoitum to 1 day postpartum in our current study. Morphological changes in the ovaries of the fetal and neonatal pigs indicated that egg nests were the earliest recognizable gamete cells. The proportion of egg nests decreased from 98.4 to 25.6% and the proportion of single follicles increased from 1.6 to 74.4% between 70 and 90 days postcoitum. The proportions of primordial follicles increased between 70 and 90 days postcoitum but decreased from 90 days postcoitum to 1 day postpartum. Our results suggested that the key stage of primordial follicle formation was between 70 and 90 days postcoitum and that the major stage of transition from primordial follicles into primary follicles was between 90 days postcoitum and 1 day postpartum. Experiments were also conducted to examine the localization of PTEN, PKB and FOXO3A proteins in the porcine ovaries by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. The results indicated that PTEN, PKB and FOXO3A were localized in the germ cells of egg nests, cytoplasm of oocytes and granulosa cells of follicles ranging from the primordial to secondary stages and that the staining intensity was weak in granulosa cells but strong in oocytes. The different staining patterns of PTEN, FOXO3A and PKB suggested that these proteins were expressed in a stage- and cell-specific manner during ovarian follicle formation and development in the fetal and neonatal pig.",M2
19950080,"Histomorphology of prepuberal ovaries in the South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis Zimmerman, 1783).The South American fur seal reproductive histophysiology is scarcely described. This study provides a histological description of prepuberal South American fur seal (Arctocephalus australis) ovaries as well as three-dimensional reconstructions of subcapsular crypts and primordial <e>follicles</e>. Ovaries from fresh dead animals were processed for histology and sliced into serial sections. A portion of the superficial cortex was photographed, and the images were processed using BioVis3d software in order to generate 3-dimensional reconstructions. A. australis prepuberal ovaries conform to the basic structure of pinnipedian species, with a subcapsular crypts system made up of interconnecting cisternae and tubules with multiple openings to the surface. Generally, the primordial follicles were arranged in a monolayer beneath the tunica albuginea and were closely associated with subcapsular crypts. The large number of interstitial cells distributed throughout the cortex was the main histological feature in comparison with previous reports in other seals. Three-dimensional reconstructions modelled the subcapsular crypts microarchitecture and showed the close spatial relationship between the crypts and the primordial follicles. Despite the fact that the general ovarian histological structure was similar to that of other pinnipeds, the large number of interstitial cells is a distinctive feature that raises the question about the origin and function in A. australis with regard to the steroidogenic activity reported in other seal species.",M2
19950063,"[New strategies for fertility preservation in young women with cancer]Especially young women with cancer face rising survival rates due to remarkable progress in oncologic therapies. Preserving fertility is a major concern for both patients and their next of kin. Well established reproductive technologies such as cryopreservation of fertilized oocytes after in vitro fertilization already make fertility preservation possible for some patients. This review is dedicated to the emerging techniques that are becoming widely accepted for fertility preservation in young women and girls with cancer, such as auto transplantation of ovarian tissue cryopreservation and in vitro maturation (IVM) of either oocytes or <e>follicles</e>.

19948890,"Regulation of epithelial stem cell replacement and follicle formation in the Drosophila ovary.Though much has been learned about the process of ovarian follicle maturation through studies of oogenesis in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, less is known about how <e>follicles</e> form initially. In Drosophila, two somatic follicle stem cells (FSCs) in each ovariole give rise to all polar cells, stalk cells, and main body cells needed to form each follicle. We show that one daughter from each FSC founds most follicles but that cell type specification is independent of cell lineage, in contrast to previous claims of an early polar/stalk lineage restriction. Instead, key intercellular signals begin early and guide cell behavior. An initial Notch signal from germ cells is required for FSC daughters to migrate across the ovariole and on occasion to replace the opposite stem cell. Both anterior and posterior polar cells arise in region 2b at a time when approximately 16 cells surround the cyst. Later, during budding, stalk cells and additional polar cells are specified in a process that frequently transfers posterior follicle cells onto the anterior surface of the next older follicle. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms that underlie stem cell replacement and follicle formation during Drosophila oogenesis.",M2
19938958,"Assessment of estrogen receptors and apoptotic factors in cryopreserved human ovarian cortex.The aims of this study were: (i) to examine frozen-thawed ovarian tissues for features of follicular health and atresia by histology; (ii) to assess the expression of estrogen receptors alpha (ERalpha) and beta (ERbeta) by real-time PCR; (iii) to evaluate the Bax/Bcl-2 ratio, as an apoptotic index, in the ovarian tissues before and after cryopreservation. Ovarian cortical biopsies were obtained from 11 patients. The fragments were subdivided into two groups, fresh (control tissues) and cryopreserved tissues obtained by direct plunging into liquid nitrogen. Both tissue groups were subjected to a histological evaluation of the healthy and atretic <e>follicles</e>, immunohistochemical localization of the ER, and a real-time PCR (qPCR) to evaluate the expression of ER, Bax, Bcl-2 as well as beta-actin, as control gene. Damage was observed in 31% of primordial, 45% of primary, and 75% of secondary follicles in the cryopreserved tissue group. The qPCR analysis showed that the level of ERbeta was greater in fresh than cryopreserved tissues, whereas the ERalpha expression and Bax/Bcl-2 ratio were similar in both tissue groups. A significant inverse association was observed between ERalpha mRNA levels in the fresh tissue group and subjects' ages. The results show that cryopreservation and thawing of human ovarian tissue does not affect the morphology of primordial or primary follicles and that cryopreservation does not affect apoptosis. However, cryopreservation seems to have an inhibitory effect on the level of ERbeta. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the differential effects of freezing follicles at different stages of follicular development and ovarian steroidogenesis.",M2

19933430,"Effect of dietary crude protein source on hormone and follicle characteristics in beef heifers.Ground, raw soybeans (SB), or dried distillers grain plus solubles (DDGS) were utilized in heifer development diets to determine the effect of dietary fat and protein source on hormone and follicle characteristics and ADG. The experiment was conducted over 2 yr with 100 June-born heifers (199 +/- 2 kg initial BW, n = 50 per yr). The experimental periods were 157 and 207 d in yr 1 and 2, respectively. Heifers were provided a dietary supplement (DM basis) of 1.23 kg of SB and 0.40 kg of corn or 1.65 kg of DDGS between weaning and breeding. Estrus was synchronized with 2 injections of PGF(2alpha) 14 d apart. Dominant <e>follicles</e> were measured and aspirated via transvaginal ultrasonography 60 h after the second PGF(2alpha) injection. Heifers were exposed to bulls beginning 14 d after aspiration for 45 d. Heifer ADG was greater (P = 0.02) for DDGS heifers in yr 1, but was similar (P = 0.47) in yr 2. However, there was no difference (P = 0.35) in final BW in either year. There was no difference (P &gt;or= 0.67) in follicle size, follicle hormone concentrations, or pregnancy rate (88%) between yr 1 and 2. Serum estrogen at 48 or 60 h after PGF(2alpha) injection were similar (P &gt;or= 0.91); however, LH at 60 h in yr 2 tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for DDGS heifers. The percentage of heifers experiencing an LH surge 48 and 60 h after PGF(2alpha) injection was not affected (P &gt;/= 0.40) by treatment. Calf production was not affected (P &gt;or= 0.20) by developmental diet. In summary, DDGS and SB have similar effects on hormone and follicle characteristics at the inclusion rates used in these studies.",M2
19933312,"The differential transcriptome and ontology profiles of floating and cumulus granulosa cells in stimulated human antral <e>follicles</e>.Communication between various ovarian cell types is a prerequisite for folliculogenesis and ovulation. In antral follicles granulosa cells divide into two distinct populations of mural and cumulus granulosa cells (CGC), enveloping the antrum and surrounding the oocyte, respectively. Both cell types, with the mural compartment in excess, contribute to the floating granulosa cell (FGC) population in the follicular fluid. The aim of this study was to compare the transcriptomes of FGC and CGC in stimulated antral follicles obtained from 19 women undergoing IVF-ICSI procedure. FGC were obtained from follicular fluid during the follicle puncture procedure and CGC were acquired after oocyte denudation for micromanipulation. Gene expression analysis was conducted using the genome-wide Affymetrix transcriptome array. The expression profile of the two granulosa cell populations varied significantly. Out of 28 869 analysed transcripts 4480 were differentially expressed (q-value &lt; 10(-4)) and 489 showed &gt; or =2-fold difference in the expression level with 222 genes up-regulated in FGC and 267 in CGC. The transcriptome of FGC showed higher expression of genes involved in immune response, hematological system function and organismal injury, although CGC had genes involved in protein degradation and nervous system function up-regulated. Cell-to-cell signalling and interaction pathways were noted in both cell populations. Furthermore, numerous novel transcripts that have not been previously described in follicular physiology were identified. In conclusion, our results provide a solid basis for future studies in follicular biology that will help to identify molecular markers for oocyte and embryo viability in IVF.",M2
19920068,"Insulin resistance and free androgen index correlate with the outcome of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in non-PCOS women undergoing IVF.BACKGROUND: The dual effects of insulin and androgen on the ovary act to promote early folliculogenesis. In the context of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the presence of hyperinsulinaemia, resulting from increased insulin resistance (IR), and hyperandrogenaemia lead to the appearance of multiple antral <e>follicles</e> and frequently a multi-follicular response to gonadotrophin stimulation for assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs). The effect of IR and androgen status in women without PCOS on the follicular outcome of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) is not known. METHODS: We assessed the IR [using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)] and androgen status of 49 women without PCOS undergoing an ART cycle. This was then related to the treatment cycle outcome. RESULTS: We found a significant positive correlation between HOMA and BMI, and free androgen index (FAI) and testosterone. The FAI significantly positively correlated with total follicle count after COH. The total follicle count was significantly higher in those with a HOMA &gt;2.5, and HOMA positively correlated with total follicle count in this group of IR women (HOMA &gt; 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a positive correlation of HOMA-IR levels above a threshold level of 2.5 and a continuous positive correlation of free androgen (FAI) to total ovarian follicle count following COH in the non-PCOS patient.",M2

The pre-ovulatory estradiol peak occurred 2 days before the pre-ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, while the follicle stimulating hormone surge started concomitantly with the LH surge in both cloned dogs. Serum progesterone levels increased during proestrus and estrus and its concentration on the day of the LH surge was 3.59 and 2.71 ng/ml in Clones A and B, respectively. Gradual follicular growth was observed by ultrasonography during proestrus.

19913438,"Mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of mammalian primordial <e>follicles</e>.To preserve the length of a woman's reproductive life it is essential that the majority of her ovarian primordial follicles are maintained in a quiescent state to provide a reserve for continuous reproductive success. The mechanisms maintaining the dormancy and survival of primordial follicles have been a mystery for decades. In recent years information provided by genetically modified mouse models has revealed a number of molecules whose functions are indispensable for the maintenance of follicular quiescence (including PTEN, Tsc1, Tsc2, Foxo3a, p27) and survival (PI3K signaling). Here we summarize this updated information, which hopefully will lead to a better understanding of the pathophysiology of the human ovary and provide potential therapeutic options for some types of infertility.",M2
19913288,"Xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice to study ovarian follicular development in domestic animals.Nowadays, in vitro study of follicular dynamics of primordial and primary follicular stages is limited because in vitro culture systems for these <e>follicles</e> are lacking, both in domestic animal species and in human. Therefore, additional insights might be generated by grafting ovarian tissue into immunodeficient mice to study activation and maturation of early follicular stages. A considerable amount of data has already been gathered in laboratory animals and through clinical application of human assisted reproduction technologies where live births were reported recently after the use of (cryopreserved) ovarian grafts. However, given that human preantral follicles are difficult to obtain and that there are many similarities between the bovine and human species with regard to ovarian physiology, the bovine model offers exciting additional prospects and is therefore discussed in more detail. This review will focus on recent developments related to preantral follicle and (repeated) ovarian tissue retrieval and xenotransplantation of (bovine) ovarian tissue strips to immunodeficient mice as a model to study preantral follicular dynamics. Different grafting strategies will be discussed as well as the consequences of this procedure on the viability and dynamic behavior of the grafted tissue and follicles.",M2
19909591,"Dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation improves ovarian response and cycle outcome in poor responders.The effect of dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) supplementation on cycle outcome was assessed in patients with poor ovarian response. In total, 19 poor responder patients who were scheduled to undergo a second intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI)/embryo transfer cycle were enrolled and first ICSI/embryo transfer cycles were taken as the control group. All subjects were given DHEA supplementation (25 mg t.i.d.) for at least 3 months prior to their second ICSI/embryo transfer cycle. In both cycles a fixed dose of rFSH (300 IU/day) and human menopausal gonadotrophin (HMG) (75 or 150 IU/day) along with a flexible gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist protocol were administered. A favourable decrease was noted in mean day 3 serum oestradiol concentrations after DHEA supplementation (75.14 +/- 28.93 versus 43.07 +/- 11.77; P &lt; 0.01). Increased number of &gt;17 mm <e>follicles</e> (3 +/- 0.7 versus 1.9 +/- 1.3; P &lt; 0.05), MII oocytes (4 +/- 1.8 versus 2.1 +/- 1.8; P &lt; 0.05), top quality day 2 (2.2 +/- 0.8 versus 1.3 +/- 1.1; P &lt; 0.05) and day 3 embryos (1.9 +/- 0.8 versus 0.7 +/- 0.6; P &lt; 0.05) were achieved in DHEA-supplemented cycles. Cycle cancellation rates were reduced (5.3% versus 42.1%; P &lt; 0.01), and the pregnancy rate per patient and clinical pregnancy rate per embryo transfer (47.4% versus 10.5%; P &lt; 0.01 and 44.4% versus 0%; P &lt; 0.01) were improved after DHEA supplementation. DHEA supplementation might enhance ovarian response, reduce cycle cancellation rates and increase embryo quality in poor responders.",M2
19908249,"The expression of leptin and its receptor during different physiological stages in the bovine ovary.Leptin, the hormonal product of the obese (ob) gene, circulates in the blood at levels paralleling those of fat reserves and regulates satiety. In cattle, leptin has also been implicated in the control of ovarian function, but its local production in the ovary and role in the control of ovarian function in autocrine/paracrine manner is unknown. The aims of this study were to document the expression of leptin and its receptor (Ob-R) in detail in bovine corpus luteum (CL) obtained from different stages of the oestrous cycle and during pregnancy-and to determine if the leptin/Ob-R system is expressed clearly in bovine <e>follicles</e> during final growth to preovulatory follicles. Real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) was applied to investigate mRNA expression of examined factors. In general, we demonstrated leptin and its receptor transcripts and leptin protein are consistent with in vivo luteinisation of bovine CL and decline coincidental with luteal regression. The highest co-expression of leptin/Ob-R system was observed in TI and GC of the smallest follicles with E2 concentration &lt;0.5 ng/ml followed by significant down regulation in growing follicles with the increase of follicular size and E2 content in the follicular fluid. Furthermore, expression of the leptin/Ob-R system does not show any significant variation in the CL throughout pregnancy. To conclude, our results are the first to demonstrate the possible involvement of locally produced leptin/Ob-R system in the bovine ovary, suggesting roles in the function and/or development of the CL and growth of small follicles in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.",M2
19908149,"Differential distribution of cAMP-dependent protein kinase isoforms in the mantle of the bivalve mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis.Two different isoforms of the regulatory (R) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), named R(myt1) and R(myt2), had previously been identified in the sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. R(myt1) and R(myt2) were differentially distributed in the various cell types comprising the mussel mantle. R(myt1) was found the only isoform to be present in the auxiliary cells of female <e>follicles</e> and the cubic epithelium of the middle fold of mantle edge. In contrast, only the R(myt2) isoform was detected in the subepithelial connective tissue, the endothelium of haemolymph vessels, the adipogranular and vesicular cells of reserve connective tissue, and the spermatozoa. Finally, both R(myt1) and R(myt2) coexist in some cell types but they show a different cellular localization: R(myt1) was localized in the cytoplasm whereas R(myt2) was mainly detected in the cell apical edge, cell periphery, cilia and sperm flagella. Interestingly, both R(myt1) and R(myt2) were absent in oocytes within the female gonadal follicles but, in contrast, they were highly expressed in follicle-released oocytes collected after spawning. Taken together the results show that mussel PKA isoforms are differentially distributed in the mantle cell types, which suggests that they are involved in the regulation of distinct cellular functions. On the other hand, the expression of R(myt1) and R(myt2) proteins is associated with the meiosis resumption of oocytes at the prophase I stage, which occurs in parallel to spawning.",M2
19906004,"Ovarian transplantation for fertility preservation in a sheep model: can follicle loss be prevented by antiapoptotic sphingosine-1-phosphate administration?AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an apoptosis-inhibitor would be able to protect ovarian <e>follicles</e> from hypoxia-induced cell death in ovarian transplantation. METHODS: In four sheep, both ovaries were removed and immediately transplanted back into the abdominal wall. In two of them, one ovary was treated with S1P locally by injection and incubation after dissecting the ovarian cortex. The contra lateral ovary of both sheep and both ovaries of the remaining sheep served as controls. After 2 weeks, all grafts were evaluated histologically. RESULTS: Although the mean number of apoptotic cells were increased after grafting compared with fresh tissue, we were not able to demonstrate a significant difference regarding the follicular density in tissue with S1P treatment (mean number of follicles per field of view: 0.21 vs. 0.23, p = 0.909). CONCLUSION: Apoptosis seems to play a role in follicular loss during ovarian transplantation; however, local application of S1P does not prevent primordial/primary follicles from hypoxia-induced cell death in cortical grafts in our study.",M2
19904600,"Vitrification of bovine oocytes: implications of follicular size and sire on the rates of embryonic development.PURPOSE: The objectives were to test how the source of oocytes and semen impacted vitrification of large numbers of bovine oocytes and subsequent IVF and early embryo development to test procedures that may assist with assisted reproductive technologies in humans. METHODS: Bovine oocytes were vitrified from <e>follicles</e> of different diameters, small (&lt; or =4 mm) and medium (4 to 10 mm), using nylon mesh. Oocytes were exposed to the cryoprotectant composed of 40% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 18% (w/v) Ficoll-70, and 0.3 M sucrose in three stepwise dilutions. Thawing was conducted with a series of 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 M sucrose dilutions in 20% fetal bovine serum. RESULTS: The cleavage (39.1% vs. 58.5%) and blastocyst rates (5.1% vs. 22.9%) were significantly lower for the vitrified oocytes. Follicle size had a significant impact on the development of embryos. Sires had significant effects on embryonic developmental rates. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that differences in development exist due to follicle source and sire used for IVF after vitrification.",M2
19903031,"Involvement of HSP10 during the ovarian follicular development of polycystic ovary syndrome: Study in both human ovaries and cultured mouse <e>follicles</e>.OBJECTIVE: To study the possible roles of HSP10 in the follicular development. METHODS: In this study, we examined the expression of HSP10 during the follicular development in human ovaries and cultured mouse follicles as well as its functional relevance with PCOS. Ovary tissues from normal adults (n = 3) were obtained with consents. Mouse early antral follicles (diameter: 220-250 mum) were cultured for 3 days in vitro. Western Blot and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the HSP10 expression and localisation during follicular development in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: HSP10 protein was detected only in oocytes from human preantral follicles, whereas in antral follicles, it was localised in oocytes, granulosa cells, theca cells and stroma cells. Furthermore, in cultured mouse antral follicles, a similar trend of HSP10 expression during follicle development was observed. CONCLUSION: HSP10 expression was increased as larger area and higher level of density during follicular development both in human and mouse follicles cultured in vitro. Our previous studies showed that HSP10 was highly expressed in normal ovaries compared with those from PCOS. The mouse early antral follicle culture approach may help to understand the role of HSP10 in pathophysiological development of PCOS.",M2
19896648,"Glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptors in human ovaries from fetuses, girls, and women.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and its receptors, GDNF alpha 1 (GFR-alpha1) and tyrosine kinase receptor for rearranged during transfection (RET), in human ovaries at the protein and mRNA levels. DESIGN: Samples were prepared for immunohistochemical staining for GDNF, GFR-alpha1, and RET and in situ hybridization for the mRNA of GFR-alpha1. The mRNA expression of two GDNF isoforms and two RET isoforms was investigated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction. SETTING: Infertility unit at a university-affiliated tertiary medical center. PATIENT(S): Fifteen patients who underwent pregnancy terminations at 21-35 gestational weeks and 28 girls/women aged 5-39 years who underwent ovarian laparoscopies. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Laboratory analysis of human ovarian specimens. RESULT(S): The GDNF protein was detected in oocytes of all samples. Granulosa cells (GCs) stained for GDNF in a portion of fetal samples and in all samples from girls/women. The proteins for GFR-alpha1 and RET were detected in both oocytes and GCs with weak staining for the long RET isoform. GFR-alpha1 mRNA transcripts were detected in oocytes and GCs from all samples. The mRNA transcripts for the two GDNF isoforms and the two RET isoforms were detected in all fetal and adult specimens. CONCLUSION(S): The presence of the receptors of GDNF in the GCs of human primordial <e>follicles</e> suggests that GDNF may be involved in the regulation of primordial follicular activation.",M2
19892000,"Fenvalerate inhibits the growth of primary cultured rat preantral ovarian <e>follicles</e>.Fenvalerate is a widely used synthetic pyrethroid insecticide and is reported to disrupt reproductive function in humans and animals. However, little is known about its influence on follicular development. In this study, rat preantral follicles were primary cultured to investigate the effects of fenvalerate on follicular survival rate, morphological change, steroid hormone levels and steroidogenesis related gene mRNA expression. Follicles were cultured with 0, 1, 5 and 25 micromol/L fenvalerate for 72 h. And then the morphous was assessed by conventional light microscopy, steroid hormones were measured by RIA, and the expressions of steroidogenic acute regulatory protein (StAR) and cytochrome P450 side-chain cleavage enzyme (P450scc) were monitored by real-time quantitative PCR analysis. Results showed that fenvalerate inhibited the augmentation of follicular diameters but did not have detectable effects on follicular survival rates. The level of steroid hormones, such as progesterone, testosterone and estradiol, was inhibited. The inhibition might be due to the decreased expression levels of StAR and P450scc. These results suggested that fenvalerate restrained the follicular growth, and inhibited steroidogenesis by reducing StAR and P450scc gene expression, which might further contribute to the fenvalerate-induced reproductive dysfunction.",M2
19890641,"Patterns of ovarian morphology in polycystic ovary syndrome: a study utilising magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare MRI-based ovarian morphology in groups of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and controls. METHODS: All PCOS cases (n = 44) had oligo-amenorrhoea and hyperandrogenism irrespective of ovarian morphology, and fulfilled NIH/Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for PCOS. All control women (n = 40) had normal menses and normoandrogenaemia. All subjects were of white British/Irish origin and pre-menopausal. Group comparisons were based on independent-sample t tests. Polycystic ovarian morphology was defined by at least 12 <e>follicles</e> 2-9 mm in diameter and/or an ovarian volume greater than 10 cm(3). RESULTS: Ovarian morphology differed significantly in PCOS cases and controls (follicle number geometric mean [SD range] 18.6 [9.9, 35.0] vs 6.6 [3.1, 14.2], unadjusted P = 1.3 x 10(-16); calculated ovarian volume 8.8 cm(3) [5.0, 15.5] vs 5.1 cm(3) [2.5, 10.3], unadjusted P = 3.0 x 10(-7); peripheral follicle location in 55% vs 18% of ovaries, P = 7.9 x 10(-6); visible central ovarian stroma in 61% vs 24% of ovaries, P = 2.3 x 10(-5)). Follicle number and calculated ovarian volume were not concordant with clinical/biochemical assignment of PCOS/control status in 36 (23%) and 52 (34%) of ovaries, respectively. CONCLUSION: Ovarian morphology overlaps in PCOS cases and controls, emphasising the importance of considering clinical/biochemical presentation together with imaging ovarian morphology in the diagnosis of PCOS.",M2
19886036,"Impact of pituitary FSH purification on in vitro early folliculogenesis in goats.Porcine pituitary follicle stimulating hormone (pFSH) is known to regulate the production of growth factors that have an essential role in early foliculogenesis. However, the effects of different preparations of pFSH on the survival and development of caprine <e>follicles</e> are not yet known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different pFSH (Stimufol and Folltropin) on the in vitro survival and growth of caprine preantral follicles. Pieces of caprine ovarian tissues were cultured for either one or seven days in a supplemented Minimum Essential Medium, alone or containing either Stimufol (50 ng/mL) or Folltropin (10, 50, 100 and 1000 ng/mL). Fresh control ovarian tissues as well as cultured tissued were processed for histological and ultrastructural studies. The results showed that after seven days, only Stimufol maintained follicular morphology similar to control. Moreover, follicular degeneration was higher in medium alone or with Folltropin at 50, 100 and 1000 ng/mL. However, at day seven, the percentage of growing follicles was higher in 100 ng/mL of Folltropin than Stimufol. In conclusion, FSH preparations affect differently the performance of in vitro culture of caprine preantral follicles. Stimufol was better to preserve follicular morphology while Folltropin was more efficient to promote follicular growth.",M2
19878767,"[Oncofertility: a new focus in women health-care...]Although treatment and survival are the primary focus of health-care patients, with cancer survivors living longer it is now appropriate to consider their quality of life after treatment, including the possibility of becoming parents. There are several options for fertility preservation in cancer patients. Even though most of them are still experimental and their efficacy and reliability have not been determined, especially in women. The most successful alternative for female survivors is embryo cryopreservation, an approach not suitable for many single or virgin women or even possible for prepubertal girls. Reports of live birth after transplantation of human ovarian tissue have reinforced the clinical potential of ovarian tissue banking for fertility preservation. Many exciting studies are underway to improve the efficacy and solve the problems with current fertility preservation strategies, especially for in vitro culture of cryopreserved tissue or <e>follicles</e>. Continuous efforts to improve current strategies and to develop new strategies will benefit many women and children who are facing premature ovarian failure and sterility.",M2
19874886,"Whole-body or isolated ovary (60)Co irradiation: effects on in vivo and in vitro folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation.For the first time, the effects of low doses of gamma-radiation were studied on folliculogenesis and on isolated oocytes. After irradiation of adult mice, even at the lowest dose, a drastic loss of primordial <e>follicles</e> was observed in serial sections of ovaries, with, in opposite, no effect on the other follicle stages. Moreover, oocytes freshly recovered from the largest antral follicles of irradiated adult ovaries exhibited significantly less regular Ca(2+) oscillations than controls. Finally, in vitro folliculogenesis demonstrated a smaller diameter of preantral follicles recovered from irradiated juvenile ovaries compared to control, and an increase in follicle atresia. Further on, PLC-beta1 localization was not affected in the enclosed oocytes whereas chromatin configuration revealed that a quarter of them had prematurely resumed meiosis or was fragmented. These results raise the question of the risk of genetic and teratogenic effects on women submitted to chronic exposure even of very low radiation.",M2
19874833,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate inhibit growth and reduce estradiol levels of antral <e>follicles</e> in vitro.Any insult that affects survival of ovarian antral follicles can cause abnormal estradiol production and fertility problems. Phthalate esters (PEs) are plasticizers used in a wide range of consumer and industrial products. Exposure to these chemicals has been linked to reduced fertility in humans and animal models. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) decrease serum estradiol levels and aromatase (Arom) expression, prolong estrous cycles, and cause anovulation in animal and culture models. These observations suggest PEs directly target antral follicles. We therefore tested the hypothesis that DEHP (1-100 microg/ml) and MEHP (0.1-10 microg/ml) directly inhibit antral follicular growth and estradiol production. Antral follicles from adult mice were cultured with DEHP or MEHP, and/or estradiol for 96 h. During culture, follicle size was measured every 24 h as a measurement of follicle growth. After culture, media were collected for measurement of estradiol levels and follicles were subjected to measurement of cylin-D-2 (Ccnd2), cyclin-dependent-kinase-4 (Cdk4), and Arom. We found that DEHP and MEHP inhibited growth of follicles and decreased estradiol production compared to controls at the highest doses. DEHP and MEHP also decreased mRNA expression of Ccnd2, Cdk4, and Arom at the highest dose. Addition of estradiol to the culture medium prevented the follicles from DEHP- and MEHP-induced inhibition of growth, reduction in estradiol levels, and decreased Ccnd2 and Cdk4 expression. Collectively, our results indicate that DEHP and MEHP may directly inhibit antral follicle growth via a mechanism that partially includes reduction in levels of estradiol production and decreased expression of cell cycle regulators.",M2
19874233,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS): involvement in bovine follicular cysts etiopathogenesis.Ovulation is compared to an acute inflammatory process during which vasoactive agents, prostanoids, leukotrienes and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) develop. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of ROS in cystic and follicular fluid, in order to establish their involvement in the etiopathogenesis of Cystic Ovarian Follicle (COF) in dairy cows. The study was conducted in 30 healthy cows (group C) and 30 cows affected by COF (group COF). The fluid of follicular cysts and of preovulatory <e>follicles</e> was drawn by means of ultrasound guided aspiration from the cows of both groups. The fluid obtained was analyzed by a photometric analytical system to detect ROS level. ROS concentration was statistically lower in the cystic fluid than in the follicular one (62.4 +/- 13.36 U.Carr vs. 84.89 +/- 26.99 U.Carr) (p&lt;0.05), thus suggesting that an alteration of the cascade responsible for ROS production may be implicated in the complex etipathogenesis of COF.",M2
19864088,"Functional relationships among intrafollicular insulin-like growth factor 1, circulatory gonadotropins, and development of the dominant follicle in mares.The functional relationships among intrafollicular free insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), circulatory gonadotropins, and development of the dominant follicle were studied in 40 mares in two experiments. A GnRH antagonist (Acyline) was given i.m. at the expected beginning of follicular deviation (largest follicle or F1&gt; or =20mm; Day 0) alone (Acyline group) or in combination with intrafollicular treatment of F1 with rhIGF1 (Acyline/IGF1 group). In Experiment 1, blood samples, follicular-fluid samples, and diameter of F1 were taken on Days 1 and 2. In Experiment 2, daily follicular diameter and blood samples were taken from Day 0 to ovulation. The GnRH antagonist induced a 50% decrease in circulatory FSH concentrations for 1 d and in LH for 2 d. In Experiment 1, control and Acyline/IGF1 groups had greater intrafollicular free IGF1 (P&lt;0.05) and inhibin-A concentrations (P&lt;0.08) than the Acyline group. The intrafollicular concentration of estradiol on Day 2 was greater (P&lt;0.05) in the control group than in the Acyline and the Acyline/IGF1 groups. In Experiment 2, a decrease in diameter of F1 in the Acyline group was followed by a new follicular wave. All IGF-treated <e>follicles</e> grew and ovulated. Results indicated that the increase in intrafollicular free IGF1 observed in F1 in association with deviation is gonadotropin dependent. During the period of lesser gonadotropin concentrations from Acyline treatment, intrafollicular IGF1 stimulated follicular growth and inhibin concentrations, but not intrafollicular estradiol production.",M2
19878052,"Prediction of ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome in women undergoing in vitro fertilization.OBJECTIVE. Ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS) is a severe side effect of in vitro fertilization (IVF). The aim of this study was to identify independent predictors which could be used to identify IVF patients at risk for OHSS. DESIGN: A prospective observational study. SETTING: University hospital. POPULATION: Six hundred and twenty-four consecutive patients treated with conventional IVF or intracytoplasmic sperm injection. METHODS: Observational clinical data were compared. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Patients who developed OHSS were compared with patients who did not develop OHSS using univariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Twenty-eight patients developed OHSS considered as severe and requiring hospitalization. Independent predictors of OHSS were number of <e>follicles</e> at oocyte aspiration, number of aspirated oocytes and total number of medium/large-sized follicles before hCG. When these variables were combined in a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve they showed a sensitivity of 82.1% and a specificity of 90% for OHSS. The only independent predictor of OHSS before the ovulatory dose of hCG was total number of medium/large-sized follicles before hCG. A corresponding ROC found a sensitivity of 82.1% and specificity of 79.4%. CONCLUSION: Prediction of OHSS that is of severity requiring hospitalization can be done with reasonable high sensitivity and specificity both before and after the ovulatory dose of hCG.",M2
19875303,"WNT signaling in ovarian follicle biology and tumorigenesis.The WNTS are an expansive family of glycoprotein signaling molecules known mostly for the roles they play in embryonic development. WNT signaling first caught the attention of ovarian biologists when it was reported that the inactivation of Wnt4 in mice results in partial female-to-male sex reversal and oocyte depletion. More recently, studies using loss- and gain-of-function transgenic mouse models demonstrated the requirement for Wnt4, Fzd4 and Ctnnb1, components of the WNT pathway, for normal folliculogenesis, luteogenesis and steroidogenesis, and showed that dysregulated WNT signaling can cause granulosa cell tumor development.
