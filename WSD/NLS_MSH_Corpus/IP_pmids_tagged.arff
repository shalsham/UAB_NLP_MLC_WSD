20308071,"Role of inositol trisphosphate receptors in autophagy in DT40 cells.Previous studies have shown that small interfering RNA knockdown and pharmacological inhibition of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors (<e>IP</e>(3)Rs) stimulate autophagy. We have investigated autophagy in chicken DT40 cell lines containing targeted deletions of all three IP(3)R isoforms (triple knock-out (TKO) cells). Using gel shifts of microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3 as a marker of autophagy, we find that TKO cells have enhanced basal autophagic flux even under nutrient-replete conditions. Stable DT40 cell lines derived from TKO cells containing the functionally inactive D2550A IP(3)R mutant did not suppress autophagy in the same manner as wild-type receptors. This suggests that the channel function of the receptor is important in its regulatory role in autophagy. There were no marked differences in the phosphorylation state of AMP-activated protein kinase, Akt, or mammalian target of rapamycin between wild-type and TKO cells. The amount of immunoprecipitated complexes of Bcl-2-Beclin-1 and Beclin-1-Vps34 were also not different between the two cell lines. The major difference noted was a substantially decreased mTORC1 kinase activity in TKO cells based on decreased phosphorylation of S6 kinase and 4E-BP1. The discharge of intracellular stores with thapsigargin stimulated mTORC1 activity (measured as S6 kinase phosphorylation) to a greater extent in wild-type than in TKO cells. We suggest that basal autophagic flux may be negatively regulated by IP(3)R-dependent Ca(2+) signals acting to maintain an elevated mTORC1 activity in wild-type cells and that Ca(2+) regulation of this enzyme is defective in TKO cells. The protective effect of a higher autophagic flux in cells lacking IP(3)Rs may play a role in the delayed apoptotic response observed in these cells.",M1
20238270,"Biochemical methods used to study the gene expression and protein complexes in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa.Biochemical approaches are powerful tools for investigating mechanisms of biological processes. Here, we describe several biochemical approaches that have been successfully in our laboratory to study the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. These approaches include protein extraction and western blot analysis, protein purification using epitope-tagged fusion protein, protein immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) and Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays. These methods can also be modified for use in other filamentous fungi.",M1

20147045,"Analysis of RNA-protein complexes by RNA coimmunoprecipitation and RT-PCR analysis from Caenorhabditis elegans.RNA coimmunoprecipitation (co-<e>IP</e>) experiments are an extension of protein co-IP experiments in which in vivo RNA-protein complexes are investigated. This protocol describes how to perform RNA co-IPs from C. elegans whole-worm extracts. In principle, a protein-specific antibody is used to purify the protein of choice and its associated complex members from worm extract. This may also include RNA molecules associated with other protein components. To identify a specific mRNA molecule, all RNA molecules are first separated from the protein components after immunopurification. The mRNAs are then converted into cDNA by reverse transcription. Candidate mRNAs are detected by sensitive gene-specific amplification via polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in a semiquantitative manner. Since RNA molecules are very prone to degradation, it is crucial to avoid any kind of contamination with RNase activity in this experiment.",M1
20147044,"Analysis of in vivo protein complexes by coimmunoprecipitation from Caenorhabditis elegans.Protein coimmunoprecipitation (co-<e>IP</e>) is a method used to analyze in vivo complex formation of various proteins. Although such an analysis supports the coexistence of proteins in a complex, a direct protein-protein interaction cannot be concluded unless further in vitro data are available. This protocol describes how to perform co-IPs from C. elegans whole-worm extracts using protein-specific antibodies. First, we describe how to culture a large number of worms while maintaining their overall appearance and wild-type fertility rates, which are important factors when analyzing the germline tissue. Next, we present a gentle and effective method to generate worm extracts with high protein concentrations that maintain protein complexes of high quality. Finally, we describe how to purify the protein of choice along with its associated complex members. The precipitated protein complex can be analyzed by either immunoblot analysis or mass spectrometry to identify the copurified protein components. When working with RNA-binding proteins, it is of interest to assess whether RNA molecules, rather than a direct interaction between the proteins, might mediate complex formation. For this purpose, an optional RNase digestion step to degrade the RNA in the extract is described.",M1
20133760,"Streamlined analysis schema for high-throughput identification of endogenous protein complexes.Immunoprecipitation followed by mass spectrometry (<e>IP</e>/MS) has recently emerged as a preferred method in the analysis of protein complex components and cellular protein networks. Targeting endogenous protein complexes of higher eukaryotes, particularly in large-scale efforts, has been challenging due to cellular heterogeneity, high proteome complexity, and, compared to lower organisms, lack of efficient in-locus epitope-tagging techniques. It is further complicated by variability in nonspecific identifications and cross-reactivity of primary antibodies. Still, the study of endogenous human protein networks is highly desired despite its challenges. Here we describe a streamlined IP/MS protocol for the purification and identification of extended endogenous protein complexes. We investigate the sources of nonspecific protein binding and develop semiquantitative specificity filters that are based on peptide spectral count measurements. We also outline logical constraints for the derivation of accurate complex composition from IP/MS data and demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach by presenting our analyses of different transcriptional coregulator complexes. We show consistent purification of novel components for the Integrator complex, analyze the composition of the Mediator complex solely from our data to demonstrate the wide usability of spectral counts, and deconvolute heterogeneous HDAC1/2 networks into core complex modules and several novel subcomplex interactions.",M1
20068007,"Nonmuscle myosin IIA (myosin heavy polypeptide 9): a novel class of signal transducer mediating the activation of G alpha h/phospholipase C-delta 1 pathway.The dimeric Gh protein is comprised of alpha (tissue transglutaminase) and beta (Calreticulin) subunits and known to be associated with FSH-, oxytocin-, or epinephrine-receptors/functions in their respective target cells. After establishing the FSH-induced activation of G alpha h/phospholipase C (PLC)-delta 1 pathway in rat Sertoli cells (SCs), we have attempted to identify a possible G alpha h-coupled novel FSH receptor (FSH-R). Remarkably, a protein with approximately 240-kDa molecular mass was coimmunoprecipitated with G alpha h in the fractionated membrane proteins of rat SCs. The protein was identified as myosin heavy polypeptide 9 (MyH9) by mass spectrometric analysis and immunoblotting. In addition, immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that MyH9 is constitutively associated with classical Gs-coupled FSH-R and inactive GDP-bound G alpha h at resting state of rat SCs, but did not interact with FSH directly as judged by Far-Western analysis. Upon the stimulation of higher levels of extracellular FSH (&gt;1000 IU/liter), classical FSH-R induces the phosphorylation of MyH9, the dissociation of active GTP-bound G alpha h from FSH-R:MyH9 complexes, and the elicitation of G alpha h/PLC-delta 1 pathway-dependent Ca(2+)-influx in rat SCs. Furthermore, the specific inhibition of MyH9 ATPase activity with Blebbistatin dose-dependently suppressed FSH-induced G alpha h/PLC-delta 1 signaling and Ca(2+)-influx, but not intracellular cAMP accumulation in rat SCs, implying that MyH9 mediates FSH-induced activation of G alpha h/PLC-delta 1/<e>IP</e>(3)/Ca(2+)-influx pathway in rat SCs. This is the first to demonstrate that the filament protein MyH9 constitutively forms a ternary complex with FSH-R and inactive GDP-bound G alpha h. At higher FSH levels, this ternary complex executes an alternative signaling of classical Gs-coupled FSH-R through activating a Gs/cAMP-independent, G alpha h/PLC-delta 1 pathway in rat SCs.",M1
20042474,"Anti-Argonaute RIP-Chip shows that miRNA transfections alter global patterns of mRNA recruitment to microribonucleoprotein complexes.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play key roles in gene expression regulation by guiding Argonaute (AGO)-containing microribonucleoprotein (miRNP) effector complexes to target polynucleotides. There are still uncertainties about how miRNAs interact with mRNAs. Here we employed a biochemical approach to isolate AGO-containing miRNPs from human H4 tumor cells by co-immunoprecipitation (co-<e>IP</e>) with a previously described anti-AGO antibody. Co-immunoprecipitated (co-IPed) RNAs were subjected to downstream Affymetrix Human Gene 1.0 ST microarray analysis. During rigorous validation, the  RIP-Chip  assay identified target mRNAs specifically associated with AGO complexes. RIP-Chip was performed after transfecting brain-enriched miRNAs (miR-107, miR-124, miR-128, and miR-320) and nonphysiologic control miRNA to identify miRNA targets. As expected, the miRNA transfections altered the mRNA content of the miRNPs. Specific mRNA species recruited to miRNPs after miRNA transfections were moderately in agreement with computational target predictions. In addition to recruiting mRNA targets into miRNPs, miR-107 and to a lesser extent miR-128, but not miR-124 or miR-320, caused apparent exclusion of some mRNAs that are normally associated with miRNPs. MiR-107 and miR-128 transfections also result in decreased AGO mRNA and protein levels. However, AGO mRNAs were not recruited to miRNPs after either miR-107 or miR-128 transfection, confirming that miRNAs may alter gene expression without stable association between particular mRNAs and miRNPs. In summary, RIP-Chip assays constitute an optimized, validated, direct, and high-throughput biochemical assay that provides data about specific miRNA:mRNA interactions, as well as global patterns of regulation by miRNAs.",M1
20020444,"Methylation analysis by DNA immunoprecipitation.DNA methylation regulates gene expression primarily through modification of chromatin structure. Global methylation studies have revealed biologically relevant patterns of DNA methylation in the human genome affecting sequences such as gene promoters, gene bodies, and repetitive elements. Disruption of normal methylation patterns and subsequent gene expression changes have been observed in several diseases especially in human cancers. Immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>)-based methods to evaluate methylation status of DNA have been instrumental in such genome-wide methylation studies. This review describes techniques commonly used to identify and quantify methylated DNA with emphasis on IP based platforms. In an effort to consolidate the wealth of information and highlight critical aspects of methylated DNA analysis, sample considerations, experimental and bioinformatic approaches for analyzing genome-wide methylation profiles, and the benefit of integrating DNA methylation data with complementary dimensions of genomic data are discussed.",M1
19956082,"A rapid high-throughput method for mapping ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) on human pre-mRNA.Sequencing RNAs that co-immunoprecipitate (co-<e>IP</e>) with RNA binding proteins has increased our understanding of splicing by demonstrating that binding location often influences function of a splicing factor. However, as with any sampling strategy the chance of identifying an RNA bound to a splicing factor is proportional to its cellular abundance. We have developed a novel in vitro approach for surveying binding specificity on otherwise transient pre-mRNA. This approach utilizes a specifically designed oligonucleotide pool that tiles across introns, exons, splice junctions, or other pre-mRNA. The pool is subjected to some kind of molecular selection. Here, we demonstrate the method by separating the oligonucleotide into a bound and unbound fraction and utilize a two color array strategy to record the enrichment of each oligonucleotide in the bound fraction. The array data generates high-resolution maps with the ability to identify sequence-specific and structural determinates of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) binding on pre-mRNA. A unique advantage to this method is its ability to avoid the sampling bias towards mRNA associated with current IP and SELEX techniques, as the pool is specifically designed and synthesized from pre-mRNA sequence. The flexibility of the oligonucleotide pool is another advantage since the experimenter chooses which regions to study and tile across, tailoring the pool to their individual needs. Using this technique, one can assay the effects of polymorphisms or mutations on binding on a large scale or clone the library into a functional splicing reporter and identify oligonucleotides that are enriched in the included fraction. This novel in vitro high-resolution mapping scheme provides a unique way to study RNP interactions with transient pre-mRNA species, whose low abundance makes them difficult to study with current in vivo techniques.",M1
19918948,"Visualization of multiprotein complexes by flow cytometry.Multiprotein complexes and other protein-protein interactions play important roles in virtually all cellular processes. Analysis of coimmunoprecipitation of protein complexes by flow cytometry (<e>IP</e>-FCM, or  the fly-p  method) provides a sensitive means to measure these interactions in the native/nondenatured state. First, immunoprecipitating antibodies are covalently coupled to polystyrene latex beads whose low autofluorescence is compatible with flow cytometry. These antibody-coupled beads are used to immunoprecipitate a specific protein (primary analyte) present in cell lysates. Finally, the protein complexes associated with the beads are probed with fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies specific for interaction partners, or secondary analytes, that may be associated with the primary analyte. The use of quantitative flow cytometric methodology can allow the semiquantitative fluorescence data generated to be converted into estimated numbers of co-associated molecules on the beads. The method represents a robust technique to assess native protein-protein interactions without requiring genetic engineering or large sample sizes.",M1
19878533,"Rab3a interacting molecule (RIM) and the tethering of pre-synaptic transmitter release site-associated CaV2.2 calcium channels.Biochemical and physiological evidence suggest that pre-synaptic calcium channels are attached to the transmitter release site within the active zone by a molecular tether. A recent study has proposed that 'Rab3a Interacting Molecule' (RIM) serves as the tether for CaV2.1 channels in mouse brain, based in part on biochemical co-immunoprecipitation (co-<e>IP</e>) using a monoclonal antibody, mRIM. We previously argued against this idea for CaV2.2 calcium channel at chick synapses based on experiments using a different anti-RIM antibody, pRIM1,2: while staining for the two proteins co-localized and co-varied at the transmitter release face, consistent with an association, they failed to co-IP from a synaptosome membrane lysate. RIM is, however, a family of proteins and we tested the possibility that the mRIM antibody used in the more recent study identifies a particular channel-tethering variant. We find that co-immunostaining with mRIM and anti-CaV2.2 antibody neither co-localized nor co-varied at the transmitter release face and the two proteins did not co-IP, arguing against a common protein complex and a key CaV2.2 scaffolding role for RIM at the active zone. The differing results might be reconciled, however, in a model where a RIM family member contributes to a protein bridge that anchors the pre-fusion secretory vesicle to the calcium channel protein complex.",M1
19860880,"LMP1-augmented kappa intron enhancer activity contributes to upregulation expression of Ig kappa light chain via NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways in nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.BACKGROUND: Expression of kappa gene is under the control of distinct cis-regulatory elements, including the kappa intron enhancer (iE kappa) and the kappa 3' enhancer (3'E kappa). The active enhancers and expression of immunoglobulin is generally considered to be restricted to B lymphocytes. However, accumulating evidence indicated that epithelial cancer cells, including nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) cell lines, express immunoglobulins. The mechanisms underlying the expression of Igs in nonlymphoid cells remain unknown. On the basis of our previous finding that expression of kappa light chain in NPC cells can be upregulated by EBV-encoded latent membrane protein 1(LMP1) through the activation of NF-kappaB and AP-1 signaling pathways, we thus use NPC cells as model to further explore the molecular mechanisms of nonlymphoid cells expressing Ig kappa. RESULTS: In this study, luciferase reporter plasmid containing human wild-type iE kappa, and its derivative plasmids containing mutant binding sites for transcription factor NF-kappaB or AP-1 were constructed. Luciferase reporter assays demonstrate iE kappa is active in Ig kappa-expressing NPC cells and LMP1 expression can upregulate the activity of iE kappa in NPC cells. Mutation of the NF-kappaB or AP-1 site within and downstream the iE kappa, inhibition of the NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways by their respective chemical inhibitor Bay11-7082 and SP600125 as well as stable or transient expression of dominant-negative mutant of I kappaB alpha (DNMI kappaB alpha) or of c-Jun (TAM67) indicate that both sites are functional and LMP1-enhanced iE kappa activity is partly regulated by these two sites. Gel shift assays show that LMP1 promotes NF-kappaB subunits p52 and p65 as well as AP-1 family members c-Jun and c-Fos binding to the kappa NF-kappaB and the kappa AP-1 motifs in vitro, respectively. Both chemical inhibitors and dominant negative mutants targeting for NF-kappaB and AP-1 pathways can attenuate the LMP1-enhanced bindings. Co-<e>IP</e> assays using nuclear extracts from HNE2-LMP1 cells reveal that p52 and p65, c-Jun and c-Fos proteins interact with each other at endogenous levels. ChIP assays further demonstrate p52 and p65 binding to the kappaB motif as well as c-Jun and c-Fos binding to the AP-1 motif of Ig kappa gene in vivo. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that human iE kappa is active in Ig kappa-expressing NPC cells and LMP1-stimulated NF-kappaB and AP-1 activation results in an augmenting activation of the iE kappa. LMP1 promotes the interactions of heterodimeric NF-kappaB (p52/p65) and heterodimeric AP-1 (c-Jun/c-Fos) transcription factors with the human iE kappa enhancer region are important for the upregulation of kappa light chain in LMP1-positive nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells.",M1
19846943,"Molecular imaging application of radioiodinated anti-EGFR human Fab to EGFR-overexpressing tumor xenografts.BACKGROUND: Suitable diagnostics could identify patients who might benefit from targeted therapies. Molecular imaging is a promising method estimating the expression of specific molecules in vivo, and the goal of this study was to evaluate a radioiodinated anti-epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) human Fab as a molecular imaging agent for diagnosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three human tumor cell lines representing tumors with different levels of EGFR expression were selected and their corresponding xenografts produced. (125)I was conjugated to a human anti-EGFR Fab that recognizes the native extracellular domain of EGFR evidenced by immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) and fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) assays. Single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging of (125)I-Fab being administered to nude mice bearing xenografts were obtained, and further analyzed by region of interest (ROI) assay. RESULTS: The (125)I-Fab was achieved successfully without losing its immunoreactivity. The scintigrams as well as ROI assay showed that (125)I-Fab was able to clearly quantitatively distinguish the different expression levels of EGFR in vivo. CONCLUSION: (125)I-Fab is a potential molecular imaging agent for clinical diagnosis of EGFR-overexpressing tumors.",M1
19815002,"Tar DNA binding protein of 43 kDa (TDP-43), 14-3-3 proteins and copper/zinc superoxide dismutase (SOD1) interact to modulate NFL mRNA stability. Implications for altered RNA processing in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS).Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurological disease characterized by progressive motor neuron degeneration in association with neurofilament (NF) aggregate formation. This process is accompanied by an alteration in the stoichiometry of NF subunit protein expression such that the steady state levels of the low molecular weight NF (NFL) mRNA levels are selectively suppressed. We have previously shown that each of TDP-43, 14-3-3 and mutant SOD1 can function as NFL mRNA 3'UTR binding proteins that directly affect the stability of NFL transcripts. In this study, we demonstrate that the interaction of TDP-43 with the NFL mRNA 3' UTR involves ribonucleotide (UG) motifs present on stem loops of the 3'UTR as well as the RRM1 and RRM2 motifs of TDP-43. Ex vivo, TDP-43, 14-3-3 and SOD1 proteins interact to modulate NFL mRNA stability, although in vivo, only TDP-43 and either mutant or wild-type SOD1 co-localize in ALS motor neurons. TDP-43 was observed to co-localize to RNA transport granules (Staufen immunoreactive) in both control and ALS spinal motor neurons. In contrast, both stress granules (TIA-1 immunoreactive) and processing bodies (P-bodies; XRN-1 immunoreactive) were more prevalent in ALS motor neurons than in controls and demonstrated strong co-localization with TDP-43. Using RNA-<e>IP</e>-PCR, we further demonstrate that NFL mRNA is preferentially sequestered to both stress granules and P-bodies in ALS. These data suggest that NFL mRNA processing is fundamentally altered in ALS spinal motor neurons to favour compartmentalization within both stress granules and P-bodies, and that TDP-43 plays a fundamental role in this process.",M1
19808694,"Clinical usefulness of anti-RNA polymerase III antibody measurement by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical usefulness of measuring anti-RNA polymerase (RNAP) III antibody with a commercially available ELISA in Japanese patients with SSc. METHODS: This multicentre study involved 354 patients with SSc, 245 with non-SSc CTDs and 102 healthy controls. ELISAs were used to detect anti-RNAP III antibody, anti-topo I antibody and ACA. The presence of anti-RNAP III antibody in selected serum samples was confirmed by immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) assay. RESULTS: By ELISA, anti-RNAP III antibody was detected in 38 (10.7%) patients with SSc, 3 (1.2%) with non-SSc CTD and no healthy controls. The clinical specificity for SSc was excellent (98.8%), although a small number of false positives occurred. The sensitivity of the anti-topo I and ACA ELISAs for SSc was 59.9%, which increased to 68.2% without a reduction in specificity when the anti-RNAP III measurement was added. Clinical features associated with positivity for the anti-RNAP III antibody include dcSSc, a high total skin score and a trend towards high prevalence of renal crisis, consistent with previous studies that used an IP assay. Furthermore, on clinical severity scales, SSc patients with anti-RNAP III antibody scored highest for skin and renal involvement among patients subgrouped by the presence of individual SSc-related antibodies. CONCLUSIONS: The measurement of anti-RNAP III antibody by ELISA is useful in routine clinical practice, because it helps diagnose SSc and identify a disease subset with severe skin and renal involvement.",M1
19800311,"Immunoaffinity-based mass spectrometric characterization of the FMRFamide-related peptide family in the pericardial organ of Cancer borealis.The tetrapeptide, FMRFamide, was first discovered in 1977 in the molluscan nervous system and was found to affect the contractile force of molluscan cardiac muscle and other muscles. Since then, numerous FMRFamide-related peptides (FaRPs) have been reported in both invertebrate and vertebrate species. We have previously reported the detection and identification of numerous FaRPs in Cancer borealis pericardial organs (POs), one of the major neurosecretory structures in the crustaceans. Here, we have developed two immunoaffinity-based methods, immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) and immuno-dot blot screening assay, for the enrichment of FaRPs in C. borealis POs. A combined mass spectrometry (MS)-based approach involving both matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization Fourier transform mass spectrometry (MALDI-FTMS) and nanoscale liquid chromatography coupled to electrospray ionization quadrupole time-of-flight tandem mass spectrometry (nanoLC-ESI-QTOF MS/MS) is used for a more comprehensive characterization of the FaRP family by utilizing high mass accuracy measurement and efficient peptide sequencing. Overall, 17 FMRFamide-related peptides were identified using these two complementary immuno-based approaches. Among them, three novel peptides were reported for the first time in this study.",M1
19784364,"Ago2 immunoprecipitation identifies predicted microRNAs in human embryonic stem cells and neural precursors.BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs are required for maintenance of pluripotency as well as differentiation, but since more microRNAs have been computationally predicted in genome than have been found, there are likely to be undiscovered microRNAs expressed early in stem cell differentiation. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: SOLiD ultra-deep sequencing identified &gt;10(7) unique small RNAs from human embryonic stem cells (hESC) and neural-restricted precursors that were fit to a model of microRNA biogenesis to computationally predict 818 new microRNA genes. These predicted genomic loci are associated with chromatin patterns of modified histones that are predictive of regulated gene expression. 146 of the predicted microRNAs were enriched in Ago2-containing complexes along with 609 known microRNAs, demonstrating association with a functional RISC complex. This Ago2 <e>IP</e>-selected subset was consistently expressed in four independent hESC lines and exhibited complex patterns of regulation over development similar to previously-known microRNAs, including pluripotency-specific expression in both hESC and iPS cells. More than 30% of the Ago2 IP-enriched predicted microRNAs are new members of existing families since they share seed sequences with known microRNAs. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Extending the classic definition of microRNAs, this large number of new microRNA genes, the majority of which are less conserved than their canonical counterparts, likely represent evolutionarily recent regulators of early differentiation. The enrichment in Ago2 containing complexes, the presence of chromatin marks indicative of regulated gene expression, and differential expression over development all support the identification of 146 new microRNAs active during early hESC differentiation.",M1
19776014,"Glucocorticoid-mediated inhibition of Lck modulates the pattern of T cell receptor-induced calcium signals by down-regulating inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.Glucocorticoids are potent immunosuppressive agents that block upstream signaling events required for T cell receptor (TCR) activation. However, the mechanism by which glucocorticoids inhibit downstream responses, such as inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (<e>IP</e>(3))-induced calcium signals, is not completely understood. Here we demonstrate that low concentrations of dexamethasone rapidly convert transient calcium elevations to oscillations after strong TCR stimulation. Dexamethasone converted the pattern of calcium signaling by inhibiting the Src family kinase Lck, which was shown to interact with and positively regulate Type I IP(3) receptor. In addition, low concentrations of dexamethasone were sufficient to inhibit calcium oscillations and interleukin-2 mRNA after weak TCR stimulation. Together, these findings indicate that by inhibiting Lck and subsequently down-regulating IP(3) receptors, glucocorticoids suppress immune responses by weakening the strength of the TCR signal.",M1
19752303,"Diagnosis of neuromyelitis spectrum disorders: comparative sensitivities and specificities of immunohistochemical and immunoprecipitation assays.OBJECTIVE: To compare the sensitivity and specificity of immunofluorescence (IF) and immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) assays using green fluorescent protein-tagged aquaporin-4 (AQP4) in 6335 patients for whom serological evaluation was requested on a service basis. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: Mayo Clinic Neuroimmunology Laboratory (Rochester, Minnesota) and Departments of Neurology (Rochester, Minnesota; Scottsdale, Arizona; and Jacksonville, Florida). Patients Group 1, 835 Mayo Clinic patients, 100 with a neuromyelitis optica (NMO) spectrum disorder diagnosis and 735 without NMO spectrum disorder; group 2, 5500 non-Mayo Clinic patients. Main Outcome Measure Sensitivity and specificity of each assay for NMO or NMO spectrum disorder, individually and combined. RESULTS: In group 1, the sensitivity rates for NMO were IF, 58%; IP, 33%; and combined assays, 63%. The sensitivity rates for relapsing longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis were IF, 29%; IP, 6%; and combined assays, 29%. The specificity rates for NMO and relapsing longitudinally extensive transverse myelitis were IF, 99.6%; IP, 99.3%; and combined assays, 99.2%. In group 2, NMO-IgG was detected by IF in 498 of 5500 patients (9.1%) and by IP in 331 patients (6.0%); 76 of the 331 patients seropositive by IP (23%) were negative by IF. Clinical information was available for 124 patients (including 16 of those seropositive by IP only); 123 had a definite NMO spectrum disorder and 1 was at risk for NMO (monophasic optic neuritis). CONCLUSIONS: In this large, clinical practice-based study, NMO-IgG detected by IF or IP was highly specific for NMO spectrum disorders. The IP assay was significantly less sensitive than IF. Combined testing improved sensitivity by 5%.",M1
19734348,"A high throughput experimental approach to identify miRNA targets in human cells.The study of human microRNAs is seriously hampered by the lack of proper tools allowing genome-wide identification of miRNA targets. We performed Ribonucleoprotein ImmunoPrecipitation-gene Chip (RIP-Chip) using antibodies against wild-type human Ago2 in untreated Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) cell lines. Ten to thirty percent of the gene transcripts from the genome were enriched in the Ago2-<e>IP</e> fraction of untreated cells, representing the HL miRNA-targetome. In silico analysis indicated that approximately 40% of these gene transcripts represent targets of the abundantly co-expressed miRNAs. To identify targets of miR-17/20/93/106, RIP-Chip with anti-miR-17/20/93/106 treated cells was performed and 1189 gene transcripts were identified. These genes were analyzed for miR-17/20/93/106 target sites in the 5'-UTRs, coding regions and 3'-UTRs. Fifty-one percent of them had miR-17/20/93/106 target sites in the 3'-UTR while 19% of them were predicted miR-17/20/93/106 targets by TargetScan. Luciferase reporter assay confirmed targeting of miR-17/20/93/106 to the 3'-UTRs of 8 out of 10 genes. In conclusion, we report a method which can establish the miRNA-targetome in untreated human cells and identify miRNA specific targets in a high throughput manner. This approach is applicable to identify miRNA targets in any human tissue sample or purified cell population in an unbiased and physiologically relevant manner.",M1
19715603,"Breast cancer humoral immune response: involvement of Lewis y through the detection of circulating immune complexes and association with Mucin 1 (MUC1).BACKGROUND: In cancer patients, MUC1 glycoprotein may carry Lewis y which could be involved in immune response. Purposes: 1- to evaluate the presence of Lewis y and MUC1 in circulating immune complexes (Lewis y/CIC and MUC1/CIC, respectively) and their correlation; 2- to analyze the possible presence of Lewis y in carbohydrate chains of tumoral MUC1 glycoprotein and 3- to correlate serum and tissue parameters considered. METHODS: Pretreatment serum and tissue breast samples from 76 adenocarcinoma, 34 benign and 36 normal specimens were analyzed. Anti-MUC1 and anti-Lewis y MAbs were employed. To detect Lewis y/CIC and MUC1/CIC, ELISA tests were developed; serum samples containing MUC1 were previously selected by Cancer Associated Serum Antigen (CASA). Immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) was performed in 9 malignant, benign and normal samples and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot. Lewis y and MUC1 expression was studied by immunohistochemistry (IHC). Statistical analysis was performed employing principal component analysis (PCA), ANOVA, Tukey HSD, Chi square test and classical correlation (p &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: By ELISA, Lewis y/IgM/CIC levels showed statistically significant differences between breast cancer versus benign and normal samples; mean +/- SD values expressed in OD units were: 0.525 +/- 0.304; 0.968 +/- 0.482 and 0.928 +/- 0.447, for breast cancer, benign disease and normal samples, respectively, p &lt; 0.05. Lewis y/IgG/CIC did not show any statistically significant difference. MUC1/IgM/CIC correlated with Lewis y/IgM/CIC. By CASA, 9 samples with MUC1 values above the cut off were selected and IP was performed, followed by SDS-PAGE and Western blot; bands at 200 kDa were obtained with each MAb in all the samples. By IHC, with C14 MAb, 47.5%, 31% and 35% of malignant, benign and normal samples, respectively, showed positive reaction while all the samples were positive with anti-MUC1 MAb; in both cases, with a different pattern of expression between malignant and non malignant samples. CONCLUSION: Our findings support that in breast cancer there was a limited humoral immune response through Lewis y/IgM/CIC levels detection which correlated with MUC1/IgM/CIC. We also found that Lewis y might be part of circulating MUC1 glycoform structure and also that Lewis y/CIC did not correlate with Lewis y expression.",M1

Currently, large quantities of protein are required to perform co-IP followed by mass spectrometric or Western blot analyses of the interacting proteins. Here catenin-cadherin complexes were employed to establish a multiplexed microsphere-based co-immunoprecipitation (micro co-IP) protocol that allows the analysis of different complexes of a given protein with various interacting proteins within a single experiment using a limited amount of sample material.",M1
19650111,"Variations in the composition of mammalian SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling complexes.The ATP-dependent chromatin remodelling complexes SWI/SNF alter the chromatin structure in transcriptional regulation. Several classes of mammalian SWI/SNF complex have been isolated biochemically, distinguished by a few specific subunits, such as the BAF-specific BAF250A, BAF250B and BRM, and the PBAF-specific BAF180. We have determined the complex compositions using low stringency immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) and shown that the pattern of subunit interactions was more diverse than previously defined classes had predicted. The subunit association at five gene promoters that depend on the SWI/SNF activity varied and the sequential chromatin immunoprecipitations revealed that different class-specific subunits occupied the promoters at the same time. The low-stringency IP showed that the BAF-specific BAF250A and BAF250B and the PBAF-specific BAF180 co-exist in a subset of SWI/SNF complexes, and fractionation of nuclear extract on size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that sub-complexes with unorthodox subunit compositions were present in the cell. We propose a model in which the constellations of SWI/SNF complexes are  tailored  for each specific chromatin target and depend on the local chromatin environment to which complexes and sub-complexes are recruited.",M1
19631583,"Re-evaluation of anti-HBc non-reactive serum samples from patients with persistent hepatitis B infection by immune precipitation with labelled HBV core antigen.BACKGROUND: Core antigen (HBcAg) is the most immunogenic component of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and is believed to induce virtually always antibodies (anti-HBc) in immunocompetent infected persons. However, some chronically infected persons do not develop detectable anti-HBc. OBJECTIVE: A more sensitive assay for anti-HBc was to be developed and used to re-evaluate a cohort of chronically HBV infected persons without detectable anti-HBc. STUDY DESIGN: Among 3309 serum samples which had been tested by commercially available (microparticle) enzyme immune assay (M/EIA) 34 samples from 22 patients were identified having reacted positive for HBsAg and negative for anti-HBc. Nine of these patients had immunosuppression or HIV coinfection, 13 patients were immunocompetent, 5 of them were perinatally infected. Anti-HBc was re-tested for in an immune precipitation (<e>IP</e>) assay using (32)P-labelled recombinant HBcAg as reagent and anti-human-IgG-coated magnetic beads as separation system for immunecomplexes containing HBcAg. Specificity was controlled for by competition with unlabelled HBcAg. RESULTS: 27 serum samples from the 22 patients could be retested. IP was positive in 7 MEIA negative sera, unspecific positive in 4 and negative in 16. Using 5 anti-HBe positive control sera, we found IP to be 1.8-fold (1.3-2.9) more sensitive than MEIA, but IP was 6.5-fold (5.8-7.4) more sensitive with 4 anti-HBe negative, anti-HBc positive sera. CONCLUSION: IP allowed specific detection of anti-HBc in about 25% of MEIA negative chronic HBV patients. The majority of these seem to produce no or very little anti-HBc, however.",M1
19559702,"Identification of novel N-terminal fragments of amyloid precursor protein in cerebrospinal fluid.Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder of the central nervous system. Two pathological hallmarks in the brain of AD patients are neurofibrillary tangles and senile plaques. The plaques consist mainly of beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptides that are produced from the amyloid precursor protein (APP), by sequential cleavage by beta- and gamma-secretase. Most previous studies have been focused on the C-terminal fragments of APP, where the Abeta sequence is localized. The purpose of this study was to search for N-terminal fragments of APP in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) using mass spectrometry (MS). By using immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight MS as well as nanoflow liquid chromatography coupled to high resolution tandem MS we were able to detect and identify six novel N-terminal APP fragments [APP((18-119)), APP((18-121)), APP((18-122)), APP((18-123)), APP((18-124)) and APP((18-126))], having molecular masses of approximately 12 kDa. The presence of these APP derivatives in CSF was also verified by Western blot analysis. Two pilot studies using either IP-MS or Western blot analysis indicated slightly elevated levels of N-terminal APP fragments in CSF from AD patients compared with controls, which are in need of replications in independent and larger patient materials.",M1
19525381,"Adenoprotection of the heart involves phospholipase C-induced activation and translocation of PKC-epsilon to RACK2 in adult rat and mouse.Adenosine protects the heart from adrenergic overstimulation. This adenoprotection includes the direct anti-adrenergic action via adenosine A(1) receptors (A(1)R) on the adrenergic signaling pathway. An indirect A(1)R-induced attenuation of adrenergic responsiveness involves the translocation of PKC-epsilon to t-tubules and Z-line of cardiomyocytes. We investigated with sarcomere imaging, immunocytochemistry imaging, and coimmunoprecipitation (co-<e>IP</e>) whether A(1)R activation of PKC-epsilon induces the kinase translocation to receptor for activated C kinase 2 (RACK2) in isolated rat and mouse hearts and whether phospholipase C (PLC) is involved. Rat cardiomyocytes were treated with the A(1)R agonist chlorocyclopentyladenosine (CCPA) and exposed to primary PKC-epsilon and RACK2 antibodies with secondaries conjugated to Cy3 and Cy5 (indodicarbocyanine), respectively. Scanning confocal microscopy showed that CCPA caused PKC-epsilon to reversibly colocalize with RACK2 within 3 min. Additionally, rat and mouse hearts were perfused and stimulated with CCPA or phenylisopropyladenosine to activate A(1)R, or with phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate to activate PKC. RACK2 was immunoprecipitated from heart extracts and resolved with SDS-PAGE. Western blotting showed that CCPA, phenylisopropyladenosine, and phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate in the rat heart increased the PKC-epsilon co-IP with RACK2 by 186, 49, and &gt;1,000%, respectively. The A(1)R antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine prevented the CCPA-induced co-IP with RACK2. In mouse hearts, CCPA increased the co-IP of PKC-epsilon with RACK2 by 61%. With rat cardiomyocytes, the beta-adrenergic agonist isoproterenol increased sarcomere shortening by 177%. CCPA reduced this response by 47%, an action inhibited by the PLC inhibitor U-73122 and 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine. In conclusion, A(1)R stimulation of the heart is associated with PLC-initiated PKC-epsilon translocation and association with RACK2.",M1
19519242,"Three different immunogen preparation strategies for production of CD4 monoclonal antibodies.Monoclonal antibodies (MAb) specific to the protein of interest can be achieved following the classical hybridoma technique. However, obtaining a desired MAb is not always straightforward. The intrinsic quality of immunogen is one of the critical success factors. In this study, three sources of immunogens were compared for CD4 MAb production. CD4 proteins were isolated by immunoprecipitation and the CD4 immunoprecipitated (CD4-<e>IP</e>) beads were used as an immunogen. Recombinant CD4 protein-biotin carboxyl carrier protein (BCCP) fusion proteins (CD4-BCCP) were produced in Escherichia coli, isolated by streptavidin-coated beads, and the CD4-BCCP beads were used as an immunogen. CD4 expressing COS (CD4-COS) cells were generated, enriched by immunosorting, and used as an immunogen. After three immunizations, anti-CD4 antibodies could be observed in all immunized mice. The CD4 MAbs that were generated from CD4-IP bead and CD4-COS cell immunizations reacted with both CD4 expressed on transfected COS cells and lymphocytes. These MAbs could be used for immunoprecipitation of CD4 molecules from lymphocyte lysate and for enumerating CD4+ lymphocytes by flow cytometry. In contrast, the MAb generated from CD4-BCCP bead immunization reacted only with recombinant CD4-BCCP proteins but not with native CD4 expressed on CD4+ lymphocytes. Our results indicate that the proposed methods can facilitate the production of desired MAbs where the purified protein antigens are not available or difficult to prepare, but either the encoding cDNA or specific MAb is available.",M1
19493441,"Inhibitory effects of sunitinib on ovalbumin-induced chronic experimental asthma in mice.BACKGROUND: Tyrosine kinase signaling cascades play a critical role in the pathogenesis of allergic airway inflammation. Sunitinib, a multitargeted receptor tyrosine kinase inhibitor, has been reported to exert potent immunoregulatory, anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects. We investigated whether sunitinib could suppress the progression of airway inflammation, airway hyperresponsiveness (AHR), and airway remodeling in a murine model of chronic asthma. METHODS: Ovalbumin (OVA)-sensitized mice were chronically challenged with aerosolized OVA for 8 weeks. Some mice were intragastrically administered with sunitinib (40 mg/kg) daily during the period of OVA challenge. Twelve hours after the last OVA challenge, mice were evaluated for the development of airway inflammation, AHR and airway remodeling. The levels of total serum immunoglobulin E (IgE) and Th2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-13) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were measured by ELISA. The expression of phosphorylated c-kit protein in the lungs was detected by immunoprecipitation/Western blotting (<e>IP</e>/WB) analysis. RESULTS: Sunitinib significantly inhibited eosinophilic airway inflammation, persistent AHR and airway remodeling in chronic experimental asthma. It reduced levels of total serum IgE and BALF Th2 cytokines and also lowered the expression of phosphorylated c-kit protein in remodelled airways. CONCLUSIONS: Sunitinib may inhibit the development of airway inflammation, AHR and airway remodeling. It is potentially beneficial to the prevention or treatment of asthma.",M1
19427863,"BimL directly neutralizes Bcl-xL to promote Bax activation during UV-induced apoptosis.Bcl-2-interacting mediator of cell death (Bim) has been considered to initiate intrinsic apoptotic pathway through Bax activation. Previous studies indicated that BimL was involved in UV-induced apoptosis, but it remains unclear whether Bim activates Bax by directly engaging it or by releasing it from pro-survival relatives such as Bcl-xL. In this study, we attempt to determine the interactions between BimL and Bax/Bcl-xL during Ultraviolet (UV)-induced apoptosis. BimL activation appeared to be an important event in our experiments, as demonstrated by the significant inhibition of cell death, caspase-3 activity, and Bax translocation in cells with knockdown of endogenous BimL by RNAi approach. Both fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) and Co-immunoprecipitation (CO-<e>IP</e>) assays indicated that Bcl-xL directly bound to Bax to inhibit its activation, while BimL directly neutralized Bcl-xL, followed by Bax release and activation upon UV irradiation. Not detected in our experiment was the interaction between BimL and Bax either using FRET approach in living cells or endogenous CO-IP assay. Thus, our findings provide strong evidence in living cells for the first time that BimL initiates apoptosis by abrogating Bcl-xL and promoting Bax activation under UV irradiation.",M1
19426678,"Suppression of the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway of Toll-like receptors by luteolin.Toll-like receptors (TLRs) play important roles in induction of innate immune responses for both host defense against invading pathogens and wound healing after tissue injury. Since dysregulation of TLR-mediated immune responses is closely linked to many chronic diseases, modulation of TLR activation by small molecules may have therapeutic potential against such diseases. Expression of the majority of lipopolysaccharide-induced TLR4 target genes is mediated through a MyD88-independent (TRIF-dependent) signaling pathway. In order to evaluate the therapeutic potential of the flavonoid luteolin we examined its effect on TLR-stimulated signal transduction via the TRIF-dependent pathway. Luteolin suppressed activation of Interferon regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) and NFkappaB induced by TLR3 and TLR4 agonists resulting in the decreased expression of target genes such as TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-12, <e>IP</e>-10, IFNbeta, CXCL9, and IL-27 in macrophages. Luteolin attenuated ligand-independent activation of IRF3 or NFkappaB induced by TLR4, TRIF, or TBK1, while it did not inhibit TLR oligomerization. Luteolin inhibited TBK1-kinase activity and IRF3 dimerization and phosphorylation, leading to the reduction of TBK1-dependent gene expression. Structural analogs of luteolin such as quercetin, chrysin, and eriodictyol also inhibited TBK1-kinase activity and TBK1-target gene expression. These results demonstrate that TBK1 is a novel target of anti-inflammatory flavonoids resulting in the down-regulation of the TRIF-dependent signaling pathway. These results suggest that the beneficial activities of these flavonoids against inflammatory diseases may be attributed to the modulation of TLR-mediated inflammatory responses.",M1
19332116,"The RhoA-specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor p63RhoGEF binds to activated Galpha(16) and inhibits the canonical phospholipase Cbeta pathway.Heterotrimeric G proteins regulate diverse physiological processes by modulating the activities of intracellular effectors. Members of the Galpha(q) family link G protein-coupled receptor activation to phospholipase Cbeta (PLCbeta) activity and intracellular calcium signaling cascades. However, they differ markedly in biochemical properties as well as tissue distribution. Recent findings have shown that some of the cellular activities of Galpha(q) family members are independent of PLCbeta activation. A guanine nucleotide exchange factor, p63RhoGEF, has been shown to interact with Galpha(q) proteins and thus provides linkage to RhoA activation. However, it is not known if p63RhoGEF can associate with other Galpha(q) family members such as Galpha(16). In the present study, we employed co-immunoprecipitation studies in HEK293 cells to demonstrate that p63RhoGEF can form a stable complex with the constitutively active mutant of Galpha(16) (Galpha(16)QL). Interestingly, overexpression of p63RhoGEF inhibited Galpha(16)QL-induced <e>IP</e>(3) production in a concentration-dependent manner. The binding of PLCbeta(2) to Galpha(16)QL could be displaced by p63RhoGEF. Similarly, p63RhoGEF inhibited the binding of tetratricopeptide repeat 1 to Galpha(16)QL, leading to a suppression of Galpha(16)QL-induced Ras activation. In the presence of p63RhoGEF, Galpha(16)QL-induced STAT3 phosphorylation was significantly reduced and Galpha(16)QL-mediated SRE transcriptional activation was attenuated. Taken together, these results suggest that p63RhoGEF binds to activated Galpha(16) and inhibits its signaling pathways.",M1
19305927,"Optimizing the detergent concentration conditions for immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) coupled with LC-MS/MS identification of interacting proteins.Immunoprecipitation (IP) coupled with LC-MS/MS is a widely used method in proteomics research to identify proteins and to study protein-protein interactions. IP techniques allow purification of proteins of interest and reduce sample complexity before introduction to the mass spectrometer. The effectiveness of IP experiments is an important factor for identification of proteins and protein-protein interactions. In this paper, a variety of IP conditions were studied systematically to improve IP-based protein interaction identification capabilities. Low concentration detergent (around 0.05% NP40/PBS) was found to improve IP effectiveness by decreasing non-specific binding. However, higher concentration detergent (e.g. 1% NP40/PBS) was detrimental. Furthermore, with lower protein concentrations, the IP system showed lower tolerance to detergent. For example, with a detergent concentration higher than 0.05% NP40/PBS, IP experiments were unsuccessful with low protein concentration (e.g. 0.28 microM ADH). In some cases the observed results were even worse than the results obtained without detergent. However, when the protein concentration was high (e.g. 1.12 microM ADH), this effect was not obvious and the high detergent (higher than 0.1%) experimental results were similar to those from low detergent concentration experiments (around 0.05%). Another application of this strategy to a more general system based on FLAG-Bacterial Alkaline Phosphatase (BAP) and anti-FLAG antibody was also performed. These results also suggested that low detergent concentration (0.05% NP40) is helpful for IP experiments, especially for the experiments with low protein concentrations. Considering that in most real applications, the proteins of interest are usually present in low abundance, a low amount of detergent is recommended to be used. The optimized detergent concentration was determined to be 0.05% in these studies. However, the key result presented here illustrates that both detergent and protein concentrations should be carefully considered when one is trying to optimize IP prior to mass spectrometry experiments.",M1
19292454,"Identification and characterization of wolframin, the product of the wolfram syndrome gene (WFS1), as a novel calmodulin-binding protein.To search for calmodulin (CaM) targets, we performed affinity chromatography purification of a rat brain extract using CaM fused with GST as the affinity ligand. Proteomic analysis was then carried out to identify CaM-binding proteins. In addition to identifying 36 known CaM-binding proteins, including CaM kinases, calcineurin, nNOS, the <e>IP</e>(3) receptor, and Ca(2+)-ATPase, we identified an ER transmembrane protein, wolframin [the product of the Wolfram syndrome gene (WFS1)] as interacting. A CaM overlay and an immunoprecipitation assay revealed that wolframin is capable of binding the Ca(2+)/CaM complex in vitro and in transfected cells. Surface plasmon resonance analysis and zero-length cross-linking showed that the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain (residues 2-285) of wolframin binds to an equimolar unit of CaM in a Ca(2+)-dependent manner with a K(D) for CaM of 0.15 muM. Various truncation and deletion mutants showed that the Ca(2+)/CaM binding region in wolframin is located from Glu90 to Trp186. Furthermore, we demonstrated that three mutations (Ala127Thr, Ala134Thr, and Arg178Pro) associated with Wolfram syndrome completely abolished CaM binding of wolframin. This observation may indicate that CaM binding is important for wolframin function and that impairment of this interaction by mutation contributes to the pathology seen in Wolfram syndrome.",M1
19241501,"Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation.The identification of DNA methylation patterns is a common procedure in the study of epigenetics, as methylation is known to have significant effects on gene expression, and is involved with normal development as well as disease. Thus, the ability to discriminate between methylated DNA and non-methylated DNA is essential for generating methylation profiles for such studies. Methylated DNA immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) is an efficient technique for the extraction of methylated DNA from a sample of interest. A sample of as little as 200 ng of DNA is sufficient for the antibody, or immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>), reaction. DNA is sonicated into fragments ranging in size from 300-1000 bp, and is divided into immunoprecipitated (IP) and input (IN) portions. IP DNA is subsequently heat denatured and then incubated with anti-5'mC, allowing the monoclonal antibody to bind methylated DNA. After this, magnetic beads containing a secondary antibody with affinity for the primary antibody are added, and incubated. These bead-linked antibodies will bind the monoclonal antibody used in the first step. DNA bound to the antibody complex (methylated DNA) is separated from the rest of the DNA by using a magnet to pull the complexes out of solution. Several washes using IP buffer are then performed to remove the unbound, non-methylated DNA. The methylated DNA/antibody complexes are then digested with Proteinase K to digest the antibodies leaving only the methylated DNA intact. The enriched DNA is purified by phenol:chloroform extraction to remove the protein matter and then precipitated and resuspended in water for later use. PCR techniques can be used to validate the efficiency of the MeDIP procedure by analyzing the amplification products of IP and IN DNA for regions known to lack and known to contain methylated sequences. The purified methylated DNA can then be used for locus-specific (PCR) or genome-wide (microarray and sequencing) methylation studies, and is particularly useful when applied in conjunction with other research tools such as gene expression profiling and array comparative genome hybridization (CGH). Further investigation into DNA methylation will lead to the discovery of new epigenetic targets, which in turn, may be useful in developing new therapeutic or prognostic research tools for diseases such as cancer that are characterized by aberrantly methylated DNA.",M1
19199569,"In vivo profiling endogenous interactions with knock-out in mammalian cells.To precisely identify and screen target-specific protein-protein interactions at the endogenous level, here we introduce a novel quantitative proteomic method we have termed in vivo Profiling Endogenous Interactions with Knock-out (iPEIK). In our design, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) derived from target gene knockout (KO) mice can be stable isotope-tagged and serve as a target-free background to  light-up  the target protein-specific protein complex formed in the corresponding wild-type (WT) cells. In mass spectrometric analysis of the pairs of non-labeled versus heavy isotope-labeled peptide signals derived from WT versus KO cells, respectively, we then quantitatively measured the abundance differences of the proteins in the complex immunoprecipitated (<e>IP</e>) from the target-expressing WT versus target-absent KO cells, respectively. Those proteins detected with little or no presence in the cells of KO origin were determined as target-specific interacting partners. Further, dynamic interactors could be identified through different IP mixing schemes. Using iPEIK we identified multiple interacting partners both previously known and unknown to be associated with mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase 2 (MEKK2). Because of the availability of a large library of knockout mice models with various target proteins of biological interests our method is generally applicable to screen any endogenous target-specific PPIs of physiological relevance.",M1
19171944,"Tools for fungal proteomics: multifunctional neurospora vectors for gene replacement, protein expression and protein purification.The completion of genome-sequencing projects for a number of fungi set the stage for detailed investigations of proteins. We report the generation of versatile expression vectors for detection and isolation of proteins and protein complexes in the filamentous fungus Neurospora crassa. The vectors, which can be adapted for other fungi, contain C- or N-terminal FLAG, HA, Myc, GFP, or HAT-FLAG epitope tags with a flexible poly-glycine linker and include sequences for targeting to the his-3 locus in Neurospora. To introduce mutations at native loci, we also made a series of knock-in vectors containing epitope tags followed by the selectable marker hph (resulting in hygromycin resistance) flanked by two loxP sites. We adapted the Cre/loxP system for Neurospora, allowing the selectable marker hph to be excised by introduction of Cre recombinase into a strain containing a knock-in cassette. Additionally, a protein purification method was developed on the basis of the HAT-FLAG tandem affinity tag system, which was used to purify HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (HP1) and associated proteins from Neurospora. As expected on the basis of yeast two-hybrid and co-immunoprecipitation (Co-<e>IP</e>) experiments, the Neurospora DNA methyltransferase DIM-2 was found in a complex with HP1. Features of the new vectors allowed for verification of an interaction between HP1 and DIM-2 in vivo by Co-IP assays on proteins expressed either from their native loci or from the his-3 locus.",M1
19158250,"Poxvirus MC160 protein utilizes multiple mechanisms to inhibit NF-kappaB activation mediated via components of the tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 signal transduction pathway.Poxviruses express proteins that limit host immune responses to infection. For example, the molluscum contagiosum virus MC160 protein inhibits tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha)-induced NF-kappaB activation. This event correlates with MC160-induced IKK1 protein degradation, suggesting a mechanism for the above-mentioned phenotype. IKK1 is stabilized when it associates with the cellular heat shock protein 90 (Hsp90). Here, Hsp90 overexpression restored IKK1 levels in MC160-expressing cells, suggesting that MC160 competitively interacted with Hsp90. In support of this, further investigation showed that a mutant MC160 protein comprising only the C-terminal region (C protein) immunoprecipitated with Hsp90. In contrast, Hsp90 <e>IP</e> with a mutant MC160 protein consisting of only the N-terminal tandem death effector domains (DEDs) (N protein) was dramatically decreased. Since cells expressing either the N or C mutant MC160 protein remained similarly resistant to TNF-alpha-induced NF-kappaB activation, the N mutant protein probably utilized a different mechanism for inhibiting NF-kappaB. One likely mechanism for the N protein lies in its association with the DED-containing procaspase-8 protein, a cellular apoptosis precursor protein that regulates NF-kappaB activation. Here, IPs revealed that this association relied on the presence of the DED-containing N terminus of the MC160 protein but not the C-terminal portion. These interactions appear to have relevance with NF-kappaB activation, since the expression of the viral DEDs strongly inhibited procaspase-8-mediated NF-kappaB activation, an event not substantially altered by the C protein. Thus, the MC160 protein utilizes at least two distinct mechanisms for impeding NF-kappaB activation, association with Hsp90 to result in IKK1 protein degradation or interaction with procaspase-8.",M1
19140678,"Evaluation of the variation in sample preparation for comparative proteomics using stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture.In comparative proteomic studies, it is important to know the variability associated with sample preparation. In this study, we report the strategy of using SILAC (stable isotope labeling by amino acids in cell culture) to evaluate the effect of the variation in sample preparation for quantitative proteomics. Variability can be measured when equal amounts of light and heavy SILAC samples undergo the same sample preparation procedures in parallel, and the two samples are mixed for relative protein quantitation by mass spectrometry. The high quantitative accuracy of SILAC allows for characterization of small variations. First, the reproducibility of immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) and in-gel digestion was evaluated, and the impact of replicate number on quantitative accuracy was characterized. Second, we evaluated the overall variation in a comparative workflow involving three sequential sample preparation steps: IP, SDS-PAGE fractionation, and in-gel digestion. The evaluation of individual sample preparation steps was very valuable for experimental design: the optimal number of replicates for each step could be readily determined and the overall variation of the workflow could be predicted from the variation of the individual steps involved. By using informed experimental design, we demonstrated that the error associated with multiple steps of sample preparation in a comparative experiment can be limited to a reasonably low level.",M1
19132681,"A bioanalytical method for the proteome wide display and analysis of protein complexes from whole plant cell lysates.While protein interaction studies and protein network modeling come to the forefront, the isolation and identification of protein complexes in a cellular context remains a major challenge for plant science.

Hyphenation to denaturing electrophoresis and mass spectrometric analysis allows for the simultaneous identification of multiple (previously unidentified) protein interactions in single samples. The reliability and efficacy of the technique was confirmed (i) by the identification of well-studied plant protein complexes, (ii) by the presence of nonplant interologs for several of the novel complexes (iii) by presenting physical evidence of previously hypothetical plant protein interactions and (iv) by the confirmation of found interactions using co-<e>IP</e>.

19103169,"Bone morphogenetic protein-2 induces chromatin remodeling and modification at the proximal promoter of Sox9 gene.Sox9 is a key transcription factor which plays an important role in chondrogenesis. Although Bone Morphogenetic Protein-2 (BMP-2) has been reported to induce Sox9 expression, the underlying molecular mechanism remains elusive. Here, we used in vivo approaches to characterize BMP-2-induced alterations in chromatin organization around the Sox9 core promoter. Nuclease hypersensitive site mapping following BMP-2 stimulation showed an inducible hypersensitive site in the Sox9 proximal promoter. Immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) experiments demonstrated that BMP-2 increased the association of the transcription factor NF-Y with histone acetyltransferase p300/CBP. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) analysis showed the binding of the NF-Y-p300 complex to the Sox9 gene proximal promoter along with PCAF and RNA polymerase II. We also found that BMP-2 stimulation caused histone hyperacetylation and methylation at the Sox9 gene. Collectively, these data suggest that the activation of Sox9 gene transcription by BMP-2 is associated with chromatin remodeling and histone modification.",M1
19085115,"Selection and characterization of antibodies from phage display libraries against internalizing membrane antigens.Macromolecular delivery systems require high target cell specificity and efficient intracellular uptake. Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have been shown to successfully meet these needs and should, due to their biological nature and thus minimal toxicity and limited immunogenicity, be optimal delivery vehicles for various macromolecules (e.g., toxins, drugs, oligonucleotides). Such antibodies could be retrieved from phage display libraries by carefully designed selection and screening methods. In this chapter, we provide protocols for the isolation of phage-derived antibodies reactive to cell surface receptors, which upon binding will induce receptor-mediated internalization of the antibody/receptor complexes. In addition, a protocol describing the identification of target antigens by immunoprecipitation (<e>ip</e>) of cell lysates and preparation of gel plugs for subsequent MALDI-TOF analysis is included. Furthermore, we suggest several techniques that could be employed to confirm the specificity as well as the drug delivery potential of isolated clones.",M1
18948291,"Identification and characterization of extensive intra-molecular associations between 3'-UTRs and their ORFs.During eukaryotic translation, mRNAs may form intra-molecular interactions between distant domains. The 5'-cap and the polyA tail were shown to interact through their associated proteins, and this can induce physical compaction of the mRNA in vitro. However, the stability of this intra-molecular association in translating mRNAs and whether additional contacts exist in vivo are largely unknown. To explore this, we applied a novel approach in which several endogenous polysomal mRNAs from Saccharomyces cerevisiae were cleaved near their stop codon and the resulting 3'-UTR fragments were tested either for co-sedimentation or co-immunoprecipitation (co-<e>IP</e>) with their ORFs. In all cases a significant fraction of the 3'-UTR fragments sedimented similarly to their ORF-containing fragments, yet the extent of co-sedimentation differed between mRNAs. Similar observations were obtained by a co-IP assay. Interestingly, various treatments that are expected to interfere with the cap to polyA interactions had no effect on the co-sedimentation pattern. Moreover, the 3'-UTR appeared to co-sediment with different regions from within the ORF. Taken together, these results indicate extensive physical associations between 3'-UTRs and their ORFs that vary between genes. This implies that polyribosomal mRNAs are in a compact configuration in vivo.",M1
18407364,"Determination of editors at the novel A-to-I editing positions.A-to-I RNA editing modifies a variety of biologically important mRNAs, and is specifically catalyzed by either adenosine deaminase acting on RNA type 1 (ADAR1) or type 2 (ADAR2) in mammals including human. Recently several novel A-to-I editing sites were identified in mRNAs abundantly expressed in mammalian organs by means of computational genomic analysis, but which enzyme catalyzes these editing sites has not been determined. Using RNA interference (RNAi) knockdowns, we found that cytoplasmic fragile X mental retardation protein interacting protein 2 (CYFIP2) mRNA had an ADAR2-mediated editing position and bladder cancer associated protein (BLCAP) mRNA had an ADAR1-mediated editing position. In addition, we found that ADAR2 forms a complex with mRNAs with ADAR2-mediated editing positions including GluR2, kv1.1 and CYFIP2 mRNAs, particularly when the editing sites were edited in human cerebellum by means of immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) method. CYFIP2 mRNA was ubiquitously expressed in human tissues with variable extents of K/E site editing. Because ADAR2 underactivity may be a causative molecular change of death of motor neurons in sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), this newly identified ADAR2-mediated editing position may become a useful tool for ALS research.",M1

Three different approaches for performing IP will be discussed; traditional (classical) method, oriented affinity method and direct affinity method. The traditional method of incubating the IP antibody with the sample and sequentially binding to Protein A or G agarose beads (resin) facilitates the most efficient target antigen recovery. However, this approach results in the target protein becoming contaminated with the IP antibody that can interfere with downstream analyses. The orientated affinity method uses Protein A or G beads to serve as an anchor to which the IP antibody is crosslinked thereby preventing the antibody from co-eluting with the target protein. Similarly, the direct affinity method also immobilizes the IP antibody except in this case it is directly attached to a chemically activated support. Both methods prevent co-elution of the IP antibody enabling reuse of the immunomatrix. All three approaches have unique advantages and can also be used for co-immunoprecipitation to study protein:protein interactions and investigate the functional proteome.",M1
18325661,"Generation of novel monoclonal antibodies and their application for detecting ARD1 expression in colorectal cancer.Arrest defective 1 (ARD1) is an acetyltransferase involved in cell cycle control in yeast. ARD1 interacts with human N-acetyltransferase (NATH) to form a functional N-terminal acetyltransferase complex. Recently it had been linked with proliferation and apoptosis in mammalian cells, but its function in cancer development remains unclear. To evaluate significance of ARD1 expression in human colorectal cancer, we generated a panel of monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) with high specificity and sensitivity against ARD1. All of the 10 different clones could be used in ELISA and Western blot, and clone 10C12, 13G2, and 4D10 can interact with ARD1 in eukaryotic cells by immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>). Clones of 14D4 and 10C12 were strongly reacted to ARD1 in immunocytochemistry (ICH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC). ARD1 expression was evaluated in human colorectal cancer and colitis tissues by immunohistochemical analysis with mAb 14D4. Forty-one were ARD1-positive in 50 colorectal cancer tissues and only 12 were weak positive in the 50 matched normal tissues (P &lt; 0.001). Moreover, ARD1 expression was not detectable in 20 cases of colitis tissue (P &lt; 0.001). Furthermore, all of the six human colorectal cancer cell lines we examined were also ARD1-positive at mRNA and protein levels. Taken together, the novel mAbs against ARD1 we generated could be good tools for both basic and clinical studies, and ARD1 could be a potential biomarker in colorectal cancer.",M1
18324484,"Detection and immunochemical characterization of glutamic acid decarboxylase autoantibodies in patients with autoimmune diabetes mellitus.Since GAD65 undergoes post-translational processing and targeting to subcellular compartments and membranes, it may exhibit different immunochemical properties in the cell context compared with the soluble protein expressed in the cell-free eukaryotic system used in the reference method for GADA assessment (radioligand binding assay (RBA)). In the present work, we detected and characterized GADA in 72 sera from patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) and 14 sera from adult-onset diabetes patients using analytical systems in which GAD65 is expressed in a cellular context: confocal indirect immunofluorescence (IIF) and electron microscopy after immunogold labeling on monolayers of transfected Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, and immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) of metabolically labeled GAD65. Eighteen serum samples, 16 from type 1 diabetes patients and two from adult-onset diabetes patients, were positive by confocal IIF but scored negative by RBA. All of these 18 sera immunoprecipitated a 65 kDa protein, supporting the existence of the GADA marker in such patients. It may be concluded that GADA negativity by the conventional RBA method using the soluble antigen, as well as negativity for other common markers measured by similar methods, is not enough to rule out the existence of the specific autoimmune component in childhood or adult-onset diabetes. Other analytical methods based in a more physiological presentation of the autoantigen structure, as confocal IIF and IP, bring an extra support to assess the complete repertoire of specific autoantibodies to native-like and membrane-bound, or denatured, beta-cell antigens.",M1
18321973,"Virion-wide protein interactions of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus.Herpesvirus virions are highly organized structures built through specific protein-protein interactions. Thus, revelation of the protein interactions among virion proteins will shed light on the processes and the mechanisms of virion formation. Recently, we identified 24 virion proteins of Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), using a proteomic approach (F. X. Zhu et al., J. Virol. 79:800-811, 2005). In the current study, a comprehensive analysis of protein-protein interaction between KSHV virion proteins was carried out using yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) and coimmunoprecipitation (co-<e>IP</e>) approaches. Every pairwise combination between KSHV tegument and capsid proteins, between tegument and envelope proteins, and among tegument proteins was tested for possible binary interaction. Thirty-seven protein-protein interactions were identified by both Y2H and co-IP analyses. The results revealed interactions between tegument and capsid proteins such as that of open reading frame 64 (ORF64) with ORF25 (major capsid protein [MCP]), ORF62 (triplex-1 [TRI-1]), and ORF26 (TRI-2). Many interactions were detected among the tegument proteins. ORF64 was found to interact with several tegument proteins including ORF11, ORF21, ORF33, ORF45, ORF63, ORF75, and ORF64 itself, suggesting that ORF64 may serve as a hub protein and play a role in recruiting tegument proteins during tegumentation and virion assembly. Our investigation also revealed redundant interactions between tegument proteins and envelope glycoproteins. These interactions are believed to contribute to final envelopment in virion assembly. Overall, this study allows us to establish a virion-wide protein interaction map, which provides insight into the architecture of the KSHV virion and sets up a foundation for exploring the functions of these proteins in viral particle assembly.",M1
18213612,"Heterotrimeric Galphaq11 co-immunoprecipitates with surface-anchored GRP78 from plasma membranes of alpha2M*-stimulated macrophages.We have previously shown that a fraction of newly expressed GRP78 is translocated to the cell surface in association with the co-chaperone MTJ-1. Proteinase and methylamine-activated alpha(2)M (alpha(2)M*) bind to cell surface-associated GRP78 activating phosphoinositide-specific phospholipase C coupled to a pertussis toxin-insensitive heterotrimeric G protein, generating <e>IP</e>(3)/calcium signaling. We have now studied the association of pertussis toxin-insensitive Galphaq11, with GRP78/MTJ-1 complexes in the plasma membranes of alpha(2)M*-stimulated macrophages. When GRP78 was immunoprecipitated from plasma membranes of macrophages stimulated with alpha(2)M*, Galphaq11, and MTJ-1 were co-precipitated. Likewise Galphaq11 and GRP78 co-immunoprecipitated with MTJ-1 while GRP78 and MTJ-1 co-immunoprecipitated with Galphaq11. Silencing GRP78 expression with GRP78 dsRNA or MTJ-1 with MTJ-1 dsRNA greatly reduced the levels of Galphaq11 co-precipitated with GRP78 or MTJ-1. In conclusion, we show here that plasma membrane-associated GRP78 is coupled to pertussis toxin-insensitive Galphaq11 and forms a ternary signaling complex with MTJ-1.",M1
18187205,"Qualitative and quantitative characterization of the amyloid beta peptide (Abeta) population in biological matrices using an immunoprecipitation-LC/MS assay.Targeting the metabolism of amyloid beta peptides (Abeta) is currently the leading experimental approach to treatment of Alzheimer's disease (AD). Described here is an immunoprecipitation-liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (<e>ip</e>-LC/MS) assay to simultaneously characterize and quantitate different forms of Abeta in biological samples. The 4G8 antibody, specific for the 17-24 amino acid epitope of Abeta was employed to selectively isolate Abeta from in vitro samples for subsequent LC-MS analysis. A high resolution accurate mass hybrid linear ion trap-Orbitrap, LTQ-Orbitrap mass spectrometer was used to identify forms of 12 Abeta in H4-APP751 swe cell extracts based on ab initio calculations, accurate mass measurements, isotopic modeling and by de novo peptide sequencing using tandem mass spectrometry. The quantitative LC-MS analysis was performed on a linear ion trap mass spectrometer, LTQ, in full scan mode, this mode of operation enables sensitive detection levels and post-acquisition data mining for different forms of Abeta for quantitative assessment. Dosing studies with three known inhibitors of Abeta production, sulindac sulfide (SSide), BMS-299897 ('897) and compound W (CW) are reported to demonstrate the utility and analytical characteristics of the assay. This assay has the potential to provide insight into the formation of Abeta; increase understanding of drug mechanisms; and to contribute to drug efficacy studies.",M1
18184736,"Coimmunopurification of phosphorylated bacterial- and plant-type phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylases with the plastidial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex from developing castor oil seeds.The phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC) interactome of developing castor oil seed (COS; Ricinus communis) endosperm was assessed using coimmunopurification (co-<e>IP</e>) followed by proteomic analysis. Earlier studies suggested that immunologically unrelated 107-kD plant-type PEPCs (p107/PTPC) and 118-kD bacterial-type PEPCs (p118/BTPC) are subunits of an unusual 910-kD hetero-octameric class 2 PEPC complex of developing COS. The current results confirm that a tight physical interaction occurs between p118 and p107 because p118 quantitatively coimmunopurified with p107 following elution of COS extracts through an anti-p107-IgG immunoaffinity column. No PEPC activity or immunoreactive PEPC polypeptides were detected in the corresponding flow-through fractions. Although BTPCs lack the N-terminal phosphorylation motif characteristic of PTPCs, Pro-Q Diamond phosphoprotein staining, immunoblotting with phospho-serine (Ser)/threonine Akt substrate IgG, and phosphate-affinity PAGE established that coimmunopurified p118 was multiphosphorylated at unique Ser and/or threonine residues. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of an endoproteinase Lys-C p118 peptide digest demonstrated that Ser-425 is subject to in vivo proline-directed phosphorylation. The co-IP of p118 with p107 did not appear to be influenced by their phosphorylation status. Because p118 phosphorylation was unchanged 48 h following elimination of photosynthate supply due to COS depodding, the signaling mechanisms responsible for photosynthate-dependent p107 phosphorylation differ from those controlling p118's in vivo phosphorylation. A 110-kD PTPC coimmunopurified with p118 and p107 when depodded COS was used. The plastidial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex (PDC(pl)) was identified as a novel PEPC interactor. Thus, a putative metabolon involving PEPC and PDC(pl) could function to channel carbon from phosphoenolpyruvate to acetyl-coenzyme A and/or to recycle CO(2) from PDC(pl) to PEPC.",M1
18161010,"The cytoplasmic domain of chondrolectin interacts with the beta-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase.Mouse chondrolectin (chodl) was isolated out of the tail tip of four-day old 129/SvJ mice as a by-product of a PCR-based subtractive cDNA library screening. The gene is predominantly expressed in adult skeletal muscle, heart, testes and lungs and in embryonic stadia. Chodl is the mouse homologue of human chondrolectin (CHODL), a gene that encodes for a type Ia transmembrane protein and that is expressed in human testis, prostate, heart and skeletal muscle tissue. CHODL-splice variants (CHODL ( f ), CHODL ( f Delta E ), CHODL ( Delta E )) are detected in human leukocytes. The proteins of the chondrolectin family belong to the family of C-type lectins. As the members of this protein family are important for a wide array of biological processes, the function of chodl was investigated by searching for its protein interaction partners. The beta-subunit of Rab geranylgeranyl transferase (Rabggtb) was isolated 8 times after a complete Sos recruitment system (SRS) screen with the cytoplasmic domain of chodl. The interaction was confirmed with in vitro transcription/translation and co-immunoprecipitation (co-<e>IP</e>) experiments.",M1
18160415,"Proteomic screen defines the hepatocyte nuclear factor 1alpha-binding partners and identifies HMGB1 as a new cofactor of HNF1alpha.Hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1alpha is one of the liver-enriched transcription factors involved in many tissue-specific expressions of hepatic genes. The molecular mechanisms for determining HNF1alpha-mediated transactivation have not been explained fully. To identify unknown proteins that interact with HNF1alpha, we developed a co-<e>IP</e>-MS strategy to search HNF1alpha interactions, and high mobility group protein-B1 (HMGB1), a chromosomal protein, was identified as a novel HNF1alpha-interacting protein. In vitro glutathione S-transferase pull-down and in vivo co-immunoprecipitation studies confirmed an interaction between HMGB1 and HNF1alpha. The protein-protein interaction was mediated through the HMG box domains of HMGB1 and the homeodomain of HNF1alpha. Furthermore, electrophoretic mobility shift assay and chromatin-immunoprecipitation assay demonstrated that HMGB1 was recruited to endogenous HNF1alpha-responsive promoters and enhanced HNF1alpha binding to its cognate DNA sequences. Moreover, luciferase reporter analyses showed that HMGB1 potentiated the transcriptional activities of HNF1alpha in cultured cells, and downregulation of HMGB1 by RNA interference specifically affected the HNF1alpha-dependent gene expression in HepG2 cell. Taken together, these findings raise the intriguing possibility that HMGB1 is a new cofactor of HNF1alpha and participates in HNF1alpha-mediated transcription regulation through protein-protein interaction.",M1
18083897,"Treatment with an adenoviral vector encoding hepatocyte growth factor mitigates established cardiac dysfunction in doxorubicin-induced cardiomyopathy.Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) reportedly exerts beneficial effects on the heart following myocardial infarction and during nonischemic cardiomyopathy, but the precise mechanisms underlying the latter have not been well elucidated. We generated nonischemic cardiomyopathy in mice by injecting them with doxorubicin (15 mg/kg <e>ip</e>). Two weeks later, when cardiac dysfunction was apparent, an adenoviral vector encoding human HGF gene (Ad.CAG-HGF, 1x10(11) particles/mouse) was injected into the hindlimb muscles; LacZ gene served as the control. Left ventricular dilatation and dysfunction normally seen 4 wk after doxorubicin administration were significantly mitigated in HGF-treated mice, as were the associated cardiomyocyte atrophy/degeneration and myocardial fibrosis. Myocardial expression of GATA-4 and a sarcomeric protein, myosin heavy chain, was downregulated by doxorubicin, but the expression of both was restored by HGF treatment. The protective effect of HGF against doxorubicin-induced cardiomyocyte atrophy was confirmed in an in vitro experiment, which also showed that neither cardiomyocyte apoptosis nor proliferation plays significant roles in the present model. Upregulation of c-Met/HGF receptor was noted in HGF-treated hearts. Among the mediators downstream of c-Met, the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) was reduced by doxorubicin, but the activity was restored by HGF. Levels of transforming growth factor-beta1 and cyclooxygenase-2 did not differ between the groups. Our findings suggest the HGF gene delivery exerts therapeutic antiatrophic/degenerative and antifibrotic effects on myocardium in cases of established cardiac dysfunction caused by doxorubicin. These beneficial effects appear to be related to HGF-induced ERK activation and upregulation of c-Met, GATA-4, and sarcomeric proteins.",M1

The two-hybrid assay provides for a convenient start to find the minimal interaction domains, which generally produce well-behaved recombinant proteins suited for various in vitro interaction assays. Emphasis is placed on demonstrating physiological relevance of identified interactions. The effective strategy is to find mutations that reduce the interaction by genetic or site-directed mutational approaches and obtain correlations between their effects in vitro (GST pull down) and effects in vivo (co-IP).",M1
17681692,"Nurr1 is phosphorylated by ERK2 in vitro and its phosphorylation upregulates tyrosine hydroxylase expression in SH-SY5Y cells.Nurr1 is an orphan nuclear receptor essential for development and survival of dopaminergic neurons. Mutations in Nurr1 are associated with Parkinson's disease (PD) and there is a correlation between Nurr1 and tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) expression in PD brain. Two domains, activation function 1 (AF1) at the N-terminus and AF2 at the C-terminus of Nurr1, are important for Nurr1 activation. AF1 domain is conserved in NGFI-B/Nurr1/Nor-1 family members and MAPK signal pathway is involved in AF1 activity. Using in vitro phoshorylation assays, we have shown that ERK2 is a kinase to phosphorylate Nurr1 on multiple sites. S126 and T132, which are located near AF1 core of Nurr1, are dominant sites phosphorylated by ERK2. Moreover, using GST pull-down and co-<e>IP</e> assays, we identified that both the N-terminus of Nurr1 containing three ERK docking domains and another ERK docking domain in Nurr1 DNA binding domain are able to bind to ERK2. Furthermore, overexpression of a constitutively active form of MEK1, together with Nurr1 and mouse ERK2, greatly increases the tyrosine hydroxylase expression in SH-SY5Y cells. Reporter gene assays show that Nurr1Delta124-133/T185A, an ERK2 phospho-site mutant form, could not further increase its transcriptional activity on TH promoter, suggesting that Nurr1 phosphorylation by ERK2 may regulate its transcriptional activity on TH promoter. Thus, our results indicate that Nurr1 phosphorylation by ERK2 may play a role in regulating the TH expression.",M1
17681385,"Reactivity of monoclonal antibodies to human CD antigens with cells from mink.Three hundred and seventy six monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) raised against human leukocyte surface antigens were analyzed by flow cytometry for cross reactivities against mink leukocytes. We found 53 mAbs (14%) to cross react. This study defined cross reactions to the following human markers: CD1a, CD9 (4 mAbs), CD10, CD11a (2 mAbs), CD14 (3 mAbs), CD18 (5 mAbs), CD20 (atypical reaction), CD21, CD25 (atypical reaction), CD29 (3 mAbs), CD32, CD41, CD42a, CD44 (4 mAbs), CD45, CD45RO, CD47 (2 mAbs), CD49d (3 mAbs), CD61 (2 mAbs), CD62P, CD66abcd, CD71, CD75s, CD79b (2 mAbs), CD86, CD88, CD104 (atypical reaction), CD172a, CD236R (glycophorin C, (atypical reaction)), Xg(a) carbohydrate antigen, Rhesus antigen and two unspecified PAN-reactive mAbs. In order to characterize the molecular mass of the corresponding cross reacting mink markers, the mAbs were used to immunoprecipitate the surface antigens. Fourteen mAbs out of the 53 mAbs reactive with mink leukocytes gave reproducible <e>IP</e> findings. The masses of the precipitated antigens were generally in good agreement with those of the homologous human markers. We also performed immunohistochemical staining analyses on formalin fixed, paraffin embedded mink tissue from lymph node and spleen, and found 7 out of 22 mAbs to give a positive signal. Generally, the immunohistological analyses resulted in expected staining patterns.",M1
17631732,"Validation of a new immunoenzymatic method to detect antibodies to RNA polymerase III in systemic sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: To test the reliability of a new enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to identify anti-RNA polymerase III (RNAP III) positive sera from Italian patients with Systemic Sclerosis (SSc) and other chronic inflammatory disorders. METHODS: A comparison between the new ELISA for anti-RNAP III and the gold standard technique, immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>), was first performed on 106 SSc patients, 16 patients with other connective tissue diseases and 10 healthy subjects. A further ELISA evaluation was performed on 224 SSc patients, 120 subjects with other rheumatic or infectious diseases, and 81 healthy controls. RESULTS: Plotting ELISA and IP data in a Receiver Operator Characteristic curve, the ELISA cut-off value providing the best specificity (99.1%) and sensibility (100%) was 28 U/ml (AUC=0.999; p&lt;0.0001). Using this cut-off in the second analysis, anti-RNAP III positive results were found in 41 (18.3%) SSc patients, all negative for anticentromere or anti-topoisomerase I antibodies, while only 3 subjects tested positive among the 120 sera collected from other patients. All the healthy subjects were negative. CONCLUSION: This new ELISA for anti-RNAP III is highly accurate when a proper cut-off value is employed and represents a valid substitute to IP in a clinical setting.",M1
17584762,"Quantitative analysis of amyloid-beta peptides in cerebrospinal fluid using immunoprecipitation and MALDI-Tof mass spectrometry.Immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) combined with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) time of flight (Tof) mass spectrometry has been used to develop quantitative assays for amyloid-beta (Abeta) peptides in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Inclusion of (15)N labelled standard peptides allows for absolute quantification of multiple Abeta isoforms in individual samples. Characterization of variability associated with all steps of the assay indicated that the IP step is the single largest contributor to overall variability. Optimization of the assay resulted in overall coefficient of variation &lt;or=8% with high agreement to an Abeta(1-40) and Abeta(1-42) ELISA assay.

17551170,"High-sensitivity detection and quantitative analysis of native protein-protein interactions and multiprotein complexes by flow cytometry.Most mechanisms of cell development, physiology, and signal transduction are controlled by protein-protein interactions. Immunoprecipitation of multiprotein complexes detected by flow cytometry (<e>IP</e>-FCM) is a means to quantitatively measure these interactions. The high sensitivity of this method makes it useful even when very little biomaterial is available for analysis, as in the case of rare primary cell subsets or patient samples. Detection of the T cell antigen receptor associated with the CD3 multiprotein complex from as few as 300 primary murine T cells is presented as an example. The method is compatible with quantitative flow cytometry techniques, making it possible to estimate the number of coimmunoprecipitated molecules. Both constitutive and inducible protein-protein interactions can be analyzed, as illustrated in related methodology using glutathione S-transferase-fusion protein pull-down experiments. IP-FCM represents a robust, quantitative, biochemical technique to assess native protein-protein interactions, without requiring genetic engineering or large sample sizes.",M1
17534899,"Neuronal protein synuclein gamma predicts poor clinical outcome in breast cancer.Synuclein gamma (SNCG), previously identified as a breast cancer-specific gene (BCSG1), is highly expressed in breast carcinomas but not in normal epithelium. SNCG regulates many pathways in growth and progression of breast cancer. To determine if SNCG is a biomarker for clinical prognosis of breast cancer, we generated a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against human SNCG and correlated SNCG protein expression in 358 clinical breast cancer specimens with clinical outcome. A panel of 14 mAbs was characterized by ELISA, immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>), Western blot, immunocytochemistry and immunohistochemistry. SNCG protein expression was determined in 438 clinical breast specimens by immunohistochemical analysis using mAb 5C5. Expression of SNCG was strongly correlated with the stage, lymph node involvement, metastasis, tumor size and Her-2 status, but its expression was not associated with ER and PR expression status. While 71.4% of advanced breast cancers were positive for SNCG expression, only 26.8% of Stage I/II breast cancers were positive for SNCG expression and 5.2% of benign hyperplasia expressed SNCG. SNCG protein was not detectable in normal tissue adjacent to breast cancer. After a median follow-up of 64 months, patients with an SNCG-positive tumor had a significantly shorter disease-free survival and overall survival and a high probability of death compared no expression of SNCG. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that SNCG was a strong independent prognostic variable. SNCG is a new unfavorable prognostic marker for breast cancer progression and a potential target for breast cancer treatment.",M1
17533374,"HIF-1 and NF-kappaB-mediated upregulation of CXCR1 and CXCR2 expression promotes cell survival in hypoxic prostate cancer cells.Hypoxic cancer cells are resistant to treatment, leading to the selection of cells with a more malignant phenotype. The expression of interleukin-8 (IL-8) plays an important role in the tumorigenesis and metastasis of solid tumors including prostate cancer. Recently, we detected elevated expression of IL-8 and IL-8 receptors in human prostate cancer tissue. The objective of the current study was to determine whether hypoxia increases IL-8 and IL-8 receptor expression in prostate cancer cells and whether this contributes to a survival advantage in hypoxic cells. IL-8, CXCR1 and CXCR2 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression in PC3 cells was upregulated in response to hypoxia in a time-dependent manner. Elevated IL-8 secretion following hypoxia was detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, while immunoblotting confirmed elevated receptor expression. Attenuation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF-1) and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) transcriptional activity using small interfering RNA (siRNA), a HIF-1 dominant-negative and pharmacological inhibitors, abrogated hypoxia-induced transcription of CXCR1 and CXCR2 in PC3 cells. Furthermore, chromatin-<e>IP</e> analysis demonstrated binding of HIF-1 and NF-kappaB to CXCR1. Finally, inhibition of IL-8 signaling potentiated etoposide-induced cell death in hypoxic PC3 cells. These results suggest that IL-8 signaling confers a survival advantage to hypoxic prostate cancer cells, and therefore, strategies to inhibit IL-8 signaling may sensitize hypoxic tumor cells to conventional treatments.",M1
17472703,"Activation of the canonical Wnt pathway by the antipsychotics haloperidol and clozapine involves dishevelled-3.Protein kinase B (Akt), glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) and members of the Wnt signal transduction pathway were recently found to be altered in schizophrenia and targeted by antipsychotic drugs. In the current study, selected Wnt signalling proteins were investigated to determine if they are altered by the antipsychotics clozapine or haloperidol in the rat prefrontal cortex. Pheochromocytoma (PC12) and neuroblastoma (SH-SY5Y) cells were also used to elucidate how antipsychotics generated the pattern of changes observed in vivo. Western blotting (WB) revealed that treatment with haloperidol or clozapine caused an up-regulation of Wnt-5a, dishevelled-3, Axin, total and phosphorylated GSK-3 and beta-catenin protein levels. Treatment of PC12 and SH-SY5Y cells with a variety of pharmacological agents as well as the over-expression of several Wnt related proteins failed to mimic the pattern observed in vivo following antipsychotic treatment. However, the over-expression of dishevelled-3 nearly perfectly duplicated the changes observed in vivo. Immunoprecipitations (<e>IP</e>) conducted using protein isolated from the rat prefrontal cortex indicated that dishevelled-3 is associated with the D2 dopamine receptor thereby suggesting that antipsychotics may act on dishevelled-3 via D2 dopamine receptors to initiate a cascade of downstream changes involving Axin, GSK-3 and beta-catenin that may help to alleviate psychosis in schizophrenic patients.",M1
17443672,"14-3-3 sigma isoform interacts with the cytoplasmic domain of the transmembrane BP180 in keratinocytes.The protein bullous pemphigoid antigen-2 (BPAG2/BP180/collagen type XVII) plays a key role in attachment of basal keratinocytes to epidermal basement membrane. The binding of BP180 with either integrin alpha6, integrin beta4, or bullous pemphigoid antigen-1 (BPAG1/BP230) is critical for this attachment in skin. The protein 14-3-3 sigma, also known as stratifin and a marker for epithelial cells, is a member of a highly conserved small acidic 14-3-3 protein family naturally found in all eukaryotic cells. Here, we have used a 14-3-3sigma GST pull-down screening assay and showed that sigma (sigma) isoform of the 14-3-3 protein family interacts with the cytoplasmic N-terminal domain of BP180. Analysis of a series of truncated or deleted 14-3-3sigma revealed that only intact 14-3-3sigma molecule, but not any of its fragments can interact with BP180. This finding suggests that conformation and possible dimerization of 14-3-3 sigma is essential for this interaction. Further, a BP180 co-immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) and its reverse IP assays were conducted and the results confirmed that 14-3-3 sigma interacts with cytoplasmic domain, but not ecto-domain of the BP180. In conclusion, the finding of this study provides evidence that 14-3-3sigma isoform interacts with BP180 which is a major component of hemidesmosome involved in the attachment of epidermis to the basement membrane in skin. However, the significance of this interaction in hemidesmosome formation and/or attachment needs to be explored.",M1
17183698,"'Fractional recovery' analysis of a presynaptic synaptotagmin 1-anchored endocytic protein complex.BACKGROUND: The integral synaptic vesicle protein and putative calcium sensor, synaptotagmin 1 (STG), has also been implicated in synaptic vesicle (SV) recovery. However, proteins with which STG interacts during SV endocytosis remain poorly understood. We have isolated an STG-associated endocytic complex (SAE) from presynaptic nerve terminals and have used a novel fractional recovery (FR) assay based on electrostatic dissociation to identify SAE components and map the complex structure. The location of SAE in the presynaptic terminal was determined by high-resolution quantitative immunocytochemistry at the chick ciliary ganglion giant calyx-type synapse. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPLE FINDINGS: The first step in FR analysis was to immunoprecipitate (<e>IP</e>) the complex with an antibody against one protein component (the IP-protein). The immobilized complex was then exposed to a high salt (1150 mM) stress-test that caused shedding of co-immunoprecipitated proteins (co-IP-proteins). A Fractional Recovery ratio (FR: recovery after high salt/recovery with control salt as assayed by Western blot) was calculated for each co-IP-protein. These FR values reflect complex structure since an easily dissociated protein, with a low FR value, cannot be intermediary between the IP-protein and a salt-resistant protein. The structure of the complex was mapped and a blueprint generated with a pair of FR analyses generated using two different IP-proteins. The blueprint of SAE contains an AP180/X/STG/stonin 2/intersectin/epsin core (X is unknown and epsin is hypothesized), and an AP2 adaptor, H-/L-clathrin coat and dynamin scission protein perimeter. Quantitative immunocytochemistry (ICA/ICQ method) at an isolated calyx-type presynaptic terminal indicates that this complex is associated with STG at the presynaptic transmitter release face but not with STG on intracellular synaptic vesicles. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: We hypothesize that the SAE serves as a recognition site and also as a seed complex for clathrin-mediated synaptic vesicle recovery. The combination of FR analysis with quantitative immunocytochemistry provides a novel and effective strategy for the identification and characterization of biologically-relevant multi-molecular complexes.",M1
17108359,"The telomerase-recruitment domain of the telomere binding protein Cdc13 is regulated by Mec1p/Tel1p-dependent phosphorylation.The DNA damage-responsive protein kinases ATM and ATR phosphorylate SQ/TQ motifs that lie in clusters in most of their in vivo targets. Budding yeast Cdc13p contains two clusters of SQ/TQ motifs, suggesting that it might be a target of Mec1p/Tel1p (yeast ATR/ATM). Here we demonstrated that the telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p is phosphorylated by Mec1p and Tel1p. Gel analysis showed that Cdc13p contains a Mec1/Tel1-dependent post-translational modification. Using an immunoprecipitate (<e>IP</e>)-kinase assay, we showed that Mec1p phosphorylates Cdc13p on serine 225, 249, 255 and 306, and Tel1p phosphorylates Cdc13p on serine 225, 249 and 255 in vitro. Phenotypic analysis in vivo revealed that the mutations in the Cdc13p SQ motifs phosphorylated by Mec1p and Tel1p caused multiple telomere and growth defects. In addition, normal telomere length and growth could be restored by expressing a Cdc13-Est1p hybrid protein. These results demonstrate the telomerase recruitment domain of Cdc13p as an important new telomere-specific target of Mec1p/Tel1p.",M1
16931877,"Genome-wide analysis of mRNAs bound to the histone stem-loop binding protein.The replication-dependent histone mRNAs are cell-cycle-regulated and expressed only during S phase. In contrast to all other eukaryotic mRNAs, the histone mRNAs end in a highly conserved 16-nucleotide stem-loop rather than a poly(A) tail. The stem-loop is necessary and sufficient for the post-transcriptional regulation of histone mRNA during the cell cycle. The histone mRNA 3' stem-loop is bound by the stem-loop binding protein (SLBP) that is involved in pre-mRNA processing, translation, and stability of histone mRNA. Immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) of RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) followed by microarray analysis has been used to identify the targets of RNA-binding proteins. This method is sometimes referred to as RIP-Chip (RNA IP followed by microarray analysis). Here we introduce a variation on the RIP-Chip method that uses a recombinant RBP to identify mRNA targets in a pool of total RNA; we call this method recombinant, or rRIP-Chip. Using this method, we show that recombinant SLBP binds exclusively to all five classes of histone mRNA. We also analyze the messages bound to the endogenous SLBP on polyribosomes by immunoprecipitation. We use two different microarray platforms to identify enriched mRNAs. Both platforms demonstrate remarkable specificity and consistency of results. Our data suggest that the replication-dependent histone mRNAs are likely to be the sole target of SLBP.",M1
16879880,"Ovine progressive pneumonia virus capsid is B-cell immunodominant using Western blot analysis: a comparison of sensitivity between Western blot analysis and immunoprecipitation.A Western blot assay was developed and analyzed against the comparable standard, immunoprecipitation of (35)[S]-methionine/cysteine-labeled ovine progressive pneumonia virus (OPPV) proteins, for its ability to detect anti-OPPV antibodies using endpoint titers. Western blot analysis is 12-fold more sensitive in detecting endpoint anti-capsid antibody titers than <e>IP</e>, and the capsid is the B-cell immunodominant OPPV protein when utilizing Western blot analysis. Since the surface envelope glycoprotein is the B-cell immunodominant OPPV protein when utilizing immunoprecipitation, this suggests immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis measure different types of antibody that are more specific for conformational and linear OPPV protein epitopes, respectively.",M1
16846524,"Autoantibodies against the replication protein A complex in systemic lupus erythematosus and other autoimmune diseases.Replication protein A (RPA), a heterotrimer with subunits of molecular masses 70, 32, and 14 kDa, is a single-stranded-DNA-binding factor involved in DNA replication, repair, and recombination. There have been only three reported cases of anti-RPA in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjögren syndrome (SjS). This study sought to clarify the clinical significance of autoantibodies against RPA. Sera from 1,119 patients enrolled during the period 2000 to 2005 were screened by immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) of 35S-labeled K562 cell extract. Antigen-capture ELISA with anti-RPA32 mAb, immunofluorescent antinuclear antibodies (ANA) and western blot analysis with purified RPA were also performed. Our results show that nine sera immunoprecipitated the RPA70-RPA32-RPA14 complex and all were strongly positive by ELISA (titers 1:62,500 to 1:312,500). No additional sera were positive by ELISA and subsequently confirmed by IP or western blotting. All sera showed fine speckled/homogeneous nuclear staining. Anti-RPA was found in 1.4% (4/276) of SLE and 2.5% (1/40) of SjS sera, but not in rheumatoid arthritis (0/35), systemic sclerosis (0/47), or polymyositis/dermatomyositis (0/43). Eight of nine patients were female and there was no racial predilection. Other positive patients had interstitial lung disease, autoimmune thyroiditis/hepatitis C virus/pernicious anemia, or an unknown diagnosis. Autoantibody specificities found in up to 40% of SLE and other diseases, such as anti-nRNP, anti-Sm, anti-Ro, and anti-La, were unusual in anti-RPA-positive sera. Only one of nine had anti-Ro, and zero of nine had anti-nRNP, anti-Sm, anti-La, or anti-ribosomal P antibodies. In summary, high titers of anti-RPA antibodies were found in nine patients (1.4% of SLE and other diseases). Other autoantibodies found in SLE were rare in this subset, suggesting that patients with anti-RPA may form a unique clinical and immunological subset.",M1
16714389,"Variable in vivo embryoprotective role for ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated against constitutive and phenytoin-enhanced oxidative stress in atm knockout mice.Knockout mice lacking the ataxia-telangiectasia-mutated (Atm) protein exhibit impaired detection and repair of DNA damage and increased embryopathies from ionizing radiation in vivo, and vehicle or phenytoin in embryo culture. Here we determined if Atm-deficient mice are more susceptible in vivo to phenytoin embryopathies. Wild-type (+/+) or heterozygous (+/-) Atm knockout dams were mated with +/- males, pregnant dams were treated with phenytoin (65 mg/kg <e>ip</e>) or its vehicle, and resorptions and fetuses were genotyped and characterized. This strain proved resistant to phenytoin-initiated cleft palates but not to other spontaneous and phenytoin-enhanced embryopathies. With vehicle-treated +/- dams, fetal body weight was lower in homozygous Atm-null (-/-) fetuses compared to +/- and +/+ littermates (p &lt; 0.05). Phenytoin enhanced this Atm-dependent embryopathic pattern (p &lt; 0.05). It also enhanced DNA oxidation in -/- Atm-deficient embryos compared to its +/- Atm-deficient (p &lt; 0.001) and +/+ Atm-normal (p &lt; 0.001), phenytoin-exposed littermates and to its -/- vehicle controls (p &lt; 0.01). Postpartum lethality was greater in both +/- and -/- Atm-deficient fetuses compared to +/+ littermates, independent of treatment (0.05 &lt; p &lt; 0.1). By maternal genotype, +/- Atm-deficient dams had fewer implantations than +/+ dams, independent of treatment, and phenytoin decreased litter size (p &lt; 0.05). Conversely, phenytoin-exposed +/+ fetuses were more likely than -/- littermates to die in utero (p &lt; 0.05), and in +/+ dams fetal resorptions and postpartum lethality were variably higher and enhanced by phenytoin (p &lt; 0.05). Despite variable actions in vivo, the embryoprotective effects of Atm suggest a role for reactive oxygen species and oxidative DNA damage in some spontaneous and phenytoin-enhanced embryopathies.",M1
16688122,"WNK4 kinase regulates surface expression of the human sodium chloride cotransporter in mammalian cells.Pseudohypoaldosteronism type II (PHA II) is caused by mutations of two members of WNK ((with no lysine (k)) kinase family. WNK4 wild type (WT) has been shown to inhibit the activity and surface expression of sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) when expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Here, we have studied NCC protein processing in mammalian cells in the presence or absence of WNK4 WT and its mutants, E562K and R1185C, by surface biotinylation, Western blot, co-immunoprecipitation (Co-<e>IP</e>) and immunostaining. WNK4 WT significantly reduced NCC surface expression in Cos-7 cells (58.9+/-6.8% vs 100% in control, P&lt;0.001, n=6), whereas its mutant E562K has no significant effect on NCC surface expression (92.9+/-5.3% vs 100%, P=NS, n=6). Another mutant R1185C still partially reduces surface expression of NCC (76.2+/-11.8% vs 100%, P&lt;0.05, n=6). The reduction of NCC surface expression by WNK4 WT (62.9+/-3.3% of control group) is not altered by WT dynamin ((61.8+/-3.7% (P=NS)) or its mutant K44A ((65.4+/-14.1% (P=NS)). A Co-IP study showed that both WNK4 WT and WNK4 E562K interact with NCC. Furthermore, a proton pump inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, partially reverses the inhibitory effect of WNK4 WT on NCC expression. Our data suggest that WNK4 WT significantly inhibits NCC surface expression, which is not owing to an increase in clathrin-mediated endocytosis of NCC, but likely results from enhanced degradation of NCC through a lysosomal pathway.",M1
16634755,"Epitope mapping factor VIII A2 domain by affinity-directed mass spectrometry: residues 497-510 and 584-593 comprise a discontinuous epitope for the monoclonal antibody R8B12.The murine monoclonal antibody R8B12 recognizes the C-terminal region (residues 563-740) of the A2 subunit of factor VIIIa [J Biol Chem 266: 1991; p. 20139], as judged by Western blotting. However, the location of the epitope within this region is not known. In the present study, we used affinity-directed mass spectrometry to map the epitope. A2 subunit was digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin and then subjected to immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) using R8B12 IgG. Masses of the affinity-selected peptides were determined directly from the immune complexes by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization mass spectrometry (MALDI-MS). Proteolysis of A2 with the two proteases generated a pre-IP peptide fingerprint that covered approximately 70% of the A2 domain sequence. Analysis of the post-IP tryptic peptide fingerprint showed two masses, 1309 and 1653 Da representing residues 584-593 and 497-510, respectively, determined from a theoretical database search and confirmed by direct sequencing. Results using a chymotryptic digest yielded a single, weakly reactive fragment consistent with residues 577-586, suggesting the importance of residues Ser584-Tyr586 in forming the epitope. A synthetic peptide to residues 584-593 was immunoprecipitated by the IgG and blocked R8B12-directed blotting to A2 subunit. The 497-510 and 584-593 segments were observed to be adjacent and surface exposed in the A2 domain model, and together with the above results suggest that A2 domain residues 497-510 and 584-593 represent a discontinuous epitope for R8B12. Furthermore, based upon blotting specificity, we speculate that residues 584-593 make a substantially greater contribution to the binding energy for this interaction.",M1
16544878,"Immunoaffinity chromatographic and immunoprecipitation methods combined with mass spectrometry for characterization of circulating transthyretin.Transthyretin (TTR) is a small serum protein that is involved in distinct phenotypes of amyloidosis with different tissue localization, age of onset, and rate of progression. Some types of TTR-amyloidosis (such as familial amyloid polyneuropathy) are associated with various amino acid point mutations, while cardiac amyloid myopathy may also be associated with precipitation of the wild-type molecules, e.g., in senile systemic amyloidosis. Because of the unsettled relationship between circulating and precipitated TTR we here explore on-line immunoaffinity (IA) chromatography-MS and immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>)-MS methods for characterizing the circulating TTR population in normal individuals and in patients with known TTR-amyloidosis. It was found necessary to reduce the samples, e.g., with DTT, prior to ESI-TOF-MS. This reversed oxidative modifications to sufficiently resolve the two mass peaks isolated from sera of heterozygous patients. A simple IP technique without the use of centrifugal filtration was found to be convenient for the assessment of the TTR population in serum as demonstrated for both normal and variant (the Met111Leu mutation) TTR. This approach also readily allowed the identification of oxidation, S-sulfation, and S-cysteinylation in unreduced samples, while these modifications were less well resolved in the on-line IA chromatography-MS approach.",M1
16360132,"A direct interaction between TGFbeta activated kinase 1 and the TGFbeta type II receptor: implications for TGFbeta signalling and cardiac hypertrophy.OBJECTIVE: Transforming growth factor beta (TGFbeta)-activated kinase 1 (TAK1) is a MAP kinase kinase kinase involved in numerous signalling pathways and is strongly implicated in cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure. TGFbeta is also associated with hypertension and heart disease, and evidence suggests that TGFbeta1 and TAK1 act together in a cardiac stress signalling pathway. Canonical TGFbeta signalling is mediated through Smad transcription factors, but TGFbeta can also rapidly activate TAK1. The activation of the Smad cascade is well characterised, but little is known about how TAK1 is activated in response to TGFbeta, and no direct link between any MAPK kinase pathway and the TGFbeta receptors has yet been established. Since TAK1 is activated by TGFbeta within 1 min in cardiomyocytes, we hypothesised there might be a direct interaction between TAK1 and one of the TGFbeta receptors. METHODS: We used a combination of in vitro binding assays and co-immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) experiments to investigate whether TAK1 interacted with the type I (ALK1 or ALK5) or type II (TBRII) TGFbeta receptors. Interactions between endogenous proteins were tested using mouse myoblast and rat cardiomyocyte cells. RESULTS: Immunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays show that TAK1 binds directly to TBRII. Precipitation of endogenous TAK1 protein in rat cardiomyocytes shows that, in addition to a direct association with TBRII, it also interacts indirectly with ALK5. CONCLUSIONS: We describe a novel and specific interaction between TAK1 and TBRII which, for the first time, directly links TAK1 to the TGFbeta signalling cascade and potentially explains how TGFbeta signalling in cardiomyocytes mediates a hypertrophic response.",M1
16342244,"Proteomics-based generation and characterization of monoclonal antibodies against human liver mitochondrial proteins.Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) have the potential to be a very powerful tool in proteomics research to determine protein expression, quantification, localization and modification, as well as protein-protein interactions, especially when combined with microarray technology. Thus, a large amount of well-characterized and highly qualified antibodies are needed in proteomics. Purified antigen, which is not always available, has proven to be one of the rate-limiting steps in mAb large-scale generation. Here we describe our strategies to establish a murine hybridoma cell bank for human liver mitochondria using unknown native proteins as the immunogens. The antibody-recognized mitochondrial proteins were identified by MS following immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>), and by screening of human liver cDNA expression library. We found that the established antibodies reacted specifically with a number of important enzymes in mitochondria. The subcellular localization of these antigens in mitochondria was further confirmed by immunohistocytochemistry. A panel of antibodies was also tested for their ability to capture and deplete the targeting proteins and complexes from the total mitochondrial proteins. We believe these well-characterized antibodies would be useful in various applications for Human Liver Proteome Project (HLPP) when the scale of this hybridoma cell bank is enlarged significantly in the near future.",M1
16257978,"A method to find tissue-specific novel sites of selective adenosine deamination.Site-selective adenosine (A) to inosine (I) RNA editing by the ADAR enzymes has been found in a variety of metazoan from fly to human. Here we describe a method to detect novel site-selective A to I editing that can be used on various tissues as well as species. We have shown previously that there is a preference for ADAR2-binding to selectively edited sites over non-specific interactions with random sequences of double-stranded RNA. The method utilizes immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) of intrinsic RNA-protein complexes to extract substrates subjected to site-selective editing in vivo, in combination with microarray analyses of the captured RNAs. We show that known single sites of A to I editing can be detected after IP using an antibody against the ADAR2 protein. The RNA substrates were verified by RT-PCR, RNase protection and microarray. Using this method it is possible to uniquely identify novel single sites of selective A to I editing.",M1
16227602,"Identification and functional outcome of mRNAs associated with RNA-binding protein TIA-1.The RNA-binding protein TIA-1 (T-cell intracellular antigen 1) functions as a posttranscriptional regulator of gene expression and aggregates to form stress granules following cellular damage. TIA-1 was previously shown to bind mRNAs encoding tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), but TIA-1 target mRNAs have not been systematically identified. Here, immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) of TIA-1-RNA complexes, followed by microarray-based identification and computational analysis of bound transcripts, was used to elucidate a common motif present among TIA-1 target mRNAs. The predicted TIA-1 motif was a U-rich, 30- to 37-nucleotide (nt)-long bipartite element forming loops of variable size and a bent stem. The TIA-1 motif was found in the TNF-alpha and COX-2 mRNAs and in 3,019 additional UniGene transcripts (approximately 3% of the UniGene database), localizing preferentially to the 3' untranslated region. The interactions between TIA-1 and target transcripts were validated by IP of endogenous mRNAs, followed by reverse transcription and PCR-mediated detection, and by pulldown of biotinylated RNAs, followed by Western blotting. Further studies using RNA interference revealed that TIA-1 repressed the translation of bound mRNAs. In summary, we report a signature motif present in mRNAs that associate with TIA-1 and provide support to the notion that TIA-1 represses the translation of target transcripts.",M1
16195233,"Inhibition of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine2c receptor function through heterodimerization: receptor dimers bind two molecules of ligand and one G-protein.Although dimerization appears to be a common property of G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), it remains unclear whether a GPCR dimer binds one or two molecules of ligand and whether ligand binding results in activation of one or two G-proteins when measured using functional assays in intact living cells. Previously, we demonstrated that serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine2C (5-HT2C) receptors form homodimers (Herrick-Davis, K., Grinde, E., and Mazurkiewicz, J. (2004) Biochemistry 43, 13963-13971). In the present study, an inactive 5-HT(2C) receptor was created and coexpressed with wild-type 5-HT2C receptors to determine whether dimerization regulates receptor function and to determine the ligand/dimer/G-protein stoichiometry in living cells. Mutagenesis of Ser138 to Arg (S138R) produced a 5-HT2C receptor incapable of binding ligand or stimulating inositol phosphate (<e>IP</e>) signaling. Confocal fluorescence imaging revealed plasma membrane expression of yellow fluorescent protein-tagged S138R receptors. Expression of wild-type 5-HT2C receptors in an S138R-expressing stable cell line had no effect on ligand binding to wild-type 5-HT2C receptors, but inhibited basal and 5-HT-stimulated IP signaling as well as constitutive and 5-HT-stimulated endocytosis of wild-type 5-HT2C receptors. M1 muscarinic receptor activation of IP production was normal in the S138R-expressing cells. Heterodimerization of S138R with wild-type 5-HT2C receptors was visualized in living cells using confocal fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET). FRET was dependent on the donor/acceptor ratio and independent of the receptor expression level. Therefore, inactive 5-HT2C receptors inhibit wild-type 5-HT2C receptor function by forming nonfunctional heterodimers expressed on the plasma membrane. These results are consistent with a model in which one GPCR dimer binds two molecules of ligand and one G-protein and indicate that dimerization is essential for 5-HT receptor function.",M1
16146684,"Clean Western blot signals from immunoprecipitated samples.We present a strategy that overcomes the high background arising during Western blotting (WB) detection of proteins obtained through immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>). Traditional HRP-conjugated secondary antibodies, which detect the denatured heavy and light antibody chains, produce high background that often mask the signals of interest on WBs. Here, we show that HRP-conjugated Protein A and Protein G, which detect almost exclusively intact antibody molecules, can be effectively used to obtain clean and specific WB signals of target proteins.",M1
16103111,"Involvement of the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex in the regulated endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation of inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors.Inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (<e>IP</e>(3)) receptors form tetrameric, IP(3)-gated channels in endoplasmic reticulum membranes that govern the release of Ca(2+) from this organelle. In response to activation of certain G protein-coupled receptors that persistently elevate IP(3) concentration, IP(3) receptors are ubiquitinated and degraded by the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway. IP(3) receptor ubiquitination is mediated by the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme, (mam)Ubc7, a component of the endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation pathway. However, the mechanism by which ubiquitinated IP(3) receptors are transferred to the proteasome is not known. Here, we examine this process and show in several mammalian cell types that the ATPase p97 associates with IP(3) receptors in response to hormonal stimuli that induce IP(3) receptor ubiquitination. To examine the functional relevance of the p97 interaction with IP(3) receptors, we stably and specifically reduced p97 protein levels by 62 +/- 3% in Rat-1 fibroblasts using RNA interference. In these cells, endothelin-1-induced IP(3) receptor degradation was markedly retarded and the accumulation of ubiquitinated IP(3) receptors was markedly enhanced. These effects were reversed by expression of exogenous p97. In addition, Ufd1 and Npl4, which complex with p97, also associated with IP(3) receptors upon hormonal stimulation. We conclude that the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex couples ubiquitinated IP(3) receptors to proteasomal degradation and, thus, plays a key role in IP(3) receptor processing. These data also establish that the p97-Ufd1-Npl4 complex mediates endoplasmic reticulum-associated degradation in mammalian cells.",M1
16043129,"Studies of humoral immunity to preprohypocretin in human leukocyte antigen DQB1*0602-positive narcoleptic subjects with cataplexy.BACKGROUND: Canine models for narcolepsy have mutations of the hypocretin receptor 2 gene, and preprohypocretin knockout murine lines exhibit narcoleptic-like behaviors. Human narcolepsy with cataplexy is associated with human leukocyte antigen DQB1*0602 and reduced hypocretin levels in cerebrospinal fluid, suggesting an autoimmune diathesis. We tested the hypothesis that DQB1*0602-positive narcoleptic subjects with cataplexy have immunoglobulin (Ig)G reactive to human preprohypocretin and its cleavage products. METHODS: Serum samples of 41 DQB1*0602-positive narcoleptic subjects with cataplexy and 55 control subjects were studied, as were 19 narcoleptic and 13 control samples of cerebrospinal fluid. We tested for IgG reactive to preprohypocretin and its major cleavage products (including hypocretin 1 and 2), using immunoprecipitation assays (<e>IP</e>), immunofluorescence microscopy (IF) of Chinese hamster ovarian cells expressing preprohypocretin, and Western blots. RESULTS: There was no evidence for IgG reactive to preprohypocretin or its cleavage products in CSF of subjects with narcolepsy as measured by IPs, Western blots, and IF. Although the IP with CSF and the C-terminal peptide showed significant differences by two methods of comparison, the control subjects had higher counts per minute than narcoleptic subjects, which was opposite to our hypothesis. CONCLUSIONS: The hypothesis that DQB1*0602-positive narcoleptic subjects with cataplexy have IgG reactive to preprohypocretin or its cleavage products was not supported.",M1
16007167,"Epithelial proliferation induces novel changes in APC expression.The role of wild-type adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) protein in native epithelia is poorly understood. The present study examined the relationships between wild-type APC and beta-catenin expression in an established model of hyperproliferation, transmissible murine colonic hyperplasia (TMCH). Distal colonic crypts isolated from normal or TMCH mice were: (i) fractionated into cytosolic and nuclear components for Western blotting and immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>), (ii) extracted for total RNA isolation for Northern blotting and, (iii) analysed immunohistochemically by confocal microscopy. Western blots performed sequentially through day 12 TMCH with N-terminal APC antibodies revealed increased abundance of approximately 312 kDa (p312) protein by day 6 (4.0 +/- 0.75-fold, n = 6) that peaked by day 9, before declining by day 12. A approximately 130 kDa (p130) band appeared at day 9 and increased by day 12 (1.5 +/- 0.11-fold, n = 6). A C-terminal antibody detected only p312. APC mRNA level did not change during TMCH and appearance of p130 was not due to alternative splicing. Co-IP with N-terminal anti-APC antibodies, revealed APC's association with beta-catenin both at day 6 and day 12. p130, but not p312, associated predominantly with beta-catenin at day 12 during co-IP with anti-beta-catenin. p130 also selectively accumulated in the nucleus, bound to nuclear beta-catenin at day 12. Immunocytochemistry with N-terminal antibodies revealed an increasing crypt base : surface gradient of APC within the apical pole/apical-lateral membranes at day 6. At day 12, intense apical/cytoplasmic and occasional nuclear staining along the longitudinal crypt axis was observed. Full-length APC increases during epithelial hyperproliferation and may represent a homoeostatic response. The dramatic increase in cytoplasmic and sporadic nuclear APC staining at day 12 with N-terminal antibodies may represent p130. The nuclear accumulation of p130 may be a novel mechanism regulating nuclear beta-catenin function during TMCH.",M1
16003322,"Redox-mediated upregulation of hepatocyte iNOS transcription requires coactivator PC4.BACKGROUND: Redox-mediated upregulation of transcription of hepatocyte inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) requires hepatocyte nuclear factor IV-alpha (HNF-4alpha). In this setting, PC4 is often isolated with HNF-4alpha in DNA-protein pull-down studies. Transcriptional coactivator PC4 facilitates activator-dependent transcription via interactions with basal transcriptional machinery that are independent of PC4-DNA binding. We hypothesized that PC4 is a necessary component of HNF-4alpha-regulated redox-sensitive hepatocyte iNOS transcription. METHODS: Murine CCL9.1 hepatocytes were stimulated with interleukin-1beta (IL-1beta; 1000 U/mL) in the presence and absence of peroxide (H(2)O(2); 50 nmol/L). Antisense and sense oligonucleotides to HNF-4alpha and PC4 were added selectively. Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-<e>IP</e>) studies determined the association between HNF-4alpha and PC4. Transient transfection was performed with the use of a luciferase reporter construct containing the murine iNOS promoter (1.8 kb). Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays determined in vivo binding of PC4 and HNF-4alpha to the iNOS promoter region. RESULTS: Ablation of either HNF-4alpha or PC4 blunted the peroxide-mediated increase in the activation of the iNOS promoter. In IL-1beta+H(2)O(2) only, co-IP studies demonstrated the presence of an HNF-4alpha-PC4 protein complex, and chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrated that this complex binds to the genomic iNOS promoter. CONCLUSIONS: Redox-mediated upregulation of hepatocyte iNOS transcription requires an HNF-4alpha-PC4 transcriptional complex.",M1
15998322,"Akt regulates the subcellular localization of the Rab27a-binding protein JFC1 by phosphorylation.Here, we show that the Rab27a-binding protein JFC1/Slp1 (synaptotagmin-like protein) is regulated by Akt-mediated phosphorylation. Using the phosphatase and tensin homolog-null LNCaP cells and the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor LY294002, we show that the phosphorylation of endogenous JFC1 is dependent on the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. JFC1 was phosphorylated in cells expressing a constitutively active Akt, confirming that it is an Akt substrate in vivo. Direct phosphorylation of JFC1 by Akt was confirmed in vitro. Using microcapillary high-performance liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry, we identified five Akt-phosphorylation sites in JFC1. By mutagenesis analysis and subsequent immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>), we established that Akt phosphorylates JFC1 at serine 241. JFC1 and Rab27a colocalize in the proximity of the plasma membrane in LNCaP cells. The interaction was confirmed by IP analysis and was abolished by the point mutation W83S in JFC1. Phosphorylation did not alter the ability of JFC1 to bind to Rab27a. Instead, phosphorylation by Akt dramatically decreased when JFC1 was bound to Rab27a. Finally, we show that as a consequence of in vivo phosphorylation, JFC1 dissociates from the membrane, promoting JFC1 redistribution to the cytosol. Our results suggest that Akt regulates JFC1/Slp1 function by phosphorylation and may have implications on Rab27a-containing vesicle secretion.",M1
15934946,"Protein tyrosine nitration in rat brain is associated with raft proteins, flotillin-1 and alpha-tubulin: effect of biological aging.Protein 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NY) immunoreactivity of rat brain homogenate was localized to a ca. 50 kDa protein band by western blot (WB) analysis. The nitrated proteins were localized to the raft fraction obtained by centrifugation of the homogenate in a sucrose density gradient, which contained specific raft markers such as flotillin-1 and caveolin-1. Purification of the nitrated raft proteins either by a combination of reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and sodium dodecyl sulphate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) or by immunoprecipitation (<e>IP</e>) with protein- and modification-specific antibodies coupled to WB and HPLC-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (ESI--MS/MS) analysis allowed us to identify two proteins modified by 3-NY: flotillin-1 and alpha-tubulin. Both alpha- and beta-tubulin were detected in the rat brain raft fraction as abundant proteins, which co-immunoprecipitate with flotillin-1 and caveolin-1. Importantly, some protein-protein interactions in rafts were disrupted in 3-NY-containing proteins, e.g. caveolin-1 was dissociated from a complex with flotillin-1 and alpha-tubulin. The analysis of age dependencies did not show any significant change in protein nitration and expression of flotillin-1 and alpha-tubulin, but a decrease in the brain caveolin-1 level for old (34 months) versus young (6 months) rats. The putative mechanism of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) activity regulation by the level of caveolin expression and raft protein-protein interactions is discussed.",M1
15908039,"Chronic morphine acts via a protein kinase Cgamma-G(beta)-adenylyl cyclase complex to augment phosphorylation of G(beta) and G(betagamma) stimulatory adenylyl cyclase signaling.Chronic morphine augments protein kinase C (PKC) phosphorylation of G(beta), which enhances the potency of G(betagamma) to stimulate adenylyl cyclase II (ACII) activity. The present study demonstrates an in vivo association between phosphorylated G(beta) and a specific PKC isoform, PKCgamma. We investigated the association of G(beta) and PKCgamma by assessing the ability of anti-PKCgamma antibodies to co-immunoprecipitate G(beta) from (32)P-radiolabeled Chinese Hamster Ovary cells stably transfected with a mu-opioid receptor (MOR-CHO). PKCgamma immunoprecipitate (<e>IP</e>) obtained from MOR-CHO membranes contained radiolabeled signals of approximately equals 33 and 36--38 kDa that were subsequently identified as G(beta)(s). Chronic morphine significantly increased ( approximately equals 75%) the magnitude of (32)P incorporated into G(beta) present in PKCgamma IP. This suggests that G(beta) is an in vivo substrate for PKCgamma, which mediates the chronic morphine-induced increment in G(beta) phosphorylation. In order to evaluate AC as a putative effector for phosphorylated G(betagamma), its presence in IP obtained using anti-AC antibodies was evaluated. Autoradiographic analyses of AC IP also revealed the presence of phosphorylated G(beta)(s), the magnitude of which was significantly enhanced ( approximately equals 60%) following chronic morphine treatment. This indicates that phosphorylated G(betagamma) associates and presumably interacts in vivo with AC, indicating that it is a target for the enhanced phosphorylated G(betagamma) that is generated following chronic morphine treatment. This would contribute to the previously observed shift from predominantly G(ialpha) inhibitory to G(betagamma) stimulatory AC signaling following chronic morphine. The PKCgamma-G(beta)-AC complex identified in this study provides an organizational framework for understanding the well-documented participation of PKCgamma in opioid tolerance-producing mechanisms.",M1
15894171,"Direct association of hepatopoietin with thioredoxin constitutes a redox signal transduction in activation of AP-1/NF-kappaB.It has been demonstrated that growth factors quiescin Q6 family was created by the fusion of the sulfhydryl oxidase fragment of the yeast essential for respiration and vegetative growth (ERV)1 prototype [an orthologue of hepatopoietin (HPO)] and thioredoxin (TRX)/disulfide isomerase domain during evolution. In this paper, our results demonstrated that two components of this composite protein, i.e., HPO and TRX, were involved in the same signal transduction and interacted physically in eukaryocyte. When HPO and TRX were cotransfected into COS7 cells, the activity of activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-kappaB was evidently enhanced compared with the transfection with HPO or TRX alone, at the same time, the phosphorylation of c-Jun was increased. They were colocalized in the cells. By Co-<e>IP</e> and GST pull-down experiments, we found that HPO could physically interact with TRX, which was also confirmed by yeast two-hybrid assay. By further investigation, we found both HPO and TRX were sensitive to cellular oxidative state. HPO dimer is in its natural state and could be reduced by dithiothreitol (DTT) in vitro and in vivo. Under the treatment of oxidants such as H(2)O(2) and diamide, the amount of HPO monomer was decreased significantly and assembled into dimer, and the free thiol in TRX was oxidized. HPO could transfer oxidizing equivalents to TRX via direct thiol-disulfide exchange in vitro, the redox state of TRX was also affected by HPO in vivo. Taken together, it was implicated that the oxidizing equivalents might flow from HPO to TRX and then to substrate protein by the dimerization of HPO, and its interaction with TRX finally activates the redox-sensitive transcription factor, suggesting a new redox signal pathway conducted by thiol-disulfide transformation in eukaryocytic cytoplasm.",M1
15714581,"CCL22-induced responses are powerfully enhanced by synergy inducing chemokines via CCR4: evidence for the involvement of first beta-strand of chemokine.In an attempt to clarify how cells integrate the signals provided by multiple chemokines expressed during inflammation, we have uncovered a novel mechanism regulating leukocyte trafficking. Our data indicate that the concomitant exposure to CCR4 agonists and CXCL10/<e>IP</e>-10 strongly enhances the chemotactic response of human T lymphocytes. This enhancement is synergistic rather than additive and occurs via CCR4 since it persists after CXCR3 blockade. Besides chemotaxis, other cellular responses are enhanced upon stimulation of CCR4-transfected cells with CCL22/MDC plus CXCL10. Several other chemokines in addition to CXCL10 were able to increase CCL22-mediated chemotaxis. The first beta-strand of the chemokine structure is highly and specifically implicated in this phenomenon, as established using synergy-inducing and non-synergy-inducing chimeric chemokines. As shown in situ for skin from atopic and allergic contact dermatitis patients, this organ becomes the ideal environment in which skin-homing CCR4(+) T lymphocytes can accumulate under the stimulus offered by CCR4 agonists, together with the synergistic chemokines that are concomitantly expressed. Overall, our results indicate that chemokine-induced synergism strengthens leukocyte recruitment towards tissues co-expressing several chemokines.",M1
15632133,"Molecular cloning of mouse type 2 and type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptors and identification of a novel type 2 receptor splice variant.We isolated cDNAs encoding type 2 and type 3 inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate (<e>IP</e>(3)) receptors (IP(3)R2 and IP(3)R3, respectively) from mouse lung and found a novel alternative splicing segment, SI(m2), at 176-208 of IP(3)R2. The long form (IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(+)) was dominant, but the short form (IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(-)) was detected in all tissues examined. IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(-) has neither IP(3) binding activity nor Ca(2+) releasing activity. In addition to its reticular distribution, IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(+) is present in the form of clusters in the endoplasmic reticulum of resting COS-7 cells, and after ATP or Ca(2+) ionophore stimulation, most of the IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(+) is in clusters. IP(3)R3 is localized uniformly on the endoplasmic reticulum of resting cells and forms clusters after ATP or Ca(2+) ionophore stimulation. IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(-) does not form clusters in either resting or stimulated cells. IP(3) binding-deficient site-directed mutants of IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(+) and IP(3)R3 fail to form clusters, indicating that IP(3) binding is involved in the cluster formation by these isoforms. Coexpression of IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(-) prevents stimulus-induced IP(3)R clustering, suggesting that IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(-) functions as a negative coordinator of stimulus-induced IP(3)R clustering. Expression of IP(3)R2 SI(m2)(-) in CHO-K1 cells significantly reduced ATP-induced Ca(2+) entry, but not Ca(2+) release, suggesting that the novel splice variant of IP(3)R2 specifically influences the dynamics of the sustained phase of Ca(2+) signals.",M1
15590649,"Periplakin interferes with G protein activation by the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor-1 by binding to the proximal segment of the receptor C-terminal tail.In mice genetic ablation of expression of either melanin-concentrating hormone or the melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor results in alterations in energy metabolism and a lean phenotype. There is thus great interest in the function and regulation of this receptor. Using the yeast two-hybrid system we identified an interaction of the actin- and intermediate filament-binding protein periplakin with the intracellular C-terminal tail of the melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor. Direct association of these proteins was verified in pull-down and coimmunoprecipitation experiments. Truncations and internal deletions delineated the site of interaction to a group of 11 amino acids proximal to transmembrane helix VII, which was distinct from the binding site for the melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor-interacting zinc finger protein. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated coexpression of periplakin with melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor in specific cells of the piriform cortex, amygdala, and other structures of the adult mouse brain. Coexpression of the melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor with periplakin in human embryonic kidney 293 cells did not prevent agonist-mediated internalization of the receptor but did interfere with binding of (35)S-labeled guanosine 5'-3-O-(thio)triphosphate ([(35)S]GTPgammaS) to the G protein Galpha(o1) and the elevation of [Ca(2+)](i). Coexpression of the receptor with the interacting zinc finger protein did not modulate receptor internalization or G protein activation. The interaction of periplakin with receptors was selective. Coexpression of periplakin with the <e>IP</e> prostanoid receptor did not result in coimmunoprecipitation nor interfere with agonist-mediated binding of [(35)S]GTPgammaS to the G protein Galpha(s). Periplakin is the first protein described to modify the capacity of the melanin-concentrating hormone-1 receptor to initiate signal transduction.",M1
15486046,"Mechanism of SHIP-mediated inhibition of insulin- and platelet-derived growth factor-stimulated mitogen-activated protein kinase activity in 3T3-L1 adipocytes.The Src homology 2-containing 5' inositolphosphatases (SHIP and SHIP2) dephosphorylate 3'-phosphorylated PtdIns on the 5' position, decreasing intracellular levels of PtdIns 3,4,5-P3. In the current study, we investigated the role of SHIP in insulin and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) signaling by expressing wild-type (WT) and catalytically inactive SHIPDeltaIP in 3T3-L1 adipocytes, utilizing adenoviral infection. Insulin and PDGF both stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP-WT and of SHIPDeltaIP, and tyrosine phosphorylation of SHIP-associated proteins increased after ligand stimulation. Tyrosine-phosphorylated PDGFR, IR, and insulin receptor substrate-1 all immunoprecipitated with SHIP. Expression of WT and DeltaIP mutant SHIP did not affect tyrosine phosphorylation of either the insulin or the PDGF receptor, or the expression of insulin receptor substrate-1 and Shc proteins. Both SHIP-WT and SHIPDeltaIP blocked insulin and PDGF-induced MAPK and MAPK kinase phosphorylation as well as, GTP-bound Ras activity, suggesting that the catalytic activity of SHIP is not necessary for these effects. SHIP associated with Shc upon ligand stimulation, indicating that the SHIP-Shc association is phosphorylation dependent. This association was primarily between the SHIP-SH2 domain and the phosphorylated tyrosine residues of Shc because no association was observed when the 3YF-Shc mutant was coexpressed with SHIP. The Shc*Grb2 association was not compromised by SHIP expression, despite complete inhibition of the Ras/MAPK pathway. Interestingly, son-of-sevenless (SOS) protein normally found in Grb2 complexes was markedly reduced in SHIP expressing cells, whereas the displaced SOS was recovered when the post-Grb2-<e>IP</e> supernatants were blotted with anti-SOS antibody. Thus, SHIP competes son-of-sevenless (SOS) away from Shc-Grb2. In summary, 1) SHIP-WT and SHIPDeltaIP expression inhibit insulin and PDGF stimulated Ras, MAPK kinase, and MAPK activities; 2) SHIP associates with tyrosine phosphorylated Shc, and the proline-rich sequences in SHIP associate with Grb2 and titrate out SOS to form Shc*Grb2*SHIP complexes; and 3) dissociation of SOS from the Shc*Grb2 complex inhibits Ras GTP loading, leading to decreased signaling through the MAPK pathway.",M1
15471868,"Dimerization of the human receptors for prostacyclin and thromboxane facilitates thromboxane receptor-mediated cAMP generation.Prostacyclin (PGI(2)) and thromboxane (TxA(2)) are biological opposites; PGI(2), a vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation, limits the deleterious actions of TxA(2), a vasoconstrictor and platelet activator. The molecular mechanisms involved in the counterregulation of PGI(2)/TxA(2) signaling are unclear. We examined the interaction of the receptors for PGI(2) (<e>IP</e>) and TxA(2) (TPalpha). IP-induced cAMP and TP-induced inositol phosphate generation were unaltered when the receptors were co-expressed in HEK 293 cells (IP/TPalpha-HEK). TP-cAMP generation, in response to TP agonists or a TP-dependent isoprostane, iPE(2)III, was evident in IP/TPalpha-HEK and in aortic smooth muscle cells, but not in cells expressing either receptor alone, or in IP-deficient aortic smooth muscle cells. Augmentation of TP-induced cAMP generation, with the IP agonist cicaprost, was ablated in IP-deficient cells and was independent of direct IP signaling. IP/TPalpha heterodimers were formed constitutively when the receptors were co-expressed, with no overt changes in ligand binding to the individual receptor sites. However, despite inefficient binding of iPE(2)III to either the IP or TPalpha, expressed alone or in combination, robust cAMP generation was evident in IP/TPalpha-HEK, suggesting the formation of an alternative receptor site. Thus, IP/TPalpha dimerization was coincident with TP-cAMP generation, promoting a  PGI(2)-like  cellular response to TP activation. This represents a previously unknown mechanism by which IP may limit the cellular effects of TP.",M1
15367581,"After double-strand break induction by UV-A, homologous recombination and nonhomologous end joining cooperate at the same DSB if both systems are available.After induction of DNA double-strand breaks (DSB) two repair systems, the error-prone 'nonhomologous end joining' (NHEJ) and the more accurate 'homologous recombination repair' (HRR) can compete for the same individual DSB site. In the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT, we have tested the spatial co-localisation and the temporal sequence of events. We used UV-A (365 nm) as a damaging agent, which can be applied in clearly defined doses and can lead to rare DSBs via propagation of clustered single-strand breaks (SSBs). DNA fragmentation and repair was measured by the Comet assay and persisting DSBs were quantified by the micronucleus assay. Direct DSB detection was performed by immunohistochemical labelling of gamma-H2AX, a phosphorylated histone that is assumed to form one foci per DSB. Intra- and inter-pathway interactions were quantified by co-localisation, FRET imaging and by co-immunoprecipitation (Co-<e>IP</e>) of XRCC4, DNA-PK and Ku70 as representatives of NHEJ, Rad51 and Rad52 for HRR and gamma-H2AX, Mre11 and Rad50 as representatives of both pathways. In G2 cells, where both systems are available, the temporal sequence after irradiation is: (1) gamma-H2AX (2) Mre11 (3) DNA-PK Rad51 (4) XRCC4. That is, the first two proteins involved in both pathways 'label' the damaged site and initiate repair, followed by the NHEJ, which is temporally overlapping with HRR activity. Taking all these observations together we suggest that a cell tries to repair DSBs with a combination of both HRR and NHEJ, if available.",M1
15286401,"Identification of a hypothetical membrane protein interactor of ribosomal phosphoprotein P0.The ribosomal phosphoprotein P0 of the human malarial parasite Plasmodium falciparum (PfP0) has been identified as a protective surface protein. In Drosophila, P0 protein functions in the nucleus. The ribosomal function of P0 is mediated at the stalk of the large ribosomal subunit at the GTPase centre, where the elongation factor eEF2 binds. The multiple roles of the P0 protein presumably occur through interactions with other proteins. To identify such interacting protein domains, a yeast two-hybrid screen was carried out. Out of a set of sixty clones isolated, twelve clones that interacted strongly with both PfP0 and the Saccharomyces cerevisiae P0 (ScP0) protein were analysed. These belonged to three broad classes: namely (i) ribosomal proteins; (ii) proteins involved in nucleotide binding; and (iii) hypothetical integral membrane proteins. One of the strongest interactors (clone 67B) mapped to the gene YFL034W which codes for a hypothetical integral membrane protein, and is conserved amongst several eukaryotic organisms. The insert of clone 67B was expressed as a recombinant protein, and immunoprecipitaion (<e>IP</e>) reaction with anti-P0 antibodies pulled down this protein along with PfP0 as well as ScP0 protein. Using deletion constructions, the domain of ScP0, which interacted with clone 67B, was mapped to 60-148 amino acids. It is envisaged that the surface localization of P0 protein may be mediated through interactions with putative YFL034W-like proteins in P. falciparum.",M1
15280385,"G2A is a proton-sensing G-protein-coupled receptor antagonized by lysophosphatidylcholine.G2A (from G2 accumulation) is a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) that regulates the cell cycle, proliferation, oncogenesis, and immunity. G2A shares significant homology with three GPCRs including ovarian cancer GPCR (OGR1/GPR68), GPR4, and T cell death-associated gene 8 (TDAG8). Lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) and sphingosylphosphorylcholine (SPC) were reported as ligands for G2A and GPR4 and for OGR1 (SPC only), and a glycosphingolipid psychosine was reported as ligand for TDAG8. As OGR1 and GPR4 were reported as proton-sensing GPCRs (Ludwig, M. G., Vanek, M., Guerini, D., Gasser, J. A., Jones, C. E., Junker, U., Hofstetter, H., Wolf, R. M., and Seuwen, K. (2003) Nature 425, 93-98), we evaluated the proton-sensing function of G2A. Transient expression of G2A caused significant activation of the zif 268 promoter and inositol phosphate (<e>IP</e>) accumulation at pH 7.6, and lowering extracellular pH augmented the activation only in G2A-expressing cells. LPC inhibited the pH-dependent activation of G2A in a dose-dependent manner in these assays. Thus, G2A is another proton-sensing GPCR, and LPC functions as an antagonist, not as an agonist, and regulates the proton-dependent activation of G2A.",M1
14978207,"Carbachol regulation of rabbit ileal brush border Na+-H+ exchanger 3 (NHE3) occurs through changes in NHE3 trafficking and complex formation and is Src dependent.The epithelial brush border membrane (BBM) Na(+)-H(+) exchanger 3 (NHE3) is the major transport protein responsible for ileal electroneutral Na(+) absorption. We have previously shown that ileal BBM NHE3 activity is rapidly inhibited by carbachol, an agonist that mimics cholinergic activation in digestion. In this study, we investigated the mechanisms involved in this NHE3 inhibition. Carbachol decreased the amount of ileal Na(+) absorptive cell BBM NHE3 within 10 min of exposure. Based on OptiPrep gradient centrifugation, carbachol increased the amount of NHE3 in early endosomes and decreased the amount of NHE3 in BBM, consistent with effects on NHE3 trafficking. The decrease in BBM NHE3 occurred in the detergent-soluble BBM fraction with no change in the amount of NHE3 in the BBM detergent-resistant membranes. The size of BBM NHE3 complexes increased in carbachol-exposed ileum, as studied with sucrose gradient centrifugation. The NHE3 complex size increased in the total BBM, but did not change in the detergent-soluble fraction. This suggests that carbachol treatment enhanced the association of proteins with NHE3 complexes specifically in the detergent-resistant fraction of ileal BBM. NHERF2, alpha-actinin-4 and protein kinase C were among those NHE3-associated proteins because they were more efficiently coimmunoprecipitated from total BBM after carbachol treatment. Moreover, Src was involved in the carbachol-mediated inhibition since: (1) c-Src was rapidly activated in the detergent-resistant membranes by carbachol; and (2) carbachol inhibition of ileal Na(+) absorption was completely abolished by the Src family inhibitor 4-amino-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine (PP2). Moreover, the carbachol-induced increase in the size of NHE3-containing complexes was reversed by PP2. These data demonstrate that regulation of NHE3 activity by carbachol can be achieved at several interrelated levels: (1) the subcellular level, at which NHE3 is rapidly endocytosed from BBM to endocytic vesicles upon treatment with carbachol; (2) multiple BBM pools, in which carbachol selectively decreases the amount of NHE3 in the BBM detergent-soluble fraction but not the detergent-resistant membrane; and (3) the molecular level, at which NHE3 complex-associated proteins can be changed upon carbachol treatment, with carbachol leading to larger BBM NHE3 complexes and increased co-<e>IP</e> of NHERF2 with alpha-actinin-4 and activated PKC. The study further describes NHE3 presence simultaneously in multiple dynamic BBM pools in which NHE3 distribution and associated proteins are altered as part of carbachol-induced and Src-mediated rapid signal transduction, which decreases the amount of BBM NHE3 and thus inhibits NHE3 activity.",M1
20499493,"Ophthalmological findings in series of incontinentia pigmenti patients from Serbia.INTRODUCTION: Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare complex X-linked genodermatosis in which skin changes are combined with anomalies of other organs. Mutations of the NEMO gene localized on chromosome Xq28 are responsible for IP. Clinical manifestations of IP according to evolution and prognosis can be considered as skin changes and dental, eye and central nervous system changes. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to investigate type and frequency of ocular features in Serbian population. METHODS: We investigated the total of 9 families with 22 subjects, 20 females and 2 males, at the Institute of Dermatovenerology, Clinical Centre of Serbia, in the period from 1989 to 2009. Our subjects were diagnosed clinically by a dermatologist and the diagnosis confirmed by cutaneous histopathology and ultrastructural analysis. The pedigrees, karyotype analyses, routine laboratory findings, additional specialized clinical examinations were done for all subjects. RESULTS: Among 22 IP patients from our study, different ophthalmological anomalies were observed in 16% of subjects. In female subjects, all of them with clinical characteristics of IP, we observed the following anomalies: retinal detachment, microphthalmia, cataract, strabismus and nystagmus. CONCLUSION: Compared to available literature data, our percentage of IP patients with anomalies was lower. It may be due to differences in examined populations or due to the fact that the patients in our study were firstly admitted to the Institute of Dermatology. Ophthalmological findings may be often considered as very severe anomalies in IP. It is very important to detect IP as early as possible, medically help and monitor these patients.",M2
20337104,"Two male patients with incontinentia pigmenti.BACKGROUND: Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare, complex, X-linked genodermatosis in which skin changes are combined with defects of other organs. It appears almost exclusively in females and is usually lethal in men. It is estimated that according to the available reported cases, there have been approximately 900-1,200 affected individuals, out of which 60 males. The aim of the study was to report two additional individual male cases with IP. CASE REPORTS: We discovered two male patients with IP according to standard IP diagnostic criteria. The diagnosis was made by a dermatologist and confirmed by cutaneous histopathology and ultrastructural analysis. The pedigrees, karyotype analyses and routine laboratory findings were made. Two male probands were the only ones with IP in their families, with no history of miscarriages. Both probands had normal karyotype. In one proband, acrocentric chromosomes of the group D had tendency of forming associations. Histopathological and ultrastructural skin analyses revealed findings typical for IP. CONCLUSION: The detection of each male case is very valuable because of their rarity. Application of the standard diagnostic criteria is necessary for comparison and epidemiological analysis. Monitoring such probands allows a better determination of how genetic transmission occurs, and is important because of the different degrees of severity of IP.",M2

Discovery of such lesions in an adult female with no family history of IP is essential for appropriate genetic counselling. OBJECTIVE: To describe and to validate the histological features of residual skin lesions in adult IP. METHODS: The analysis and comparison of skin biopsies of 26 women affected with molecularly confirmed IP. Results: Most biopsies showed slight atrophy and some scattered apoptotic cells in the epidermis, epidermal hypopigmentation and reduced melanocyte number. The dermis appeared thickened and homogeneous and revealed a complete absence of hair follicles (23/26) and sweat glands (22/26). There was no melanin incontinence or inflammatory cells, and the elastic network was normal. CONCLUSION: These features lead unequivocally to the diagnosis of a stage IV IP skin lesion. Consequently, histology is a major confirmatory criterion for diagnoses of these mild clinical forms of IP. It is therefore a useful tool in genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. Moreover, the observations described here may contribute to understanding the physiopathology of the late stages of IP.",M2
19603533,"Microdeletion/duplication at the Xq28 <e>IP</e> locus causes a de novo IKBKG/NEMO/IKKgamma exon4_10 deletion in families with Incontinentia Pigmenti.The Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP) locus contains the IKBKG/NEMO/IKKgamma gene and its truncated pseudogene copy, IKBKGP/deltaNEMO. The major genetic defect in IP is a heterozygous exon4_10 IKBKG deletion (IKBKGdel) caused by a recombination between two consecutive MER67B repeats. We analyzed 91 IP females carrying the IKBKGdel, 59 of whom carrying de novo mutations (65%). In eight parents, we found two recurrent nonpathological variants of IP locus, which were also present as rare polymorphism in control population: the IKBKGPdel, corresponding to the exon4_10 deletion in the pseudogene, and the MER67Bdup, that replicates the exon4_10 region downstream of the normal IKBKG gene. Using quantitative DNA analysis and microsatellite mapping, we established that both variants might promote the generation of the pathological IKBKGdel. Indeed, in family IP-516, the exon4_10 deletion was repositioned in the same allele from the pseudogene to the gene, whereas in family IP-688, the MER67Bdup generated the pathological IKBKGdel by recombination between two direct nonadjacent MER67Bs. Moreover, we found an instance of somatic recombination in a MER67Bdup variant, creating the IKBKGdel in an IP male. Our data suggest that the IP locus undergoes recombination producing recurrent variants that might be  at risk  of generating de novo IKBKGdel by NAHR during either meiotic or mitotic division.",M2

The eyes and central nervous system are the next most commonly affected systems. We aimed to describe the ophthalmological, neurological and radiodiagnostic findings of a patient with IP and bilateral retinal detachment. Clinical and laboratory findings of a four-month-old female baby who did not have light fixation and had neurological maturation retardation are presented. Characteristic skin lesions of IP were noted especially at the extremities, bilaterally. On neurological examination, motor and mental maturation were retarded and axial hypotonia was noted. Bilateral retinal detachment was the cause of absent eye fixation noted during ophthalmologic examination, and the detachments were also documented by ultrasonography and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Otologic examination was normal. Focal left frontal lobe atrophy, corpus callosum hypoplasia and prominence of right hemisphere were also noted on MRI. MR spectroscopy revealed negative lactate peak at the involved left frontal lobe. Bilateral retinal detachment is a probable finding in IP and patients with neurological symptoms should be investigated for associated sight-threatening ocular pathologies.",M2

We present a typical case of IP with subungual tumors (STIP) together with a short review on subungual tumors in IP. The diagnosis was achieved on the basis of the onset in adult life of STIP together with the other specific symptoms like ocular and dental abnormalities and achromic lesions of the legs. In the STIP lesions the presence and, in one of them, the expression, of HPV type 15 were detected. Topical therapy with retinoic acid cured the tumoral lesions. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report of HPV in STIP, opening a new scenario in the pathogenesis and the treatment of STIP.

It is transmitted as an X-linked dominant trait. The disorder is a consequence of mutations in the NEMO gene (Xq28) that completely abolish expression of the NF-kappaB essential modulator. Here we present a female infant of healthy nonconsanguinous, young parents with a clinically evident first phase of IP. PCR analysis of patient's peripheral blood lymphocytes DNA was done for detection of NEMO delta4-10 deletion. Skin changes present at birth appertain to first inflammatory stage. However, a pathohistological feature of the skin biopsy showed second phase of disease. Genetic testing of diseased child revealed delta4-10 in NEMO gene. However, the assumption that the female child has familial IP was rejected as PCR performed on the mother's leukocytes did not record the presence of the same mutation. Moreover, the existence of a healthy male infant of the same mother as well as the lack of any phenotypic signs of the disease in other family members additionally support that IP was not inherited, but it was a consequence of de novo NEMO gene mutation. In conclusion, here we describe a Croatian female with clinical IP phenotype having de novo genomic rearrangements in the NEMO gene.",M2
19068214,"Preliminary ocular histopathological observations on heterozygous NEMO-deficient mice.The majority of patients with incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) have a mutation in the nuclear factor-kappa-beta essential modulator (NEMO) gene, and mice with a targeted deletion of NEMO exhibit skin pathology remarkably similar to the human disease. This study characterizes the retinal vascular abnormalities of NEMO-deficient mice, and compares this phenotype to known features of human IP. Nineteen heterozygous NEMO-deficient female mice, ages ranging from post-natal day 8 (P-8) through 6.5 months of life, were studied. Eyes were sectioned and stained either whole or as retinal flat mounts after incubation for enzyme histochemical demonstration of ADPase, which labels the vasculature. With maturation, retinal arteriolar abnormalities became evident at 3 months of age. Global assessment of the retinal vasculature with ADPase staining showed increased vascular tortuosity. Microscopic examination of sections of ADPase-incubated retinas revealed arteriolar luminal narrowing due to endothelial cell hypertrophy and increased basement membrane deposition. Venous morphology was normal. This study characterized the histological retinal phenotype of heterozygous NEMO-deficient female mice. Most striking were retinal arteriolar abnormalities, including luminal narrowing, endothelial cell hypertrophy, and basement membrane thickening.

METHODS: A pedigree of IP was investigated. By using long PCR, the Delta4-10 deletion in NEMO gene was tested with specific primers In2/JF3R, and Delta4-10 deletion in pseudogene DeltaNEMO was investigated with primers Rev-2/JF3R. NEMO gene of 80 normal controls was also tested. RESULTS: The deletion of exons 4-10 in both NEMO gene and the pseudogene DeltaNEMO was detected in all the patients in the family, but was not found in the normal individuals in this IP family and 80 unrelated controls. CONCLUSION:The study showed that the family with IP, which showed anticipation, was caused by NEMODelta4-10 deletion in the NEMO gene. Long PCR analysis is proven to be an efficient tool for identification of NEMO rearrangements. It could provide useful information for the genetic counseling of the family involved.",M2
18818138,"Multiple clinical manifestations and diagnostic challenges of incontinentia pigmenti--12 years' experience in 1 medical center.BACKGROUND: Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare X-linked dominant disorder that involves ectodermal tissues of multiple systems. Previous reports are few in Taiwan. To contribute toward better understanding of IP, we describe and discuss the clinical features of cases that were diagnosed in a medical center during the past 12 years. METHODS: The medical records of all patients with IP between July 1995 and June 2007 were reviewed retrospectively. The demographics, physical findings, pathology reports, molecular study reports, eosinophil counts and outcome were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 4 patients, 3 female and 1 male neonate, who met the criteria for the diagnosis of IP were enrolled. Among these cases, 3 were not diagnosed with IP at initial presentation but were regarded to have infectious diseases. A definite family history of 3 consecutive generations was proved not only by clinical manifestations but also by molecular study in 1 patient. The patient also had retinal and vitreous body hemorrhage, which rapidly progressed to retinal detachment of the right eye in 2 months. Another patient presenting with stage III hyperpigmentation at birth had an extremely rare finding of left foot deformity. The male patient had unilateral and localized vesicular lesions over his left thigh. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis of IP is difficult in the neonatal period. Referral to experienced specialists is necessary. Multiple clinical characteristics of IP and rapid progression of ophthalmologic manifestations can be demonstrated through our study. Furthermore, 3 of the 4 cases in our study are the very first reports in Taiwan.",M2

The patient developed repetitive seizures at the age of 7 months when she was diagnosed with acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system that often occurs after vaccination or infection. The causative infectious agent in this patient seemed to be Mycoplasma pneumoniae because of the increased titer of its serum antibody and the detection of its DNA in the initial cerebrospinal fluid sample. This patient showed significant improvement on receiving immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids. This is the second case report presenting an IP patient susceptible to ADEM, and therefore, ADEM should be considered early in the differential diagnosis of acute neurological illness for IP patients.",M2
18650672,"Corneal abnormalities in incontinentia pigmenti: histopathological and confocal correlations.PURPOSE: To describe the clinical presentation and histopathologic and confocal correlations in a case of incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>)-associated whorllike corneal epitheliopathy. METHODS: We describe the case report of a 22-year-old woman with IP and bilateral whorllike corneal epitheliopathy, with symptomatic dry eye complaints. Slit-lamp and confocal microscopic imaging confirmed that the pathology was restricted entirely within the epithelial layer. The cornea was debrided with the hopes of alleviating symptomatic eye complaints. The excised tissue was analyzed by standard light microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. RESULTS: In vivo confocal microscopic imaging (ConfoScan 3; Nidek, Fremont, CA) of both eyes showed the presence of multiple bright, round objects approximately 7-20 microm in diameter and located entirely within the epithelial layer. Hematoxylin-eosin-stained sections of the debrided tissue showed a mild disorganization of the overall epithelial architecture. Transmission electron microscopy noted various degrees of degenerating nuclei. The corneal epithelial defect of the patient's left eye healed by the fourth postoperative day. The new epithelium appeared normal, but at the 1-month examination, there was recurrence. CONCLUSIONS: Histomorphologic evaluation of the surgical specimen showed abnormal changes restricted to the epithelium in our patient. The observed changes are suggestive of a primary abnormality of cell maturation, which results in degeneration, and apoptosis as the epithelial cells migrate upward. The rapid recurrence of keratopathy clearly indicates that supportive treatment of blurred vision and secondary superficial punctate keratopathy with artificial tears, punctal plugs, and bandage contact lens are more likely to be beneficial.",M2

18350553,"Alterations of the IKBKG locus and diseases: an update and a report of 13 novel mutations.Mutations in the inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B-cells, kinase gamma (IKBKG), also called nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kB) essential modulator (NEMO), gene are the most common single cause of incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) in females and anhydrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID) in males. The IKBKG gene, located in the Xq28 chromosomal region, encodes for the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor of kappaB (IkB) kinase (IKK) complex required for the activation of the NF-kB pathway. Therefore, the remarkably heterogeneous and often severe clinical presentation reported in IP is due to the pleiotropic role of this signaling transcription pathway. A recurrent exon 4_10 genomic rearrangement in the IKBKG gene accounts for 60 to 80% of IP-causing mutations. Besides the IKBKG rearrangement found in IP females (which is lethal in males), a total of 69 different small mutations (missense, frameshift, nonsense, and splice-site mutations) have been reported, including 13 novel ones in this work. The updated distribution of all the IP- and EDA-ID-causing mutations along the IKBKG gene highlights a secondary hotspot mutation in exon 10, which contains only 11% of the protein. Furthermore, familial inheritance analysis revealed an unexpectedly high incidence of sporadic cases (&gt;65%). The sum of the observations can aid both in determining the molecular basis of IP and EDA-ID allelic diseases, and in genetic counseling in affected families.",M2

The same gene is mutated in incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>), and mutations that do not completely abolish NF-kappaB activity allow survival of male fetuses. We present a case of a 1-year-old boy with a history of EDA-ID who was evaluated for an eruption that intermittently affected his scalp, upper back, cheeks, legs, and arms. A biopsy specimen taken from the back showed the presence of compact dyskeratotic cells with fragmented nuclei and numerous apoptotic keratinocytes scattered throughout the spinous and granular layer.

Wide spectrum of clinical expression consists of skin hyperpigmented lines and swirling patterns, dysplastic teeth and nails, and in 30% central nervous system abnormalities including seizures, microcephaly and intellectual disability (10% of cases). In 80% of IP cases, the disease is caused by a large-scale deletion of exons 4 to 10 of the NEMO gene. Three cases of variable expression of Incontinentia Pigmenti are presented. In a one-year-old girl, her mother and grandmother molecular analysis revealed the same typical deletion of the NEMO gene. In the proband, characteristic skin lesions were detected located over the trunk and lower limbs. Characteristic evolution of the changes was observed. In the mother, expression of the disease was much milder, whereas in the grandmother lesions were restricted to the fingernails. Clinical characteristics and pedigree data are described.",M2

17950640,"Extensive cerebral infarction in the newborn due to incontinentia pigmenti.INTRODUCTION: Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare X-linked dominant neuroectodermal multisystem disorder characterized by skin lesions following Blaschko lines. In almost all patients the skin is involved and in 30-50% the central nervous system (CNS) is. Vascular occlusive phenomena probably play a role in CNS involvement. Whether these vascular changes are based on macro- or microvascular disease in the neonatal presentation is not fully understood. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We describe two patients with IP with neonatal seizures related to cerebral infarction. In comparison, we reviewed reports of ischaemic cerebrovascular injury in neonatal IP. RESULTS: No descriptions of documented large artery occlusion in neonatal IP was found in the literature. One of our patients showed striatal arteriopathy, never described before in IP. Extensive injury in one of our cases was heterogeneous, mixing healthy with diseased areas within large arterial fields. CONCLUSIONS: We postulate that neonatal cerebral infarction in IP is a macrovascular disorder of medium sized or small arteries. The pattern of arterial involvement might follow hypothetical brain Blaschko lines. The extent of cerebral involvement probably results from genetic mosaicism in which Lyonisation leads to endothelial apoptosis, similar to the process in the skin.",M2

METHODS: Twelve pediatric probands with three of their mothers were enrolled in this study. Physical examinations were undertaken for all patients and questionnaires requesting additional medical and developmental data were sent to the patients' families. The deletion of exon 4-10 and all 10 exons of NEMO gene were analyzed in these cases. Skin biopsy was performed in one case. RESULTS: All 15 patients had skin pigmentation abnormality and were diagnosed according to classic skin lesions. The prevalence of the dental, neurologic system, hair abnormality, and definite family history were 80.0%, 41.67%, 58.33%, and 25.0%, respectively. Histopathological examination was consistent with the diagnosis of IP with ectodermal dysplasia. In NEMO gene, deletion of exons 4-10 were noted in three cases and two of their mothers. A deletion of 19545 T in exon 6 was noted in one case and her mother. A 21690 T to C mutation in intron 8 of NEMO were found in another one case and her mother. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that skin lesion are the most prominent findings in clinics and the traditional diagnosis of IP is based on classic melanin pigmentation. Nucleotide deletion of exons 4-10 and single nucleotide mutation/polymorphism were found in these patients, which might account for etiopathogenesis of IP.",M2
17569396,"Incontinentia pigmenti (Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome): a systemic disorder.Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare inherited multisystem disorder characterized by a distinctive swirling pattern of the skin; defects of teeth, hair, and nails; and ophthalmic, central nervous system, and musculoskeletal abnormalities. It progresses through several well-defined stages. IP is transmitted as a dominant X-linked trait with variable expressivity, but many--if not most--cases are sporadic. IP has been shown to result from mutations in the NEMO gene that completely abolish expression of NF-kappaB essential modulator. The diagnosis of IP typically is made based on characteristic clinical findings. Molecular analysis of the NEMO gene is now possible, as is analysis of skewed X-chromosome inactivation, which can further reduce diagnostic confusion. A number of disorders, including hypomelanosis of Ito, should be considered in the differential diagnosis. The considerations vary according to the stage of IP. Careful head-to-toe clinical evaluation is critical in the evaluation of a child with suspected IP given the frequent multisystem involvement. A multidisciplinary approach including dermatology, ophthalmology, neurology, and dental consults is typically warranted. The skin manifestations of IP do not require specific treatment other than reassurance; spontaneous resolution of the lesions usually occurs.",M2

Deletion of exons 4 to 10 of the nuclear factor kappaB essential modulator (NEMO) gene accounts for the majority of new mutations. The disease is more commonly found among Caucasians. We studied a case of an IP patient in Japan, and the genomic rearrangements. METHODS: An 11-month-old female infant exhibited the skin lesions of IP. Ocular findings were total retinal detachment with a retrolental fibrovascular mass in the right eye, and patchy retinal avascular zones and neovascularization in the left eye. The genomic rearrangement of NEMO was investigated by a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based diagnostic test. A skewed X-inactivation assay was also performed using the human androgen receptor gene as a genetic marker. RESULTS: Deletion of exons 4 to 10 in NEMO was detected in the proband and in other female members of her family. A complete skewing of the X-inactivation pattern causing IP was observed, indicating cells having no protection against apoptosis in response to tumor necrosis factor as the pathogenicity of the disease.

One such example is incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>), a rare, complex, X-linked genodermatosis. Clinical manifestations of IP according to evolution and prognosis can be considered as skin, as well as dental, eye, and central nervous system, changes. We have investigated a total of nine families with 25 subjects, 23 females and 2 males. In 12 female and 2 male subjects, all of them with clinical characteristics of IP, we observed the following abnormalities: teeth-shape anomalies (coni- or peg-like teeth), the presence of numerous cariotic teeth, early dental loss, delayed eruption, partial anodontia, and gothic palate. To our knowledge, this is the first time that the presence of gothic palate in patients with IP has been documented.

16844507,"Incontinentia pigmenti in male patients.BACKGROUND: Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare X-linked dominant genodermatosis that is typified by distinctive cutaneous findings and often by abnormalities of teeth, hair, nails, eyes, musculoskeletal system, and central nervous system. The gene that is mutated in patients with IP has been mapped to Xq28 and encodes the NF-kappaB essential modulator, NEMO. Female patients with IP show functional mosaicism and cutaneous manifestations follow Blaschko's lines of ectodermal embryologic development. The condition is generally considered to be lethal in utero in male fetuses, suggesting that having some normal gene expression is critical for survival. OBSERVATIONS: We observed 9 boys with IP. All had normal karotypes and no apparent family history of IP. In 8 of these 9 patients, lesions were localized to one extremity at presentation. The diagnosis was confirmed by histopathologic examination that showed eosinophils within intraepidermal, multiloculated vesicles. One of the boys later developed dental and neurologic abnormalities. LIMITATIONS: The case series was small and the workup for these patients from different sites was not uniform. CONCLUSIONS: Male individuals may show cutaneous and noncutaneous features of IP in a limited distribution that allows survival. Postzygotic mutation/somatic mosaicism is the likely mechanism.

Five patients show cutaneous and neurological lesions and seven only show cutaneous lesions without neurologic or/ and ophthalmologic abnormalities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five mothers and seven daughters from four families were studied and followed between 1965 and 2004. The studies consisted of detailed clinical history since birth, physical examination, family history, EEG recordings and MRI studies. In some patients, at least three MRI studies were performed during our follow-up. All patients were followed-up since their first visit until 2004. Including four patients since birth or early infancy. Skin biopsies were obtained from two infants for histological study. RESULTS: MRI studies revealed brain abnormalities in five girls who had neurologic signs associated with the cutaneous lesions of IP. Brain lesions were bilateral in four and unilateral in one. Cerebellar changes were observed only in one case who also showed severe cerebral lesions. The lesions involved cortex, subcortical and deep white matter, ependymal and subependymal zones of one or both cerebral hemispheres. Lesions usually were localized and extended radially to involve all the cerebral parenchyma between ependyma and cortex. Affected areas did not correspond to territories vascularized by any determined artery. The corpus callosum showed generalized or localized atrophy in the five patients who had cerebral hemispheric lesions. Although parenchymal changes were seen in both the T1 and T2 weighted images, these were most evident in the latter. Parenchymal abnormalities were most severe in patients with neonatal severe cutaneous lesions, especially if these were located in the scalp. Cerebral lesions were present from birth or the first months of life and changed little thereafter. The acute appearance and distribution of cerebral lesions always during the neonatal period, associated with scalp lesions in stage 1, suggest an acute inflammatory origin of unknown etiology and of nonprogressive course. Ocular lesions were directly related with cerebral abnormalities. Patients who only had cutaneous lesions without neurologic symptoms showed no MRI abnormalities. CONCLUSIONS: Neuroimaging studies reveals brain lesions only in patients with neurologic disease in this serie. The brain lesions may involve one or both cerebral hemispheres, corpus callosum, and cerebellum. The brain lesions correlate with the neonatal scalp lesions in stage 1, suggests an inflammatory process of unknown etiology and non-progressive course. The appearance and distribution of the cerebral lesions do not follow the territories vascularized by specific arteries. Ocular lesions are observed only in patients with severe cerebral changes. Early onset of cerebral lesions may be the most reasonable explanation for the progressive microcephaly within the first year of life in IP.",M2

The authors report a clinicopathologic correlation of IP and illustrate the retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) alterations that may be useful in establishing the diagnosis. METHODS: A 30-month-old reportedly healthy girl developed strabismus and was discovered to have total retinal detachment in the left eye. Intraocular calcification was found on ultrasonography and computed tomography, suggestive of retinoblastoma. RESULTS: Ophthalmoscopy of the right eye revealed sector distribution of approximately 70 elongated, linear hypopigmented lesions of the RPE located in the peripheral superotemporal, inferotemporal, and superonasal quadrants and measuring 300 microm or less in basal dimension. The left eye had a total retinal detachment, vitreous traction, perivascular exudation, and iris neovascularization. Despite the lack of medical history in this patient, skin examination revealed classic cutaneous findings of IP The enucleated left globe displayed tractional retinal detachment with vitreoretinal neovascularization and nonspecific RPE papillary proliferation. Scattered minor foci of intraretinal calcification were observed. There was no sign of retinoblastoma. CONCLUSIONS: IP can closely simulate retinoblastoma with retinal detachment and minor intraocular calcification. In this case, the classic cutaneous manifestations combined with the fine linear hypopigmented RPE foci were important in suggesting the diagnosis of IP.",M2
16399796,"Skin lesion development in a mouse model of incontinentia pigmenti is triggered by NEMO deficiency in epidermal keratinocytes and requires TNF signaling.NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), the regulatory subunit of the IkappaB kinase, is essential for NF-kappaB activation. Mutations disrupting the X-linked NEMO gene cause incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>), a human genetic disease characterized by male embryonic lethality and by a complex pathology affecting primarily the skin in heterozygous females. The cellular and molecular mechanisms leading to skin lesion pathogenesis in IP patients remain elusive. Here we used epidermis-specific deletion of NEMO in mice to investigate the mechanisms causing the skin pathology in IP. NEMO deletion completely inhibited NF-kappaB activation and sensitized keratinocytes to tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-induced death but did not affect epidermal development. Keratinocyte-restricted NEMO deletion, either constitutive or induced in adult skin, caused inflammatory skin lesions, identifying the NEMO-deficient keratinocyte as the initiating cell type that triggers the skin pathology in IP. Furthermore, genetic ablation of tumor necrosis factor receptor 1 (TNFRI) rescued the skin phenotype demonstrating that TNF signaling is essential for skin lesion pathogenesis in IP. These results identify the NEMO-deficient keratinocyte as a potent initiator of skin inflammation and provide novel insights into the mechanism leading to the pathogenesis of IP.",M2
16228229,"A new mutation in exon 7 of NEMO gene: late skewed X-chromosome inactivation in an incontinentia pigmenti female patient with immunodeficiency.Incontinentia pigmenti is an X-linked genodermatosis, lethal in males. Affected females survive because of X-chromosome dizygosity and negative selection of cells carrying the mutant X-chromosome, and for this reason the skewed X inactivation pattern is often used to confirm the diagnosis. The most frequent mutation is a deletion of part of the NEMO gene (NEMODelta4-10), although other mutations have been reported. Mutations of NEMO which do not abolish NF-kappaB activity totally permit male survival, causing an allelic variant of <e>IP</e> called hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency (HED-ID). We present a non-classical IP female patient who also suffered transient immunodeficiency because of a late and progressive selection against peripheral blood cells carrying an active mutated X-chromosome. This finding suggests that in the absence of known mutation the X-inactivation studies used in genetic counselling can induce mistakes with some female patients. At the age of 3 years and 6 months, all immunodeficiency signs disappeared, and the X-chromosome inactivation pattern was completely skewed. The low T cell proliferation and CD40L expression corroborate the important role of NEMO/ NF-kappaB pathway in T cell homeostasis. The decreased NEMO protein amount and the impaired IkBalpha degradation suggest that this new mutation, NM_003639: c.1049dupA, causes RNA or protein instability. To our knowledge, this is the first time that selection against the mutated X-chromosome in X-linked disease has been documented in vivo.",M2

This important clinical feature of IP in secondary cases has previously been under-represented in studies that often involved only paediatric probands.

15833158,"[NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion of NEMO gene in Chinese incontinentia pigmenti cases]OBJECTIVE: Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare X-linked dominant disorder that affects ectodermal tissues. In IP, mutations in NEMO lead to the complete loss of NF-kB activation creating a susceptibility to cellular apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha. Recently, a second nonfunctional copy of the gene, Delta NEMO was identified, opposite in direction to NEMO. Almost 90% of IP whose gene mutation type had been recognized have a recurrent genomic deletion of exons 4-10 of the NEMO (IKK gamma) gene, called NEMO Delta 4-10, which is necessary to activate the NF-kB pathway. Therefore, PCR-based detection of the NEMO deletion is a diagnostic measurement for IP. This study sought to analyze the NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in NEMO gene of Chinese IP cases. METHODS: Seven IP cases and part of their families totally 15 persons were enrolled in this study. The 7 IP cases were aged 41 days to 8 years. Among them 1 was male and 6 were female. Four cases had family history of IP, the other 3 were sporadic cases. Fifty healthy children without any congenital diseases were taken as normal control group. According to the gene characteristics of IP, by PCR measurement NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in NEMO gene was tested with specific primers In2/JF3R, and NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in pseudogene Delta NEMO was checked out by primers Rev-2/JF3R. RESULTS: Five out of the 7 tested cases (case 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) showed NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in NEMO gene. The mothers of case 1 and case 6, 1a and 6a, also suffered from this disease, and their results were just the same as their daughters. For pseudogene Delta NEMO only case 2 and case 4 were proved having NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion, while other cases and families had negative results. For normal control group, NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion was not found either in NEMO gene or in their pseudogene Delta NEMO. CONCLUSION: Incontinentia pigmenti in most cases were caused by NEMO Delta 4-10 deletion in NEMO gene.",M2
15690773,"[Dental anomalies associated with incontinentia pigmenti or Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome]We report dental anomalies related to the Bloch- Sulzberger Syndrome better known as Incontinentia Pigmenti (<e>IP</e>). IP is an X related hereditary disease that occurs for about 95% of all patients in females and is lethal for the male foetus. Because of severe skin lesions in the neonatal period the disease is more known by dermatologists than dentists. Beside the skin lesions other associated deficiencies can be present like: ocular injuries, anomalies of hair and nails, defects of the central nervous system, malformations of the extremities and anomalies of the teeth. We report 8 female patients of different ages, out of 5 families. All were diagnosed with IP after DNA examination. Dental manifestations related to IP are: delayed eruption, oligodontia, agenesis, peg-shaped or malformed teeth, supernumerary teeth and supplementary cusps. IP is under diagnosed if the symptoms are limited to agenesis of only a few teeth and inconspicuous skin lesions. Dentists are ideally placed to identify individuals with IP and should refer patients with a presumption of IP to proper medical specialists.",M2

Largely 80% of cases are accounted for by a large-scale deletion encompassing exons 4 to 10 of the NEMO gene. The aim of this work was to facilitate prenatal diagnosis of IP by devising a novel test for detection of the prevalent NEMO deletion. METHODS: We devised a sensitive and reproducible multiplex PCR test enabling simultaneous amplification of the deleted and wild-type NEMO genes in IP female individuals. RESULTS: Combination of this DNA test, with Xq28 linkage analysis and X-inactivation pattern study enabled us to offer an IP prenatal diagnosis in 15 of the 16 couples at a 50% risk to have an affected offspring.

The female-to-male ratio ranges from 20 to 37 : 1. In affected females IP causes highly variable abnormalities of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, eyes, and central nervous system (CNS). Cardiovascular anomalies, cerebral infarction, and immune dysfunction are rare complications of IP. The pathogenesis of cerebral changes in IP remains elusive. We report the case of two IP-affected sisters who presented in each case with neonatal seizures on the fifth day of life. Via cranial magnetic resonance tomographic imaging (MRI) different types of lesions in both hemispheres were demonstrable in both patients. To date the pathogenetic mechanisms for the cerebral lesions are not fully understood. However, multiple microscopic infarcts could serve as a possible explanation. The clinical course and the neurological development of the older child are favorable and so far the younger sibling appears to be developing normally, which is uncommon for patients with early onset of neurological symptoms. Symptomatic seizures in IP are an important differential diagnosis in benign non-familial and familial neonatal seizures.",M2

DESIGN: Retrospective study of 47 children referred to the Department of Pediatric Dermatology with a diagnosis of IP between 1986 and 1999. SETTING: The private or institutional practice of participating dermatologists and pediatricians. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation of IP clinical diagnosis using the Landy and Donnai criteria. RESULTS: Because hyperpigmentation following the Blaschko lines may be observed in several pigmented disorders, 7 patients were found misdiagnosed. During the neonatal period, erythema, vesicles, and hyperkeratotic le sions were rarely absent in the patients with IP. Ocular and neurological abnormalities were frequent (20% and 30%, respectively) but rarely severe (8% and 7.5%, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Clinical diagnosis is the first main step for a correct phenotype/genotype correlation, which remains indispensable to better understand the pathological mechanisms of IP and develop new therapies. In doubtful cases, molecular analysis is helpful but characteristic histological features must be added as major criteria for IP diagnosis. Multidisciplinary follow-up is needed, particularly during the first year of life, to detect possible ophthalmologic and neurological complications.

12588226,"Late recurrence of inflammatory first-stage lesions in incontinentia pigmenti: an unusual phenomenon and a fascinating pathologic mechanism.BACKGROUND: Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is an X-linked genodermatosis that is manifested by neonatal inflammatory vesicles localized along the lines of Blaschko. These lesions usually clear spontaneously within a few months, leaving hyperpigmentation. Ophthalmologic and neurologic symptoms can be associated with IP. Late recurrences of the first-stage inflammatory lesions after the initial rash are uncommon and have been reported infrequently. The mechanism involved in this phenomenon is unclear. However, the recent identification of NEMO/IKKgamma as the gene responsible for IP sheds new light on its pathophysiologic origins. OBSERVATIONS: We report 5 cases of children who experienced episodes of late reactivation of IP. In all cases, the recurrences occurred on the previously hyperpigmented streaks several months or years after resolution of the initial eruptions. In most cases, the recurrences were preceded by an infectious episode. CONCLUSIONS: These IP recurrences suggest that mutated cells can persist a long time in the epidermis. We theorize that infections trigger the reactivations. The NEMO/IKKgamma gene encodes a protein essential in nuclear factor kappaB activation, which is required for resistance to tumor necrosis factor alpha-induced apoptosis. We discuss the role of a proinflammatory cytokine such as tumor necrosis factor alpha as a triggering factor for the reactivation.",M2

CASE REPORT: Our patient, a female, started with clonic seizures in the right half of the body at the age of three days. Method. IP, or Bloch Sulzberger syndrome, is a genetic multisystemic neuroectodermic disorder. It is a disease of low incidence (1% of all neuroectodermic disorders) which is transmitted by means of a pattern of dominant inheritance linked to X, and is lethal in males, except in rare cases of somatic mosaicism and Klinefelter. In the family forms the gene is located in the p11 (IP 1) and q28 (IP 2) regions of the X chromosome. It has recently been discovered that the cause lies in a mutation of a gene called NEMO (IKK gamma). Together with Bourneville s tuberous sclerosis it is the only neurocutaneous syndrome that can begin with neonatal convulsions. The convulsions start on the second or third day of life and are often limited to a single side of the body, although it can also appear as encephalitis. The origin of the convulsions has been linked with recurring encephalomyelitis, or with an alteration of the neuronal migration. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of the early convulsions in our patient, which we put down to a left perisylvian focal dysgenesia (unilateral opercular syndrome) observed in the computerised axial tomography (CAT scan), has not been reported up to the present associated with IP.",M2
12497627,"Two cases of misinterpretation of molecular results in incontinentia pigmenti, and a PCR-based method to discriminate NEMO/IKKgamma dene deletion.Familial incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare X-linked dominant disorder that affects ectodermal tissues. Over 90% of IP carrier females have a recurrent genomic deletion of exons 4-10 of the NEMO (IKBKG-IKKgamma) gene, which encodes a regulatory component of the IkB kinase complex, required to activate the NF-kB pathway. In IP, mutations in NEMOlead to the complete loss of NF-kB activation creating a susceptibility to cellular apoptosis in response to TNF-alpha. This condition is lethal for males during embryogenesis while females, who are mosaic as a result of X-inactivation, can survive. Recently, a second nonfunctional copy of the gene, DeltaNEMO, was identified, opposite in direction to NEMO in a 35.5-kb duplicated sequence tract. PCR-based detection of the NEMO deletion is diagnostic for IP disease. However, we present instances in which ex 4-10 DeltaNEMO pseudogene deletion occurs in unaffected parents of two females with clinically characteristic IP. These were missed by the currently standard PCR-based method, but can be easily discriminated by a new PCR-based test reported here that permits unambiguous molecular diagnosis and proper familial genetic counseling for IP.",M2
12351572,"The NF-kappaB signalling pathway in human diseases: from incontinentia pigmenti to ectodermal dysplasias and immune-deficiency syndromes.The transcription factor NF-kappaB regulates the expression of numerous genes controlling the immune and stress responses, inflammatory reaction, cell adhesion, and protection against apoptosis. Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is the first genetic disorder to be ascribed to NF-kappaB dysfunction. IP is an X-linked dominant genodermatosis antenatally lethal in males. A complex rearrangement of the NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator) gene accounts for 85% of IP patients, and results in undetectable NEMO protein and absent NF-kappaB activation. On the other hand, hypohidrotic/anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED/EDA) has been ascribed to at least three genes also involved in NF-kappaB activation: ectodysplasin (EDA1), EDA-receptor (EDAR) and EDAR-associated death domain (EDARADD). During hair follicle morphogenesis, EDAR is activated by ectodysplasin, and uses EDARADD as an adapter to build a signal transducing complex that leads to NF-kappaB activation. Hence, several forms of HED/EDA also result from impaired activation of the NF-kappaB cascade. Finally, hypomorphic NEMO mutations have been found to cause anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immunodeficiency (EDA-ID), whilst stop codon mutations cause a more severe phenotype associating EDA-ID with osteopetrosis and lymphoedema (OL-EDA-ID). The immunological and infectious features observed in patients result from impaired NF-kappaB signalling, including cellular response to LPS, IL-1beta, IL-18, TNF-alpha, Tlr2 and CD40 ligand. Consistently, mouse knockout models have shown the essential role of NF-kappaB in the immune, inflammatory and apoptotic responses. Unravelling the molecular bases of other forms of EDA not associated with mutations in NEMO will possibly implicate other components of the NF-kappaB signalling pathway.",M2
12220010,"Management of incontinentia pigmenti: a case of monolateral preretinal fibrovascular proliferations adjacent to snail-track degeneration areas.PURPOSE: To report a case of monolateral preretinal fibrovascularproliferations in a young adult woman, who had suffered from incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) during her first month of life. METHODS: Case report. RESULTS: Circumscribed preretinal fibrovascular proliferations, adjacent to a mid-peripheral area of snail track degeneration, were occasionally diagnosed in the left eye of an asymptomatic 18-year-old white female. Careful ocular examination did not reveal any cause of the monolateral vascular abnormalities observed in the posterior segment. A detailed medical history brought to light that the patient has suffered infantile IP, like four other females in her family. The patient did not present any evident malformation of teeth, nails, skeleton or hair. A cytogenetic linkage study documented a chromosomal aberration in the Xq28 band, which confirmed the diagnosis of familial IP (type 2). The fluorescein angiography findings clearly illustrated the minimal retinal involvement in the course of IP. CONCLUSIONS: This case shows that a wide range of etiologies must be considered in patients presenting monolateral preretinal fibrovascular proliferations. To correctly manage these uncommon, inherited or acquired, retinal diseases it is better to do a mid-term follow-up, rather than operate immediately, and this enabled us to observe the natural course of the lesion, while awaiting a definitive diagnosis.",M2
12042591,"Osteopetrosis, lymphedema, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and immunodeficiency in a boy and incontinentia pigmenti in his mother.A child with X-linked osteopetrosis, lymphedema, anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, and immunodeficiency (OL-EDA-ID) was recently reported. We report the clinical features of a second boy with this novel syndrome and his mother, who presented with signs of incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>). The child had mild osteopetrosis without neurosensory complications, unilateral lymphedema of the left leg, and characteristic features of anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with sparse hair, facial dysmorphy, delayed eruption of teeth, and sweat gland abnormalities. He died at 18 months of severe immunodeficiency with multiple infections caused by Gram-negative (Salmonella enteritidis) and Gram-positive (Streptococcus pneumoniae) bacteria, nontuberculous mycobacteria (Mycobacterium kansasii), and fungi (Pneumocystis carinii). His 30-year-old mother's medical history, together with residual cutaneous lesions, was highly suggestive of IP without neurologic impairment. In this patient with OL-EDA-ID, we detected the same NF-kappaB essential modulator stop codon hypomorphic mutation identified in the previous patient. The occurrence of the same clinical features in 2 unrelated patients with the same genotype demonstrates that OL-EDA-ID is a genuine clinical syndrome. The clinical and biological descriptions of the proband and his mother further corroborate the relationship between IP and EDA. Both syndromes are allelic and are associated with mutations in NF-kappaB essential modulator, with a genotype-phenotype correlation in hemizygous males. In contrast, loss-of-function mutations and hypomorphic mutations may cause IP in females.",M2
11966763,"Expression of eotaxin, an eosinophil-selective chemokine, parallels eosinophil accumulation in the vesiculobullous stage of incontinentia pigmenti.Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is an X-linked dominant genodermatosis primarily affecting female children. The initial vesiculobullous stage of IP is characterized clinically by inflammatory papules, blisters, and pustules, and histopathologically by acanthosis, keratinocyte necrosis, epidermal spongiosis and massive epidermal eosinophil infiltration. The cause of this multisystem disease is attributed to the mutations of an X-linked regulatory gene, termed nuclear factor-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO). The exact mechanism of epidermal eosinophil accumulation has not yet been determined. We explored the possible role of an eosinophil-selective, nuclear factor-kappaB-activated chemokine, eotaxin, in the accumulation of eosinophils in the initial stage of the disease. Monoclonal antibody (6H9) specific for human eotaxin strongly labelled the suprabasal epidermis of IP skin, paralleling the upper epidermal accumulation of eosinophils, but did not label the epidermis of normal skin or lesional skin from patients with other inflammatory skin diseases not characterized by prominent eosinophil accumulation, namely dermatitis herpetiformis and selected cases of atopic dermatitis lacking significant numbers of eosinophils. In addition, endothelial cells in lesional skin of IP also exhibited strong expression of eotaxin, which correlated with perivascular and intravascular eosinophil infiltration. We also examined the in vitro effects on epidermally derived eotaxin of several cytokines that were nuclear factor-kappaB-activated and/or known to induce eotaxin expression. In normal human keratinocytes, proinflammatory cytokines either independently (IL-1alpha) or synergistically (tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)/ interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and TNF-alpha/IL-4) up-regulated eotaxin expression. These studies suggest that release of cytokines during the initial inflammatory stage of IP induces epidermal expression of eotaxin, which may play a role in the epidermal accumulation of eosinophils.",M2
11746157,"Hydrops fetalis in three male fetuses of a female with incontinentia pigmenti.OBJECTIVES: Careful investigation of hydrops fetalis (HF) is important with regard to genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis. HF is known to be associated with various genetic disorders. To date there has been only one report of a male fetus in whom incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) was associated with generalised oedema. We describe a family who had a girl with clinical signs of IP after three consecutive miscarriages of three male fetuses due to HF. RESULTS: Molecular genetic analysis showed a mutation in the NEMO/IKK(chi) gene in the girl and the mother, which confirmed the diagnosis of IP in both cases. In the two fetuses that could be investigated, inheritance of the affected maternal X chromosome could be demonstrated retrospectively by linkage analysis. CONCLUSION: The present findings suggest that IP might be an X-linked dominant trait causing HF in male fetuses. In cases of recurrent HF in male fetuses, minimal signs of IP in the maternal line should therefore be carefully investigated in order to be able to perform mutational analysis and to offer appropriate genetic counselling.",M2
11709543,"Multiple pathogenic and benign genomic rearrangements occur at a 35 kb duplication involving the NEMO and LAGE2 genes.The X-linked dominant and male-lethal disorder incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is caused by mutations in a gene called NEMO (IKK-gamma). We recently reported the structure of NEMO and demonstrated that most IP patients carry an identical deletion that arises due to misalignment between repeats. Affected male abortuses with the IP deletion had provided clues that a second, incomplete copy of NEMO was present in the genome. We have now identified clones containing this truncated copy (Delta NEMO) and incorporated them into a previously constructed physical contig in distal Xq28. Delta NEMO maps 22 kb distal to NEMO and only contains exons 3-10, confirming our proposed model. A sequence of 26 kb 3' of the NEMO coding sequence is also present in the same position relative to the Delta NEMO locus, bringing the total length of the duplication to 35.5 kb. The LAGE2 gene is also located within this duplicated region, and a similar but unique LAGE1 gene is located just distal to the duplicated loci. Mapping and sequence information indicated that the duplicated regions are in opposite orientation. Analysis of the great apes suggested that the NEMO/LAGE2 duplication occurred after divergence of the lineage leading to present day humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, approximately 10-15 million years ago. Intriguingly, despite this substantial evolutionary history, only 22 single nucleotide differences exist between the two copies over the entire 35.5 kb, making the duplications &gt;99% identical. This high sequence identity and the inverted orientations of the two copies, along with duplications of smaller internal sections within each copy, predispose this region to various genomic alterations. We detected four rearrangements that involved NEMO, Delta NEMO or LAGE1 and LAGE2. The high sequence similarity between the two NEMO/LAGE2 copies may be due to frequent gene conversion, as we have detected evidence of sequence transfer between them. Together, these data describe an unusual and complex genomic region that is susceptible to various types of pathogenic and polymorphic rearrangements, including the recurrent lethal deletion associated with IP.",M2
11673821,"Survival of male patients with incontinentia pigmenti carrying a lethal mutation can be explained by somatic mosaicism or Klinefelter syndrome.Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>), or  Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome,  is an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by abnormalities of skin, teeth, hair, and eyes; skewed X-inactivation; and recurrent miscarriages of male fetuses. IP results from mutations in the gene for NF-kappaB essential modulator (NEMO), with deletion of exons 4-10 of NEMO accounting for &gt;80% of new mutations. Male fetuses inheriting this mutation and other  null  mutations of NEMO usually die in utero. Less deleterious mutations can result in survival of males subjects, but with ectodermal dysplasia and immunodeficiency. Male patients with skin, dental, and ocular abnormalities typical of those seen in female patients with IP (without immunodeficiency) are rare. We investigated four male patients with clinical hallmarks of IP. All four were found to carry the deletion normally associated with male lethality in utero. Survival in one patient is explained by a 47,XXY karyotype and skewed X inactivation. Three other patients possess a normal 46,XY karyotype. We demonstrate that these patients have both wild-type and deleted copies of the NEMO gene and are therefore mosaic for the common mutation. Therefore, the repeat-mediated rearrangement leading to the common deletion does not require meiotic division. Hypomorphic alleles, a 47,XXY karyotype, and somatic mosaicism therefore represent three mechanisms for survival of males carrying a NEMO mutation.",M2
11590134,"A recurrent deletion in the ubiquitously expressed NEMO (IKK-gamma) gene accounts for the vast majority of incontinentia pigmenti mutations.Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is an X-linked dominant disorder characterized by abnormal skin pigmentation, retinal detachment, anodontia, alopecia, nail dystrophy and central nervous system defects. This disorder segregates as a male lethal disorder and causes skewed X-inactivation in female patients. IP is caused by mutations in a gene called NEMO, which encodes a regulatory component of the IkappaB kinase complex required to activate the NF-kappaB pathway. Here we report the identification of 277 mutations in 357 unrelated IP patients. An identical genomic deletion within NEMO accounted for 90% of the identified mutations. The remaining mutations were small duplications, substitutions and deletions. Nearly all NEMO mutations caused frameshift and premature protein truncation, which are predicted to eliminate NEMO function and cause cell lethality. Examination of families transmitting the recurrent deletion revealed that the rearrangement occurred in the paternal germline in most cases, indicating that it arises predominantly by intrachromosomal misalignment during meiosis. Expression analysis of human and mouse NEMO/Nemo showed that the gene becomes active early during embryogenesis and is expressed ubiquitously. These data confirm the involvement of NEMO in IP and will help elucidate the mechanism underlying the manifestation of this disorder and the in vivo function of NEMO. Based on these and other recent findings, we propose a model to explain the pathogenesis of this complex disorder.",M2
11241484,"Incontinentia pigmenti in a surviving male is accompanied by hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia and recurrent infection.Familial Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare X-linked dominant condition. The affected cases have characteristic skin lesions, hair, eye, teeth and nail abnormalities and may also have neurological problems. The diagnosis has traditionally been made on clinical grounds. Segregation analysis has suggested that it is lethal in males. Only one liveborn male has been reported who died at one day of age. Female cases of IP survive because of the moderating effects of Lyonization. This child was the affected son of a female with IP. He had a novel phenotype consistent with hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia with immune deficiency (HED-ID) but with additional features: he had major problems with hematological disturbances, failure to thrive due to malabsorption, recurrent infections, generalized osteosclerosis and lymphedema of his lower limbs. He also demonstrated some typical features of IP with a generalized reticular skin hyperpigmentation, sparse hair and delayed eruption of teeth. The gene for NEMO (NF-kappa B Essential Modulator) has recently been shown to be mutated in cases of IP. Furthermore, most (80%) of patients possess a recurrent genomic rearrangement that deletes part of the gene resulting in an inactive NEMO protein. In the male case described here, a NEMO stop codon mutation has been identified that has arisen de novo in his affected mother. This mutation is likely to have a less severe effect on NEMO activity and may explain why this child survived for two years and 7 months.",M2
11185738,"Recent progress in the genetics of incontinentia pigmenti (Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome).Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is a rare disorder which affects organs and tissues of ectodermal and mesodermal origin. It is characterized by swirled patterns of hyperpigmentation. In some cases, the condition is also associated with malformations of the teeth, nails, skeleton, hair, eyes, and the central nervous system. The disorder is inherited as an X-linked dominant trait and mostly affects females. However, there have been several cases of IP in males that survived to birth. While IP in females could be caused by a skewed pattern of X-inactivation, three mechanisms: namely, the half-chromatid hypothesis, unstable premutation, and a higher rate of de-novo germline mutations, have been proposed to explain the survival of affected male patients. Cytogenetic studies in several sporadic cases with signs similar to IP exhibited an X/autosomal translocation involving a breakpoint at Xp11, suggesting a gene locus on Xp11 (IP1). Linkage analysis of familial IP, on the other hand, has identified a second locus, in the Xq28 region (IP2). Molecular genetic analysis of two candidate genes located at Xp11 and Xq28, as well as the human homologue of the murine Str gene, failed to reveal any disease-causing mutations. Although heterozygous female mice deficient for the IKKgamma/NEMO gene exhibited dermatopathy similar to that in human IP, studies of the gene in human IP have not yet been available. In an effort to isolate the genes causing IP, cosmid clones containing the translocation breakpoint located at Xp11 and the transcriptional map of the Xq28 region were constructed. These maps could be invaluable tools in the identification of genes in the near future.",M2

11179023,"Atypical forms of incontinentia pigmenti in male individuals result from mutations of a cytosine tract in exon 10 of NEMO (IKK-gamma).Familial incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e> [MIM 308310]), or Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome, is an X-linked dominant and male-lethal disorder. We recently demonstrated that mutations in NEMO (IKK-gamma), which encodes a critical component of the NF-kappaB signaling pathway, were responsible for IP. Virtually all mutations eliminate the production of NEMO, causing the typical skewing of X inactivation in female individuals and lethality in male individuals, possibly through enhanced sensitivity to apoptosis. Most mutations also give rise to classic signs of IP, but, in this report, we describe two mutations in families with atypical phenotypes. Remarkably, each family included a male individual with unusual signs, including postnatal survival and either immune dysfunction or hematopoietic disturbance. We found two duplication mutations in these families, at a cytosine tract in exon 10 of NEMO, both of which remove the zinc (Zn) finger at the C-terminus of the protein. Two deletion mutations were also identified in the same tract in additional families. However, only the duplication mutations allowed male individuals to survive, and affected female individuals with duplication mutations demonstrated random or slight skewing of X inactivation. Similarly, NF-kappaB activation was diminished in the presence of duplication mutations and was completely absent in cells with deletion mutations. These results strongly indicate that male individuals can also suffer from IP caused by NEMO mutations, and we therefore urge a reevaluation of the diagnostic criteria.",M2
11047757,"A novel X-linked disorder of immune deficiency and hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia is allelic to incontinentia pigmenti and due to mutations in IKK-gamma (NEMO).Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia (HED), a congenital disorder of teeth, hair, and eccrine sweat glands, is usually inherited as an X-linked recessive trait, although rarer autosomal dominant and recessive forms exist. We have studied males from four families with HED and immunodeficiency (HED-ID), in which the disorder segregates as an X-linked recessive trait. Affected males manifest dysgammaglobulinemia and, despite therapy, have significant morbidity and mortality from recurrent infections. Recently, mutations in IKK-gamma (NEMO) have been shown to cause familial incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>). Unlike HED-ID, IP affects females and, with few exceptions, causes male prenatal lethality. IKK-gamma is required for the activation of the transcription factor known as  nuclear factor kappa B  and plays an important role in T and B cell function. We hypothesize that  milder  mutations at this locus may cause HED-ID. In all four families, sequence analysis reveals exon 10 mutations affecting the carboxy-terminal end of the IKK-gamma protein, a domain believed to connect the IKK signalsome complex to upstream activators. The findings define a new X-linked recessive immunodeficiency syndrome, distinct from other types of HED and immunodeficiency syndromes. The data provide further evidence that the development of ectodermal appendages is mediated through a tumor necrosis factor/tumor necrosis factor receptor-like signaling pathway, with the IKK signalsome complex playing a significant role.",M2
11005611,"The Str mouse as a model for incontinentia pigmenti.Striated mouse has been proposed as a model for incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) based on the similarities in genetic predisposition and syntenic gene localisation in mouse. IP is considered an ectodermal dysplasia with all four characteristic structures involved: sweat glands, hair, teeth and nails. Recently mutations have been found in the Nsdhl, encoding an NAD(P)H steroid dehydrogenase-like protein in Str and Bpa mice. We analysed the phenotype of the Str mouse to evaluate the involvement of ectodermally derived tissues. Our results demonstrated that in Str mouse in addition to abnormal coat texture, sweat glands were severely dystrophic or missing. Retinal degeneration and skeletal abnormalities were also found. We conclude that Str mouse is a good model to get new insights in the pathogenesis of ectodermal dysplasias and X linked male lethality in humans.",M2
10911992,"NEMO/IKK gamma-deficient mice model incontinentia pigmenti.Disruption of the X-linked gene encoding NF-kappa B essential modulator (NEMO) produces male embryonic lethality, completely blocks NF-kappa B activation by proinflammatory cytokines, and interferes with the generation and/or persistence of lymphocytes. Heterozygous female mice develop patchy skin lesions with massive granulocyte infiltration and hyperproliferation and increased apoptosis of keratinocytes. Diseased animals present severe growth retardation and early mortality. Surviving mice recover almost completely, presumably through clearing the skin of NEMO-deficient keratinocytes. Male lethality and strikingly similar skin lesions in heterozygous females are hallmarks of the human genetic disorder incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>). Together with the recent discovery that mutations in the human NEMO gene cause IP, our results indicate that we have created a mouse model for that disease.",M2
10911991,"Female mice heterozygous for IKK gamma/NEMO deficiencies develop a dermatopathy similar to the human X-linked disorder incontinentia pigmenti.IKK gamma/NEMO is the essential regulatory subunit of the I kappa B kinase (IKK), encoded by an X-linked gene in mice and humans. It is required for NF-kappa B activation and resistance to TNF-induced apoptosis. Female mice heterozygous for Ikk gamma/Nemo deficiency develop a unique dermatopathy characterized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation, skin inflammation, hyperkeratosis, and increased apoptosis. Although Ikk gamma+/- females eventually recover, Ikk gamma- males die in utero. These symptoms and inheritance pattern are very similar to those of incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>), a human genodermatosis, synthenic with the IKK gamma/NEMO locus. Indeed, biopsies and cells from IP patients exhibit defective IKK gamma/NEMO expression but normal expression of IKK catalytic subunits. This unique self-limiting disease, the first to be genetically linked to the IKK signaling pathway, is dependent on X-chromosome inactivation. We propose that the IKK gamma/NEMO-deficient cells trigger an inflammatory reaction that eventually leads to their death.",M2
10893071,"Ocular manifestations of incontinentia pigmenti.PURPOSE: The study aimed to evaluate the ocular manifestations in patients with incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>). METHODS: Thirty patients from different parts of Sweden participated. Orthoptic and ocular examinations were performed as well as evaluation of refraction and visual acuity. RESULTS: Ocular manifestations, probably associated with IP, were found in 77% (23/30) of the patients. Thirteen had serious or vision-threatening eye manifestations in one eye, of whom 7 were totally blind in that eye from retinal detachments. Ten patients had minor retinal and/or corneal changes. CONCLUSION: Ocular lesions in patients with IP may be serious and lead to blindness because of retinal disease. Ophthalmological follow-up is essential in the neonatal period and such a programme is recommended.",M2
10839543,"Genomic rearrangement in NEMO impairs NF-kappaB activation and is a cause of incontinentia pigmenti. The International Incontinentia Pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) Consortium.Familial incontinentia pigmenti (IP; MIM 308310) is a genodermatosis that segregates as an X-linked dominant disorder and is usually lethal prenatally in males. In affected females it causes highly variable abnormalities of the skin, hair, nails, teeth, eyes and central nervous system. The prominent skin signs occur in four classic cutaneous stages: perinatal inflammatory vesicles, verrucous patches, a distinctive pattern of hyperpigmentation and dermal scarring. Cells expressing the mutated X chromosome are eliminated selectively around the time of birth, so females with IP exhibit extremely skewed X-inactivation. The reasons for cell death in females and in utero lethality in males are unknown. The locus for IP has been linked genetically to the factor VIII gene in Xq28 (ref. 3). The gene for NEMO (NF-kappaB essential modulator)/IKKgamma (IkappaB kinase-gamma) has been mapped to a position 200 kilobases proximal to the factor VIII locus. NEMO is required for the activation of the transcription factor NF-kappaB and is therefore central to many immune, inflammatory and apoptotic pathways. Here we show that most cases of IP are due to mutations of this locus and that a new genomic rearrangement accounts for 80% of new mutations. As a consequence, NF-kappaB activation is defective in IP cells.",M2
10828739,"Evaluation of the norrie disease gene in a family with incontinentia pigmenti.Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) is an ectodermal multisystem disorder which can affect dental, ocular, cardiac and neurologic structures. The ocular changes of IP can have a very similar appearance to the retinal detachment of X-linked familial exudative vitreoretinopathy, which has been shown to be caused by the mutations in the Norrie disease gene. Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether similar mutations in the gene can account for the retinal pathology in patients with IP. To test our hypothesis, we have analyzed the entire Norrie disease gene for a family with IP, by single strand conformational polymorphism followed by DNA sequencing. The sequencing data revealed no disease-specific sequence alterations. These data suggest that ocular findings of IP are perhaps associated with different genes and there is no direct relationship between the genotype and phenotype.",M2

Verrucous lesions tend to last longer than vesicobullous eruptions, often persisting until 1 year of age. However, adult patients with verrucous lesions are rare. We report a case of keratoacanthoma with marked dyskeratosis on a pigmented patch in a 20-year-old woman.

Ambiguous diagnosis can complicate genetic counselling and attempts to refine the gene location in Xq28. Marked skewing of X-inactivation patterns is a hallmark of IP and provides a means for investigating uncertain cases. We have conducted X-inactivation studies in three families where Xq28 marker studies were at odds with the original clinical assessment.

9838260,"Incontinentia pigmenti (Bloch-Sulzberger-syndrome): case report and differential diagnosisto related dermato-ocular syndromes.BACKGROUND: Incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>; Bloch-Sulzberger syndrome) is an inherited disorder of skin pigmentation that is associated with skin (100%), dental (90%), skeletal (40%), central nervous (40%) and ocular (35%) abnormalities. The pathogenesis is not yet known. The disease is usually seen in females, as it is an X-linked dominantly inherited disease which is lethal in males. PATIENT PRESENTATION: We present a 9-year-old girl with the classical general and ocular signs of IP. She presented in early childhood with inflammatory vesicular skin changes which changed into pigmented skin alterations especially on the trunk. Ocular findings were microphthalmia and retrolental mass formation in one eye and retinal pigmentary changes in the other. In our patient, the spontaneous mutation may have been caused by the family's close neighbourhood to Semipalatinsk, Kasachstan, where regular nuclear tests took place very shortly before the pregnancy with our patient began. DISCUSSION: Ocular involvement is described in about a third of persons affected with IP. A nearly consistent and pathognomonic finding is a pigment retinopathy (mottled diffuse hypopigmentations). A further consistent finding are abnormalities of peripheral retinal vessels with areas of non-perfusion in the outer retina. The retinal pigment epitheliopathy and the abnormalities of retinal vessels are thought to be the underlying pathognomonic findings, with all other ocular signs being secondary (cataract, leucocoria, optic atrophy, strabismus, nystagmus and microphthalmus). Exudative retinal detachment occurs only in a minority, usually in very early childhood, when the skin lesions are exudative as well. IP patients should, however, be clinically observed regularly because of their retinal pigmentary changes.",M2
9605587,"Male cases of incontinentia pigmenti: case report and review.Male patients with Bloch-Sulzberger incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e> type II) are rare and more severely affected than their female counterparts, with a significant occurrence of sex chromosome aneuploidy. This document introduces a new male IP type II patient and reviews 48 males reported with IP. Twenty-eight of the 49 patients meet current criteria for diagnosis of IP type II. The phenotype is variable and the incidence of documented developmental delay is 25%. Five patients had Klinefelter syndrome (47,XXY). Most patients were reported prior to 1961 when chromosome analysis was not available. Biopsy and laboratory reports considered to be  consistent with  the diagnosis of IP were seen in patients meeting criteria as well as those who would not currently be given the diagnosis. The histologic findings considered diagnostic are varied. This variability may be accounted for by differences in stage of disease, biopsy site, histologic technique, and reporting style. Conversely, this may indicate that the diagnostic weight given to the biopsy should be reconsidered. Eosinophilia was not a consistent finding. Overall, differences in reporting, ascertainment, and length of follow-up lead to difficulty in interpreting or predicting the natural history of males with IP type II. Based on the existing literature, they appear to have a higher rate of mental retardation than the general population, but there does not appear to be a correlation between severity of physical and mental involvement. The presence of sex chromosome aneuploidy documented in the more recent cases emphasizes the need for chromosome analysis in any male patient suspected of IP type II.",M2

Guidelines have been published to aid in the identification and management of child maltreatment, and reporting of all suspicious cases is mandated by law. In our zealous efforts to protect children, some families are investigated because of misdiagnosed abnormalities, often cutaneous, leading to the unintentional injury of both patients and their families.

A second liveborn male had early postnatal distress and died after 1 day of life, after a fulminating clinical course. Polymorphic microsatellite markers, closely linked to the IP gene on the X chromosome, showed that each son inherited a different X chromosome from his mother.

Based on the observation of six unrelated females with clinical features of nonfamilial IP with constitutional de novo reciprocal X;autosome translocations, a putative incontinentia pigmenti type 1 locus (IP1; MIM No. 308300) was localized to region Xp11.21. Using available regional DNA markers, we constructed a yeast artificial chromosome (YAC) contig that contained 1.2 Mb of distal Xp11.21 and spanned two IP1 X-chromosomal breakpoints. This contig was used to generate a detailed molecular map of the region and identify three regional CpG islands. YAC-derived cosmids were used to clone and map the IP1 breakpoints to a 180-kb interval that was flanked by DNA markers DXS705 and DXS741.

Ocular and neurological involvement is the main determinant in the prognosis. Eye lesions include corneal flecks, cataracts, uveitis or optical atrophy with retrolental fribroplasia. The neurological involvement includes pyramidal syndrome, cerebral ataxia, microcephalia, and mental retardation. The disease has mainly an X-linked dominant transmission and is usually lethal for males. Rare cases are observed in boys, some being associated with Klinefelter syndrome.

The clinical features are consistent with the diagnosis of linear and whorled nevoid hypermelanosis (LWNH), but differ substantially from this entity by the pigmentary incontinence observed on both the paraffin and electron microscopy sections. Despite the presence of pigmentary incontinence, the diagnosis of incontinentia pigmenti (<e>IP</e>) can be ruled out on the basis that the patient is a male, with none of the characteristic anomalies present in this syndrome, and that he never presented with inflammatory or eruptive skin lesions.

We focus on these somewhat confusing clinical markers in a family, and on the genotypic diagnosis based on DNA analysis. An infant was born with a typical IP rash. Dermatologic examination of the women in her family revealed that her mother, her maternal aunt, and her grandmother had subtle skin signs reminiscent of IP. The four family members proved to be informative for DNA markers in the Xq28 region. Familial cases of IP are sometimes missed due to the lack of recognition of some late skin signs that are not always hyperpigmented streaks. Subtle, faint, hypochromic or atrophic lesions in a linear pattern may occur. Thus an accurate diagnosis of the women in a particular family also requires anamnestic data and recognition of extracutaneous anomalies. When a clinical diagnosis has been made, DNA marker analysis allows us to offer a prenatal diagnosis with minimal risk of error in case of further pregnancy.

To explain the mosaic disease expression of IP in males, we propose that the disease is caused by an unstable pre-mutation, which normally remains silent in males during early embryogenesis.
