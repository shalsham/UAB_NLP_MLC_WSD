20572373,"Lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzyme activities in <e>erythrocytes</e> of type 2 diabetic patients.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Although diabetes mellitus (DM) patients are claimed to be under oxidative stress because of prolonged exposure to hyperglycemia, the influence of glycemic control and cardiovascular complication in diabetes on oxidative stress parameters has not been fully studied. The present study aimed to investigate lipid peroxidation end product (malondialdehyde, MDA) and antioxidant enzymes in fairly controlled type 2 DM (fasting plasma glucose [FPG] &lt; or = 180 mg/dl) or type 2 DM complicated with coronary heart disease (CHD) and poorly controlled type 2 DM (FPG &gt; 180 mg/dl) in comparison to a normal healthy group (FPG &lt; 110 mg/dl). MATERIAL AND METHOD: MDA and antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and catalase (CAT) were determined in the red cell of 19 subjects with poorly controlled type 2 DM, 26 subjects with fairly controlled type 2 DM and 20 subjects with type 2 DM complicated with CHD who were matched for age and gender. Twenty healthy subjects with normal plasma glucose level and matched for age and gender were served as a control group. In all groups of DM these oxidative stress parameters were compared to a control group by one-way ANOVA test. Pearson rank correlation coefficient was used to compare the relationship between FPG and oxidative stress status in type 2 DM and normal controls. RESULTS: The red cell MDA levels were significantly higher in all types of diabetes compared to age-matched normal controls. The mean of red cell MDA level was highest in type 2 DM complicated with CHD. Red cell antioxidant enzyme activities were also significantly increased except for SOD and GPx activities in fairly controlled type 2 DM. The significant positive correlation between oxidative stress status (as MDA and CAT) and FPG was found in poorly controlled type 2 DM and type 2 DM complicated with CHD whereas in fairly controlled type 2 DM the significant positive correlation between CAT and FPG was only observed. CONCLUSION: These findings strongly confirmed the evidence that diabetic patients were susceptible to oxidative stress and higher blood glucose level had an association with free radical-mediated lipid peroxidation. The highest level of MDA in type 2 DM complicated with CHD suggested that oxidative stress played an important role in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular complication. The results also showed the increase in antioxidant enzymes. These could probably be due to adaptive response to pro-oxidant in diabetic state. Hence, there seems to be imbalance between oxidant and antioxidant systems in type 2 diabetic patients.",M1
20518653,"Gamma-tocotrienol protects hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells in mice after total-body irradiation.We analyzed the radioprotective effects of gamma-tocotrienol (GT3) on hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) and progenitor cells (HPCs) in sublethally irradiated mice. Flow cytometry analysis indicated that radiation depleted HPCs (c-Kit(+), Lin(-)) to 40% at days 2 and 4 after total-body irradiation (TBI) in all treatment groups. The HPC numbers in GT3-treated mice recovered almost completely (90%) at day 7 but remained depleted in vehicle-treated mice (30%) even at day 13 after TBI. An in vitro colony-forming assay on sorted HSCs (Lin(-), Sca1(+), c-Kit(+)) indicated that TBI reduced the number of colonies to 40% and 50% at day 17 and 60, respectively, in vehicle-treated groups compared to unirradiated controls (na√Øve). GT3-treated irradiated mice maintained higher numbers of colonies (86% and 80% compared to na√Øve mice), thereby preserving the self-renewable capacity of HSCs. Histopathology of sternal bone marrow indicated more regenerative microfoci for myeloid cells and megakaryocytes and higher overall cellularity in GT3-treated mice compared to vehicle controls at days 7 and 13 after TBI. GT3 treatment also reduced the frequency of micronucleated <e>erythrocytes</e> significantly in irradiated mice. Our results demonstrate that GT3 protected hematopoietic tissue by preserving the HSCs and HPCs and by preventing persistent DNA damage.",M1
20511673,"Polyphenols enhance total oxidant-scavenging capacities of human blood by binding to red blood cells.The present study offers a new look at the role of <e>erythrocytes</e> and of erythrocytes-polyphenol complexes as potent 'sinks' for reactive oxygen species. We hereby show that human erythrocytes have the capacity not only to carry oxygen, but also to bind avidly to their surfaces a large variety of polyphenol antioxidants, which endows upon such complexes enhanced total oxidant-scavenging capacities (TOSC). This was proven by using confocal microscopy, 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl radical, Folin-Ciocalteu's reagent, cyclic voltammetry and chemiluminescence techniques. The results presented suggest that the true TOSC of blood is the sum of intracellular antioxidants of red blood cells and other blood cells (mainly due to catalase), the polyphenols bound to their surfaces and the antioxidant agents present in plasma. Since erythrocytes can avidly bind and rapidly remove circulating polyphenols, the rule of the thumb to quantify antioxidants in health and disease processes exclusively in plasma as customary in clinical settings, does not represent the true TOSC of whole blood. We also postulate that circulating erythrocytes and possibly also other blood cells might be constantly coated by polyphenols from supplemented nutrients, which act as antioxidant depots and can thus act as protectors against the harmful consequences of oxidative stress. Further studies are needed to determine the faith of polyphenols in the circulation and their sequestration in the spleen.",M1
20491333,"[Role of hemoglobin affinity to oxygen in adaptation to hypoxemia]One of the basic mechanisms of adapting to hypoxemia is a decrease in the affinity of hemoglobin for oxygen. This process occurs mainly due to the increased synthesis of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG) in the <e>erythrocytes</e>, as well as through the Bohr effect. Hemoglobin with decreased affinity for oxygen increases the oxygenation of tissues, because it gives up oxygen more easily during microcirculation. In foetal circulation, however, at a partial oxygen pressure (pO2) of 25 mmHg in the umbilical vein, the oxygen carrier is type F hemoglobin which has a high oxygen affinity. The commonly accepted role for hemoglobin F is limited to facilitating diffusion through the placenta. Is fetal life the only moment when haemoglobin F is useful? THE AIM OF STUDY was to create a mathematical model, which would answer the question at what conditions an increase, rather than a decrease, in haemoglobin oxygen affinity is of benefit to the body. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Using the kinetics of dissociation of oxygen from hemoglobin described by the Hill equation as the basis for further discussion, we created a mathematical model describing the pO2 value in the microcirculatory system and its dependence on arterial blood pO2. The calculations were performed for hemoglobin with low oxygen affinity (adult type) and high-affinity hemoglobin (fetal type). The modelling took into account both physiological and pathological ranges of acid-base equilibrium and tissue oxygen extraction parameters. RESULTS: It was shown that for the physiological range of acid-base equilibrium and the resting level of tissue oxygen extraction parameters, with an arterial blood pO2 of 26.8 mmHg, the higher-affinity hemoglobin becomes the more effective oxygen carrier. It was also demonstrated that the arterial blood pO2, below which the high-affinity hemoglobin becomes the more effective carrier, is dependent on blood pH and the difference between the arterial and venous oxygen saturation levels. Simulations performed for the pathological states showed that acidosis and increased tissue oxygen demand lead to a broadened arterial blood pO2 range, in which the high-affinity hemoglobin is more efficient. CONCLUSIONS: Contrary to the widely held view that the only response to hypoxemia is a decrease in haemoglobin oxygen affinity, it was shown that under extreme hypoxemic conditions, an increased haemoglobin oxygen affinity improves the oxygenation of tissues. It was also shown that the dominance of hemoglobin with a high oxygen affinity rapidly exceeds hemoglobin with low oxygen affinity in the case of acidosis with its accompanying high tissue oxygen extraction. In cases of extreme disruptions of the acid-base equilibrium, the dominance of high-oxygen-affinity hemoglobin spans over the entire possible range of pO2 in arterial blood.",M1

Changes in cytogenetic parameters and instability in <e>erythrocytes</e> and epithelial cells of gills were estimated in reply to influence of copper solutions. The frequency of epithelial gill cells at a stage of apoptosis was investigated. The opportunity to use the hematological parameters and cytogenetic instability set for xenobiotics effects in fishes was shown.",M1
20472854,"Diagnosis of iron deficiency in patients undergoing hemodialysis.To diagnose iron deficiency in patients undergoing hemodialysis, the percentage of hypochromic RBCs (with cellular hemoglobin concentration &lt;280 g/L [HYPO%]) and mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (CHret) provided by the Siemens ADVIA 120 and 2120 analyzers (Siemens Diagnostic Solutions, Tarrytown, NY) were proposed as alternatives to biochemical tests. Sysmex, with its XE-5000 analyzer (Sysmex, Kobe, Japan), also proposed the percentage of <e>erythrocytes</e> with cellular hemoglobin content lower than 17 pg (%Hypo-He) and equivalent of the mean reticulocyte hemoglobin content (Ret-He) with similar clinical applications. Our aim was to verify the clinical usefulness of the biochemical and cellular parameters as predictors of iron deficiency in patients undergoing long-term hemodialysis. We studied 69 patients undergoing hemodialysis 3 times weekly. The baseline values of serum ferritin and percentage of transferrin saturation were poor predictors of iron responsiveness. Better ability was demonstrated by reticulocyte indices (area under the curve [AUC], 0.74 for CHret and 0.72 for Ret-He; best cutoff values, 31.2 and 30.6 pg, respectively) and erythrocyte parameters (AUC, 0.72 for HYPO% and 0.68 for %Hypo-He; best cutoff values, 5.8 and 2.7, respectively). The newly proposed Ret-He and %Hypo-He can provide clinicians with information equivalent to CHret and HYPO%.",M1
20471364,"Ultraviolet irradiation induces autofluorescence enhancement via production of reactive oxygen species and photodecomposition in <e>erythrocytes</e>.Ultraviolet (UV) light has a significant influence on human health. In this study, human erythrocytes were exposed to UV light to investigate the effects of UV irradiation (UVI) on autofluorescence. Our results showed that high-dose continuous UVI enhanced erythrocyte autofluorescence, whereas low-dose pulsed UVI alone did not have this effect. Further, we found that H(2)O(2), one type of reactive oxygen species (ROS), accelerated autofluorescence enhancement under both continuous and pulsed UVI. In contrast, continuous and pulsed visible light did not result in erythrocyte autofluorescence enhancement in the presence or absence of H(2)O(2). Moreover, NAD(P)H had little effect on UVI-induced autofluorescence enhancement. From these studies, we conclude that UVI-induced erythrocyte autofluorescence enhancement via both UVI-dependent ROS production and photodecomposition. Finally, we present a theoretical study of this autofluorescence enhancement using a rate equation model. Notably, the results of this theoretical simulation agree well with the experimental data further supporting our conclusion that UVI plays two roles in the autofluorescence enhancement process.",M1
20469640,"Genotoxic effect of epirubicin in mouse bone marrow in vivo.The genotoxic effect of epirubicin, a semisynthetic anthracycline antibiotic which has been used as an anticancer drug, was investigated in vivo on bone marrow cells of Swiss albino mice using the micronucleus test. To determine the incidence of micronuclei, mice were injected intraperitoneally with the drug at single doses of 4, 6, 8, and 10 mg/kg body weight. Then, bone marrow was sampled 18, 24, 36, and 48 h after the treatment. Polychromatic and normochromatic <e>erythrocytes</e> were examined for the presence of micronuclei. Epirubicin significantly increased the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic erythrocytes (MNPCEs) for all treatment periods compared with the negative control (P &lt; 0.001). The frequency of MNPCEs increased with the dose, but at the highest dose used (which is considered to be quite toxic), the frequency of MNPCEs was rather lower. Epirubicin also decreased the ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic erythrocytes (PCE/NCE) for all sampling intervals, which is indicative of bone marrow cytotoxicity. It can be concluded from the present study that the anticancer drug epirubicin has genotoxic effects on mouse bone marrow cells.",M1
20466936,"A plant-like kinase in Plasmodium falciparum regulates parasite egress from <e>erythrocytes</e>.Clinical malaria is associated with the proliferation of Plasmodium parasites in human erythrocytes. The coordinated processes of parasite egress from and invasion into erythrocytes are rapid and tightly regulated. We have found that the plant-like calcium-dependent protein kinase PfCDPK5, which is expressed in invasive merozoite forms of Plasmodium falciparum, was critical for egress. Parasites deficient in PfCDPK5 arrested as mature schizonts with intact membranes, despite normal maturation of egress proteases and invasion ligands. Merozoites physically released from stalled schizonts were capable of invading new erythrocytes, separating the pathways of egress and invasion. The arrest was downstream of cyclic guanosine monophosphate-dependent protein kinase (PfPKG) function and independent of protease processing. Thus, PfCDPK5 plays an essential role during the blood stage of malaria replication.",M1
20457837,"Functional NMDA receptors in rat <e>erythrocytes</e>.N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors are ligand-gated nonselective cation channels mediating fast neuronal transmission and long-term potentiation in the central nervous system. These channels have a 10-fold higher permeability for Ca(2+) compared with Na(+) or K(+) and binding of the agonists (glutamate, homocysteine, homocysteic acid, NMDA) triggers Ca(2+) uptake. The present study demonstrates the presence of NMDA receptors in rat erythrocytes. The receptors are most abundant in both erythroid precursor cells and immature red blood cells, reticulocytes. Treatment of erythrocytes with NMDA receptor agonists leads to a rapid increase in intracellular Ca(2+) resulting in a transient shrinkage via Gardos channel activation. Additionally, the exposure of erythrocytes to NMDA receptor agonists causes activation of the nitric oxide (NO) synthase facilitating either NO production in l-arginine-containing medium or superoxide anion (O(2)(.-)) generation in the absence of l-arginine. Conversely, treatment with an NMDA receptor antagonist MK-80, or the removal of Ca(2+) from the incubation medium causes suppression of Ca(2+) accumulation and prevents attendant changes in cell volume and NO/O(2)(.-) production. These results suggest that the NMDA receptor activity in circulating erythrocytes is regulated by the plasma concentrations of homocysteine and homocysteic acid. Moreover, receptor hyperactivation may contribute to an increased incidence of thrombosis during hyperhomocysteinemia.",M1
20450010,"Blood parasites of mound-building mouse, Mus spicilegus Pet√©nyi, 1882 (Mammalia, Rodentia).Mound-building mice, Mus spicilegus, were studied for the blood parasites in Eastern Slovakia, vicinity Kechnec village near Kosice town (Kosick√° kotlina basin, 21 degrees 14' E, 48 degrees 33' N) during years 2002-2005. Overall, 251 specimens were examined. The parasites were detected using microhematokrit centrifugation technique and on the Giemsa's method stained blood smears and light microscopy. The parasites were found in 3.57% of specimens; 1.20% of mice were infected with Bartonella sp., 2.39% were infected with Babesia piroplasms. No Hepatozoon hemogregarines and trypanosomes were observed. The intensity of infection with Bartonella was low, less than 0.01% of <e>erythrocytes</e> were invaded, the percent of the erythrocytes with Babesia sp. was less than 0.01%. The morphological description and measurements of parasites were made using the  Analysis  software combined with a video camera and a microscope. The mean size of Bartonella sp. bacteria's were 0.8 x 0.3 microm, range 0.4-1.5 x 0.1-0.9 microm, Babesia sp. occurred in pear-shaped and ring-like forms, 1.00-1.27 microm in diameter, and 0.98-1.27 microm in size, respectively. The regular form of four cells-- maltese cross  was not noticed. This is the first record infection of Mus spicilegus with blood parasites.",M1
20438064,"Mechanism-based inhibitors of the aspartyl protease plasmepsin II as potential antimalarial agents.Four aspartyl proteases known as plasmepsins are involved in the degradation of hemoglobin by Plasmodium falciparum, which causes a large percentage of malaria deaths. The enzyme plasmepsin II (Plm II) is the most extensively studied of these aspartyl proteases and catalyzes the initial step in the breakdown of hemoglobin by the parasite. Several groups have reported the design, synthesis, and evaluation of reversible peptidomimetic inhibitors of Plm II as potential antimalarial agents. We now report four peptidomimetic analogues, compounds 6-9, which are rationally designed to act as mechanism-based inhibitors of Plm II. Three of these analogues produce potent irreversible inactivation of the enzyme with IC(50) values in the low nanomolar range. Of these three compounds, two retain the low micromolar IC(50) values of the parent compound in Plasmodium falciparum (clone 3D7) infected <e>erythrocytes</e>. These analogues are the first examples of fully characterized mechanism-based inactivators for an aspartyl protease and show promise as novel antimalarial agents.",M1
20432707,"[Seasonal activity of frog Rana ridibunda <e>erythrocytes</e> by data of electrophoretic mobility]The peculiarities of frog erythrocytes electrophoretic mobility, coupled to the seasonal course of temperatures, have been studied. At the periods of anabiosis and of burst of hemopoiesis, in the vascular bed there increases the portion of functionally young erythrocytes (up to 28%) with increased values of the cell membrane surface charge. Preparation to hibernation is accompanied by a rise of the number of circulating functionally worn-down blood cells (up to 60%) with low values of the superficial charge and low mobility in electrical field. Use of the cell microelectrophoresis method of evaluation of seasonal activity of frog erythrocytes allows obtained objective data about the cellular surface charge and its depending functional cell activity without submitting the erythrocytes to modifying actions.",M1
20430017,"Effect of thiol drugs on tert-butyl hydroperoxide induced luminol chemiluminescence in human <e>erythrocytes</e>, erythrocyte lysate, and erythrocyte membranes.The paper investigates the effect of thiol drugs (RSH) under oxidative stress condition using luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence technique. The examinations included N-acetylcysteine (NAC), N-acetylpenicillamine (NAP), penicillamine (PEN), mesna (MES), and tiopronin (TPR). The model systems contained isolated human erythrocytes (RBC), erythrocyte lysates (LYS) or erythrocyte membranes (MEM) exposed to tert-butyl hydroperoxide (t-BuOOH). Under the influence of RSH, a bimodal character of some experimental chemiluminescence curves was observed and the kinetic solution was considered as the sum of two logistic-exponential processes. These chemiluminescence changes probably reflected two connected processes--scavenging by RSH of the t-BuOOH-induced free radicals and simultaneous generation of thiol-derived secondary free radicals. Individual differences in thiols interaction showed a multivariate set of the kinetic curve descriptors. The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) well distinguished subsets of RSH influence in systems with RBC or LYS. Generally, the action of NAC was exclusively pro-oxidant in both systems, with RBC and LYS. The behaviour of MES or NAP in these systems was also pro-oxidant but many times less prominent than NAC. Under the influence of TPR a dramatic switch in the anti-oxidant effect was observed in system with RBC to very pro-oxidant effect in LYS. The influence of PEN was analogical to TPR but very weak. This experimental model together with kinetic solution of the unique bimodal chemiluminescence curves, and PCA, supply new insights to the dual (anti- and pro-oxidant) effects of thiol drugs under oxidative stress condition.",M1
20427769,"Cross-talk between T cells and NK cells generates rapid effector responses to Plasmodium falciparum-infected <e>erythrocytes</e>.Rapid cell-mediated immune responses, characterized by production of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IFN-gamma, can inhibit intraerythrocytic replication of malaria parasites and thereby prevent onset of clinical malaria. In this study, we have characterized the kinetics and cellular sources of the very early IFN-gamma response to Plasmodium falciparum-infected RBCs among human PBMCs. We find that NK cells dominate the early (12-18 h) IFN-gamma response, that NK cells and T cells contribute equally to the response at 24 h, and that T cells increasingly dominate the response from 48 h onward. We also find that although gammadelta T cells can produce IFN-gamma in response to P. falciparum-infected RBCs, they are greatly outnumbered by alphabeta T cells, and thus, the majority of the IFN-gamma(+) T cells are alphabeta T cells and not gammadelta T cells; gammadelta T cells are, however, an important source of TNF. We have previously shown that NK cell responses to P. falciparum-infected RBCs require cytokine and contact-dependent signals from myeloid accessory cells. In this study, we demonstrate that NK cell IFN-gamma responses to P. falciparum-infected RBCs are also crucially dependent on IL-2 secreted by CD4(+) T cells in an MHC class II-dependent manner, indicating that the innate response to infection actually relies upon complex interactions between NK cells, T cells, and accessory cells. We conclude that activation of NK cells may be a critical function of IL-2-secreting CD4(+) T cells and that standard protocols for evaluation of Ag-specific immune responses need to be adapted to include assessment of NK cell activation as well as T cell-derived IL-2.",M1
20423460,"Novel cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptides from Equus asinus.In the present study, EA-CATH1 and EA-CATH2 were identified from a constructed lung cDNA library of donkey (Equus asinus) as members of cathelicidin-derived antimicrobial peptides, using a nested PCR-based cloning strategy. Composed of 25 and 26 residues, respectively, EA-CATH1 and EA-CATH2 are smaller than most other cathelicidins and have no sequence homology to other cathelicidins identified to date. Chemically synthesized EA-CATH1 exerted potent antimicrobial activity against most of the 32 strains of bacteria and fungi tested, especially the clinically isolated drug-resistant strains, and minimal inhibitory concentration values against Gram-positive bacteria were mostly in the range of 0.3-2.4 microg mL(-1). EA-CATH1 showed an extraordinary serum stability and no haemolytic activity against human <e>erythrocytes</e> in a dose up to 20 microg mL(-1). CD spectra showed that EA-CATH1 mainly adopts an alpha-helical conformation in a 50% trifluoroethanol/water solution, but a random coil in aqueous solution. Scanning electron microscope observations of Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC2592) treated with EA-CATH1 demonstrated that EA-CATH could cause rapid disruption of the bacterial membrane, and in turn lead to cell lysis. This might explain the much faster killing kinetics of EA-CATH1 than conventional antibiotics revealed by killing kinetics data. In the presence of CaCl(2), EA-CATH1 exerted haemagglutination activity, which might potentiate an inhibition against the bacterial polyprotein interaction with the host erythrocyte surface, thereby possibly restricting bacterial colonization and spread.",M1
20416103,"Cell-associated hemolysis activity in the clinical strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens MFN1032.BACKGROUND: MFN1032 is a clinical Pseudomonas fluorescens strain able to grow at 37 degrees C. MFN1032 cells induce necrosis and apoptosis in rat glial cells at this temperature. This strain displays secretion-mediated hemolytic activity involving phospholipase C and cyclolipopeptides. Under laboratory conditions, this activity is not expressed at 37 degrees C. This activity is tightly regulated and is subject to phase variation. RESULTS: We found that MFN1032 displays a cell-associated hemolytic activity distinct from the secreted hemolytic activity. Cell-associated hemolysis was expressed at 37 degrees C and was only detected in vitro in mid log growth phase in the presence of <e>erythrocytes</e>. We studied the regulation of this activity in the wild-type strain and in a mutant defective in the Gac two-component pathway. GacS/GacA is a negative regulator of this activity. In contrast to the Pseudomonas fluorescens strains PfO-1 and Pf5, whose genomes have been sequenced, the MFN1032 strain has the type III secretion-like genes hrcRST belonging to the hrpU operon. We showed that disruption of this operon abolished cell-associated hemolytic activity. This activity was not detected in P.fluorescens strains carrying similar hrc genes, as for the P. fluorescens psychrotrophic strain MF37. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge this the first demonstration of cell-associated hemolytic activity of a clinical strain of Pseudomonas fluorescens. Moreover, this activity seems to be related to a functional hrpU operon and is independent of biosurfactant production. Precise link between a functional hrpU operon and cell-associated hemolytic activity remains to be elucidated.",M1
20413512,"Increased expression of beta-N-acetylglucosaminidase in <e>erythrocytes</e> from individuals with pre-diabetes and diabetes.OBJECTIVE: O-linked beta-N-acetylglucosamine (O-GlcNAc) plays an important role in the development of insulin resistance and glucose toxicity. O-GlcNAcylation is regulated by O-GlcNAc transferase (OGT), which attaches O-GlcNAc to serine and/or threonine residues of proteins and by O-GlcNAcase, which removes O-GlcNAc. We investigated the expression of these two enzymes in erythrocytes of human subjects with diabetes or pre-diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Volunteers with normal condition, pre-diabetes, and diabetes were recruited through a National Institutes of Health (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases) study and at the Johns Hopkins Comprehensive Diabetes Center. Erythrocyte proteins were extracted and hemoglobins were depleted. Global O-GlcNAcylation of erythrocyte proteins was confirmed by Western blotting using an O-GlcNAc-specific antibody. Relative OGT and O-GlcNAcase protein amounts were determined by Western blot analysis. Relative expression of O-GlcNAcase was compared with the level of A1C. RESULTS: Erythrocyte proteins are highly O-GlcNAcylated. O-GlcNAcase expression is significantly increased in erythrocytes from both individuals with pre-diabetes and diabetes compared with normal control subjects. Unlike O-GlcNAcase, protein levels of OGT did not show significant changes. CONCLUSIONS: O-GlcNAcase expression is increased in erythrocytes from both individuals with pre-diabetes and individuals with less well-controlled diabetes. These findings, together with the previous study that demonstrated the increased site-specific O-GlcNAcylation of certain erythrocyte proteins, suggest that the upregulation of O-GlcNAcase might be an adaptive response to hyperglycemia-induced increases in O-GlcNAcylation, which are likely deleterious to erythrocyte functions. In any case, the early and substantial upregulation of O-GlcNAcase in individuals with pre-diabetes may eventually have diagnostic utility.",M1

20404042,"Insulin inhibits human erythrocyte cAMP accumulation and ATP release: role of phosphodiesterase 3 and phosphoinositide 3-kinase.In non-erythroid cells, insulin stimulates a signal transduction pathway that results in the activation of phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) and subsequent phosphorylation of phosphodiesterase 3 (PDE3). <e>Erythrocytes</e> possess insulin receptors, PI3K and PDE3B. These cells release adenosine triphosphate (ATP) when exposed to reduced O(2) tension via a signaling pathway that requires activation of the G protein, Gi, as well as increases in cAMP. Although insulin inhibits ATP release from human erythrocytes in response to Gi activation by mastoparan 7 (Mas 7), no effect on cAMP was described. Here, we investigated the hypothesis that insulin activates PDE3 in human erythrocytes via a PI3K-mediated mechanism resulting in cAMP hydrolysis and inhibition of ATP release. Incubation of human erythrocytes with Mas 7 resulted in a 62 +/- 7% increase in cAMP (n = 9, P &lt; 0.05) and a 306 +/- 69% increase in ATP release (n = 9, P &lt; 0.05), both of which were attenuated by pre-treatment with insulin. Selective inhibitors of PDE3 (cilostazol) or PI3K (LY294002) rescued these effects of insulin. These results support the hypothesis that insulin activates PDE3 in erythrocytes via a PI3K-dependent mechanism. Once activated, PDE3 limits Mas 7-induced increases in intracellular cAMP. This effect of insulin leads, ultimately, to decreased ATP release in response to Mas 7. Activation of Gi is required for reduced O(2) tension-induced ATP release from erythrocytes and this ATP release has been shown to participate in the matching of O(2) supply with demand in skeletal muscle. Thus, pathological increases in circulating insulin could, via activation of PDE3 in erythrocytes, inhibit ATP release from these cells, depriving the peripheral circulation of one mechanism that could aid in the regulation of the delivery of O(2) to meet tissue metabolic need.",M1
20397800,"Evaluation of plasma, <e>erythrocytes</e>, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid antioxidant defense system in sulfur mustard-injured patients.INTRODUCTION: Sulfur mustard (SM) is a strong alkylating agent that causes acute and chronic effects on different organs following exposure. Main late respiratory complications are chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, bronchiectasis, asthma, and bronchiolitis obliterans. It seems that oxidative stress plays a major role in pathogenesis of diseases. This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term effect of SM on plasma, erythrocytes, and brochoalveolar lavage fluid antioxidant defense system in SM-injured patients. METHODS: Brochoalveolar lavage fluid, plasma, and erythrocyte samples were taken from 54 patients in the case group exposed to SM and 25 controls with chronic respiratory disease without a history of exposure to SM. RESULTS: Superoxide dismutase, catalase, and glutathione peroxidase activities in lavage fluid, plasma, and erythrocytes were significantly higher in case group. The increased glutathione S-transferase activity in lavage fluid was associated with a depletion of glutathione and an increase of malondialdehyde levels. There was no significant change observed in glutathione reductase activity. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that oxidative damage might have an important role for patients exposed to SM. SM may induce an oxidative stress response by depleting the antioxidant defense systems and increasing lipid peroxidation in lung cells.",M1
20392198,"Acute restraint stress increases the frequency of vinblastine-induced micronuclei in mouse bone marrow cells.Acute physiological stress induces remarkable effects on the nervous, endocrine, and immune systems and also on cellular metabolism and cell division processes. Stress-induced instability of cellular mechanisms might play an important role in increasing cell division disorders. In this study, a relationship between stress and micronucleus (MN) induction in mouse (balb/c) bone marrow cells following vinblastine treatment, or stress or stress and vinblastine treatment in comparison to a non-stressed control group was investigated. In order to test the effects of treatments on MN induction, an in vivo MN assay was performed on bone marrow cells. The results revealed a significantly greater increase in MNs in bone marrow cells (polychromatic <e>erythrocytes</e>) from the stressed/vinblastine treated mice. The data indicate the ability of exposure to an emotional stressor to enhance the damaging actions on bone marrow cells of an aneugenic agent.",M1
20387663,"[Disorder of membrane protein spectrum of <e>erythrocytes</e> in type 1 diabetes mellitus]The research has shown substantial changes in the percentage correlation between plasmatic membrane proteins and erythrocyte cytoskeleton (alpha-spectrin, beta-spectrin, ankyrin, band 4.1) under type 1 diabetes mellitus. It has also established the difference in the content of erythrocyte membrane glycoproteins, i.e. band 3 proteins and glycophorine A, in healthy donors and patients with diabetes. Thus the content of glycophorine A decreased by 27%, while the content of band 3 protein increased by 23%. Under the pathology, changes in the structure of carbohydrate determinants of erythrocytes membrane glycoproteins were revealed by means of the lectin blot analysis. Type 1 diabetes mellitus is accompanied by an increase in the number of glycoproteins with mannose-containing carbohydrate determinants complementary to Con A and LCA, on the one hand, and a decrease in the number of glycoproteins with sialo- and galactose-containing oligosaccharides complementary to WGA and RCA lectins, on the other hand, on the erythrocyte membrane surface.",M1
20378845,"Red cells, hemoglobin, heme, iron, and atherogenesis.OBJECTIVE: We investigated whether red cell infiltration of atheromatous lesions promotes the later stages of atherosclerosis. METHODS AND RESULTS: We find that oxidation of ferro (FeII) hemoglobin in ruptured advanced lesions occurs generating ferri (FeIII) hemoglobin and via more extensive oxidation ferrylhemoglobin (FeIII/FeIV=O). The protein oxidation marker dityrosine accumulates in complicated lesions, accompanied by the formation of cross-linked hemoglobin, a hallmark of ferrylhemoglobin. Exposure of normal red cells to lipids derived from atheromatous lesions causes hemolysis and oxidation of liberated hemoglobin. In the interactions between hemoglobin and atheroma lipids, hemoglobin and heme promote further lipid oxidation and subsequently endothelial reactions such as upregulation of heme oxygenase-1 and cytotoxicity to endothelium. Oxidative scission of heme leads to release of iron and a feed-forward process of iron-driven plaque lipid oxidation. The inhibition of heme release from globin by haptoglobin and sequestration of heme by hemopexin suppress hemoglobin-mediated oxidation of lipids of atheromatous lesions and attenuate endothelial cytotoxicity. CONCLUSIONS: The interior of advanced atheromatous lesions is a prooxidant environment in which <e>erythrocytes</e> lyse, hemoglobin is oxidized to ferri- and ferrylhemoglobin, and released heme and iron promote further oxidation of lipids. These events amplify the endothelial cell cytotoxicity of plaque components.",M1
20369732,"[The structure and role of CR1 complement receptor in physiology]CR1 (Complement Receptor type 1, C3bR, CD35) is a polymorphic glycoprotein expressed on <e>erythrocytes</e>, leukocytes and glomerular podocytes. It consists of extracellular, transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains. Soluble form of CR1 (sCR1), lacking the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domains, is present in serum. CR1 belongs to the Regulator of Complement Activation (RCA) family, which is characterized by the appearance of small consensus repeats (SCR). Gene for CR1 is localized on chromosome 1q32. Polymorphism of erythrocyte CR1 is connected with the difference in length of molecule (molecular weight), level of the expression of CR1 (number of receptors) on red blood cells and the Knops blood group antigens. CR1 is a receptor for C3b and C4b and plays an important role in the removal of immune complexes coated with C3b and C4b. It also regulates the complement cascade activation by preventing formation of classical and alternative pathway convertases and by acting as a cofactor for factor I mediated cleavage of C3b to iC3b, C3c i C3dg. CR1 takes part in pathogenesis and development of various autoimmune and infection diseases.",M1

Degenerative processes in the bones usually concern large joints: knee joints in 25-40% of cases, similarly in case of hip joints. Because of the role the joints play, the arthrosis may result in physical limitations or disability. The aim of the study was to evaluate the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase (CuZn-SOD) in <e>erythrocytes</e> in patients suffering from the coxarthrosis--as the studied group and in healthy people--as the control group. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Determining the activity of catalase and superoxide dismutase in the group of 17 patients hospitalized because of coxarthrosis. RESULTS: In the study about 90% increase of the activity of the enzymes was determined in the studied group, in which the chemical compound 3{(2-aminothiazolyl)methylene}4H-1-benzopyran-4-one was added to the blood, in comparison with the control group. CONCLUSION: The results of the test on catalase and superoxide dismutase clearly indicate that the free radicals participate in the whole course of coxarthrosis.",M1
20369718,"[Influence of copper (II) complex on the activity of selected oxidative enzymes]Coxarthrosis results in physical limitations (hypokinesis) and a necessity to change one's life style to the one that does not require much movement. Physical inactivity leads rapidly to metabolic processes inhibition. The processes of protein, carbohydrate and lipid catabolism intensify. Abnormal metabolism of polyunsaturated fatty acids occurs, which consequently leads to the development of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to the acceleration of lipid peroxidation. Therefore, it is well-founded to seek for a new group of compounds demonstrating interesting biochemical properties. Among such already known compounds are chromone, azole and flavone derivatives, known for their oxidative properties. The aim of the study was to assess the antioxidant enzymes: catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPX) in <e>erythrocytes</e> in 25 patients suffering from coxarthrosis in comparison with healthy persons. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The activity of catalase was determined in erythrocytes using the method of Beers and Sizer at 240 nm on the Beckman spectrophotometer. The activity of glutathione peroxidase was estimated using the method of Little and O'Brien at 412 nm on the Beckman spectrophotometer. The research was conducted with the permit of the Bioethics Committee No RNN/260/08/KB dated 20.05.2008. Blood for the tests was taken from periulnar vein to anticoagulant tubes (EDTA). The group consisted of 25 patients hospitalized in the Trauma and Orthopaedic Ward of the Hospital in ≈?√≥d≈∫. RESULTS: The results of the tests on erythrocytes in the patients with physical limitations reveal the increase of glutathione peroxidase and catalase activity by about 50% in all patients, who were administered the dichlorobis (N1-dichloromethyl-3,5-dimethylpyrazole, copper (II) compound in comparison to the control group, where the foregoing compound was not used. CONCLUSION: The research results significantly emphasise that adding of new chemical compounds to blood in investigation of oxidative properties has a considerable influence on the activity of the selected enzymes (catalase and glutathione peroxidase) in comparison to the control group. The research reveals an increase of the activity of all antioxidant enzymes, where newly synthesized chemical compounds were used. The results of antioxidative capacity tests confirmed that complex compounds with Cu (II) ions have a significant influence on the antioxidative status. The studies on the foregoing enzymes also indicate that overproduced free radicals participate in the whole course of the coxarthrosis.",M1

In the present investigation erythrocytes obtained from healthy volunteers were loaded with prednisolone using preswell dilution and dilution technique with two different cross-linking agents, glutaraldehyde and dimethylsulphoxide. Carrier erythrocytes, having acceptable loading parameters showed increased percentage drug content with the addition of cross-linking agents. In vitro drug release followed zero-order kinetics, haemoglobin content was found to be satisfactory and osmotic fragility study indicated that increased drug entrapment efficiency was found at 0.3%w/v concentration of sodium chloride (hypotonic solution). In vivo tissue distribution studies were carried out for optimized formulation and order of distribution was found to be Liver&gt;Lung&gt;Kidney&gt; Spleen.

20357827,"Novel insight into stem cell mobilization-plasma sphingosine-1-phosphate is a major chemoattractant that directs the egress of hematopoietic stem progenitor cells from the bone marrow and its level in peripheral blood increases during mobilization due to activation of complement cascade/membrane attack complex.The complement cascade (CC) becomes activated and its cleavage fragments play a crucial role in the mobilization of hematopoietic stem/progenitor cells (HSPCs). Here, we sought to determine which major chemoattractant present in peripheral blood (PB) is responsible for the egress of HSPCs from the bone marrow (BM). We noticed that normal and mobilized plasma strongly chemoattracts HSPCs in a stromal-derived factor-1 (SDF-1)-independent manner because (i) plasma SDF-1 level does not correlate with mobilization efficiency; (ii) the chemotactic plasma gradient is not affected in the presence of AMD3100 and (iii) it is resistant to denaturation by heat. Surprisingly, the observed loss of plasma chemotactic activity after charcoal stripping suggested the involvement of bioactive lipids and we focused on sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), a known chemoattracant of HSPCs. We found that S1P (i) creates in plasma a continuously present gradient for BM-residing HSPCs; (ii) is at physiologically relevant concentrations a chemoattractant several magnitudes stronger than SDF-1 and (iii) its plasma level increases during mobilization due to CC activation and interaction of the membrane attack complex (MAC) with <e>erythrocytes</e> that are a major reservoir of S1P. We conclude and propose a new paradigm that S1P is a crucial chemoattractant for BM-residing HSPCs and that CC through MAC induces the release of S1P from erythrocytes for optimal egress/mobilization of HSPCs.",M1

20352451,"Furazolidone is a selective in vitro candidate against Leishmania (L.) chagasi: an ultrastructural study.The current treatment for leishmaniasis is unsatisfactory due to toxic side effects, high cost, and problems with drug resistance. Various approaches have been used to identify novel drug candidates to treat Leishmania sp. parasites including the use of re-purposed drugs. Furazolidone is a nitrofuran derivative with antiprotozoal and antibacterial activity and is used for the treatment of giardiasis. In the present work, we determined the in vitro antileishmanial activity of furazolidone and its ability to induce ultrastructural alterations of parasites. Promastigotes of Leishmania (L.) chagasi, Leishmania (V.) braziliensis, Leishmania (L.) major, and Leishmania (L.) amazonensis were highly susceptible to furazolidone, with IC(50) values ranging between 0.47 and 0.73 microg/mL. Furazolidone was also very effective against L. chagasi intracellular amastigotes, and despite mammalian cytotoxicity, the selectivity index was 8.0 in human monocytes. The drug also had limited toxicity in mice <e>erythrocytes</e>. Furazolidone demonstrated specific activity against Leishmania, a potential consequence of the lack of macrophage nitric oxide activation. As determined by electron transmission microscopy, drug treatment induced severe damage to the parasite mitochondria and nucleus. This older oral drug is an effective agent for the treatment of L.

20352203,"Nonneuronal cholinergic system in human <e>erythrocytes</e>: biological role and clinical relevance.Acetylcholine is well known in the medical setting as one of the most exemplary neurotransmitters. Its ubiquity in nature otherwise suggests a theoretically diverse spectrum of action and an extremely early appearance in the evolutionary process. In humans, acetylcholine and its synthesizing enzyme, choline acetyltransferase, have been found in various nonneural tissues such as the epithelium, mesothelium, endothelium, muscle, immune cells and blood cells. The widespread expression of nonneuronal acetylcholine is accompanied by the ubiquitous presence of acetylcholinesterase and nicotinic/muscarinic receptors. Structural and functional dissimilarities are evident between the nonneuronal and neuronal cholinergic systems. An increasing body of evidence throughout the last few years has placed acetylcholine as a major cellular signaling molecule in many pathways. Furthermore, numerous erythrocyte physiological events in the microcirculation are strongly regulated by acetylcholine. Thus, it is time to revise our understanding of the role of vascular acetylcholine in humans. Its biological and pathobiological roles must be evaluated in more detail to eventually achieve novel therapeutical targets. The present article reviews recent findings about nonneuronal acetylcholine in red blood cells, with special regard to (1) red cell rheology, (2) plasma ion concentrations, (3) nitric oxide intracellular translocation and metabolism and (4) band 3 protein phosphorylation.",M1

B. avium agglutinates guinea pig <e>erythrocytes</e> via an unknown mechanism. Loss of hemagglutination ability results in attenuation. We report the use of transposon mutagenesis to identify two genes required for hemagglutination. The genes (hagA and hagB) were adjacent and divergently oriented and had no orthologs in the genomes of other Bordetella species. Construction of in-frame, unmarked mutations in each gene allowed examination of the role of each in conferring erythrocyte agglutination, explanted tracheal cell adherence, and turkey poult tracheal colonization. In all of the in vitro and in vivo assays, the requirement for the trans-acting products of hagA and hagB (HagA and HagB) was readily shown. Western blotting, using antibodies to purified HagA and HagB, revealed proteins of the predicted sizes of HagA and HagB in an outer membrane-enriched fraction. Antiserum to HagB, but not HagA, blocked B. avium erythrocyte agglutination and explanted turkey tracheal ring binding. Bioinformatic analysis indicated the similarity of HagA and HagB to several two-component secretory apparatuses in which one product facilitates the exposition of the other. HagB has the potential to serve as a useful immunogen to protect turkeys against colonization and subsequent disease.",M1

However, the VHH active-site mutant has lost all hemolytic and phospholipase activities as well as pathogenicity. In this study, the effect of VHH on <e>erythrocytes</e> and a gill cell line from flounder was elucidated. Erythrocyte membranes formed thin tubular protrusions immediately after exposure to VHH, and membrane corrugations were evident after extended incubation. In contrast, the mutant VHH did not induce any gross morphological changes. With VHH-treated FG-9307 cells, a cell line derived from flounder gill, destruction of organelles and formation of features resembling apoptotic bodies were observed. Immunogold staining showed that a large amount of VHH was deposited on the membranes and membrane debris of erythrocytes and FG-9307 cells after treatment with VHH. Apoptotic features, such as chromatin condensation and apoptotic bodies, were observed in VHH-treated FG-9307 cells using DAPI staining. Moreover, cell cycle analysis showed that VHH increased the proportion of cells in G1 phase. In addition, VHH significantly increased the percentage of apoptosis, the number of TUNEL positive apoptotic cells, and caspase-3 activity in FG-9307 cells when compared with the untreated controls. These data suggested that VHH killed the cells through apoptosis via the caspase activation pathway.",M1
20350189,"Antibodies to chondroitin sulfate A-binding infected <e>erythrocytes</e>: dynamics and protection during pregnancy in women receiving intermittent preventive treatment.BACKGROUND: Plasmodium falciparum parasites that cause malaria in pregnancy express unique variant surface antigens (VSAs). Levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody to pregnancy-associated VSAs measured at delivery are gravidity dependent, and they have been associated with protection from disease. It is not known how these IgG responses develop in pregnant women receiving intermittent preventive treatment during pregnancy (IPTp) or whether IgG levels in early pregnancy predict pregnancy outcomes. METHODS: We performed longitudinal measurements of IgG antibody to VSAs by flow cytometric analysis of serum samples obtained from 549 Malawian women receiving IPTp. We examined fluctuations in IgG levels over time and associated the IgG levels noted at study enrollment with clinical outcomes. RESULTS: Levels of IgG antibody to pregnancy-associated VSAs were gravidity dependent. Overall, levels decreased while women were receiving IPTp, but the levels of the individuals were highly dynamic. Primigravidae developed low levels of pregnancy-specific IgG, which were often boosted during second pregnancies. The prevalence of parasites was low (8.4% at enrollment and 2.4% in late pregnancy). Antibody levels at enrollment did not predict birth weight, duration of gestation at delivery, or the maternal hemoglobin level in late pregnancy. CONCLUSION: Levels of IgG antibody to pregnancy-specific VSAs decrease during receipt of IPTp. Antibody levels in early pregnancy did not predict clinical outcome. IPTp and decreasing malaria prevalence pose challenges for the evaluation of novel interventions for malaria during pregnancy.",M1
20349311,"The DraC usher in Dr fimbriae biogenesis of uropathogenic E. coli Dr(+) strains.Biogenesis of Dr fimbriae encoded by the dra gene cluster of uropathogenic Escherichia coli strains requires the chaperone-usher pathway. This secretion system is based on two non-structural assembly components, the DraB periplasmic chaperone and DraC outer-membrane usher. The DraB controls the folding of DraE subunits, and DraC forms the assembly and secretion platform for polymerization of subunits in linear fibers. In this study, mutagenesis of the DraC N-terminus was undertaken to select residues critical for Dr fimbriae bioassembly. The DraC-F4A, DraC-C64, DraC-C100A and DraC-W142A significantly reduced the adhesive ability of E. coli strains. The biological activity of the DraC mutants as a assembly platform for Dr fimbriae polymerization was verified by agglutination of human <e>erythrocytes</e> and adhesion to DAF localized at the surface of CHO-DAF(+) and HeLa cells. The residue F4 of the DraC usher conserved among FGL and FGS chaperone-assembled adhesive organelles can be used to design pillicides blocking the biogenesis of Dr fimbriae. Because the draC and afaC-III genes share 100% identity the range of the virulence determinant inhibitors could also be extended to E. coli strains encoding afa-3 gene cluster. The investigations performed showed that the usher N-terminus plays an important role in biogenesis of complete fiber.",M1
20348403,"Quantification of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase enzyme activity by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.BACKGROUND: The diagnosis of galactosemia usually involves the measurement of galactose-1-phosphate uridyltransferase (GALT) activity. Traditional radioactive and fluorescent GALT assays are nonspecific, laborious, and/or lack sufficient analytical sensitivity. We developed a liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based assay for GALT enzyme activity measurement. METHOD: Our assay used stable isotope-labeled alpha- galactose-1-phosphate ([(13)C(6)]-Gal-1-P) as an enzyme substrate. Sample cleanup and separation were achieved by reversed-phase ion-pair chromatography, and the enzymatic product, isotope-labeled uridine diphosphate galactose ([(13)C(6)]-UDPGal), was detected by MS/MS at mass transition (571 &gt; 323) and quantified by use of [(13)C(6)]-Glu-1-P (265 &gt; 79) as an internal standard. RESULTS: The method yielded a mean (SD) GALT enzyme activity of 23.8 (3.8) mumol x (g Hgb)(-1) x h(-1) in erythrocyte extracts from 71 controls. The limit of quantification was 0.04 micromol x (g Hgb)(-1) x h(-1) (0.2% of normal control value). Intraassay imprecision was determined at 4 different levels (100%, 25%, 5%, and 0.2% of the normal control values), and the CVs were calculated to be 2.1%, 2.5%, 4.6%, and 9.7%, respectively (n = 3). Interassay imprecision CVs were 4.5%, 6.7%, 8.2%, and 13.2% (n = 5), respectively. The assay recoveries at the 4 levels were higher than 90%. The apparent K(m) of the 2 substrates, Gal-1-P and UDPGlc, were determined to be 0.38 mmol/L and 0.071 mmol/L, respectively. The assay in <e>erythrocytes</e> of 33 patients with classical galactosemia revealed no detectable activity. CONCLUSIONS: This LC-MS/MS-based assay for GALT enzyme activity will be useful for the diagnosis and study of biochemically heterogeneous patients with galactosemia, especially those with uncommon genotypes and detectable but low residual activities.",M1

A number of different agglutination patterns, and hence CD46 interactions, could be observed for the different adenovirus types. In this system Ad7p, Ad11a, and Ad14 did not agglutinate mouse erythrocytes at all. Hemagglutination of CD46 expressing erythrocytes with high efficiency was observed for the previously established CD46 users Ad11p and Ad35 as well as for the less investigated Ad34.

20339944,"The state of <e>erythrocytes</e> in intact and vagotomized rats of different ages after massive hemorrhage.Acute massive hemorrhage in rats is accompanied by consistent changes in the morphofunctional characteristics of erythrocytes: diameter, area, polarization, form factor, and integral and specific optical density. Thus, young initially intact rats showed significant increases in the mean diameter, area, and integral optical density at particular time points after hemorrhage, along with increases in erythrocyte polarization and form factor. Vagotomized rats of the same age group responded to hemorrhage only with an increase in the form factor. Initially intact aged rats in these conditions showed increases in the integral optical density and form factor. Aged vagotomized rats showed increases in erythrocyte mean diameter and area. The nature and dynamics of responses to hemorrhage in initially intact and vagotomized (14 days post-operative) animals were significantly different and had age-dependent features. Thus, the most marked changes in young initially intact animals were seen 3-10 h after hemorrhage, while maximum changes were seen at 3 and 96 h in vagotomized animals of the same age. In aged initially intact rats, the greatest changes in study parameters were seen at 3 and 96 h, while the greatest changes were seen in vagotomized rats at 3 and 24 h.

20338776,"UVA/UVB-induced genotoxicity and lesion repair in Colossoma macropomum and Arapaima gigas Amazonian fish.Ultraviolet radiation is known to cause adverse effects to aquatic species and aquatic environments. The fish Colossoma macropomum (tambaqui) and Arapaima gigas (pirarucu) live in the Amazon basin, near the Equator, and thus receive high intensity of ultraviolet radiation. Deforestation further aggravates the situation by reducing shade at ground level. The aim of this study was to evaluate the genotoxic effects of UVA and UVB radiation on <e>erythrocytes</e> of tambaqui and pirarucu fish using Micronuclei test and Comet assay. Our study showed that UV radiation caused DNA damage in both species as detected by Comet assay. In addition, there were differences in response to genotoxicity between both species, which are possibly related to their evolutionary history. Tambaqui fish exposed to ultraviolet radiation for different periods presented clear dose-response in DNA damage profile. Significant damage repair was observed 24h after cessation of ultraviolet radiation exposure. At the test conditions used, no significant increase in micronucleated cells was observed in tambaqui and pirarucu fish. Tambaqui proved to be more sensitive to ultraviolet radiation than Pirarucu, as detected by Comet assay, showing statistically higher baseline DNA damage. The present results demonstrated that alkaline Comet assay was very sensitive for detecting the UV-induced genotoxicity during the short exposure period in our study. In addition, the present study also suggests that tambaqui and pirarucu fish are useful sentinel organisms, as their UV sensitivity allows them to be effective monitors of biological hazards in the Amazon region.",M1
20332090,"An acid-loading chloride transport pathway in the intraerythrocytic malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum.The intraerythrocytic malaria parasite exerts tight control over its ionic composition.

Removal of extracellular Cl(-), resulting in an outward [Cl(-)] gradient, gave rise to a cytosolic alkalinization (i.e. a net efflux of H(+)-equivalents). This was reversed on restoration of extracellular Cl(-). The flux of H(+)-equivalents was inhibited by 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid and, when measured in ATP-depleted parasites, showed a pronounced dependence on the pH of the parasite cytosol; the flux was low at cytosolic pH values &lt; 7.2 but increased steeply with cytosolic pH at values &gt; 7.2. (36)Cl(-) influx measurements revealed the presence of a Cl(-) uptake mechanism with characteristics similar to those of the Cl(-)-dependent H(+)-equivalent flux. The intracellular concentration of Cl(-) in the parasite was estimated to be approximately 48 mm in situ. The data are consistent with the intraerythrocytic parasite having in its plasma membrane a 4,4'-diisothiocyanostilbene-2,2'-disulfonic acid-sensitive transporter that, under physiological conditions, imports Cl(-) together with H(+)-equivalents, resulting in an intracellular Cl(-) concentration well above that which would occur if Cl(-) ions were distributed passively in accordance with the parasite's large, inwardly negative membrane potential.",M1
20299679,"Multiplex enzyme assay for galactosemia using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.BACKGROUND: Galactosemia is one of the most important inherited disorders detected by newborn screening tests. Abnormal results in screening tests should be confirmed by enzyme activity assays, but existing methods are time and labor intensive. We developed a novel multiplex enzyme assay for galactosemia using ultraperformance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS). METHODS: [(13)C6]-galactose, [(13)C2]-galactose-1-phosphate, and UDP-glucose were used as substrates for 3 galactose-metabolizing enzymes. The end products from the combined reaction mixtures, [(13)C6]-galactose-1-phosphate, UDP-[(13)C2]-galactose, and UDP-galactose, were simultaneously measured using UPLC-MS/MS. Linearity, imprecision, ion suppression, and the effects of substrate were evaluated to determine assay performance. Enzyme activities from 35 healthy individuals, 8 patients with enzyme deficiency, and 18 mutant cells were analyzed. RESULTS: Substrates, products, and internal standards from the mixture of 3 enzyme reactions were clearly separated by using UPLC-MS/MS, with an injection cycle time of 10 min. Ion suppression was 0.1%-2.5%, the interassay imprecision of UPLC-MS/MS was 3.3%-10.6% CV, and the linearity of each system was good (R(2) = 0.994-0.999).

20298742,"A novel fluorescent-based assay reveals that thrombopoietin signaling and Bcl-X(L) influence, respectively, platelet and erythrocyte lifespans.OBJECTIVE: The factors determining platelet and erythrocyte lifespan are not completely understood, despite extensive study. The lack of success may be attributed to the methods used to measure lifespan kinetics, all of which require processing of cells prior to analysis, and the inconsistent and potentially inappropriate use of mathematical models for data analysis. The aims of this study were to establish an in vivo platelet and erythrocyte labeling method using carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl ester (CFSE), determine the most appropriate mathematical model for lifespan analysis, and apply both to the study of factors that control platelet and erythrocyte lifespans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Control, c-mpl knockout (KO), and Bcl-X(L) mutant mice were injected with CFSE and platelet and erythrocyte fluorescence followed over time. Datasets were analyzed using linear, exponential, multiple-hit, and lognormal mathematical models. RESULTS: In vivo CFSE labeling of platelets and <e>erythrocytes</e> requires no postcollection processing, proved stable, nontoxic, nonimmunogenic, and the lifespans were highly reproducible. Mathematical modeling revealed the lognormal model gave a robust fit to control and extreme datasets when either extrinsic or intrinsic factors determined lifespan. Using these methods, platelet lifespans were found to be significantly shortened in thrombopoietin-receptor-deficient mice independent of blood loss, and the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-X(L) was shown to play a role in prolonging erythrocyte lifespans. CONCLUSIONS: The simultaneous study of platelet and erythrocyte lifespans using in vivo CFSE labeling with lognormal modeling yielded insight into common intrinsic and extrinsic platelet and erythrocyte lifespan determinants and provides an improved methodology for use in this field of research.",M1

P. vivax is endemic in Madagascar, where admixture of Duffy-negative and Duffy-positive populations of diverse ethnic backgrounds has occurred over 2 millennia. There, we investigated susceptibility to P. vivax blood-stage infection and disease in association with Duffy blood group polymorphism. Duffy blood group genotyping identified 72% Duffy-negative individuals (FY*B(ES)/*B(ES)) in community surveys conducted at eight sentinel sites. Flow cytometry and adsorption-elution results confirmed the absence of Duffy antigen expression on Duffy-negative <e>erythrocytes</e>.

Microscopy examination of blood smears confirmed blood-stage development of P. vivax, including gametocytes. Genotyping of polymorphic surface and microsatellite markers suggested that multiple P. vivax strains were infecting Duffy-negative people.

The Ca(2+)-activated K(+) channel K(Ca)3.1 (or Gardos channel) is essential for the initial shrinkage, because both clotrimazole and TRAM-34 prevent the shrinkage and potentiate hemolysis produced by HlyA. Notably, the recently described Ca(2+)-activated Cl(-) channel TMEM16A contributes substantially to HlyA-induced cell volume reduction. Erythrocytes isolated from TMEM16A(-/-) mice showed significantly attenuated crenation and increased lysis compared with controls. Additionally, we found that HlyA leads to acute exposure of phosphatidylserine in the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane. This exposure was considerably reduced by K(Ca)3.1 antagonists. In conclusion, this study shows that HlyA triggers acute erythrocyte shrinkage, which depends on Ca(2+)-activated efflux of K(+) via K(Ca)3.1 and Cl(-) via TMEM16A, with subsequent phosphatidylserine exposure. This mechanism might potentially allow HlyA-damaged erythrocytes to be removed from the bloodstream by macrophages and thereby reduce the risk of intravascular hemolysis.",M1
20220119,"Interactions with heparin-like molecules during erythrocyte invasion by Plasmodium falciparum merozoites.During erythrocyte invasion, Plasmodium falciparum merozoites use multiple receptor-ligand interactions in a series of coordinated events, but current knowledge of these interactions is limited. Using real-time imaging of invasion, we established that heparin-like molecules block early, and essential, events in erythrocyte invasion by merozoites. All P falciparum isolates tested, and parasites using different invasion pathways were inhibited to comparable levels. Furthermore, it was not possible to select for heparin-resistant parasites. Heparin-like molecules occur naturally on the surface of human <e>erythrocytes</e>, where they may act as receptors for binding of merozoite surface proteins. Consistent with this, we demonstrated that MSP1-42, a processed form of merozoite surface protein 1 (MSP1) involved in invasion, bound heparin in a specific manner; furthermore, binding was observed with the secondary processing fragment MSP1-33, but not MSP1-19. We defined key structural requirements of heparin-like molecules for invasion inhibition and interactions with MSP1-42. Optimal activity required a degree of sulfation more than or equal to 2, disulfation of the N-acetylglucosamine or hexuronic acid residue, and a minimum chain length of 6 monosaccharides. These findings have significant implications for understanding P falciparum invasion of erythrocytes and the development of novel therapeutics and vaccines.",M1
20217236,"Docosahexaenoic acid status in females of reproductive age with maple syrup urine disease.Individuals with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) have impaired metabolism of branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) valine, isoleucine, and leucine. Life-long dietary therapy is recommended to restrict BCAA intake and thus prevent poor neurological outcomes and death. To maintain adequate nutritional status, the majority of protein and nutrients are derived from synthetic BCAA-free medical foods with variable fatty acid content. Given the restrictive diet and the importance of omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), in neurological development, this study evaluated the dietary and fatty acid status of females of reproductive age with MSUD attending a metabolic camp. Healthy controls of similar age and sex were selected from existing normal laboratory data. Total lipid fatty acid concentration in plasma and <e>erythrocytes</e> was analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectroscopy. Participants with MSUD had normal to increased concentrations of plasma and erythrocyte alpha linolenic acid (ALA) but significantly lower concentrations of plasma and erythrocyte docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) as percent of total lipid fatty acids compared with controls (plasma DHA: MSUD 1.03 +/- 0.35, controls 2.87 +/- 1.08; P = 0.001; erythrocyte DHA: MSUD 2.58 +/- 0.58, controls 3.66 +/- 0.80; P = 0.011). Dietary records reflected negligible or no DHA intake over the 3-day period prior to the blood draw (range 0-2 mg). These results suggest females of reproductive age with MSUD have lower blood DHA concentrations than age-matched controls. In addition, the presence of ALA in medical foods and the background diet may not counter the lack of preformed DHA in the diet. The implications of these results warrant further investigation.",M1
20217154,"Trypsin-induced hemagglutination activity of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus.The hemagglutination (HA) activity of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) was investigated. Two cell-adapted strains of PEDV (KPEDV-9 and SM98LVec) were subjected to HA test against <e>erythrocytes</e> of various origin. Both strains showed HA activity with rabbit erythrocytes only after treatment with trypsin or neuraminidase. Optimal conditions for inducing HA activity of PEDV were 2 h incubation at 37 degrees C using phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% BSA. These results suggest that the HA activity of PEDV is most likely caused by proteolytic action on it, which could be developed as a new diagnostic method to rapidly detect and differentiate PEDV infections from other enteric diseases.",M1
20204779,"T-state stabilization of hemoglobin by nitric oxide to form alpha-nitrosyl heme causes constitutive release of ATP from human <e>erythrocytes</e>.Upon hypoxia, erythrocytes utilize hemoglobin (Hb) to trigger activation of glycolysis through its interaction with band 3. This process contributes to maintenance of ATP, a portion of which is released extracellularly to trigger endothelium-dependent vasorelaxation. However, whether the ATP release results either from metabolic activation of the cells secondarily or from direct regulation of the gating through Hb allostery remains unknown. This study aimed to examine if stabilization of T-state Hb could induce steady-state and hypoxia-induced alterations in glycolysis and the ATP release from erythrocytes. Treatment of deoxygenated erythrocytes with a nitric oxide (NO) donor generated alpha-NO Hb that is stabilized T-state allostery. Under these circumstances, the release of ATP was significantly elevated even under normoxia and not further enhanced upon hypoxia. These events did not coincide with activation of glycolysis of the cells, so far as judged by the fact that intracellular ATP was significantly decreased by the NO treatment. Collectively, the present study suggests that hypoxia-induced ATP release is triggered through mechanisms involving R-T transition of Hb, and the gating process might occur irrespective of hypoxia-responsive regulation of glycolysis.",M1
20202081,"Hemopressins and other hemoglobin-derived peptides in mouse brain: comparison between brain, blood, and heart peptidome and regulation in Cpefat/fat mice.Many hemoglobin-derived peptides are present in mouse brain, and several of these have bioactive properties including the hemopressins, a related series of peptides that bind to cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Although hemoglobin is a major component of red blood cells, it is also present in neurons and glia. To examine whether the hemoglobin-derived peptides in brain are similar to those present in blood and heart, we used a peptidomics approach involving mass spectrometry. Many hemoglobin-derived peptides are found only in brain and not in blood, whereas all hemoglobin-derived peptides found in heart were also seen in blood. Thus, it is likely that the majority of the hemoglobin-derived peptides detected in brain are produced from brain hemoglobin and not <e>erythrocytes</e>. We also examined if the hemopressins and other major hemoglobin-derived peptides were regulated in the Cpe(fat/fat) mouse; previously these mice were reported to have elevated levels of several hemoglobin-derived peptides. Many, but not all of the hemoglobin-derived peptides were elevated in several brain regions of the Cpe(fat/fat) mouse. Taken together, these findings suggest that the post-translational processing of alpha and beta hemoglobin into the hemopressins, as well as other peptides, is up-regulated in some but not all Cpe(fat/fat) mouse brain regions.",M1

20196166,"A flow cytometry-based assay for measuring invasion of red blood cells by Plasmodium falciparum.Variability in the ability of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to invade human <e>erythrocytes</e> is postulated to be an important determinant of disease severity. Both the parasite multiplication rate and erythrocyte selectivity are important parameters that underlie such variable invasion. We have established a flow cytometry-based method for simultaneously calculating both the parasitemia and the number of multiply-infected erythrocytes. Staining with the DNA-specific dye SYBR Green I allows quantitation of parasite invasion at the ring stage of parasite development. We discuss in vitro and in vivo applications and limitations of this method in relation to the study of parasite invasion.",M1
20194779,"Full-length extracellular region of the var2CSA variant of PfEMP1 is required for specific, high-affinity binding to CSA.Pregnancy-associated malaria (PAM) is a serious consequence of sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-parasitized <e>erythrocytes</e> (PE) in the placenta through adhesion to chondroitin sulfate A (CSA) present on placental proteoglycans. Recent work implicates var2CSA, a member of the PfEMP1 family, as the mediator of placental sequestration and as a key target for PAM vaccine development. Var2CSA is a 350 kDa transmembrane protein, whose extracellular region includes six Duffy-binding-like (DBL) domains. Due to its size and high cysteine content, the full-length var2CSA extracellular region has not hitherto been expressed in heterologous systems, thus limiting investigations to individual recombinant domains. Here we report for the first time the expression of the full-length var2CSA extracellular region (domains DBL1X to DBL6epsilon) from the 3D7 parasite strain using the human embryonic kidney 293 cell line. We show that the recombinant extracellular var2CSA region is correctly folded and that, unlike the individual DBL domains, it binds with high affinity and specificity to CSA (K(D) = 61 nM) and efficiently inhibits PE from binding to CSA. Structural characterization by analytical ultracentrifugation and small-angle x-ray scattering reveals a compact organization of the full-length protein, most likely governed by specific interdomain interactions, rather than an extended structure. Collectively, these data suggest that a high-affinity, CSA-specific binding site is formed by the higher-order structure of the var2CSA extracellular region. These results have important consequences for the development of an effective vaccine and therapeutic inhibitors.",M1
20194590,"Immunization with VAR2CSA-DBL5 recombinant protein elicits broadly cross-reactive antibodies to placental Plasmodium falciparum-infected <e>erythrocytes</e>.Pregnancy-associated malaria is a severe clinical syndrome associated with the sequestration of Plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes in the placenta. Placental binding is mediated by VAR2CSA, a member of the large and diverse P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane 1 (PfEMP1) protein family. To better understand if conserved regions in VAR2CSA can be targeted by antibodies, we immunized rabbits with VAR2CSA-DBL1 and -DBL5 recombinant proteins produced in Pichia pastoris and developed a panel of seven chondroitin sulfate A (CSA)-binding parasites from diverse geographic origins. Overall, no two parasites in the panel expressed the same VAR2CSA sequence. The DBL1 domains averaged 80% amino acid identity (range, 72 to 89%), and the DBL5 domains averaged 86% amino acid identity (range, 83 to 99%), similar to a broader sampling of VAR2CSA sequences from around the world. Whereas antibodies generated against the VAR2CSA-DBL1 recombinant protein had only limited breadth and reacted with three or four parasites in the panel, immunization with DBL5 recombinant proteins elicited broadly cross-reactive antibodies against all or most parasites in the panel, as well as to fresh clinical isolates from pregnant women. These findings demonstrate that the major PfEMP1 variant expressed by placental isolates exposes strain-transcendent epitopes that can be targeted by vaccination and may have application for pregnancy malaria vaccine development.",M1
20193084,"Dual effect of Plasmodium-infected <e>erythrocytes</e> on dendritic cell maturation.BACKGROUND: Infection with Plasmodium is the cause of malaria, a disease characterized by a high inflammatory response in the blood. Dendritic cells (DC) participate in both adaptive and innate immune responses, influencing the generation of inflammatory responses. DC can be activated through different receptors, which recognize specific molecules in microbes and induce the maturation of DC. METHODS: Using Plasmodium yoelii, a rodent malaria model, the effect of Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes on DC maturation and TLR responses have been analysed. RESULTS: It was found that intact erythrocytes infected with P. yoelii do not induce maturation of DC unless they are lysed, suggesting that accessibility of parasite inflammatory molecules to their receptors is a key issue in the activation of DC by P. yoelii. This activation is independent of MyD88. It was also observed that pre-incubation of DC with intact P. yoelii-infected erythrocytes inhibits the maturation response of DC to other TLR stimuli. The inhibition of maturation of DC is reversible, parasite-specific and increases with the stage of parasite development, with complete inhibition induced by schizonts (mature infected erythrocytes). Plasmodium yoelii-infected erythrocytes induce a broad inhibitory effect rendering DC non-responsive to ligands for TLR2, TLR3, TLR4, TLR5, TLR7 and TLR9. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the presence of inflammatory molecules within Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes, which are probably responsible for DC maturation induced by lysates, intact Plasmodium-infected erythrocytes induce a general inhibition of TLR responsiveness in DC. The observed effect on DC could play an important role in the pathology and suboptimal immune response observed during the disease. These results help to explain why immune functions are altered during malaria, and provide a system for the identification of a parasite-derived broad inhibitor of TLR-mediated signaling pathways.",M1
20186882,"<e>Erythrocytes</e> serve as a reservoir for cellular and extracellular sphingosine 1-phosphate.Sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P) in blood is phosphorylated, stored, and transported by red blood cells (RBC). Release of S1P from RBC into plasma is a regulated process that does not occur in plasma- or serum-free media. Plasma fractionation and incubations with isolated and recombinant proteins identified high density lipoprotein (HDL) and serum albumin (SA) as non-redundant endogenous triggers for S1P release from RBC. S1P bound to SA and HDL was able to stimulate the S1P(1) receptor in calcium flux experiments. The binding capability of acceptor molecules triggers S1P release, as demonstrated with the anti-S1P antibody Sphingomab. More S1P was extracted from RBC membranes by HDL than by SA. Blood samples from anemic patients confirmed a reduced capacity for S1P release in plasma. In co-cultures of RBC and endothelial cells (EC), we observed transcellular transportation of S1P as a second function of RBC-associated S1P in the absence of SA and HDL and during tight RBC-EC contact, mimicking conditions in tissue interstitium and capillaries. In contrast to S1P bound to SA and HDL, RBC-associated S1P was significantly incorporated by EC after S1P lyase (SGPL1) inhibition. RBC-associated S1P, therefore, has two functions: (1) It contributes to the cellular pool of SGPL1-sensitive S1P in tissues after transcellular transportation and (2) it helps maintain extracellular S1P levels via SA and HDL independently from SGPL1 activity.",M1

20178688,"pH-dependent disruption of erythrocyte membrane by amphiphilic poly(amino acid) nanoparticles.The efficient cytoplasmic delivery of therapeutic agents is especially important for the induction of a maximal therapeutic effect. Previously, we reported that 200-nm-sized nanoparticles composed of hydrophobically-modified poly(gamma-glutamic acid) (gamma-PGA) showed great potential as protein carriers. Moreover, protein-encapsulated hydrophobic gamma-PGA (gamma-hPGA) nanoparticles efficiently delivered loaded proteins from the endosomes to the cytoplasm in dendritic cells, but the mechanism of the nanoparticle translocation into the cytoplasm remains to be elucidated. In this study, we examined how polymer composition, hydrophobic modification, size, conformation and surface properties of the amphiphilic nanoparticles are related to functional membrane-disruptive activities. To evaluate their potential applications as membrane-disruptive nanoparticles, the nanoparticles were characterized with respect to their hemolytic activity against <e>erythrocytes</e> as a function of pH. The pH-dependent conformation changes of the nanoparticles were studied by Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. The gamma-hPGA nanoparticles showed hemolytic activity with decreasing pH from 7 to 5.5, and were membrane-inactive at physiological pH. This activity was dependent on the hydrophobicity of gamma-PGA. The mechanism responsible for the pH-dependent hemolysis by the nanoparticles involved a conformational change of gamma-hPGA and corresponding increase in the surface hydrophobicity. We conclude that gamma-hPGA nanoparticles have significant potential as membrane-disruptive carriers. These results have important implications for the design of endosome-disruptive nanoparticles as drug, protein and DNA delivery systems.",M1
20178367,"Characterization of the colchicine binding site on avian tubulin isotype betaVI.Tubulin, the basic component of microtubules, is present in most eukaryotic cells as multiple gene products, called isotypes. The major tubulin isotypes are highly conserved in terms of structure and drug binding capabilities. Tubulin isotype betaVI, however, is significantly divergent from the other isotypes in sequence, assembly properties, and function. It is the major beta-tubulin isotype of hematopoietic tissue and forms the microtubules of platelet marginal bands. The interaction of the major tubulin isotypes betaI, betaII, betaIII, and betaIotaV with antimicrotubule drugs has been widely studied, but little is known about the drug binding properties of tubulin isotype betaVI. In this investigation, we characterize the activity of various colchicine site ligands with tubulin isolated from Gallus gallus <e>erythrocytes</e> (CeTb), which is approximately 95% betaVI. Colchicine binding is thought to be a universal property of higher eukaryotic tubulin; however, we were unable to detect colchicine binding to CeTb under any experimental conditions. Podophyllotoxin and nocodazole, other colchicine site ligands with divergent structures, were able to inhibit paclitaxel-induced CeTb assembly. Surprisingly, the colchicine isomer allocolchicine also inhibited CeTb assembly and displayed measurable, moderate affinity for CeTb (K(a) = 0.18 x 10(5) M(-1) vs 5.0 x 10(5) M(-1) for bovine brain tubulin). Since allocolchicine and colchicine differ in their C ring structures, the two C ring colchicine analogues were also tested for CeTb binding. Kinetic experiments indicate that thiocolchicine and chlorocolchicine bind to CeTb, but very slowly and with low affinity. Molecular modeling of CeTb identified five divergent amino acid residues within 6 A of the colchicine binding site compared to betaI, betaII, and betaIV; three of these amino acids are also altered in betaIII-tubulin. Interestingly, the altered amino acids are in the vicinity of the A ring region of the colchicine binding site rather than the C ring region. We propose that the amino acid differences in the binding site constrict the A ring binding domain in CeTb, which interferes with the positioning of the trimethoxyphenyl A ring and prevents C ring binding site interactions from efficiently occurring. Allocolchicine is able to accommodate the altered binding mode because of its smaller ring size and more flexible C ring substituents. The sequence of the colchicine binding domain of CeTb isotype betaVI is almost identical to that of its human hematopoietic counterpart. Thus, through analysis of the interactions of ligands with CeTb, it may be possible to discover colchicine site ligands that specifically target tubulin in human hematopoietic cells.",M1

20166881,"Reassessment of antioxidant activity of arbutin: multifaceted evaluation using five antioxidant assay systems.Arbutin, a practically used skin-lightening agent, has been reported to possess a weak antioxidant activity compared to that of its precursor, hydroquinone. However, its antioxidant activity has not been systematically evaluated. Hence, this study reassessed its activity using five assay systems. Assays were first performed using model radicals, DPPH radical and ABTS(*+). Arbutin showed weak DPPH radical-scavenging activity compared to that of hydroquinone, but showed strong ABTS(*+)-scavenging activity. Its activity by ORAC assay was then evaluated using a physiologically relevant peroxyl radical. Arbutin exerted weak but long-lasting radical-scavenging activity and showed totally the same antioxidant activity as that of hydroquinone. Finally, it was shown that, in two cell-based antioxidant assays using <e>erythrocytes</e> and skin fibroblasts, arbutin exerted strong antioxidant activity comparable or even superior to that of hydroquinone. These findings indicate that the antioxidant activity of arbutin may have been under-estimated and suggest that it acts as a potent antioxidant in the skin.",M1

20164298,"A naphthoquinone derivative can induce anemia through phosphatidylserine exposure-mediated erythrophagocytosis.A naphthoquinone derivative, beta-lapachone (betaL; 3,4-dihydro-2,2-dimethyl-2H-naphthol[1,2-b]pyran-5,6-dione), is receiving huge attention for its potent therapeutic effects against various diseases. However, during the preclinical safety evaluation, repeated oral treatment of betaL in rats induced anemia, i.e., a significantly decreased erythrocyte count. In this study, in an effort to elucidate the mechanism underlying the betaL-induced anemia, we investigated the effects of betaL on <e>erythrocytes</e> with freshly isolated human erythrocytes in vitro and rat in vivo. betaL did not induce erythrocyte hemolysis, indicating that direct hemotoxicity was not involved in betaL-associated anemia. Meanwhile, phosphatidylserine (PS) exposure along with spherocytic shape change and microvesicle generation, important factors in the facilitation of erythrophagocytosis, were increased significantly by betaL. The PS exposure on erythrocytes was from betaL-induced reactive oxygen species generation and subsequent depletion of reduced glutathione and protein thiol, which culminated in the modified activities of phospholipid translocases, i.e., inhibition of flippase and activation of scramblase. It is important to note that coincubation of macrophage with betaL-treated erythrocyte in vitro showed increased erythrophagocytosis, demonstrating that the removal of erythrocyte by macrophage can be facilitated by betaL-induced PS exposure. In good accordance with these in vitro results, after oral administration of betaL in rats, increased PS exposure and depletion of glutathione were observed along with enhanced splenic sequestration of erythrocytes. In conclusion, these results suggest that betaL-induced anemia might be mediated through the PS exposure and subsequent erythrophagocytosis, providing novel insight into the drug-induced anemia.",M1
20161728,"Transcriptional changes in Schistosoma mansoni during early schistosomula development and in the presence of <e>erythrocytes</e>.BACKGROUND: Schistosomes cause more mortality and morbidity than any other human helminth, but control primarily relies on a single drug that kills adult worms. The newly transformed schistosomulum stage is susceptible to the immune response and is a target for vaccine development and rational drug design. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify genes which are up-regulated during the maturation of Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula in vitro, we cultured newly transformed parasites for 3 h or 5 days with and without erythrocytes and compared their transcriptional profiles using cDNA microarrays. The most apparent changes were in the up-regulation of genes between 3 h and 5 day schistosomula involved in blood feeding, tegument and cytoskeletal development, cell adhesion, and stress responses. The most highly up-regulated genes included a tegument tetraspanin Sm-tsp-3 (1,600-fold up-regulation), a protein kinase, a novel serine protease and serine protease inhibitor, and intestinal proteases belonging to distinct mechanistic classes. The inclusion of erythrocytes in the culture medium resulted in a general but less pronounced increase in transcriptional activity, with the highest up-regulation of genes involved in iron metabolism, proteolysis, and transport of fatty acids and sugars. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the genes that are up-regulated during the first 5 days of schistosomula development in vitro. Using a combination of gene silencing techniques and murine protection studies, some of these highly up-regulated transcripts can be targeted for future development of new vaccines and drugs.",M1
20156534,"Comparative study of oxime-induced reactivation of erythrocyte and muscle AChE from different animal species following inhibition by sarin or paraoxon.Standard treatment of acute poisoning by organophosphorus compounds (OP) includes administration of an antimuscarinic (e.g. atropine) and of an oxime-based reactivator of OP-inhibited acetylcholinesterase (AChE). A recently introduced dynamically working in vitro model with real-time determination of membrane-bound AChE activity was shown to be a very versatile and promising model to investigate oxime-induced reactivation kinetics of OP-inhibited enzyme. In this assay, human AChE from <e>erythrocytes</e> or muscle tissue was immobilized on a particle filter. This bioreactor was continuously perfused with substrate and chromogen and AChE activity was analyzed on-line in a flow-through detector. The model has been successfully adopted to Rhesus monkey, swine and guinea pig erythrocytes and intercostal muscle AChE. In addition, the basic kinetic constants of inhibition, aging, spontaneous- and oxime-induced-reactivation of erythrocyte AChE from these species were determined with a standard static model. The major findings were, in part substantial species differences in the inhibition (sarin, paraoxon) and reactivation kinetics (obidoxime, HI 6) of erythrocyte AChE, but comparable kinetics of inhibition and reactivation between erythrocyte and muscle AChE. Hence, these data provide further support of the assumption that erythrocyte AChE is an adequate surrogate of muscle (synaptic) AChE and admonish that major species differences have to be considered for the design and evaluation of therapeutic animal models.",M1
20153765,"Cytotoxic proteins of Amanita virosa Secr. mushroom: purification, characteristics and action towards mammalian cells.A new hemolytic lectin was purified from the fruit bodies of Amanita virosa Secr. mushroom by the affinity chromatography on the cross-linked ovomucin. This lectin destroyed <e>erythrocytes</e> of human and animals of various species, and its hemolytic activity decreased in the row: rabbit &gt; rat &gt; human &gt; dog. The erythrocytes of sheep, cow and carp were resistant to such hemolytic action of the lectin (1 mg/mL). The lectin-mediated hemolysis was blocked by the polyethylene glycol with molecular mass over 1350. A. virosa lectin, unlike Amanita phalloides lectin, did not interact with tested monosaccharides. However, the 4-nitrophenyl derivates of the monosaccharides inhibited the action of A. virosa lectin which did not prefer targeting O-type glycoproteins over the N-type glycoproteins. Murine leukemia cells of L1210 line and human leukemia T-cells of CEM T4 and Jurkat lines were shown to be sensitive to toxic effect of the lectin and another protein toxovirin isolated from A. virosa fruit bodies It was found that toxovirin possessed an enzymatic activity of L-amino acid oxidase. Since both toxic proteins--the lectin and toxovirin--are sensitive to an elevated temperature, it is suggested that they play a significant role in human poisoning only when the unbaked mushroom is eaten.",M1

We have evaluated oxidative stress induced by chronic mixed exposure to As, Cd, and Pb, as well as the influence of As metabolism and nutritional status, i.e., levels of ferritin (Ft), selenium (Se), zinc (Zn), and manganese (Mn) and body weight. 8-OxodG was measured in urine from 212 women in early pregnancy from Matlab, in rural Bangladesh, using LC-MS/MS.

Nevertheless, Pb is a serious public health issue as it is one of the most widespread environmental and industrial toxins. The aim of this investigation was to assess the genotoxicity of Pb using the comet assay, micronucleus (MN) and chromosomal aberrations (CA) test. Blood and urinary Pb content, levels of delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase in the <e>erythrocytes</e> (E-ALAD) and delta-aminolevulinic acid in urine (U-ALA) were determined. The exposure associated oxidative stress was also studied. The study group comprised of 90 male Pb recovery unit workers and 90 matched controls. The results indicated that the exposed workers had a significantly higher mean comet tail length than that of controls (P&lt;0.05). Analysis of micronuclei in buccal epithelial cells (BEC's) and peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) revealed that there was a significant increase in frequency of MN in exposed subjects than controls. The frequency of aberrant metaphases was also found to be significantly elevated in the Pb exposed workers. The levels of antioxidant enzymes were relatively reduced (P&gt;0.05) while the rate of lipid peroxidation was higher in the exposed subjects. Blood and urinary Pb concentrations were found to be higher in exposed workers than in controls. E-ALAD levels were reduced and U-ALA levels were elevated in the exposed subjects in comparison to controls. Results of analysis, taking the confounding factors into consideration provide evidence for the association of Pb exposure and genotoxicity, and predict the increased risk of cancer to the exposed workers. In view of the observed results, it can be strongly concluded that the workers comprise the risk group and adequate safety, precautionary and preventive measures could only minimize exposure and the related health hazards.",M1

It can be concluded that the dose level of 25 Gy can be considered a safe sterile dose; however, irradiation doses of 50 and 100 Gy should be applied with the addition of alpha-acid to preserve the cell viability.",M1
20152929,"Genotoxicity testing of sulfur dioxide (SO2) in a mouse bone marrow micronucleus test complemented with hematological endpoints.Sulfur dioxide (SO2) is a non-flammable, non-explosive, colorless gas. It is a ubiquitous environmental pollutant and an important chemical intermediate in several industrial processes. The toxicological properties of SO2, including its genotoxic potential, have been studied extensively. The majority of the available in vitro data indicate a lack of genotoxicity of SO2, while for sulfite salts some positive results have been reported. However, recent in vivo studies, using Kunming albino mice, have pointed to in vivo clastogenicity of SO2. To re-evaluate these positive findings, a bone-marrow micronucleus test according to OECD Guideline No. 474 was performed. NMRI mice (m/f) were exposed by inhalation via whole-body exposure to 0 (clean air), 2.7, 8, 27, or 80mg/m3 (0, 1, 3, 10, or 30ppm) SO2 for 4h/day on 7 consecutive days. Animals were sacrificed 24h after start of the last exposure, and blood samples (for complementing hematology) and bone marrow smears (for analysis of micronuclei) were prepared. Under the conditions used, exposure to SO2 caused no acute toxicity, mortality, or reduction in body weight. Compared with the clean-air controls, hematological parameters such as hematocrit, hemoglobin, erythrocyte/platelet/total leukocyte counts, differential white blood cell counts, and indicators of blood formation (reticulocyte counts, ratio of polychromatic to normochromatic <e>erythrocytes</e> in the bone marrow) remained unchanged by SO2 treatment. Unlike the previously reported studies on micronucleus formation, SO2 did not induce micronuclei in polychromatic erythrocytes of the bone marrow, whereas the positive control cyclophosphamide (60mg/kg body weight) was quite effective in this respect. Interestingly, SO2 treatment significantly enhanced malondialdehyde levels in erythrocyte lysates (TBARS method), indicating SO2-mediated oxidative stress, but also demonstrating systemic availability of the inhaled SO2. In conclusion, the present study could not reproduce the genotoxicity findings of the previously reported studies. SO2 is thus considered non-genotoxic in polychromatic erythrocytes in the bone marrow of NMRI mice under the conditions and in the concentrations used.",M1
20152873,"Time course of oxidant markers and antioxidant defenses in subgroups of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients.Oxidative stress markers have been found in nervous and peripheral tissues of familial and sporadic amyotrophic lateral sclerosis patients. Here, we evaluated the activity of some antioxidant enzymes glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase in erythrocyte, the marker of non-enzymatic antioxidant response (total antioxidant status), as well as plasma reactive oxygen species, at the enrolment and during disease progression in 88 patients affected by the sporadic form of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Our study has been performed along 72 months by grouping the patients according to the ALS functional rating score or rate of disease progression. Our results showed a significant impairment of <e>erythrocytes</e> glutathione peroxidase activity in all groups of patients that remained low during disease time course. SOD1 activity significantly decreased along disease course in subjects with a more impaired functional status. A decreasing activity of all assayed enzymes was found in patients who have a faster disease progression rate. By this work we have the evidence that different ALS phenotypes present with different profile of enzymatic and non-enzymatic antioxidant response.",M1
20152040,"In vitro and ex vivo effect of hyaluronic acid on erythrocyte flow properties.BACKGROUND: Hyaluronic acid (HA) is present in many tissues; its presence in serum may be related to certain inflammatory conditions, tissue damage, sepsis, liver malfunction and some malignancies. In the present work, our goal was to investigate the significance of hyaluronic acid effect on erythrocyte flow properties. Therefore we performed in vitro experiments incubating red blood cells (RBCs) with several HA concentrations. Afterwards, in order to corroborate the pathophysiological significance of the results obtained, we replicated the in vitro experiment with ex vivo RBCs from diagnosed rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, a serum HA-increasing pathology. METHODS: Erythrocyte deformability (by filtration through nucleopore membranes) and erythrocyte aggregability (EA) were tested on blood from healthy donors additioned with purified HA. EA was measured by transmitted light and analyzed with a mathematical model yielding two parameters, the aggregation rate and the size of the aggregates. Conformational changes of cytoskeleton proteins were estimated by electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy (EPR). RESULTS: In vitro, <e>erythrocytes</e> treated with HA showed increased rigidity index (RI) and reduced aggregability, situation strongly related to the rigidization of the membrane cytoskeleton triggered by HA, as shown by EPR results. Also, a significant correlation (r: 0.77, p &lt; 0.00001) was found between RI and serum HA in RA patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our results lead us to postulate the hypothesis that HA interacts with the erythrocyte surface leading to modifications in erythrocyte rheological and flow properties, both ex vivo and in vitro.",M1
20150354,"Antigenotoxic effect of mangiferin and changes in antioxidant enzyme levels of Swiss albino mice treated with cadmium chloride.Cadmium is an environmental metal toxin implicated in human diseases. Mangiferin (MGN), a naturally occurring glucosylxanthone, is present in Mangifera indica. In this study, the protective role of MGN against cadmium chloride (CdCl(2))-induced genotoxicity was studied in Swiss albino mice. Mice were administered with single intra-peritoneal (i.p.) optimal dose of MGN (2.5 mg/kg b.wt.) before treatment with various concentrations of CdCl(2) (7, 8, 9, 10 and 11 mg/kg b.wt.). The LD( 50(30)) was found to be 8.5 mg/kg b.wt. for DDW + CdCl(2) group, while it was increased to 9.77 mg/kg after MGN treatment resulting in increase in the LD(50(30)) value by 1.26 mg, with a dose reduction factor (DRF) of 1.14. Treatment of mice to various doses of CdCl(2) resulted in a dose-dependent increase in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic (MnPCE) and normochromatic <e>erythrocytes</e> (MnNCE), with corresponding decrease in the polychromatic / normochromatic erythrocyte ratio (PCE/NCE ratio) at various post-treatment times. MGN (2.5 mg/kg b.wt.) pretreatment significantly (p &lt; .001) reduced the frequency of MnPCE, MnNCE and increased PCE/NCE ratio when compared with the DDW + CdCl(2) group at all post-treatment times indicating its antigenotoxic effect. Further, pretreatment of MGN declined the lipid peroxidation (LPx) content in liver, whereas significant increase was observed in hepatic Glutathione (GSH), glutathione-S-transferase (GST), superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) activity. Our study revealed that MGN has potent antigenotoxic effect against CdCl(2)-induced toxicity in mice, which may be due to the scavenging of free radicals and increased antioxidant status.",M1
20146933,"Erythrophagocytosis by angiogenic endothelial cells is enhanced by loss of erythrocyte deformability.OBJECTIVE: Angiogenic endothelial cells can function as phagocytes, and phagocytosis is initiated via the opsonin lactadherin. In this study, we examined the interaction between lactadherin-opsonized <e>erythrocytes</e> with reduced deformability and angiogenic endothelium, as loss of deformability is characteristic for suicidal and aged erythrocytes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We used the Arg-Gly-Asp (RGD)-modified erythrocyte model and investigated the deformability parameter by cross-linking erythrocyte membranes through treatment with glutaraldehyde. Association in vitro with primary endothelial cells was detected by flow cytometry and visualized by light, fluorescent, and electron microscopy. Involvement of two crucial factors in phagocytosis, alpha(v)-integrins and Rho guanosine triphosphatase family member Rac1, was studied using small interfering RNA technology. Modified erythrocytes were administered in vivo into tumor-bearing mice to detect phagocytosis by endothelial cells. RESULTS: Glutaraldehyde-treated (rigid) RGD-modified erythrocytes showed a strongly enhanced endothelial cell association compared to flexible RGD-modified erythrocytes. Knockdown by small interfering RNA lipoplexes of alpha(v)-integrins and Rac1 confirmed classical tethering and internalization of rigid RGD-erythrocytes. Upon in vivo administration, tumor endothelium showed pronounced erythrophagocytosis. CONCLUSION: The pronounced phagocytosis of opsonized erythrocytes with reduced deformability by angiogenic growth factor-activated endothelial cells evokes new insights in endothelial cell function and suggests a role for these endothelial cells in (hematological) disorders because of their capacity to clear disordered erythrocytes.",M1
20145884,"Chromium in exhaled breath condensate (EBC), <e>erythrocytes</e>, plasma and urine in the biomonitoring of chrome-plating workers exposed to soluble Cr(VI).Chromium (Cr) levels measured in exhaled breath condensate (EBC-Cr) and urine (Cr-U) at the beginning and end of working shifts were related to those measured in erythrocytes (Cr-RBC) and plasma in 14 non-smoking male chrome-plating workers exposed to Cr(VI) in soluble aerosol form who did not report any significant current or past respiratory disease. Cr-U mainly correlated with Cr-P (Cr in plasma) at the end of the working shift (r(2) = 0.59, p &lt; 0.01), whereas Cr-RBC correlated with EBC-Cr (r(2) = 0.32, p &lt; 0.05); at the beginning of the shift, the only significant correlation was between Cr-U and Cr-RBC (r(2) = 0.74, p &lt; 0.01). The clearance of Cr(iii) arising from Cr(VI) reduction was rapid, thus making Cr-U and Cr-P ideal biomarkers of the most recent exposure, whereas Cr-RBC may represent the fraction of Cr(VI) that reaches the bloodstream in non-reduced form and therefore depends on the airway inhaled dose represented by EBC-Cr. Cr-RBC clearance is slower and not only involves the free diffusion of Cr(iii) from RBC to plasma, but probably also involves more complicated kinetic phenomena involving other tissues and organs, which may explain the correlation between Cr-RBC and Cr-U and the lack of correlation Cr-RBC and Cr-P at least 36 h after the last exposure. In conclusion, our findings reinforce the idea that measuring Cr in EBC can significantly contribute to traditional biomonitoring by providing specific information at the target organ level and integrating our knowledge of Cr toxicokinetics.",M1
20145098,"Concomitant infection decreases the malaria burden but escalates relapsing fever borreliosis.About 500 million cases of malaria occur annually. However, a substantial number of patients who actually have relapsing fever (RF) Borrelia infection can be misdiagnosed with malaria due to similar manifestations and geographic distributions of the two diseases. More alarmingly, a high prevalence of concomitant infections with malaria and RF Borrelia has been reported. Therefore, we used a mouse model to study the effects of such mixed infection. We observed a 21-fold increase in spirochete titers, whereas the numbers of parasitized <e>erythrocytes</e> were reduced 15-fold. This may be explained by polarization of the host immune response toward the intracellular malaria parasite, resulting in unaffected extracellular spirochetes and hosts that succumb to sepsis. Mixed infection also resulted in severe malaria anemia with low hemoglobin levels, even though the parasite counts were low. Overall, coinfected animals had a higher fatality rate and shorter time to death than those with either malaria or RF single infection. Furthermore, secondary malaria infection reactivated a quiescent RF brain infection, which is the first evidence of a clinically and biologically relevant cue for reactivation of RF Borrelia infection. Our study highlights the importance of investigating concomitant infections in vivo to elucidate the immune responses that are involved in the clinical outcome.",M1
20144459,"Separation of model mixtures of epsilon-globin positive fetal nucleated red blood cells and anucleate <e>erythrocytes</e> using a microfluidic device.Microfluidic devices are capable of separating microparticles and cells. We developed and tested the efficiency of silicon cross-flow microfilters for the separation of primitive fetal nucleated red blood cells (FNRBCs) and adult anucleate red blood cell (AARBCs) from model mixtures. Stepwise improvements over three generations of device design resulted in an increasing trend in the recovery of FNRBCs. We obtained a recovery of FNRBCs (74.0+/-6.3%, p&lt;0.05, n=5) using the third generation device, with a depletion of 46.5+/-3.2% AARBCs from the cell mixture. The purity of FNRBCs in the enriched fraction was enhanced by a factor of 1.7-fold.",M1
20143974,"Erythrocyte omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids profile in Sudanese women with pre-eclampsia.A case-control study was conducted in Khartoum hospital, Sudan to compare omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids profile in three phospholipid fractions (phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin) using gas chromatography in <e>erythrocytes</e> from 65 pre-eclamptic women and well-matched 60 healthy control pregnant women, both in the third trimester of pregnancy. While levels of arachidonic acid (omega-6 fatty acid) was significantly higher in women with pre-eclampsia in the sphingomyelin fraction only, the levels of eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acid (omega-3 fatty acid) in the three phospholipids fractions were significantly higher in women with pre-eclampsia than in the control group. Both omega-3 and omega-6 fatty acids profiles were not significantly different between patients with mild (diastolic blood pressure (DBP) &lt;110 mmHg) and severe (DBP &gt; or = 110 mmHg) pre-eclampsia.",M1
20143973,"Erythrocyte antioxidant enzymes and plasma antioxidant vitamins in Sudanese women with pre-eclampsia.This case-control study was conducted in Khartoum hospital, Sudan to investigate the levels of antioxidant enzymes (glutathione peroxidase, catalase and superoxide dismutase) in <e>erythrocytes</e> and plasma antioxidant vitamins (retinol and alpha-tocopherol) in Sudanese women with pre-eclampsia (37), in comparison with well-matched pregnant controls women with normal pregnancy (38). Enzymes were measured using ELISA and vitamins were measured using HPLC. There were no significant differences in the levels of these three antioxidant enzymes in pre-eclamptic women compared with the controls. Women with mild pre-eclampsia (diastolic blood pressure, DBP &lt; 110) have slightly higher levels of erythrocyte glutathione peroxidase, and lower levels of catalase and superoxide dismutase compared with women with severe pre-eclampsia (DBP &gt; or = 110). A significantly negative correlation was observed between the levels of glutathione peroxidase and DBP, r = -0.371, p = 0.02. There was no significant correlation between catalase (r = -0.033, p = 0.840) or superoxide dismutase levels (r = 0.067, p = 0.6) and DBP. While retinol levels were not different, levels of alpha-tocopherol were significantly higher in women with pre-eclampsia than the control group, p = 0.026. The plasma levels of both vitamins were not statistically significantly different when women with mild and severe pre-eclampsia were compared.",M1
20143626,"[Biological activity of metabolites of the herb Kalanchoe diagremontania (Hamet de la Bbathie) Jacobs et Perr]In this study we investigated the hemolytic, antimicrobial, and phytoregulatory activity of various classes of lipids (triacylglycerols, free fatty acids (FFA), the glyceroglycolipids monogalactosyl diacylglycerol (MGDG), sulfoquinovosyl diacylglycerol (SQDG)), sterols, all of them were obtained from the medical herb Kalanchoe diagremontiana, and also pigments, phenolic compounds (FC), polysaccharides, and ethanol extract (EE) of the herbal. It was established that EE, FC, FFA, and sterols display pH-dependent membranothropic activity. FFA showed antimicrobial activity and stimulated growth of buckwheat stalk sprouts. K. diagremontiana glyceroglycolopids did not display expressed biological activity. Caroteniods displayed pH-independent membranothopic action and antibacterial activity.

20140184,"Distinct external signals trigger sequential release of apical organelles during erythrocyte invasion by malaria parasites.The invasion of <e>erythrocytes</e> by Plasmodium merozoites requires specific interactions between host receptors and parasite ligands. Parasite proteins that bind erythrocyte receptors during invasion are localized in apical organelles called micronemes and rhoptries. The regulated secretion of microneme and rhoptry proteins to the merozoite surface to enable receptor binding is a critical step in the invasion process. The sequence of these secretion events and the external signals that trigger release are not known. We have used time-lapse video microscopy to study changes in intracellular calcium levels in Plasmodium falciparum merozoites during erythrocyte invasion. In addition, we have developed flow cytometry based methods to measure relative levels of cytosolic calcium and study surface expression of apical organelle proteins in P. falciparum merozoites in response to different external signals. We demonstrate that exposure of P. falciparum merozoites to low potassium ion concentrations as found in blood plasma leads to a rise in cytosolic calcium levels through a phospholipase C mediated pathway. Rise in cytosolic calcium triggers secretion of microneme proteins such as the 175 kD erythrocyte binding antigen (EBA175) and apical membrane antigen-1 (AMA-1) to the merozoite surface. Subsequently, interaction of EBA175 with glycophorin A (glyA), its receptor on erythrocytes, restores basal cytosolic calcium levels and triggers release of rhoptry proteins. Our results identify for the first time the external signals responsible for the sequential release of microneme and rhoptry proteins during erythrocyte invasion and provide a starting point for the dissection of signal transduction pathways involved in regulated exocytosis of these key apical organelles. Signaling pathway components involved in apical organelle discharge may serve as novel targets for drug development since inhibition of microneme and rhoptry secretion can block invasion and limit blood-stage parasite growth.",M1
20138103,"Genotoxicity studies on fucoidan from Sporophyll of Undaria pinnatifida.The sulfated seaweed extract, fucoidan, has anticoagulant, antithrombotic, and antiviral activities. Despite extensive work on the biological activities of fucoidan, detailed studies on the genotoxicity of fucoidan from Sporophyll of Undaria pinnatifida sources have not been tested before. The objective of this study was to investigate the genotoxicity effects of fucoidan extracted from Sporophyll of U. pinnatifida using a test battery of three different methods. In a reverse mutation assay using four Salmonella typhimurium strains and Escherichia coli, fucoidan did not increase the number of revertant colonies in any tester strain regardless of metabolic activation by S9 mix, and did not cause chromosomal aberration in short tests with S9 mix or in the continuous (24 h) test. A bone marrow micronucleus test in ICR mice dosed by oral gavage at doses up to 2000 mg/kg bw/day showed no significant or dose-dependent increases in the frequency of micronucleated polychromatic <e>erythrocytes</e> (MNPCE), and the high dose suppressed the ratio of polychromatic erythrocytes (PCE) to total erythrocytes. We conclude that fucoidan presents no significant genotoxic concern under the anticipated conditions of use.",M1
20136348,"Oxidative stress induced by atrazine in rat <e>erythrocytes</e>: mitigating effect of vitamin E.The present study investigates the propensity of atrazine to induce oxidative stress and its possible attenuation by vitamin E in rat erythrocytes, which is a convenient model to understand the oxidative damage induced by various xenobiotics. Experimental animals were administered atrazine (300 mg/kg body weight, daily) and/or vitamin E (100 mg/kg body weight, daily) orally for a period of 7, 14, and 21 days. Results indicated that the reduced glutathione (GSH) content of the erythrocytes of atrazine treated rats was significantly decreased as compared to the control group. Co-administration of vitamin E along with atrazine restored the GSH content of erythrocytes nearly to control levels. The activities of antioxidant enzymes such as superoxide dismutase, catalase, glutathione peroxidase, and glutathione-s-transferase were found to be increased significantly in the erythrocytes accompanied by a decrease in the activity of the glucose-6-phosophate dehydrogenase, following atrazine exposure. On the other hand, when vitamin E was co-administered along with atrazine, activities of these enzymes were found to be restored significantly. In conclusion, results of the study demonstrated that atrazine induced oxidative stress in rat erythrocytes, in terms of increased activities of the various antioxidant enzymes, and decreased content of reduced glutathione. However, vitamin E administration ameliorated the effects of atrazine, suggesting that vitamin E is a potential antioxidant against atrazine-induced oxidative stress.",M1
20134088,"Arsenic intoxication, a hemorheologic view.Arsenic (As) is a toxic semi-metal of wide distribution in nature. People living in regions where drinking water contains large quantities of arsenic, have an unusually high likelihood of developing blood-vessel diseases, but little is known about the mechanisms involved, i.e. the blood rheologic alterations that would contribute to the circulatory obstruction. <e>Erythrocytes</e> are the main target cells for arsenic compounds systemically absorbed and their cell membrane is the first place against the toxic. In this paper we have examined the in vitro effect of arsenic (As(V)) on the rheologic properties of human erythrocytes in relation with membrane fluidity and internal microviscosity. According to our present results, As(V) treatment produces oxidative degradation of membrane lipids and alteration of internal microviscosity. These red blood cells (RBCs) membrane and cytoplasmic structural damage consequently alters RBCs rheologic properties: an alteration of the RBCs discoid shape to stomatocytes, a diminution of erythrocyte deformability and an enhancement of osmotic fragility and cell aggregability. These effects impaired blood fluid behaviour that contribute to obstruct peripheral circulation and provides anemia, both clinic evidences typical of arsenic cronic intoxication.",M1
20132022,"Erythrocyte markers of oxidative stress in higher age-group preeclamptic and normal pregnant mothers.Preeclampsia can have significant impact on health of both mother and fetus. It had been proposed that maternal endothelial cell dysfunction is the key event resulting in the diverse clinical manifestations of preeclampsia and evidence has since accumulated. Research in recent times is indicative of the role of oxidative stress in the endothelial cell dysfunction. Preeclampsia is more common in first pregnancy and studies have further shown an increase in risk of preeclampsia with maternal age. The aim of this study was to explore the status of oxidative stress in higher age-group preeclamptic and normal pregnant mother. The study included 20 normal pregnant women and 60 preeclamptic women. They were allocated into 4 subgroups between ages 20-25, 26-30, 31-35, and 36-40. <e>Erythrocytes</e> were analyzed for the following antioxidant enzymes, i.e., glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase and catalase.Lipid peroxidation product, malondialdehyde, was analyzed to determine oxidative stress. The results showed an increase in oxidative stress, and high magnitude suppression/decrease in antioxidant enzymes activities in erythrocytes with increase in age groups in both preeclamptic and normal pregnant women. This indicates that an increase in the risk of preeclampsia with maternal age could be due to an increase in oxidative stress with age. This further attests to the role of oxidative stress in preeclampsia.",M1
20130643,"An aspartyl protease directs malaria effector proteins to the host cell.Plasmodium falciparum causes the virulent form of malaria and disease manifestations are linked to growth inside infected <e>erythrocytes</e>. To survive and evade host responses the parasite remodels the erythrocyte by exporting several hundred effector proteins beyond the surrounding parasitophorous vacuole membrane. A feature of exported proteins is a pentameric motif (RxLxE/Q/D) that is a substrate for an unknown protease. Here we show that the protein responsible for cleavage of this motif is plasmepsin V (PMV), an aspartic acid protease located in the endoplasmic reticulum. PMV cleavage reveals the export signal (xE/Q/D) at the amino terminus of cargo proteins. Expression of an identical mature protein with xQ at the N terminus generated by signal peptidase was not exported, demonstrating that PMV activity is essential and linked with other key export events. Identification of the protease responsible for export into erythrocytes provides a novel target for therapeutic intervention against this devastating disease.",M1
20130222,"Comparative analysis of nitrite uptake and hemoglobin-nitrite reactions in <e>erythrocytes</e>: sorting out uptake mechanisms and oxygenation dependencies.Nitrite uptake into red blood cells (RBCs) precedes its intracellular reactions with hemoglobin (Hb) that forms nitric oxide (NO) during hypoxia. We investigated the uptake of nitrite and its reactions with Hb at different oxygen saturations (So(2)), using RBCs with (carp and rabbit) and without (hagfish and lamprey) anion exchanger-1 (AE1) in the membrane, with the aim to unravel the mechanisms and oxygenation dependencies of nitrite transport. Added nitrite rapidly diffused into the RBCs until equilibrium. The distribution ratio of nitrite across the membrane agreed with that expected from HNO(2) diffusion and AE1-mediated facilitated NO(2)(-) diffusion. Participation of HNO(2) diffusion was emphasized by rapid transmembrane nitrite equilibration also in the natural AE1 knockouts. Following the equilibration, nitrite was consumed by reacting with Hb, which created a continued inward diffusion controlled by intracellular reaction rates. Changes in nitrite uptake with So(2), pH, or species were accordingly explained by corresponding changes in reaction rates. In carp, nitrite uptake rates increased linearly with decreasing So(2) over the entire So(2) range. In rabbit, nitrite uptake rates were highest at intermediate So(2), producing a bell-shaped relationship with So(2). Nitrite consumption increased approximately 10-fold with a 1 unit decrease in pH, as expected from the involvement of protons in the reactions with Hb. The reaction of nitrite with deoxyhemoglobin was favored over that with oxyhemoglobin at intermediate So(2). We propose a model for RBC nitrite uptake that involves both HNO(2) diffusion and AE1-mediated transport and that explains both the present and previous (sometimes puzzling) results.",M1
20124515,"Gfi-1B controls human erythroid and megakaryocytic differentiation by regulating TGF-beta signaling at the bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitor stage.Growth factor independence-1B (Gfi-1B) is a transcriptional repressor essential for erythropoiesis and megakaryopoiesis. Targeted gene disruption of GFI1B in mice leads to embryonic lethality resulting from failure to produce definitive <e>erythrocytes</e>, hindering the study of Gfi-1B function in adult hematopoiesis. We here show that, in humans, Gfi-1B controls the development of erythrocytes and megakaryocytes by regulating the proliferation and differentiation of bipotent erythro-megakaryocytic progenitors. We further identify in this cell population the type III transforming growth factor-beta receptor gene, TGFBR3, as a direct target of Gfi-1B. Knockdown of Gfi-1B results in altered transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) signaling as shown by the increase in Smad2 phosphorylation and its inability to associate to the transcription intermediary factor 1-gamma (TIF1-gamma). Because the Smad2/TIF1-gamma complex is known to specifically regulate erythroid differentiation, we propose that, by repressing TGF-beta type III receptor (TbetaRIotaII) expression, Gfi-1B favors the Smad2/TIF1-gamma interaction downstream of TGF-beta signaling, allowing immature progenitors to differentiate toward the erythroid lineage.",M1
20123084,"Three unrelated sphingomyelin analogs spontaneously cluster into plasma membrane micrometric domains.Micrometric lipid compartmentation at the plasma membrane is disputed. Using live confocal imaging, we found that three unrelated fluorescent sphingomyelin (SM) analogs spontaneously clustered at the outer leaflet into micrometric domains, contrasting with homogeneous labelling by DiIC18 and TMA-DPH. In <e>erythrocytes</e>, these domains were round, randomly distributed, and reversibly coalesced under hypotonicity. BODIPY-SM and -glucosylceramide showed distinct temperature-dependence, in the same ranking as Tm for corresponding natural lipids, indicating phase behaviour. Scanning electron microscopy excluded micrometric surface structural features. In CHO cells, similar surface micrometric patches were produced by either direct BODIPY-SM insertion or intracellular processing from BODIPY-ceramide, ruling out aggregation artefacts. BODIPY-SM surface micrometric patches were refractory to endocytosis block or actin depolymerization and clustered upon cholesterol deprivation, indicating self-clustering at the plasma membrane. BODIPY-SM excimers further suggested clustering in ordered domains. Segregation of BODIPY-SM and -lactosylceramide micrometric domains showed coexistence of distinct phases. Consistent with micrometric domain boundaries, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) revealed restriction of BODIPY-SM lateral diffusion over long-range, but not short-range, contrasting with comparable high mobile fraction of BODIPY-lactosylceramide in both ranges. Controlled perturbations of endogenous SM pool similarly affected BODIPY-SM domain size by confocal imaging and its mobile fraction by FRAP. The latter evidence supports the hypothesis that, as shown for BODIPY-SM, endogenous SM spontaneously clusters at the plasmalemma outer leaflet of living cells into ordered micrometric domains, defined in shape by liquid-phase coexistence and in size by membrane tension and cholesterol. This proposal remains speculative and calls for further investigations.",M1

20114059,"Reduced cellular redox status induces 4-hydroxynonenal-mediated caspase 3 activation leading to erythrocyte death during chronic arsenic exposure in rats.Chronic exposure to arsenic in rats led to gradual accumulation of the toxicant in <e>erythrocytes</e> causing oxidative stress in these cells. 4-Hydroxynonenal (4-HNE), a major aldehyde product of lipid peroxidation, contributed significantly to the cytopathological events observed during oxidative stress in the erythrocytes of exposed rats. 4-HNE triggered death signal cascade that was initiated with the formation of HNE-protein adducts in cytosol. HNE-protein adduct formation resulted in depletion of cytosolic antioxidants followed by increased generation of ROS. Results showed accumulation of hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) from the early stages of arsenic exposure, while superoxide (O(2)(*-)) and hydroxyl radical ((*)OH) also contributed to the oxidative stress during longer period of exposure. Suppression of antioxidant system coupled with increased generation of ROS eventually led to activation of caspase 3 during arsenic exposure. Attenuation of HNE-mediated activation of caspase 3 in presence of N-acetylcysteine (NAC) indicated the involvement of GSH in the process. Prevention of HNE-mediated degradation of membrane proteins in presence of Z-DEVD-FMK identified caspase 3 as the principal mediator of HNE-induced cellular damage during arsenic exposure. Degradation of band 3 followed by its aggregation on the red cell surface promoted immunologic recognition of redistributed band 3 by autologous IgG with subsequent attachment of C3b. Finally, the formation of C3b-IgG-band 3 immune complex accelerated the elimination of affected cells from circulation and led to the decline of erythrocyte life span during chronic arsenic toxicity.",M1
20113503,"Uptake of purines in Plasmodium falciparum-infected human <e>erythrocytes</e> is mostly mediated by the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter and the human facilitative nucleobase transporter.BACKGROUND: Plasmodium parasites are unable to synthesize purines de novo and have to salvage them from the host. Due to this limitation in the parasite, purine transporters have been an area of focus in the search for anti-malarial drugs. Although the uptake of purines through the human equilibrative nucleoside transporter (hENT1), the human facilitative nucleobase transporter (hFNT1) and the parasite-induced new permeation pathway (NPP) has been studied, no information appears to exist on the relative contribution of these three transporters to the uptake of adenosine and hypoxanthine. Using the appropriate transporter inhibitors, the role of each of these salvage pathways to the overall purine transport in intraerythrocytic Plasmodium falciparum was systematically investigated. METHODS: The transport of adenosine, hypoxanthine and adenine into uninfected and P. falciparum-infected human erythrocytes was investigated in the presence or absence of classical inhibitors of the hFNT1, hENT1 and NPP. The effective inhibition of the various transporters by the classical inhibitors was verified using appropriate known substrates. The ability of high concentration of unlabelled substrates to saturate these transporters was also studied. RESULTS: Transport of exogenous purine into infected or uninfected erythrocytes occurred primarily through saturable transporters rather than through the NPP. Hypoxanthine and adenine appeared to enter erythrocytes mainly through the hFNT1 nucleobase transporter whereas adenosine entered predominantly through the hENT1 nucleoside transporter. The rate of purine uptake was approximately doubled in infected cells compared to uninfected erythrocytes. In addition, it was found that the rate of adenosine uptake was considerably higher than the rate of hypoxanthine uptake in infected human red blood cells (RBC). It was also demonstrated that furosemide inhibited the transport of purine bases through hFNT1. CONCLUSION: Collectively, the data obtained in this study clearly show that the endogenous host erythrocyte transporters hENT1 and hFNT1, rather than the NPP, are the major route of entry of purine into parasitized RBC. Inhibitors of hENT1 and hFNT1, as well as the NPP, should be considered in the development of anti-malarials targeted to purine transport.",M1
20113285,"Effects of a single sickling event on the mechanical fragility of sickle cell trait <e>erythrocytes</e>.Hemolysis contributes to the pathology associated with sickle cell disease. However, the mechanism of hemolysis or relative contribution of sickling due to hemoglobin (Hb) polymerization vs. oxidative damage remains unknown. Earlier studies aimed at deciphering the relative importance of these two mechanisms have been complicated by the fact that sickle red cells (SS) have already been affected by multiple rounds of sickling and oxidative damage before they are collected. In our study, we examine the mechanical fragility of sickle cell trait cells, which do not sickle in vivo, but can be made to do so in vitro. Thus, our novel approach explores the effects of sickle Hb polymerization on cells that have never been sickled before. We find that the mechanical fragility of these cells increases dramatically after a single sickling event, suggesting that a substantial amount of hemolysis in vivo probably occurs in polymer-containing cells.",M1
20113128,"A new streaming potential chamber for zeta potential measurements of particulates.A novel streaming potential measurement device has been validated by determining the average electrokinetic (zeta) potential of densely packed particulate such as human <e>erythrocytes</e> and ground bovine cortical bone. The new streaming potential device used in this study is easy to construct in the laboratory, designed to allow dense packing of particles, and determines zeta potentials for a broad range of particle sizes. The streaming potential device consists of four Plexiglas parts: (i) an upper and (ii) a lower chamber, which act as reservoirs for fluid; (iii) a midchamber which connects the upper and lower chambers and holds the sample holder, and (iv) a sample holder. Pressurization of fluid in the top chamber generates a pressure gradient that induces movement of fluid through the stationary sample and into the bottom chamber. Pressure induced flow through the interconnected pores of the densely packed particulate generates a potential difference across the sample that is measured using electrodes housed in the top and bottom chambers. The measured potential difference is then converted to zeta potentials. The advantage of this chamber is its ability to handle densely packed particulates exhibiting a broad distribution of sizes. Dense packing of particulate is achieved by compacting samples at the bottom of the sample holder under centrifugal forces before the device is assembled. This approach allowed us to determine average zeta potentials of densely packed particulate made of soft and hard materials.",M1
20111746,"The coming-out of malaria gametocytes.The tropical disease malaria, which results in more than one million deaths annually, is caused by protozoan parasites of the genus Plasmodium and transmitted by blood-feeding Anopheline mosquitoes. Parasite transition from the human host to the mosquito vector is mediated by gametocytes, sexual stages that are formed in human <e>erythrocytes</e>, which therefore play a crucial part in the spread of the tropical disease. The uptake by the blood-feeding mosquito triggers important molecular and cellular changes in the gametocytes, thus mediating the rapid adjustment of the parasite from the warm-blooded host to the insect host and subsequently initiating reproduction. The contact with midgut factors triggers gametocyte activation and results in their egress from the enveloping erythrocyte, which then leads to gamete formation and fertilization. This review summarizes recent findings on the role of gametocytes during transmission to the mosquito and particularly focuses on the molecular mechanisms underlying gametocyte activation and emergence from the host erythrocyte during gametogenesis.",M1
20109466,"Full-length recombinant Plasmodium falciparum VAR2CSA binds specifically to CSPG and induces potent parasite adhesion-blocking antibodies.Plasmodium falciparum malaria remains one of the world's leading causes of human suffering and poverty. Each year, the disease takes 1-3 million lives, mainly in sub-Saharan Africa. The adhesion of infected <e>erythrocytes</e> (IEs) to vascular endothelium or placenta is the key event in the pathogenesis of severe P. falciparum infection. In pregnant women, the parasites express a single and unique member of the P. falciparum erythrocyte membrane protein 1 (PfEMP1) family named VAR2CSA, which is associated with the ability of the IEs to adhere specifically to chondroitin sulphate A (CSA) in the placenta. Several Duffy-binding-like domains from VAR2CSA molecules have been shown in vitro to bind to CSA, but it has also been demonstrated that Duffy-binding-like domains from PfEMP1 proteins other than VAR2CSA can bind CSA. In addition, the specificity of the binding of VAR2CSA domains to glycosaminoglycans does not match that of VAR2CSA-expressing IEs. This has led to speculation that the domains of native VAR2CSA need to come together to form a specific binding site or that VAR2CSA might bind to CSA through a bridging molecule. Here, we describe the expression and purification of the complete extracellular region of VAR2CSA secreted at high yields from insect cells. Using surface plasmon resonance, we demonstrate that VAR2CSA alone binds with nanomolar affinity to human chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan and with significantly weaker affinity to other glycosaminoglycans, showing a specificity similar to that observed for IEs. Antibodies raised against full-length VAR2CSA completely inhibit recombinant VAR2CSA binding, as well as parasite binding to chondroitin sulphate proteoglycan. This is the first study to describe the successful production and functionality of a full-length PfEMP1. The specificity of the binding and anti-adhesion potency of induced IgG, together with high-yield production, encourages the use of full-length PfEMP1 in vaccine development strategies.",M1

They were found to have a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) lower number of erythrocytes, absolute number of stab neutrophils, and relative number of segmented neutrophils compared with the respective normal values. In addition, their blood pH values were decreased. The above changes are characteristic of hypoxic conditions supposed  to train  tissues for chronic inflammation; such training may underlie the mechanism of therapeutic effect of alternating magnetic field in women with tubuloperitoneal infertility.",M2
19952438,"Impaired erythrocyte filterability of spontaneously hypertensive rats: investigation by nickel filtration technique.BACKGROUND: Deformability of <e>erythrocytes</e> plays a key role in the impairment of the microcirculation in hypertension. However, erythrocyte deformability in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) during development of hypertension has not been fully investigated so far. METHODS AND RESULTS: Erythrocyte filterability (whole cell deformability) was investigated in relation to blood pressure measured by the tail-cuff method in SHR and age-matched Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY), using a highly sensitive and reproducible nickel mesh filtration technique. Impaired erythrocyte filterability was marked (37.0+/-17.5%) in prehypertensive young SHR (7 weeks of age) and sustained (51.6+/-13.3%) in hypertensive mature SHR (18 weeks of age), when compared with that of age-matched WKY (62.1+/-7.2% in 7 weeks of age, P&lt;0.005, and 71.1+/-3.9% in 18 weeks of age, P&lt;0.005, respectively). This impairment in SHR could not be explained by the mean corpuscular volume or mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration of erythrocytes, but the erythrocyte count was significantly (P&lt;0.005) greater in SHR than in the age-matched WKY. CONCLUSIONS: Although the precise mechanisms remain to be elucidated, markedly impaired erythrocyte filterability in SHR is considered to contribute to the development and maintenance of genetic hypertension.

19405134,"Hematological responses of the grey carpet shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum) and the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum) to anoxia and re-oxygenation.We compared the hematological responses of wild and captive populations of two closely related sharks to a standardized anoxic challenge and during a 12 hr recovery period in normoxia: the epaulette shark (Hemiscyllium ocellatum, Bonnaterre, 1788) and the grey carpet shark (Chiloscyllium punctatum, M√ºller and Henle, 1838). Compared to normoxic controls, a significant increase in hematocrit (captive 22.3%; wild 35.9%) coupled with a decline in mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration occurred in epaulette sharks indicating erythrocyte swelling in response to anoxia. However, the grey carpet shark had a significantly increased hematocrit (captive 27.2%; wild 29.3%), erythrocyte count (captive 37.6%; wild 46.3%) and hemoglobin concentration (captive 31.9%; wild 31.5%), suggesting a release of <e>erythrocytes</e> into the circulation and/or hemoconcentration in response to anoxia. Plasma glucose concentrations were maintained in both wild and captive epaulette sharks and in wild grey carpet sharks during anoxia but increased significantly after 2 hr of re-oxygenation (epaulette: captive 55.8%; wild 50.1%; grey carpet shark: wild 70.3%) and remained elevated for 12 hr. Captive grey carpet sharks had an immediate increase in plasma glucose concentrations after anoxia (96.4%), which was sustained for 12 hr of re-oxygenation. Lactate concentrations significantly increased in captive and wild animals of both species after anoxia, reaching a peak at 2 hr of re-oxygenation. Both species showed significant, yet divergent, hematological changes in response to anoxia and re-oxygenation, which may not only prolong their survival and assist in recovery but also reflect their respective ecophysiological adaptations to the extreme environments that they inhabit.",M2
19368275,"[An early contact with the baby--benefit for the mother]INTRODUCTION: Numerous studies on the early contact between mother and the baby and the time they spend together-common stay stress the fact that these are invaluable for the mothers, infants, family and society in general. The objective of the research. The objective of the research was to establish whether mother benefits from the early contact with her baby and the importance of the time period they spend and share together MATERIALS AND METHODS: The study group consisted of 216 mothers that spend the time with their babies and had the early contact with the babies as well, and the control group consisted of 216 mothers that were detached from their babies. Puerpera were observed in the aspects of the uterus involution, post delivery hemogramme on the third day after the childbirth, sanitary napkin consumption and the hospitalization length. RESULTS: For the study group the following was significant: less of the bad uterus involution, less of the post delivery anemia measured in the hemoglobin values and in the number of <e>erythrocytes</e>, less of the sanitary napkin consumption and the shorter hospitalization length. DISCUSSION: The early contact and the time spent with their babies after the childbirth influence the less blood loss analized by post delivery hemogramme, better uterus involution, less of the sanitary napkin consumption analyzed in the first three days after the childbirth and the shorter hospitalization length. The positive component of the breastfeeding oxytocic reflex is probably responsible for these effects. CONCLUSION: Puerpera benefit from the early contact and the time spent with their babies.",M2
19234353,"The effect of high- to low-altitude adaptation on the multifocal electroretinogram.PURPOSE: To examine variations in retinal electrophysiology assessed by multifocal electroretinogram (mfERG) during acclimatization of native highlanders to normobaric normoxia at sea level. METHODS: Eight healthy residents of the greater La Paz area in Bolivia (3600 m above sea level) were examined over 72 days after arriving in Copenhagen, Denmark (sea level). A control group of eight healthy lowlanders was used for comparison. RESULTS: During the period of observation, hemoglobin decreased from 16.7 to 15.0 g/dL (P = 0.0031), <e>erythrocytes</e> decreased from 5.3 to 4.6 trillion cells/L (P = 0.0006), and hematocrit decreased from 49.4% to 42.2% (P = 0.0008). At baseline, day 2 after arrival, the amplitudes (N1, P1, and N2) of the mfERG were 43.1% to 59.9% higher in the highlanders than in the lowlanders (P &lt; 0.017). During acclimatization, the mfERG amplitudes increased 16.9% to 20.4% (P &lt; 0.028) to a level of 73.2% to 87.0% higher in the highlanders than in the lowlanders (P &lt; 0.0008). The increase in numerical amplitudes was proportional to the decrease in erythrocyte concentration (P = 0.023, 0.053, and 0.12 for N1, P1, and N2, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: On arrival at sea level, the highlanders had markedly supernormal multifocal electroretinographic amplitudes that continued to increase during the 72-day period of observation where the highlanders' hematocrit normalized. The results suggest that acclimatization after a change in altitude and hence in ambient oxygen tension involves intrinsic retinal mechanisms and that acclimatization was not complete by the end of the study.",M2

Blood pressure, vascular resistance, and C-reactive protein (P = 0.09) were significantly higher in the African women (n = 102) compared to the Caucasian women (n = 115), while arterial compliance was significantly lower in the African women with no significant differences for endothelin-1. In single, partial, and multiple regression analyses, there was a significant positive correlation between the red blood cell count and log endothelin-1 in the Caucasians while in the Africans there was a weak negative correlation. This is an indication that endothelin-1 might interfere with erythrocyte production in Africans with higher levels of inflammation.",M2
19094877,"[Influence of pleural fluid red blood cell count on the misidentification of transudates]BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Light's criteria misclassify a quarter of transudates as exudates. We assessed the influence of red blood cell counts on pleural lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels and, thereby, on the specificity of Light's criteria. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We retrospectively reviewed 1,312 consecutive patients with pleural effusion, of whom 1,014 were exudates and 298 transudates according to clinical criteria. The relationship between pleural <e>erythrocytes</e> and LDH using simple linear regression analysis, as well as the operating characteristics of Light's criteria, were assessed. Finally, a formula to correct pleural LDH levels, according to the erythrocyte count, was generated. RESULTS: There was a linear relationship between the pleural erythrocyte count and LDH levels (r = 0.44; p &lt; 0.001). Light's criteria yielded 81% specificity in patients with pleural erythrocyte counts &lt; or = 10.000 3 10(6)/l, as compared to 61% in a group with a higher erythrocyte counts (p &lt; 0.01). The application of the LDH formula enabled the correct reclassification of 24 of 64 (37%) false exudates. CONCLUSIONS: A high pleural erythrocyte count, through its influence on the LDH levels, may lead to a transudate being misclassified as an exudate after applying Light's criteria.",M2

In recent years there have been new developments in the automation of this test. The objective of the present study was to compare the performances of two urine sediment analysers, namely LabUMat with UriSed (77 Elektronika Kft, Budapest, Hungary) and iQ200 (Iris Diagnostics, Chatsworth, CA, U.S.A.), with the KOVA method for manual urine measurement by evaluating the results in terms of similar parameters (cells or particles per lower-power field or high-power field). The results obtained using the UriSed and iQ200 analysers were more reproducible (7.1-30.2 and 14.9-35.4% respectively) than those obtained using the manual technique (17.9-44.4%). Significant correlations were established among the three techniques in the evaluation of leucocytes, <e>erythrocytes</e> and epithelial cells.

18854224,"Do leucocytes reflect condition in nestling burrowing parrots Cyanoliseus patagonus in the wild?The different leucocyte types are an important part of the immune system. Thus, they have been used in ecological studies to assess immune function and physiological stress in wild birds. It is generally assumed that increased stress and decreased condition are associated with an increase in the ratio of heterophils to lymphocytes, the H/L ratio. We studied leucocyte profiles in relation to body condition in nestling Burrowing Parrots (Cyanoliseus patagonus) in North-eastern Patagonia, Argentina. As in other wild parrots, heterophils were the most numerous leucocyte type, suggesting strong investment into innate immunity. Leucocyte profiles did not change with the age, while nestlings in better body condition increased the number of heterophils. Because the number of lymphocytes was independent of body condition, as a result we observed a positive correlation between body condition and the H/L ratio. The total number of leucocytes relative to <e>erythrocytes</e> increased in nestlings in better body condition, indicating a larger overall investment into immune function in well-nourished nestlings. The observed heterophilic profiles of nestling Burrowing Parrots together with the positive relationship between H/L ratio and body condition may indicate a favoured investment in a robust innate immunity that reduces the risk of infection taking hold in these long-lived birds.",M2

Radiation exposure resulted in a significant decline (P&lt;.001) in <e>erythrocytes</e> and hemoglobin until the third day, following a gradual recovery (ie, day 7), but these values did not reach normal values during the remainder of the animals' life span. Hematocrit percentage declined significantly (P&lt;.001) until day 15. In contrast, ASE-pretreated irradiated animals had significantly higher erythrocyte, hematocrit, and hemoglobin values than the irradiated controls. Furthermore, a significant elevation in lipid peroxidation level over normal was recorded in gamma-irradiated mice, whereas this increase was considerably lower in ASE-pretreated animals. Pretreatment with ASE caused a significant increase in glutathione levels in serum as well as in liver in comparison to irradiated animals. This study showed that ASE protects against radiation-induced hematological and biochemical alterations in Swiss albino mice.",M2

METHODS: The 0.1 mL venous blood was collected from the marginal ear vein of every rabbit (n=20), respectively, and <e>erythrocytes</e> were separated by centrifugation and then were labeled with FITC. Positive rate and fluorescence intensity of FITC-labeled RBC were detected by flow cytometry. RBC amorphous was observed under the inverted fluorescence microscope. Saphenous retrograde island fasciocutaneous flap and antegrade island fasciocutaneous flap (4.0 cm x 3.0 cm in size with vascular pedicle length of 3.0 cm) were successfully established in hind limbs of 20 New Zealand white rabbits. One hind limb of each rabbit was randomly assigned as the experimental group and the contralateral side was assigned as the control. The same flap was established in the control group without any fluorescence tracer. According to retrograde or antegrade flaps, the experimental group was divided into 2 groups with 10 rabbits in each group. And then, according to different pathways of tracer-giving, each group was divided into 2 subgroups of artery and vein, with 5 rabbits in each subgroup. The labeled erythrocytes (5 microL) were injected into artery or vein and then flaps were cut down 5 seconds later. The flaps were immediately frozen and chipped (5-7 microm). Consecutive three frozen sections were made and two of them were stained with HE and GENMED, respectively, but the third one was squashed without staining. All frozen sections were observed under the microscope. RESULTS: Positive rate of FITC-labeled RBC was beyond 99% and fluorescence intensity was more than or equal to 10(3). FITC-labeled RBC showed steady green fluorescence under the inverted fluorescence microscope. Fluorescence appeared in all experimental groups, but none was found in the control groups. In antegrade island flap group, fluorescence appeared mainly in lumen of vein, wall of vein and inner membrane and outer membrane of artery. In retrograde island flap group, fluorescence distributed principally in inner membrane and outer membrane of artery and wall of vein. CONCLUSION: The fluorescence tracing is applicable to the research of venous drainage. Venous drainage in the antegrade island flaps is mainly through lumen of vein, wall of vein and inner membrane and outer membrane of artery. While, venous drainage in retrograde island flaps is principally through inner membrane and outer membrane of artery and wall of vein.",M2

18649033,"Effects of different artificial photoperiods and temperatures on haematological parameters of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).This study assessed the effects of two artificial photoperiods (LD 24:0 and LD 12:12) and three temperature regimes (9, 11, and 18 degrees C) for 30 days on haematological parameters of trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) kept in freshwater. Samples were taken at days 7, 14, and 30 during exposure to treatments. A higher mortality (22%) and lower oxygen concentration (&lt;8.0 mg/l) were associated with the combination of photoperiod LD 24:0 and 18 degrees C.

Hemoglobin, free hemoglobin, hematocrit, <e>erythrocytes</e>, leukocytes, platelets, and protein were measured before and after processing. The highest values of hemoglobin, hematocrit and erythrocytes were achieved using 800 and 1000 ml/min pump speeds in group I and 500 ml/min speed in group II. Red blood cells concentration was higher in group I. There were no significant changes of free hemoglobin removal within group I. In group II the lowest free hemoglobin was achieved when 1000 ml/min rate was used. Platelets and protein did not depend on wash pump speeds in both groups. Platelet recovery in group I was higher than in group II at all washing pump speeds. Leukocytes were not adequately removed at all pump speeds. The Cell Saver 5 produces optimum results when the high wash pump speeds (800 and 1000 ml/min) and standard centrifuge speed are used.",M2
18485803,"Differences in the frequency of micronucleated <e>erythrocytes</e> in humans in relation to consumption of fried carbohydrate-rich food.The aim of this study was to investigate if consumption of ordinary carbohydrate-rich food prepared in different ways has an impact on chromosome stability, i.e., on the formation of micronucleated young erythrocytes in humans. Twenty-four persons, divided into two groups, participated during 4 days in a semi-controlled food-consumption study. One group (low-heated-food-group, LowHF-group) consumed only food boiled in water (max 100 degrees C) and the other group (high-heated-food-group, HighHF-group) consumed preferentially strongly heated (fried) food. From each of the subjects, blood samples were drawn, before and after 4 days. The frequency (f) of micronucleated (MN) very young erythrocytes (transferrin-positive reticulocytes, Trf-Ret), fMNTrf-Ret, was determined, and the difference in the frequency, before and after the eating period, was calculated. The obtained mean differences for the two groups were compared. As an indicator of highly heated food the acrylamide (AA) content in part of the consumed foodstuffs was analysed by use of LC/MS-MS and the AA intake estimated. In the blood samples the hemoglobin-adduct levels from AA were analysed as a measure of the internal AA dose. The differences between the mean fMNTrf-Ret, before and after the eating period, were -0.15 per thousand for the LowHF-group and +0.17 per thousand for the HighHF-group, p&lt;0.005 (t-test, one-tailed). The mean total AA intake in the HighHF-group during 4 days was estimated to about 3000+/-450microg per person. For the LowHF-group, the mean AA intake was low, 20+/-10microg per person. The lowest dose of AA that caused a significant increase of micronucleated erythrocytes in mice is more than a hundred times higher than the AA level in this study. Thus, it is unlikely that the exposure to AA is the major cause behind the observed difference. The answer is probably to be found in other compounds produced at the same time during heating of the food.",M2
18373862,"A novel semi-automatic image processing approach to determine Plasmodium falciparum parasitemia in Giemsa-stained thin blood smears.BACKGROUND: Malaria parasitemia is commonly used as a measurement of the amount of parasites in the patient's blood and a crucial indicator for the degree of infection. Manual evaluation of Giemsa-stained thin blood smears under the microscope is onerous, time consuming and subject to human error. Although automatic assessments can overcome some of these problems the available methods are currently limited by their inability to evaluate cases that deviate from a chosen  standard  model. RESULTS: In this study reliable parasitemia counts were achieved even for sub-standard smear and image quality. The outcome was assessed through comparisons with manual evaluations of more than 200 sample smears and related to the complexity of cell overlaps. On average an estimation error of less than 1% with respect to the average of manually obtained parasitemia counts was achieved. In particular the results from the proposed approach are generally within one standard deviation of the counts provided by a comparison group of malariologists yielding a correlation of 0.97. Variations occur mainly for blurred out-of-focus imagery exhibiting larger degrees of cell overlaps in clusters of <e>erythrocytes</e>. The assessment was also carried out in terms of precision and recall and combined in the F-measure providing results generally in the range of 92% to 97% for a variety of smears. In this context the observed trade-off relation between precision and recall guaranteed stable results. Finally, relating the F-measure with the degree of cell overlaps, showed that up to 50% total cell overlap can be tolerated if the smear image is well-focused and the smear itself adequately stained. CONCLUSION: The automatic analysis has proven to be comparable with manual evaluations in terms of accuracy. Moreover, the test results have shown that the proposed comparison-based approach, by exploiting the interrelation between different images and color channels, has successfully overcome most of the inherent limitations possibly occurring during the sample preparation and image acquisition phase. Eventually, this can be seen as an opportunity for developing low-cost solutions for mass screening.",M2
18220727,"The effect of Cannabis sativa L. (hemp seed) on hematological parameters in guinea pigs.The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of ingestion of powder of hemp seed on blood picture. This study was experienced on five guinea pigs that fed with normal diet (fresh vegetable and tab water), in addition were force-fed 5 g/kg/day of the powder of hemp seed for 60 days by means of an endogastric tube and syringe. At the beginning day and the termination of study day-60 the blood was taken from animals and the erythrocyte number, leukocyte number, packed cell volume (PCV), and hemoglobin concentration values were determined. The result on analysis showed that erythrocyte-count and PCV significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.05) whereas hemoglobin concentration and leukocyte number values showed a steady decline which was not significant (P &gt; 0.05). None of the values fell below the normal physiological range of the experimental animals. This shows that hemp seed which contains tetrahydrocannabinols as its active constituents has long term significant toxicological implication such as bone marrow suppression with respect to the concentration given on the <e>erythrocytes</e> of mammals. It is recommended that individuals who have anemia or immunity complication should not use hemp seed in their food preparation on regular basis.",M2
18213689,"Low insulin-like growth factor I and leukopenia in anorexia nervosa.OBJECTIVE: Considering that leukopenia and anemia are commonly observed in anorexia nervosa (AN) and that growth hormone (GH) and insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) markedly influence the activation, growth and survival of hemopoietic cells, we sought for possible relationships between hematologic parameters and the GH-IGF-I axis in a group of patients with AN. METHOD: Twenty patients were studied. Leukocyte and erythrocyte counts, as well as baseline serum GH levels and IGF-I standard deviation score (SDS) values, were determined in each participant and correlations between parameters were searched. RESULTS: Leukocyte and erythrocyte counts, as well as IGF-I SDS values, were significantly lower, conversely GH was significantly higher in AN patients than in normal weight participants. In patients, IGF-I SDS values were positively correlated with leukocyte count and BMI, whereas no correlation was found between IGF-I SDS and hemoglobin or <e>erythrocytes</e>. CONCLUSION: The demonstration of a positive correlation between leukocyte number and circulating IGF-I in AN suggests a likely pathogenetic role of IGF-I deficiency in this hematologic abnormality.",M2
17514929,"[Current recommendations for the treatment of iron deficiency anemia]Iron deficiency is a frequent complication in chronically ill patients and in pregnant women. Iron status can now be characterised precisely and relatively easily by determining serum ferritin, transferritin saturation and if necessary hypochromic <e>erythrocytes</e> and the haemoglobin content of erythrocytes (CHr). Oral iron replacement is usually restricted by limited absorption and low tolerability. Intravenous iron therapy is possible in such cases and can be combined with rHuEPO (e.g. EPREX/ epoetin alfa) in severe cases. Iron saccharate (VENOFER) is commercially available in Switzerland and this permits high dose iron replacement without any danger of anaphylaxis or acute iron toxicity.",M2
17343202,"[Identification of fetal nucleated <e>erythrocytes</e> in maternal blood using short tandem repeat typing after primer extension preamplification]OBJECTIVE: To develop a method for identifying fetal nucleated erythrocytes (NRBCs) in maternal blood. METHODS: NRBCs in maternal blood were detected by benzidine staining and collected by micromanipulation. After primer extension preamplification (PEP) of the entire genome from a single NRBC, short tandem repeat (STR) genotype was analysed after further amplification of this gene. Single NRBC was differentiated as fetal or maternal origin by comparison of STR genotype of NRBC with its corresponding parents. RESULTS: NRBCs were found in all of 28 pregnant women in a range of 4 to 13 per 5 ml venous blood. About 43. 6% of NRBCs were determined to be fetal origin by STR typing. CONCLUSION: This method provides effective identification of fetal NRBCs and allows non-invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis using single fetal NRBC.",M2
17321771,"Effect of high levels of dietary vitamin C on the blood responses of matrinx√£ (Brycon amazonicus).Juvenile matrinx√£ (Brycon amazonicus) were fed with different dietary vitamin C (ascorbic acid or AA) concentrations for 2 months in order to evaluate its effect on the physiological condition of this species. Five treatments were tested: Reference diet-RD (350 mg AA kg(-1) and 45% crude protein commercial feed); C400, C500, C600 and C800 with supplementation of 400, 500, 600 and 800 mg AA kg(-1). Fish fed 800 mg AA kg(-1) supplemented diets presented greater weight gain and survival. Hematocrit, hemoglobin concentrations and <e>erythrocytes</e> showed significant increase (p&lt;0.05) in C600 and C800 relatively to the others. Total leukocyte values were significantly higher in fish fed vitamin C supplemented diets relatively to those fed RD and leukocytes count of C600 and C800 were the highest among the treatments. Monocytes were the only cells of fish defense mechanism that presented variation, and C600 and C800 presented the lowest values (P&lt;0.05). Glucose level was significantly different relatively to RD only in C400 and the plasmatic total protein values for fish fed vitamin C supplemented diets were higher than for fish fed the RD. Fish plasmatic ions (Na(+) and Cl(-)) were significantly lower for C500, C600 and C800 relatively to C400 and RD. The physiological profile and the growth performance of matrinx√£ suggest that diet supplemented with 800 mg AA kg(-1) can improve its performance and increase the survival rate.",M2
17188915,"Red blood cell senescence and neocytolysis in humans after high altitude acclimatization.A selective lysis of relatively young <e>erythrocytes</e> (neocytolysis), together with a decrease of erythropoietin (EPO) production, has been described in polycythemic, high altitude acclimatized climbers, after descent to sea level, and in astronauts, soon after exposure to weightlessness (Alfrey CP, Rice L, Udden MM, Driscoll TB. Neocytolysis may represent the physiological down-regulation of red-cell mass. Lancet 349 (1997) 1389-90). To study neocytolysis, we analysed blood samples drawn from 4 mountain climbers at sea level before and after 53 days of high altitude acclimatization (&gt; or = 4500 m). After a 6-day descent to sea level, erythropoietin (EPO) plasma levels were lower than before high altitude acclimatization (mean values: 2.5+/-3.3 versus 10+/-4.5 mIU/ml, p &lt; 0.05). Red blood cell (RBC) populations were separated into low, middle and high density subsets, which, by physical and phenotypical criteria, were characterized as young, middle-aged and old. RBC membrane molecules CD55 and CD59 along with phosphatydylserine and CD47 were measured. The former are partially lost during RBC aging. The latter are involved in the triggering or inhibition of RBC phagocytosis by macrophages. Immunofluorescence and flow cytometry were done on each density subset. Young and middle-aged RBCs largely disappeared after descent from high altitude (from 4.50% (+/-3.10) and 66% (+/-6.90) to 0.19% (+/-0.07) and 1.90% (+/-0.50), respectively). Simultaneously, there was a dramatic increase of high density RBCs (from 29.50% (+/-7) to 97.90% (+/-2.00)). Furthermore, the remaining young and middle-aged RBCs had acquired a senescent-like phenotype, which may account for their increased susceptibility to phagocytosis.",M2
17177647,"Erythropoietin in cardiorenal anemia syndrome.Incidents of heart and renal failure (HF, RF) together, are increasing in our country and all over the world, so a great attention has been dedicated to this problem recently. These diseases together have shown bad results because of the process of accelerated arteriosclerosis, structural changes of myocardium, oxidative stress, inflammation, increased activities of sympathetic nervous system (SNS), increased activities of a renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) (1). These factors are crucial in the development of patho-physiological process and consequential development of anemia, that together with heart and renal failure through interaction, cause serious disorder that we call the cardio-renal anemia syndrome (2). We examined effects of erythropoietin (Epoetin beta) at 90 (60 men and 30 women) pre-dialysed and dialysed patients with HF signs during a period of three years in individual dozes of 2000-6000 units subcutaneous (sc) weekly. Using computer S PLUS and SAS multiple variant analysis we have got correlations by Pearson. Epoetin beta significantly develops anemia parameters: number of <e>erythrocytes</e> (r=0.51779; p&lt;0.0001), hemoglobin (r=0.38811; p&lt;0.0002), MCV (r=0.59876; p&lt;0.0001) at patients with HF. Positive effects are seen at NYHA class (r=0.59906; p&lt;0.0001), on quality of life before and after prescribing medicine. Parameters of renal functions are improving: more urea (r =0.45557; p&lt;0.0001) than creatinine (r=0.26397; p&lt;0.00119) and potassium values K(+)) are not changed significantly (r=0.02060; p&lt;0.8471). Epoetin beta has been useful in treatment of pre-dialysed and dialysed patients with HF and anemia by improving functional ability of myocardium and quality of life.",M2
17157987,"Hematological changes during the course of canine babesiosis caused by large Babesia in domestic dogs in Warsaw (Poland).In the presented study we evaluated the hematological changes in samples of blood obtained from 248 dogs naturally infected with large Babesia. The evaluation included red blood cell count, hemoglobin concentration, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), leucocyte counts, thrombocyte counts, mean platelet volume (MPV), morphology of <e>erythrocytes</e> and leucogram. The most common disorders in affected dogs were thrombocytopenia and anisocytosis. The count of erythrocytes below reference values was detected in 26.2% of dogs and 31.4% of affected animals presented hematocrit below the reference values. Hemoglobin concentration below the reference values was noted in 29% of dogs, an increase of MCHC above normal values was detected in 21% of examinated dogs and MCV below normal values was recognized in 2% of dogs. 60.5% of dogs presented anisocytosis, 25% poikilocytosis, 23.8% polychromasia, 19.7% hypochromia and 4.4% erythroblastosis. Thrombocytopenia was detected in 99.5% of dogs, but only 15.3% of examined animals showed increase of MPV, which suggests a response of the bone marrow. 36.3% of dogs had neutropenia, and 21.8% presented a left shift, 14.9% had the lymphocytosis and 7.2% lymphopenia.",M2
17153700,"Immune response of mice infested by Hyalomma dromedarii ticks infected with entomopathogenic nematodes.In the present work, the total leucocytes count of infested mice with ticks Hyalomma dromedarii infected with nematodes showed significant increase than infested group with ticks only.

The results showed a highly significant decrease in Hb concentration, and HCT percentage for mice infested with ticks and a marked increase with ticks infected with nematodes. The results showed a significant decrease in level of IgG of mice infested with ticks, while in infested mice with ticks and nematodes, the IgG level increased to control level which might indicated that nematodes penetrate ticks that were feeding on mice through the thinner cuticle of engorging females. Differences in cytokines responses were observed between tick-infested and non-infested mice. Proinflammatory Thl T lymphocyte cytokines were suppressed and Th2 cytokines were enhanced for infestation with H. dromedarii. The data indicated a polarization of immune response towards Th2 lymphocytes.",M2
17086554,"WIP null mice display a progressive immunological disorder that resembles Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome.The Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome (WAS) is an X-linked immunodeficiency syndrome caused by mutations in the WAS protein (WASP). This participates in signalling and cytoskeletal homoeostasis, and some of its activities are regulated by its binding to the WASP interacting protein (WIP). WIP deficiency, however, has not yet been shown to be of pathological significance in humans. Here we show that, in WIP null (WIP(-/-)) mice, it produces haematological alterations and anatomical abnormalities in several organs, most probably as a consequence of autoimmune attacks. Granulocytosis and severe lymphopenia are associated with a proportional increase in segmented cells and fewer bone marrow <e>erythrocytes</e> and lymphocytes. Splenomegaly is accompanied by an increase of haematopoietic tissue and red pulp, reduction of the white pulp, and fewer B (B220(+)) lymphocytes (also apparent in the lymph nodes and Peyer's patches). Ulcerative colitis, interstitial pneumonitis, glomerular nephropathy with IgA deposits, autoantibodies, and joint inflammation are also evident. These progressive immunological disorders closely mimic those seen in WAS. WIP deficiency may thus be implicated in some cases in which mutations in the gene encoding WASP are not detected.",M2
16982150,"The pathogenesis of anaemia in goats experimentally infected with Trypanosoma congolense or Trypanosoma brucei: use of the myeloid:erythroid ratio.The present study examined the development of anaemia in Small East African goats experimentally infected with Trypanosoma congolense or Trypanosoma brucei. Experimental goats received a primary trypanosome challenge on day 0, treated with diminazene aceturate on day 49 and received a secondary trypanosome challenge on day 77 of the 136-day experiment. Both primary and secondary challenges were characterised by reduced peripheral erythrocyte counts, fall in packed cell volume (PCV), hypohaemoglobinaemia and reductions in the myeloid:erythroid ratios (M:E) compared with the uninfected goats. The progressive reduction in the M:E ratios denoted increased erythrogenesis in response to increased destruction of <e>erythrocytes</e> in blood by infecting trypanosomes or their products. The more rapid fall in M:E ratio in T. congolense infections shows that this parasite causes more severe clinical pathological effects in goats than T. brucei.",M2
16936106,"Hemorheologic abnormalities associated with HIV infection: altered erythrocyte aggregation and deformability.PURPOSE: To investigate possible alterations of erythrocyte aggregation and deformability, which are factors that can influence blood flow, in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected individuals and to determine whether these factors are related to the severity of immunodeficiency. METHODS: Laboratory evaluations were performed on 46 HIV-infected individuals and 44 HIV-negative control subjects. Current and nadir (lowest previous) CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts were identified for each subject. Erythrocyte aggregation was measured using a fully automatic erythrocyte aggregometer. Factors related to erythrocyte aggregation were also determined: erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), zeta sedimentation ratio (ZSR), and plasma fibrinogen levels. Erythrocyte deformability was observed at various fluid shear stress levels, with a laser diffraction ektacytometer. Correlations were sought between each of these measures and current or nadir CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts, and each measure was compared between three subgroups based on current and nadir CD4+ T-lymphocyte counts (severely immunosuppressed, immune reconstituted, never severely immunosuppressed). RESULTS: The following parameters were significantly different between HIV-infected subjects and controls: increased erythrocyte aggregation, at stasis (P &lt; 0.001) and low shear stress (P &lt; 0.001), increased ESR (P &lt; 0.001), increased ZSR (P &lt; 0.028), increased serum fibrinogen (P = 0.015), and decreased erythrocyte deformability (P &lt; 0.001). Only erythrocyte aggregation at stasis correlated significantly with current CD4+ T-lymphocyte count (r = - 0.344, P = 0.022). None of the parameters was significantly different between HIV-infected subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: Increased aggregation and decreased deformability of <e>erythrocytes</e> are associated with HIV-infection regardless of the severity of immunodeficiency. HIV-infected individuals may be at risk for progressive retinal microvascular damage from persistent hemorheologic abnormalities, despite immune reconstitution associated with potent antiretroviral drug therapies.",M2
16899916,"Whole blood viscosity and erythrocyte hematometric indices in chronic heroin addicts.Whole blood viscosity (WBV) and hematometric indices of <e>erythrocytes</e> as red blood cell count (RBC), mean erythrocyte volume (MCV), hemoglobin (HGB), hematocrit (HCT), mean hemoglobin content of erythrocytes (MCH), HGB/HCT values (MCHC) and red blood cell distribution width (RDW) have been studied in a group of 15 chronic opioid addicts under methadone maintenance therapy with mean age 26.53 +/- 7.34 years. WBV elevation and changes in MCV, HGB, HCT, RDW were found in intravenous drug users compared to healthy individuals. As well, RBC was decreased leading to an increase in MCH and MCHC values. Correlation analysis suggested that the correlation among the RBC, HGB, HCT and WBV was the closest. Heroin macrocytosis (heroin macrocytic anemia) was established, related with the increased RDW in chronic heroin abusers. The results are in accordance with data revealing abnormal effects of alcohol and other drugs on whole blood rheology and hematometric/morphometric characteristics of erythrocytes.",M2
16899519,"Macroalbuminuria is a better risk marker than low estimated GFR to identify individuals at risk for accelerated GFR loss in population screening.Macroalbuminuria, erythrocyturia, and impaired renal function are strong predictors of poor renal outcome in patients with known renal disease. However, the yield of mass screening for these variables to identify individuals who are at risk for GFR loss is yet unknown in a Western population. With the use of data from the Prevention of Renal and Vascular End-Stage Disease (PREVEND) study, a prospective, population-based cohort study, the cardiovascular and renal prognosis was investigated in patients with classical renal risk markers: Macroalbuminuria (&gt; or =300 mg albumin/24 h urine), erythrocyturia (&gt; or =250 <e>erythrocytes</e>/L, without leukocyturia), and impaired renal function (both 24-h creatinine clearance and Modification of Diet in Renal Disease clearance below the fifth percentile of age- and gender-matched control subjects). The 8592 patients who were included in this study were followed for a 4-yr period. We identified 134 patients with macroalbuminuria, 128 with erythrocyturia, and 103 with impaired renal function. There was only a little overlap among the three groups. The prevalence of macroalbuminuria, erythrocyturia, and impaired renal function was calculated to be in the general population 0.6, 1.3, and 0.9%, respectively. In all three groups, fewer than 30% of patients were known to have this laboratory abnormality before screening. The incidence of cardiovascular disease was high in the macroalbuminuria group (e.g., the age- and gender-adjusted hazard ratio for mortality as a result of cardiovascular disease is 2.6 [1.1 to 6.0]) and for the impaired renal function group (3.4 [1.5 to 8.0]). After a mean follow-up of 4.2 yr, the macroalbuminuria group showed a -7.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2 estimated GFR (eGFR) loss, compared with -2.3 ml/min per 1.73 m2 in the control group (difference P &lt; 0.001), whereas the rate of eGFR loss in the impaired renal function group (-0.2 ml/min per 1.73 m2; P = 0.18) and the erythrocyturia group (-2.6 ml/min per 1.73 m2) was not different from the control group. Macroalbuminuria and impaired renal function both predict a worse prognosis with respect to cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. However, macroalbuminuria is a better risk marker than low eGFR or erythrocyturia to identify in population screening of individuals who are at risk for accelerated GFR loss.",M2
16572370,"Comparison of hematologic data in world elite junior speed skaters and in non-athletic juniors.During the world junior speed skating championship 2002 all athletes (60 males, 56 females) were subjected to hematologic blood testing one day before the competition as requested by International Skating Union--ISU. This study aimed to obtain hematological reference values for junior athletes, whilst the influence of endurance training on hematologic variables of young athletes was studied. Hematologic results of athletes were compared to results of non-athletes matched by age and gender (14 males, 17 females). The blood analysis was done on an ADVIA 120. To compare measurement of ferritin, erythropoietin, and soluble transferrin receptor in serum as well as in EDTA-plasma, serum and EDTA-blood was obtained from the control group. In hemoglobin and hematocrit we found no significant difference between the two groups, whereas the number of <e>erythrocytes</e> was lower in athletes. The mean corpuscular volume was higher in athletes, whilst the corpuscular hemoglobin content was only marginally higher in athletes than in non-athletes. Consequently corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mean was lower in athletes than in non-athletes. There was no difference of erythropoietin and soluble transferrin receptor, whilst in ferritin we found a difference between the groups. Endurance training does not change the values of hemoglobin and hematocrit. Increased mean corpuscular volume and decreased corpuscular hemoglobin concentration mean could be a result of changed properties of red blood cell-membrane caused by acidosis and higher osmolality during the training. In junior athletes we did not find an iron overload as described in some adult athletes.",M2

In our study the effect of 1-h ischemia-reperfusion with or without allopurinol pretreatment on hematological parameters and red blood cell deformability was investigated in a follow-up experiment of 26 male CD outbred rats that were subjected to unilateral hind-limb ischemia by microvascular clips on femoral vessels for 1 h (IR, n = 6), some rats received allopurinol pretreatment under the same conditions (50 mg/kg, AP + IR, n = 8), others were subjected to sham operation (n = 6), and the rest of animals served as control (n = 6). Measurement of erythrocyte deformability using a bulk filtrometer with special setting of cell suspension hematocrit (1%), and determination of hematological parameters were performed daily for one week. In the IR group, relative cell transit time increased significantly on postoperative days 1 and 2, which was not observed in the other groups. Settings for the measurement of erythrocyte deformability by reducing the blood sample volume gave the possibility of monitoring the resulting changes in rats. Mean corpuscular volume and hemoglobin, platelet count, and platelet volume were higher in the IR and AP + IR groups than in the other groups. In summary, short-term ischemia and reperfusion induced lower red blood cell deformability in the early postoperative period, which could be prevented by allopurinol pretreatment.",M2
16513546,"Evaluation of hypochromic <e>erythrocytes</e> in combination with sTfR-F index for predicting response to r-HuEPO in anemic patients with multiple myeloma.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the sTfR-F index and hypochromic erythrocytes (HYPO%) as potential predictors of response to recombinant human erythropoietin (r-HuEPO) of anemic patients with multiple myeloma (MM) before treatment, as well as early in the course of treatment. Twenty-six newly diagnosed anemic MM patients received r-HuEPO 30,000 IU/wk sc, for six weeks. The sTfR-F index and HYPO% were determined at baseline and at weeks 2 and 6. Patients were classified in 1 of 4 categories of a diagnostic plot, according to erythropoietic state (ES I-IV), defined by the combination of sTfR-F index and HYPO%. Sixteen of 20 patients in ES I and II before treatment responded to r-HuEPO, whereas none of the 6 patients in ES III and IV responded (P &lt; .001). At week 2, 44% of patients who responded and 60% of the nonresponders were in functional iron deficiency (FID) and the proportion increased to 69% and 80%, respectively, by week 6. Seven of the patients who did not respond received in addition 200 mg iron sucrose IV weekly, for the next 4 weeks, and 6 of them responded. These results suggest that combination of sTfR-F index and HYPO% in a diagnostic plot can be used as a predictive model to recognize patients who will benefit from r-HuEPO and identify FID requiring iron supplementation, before treatment and early in the course of treatment, contributing thus to optimization of r-HuEPO therapy.",M2

In total, there were eight groups of animals: splenectomy, autotransplantation, sham, and untreated controls at both time points. We used the spleen-apron method of Furka et al. (Khirurgiia (Mosk) 1989;9:125-127), inserting five spleen chips into the greater omentum, for autotransplantation. Quantitative and qualitative blood cell counts and the phagocytic activity of cells (stimulated with zymosan) were determined. In splenectomized animals, the number of neutrophils significantly increased 8 months after surgery. The greatest phagocytic activity of neutrophils, however, was observed in autotransplanted animals of the same age. In splenectomized animals, erythrocyte volumes were significantly higher in the second postoperative month, but normalized by the eighth month. In conclusion, spleen autotransplantation has some beneficial effects, including clearing erythrocytes and preserving the phagocytic activity of neutrophils in peripheral blood.",M2

16110233,"Dependence of Mini-Nutritional Assessment scores with age and some hematological variables in elderly institutionalized patients.BACKGROUND: Nutritional imbalance is a serious problem in developing countries, especially for the older population, which makes simple and rapid instruments for nutritional evaluation very necessary in order to have a detailed picture of the undernutrition epidemiology in those places. OBJECTIVE: This work aimed to evaluate the nutritional status of elderly institutionalized patients by use of the Mini-Nutritional Assessment (MNA) test and compare the MNA scores with some hematological variables. METHODS: We performed a cross-sectional study in elderly institutionalized patients (153) of all nursing homes in the Brazilian city of Uberl√¢ndia, using the MNA questionnaire and quantitative analysis of <e>erythrocytes</e>, hematocrit, hemoglobin, serum iron and transferrin. The subjects were classified by gender, nutritional state and age range. The nutritional categories were compared by analysis of variance and the dependence between the considered variables was tested with the Spearman correlation analysis. RESULTS: 60% of the subjects were female. The average age was 74.6 +/- 9.5 and 78.5 +/- 9.5 years for male and female individuals, respectively. 18.3% of the patients presented undernutrition, 45.7% presented risk of undernutrition, and 36.0% were well nourished. These three nutritional categories showed statistically significant differences among the MNA scores, age and all the hematological parameters, for the sum of both genders, but not for the age, iron and transferrin values of the male individuals and hematocrit and hemoglobin values of the female patients. Significant differences between genders were not observed only for the MNA and transferrin values. MNA values presented positive correlations with erythrocytes, hematocrit, hemoglobin, and serum iron levels, and also a negative correlation with age, which was attributed to a worsening of the nutritional state with age. CONCLUSION: Based on the MNA, 64% of the elderly institutionalized patients of Uberl√¢ndia presented risk of undernutrition and undernutrition, and their nutritional state is aggravating with the age increase, which is consistent with the age-dependent decrease observed in some hematological variables. Since the low MNA scores were not necessarily associated to subnormal mean values of the hematological variables, we can conclude that the low MNA values are predicting situations that still did not manifest pathologically in those variables.",M2
16099081,"Radiobiological monitoring of striped field mouse populations in the Moscow recreation forest  Kuzminki .The results of radiometric and haematological studies of striped field mice (Apodemus agrarius) sampled over the years 1995-2003 from the territory of the preserved radioactive waste burial (RWB), which is located in the Moscow recreation forest  Kuzminki , are presented and discussed in the paper. It was shown that the level of 90Sr-90Y content in mice sampled from the RWB area varies within the range of 0-1200 Bq/kg with an average of 98.7+/-21.5 Bq/kg. The content of 90Sr-90Y in the body of 80% of the mice sampled from the RWB area was below 100 Bq/kg. Only in 4% of the sampled mice, the 90Sr-90Y specific radioactivity was above 300 Bq/kg.

15978266,"The effect of repeated acute mental stress on habituation and recovery responses in hemoconcentration and blood cells in healthy men.Acute mental stress elicits hemoconcentration and polycytosis. We investigated whether haematological response to repeated acute mental stress would habituate and be sustained 45 min and 105 min after stress. Twenty-four men underwent a 13-min stressor three times, one week apart; hematological variables were measured at week one and three. Hematocrit, hemoglobin, leukocytes, lymphocytes, <e>erythrocytes</e>, and thrombocytes all increased from rest to immediately post-stress (p's&lt;.001). After 105 min of recovery, leukocytes and platelets both were higher, and hematocrit, hemoglobin, lymphocytes, and erythrocytes were all lower than at rest (p's&lt;.001 to &lt;.05). At all time points, hematocrit (p=.005) and erythrocytes (p=.006) were lower at week three than at week one. In contrast to an attenuation in systolic blood pressure increase from rest to immediately post-stress (p&lt;.001), and in cortisol recovery from immediately post-stress to 45 min post-stress (p&lt;.001), the magnitude of change in hemoconcentration and cell counts in stress and recovery experienced no habituation. Adjustment for stress-induced plasma volume shift altered findings: Elevated leukocytes post-stress persisted at 105 min (p&lt;.001); any changes in lymphocytes became insignificant; erythrocytes decreased from rest to post-stress (p&lt;.001) to increase again during recovery (p's&lt;.05); platelets increased linearly between rest and 105 min of recovery (p=.005). We conclude that the magnitude of changes in hemoconcentration and blood cells during acute mental stress and recovery failed to habituate to stress repeats and, in part, sustained up to 105 min. Plasma volume shift accompanying stress affects the time course of stress polycytosis.",M2

No serious side effects occured is all treated patients. In conclusion, treatment of G-CSF in combination with EPO is effective for patients with MDS.",M2
15828854,"Pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic and time-to-event models of ribavirin-induced anaemia in chronic hepatitis C.BACKGROUND: Interferon (IFN)-alpha and ribavirin combination therapy is the standard treatment for patients with chronic hepatitis C. However, ribavirin induces anaemia, especially by haemolysis, an adverse effect that is dose-limiting. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the relationships between ribavirin exposure and haemoglobin time-course, the time-to-anaemia and the covariates influencing these relationships in a population of patients treated for chronic hepatitis C. In addition, we also intended to establish a simple rule defining the need for dosage adjustment, using data obtained during the first month of treatment. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 99 patients treated with IFNalpha plus ribavirin, with known dosage administration history, liver biopsy, demographic data, red blood cell counts, haemoglobin level (1037 measurements, median 10 per patient, range 2-31) and serum creatinine during the entire treatment period (178 days, range 53-382 days) was conducted. The data were analysed by a pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic population model and Weibull time-to-anaemia model. The rule defining the need for dosage adjustment was as follows: adjustment was needed if haemoglobin at steady state (H(ss)), estimated by the Bayesian method based on data obtained during the first month of treatment, was &lt;12 g/dL for men or &lt;11 g/dL for women. RESULTS: In both models, anaemia was related to the exposure of <e>erythrocytes</e> to ribavirin at time t (RT in mg/kg/day) by a maximum effect model, with RT(50) (dosage administration rate at which half the maximal effect is reached) approximately 12 mg/kg/day, and the significant covariates were initial haemoglobin level and bodyweight. Performances of a Bayesian prediction of H(ss) based on two early haemoglobin level measurements were encouraging (mean prediction error 0.12 g/dL, precision 0.85 g/dL). The proposed rule for the need of dosage adjustment was able to predict the actual evolution of the dosage regimen in 76% of non-adapted patients and 69% of adapted patients. CONCLUSION: The current guidelines for ribavirin dosage administration, based on bodyweight, are adequate, at least in the 45-105 kg range. Results indicate that Bayesian therapeutic monitoring could be helpful in controlling ribavirin-induced anaemia.",M2

(our experience with administration of intravenous iron to pregnant women and young mothers)]PURPOSE: To study the effect of intravenous administration of the iron-containing medicine Venofer to pregnant women and young mothers with anaemic syndrome. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A 2-year prospective study was conducted to 50 pregnant women and young mothers, which were treated for iron deficiency anemia in First Obstetrical Clinic of University Hospital - Pleven. There were 27 pregnant women (gestational age 24-39 g. w.) and 23 young mothers. A treatment with Venofer was conducted following 5 ampules regimen of administration--1st day 3 amps and 2d day--2 amps. Venofer is a stabile iron-sucrose complex designed for intravenous application. It is a structural analogue of feritine. Control studies of haemoglobin (Hb) and <e>erythrocytes</e> (Er) were made on 6-7 day after the therapy. RESULTS AND COMMENT: The pregnant women had average starting Hb-data of 90.74 g/l and after the therapy--106.19 g/l. The increase was of 15.74 g/l. Young mothers had Hb-data before the therapy 88.04 g/l and after the therapy 104.5 g/l. The mean increase of Hb was of 16.46 g/l. Undesired side reactions were observed only in one pregnant woman and that necessitated the stop of therapy. Intravenous administration of iron contributed to the good, normal course of pregnancy and fetal growth, and the effect to young mothers consisted of quick and certain recovery of their general state without accomplishing haemotransfusion. CONCLUSION: Therapy with iron-containing medicine gives a good opportunity to avoid the risk of haemotransfusional infections, incopatible haemotransfusions and immunocompromizing effect of allogene haemotransfusion. It is also economically more beneficial.",M2
15654559,"Testing for acanthocytosis A prospective reader-blinded study in movement disorder patients.The presence of acanthocytosis in peripheral blood smears remains the hallmark of the clinical diagnosis of most neuroacanthocytosis syndromes, such as chorea-acanthocytosis (ChAc) and McLeod syndrome. Genetic analyses and/or specific laboratory tests are available only for a minority of these disorders. Testing for acanthocytosis is hampered by the lack of data on normal amounts of acanthocytes assessed by a standardized method. We report a prospective reader-blinded study designed to establish control values for abnormally shaped <e>erythrocytes</e> in healthy volunteers and patients with movement disorders (MDs) using light microscopic assessment of erythrocyte morphology in standard EDTA and isotonically diluted blood samples. We investigated a total of 100 patients fulfilling clinical criteria of specific MDs, 31 patients with MDs not matching any clinical criteria, and 37 healthy controls. In patients with diagnosed MDs and healthy controls, acanthocytes in dry blood smears were significantly more frequent following isotonic dilution compared with standard EDTA blood. In unfixed wet blood preparations of both EDTA blood and isotonically diluted blood, acanthocyte levels were significantly higher than in standard dry blood smear preparations. There were no statistical differences of acanthocyte levels in all test conditions between diagnosed MDs and healthy volunteers. There was no significant correlation of acanthocyte levels in all blood samples and preparations with age, sex or diagnosis. Thus, normal values were defined as the 99th percentile of combined results of the two groups of volunteers. Diluted blood combined with wet blood preparation showed high specificity (0.98) and the highest sensitivity of all test procedures (all genetically confirmed ChAc patients were detected). The reported method is cheap, readily available, and provides high specificity and sensitivity in respect to clinically relevant acanthocytosis. The use of isotonically diluted blood samples combined with unfixed wet blood preparation with a normal range of &lt;6.3% of total erythrocytes is recommended to search for significant acanthocytosis in movement disorders.",M2
15476484,"Initial blood washout during organ procurement determines liver injury and function after preservation and reperfusion.Organ procurement is the first step toward effective liver preservation and comprises a thorough washout of blood components from the microvasculature. To study the efficacy of optimal blood washout of the liver, three groups were compared including low-pressure perfusion with UW-CSS (12 mmHg, group A), which is the routine method in clinical practice, high-pressure perfusion with UW-CSS (100 mmHg, group B) and low-pressure perfusion with modified UW solution (12 mmHg, group C). After procurement all livers were preserved in original UW-CSS for 0, 24 or 48 h, followed by reperfusion in oxygenated Williams Medium E for 24 h at 37 degrees C. Histology results of livers procured in group A, showed good hepatocyte viability but also remaining <e>erythrocytes</e>. However, injury parameters were high and ATP concentrations were low. No functional differences were found. Group B, high pressure, and group C, modified UW-CSS, both showed better results. High-pressure washout is preferable since the warm ischemia time during procurement is short. We propose to use high-pressure UW-CSS perfusion for the initial blood washout of the donor liver instead of the usually used low-pressure washout.",M2

14687986,"Lhx2 expression in hematopoietic progenitor/stem cells in vivo causes a chronic myeloproliferative disorder and altered globin expression.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Chronic myeloproliferative disorders (CMDs) are thought to be due to mutation(s) in a single clone at the level of the hematopoietic stem cell (HSC). Such mutations and additional mutations causing progression of the disease are largely unknown. Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is a CMD characterized by a chromosomal translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22 creating the fusion protein BCR-ABL. This translocation has also been suggested to cause mis-expression of the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx2 in hematopoietic cells. We have previously shown that Lhx2 expression in mouse HSC generates cytokine-dependent stem cell-like cell lines that can produce long-term repopulation in stem cell-deficient mice. DESIGN AND METHODS: Since the consequences of Lhx2 expression in hematopoietic cells in vivo were unknown, mice engrafted with the stem cell-like cell lines were analyzed in detail for any pathologic changes. RESULTS: Expression of Lhx2 was maintained in vivo and most engrafted mice developed a myeloproliferative disorder characterized by splenomegaly, extramedullary hematopoiesis and anemia. The disorder was transplantable and the Lhx2-expressing cells could also cause acute leukemia. The anemia was due to both a reduced number of circulating <e>erythrocytes</e> and a reduced mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC). INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: These observations suggest that constitutive expression of Lhx2 in hematopoietic cells causes CMD, and also that a novel cell-autonomous mechanism can contribute to anemia.",M2

Glomectomy results in decreasing calorigecic effect of noradrenaline. Compensatory increase of thermoregulatory activity of sceletal muscles in response to beta-adrenogenic blocade with inderal in post-glomectomic animals is authentically less, than before inactivation of carotid receptors. In animals after carotid glomectomy resistance to acute hypoxia is clearly reduced. True reduction of number of <e>erythrocytes</e>, of hemoglobin concentration, of hematocrite parameter in post glomectic animals was found, which indicates anemisation phenomena. It was found that glomectomy after adaptation of animals in the mountains of Tien Shan at the height of 3200 m during 30 days didn't substantively change resistance to acute hypoxia. Resistance to acute hypoxia of animals living on mountains (susliks, marmots) is higher than of animals living on plains. Glomectomy performed on animals living on mountain resulted in an insignificant decrease in resistance to acute hypoxia. Resistance to acute hypoxia in postglomectic animals was found to be directly linked with absolute amount of hemoglobin concentration and erythrocyte number. In that way denervation of sinocarotid reflexogenic zones and bilateral glomectomy is an adequate method of comparative research of functions regulation mechanism during formation of adaptive responses in animals in dependence of various factors of external environment in norm, as well, as in pathology.",M2

METHODS: Prior to thrombolysis with rt-PA, the attenuation values of vascular occlusions were determined with a helical MSCT using a collimation of 0.5 mm. We examined 5 patients that were 63 - 79 years old. With the help of reference values that were obtained from a phantom study we categorised the vascular occlusions according to their attenuation values as being mixed thrombi with low or high proportions of <e>erythrocytes</e>, or red thrombi. TOF angiographies were done before and after the thrombolytic therapy. RESULTS: The systemic therapy with rt-PA was effective in vascular occlusions that had attenuation values of red thrombi or of mixed thrombi with a high proportion of erythrocytes. The therapy showed no effect when the attenuation values matched with mixed thrombi with a low proportion of erythrocytes. Due to artefacts that were caused by beam hardening, attenuation measurements could not be performed in the posterior fossa. CONCLUSION: The presented cases are in accordance with the results of experimental studies which indicate that the efficacy of thrombolysis increases with the attenuation values of thromboembolic vascular occlusions. The predictive value of attenuation measurements by MSCT for the prognosis of systemic thrombolysis cannot be given yet.",M2
12873713,"Effect of exercise intensity and training on antioxidants and cholesterol profile in cyclists.The aim of this work was to evaluate the effect of different intensity of exercise and different training status on antioxidants and cholesterol profile in cyclists. 33 male cyclists (17 amateur and 16 professional cyclists) participated in this study. The amateurs all trained 14 +/- 1 h each week, and their VO(2) max was 62.5 +/- 1.8 ml/Kg x min; the professionals all trained 24 +/- 1 h each week, and their VO(2) max was 80.2 +/- 1.6 ml/Kg x min. Amateurs were submitted to the maximal and submaximal prolonged exercise tests. Professionals were submitted to a mountain stage (170 km) of cycling competition. Serum lipid and cholesterol profile (triglycerides, total cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol and VLDL-cholesterol) and plasma antioxidant capacity (ascorbic acid, alpha-tocopherol, retinol, beta-carotene and others) were measured before and after exercise tests. Hematological determinations (number of <e>erythrocytes</e>, hematocrit and hemoglobin concentration) and dietary intake were also measured. No significant differences were observed in basal values (before exercise tests) of amateur and professional cyclists. Negligible differences were found between dietary intake of amateur and professional cyclists, and also the results of hematological values showed there was no effect of degree of hydration or dietary intake on blood levels of studied antioxidant and lipid parameters. An increase in plasma levels of vitamin C, vitamin E, triglycerides and VLDL-cholesterol levels, and also a decrease of beta-carotene and LDL-cholesterol. were observed in well-trained professional cyclists after the cycling stage - an endurance exercise--but not in amateur cyclists. Amateur cyclists showed only mild increases in total cholesterol after maximal and submaximal exercise, while a rise in HDL-cholesterol was only observed after maximal exercise; none of these changes were observed in professional cyclists.

To elucidate whether erythropoiesis was affected by vitamin B12 deficiency in rats, these vitamin B12-deficient rats were exposed to hypoxia (10.5 % O2) to stimulate erythropoiesis. In the vitamin B12-sufficient control rats, erythrocyte count was significantly (P&lt;0.05) increased 1 week after starting the hypoxic exposure. However, the hypoxia-induced erythropoiesis was affected by vitamin B12 deficiency, and no significant increase in the erythrocyte count was observed even after 6-week exposure to hypoxia in the vitamin B12-deficient rats. In the vitamin B12-deficient rats in hypoxia, <e>erythrocytes</e> became abnormally enlarged, and haemoglobin concentration in peripheral blood was increased in proportion to the increase of mean corpuscular volume. However, the level of the increase in the haemoglobin concentration was significantly (P&lt;0.05) lower in the vitamin B12-deficient rats compared with that in the -sufficient controls. In addition, in the vitamin B12-deficient rats, in contrast to the -sufficient rats, serum erythropoietin concentration was not normalized even after 6-week exposure to hypoxia.

12651815,"Quantitative urine particle analysis: integrative approach for the optimal combination of automation with UF-100 and microscopic review with KOVA cell chamber.BACKGROUND: Automated systems have enabled the counting of particles in urine to be standardized. Their superiority over traditional sediment analysis has been well documented, but they have not gained wide acceptance. The reasons for this are that sediment analysis has been performed and interpreted for decades. Additionally, pathologic casts and other unknown particles still must be confirmed under the microscope. Furthermore, comparison between the methods has revealed outliers and thus decreased confidence in automation. METHODS: We used the standardized KOVA cell chamber system to count particles and compared the results with UF-100 flow cytometry as an alternative to traditional sediment analysis. RESULTS: We compared 252 randomly selected urine samples and obtained a review rate of 33%. Microscopic verification was necessary because of the presence of casts, yeast, sperm, dysmorphic <e>erythrocytes</e>, and some misclassified erythrocytes or leukocytes that were detected by incongruent dipstick results and abnormal scattergrams. We obtained correlation coefficients of 0.966 for erythrocytes and 0.935 for leukocytes. Criteria for an algorithm to identify samples that needed microscopic review were derived from comparisons between the number of particles from UF-100, dipstick results, cell chamber counting, and sediment analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Automated cell counting combined with microscopic counting with a standardized cell chamber system is useful. An objective algorithm for review criteria can be developed via systematic comparison of UF-100 flow cytometry and microscopy. Only urine samples that meet these criteria need to be confirmed microscopically.",M2

N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) and N-nitrosodiethylamine (NDEA) produced clearly positive, dose-dependent and reproducible results in this assay. NDMA revealed, in accordance with literature data, a much higher mutagenicity than NDEA. For both compounds the sensitivity of HETMN was to a large extent higher than published for the rodent micronucleus test, which is not capable of unequivocally identifying NDEA as positive. Additionally, NDEA induced severe anemia without obscuring the formation of micronucleated cells.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Urine samples were collected from 92 patients with newly diagnosed bladder cancer, 64 with idiopathic microhematuria and 42 with nephritis. Urine was analyzed for NMP22, BTA Stat, UBC and erythrocytes size using flow cytometry. Bladder wash cytology was done at cystoscopy. Urine was analyzed for microhematuria with hematuria dipsticks at home for 7 consecutive days immediately before the operation and in the hospital on the day of surgery. RESULTS: Sensitivity was 75% for NMP22, 78% for BTA Stat, 64% for UBC and 61% for flow cytometry at 73% specificity. Cytology had 42% sensitivity at 97% specificity. Tumor size, grade and stage had a statistically significant influence on NMP22, BTA Stat, UBC and cytology. Of the patients 75% had microhematuria on the day of the operation and 75% had hematuria at least 1 of 7 days when tested at home the last week before transurethral bladder resection. The 70% of all patients with macroscopic hematuria as the initial symptom did not seem to differ from those without the condition in tumor size, grade, stage or tumor marker levels. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry was not well enough able to distinguish patients with bladder cancer from controls. The sensitivity of all tested markers, including hematuria dipsticks, was high for large and high grade, high stage tumors. Further studies are needed to evaluate whether a marker could be used to determine priority among patients referred due to microhematuria.",M2

12195731,"Effects of lithium carbonate on hematopoietic cells in patients with persistent neutropenia following chemotherapy or radiotherapy.Neoplasm therapy is restricted by the haematological side effects of tumour-destructive therapy, requiring expensive supportive care to some extent to overcome and treat leucopenia and its consequences. An effective and very cost-effective alternative for treating neutropenia is to administer lithium carbonate. Lithium leads to a release of hematopoietic growth factors (CSF) and therefore to proliferation of neutrophil granulocytes. Normally, recombinant CSF is only administered when there are indications of severe neutropenia because of the high costs involved, all the more evident in the long-term treatment of persistent leucocytopenia. On the other hand, CSF and leucocytes play an essential role in tumour immunology and with regard to response rates to cytostatic drugs. Lithium salts have shown that they can increase the number of neutrophil granulocytes quite significantly and, to a lesser extent, the number of eosinophil granulocytes and lymphocytes as well. The average number of <e>erythrocytes</e> does not change significantly. Patient tolerability to lithium carbonate therapy is very good.

12171173,"Effect of preexisting FeLV infection or FeLV and feline immunodeficiency virus coinfection on pathogenicity of the small variant of Haemobartonella felis in cats.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of preexisting FeLV infection or FeLV and feline immunodeficiency (FIV) coinfection on the pathogenicity of the small variant of Haemobartonella felis (Hfsm, California variant) in cats. ANIMALS: 20 FeLV infected, 5 FeLV-FIV coinfected, and 19 retrovirus-free cats. PROCEDURES: A client-owned cat, coinfected with FeLV and Hfsm, was the source for Hfsm. Inoculum 1 (FeLV free) was obtained by passage of source Hfsm through 4 FeLV-resistant cats. Inoculum 2 was obtained by further passage of Hfsm (inoculum 1) through 2 specific pathogen-free cats. RESULTS: A mild-to-moderate anemia started 21 days after inoculation, with its nadir occurring at 35 to 42 days after inoculation. Infection with Hfsm induced greater decrease in hemoglobin concentration in FeLV infected cats, compared with retrovirus free cats. Reticulocytosis, macrocytosis, and polychromasia of <e>erythrocytes</e> developed in anemic cats regardless of retrovirus infection status. Mean neutrophil counts decreased during the hemolytic episode. For most cats, the anemia was transient. Four FeLV infected cats, 1 of which was also FIV infected, developed fatal FeLV-associated myeloproliferative diseases. Of the surviving cats, 8 died over the next 24 months from other FeLV-related diseases. Hemolysis did not recur after the initial episode. Inoculum 1 induced more severe anemia than inoculum 2. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Our results support the clinical observation that cats coinfected with FeLV and H felis develop more severe anemia than cats infected with H felis alone. Infection with Hfsm may induce myeloproliferative disease in FeLV infected cats. The small variant of H felis may lose pathogenicity by passage through FeLV-free cats.",M2
12167472,"Treatment with an adenosine uptake inhibitor attenuates glomerulonephritis in mice.This study evaluated the effects of KF24345 (3-[1-(6,7-diethoxy-2-morpholinoquinazolin-4-yl)piperidin-4-yl]-1,6-dimethyl-2,4(1H,3H)-quinazolinedione hydrochloride), a novel adenosine uptake inhibitor, on experimental glomerulonephritis induced in mice by two intravenous injections of rabbit anti-mouse glomerular basement membrane antiserum. Mice with glomerulonephritis showed continuous proteinuria and the histological evaluation revealed glomerular and tubular damage at 7 weeks after the first antiserum injection. KF24345 as well as prednisolone and cyclophosphamide significantly inhibited proteinuria and glomerular damage when it was orally administered once a day from 2 to 7 weeks. Prednisolone elevated plasma bilirubin and glutamic-pyruvic transaminase levels, and cyclophosphamide decreased <e>erythrocytes</e>. Moreover, both prednisolone and cyclophosphamide decreased spleen and thymus weights. KF24345 did not show this kind of side effects. These results demonstrate that KF24345 ameliorates glomerulonephritis with minimal side effects in mice, suggesting that the adenosine uptake inhibitor may be useful for the treatment of glomerulonephritis.",M2
12160596,"Quitting smoking may restore hematological characteristics within five years.PURPOSE: To describe the cross-sectional association of counts of total and subtypes of leukocytes, platelets, and selected characteristics of red blood cells with intensity of cigarette smoking and smoking cessation. METHODS: The study population consisted of 16,254 men and women 20-70 years of age who participated in the Dutch European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and nutrition (EPIC) subcohort, 1995-1997. Linear regression analysis was performed, for both sexes separately, to study the relation between various measurements of smoking habits and hematologic characteristics. RESULTS: Among current smokers, in both genders, packyears and daily number of cigarettes were associated with increased leukocytes (6-19%), lymphocytes (4-14%), monocytes (3-9%), neutrophils (7-24%), platelets (1-5%), mean corpuscular volume (0.4-2%), hematocrit (0.3-4%), hemoglobin (0.3-4%), and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (0.8-2%). In subjects who had quit smoking within two years before blood measurement, hematological characteristics in most cells were similar as in never smokers, whereas normal counts of lymphocytes and monocytes were observed only 2-5 years after quitting. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest a marked influence of current smoking habits on leukocyte counts and, to a lesser extent, on counts of <e>erythrocytes</e> and platelets. Following smoking cessation, at least five years have to pass before changes in all hematological parameters may return to normal values.",M2
12145462,"Pyridine nucleotide redox potential in <e>erythrocytes</e> of saudi subjects with sickle cell disease.Key antioxidant defense reactions in RBCs are linked to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD(+)) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP(+)). The ratio of reduced (NAD(P)H) to total pyridine nucleotide pool [(NAD(P)(T) i.e. NAD(P)H plus NAD(P)(+)], which is known as redox potential, reflects the redox status of erythrocytes. Through the utilization of a spectrophotometric cycling assay, the NAD(+) and NADP(+) redox potentials were determined in erythrocytes from normal Saudi subjects and those with sickle cell disease (SCD). The sickle erythrocytes NADH/NAD(T) ratio (0.386) was reduced compared to the normal ratio (0.464). This reduction appears to be due to a significant increase in oxidized NAD(+) in sickle RBCs. However, the value of the redox potential of erythrocytes in Saudi subjects with SCD is slightly higher than that reported for comparable African Americans. Although the high fetal hemoglobin is the main factor in the amelioration of the clinical course exhibited by Saudi sickle cell patients, it is assumed that the slight improvement in the redox potential may play a part in this process. This is supported by a relatively uninhibited glycolytic pathway in the erythrocytes of Saudi subjects with SCD with a higher level of NADH than their African American counterparts.",M2

12029006,"Preservation of urine for flow cytometric and visual microscopic testing.BACKGROUND: Preservatives that could prevent destruction of cells, casts, and bacteria in urine are of great practical importance because they allow centralization and improvement of accuracy of urine particle counting. We compared two in-house mixtures and one commercial solution, as well as refrigeration, for their ability to preserve urine for both automated analysis (flow cytometry) and visual microscopy. METHODS: Urine specimens were preserved by refrigeration at 4 degrees C without preservatives (procedure 1); in a lyophilized solution intended to preserve specimens for bacterial culture (Urine C&amp;S tubes; BD Preanalytical Solutions; procedure 2); in 10 mL/L formalin-0.15 mol/L NaCl (procedure 3); in 80 mL/L ethanol-20 g/L polyethylene glycol (procedure 4); and by storage at 20 degrees C without preservatives (procedure 5). Test strip measurements were used to select specimens positive for leukocyte esterase, hemoglobin, albumin, or nitrite. For 106 consecutive strip-positive specimens, urinalysis was performed by UF-100 (Sysmex) and by phase-contrast microscopy after Sternheimer supravital staining. Automated analysis was performed at arrival in the morning, on the same day in the afternoon, and after 1 and 3 days. Visual microscopy was performed at arrival and 3 days later. RESULTS: Urine bacterial counts were well preserved with procedures 1-3, with a false-positive rate of 0.0-3.4% at day 3 vs 28% without preservation (procedure 5). <e>Erythrocytes</e> were poorly preserved for 3 days (kappa coefficients, 0.24-0.61); after 1 day, fair preservation was seen with procedure 2 (kappa = 0.78), compared with less favorable preservation with procedure 1 (kappa = 0.61) or procedure 5 (kappa = 0.66). Leukocytes were well preserved by all five procedures in the acidic adult urines investigated. Counts of casts and large epithelial cells were artifactually increased by procedure 3. Procedure 2 performed at least as well as refrigeration for specimens analyzed with visual microscopy. CONCLUSIONS: Urine specimens from adults can be stabilized at room temperature for both automated particle analysis and visual microscopy.",M2
11980523,"Pathogenesis of high-altitude pulmonary edema: inflammation is not an etiologic factor.CONTEXT: The pathogenesis of high-altitude pulmonary edema (HAPE) is considered an altered permeability of the alveolar-capillary barrier secondary to intense pulmonary vasoconstriction and high capillary pressure, but previous bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) findings in well-established HAPE are also consistent with inflammatory etiologic characteristics. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether inflammation is a primary event in HAPE and to define the temporal sequence of events in HAPE. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Case study from July through August 1999 of 10 subjects with susceptibility to HAPE and 6 subjects resistant to HAPE, all of whom are nonprofessional alpinists with previous mountaineering experience above 3000 m. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Pulmonary artery pressure measurements and BAL findings at low altitude (490 m) and shortly before or at the onset of HAPE at an altitude of 4559 m. RESULTS: Subjects who were HAPE susceptible had higher mean (SD) pulmonary artery systolic blood pressures at 4559 m compared with HAPE-resistant subjects (66 vs 37 mm Hg; P =.004). Despite development of HAPE in the majority of HAPE-susceptible subjects, there were no differences in BAL fluid total leukocyte counts between resistant and susceptible subjects or between counts taken at low and high altitudes. Subjects who developed HAPE had BAL fluid with high concentrations of plasma-derived proteins and <e>erythrocytes</e>, but there was no increase in plasma concentrations of surfactant protein A and Clara cell protein. The chest radiograph score was 12.7 for the 3 HAPE-susceptible subjects who developed HAPE before BAL was performed; they were lavaged within 3 to 5 hours. The remainder of the HAPE-susceptible group was lavaged before edema was apparent on radiographs. However, 6 subjects from the HAPE-susceptible group who developed HAPE on the following day had a score on bronchoscopy of 1.5, which increased to 4.6, reflective of mild pulmonary edema. In HAPE cases, there were no elevations in a number of proinflammatory cytokines and eicosanoid and nitric oxide metabolites. CONCLUSIONS: Early HAPE is characterized by high pulmonary artery pressures that lead to a protein-rich and mildly hemorrhagic edema, with normal levels of leukocytes, cytokines, and eicosanoids. HAPE is a form of hydrostatic pulmonary edema with altered alveolar-capillary permeability.",M2
11934218,"Demonstration and quantification of  hyperchromic  <e>erythrocytes</e> by haematological analysers. Application to screening for hereditary and acquired spherocytosis.The double laser beam diffraction of spherized RBC used in the ADVIA 120 haematological analyser allows quantitation of cells aberrant not only by their volume but also by their haemoglobin concentration. The present investigation provides arguments for the identification of hyperchromic RBC as spherocytes, mainly the close relation between % hyperchromic cells and % lysed by the cryohaemolysis test. The percentage of hyperchromic erythrocytes may no longer be considered an instrumental artefact. Without allowing a definite diagnosis of hereditary spherocytosis, an increased percentage of hyperchromic cells indicates the degree of spherocytosis, making it an excellent automated and cost-free screening parameter for inherited and acquired corpuscular haemolysis.",M2
11904466,"Rheological properties of blood in patients with chronic liver disease.We analyzed rheologic parameters, including erythrocyte rigidity (ER), whole blood and plasma viscosity, erythrocyte and platelet count, hemoglobin, hematocrit, mean corpuscular volume (MCV), fibrinogen, erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), very-low density lipoprotein (VLDL), and gamma globulin levels in 18 patients with chronic liver disease and 20 healthy volunteers. Fifteen patients had cryptogenic cirrhosis while 3 had chronic active hepatitis. ER and MCV was significantly higher in the patient group than the control group while whole blood and plasma viscosities were significantly lower. There were significant correlations between ER and blood and plasma viscosity, ER and MCV, plasma and blood viscosity, HDL and plasma viscosity and a negative correlation between ER and ESR. Our results demonstrate that <e>erythrocytes</e> become more rigid in chronic liver disease. We suggest that erythrocytes with increased rigidity can impair hepatic microvascular circulation and thus contribute to liver dysfunction.",M2
11779730,"Antioxidant protection of propofol and its recycling in erythrocyte membranes.alpha-Tocopherol is a potent antioxidant that effectively protects biological membranes against oxidative injury through coordination with ascorbic acid. Because propofol has a phenolic structure similar to that of alpha-tocopherol, this intravenous anesthetic may also have similar antioxidant activity. To test this hypothesis, the effect of propofol on oxidative injury of human <e>erythrocytes</e> was examined. Propofol inhibited oxidative hemolysis and cis-parinaric acid oxidation in erythrocyte membranes (ED(50) = 6 microM). Although ascorbic acid alone has no appreciable effect, the protective effect of propofol was enhanced by ascorbic acid. An electron spin resonance (ESR) study showed that propofol-derived radicals (g = 2.005) were continuously generated during the oxidation of erythrocyte membranes by an ascorbic acid-inhibitable mechanism. These and other results suggest that propofol interacts with ascorbic acid, thereby exhibiting potent antioxidant activity in and around membranes as does alpha-tocopherol. Kinetic analysis revealed that propofol increased the membrane fluidity of erythrocytes, thereby increasing their resistance to physical and hemodynamic stress. Further, a greater preservation of red blood cell counts was seen after surgery with propofol compared with conventional sevoflurane anesthesia. Thus, propofol may protect erythrocytes against both oxidative and physical stress, indicating its potential as an efficient and safe antioxidant.",M2

11757301,"[Validation and approaches to correction of hemorheologic disorders in patients with gastrointestinal cancer]A total of 237 patients were examined: 127 with gastric cancer and 110 with colonic cancer, 99 women and 138 men, mean age 57.5 years. Erythrocyte deformability and aggregation were studied by original methods. Red blood, protein metabolism, and endogenous intoxication parameters were evaluated by routine laboratory tests. Increased aggregation and volume of <e>erythrocytes</e> and decrease of their deformability and hemoglobin content in parallel with hypo- and dysproteinemia and increased level of endogenous intoxication were observed in all patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Correction of these disorders by intravenous laser exposure of the blood essentially improved the erythron status and protein metabolism and decreased endotoxicosis. Infusion/transfusion therapy also notably improved the erythron function and decreased endogenous intoxication. Analysis of the results of surgery showed decreased incidence of complications and lethal outcomes, which was due to methods of corrective therapy.",M2
11756192,"Modulation of Gardos channel activity by cytokines in sickle <e>erythrocytes</e>.It has recently been shown that the Gardos channel activity of mouse erythrocytes can be modified by endothelins, suggesting a functional linkage between endothelin receptors and the Gardos channel. Using (86)Rubidium ((86)Rb) influx, effects were estimated of proinflammatory molecules such as platelet activator factor (PAF), endothelin-1 (ET-1), interleukin-10 (IL-10), and regulated on activation normal T cells expressed and secreted (RANTES) on the Gardos channel activity in human normal and sickle red cells. It was found that PAF (EC(50): 15 +/- 7 nM), RANTES (EC(50), 9 +/- 6 ng/mL [1.2 +/- 0.8 nM]), IL-10 (EC(50), 11 +/- 8 ng/mL [204 +/- 148 nM]), and ET-1 (EC(50), 123 +/- 34 nM) induce a significant increase in Gardos channel activity-between 28% and 84%-over the control. In addition, these agents modify the Gardos channel affinity for internal Ca(++) (K(0.5)) by 2- to 6-fold. Biochemical evidence is provided for the presence of ET receptor subtype B in sickle and normal red cells. Furthermore, it was found that ET-1, PAF, RANTES, and IL-10 induce a significant increase in red cell density (P &lt;.05). These data suggest that activation of the Gardos channel is functionally coupled to receptor motifs such as C-X-C (PAF), C-C (RANTES), and ET receptor subtype B. Thus, cell volume regulation or erythrocyte hydration states might be altered by activation of the Gardos channel by cytokines in vivo. The role of these mediators in promoting sickle cell dehydration in vivo is under investigation.",M2
11686811,"Lower numbers of <e>erythrocytes</e> and lower levels of hemoglobin in periodontitis patients compared to control subjects.BACKGROUND: Anemia of chronic disease (ACD) is defined as the anemia occurring in chronic infections and inflammatory conditions, that is not due to marrow deficiencies or other diseases and in the presence of adequate iron stores and vitamins. The purpose of the present study was to investigate whether periodontitis patients show signs of anemia. METHOD: 39 patients with severe periodontitis, 71 patients with moderate periodontitis and 42 controls, all with good general health, participated in this study. The mean age of all groups was 42 years. Several red blood cell parameters were determined from peripheral blood samples. RESULTS: Overall data analysis indicated that periodontitis patients have a lower hematocrit, lower numbers of erythrocytes, lower hemoglobin levels and higher erythrocyte sedimentation rates. These results were adjusted for the following possible confounders: gender, age, smoking, ethnicity and level of education. Further, more periodontitis patients (23%) than controls (7%), had hemoglobin levels below the normal reference range. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides further evidence that periodontitis has systemic effects and that periodontitis may tend towards anemia. This phenomenon may be explained by a depressed erythropoiesis.",M2
11507889,"[Hematological parameters in characterization of anemia in leptospirosis]Blood samples from 46 patients with leptospirosis were analyzed on a Cobas Vega (ABX, France) device over the course of disease. Hemoglobin content, erythrocyte count, mean volume of <e>erythrocytes</e>, mean content and mean concentration of hemoglobin in an erythrocyte, anisocytosis index, reticulocyte count, and content of free hemoglobin (FH) were analyzed. Anemia (normocytic normochromic hyperregeneratory) is a typical manifestation of leptospirosis during the second week of disease. The leading pathogenetic mechanism of anemia associated with leptospirosis is erythrocyte hemolysis, whose intensity during the acute period depends on the severity of intoxication and extracorporeal methods of detoxication. Persistence of anemia during convalescent period is due to involvement of the kidneys (nephrotic nephritis).",M2
11500137,"In vivo radioprotection by 5-androstenediol: stimulation of the innate immune system.We showed previously that 5-androstenediol stimulates myelopoiesis, increases the numbers of circulating neutrophils and platelets, and enhances resistance to infection in gamma-irradiated mice. We have extended those studies to include monocytes, natural killer (NK) cells, eosinophils and basophils, and we have measured the activation marker CD11b using flow cytometry. Androstenediol (160 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously to female B6D2F1 mice 24 h before whole-body gamma irradiation. Androstenediol treatments increased the blood levels of neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells in unirradiated animals; decreased the numbers of circulating eosinophils; and ameliorated radiation-induced decreases in neutrophils, monocytes, NK cells, <e>erythrocytes</e> and platelets. The androstenediol treatments had no significant effect on the numbers of circulating B cells or T cells. CD11b labeling intensity on monocytes was decreased slightly after androstenediol treatment. In contrast, radiation or androstenediol alone caused increases in CD11b labeling intensity on NK cells. Androstenediol and radiation combined caused a marked increase in NK cell CD11b. The results indicate that androstenediol increases the numbers of the three major cell types of the innate immune system (neutrophils, monocytes and NK cells), that androstenediol-induced changes in blood elements in irradiated animals persist for at least several weeks, and that there is a significant positive interaction between radiation and administration of androstenediol in the activation of NK cells.",M2

Passive cavitation detection analyses corroborated the results obtained with hemolysis.",M2
11379396,"[Diagnostics for classification of anemia]Examining peripheral blood smears provides valuable information in the diagnosis of anaemia despite large inter- and intraobserver variation. The classification of anaemia is usually based on the average erythrocyte size, referred to as the mean corpuscular volume (MCV). Microcytosis indicates a reduced haemoglobin synthesis caused by either an iron deficiency or haemoglobinopathy, a congenital disorder. Macrocytosis is the result of a disruption to the division and maturing of proerythroblasts in the bone marrow, due, for example, to vitamin B12 (folic acid) deficiency or excessive alcohol use. Furthermore, a high number of reticulocytes in the blood indicates an increased production of <e>erythrocytes</e> whereas a low total indicates an inadequate production level. In addition to the case history and the physical examination, the MCV and number of reticulocytes can provide guidance with respect to further diagnostic investigation.",M2
11374603,"Efficacy of acute normovolemic hemodilution assessed as a function of fraction of blood volume lost.BACKGROUND: It has been recommended that intraoperative acute normovolemic hemodilution (ANH) be considered for patients expected to experience surgical blood loss of 20% or more of their blood volume. Previous mathematical analyses have not evaluated the potential efficacy of ANH in terms of fraction of blood volume lost. Since decrease of oxygen-carrying capacity is a function of erythrocyte loss relative to blood volume, the purpose of this analysis was to provide an assessment of ANH applicable to all blood volumes and to determine whether this recommendation is appropriate. METHODS: Equations were developed to describe the fractional blood volume loss (blood volume loss/blood volume; VReM/VBld) required to reduce hematocrit below a  trigger  hematocrit with maintenance of isovolemia. This is also the minimum fractional blood volume loss required for initial erythrocyte savings by any conservation technique. Equations were also developed to describe the fractional surgical blood volume loss for which ANH will obviate the need for transfusion of <e>erythrocytes</e> from any source other than those removed by ANH, and the fractional surgical blood volume loss required for ANH to save a defined volume of erythrocytes. RESULTS: Acute normovolemic hemodilution can extend the allowable fractional surgical blood loss before erythrocyte transfusion is required. The VRem/VBld required to initiate erythrocyte savings is approximately 0.5-0.9. The efficacy of ANH in terms of erythrocytes saved cannot be expressed as a function of the fractional blood volume lost alone. To save 1 unit of erythrocytes requires a fractional surgical blood loss of approximately 0.7-1.2 for the usual surgical patient when the transfusion trigger hematocrit is 0.18-0.21. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis suggests that surgical blood loss should be 0.50 or more for ANH to begin to  save  erythrocytes and 0.70 or more of the patient's blood volume for ANH to save 1 unit erythrocytes, for the usual surgical patient with an initial hematocrit of 0.32-0.36 and a transfusion  trigger  hematocrit (the value at which transfusion is initiated) of 0.18-0.21.",M2
11323567,"New hematological indices in the healthy elderly.BACKGROUND: Recently, new indices related to <e>erythrocytes</e> and platelet counts have been provided by hematological analysers. The purpose of the study is to investigate these new parameters in the elderly to define their normal values and to compare them with the range provided by the manufacturer. METHODS: Experimental design: a comparative study. Setting: general community, geriatric and internal medicine ambulatories. Patients: sixty healthy free-living elderly (cut-off: 65 years) and 66 healthy young-adults, as a control group. Measures: we measured the common and the new hematological parameters by H.1 Bayer technology. The new hematological parameters are red diameter width-RDW, hemoglobin distribution width-HDW, mean platelet volume-MPV, platelet diameter width-PDW, platelet hematocrit-Pct. We then compared the values of our population with the Bayer range. RESULTS: The confidence interval width of the new indices define very faster limits than the Bayer range. Statistical differences were significant only in male groups: young-adults (Y) versus elderly (E) with higher values in Y than E in RBC p=0.002, in Platelet count p=0.050 and in MPV p=0.026; and higher values in E in MCV p=0.008, MCH p=0.006 and PDW p=0.004. CONCLUSIONS: In the literature a wide range of common hematological parameters are reported in the elderly, while the new hematological values have not been discussed till now. Our results may contribute to define the laboratory limits of the new hematological values in the healthy elderly.",M2
11306530,"Index matching to improve optical coherence tomography imaging through blood.BACKGROUND: Most myocardial infarctions are caused by the rupture of small rather than large plaques in the arteries of the heart that are beyond the detection limit of current technologies. METHODS AND RESULTS: Recently, optical coherence tomography (OCT) has demonstrated considerable potential as a method for high-resolution assessment of vulnerable plaque. However, intravascular OCT imaging is complicated by the need to remove blood from the imaging field because blood results in substantial signal attenuation. This work examines index matching as a method for increasing penetration. Index matching is based on the hypothesis that the predominant source of scattering in blood is the difference in refractive index between the cytoplasm of <e>erythrocytes</e> and serum. By increasing the refractive index of serum to a value near that of the cytoplasm, or index matching, scattering can be substantially reduced. The concept was tested with a system that pumped blood in vitro through transparent tubing. The test compounds, dextran and intravenous contrast agent, both led to significant improvements in penetration (69+/-12% and 45+/-4%). No significant effect was seen with the saline control. For dextran, the effect could not be attributed to reductions of red cell number or volume because changes in these parameters were not different from the control. In the case of intravenous contrast, a small but significant relative reduction in red cell volume was seen. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates the feasibility of index matching for improving OCT imaging through blood. Future studies are required to identify compounds for effective index matching in vivo.",M2
11238311,"Automated flow cytometric analysis of cerebrospinal fluid.BACKGROUND: Recently, the UF-100 (Sysmex Corporation) flow cytometer was developed to automate urinalysis. We evaluated the use of flow cytometry in the analysis of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). METHODS: UF-100 data were correlated with microscopy and biochemical data for 256 CSF samples. Microbiological analysis was performed in 144 suspected cases of meningitis. RESULTS: Good agreement was obtained between UF-100 and microscopy data for <e>erythrocytes</e> (r = 0.919) and leukocytes (r = 0.886). In some cases, however, incorrect classification of lymphocytes by the UF-100 led to underestimation of the leukocyte count. UF-100 bacterial count positively correlated (P &lt; 0.001) with UF-100 leukocyte count (r = 0.666), CSF total protein (r = 0.754), and CSF lactate concentrations (r = 0.641), and negatively correlated with CSF glucose concentration (r = -0.405; P &lt; 0.001). UF-100 bacterial counts were unreliable in hemorrhagic samples and in samples collected by ventricular drainage where interference by blood platelets and cell debris was observed. Another major problem was the UF-100  bacterial  background signal in sterile CSF samples. Cryptococcus neoformans yeast cells and cholesterol crystals in craniopharyngioma were detected by the flow cytometer. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry of CSF with the UF-100 offers a rapid and reliable leukocytes and erythrocyte count. Additional settings offered by the instrument may be useful in the diagnosis of neurological disorders.",M2
11204485,"Hematological and TGF-beta variations after whole-body proton irradiation.The acute effects of proton whole-body irradiation on five bone-marrow-derived cell types and transforming growth factor-beta 1 (TGF-beta 1) were examined and compared to the effects of photons (60Co). C57BL/6 mice were exposed to 3 Gy (0.4 Gy/min) protons at spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP), protons at entry (E), or 60Co and euthanized on days 0.5-17 thereafter. 60Co-irradiated animals had decreased <e>erythrocytes</e>, hemoglobin and hematocrit at 12 hours post-exposure; depression was not noted in proton (SOBP or E)-irradiated groups until day 4. Significantly decreased leukocyte counts were observed at this same time in all irradiated groups, with lymphocyte loss being greater than that of monocytes, and the depression was generally maintained. In contrast, the levels of neutrophils and thrombocytes fluctuated, especially during the first week; significant differences were noted among irradiated groups in neutrophil levels. Plasma TGF-beta 1 was elevated on day 7 in the 60Co, but not proton, irradiated mice. Collectively, the data show that dramatic and persistent changes occurred in all irradiated groups. However, few differences in assay results were seen between animals exposed to protons (SOBP or E) or photons, as well as between the groups irradiated with either of the two regions of the proton Bragg curve.",M2
11161652,"Neurotoxicity of 2-bromopropane and 1-bromopropane, alternative solvents for chlorofluorocarbons.To clarify the neurotoxicity of 2-bromopropane (2-BP) in comparison with 1-bromopropane (1-BP), 36 Wistar strain male rats were divided into 4 groups of 9 and exposed daily to 100-ppm 2-BP, 1000-ppm 2-BP, 1000-ppm 1-BP, or fresh air for 8 h a day. Exposure to 1000 ppm of 1-BP was discontinued after 5 or 7 weeks' exposure because of the unexpected appearance of incomplete hindlimb paralysis followed by serious emaciation. The other groups were sacrificed at the end of 12 weeks' exposure. Exposure to 1000 ppm of 2-BP resulted in significant decreases in body weight and motor nerve conduction velocity (MCV) and elongation in distal latency (DL). A ball-like enlargement of myelin sheaths was observed. Significant reductions in the number of <e>erythrocytes</e>, platelets, and leukocytes, testicular germ cell loss, and seminiferous atrophy were also observed in this group, but not in 100-ppm 2-BP group. Exposure to 1000 ppm of 1-BP for 5 or 7 weeks caused a significant decrease in body weight and MCV and elongation in DL. Linearly arranged ovoid- or bubble-like debris of the axons and myelin sheaths in the teased tibial nerves and axonal swelling in gracilis nucleus were found in this group. No significant changes in hematological indices or histopathological findings of the testis were found in this group. In conclusion, 2-BP is neurotoxic to the peripheral nerves in addition to its toxic effects on the reproductive and hematopoietic systems at 1000 ppm. No noticeable changes were found in the rats exposed to 100 ppm of 2-BP. 1-BP is a potent neurotoxicant at 1000 ppm for 5 or 7 weeks, while testicular and hematopoietic toxicity was not found.",M2
11153226,"[Reference values of the red blood profile in beagle, German shepherd and golden retriever puppies]In the present study, blood samples were taken from clinically healthy puppies of the breeds Beagle, German Shepherd, and Golden Retriever between days 1 and 3 (n = 146), 8 and 10 (n = 137), 28 and 33 (n = 151), and 50 and 58 (n = 129) post natum. Measurements for red blood cell count, haemoglobin concentration, haematocrit, mean erythrocyte volume (MCV), mean corpuscular haemoglobin (MCH), and mean corpuscular haemoglobin concentration (MCHC) were performed by a semi-automatic blood cell counter; the normoblast number was counted visually. Between the 1st and 3rd day of life, the erythrocyte number of the puppies was 4.57 +/- 0.68 10(6)/microliter and, as such, was clearly below the reference range for adult animals. It further decreased by the 2nd measurement (8th to 10th day of life) to 3.59 +/- 0.41 10(6)/microliter, and then increased again to 4.75 +/- 0.68 10(6)/microliter (reference range: 3.73-6.25 10(6)/microliter, 2.5% to 97.5% percentile) by the final measurement (50th to 58th day of life). The measurement values of the haemoglobin concentration (13.5 +/- 2.0 g/dl) and haematocrit (41.0 +/- 6.5%) after birth were only insignificantly below or around the lower limit of the reference range for adult animals. Both parameters decreased to a more pronounced extent than did the erythrocyte count. They reached a minimum of 8.4 +/- 1.0 g/dl and 26.8 +/- 3.2%, respectively, between the 28th and 33rd day of life. Even at the end of the examination period (50th to 58th day of life), the values of these parameters (10.1 +/- 1.1 g/dl, reference range: 7.5-11.8 g/dl; 32.1 +/- 4.2%, reference range: 24.8 to 40.8%) were remarkably lower than the minimum of reference range for adult dogs. At the 1st sampling (between 1st and 3rd day of life), MCV (89.8 +/- 6.7 fl) and MCH (29.6 +/- 1.9 pg) were distinctly higher than the reference values for adult dogs. Both parameters decreased with increasing age. Thus, from the 50th-58th day of life, the results were comparable to those of adults. No considerable age dependence was found for MCHC. During the first days of life a relatively high number of normoblasts (8 +/- 7/100 Leukozyten) was found; it decreased rapidly. The study revealed significant differences between the breeds, e.g. German Shepherd dogs had lower initial values of erythrocyte count, haemoglobin concentration, and haematocrit when compared to the other breeds. Puppies of this breed also had higher normoblast numbers than the Beagle and Golden Retriever puppies at the 2nd and 3rd samplings. No clear sex differences in the studied parameters were observed. The results of this study reflect the replacement of fetal <e>erythrocytes</e> by postnatal erythrocytes. Moreover, they illustrate the need to use age as well as breed-specific reference ranges.",M2
11108195,"Hematologic changes associated with the appearance of eccentrocytes after intragastric administration of garlic extract to dogs.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether dogs given garlic extract developed hemolytic anemia and to establish the hematologic characteristics induced experimentally by intragastric administration of garlic extract. ANIMALS: 8 healthy adult mixed-breed dogs. PROCEDURE: 4 dogs were given 1.25 ml of garlic extract/kg of body weight (5 g of whole garlic/kg) intragastrically once a day for 7 days. The remaining 4 control dogs received water instead of garlic extract. Complete blood counts were performed, and methemoglobin and erythrocyte-reduced glutathione concentrations, percentage of <e>erythrocytes</e> with Heinz bodies, and percentage of eccentrocytes were determined before and for 30 days after administration of the first dose of garlic extract. Ultrastructural analysis of eccentrocytes was performed. RESULTS: Compared with initial values, erythrocyte count, Hct, and hemoglobin concentration decreased to a minimum value on days 9 to 11 in dogs given garlic extract. Heinz body formation, an increase in erythrocyte-reduced glutathione concentration, and eccentrocytes were also detected in these dogs. However, no dog developed hemolytic anemia. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The constituents of garlic have the potential to oxidize erythrocyte membranes and hemoglobin, inducing hemolysis associated with the appearance of eccentrocytes in dogs. Thus, foods containing garlic should not be fed to dogs. Eccentrocytosis appears to be a major diagnostic feature of garlic-induced hemolysis in dogs.",M2
10852756,"Heparin inhibits eicosanoid metabolism and hyperventilation-induced bronchoconstriction in dogs.Inhalation of heparin, an anticoagulant, attenuates exercise- induced asthma (EIA) in human subjects. The purpose of this study was to determine if heparin inhibits hyperventilation-induced bronchoconstriction (HIB) in a canine model of EIA, and if its mode of action involves the inhibition of eicosanoid mediator production and release. We used a wedged bronchoscope technique to measure baseline peripheral airway resistance (Rp). We then performed either a 2-min or 5-min dry air challenge (DAC) by temporarily increasing from 200 to 2,000 ml/min the flow of 5% CO(2) in air used to ventilate a wedged sublobar segment. We compared HIB before and 60 min after aerosol treatment with either bacteriostatic water (BW) or heparin. We found that (1) heparin had no effect on baseline Rp, (2) BW did not alter the response to DAC, and (3) heparin reduced HIB by approximately 50-60%. On the basis of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) cell analysis, heparin and BW caused acute infiltration of macrophages and eosinophils, and heparin increased the number of <e>erythrocytes</e> recovered immediately after DAC. Despite these acute inflammatory effects initiated prior to DAC, BALF mediator analyses revealed that pretreatment with heparin either attenuated or abolished hyperventilation-induced leukotriene, prostaglandin, and thromboxane release. Thus, our data provide direct evidence that inhaled heparin inhibits eicosanoid mediator production and release caused by hyperventilation with dry air, and significantly attenuates HIB.",M2
10836258,"Blood cells and plasma proteins of chickens fed a diet supplemented with (1--&gt;3),(1--&gt;6)-beta-D-glucan and enrofloxacin.The effects of (1--&gt;3),(1--&gt;6)-beta-D-glucan from Saccharomyces cerevisiae and of the fluochinolone enrofloxacin were studied on red and white blood cells and plasma proteins of growing chickens up to the 35th day of life. The prominent findings within the leukocyte population on a per cent scale are: (i) increase of leukocyte count; increase of neutrophils and decrease of lymphocytes in the control and in the antibiotic group from day 17 to day 35; (ii) a minor decrease of neutrophils and no change of lymphocytes in the glucan group; (iii) the monocytes increase from 2.5 +/- 1.8% to 6.5 +/- 7.6% in the glucan group; (iv) the basophils increase in the control group and scale down in the other groups from day 17 to day 35. The total count of leukocytes increases in the controls and in the glucan group. The total protein content of blood plasma, beta-globulin and gamma-globulin increase and the albumin-globulin-ratio and alpha-globulin decline during chickens growth. These changes are most prominent in the glucan group. The haemoglobin concentration shows in all three dietary groups a highly significant increase from day 17 to day 35 by about 17 to 27 per cent; no changes are seen in packed cell volume and number of <e>erythrocytes</e> per litre blood.",M2

DESIGN: Pilot study. SETTING: 2nd Clinic of Paediatrics, University Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic. METHODS: Mononuclear cells were isolated from 13-28 ml of peripheral maternal blood between 13 and 37 weeks of gestation. Leukocytes from maternal peripheral blood were depleted from mononuclear cells by treatment with anti-CD14 and anti-CD45 microbeads and high-gradient magnetic cell separation (MACS) on VarioMACS. NRBCs were sorted from CD14-/CD45- fraction by positive selection using anti-CD71 microbeads on MiniMACS. All sorting steps were analysed by three-colour cytometric analysis with FACScan flow cytometer. RESULTS: In 68 out of 78 pregnant woman (87%) NRBCs were found in range 2 x 10(5) - 1.02 x 10(6). NRBC were enriched with an average enrichment rate of 138-fold ranging from 4-526 fold. In our cohort of pregnant woman the number of isolated NRBCs was individual. We identified NRBCs from the 13th week of gestation. CONCLUSION: The aim of the study is to establish and standardise the method of enrichment of NRBCs from maternal blood samples and verify the applicability of this alternative source for non-invasive prenatal diagnosis.",M2
10709203,"[The structure of the white pulp of the spleen and the peripheral blood indices in rats under increased muscle activity]The white pulp structure was studied in rat spleen white pulp in conditions of increased muscle activity as well as certain parameters of peripheral blood. 36 male outbred albino rats were involved. Experimental rats were subjected to the increased physical load (everyday swimming seances lasting from 10 to 40 hrs during 4 weeks). The number of <e>erythrocytes</e>, leukocytes and level of hemoglobin were determined in peripheral blood. Perimeter squares and density of lymphoid nodules (LN) and marginal zone (MZ) as well as LN minimal and maximal diameter and MZ minimal and maximal width were determined in histological sections prepared at the level of the organ portae using TV-computer set. Besides, marginal sinuses width were measured in nine sites in every LN as well as the capsule thickness in three sites and at the level of portae. The data obtained indicate that increased muscle activity causes reorganization of red and white pulp in the direction of growth of the red pulp square which is associated with the increase of erythropoietic function. The appearance of lymphoid nodules with germination centres indicates lymphocytopoietic function intensification while the significant increase of marginal zone morphometric parameters witnesses its participant in primary immune response. High correlation between certain blood indexes and the parameters of lymphoid nodules and marginal zones supports these data.",M2

On comparison of annual means, the highest values of Hb and PCV were recorded in PH and of TEC in NPH, whereas the lowest values of these parameters were found in EDC. The Hb and TEC tended to decrease with increasing milk yield. Comparison of annual means of erythrocyte indices revealed the highest MCV and MCH in EDC, which simultaneously showed the lowest MCHC. Significant seasonal variations in haematological profile were recorded. The overall group mean (OGM) of Hb, MCV, MCH and MCHC was found to be significantly higher (P &lt; 0.01) during summer whereas the TEC and PCV showed higher OGM (P &lt; 0.01) during the winter season.",M2
10987663,"Embryonic hematopoiesis defect in the tattered-Hokkaido (Tdho) mouse.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The Tdho allele is an X-linked dominant, embryonic male-lethal mouse mutation that occurs between embryonic day (E) 12.5 and E14.5. The lethal cause and responsible gene have not been identified until now. The cause of lethality in Tdho male embryos was examined with respect to the defect of hematopoiesis. METHODS: Suppression subtractive hybridization and Northern blot analysis were performed on E12.5 male Tdho and normal mouse embryos. In addition, histochemical examinations and blood cell counts of normal and mutant E12.5 embryos were carried out. RESULTS: Diminished expression of embryonic globin genes (zeta and epsilon globins) in the blood of E12.5 Tdho male embryos were documented by use of Northern blot analysis and subtractive hybridization. Increased apoptosis of yolk sac-derived <e>erythrocytes</e> was found in E12.5 Tdho male embryos. Furthermore, diminished numbers of anucleated erythrocytes were observed in E12.5 mutant embryos. CONCLUSIONS: A defect of embryonic hematopoiesis in Tdho mice was suggested as one of the possible causes of embryo lethality.",M2
