In 2005, the American Dental Association (<e>ADA</e>) Council on Scientific Affairs convened an expert panel to develop clinical recommendations for dentists treating patients who are receiving oral bisphosphonate therapy. The Journal of the American Dental Association published the resulting report in 2006. This 2008 advisory statement is the first of projected periodic updates of the 2006 clinical recommendations. CONCLUSION: This 2008 advisory statement concludes, on the basis of a review of the current literature, that for patients receiving bisphosphonate therapy, the risk of developing bisphosphonate-associated osteonecrosis (BON) of the jaw apparently remains low. It also newly concludes that current screening and diagnostic tests are unreliable for predicting a patient's risk of developing the condition. This statement updates the 2006 recommendations regarding general dentistry, management of periodontal diseases, implant placement and maintenance, oral and maxillofacial surgery, endodontics, restorative dentistry and prosthodontics, and orthodontics.",M1

The American Dental Association's (ADA) documented history of activity and leadership on licensure issues and the organization's guiding documents (Strategic Plan, Current Policies, Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct and Constitution and Bylaws) all lend credence to the Association's role in the licensure process. ADA members, other dental organizations, private and governmental agencies, and the public recognize the ADA as an authority on matters relating to dentistry.

17138410,"The <e>ADA</e> perspective.BACKGROUND: The American Dental Association (ADA) has long relied on available scientific evidence in its commitment to use credible scientific data and analyses in policy-making, and its communications with the dental profession and the public. OVERVIEW: The evidence-based dentistry (EBD) process is a systematic approach that reviews and publishes the evidence relevant to specific clinical questions. The goal of this process is to help practitioners provide patients with quality oral health care. The ADA has developed a strategic plan of EBD initiatives and activities in order to increase the knowledge base and improve educational programs; to encourage significant collaboration on EBD-related issues from interested organizations, specialty groups, and various outside agencies; and to increasingly derive the best scientific evidence for use in clinical practice in concert with professional judgment and patient treatment preferences. CONCLUSION: The ADA endeavors to provide relevant information that can assist dentists in translating systematic-review findings and implementing an evidence-based approach in everyday clinical practice. This supports the Association's goal to continue supporting the best available evidence to assist health care teams in the provision of quality patient care and preventive techniques that improve oral health care outcomes.",M1
17106035,"Reaction to universal patient acceptance: The perspective of a private practice dentist.The purpose of this article is to respond to the theories of Acceptance and Universal Patient Acceptance and their relationship to the American Dental Association's Principles of Ethics and Code of Professional Conduct (<e>ADA</e> Code). Universal Patient Acceptance (UPA) requires the dentist to communicate in some fashion with each patient who attempts to enter his or her practice to determine needs, desires, and financial ability to access dental care. The dentist must then help the patient gain entry into his or her practice or make appropriate referrals based on the patient's desires, needs, and financial status. The theory of UPA proposes that this action will alleviate some portion of the access problem. This article explores the notion of access as articulated in the ADA Code. The theory of UPA is explored from the view of the practicing dentist, noting the difficulties encountered when incorporating this theory into private practice. The conclusion is that the ADA Code offers appropriate guidance for ADA members regarding the ethical treatment of the underserved. Without further study, the inclusion of UPA in the ADA Code is not desirable. The author also concludes that support systems for the practicing dentist are necessary before UPA could be considered a reasonable way to practice dentistry.",M1
17099661,"An audit improves the quality of water within the dental unit water lines of three separate facilities of a United Kingdom NHS Trust.OBJECTIVE: To improve the quality of water emanating from dental unit waterlines (DUWLs). DESIGN: A prospective clinical audit. SETTING: Three geographically separate district dental facilities of a United Kingdom NHS Trust, involving two community clinics and one hospital orthodontic department, which were evaluated between 2002 and 2004. METHODS: Samples of water discharged from the DUWLs were collected prior to the start and midway through a morning session. These were tested microbiologically at a United Kingdom Accreditation Service testing laboratory within six hours of sampling. INTERVENTIONS: One of the clinics followed the contemporaneous BDA advice of flushing water through its DUWLs while the other two clinics used separate intermittent disinfection purging regimes instead. One of them used a two stage protocol of Ethylene Diamine Tetra-Acetic acid followed by hydrogen peroxide, while the other used Bio 2000 as a single agent, which was subsequently superseded by the continuous use of super-oxidised water (Sterilox). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: To assess whether the samples either met the American Dental Association's guideline on the quality of DUWL water, or the more stringent European Union standards for potable (drinking) water. RESULTS: The two units which used a disinfection regime both complied with the <e>ADA</e> guideline and the EU potable water standard. However, the unit which only flushed through its DUWLs without using a disinfectant failed to comply with either of them. After all three dental facilities subsequently standardised their DUWL disinfection regimes by using Bio 2000, the colony counts from all of the water samples thereafter remained well below the EU recommended level. The unit which progressed to using Sterilox as a continuous disinfectant achieved and maintained zero readings from its water samples. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical audit can result in the improvement of the quality of water that is discharged through DUWLs, thereby minimising both the risk of cross infection to vulnerable patients, as well as to dental staff chronically exposed to contaminated aerosols.",M1

However a number of bacteria identified in biofilm from DUWL are opportunistic bacteria which are known to cause illnesses which have significant morbidity and, indeed, significant mortality. As the CDC guidelines have indicated, failure to deal with this issue is inconsistent with good infection control practices. In addition, the putative link between bacteria associated with refractory periodontitis and DUWL biofilm gives cause for concern. There are a number of products available which, if used as directed, are effective in controlling DUWL biofilm and ensuring the provision of an irrigating solution with bacterial levels which conform to the CDC and <e>ADA</e> guidelines.

To address the research purpose, surveys were sent to the <e>ADA</e> and to each of the ten independent state and four regional dental licensing boards. During the five-year study period (1998-2003), there were 508 requests for accommodations on the Dental Admission Test (DAT) from 49,211 applicants (1.03 percent), 235 accommodation requests for the National Board Dental Examination, Part I from 54,750 applicants (0.43 percent), and 150 accommodation requests for the National Board Dental Examination, Part II from among 40,412 applicants (0.37 percent). Three of the fourteen U.S. licensing agencies (21.4 percent) kept no records, and eleven (78.6 percent) maintained some records.

METHODS: This study was a randomized, examiner-blind, six-period cross-over, single-center study conducted in 60 adult subjects that examined plaque removal with a prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush, an ADA reference manual toothbrush, and an ADA reference manual toothbrush followed by floss. During the course of this study, subjects used each treatment two times. Plaque was scored before and after brushing using the Rustogi Modification of the Navy Plaque Index. A mixed model analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for a crossover design with baseline plaque score as the covariate was applied to the baseline minus one-minute post-brushing differences in average whole-mouth plaque scores. Supplemental analyses were also performed using the ANCOVA model separately for average gingival margin scores and for average interproximal scores, using the appropriate baseline score as the covariate. All comparisons were two-sided at the 0.05 level of significance. RESULTS: The prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush delivered an adjusted (via ANCOVA) mean difference between baseline and post-brushing plaque scores of 0.245, while the ADA manual toothbrush plus floss delivered an adjusted mean difference of 0.207 versus 0.196 for the ADA manual toothbrush alone. The prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush demonstrated a statistically significantly greater reduction in plaque than the ADA manual toothbrush plus floss (p&lt;0.001), which in turn had a statistically significantly greater reduction in plaque than the ADA manual toothbrush alone (p&lt;0.001). The prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush group had, on average, 25.2% and 18.3% greater plaque removal scores than the ADA manual toothbrush alone and the ADA manual toothbrush plus floss groups, respectively. Results for the interproximal and gingival margin regions also demonstrated statistically significantly (p&lt;0.001) greater plaque removal for the prototype Deep Clean manual toothbrush group relative to the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: The prototype manual Deep Clean toothbrush was found to deliver greater plaque removal by 25.2% and 18.3% compared to the control manual toothbrush group (ADA reference manual toothbrush) and ADA manual toothbrush plus floss group.",M1

Further emergency response training should be available to individuals interested in gaining additional knowledge and skills to assist in response to an attack. Participants also concluded that, where possible, training should be seamlessly implemented into the current curriculum without the addition of new courses; however, the group also recognized the possible need for alternative models at some dental schools.

METHODS: To gather information about the impact of this campaign, the ADA undertook two surveys. A telephone survey was conducted among 1,270 adult consumers, and a second survey was mailed to a national sample of 2,500 dentists. RESULTS: The majority of the consumers did not recognize the fact that dentists are responsible for examining their patients for oral cancer and that oral cancer claims more lives than melanoma or cervical cancer. The majority of dentists was aware of the ADA campaign and agreed that it helped raise the public's awareness of oral cancer and the importance of early detection. As a result, more dentists said that they are likely to educate their patients about early detection, adjust their own practice routines to include discussion about the disease, and look more closely for small oral lesions and test them with the brush biopsy test. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the survey of dentists demonstrated that the oral cancer awareness initiative sponsored by the ADA resulted in positive behavioral changes targeted toward the early detection of oral cancer. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Continued efforts to provide health education and health promotion interventions aimed at consumers and dentists invariably will result in the detection of oral cancers at early and curable stages.",M1

12956353,"Dental education summits: the challenges ahead.BACKGROUND: The authors present the major findings from <e>ADA</e>-sponsored education summit meetings in 2001 and 2002 that addressed the issues of dental education costs, dental student debt levels at graduation and budgeted unfilled dental school faculty positions. OVERVIEW: The meetings included representation from the ADA, the American Dental Education Association, the American Student Dental Association, the National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research and ADA-recognized dental specialty organizations. National experts on the three issue areas made formal presentations. State funds for dental education declined 22 percent from 1991 to 1998, after adjusting for inflation. Reductions in state budgets for 2002 and 2003 suggest further declines in state support. To cope with declining revenues, schools increased student tuition and fees 10 percent annually from 1991 to 1998, contributing to increasing levels of student educational debt, which in 2000 averaged dollar 87,600. Dental schools also have decreased their investment in physical plant and faculty numbers. Annual faculty salaries have increased 3 percent, while practitioner income has increased 7 percent. Academic income disparities with private practice have contributed to dental schools having almost 400 unfilled faculty positions. CONCLUSIONS AND PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Dental education is facing severe financial challenges that likely will increase. While there are no easy solutions, schools must make greater efforts to reduce operating expenses and seek more state and federal support for dental education. The ADA approved the summit reports, and the ADA House of Delegates adopted six resolutions that support the summits' recommendations.",M1

12785491,"Infection control: its evolution to the current standard precautions.BACKGROUND: The use of appropriate infection control precautions to protect against transmission of bloodborne and other occupational microbial pathogens has become a routine component of health care provision. Evolution and revision of recommendations continues to be based on updated scientific information, as well as documented and inferred clinical applications of new knowledge. In addition, surveillance of occupational risks in medical treatment settings often has served as a basis for subsequent disease prevention recommendations for dental care. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: Guidelines designed to protect dental professionals and their patients have focused on bloodborne pathogens since the first published American Dental Association recommendations in the 1970s. Subsequent statements developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the <e>ADA</e> and other organizations during the past 30 years also have addressed prevention of other infections, transmitted by either direct or indirect contact with a variety of potentially infectious body fluids. RESULTS: Review of the major features of these recommendations provides an appropriate framework to consider current guideline revisions. The success of long-standing universal precautions, or UP, against bloodborne infection has been augmented with the incorporation of body substance isolation, or BSI, practices into the infection control protocol designated  standard precautions.  Combination of the major tenets of UP with the BSI systems routinely employed in acute care facilities affords all health care professionals the means of preventing a spectrum of bloodborne, respiratory, contact and other potential exposures during provision of patient care. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: As infection control recommendations for dentistry are updated this year, they undoubtedly will include guidelines expanding previous UP to provide expanded protection for dental professionals in the multiple types of nonacute treatment settings in which routine treatment is provided.",M1

METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to a sample of 6,310 ADA members in January 2000 with follow-up mailings in February, March and April 2000. Data collection was completed in July 2000. The survey included questions on critical professional issues, perceptions of the American Dental Association and its priorities. A total of 3,558 surveys were received for an adjusted response rate of 59.5 percent. Only professionally active dentists who were ADA members were included in the sampling frame. RESULTS: Members evaluated statements about the American Dental Association, revealing their perceptions of the ADA on key issues. Findings showed strong support for the ADA Seal program, agreement that the ADA enhances the integrity and ethics of the profession and that the ADA is the premier professional association for dentists. Findings also provided information regarding the relative importance of ADA priorities by allocating  dues dollars  in $5 increments. The highest priorities were  providing continuing education to dentists,   lobbying members of Congress and federal regulatory agencies  and  influencing national public health policy.  CONCLUSIONS: ADA members, both new and established dentists, had positive perceptions of the Association and its programs. Although there was general agreement between these groups concerning ADA priorities, there was a substantial difference between some subgroups (especially graduate students and federally employed dentists) and the overall membership on the issue of changes in the licensure process to facilitate dentists' freedom of movement.

To find out more about how such challenges may affect current private practitioners, the American Dental Association conducted the 2000 Membership Needs and Opinions Survey. METHODS: A questionnaire was sent to 6,310 ADA members in January 2000 with follow-up mailings in February, March and April 2000. Data collection was completed in July 2000. The survey included questions on critical professional issues, and on perceptions of the ADA and ADA priorities. A total of 3,558 completed surveys were received for an adjusted response rate of 59.5 percent. RESULTS: Members rated the identified issues' level of importance to them. The top three issues included  maintaining my ability to recommend the treatment option I feel is most appropriate for my patients,   receiving fair reimbursement for the dental services I provide,  and  protecting myself, my staff and my patients from communicable diseases.  New dentists found other items to be more significant to them compared with members overall. CONCLUSIONS: Although ADA members as a whole had similar views on critical issues facing dentistry and ADA priorities, there were significant differences regarding some issues. New dentists were far more concerned about securing funds for their practice and paying off debt than were all ADA members. Minority dentists expressed greater levels of concern about certain issues than did all ADA members.

These organizations invited a group of experts from the ADA, NIDCR, OSAP, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the U.S. Department of Defense, academia and private industry to participate. TYPES OF STUDIES REVIEWED: The sponsors asked the participants to critically review the scientific literature on the subject in an attempt to determine the evidence basis for management of DUWL contamination and potential health risks, if any, in dental procedures. The ultimate goal of the workshop was to determine if a research agenda in the area of DUWLs should be pursued and what questions such an agenda should involve. RESULTS: The workshop yielded four questions that need to be addressed in future research: What is the safest and most effective agent(s)/device(s) for achieving microbial levels of no more than 200 colony-forming units per milliliter, or CFU/mL, in the effluent dental water? How should these products be evaluated and by whom? What are the adverse health effects, if any, of chronic exposure to dental bioaerosol or to the agents introduced into the dental unit to treat the waterlines for both dental staff members and patients? How could these health issues be evaluated? CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Developing evidence-based parameters for the management of biofilm contamination that are efficacious and cost-effective will allow clinicians to meet in proposed ADA standard of no more than 200 CFU/mL of effluent water.",M1

This is related to the traditional linkage of accreditation of postdoctoral training programs to <e>ADA</e> specialty recognition. The aforementioned ADA Guidelines are important because they provide the foundation for the continued use of sedation and general anesthesia within dentistry. The one mechanism that would  ensure safety and effective use,  maintain  a strong educational foundation,  provide  access to adequate training ... develop programs at the postgraduate level  and support expansion of both basic and clinical research is CDA accreditation of postdoctoral programs. Prior to 1991, hen general anesthesia training was acquired by dentists primarily through accredited medical programs, there was little need for anything more than guidelines to protect the public. With the development of non-accredited dental anesthesiology programs in accredited dental schools (primarily in the late 1980's) and the loss of access to general anesthesia training in accredited medical anesthesiology residency programs in the summer of 1991, primary responsibility for all general anesthesia training of dentists shifted to organized dentistry. However, the ADA House declined to recognize dental anesthesiology as a dental specialty on three separate occasions even though the ADA Council on Dental Education felt all requirements were met and favorably recommended specialty recognition in all three instances. Specialty recognition would have provided the needed accreditation mechanism to validate dentistry's continued use of deep sedation and general anesthesia by those practitioners not classified as oral and maxillofacial surgeons. As an alternative to the specialty recognition process and in view of the need to accredit postdoctoral general anesthesia training for dentists, the American Society of Dentist Anesthesiologists has recently requested the CDA offer accreditation for these dental programs. To address this issue and those of other non-ADA-recognized disciplines, the CDA is currently in the initial stages of developing requirements for accrediting non-ADA recognized postdoctoral training programs.

This study aims to investigate the ability of plasma ADA to modulate reactive oxygen species (ROS) production in neutrophils, and examine the involvement of adenosine and the cyclic AMP signaling pathway in this process. METHODS: Neutrophils were stimulated, in the absence or presence of plasma, with the chemotactic peptide fMLP (formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine), and the ROS production was determined with luminol-enhanced chemiluminescence. Activity of ADA was measured spectrophotometrically. RESULTS: Plasma dose-dependently amplified the ROS generation in fMLP-stimulated neutrophils. In parallel, incubation of neutrophils in plasma elevated the total ADA-activity approximately 10 times from 1.3 U/ml to 12 U/ml. Inhibition of ADA, or type IV phosphodiesterases, significantly lowered the plasma-mediated ROS production. Furthermore, the high-affinity adenosine A(1) receptor antagonists DPCPX and 8-phenyltheophylline markedly inhibited the plasma-induced respiratory burst in neutrophils, suggesting an A(1) receptor-mediated mechanism. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that plasma ADA amplifies the release of toxic oxygen radicals from neutrophils through a downregulation of the inhibitory adenosine/cAMP-system and an enhanced activation of the stimulatory adenosine A(1)-receptor. This mechanism has probably a crucial role in regulating neutrophil function and in the defence against microbial infections. However, a sustained neutrophil activation could also contribute to inflammatory disorders such as atherosclerosis.",M2

20147632,"Adenosine deaminase modulation of telomerase activity and replicative senescence in human CD8 T lymphocytes.Increased proportions of CD8 T lymphocytes lacking expression of the CD28 costimulatory receptor have been documented during both aging and chronic infection with HIV-1, and their abundance correlates with numerous deleterious clinical outcomes. CD28-negative cells also arise in cell cultures of CD8(+)CD28(+) following multiple rounds of Ag-driven proliferation, reaching the end stage of replicative senescence. The present study investigates the role of a second T cell costimulatory receptor component, adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>), on the process of replicative senescence. We had previously reported that CD28 signaling is required for optimal telomerase upregulation. In this study, we show that the CD8(+)CD28(+) T lymphocytes that are ADA(+) have significantly greater telomerase activity than those that do not express ADA and that ADA is progressively lost as cultures progress to senescence. Because ADA converts adenosine to inosine, cells lacking this enzyme might be subject to prolonged exposure to adenosine, which has immunosuppressive effects. Indeed, we show that chronic exposure of CD8 T lymphocytes to exogenous adenosine accelerates the process of replicative senescence, causing a reduction in overall proliferative potential, reduced telomerase activity, and blunted IL-2 gene transcription. The loss of CD28 expression was accelerated, in part due to adenosine-induced increases in constitutive caspase-3, known to act on the CD28 promoter. These findings provide the first evidence for a role of ADA in modulating the process of replicative senescence and suggest that strategies to enhance this enzyme may lead to novel therapeutic approaches for pathologies associated with increases in senescent CD8 T lymphocytes.",M2

The number of DCs was remarkably reduced by 60-70% when theophylline was administered at a therapeutic concentration. This effect was concentration-dependently exacerbated, was partly mediated by cellular apoptosis and was effectively reversed by the addition of the A1 agonists [2-chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyladenosin, N(6)-cyclohexyladenosine, and N-ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA)] or the A2a agonist (CGS-21680, NECA). The depletion of the adenosine A1 receptor by siRNA and addition of ADA remarkably reduced DC differentiation. Meanwhile, both enprofylline and rolipram had little effect. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that the adenosine A1 (and possibly coordinated with A2a) receptors contribute to DC differentiation and survival. These findings provide further evidence that theophylline has an anti-inflammatory action in bronchial asthma.",M2
20067539,"Immunological dysfunction in HIV-1-infected individuals caused by impairment of adenosine deaminase-induced costimulation of T-cell activation.The cell surface association between CD26 and adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) has a costimulatory function during T-cell activation. Several studies have revealed correlations among CD4(+) CD26(+) T-cell depletion, increased serum levels of ADA, and the evolution of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, implicating CD26 and ADA in HIV disease progression. In this context, we aimed to determine whether ADA costimulation could be altered during HIV infection. ADA costimulation was investigated in cells from HIV-infected patients (n = 36) in terms of proliferation and cytokine secretion. An effect of ADA on T-cell proliferation was found in HIV-1-infected patients and correlated positively with the CD4(+) percentage and the nadir CD4 count and negatively with viral load, demonstrating that the response depends on the immunological status of the patient. The robust ADA-induced increase in cytokine production [interferon (IFN)-gamma, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10] was markedly reduced in T cells from HIV-1-infected subjects. To eliminate some of the variables associated with immunological defects in HIV-1-infected patients, anti-CD3 plus ADA assays with T cells from healthy volunteers were performed in the presence of recombinant glycoprotein 120 (gp120). It was found that gp120 was responsible for the impairment of the ADA-CD26 interaction and consequently of the ADA-induced effect on both costimulation and cytokine production. The gp120-mediated disruption of the CD26-ADA interaction is a novel mechanism that might explain, at least in part, the altered immunological features observed in HIV-1-infected patients and may have significant relevance in AIDS pathogenesis.",M2
20029956,"Decrease of adenosine deaminase activity and increase of the lipid peroxidation after acute methotrexate treatment in young rats: protective effects of grape seed extract.The methotrexate (MTX) is an anti-folate used to treat cancer and some inflammatory diseases. The efficacy of MTX is often limited by its severe toxicity. The present study was undertaken to determine whether Grape seed (Cabernet Sauvignon) extract (GSE) could ameliorate the MTX-induced oxidative injury and the effect on adenosine deaminase activity (<e>ADA</e>) in rats. The rats were pretreated with 50 mg/kg of GSE, i.p., prior to MTX administration (10 mg/kg, i.p.) with a second dose given 4 h and a third dose 16 h after MTX administration. Biochemical parameters were investigated 48 h after the last MTX administration. The administration of MTX increased thiobarbituric acid reactive species (TBARS) levels in hippocampus, kidney and liver, whereas induced a significant decreased in the ADA activity in the cerebral cortex, kidney and liver tissues. MTX administration significantly increased the activity of ALT(alanine aminotransferase) and urea levels and decreased uric acid levels in the serum. Urinary uric acid levels decreased in the MTX group when compared to those of the control group. The GSE along with MTX-administration significantly reversed these parameters toward to near normal. These results indicated that GSE could reduce hepatic and nephritic damage induced by MTX-treatment in young rats therefore having free radical scavenging.",M2
20029210,"Caspase-4 activation in association with decreased adenosine deaminase activity may be a factor for gastric ulcer.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>)-deficient disease, a severe combined immunodeficiency, is most commonly associated with gastrointestinal disorders such as ulcer. The present study investigated the role of ADA in the pathogenesis of gastric ulcer. Methods: ADA activity was measured in a variety of organs and tissues from rats and in human gastric biopsy samples from patients who underwent gastrofiberscope. An MTT assay and TUNEL staining were carried out, and activity of caspase-3 and -4 was enzymatically measured in MKN45 human gastric cancer cells. In the Western blot analysis, caspase-4 activation was identified in gastric biopsy samples. RESULTS: In rat organs and tissues, the epithelium of the gastrointestine exhibited higher ADA activity. The ADA inhibitor EHNA reduced cell viability, increased TUNEL-positive cells, and activated caspase-3 and -4 in MKN45 cells. For gastric biopsy samples, much lower ADA activity was found in gastric ulcer tissues, with a tendency of caspase-4 activation. CONCLUSION: A decline in ADA activity and the ensuing increase in intracellular adenosine concentrations for the stomach could induce gastric epithelial cell apoptosis by activating caspase-4 and the effector caspase-3. This may represent a fresh pathogenetical pathway for gastric ulcer relevant to ADA activity and caspase-4 activation.",M2
20026396,"Anti-inflammatory evaluation of Coronopus didymus in the pleurisy and paw oedema models in mice.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mastrunço (Coronopus didymus--CD) is currently considered as a medicinal specie often used in Brazil, especially in southeast region, for the treatment of several diseases in which pain and inflammation are common. Treatment with the plant can be done by infusion, decoction, or through food. The aim of this study was: to investigate the anti-inflammatory effect of hydroalcoholic extract obtained from the leaves of CD following the traditional procedure. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The anti-inflammatory activity was determined using mouse of pleurisy and paw oedema models, both process being induced by different flogistic agents such as: carrageenan (Cg), bradykinin (BK), histamine (HIS), substance P (SP), dextran (DEX) or prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)). We evaluated the effect of CD (200-600 mg/kg) administered by oral route (p.o.) upon leukocytes migration, myeloperoxidase (MPO), and adenosine-deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activities and nitric oxide (NO) levels. RESULTS: CD (200-600 mg/kg) inhibited the leukocytes by 60.0+/-1.42%, neutrophils by 82.75+/-1.29%, MPO by 42.30+/-4.23%, and ADA activities by 57.89+/-1.94%, as well as NO levels by 64.28+/-2.15% in Cg induced pleurisy. CD also inhibited total and differential leukocytes in the pleurisy induced by BK (1.30+/-0.11/0.29+/-0.02), HIS (1.20+/-0.09/0.42+/-0.05) and SP (0.74+/-0.06/0.14+/-0.01). In addition, CD was effective in reducing paw oedema induced by Cg by 72.79+/-1.13%, SP by 68.26.+/-0.78%, BK by 66.66.+/-0.77%, PGE(2) by 53.346.+/-1.18 and DEX by 65.14+/-2.35%. CONCLUSION: Several mechanisms, including the inhibition of enzymes (MPO and ADA) and mediators (BK, HIS, SP, NO and PGE(2)) release and/or action, appear to account for the anti-inflammatory effect of Coronopus didymus.",M2
20008254,"Ten years of gene therapy for primary immune deficiencies.Gene therapy with hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) is an attractive therapeutic strategy for several forms of primary immunodeficiencies. Current approaches are based on ex vivo gene transfer of the therapeutic gene into autologous HSC by vector-mediated gene transfer. In the past decade, substantial progress has been achieved in the treatment of severe combined immundeficiencies (SCID)-X1, adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>)-deficient SCID, and chronic granulomatous disease (CGD). Results of the SCID gene therapy trials have shown long-term restoration of immune competence and clinical benefit in over 30 patients. The inclusion of reduced-dose conditioning in the ADA-SCID has allowed the engraftment of multipotent gene-corrected HSC at substantial level. In the CGD trial significant engraftment and transgene expression were observed, but the therapeutic effect was transient. The occurrence of adverse events related to insertional mutagenesis in the SCID-X1 and CGD trial has highlighted the limitations of current retroviral vector technology. For future applications the risk-benefit evaluation should include the type of vector employed, the disease background and the nature of the transgene. The use of self-inactivating lentiviral vectors will provide significant advantages in terms of natural gene regulation and reduction in the potential for adverse mutagenic events. Following recent advances in preclinical studies, lentiviral vectors are now being translated into new clinical approaches, such as Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome.",M2
20001225,"Adenosine deaminase and tuberculous meningitis--a systematic review with meta-analysis.Tuberculous meningitis (TBM) is a severe infection of the central nervous system, particularly in developing countries. Prompt diagnosis and treatment are necessary to decrease the high rates of disability and death associated with TBM. The diagnosis is often time and labour intensive; thus, a simple, accurate and rapid diagnostic test is needed. The adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity test is a rapid test that has been used for the diagnosis of the pleural, peritoneal and pericardial forms of tuberculosis. However, the usefulness of ADA in TBM is uncertain. The aim of this study was to evaluate ADA as a diagnostic test for TBM in a systematic review. A systematic search was performed of the medical literature (MEDLINE, LILACS, Web of Science and EMBASE). The ADA values from TBM cases and controls (diagnosed with other types of meningitis) were necessary to calculate the sensitivity and specificity. Out of a total of 522 studies, 13 were included in the meta-analysis (380 patients with TBM). The sensitivity, specificity and diagnostic odds ratios (DOR) were calculated based on arbitrary ADA cut-off values from 1 to 10 U/l. ADA values from 1 to 4 U/l (sensitivity &gt;93% and specificity &lt;80%) helped to exclude TBM; values between 4 and 8 U/l were insufficient to confirm or exclude the diagnosis of TBM (p = 0.07), and values &gt;8 U/l (sensitivity &lt;59% and specificity &gt;96%) improved the diagnosis of TBM (p &lt; 0.001). None of the cut-off values could be used to discriminate between TBM and bacterial meningitis. In conclusion, ADA cannot distinguish between bacterial meningitis and TBM, but using ranges of ADA values could be important to improve TBM diagnosis, particularly after bacterial meningitis has been ruled out. The different methods used to measure ADA and the heterogeneity of data do not allow standardization of this test as a routine.",M2
19928691,"[A case of listeria meningitis showed high levels of adenosine deaminase in cerebrospinal fluid]An 83-year-old woman developed high fever and headache for four days. She had disturbance of consciousness and was admitted to our hospital. A lumbar puncture was performed and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis revealed a white blood cell count of 268/mm3 and culture became positive for Listeria monocytogenes. Six days after admission, the adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) level in CSF markedly elevated (43.3 IU/L) with pleocytosis, but a negative PCR test for tuberculosis in CSF, sputum, gastric fluid. She recovered by antibiotics for 45 days and ADA level in CSF was normalized. She was diagnosed as listeria meningitis. High levels of ADA in CSF have high sensitivity and high specificity for tuberculous meningitis, but there are some reports that high ADA levels in CSF in other meningitis. The main biological role of ADA is related to proliferation and differentiation of lymphocytes, and specific activity of this enzyme is slightly higher in T-lymphocytes than in B-lymphocytes. Protective immunity to Listeria monocytogenes is exclusively exhibited by T-lymphocytes. We consider that increased ADA levels in listeria meningitis associated with elevation of T-lymphocytes in CSF. This report suggests that listeria meningitis must be included in the differential diagnosis of high levels of ADA in CSF.",M2
19914228,"The activity and expression of NTPDase is altered in lymphocytes of multiple sclerosis patients.BACKGROUND: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a demyelinating neurological disease, which is presumed to be a consequence of infiltrating lymphocytes that are autoreactive to myelin proteins. ATP and adenosine contribute to fine-tuning immune responses and NTPDase (CD39) and adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) are important enzymes in the control of the extracellular levels of these molecules at the site of inflammation. We evaluated the activity and expression of NTPDase and adenosine deaminase (ADA) activity in lymphocytes from patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS (RRMS). METHODS: This study involved 22 patients with RRMS and 22 healthy subjects as a control group. The lymphocytes were isolated from blood and separated on Ficoll density gradients and after isolation the NTPDase and ADA activities were determined. RESULTS: The NTPDase activity and expression were increased in lymphocytes from RRMS patients when compared with the control group (p&lt;0.05). In addition, a decrease in ADA activity was observed in lymphocytes from these patients when compared to the control group (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The regulation of ATP and adenosine levels by NTPDase and ADA activities may be important to preserve cellular integrity and to modulate the immune response in MS.",M2
19909461,"Predictive models for diagnosis of pleural effusions secondary to tuberculosis or cancer.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Tuberculosis (TB) and cancer are two of the main causes of pleural effusions which frequently share similar clinical features and pleural fluid profiles. This study aimed to identify diagnostic models based on clinical and laboratory variables to differentiate tuberculous from malignant pleural effusions. METHODS: A retrospective study of 403 patients (200 with TB; 203 with cancer) was undertaken. Univariate analysis was used to select the clinical variables relevant to the models composition. Variables beta coefficients were used to define a numerical score which presented a practical use. The performances of the most efficient models were tested in a sample of pleural exudates (64 new cases). RESULTS: Two models are proposed for the diagnosis of effusions associated with each disease. For TB: (i) adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>), globulins and the absence of malignant cells in the pleural fluid; and (ii) ADA, globulins and fluid appearance. For cancer: (i) patient age, fluid appearance, macrophage percentage and presence of atypical cells in the pleural fluid; and (ii) as for (i) excluding atypical cells. Application of the models to the 64 pleural effusions showed accuracy higher than 85% for all models. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed models were effective in suggesting pleural tuberculosis or cancer.",M2
19901882,"Pleural effusion adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) level and occult tuberculous pleurisy.BACKGROUND: We investigated the incidence of tuberculous pleurisy among patients with adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels of 50 IU/L or less in a pleural effusion, and without a previous diagnosis of carcinomatous pleurisy or Mycobacterium tuberculosis. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects were selected from patients who had undergone pleural biopsy by thoracoscopy at National Hospital Organization Tokyo Hospital from January 1995 to November 2004, and who had ADA levels of less than 50 IU/L in pleural fluid obtained preoperatively by thoracentesis. In all subjects, smear, culture, and polymerase chain reaction for Mycobacterium tuberculosis were negative. RESULTS: Of 138 patients who underwent thoracoscopic pleural biopsy, a total of 50 had effusions with ADA levels of less than 50 IU/L. Six (12%) of these patients were diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy after biopsy. Three patients with an effusion ADA level of 35 IU/L or less were diagnosed with tuberculous pleurisy. CONCLUSIONS: Occult tuberculous pleurisy is significantly common in patients with pleural effusion ADA levels of 50 IU/L or less and who may otherwise be diagnosed with nonspecific pleurisy.",M2
19900420,"AMP deaminase and adenosine deaminase activities in liver and brain regions in acute ammonia intoxication and subacute toxic hepatitis.Cytosolic enzymes AMP deaminase and adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) catalyze AMP and adenosine deamination, constitute rate-limiting steps of adenine nucleotide catabolism and play important roles in cellular energy metabolism. In this study, AMP deaminase and ADA activities of rat liver, neocortex, cerebellum, striatum and hippocampus were investigated in acute ammonia intoxication and subacute CCl(4)-induced hepatitis. Activities of both AMP deaminase and ADA in the liver were elevated by 2.4-4.2-fold (p&lt;0.0001) in both models of hepatotoxic injury as compared with controls. In acute hyperammonemia activities of AMP, deaminase and ADA increased by 46-59% (p&lt;0.02) in the neocortex and did not change in the striatum. In the hippocampus of hyperammonemismall es, Cyrillic rats, only AMP deaminase activity was increased by 48% (p=0.0004), and in the cerebellum only ADA activity was increased significantly (by 26%, p&lt;0.05). The adenylate pool size and energy charge were greatly reduced in the neocortex of hyperammonemismall es, Cyrillic rats. Results suggested that two parallel pathways of AMP breakdown, including AMP deaminase and ADA, respectively, are up-regulated under pathological conditions, probably in order to overcome compensatory synthesis of adenylates, to ensure prompt adenylate pool depletion and reduce the adenylate energy charge in liver and selected brain regions.",M2
19879309,"Allium sativum L. extract prevents methyl mercury-induced cytotoxicity in peripheral blood leukocytes (LS).Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) is involved in purine metabolism and plays a significant role in the immune system. The focus of this investigation was to examine the effects of low concentrations of organic mercury on ADA activity in human leukocytes and to investigate the relationship between these effects and cell death. We have examined the protective potential effects of Allium sativum extract (GaE) against Methylmercury (MeHg)-induced cytotoxic effects on human leucocytes under in vitro conditions. MeHg (0.05-10 microM) significantly decreased leukocyte viability (58.97% for MTT (3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide) and 51.67% for Alamar Blue (AB) and this decrease was positively correlated to the MeHg-induced inhibition of ADA activity. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) and GaE prevented both the MeHg-induced cytotoxic effects on leukocytes according to MTT and AB assays and the effects on the ADA activity. The present results suggest that the protective effects of GaE against MeHg-induced leukocyte damage is related to the removal of oxidant species generated in the presence of MeHg due to the antioxidant efficacy of garlic constituents. It is important to point out that the intense presence of ADA in Leukocyte suspension (LS) highlights the relevant effects in the immune system and in vitro cytotoxicity of MeHg exposure.",M2
19861313,"Regulation of adenosine system at the onset of peritonitis.BACKGROUND: Adenosine, a potent regulator of inflammation, is produced under stressful conditions due to degradation of ATP/ADP by the ectoenzymes CD39 and CD73. Adenosine is rapidly degraded by adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) or phosphorylated in the cell by adenosine kinase (AK). From four known receptors to adenosine, A(1) (A(1)R) promotes inflammation by a G(i)-coupled receptor. We have previously shown that A(1)R is up-regulated in the first hours following bacterial inoculation. The aim of the current study is to characterize the inflammatory mediators that regulate adenosine-metabolizing enzymes and A(1)R at the onset of peritonitis. METHODS: Peritonitis was induced in CD1 mice by intraperitoneal injection of Escherichia coli. TNFalpha and IL-6 levels were determined in peritoneal fluid by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Adenosine-metabolizing enzymes and the A(1)R mRNA or protein levels were analyzed by quantitative PCR or by Western blot analysis, respectively. RESULTS: We found that CD39 and CD73 were up-regulated in response to bacterial stimuli (6-fold the basal levels), while AK and ADA mRNA levels were down-regulated. Cytokine production and leukocyte recruitment were enhanced (2.5-fold) by treatment with an A(1)R agonist (2-chloro-N(6)-cyclopentyladenosine, 0.1 mg/kg) and reduced (2.5-3-fold) by the A(1)R antagonist (8-cyclopentyl-1, 3-dipropylxanthine, 1 mg/kg). In contrast to lipopolysaccharide, IL-1, TNF and IFNgamma, only low IL-6 levels (0.01 ng/ml), in the presence of its soluble IL-6R (sIL-6R), were found to promote A(1)R expression on mesothelial cells. In mice, administration of neutralizing antibody to IL-6R or soluble gp130-Fc (sgp130-Fc) blocked peritoneal A(1)R up-regulation following inoculation. CONCLUSION: Bacterial products induce the production of adenosine by up-regulation of CD39 and CD73. Low IL-6-sIL-6R up-regulates the A(1)R to promote efficient inflammatory response against invading microorganisms.",M2
19858205,"Generation and accumulation of immunosuppressive adenosine by human CD4+CD25highFOXP3+ regulatory T cells.Naturally occurring regulatory T cells (nTreg) are crucial for maintaining tolerance to self and thus preventing autoimmune diseases and allograft rejections. In cancer, Treg down-regulate antitumor responses by several distinct mechanisms. This study analyzes the role the adenosinergic pathway plays in suppressive activities of human nTreg. Human CD4(+)CD25(high)FOXP3(+) Treg overexpress CD39 and CD73, ectonucleotidases sequentially converting ATP into AMP and adenosine, which then binds to A(2a) receptors on effector T cells, suppressing their functions. CD4(+)CD39(+) and CD4(+)CD25(high) T cells express low levels of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>), the enzyme responsible for adenosine breakdown, and of CD26, a surface-bound glycoprotein associated with ADA. In contrast, T effector cells are enriched in CD26/ADA but express low levels of CD39 and CD73. Inhibitors of ectonucleotidase activity (e.g. ARL67156) and antagonists of the A(2a) receptor (e.g. ZM241385) blocked Treg-mediated immunosuppression. The inhibition of ADA activity on effector T cells enhanced Treg-mediated immunosuppression. Thus, human nTreg characterized by the presence of CD39 and the low expression of CD26/ADA are responsible for the generation of adenosine, which plays a major role in Treg-mediated immunosuppression. The data suggest that the adenosinergic pathway represents a potential therapeutic target for regulation of immunosuppression in a broad variety of human diseases.",M2
19788068,"Serum biochemical markers in rheumatoid arthritis.Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) characterized by local and systemic effects of inflammation has a wide range of biochemical markers implicated directly or indirectly to its pathogenesis. In the present study, homocysteine, cortisol, adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>), ferritin, malondialdehyde (MDA) and alpha-tocopherol in serum of RA patients and healthy individuals were estimated to assess if they contribute to the disease process. The markers of disease activity such as erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) and rheumatoid factor (RF) were also measured. The study group included a total of 45 subjects, including 30 RA patients and the rest being healthy individuals. RA group showed a significant increase in the levels of homocysteine, ADA and MDA, and a significant decrease in alpha-tocopherol compared to the healthy individuals. However, cortisol and ferritin levels did not show any significant change. Also, there was no significant correlation between the studied serum markers and markers of disease activity. Our results indicate that these biochemical markers contribute independently to the pathogenesis of RA.",M2
19779332,"New insights into the pathogenesis of adenosine deaminase-severe combined immunodeficiency and progress in gene therapy.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>)- deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) is a complex metabolic and immunological disorder, characterized by a severe immunodeficiency due to the accumulation of purine metabolites in plasma and cells. This review summarizes recent findings on the pathogenesis of immunological and nonimmunological defects in ADA deficiency and the successful outcome of gene therapy trials for this condition. RECENT FINDINGS: Recent reports show that ADA-SCID is associated with an increased frequency of autoimmune manifestations and high risk of central nervous system (CNS) complications even after bone marrow transplantation. It remains unclear to what extent infection-related or disease-specific factors correlate with this divergent outcome.Recent trials represented the first demonstration of long-term clinical efficacy of HSC gene therapy for ADA-SCID, underlining that gene therapy has a favorable safety profile and is effective in restoring normal purine metabolism and immune functions. Molecular studies showed that the retroviral integration profile after successful gene therapy did not cause selection or expansion of malignant cell clones in vivo. SUMMARY: Gene therapy for ADA-deficient SCID is an effective treatment, providing long-term clinical benefit for affected patients. Future research will be needed to address the occurrence of autoimmune manifestations and nonimmunological defects in order to improve patients' long-term prospects.",M2
19762195,"Concurrent measurement of adenosine deaminase and dipeptidyl peptidase IV activity in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion.Measurement of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) levels aids diagnosing tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE). Dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP) enzyme is closely related to ADA. Our aim was to determine the value of concurrent measurement of these T-cell-associated enzymes, ADA and DPP levels in the diagnosis of TPE. Patients with pleural effusion were grouped as TPE, parapneumonic, malignant, congestive heart failure related, and miscellaneous pleural effusions. Pleural and serum ADA and DPP levels were measured. Pleural and serum levels of ADA and pleural DPP were higher in TPE group than the rest. In 7 patients, pleural biopsy revealed granulomatous pleuritis. All of these patients had TPE and had elevated serum and pleural ADA levels. Serum and pleural ADA or DPP levels and pleural ADA and DPP levels correlated with each other. Selecting cutoff values of 40 and 27 IU/L for pleural ADA and DPP, respectively, the sensitivity of concurrent measurement of both enzymes was 77%, specificity 94%, and diagnostic efficiency 91%. ADA and DPP play an important role in tuberculous immunopathogenesis. The utility of DPP in the diagnosis of TPE has never been determined before. Concurrent measurement of ADA-DPP can aid in diagnosing TPE with higher specificity, sensitivity, and efficiency.",M2
19728741,"Structural and metabolic specificity of methylthiocoformycin for malarial adenosine deaminases.Plasmodium falciparum is a purine auxotroph requiring hypoxanthine as a key metabolic precursor. Erythrocyte adenine nucleotides are the source of the purine precursors, making adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) a key enzyme in the pathway of hypoxanthine formation. Methylthioadenosine (MTA) is a substrate for most malarial ADAs, but not for human ADA. The catalytic site specificity of malarial ADAs permits methylthiocoformycin (MT-coformycin) to act as a Plasmodium-specific transition state analogue with low affinity for human ADA [Tyler, P. C., Taylor, E. A., Frohlich, R. G. G., and Schramm, V. L. (2007) J. Am. Chem. Soc. 129, 6872-6879]. The structural basis for MTA and MT-coformycin specificity in malarial ADAs is the subject of speculation [Larson, E. T., et al. (2008) J. Mol. Biol. 381, 975-988]. Here, the crystal structure of ADA from Plasmodium vivax (PvADA) in a complex with MT-coformycin reveals an unprecedented binding geometry for 5'-methylthioribosyl groups in the malarial ADAs. Compared to malarial ADA complexes with adenosine or deoxycoformycin, 5'-methylthioribosyl groups are rotated 130 degrees . A hydrogen bonding network between Asp172 and the 3'-hydroxyl of MT-coformycin is essential for recognition of the 5'-methylthioribosyl group. Water occupies the 5'-hydroxyl binding site when MT-coformycin is bound. Mutagenesis of Asp172 destroys the substrate specificity for MTA and MT-coformycin. Kinetic, mutagenic, and structural analyses of PvADA and kinetic analysis of five other Plasmodium ADAs establish the unique structural basis for its specificity for MTA and MT-coformycin. Plasmodium gallinaceum ADA does not use MTA as a substrate, is not inhibited by MT-coformycin, and is missing Asp172. Treatment of P. falciparum cultures with coformycin or MT-coformycin in the presence of MTA is effective in inhibiting parasite growth.",M2
19720619,"Adenosine and osteopontin contribute to the development of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major health concern. Adenosine, a signaling molecule generated in response to cell stress, contributes to the pathogenesis of COPD. An established model of adenosine-mediated lung injury is the adenosine deaminase-deficient (<e>Ada</e>(-/-)) mouse. Osteopontin (OPN) is a chemokine that is produced following injury and is implicated in a variety of human pathologies, but its expression and role in the pathogenesis of COPD have not been examined. To investigate the role of OPN in a model of COPD, Ada(-/-) double-knockout mice were generated, and inflammation and air-space enlargement endpoints were examined. Results demonstrate that Ada(-/-) mice exhibit OPN-dependent neutrophilia, alveolar air-space enlargement, and increases in mediators of air-space enlargement. Furthermore, we demonstrate that patients with COPD have increased OPN expression within distal airways in association with clinical airway obstruction. These results suggest that OPN represents a novel biomarker and therapeutic target for patients with COPD.",M2
19716439,"Evidence of anti-inflammatory effects of pioglitazone in the murine pleurisy model induced by carrageenan.Several studies have shown that the anti-inflammatory effect of Pioglitazone extends beyond the cardiovascular system. This study examines the anti-inflammatory effect of Pioglitazone in comparison to reference drugs (Dexamethasone and Indomethacin) in the mouse model of pleurisy induced by carrageenan which is characterized by two distinct phases (4 and 48 h) of inflammation. Pioglitazone (20 and 50 mg/kg, i.p., 0.5 h before pleurisy) inhibited both neutrophil (4 h) and mononuclears (48 h) influxes (P&lt;0.01), but not exudation (P&gt;0.05). While one dose of Pioglitazone was effective in inhibiting inflammation at 4 h, additional doses (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p., 0.5 h before pleurisy induction followed by either a second dose at 24 h after the first one or two further doses at 12 h of time interval after the first one) were necessary to elicit inhibition of the second (48 h) inflammation phase. These effects were associated with a marked decrease in adenosine-deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin 1-beta (IL-1beta) levels (P&lt;0.01). Myeloperoxidade (MPO) activity was inhibited only at 4 h (P&lt;0.05). By contrast, reference drugs were able to inhibit all the studied inflammatory parameters (P&lt;0.05). These results demonstrated an interesting anti-inflammatory property of this thiazolidinedione class and strengthen prior evidence that PPAR pathways constitute another important route of inflammatory process inhibition of this pleurisy model.",M2
19711828,"Activities of adenosine deaminase and 5'-nucleotidase in cancereous and non-cancereous human gastric tissues.INTRODUCTION: Gastric cancer is still one of the most common fatal types of cancer in the world. The abnormalities in purine metabolism are a characteristic feature of many human tumors. Little is known about the correlation between the activities of key enzymes of purine nucleotide pathway and some clinical indicators of gastric cancer invasiveness and aggressiveness. METHOD: Seventeen (11 men, 6 women) patients with gastric cancer were admitted to the hospital. The activities of Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) and 5'-nucleotidase (5'NT) in their cancerous and non-cancerous tissues were measured. RESULTS: 5'NT activities were significantly higher in cancerous tissues than in non-cancerous tissues. CONCLUSION: 5'NT activities increased in gastric cancer tissues but had no association with clinicopathologic findings (Tab. 2, Ref. 9). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.",M2
19709327,"Syzygium cumini inhibits adenosine deaminase activity and reduces glucose levels in hyperglycemic patients.Syzigium cumini (L.) Skeels from the Myrtaceae family is among the most common medicinal plants used to treat diabetes in Brazil. Leaves, fruits, and barks of S. cumini have been used for their hypoglycemic activity. Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) is an important enzyme that plays a relevant role in purine and DNA metabolism, immune responses, and peptidase activity. ADA is suggested to be an important enzyme for modulating the bioactivity of insulin, but its clinical significance in diabetes mellitus (DM) has not yet been proven. In this study, we examined the effect of aqueous leaf extracts of S. cumini (L.) (ASC) on ADA activity of hyperglycemic subjects and the activity of total ADA, and its isoenzymes in serum and erythrocytes. The present study indicates that: (i) the ADA activity in hyperglycemic serum was higher than normoglycemic serum and ADA activity was higher when the blood glucose level was more elevated; (ii) ASC (60-1000 microg/mL) in vitro caused a concentration-dependent inhibition of total ADA activity and a decrease in the blood glucose level in serum; (iii) ADA1 and 2 were reduced both in erythrocytes and in hyperglycemic serum. These results suggest that the decrease of ADA activity provoked by ASC may contribute to control adenosine levels and the antioxidant defense system of red cells and could be related to the complex ADA/DPP-IV-CD26 and the properties of dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP-IV) inhibitors which serve as important regulators of blood glucose.",M2
19694340,"Acute tamoxifen treatment increases nitric oxide level but not total antioxidant capacity and adenosine deaminase activity in the plasma of rabbits.Tamoxifen is a synthetic non steroidal anti-estrogen used to treat patients with breast cancer and healthy subjects with high risk of breast cancer. It was aimed to study the short term effects of tamoxifen on the plasma total antioxidant capacity (TAC), nitric oxide (NO) and the adenosine deaminase activity (<e>ADA</e>) in healthy rabbits. Sixteen healthy New Zealand rabbits were allocated to 2 groups including controls and tamoxifen treated animals. Controls received a single application of 0.9% saline via oral route while the treated rabbits received orally tamoxifen (dissolved in 0.9% saline, at a dose of 5 mg/kg). Blood samples were collected at 6 and 24 hours following the treatments. Plasma TAC and ADA were not affected by Tamoxifen treatment. However, NO level in tamoxifen treated group was increased at 24 hours following tamoxifen treatment as compared to controls. In conclusion, acute tamoxifen treatment may not affect the antioxidant status and cellular immunity, as evidenced by unaltered TAC and ADA. However, NO level was increased as early as 24 hours following tamoxifen treatment.",M2
19672657,"Tuberculous pleural effusion.Tuberculous pleural effusion is one of the most common forms of extrapulmonary tuberculosis (TB). The immediate cause of the effusion is a delayed hypersensitivity response to mycobacterial antigens in the pleural space. For this reason microbiological analyses are often negative and limited by the lengthy delay in obtaining results. In areas with high TB prevalence, pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) levels greater than 40 U/l argue strongly for TB; in contrast, low levels of pleural ADA have high negative predictive value in low-prevalence countries. The specificity of this enzyme increases if only lymphocytic exudates are considered. The shortcoming of the ADA test is its inability to provide culture and drug sensitivity information, which is paramount in countries with a high degree of resistance to anti-TB drugs. Sputum induction (in addition to pleural fluid) for acid-fast bacilli and culture is a recommended procedure in all patients with TB pleurisy. The microscopic-observation drug-susceptibility assay performed on pleural fluid or pleural tissue increases by two to three times the detection of TB over conventional cultures, and it allows for the identification of multidrug-resistant TB. A reasonable management strategy for pleural TB would be to initiate a four-drug regimen and perform a therapeutic thoracentesis in patients with large, symptomatic effusions.",M2
19671942,"A case of hypogammaglobulinemia with enteroviral meningoencephalitis, associated with increased adenosine deaminase in cerebrospinal fluid.We describe the development of enterovirus meningoencephalitis associated with increased adenosine deaminase in cerebrospinal fluid of a 12-year-old boy, a known case of hypogamaglobulinemia despite monthly replacement of IVIg.The patient was referred to our center with fever, headache and vomiting for 10 days. CSF analysis was compatible with aseptic meningoencephalitis but high CSF protein (&gt;200mg/dl) and high level of adenosine deaminase in CSF (30IU/L) were against the diagnosis of simple viral meningoencephalitis. Nested PCR of CSF for entrovirus was positive. Treatment with daily high-dose IVIg was commenced, with significant clinical improvement. For patients with increased <e>ADA</e> and lymphocytic pleocytosis in CSF, differential diagnoses should include enteroviral meningitis. Antibodies, although crucial, cannot on their own prevent enteroviral infection in some hypogamaglbulinemic patients.",M2
19668260,"Adenosine deaminase enhances T-cell response elicited by dendritic cells loaded with inactivated HIV.As host immunological defenses are impaired during HIV infection, it is difficult to elicit good responses when attempting to develop therapeutic vaccines against HIV. To try to solve this situation, adjuvants, particularly cytokines, are currently under evaluation. Owing to the fact that adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) is a member of the family of growth factor with deaminase activity, we tested whether it could improve immune responses in the development of HIV dendritic-cell-based therapeutic vaccines. A co-culture model approach has been used to test the usefulness of ADA as adjuvant. Monocyte-derived dendritic cells from HIV-infected patients were pulsed with inactivated HIV, matured and co-cultured with autologous T cells. Addition of ADA to the co-cultures resulted in enhanced CD4(+) and CD8(+) T-cell proliferation and robust ADA-induced increase in cytokine production (IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-6). As IFN-gamma, TNF-alpha and IL-6 promote the Th1 versus Th2 phenotype and improve T helper proliferation responses and antigen-specific CTL responses ADA may be considered a promising candidate for therapeutic vaccine adjuvant.",M2
19652199,"Integration of retroviral vectors induces minor changes in the transcriptional activity of T cells from <e>ADA</e>-SCID patients treated with gene therapy.Gene transfer into hematopoietic stem cells by gamma-retroviral vectors (RVs) is an effective treatment for inherited blood disorders, although potentially limited by the risk of insertional mutagenesis. We evaluated the genomic impact of RV integration in T lymphocytes from adenosine deaminase-deficient severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID) patients 10 to 30 months after infusion of autologous, genetically corrected CD34(+) cells. Expression profiling on ex vivo T-cell bulk population revealed no difference with respect to healthy controls. To assess the effect of vector integration on gene expression at the single-cell level, primary T-cell clones were isolated from 2 patients. T-cell clones harbored either 1 (89.8%) or 2 (10.2%) vector copies per cell and displayed partial to full correction of ADA expression, purine metabolism, and T-cell receptor-driven functions. Analysis of RV integration sites indicated a high diversity in T-cell origin, consistently with the polyclonal T-cell receptor-Vbeta repertoire. Quantitative transcript analysis of 120 genes within a 200-kb window around RV integration sites showed modest (2.8- to 5.2-fold) dysregulation of 5.8% genes in 18.6% of the T-cell clones compared with controls. Nonetheless, affected clones maintained a stable phenotype and normal in vitro functions. These results confirm that RV-mediated gene transfer for ADA-SCID is safe, and provide crucial information for the development of future gene therapy protocols. The trials described herein have been registered at http://www.clinicaltrials.gov as #NCT00598481 and #NCT00599781.",M2
19638621,"How I treat <e>ADA</e> deficiency.Adenosine deaminase deficiency is a disorder of purine metabolism leading to severe combined immunodeficiency (ADA-SCID). Without treatment, the condition is fatal and requires early intervention. Haematopoietic stem cell transplantation is the major treatment for ADA-SCID, although survival following different donor sources varies considerably. Unlike other SCID forms, 2 other options are available for ADA-SCID: enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) with pegylated bovine ADA, and autologous haematopoietic stem cell gene therapy (GT). Due to the rarity of the condition, the lack of large scale outcome studies, and availability of different treatments, guidance on treatment strategies is limited. We have reviewed the currently available evidence and together with our experience of managing this condition propose a consensus management strategy. Matched sibling donor transplants represent a successful treatment option with high survival rates and excellent immune recovery. Mismatched parental donor transplants have a poor survival outcome and should be avoided unless other treatments are unavailable. ERT and GT both show excellent survival, and therefore the choice between ERT, MUD transplant, or GT is difficult and dependent on several factors, including accessibility to the different modalities, response of patients to long-term ERT, and the attitudes of physicians and parents to the short- and potential long-term risks associated with different treatments.",M2
19633200,"<e>ADA</e>-deficient SCID is associated with a specific microenvironment and bone phenotype characterized by RANKL/OPG imbalance and osteoblast insufficiency.Adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency is a disorder of the purine metabolism leading to combined immunodeficiency and systemic alterations, including skeletal abnormalities. We report that ADA deficiency in mice causes a specific bone phenotype characterized by alterations of structural properties and impaired mechanical competence. These alterations are the combined result of an imbalanced receptor activator of nuclear factor-kappaB ligand (RANKL)/osteoprotegerin axis, causing decreased osteoclastogenesis and an intrinsic defect of osteoblast function with subsequent low bone formation. In vitro, osteoblasts lacking ADA displayed an altered transcriptional profile and growth reduction. Furthermore, the bone marrow microenvironment of ADA-deficient mice showed a reduced capacity to support in vitro and in vivo hematopoiesis. Treatment of ADA-deficient neonatal mice with enzyme replacement therapy, bone marrow transplantation, or gene therapy resulted in full recovery of the altered bone parameters. Remarkably, untreated ADA-severe combined immunodeficiency patients showed a similar imbalance in RANKL/osteoprotegerin levels alongside severe growth retardation. Gene therapy with ADA-transduced hematopoietic stem cells increased serum RANKL levels and children's growth. Our results indicate that the ADA metabolism represents a crucial modulatory factor of bone cell activities and remodeling.",M2
19629564,"Activities of the enzymes that hydrolyze adenine nucleotides in platelets from multiple sclerosis patients.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is the most common chronic disabling neurological disease in young adults. Alterations in platelet function have been observed in MS; however, the mechanism and the relevance of this blood cell disorder with regard to MS pathogenesis are not yet understood. The aim of this study was to evaluate activities of ectonucleoside thiphosphate diphosphohydrolase (NTPDase, CD39), ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (E-NPP), 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) in platelets from patients with the relapsing-remitting form of MS (RRMS), as well as to analyze platelet aggregation and expression of NTPDase. The results obtained show that NTPDase, 5'-nucleotidase, E-NPP and ADA activities were decreased in platelets of RRMS patients when compared with the control group (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, NTPDase expression in platelets was also decreased in these patients (p &lt; 0.05); however, no differences were observed in platelet aggregation between RRMS patients and the control group. Our results suggest that the alterations in NTPDase, E-NPP, 5'-nucleotidase and ADA may have contributed to the alterations in platelet function in MS by altering the levels of nucleotides and nucleosides in the circulation.",M2
19628957,"The activities of paraoxonase, xanthine oxidase, adenosine deaminase and the level of nitrite in pseudoexfoliation syndrome.AIM: Our purpose was to investigate the possible roles of nitrite levels and the activity of paraoxonase (PON), xanthine oxidase (XO) and adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) in the pathogenesis of pseudoexfoliation (PEX) syndrome. METHODS: Serum samples were taken from 43 patients with PEX and 41 control subjects. The serum PON, XO and ADA activities and nitrite levels were assayed by spectrophotometric methods. RESULTS: The PON, ADA and XO activities and nitrite levels (means +/- standard deviation) were 81.72 +/- 42.56 U/ml, 19.75 +/- 5.72 U/l, 0.16 +/- 0.09 U/l and 94.23 +/- 27.72 micromol/l in the PEX group, respectively. In the control group, the PON, ADA and XO activities and the nitrite levels were 111.02 +/- 43.51 U/ml, 15.21 +/- 3.93 U/l, 0.13 +/- 0.06 U/l and 61.96 +/- 19.05 micromol/l, respectively. The serum PON activity was significantly lower in the PEX group when compared with the control group. The serum XO and ADA activities and nitrite levels were significantly higher in the patients with PEX when compared with the control subjects. CONCLUSION: Decreased PON (an antioxidant enzyme) activity as well as increased ADA and XO activities and nitrite levels indicate that oxidative stress is increased and purine metabolism is altered in PEX syndrome.",M2
19559780,"Adenosine deaminase activity, lipid peroxidation and astrocyte responses in the cerebral cortex of rats after neonatal hypoxia ischemia.Hypoxia ischemia (HI) is a common cause of damage in the fetal and neonatal brain. Lifelong disabilities such as cerebral palsy, epilepsy, behavioral and learning disorders are some of the consequences of brain injury acquired in the perinatal periods. Inflammation and formation of free radicals appear to play key roles in neonatal HI. The aim of this study was to describe the chronological sequence of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity, the oxidative damage changes and astrocyte response using the classic model of neonatal HI. We observed an increase in the activity of ADA and lipid peroxidation in the cerebral cortex 8 days after neonatal HI. This was accompanied by a GFAP-positive, and the degree of brain damage was determined histochemically by hematoxylin-eosin (HE). Taking into account the important anti-inflammatory role of adenosine, ADA may provide an efficient means for scavenging cell-surrounding adenosine and play an important part in subsequent events of neonatal HI in association with GFAP reactive gliosis. The present investigation showed that neonatal HI causes the increase of free radicals and significant damage in the cerebral cortex. The increase in ADA activity may reflect the activation of the immune system caused by HI because the morphological analysis exhibited a lymphocytic infiltration.",M2
19521708,"Serum adenosine deaminase activity in gestational diabetes mellitus and normal pregnancy.PURPOSE: To our knowledge, there is no report regarding adenosine deaminase activity (<e>ADA</e>) in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM). The aim of the present study was to investigate the level of serum ADA activity in normal pregnancy, GDM and normal non-pregnant women. METHODS: The serum catalytic concentration of ADA was measured in samples of 20 GDM, 40 normal pregnant and 20 non-pregnant healthy women. RESULTS: Adenosine deaminase activity was significantly higher in GDM (24.30 +/- 8.04 IU/L) and pregnant women (23.88 +/- 8.66 IU/L) than those of normal non-pregnant individuals (11.85 +/- 3.23 IU/L) (P &lt; 0.0001), but the ADA level was not significantly different from GDM and normal pregnant women (P = 0.97). CONCLUSIONS: Adenosine deaminase activity was significantly higher in GDM and pregnant individuals than normal group in this study. Previous reports in this field are contentious; therefore, ADA activity could be regulated in different population by immunologic and genetic factors.",M2
19514456,"[The diagnostic value of adenosine deaminase coefficient in patients with tuberculous exudative pleurisy]The authors examined 51 patients aged 37.74 +/- 2.17 years who had tuberculous pleurisy and aged 49.8 +/- 4.6 years who had nonspecific pleurisy. Group 1 comprised 18 patients with isolated tuberculous exudative pleurisy. Group 2 included 13 patients with tuberculosis complicated by tuberculous pleurisy. Group 3 consisted of 10 patients with nonspecific exudative pleurisy. Catarrhal endobronchitis was the leading form of tracheo-broncheal tree lesion among patients with tuberculous exudative pleurisy (n = 20 (64.5%)). The activity of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) was 2.18 +/- 0.73, 2.41 +/- 0.80, and 2.47 +/- 1.52 U/l in Groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Thus, the measurement of bronchoalveolar fluid ADA separately from other parameters is of no informative value in the differential diagnosis of the etiology of pleurisy. While analyzing the parameters, the authors introduced the coefficient of ADA (CADA) that was calculated using the formula: K(ADA) = ADA/cytosis. In patients with tuberculous pleurisy, K(ADA) was 0.65 +/- 0.17 (this was 0.52 +/-0.13 in isolated tuberculous exudative pleurisy and 0.84 +/- 0.36 in tuberculous exudative pleurisy complicated by pulmonary tuberculosis (p &lt; 0.05), and 0.20 +/- 0.06 in nonspecific pleurisy (p &lt; 0.05). The ADA coefficient of 0.52 or more confirms the tuberculous etiology in isolated pleurisies and permits a differential diagnosis to be made between specific and nonspecific pleurisy with and without lung changes.",M2
19494329,"Enhanced airway inflammation and remodeling in adenosine deaminase-deficient mice lacking the A2B adenosine receptor.Adenosine is a signaling nucleoside that is generated in response to cellular injury and orchestrates the balance between tissue protection and the progression to pathological tissue remodeling. Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>)-deficient mice develop progressive airway inflammation and remodeling in association with adenosine elevations, suggesting that adenosine can promote features of chronic lung disease. Furthermore, pharmacological studies in ADA-deficient mice demonstrate that A(2B)R antagonism can attenuate features of chronic lung disease, implicating this receptor in the progression of chronic lung disease. This study examines the contribution of A(2B)R signaling in this model by generating ADA/A(2B)R double-knockout mice. Our hypothesis was that genetic removal of the A(2B)R from ADA-deficient mice would lead to diminished pulmonary inflammation and damage. Unexpectedly, ADA/A(2B)R double-knockout mice exhibited enhanced pulmonary inflammation and airway destruction. Marked loss of pulmonary barrier function and excessive airway neutrophilia are thought to contribute to the enhanced tissue damage observed. These findings support an important protective role for A(2B)R signaling during acute stages of lung disease.",M2

19460251,"Adenosine deaminase activity and its isoenzymes in the sputum of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis.BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) has been widely used for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion. Two isoenzymes have been described, ADA(1) and ADA(2). OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the diagnostic value of sputum ADA, ADA(1) and ADA(2) activity in pulmonary tuberculosis (TB). DESIGN: We measured total ADA, ADA(1) and ADA(2) activity in the sputum of 27 patients with pulmonary TB (11 had a negative Ziehl-Neelsen stain for acid-fast bacilli [AFB]). Nineteen patients with lung cancer were used as controls. RESULTS: Sputum total ADA activity was significantly higher in TB than in lung cancer patients (median 18 U/l [range 3-70] vs. 6 U/l [2-16]; P &lt; 0.001). Sputum ADA(2) activity was significantly higher in TB compared to lung cancer patients (9 U/l [0-65] vs. 5 U/l [0-12]; P = 0.001). Sputum ADA(2) was significantly higher than ADA(1) in TB patients (P = 0.001). Sputum ADA and ADA(2) were higher in both AFB-positive and AFB-negative TB patients. Using a cut-off level of respectively 16 UI/l and 5UI/l for sputum total ADA and ADA(2), sensitivity and specificity were 55.6% and 100% for total ADA and 81.5% and 63.2% for ADA(2). CONCLUSION: Sputum total ADA and ADA(2) levels are elevated in patients with pulmonary TB. As they are elevated even in AFB-negative patients, they may assist in the early diagnosis of pulmonary TB.",M2
19459774,"Activity of ectonucleotidases and adenosine deaminase in rats exposed to cigarette smoke.Cigarette smoke is a complex mixture of various toxic substances that are capable of initiating oxidative damage and promoting blood platelet alterations. In this study, we investigated the activities of the ectoenzymes NTPDase (ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, CD39) and 5'-nucleotidase (CD73) in platelets as well as adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) in the plasma of rats exposed to aged and diluted sidestream smoke during 4 weeks. The rats were divided into two groups: I (control) and II (exposed to smoke). After the exposure period, blood was collected and the platelets and plasma were separated for enzymatic assay. The results demonstrated that NTPDase (with ATP as substrate) and 5'-nucleotidase (AMP as substrate) activities were significantly higher in group II (p &lt; 0.05) as compared to group I, while no significant difference was observed for NTPDase with ADP as substrate. The ADA activity was significantly reduced in group II (p &lt; 0.05) as compared with group I. Platelet aggregation was significantly increased in group II (p &lt; 0.05) as compared with group I. We suggest that these alterations in the activity of enzymes from the purinergic system are associated with an increase in platelet aggregation. However, our study has demonstrated that the organism tries to compensate for this enhanced aggregation by increasing hydrolysis of AMP and reducing hydrolysis of adenosine, a potent inhibitor of aggregation and an important modulator of vascular tone.",M2
19442822,"Neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects of Indole-3-butyric acid on rats at subacute and subchronic exposure.This study was carried out to investigate the neurotoxic and immunotoxic effects of Indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), a plant growth regulator (PGR), on rats at subacute and subchronic exposure. The neurotoxic effects of IBA were evaluated by measuring the activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and butyrylcholinesterase (BChE). Biomarkers selected for immunotoxic monitoring were the activities of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) and myeloperoxidase (MPO) in various tissues of rats exposed to 25 and 50 ppm dosages of IBA for 20 and 45 days. Results showed that the administrations of IBA decreased AChE and BChE activities in some tissues of the rats treated with both dosages and periods of IBA. With regard to the immunotoxic effects, ADA activity significantly decreased whereas MPO activity increased after subacute and subchronic exposure with both dosages in most of the tissues of rats compared with controls. The observations presented led us to conclude that the administrations of IBA at subacute and subchronic exposure decreased AChE, BChE and ADA activities whereas increased MPO activity in various tissues of rats. This may reflect the potential role of these parameters as useful biomarkers for toxicity of IBA.",M2

Although pleural effusion alone is an unusual presentation, we present a case of cryptococcal pleuritis in an AIDS patient which was initially difficult to discriminate from tuberculous pleuritis because of the high level of pleural adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>). Cryptococcus neoformans was detected in the culture of the pleural effusion after the initiation of antituberculous treatment.

19327339,"Adenosine deamination to inosine in isolated basolateral membrane from kidney proximal tubule: implications for modulation of the membrane-associated protein kinase A.In this work, the metabolism of adenosine by isolated BLM associated-enzymes and the implications of this process for the cAMP-signaling pathway are investigated. Inosine was identified as the major metabolic product, suggesting the presence of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity in the BLM. This was confirmed by immunoblotting and ADA-specific enzyme assay. Implications for the enzymatic deamination of adenosine on the receptor-modulated cAMP-signaling pathway were also investigated. We observed that inosine induced a 2-fold increase in [(35)S] GTPgammaS binding to the BLM and it was inhibited by 10(-6)M DPCPX, an A(1) receptor-selective antagonist. Inosine (10(-7)M) inhibited protein kinase A activity in a DPCPX-sensitive manner. Molecular association between ADA and G(alphai-3) protein-coupled A(1) receptor was demonstrated by co-immunoprecipitation assay. These data show that adenosine is deaminated by A(1) receptor-associated ADA to inosine, which in turn modulates PKA in the BLM through A(1) receptor-mediated inhibition of adenylyl cyclase.",M2
19319464,"Orengedokuto and berberine improve indomethacin-induced small intestinal injury via adenosine.BACKGROUND: Recent endoscopic technology has revealed that small intestinal injury is a serious threat to patients receiving nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). We previously showed that Japanese herbal medicine, Orengedokuto (OGT; Huang-Lian-Jie-Du-Tang in Chinese), protects mice from lethal indomethacin (IND)-induced enteropathy. To elucidate the mechanism of the protective effect of OGT, we performed microarray analyses and high power statistical analyses of microarray data using new bioinformatics tools. METHODS: Female BALB/c mice were subcutaneously injected with IND (20 mg/kg) once a day for 2 days. OGT-treated mice received a diet containing OGT from the first IND injection until the end of the experiment. Gene expression signals of small intestine were obtained with GeneChip. Analyses for overrepresentation of Gene Ontology categories were conducted using MetaGene Profiler (MGP) and the changes were visualized by Cell Illustrator Online (CIO). Furthermore, active ingredients of OGT were investigated. RESULTS: MGP and CIO suggested a critical role for the adenosine system, especially adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>), a key enzyme of adenosine catabolism. Quantitative real time RT-PCR and in situ hybridization showed that OGT decreased the expression of ADA, which possibly resulted in the elevation of the anti-inflammatory nucleoside adenosine. Blockade of the adenosine A2a receptor abrogated the protective effect of OGT. Berberine, a major ingredient of OGT, suppressed ADA expression and reduced the incidence of lethality. CONCLUSIONS: OGT may prevent IND-induced enteropathy by decreasing ADA which results in the elevation of adenosine. Modulation of the adenosine system may be an efficient therapeutic strategy for NSAID-induced enteropathy.",M2
19267852,"Adenosine signaling, priapism and novel therapies.INTRODUCTION: Priapism is defined as abnormal prolonged penile erection lasting at least for 4 hours occurring without sexual interest. Forty percent of sickle cell disease (SCD) patients display priapism. The disorder is dangerous and urgent given its association with ischemia-mediated erectile tissue damage and subsequent erectile dysfunction. Current strategies to manage the disorder are poor due to lack of fundamental understanding of the molecular mechanisms of priapism. Adenosine is a signaling nucleoside that elicits many pathophysiological effects by engaging membrane receptors. Recent evidence shows that adenosine may play an important role in priapism via adenosine receptor. AIM: To summarize the recent findings on the importance of adenosine signaling in the pathogenesis of priapism. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evidence in the literature on the association between adenosine signaling and the development of priapism. METHODS: This article reviews the literature that relates to the contributory role of adenosine signaling in priapism in multiple animal models and humans. RESULTS: Excessive adenosine accumulation in the penis, coupled with increased A(2B)R signaling, contributes to priapism in two independent lines of mutant mice. One is adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>)-deficient mice, the only animal displaying spontaneously prolonged penile erection, and the other is SCD transgenic mice, a well-accepted priapic animal model. Both polyethylene glycol-modified ADA (PEG-ADA) enzyme therapy and A(2B)R antagonists are capable of inhibiting potent corpus cavernosal vascular relaxation associated with priapic-like activity seen in both ADA-deficient mice and SCD transgenic mice, indicating that PEG-ADA enzyme therapy is likely to be a novel therapy for such a dangerous urological disorder. CONCLUSION: Overall, the research reviewed here raises the intriguing possibility that elevated adenosine signaling contributes to priapism in general and that this signaling pathway represents a potentially important therapeutic target for the treatment of priapism.",M2

Any change in adenosine deaminase (ADA) levels will reflect to adenosine levels. In the present study, we have investigated the effect of glutathione on brain tissue ADA levels due to seizures induced by convulsive and subconvulsive dose of pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) in mice. ADA levels due to seizures induced by convulsive and subconvulsive pentylenetetrazol were measured using the Giusti method. ADA levels were higher in the experimental epilepsy groups than in the control and sham groups. ADA levels significantly decreased in the glutathione groups, which may have antiseizure effects. Decreased levels of ADA would be due to increased adenosine levels, protecting against oxidative stress.",M2
19277111,"Clinical diagnostic utility of IP-10 and LAM antigen levels for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusions in a high burden setting.BACKGROUND: Current tools for the diagnosis of tuberculosis pleural effusions are sub-optimal. Data about the value of new diagnostic technologies are limited, particularly, in high burden settings. Preliminary case control studies have identified IFN-gamma-inducible-10 kDa protein (IP-10) as a promising diagnostic marker; however, its diagnostic utility in a day-to-day clinical setting is unclear. Detection of LAM antigen has not previously been evaluated in pleural fluid. METHODS: We investigated the comparative diagnostic utility of established (adenosine deaminase [<e>ADA</e>]), more recent (standardized nucleic-acid-amplification-test [NAAT]) and newer technologies (a standardized LAM mycobacterial antigen-detection assay and IP-10 levels) for the evaluation of pleural effusions in 78 consecutively recruited South African tuberculosis suspects. All consenting participants underwent pleural biopsy unless contra-indicated or refused. The reference standard comprised culture positivity for M. tuberculosis or histology suggestive of tuberculosis. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Of 74 evaluable subjects 48, 7 and 19 had definite, probable and non-TB, respectively. IP-10 levels were significantly higher in TB vs non-TB participants (p&lt;0.0001). The respective outcomes [sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV %] for the different diagnostic modalities were: ADA at the 30 IU/L cut-point [96; 69; 90; 85], NAAT [6; 93; 67; 28], IP-10 at the 28,170 pg/ml ROC-derived cut-point [80; 82; 91; 64], and IP-10 at the 4035 pg/ml cut-point [100; 53; 83; 100]. Thus IP-10, using the ROC-derived cut-point, missed approximately 20% of TB cases and mis-diagnosed approximately 20% of non-TB cases. By contrast, when a lower cut-point was used a negative test excluded TB. The NAAT had a poor sensitivity but high specificity. LAM antigen-detection was not diagnostically useful. CONCLUSION: Although IP-10, like ADA, has sub-optimal specificity, it may be a clinically useful rule-out test for tuberculous pleural effusions. Larger multi-centric studies are now required to confirm our findings.",M2
19218659,"Pleural fluid adenosine deaminase and interferon gamma as diagnostic tools in tuberculosis pleurisy.Several biological markers have been proposed to improve the efficacy of diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy. The study was undertaken to evaluate the accuracy of pleural fluid adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) concentration in differentiating tuberculous pleural effusion (TPE) and nontuberculous pleural effusion (non-TPE). Ninety four patients (50 M and 44 F, mean age 60+/-18, range 18-95 years) with pleural effusion (PE) were studied. TPE was diagnosed in patients with: (i) positive pleural fluid or pleural biopsy culture or (ii) granulomas in the pleural biopsy specimen, after exclusion of other granulomatous diseases. Pleural fluid ADA activity was measured with the colorimetric method of Giusti, while IFN-gamma level was measured with ELISA. TPE was diagnosed in 28 patients. The non-TPE group consisted of 35 patients with malignant PE, 20 patients with parapneumonic effusion/pleural empyema, 5 with pleural transudate, and 6 with miscellaneous PE. The ADA activity and IFN-gamma concentration were significantly higher in TPE than in non-TPE (614.1+/-324.5 vs. 15.1+/-36.0 pg/ml, P&lt;0.0001 and 75.1+/-39.1 vs. 11.0+/-16.6 U/l respectively, P&lt;0.0001). The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity of IFN-gamma measurement (cut-off value of 75.0 pg/ml) were 100% and 98.5% respectively and were similar to those of ADA (100% and 93.9% at the cut-off value of 40.3 U/L). We conclude that pleural fluid ADA activity and IFN-gamma concentration are highly sensitive and specific markers of tuberculous pleurisy.",M2
19243169,"Binding free energy calculations of adenosine deaminase inhibitor and the effect of methyl substitution in inhibitors.The binding affinity of an inhibitor is often improved ten times or more by introducing a simple substituent, such as a methyl group or a chlorine atom. We have investigated this phenomenon in the case of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) inhibitors using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations and binding free energy calculations, by the linear interaction energy (LIE) method. For MD simulations, the coordination bond parameters and partial charges of atoms around the zinc ion in ADA have been determined by referring to ab initio MO calculations. The calculated binding free energies for seven inhibitors agreed well with the experimental ones, with a maximum error of 1.2 kcal/mol. The effect of methyl substitution in inhibitor molecules was examined on the basis of MD trajectories. It is suggested that the increase in binding affinity is caused by both van der Waals stabilizations by amino acid residues in contact with the introduced methyl group and through favored overall interactions with surrounding residues in the binding pocket.",M2
19237250,"Adenosine deaminase-adenosine pathway in hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension.Hemolysis-associated pulmonary hypertension (HA-PH) is a serious clinical complication of various hemolytic disorders, and pulmonary hypertension (PH) is considered the greatest risk factor for death in patients with a hemolytic disorder. It is now well established that hemolysis causes the release of soluble hemoglobin and arginase from injured erythrocytes into plasma. This leads to nitric oxide (NO) deficiency, oxidative stress and a state of endothelial dysfunction that is associated with clinical development of PH. We challenge this concept and propose that in addition to the NO-arginase pathway, the adenosine deaminase-adenosine pathway plays a significant role in HA-PH and that modulation of this pathway may offer protective/therapeutic effects in HA-PH. Our preliminary data suggest that in HA-PH adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) is released from injured erythrocytes into plasma and that metabolic conversion of adenosine (ADO) to inosine by ADA reduces extracellular ADO levels. Adenosine, mainly via activation of adenosine A(2A) receptors, mediates a number of biological responses that may reduce hemolysis-induced vasculopathy and the risk of PH. Hypoxia is the strongest stimulus for ADO synthesis, and this increased ADO production counteracts some of the tissue/vascular injury caused by hypoxia itself. Unfortunately, under hypoxic conditions (anemia, vasoconstriction, and vaso-occlusion) in HA-PH, this  ADO negative-feed back  is abolished and the vascular protective effects of ADO are severely diminished by ADA released from injured erythrocytes. We hypothesize that in hemolytic anemia the repetitive release of ADA increases the risk for vaso-occlusive events and PH. We also propose that increase in extracellular ADO levels or activation of adenosine A(2A) receptors attenuates HA-PH, and we suggest further preclinical and clinical investigation of ADA inhibitors and ADO agonists in HA-PH.",M2
19237091,"Serum adenosine deaminase activities during acute attacks and attack-free periods of familial Mediterranean fever.BACKGROUND: Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is a systemic relapsing autoinflammatory disorder. Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) is an enzyme widely distribute in tissues and body fluids. Circulating levels of ADA have been shown to increase in several inflammatory conditions. This study was designed to evaluate the serum ADA in patients with FMF during acute attacks and attack-free periods. METHODS: The study groups comprised 23 FMF patients in attack-free period (male/female: 11/12), 30 FMF patients in attack period (male/female: 11/19) and 20 healthy control (male/female:10/10). The groups were similar for age, gender and disease duration. RESULTS: The mean age of FMF patients in attack-free period, patient with acute attack were 34.3+/-11.7 and 29.4+/-11.1 respectively. The disease durations were 13.1+/-10.2 and 8.2+/-7.6 years for patients in attack-free periods and patients with acute FMF attack, respectively. Patients with acute attack had significantly higher ADA levels than both patients with attack-free periods and healthy controls (for each, p&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: In this study we demonstrated that FMF patients with acute attacks had higher serum ADA levels than attack-free periods and healthy controls. It is likely that ADA may have a role in the cytokine network of the inflammatory cascade of FMF. Also, elevated ADA levels may be a part of the activated Th1 response in the disease. ADA may be used as a supportive marker to differentiate FMF attacks from attack-free periods. Further larger-scale studies are needed to support this result.",M2
19229593,"Antithetical effects of corticosterone and dibutyryl cAMP on adenosine deaminase in the gastrointestinal tract of chicken during postnatal development.Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>; EC 3.5.4.4) is a purine catabolic enzyme causing hydrolytic deamination of adenosine and 2'-deoxyadenosine to inosine and 2'-deoxyinosine. In the present study, the normal endogenous activity level of ADA was investigated in different regions of the gastrointestinal tract (GIT) during postnatal development of chicken. The effects of corticosterone and dibutyryl cAMP (Bt(2)-cAMP) were studied at two selected postnatal ages. The results indicated a significantly high level of ADA at day 1 in all the regions of GIT, which then declined (-34% in esophagus, -35% in crop, and -48% in small intestine) at day 10 and remained fairly constant till day 90. While in the proventiculus, the activity of ADA decreased (-30%) at day 30 and showed further decline (-52%) at day 90 as compared to day 1. Corticosterone was seen to significantly decrease (-23 to 79%) the activity level, depending on the regions of GIT studied except proventriculus. The magnitude of decline was more pronounced at day 60 compared to day 10. Bt(2)-cAMP, on the other hand, caused a significant increase (+21 to 67%) in the activity level of ADA again depending on the regions of GIT studied except crop. Western blot analyses also depicted that the decrease and/or increase, respectively, of ADA activity by corticosterone and Bt(2)-cAMP was at the ADA protein level. In conclusion, the study suggests that the ADA activity level is highest at day 1 in all the regions of chicken GIT and could be reduced or enhanced by corticosterone and dibutyryl cAMP, respectively, in an age-specific manner.",M2
19227321,"[Gamma-interferon and adenosine deaminase in the diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy]The paper compares the characteristics of the informative value of tests determining the activity of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity and the level of gamma-interferon (gamma-IFN) for the differential diagnosis of tuberculous pleurisy (n = 35) and non-tuberculous pleural effusion (n = 53). Both tests were ascertained to have the similar differentially diagnostic capacities with their threshold values of 35 U/l and 180 pg/ ml, respectively. At the same time, the sensitivity and specificity of the ADA test were 98.4% and these of the gamma-IFN test were 94.3 and 96.2%, respectively, with the positive and negative predictive value being 91.3 and 98.3% and 94.3 and 96.2%, respectively, and with the diagnostic value of 94.5% for the ADA test and 96.4% for the gamma-IFN test.

19226143,"Exploiting the pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-one ring system as a useful template to obtain potent adenosine deaminase inhibitors.A number of pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-4-ones bearing either alkyl or arylalkyl substituents in position 2 of the nucleus were synthesized and tested for their ability to inhibit adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) from bovine spleen. The 2-arylalkyl derivatives exhibited excellent inhibitory activity, showing Ki values in the nanomolar/subnanomolar range. The most active compound, 1-(4-((4-oxo-4,5-dihydropyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidin-2-yl)methyl)phenyl)-3-(4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl)urea, 14d, was tested in rats with colitis induced by 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonic acid to assess its efficacy to attenuate bowel inflammation. The treatment with 14d induced a significant amelioration of both systemic and intestinal inflammatory alterations in animals with experimental colitis.

19180338,"Laboratorial validation of an automated assay for the determination of adenosine deaminase activity in pleural fluid and cerebrospinal fluid.OBJECTIVE: The incidence of tuberculosis worldwide has emphasized the need for better assays designed to diagnose the disease, principally the extrapulmonary form. The objective of the present study was to validate the performance of an automated method for the determination of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity in pleural fluid (PF) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), comparing it with a conventional method (the modified Giusti method). METHODS: In total, 134 samples were selected from among those tested in our laboratory: 94 PF samples and 40 CSF samples. The ADA activity was determined using the two methods. Inter- and intra-assay precision was determined, linear regression analysis was performed, simple concordance tests were conducted, and the means of the differences were calculated. RESULTS: The correlation coefficients for PF and CSF samples were, respectively, 0.96 and 0.95. Inter-assay precision was determined using 21 replicates at 3 different activity levels: low, medium and high. The percentage coefficient of variation (%CV) was, respectively, 5.9, 8.1 and 5.8 for PF samples, compared with 21.9, 18.6 and 13.8 for CSF samples. Intra-assay precision in %CV was 1.3 and 11.7, respectively, for PF and CSF samples. The concordance between the methods in PF and CRF samples was, respectively, 96.8% and 100%, considering the reference values for the diagnosis of TB to be 40 U/L (conventional) and 30 U/L (automated) in PF samples, versus 9 U/L (for both methods) in CSF samples. CONCLUSIONS: The results validate the use of the automated method of determining ADA activity in PF and CSF samples as an alternative to the conventional method.",M2

METHODS: We infused autologous CD34+ bone marrow cells transduced with a retroviral vector containing the ADA gene into 10 children with SCID due to ADA deficiency who lacked an HLA-identical sibling donor, after nonmyeloablative conditioning with busulfan. Enzyme-replacement therapy was not given after infusion of the cells. RESULTS: All patients are alive after a median follow-up of 4.0 years (range, 1.8 to 8.0). Transduced hematopoietic stem cells have stably engrafted and differentiated into myeloid cells containing ADA (mean range at 1 year in bone marrow lineages, 3.5 to 8.9%) and lymphoid cells (mean range in peripheral blood, 52.4 to 88.0%). Eight patients do not require enzyme-replacement therapy, their blood cells continue to express ADA, and they have no signs of defective detoxification of purine metabolites. Nine patients had immune reconstitution with increases in T-cell counts (median count at 3 years, 1.07x10(9) per liter) and normalization of T-cell function. In the five patients in whom intravenous immune globulin replacement was discontinued, antigen-specific antibody responses were elicited after exposure to vaccines or viral antigens. Effective protection against infections and improvement in physical development made a normal lifestyle possible. Serious adverse events included prolonged neutropenia (in two patients), hypertension (in one), central-venous-catheter-related infections (in two), Epstein-Barr virus reactivation (in one), and autoimmune hepatitis (in one). CONCLUSIONS: Gene therapy, combined with reduced-intensity conditioning, is a safe and effective treatment for SCID in patients with ADA deficiency.

19166862,"Effects of resveratrol on nucleotide degrading enzymes in streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats.AIMS: Diabetes mellitus is associated with platelet alterations that may contribute to the development of cardiovascular complications. The present study investigates the effects of resveratrol (RSV), an important compound with cardioprotective activities, on NTPDase, ecto-nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase (E-NPP), 5'-nucleotidase and adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activities in platelets from streptozotocin (STZ)-induced diabetic rats. MAIN METHODS: The animals were divided into six groups (n=8): control/saline; control/RSV 10 mg/kg; control/RSV 20 mg/kg; diabetic/saline; diabetic/RSV 10 mg/kg; diabetic/RSV 20 mg/kg. RSV was administered during 30 days and after this period the blood was collected for enzymatic assay. KEY FINDINGS: The results demonstrated that NTPDase, E-NPP and 5'-nucleotidase activities were significantly higher in the diabetic/saline group (P&lt;0.05) compared to control/saline group. Treatment with RSV significantly increased NTPDase, 5'-nucleotidase and E-NPP activities in the diabetic/RSV10 and diabetic/RSV20 groups (P&lt;0.05) compared to diabetic/saline group. When RSV was administered per se there was also an increase in the activities of these enzymes in the control/RSV10 and control/RSV20 groups (P&lt;0.05) compared to control/saline group. ADA activity was significantly increased in the diabetic/saline group (P&lt;0.05) compared to control/saline group. The treatment with RSV prevented this increase in the diabetic/RSV10 and diabetic/RSV20 groups. No significant differences in ADA activity were observed in the control/RSV10 and control/RSV20 compared to control/saline group. SIGNIFICANCE: The present findings demonstrate alterations in nucleotide hydrolysis in platelets of STZ-induced diabetic rats and treatment with RSV was able to modulate adenine nucleotide hydrolysis, which may be important in the control of the platelet coagulant status in diabetes.",M2
19146750,"The diagnostic utility of adenosine deaminase isoenzymes in tuberculous pleural effusions.SETTING: Pleural adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) levels have been found to be useful in diagnosing tuberculous pleuritis. Elevated ADA levels have been attributed to ADA2 isoenzyme, although no comprehensive studies have evaluated ADA2 as a diagnostic test. OBJECTIVE: To estimate the diagnostic accuracy of ADA and ADA2 in diagnosing tuberculous pleurisy. METHOD: A 3-year retrospective study was carried out. ADA and ADA2 were determined on patients diagnosed according to predetermined criteria. RESULTS: A total of 951 samples were received, including 387 patients with tuberculosis (TB). ADA values&gt;or=52.4 U/l yielded a sensitivity, specificity and positive (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) respectively of 93.7% (95%CI 90.0-96.0), 88.7% (95%CI 85.7-91.3), 85.5% (95%CI 81.7-88.8) and 95.2% (95%CI 92.9-96.9). ADA2 values&gt;or=40.6 U/l yielded a sensitivity, specificity and PPV and NPV of respectively 97.2% (95%CI 95.0-98.7), 94.2% (95%CI 91.8-96.0), 92.2% (95%CI 89.1-94.7) and 98.0% (95%CI 96.3-99.0).

A total of 25 adult male rats were divided into four experimental groups as follows: control group (n = 7), INH-treated group (n = 6), INH + CAPE-treated group (n = 6), and INH + erdosteine-treated group (n = 6). INH, INH-CAPE, and INH-erdosteine-treated groups were treated orally with INH 50 mg/kg daily and with the tap water for 15 days. Control group was given only tap water. CAPE was intraperitoneally injected for 15 days at a dose of 10 micromol/kg. Erdosteine was treated orally for 15 days at a dose of 10 mg/kg/day. The injection of INH led to a significant increase in the activities of ADA, XO, and NO levels in RBCs of rats. Co-treatment with CAPE caused a significant decrease in the activities of ADA and XO and the levels of NO in RBCs. In addition, co-treatment with erdosteine caused a significant decrease in the activities of ADA and XO and the levels of NO in RBCs. The results of this study showed that ADA, XO, and NO may play an important role in the pathogenesis of INH-induced oxidative stress in RBCs. CAPE and erdosteine may have protective potential in this process and they may become a promising drug in the prevention of this undesired side effect of INH.",M2

19019667,"Adenosine deaminase and adenosine receptor polymorphisms in aspirin-intolerant asthma.In asthmatic airways, adenosine is a potent bronchoconstrictor with either pro- or anti-inflammatory effects depending on receptor interactions. While aspirin has been suggested to mediate adenosine action, the roles of adenosine and its receptors in aspirin-intolerant asthma (AIA) are not well-defined. Therefore, we evaluated associations between genetic polymorphisms of adenosine deaminase and the four adenosine receptors (A(1), A(2A), A(2B), and A(3)) with the AIA phenotype. The genes for adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) and the four adenosine receptors (ADORA1, ADORA2A, ADORA2B, and ADORA3) were screened by direct sequencing, and 13 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were selected among 23 polymorphisms. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, we compared the frequencies of SNP genotypes and haplotypes among 136 patients with AIA, 181 patients with aspirin-tolerant asthma (ATA), and 183 normal individuals. We found significant differences between normal and patients with AIA in the ADORA1 SNP genotype frequencies for 1405C&gt;T (P=0.001) and A102A (P=0.013). No other significant associations were detected for the other SNPs. In the haplotype analysis, ht[C-T-G] (P=0.003) and ht[A-C-G] (P=0.032) in ADORA1 and ht[A-T] in ADORA2 (P=0.013) were significantly associated with AIA. Genetic polymorphisms of adenosine receptors A(1) and A(2A) were associated with AIA, suggesting that adenosine might play a crucial role in the development of AIA through interactions with the A(1) and A(2A) receptors.",M2
19018008,"Restoration of adenosine deaminase-deficient human thymocyte development in vitro by inhibition of deoxynucleoside kinases.Mutations in the gene encoding adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>), a purine salvage enzyme, lead to immunodeficiency in humans. Although ADA deficiency has been analyzed in cell culture and murine models, information is lacking concerning its impact on the development of human thymocytes. We have used chimeric human/mouse fetal thymic organ culture to study ADA-deficient human thymocyte development in an  in vivo-like  environment where toxic metabolites accumulate in situ. Inhibition of ADA during human thymocyte development resulted in a severe reduction in cellular expansion as well as impaired differentiation, largely affecting mature thymocyte populations. Thymocyte differentiation was not blocked at a discrete stage; rather, the paucity of mature thymocytes was due to the induction of apoptosis as evidenced by activation of caspases and was accompanied by the accumulation of intracellular dATP. Inhibition of adenosine kinase and deoxycytidine kinase prevented the accumulation of dATP and restored thymocyte differentiation and proliferation. Our work reveals that multiple deoxynucleoside kinases are involved in the phosphorylation of deoxyadenosine when ADA is absent, and suggests an alternate therapeutic strategy for treatment of ADA-deficient patients.",M2

18953538,"Assessment of adenosine deaminase levels in rheumatoid arthritis patients receiving anti-TNF-alpha therapy.Anti-TNF-alpha agents are increasingly used in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) treatment and that is known to increase the risk of tuberculosis (TB) reactivation. Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) levels are shown to increase to high levels in TB patients. Our aim is to investigate the serum ADA levels in RA patients being treated with anti-TNF-alpha and to compare the results with the patients on DMARD therapy. The study groups comprised of 56 RA patients (45 female, mean age 49) who were treated either with two or three DMARDs, 32 RA patients with anti-TNF-alpha treatment (26 female, mean age 46) and 20 healthy controls (10 female, mean age 48). All patients fulfilled the 1987 ACR criteria for RA. DAS28 score was calculated for all subjects. When compared to healthy controls, ADA levels were measured statistically higher both in patient groups (P = 0.046, 0.002). ADA levels in anti-TNF-alpha group were similar to conventional therapy (11.3 +/- 2.7, 10.9 +/- 4.01; P = 0.76). PPD was positive in 17 RA patients in the anti-TNF-alpha treatment group (%53). The ADA levels were found to be similar in the anti-TNF-alpha group when compared according to the PPD positivity (positive, 12.4 +/- 3.7; negative, 10.5 +/- 2.1; P = 0.02). No correlation was found between the ADA levels and age, disease duration, ESR, CRP, DAS 28 and HAQ score. In this study, we observed that RA patients at remission taking DMARD or anti-TNF-alpha therapy have similar levels of serum ADA. Although serum ADA levels during TB infection increase much higher, in our study, ADA levels of all RA patients were lower than 15 IU/L. Elevated ADA levels may be a clue for diagnosis of TB in patients who were on anti-TNF-alpha therapy.",M2
18952502,"Immunologic reconstitution during PEG-<e>ADA</e> therapy in an unusual mosaic ADA deficient patient.We report detailed genetic and immunologic studies in a patient diagnosed with adenosine deaminase (ADA) deficiency and combined immune deficiency at age 5 years. At the time of diagnosis, although all other lymphocyte subsets were depleted, circulating CD8(+) T cells with a terminally differentiated phenotype were abundant and expressed normal ADA activity due to a reversion mutation in a CD8(+) T cell or precursor. Over the first 9 months of replacement therapy with PEG-ADA, the patient steadily accumulated mature naïve CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells, as well as CD4(+)/FOXP3(+) regulatory T cells, consistent with restoration of a functional cellular immune system. While CD19(+) naïve B cells also accumulated in response to PEG-ADA therapy, a high proportion of these B cells exhibited an immature surface marker phenotype even after 9 months, and immunization with neoantigen bacteriophage varphiX174 demonstrated a markedly subnormal humoral immune response. Our observations in this single patient have important implications for gene therapy of human ADA deficiency, as they indicate that ADA expression within even a large circulating lymphocyte population may not be sufficient to support adequate immune reconstitution. They also suggest that an immature surface marker phenotype of the peripheral B cell compartment may be a useful surrogate marker for incomplete humoral immune reconstitution during enzyme replacement, and possibly other forms of hematopoietic cell therapies.",M2
18840621,"Effect of cardiovascular drugs on adenosine deaminase activity.OBJECTIVE: Adenosine deaminase catalyzes the conversion of adenosine and deoxyadenosine to inosine and deoxyinosine, respectively. Because raising adenosine concentration can affect several physiological processes we studied the effect of a selection of cardiological drugs on adenosine deaminase activity in red blood cells and rabbit plasma after 21 days administration. METHODS AND RESULTS: We determined the activity of adenosine deaminase isoenzymes (<e>ADA</e>(1) and ADA(2)). Simvastatin, aspirin, metoprolol, and isosorbide mononitrate significantly decreased plasma total adenosine activity (by 50%, 34%, 29%, and 19%, respectively; P &lt; .05 to P &lt; .001) mainly by decreasing the activity of ADA(2). CONCLUSIONS: As a consequence of decreased ADA(2) activity , the half-life of adenosine will be lengthened. This may, at least in part, explain some of the beneficial effects of analyzed drugs. Our results might be clinically relevant in patients with coronary artery disease, acute coronary syndromes, heart failure, or stroke where the investigated drugs are commonly used. However, our results should be confirmed in large studies in humans.",M2
18822475,"[Diagnostic characteristics of adenosine deaminase test in Byelorussian patients with tuberculous pleurisy]The results of studying the diagnostic value of changes in the pleural fluid and serum activities of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) and its isozymes are analyzed in Byelorussian patients with tuberculous pleurisy. There is an increased serum and pleural fluid ADA activity in the patients with tuberculous pleurisy caused mainly by a rise in ADA2 activity. The test determining the activity of ADA, and ADA2 in particular, has shown high sensitivity and specificity as compared with the results obtained in other countries. The diagnostic efficacy of determination of these indices in the serum is also high, but it is lower than that in the pleural fluid.",M2
18812052,"Adenosine deaminase estimation and multiplex polymerase chain reaction in diagnosis of extra-pulmonary tuberculosis.SETTING: Extra-pulmonary tuberculosis (EPTB), including mycobacteriosis, contributes 15-20% of all tuberculosis (TB) cases. The diagnosis of EPTB remains elusive because of the inadequate sensitivity of routine and conventional bacteriological methods for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and related organisms in clinical specimens such as cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), pleural fluid and peritoneal fluid. OBJECTIVE: To develop a better diagnostic marker for EPTB. DESIGN: In our study, 179 cases of EPTB were analysed for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) smear, adenosine deaminase activity (<e>ADA</e>) and multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Although estimation of ADA is helpful, its sensitivity and specificity varies widely. On the other hand, a multiplex PCR using amplicons such as IS6110, dnaJ gene and hsp65 genes has high sensitivity (60-88%) and specificity (81-100%). RESULTS: On comparing AFB and ADA results with PCR, the PCR is clearly more effective than AFB (P &lt; 0.001) and ADA estimation (P &lt; 0.02) in CSF. The same result was observed with peritoneal fluid (P &lt; 0.001 vs. P &lt; 0.05) and pleural fluid (P &lt; 0.001 and P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The study shows that multiplex PCR remains the best tool and is a much better marker for diagnosing EPTB.",M2
18809912,"Adenosine receptor antagonists alter the stability of human epileptic GABAA receptors.We examined how the endogenous anticonvulsant adenosine might influence gamma-aminobutyric acid type A (GABA(A)) receptor stability and which adenosine receptors (ARs) were involved. Upon repetitive activation (GABA 500 microM), GABA(A) receptors, microtransplanted into Xenopus oocytes from neurosurgically resected epileptic human nervous tissues, exhibited an obvious GABA(A)-current (I(GABA)) run-down, which was consistently and significantly reduced by treatment with the nonselective adenosine receptor antagonist CGS15943 (100 nM) or with adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) (1 units/ml), that inactivates adenosine. It was also found that selective antagonists of A2B (MRS1706, 10 nM) or A3 (MRS1334, 30 nM) receptors reduced I(GABA) run-down, whereas treatment with the specific A1 receptor antagonist DPCPX (10 nM) was ineffective. The selective A2A receptor antagonist SCH58261 (10 nM) reduced or potentiated I(GABA) run-down in approximately 40% and approximately 20% of tested oocytes, respectively. The ADA-resistant, AR agonist 2-chloroadenosine (2-CA) (10 microM) potentiated I(GABA) run-down but only in approximately 20% of tested oocytes. CGS15943 administration again decreased I(GABA) run-down in patch-clamped neurons from either human or rat neocortex slices. I(GABA) run-down in pyramidal neurons was equivalent in A1 receptor-deficient and wt neurons but much larger in neurons from A2A receptor-deficient mice, indicating that, in mouse cortex, GABA(A)-receptor stability is tonically influenced by A2A but not by A1 receptors. I(GABA) run-down from wt mice was not affected by 2-CA, suggesting maximal ARs activity by endogenous adenosine. Our findings strongly suggest that cortical A2-A3 receptors alter the stability of GABA(A) receptors, which could offer therapeutic opportunities.",M2
18794722,"The 22G&gt;A polymorphism in the adenosine deaminase gene impairs catalytic function but does not affect reactive hyperaemia in humans in vivo.OBJECTIVES: During ischaemia, the extracellular concentration of the endogenous nucleoside adenosine increases rapidly. Subsequent adenosine receptor stimulation induces various effects, including vasodilation, which can protect the tissue against the ischaemic insult. Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) is an enzyme that catalyzes the irreversible deamination of adenosine. We hypothesized that the 22G&gt;A polymorphism in the ADA gene inhibits its catalytic activity, and potentiates the protective effects of adenosine. METHODS: In 96 healthy volunteers, blood was drawn to determine the ADA genotype, and the Vmax and Km values of the ADA from isolated erythrocytes. In a subgroup of volunteers (n=40) we measured the forearm vasodilator response to 13 min of forearm ischaemia using venous occlusion plethysmography as a read-out parameter for adenosine receptor stimulation. RESULTS: Although healthy volunteers with the 22GA genotype had a lower Vmax value of ADA than volunteers with the GG genotype (61.6+/-4.3 ng/min/mg, n=14, vs. 78.0+/-2.8 ng/min/mg, n=82; P=0.02), this did not potentiate the forearm vasodilator response to 13 min of ischaemia (77.4+/-8.8 ml/dl in the GA group (n=5) vs. 87.0+/-5.0 ml/dl (n=35), area under the curve, P=0.3). CONCLUSION: We conclude that heterozygosity for the 22G&gt;A variant of ADA, although reducing catalytic activity, does not enhance forearm reactive hyperaemia. Therefore, the 22G&gt;A variant probably does not contribute to any variability in the protective cardiovascular effects of adenosine.",M2
18774942,"Complex of dipeptidyl peptidase II with adenosine deaminase.Dipeptidyl peptidase II (DPPII) from bovine kidney cortex and lung was purified to the electrophoretically homogeneous state. The molecular and catalytic characteristics of the enzyme were determined. It was revealed that DPPII preparations possess adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity at all purification steps. For the first time, the ADA-binding ability of DPPII has been shown similar to the well-known ADA-binding enzyme, DPPIV. The dissociation constant of the DPPII-ADA complex was estimated using a resonant mirror biosensor (80 nM), fluorescence polarization (60 nM), and differential spectroscopy (36 nM) techniques. The data demonstrate that DPPII can form a complex with ADA, but with one order of magnitude higher dissociation constant than that of DPPIV (7.8 nM).",M2
18723708,"Serum adenosine deaminase levels in diagnosis of acute appendicitis.BACKGROUND: Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) is found in most tissues including lymphoid cells and lymph nodes. It is a marker of T lymphocyte activation. The role of type 1 and type 2 T helper cells in appendicitis has been investigated experimentally. Serum ADA levels in acute appendicitis have not previously been studied. AIM: To assess the serum levels of ADA in patients with acute appendicitis. METHODS: Serum levels of ADA were investigated in 30 cases with acute appendicitis (mean age 26 years; male/female 17/13) and 21 healthy controls (mean age 40 years; male/female 11/10). Levels of ADA were compared in patients with acute appendicitis and healthy controls. Correlation analysis between ADA and other inflammatory markers (C-reactive protein (CRP), high-sensitivity CRP, erythrocyte sedimentation rate and white blood cell count) was also performed. RESULTS: Mean (SD) serum ADA levels were significantly higher in those with acute appendicitis than in the control group (13.41 (3.56) U/l vs 9.39 (1.22) U/l; p&lt;0.001). There was no correlation between ADA and the other inflammatory markers investigated. CONCLUSIONS: Although serum levels of ADA do not correlate with other known inflammatory markers, its serum level is increased in acute appendicitis and it has a higher positive predictive value.",M2
18721115,"Pentostatin in chronic lymphocytic leukemia.BACKGROUND: Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a disease that typically afflicts older individuals with a median age of diagnosis in the eighth decade of life for which treatments available now are not curative. Although purine analogue based combinations produce complete responses (CRs) in many patients, the use of these combinations has been limited by toxicity including myelosuppression and an increased risk of infectious complications. OBJECTIVE: To identify the role of pentostatin, a specific inhibitor of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>), in the treatment of CLL. We compare pentostatin to other purine analogues, most notably fludarabine, with regard to safety and efficacy. Finally, we review the use of pentostatin in other diseases. METHODS: The scope of this review encompasses the history of treatment for CLL as well as the genesis of modern combination chemoimmunotherapy and the advantages of pentostatin within such a treatment program. RESULTS: Combination therapy with pentostatin seems to provide response frequencies comparable to fludarabine based combinations but with less toxicity and with greater ease of administration.",M2
18705490,"Auxiliary tools in tuberculosis. The hemolysis in pleural fluids underestimate the values of adenosine deaminase activity determined by the method of Giusti.The increase of adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity in pleural fluids (PF) is considered a useful tool in the diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis. It is known that numerous photometric methods are interfered by the hemolysis, as a result, hemolyzed specimens -or with blood- received in the laboratory are frequently rejected. In order to establish if the values of ADA were affected by the hemolysis or blood, ADA was determined in individual and pooled PF samples with the aggregate of erythrocyte lysate (H) or hemolyzed whole blood (HWB) from 312 mg/l to 12 g/l (final concentrations of hemoglobin in the samples), and plasma in appropriate dilutions. Negative interferences were caused by the H and HWB, starting already of 500 mg/l with relative errors until 50% in some cases, depending on the ADA activity. Increments of hemoglobin increased the negative interference. The aggregate of plasma increased slightly the ADA activity although it was insufficient for neutralize the negative effect of hemolysis. The clinical significance of the negative interference is in relation to the amount of hemoglobin present in the sample and the ADA activity. Near the cutoff (40 U/l) this interference can lead to discard erroneously the diagnosis of pleural tuberculosis.",M2
18680557,"Human adenosine deaminase as an allosteric modulator of human A(1) adenosine receptor: abolishment of negative cooperativity for [H](R)-pia binding to the caudate nucleus.It has been shown that adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>; EC 3.5.4.4) behaves as an ecto-enzyme anchored to membrane proteins, among them A(1) adenosine receptors (A(1)Rs). Bovine ADA interacts with A(1)Rs from many species and regulates agonists binding to receptors in an activity-independent form. However, it was not known whether human ADA exerted any effect on the agonist binding to human A(1)Rs, because of both technical difficulties in obtaining pure human ADA and tissues containing human A(1)Rs. In this study, human ADA was purified to homogeneity. Taking in consideration that A(1)Rs form homodimers and taking advantage of a new procedure to fit binding data to receptors dimers, which allows to calculate ligand dissociation constants and the degree of cooperativity between the two subunits in the dimer, here it is demonstrated that human ADA markedly enhances the agonist and antagonist affinity and abolishes the negative cooperativity on agonist binding to human striatal A(1)Rs. ADA also increases the ability of the agonist to decrease the forskolin-induced cAMP levels. The results show that human ADA, apart from reducing the adenosine concentration and thus preventing A(1)R desensitization, binds to A(1)R behaving as an allosteric effector that markedly enhances agonist affinity and increases receptor functionality. The physiological role of the interaction is to make receptors more sensitive to adenosine. This powerful regulation has important implications for the physiology and pharmacology of neuronal A(1)Rs.",M2
18673302,"Hydrolytic cleavage of N6-substituted adenine derivatives by eukaryotic adenine and adenosine deaminases.Homogeneous adenine deaminases (EC 3.5.4.2) from the yeasts Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe and a putative <e>ADA</e> (adenosine deaminase; EC 3.5.4.4) from Arabidopsis thaliana were obtained for the first time as purified recombinant proteins by molecular cloning of the corresponding genes and their overexpression in Escherichia coli. The enzymes showed comparable molecular properties with well-known mammalian ADAs, but exhibited much lower k(cat) values. Adenine was the most favoured substrate for the yeast enzymes, whereas the plant enzyme showed only very low activities with either adenine, adenosine, AMP or ATP. Interestingly, the yeast enzymes also hydrolysed N6-substituted adenines from cytokinins, a group of plant hormones, cleaving them to inosine and the corresponding side chain amine. The hydrolytic cleavage of synthetic cytokinin 2,6-di-substituted analogues that are used in cancer therapy, such as olomoucine, roscovitine and bohemine, was subsequently shown for a reference sample of human ADA1. ADA1, however, showed a different reaction mechanism to that of the yeast enzymes, hydrolysing the compounds to an adenine derivative and a side chain alcohol. The reaction products were identified using reference compounds on HPLC coupled to UV and Q-TOF (quadrupole-time-of-flight) detectors.The ADA1 activity may constitute the debenzylation metabolic route already described for bohemine and, as a consequence, it may compromise the physiological or therapeutic effects of exogenously applied cytokinin derivatives.",M2
18665218,"Adenosine deaminase activity is a sensitive marker for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleuritis in patients with very low CD4 counts.BACKGROUND: Adenosine Deaminase Activity (<e>ADA</e>) is a commonly used marker for the diagnosis of tuberculous pleural effusion. There has been concern about its usefulness in immunocompromised patients, especially HIV positive patients with very low CD4 counts. The objective of this study was to evaluate the sensitivity of ADA in pleural fluid in patients with low CD4 counts. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a retrospective case control study. Medical files of patients with tuberculous pleuritis and non-tuberculous pleuritis were reviewed. Clinical characteristics, CD4 cell counts in blood and biochemical markers in pleural fluid, including ADA were recorded. RESULTS: One ninety seven tuberculous pleuritis and 40 non-tuberculous pleuritis patients were evaluated. Using the cut-off value of 30 U/L, the overall sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio, and negative likelihood ratio of ADA was 94%, 95%, 19, and 0.06 respectively. The mean CD4 cell counts among TB pleuritis patients was 29 and 153 cells/microL in patients with CD4 &lt;50 cells/microL and &gt;50 cells/microL, (p&lt;0.05) respectively. The corresponding mean ADA values for these patients were 76 U/L and 72 U/L respectively (p&gt;0.5). There was no correlation between ADA values and CD4 cell counts (r = -0.120, p = 0.369). CONCLUSION: ADA analysis is a sensitive marker of tuberculous pleuritis even in HIV patients with very low CD4 counts in a high TB endemic region. The ADA assay is inexpensive, rapid, and simple to perform and is of great value for the immediate diagnosis of tuberculous pleuritis while waiting for culture result and this has a positive impact on patient outcome.",M2
18652275,"[The influence of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on deaminase adenosine activity]The aim of the study was to evaluate the influence ofnonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on deaminase adenosine activity using animal model. 70 rats of Wistar breed was divided into equal groups of ten. Animals were given intragastrically for three weeks: acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) at doses of 2 and 10 mg/kg bw/day, diclofenac at doses of 1 and 5 mg/kg bw/day, nimesulide at doses of 2.5 mg and 12.5 mg/kg bw/day. Control group received only water. After 21 days rats were decapitated and blood was collected to assess deaminase adenosine activity in plasma and erythrocytes. It was found that all investigated drugs inhibit <e>ADA</e> activity in plasma and ADA2 isoenzyme is responsible for this inhibition. Deaminase adenosine activity in erythrocytes is inhibited by ASA and diclofenac but increased by nimesulide.",M2
18608782,"Isolation and characterization of a novel adenosine deaminase inhibitor, IADA-7, from Bacillus sp. J-89.Adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>), an enzyme involved in purine metabolism, catalyzes the hydrolytic breakdown of adenosine into inosine and free ammonia. ADA regulation has been targeted as a potential therapeutic agent for viral infections and lymphoproliferative disorders. In this study, we isolated a novel ADA inhibitor from a culture of Bacillus sp. J-89, and evaluated its anti-proliferative activity on human cancer cell lines. The ADA inhibitor was deduced as a 2-N-methyl-2,4-diazacycloheptanone by analyses of UV, IR, EI-MASS, (1)H-NMR, (13)C-(1)H NMR, and (13)C-NMR spectroscopy, and was designated IADA-7. IADA-7 was shown to inhibit purified mammalian and Actinomyces ADA. IADA-7 also inhibited the proliferation of both Jurkat T cells (IC(50) = 15 microg/mL) and J 82 (human transitional-cell carcinoma, bladder) cells (IC(50) = 25 microg/mL). In Jurkat T cells, apoptosis with 15 microg/mL IADA-7 for 24 and 48 hours was 9 and 13%, respectively. These results suggest that IADA-7 can inhibit ADA activity in multiple species and that it may represent a good candidate as an anti-cancer therapeutic agent due to its demonstrated anti-proliferative activity on cancer cells.",M2

We have analyzed the effect of ADA enzyme inhibition in human thymocyte suspension cultures with regard to accumulation of intracellular dATP and induction of apoptosis. We demonstrate that while inhibition of deoxycytidine kinase will prevent the accumulation of dATP and induction of apoptosis to a large degree, inhibition of both deoxycytidine kinase and adenosine kinase completely abrogates the accumulation of dATP and significantly reduces the induction of apoptosis. Thus, both deoxynucleoside kinases are involved in this model of ADA deficiency.",M2

The standard of care for adenosine deaminase deficient severe combined immune deficiency (ADA-SCID) includes enzyme replacement therapy or bone marrow transplantation. Gene therapies for ADA-SCID over nearly two decades have exclusively involved retroviral vectors targeted to lymphocytes and hematopoetic progenitors. These groundbreaking gene therapies represent a revolution in clinical medicine, but come with several challenges, including the risk of insertional mutagenesis. An alternative gene therapy for ADA-SCID may utilize recombinant adeno-associated virus vectors in vivo, with numerous target tissues, to foster ectopic expression and secretion of adenosine deaminase.

18597230,"Nitric oxide level and adenosine deaminase activity in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage.OBJECTIVE: Adenosine and nitric oxide (NO) are known as vasodilatators. We investigated adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) activity and NO concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of patients with subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH). METHODS: Forty patients with SAH and 10 controls were included in the study. Nitrate level and ADA activity were measured in CSF. SAH patients were grouped according to the presence of angiographic vasospasm, Hunt and Hess grading, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) and Fisher Grade (FG). RESULTS: The level of NO markers in SAH patients decreased when compared to that in the control group (p &lt; 0.05). However, NO markers in patients with vasospasm was higher than in that of patients without vasospasm (p &lt; 0.05). ADA activity increased in patients with SAH (p &lt; 0.01) and also patients with angiographic vasospasm (p &lt; 0.05). ADA activity in the poor-grade SAH group was higher than that in the good-grade SAH group. The group with the lower GCS showed increased ADA activity compared to those with a higher GCS score (p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, patients with FG 4 had a higher level of ADA activity compared to FG 1 and 2 and FG 3 (p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). CONCLUSION: Decreased NO level may participate in the early development of vasospasm. However, the increased level of ADA activity in the SAH patients with the poor clinical and consciousness level may have resulted from the ischemic cerebral insult.",M2
18602399,"Structures of substrate- and inhibitor-bound adenosine deaminase from a human malaria parasite show a dramatic conformational change and shed light on drug selectivity.Plasmodium and other apicomplexan parasites are deficient in purine biosynthesis, relying instead on the salvage of purines from their host environment. Therefore, interference with the purine salvage pathway is an attractive therapeutic target. The plasmodial enzyme adenosine deaminase (<e>ADA</e>) plays a central role in purine salvage and, unlike mammalian ADA homologs, has a further secondary role in methylthiopurine recycling. For this reason, plasmodial ADA accepts a wider range of substrates, as it is responsible for deamination of both adenosine and 5'-methylthioadenosine. The latter substrate is not accepted by mammalian ADA homologs. The structural basis for this natural difference in specificity between plasmodial and mammalian ADA has not been well understood. We now report crystal structures of Plasmodium vivax ADA in complex with adenosine, guanosine, and the picomolar inhibitor 2'-deoxycoformycin. These structures highlight a drastic conformational change in plasmodial ADA upon substrate binding that has not been observed for mammalian ADA enzymes. Further, these complexes illuminate the structural basis for the differential substrate specificity and potential drug selectivity between mammalian and parasite enzymes.",M2
