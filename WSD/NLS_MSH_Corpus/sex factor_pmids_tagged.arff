18551208,"Effects of oral health behaviors and socioeconomic factors on a group of Turkish adolescents.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of socioeconomic factors and oral health behaviors on adolescents in Turkey. METHOD AND MATERIALS: Data were collected through a self-administered questionnaire. The sample consisted of 582 randomly selected adolescents, 309 boys and 273 girls, who presented over a 3-month period with various complaints to the Hacettepe University Medical Faculty Adolescent Clinic. RESULTS: Halitosis complaints were higher in the 11-, 12-, and 13-year-old groups than in other age groups (P &lt; .05). When the <e>sex factor</e> was examined, prevalence of dental fear was found to be higher among girls, while irregular toothbrushing was seen more among boys. In parallel to the increase in the education levels of the parents, an increase was seen in the regular dental visits by the adolescents (P &lt; .05). As the socioeconomic status of the family increased, frequency of dental visits, rate of dental floss usage, and number of teeth with restorations increased. In parallel with the dental visit increase, the rate of restored teeth increased. Of those who did not have regular dental visits because of financial difficulties, however, the rate of teeth with restorations was low. CONCLUSION: A strong correlation exists between the oral health behaviors, socioeconomic and sociodemographic factors, and the oral health status of Turkish adolescents.",M1

METHODS: ADHD was diagnosed according to the DSM-IV criteria. DNA was extracted and PCR was performed to examine the DBH-1021C--&gt;T polymorphism. HHRR was used to test the association of dopamine beta-hydroxylase gene with different subtypes of ADHD. RESULTS: HHRR results showed this polymorphism had a tendency to be associated with the inattention subtype (P=0.067) and the combined subtype (P=0.076). The T allele was the protective factor of the inattentive subtype (P=0.07), and the risk factor of the combined subtype (P=0.08). After dividing the 292 nuclear families according to sex, DBH-1021C--&gt;T polymorphism was found to be associated with the combined subtype (P=0.04) with the T allele as the risk factor (P=0.02). There were no positive findings among the girl nuclear families of ADHD. CONCLUSION: DBH gene is related to ADHD combined subtype and inattention subtype. The genetic basis of ADHD combined subtype and is inattention is different, and is influenced by <e>sex factor</e>.",M1
14625594,"Prediction of the size of un-erupted permanent cuspids and bicuspids in a Saudi sample: a pilot study.The purpose of this study was to produce an estimated equation for the prediction of unerupted cuspids and bicuspids for the Saudi population. In this study, dental casts of 65 Saudi subjects (37 males and 28 females) were used. The subjects' age ranged from 18 to 25 years. The mesiodistal width of all permanent teeth was measured. The data was subjected to regression analysis. Results showed the Tanaka and Johnston equations overestimate the predicted tooth width of the un-erupted cuspids and bicuspids in Saudis. Results showed the predicted tooth width of Saudis (males and females) is closer to the 50% level of confidence in Moyer's chart. Multiple regression equations were estimated including the <e>sex factor</e>. Accordingly, two equations were estimated for the prediction of the tooth width of the un-erupted cuspids and bicuspids for the Saudi males and females. Based on the results, it can be concluded the 50% data is more accurate than the commonly used percentage Moyer's table (75%) when both sexes are combined. Further studies are needed to confirm the findings of this study.",M1
9538985,"Fractional esterification rate of HDL particles in patients with type 2 diabetes. Relation to coronary heart disease risk factors.OBJECTIVE: To study the fractional esterification rate of cholesterol on HDL particles (FERHDL) in adults with type 2 diabetes and assess its correlation with serum lipids and other coronary heart disease (CHD) risk factors. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: FERHDL was measured in 90 adult (57 men, 33 women) patients by an isotopic assay method involving several steps, including preparation of VLDL- and LDL-depleted plasma, labeling of the sample with a trace amount of tritiated cholesterol, separation of free and esterified cholesterol fractions by chromatography post incubation, and subsequent counting of radioactivity in the individual fractions. RESULTS: Male patients have higher FERHDL values than their female counterparts. When HDL cholesterol was controlled for in a multivariate regression analysis, the <e>sex factor</e> was not significant. There was a significant positive correlation between FERHDL and plasma total cholesterol (r = 0.32), triglycerides (r = 0.82), apolipoprotein B (apo B; r = 0.48), insulin (r = 0.46), BMI (r = 0.31), and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; r = 0.50). There was a negative correlation between FERHDL and HDL cholesterol (r = -0.76) and apolipoprotein AI (r = -0.60). When both HDL cholesterol and triglycerides were controlled for, the only significant correlation was between FERHDL and BMI. CONCLUSIONS: Non-insulin-requiring type 2 diabetic patients have FERHDL, which correlated positively with triglycerides and negatively with HDL cholesterol. The positive correlation of FERHDL with serum insulin, WHR, total cholesterol, and apo B, but not that with BMI, loses its significance when HDL cholesterol and triglycerides are controlled. The sex difference between men and women in FERHDL also loses its significance when HDL cholesterol is controlled.",M1
8986077,"[An investigation of the factors influencing serum pepsinogen levels--sex, age, smoking, drinking]BACKGROUND: Until now, the influence of sex, age, smoking, drinking on serum pepsinogen levels has been assessed by single regression analysis. However, the influence of those factors on pepsinogen levels should be assessed exactly by multiple regression analyses. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: 891 subjects were collected from by questionnaire and serum tests. Analyses were done with serum pepsinogen I (PG I), pepsinogen II (PG II) and pepsinogen I/II ratio (PG I/II) as a criterion variable and as categorized explanatory variables, sex, age, current or past smoking habit, and current drinking habit. And analyses are done by Mann-Whitney U test, correlation coefficient, single regression method, multiple regression method. RESULTS: PG I level is significantly higher in men than in women by Mann-Whitney U test. But the effect of <e>sex factor</e> is not remarkable by multiple regression analyses. PG II level increased and PG I/II level decreased with progression of age by all analyses methods. Current or past smoking elevates PG I level by Mann-Whitney U test, but current smoking dose and past smoking amount showed no dose-dependent associations with PG I level. Current drinking elevates PG I level by Mann-Whitney U test, but current drinking dose showed no dose-dependent associations with PG I. However, the effects of current smoking and current drinking to serum PG levels is not so large by multiple regression analyses. CONCLUSION: The effects of sex, current smoking and current drinking to serum PG levels are not remarkable by multiple regression analyses. Significantly, PG II level increased and PG I/II level decreased with progression of age. Therefore it may not be necessary to consider the effects of sex, smoking habit and drinking habit when serum pepsinogen levels are used as markers for gastric cancer.",M1

Histopathological examination revealed an age-related shortening of induction time for renal pelvic carcinomas in males, although actual incidences did not increase. The histological patterns of carcinomas induced in both renal pelvis and urinary bladder demonstrated male mice to be more prone to develop transitional cell carcinomas, while squamous cell carcinomas were more likely to arise in females. Moreover, the <e>sex factor</e> appeared to influence the progression of both renal pelvic and urinary bladder carcinomas.",M1
8108627,"Attitude of medical staff towards victims of violence and assaults--a tentative explanation.Crimes of violence have effects on health care, but have received insufficient attention as regards the questions of identifying hidden violence. What factors could be of relevance to the reception and help given to victims of violence? How much importance should be attributed to the <e>sex factor</e> in staff attitudes? The aim of the present study was to elucidate the attitudes of medical staff towards patients who were the victim of violence or assault. The study covered staff working in the emergency ward at the Central Hospital in Karlstad and at all the health care centres in Karlstad Police District. A questionnaire was sent out to all doctors and nurses at the units involved. In general, the results showed a great commitment and sense of responsibility, and a specific concentration of resources on female patients on the part of the female staff. The explanatory model revealed that attitudes of staff to victims of violence and assault are partly determined by the sex of the staff but that the place of work was definitely not without importance as an explanatory factor.",M1

4023613,"Hypersecretion of gastric acid in a representative Finnish family sample.To evaluate the family behaviour of acid secretion and particularly of 'hypersecretion', we have examined by pentagastrin test and direct vision gastric biopsy 342 subjects with a normal mucosa or superficial gastritis of the body mucosa, collected from a large family sample of the Finnish population. Acid output (AO) was expressed in terms of fat-free body weight (FFB), which eliminates the <e>sex factor</e> found by other expressions of AO. Subjects with values above 1.0 mmol/h/FFB were considered 'hypersecretors' (14 subjects, or 4% of the whole sample). They differed from the whole sample with regard to a high prevalence of signs of duodenal ulcer disease, of high serum pepsinogen, and of blood group O and lack of gastric antibodies and of high serum gastrin levels. The Fisher distribution test showed a significant family aggregation of AO values. In addition, at low AO levels there were subgroups with distinct gaps between them. This finding suggests the effect of genetic variation rather than of a common family environment. The occurrence of higher AO values in sibs but not in children of 'hypersecretors' seems to rule out the possibility of a dominant Mendelian inheritance. These present results are considered to be best compatible with a multigenetic mode of inheritance of gastric hypersecretion.",M1

6660006,"[Influence of the <e>sex factor</e> in weight gain caused by chronic use of lithium]The use of lithium, in the treatment and prevention of affective disorders, is considered to be one of the most important break through in modern Psychopharmacology. Side effects are frequently associated with its short and long term use. One of those side-effects, which is common after chronic lithium salt treatment, is a considerable increase in body weight. This side-effect appears to be an important factor in prompting some patients, particularly women, to suspend treatment. In this study, confirming our previous work with an animal model, we found a statistically greater weight increase in women treated chronically with lithium than in men. Our results were apparently not explained by abnormalities in thyroid function. The literature describes those thyroid abnormalities, due to lithium, as being more frequent in women than in men. In an animal model, we now found that higher plasma lithium levels are produced in male, when compared to female rats, when this drug is administered for long periods. If the some tendency is present in men, we could expect a greater probability of toxicity in men than in women. Thus, a lower weigh increase in men. Such could be a possible explanation for our clinical results.",M1

A comparative analysis of the clinical characteristics of schizophrenia in parents-children pairs showed quite definitely that with further selection of general signs reflecting the most essential characteristics of disease, their homogeneity (homo-type) within the family becomes increasingly evident. A high degree of similarity in a number of clinical characteristics in parents-children pairs associated with their sex was also demonstrated.",M1
6181967,"Sex differences in the human group mean SEP.The following results were obtained with SEPs recorded from strictly age-matched normal human subjects, 100 males and 100 females, 22.29 +/- 1.90 years. (1) The <e>sex factor</e> on the wave form of SEP was confirmed highly significant by MANOVA. (2) It was confirmed that the group mean SEP of each sex each converges to a given wave form which significantly differed from each other. (3) The differences in the wave form of the group mean SEP between sexes were established. The group mean SEP for females consisted of the 12 components, N1, P1, N2, P2, N3, P3, N4, P4, N5, P5, N6 and P6, and was approximately tetraphasic within 500 msec in latency, while that for males consisted of the same components except for N4 and P4. The baseline amplitude of the wave form of the group mean SEP, smaller in males than in females, differed significantly between sexes, corresponding to the most remarkable difference in its wave form, in the descending slope from the highest positive peak P2 to the deep negative trough N6, where there was a high convex arch with P4 (80 msec) in females, a low hollow slope without the peak in males. The latencies of the components tended to be longer in males than in females. (4) With scaled SEPs, which were converted from SEPs by amplitude scaling, results were similar to those with SEPs, and the sex difference in the scaled group mean SEP was also verified to be significant. These results indicate the further possibility of data reduction by amplitude scaling.",M1
7082153,"Hand function related to age and sex.After adapting Jebssen's Test of Hand Function to Australian conditions, this study investigated his claim of no significant difference in hand performance among participants younger than 60 years, and determined whether age might be a factor when associated with sex. The method was to test 383 subjects of both sexes in 6 age groups. A 2-factor analysis with age and sex as factors yielded significant differences (p less than 0.01) for  grip strength   manipulating small objects,  and  moving large heavy objects,  and indications of significance (p less than 0.05) for  card turning  and  moving large light objects.  The <e>sex factor</e> showed males to be significantly better  grip strength,  in  moving large heavy objects,  and  large light objects,  except in the 66-99 age interval where females were significantly better on teh last 2 variables. Females performed better on  writing  and were generally better in  manipulating small objects.  These results suggest that the one set of norms given by Jebsen for 60 years and less for each sex, should be replaced by 5 or more, even though the differences were quite small when standard deviations were considered.",M1

We failed to find true mates in this trial, even when the cells cured by acridine orange were used to mate with non-cured ones. There were some positive growth when two densed cell suspensions were dropped on the minimum medium, but after subcultured on the minimum medium no growth was found. It seem likely that the bacteria used here, at least, require an enforced cell adhesion, unless true mating is not feasible. The evidence that Corynebacterium renale has pili might be an interesting reference, but we could not find pili in the bacteria used here.",M1

928318,"[Characteristics of development of diabetic neuropathy depending on sex of diabetic patients]The authors present the results of clinico-neurological study on 3976 patients suffering from diabetes with the use of electrophysiological, biochemical and other methods. As revealed, the sex of diabetic patients, particularly at definite age periods produced a significant influence on the time of occurrence and the rate of development of various types of the central and peripheral neuropathy. Thus, at the age of under 30 years almost all the types of diabetic neuropathy originated earlier and developed more rapidly in women, and after the age of 50 years some of these types of neuropathies were more frequent and more pronounced in men. No significant differences in the incidence of many types of diabetic neuropathy were revealed at the age of from 30 to 50 years both in men and in women. The mentioned regularity was most distinctly traced in analysis of distal pelyneuropathy. A hypothesis is put forward on the causes inducing peculiarities of the diabetic neuropathy development depending on the <e>sex factor</e>.",M1

Extracts from neither normal nor infected F+ cells contained an inhibitor of gene expression in vitro. The protein synthesizing systems prepared in vitro from these cells supported T7 early and late protein synthesis with normal efficiency. The content of translational initiation factors in F- and F+ cells, both noninfected and infected, was almost identical. The episome-dependent block of T7 gene expression was observed only in intact cells and detailed kinetics of gene expression in vivo revealed a stop of all transcription and translation at or just before 11 min after T7 infection. The mechanism of F+-dependent T7 exclusion involves both episomal and viral gene products. The data indicate that a T7-induced membrane alteration of the F+ cell membrane leads to cessation of T7 development as well as to the death of the host cell ('suicide').",M1

To further investigate the involvement of CluA in these phenomena, the cluA gene was cloned on a plasmid, downstream from the lactococcal nisA promoter. In a sex-factor-negative MG1363 derivative, nisin-controlled CluA expression resulted in aggregation, despite the absence of the other genes of the sex factor. Therefore, CluA is the only sex factor component responsible for aggregation. The direct involvement of CluA in the establishment of cell-to-cell contact for aggregate formation was observed by electron microscopy using immunogold-labelled CluA antibodies. Inactivation of cluA in an MG1363 background led to a dramatic decrease in sex factor conjugation frequency compared to the parental strain. Increasing levels of CluA expressed in trans in the cluA-inactivated donor strain facilitated a gradual restoration of conjugation frequency, reaching that of the parental strain. In conclusion, CluA is essential for efficient sex factor transfer in conjugation of L. lactis.",M2

This retroelement interrupts the relaxase gene (ltrB) of three L. lactis conjugative elements: plasmids pRS01 and pAH90 and the chromosomal sex factor. Conjugative transfer of a plasmid harboring a segment of the pRS01 conjugative plasmid including the Ll.LtrB intron allows dissemination of Ll.LtrB among L. lactis strains and lateral transfer of this retroelement from L. lactis to Enterococcus faecalis. Here we report the dissemination of the Ll.LtrB group II intron among L. lactis strains following conjugative transfer of the native chromosomally embedded L. lactis sex factor. We demonstrated that Ll.LtrB dissemination is highly variable and often more efficient from this integrative and conjugative element than from an engineered conjugative plasmid. Cotransfer among L. lactis strains of both Ll.LtrB-containing elements, the conjugative plasmid and the sex factor, was detected and shown to be synergistic. Moreover, following their concurrent transfer, both mobilizable elements supported the spread of their respective copies of the Ll.LtrB intron.

8736534,"Regulation of the expression of the traM gene of the F <e>sex factor</e> of Escherichia coli.Conjugative F-plasmid transfer is mediated by the transfer (tra) region which encodes nearly 40 genes, 25 of which are essential for this process in Escherichia coli. TraM is required for conjugation and is encoded on a separate operon between the origin of transfer and the traJ gene. The traJ gene product is the positive regulator of transcription of the 30 kb tra operon, the first gene of which is traY. Using primer-extension assays and immunoblots on the F plasmid itself and its derivatives, we demonstrate that F TraM regulates its own expression from two promoters and that it requires TraY as well as expression of the tra operon for maximal traM transcription. traY is the first gene in the tra operon under the control of the TraJ regulator, which is in turn negatively regulated by the antisense RNA, FinP, and the FinO protein. Thus, a control circuit has been established whereby traM is negatively regulated by the FinOP fertility inhibition system through its repression of TraJ expression, which adversely affects transcription of the traY gene.",M2

F lacks homologs of TrbBP (NTPase) and TrbFP but contains a cluster of genes encoding proteins essential for F conjugation (TraFF, -HF, -UF, -WF, the C-terminal region of TraGF, and TrbCF) that are hallmarks of F-like T4SS. These extra genes have been implicated in phenotypes that are characteristic of F-like systems including pilus retraction and mating pair stabilization. F-like T4SS systems have been found on many conjugative plasmids and in genetic islands on bacterial chromosomes. Although few systems have been studied in detail, F-like T4SS appear to be involved in the transfer of DNA only whereas P- and I-type systems appear to transport protein or nucleoprotein complexes. This review examines the similarities and differences among the T4SS, especially F- and P-like systems, and summarizes the properties of the F transfer region gene products.",M2
16513740,"The Tra domain of the lactococcal CluA surface protein is a unique domain that contributes to <e>sex factor</e> DNA transfer.CluA is a cell surface-presented protein that causes cell aggregation and is essential for a high-efficiency conjugation process in Lactococcus lactis. We know from previous work that in addition to promoting cell-to-cell contact, CluA is involved in sex factor DNA transfer. To define the CluA domains involved in aggregation and in transfer, we first performed random mutagenesis of the cluA gene using a modified mini-Tn7 element which generated five amino acid insertions located throughout the encoded protein. Thirty independent cluA insertion mutants expressing modified CluA proteins at the cell surface were isolated and characterized further. The level of aggregation of each mutant was determined. The cell binding capacity of CluA was affected strongly when the protein had a mutation in its N-terminal region, which defined an aggregation domain extending from amino acid 153 to amino acid 483. Of the cluA mutants that still exhibited aggregation, eight showed an attenuated ability to conjugate, and six mutations were located in a 300-amino-acid C-terminal region of the protein defining a transfer domain (Tra). This result was confirmed by a phenotypic analysis of an additional five mutants obtained using site-directed mutagenesis in which charged amino acids of the Tra domain were replaced by alanine residues. Two distinct functional domains of the CluA protein were defined in this work; the first domain is involved in cell binding specificity, and the Tra domain is probably involved in the formation of the DNA transport machinery. This is the first report of a protein involved in conjugation that actively contributes to DNA transfer and mediates contact between donor and recipient strains.",M2

7915817,"Analysis of the sequence and gene products of the transfer region of the F <e>sex factor</e>.Bacterial conjugation results in the transfer of DNA of either plasmid or chromosomal origin between microorganisms. Transfer begins at a defined point in the DNA sequence, usually called the origin of transfer (oriT). The capacity of conjugative DNA transfer is a property of self-transmissible plasmids and conjugative transposons, which will mobilize other plasmids and DNA sequences that include a compatible oriT locus. This review will concentrate on the genes required for bacterial conjugation that are encoded within the transfer region (or regions) of conjugative plasmids. One of the best-defined conjugation systems is that of the F plasmid, which has been the paradigm for conjugation systems since it was discovered nearly 50 years ago. The F transfer region (over 33 kb) contains about 40 genes, arranged contiguously. These are involved in the synthesis of pili, extracellular filaments which establish contact between donor and recipient cells; mating-pair stabilization; prevention of mating between similar donor cells in a process termed surface exclusions; DNA nicking and transfer during conjugation; and the regulation of expression of these functions. This review is a compendium of the products and other features found in the F transfer region as well as a discussion of their role in conjugation. While the genetics of F transfer have been described extensively, the mechanism of conjugation has proved elusive, in large part because of the low levels of expression of the pilus and the numerous envelope components essential for F plasmid transfer. The advent of molecular genetic techniques has, however, resulted in considerable recent progress. This summary of the known properties of the F transfer region is provided in the hope that it will form a useful basis for future comparison with other conjugation systems.",M2
8604133,"Evidence for involvement of Escherichia coli genes pmbA, csrA and a previously unrecognized gene tldD, in the control of DNA gyrase by letD (ccdB) of <e>sex factor</e> F.The letA (ccdA) and letD (ccdB) genes of the F plasmid, located just outside the sequence essential for replication, contribute to stable maintenance of the plasmid in Escherichia coli cells. The letD gene product acts to inhibit partitioning of chromosomal DNA and cell division by inhibiting DNA gyrase activity, whereas the letA gene product acts to reverse the inhibitory activity of the letD gene product. To identify the host factor(s) involved in this process, we analyzed the mutants that escaped letD expression and their suppressor, and found that the three E. coli genes tldD, tldE and zfiA participate in the process, in addition to the groE genes we reported previously. The tldD and tldE mutations made cells tolerant for letD expression, as did groES mutations, while the mutation in the zfiA gene made tldD, tldE and groES mutants LetD sensitive. We hypothesize that these gene products are factors that modulate activity of DNA gyrase along with the letD gene product; the zfiA gene product acts to inhibit interaction between the LetD protein and the A subunit of DNA gyrase, while the tldD, tldE and groE gene products act to suppress the inhibitory activity of the zfiA gene product. The tldD, tldE, and zfiA genes are located at 70.4, 96.0 and 58.2 minutes on the E. coli chromosome, respectively, and code for proteins with relative molecular masses of 51,000, 48,000 and 6800, respectively. tldD is a novel gene, but the tldE and zfiA genes proved to be the pmbA gene (production of Microcin B17) and the csrA gene (carbon storage regulator), respectively.",M2
9734780,"Regulatory mechanisms in expression of the traY-I operon of <e>sex factor</e> plasmid R100: involvement of traJ and traY gene products.BACKGROUND: The plasmid R100 encodes tra genes essential for conjugal DNA transfer in Escherichia coli. Genetic evidence suggests that the traJ gene encodes a positive regulator for the traY-I operon, which includes almost all the tra genes located downstream of traJ. The molecular mechanism of regulation by TraJ, however, is not yet understood. traY is the most proximal gene in the traY-I operon. TraY promotes DNA transfer by binding to a site, sbyA, near the origin of transfer. TraY is suggested to have another role in regulation of the traY-I operon, since it binds to two other sites, named sbyB and sbyC, located in the region preceding traY-I. RESULTS: Using a traY-lacZ fusion gene, we showed that the traY-I operon was expressed only in the presence of traJ. The TraJ-dependent expression of traY-I required the E. coli arcA gene, which encodes a host factor required for conjugation. TraJ-dependent transcription occurred from a promoter (named pY) located upstream of traY-I. The isolated TraJ protein was found to bind to a dyad symmetry sequence, named sbj (specific binding site of TraJ), which existed in the intergenic region between traJ and traY-I. We also demonstrated that TraY repressed the TraJ-dependent expression of traY-I at the TraY binding sites, sbyB and sbyC, which overlapped with pY. CONCLUSIONS: TraJ is a protein which binds to the sbj site in the region upstream of the promoter pY and positively regulates expression of the traY-I operon in the presence of the E. coli arcA gene. Since sbj is located 93bp upstream of pY in the intergenic region between traJ and traY-I, TraJ presumably contacts with a transcription apparatus to promote transcription from pY. TraY, which is known to activate the initiation of conjugal DNA transfer, has a new role in the transcriptional autoregulation of traY-I expression. At levels which are sufficient to initiate conjugal DNA transfer, TraY represses traY-I transcription in the presence of TraJ.",M2

Using specific antibodies, TraD was localized to the inner membrane of F+ cells under conditions where it is produced in physiologically normal amounts.

Sequence analysis revealed significant homology with previously described aggregation proteins in Enterococcus and Streptococcus species. The possibility that cluA was an equivalent protein involved in cell aggregation between donor and recipient bacteria during lactococcal conjugation was confirmed by its expression under the control of a heterologous promoter in L. lactis. Analysis of the homology between the CluA protein and the related proteins of Enterococcus and Streptococcus allowed a common structure for these proteins to be postulated. This consisted of five domains. Functionally conserved domains I and V act respectively as a secretory leader and C-terminal membrane anchor. Domains II and IV are conserved at the amino acid level and probably have common structural roles whereas domain III is variable and may control binding specificity.",M2
7635820,"Characterization of the functional sites in the oriT region involved in DNA transfer promoted by <e>sex factor</e> plasmid R100.We have previously identified three sites, named sbi, ihfA, and sbyA, specifically recognized or bound by the TraI, IHF, and TraY proteins, respectively; these sites are involved in nicking at the origin of transfer, oriT, of plasmid R100. In the region next to these sites, there exists the sbm region, which consists of four sites, sbmA, sbmB, sbmC, and sbmD; this region is specifically bound by the TraM protein, which is required for DNA transfer. Between sbmB and sbmC in this region, there exists another IHF-binding site, ihfB. The region containing all of these sites is located in the proximity of the tra region and is referred to as the oriT region. To determine whether these sites are important for DNA transfer in vivo, we constructed plasmids with various mutations in the oriT region and tested their mobilization in the presence of R100-1, a transfer-proficient mutant of R100. Plasmids with either deletions in the sbi-ihfA-sbyA region or substitution mutations introduced into each specific site in this region were mobilized at a greatly reduced frequency, showing that all of these sites are essential for DNA transfer. By binding to ihfA, IHF, which is known to bend DNA, may be involved in the formation of a complex (which may be called oriT-some) consisting of TraI, IHF, and TraY that efficiently introduces a nick at oriT. Plasmids with either deletions in the sbm-ihfB region or substitution mutations introduced into each specific site in this region were mobilized at a reduced frequency, showing that this region is also important for DNA transfer. By binding to ihfB, IHF may also be involved in the formation of another complex (which may be called the TraM-IHF complex) consisting of TraM and IHF that ensures DNA transfer with a high level of efficiency. Several-base-pair insertions into the positions between sbyA and sbmA affected the frequency of transfer in a manner dependent upon the number of base pairs, indicating that the phasing between sbyA and sbmA is important. This in turn suggests that both oriT-some and the TraM-IHF complex should be in an appropriate position spatially to facilitate DNA transfer.",M2
1885542,"Arc and Sfr functions of the Escherichia coli K-12 arcA gene product are genetically and physiologically separable.The Escherichia coli arcA gene product regulates chromosomal gene expression in response to deprivation of oxygen (Arc function; Arc stands for aerobic respiration control) and is required for expression of the F plasmid DNA transfer (tra) genes (Sfr function; Sfr stands for <e>sex factor</e> regulation). Using appropriate lacZ fusions, we have examined the relationship between these two genetic regulatory functions. Arc function in vivo was measured by anaerobic repression of a chromosomal sdh-lacZ operon fusion (sdh stands for succinate dehydrogenase). Sfr function was measured by activation of a plasmid traY-lacZ gene fusion. An eight-codon insertion near the 5' terminus of arcA, designated arcA1, abolished Arc function, as previously reported by S. Iuchi and E.C.C. Lin (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85:1888-1892, 1988), but left Sfr function largely (greater than or equal to 60%) intact. Similarly, the arcB1 mutation, which depressed sdh expression and is thought to act by abolishing the signal input that elicits ArcA function, had little effect (less than or equal to 20%) on the Sfr function of the arcA+ gene product. Conversely, a valine-to-methionine mutation at codon 203 (the sfrA5 allele) essentially abolished Sfr activity without detectably altering Arc activity. These data indicate that Sfr and Arc functions are separately expressed and regulated properties of the same protein.",M2

The traK4 mutation is an extremely polar mutation in the F plasmid that affects F pilus synthesis and plasmid transfer. traK genes carrying the traK4 mutation and a nonpolar mutation traK105 were cloned, sequenced, and identified as an amber nonsense and a frameshift mutation, respectively. The traK4 mutation occurred within one predicted rho-dependent transcription termination element (TTE) and immediately upstream of another, while the traK105 mutation occurred after the two potential TTEs within the traK gene. S1 nuclease protection analysis and Northern (RNA) blot analysis were used to confirm that the traK4 mutation, but not the traK105 mutation, caused premature termination of transcription. Computer analysis of the F transfer region suggested the presence of TTE motifs at regular intervals throughout the 33.4-kb sequence.",M2

Analysis of 23 independently derived enlarged lactose plasmids revealed that the sex factor DNA present in cointegrates varied in size. This suggested that more than simple cointegration with a sex factor plasmid was involved. Further analysis led to the discovery of a chromosomally located sex factor that could excise and be lost or exist as labile plasmid DNA.

1355084,"Characterization, localization, and sequence of F transfer region products: the pilus assembly gene product TraW and a new product, TrbI.The traW gene of the Escherichia coli K-12 <e>sex factor</e>, F, encodes one of the numerous proteins required for conjugative transfer of this plasmid. We have found that the nucleotide sequence of traW encodes a 210-amino-acid, 23,610-Da polypeptide with a characteristic amino-terminal signal peptide sequence; in DNA from the F lac traW546 amber mutant, the traW open reading frame is interrupted at codon 141. Studies of traW expression in maxicells in the presence and absence of ethanol demonstrate that the traW product does undergo signal sequence processing. Cell fractionation experiments additionally demonstrated that mature TraW is a periplasmic protein. Electron microscopy also showed that F lac traW546 hosts do not express F pili, confirming that TraW is required for F-pilus assembly. Our nucleotide sequence also revealed the existence of an additional gene, trbI, located between traC and traW. The trbI gene encodes a 128-amino-acid polypeptide which could be identified as a 14-kDa protein product. Fractionation experiments demonstrated that TrbI is an intrinsic inner-membrane protein. Hosts carrying the pOX38-trbI::kan insertion mutant plasmids that we constructed remained quite transfer proficient but exhibited increased resistance to F-pilus-specific phages. Mutant plasmids pOX38-trbI472 and pOX38-trbI473 expressed very long F pili, suggestive of a pilus retraction deficiency. Expression of an excess of TrbI in hosts carrying a wild-type pOX38 plasmid also caused F-pilus-specific phage resistance. The possibility that TrbI influences the kinetics of pilus outgrowth and/or retraction is discussed.",M2
2680768,"Nucleotide sequence of the traD region in the Escherichia coli F <e>sex factor</e>.The complete nucleotide sequence has been determined of a 3635-bp region, extending from the HpaI site in traT, at F coordinate 90.3 kb, to beyond the end of traD, of the F sex factor plasmid of Escherichia coli K-12. This region contains the C-terminal coding part of traT and the entire traD gene. An open reading frame (ORF) of 2148 bp within the sequence confirms that traD encodes an 81.4-kDa cytoplasmic membrane protein. The TraD protein has several regions with an unusually high pI (greater than 10), suggesting that they may correspond to the DNA-binding domains. Several other ORFs were detected within the region including the gene (ORF1) for a 26.3-kDa protein and ORF2, probably corresponding to traI, which continues to the end of the sequence. An ORF for an 8.5-kDa protein preceded by an excellent promoter and ribosome-binding site is present in the region following traD but on the opposite strand. This promoter is thought to correspond to the major RNA polymerase binding site in this region, implying that traI does not have its own promoter. The lack of a typical terminator following traD and ORF1 and the translational coupling provided by overlapping stop and start codons is consistent with this conclusion.",M2
1316444,"Control of segregation of chromosomal DNA by <e>sex factor</e> F in Escherichia coli. Mutants of DNA gyrase subunit A suppress letD (ccdB) product growth inhibition.The letA (ccdA) and letD (ccdB) genes, located just outside the sequence essential for replication of the F plasmid, apparently contribute to stable maintenance of the plasmid. The letD gene product acts to inhibit partitioning of chromosomal DNA and cell division of the host bacteria, whereas the letA gene product acts to suppress the activity of the letD gene product. To identify the target of the letD gene product, temperature-sensitive growth-defective mutants were screened from bacterial mutants that had escaped the letD product growth inhibition that occurs in hosts carrying an FletA mutant. Of nine mutants analysed, three mutants were shown, by phage P1-mediated transduction and complementation analysis, to have mutations in the gyrA gene and the other six in the groE genes. The nucleotide sequence revealed that one of the gyrA mutants has a base change from G to A at position 641 (resulting in an amino acid change from Gly to Glu at position 214) of the gyrA gene. The mutant GyrA proteins produced by these gyrA(ts) mutants were trans-dominant over wild-type GyrA protein for letD tolerance. The wild-type GyrA protein, produced in excess amounts by means of a multicopy plasmid, overcame growth inhibition of the letD gene product. These observations strongly suggest that the A subunit of DNA gyrase is the target of the LetD protein.",M2

We have identified, by transposon mutagenesis, an E. coli cellular locus, hlyT, required for the synthesis and secretion of haemolysin encoded in trans by intact hly operons carrying the hly upstream regulatory region. Mutation of the hlyT locus specifically reduced the level of hlyA structural gene transcript 20-100-fold and thus markedly lowered both intracellular and extracellular levels of the HlyA protein. Genetic and structural analysis of the hlyT locus mapped it at co-ordinate 3680 kbp (minute 87) on the chromosome adjacent to the fadBA operon, and identified it specifically as the rfaH (sfrB) locus which is required for transcription of the genes encoding synthesis of the sex pilus and also the lipopolysaccharide core for attachment of the O-antigen of E. coli and Salmonella. Expression of the hly operon in the E. coli hlyT mutant was restored in trans by both the hlyT and rfaH genes, suggesting that the rfaH gene is an important activator of regulon structures that are central to the fertility and virulence of these pathogenic bacteria. DNA sequencing of the hlyT locus identifies the HlyT/RfaH transcriptional activator as a protein of 162 amino acids (Mr 18325) which shows no identity to characterized transcription factors.",M2
1318487,"PsiB, and anti-SOS protein, is transiently expressed by the F <e>sex factor</e> during its transmission to an Escherichia coli K-12 recipient.PsiB, an anti-SOS protein, shown previously to prevent activation of RecA protein, was purified from the crude extract of PsiB overproducing cells. PsiB is probably a tetrameric protein, whose subunit has a sequence-deduced molecular mass of 15741 daltons. Using an immuno-assay with anti-PsiB antibodies, we have monitored PsiB cell concentrations produced by F and R6-5 plasmids: the latter type produces a detectable level of PsiB protein while the former does not. The discrepancy can be assigned to a Tn10 out-going promoter located upstream of psiB. When we inserted a Tn10 promoter upstream of F psiB, the F PsiB protein concentration reached the level of R6-5 PsiB. We describe here the physiological role that PsiB protein may have in the cell and how it causes an anti-SOS function. We observed that PsiB protein was transiently expressed by a wild-type F sex factor during its transmission to an Escherichia coli K-12 recipient. In an F+ x F- cross, PsiB concentration increased at least 10-fold in F- recipient bacteria after 90 minutes and declined thereafter; the psiB gene may be repressed when F plasmid replicates vegetatively. PsiB protein may be induced zygotically so as to protect F single-stranded DNA transferred upon conjugation. PsiB protein, when overproduced, may interfere with RecA protein at chromosomal single-stranded DNA sites generated by discontinuous DNA replication, thus causing an SOS inhibitory phenotype.",M2
2901493,"Control of cell division by <e>sex factor</e> F in Escherichia coli. III. Participation of the groES (mopB) gene of the host bacteria.Cell division of F+ bacteria is coupled to DNA replication of the F plasmid. Two plasmid coded genes, letA (ccdA) and letD (ccdB) are indispensable for this coupling. To investigate bacterial genes that participate in this coupling, we attempted to identify the target of the division inhibitor (the letD gene product) of the F plasmid. Two temperature-sensitive growth defective mutants were screened from bacterial mutants that escaped the letD product growth inhibition that occurs in hosts carrying an FletA mutant. Phage P1-mediated transduction and complementation analysis indicated that the temperature-sensitive mutations are located in the groES (mopB) gene, which is essential for the morphogenesis of several bacteriophages and also for growth of the bacteria. The nucleotide sequence of the promoter region of the gene in which the temperature-sensitive mutations had occurred was virtually identical with that of the groES gene of Escherichia coli; furthermore the sequence of the first five amino acid residues and the overall amino acid composition predicted from the nucleotide sequence of the gene match those of the purified GroES protein. The temperature-sensitive mutants did not allow the propagation of phage lambda at 28 degrees C and formed long filamentous structures without septa at 41 degrees C, as is observed in the case of groES mutants. Growth of the two groES mutants tested was not inhibited by the F plasmid with the letA mutation. These observations suggest to us that the morphogenesis gene groES plays a key role in coupling between replication of the F plasmid and cell division of the host cells.",M2

Characterization of the protein and of its DNA-binding properties.Gene traI of the Escherichia coli F <e>sex factor</e> which encodes DNA helicase I was subcloned in a lambda pL-based plasmid vector and expressed in a background of pL non-repressing cells. Neither the non-repressed pL promoter nor the production of a high level of functional helicase I are toxic. Enzyme purified from this source was studied in the electron microscope. The results show that helicase I binds cooperatively to single-stranded DNA. DNA covered with the helicase appears in fixed, negatively stained specimens as a smooth-contoured filament with a diameter of 12.5 +/- 0.4 nm and an axial periodicity of 7.0 +/- 0.2 nm. In unfixed specimens, discrete particles with axes of 12.7 +/- 0.5 nm and 7.2 +/- 0.5 nm are visible. They are consistent in size with helicase I monomers (Mr 180,000) suggesting that the molecule is almost isometric, despite a frictional ratio of 1.71 calculated from its diffusion coefficient. Helicase I free of DNA appears as aggregates. For comparison, a truncated traI, lacking coding for the amino-terminus of the product, was cloned by fusing it to an MS2 replicase gene fragment. The chimeric gene product (named helicase I del29) retains strand-separating activity although it fails to show cooperative DNA binding behavior. Judged from the length of the helicase-I-specific sequence of this polypeptide, traI is located 1.3 kb nearer to the distal end of the F transfer operon compared to the position proposed in a previous genetic map. The revised location of traI has implications for understanding distal functions of the transfer operon.",M2

Recombination did not occur between derivatives of ER720 lacking SEP1, but it did occur if SEP1 was transferred to one of these strains or if these strains were crossed with other strains containing SEP1.

2651399,"Control of the ccd operon in plasmid F.The F <e>sex factor</e> plasmid of Escherichia coli contains a pair of genes, ccdA and ccdB, whose protein gene products are involved in an unusual feature of plasmid maintenance. The CcdB protein is a cytotoxin that becomes activated when the F plasmid is lost, thereby killing the F- segregant cells. In F+ cells, the CcdA protein protects against the lethal effects of CcdB. In the present study we show that ccdA and ccdB expressions are negatively autoregulated at the level of transcription. Genetic studies showed that repression required at least ccdB; ccdA alone was without effect, and ccdB alone was not examined because it is lethal. Ccd-operator complexes were purified and contained a mixture of both CcdA and CcdB proteins; however, we could not conclude from our results whether CcdA was necessary for DNA binding or autorepression. By using restriction fragments of the promoter-operator region, we obtained results indicating that at least two DNA-binding sites existed for the Ccd protein(s). Subsequent footprinting of the binding sites showed protection over about a 113-base-pair region encompassing the putative promoter-operator and the beginning of the ccdA gene.",M2

2851049,"Evidence that DNA helicase I and oriT site-specific nicking are both functions of the F TraI protein.Site-specific and strand-specific nicking at the origin of transfer (oriT) of the F <e>sex factor</e> is the initial step in conjugal DNA metabolism. Then, DNA helicase I, the product of the traI gene, processively unwinds the plasmid from the nick site to generate the single strand of DNA that is transferred to the recipient. The nick at oriT is produced by the combined action of two Tra proteins, TraY and TraZ. The traZ gene was never precisely mapped, as no available point mutation uniquely affected TraZ-dependent oriT nicking. With several new mutations, we have demonstrated that TraZ activity is dependent upon traI DNA sequences. The simplest interpretation of this finding is that the F TraI protein is bifunctional, with DNA unwinding and site-specific DNA nicking activities.",M2
3036780,"Revised genetic map of the distal end of the F transfer operon: implications for DNA helicase I, nicking at oriT, and conjugal DNA transport.The DNA transfer stage of conjugation requires the products of the F <e>sex factor</e> genes traMYDIZ and the cis-acting site oriT. Previous interpretation of genetic and protein analyses suggested that traD, traI, and traZ mapped as contiguous genes at the distal end of the transfer operon and saturated this portion of the F transfer region (which ends with an IS3 element). Using antibodies prepared against the purified TraD and TraI proteins, we analyzed the products encoded by a collection of chimeric plasmids constructed with various segments of traDIZ DNA. We found the traI gene to be located 1 kilobase to the right of the position suggested on previous maps. This creates an unsaturated space between traD and traI where unidentified tra genes may be located and leaves insufficient space between traI and IS3 for coding the 94-kilodalton protein previously thought to be the product of traZ. We found that the 94-kilodalton protein arose from a translational restart and corresponds to the carboxy terminus of traI; we named it TraI*. The precise physical location of the traZ gene and the identity of its product are unknown. The oriT nicking activity known as TraZ may stem from unassigned regions between traD and traI and between traI and IS3, but a more interesting possibility is that it is actually a function of traI. On our revised map, the position of a previously detected RNA polymerase-binding site corresponds to a site at the amino terminus of traI rather than a location 1 kilobase into the coding region of the gene. Furthermore, the physical and genetic comparison of the F traD and traI genes with those of the closely related F-like conjugative plasmids R1 and R100 is greatly simplified. The translational organization we found for traI, together with its identity as the structural gene for DNA helicase I, suggests a possible functional link to several other genes from which translational restart polypeptides are expressed. These include the primases of the conjugative plasmids ColI and R16, the primase-helicase of bacteriophage T7, and the cisA product (nickase) of phage phi X174.",M2

6363616,"Dye sensitivity correlated with envelope protein changes in dye (sfrA) mutants of Escherichia coli K12 defective in the expression of the <e>sex factor</e> F.Mutations of the dye gene on the E. coli chromosome result in sensitivity to the dye toluidine blue and, in male cells, cause loss of F pili, producing sterility in conjugation. Compared with its dye+ parent, a strain deleted for dye (delta dye) showed an altered sensitivity to a wide range of dyes and antibiotics which affect different intracellular processes, and hence it appeared likely that the barrier properties of the cell envelope were impaired. Unlike mutants known to be defective in LPS structure, there appeared to be no correlation between the hydrophobicity of the compounds and the sensitivity of the delta dye strain. Moreover there was no difference between dye+ and delta dye strains in their sensitivity to LPS-specific phages, and chemical and GLC analysis of LPS components revealed no difference between the two strains. Examination of outer and inner membrane proteins from isogenic strains having the delta dye deletion and the dye+ gene cloned into the plasmid pACYC184, with or without insertional inactivation of dye by the transposon gamma delta, was performed by SDS-PAGE. This revealed a number of differences in the profile of proteins from both inner and outer membranes, correlated with mutation in the dye gene.

2859268,"DNA transfer occurs during a cell surface contact stage of F <e>sex factor</e>-mediated bacterial conjugation.Donor bacteria containing JCFL39, a temperature-sensitive traD mutant of the F sex factor, were used at the nonpermissive temperature to accumulate stable mating pairs with recipient cells. At this stage in conjugation, extracellular F pili were removed by treatment with 0.01% sodium dodecyl sulfate. Upon then shifting to the permissive temperature for JCFL39, transfer of the F plasmid was observed. The mating pairs that were accumulated with JCFL39 at the nonpermissive temperature were readily observed by electron microscopy in wall-to-wall contact with the recipient bacteria. These results demonstrate that the traD product, which is known to be required in transferring DNA to a recipient bacterium, acts after the stage at which extracellular F pili are required. In addition, we concluded that DNA transfer takes place while donor and recipient cells are in surface contact and not necessarily through an extended F pilus as envisioned in some models of bacterial conjugation.",M2
6325433,"The product of the F <e>sex factor</e> traT surface exclusion gene is a lipoprotein.The product of the Escherichia coli sex factor F traT gene (TraTp), an outer membrane protein of Mr = 25,000, is covalently modified in vivo by the addition of glycerol and fatty acids. Consistent with this result, and as would be expected for a bacterial lipoprotein, the novel amino acid glycerylcysteine can be detected in purified TraTp. Being a secreted protein, TraTp is made from a signal sequence containing precursor, and glycerol and fatty acids can be detected in both the precursor and mature (processed) species of TraTp. The peptide antibiotic globomycin inhibits the cleavage of the pro-TraTp signal sequence, but not the glycerol and fatty acid modification. Diglyceride modification of the Cys residue at the site of signal sequence cleavage probably precedes and is a prerequisite for processing of the TraTp signal sequence. Thus, TraTp appears to be a typical E. coli lipoprotein, having a pathway for modification and processing that is similar to that of Braun's lipoprotein (the major outer membrane lipoprotein).",M2
6373720,"Purification and characterization of pro-TraTp, the signal sequence-containing precursor of a secreted protein encoded by the F <e>sex factor</e>.The structural gene for the F sex factor outer membrane surface exclusion protein ( traT ) was cloned onto a high-copy-number plasmid where it is expressed from the phage lambda promoter pL. Conditional control over expression was provided by a temperature-sensitive lambda cI repressor. Induction of pL produced large quantities of the traT gene product ( TraTp ) and, in rich growth media, even larger amounts of a higher-molecular-weight form of TraTp . This polypeptide was purified and characterized as a pro- TraTp precursor, which contains at its amino terminus a typical signal-like sequence, which is not present in the mature form of TraTp as isolated from the outer membrane of F-containing cells. Accumulation of pro- TraTp seemed not to result from the jamming of export sites, as in another system for obtaining precursors of secreted proteins, but rather from overwhelming kinetically the ability of the cell to process exported proteins. Although pro- TraTp appeared to be successfully translocated to the outer membrane, it was defective in forming the oligomeric structure required for surface exclusion function. The procedure used is not a general method but can be applied to certain other secreted proteins.",M2
3323526,"Surface exclusion genes traS and traT of the F <e>sex factor</e> of Escherichia coli K-12. Determination of the nucleotide sequence and promoter and terminator activities.The DNA encoding the surface exclusion genes traS and traT of the F sex factor of Escherichia coli K-12 has been sequenced and the biological activity of the various terminators and promoters determined. The data show that traS encodes a 16,861 Mr protein with no apparent signal sequence, as expected for its cytoplasmic membrane location. The protein is extremely hydrophobic. traS has its own promoter and a weak terminator region follows the gene. After the traS termination loop there is a small intergenic region before the traT promoter. The traT gene encodes a 25,932 Mr precursor for the 23,709 Mr mature protein. The amino-terminal signal peptide is 21 amino acid residues, consistent with it being an outer membrane lipoprotein. A very strong termination loop follows the gene and adjacent to this a further loop can be predicted from the sequence. These secondary structures would be expected to enhance the stability of the mRNA in the presence of 3' specific ribonucleases accounting for the apparent long half-life of the messenger. The amino acid sequence of the mature product of traT of F differs from that of R100 by only a single amino acid substitution (Gly for Ala at position 119), whereas that of pED208 (Folac) differs at 40 positions. traT lies in a region of heteroduplex homology between F and R100, and the nucleotide sequence confirms this and demonstrates that this homology breaks down immediately preceding and following the coding region. Sequence analysis shows that this is also so for pED208. Thus the entire traS of F, R100 and pED208 are very different at the DNA level. An open reading frame, preceded by a typical promoter sequence and a weak and poorly located Shine-Dalgarno sequence, follows traT and corresponds to the start of traD. Alone, this promoter appears to be inactive.",M2
6233425,"Control of cell division by <e>sex factor</e> F in Escherichia coli. II. Identification of genes for inhibitor protein and trigger protein on the 42.84-43.6 F segment.The genetic structure of the 42.84-43.6 F (BamHI-PstI) segment of the F plasmid, which contains all the F DNA sequences necessary for coupling cell division of F+ bacteria with plasmid DNA replication, was analyzed by isolating a series of amber mutants. Two cistrons were found in this region and they were designated letA and letD (an abbreviation for lethal mutation). The letA and letD cistrons were mapped on the 42.84-43.35 F (BamHI- XmaI ) segment and the 43.07-43.6 F (HincII-PstI) segment, respectively, and are presumed to correspond to the first (43.04-43.26 F) and second (43.26-43.57 F) open reading frames, respectively, which were found in this region by nucleotide sequencing. The letD gene product acts to inhibit cell division of the host bacteria and to induce prophages in lysogenic bacteria, whereas the letA gene product acts to suppress the activity of the letD gene product. Taking into consideration the fact that the 42.84-43.6 F segment carries all the F plasmid genes necessary for coupling cell division with plasmid DNA replication, and that the expression of the genes is likely to be controlled by plasmid DNA replication, we constructed the following hypothesis. Before completion of plasmid DNA replication, LetD protein acts to prevent cell division of the host bacteria. When plasmid DNA replication is completed, synthesis of LetA protein (and also LetD protein) takes place and the LetA protein synthesized acts to suppress the activity of LetD protein and make the cell ready for cell division. Actual cell division will take place when replication of both chromosomal and plasmid DNA is completed and the termination protein of the chromosome and the LetA protein of F plasmid are both synthesized. When cell division takes place LetA protein is consumed, and as a result LetD protein becomes active and prevents cell division until the next round of DNA replication is completed.",M2
6328216,"Identification of the dye gene product, mutational loss of which alters envelope protein composition and also affects <e>sex factor</e> F expression in Escherichia coli K-12.The product of the dye gene of Escherichia coli, mapping at 99-100 min, is required for expression of the sex factor F, and also appears to be involved in the regulation of envelope proteins. Mutation of dye thus results in loss of expression of the F-factor ( Fex -), i.e. male sterility, and dye sensitivity (Dyes). We have isolated a plasmid, pRB38 , in which a 6 kb SalI fragment carrying the dye+ gene was cloned into the plasmid pACYC184. This 6 kb SalI fragment also carries two nearby markers, chlG , involved in the synthesis of the molybdenum cofactor, and phoM, required for constitutive expression of alkaline phosphatase. Some of the polypeptides synthesised by pRB38 were identified using the maxi-cell procedure. The product of the dye gene was found to be a polypeptide of Mr = 29,000. Thus derivatives of pRB38 in which the transposon gamma delta was inserted into dye, resulting in a Dyes Fex - phenotype when these plasmids were in a delta dye strain, failed to a produce this polypeptide and in some cases produced a truncated product. Such insertions also resulted in a Chlr and Pho- phenotype when the plasmid was in a delta (dye- chlG -phoM) phoR strain, although complementation tests suggested that the phoM+ and chlG + genes were still intact. Insertions of gamma delta into the promoter distal end of dye did not result in a Dyes Fex - phenotype, although a truncated Dye protein was synthesised, and a Chlr Pho- phenotype was produced. It has been suggested ( Gaffney et al. 1983) that the dye (= sfrA ) gene product is necessary for F-factor expression because it is required for translocation of the F-factor TraJ protein to the outer membrane.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2
6238226,"Overproduction, purification and characterization of the F traT protein.A lambda transducing phage (ED lambda 110) which carries the <e>sex factor</e> F surface exclusion genes, traS and traT, was characterized by both genetic and physiochemical techniques. The transducing segment consists of 5.2 kilobases of F tra DNA, and carries the carboxy-terminal one-half of the upstream traG gene, as well as traS, traT, and the adjacent downstream gene traD. These tra proteins could be identified in infected UV-irradiated cells, and the major part of their synthesis was found to occur from the phage's late promoter pR' under Q control. Lysogens for ED lambda 110 were induced and found to greatly overproduce the traT gene product (TraTp), an outer membrane protein normally found in about 20,000 copies per cell, to levels which exceeded the major outer membrane proteins. This led to the development of a simple purification procedure for TraTp, the most important step of which was the construction of an appropriate ompB derivative to eliminate the major outer membrane porin proteins, which have several physical properties in common with TraTp. Purified TraTp was added to mixtures of donor and recipient cells and found to inhibit mating. The specificity of this assay was demonstrated by using an R100-1 donor, which responds to a heterologous surface exclusion system, and by using an altered TraTp containing a missense amino acid substitution. A mechanism by which TraTp mediates surface exclusion is proposed.",M2

A series of deletion plasmids of pRS31, extending increasing distances from a site in f17 through f19 and ending in f2, were isolated. These plasmids were examined by heteroduplex analysis with the parent DNA, and a restriction map of this region of DNA was constructed. A series of Tn5 insertion derivatives of pRS31 were also isolated and mapped, using both heteroduplex analysis and restriction mapping. Both the insertion and deletion mutants were tested in minicells for the synthesis of radioactively labeled proteins.

6308624,"F <e>sex factor</e> of Escherichia coli K-12 codes for a single-stranded DNA binding protein.In Escherichia coli K-12 strains that carry the mutation ssb-1 in the gene for single-stranded DNA binding protein, the presence of the F sex factor partially reverses the temperature-sensitive growth phenotype caused by the mutation. The region of F (EcoRI fragment 3) responsible for this compensation has been identified and subcloned onto pBR322. A BamHI cleavage site has been found to intersect the essential coding region for this F function. By using this site, mutational blocks in the function have been constructed and used to identify a protein product (Mr approximately 22,000, slightly larger than the E. coli K-12 single-stranded DNA binding protein) which is correlated with the ssb-1-complementing activity. Labeled extracts from maxicells were used to show that this protein binds tightly to single-stranded DNA.

6327993,"Control of cell division by <e>sex factor</e> F in Escherichia coli. I. The 42.84-43.6 F segment couples cell division of the host bacteria with replication of plasmid DNA.The F plasmid of Escherichia coli was used to study the genetic background of the control circuit in the bacteria that co-ordinates DNA replication and cell division of the host cells. When DNA replication of the F plasmid was blocked by growing cells carrying an amber-suppressible replication-defective F plasmid mutant under restrictive conditions, the cells continued to divide for about one generation until F plasmid was supposedly diluted to one copy per cell, and then they stopped dividing and formed non-septated filamentous cells. These observations suggest that completion of a round of replication is a necessary and sufficient condition of F DNA synthesis in the cell division of F+ bacteria; i.e. cell division of the F+ bacteria is coupled with DNA replication of the F plasmid. The observation that Giemsa-stainable materials in the filamentous cells were clustered in the center indicates that partitioning of chromosomal DNA (and presumably of F plasmid DNA) is also coupled with plasmid DNA replication. The function necessary for this coupling is carried by the 42.84-43.6 F (BamHI-PstI) segment, which is located outside the region essential for replication of the F plasmid. The nucleotide sequence demonstrates the existence of two open reading frames in this region, which encode polypeptides of 72 and 101 amino acids, respectively. These two reading frames are most likely to be transcribed as a single polycistronic message in the direction from the BamHI site at 42.84 F to the PstI site at 43.6 F.

We have isolated two kinds of mutations that affect this activity. The ferA mutations eliminate the stimulation; the ferB mutations enhance it in the presence of FerA+. We conclude that ferA defines a sex factor gene that stimulates precise excision. The ferB mutations also specifically increase the rate of recombination between two IS3 elements on F' lac-pro (F'128) in a reaction that requires the product of recA. The stimulation of this recombination by ferB also requires an active ferA gene, which implies that the ferA gene stimulates this reaction as well as precise excision. A ferA mutation was mapped at 84.2 kilobases on the F factor, and a ferB mutation was mapped at 82.5 kilobases. The fer mutants were obtained by an approach that permits the isolation of mutants affecting precise excision.",M2

Under these conditions RecA protein synthesis was induced and lambda repressor cleaved, as observed upon direct induction, that is, when the recipient lambda lysogen was directly exposed to UV-light. The efficiency of induction of RecA protein synthesis in recipient bacteria which had received an irradiated F-lac factor was about 80% of that measured upon direct induction. We observed the simultaneous disappearance of lambda repressor and a slight production of cleavage fragments; quantitation by densitometric scanning of the autoradiogram after correction for the efficiency of transfer indicated that 55% of lambda repressor was cleaved. Transfer of UV-damaged Hfr DNA failed to induce RecA protein synthesis. A lambda phage vector carrying oriF, the cloned origin of F plasmid replication, after exposure to UV-light and infection of a recipient lysogen, induced RecA protein synthesis and a moderate but significant cleavage of lambda repressor. Indirect induction by UV-damaged F sex factor or phage lambda oriF resulted in biochemical cellular reactions similar to those observed upon direct induction.

The transposon Tn5 (which confers kanamycin resistance) was inserted at different positions into pSM6, and the transposition derivatives were tested for ability to complement defined tra mutants of the F sex factor. Thus, the tra genes traH, G, T, and D were localized on the plasmid R100. A restriction map of pSM6 was constructed, and the locations of the insertions were mapped, using restriction endonuclease digestion of the plasmid DNA and exploiting the fact that several restriction sites are localized in the inverted repeat regions of the transposon. The gene products of the genes traG, S, T, and D were identified by radioactive labeling of proteins synthesized in minicells carrying the various insertion plasmids followed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The presence of another transfer gene, traI, was inferred from these data. Another protein, the r2-A protein, was also identified, and its gene was mapped. On the basis of the data, a best-fit physical map of this region of the tra operon of R100 was constructed. The results confirmed that the general order and size of the distal transfer genes is as in the F sex factor, but showed that differences exist with respect to all of the gene products.

A 6-kilobase SalI fragment of E. coli chromosomal DNA cloned into the plasmid pBR322 has been shown to complement both the Dye- and Fex- phenotypes. Insertion of the transposon gamma delta (Tn1000) into a specific part of this plasmid invariably results in both the Dye- and Fex- phenotypes, indicating that these phenotypes derive from mutation in a single gene.

The genetic evidence presented here is consistent with the hypothesis that pAV2 specifies a host restriction and modification system that is active against pAV1. Physical evidence from agarose gel electrophoresis indicates that pAV1 corresponds to a band of approximately 85 Md in strain JC17.

The method involves transformation of E. coli cells with linear plasmid DNAs generated by restriction enzyme cleavage. We have used this technique to map DNA transfer genes in the tra control region of F sex factor DNA. Deletions within EcoRI fragment f6 of F DNA have been isolated and used to assign physical locations to tra genes by a combination of genetic complementation tests, restriction enzyme analysis, DNA heteroduplexing and the analysis of the proteins synthesised in minicells and in vitro.

The chromosomal mobilization properties of the derived plasmid, designated pR0271, resembled those of the progenitor plasmid FP2.

The acquisition of Tn1 by FP2 results in its ability to mobilize pRO161 to other bacteria. Genetic evidence presented here suggests two sequential mechanisms. Initially, transposition of Tn1 results in trans-diploidy for the Tra+ and Tra- plasmids. This subsequently allows mobilization of the Tra- R-plasmid dependent on a host recombination mechanism. Transconjugants from this mating contain either stable cointegrate R-plasmids or aggregates resulting from dissociation of the cointegrates into a Tra+ and Tra- plasmid. These aggregates have lost at least part of Tn1 from their parent FP2:Tn1 component, but now they mobilize the tra- R-plasmid from a recombination-deficient (Rec-) genetic background as well as from Rec+ donor strains. Transconjugants from these retransfer matings are aggregates. These results suggest a contribution of transposons to R-plasmid evolution and dissemination beyond the mere acquisition of resistance to a given antibiotic.",M2

U.S.A. 73:64-68, 1976), have been used to refine the map positions of tra cistrons on the F factor as well as to define a new DNA transfer cistron, traM. The current map of the tra cistrons is presented. None of the known tra cistrons, with the exception of traG, straddles an EcoRI site. The EcoRI site at 82 kilobases splits the traG cistron into two portions, an operator-proximal portion necessary for F pilus synthesis and an operator distal portion involved in conjugation itself. The operon structure of the tra cistrons was reevaluated, and we found that traI is at least partially independent of transcription of the traA to traD operon.",M2
1104580,"Genetic and physical characteristics of an enterotoxin plasmid.We are engaged in the genetic and physical characterization of an enterotoxin (Ent) plasmid, Ent P307, which contains genes for the production of a hear-labile and a heat-stable enterotoxin. We are using an Escherichia coli K-12 strain, 711 (P307), constructed by S. Falkow, which contains no other plasmids besides Ent P307. Our genetic studies have shown that the plasmid is incompatible with the <e>sex factor</e> F, both in the integrated (Hfr) and the autonomous (F-prime) state. Ent P307 can thus be assigned to incompatibility group FI. An R factor, R386, which belongs to the same incompatibility group, was also found to be incompatibile with Ent P307, whereas five other R factors belonging to different incompatibility groups were compatible with Ent P307. In the presence of Ent P307, conjugal transfer and sensitivity to a male-specific phage of a derepressed F-like R factor, R1drd19, were repressed. Ent P307 is, thus, finO+. Presumably, it also causes repression of its own transfer genes since conjugal transfer of Ent P307 could not be demonstrated. Unlike F, it does not restrict the growth of female-specific phage phiII. From physical studies on extracted deoxyribonucleic acid, the molecular weight of Ent P307 was determined to be 54 X 10(6). By electron microscope heteroduplex analysis, the plasmid was found to be homologous with F in four regions, encompassing about half of its length. One long region and two short ones contain genes for conjugal transfer; the other short region carries genes for replication and incompatibility.",M2

We have mapped one HindIII and two BamHI restriction sites in the f5 region of these plasmids and one HindIII site in the antibiotic resistance region of each plasmid. The HindIII site in the Km region of pML31 occurs in the kan gene whereas the HindIII site in the Ap region of pSC138 appears to occur in an area important for the regulation of beta-lactamase production. By means of in vitro recombinant DNA manipulation of plasmids pML31 and pSC138, we have shown that approximately 1.9 X 10(6) daltons of the 6.0 X 10(6) dalton f5 fragment can be deleted without disrupting plasmid stability. In addition, we have used these same techniques to isolate a novel F-controlled Ap plasmid cloning vehicle which contains a single restriction site for each of the enzymes EcoRI, HindIII, and BamHI.

Ribonucleic acid specific for the galactose operon was isolated after induction of lysogenic strains presumed to carry the galactose operon in the normal and inverted orientation.

An F-prime nif plasmid, FN39, carrying genes which correspond to the E. coli chromosomal region, metG gnd his shiA, but excluding purF and aroD, was isolated from UNF43. Translocation of carbenicillin resistance genes from a P-type R-factor, R68, to FN39 increased the stability of his and nif on the derivative F-prime, FN68. Sedimentation analysis of both F-primes in sucrose gradients revealed our covalently closed circular(CCC) DNA species of molecular weights 279 +/- 9, 136 +/- 3, 90 +/- 1 and 44 +/- 1 megadaltons. It is suggested that the two smallest CCC-DNA species are component replicons of the composite F-primes of molecular weight 136 +/- 3 megadaltons, and that the molecules of 279 +/- 9 megadaltons are CCC-dimers.

1107327,"Isolation and characterization of Escherichia coli chromosomal mutants affecting plasmid copy number.We have isolated chromosomal mutants of an Escherchia coli K-12 strain that maintain higher levels of an F' plasmid. The mutants are designated as plasmid copy number (pcn) mutants. They were detected by selecting for increased lactose fermentation in bacteria deleted for the lac operon but harboring an F'lacI,P pro+ plasmid. When examined for the amount of F' plasmid deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) by the dye-CsCl isopycnic technique, the mutants show two to seven times as much covalently closed, circular (CCC) DNA as does the parental strain. The increased plasmid level in one mutant strain (pcn-24) was confirmed by DNA-DNA hybridization; however, this latter technique indicated about a twofold lower increase when compared with the increase measured for pcn-24 by the dye-CsCl technique. In mutant pcn-24 the increased amount of F' DNA reflects a proportional increase in monomeric-size plasmid molecules because oligomeric forms are not found. Also, in mutant pcn-24 the extra CCC plasmid copies do not seem to be randomly distributed throughout the cell's cytoplasm but appear complexed in situ with their host's folded chromosome. In all pcn mutants examined to date, the classical <e>sex factor</e> F is maintained at normal levels, whereas the viral plasmid Pl CM is maintained at two to three times the normal level. In all 17 pcn mutants isolated, the pcn mutation maps on the chromosome and not on the plasmid.

Three types of recombinant plasmids were identified after the mating of HfrH (R162/3) with recA and rec+ recipients. One specimen of each type (pIP218, pIP222, pIP226) was studied in this report. All three recombinant plasmids carry the same genetic information for resistance to antibiotics (CSSuT) retained from R162/3. pIP218 retained all the other properties from F of HfrH: derepression for pilus synthesis, mobilization of the chromosome for the proximally transferred HfrH genes (thr, leu, proA), interference with T7 propagation, and ability to be cured by acridine orange. pIP222 retained from F of HfrH the derepression for pilus synthesis and the same polarity of chromosome transfer (thr, leu, proA), while pIP226 retained the interference with T7 propagation and acridine orange curing. Physical studies revealed that replication control and/or recovery of F and pIP218 as covalent circles of deoxyribonucleic acid are similar, and are different from R162/3.

With two exceptions, these mutant plasmids have lost all of the tra genes, which are required to confer conjugational donor ability upon a host. In addition, all but the exceptional mutant plasmids were found to be very poorly transmissible from transient heterozygotes which also contain a wild-type F' plasmid. The poor transmissibility is a cis-dominant transfer-defective phenotype which may result from deletion of all or part of the origin of transfer replication (ori), or of a gene determining a cis-acting protein. The two exceptional mutant plasmids may carry short deletions of some of the tra genes or polar tra mutations. The remaining progeny were nonmutant F' strains and F- strains.

In addition to the defect in T7 late protein production in F+ cells reported by others, significantly less T7 late mRNA was synthesized, about one-half of that produced in T7-infected F- cells. Moreover, host RNA synthesis was not completely inhibited. The protein-synthesizing ability of T7-infected F+ cells decayed much faster than that of F- cells both in vivo and in vitro. This faster decay appears to explain the failure of F+ cells to produce T7 late protein in vivo, even in the presence of a considerable amount of translatable T7 late mRNA. Therefore, it may not be necessary to postulate the involvement of specific translational discrimination against T7 late mRNA, although it appears that F-factor-mediated restriction of T7 involves changes in transcription as well as translation.",M2
