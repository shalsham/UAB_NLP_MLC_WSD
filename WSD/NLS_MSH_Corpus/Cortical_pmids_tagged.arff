20448442,"[Examination of operative method for renal <e>cortical</e> tumors less than or equal to 4 cm and risk of chronic kidney disease]We retrospectively studied 63 patients undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy for solitary, renal cortical tumor (&lt; or =4 cm) between 1997 and 2008. Analysis was undertaken, with chronic kidney disease defined as glomerular filtration rate (GFR) lower than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2). Multivariable analysis showed that radical nephrectomy remained an independent risk factor for patients developing new onset of GFR lower than 60 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) (hazard ratio 3.158 [95% CI 1.335-7.473]). Radical nephrectomy is a significant risk factor for the development of chronic kidney disease.",M1
20432437,"Adaptation to alkalosis induces cell cycle delay and apoptosis in <e>cortical</e> collecting duct cells: role of Aquaporin-2.Collecting ducts (CD) not only constitute the final site for regulating urine concentration by increasing apical membrane Aquaporin-2 (AQP2) expression, but are also essential for the control of acid-base status. The aim of this work was to examine, in renal cells, the effects of chronic alkalosis on cell growth/death as well as to define whether AQP2 expression plays any role during this adaptation. Two CD cell lines were used: WT- (not expressing AQPs) and AQP2-RCCD(1) (expressing apical AQP2). Our results showed that AQP2 expression per se accelerates cell proliferation by an increase in cell cycle progression. Chronic alkalosis induced, in both cells lines, a time-dependent reduction in cell growth. Even more, cell cycle movement, assessed by 5-bromodeoxyuridine pulse-chase and propidium iodide analyses, revealed a G2/M phase cell accumulation associated with longer S- and G2/M-transit times. This G2/M arrest is paralleled with changes consistent with apoptosis. All these effects appeared 24 h before and were always more pronounced in cells expressing AQP2. Moreover, in AQP2-expressing cells, part of the observed alkalosis cell growth decrease is explained by AQP2 protein down-regulation. We conclude that in CD cells alkalosis causes a reduction in cell growth by cell cycle delay that triggers apoptosis as an adaptive reaction to this environment stress. Since cell volume changes are prerequisite for the initiation of cell proliferation or apoptosis, we propose that AQP2 expression facilitates cell swelling or shrinkage leading to the activation of channels necessary to the control of these processes.",M1
20404220,"Upregulation of renal sodium transporters in D5 dopamine receptor-deficient mice.D(5) dopamine receptor (D(5)R)-deficient (D(5)(-/-)) mice have hypertension that is aggravated by an increase in sodium intake. The present experiments were designed to test the hypothesis that a dysregulation of renal sodium transporters is related to the salt sensitivity in D(5)(-/-) mice. D(5)R was expressed in the renal proximal tubule, thick ascending limb, distal convoluted tubule, and <e>cortical</e> and outer medullary collecting ducts in D(5)(+/+) mice. On a control Na(+) diet, renal protein expressions of NKCC2 (sodium-potassium-2 chloride cotransporter), sodium chloride cotransporter, and alpha and gamma subunits of the epithelial sodium channel were greater in D(5)(-/-) than in D(5)(+/+) mice. Renal renin abundance and urine aldosterone levels were similar but renal angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT(1)R) protein expression was increased in D(5)(-/-) mice. An elevated Na(+) diet increased further the elevated blood pressure of D(5)(-/-) mice but did not affect the normal blood pressure of D(5)(+/+) mice. The increased levels of NKCC2, sodium chloride cotransporter, and alpha and gamma subunits of the epithelial sodium channel persisted with the elevated Na(+) diet and unaffected by chronic AT(1)R blockade (losartan) in D(5)(-/-) mice. The expressions of proximal sodium transporters NHE3 (sodium hydrogen exchanger type 3) and NaPi2 (sodium phosphate cotransporter type 2) were increased by the elevated Na(+) diet in D(5)(-/-) mice; the increased expression of NHE3 but not NaPi2 was abolished by AT(1)R blockade. Our findings suggest that the increased protein expression of sodium transporters/channels in distal nephron segments may be the direct consequence of the disruption of D(5)R, independent of the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system.",M1
20404214,"Role of renal perfusion pressure versus angiotensin II on renal oxidative stress in angiotensin II-induced hypertensive rats.Renal oxidative stress is thought to contribute to both the etiology and the associated renal injury in angiotensin (Ang) II-dependent hypertension. The contribution of Ang II versus elevated renal perfusion pressure (RPP) on albuminuria and renal oxidative stress in this model of hypertension was explored in the present study by chronically servocontrolling RPP to the left kidney and comparing responses with the right uncontrolled kidney and the left kidney of sham rats. Hypertension was produced in Sprague-Dawley rats fed a 4% NaCl diet by chronic IV infusion of Ang II (25 ng/kg per minute). The RPP to the left kidney was servocontrolled to mean daily pressures averaging approximately 120 mm Hg, whereas the uncontrolled kidneys averaged approximately 170 mm Hg over 14 days of Ang II infusion. Ang II infusion resulted in a 2.4-fold increase in albuminuria, which was RPP dependent. Kidneys exposed to both elevated RPP and Ang II (uncontrolled kidneys) displayed a 3.5-fold increase in malondialdehyde excretion and a 37% and 27% increase in renal <e>cortical</e> and outer medullary superoxide production, respectively. Elevated RPP significantly contributed to global renal oxidative stress (70% increase in malondialdehyde excretion) and outer medullary superoxide production. Elevated circulating levels of Ang II, per se, were responsible for a 1.5-fold and 2.0-fold increase in renal cortical and outer medullary NADPH oxidase activity, respectively. In summary, this study demonstrates that elevated RPP is directly responsible for the excess albuminuria in Ang II-infused rats, whereas both elevated RPP and Ang II directly contribute to the observed renal oxidative stress.",M1
20357031,"Decrease in dietary K intake stimulates the generation of superoxide anions in the kidney and inhibits K secretory channels in the CCD.We previously demonstrated that K depletion inhibited ROMK-like small-conductance K channels (SK) in the <e>cortical</e> collecting duct (CCD) and that the effect was mediated by superoxide anions that stimulated Src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) (51). However, because animals on a K-deficient diet had a severe hypokalemia, superoxide-dependent signaling may not regulate ROMK channels under physiological conditions with a normal plasma K concentration. In the present study, we used the patch-clamp technique and Western blot to examine the effect of a moderate K restriction on ROMK-like SK channels and the role of PTK and MAPK in regulating apical K channels in the CCD of animals on a low-K diet (LK; 0.1% K). Rats and mice fed a LK diet for 7 days had a normal plasma K concentration. However, a LK intake increased the expression of angiotensin II type 1 receptor in the kidney. Moreover, patch-clamp experiments demonstrated that LK intake decreased the probability finding SK channels and channel activity defined by NP(o) (a product of channel number and open probability) in the CCD of both rat and mouse kidneys. Also, LK intake significantly stimulated the production of superoxide anions in the renal cortex and outer medulla in both rats and mice and increased superoxide level in the rat CCD. Moreover, LK intake augments the phosphorylation of p38 and ERK MAPK, the expression of c-Src and tyrosine phosphorylation of ROMK channels. However, treatment of animals with tempol abolished the effect of LK intake on MAPK and c-Src and increased ROMK channel activity in comparing with those of nontreated rats on a LK diet. Inhibiting p38 and ERK with SB202190 and PD98059 significantly stimulated SK in the CCD in rats on a LK diet. In addition, inhibition of PTK with herbimycin A activated SK channels in the CCD from rats on a LK diet. We conclude that LK intake stimulates the generation of superoxide anion and related products and that MAPK and Src family PTK play a physiological role in inhibiting apical K channels in the principal cells in response to LK intake.",M1
20308608,"Effect of sodium loading/depletion on renal oxygenation in young normotensive and hypertensive men.The goal of this study was to investigate the effect of sodium intake on renal tissue oxygenation in humans. To this purpose, we measured renal hemodynamics, renal sodium handling, and renal oxygenation in normotensive (NT) and hypertensive (HT) subjects after 1 week of a high-sodium and 1 week of a low-sodium diet. Renal oxygenation was measured using blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance. Tissue oxygenation was determined by the measurement of R2* maps on 4 coronal slices covering both kidneys. The mean R2* values in the medulla and cortex were calculated, with a low R2* indicating a high tissue oxygenation. Ten male NT (mean age: 26.5+/-7.4 years) and 8 matched HT subjects (mean age: 28.8+/-5.7 years) were studied. <e>Cortical</e> R2* was not different under the 2 conditions of salt intake. Medullary R2* was significantly lower under low sodium than high sodium in both NT and HT subjects (28.1+/-0.8 versus 31.3+/-0.6 s(-1); P&lt;0.05 in NT; and 27.9+/-1.5 versus 30.3+/-0.8 s(-1); P&lt;0.05, in HT), indicating higher medullary oxygenation under low-sodium conditions. In NT subjects, medullary oxygenation was positively correlated with proximal reabsorption of sodium and negatively with absolute distal sodium reabsorption, but not with renal plasma flow. In HT subjects, medullary oxygenation correlated with the 24-hour sodium excretion but not with proximal or with the distal handling of sodium. These data demonstrate that dietary sodium intake influences renal tissue oxygenation, low sodium intake leading to an increased renal medullary oxygenation both in normotensive and young hypertensive subjects.",M1
20231442,"Mouse cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator forms cAMP-PKA-regulated apical chloride channels in <e>cortical</e> collecting duct.The cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is expressed in many segments of the mammalian nephron, where it may interact with and modulate the activity of a variety of apical membrane proteins, including the renal outer medullary potassium (ROMK) K(+) channel. However, the expression of CFTR in apical cell membranes or its function as a Cl(-) channel in native renal epithelia has not been demonstrated. Here, we establish that CFTR forms protein kinase A (PKA)-activated Cl(-) channels in the apical membrane of principal cells from the cortical collecting duct obtained from mice. These Cl(-) channels were observed in cell-attached apical patches of principal cells after stimulation by forskolin/3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine. Quiescent Cl(-) channels were present in patches excised from untreated tubules because they could be activated after exposure to Mg-ATP and the catalytic subunit of PKA. The single-channel conductance, kinetics, and anion selectivity of these Cl(-) channels were the same as those of recombinant mouse CFTR channels expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes. The CFTR-specific closed-channel blocker CFTR(inh)-172 abolished apical Cl(-) channel activity in excised patches. Moreover, apical Cl(-) channel activity was completely absent in principal cells from transgenic mice expressing the DeltaF508 CFTR mutation but was present and unaltered in ROMK-null mice. We discuss the physiologic implications of open CFTR Cl(-) channels on salt handling by the collecting duct and on the functional CFTR-ROMK interactions in modulating the metabolic ATP-sensing of ROMK.",M1
20219825,"Proteomic analysis of brush-border membrane vesicles isolated from purified proximal convoluted tubules.The renal proximal convoluted tubule is the primary site of water, electrolyte and nutrient reabsorption and of active secretion of selected molecules. Proteins in the apical brush-border membrane facilitate these functions and initiate some of the cellular responses to altered renal physiology. The current study uses two-dimensional liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry to compare brush border membrane vesicles isolated from rat renal cortex (BBMV(CTX)) and from purified proximal convoluted tubules (BBMV(PCT)). Both proteomic data and Western blot analysis indicate that the BBMV(CTX) contain apical membrane proteins from <e>cortical</e> cells other than the proximal tubule. This heterogeneity was greatly reduced in the BBMV(PCT). Proteomic analysis identified 193 proteins common to both samples, 21 proteins unique to BBMV(CTX), and 57 proteins unique to BBMV(PCT). Spectral counts were used to quantify relative differences in protein abundance. This analysis identified 42 and 50 proteins that are significantly enriched (p values &lt;or=0.001) in the BBMV(CTX) and BBMV(PCT), respectively. These data were validated by measurement of gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase activity and by Western blot analysis. The combined results establish that BBMV(PCT) are primarily derived from the proximal convoluted tubule (S1 and S2 segments), whereas BBMV(CTX) include proteins from the proximal straight tubule (S3 segment). Analysis of functional annotations indicated that BBMV(PCT) are enriched in mitochondrial proteins and enzymes involved in glucose and organic acid metabolism. Thus the current study reports a detailed proteomic analysis of the brush-border membrane of the rat renal proximal convoluted tubule and provides a database for future hypothesis-driven research.",M1
20170908,"Association between As and Cu renal cortex accumulation and physiological and histological alterations after chronic arsenic intake.Arsenic (As) is one of the most abundant hazards in the environment and it is a human carcinogen. Related to excretory functions, the kidneys in humans, animal models or naturally exposed fauna, are target organs for As accumulation and deleterious effects. Previous studies carried out using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry by synchrotron radiation (SR-microXRF) showed a high concentration of As in the renal cortex of chronically exposed rats, suggesting that this is a suitable model for studies on renal As accumulation. This accumulation was accompanied by a significant increase in copper (Cu) concentration. The present study focused on the localization of these elements in the renal cortex and their correlation with physiological and histological As-related renal effects. Experiments were performed on nine male Wistar rats, divided into three experimental groups. Two groups received 100 microg/ml sodium arsenite in drinking water for 60 and 120 consecutive days, respectively. The control group received water without sodium arsenite (&lt; 50 ppb As). For histological analysis, 5-mum-thick sections of kidneys were stained with hematoxylin and eosin. Biochemical analyses were used to determine concentrations of plasma urea and creatinine. The As and Cu mapping were carried out by SR-microXRF using a collimated white synchrotron spectrum (300 microm x 300 microm) on kidney slices (2 mm thick) showing As and Cu co-distribution in the renal cortex. Then, renal <e>cortical</e> slices (100 microm thick) were scanned with a focused white synchrotron spectrum (30 microm x 30 microm). Peri-glomerular accumulation of As and Cu at 60 and 120 days was found. The effects of 60 days of arsenic consumption were seen in a decreased Bowman's space as well as a decreased plasma blood urea nitrogen (BUN)/creatinine ratio. Major deleterious effects; however, were seen on tubules at 120 days of exposition. This study supports the hypothesis that tubular accumulation of As-Cu may have some bearing on the arsenic-associated nephrotoxicological process.",M1
20096887,"Predictive factors for acute renal <e>cortical</e> scintigraphic lesion and ultimate scar formation in children with first febrile urinary tract infection.PURPOSE: We assessed predictive factors for acute renal cortical scintigraphic lesion and ultimate scar formation in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 89 girls and 138 boys with a first febrile urinary tract infection were included in the study. We analyzed radiological (ultrasound, dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy, voiding cystourethrogram), clinical (age, gender, peak fever, therapeutic delay time) and laboratory (complete blood count with differential count, absolute neutrophil count, blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, urinalysis, Gram's stain, culture, C-reactive protein, erythrocyte sedimentation rate) variables. Dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy was performed within 5 days and at 6 months after diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Voiding cystourethrogram was performed after the acute phase of the urinary tract infection. Predictive factors for acute scintigraphic lesion and ultimate scar formation were assessed using logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Of 227 patients enrolled 140 had a refluxing and 87 a nonrefluxing urinary tract infection. On logistic regression analysis therapeutic delay time (p = 0.001) and presence of reflux (p = 0.011) were predictive of acute scintigraphic lesion and ultimate scar formation (p = 0.001 and p = 0.0001, respectively) in children with a first febrile urinary tract infection. CONCLUSIONS: Since vesicoureteral reflux is the common risk factor for acute scintigraphic lesion and ultimate scar formation, voiding cystourethrogram must be considered as an initial study in patients with acute febrile urinary tract infection.",M1
20068453,"Estrogen is renoprotective via a nonreceptor-dependent mechanism after cardiac arrest in vivo.BACKGROUND: Severe ischemia induces renal injury less frequently in women than men. In this study, cardiac arrest and cardiopulmonary resuscitation were used to assess whether estradiol is renoprotective via an estrogen receptor (ER)-dependent mechanism. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Male and female C57BL/6 and ER gene-deleted mice underwent 10 min of cardiac arrest followed by cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Serum chemistries and renal stereology were measured 24 h after arrest. RESULTS: Estrogen did not affect mean arterial pressure, regional renal <e>cortical</e> blood flow, and arterial blood gases. Hence, female kidneys were protected (mean +/- SEM: blood urea nitrogen, 65+/- 21 vs.149+/- 27 mg/dl, P = 0.04; creatinine, 0.14 +/- 0.05 vs. 0.73 +/- 0.16 mg/dl, P = 0.01; volume of necrotic tubules, 7 +/- 1% vs. 10 +/- 0%, P = 0.04). Estrogen also reduced renal injury. In intact females (n = 5), ovariectomized/vehicle-treated (n = 8), and ovariectomized/estrogen-treated (n = 8) animals, blood urea nitrogen was 65 +/- 21, 166 +/- 28, and 50 +/- 14 mg/dl (P = 0.002); creatinine was 0.14 +/- 0.05, 0.74 +/- 0.26, and 0.23 +/- 0.27 mg/dl (P = 0.014); necrotic tubules were 2.5 +/- 0.25%, 12.0 +/- 1.9%, and 5.0 +/- 1.6% (P = 0.004), respectively. In ER-[alpha] and ER-[beta] gene-deleted mice and controls estradiol-reduced functional injury (blood urea nitrogen: estradiol 117 +/- 71, vehicle 167 +/- 56, P = 0.007; creatinine: estradiol 0.5 +/- 0.5, vehicle 1.0 +/- 0.4, P = 0.013), but the effect of estradiol was not different between ER-[alpha] or ER-[beta] gene-deleted mice. Adding ICI 182,780 to estradiol did not alter injury. CONCLUSIONS: In women, kidneys were protected from cardiac arrest through estrogen. Estradiol-mediated renoprotection was not affected by ER deletion or blockade. Estradiol is renoprotective after cardiac arrest. The results indicate that estradiol renoprotection is ER-[alpha] and ER-[beta] independent.",M1
20061706,"Changes in renal <e>cortical</e> and medullary perfusion in a patient with renal vein thrombosis.Dynamic renal perfusion computerized tomographic (CT) scan was performed to test the cortical and medullary perfusion in a patient with unilateral renal vein thrombosis secondary to idiopathic focal and segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS). Forty mL of Iohexol was injected intravenously. Multiple fixed repeated axial renal CT scan cuts at specific intervals, over the mid pole, were recorded over 400 seconds. Radio density was measured over the aorta, cortex and medulla during that period. Graphs for the radio contrast density against time were plotted. Aortic, cortical and medullary perfusions were calculated by estimating the slopes of the curves. Based on the CT scan findings, perfusion of different parts of the kidney was measured. The reduction in kidney function with renal vein thrombosis seems to be secondary to hypoperfusion of renal cortex and medulla. Further studies are required to confirm this observation. The blood flow to the kidney im-proved within four days after therapy with anticoagulation and pulse steroids. The sequences of events that take place need further studies for validation.",M1
20059352,"Cold renal ischemia: comparison of efficacy between two techniques of cooling, in a swine model.OBJECTIVES: In a swine model of renal ischemia, we compared the effectiveness of the transurethral retrograde cold saline perfusion technique to the traditional method of renal cooling with ice slush, in achieving adequate parenchymal temperatures for functional preservation of the organ. Physiological and histological effects were also assessed. METHODS: Twenty-four domestic male pigs were sampled into four groups to be submitted to a 60-minute ischemia of the left kidney without cooling, with either one of the two cooling techniques (cold saline retrograde perfusion or ice slush), or sham surgery. All of them had also a concomitant right nephrectomy. Renal <e>cortical</e> and medullary temperatures were recorded throughout the experiment. Urinary output was measured, and serum renal function tests were carried on, pre- and postoperatively. After 5 days, the animals were euthanized and their kidneys were submitted to histological analysis. RESULTS: Mean renal temperature fell in both groups submitted to kidney cooling. With ice slush, a faster drop was observed and a lower minimum temperature was achieved (5.0 degrees C in the cortex and 6.3 degrees C in the medulla, vs. 25.4 degrees C and 24.9 degrees C with retrograde cooling). In the other groups, temperature was unchanged. Urinary output and serum creatinine worsened after the experiment, but without significant differences among groups. The histological analysis showed no differences among the four groups, for the studied ischemia time. CONCLUSIONS: Ice slush and retrograde perfusion of cold saline are both effective for cooling the kidney during ischemia. Ice slush is faster in doing so, and it allows much lower temperatures to be achieved in the renal parenchyma. With ischemia time of 60 minutes, no significant differences on the occurrence of functional and histological alterations were detected, even for the group without a cooling procedure.",M1
20006866,"7-year oncological outcomes after laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy.PURPOSE: Open partial nephrectomy has proven long-term oncological efficacy. Long-term outcomes of laparoscopic partial nephrectomy are pending. We present the long-term outcomes of patients undergoing laparoscopic or open partial nephrectomy for a single cT1 renal <e>cortical</e> tumor 7 cm or less. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Of 2,246 patients undergoing partial nephrectomy for a single cT1 tumor (1999 to 2008), minimum 7-year followup was available in 77 and 310, and minimum 1-year followup was available in 672 and 944 after laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy, respectively. Survival and recurrence data obtained from medical records, radiographic reports and patient contact were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: Median followup after laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy was 4.0 and 5.7 years, respectively. Oncological outcomes were excellent in both groups. On multivariable analysis predictors of all cause mortality included advancing age (p &lt;0.0001), comorbidity (p &lt;0.0001) and preoperative renal dysfunction (p = 0.0001) but not tumor size (p = 0.6) or operative approach (laparoscopic vs open partial nephrectomy, p = 0.06). Cancer recurred infrequently and only rarely caused mortality after laparoscopic or open partial nephrectomy. At 7 years metastasis-free survival was 97.5% and 97.3% (p = 0.47) after laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy, respectively. After accounting for baseline differences between the cohorts using propensity score matching 7-year metastasis-free survival was similar after laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy. CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy appear to provide similar long-term overall and cancer specific survival in patients undergoing partial nephrectomy for clinical stage T1 (7 cm or less) renal cortical tumors. Oncological outcomes at 7 years after laparoscopic and open partial nephrectomy are excellent with the majority (97%) of patients experiencing metastasis-free survival.",M1
20005345,"Comparison of two models for evaluation histopathology of experimental renal ischemia.Renal ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury is one of the frequent causes of acute renal failure (ARF) due to the complex, interrelated sequence of events, that result in damage to and death of kidney cells. Cells of the proximal tubular epithelium are especially susceptible to I/R injury, leading to acute tubular necrosis, which plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of ARF. Several models have been explicated to assess morphological changes, including those of Jabonski et al. and Goujon et al. We compared the 2 models for histopathological evaluation of 30- or 120-minute periods of renal ischemia followed by 24-hour reperfusion in rats. Several changes were observed after application of the 2 models: proximal tubular cell necrosis, loss of brush border, vacuolization, denudation of tubular basement membrane as a consequence of flattening of basal cells, and presence of intratubular exfoliated cells in the lumen of proximal convoluted tubules at various stages of degeneration (karyorexis, kariopyknosis and karyolysis). Evaluating tubular lesions after 2 periods of experimental ischemia with light microscopy allowed us to conclude that the Goujon classification better characterized the main changes in <e>cortical</e> renal tubules after ischemia.",M1
19955188,"Single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) for functional investigation of the proximal tubule in conscious mice.Noninvasive analysis of renal function in conscious mice is necessary to optimize the use of mouse models. In this study, we evaluated whether single photon emission-computed tomography (SPECT) using specific radionuclear tracers can be used to analyze changes in renal proximal tubule functions. The tracers included (99m)TC- dimercaptosuccinic acid ((99m)Tc-DMSA), which is used for cortex imaging; (99m)Tc-mercaptoacetyltriglycine ((99m)Tc-MAG3), used for dynamic renography; and (123)I-beta(2)-microglobulin, which monitors receptor-mediated endocytosis. (99m)Tc-DMSA SPECT imaging was shown to delineate the functional renal cortex with a approximately 1-mm spatial resolution and accumulated in the cortex reaching a plateau 5 h after injection. The <e>cortical</e> uptake of (99m)Tc-DMSA was abolished in Clcn5 knockout mice, a model of proximal tubule dysfunction. Dynamic renography with (99m)Tc-MAG3 in conscious mice demonstrated rapid extraction from blood, renal accumulation, and subsequent tubular secretion. Anesthesia induced a significant delay in the (99m)Tc-MAG3 clearance. The tubular reabsorption of (123)I-beta(2)-microglobulin was strongly impaired in the Clcn5 knockout mice, with defective tubular processing and loss of the native tracer in urine, reflecting proximal tubule dysfunction. Longitudinal studies in a model of cisplatin-induced acute tubular injury revealed a correlation between tubular recovery and (123)I-beta(2)-microglobulin uptake. These data show that SPECT imaging with well-validated radiotracers allows in vivo investigations of specific proximal tubule functions in conscious mice.",M1

For the purpose of the elevation of the self-descriptiveness and precision of diagnostics as well as for the reduction of the subjective estimation the authors carried out the evaluation of the structure of the liver's parenchyma and the cortical substance of the kidneys using the histography on the marked area.

19923411,"Heterogeneity of H-K-ATPase-mediated acid secretion along the mouse collecting duct.In the collecting duct (CD), H-K-ATPases function in cation reabsorption and H secretion. This study evaluated H-K-ATPase-mediated H secretion along the mouse CD, measured as EIPA- and luminal bafilomycin A(1)-insensitive intracellular pH (pH(i)) recovery from acute H loading (NH(4)) using BCECF. pH(i) recovery was measured in 1) microperfused <e>cortical</e>, outer medullary, and inner medullary CDs (CCD, OMCD, and IMCD) from C57BL/6J mice fed a normal diet and 2) common murine CD cell lines. H-K-ATPase activity along the native, microperfused CD was greatest in the CCD, less in the OMCD, and least in the IMCD (0.10 +/- 0.02, 0.04 +/- 0.01, and 0.01 +/- 0.002 U/min, respectively). H-K-ATPase activity was 0.30 +/- 0.03 and 0.26 +/- 0.03 in A- and B-type ICs, respectively, and was sensitive to Sch-28080 or ouabain. pH(i) recovery was greatest in the OMCD(1) cell line (0.25 +/- 0.01) and less in mpkCCD(c14) (0.17 +/- 0.01), mIMCD-K2 (0.12 +/- 0.01), and mIMCD-3 (0.05 +/- 0.01) cells. EIPA inhibited the majority of pH(i) recovery in these cells (100%, 64%, 75%, and 80% in mpkCCD(c14), OMCD(1), mIMCD-K2, and mIMCD-3, respectively). In OMCD(1) cells, where EIPA-insensitive pH(i) recovery was greatest, H-K-ATPase activity was 0.10 +/- 0.01 and was significantly inhibited (80%) by Sch-28080. We conclude that 1) H-K-ATPase-mediated H secretion in the native mouse CD is greatest in the ICs of the CCD, 2) A- and B-type ICs possess HKalpha(1) and HKalpha(2) H-K-ATPase activity, and 3) the OMCD(1) cell line best exhibits H-K-ATPase.",M1
19923406,"Attenuation of renal excretory responses to ANG II during inhibition of superoxide dismutase in anesthetized rats.To examine the functional interaction between superoxide dismutase (SOD) and NADPH oxidase activity, we assessed renal responses to acute intra-arterial infusion of ANG II (0.5 ng x kg(-1) x min(-1)) before and during administration of a SOD inhibitor, diethyldithiocarbamate (DETC, 0.5 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1)), in enalaprilat-pretreated (33 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1)) rats (n = 11). Total (RBF) and regional (<e>cortical</e>, CBF; medullary; MBF) renal blood flows were determined by Transonic and laser-Doppler flowmetry, respectively. Renal cortical and medullary tissue NADPH oxidase activity in vitro was determined using the lucigenin-chemiluminescence method. DETC treatment alone resulted in decreases in RBF, CBF, MBF, glomerular filtration rate (GFR), urine flow (V), and sodium excretion (U(Na)V) as reported previously. Before DETC, ANG II infusion decreased RBF (-18 +/- 3%), CBF (-16 +/- 3%), MBF [-5 +/- 6%; P = not significant (NS)], GFR (-31 +/- 4%), V (-34 +/- 2%), and U(Na)V (-53 +/- 3%). During DETC infusion, ANG II also caused similar reductions in RBF (-20 +/- 4%), CBF (-19 +/- 3%), MBF (-2 +/- 2; P = NS), and in GFR (-22 +/- 7%), whereas renal excretory responses (V; -12 +/- 2%; U(Na)V; -24 +/- 4%) were significantly attenuated compared with those before DETC. In in vitro experiments, ANG II (100 muM) enhanced NADPH oxidase activity both in cortical [13,194 +/- 1,651 vs. 20,914 +/- 2,769 relative light units (RLU)/mg protein] and in medullary (21,296 +/- 2,244 vs. 30,597 +/- 4,250 RLU/mg protein) tissue. Application of DETC (1 mM) reduced the basal levels and prevented ANG II-induced increases in NADPH oxidase activity in both tissues. These results demonstrate that renal excretory responses to acute ANG II administration are attenuated during SOD inhibition, which seems related to a downregulation of NADPH oxidase in the deficient condition of SOD activity.",M1
19906947,"Postobstructive regeneration of kidney is derailed when surge in renal stem cells during course of unilateral ureteral obstruction is halted.Unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO), a model of tubulointerstitial scarring (TIS), has a propensity toward regeneration of renal parenchyma after release of obstruction (RUUO). No information exists on the contribution of stem cells to this process. We performed UUO in FVB/N mice, reversed it after 10 days, and examined kidneys 3 wk after RUUO. UUO resulted in attenuation of renal parenchyma. FACS analysis of endothelial progenitor (EPC), mesenchymal stem (MSC) and hematopoietic stem (HSC) cells obtained from UUO kidneys by collagenase-dispersed single-cell suspension showed significant increase in EPC, MSC, and HSC compared with control. After RUUO <e>cortical</e> parenchyma was nearly restored, and TIS score improved by 3 wk. This reversal process was associated with return of stem cells toward baseline level. When animals were chronically treated with nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor at a dose that did not induce hypertension but resulted in endothelial dysfunction, TIS scores were not different from control UUO, but EPC number in the kidney decreased significantly; however, parenchymal regeneration in these mice was similar to control. Blockade of CXCR4-mediated engraftment resulted in dramatic worsening of UUO and RUUO. Similar results were obtained in caveolin-1-deficient but not -overexpressing mice, reflecting the fact that activation of CXCR4 occurs in caveolae. The present data show increase in EPC, HSC, and MSC population during UUO and a tendency for these cells to decrease to control level during RUUO. These processes are minimally affected by chronic NOS inhibition. Blockade of CXCR4-stromal cell-derived factor-1 (SDF-1) interaction by AMD3100 or caveolin-1 deficiency significantly reduced the UUO-associated surge in stem cells and prevented parenchymal regeneration after RUUO. We conclude that the surge in stem cell accumulation during UUO is a prerequisite for regeneration of renal parenchyma.",M1
19893496,"Sexual dimorphism in the blood pressure response to angiotensin II in mice after angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade.BACKGROUND: The incidence of hypertension and progression of renal disease are greater in men than in women. Data suggest that there is a dimorphic response to angiotensin II (Ang II) in rats, with male rats exhibiting a greater increase in mean arterial pressure (MAP) than females. However, during endogenous renin-angiotensin system (RAS) blockade with angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibition, female rats have a greater MAP response to Ang II. We tested whether female mice exhibit a greater MAP response to chronic Ang II during ACE inhibition. METHODS: Twenty-week-old male and female C57BL/6J mice (n &gt; or = 6/group), treated with enalapril (40 mg/kg/day in drinking water), were assigned to groups receiving either Ang II (800 ng/kg/min) or saline for 2 weeks. Enalapril treatment began 4 days before and continued throughout the experiment. RESULTS: MAP was higher in male mice than female mice treated with enalapril and Ang II (male: 144 +/- 3 vs. female: 121 +/- 6 mm Hg, P &lt; 0.05) and was not different between mice treated with enalapril alone (male: 99 +/- 3 vs. female: 100 +/- 3 mm Hg). F2-isoprostanes were not increased by Ang II; however, female mice had significantly higher levels than males. Renal <e>cortical</e> expression of catalase and Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase (SOD) was not different between experimental groups. Urinary protein was higher in male mice when compared to females, but was not changed after treatment with Ang II in either group. CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that there are species and sex-specific differences in the mechanism of the blood pressure response to Ang II, even during ACE inhibition.",M1
19893416,"The role of Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid renal <e>cortical</e> scintigraphy in acute and recurrent episodes of renal infarction in a patient with a tendency toward thrombosis.Tc-99m dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) renal cortical scintigraphy (RCS) of a 46-year-old man with abdominal and right flank pain who had history of a tendency toward thrombosis revealed extensive renal parenchymal changes secondary to renal infarction and a small size defect in the right kidney in addition to the patient's prior computed tomography results. The patient had Coumadin treatment. Two months later, he was referred to the hospital with the same symptoms. DMSA RCS established that the small defect in the right kidney had enlarged; other scarred areas persisted. This case indicates the value of DMSA RCS for early diagnosis, follow-up of acute/recurrent renal parenchymal scarring in patients with thrombophilia.",M1
19850246,"Effects of estradiol on renal cyclic guanosine monophosphate and oxidative stress in spontaneously hypertensive rats.BACKGROUND: Evidence suggests that estradiol offers protection against the development of cardiovascular and renal pathologies, although the mechanisms involved are still under investigation. The nitric oxide (NO) pathway regulates blood pressure and kidney function, and estradiol is associated with increases in NO bioavailability. We hypothesized that in female spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs), estra-diol increases NO bioavailability, activates the NO synthase (NOS) pathway, and suppresses superoxide production compared with rats that underwent ovariectomy (OVX). OBJECTIVE: The goal of this study was to determine whether estradiol regulates the NO/cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) pathway and superoxide levels in the kidneys of female SHR. METHODS: Three types of SHRs were studied: gonad-intact females, OVX rats, and OVX rats with estra-diol replacement (OVX+E). Renal <e>cortical</e> cGMP levels were measured to assess NO bioavailability. NOS enzymatic activity, NOS protein expression, basal superoxide production, and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase activity were measured in the renal cortex. RESULTS: Fifty-six SHRs were included in the study (17 intact females, 21 OVX rats, 18 OVX+E rats). Mean (SEM) cGMP levels were significantly lower in the renal cortex of OVX rats (0.03 [0.008] pmol/mg, n = 5) than in intact females (0.1 [0.02] pmol/mg, n = 6; P &lt; 0.05), and estradiol restored cGMP levels to those seen in intact females (0.1 [0.01] pmol/mg, n = 5; P &lt; 0.05). Despite a decrease in cGMP following OVX, renal cortical NOS activity, NOS1 and NOS3 protein expression, and the phosphorylation status of NOS3 were comparable among the 3 groups (n = 7-9 per group). However, mean basal superoxide production in the renal cortex was higher in OVX rats (3.2 [0.3] cpm/mg, n = 12) than in intact females (1.9 [0.3] cpm/mg, n = 8; P &lt; 0.05) and lower in OVX+E rats (1.3 [0.3] cpm/mg, n = 9; P &lt; 0.05). Mean NADPH oxidase activity was comparable in the renal cortex of intact females and OVX rats (81 [4] and 83 [12] cpm/35 microg, respectively [n = 5 per group]). OVX+E rats had significantly lower mean renal cortical NADPH oxidase activity than did rats in the other groups (45 [6] cpm/35 microg, n = 6; P &lt; 0.05), and the decrease in activity was accompanied by a decrease in p22(phox) protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: In vivo manipulations of estradiol levels influenced renal cortical NO bioavailability, as assessed indirectly by cGMP measurements. The decrease in cGMP following OVX was not due to alterations in the activity or expression of NOS.",M1
19836797,"Partial versus radical nephrectomy for 4 to 7 cm renal <e>cortical</e> tumors.PURPOSE: Recent observations suggest that partial nephrectomy for small renal tumors may be associated with improved survival compared with radical nephrectomy. We evaluated survival in patients with 4 to 7 cm renal tumors in a bi-institutional collaboration. MATERIALS AND METHODS: By combining institutional databases from Mayo Clinic and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center we identified 1,159 patients with 4.1 to 7.0 cm sporadic, unilateral, solitary, localized renal masses who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy between 1989 and 2006. Patient outcome was compared using Cox proportional hazards regression models. RESULTS: Of the 1,159 patients 873 (75%) and 286 (25%) were treated with radical and partial nephrectomy, respectively. Patients treated with partial vs radical nephrectomy were significantly more likely to have a solitary kidney (10% vs 0.2%) and chronic kidney disease (15% vs 7%, each p &lt;0.001). Median followup in survivors was 4.8 years (range 0 to 19). There was no significant difference in overall survival in patients treated with radical vs partial nephrectomy (p = 0.8). Of 943 patients with renal cell carcinoma those treated with radical nephrectomy were significantly more likely to die of renal cell carcinoma than those treated with partial nephrectomy (HR 2.16, 95% CI 1.04-4.50, p = 0.039) but this only approached statistical significance on multivariate analysis (HR 1.97, 95% CI 0.92-4.20, p = 0.079). CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest that overall and cancer specific survival is not compromised when partial nephrectomy is done for 4 to 7 cm renal cortical tumors. With the benefit of preserving renal function our results support partial nephrectomy when technically feasible for renal tumors up to 7 cm.",M1
19804826,"Protein kinase D stabilizes aldosterone-induced ERK1/2 MAP kinase activation in M1 renal <e>cortical</e> collecting duct cells to promote cell proliferation.Aldosterone elicits transcriptional responses in target tissues and also rapidly stimulates the activation of protein kinase signalling cascades independently of de novo protein synthesis. Here we investigated aldosterone-induced cell proliferation and extra-cellular regulated kinase 1 and 2 (ERK1/2) mitogen activated protein (MAP) kinase signalling in the M1 cortical collecting duct cell line (M1-CCD). Aldosterone promoted the proliferative growth of M1-CCD cells, an effect that was protein kinase D1 (PKD1), PKCdelta and ERK1/2-dependent. Aldosterone induced the rapid activation of ERK1/2 with peaks of activation at 2 and 10 to 30 min after hormone treatment followed by sustained activation lasting beyond 120 min. M1-CCD cells suppressed in PKD1 expression exhibited only the early, transient peaks in ERK1/2 activation without the sustained phase. Aldosterone stimulated the physical association of PKD1 with ERK1/2 within 2 min of treatment. The mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist RU28318 inhibited the early and late phases of aldosterone-induced ERK1/2 activation, and also aldosterone-induced proliferative cell growth. Aldosterone induced the sub-cellular redistribution of ERK1/2 to the nuclei at 2 min and to cytoplasmic sites, proximal to the nuclei after 30 min. This sub-cellular distribution of ERK1/2 was inhibited in cells suppressed in the expression of PKD1.",M1
19733226,"Targets of chloroacetaldehyde-induced nephrotoxicity.Chloroacetaldehyde, one of the main products of hepatic ifosfamide metabolism, contributes to its nephrotoxicity. However, the pathophysiology of this toxicity is not fully understood. The present work examined the time and dose effects of clinically relevant concentrations of chloroacetaldehyde (25-75microM) on precision-cut rat renal <e>cortical</e> slices metabolizing a physiological concentration of lactate. Chloroacetaldehyde toxicity was demonstrated by the decrease in total glutathione and cellular ATP levels. The drop of cellular ATP was linked to the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation at the level of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. The large decrease in glucose synthesis from lactate was explained by the inhibition of some gluconeogenic enzymes, mainly glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. The decrease in lactate utilization was demonstrated not only by a defect of gluconeogenesis but also by the decrease in [(14)CO(2)] formation from [U-(14)C]-lactate. All the effects of chloroacetaldehyde were concentration and time-dependent. Finally, the chloroacetaldehyde-induced inhibition of glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, which is also a glycolytic enzyme, suggests that, under conditions close to those found during ifosfamide therapy, the inhibition of glycolytic pathway by chloroacetaldehyde might be responsible, at least in part, for the therapeutic efficacy of ifosfamide.",M1
19710386,"Recovery from renal ischemia-reperfusion injury is associated with altered renal hemodynamics, blunted pressure natriuresis, and sodium-sensitive hypertension.The present studies evaluated intrarenal hemodynamics, pressure natriuresis, and arterial blood pressure in rats following recovery from renal ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) injury. Acute I/R injury, induced by 40 min of bilateral renal arterial occlusion, resulted in an increase in plasma creatinine that resolved within a week. Following 5 wk of recovery on a 0.4% NaCl diet, the pressure-natriuresis response was assessed in anesthetized rats in which the kidney was denervated and extrarenal hormones were administered intravenously. Increasing renal perfusion pressure (RPP) from 107 to 141 mmHg resulted in a fourfold increase in urine flow and sodium excretion in sham control rats. In comparison, pressure diuresis and natriuresis were significantly attenuated in post-I/R rats. In sham rats, glomerular filtration rate (GFR) averaged 1.6 +/- 0.2 mlxmin(-1)xg kidney weight(-1) and renal blood flow (RBF) averaged 7.8 +/- 0.7 mlxmin(-1)xg kidney weight(-1) at RPP of 129 mmHg. Renal <e>cortical</e> blood flow, measured by laser-Doppler flowmetry, was well autoregulated whereas medullary blood flow and renal interstitial hydrostatic pressure increased directly with elevated RPP in sham rats. In contrast, GFR and RBF were significantly reduced whereas medullary perfusion and interstitial pressure demonstrated an attenuated response to RPP in post-I/R rats. Further experiments demonstrated that conscious I/R rats develop hypertension when sodium intake is increased. The present data indicate that the pressure-natriuretic-diuretic response in I/R rats is blunted because of a decrease in GFR and RBF and the depressed pressure-dependent increase in medullary blood flow and interstitial pressure.",M1
19625262,"Renal <e>cortical</e> thickness as a predictor of renal function and blood pressure status post renal artery stenting.Renal artery stenting is a widely performed procedure for atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. It is very important to identify patients that will benefit from this procedure as this may involve potential risk and complications. Our study is a retrospective analysis aimed at evaluation of mid-pole renal cortical thickness at the time of stenting and correlating with renal function and blood pressure after the procedure. A total of 48 procedures were done on 31 patients evaluated in this study. The change in SBP was greater for the abnormal group compared to the normal group (-1.49 mmHg vs. -0.98 mmHg, P = 0.7813). The change in DBP was greater for the abnormal group compared to the normal group (-0.68 mmHg vs. 0.04 mmHg, P = 0.3809). The change in odds of having a GFR in higher categories was greater for the abnormal group compared to the normal group (OR =1.23 vs. 1.05, P = 0.3085). Our study did not show a significant association of renal cortical thickness and outcomes of BP and GFR following stenting of atherosclerotic renal artery stenosis. However, we did find a greater improvement in BP and GFR in patients with abnormal cortical thickness compared to those with normal cortical thickness.",M1
19620428,"Comparison of 99mTc-DMSA dual-head SPECT versus high-resolution parallel-hole planar imaging for the detection of renal <e>cortical</e> defects.OBJECTIVE: Renal cortical scintigraphy with (99m)Tc dimer captosuccinic acid (DMSA) is the standard method to detect acute pyelonephritis and cortical scarring. Different acquisition methods have been used: planar parallel-hole or pinhole collimation and single photon emission tomography (SPECT). Publications support the superiority of each; few comparative studies have been reported, with mixed results. We have compared planar parallel-hole cortical scintigraphy and dual-head SPECT for detection of cortical defects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty patients (37 children, 3 adults; 9 male, 31 female) were imaged 3 hours after injection of (99m)Tc-DMSA with dual-head SPECT and planar imaging (posterior, left, and right posterior oblique views with a parallel-hole collimator). For each patient, planar and SPECT images were evaluated at different sittings, in random order, by three independent observers. Twelve cortical segments were scored as normal or reduced uptake. The linear correlation coefficient for the number of abnormal segments detected between readers, techniques, and segments was calculated. RESUlTS: No significant difference was seen in the average number of abnormal segments detected by planar versus SPECT imaging; 2.1 for planar imaging and 2.2 for SPECT (p = 0.84, two-tailed). For all observers, the average correlation coefficient for SPECT alone, planar imaging alone, and between techniques (SPECT vs planar imaging) was high (r = 0.93-0.94). Applying nonparametric Spearman's rank analysis, the average correlation remained high (r = 0.70-0.75). Correlation between readers, techniques, and segments for methods and readers was also good (r = 0.69-0.77). CONClUSION: (99m)Tc-DMSA renal cortical imaging using dual-head SPECT offers no statistically significant diagnostic advantage over planar imaging for detection of cortical defects.",M1
19581826,"Characterization and culture of fetal rhesus monkey renal <e>cortical</e> cells.The renal glomerulus is composed of endothelial and mesangial cells with podocytes contributing to glomerular filtration. Podocyte damage is associated with renal disorders, thus there is interest in these cells for regenerative medicine. These studies investigated the use of extracellular matrix (ECM) to grow third trimester fetal monkey renal cortical cells and to assess mature podocytes in culture. Immunohistochemistry provided a profile of podocyte differentiation with metanephric mesenchyme and developing podocytes nestin positive and synaptopodin negative, whereas mature podocytes were positive for both markers. Primary cell cultures devoid of mature podocytes were established on plastic and renal ECM. A cell population (nestin+/synatopodin-) cultured on renal ECM showed greater proliferative potential compared with plastic with limited podocytes developing in culture over time. Further investigation of individual components of ECM (laminin, fibronectin, collagen I, or collagen IV) indicated that collagen I supported the greatest proliferation similar to renal ECM, whereas a greater number of mature podocytes (nestin+/synaptopodin+) were observed on fibronectin. These results suggest that (1) culture of fetal monkey podocytes can be accomplished, (2) renal ECM and collagen I can support renal cortical cells in vitro, which may recapitulate the developing kidney in vivo, and (3) fibronectin can support podocyte differentiation in vitro.",M1
19557179,"Alteration of gene expression signatures of <e>cortical</e> differentiation and wound response in lethal clear cell renal cell carcinomas.Clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is the most common malignancy of the adult kidney and displays heterogeneity in clinical outcomes. Through comprehensive gene expression profiling, we have identified previously a set of transcripts that predict survival following nephrectomy independent of tumor stage, grade, and performance status. These transcripts, designated as the SPC (supervised principal components) gene set, show no apparent biological or genetic features that provide insight into renal carcinogenesis or tumor progression. We explored the relationship of this gene list to a set of genes expressed in different anatomical segments of the normal kidney including the cortex (cortex gene set) and the glomerulus (glomerulus gene set), and a gene set expressed after serum stimulation of quiescent fibroblasts (the core serum response or CSR gene set). Interestingly, the normal cortex, glomerulus (part of the normal renal cortex), and CSR gene sets captured more than 1/5 of the genes in the highly prognostic SPC gene set. Based on gene expression patterns alone, the SPC gene set could be used to sort samples from normal adult kidneys by the anatomical regions from which they were dissected. Tumors whose gene expression profiles most resembled the normal renal cortex or glomerulus showed better survival than those that did not, and those with expression features more similar to CSR showed poorer survival. While the cortex, glomerulus, and CSR signatures predicted survival independent of traditional clinical parameters, they were not independent of the SPC gene list. Our findings suggest that critical biological features of lethal ccRCC include loss of normal cortical differentiation and activation of programs associated with wound healing.",M1
19528250,"Differential action of bradykinin on intrarenal regional perfusion in the rat: waning effect in the cortex and major impact in the medulla.The renal kallikrein-kinin system is involved in the control of the intrarenal circulation and arterial pressure but bradykinin (Bk) effects on perfusion of individual kidney zones have not been examined in detail. Effects of Bk infused into renal artery, renal cortex or medulla on perfusion of whole kidney (RBF, renal artery probe) and of the cortex, outer- and inner medulla (CBF, OMBF, IMBF: laser-Doppler fluxes), were examined in anaesthetized rats. Renal artery infusion of Bk, 0.3-0.6 mg kg(-1) h(-1), induced no sustained increase in RBF or CBF. OMBF and IMBF increased initially 6 or 16%, respectively; only the IMBF increase (+10%) was sustained. Pre-treatment with L-NAME, 2.4 mg kg(-1) I.V., prevented the sustained but not initial transient elevation of medullary perfusion. Intracortical Bk infusion, 0.75-1.5 mg kg(-1) h(-1), did not alter RBF or CBF but caused a sustained 33% increase in IMBF. Intramedullary Bk, 0.3 mg kg(-1) h(-1), did not alter RBF or CBF but caused sustained increases in OMBF (+10%) and IMBF (+23%). These responses were not altered by pre-treatment with 1-aminobenzotriazole, 10 mg kg(-1)i.v., a cytochrome P-450 (CYP450) inhibitor, but were prevented or significantly attenuated by L-NAME or intramedullary clotrimazole, 3.9 mg kg(-1) h(-1), an inhibitor of CYP450 epoxygenase and of calcium-dependent K(+) channels (K(Ca)). Thus, <e>cortical</e> vasodilatation induced by Bk is only transient so that the agent is unlikely to control perfusion of the cortex. Bk selectively increases perfusion of the medulla, especially of its inner layer, via activation of the NO system and of K(Ca) channels.",M1

19481185,"Impact of ligating gonadal or adrenal collateral veins with the left renal vein on renal function and histology in right-nephrectomized rats.BACKGROUND: In cases of trauma to the left renal vein (LRV), its ligation near the inferior vena cava (IVC) is considered, but the consequences are not always good. We investigated the role of collateral venous drainage after ligation of the LRV by studying the renal function and histology after ligation of the LRV near the IVC alone or with ligation of the gonadal or adrenal collaterals, in right-nephrectomized (RN) rats. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ligation of the LRV near the IVC alone (group 1) or with ligation of the adrenal (group 2) or gonadal (group 3) collaterals was studied in RN Wistar rats (n=18 per group). The renal histopathology (ischemic <e>cortical</e> necrosis) and functional status (urea, creatinine, sodium, and potassium) were compared. RESULTS: In RN rats, the results were better when ligating the LRV near the IVC alone or with the adrenal collaterals [mortality 4/18 (22.2%) and 3/18 (16.7%), respectively] than when ligating the LRV near the IVC plus the gonadal collaterals [mortality 15/18 (83.3%)] (p&lt;0.0001). All early deaths occurred within three days and resulted from serious histopathological (ischemic cortical necrosis) and functional (increased urea, creatinine, and potassium; decreased sodium) renal damage. CONCLUSION: In right-nephrectomized rats, the LRV near the IVC and the adrenal collateral can be ligated, while the gonadal collateral should be preserved.",M1
19424163,"Diet-induced renal changes in Zucker rats are ameliorated by the superoxide dismutase mimetic TEMPOL.Diabetic nephropathy is the leading cause of renal failure in the United States. The obese Zucker rat (OZR; fa/fa) is a commonly used model of type 2 diabetes and metabolic syndrome (MetS), and of the nephropathy and renal oxidative stress commonly seen in these disorders. Heterozygous lean Zucker rats (LZRs; fa/+) are susceptible to high-fat diet (HFD)-induced obesity and MetS. The present study was designed to investigate whether 4-hydroxy-2,2,6,6-tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (TEMPOL), a membrane-permeable radical scavenger, could alleviate the renal effects of MetS in OZR and LZR fed a HFD, which resembles the typical  Western  diet. OZR and LZR were fed a HFD (OZR-HFD and LZR-HFD) or regular diet (OZR-RD and LZR-RD) and allowed free access to drinking water or water containing 1 mmol/l TEMPOL for 10 weeks. When compared to OZR-RD animals, OZR-HFD animals exhibited significantly higher levels of total renal <e>cortical</e> reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, plasma lipids, insulin, C-reactive protein, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine (Cr), and urinary albumin excretion (P &lt; 0.05); these changes were accompanied by a significant decrease in plasma high-density lipoprotein levels (P &lt; 0.05). The mRNA expression levels of desmin, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), nuclear factor kappaB (NFkappaB), and NAD(P)H oxidase-1 (NOX-1) were significantly higher in the renal cortical tissues of OZR-HFD animals; NFkappaB p65 DNA binding activity as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay was also significantly higher in these animals. The same trends were noted in LZR-HFD animals. Our data demonstrate that TEMPOL may prove beneficial in treating the early stages of the nephropathy often associated with MetS.",M1
19386749,"Ischaemia/reperfusion in rat renal cortex: vesicle leakiness and Na+, K+-ATPase activity in membrane preparations.BACKGROUND: Despite the central role of Na(+), K(+)-ATPase (NKA) in ischaemic renal injury (IRI), <e>cortical</e> NKA activity values during renal ischaemia remain controversial. In this study, we explore why cortical NKA activity shows such behaviour during ischaemia in rats. METHODS: Ischaemia was induced by unilateral renal artery clamping (40 min, I) followed or not by reperfusion (60 min, IR). NKA alpha- and beta-subunit abundance was analysed by western blot. We studied the NKA detergent sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) enzymatic activation in isolated membrane preparations from control and ischaemic kidneys. RESULTS: NKA activity was diminished in I cortical homogenates (C = 9.3 +/- 1.1, I = 4.7 +/- 1.1* micromol Pi/h mg Prot, n = 4-6, *P &lt; 0.05 versus C). This was rapidly recovered after reperfusion (IR = 9.9 +/- 1.2 micromol Pi/h mg Prot). alpha-subunit levels were increased, while beta-subunit was unchanged. At SDS 0.9 mg/ml (maximal detergent activation), the activities were indistinguishable (C = 90.5 +/- 2.2, I = 91.4 +/- 15.1 micromol Pi/h mg Prot). The analysis of detergent activation of NKA activity is widely used to estimate membrane leakiness in plasma membrane preparations. Our results suggest a higher population of sealed impermeable vesicles in preparations from ischaemic renal tissue. CONCLUSION: The well-known effect of ischaemia on renal cell cytoskeleton could explain the observed changes in the leakiness of membrane vesicles.",M1
19361964,"[Abnormalities of hepatocyte nuclear factor (HNF)-1beta: biological mechanisms, phenotypes, and clinical consequences]The hepatocyte nuclear factor-1beta encoded by the TCF2 gene plays a role in the specific regulation of gene expression in various tissues such as liver, kidney, intestine, and pancreatic islets and is involved in the embryonic development of these organs. TCF2 mutations are known to be responsible for maturity-onset diabetes of the young type 5, associated with renal manifestations. Several studies have shown that TCF2 mutations are involved in restricted renal phenotypes. In a recent study, TCF2 anomalies were detected in one third of patients with renal anomalies such as renal cysts, hyperechogenicity, hypoplasia, or single kidneys. Most patients have a complete deletion of the TCF2 gene. With de novo TCF2 anomalies, deletions were the most frequent anomaly. TCF2 anomalies were significantly associated with bilateral renal anomalies and bilateral <e>cortical</e> cysts. However, no genotype-phenotype correlation could be detected. The prenatal phenotype of TCF2 anomalies is mainly bilateral hyperechogenic kidneys. Abnormal renal function, detected in about one third of patients, was independent of the TCF2 genotype. The best parameter to predict renal outcome remains sonographic evaluation. However, progression of the TCF2 phenotype is common. In conclusion, TCF2 molecular anomalies are involved in restricted renal phenotype in childhood without alteration of glucose metabolism. Adequate metabolic follow-up of pediatric patients with a restricted renal phenotype has not yet been defined and consideration of prenatal diagnosis remains extremely difficult given the extremely large phenotypic variability within the same family.",M1
19341836,"A renal protocol for all ages and all indications: mercapto-acetyl-triglycine (MAG3) with simultaneous injection of furosemide (MAG3-F0): a 17-year experience.Current clinical requirements mandate the existence of a renal diuretic protocol, which is fast and easy, applicable in all ages and for all indications, convenient for both the patient and the technologist, and provides diagnostic as well as prognostic information. Seventeen years ago a 25-minute protocol, after oral hydration, with no bladder catheterization, and simultaneous injection of mercapto-acetyl-triglycine (MAG(3)) and furosemide (MAG(3)-F(0)), was initiated. It initially was used for the evaluation of drainage and emerged as a protocol to also evaluate the renal parenchyma. Results of this protocol have been published individually, per clinical application. MAG(3)-F(0) was instrumental in the evaluation and prognosis of congenital disorders. For obstruction, in the newborn, an increasing renogram mandates intervention, whereas a downsloping one predicts spontaneous resolution. In children or adults, preoperatively or postoperatively, when the cortex was visualized and drained normally, there was no obstruction, even if urine was retained within a dilated collecting system or an extrarenal pelvis. For diseases of the renal parenchyma, the protocol enabled the diagnosis of acute pyelonephritis (APN) revealing the  regional parenchymal dysfunction,  diagnostic of APN. Diffuse parenchymal diseases were characterized by increased residual <e>cortical</e> activity (RCA), and their progression was manifested as a deterioration of RCA. End-stage renal disease was characterized by lack of accumulation and retention. Trauma and leaks were identified with specific patterns. In renovascular hypertension (RVH), an increase in RCA after angiotension-converting enzyme inhibitors is diagnostic of RVH and prognostic of the beneficial effect of angioplasty on hypertension. In renal colic, stratification was possible into (1) complete or severe obstruction requiring immediate intervention, (2) mild obstruction allowing waiting, (3) spontaneous decompression (stunned kidney), and (4) no recent obstruction. In transplants, it enabled differentiation of acute tubular necrosis, acute or chronic rejection and nephrotoxicity, and identified infarcts, RVH, leaks and obstruction. Finally, this method allows for a quick semiquantification of renal function. The clinical usefulness of the MAG(3)-F(0) protocol in most congenital or acquired renal problems is proven through long-term clinical experience and has resulted in a substantial utilization of the test at our Center.",M1
19328943,"Evaluation of intrarenal oxygenation by blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging in living kidney donors and their recipients: preliminary results.OBJECTIVE: Blood oxygen level-dependent magnetic resonance imaging (BOLD-MRI) is a noninvasive tool to measure modifications in tissue oxygen content. Lower deoxyhemoglobin concentrations due to increased tissue oxygenation induce a longer transverse relaxation time (T2*), thus a stronger MRI signal. We have studied the changes in the kidney oxygenation profiles of living donors and their recipients by BOLD-MRI associated with transplantation and nephrectomy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two donor/recipient couples were selected for this preliminary study. BOLD-MRI was performed on the donor on the day prior to surgery, on day 4, and 1 month thereafter, and on the recipient on day 4 and 1 month postsurgery. Mean T2* values were measured in specific target regions in the <e>cortical</e> and medullary regions of each kidney using the T2StarMappingTool (Philips, Eindhoven, Netherlands). Modifications of tissue oxygen profiles were then compared considering the proportionality between T2* values and tissue oxygen content. RESULTS: The clinical courses posttransplantation were uneventful throughout the study; kidney function resumed rapidly. All MRI examinations showed a significantly higher T2* level in the cortex than in the medulla, confirming the notion that the medulla is hypoxic compared to the cortex. Nephrectomy and transplantation induced a significant rise in cortical T2* values in the remnant and transplanted kidney at day 4 and 1 month. Medullary T2* level only increased in the transplanted kidney. CONCLUSIONS: Profound modifications in renal oxygenation intervene following transplantation and nephrectomy. BOLD-MRI may be a useful tool to explore these modifications and possibly identify pathological patterns.",M1
19302553,"Influence of high dietary sodium intake on the functional subtypes of alpha-adrenoceptors in the renal <e>cortical</e> vasculature of Wistar-Kyoto rats.1 Increased renal vascular resistance is one renal functional abnormality that contributes to hypertension, and alpha(1)-adrenoceptors play a pivotal role in modulating this renal vascular resistance. This study investigates the functional contribution of alpha(1)-adrenoceptor subtypes in the renal cortical vasculature of Wistar-Kyoto rats on a normal sodium diet (WKYNNa) compared with those given saline to drink for 6 weeks (WKYHNa). 2 The renal cortical vascular responses to the adrenergic agonists noradrenaline (NA), methoxamine (ME) and phenylephrine (PE) were measured in WKYHNa and WKYNNa rats either in the absence (the control phase) or presence of chloroethylclonidine (CEC), an alpha(1B)-adrenoceptor antagonist, 5-methylurapidil (5-MeU), an alpha(1A) antagonist, or BMY7378, an alpha(1D) antagonist. 3 Results showed a greater renal cortical vascular sensitivity to NA, PE and ME in the WKYHNa compared with WKYNNa rats (P &lt; 0.05). Moreover, 5-MeU and BMY7378 attenuated adrenergically induced renal cortical vasoconstriction in WKYHNa and WKYNNa rats; this response was largely blunted in CEC-treated WKYHNa rats (all P &lt; 0.05) but not in CEC-treated WKYNNa rats. 4 The data suggest that irrespective of dietary sodium content, in Wistar-Kyoto rats alpha(1A)- and alpha(1D)-subtypes are the major alpha(1)-adrenoceptors in renal cortical vasculature; however, there appears to be a functional involvement of alpha(1B)-adrenoceptors in the WKYHNa rats.",M1
19297448,"Effects of mineralocorticoid and K+ concentration on K+ secretion and ROMK channel expression in a mouse <e>cortical</e> collecting duct cell line.The cortical collecting duct (CCD) plays a key role in regulated K(+) secretion, which is mediated mainly through renal outer medullary K(+) (ROMK) channels located in the apical membrane. However, the mechanisms of the regulation of urinary K(+) excretion with regard to K(+) balance are not well known. We took advantage of a recently established mouse CCD cell line (mCCD(cl1)) to investigate the regulation of K(+) secretion by mineralocorticoid and K(+) concentration. We show that this cell line expresses ROMK mRNA and a barium-sensitive K(+) conductance in its apical membrane. As this conductance is sensitive to tertiapin-Q, with an apparent affinity of 6 nM, and to intracellular acidification, it is probably mediated by ROMK. Overnight exposure to 100 nM aldosterone did not significantly change the K(+) conductance, while it increased the amiloride-sensitive Na(+) transport. Overnight exposure to a high K(+) (7 mM) concentration produced a small but significant increase in the apical membrane barium-sensitive K(+) conductance. The mRNA levels of all ROMK isoforms measured by qRT-PCR were not changed by altering the basolateral K(+) concentration but were decreased by 15-45% upon treatment with aldosterone (0.3 or 300 nM for 1 and 3 h). The paradoxical response of ROMK expression to aldosterone could possibly work as a preventative mechanism to avoid excessive K(+) loss which would otherwise result from the increased electrogenic Na(+) transport and associated depolarization of the apical membrane in the CCD. In conclusion, mCCD(cl1) cells demonstrate a significant K(+) secretion, probably mediated by ROMK, which is not stimulated by aldosterone but increased by overnight exposure to a high K(+) concentration.",M1
19286697,"Expression of endothelial protein C receptor in <e>cortical</e> peritubular capillaries associates with a poor clinical response in lupus nephritis.OBJECTIVE: To study the membrane expression of endothelial protein C receptor (mEPCR) in the renal microvasculature in lupus nephritis (LN) as a potential marker of injury and/or prognostic indicator for response to therapy. METHODS: mEPCR expression was analysed by immunohistochemistry in normal kidney and in 59 biopsies from 49 patients with LN. Clinical parameters were assessed at baseline, 6 months and 1 year. RESULTS: mEPCR was expressed in the medulla, arterial endothelium and cortical peritubular capillaries (PTCs) in all biopsies with LN but not in the cortical PTCs of normal kidney. Positive mEPCR staining in &gt;25% of the PTCs was observed in 16/59 biopsies and associated with poor response to therapy. Eleven (84.6%) of 13 patients with positive staining for mEPCR in &gt;25% of the PTCs and follow-up at 6 months did not respond to therapy, compared with 8/28 (28.6%) with mEPCR staining in &lt; or =25% PTCs, P = 0.0018. At 1 year, 10 (83.3%) of 12 patients with positive mEPCR staining in &gt;25% of the PTCs did not respond to therapy (with two progressing to end-stage renal disease) compared with 8/24 (33.3%) with positive staining in &lt; or =25% of the PTCs, P = 0.0116. Although tubulo-interstitial damage (TID) was always accompanied by mEPCR, this endothelial marker was extensively expressed in the absence of TID suggesting that poor response could not be attributed solely to increased TID. mEPCR expression was independent of International Society of Nephrology/Renal Pathology Society class, activity and chronicity indices. CONCLUSION: Increased mEPCR expression in PTCs may represent a novel marker of poor response to therapy for LN.",M1
19276743,"Pathophysiology of renal hemodynamics and renal <e>cortical</e> microcirculation in a porcine model of elevated intra-abdominal pressure.BACKGROUND: Elevated intra-abdominal pressure (IAP) has been shown to impair renal perfusion and renal function. This study was designed to further investigate the effects of elevated IAP on renal venous hemodynamics and renal perfusion pressure (RPP). Another aim was to evaluate the renal cortical microcirculation by sidestream dark field (SDF) imaging in a porcine model of elevated IAP. METHODS: In 11 pigs, IAP was increased stepwise while renal hemodynamics and urinary output were recorded. RPP (RPP = mean arterial pressure minus IAP) and renal filtration gradient (RFG = mean arterial pressure minus 2xIAP) were calculated. Renal cortical microcirculatory perfusion was assessed by calculating the microvascular flow index (MFI) based on SDF data. RESULTS: With IAP elevated to 30 mm Hg, renal arterial and venous flow decreased in parallel by 34% (p &lt; 0.05) and RPP decreased by 12% (p &lt; 0.05). With increasing IAP, renal vascular resistance increased and MFI decreased significantly. RFG showed a moderate correlation with renal blood flow (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.05) and MFI (r = 0.46, p &lt; 0.005), whereas RPP did not. CONCLUSIONS: In a porcine model of IAP-induced renal impairment, we observed a parallel decrease in renal venous and arterial blood flow together with blood flow redistribution away from the kidney. SDF imaging was used for the first time to assess renal cortical microcirculation and MFI was found to decrease with increasing IAP. RFG, as a clinical estimator of renal perfusion, correlated moderately with renal blood flow and microcirculatory perfusion, whereas RPP did not. Increased renal vascular resistance with elevated IAP might account for this.",M1
19262227,"Rosuvastatin protects against angiotensin II-induced renal injury in a dose-dependent fashion.OBJECTIVE: We showed earlier that statin treatment ameliorates target-organ injury in a transgenic model of angiotensin (Ang) II-induced hypertension. We now test the hypothesis that rosuvastatin (1, 10, and 50 mg/kg/day) influences leukocyte adhesion and infiltration, prevents induction of inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and ameliorates target-organ damage in a dose-dependent fashion. METHODS: We treated rats harboring the human renin and human angiotensinogen genes (dTGR) from week 4 to 8 (n = 20 per group). Untreated dTGR developed severe hypertension, cardiac hypertrophy, and renal damage, with a 100-fold increased albuminuria and focal <e>cortical</e> necrosis. Mortality of untreated dTGR at age 8 weeks was 59%. RESULTS: Rosuvastatin treatment decreased mortality dose-dependently. Blood pressure was not affected. Albuminuria was reduced dose-dependently. Interstitial adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 expression was markedly reduced by rosuvastatin, as were neutrophil and monocyte infiltration. Immunohistochemistry showed an increased endothelial and medial iNOS expression in small vessels, infiltrating cells, afferent arterioles, and glomeruli of dTGR. Immunoreactivity was stronger in cortex than medulla. Rosuvastatin markedly reduced the iNOS expression in both cortex and medulla. Finally, matrix protein (type IV collagen, fibronectin) expression was also dose- dependently reduced by rosuvastatin. CONCLUSION: Our findings indicate that rosuvastatin dose- dependently ameliorates angiotensin II-induced-organ damage and almost completely prevents inflammation at the highest dose. The data implicate 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A function in signaling events leading to target-organ damage.",M1
19261745,"Renal ischemia-reperfusion injury upregulates histone-modifying enzyme systems and alters histone expression at proinflammatory/profibrotic genes.Ischemic renal injury can produce chronic renal inflammation and fibrosis. This study tested whether ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) activates histone-modifying enzyme systems and alters histone expression at selected proinflammatory/profibrotic genes. CD-1 mice were subjected to 30 min of unilateral I/R. Contralateral kidneys served as controls. At 1, 3, or 7 days of reflow, bilateral nephrectomy was performed. Renal cortices were probed for monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and collagen III mRNAs and cytokine levels. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) binding, which initiates transcription, was quantified at exon 1 of the MCP-1, TGF-beta1, collagen III genes (chromatin immunoprecipitation assay). Two representative gene-activating histone modifications [histone 3 lysine 4 (H3K4) trimethylation (m3) (H3K4m3); histone 2 variant H2A.Z] were sought. Degrees of binding of two relevant histone-modifying enzymes (Set1, BRG1) to target genes were assessed. Renal <e>cortical</e> Set1, BRG1, and H2A.Z mRNAs were measured. Finally, the potential utility of urinary mRNA concentrations as noninvasive markers of these in vivo processes was tested. I/R caused progressive increases in Pol II binding to MCP-1, TGF-beta1, and collagen III genes. Parallel increases in cognate mRNAs also were expressed. Progressive increases in renal cortical Set1, BRG1, H2A.Z mRNAs, and increased Set1/BRG1 binding to target genes occurred. These changes corresponded with: 1) progressive elevations of H3K4m3 and H2A.Z at each test gene; 2) increases in renal cortical TGF-beta1/MCP-1 cytokines; and 3) renal collagen deposition (assessed by histomorphology). Postischemic increases in urinary TGF-beta1, MCP-1, Set1, and BRG1 mRNAs were also observed. We conclude that: 1) I/R upregulates histone-modifying enzyme systems, 2) histone modifications at proinflammatory/profibrotic genes can result, and 3) urinary mRNA assessments may have utility for noninvasive monitoring of these in vivo events.",M1
19252455,"Interobserver reproducibility in reporting on renal <e>cortical</e> scintigraphy in children: a large collaborative study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the interobserver reproducibility in reporting on technetium-99m (99mTc) dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) scan in children. METHODS: Sixty 99mTc-DMSA scans, issued from three centres, were distributed by e-mail to nuclear medicine physicians from the five continents interested in paediatric nuclear medicine. Observers had to choose, for each kidney, among four answers: normal, abnormal, equivocal or poor quality. An additional question was the location of the lesion if any: upper part, mid part, lower part. The responses had to be returned by e-mail. RESULTS: Sixty-one observers, with an experience of approximately five or more 99mTc-DMSA/month, contributed to the study. Median agreement was 93%. The agreement was less than 80% in 29 kidneys (24%) but only in 13% (16 kidneys) was there disagreement between normality and abnormality, the remaining cases being related to 'equivocal' responses. Disagreement was mainly related to the following patterns: (i) normal variants: pear-shaped kidney, hypoactive poles contrasting with important parenchymal mass, triangular kidney, unusual shape of the columns of Bertin; (ii) congenital abnormalities: hydronephrosis, normal duplex kidney; (iii) small defects. CONCLUSION: Interobserver reproducibility can be considered as good among a wide number of observers from the five continents. Disagreement among observers could be reduced by taking the normal variants into account.",M1
19225053,"Direct action of aldosterone on bicarbonate reabsorption in in vivo <e>cortical</e> proximal tubule.The direct action of aldosterone (10(-12) M) on net bicarbonate reabsorption (J(HCO(3)(-))) was evaluated by stationary microperfusion of an in vivo middle proximal tubule (S2) of rat kidney, using H ion-sensitive microelectrodes. Aldosterone in luminally perfused tubules caused a significant increase in J(HCO(3)(-)) from a mean control value of 2.84 +/- 0.08 [49/19 (n degrees of measurements/n degrees of tubules)] to 4.20 +/- 0.15 nmol.cm(-2).s(-1) (58/10). Aldosterone perfused into peritubular capillaries also increased J(HCO(3)(-)), compared with basal levels during intact capillary perfusion with blood. In addition, in isolated perfused tubules aldosterone causes a transient increase of cytosolic free calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)), monitored fluorometrically. In the presence of ethanol (in similar concentration used to prepare the hormonal solution), spironolactone (10(-6) M, a mineralocorticoid receptor antagonist), actinomycin D (10(-6) M, an inhibitor of gene transcription), or cycloheximide (40 mM, an inhibitor of protein synthesis), the J(HCO(3)(-)) and the [Ca(2+)](i) were not different from the control value; these drugs also did not prevent the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on J(HCO(3)(-)) and on [Ca(2+)](i). However, in the presence of RU 486 alone [10(-6) M, a classic glucocorticoid receptor (GR) antagonist], a significant decrease on J(HCO(3)(-)) and on [Ca(2+)](i) was observed; this antagonist also inhibited the stimulatory effect of aldosterone on J(HCO(3)(-)) and on [Ca(2+)](i). These studies indicate that luminal or peritubular aldosterone (10(-12) M) has a direct nongenomic stimulatory effect on J(HCO(3)(-)) and on [Ca(2+)](i) in proximal tubule and that probably GR participates in this process. The data also indicate that endogenous aldosterone stimulates J(HCO(3)(-)) in middle proximal tubule.",M1
19205672,"Metabonomics studies of intact hepatic and renal <e>cortical</e> tissues from diabetic db/db mice using high-resolution magic-angle spinning 1H NMR spectroscopy.A metabonomics approach based on high-resolution magic-angle spinning (HRMAS) (1)H NMR spectroscopy was applied to investigate the metabolite composition in intact hepatic tissues and renal cortical tissues from db/db mice of 8 weeks old, an animal model of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Compared to the control group, the hepatic tissues of diabetic mice have elevated levels of triglyceride and bile acid and declined levels of trimethylamine-N-oxide, phosphocholine, glycerophosphocholine, and choline. The biochemical changes are less obvious in renal cortical tissues of diabetic mice. The WET_CPMG pulse sequence was selected for our metabonomics study after the quality and reproducibility of the spectra obtained from the NOEPR, NOEPR_CPMG, and WET_CPMG pulse sequences were analyzed together with principal component analysis. The influence of line-broadening factor of exponential window function for spectral manipulation on class separation was paid attention to for the first time, and an optimal value was obtained under our experimental conditions. These studies show the efficiency of HRMAS (1)H NMR spectroscopy for tissue metabonomics study in combination with multivariate statistical analysis, which may help to explore the etiological factor of diabetes mellitus from a new perspective.",M1
19193486,"Assessment of a new mathematical model for the computation of numerical parameters related to renal <e>cortical</e> blood flow and fractional blood volume by contrast-enhanced ultrasound.We analyzed the value of a new mathematical model for the quantification of renal cortical blood flow and fractional blood volume by contrast-enhanced ultrasound after the injection of sulfur hexafluoride-filled microbubbles. A vessel-mimicking phantom experiment was preliminarily performed which showed that the effect of microbubble diffusion is negligible compared with the effect of liquid drag. Twelve healthy volunteers (7 male, 5 female; 27 to 48 years [n = 6; group 1], and 61 to 80 years [n = 6; group 2], respectively), with normal renal and cardiac function and not undergoing any pharmacologic treatment, were examined. In each volunteer, both kidneys were scanned after intravenous injection of sulfur hexafluoride-filled microbubbles at a slow rate (4.8 mL at a flow of 4.0 mL/min), and the refill kinetics of the renal cortex after microbubble destruction was evaluated by echo-signal intensity quantification. The progressive replenishment of the renal vessels was approximated both by standard negative exponential function and by the piecewise linear function resulting from our mathematical model. A better dataset approximation was provided by piecewise linear versus standard negative exponential function (overall mean square error: 0.44 vs. 0.51; p &lt; 0.05, Wilcoxon test). The piecewise linear function provided a curve composed of four linear tracts (n = 3 volunteers; 2 from group 1 and 1 from group 2), three linear tracts (n = 6 volunteers; 3 from group 1 and 3 from group 2) or two linear tracts (n = 3 volunteers; 1 from group 1 and 2 from group 2). The piecewise linear function versus standard negative exponential function improved data approximation for the computation of numerical values related to renal cortical blood flow velocity and fractional blood volume.",M1
19172331,"Bilirubin levels predict renal <e>cortical</e> changes in jaundiced neonates with urinary tract infection.BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to determine the incidence of urinary tract infection (UTI) and the frequency of anatomical abnormalities in newborns with unexplained jaundice and to find out if there is any correlation between bilirubin level and renal damage. METHODS: We studied 462 full-term neonates for UTI. They were aged 3-25 days, with either high (&gt;10 mg/dL) or prolonged (&gt;10 days) hyperbilirubinemia, with or without manifestations such as fever, vomiting, diarrhea, poor feeding, lethargy, and irritability. Neonates positive for UTI were further investigated with ultrasound, cystourethrography, and acute phase renal scintigraphy with technetium-99m dimercaptosuccinate acid (DMSA). RESULTS: Thirty neonates (6.5%) were found to have UTI. Twenty-eight of them had indirect hyperbilirubinemia and two had direct hyperbilirubinemia, with total bilirubin levels of 11.8-20.1 mg/dL. None of the neonates was found to have jaundice because of other reasons such as infection. Vesicoureteral reflux was found in 5 neonates and one of them was combined with hydronephrosis. Renal scintigraphy with technetium-99m DMSA showed renal cortex changes in 14 (46.7%) of the 30 neonates with UTI. These 14 neonates also had increased levels of bilirubin in comparison to those with normal findings of DMSA. CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of UTI in uncomplicated neonatal jaundice is relatively high. Anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract are not rare in infected children. Increased bilirubin levels are related to pathological findings in renal scintigraphy.",M1
19165174,"Activation of A(2) adenosine receptors dilates <e>cortical</e> efferent arterioles in mouse.Adenosine can induce vasodilatation and vasoconstriction of the renal afferent arteriole of the mouse. We determined here its direct effect on efferent arterioles of mouse kidneys. Using isolated-perfused cortical efferent arterioles, we measured changes in luminal diameter in response to adenosine. Extraluminal application of adenosine and cyclohexyladenosine had no effect on the luminal diameter. When the vessels were constricted by the thromboxane mimetic U46619, application of adenosine and 5'-N-ethylcarboxamido-adenosine dilated the efferent arterioles in a dose-dependent manner. We also found that the adenosine-induced vasodilatation was inhibited by the A(2)-specific receptor blocker 3,7-dimethyl-1-propargylxanthine. In the presence of this inhibitor, adenosine failed to alter the basal vessel diameter of quiescent efferent arterioles. Using primer-specific polymerase chain reaction we found that the adenosine A(1), A(2a), A(2b), and A(3) receptors were expressed in microdissected mouse efferent arterioles. We conclude that adenosine dilates the efferent arteriole using the A(2) receptor subtype at concentrations compatible with activation of the A(2b) receptor.",M1
19161195,"Age dependence of T1 perfusion MRI-based hemodynamic parameters in human kidneys.PURPOSE: To determine the association between renal <e>cortical</e> perfusion parameters from T1-DCE magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and age in human kidney. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-five patients (mean age: 53 years, SD = 15 years) were imaged using inversion recovery (IR)-prepared FLASH (pulse repetition time [TR] = 4.4 msec, echo time [TE] 2.2 msec, inversion time [TI] = 180 msec, FA 50 degrees , matrix 128 x 256, 0.3 sec/slice) during the injection of Gadolinium-DTPA. Tissue concentration-time courses were deconvolved. Renal blood flow (RBF), volume of distribution (RVD), and mean transit time (MTT) were derived from the resulting impulse response function. RESULTS: Mean RBF, RVD, and MTT were 127 mL/min/100 mL (SD = 81 mL/min/100 mL), 40 mL/100 mL (SD 23 mL/100 mL), and 22 sec (SD = 9 sec). A significant moderately negative correlation was found between RBF and age (R = -0.447, P = 0.007), RVD and age (R = -0.420, P = 0.012). MTT and age did not show a significant correlation (R = 0.017, P = 0.924). Repeating this analysis for each gender revealed a moderate age dependence of RBF (R = -0.600 with P = 0.009) and RVD (R = -0.540 with P = 0.021) in the male group only. CONCLUSION: T1-DCE quantitative perfusion MRI was sufficiently sensitive to demonstrate a significant negative correlation of RBF and RVD with patient age. This was due to a moderate age dependence of these quantities in males that seems to be absent in females.",M1
19158353,"RAGE-induced cytosolic ROS promote mitochondrial superoxide generation in diabetes.Damaged mitochondria generate an excess of superoxide, which may mediate tissue injury in diabetes. We hypothesized that in diabetic nephropathy, advanced glycation end-products (AGEs) lead to increases in cytosolic reactive oxygen species (ROS), which facilitate the production of mitochondrial superoxide. In normoglycemic conditions, exposure of primary renal cells to AGEs, transient overexpression of the receptor for AGEs (RAGE) with an adenoviral vector, and infusion of AGEs to healthy rodents each induced renal cytosolic oxidative stress, which led to mitochondrial permeability transition and deficiency of mitochondrial complex I. Because of a lack of glucose-derived NADH, which is the substrate for complex I, these changes did not lead to excess production of mitochondrial superoxide; however, when we performed these experiments in hyperglycemic conditions in vitro or in diabetic rats, we observed significant generation of mitochondrial superoxide at the level of complex I, fueled by a sustained supply of NADH. Pharmacologic inhibition of AGE-RAGE-induced mitochondrial permeability transition in vitro abrogated production of mitochondrial superoxide; we observed a similar effect in vivo after inhibiting cytosolic ROS production with apocynin or lowering AGEs with alagebrium. Furthermore, RAGE deficiency prevented diabetes-induced increases in renal mitochondrial superoxide and renal <e>cortical</e> apoptosis in mice. Taken together, these studies suggest that AGE-RAGE-induced cytosolic ROS production facilitates mitochondrial superoxide production in hyperglycemic environments, providing further evidence of a role for the advanced glycation pathway in the development and progression of diabetic nephropathy.",M1
19122972,"Effects of lipids on ENaC activity in cultured mouse <e>cortical</e> collecting duct cells.Direct effects on epithelial Na+ channels (ENaC) activity by lipids, e.g., arachidonic acid (AA), eicosatetraynoic acid (ETYA), linoleic acid (LA), stearic acid (SA), hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid (HETE), 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET), (PGF2), and (PGE2), in cultured mouse cortical collecting duct (M1) cells were clarified by using single-channel recordings in this study. In a cell-attached recording, a bath application of 10 microM AA significantly reduced the ENaC open probability (NPo), whereas 10 microM ETYA or 5 microM LA only induced a slight inhibition. The inside-out recording as a standard protocol was thereafter performed to examine effects of these lipids on ENaC activity. Within 10 min after the formation of the inside-out configuration, the NPo of ENaC in cultured mouse cortical collecting duct (M1) cells remained relatively constant. Application of ETYA or LA or SA exhibited a similar inhibition on the channel NPo when applied to the extracellular side, suggesting that fatty acids could exert a nonspecific inhibition on ENaC activity. 11,12-EET, a metabolite of AA via the cytochrome P450 epoxygenase pathway, significantly inhibited the ENaC NPo, whereas 20-HETE, a metabolite of AA via the hydroxylase pathway, only caused a small inhibition of the ENaC NPo, to a similar degree as that seen with ETYA and LA. However, both PGE2 and PGF2alpha significantly enhanced the ENaC NPo. These results suggest that fatty acids exert a nonspecific effect on ENaC activity due to the interaction between the channel proximity and the lipid. The opposite effects of 11,12-EET and prostaglandin (PG) implicate different mechanisms in regulation of ENaC activity by activation of epoxygenase and cyclooxygenase.",M1
19114640,"Protective role of angiotensin II subtype 2 receptor in blood pressure increase in obese Zucker rats.Earlier, we reported that there was an increase in angiotensin II type 2 (AT(2)) receptor expression in the renal proximal tubule, and selective activation of the AT(2) receptor by AT(2) agonist inhibits Na,K-ATPase activity in the proximal tubules and increases urinary Na excretion in obese Zucker rats. We hypothesized that the AT(2) receptor has a protective role against blood pressure increase in obese Zucker rats. To test this hypothesis, we treated obese Zucker rats with the AT(2) receptor antagonist PD123319 (PD; 30 microg/kg per minute) using osmotic pumps. Age-matched lean rats and vehicle-treated obese Zucker rats served as controls. On day 15 of the treatment with PD, arterial blood pressure was measured by cannulation of the left carotid artery under anesthesia. Control obese rats exhibited higher mean arterial pressure (122.0+/-3.4 mm Hg) compared with lean control rats (97.0+/-4.8 mm Hg). The PD treatment of obese rats raised mean arterial pressure further by 13 mm Hg. The plasma renin activity was significantly increased in the PD-treated obese compared with control-obese or lean rats. Western blot analysis revealed that the PD treatment in obese rats caused an approximately 3-fold increase in the renin expression in the kidney cortex but had no effect on the expression of the <e>cortical</e> angiotensin II type 1 and AT(2) receptors. The present study suggests that the renal AT(2) receptors provide a protective role against blood pressure increase in obese Zucker rats, and this protective effect, in part, could be because of the ability of the AT(2) receptors to keep the kidney renin expression low in obese rats.",M1
19099149,"Reduced <e>cortical</e> renal GLUT1 expression induced by angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibition in diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats.Diabetes in spontaneously hypertensive rats is associated with cortical renal GLUT1 and GLUT2 overexpression. Our objective was to evaluate the effect of the angiotensin-converting enzyme blockade on cortical renal GLUT1 and GLUT2 expression, urinary albumin and urinary TGF-beta1. Streptozotocin, 50 mg/kg, or citrate buffer (N = 16) was administered as a single injection into the tail vein in adult spontaneously hypertensive rats (approximately 260 g). Thirty days later, these diabetic spontaneously hypertensive rats received ramipril by gavage: 0.01 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (D0.01, N = 14), 1 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) (D1, N = 9) or water (D, N = 11) for 15 days. Albumin and TGF-beta1 (24-h urine), direct arterial pressure, renal tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (fluorometric assay), and GLUT1 and GLUT2 protein levels (Western blot, renal cortex) were determined. Glycemia and glycosuria were higher (P &lt; 0.05) in the diabetic rats compared with controls, but similar between the diabetic groups. Diabetes in spontaneously hypertensive rats lowered renal tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme activity (40%), which was reduced further when higher ramipril doses were used. Diabetes associated with hypertension raised GLUT1 by 28% (P &lt; 0.0001) and GLUT2 by 76% (P = 0.01), and both doses of ramipril equally reduced cortical GLUT1 (D vs D1 and vs D0.01, P &lt; or = 0.001). GLUT2 levels were reduced in D0.01 (P &lt; 0.05 vs D). Diabetes increased urinary albumin and TGF-beta1 urinary excretion, but the 15-day ramipril treatment (with either dose) did not reduce them. In conclusion, ramipril is effective in lowering renal tissue angiotensin-converting enzyme activity, as well as blocking cortical GLUT1 overexpression, which may be beneficial in arresting the development of diabetic nephropathy.",M1
19092093,"Distribution of renal tumor growth rates determined by using serial volumetric CT measurements.PURPOSE: To retrospectively determine the distribution of growth rates across different sizes and subtypes of renal <e>cortical</e> tumors by assessing tumor volume and maximum tumor diameter at serial volumetric computed tomographic (CT) examinations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The institutional review board approved this retrospective, HIPAA-compliant study. Fifty-three of 2304 patients (34 men, 19 women; mean age, 67 years +/- 10 [standard deviation; range, 39-88 years) who underwent nephrectomy from 1989 to 2006 did not receive preoperative chemotherapy or radiation therapy and underwent at least two preoperative contrast material-enhanced CT examinations (at least 3 months apart) with identical section thickness that was no more than one-fifth of longitudinal tumor diameter. Tumor volume and maximum diameter were measured on CT scans. Reciprocal of doubling time (DT) (RDT) was calculated. Analysis of variance and Student t tests were performed. RESULTS: Thirty-two clear cell carcinomas, 10 papillary carcinomas, six chromophobe carcinomas, four oncocytomas, and one angiomyolipoma were analyzed. Median tumor size was 2.9 cm (range, 1-12 cm). Seven tumors did not increase in volume. DT ranged from -248 to 72 days (mean, 474 days; median, 811 days). Growth rate determined by using maximum diameter ranged from -10.8 to 33.2 mm/y (mean, 5.1 mm/y; median, 3.5 mm/y). Faster-growing tumors were more likely to be clear cell carcinomas, those of higher grade had higher growth rates. No significant correlation was found between RDT and tumor initial volume, subtype, or grade. Small renal tumors (&lt;or=3.5 cm) were similar to larger tumors in subtype and growth rate. Age at diagnosis correlated negatively with renal tumor growth rate (P = .03). CONCLUSION: Growth rates in renal tumors of different sizes, subtypes, and grades represent a wide range and overlap substantially. Small renal tumors appear to be similar to larger ones in nature.",M1

19073823,"Epoxyeicosatrienoic acid activates BK channels in the <e>cortical</e> collecting duct.The cortical collecting duct (CCD), which is involved in renal potassium (K) excretion, expresses cytochrome P450 (CYP)-epoxygenase. Here, we examined the effect of high dietary K on renal expression of CYP2C23 and CYP2J2 in the rat, as well as the role of CYP-epoxygenase-dependent metabolism of arachidonic acid in the regulation of Ca(2+)-activated big-conductance K (BK) channels. By Western blot analysis, high dietary K stimulated the expression of CYP2C23 but not CYP2J2 and increased 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (11,12-EET) levels in isolated rat CCD tubules. Application of arachidonic acid increased BK channel activity, and this occurred to a greater extent in rats on a high-K diet compared with a normal-K diet. This effect was unlikely due to arachidonic acid-induced changes in membrane fluidity, because 11,14,17-eicosatrienoic acid did not alter BK channel activity. Inhibiting CYP-epoxygenase but not cyclooxygenase- or CYP-omega-hydroxylase-dependent pathways completely abolished the stimulatory effect of arachidonic acid on BK channel activity. In addition, application of 11,12-EET mimicked the effect of arachidonic acid on BK channel activity, even in the presence of CYP-epoxygenase inhibition. This effect seemed specific to 11,12-EET, because both 8,9- and 14,15-EET failed to stimulate BK channels. Finally, inhibition of CYP-epoxygenase abolished iberiotoxin-sensitive and flow-stimulated but not basal net K secretion in isolated microperfused CCD. In conclusion, high dietary K stimulates the renal CYP-epoxygenase pathway, which plays an important role in activating BK channels and flow-stimulated K secretion in the CCD.",M1
19073653,"Splice variants of neuronal nitric oxide synthase are present in the rat kidney.BACKGROUND: Decreased renal <e>cortical</e> neuronal NO synthase (nNOS) abundance/activity correlates with progression of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in a number of animal models. METHODS: Western blotting with both N-terminal and C-terminal antibodies, immunoprecipitation, proteomics, RT-PCR and in situ hybridization were used to identify nNOS splice variants in the rat kidney. RESULTS: We have identified two nNOS proteins and transcripts in the rat kidney; nNOSalpha (approximately 160 kDa) and nNOSbeta (approximately 140 kDa), a catalytically active exon-2 deletion variant, lacking both the PDZ and protein inhibitor of nNOS (PIN) domains. We also report that nNOSbeta protein abundance is increased in the kidney at 11 weeks following 5/6th nephrectomy (5/6NX)-induced CKD while nNOSalpha protein abundance is diminished. The transcript data parallel the protein data in 5/6NX. By in situ hybridization, there is abundant nNOSalpha mRNA widely distributed throughout the normal kidney cortex, with very sparse nNOSbeta mRNA confined to a few proximal tubules. In a second injury model (6 weeks after 5/6 renal mass reduction by combined right kidney ablation and infarction of approximately 2/3 of the left kidney; 5/6 A/I), nNOSalpha mRNA almost disappears from the kidney cortex while nNOSbeta mRNA abundance increases in tubules and tubulo-interstitium. CONCLUSION: The renal cortical nNOSbeta protein is present in low abundance in the normal kidney and increases with injury, in an inverse pattern of change with the nNOSalpha.",M1
19073636,"Chronic NF-{kappa}B blockade reduces cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress and attenuates renal injury and hypertension in SHR.Nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) plays an important role in hypertensive renal injury; however, its roles in perpetuating mitochondrial oxidative stress and renal dysfunction remain unclear. In this study, we assessed the effects of chronic NF-kappaB blockade with pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate (PDTC) on renal dysfunction and mitochondrial redox status in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR). PDTC (150 mg.kg body wt(-1).day(-1)) or vehicle was administered orally to 8-wk-old SHR and their respective controls for 15 wk. Systolic blood pressure (SBP) was measured by tail-cuff plethysmography at the start of and at every third week throughout the study. After 15 wk of treatment, anesthetized rats underwent acute renal experiments to determine renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate using PAH and inulin clearance techniques, respectively. Following renal experiments, kidneys were excised from killed rats, and <e>cortical</e> mitochondria were isolated for reactive oxygen species (ROS) measurements using electron paramagnetic resonance. Tissue mRNA and protein levels of NF-kappaB and oxidative stress genes were determined using real-time PCR and immunofluorescence or Western blotting, respectively. PDTC treatment partially attenuated the increase in SBP (196.4 +/- 9.76 vs. 151.4 +/- 2.12; P &lt; 0.05) and normalized renal hemodynamic and excretory parameters and ATP production rates in SHR. PDTC treatment also attenuated the higher levels of cytosolic and mitochondrial ROS generation and tissue mRNA and protein expression levels of NF-kappaB and oxidative stress genes in SHR without any comparable responses in control rats. These findings suggest that NF-kappaB activation by ROS induces the cytosolic and mitochondrial oxidative stress and tissue injury that contribute to renal dysfunction observed in SHR.",M1
19060336,"A Wnt7b-dependent pathway regulates the orientation of epithelial cell division and establishes the cortico-medullary axis of the mammalian kidney.The mammalian kidney is organized into a cortex where primary filtration occurs, and a medullary region composed of elongated tubular epithelia where urine is concentrated. We show that the cortico-medullary axis of kidney organization and function is regulated by Wnt7b signaling. The future collecting duct network specifically expresses Wnt7b. In the absence of Wnt7b, <e>cortical</e> epithelial development is normal but the medullary zone fails to form and urine fails to be concentrated normally. The analysis of cell division planes in the collecting duct epithelium of the emerging medullary zone indicates a bias along the longitudinal axis of the epithelium. By contrast, in Wnt7b mutants, cell division planes in this population are biased along the radial axis, suggesting that Wnt7b-mediated regulation of the cell cleavage plane contributes to the establishment of a cortico-medullary axis. The removal of beta-catenin from the underlying Wnt-responsive interstitium phenocopies the medullary deficiency of Wnt7b mutants, suggesting a paracrine role for Wnt7b action through the canonical Wnt pathway. Wnt7b signaling is also essential for the coordinated growth of the loop of Henle, a medullary extension of the nephron that elongates in parallel to the collecting duct epithelium. These findings demonstrate that Wnt7b is a key regulator of the tissue architecture that establishes a functional physiologically active mammalian kidney.",M1

18971350,"Regional decreases in renal oxygenation during graded acute renal arterial stenosis: a case for renal ischemia.Ischemic nephropathy describes progressive renal failure, defined by significantly reduced glomerular filtration rate, and may be due to renal artery stenosis (RAS), a narrowing of the renal artery. It is unclear whether ischemia is present during RAS since a decrease in renal blood flow (RBF), O(2) delivery, and O(2) consumption occurs. The present study tests the hypothesis that despite proportional changes in whole kidney O(2) delivery and consumption, acute progressive RAS leads to decreases in regional renal tissue O(2). Unilateral acute RAS was induced in eight pigs with an extravascular cuff. RBF was measured with an ultrasound flow probe. <e>Cortical</e> and medullary tissue oxygen (P(t(O(2)))) of the stenotic kidney was measured continuously with sensors during baseline, three sequentially graded decreases in RBF, and recovery. O(2) consumption decreased proportionally to O(2) delivery during the graded stenosis (19 +/- 10.8, 48.2 +/- 9.1, 58.9 +/- 4.7 vs. 15.1 +/- 5, 35.4 +/- 3.5, 57 +/- 2.3%, respectively) while arterial venous O(2) differences were unchanged. Acute RAS produced a sharp reduction in O(2) efficiency for sodium reabsorption (P &lt; 0.01). Cortical (P(t(O(2)))) decreases are exceeded by medullary decreases during stenosis (34.8 +/- 1.3%). Decreases in tissue oxygenation, more pronounced in the medulla than the cortex, occur despite proportional reductions in O(2) delivery and consumption. This demonstrates for the first time that hypoxia is present in the early stages of RAS and suggests a role for hypoxia in the pathophysiology of this disease. Furthermore, the notion that arteriovenous shunting and increased stoichiometric energy requirements are potential contributors toward ensuing hypoxia with graded and progressive acute RAS cannot be excluded.",M1
18957817,"Effects of decreased renal <e>cortical</e> expression of G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 and angiotensin type 1 receptors in rats.Abnormalities in renal angiotensin type 1 receptor (AT1R), D1 dopamine receptor (D1R) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase 4 (GRK4) are present in polygenic hypertension. Selective renal reduction of AT1R expression by intrarenal cortical infusion of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides (As-Odns) in conscious, uninephrectomized, sodium-loaded rats decreases proteinuria, normalizes the glomerular sclerosis index (GSI), increases the sodium excretion (UNaV), and modestly increases blood pressure (BP) in spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHR) but not in normotensive Wistar-Kyoto rats (WKY). In contrast, selective renal reduction of GRK4 expression by infusion of GRK4 As-Odns increases UnaV, attenuates the increase in arterial BP with age, and modestly decreases protein excretion in SHR, but not in WKY. In this study, we report that intrarenal cortical infusion of both GRK4 and AT1R As-Odns decreased BP and increased UNaV in SHR; these effects were also noted in WKY to a lesser extent. Infusion of SHR with this combination of As-Odns resulted in a decrease in proteinuria and improvement of GSI similar to those by AT1R As-Odn only. In contrast to the increased circulating angiotensin II and aldosterone levels induced by AT1R As-Odn alone, the combination of As-Odns decreased both, contributing to greater natriuresis and amelioration of hypertension than by GRK4 or AT1R As-Odn only. Our results indicate an interaction between GRK4-regulated receptors and the renin-angiotensin system in the regulation of renal function and BP.",M1
18950917,"Immature renal structures associated with a novel UMOD sequence variant.Mutations of the UMOD gene, encoding uromodulin, have been associated with medullary cystic kidney disease 2, familial juvenile hyperuricemic nephropathy, and glomerulocystic kidney disease. We report on a 13-year-old boy presenting with chronic reduced kidney function, hyperuricemia, and impairment in urine-concentrating ability. His father was affected by an undefined nephropathy that required transplantation. The boy's renal ultrasonography showed reduced bilateral kidney volumes and <e>cortical</e> hyperechogenicity, with 2 tiny cysts in the left kidney. Renal biopsy showed up to 60% of glomeruli featuring an enlargement of Bowman space (glomerular cysts), with mild interstitial fibrosis (alpha-smooth muscle actin [alphaSMA] positive), inflammatory infiltrate, and focal tubular atrophy at the cortical level. At the corticomedullary junction, immature tubules (some dilated) with cytokeratin- and paired box gene 2 (PAX2)-positive immunostaining were seen, surrounded by vimentin-positive mesenchymal tissue. Unlike previously reported cases, no uromodulin-positive globular aggregates within the cytoplasm of tubular cells were observed. Uromodulin urinary excretion was absent. Genetic analysis showed a novel heterozygous sequence change in the UMOD gene (NM_003361.2:c.149G--&gt;C; p.Cys50Ser) involving the first epidermal growth factor-like domain of the protein in both the boy and his father.

18945827,"Acid loading in vivo and low pH in culture increase angiotensin receptor expression: enhanced ammoniagenic response to angiotensin II.The proximal tubule defends the body against acid challenges by enhancing its production and secretion of ammonia. Our previous studies demonstrated an enhanced ammoniagenic response of the proximal tubule to ANG II added to the lumen in vitro after an in vivo acid challenge. The present study examined the effect of NH(4)Cl acid loading in vivo on renal <e>cortical</e> type 1 ANG II (AT(1)) receptor expression, the effect of low pH on AT(1) receptor expression in a proximal tubule cells in culture, and their response to ANG II. A short-term (18 h) NH(4)Cl load in vivo resulted in increased renal cortical AT(1) receptor mRNA expression and increased brush-border membrane AT(1) receptor protein expression levels. Changing the cell culture pH from 7.4 to 7.0 for at least 2 h increased cell surface expression of AT(1) receptors and enhanced the stimulatory effect of ANG II on ammonia production rates. This increased ammoniagenic response to ANG II and the early enhancement of cell surface expression induced by exposure of the cultured proximal tubule cells to pH 7.0 were prevented by treatment with colchicine. These results suggest that, after acid challenges, the enhanced ammoniagenic response of the proximal tubule to ANG II is, in part, mediated by increased AT(1) receptor cell surface expression and that the enhancement of receptor expression plays an important role in the early response of the proximal tubule to acid challenges.",M1

METHODS: The primary cultured rat renal cortical myofibroblasts were divided into two groups, control group and sirolimus 40 mg/L group at each time point. The protein levels of alpha-SMA, Col-I, fibronectin(FN) were analyzed by Western blot in both the whole cell lysates and supernatant culture media 12 h , 24 h and 48 h after incubation, respectively. Real-time quantitative PCR was carried out to measure the levels of procollagen-I mRNA 1 h, 2 h, 4 h, and 6 h after cell incubation. The activities of gelatinase MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the supernatant from the cultured cell media were assayed by gelatin zymography. RESULTS: (1) Sirolimus had no effect on the expression of alpha-SMA of myofibroblasts at different time points. (2) The expression of Col-I in the whole cell lysates both reduced at the end of 24 h and 48 h in sirolimus group significantly [(0.58+/-0.05) and (0.63+/-0.18), P &lt; 0.05] compared with control group at each time point, respectively. (3) The levels of procollagen-I mRNA reduced significantly at the end of 1 h and 2 h compared with control group at each time point [(0.38+/-0.05) and (0.55+/-0.16), P &lt; 0.05], but increased to basic level at the end of 4 h. (4) The myofibroblasts had basic expression of Col-I early at the end of 12 h, its expression in supernatant culture medium reduced obviously both at 24 h and 48 h in sirolimus group compared with control group of each time point [(0.59+/-0.25) and (0.52+/-0.21), P &lt; 0.05]. (5) The expression of FN in the whole cell lysates had the same trend as that in supernatant culture medium, which reduced obviously at the end of 24 h in sirolimus group compared with control group at each time point [(0.44+/-0.09) and (0.40+/-0.15), P &lt; 0.05], but the inhibitive effect of sirolimus on FN disappeared at the end of 48 h. (6) The activities of MMP-2 and MMP-9 in the supernatant culture media were not significantly changed along with the experimental time points. CONCLUSION: Sirolimus may exert its anti-fibrotic effect through the inhibition of the expression of Col-I and/or FN in cultured renal cortical myofibroblasts.",M1
18922960,"NADPH oxidase contributes to renal damage and dysfunction in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertension.The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that NADPH oxidase contributes importantly to renal <e>cortical</e> oxidative stress and inflammation, as well as renal damage and dysfunction, and increases in arterial pressure. Fifty-four 7- to 8-wk-old Dahl salt-sensitive (S) or R/Rapp strain rats were maintained for 5 wk on a high sodium (8%) or high sodium + apocynin (1.5 mmol/l in drinking water). Arterial and venous catheters were implanted on day 21. By day 35 in the high-Na S rats, mRNA expression of renal cortical gp91phox, p22phox, p47phox, and p67phox NADPH subunits in S rats increased markedly, and treatment of high-Na S rats with the NADPH oxidase inhibitor apocynin resulted in significant decreases in mRNA expression of these NADPH oxidase subunits. At the same time, in apocynin-treated S rats 1) renal cortical GSH/GSSG ratio increased, 2) renal cortical O2(.-) release and NADPH oxidase activity decreased, and 3) renal glomerular and interstitial damage markedly fell. Apocynin also decreased renal cortical monocyte/macrophage infiltration, and apocynin, but not the xanthine oxidase inhibitor allopurinol, attenuated decreases in renal hemodynamics and lowered arterial pressure. These data suggest that NADPH oxidase plays an important role in causing renal cortical oxidative stress and inflammation, which lead to decreases in renal hemodynamics, renal cortical damage, and increases in arterial pressure.",M1
18840895,"Characterization of a novel model for investigation of radiocontrast nephrotoxicity.OBJECTIVES: Radiocontrast agents are one of the most common causes of acute renal failure in the world. These agents are required for both diagnostic and therapeutic modalities of medical intervention, including computed tomography (CT), angiography and cardiac catheterization. Publications over the past 40 years support three potential mechanisms of toxicity: oxidative stress, haemodynamics and hyperosmolar effects. An in vitro model provides a rapid evaluation of cellular toxicity without the complications of haemodynamics. This study evaluated the renal toxicity of radiocontrast agents at clinically relevant concentrations. METHODS: This study investigated the toxicity of two radiocontrast agents, diatrizoic acid (DA) and iothalamic acid (IA), using an in vitro model. Renal <e>cortical</e> slices isolated from F344 rats were incubated with 0-111 mg I/ml DA or IA. RESULTS: Renal slices exposed to DA and IA showed toxicity as measured by increased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) leakage at concentrations lower than previously published using isolated cell models. These data indicate that DA and IA are toxic to renal cortical slices, and this is a more sensitive model than previously used cell culture systems. DA and IA treatment failed to cause a significant decrease in total cellular glutathione or increase in percent glutathione disulphide (GSSG), implying that oxidative stress may not be an initial mechanism of toxicity. Finally, the addition of exogenous glutathione did provide complete protection from DA- and IA-induced LDH leakage. CONCLUSION: These data validate the renal cortical slice in vitro model for investigation of radiocontrast nephrotoxicity. These studies further showed that glutathione was cytoprotective. Future research using this model is aimed at further characterization of radiocontrast nephrotoxicity, which may allow for improved prevention and treatment of radiocontrast-induced acute renal failure.",M1
18828969,"Effect of baseline glomerular filtration rate on survival in patients undergoing partial or radical nephrectomy for renal <e>cortical</e> tumors.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of baseline renal function and comorbidity index on survival in patients with renal tumors. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We retrieved demographic, clinicopathologic, body mass index (BMI), and comorbidity data (assessed by Charlson-Romano index and hypertension) for 1479 patients who underwent partial or radical nephrectomy between January 4, 1995, and June 9, 2005, for localized renal tumors. We used the abbreviated Modified Diet and Renal Disease equation to estimate glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) using the last preoperative serum creatinine measurement. Body mass index and eGFR time trends were analyzed with linear regression. The effect of BMI, comorbidity, and baseline eGFR on disease-free and overall survival was studied using Cox regression controlling for pathologic stage, nodal status, and metastasis. RESULTS: Over a 10-year interval, median BMI increased from 27 (interquartile range [IQR], 24-31) to 28 (IQR, 25-31; P=.004), and median baseline eGFR decreased from 70 (IQR, 58-80) to 63 mL/min per 1.73 m(2) (IQR, 57-78; P&lt;.001). Multivariate regression demonstrated an association between year of surgery and baseline eGFR (P&lt;.001) even after adjusting for age, sex, comorbidity, BMI, and tumor size. We repeated the analysis for patients aged 18 to 70 years, and this association persisted (P&lt;.001). Baseline eGFR, BMI, and comorbidity were not associated with disease-free survival after controlling for stage. However, moderately reduced baseline eGFR (45-60 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) and severely reduced eGFR (&lt;45 mL/min per 1.73 m(2)) were significantly associated with overall survival (hazard ratio, 1.5; P&lt;.003; and hazard ratio, 2.8; P&lt;.001; respectively). CONCLUSION: Baseline eGFR has declined over the past decade. Nephron-sparing techniques should be considered for patients with severely diminished baseline eGFR.",M1
18827749,"Low-dose dexamethasone-supplemented fluid resuscitation reverses endotoxin-induced acute renal failure and prevents <e>cortical</e> microvascular hypoxia.There is growing evidence that impairment in intrarenal oxygenation and hypoxic injury might contribute to the pathogenesis of septic renal failure. An important molecule known to act on the renal microvascular tone and therefore consequently being involved in the regulation of intrarenal oxygen supply is NO. The main production of NO under septic conditions derives from iNOS, an enzyme that can be blocked by dexamethasone (DEX). In an animal model of endotoxin-induced renal failure, we tested the hypothesis that inhibition of iNOS by low-dose DEX would improve an impaired intrarenal oxygenation and kidney function. Twenty-two male Wistar rats received a 30-min intravenous infusion of LPS (2.5 mg/kg) and consecutively developed endotoxemic shock. Two hours later, in 12 animals, fluid resuscitation was initiated. Six rats did not receive resuscitation; four animals served as time control. In addition to the fluid, six animals received a bolus of low-dose DEX (0.1 mg/kg). In these animals, the renal iNOS mRNA expression was significantly suppressed 3 h later. Dexamethasone prevented the appearance of cortical microcirculatory hypoxic areas, improved renal oxygen delivery, and significantly restored oxygen consumption. Besides a significant increase in MAP and renal blood flow, DEX restored kidney function and tubular sodium reabsorption to baseline values. In conclusion, treatment with low-dose DEX in addition to fluid resuscitation reversed endotoxin-induced renal failure associated by an improvement in intrarenal microvascular oxygenation. Therefore, low-dose DEX might have potential application in the prevention of septic acute renal failure.",M1
18804801,"The role of vesicoureteral reflux in acute renal <e>cortical</e> scintigraphic lesion and ultimate scar formation.PURPOSE: We assessed whether differences exist in the rates of acute photon defect and scar formation using dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy according to the presence and grade of vesicoureteral reflux. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 389 patients with a first febrile urinary tract infection were enrolled. For all patients ultrasonography, dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy and voiding cystourethrography were performed. Dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy was performed within 5 days of and 6 months after diagnosis of urinary tract infection. Voiding cystourethrography was performed after the acute phase of urinary tract infection. The rates of acute photon defect and scar formation on dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy according to the presence and grade of vesicoureteral reflux were assessed. RESULTS: A total of 125 females and 264 males were included in the study. Of the patients 93 had refluxing urinary tract infection and 296 had nonrefluxing infection. The rate of acute photon defect (74.2% vs 32.1%, p = 0.0001) and the rate of ultimate scar change on followup dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy were significantly higher in patients with refluxing urinary tract infection (50% vs 18.3%, p = 0.0001). Positive linear association was noted between reflux grade and acute photon defect by linear association test (p = 0.002). No association was found between reflux grade and scar formation (p = 0.262). CONCLUSIONS: Although vesicoureteral reflux is not a prerequisite for development of acute photon defect and subsequent renal scarring, reflux itself might be an aggravating factor for acute photon defect and scar formation. There seems to be a correlation between reflux grade and frequency of acute photon defect on dimercapto-succinic acid scintigraphy but scar change occurs independently of reflux grade.",M1
18791409,"Diffusion tensor imaging of the kidney with parallel imaging: initial clinical experience.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the clinical feasibility of diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) of the kidney in volunteers and patients with renal diseases. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Ten volunteers and 22 patients (mean age, 56 +/- 14.3) with renal masses and renal artery stenosis underwent breath-hold coronal fat-saturated echo-planar DTI (as provided by the manufacturer, 6 diffusion directions, diffusion weightings b = 0 and 300 s/mm2, repetition time 730 ms/echo time 72 ms; 5 slices; slice thickness, 6 mm; inplane resolution, 2.1 x 2.1 mm2; acquisition time, 26 seconds) of the kidneys at 1.5 T (MAGNETOM Avanto, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany). The parallel imaging technique, generalized autocalibrating partially parallel acquisitions with an acceleration factor 2, was applied. Using the commercially available Syngo DTI task card software, regions of interests were placed in the cortex, medulla, and in renal masses if present. Fractional anisotropy (FA) and apparent diffusion coefficients (ADC) were determined, and tractography was used to visualize the renal diffusion properties. Statistical analysis was performed using the Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test and paired t tests. RESULTS: In all volunteers, FA was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in the medulla (0.36 +/- 0.03) than in the cortex (0.21 +/- 0.02), whereas the ADC was significantly (P &lt; 0.01) higher in the cortex (2.43 +/- 0.19) than in the medulla (2.16 +/- 0.22). Tractography typically revealed a radial preferred direction of medullary diffusion basically reflecting medullary flow.FA/ADC of simple renal cysts (n = 8) was 0.14 +/- 0.05/2.86 +/- 0.15. Renal cell carcinoma (n = 10) showed a wide FA range from 0.11 to 0.56. Using tractography, the structural organization of renal cell carcinoma such as pseudocapsules could be visualized.In 1 patient with unilateral high-grade renal artery stenosis, the <e>cortical</e> ADC of the affected kidney was lower than on the contralateral side (1.77/2.27) and the FA was increased (0.33/0.18). The FA of the medulla was increased (0.70/0.41) and the ADC decreased (1.43/1.90). CONCLUSIONS: Using parallel imaging, DTI measurements of the kidneys are feasible within a single breath-hold with good discrimination between cortex and medulla. Parallel imaging allows more slices and a superior resolution. DTI measurements of the kidney allows visualization of medullary flow, in pathology ADC and FA were altered. Further investigations will be required to evaluate the role of DTI for studying and monitoring renal ultrastructure.",M1
18790226,"Evaluation of <e>cortical</e> perfusion in renal transplants: application of quantified power Doppler ultrasonography.Perfusion of renal transplants may be altered by various pathological conditions. This study assessed cortical perfusion of renal transplants during acute rejection episodes using power Doppler quantification. Forty-eight renal transplant patients with clinical indications for biopsy were included in this study. Power Doppler ultrasonography (US) of these renal transplants was performed prior to biopsy. Power Doppler image intensity in the proximal outer cortex of renal transplants was quantified by image analysis software. The results of power Doppler quantification were compared with the clinical data and histological findings. Biopsies were classified into three groups based on Banff diagnostic categories: group 1 (no acute rejection; 26 patients), group 2 (acute cell-mediated rejection alone; 12 patients), and group 3 (acute antibody-mediated rejection with/or without acute cell-mediated rejection; 10 patients). The power Doppler intensity of the outer renal cortex was 1.98 +/- 1.50 dB for group 1, 1.38 +/- 0.86 dB for group 2, and 0.81 +/- 0.66 dB for group 3. Statistically, there was a significant difference between group 1 and group 3 (1.98 vs 0.81 dB, P = .01) but not between group 1 and group 2 (1.98 vs 1.38 dB, P = .34). In conclusion, the status of cortical perfusion of renal transplants can be determined noninvasively by quantified power Doppler US. Accordingly, acute antibody-mediated rejection is associated with significantly decreased cortical perfusion, which, we propose, is due to this distinct pathological process.",M1
18720770,"Qualitative and quantitative comparison of renal vs. hepatic ultrasonographic intensity in healthy dogs.A prospective, cross-sectional study was performed to qualitatively and quantitatively compare the echogenicity of the renal cortex relative to the liver in healthy dogs. Twenty-five normal adult dogs were examined ultrasonographically. Three standard B-mode images (8.0 MHz) and three tissue harmonic images of the cranial pole of the right kidney adjacent to the caudate lobe of the liver were obtained. Renal and hepatic echogenicities were qualitatively compared by two observers. Subsequently, regions of interest (ROIs) were drawn in the renal cortex and the adjacent liver parenchyma at equal depths on each image, using two different ROI geometries: deep adjacent half-annular ROIs centered at the focal zone and small superficial adjacent squares placed in the near field. Renal and hepatic mean pixel intensities were quantified and averaged for individual subjects. Qualitatively, the right renal cortex was more commonly hyperechoic to liver. Quantitatively, the renal <e>cortical</e> mean pixel intensity was significantly higher than that of liver using deep half-annular ROIs, but not superficial square ROIs, for both standard (P = 0.0007) and harmonic (P = 0.0107) tissue imaging. These findings suggest that the renal cortex can be slightly hyperechoic to adjacent liver. The framework within which the canine renal cortical parenchyma is routinely evaluated in abdominal ultrasonography should be reconsidered, and mild hyperechogenicity relative to the liver (at 8.0 MHz) interpreted as a normal finding.",M1
18715472,"Effects of early postnatal hyperglycaemia on renal cortex maturity, endothelial nitric oxide synthase expression and nephron deficit in mice.The influence of hyperglycaemia on nephrogenesis on Swiss mice pups treated with streptozotocin (STZ) (40 mg/kg, i.p.) was studied after birth, at 7 and 21 days. Kidneys were prepared for light microscopy, immunohistochemistry and stereology. In 7-day-old pups, both immature and mature glomeruli were evaluated separately. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) immunostaining were performed and quantified. At age 7 days, the immature-to-mature glomeruli ratio (IMGR) was significantly higher in the STZ group than in the control group. There was no difference in the number of glomeruli between the STZ and control groups; however, the number of glomeruli increased by more than 20% in the control group until 21 days of age, but not in the STZ group. STZ pups showed numerous PCNA-positive nuclei mainly in tubular cells, but not control pups. At 21 days, eNOS expression in the outer layer of glomerular endothelial nuclei was strong in control pups, but weaker in STZ pups. Treatment with STZ during the early neonatal period disturbs the normal nephrogenesis occurring at this stage of the rodent's life and causes retardation in renal <e>cortical</e> maturity, as indicated by the increase in both PCNA expression and IMGR, and reduction in eNOS expression.",M1
18710458,"Pathological tumour diameter predicts risk of conventional subtype in small renal <e>cortical</e> tumours.OBJECTIVE: To examine whether pathological tumour diameter assists in predicting conventional vs other histological subtypes in renal cortical tumours (RCTs) of &lt;or=4 cm diameter. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In all, 393 patients from Columbia University's Comprehensive Urologic Oncology Database who underwent radical or partial nephrectomy between 1988 and 2005 and had RCTs of &lt;or=4 cm were analysed. Logistic regression analysis using tumour diameter as a continuous variable was used to determine whether size predicted histological subtype. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated to estimate the likelihood of having conventional histology based on diameter. RESULTS: The median patient age at surgery was 64.3 years and median tumour diameter was 3 cm, In all, 256 (65.1%) of the RCTs were conventional subtype and 137 (34.9%) were nonconventional. Logistic regression analysis showed that for every 1 cm increase in diameter up to 4 cm, the RCT was 1.27 times more likely to be conventional (P = 0.020). The ORs showed that a 4-cm RCT was 2.06 times more likely to be conventional than tumours of 0.6-1.5 cm. CONCLUSION: There was a positive association between RCT diameter and the risk of having conventional renal cell carcinoma (RCC). Given that RCC histological subtype is a prognostic indicator for outcome, these findings may be applied in the selection of treatment options. Further studies investigating tumour size and other variables predictive of tumour histology will help clinicians better predict the RCC subtype.",M1
18679036,"Renal ACE and ACE2 expression in early diabetic rats.BACKGROUND/AIM: The role of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)-related carboxypeptidase-2 (ACE2) in the regulation of the renin-angiotensin system is not well characterized. This study investigated the changes in the expression of ACE and ACE2 in the kidney in early diabetic rats. METHODS: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were examined. The concentrations of angiotensin II in plasma, urine, and renal cortex were measured by radioimmunoassay. The mRNA expression of ACE, ACE2, angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AT1R), and Mas receptor (MasR) in glomeruli and cortex was assessed using real-time PCR. The glomerular and <e>cortical</e> expression of ACE and ACE2 was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: For renal cortical tissue, the angiotensin II level was more intensified in the 8-week diabetic rats. Immunohistochemical experiments showed that ACE was increased, but ACE2 was decreased in the glomeruli of 8-week diabetic rats, while both ACE and ACE2 in the tubules were increased. The AT1R mRNA in the glomeruli was decreased, while the MasR mRNA was increased in 2-week diabetic rats. CONCLUSION: The combined effects of increased ACE and decreased ACE2 in glomeruli may be associated with the activation of the renin-angiotensin system in early diabetic rats, which is known to increase proteinuria.",M1
18615336,"Quantitative renal <e>cortical</e> perfusion in human subjects with magnetic resonance imaging using iron-oxide nanoparticles: influence of T1 shortening.BACKGROUND: Using conventional contrast agents, the technique of quantitative perfusion by observing the transport of a bolus with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is limited to the brain due to extravascular leakage. PURPOSE: To perform quantitative perfusion measurements in humans with an intravascular contrast agent, and to estimate the influence of the T1 relaxivity of the contrast agent on the first-pass response. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Renal cortical perfusion was measured quantitatively in six patients with unilateral renal artery stenosis using a rapid gradient double-echo sequence in combination with an intravenous bolus injection of NC100150 Injection, an intravascular contrast agent based on iron-oxide nanoparticles. The influence of T1 relaxivity was measured by comparing perfusion results based on single- and double-echo data. RESULTS: The mean values of cortical blood flow, cortical blood volume, and mean transit time in the normal kidneys were measured to 339+/-60 ml/min/100 g, 41+/-8 ml/100 g, and 7.3+/-1.0 s, respectively, based on double-echo data. The corresponding results based on single-echo data, which are not compensated for the T1 relaxivity, were 254+/-47 ml/min/100 g, 27+/-3 ml/100 g, and 6+/-1.2 s, respectively. CONCLUSION: The use of a double-echo sequence enabled elimination of confounding T1 effects and consequent systematic underestimation of the perfusion.",M1
18586855,"Opposed effects of prostaglandin E2 on perfusion of rat renal cortex and medulla: interactions with the renin-angiotensin system.While prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) is an established renal vasodilator, studies of prostaglandin EP receptors suggest that it also has vasoconstrictor potential. Prostaglandin E(2) is much more abundant in the medulla than in the cortex, yet likely differences in effects between zones have not been defined. This study is focused on different vascular effects in the cortex and medulla and interaction with the renin-angiotensin system (RAS). In anaesthetized rats, the effects of cyclo-oxygenase blockade and of PGE(2) infused into the renal artery or renal interstitium were examined. Total renal blood flow was measured by ultrasonic renal artery probe, and local perfusion, separately, of the superficial cortex, outer- and inner medulla, as laser-Doppler fluxes. Indomethacin (5 mg kg(-1) i.v.) increased <e>cortical</e> perfusion (by approximately 10%) and decreased medullary perfusion (by approximately 20%). Renal artery infusion of PGE(2) (15-30 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) increased cortical and medullary perfusion only transiently. Previous inactivation of the RAS using losartan or captopril, and background infusion of exogenous angiotensin II, prevented the transient increase and enhanced the subsequent stable decrease in perfusion. Prostaglandin E(2) infused into the medullary interstitium (7-22 microg kg(-1) h(-1)) increased medullary perfusion by 13%, while cortical perfusion decreased by 6%. Misoprostol, an agonist of constrictor EP(3) receptors, decreased perfusion of the cortex and medulla, with both renal artery and medullary interstitial infusion. In conclusion, in rat renal cortex the dominating stable PGE(2) effect is vasoconstriction, most probably mediated by EP(3) receptors and unrelated to activation of the RAS. Prostaglandin E(2) applied to the cortical or medullary interstitium, a natural route for paracrine agents, induces medullary vasodilatation.",M1
18575881,"The renal <e>cortical</e> interstitium: morphological and functional aspects.The renal interstitial compartment, situated between basement membranes of epithelia and vessels, contains two contiguous cellular networks. One network is formed by interstitial fibroblasts, the second one by dendritic cells. Both are in intimate contact with each other. Fibroblasts are interconnected by junctions and connected to basement membranes of vessels and tubules by focal adhesions. Fibroblasts constitute the  skeleton  of the kidney. In the renal cortex, fibroblasts produce erythropoietin and are distinguished from other interstitial cells by their prominent F-actin cytoskeleton, abundance of rough endoplasmic reticulum, and by ecto-5'-nucleotidase expression in their plasma membrane. The resident dendritic cells belong to the mononuclear phagocyte system and fulfil a sentinel function. They are characterized by their expression of MHC class II and CD11c. The central situation of fibroblasts suggests that signals from tubules, vessels, and inflammatory cells converge in fibroblasts and elicit an integrated response. Following tubular damage and inflammatory signals fibroblasts proliferate, change to the myofibroblast phenotype and increase their collagen production, potentially resulting in renal fibrosis. The acquisition of a profibrotic phenotype by fibroblasts in renal diseases is generally considered a main causal event in the progression of chronic renal failure. However, it might also be seen as a repair process.",M1
18552482,"Stratification of sphingosine kinase-1 expression and activity in rat kidney.Sphingosine-1-phosphate, the product of sphingosine kinase (SK) activity, is a sphingolipid metabolite that regulates cell growth, survival and migration. It is also known to affect diuresis, natriuresis and renovascular contraction in rats, although the mechanisms through which it affects these processes are not known. No previous report has addressed the differences among the kidney zones regarding endogenous SK expression and activity. Therefore, we examined SK1 distribution and activity in the various kidney zones: cortex, medulla and papilla. We found that SK1 expression does not correlate with enzyme activity. Study of the expression showed that the enzyme is highly expressed in cortex, followed by medulla and papilla. However, medulla had the highest enzyme activity. In all kidney zones, SK1 expression was mainly cytosolic. Regarding enzyme activity, whereas we found no difference between cytosol, membrane and nucleus in renal medulla, the membrane-bound enzyme presented the highest activity in cortex and papilla. SK1 distribution observed by immunohistochemical staining showed higher expression in <e>cortical</e> proximal convoluted epithelial cells. In medulla, immunostaining was observed as patches of staining, whereas in papilla, positive immunostaining was exclusively restricted to collecting duct cells. We also evaluated the effects of bradykinin and angiotensin II on SK1 activity.",M1
18513275,"Quantitative assessment of renal <e>cortical</e> echogenicity in clinically normal cats.In this study, we assessed the renal cortical echogenicity of clinically normal adult cats by histogram analysis to obtain basic ultrasonographic data. Ultrasound images were taken under the following sets of conditions: (1) high contrast and low gain setting using a convex probe, (2) low contrast and high gain setting using a convex probe, (3) high contrast and low gain setting using a linear probe and (4) low contrast and high gain setting using a linear probe. Echogenicity of the region of interest (ROI) in the right and left renal cortices, liver and spleen was determined by histogram analysis; kidney/spleen (Kid/Sp) and kidney/liver (Kid/Liv) echogenicity ratios were calculated. Kid/Sp and Kid/Liv values varied among different ROI sites in the kidney when obtained using the convex probe, but were constant when obtained using the linear probe. Kid/Sp measured in the middle sites of the kidney showed similar values for the different settings; however, Kid/Liv differed between probes. The present findings suggest that determination of Kid/Sp using a linear probe is a feasible method for quantitative evaluation of renal cortical echogenicity in cats.",M1
18500612,"Urinary trypsin inhibitor ameliorates renal tissue oxygenation after ischemic reperfusion in rats.PURPOSE: In order to determine the mechanism of the protective effect of a urinary trypsin inhibitor (UTI) on renal ischemic reperfusion injury, we measured the tissue oxygen partial pressure pO2 in both the renal cortex and medulla in rats, using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) oximetry. METHODS: We allocated the rats to three groups: normal saline (NS) group, a UTI 50,000 U x kg(-1) (LD) group, and a UTI 150,000 U x kg(-1) (HD) group, with the normal saline and UTI being administered 30 min before ischemia. Renal ischemia was achieved by inflating the balloon of a vascular occluder that had been placed around the abdominal aorta just above the bifurcation of the renal artery. <e>Cortical</e> and medullary pO2 were measured every 10 min during ischemia (30 min) and reperfusion (60 min) by EPR oximetry; also, systemic cardiopulmonary parameters were measured. RESULTS: The pO2 in the cortex and medulla decreased to less than 2 mmHg during ischemia in all groups. At 60 min after reperfusion, the pO2 values in the NS group were not fully restored, whereas those in the LD and HD groups were completely restored to the pre-ischemic values. There were no significant differences between the HD and LD groups. There were no differences between any groups in cardiopulmonary parameters. CONCLUSION: Because UTI improved renal oxygenation after reperfusion without changing cardiopulmonary parameters, the pharmacological properties of UTI, such as its renal protection and anti-shock activity, may be explained in part, by this improvement in tissue oxygenation.",M1
18497704,"Nonresuscitated endotoxemia induces microcirculatory hypoxic areas in the renal cortex in the rat.The pathophysiology of acute renal failure (ARF) in sepsis is only partly understood. In several animal models of septic ARF, no profound tissue hypoxia or decrease in microcirculatory PO2 (microPO2) can be seen. We hypothesized that heterogeneity of microcirculatory oxygen supply to demand in the kidney is obscured when looking at the average microPO2 during endotoxemia. In 20 anesthetized and ventilated rats, MAP, renal blood flow (RBF), and creatinine clearance (CLcrea) were recorded. Renal microPO2 was measured by phosphorescence quenching, allowing measurement of microPO2 distributions. Five animals received a 1-h LPS infusion (10 mg kg h). In 5 rats, RBF was mechanically reduced to 2.1 +/- 0.2 mL min. Five animals served as time control. LPS infusion significantly reduced RBF to 2.1 +/- 0.2 mL min and induced anuria. Average <e>cortical</e> microPO2 decreased from 68 +/- 4 to 52 +/- 6 mmHg, with a significant left shift in the cortical oxygen histogram toward hypoxia. This shift could not be observed in animals receiving mechanical RBF reduction. In these animals, CLcrea was reduced to 50%. An additional group of rats (n = 5) received fluid resuscitation. In these animals, RBF was restored to baseline, CLcrea increased approximately 50%, and the cortical microcirculatory hypoxic areas disappeared after resuscitation. In conclusion, endotoxemia was associated with the occurrence of cortical microcirculatory hypoxic areas that are not detected in the average PO2 measurement, proving the hypothesis of our study. These observations suggest the involvement of hypoxia in the pathogenesis of endotoxemia-induced ARF.",M1
18451809,"Action of thiazide on renal interstitial calcium.BACKGROUND: Although thiazides increase urinary sodium excretion, they also decrease urinary calcium excretion. Recent studies in our laboratory have shown that increased dietary salt significantly reduces interstitial fluid calcium in Dahl salt-sensitive (DS) rats, and this was associated with a rise in blood pressure and increased urinary calcium excretion. Owing to the vasorelaxant actions of increased extracellular fluid calcium, we reasoned that the antihypertensive action of hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ), a commonly used thiazide, may be the result of increased interstitial fluid calcium as a consequence of decreased urinary calcium excretion. METHODS: To test this hypothesis, DS and Dahl salt-resistant (DR) rats were given high salt alone or in combination with HCTZ for 1 week. Renal <e>cortical</e> interstitial fluid calcium was determined by the zero net flux method. RESULTS: High salt decreased cortical interstitial fluid calcium (1.69 +/- 0.25 vs. 1.13 +/- 0.05 mmol/l; P &lt; 0.05) in DS rats as previously reported; thiazide treatment had no effect on the high salt interstitial fluid calcium response in salt-sensitive animals. However, thiazide decreased interstitial fluid calcium in DS on a normal salt diet. Cortical interstitial fluid calcium was unchanged by dietary salt in DR rats, and thiazide did not alter this interstitial fluid calcium response. CONCLUSION: We interpret these data to mean that (i) short-term thiazide treatment does not reduce blood pressure by restoring renal cortical interstitial fluid calcium concentration and (ii) a decrease in renal cortical interstitial fluid calcium may not contribute to the increased renal vasoconstriction seen in salt-sensitivity.",M1
18449170,"Histopathology and surgical anatomy of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and calcium phosphate stones.Using a combination of intra-operative digital photography and micro-biopsy we measured renal <e>cortical</e> and papillary changes in five patients with primary hyperparathyroidism and abundant calcium phosphate kidney stones. Major tissue changes were variable papillary flattening and retraction, dilation of the ducts of Bellini, and plugging with apatite deposits of the inner medullary collecting ducts and ducts of Bellini. Some of the papillae in two of the patients contained plentiful large interstitial deposits of Randall's plaque and where the deposits were most plentiful we found overgrowth of the attached stones. Hence, this disease combines features previously described in brushite stone formers--dilation, plugging of ducts and papillary deformity--with the interstitial plaque and stone overgrowth characteristic of routine idiopathic calcium oxalate stone formers, suggesting that these two patterns can coexist in a single patient.",M1
18441523,"Upregulation of rat renal <e>cortical</e> organic anion transporter (OAT1 and OAT3) expression in response to ischemia/reperfusion injury.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Renal organic anion transporters (OAT1 and OAT3) localized in the basolateral membrane mediate the uptake of organic anions from the blood into proximal tubules. This study aimed to examine the effects of renal ischemia/reperfusion injury (IRI) on the expression of cortical renal OAT1 and OAT3 and the functional impact. METHODS: Male rats underwent a right nephrectomy and clamping of the left renal pedicle for 50 min or sham operation, followed by reperfusion for 1, 2, 4 and 6 days. The expression of OAT1 and OAT3 was detected by RT-PCR, immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity was also estimated. RESULTS: The renal clearance of para-aminohippurate was significantly decreased on day 1 in IRI rats compared with sham-operated rats and returned to normal when the tubular injury recovered. There were significant increases in the mRNA and protein levels of OAT1 and OAT3 in renal cortex homogenates and basolateral membranes on day 1 after IRI, while on days 2 and 4 after IRI, the renal expression of OAT1 and OAT3 decreased gradually but was still significantly higher than that of the sham-operated rats. The Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase activity in renal cortex homogenates decreased significantly on day 1 after IRI but gradually increased on days 2, 4 and 6. CONCLUSIONS: Renal para-aminohippurate clearance was depressed in response to IRI; however, the expressions of renal cortex OAT1 and OAT3 were significantly elevated in the early stage of IRI which may have substantial impact on renal excretion of some drugs and toxic compounds.",M1
18441392,"Renal hyaluronan content during experimental uncontrolled diabetes in rats.With diabetes mellitus, the ability of the kidneys to maintain fluid balance is affected. Hyperglycaemia increases production of hyaluronan in cultured kidney cells implying that diabetes promotes induction of hyaluronan in the kidney. The aim of the present study was to determine if the interstitial matrix component hyaluronan is differently distributed within the kidney in diabetic rats compared to non-diabetic rats. Furthermore, to test if diabetic rats are able to respond with diuresis upon a hypotonic fluid load. The normal heterogeneous intrarenal distribution of hyaluronan was confirmed in non-diabetic control rats, with 60-fold more in the papilla than in the cortex. In diabetic animals, the <e>cortical</e> hyaluronan was unaffected but the papillary hyaluronan content was 3-fold higher than in non-diabetic rats. This increase correlated with a more than three-fold induction of the papillary hyaluronan-synthase 2 mRNA expression. In non-diabetic animals, 2 h water loading increased papillary hyaluronan (+93%) and diuresis (17-fold). In diabetic animals, baseline diuresis was 8-fold higher than in non-diabetic animals, which correlated with hyperglycaemia, glucosuria and proteinuria. Water loading in diabetic animals did not further increase papillary hyaluronan or diuresis: the urine flow rate decreased. To conclude, papillary hyaluronan is elevated in diabetic rats, which coincides with induction of hyaluronan-synthase 2 mRNA, hyperglycaemia, glucosuria, proteinuria and overt diuresis. The inability to respond to a water load with further diuresis may be related to the already elevated papillary hyaluronan and the inability to change hyaluronan during water loading.",M1
18441383,"Identification of a presynaptic cannabinoid CB1 receptor in the guinea-pig atrium and sequencing of the guinea-pig CB1 receptor.We studied whether cannabinoid CB(1) receptors occur on the sympathetic neurones innervating the guinea-pig atrium and renal cortex. Atrial and <e>cortical</e> kidney pieces preincubated with [(3)H]-noradrenaline were superfused and the electrically (3 Hz)-evoked tritium overflow was examined. The evoked overflow in atrium was inhibited by the cannabinoid agonist WIN 55,212-2 maximally by 35%; its concentration-response curve was shifted to the right by the CB(1) antagonist rimonabant (pA(2) 8.3), which, by itself, did not affect the evoked overflow. The evoked overflow in the renal cortex was not altered by WIN 55,212-2. The muscarinic agonist oxotremorine and prostaglandin E(2) inhibited the evoked overflow maximally by 55 and 65% in atrium and by 80 and 55% in kidney, respectively. Furthermore, the nucleotide sequence of the guinea-pig CB(1) receptor was determined (GenBank DQ355990). The deduced amino acid sequence has a high homology to the corresponding sequence of man (98.7%) and rat or mouse (99.2%). In conclusion, presynaptic CB(1) receptors leading to inhibition of noradrenaline release occur in guinea-pig atrium but not renal cortex. The deduced amino acid sequence of the guinea-pig CB(1) receptor shows a homology of 99% to the CB(1) receptor sequence of rodents and humans.",M1
18426992,"Collecting duct renin is upregulated in both kidneys of 2-kidney, 1-clip goldblatt hypertensive rats.Renin in collecting duct cells is upregulated in chronic angiotensin II-infused rats via angiotensin II type 1 receptors. To determine whether stimulation of collecting duct renin is a blood pressure-dependent effect; changes in collecting duct renin and associated parameters were assessed in both kidneys of 2-kidney, 1-clip Goldblatt hypertensive (2K1C) rats. Renal medullary tissues were used to avoid the contribution of renin from juxtaglomerular cells. Systolic blood pressure increased to 184+/-9 mm Hg in 2K1C rats (n=19) compared with sham rats (121+/-6 mm Hg; n=12). Although renin immunoreactivity markedly decreased in juxtaglomerular cells of nonclipped kidneys (NCK: 0.2+/-0.0 versus 1.0+/-0.0 relative ratio) and was augmented in clipped kidneys (CK: 1.7+/-1.0 versus 1.0+/-0.0 relative ratio), its immunoreactivity increased in <e>cortical</e> and medullary collecting ducts of both kidneys of 2K1C rats (CK: 2.8+/-1.0 cortex; 2.1+/-1.0 medulla; NCK: 4.6+/-2.0 cortex, 3.2+/-1.0 medulla versus 1.0+/-0.0 in sham kidneys). Renal medullary tissues of 2K1C rats showed greater levels of renin protein (CK: 1.4+/-0.2; NCK: 1.5+/-0.3), renin mRNA (CK: 5.8+/-2.0; NCK: 4.9+/-2.0), angiotensin I (CK: 120+/-18 pg/g; NCK: 129+/-13 pg/g versus sham: 67+/-6 pg/g), angiotensin II (CK: 150+/-32 pg/g; NCK: 123+/-21 pg/g versus sham: 91+/-12 pg/g; P&lt;0.05), and renin activity (CK: 8.6 microg of angiotensin I per microgram of protein; NCK: 8.3 microg of angiotensin I per microgram of protein; sham: 3.4 microg of angiotensin I per microgram of protein) than sham rats. These data indicate that enhanced collecting duct renin in 2K1C rats occurs independently of blood pressure. Upregulation of distal tubular renin helps to explain how sustained intrarenal angiotensin II formation occurs even during juxtaglomerular renin suppression, thus allowing maintained effects on tubular sodium reabsorption that contribute to the hypertension.",M1

Ablative renal procedures intend to duplicate the excellent oncologic outcomes of partial nephrectomy, while decreasing complications and shortening hospitalization time and convalescence. Only short and medium-term data are available, but ablation with cryotherapy or radiofrequency probes may achieve these goals. Ablation also offers the advantages of a minimally invasive surgical approach, with a significantly lower complication rate than partial nephrectomy. Ablated lesions are typically left in situ. Leaving potentially malignant tissues in place, albeit in a nonviable condition, certainly represents a major change in surgical thinking processes.

18417544,"Arachidonic acid inhibits basolateral K channels in the <e>cortical</e> collecting duct via cytochrome P-450 epoxygenase-dependent metabolic pathways.We used the patch-clamp technique to study the effect of arachidonic acid (AA) on basolateral 18-pS K channels in the principal cell of the cortical collecting duct (CCD) of the rat kidney. Application of AA inhibited the 18-pS K channels in a dose-dependent manner and 10 microM AA caused a maximal inhibition. The effect of AA on the 18-pS K channel was specific because application of 11,14,17-eicosatrienoic acid had no effect on channel activity. Also, the inhibitory effect of AA on the 18-pS K channels was abolished by blocking cytochrome P-450 (CYP) epoxygenase with N-methylsulfonyl-6-(propargyloxyphenyl)hexanamide (MS-PPOH) but was not affected by inhibiting CYP omega-hydroxylase or cyclooxygenase. The notion that the inhibitory effect of AA was mediated by CYP epoxygenase-dependent metabolites was further supported by the observation that application of 100 nM 11,12-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (EET) mimicked the effect of AA and inhibited the basolateral 18-pS K channels. In contrast, addition of either 5,6-, 8,9-, or 14,15-EET failed to inhibit the 18-pS K channels. Moreover, application of 11,12-EET was still able to inhibit the 18-pS K channels in the presence of MS-PPOH. This suggests that 11,12-EET is a mediator for the AA-induced inhibition of the 18-pS K channels. We conclude that AA inhibits basolateral 18-pS K channels by a CYP epoxygenase-dependent pathway and that 11,12-EET is a mediator for the effect of AA on basolateral K channels in the CCD.",M1

Significantly elevated levels of protein tyrosine-nitrated proteins, heat shock protein-27, and 8-hydroxyguanosine as a marker for RNA oxidation were found in the cerebral cortex of HE patients, but not of patients with cirrhosis but without HE. Glutamine synthetase (GS) activity was significantly decreased, whereas GS protein expression was not significantly affected. Protein expression of the glutamate/aspartate cotransporter was up-regulated in HE, whereas protein expression of neuronal and inducible nitric oxide synthases, manganese-dependent and copper/zinc-dependent superoxide dismutase, and glial glutamate transporter-1 were not significantly increased. CONCLUSION: These data indicate that HE in patients with cirrhosis is associated with oxidative/nitrosative stress, protein tyrosine nitration, and RNA oxidation, suggesting a role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of HE in patients with cirrhosis.",M2
20573911,"Actomyosin contraction at the cell rear drives nuclear translocation in migrating <e>cortical</e> interneurons.Neuronal migration is a complex process requiring the coordinated interaction of cytoskeletal components and regulated by calcium signaling among other factors. Migratory neurons are polarized cells in which the largest intracellular organelle, the nucleus, has to move repeatedly. Current views support a central role for pulling forces that drive nuclear movement. The participation of actomyosin driven forces acting at the nucleus rear has been suggested, however its precise contribution has not been directly addressed. By analyzing interneurons migrating in cortical slices of mouse brains, we have found that nucleokinesis is associated with a precise pattern of actin dynamics characterized by the initial formation of a cup-like actin structure at the rear nuclear pole. Time-lapse experiments show that progressive actomyosin contraction drives the nucleus forward. Nucleokinesis concludes with the complete contraction of the cup-like structure, resulting in an actin spot at the base of the retracting trailing process. Our results demonstrate that this actin remodeling requires a threshold calcium level provided by low-frequency spontaneous fast intracellular calcium transients. Microtubule stabilization with taxol treatment prevents actin remodeling and nucleokinesis, whereas cells with a collapsed microtubule cytoskeleton induced by nocodazole treatment, display nearly normal actin dynamics and nucleokinesis. In summary, the results presented here demonstrate that actomyosin forces acting at the rear side of the nucleus drives nucleokinesis in tangentially migrating interneurons in a process that requires calcium and a dynamic cytoskeleton of microtubules.",M2
20573893,"Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of delta-catenin regulates its localization and GluR2-mediated synaptic activity.Cyclin-dependent kinase 5 (Cdk5)-mediated phosphorylation plays an important role in proper synaptic function and transmission. Loss of Cdk5 activity results in abnormal development of the nervous system accompanied by massive disruptions in <e>cortical</e> migration and lamination, therefore impacting synaptic activity. The Cdk5 activator p35 associates with delta-catenin, the synaptic adherens junction protein that serves as part of the anchorage complex of AMPA receptor at the postsynaptic membrane. However, the implications of Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of delta-catenin have not been fully elucidated. Here we show that Cdk5-mediated phosphorylation of delta-catenin regulates its subcellular localization accompanied by changes in dendritic morphogenesis and synaptic activity. We identified two Cdk5 phosphorylation sites in mouse delta-catenin, serines 300 and 357, and report that loss of Cdk5 phosphorylation of delta-catenin increased its localization to the membrane. Furthermore, mutations of the serines 300 and 357 to alanines to mimic nonphosphorylated delta-catenin resulted in increased dendritic protrusions accompanied by increased AMPA receptor subunit GluR2 localization at the membrane. Consistent with these observations, loss of Cdk5 phosphorylation of delta-catenin increased the AMPA/NMDA ratio. This study reveals how Cdk5 phosphorylation of the synaptic mediator protein delta-catenin can alter its localization at the synapse to impact neuronal synaptic activity.",M2
20573887,"A reward-modulated hebbian learning rule can explain experimentally observed network reorganization in a brain control task.It has recently been shown in a brain-computer interface experiment that motor <e>cortical</e> neurons change their tuning properties selectively to compensate for errors induced by displaced decoding parameters. In particular, it was shown that the three-dimensional tuning curves of neurons whose decoding parameters were reassigned changed more than those of neurons whose decoding parameters had not been reassigned. In this article, we propose a simple learning rule that can reproduce this effect. Our learning rule uses Hebbian weight updates driven by a global reward signal and neuronal noise. In contrast to most previously proposed learning rules, this approach does not require extrinsic information to separate noise from signal. The learning rule is able to optimize the performance of a model system within biologically realistic periods of time under high noise levels. Furthermore, when the model parameters are matched to data recorded during the brain-computer interface learning experiments described above, the model produces learning effects strikingly similar to those found in the experiments.",M2
20558417,"Cholinergic imaging in corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia.Corticobasal syndrome, progressive supranuclear palsy and frontotemporal dementia are all part of a disease spectrum that includes common cognitive impairment and movement disorders. The aim of this study was to characterize brain cholinergic deficits in these disorders. We measured brain acetylcholinesterase activity by [11C] N-methylpiperidin-4-yl acetate and positron emission tomography in seven patients with corticobasal syndrome (67.6+/-5.9 years), 12 with progressive supranuclear palsy (68.5+/-4.1 years), eight with frontotemporal dementia (59.8+/-6.9 years) and 16 healthy controls (61.2+/-8.5 years). Two-tissue compartment three-parameter model and non-linear least squares analysis with arterial input function were performed. k3 value, an index of acetylcholinesterase activity, was calculated voxel-by-voxel in the brain of each subject. The k3 images in each disease group were compared with the control group by using Statistical Parametric Mapping 2. Volume of interest analysis was performed on spatially normalized k3 images. The corticobasal syndrome group showed decreased acetylcholinesterase activity (k3 values) in the paracentral region, frontal, parietal and occipital cortices (P&lt;0.05, cluster corrected). The group with progressive supranuclear palsy had reduced acetylcholinesterase activity in the paracentral region and thalamus (P&lt;0.05, cluster corrected). The frontotemporal dementia group showed no significant differences in acetylcholinesterase activity. Volume of interest analysis showed mean <e>cortical</e> acetylcholinesterase activity to be reduced by 17.5% in corticobasal syndrome (P&lt;0.001), 9.4% in progressive supranuclear palsy (P&lt;0.05) and 4.4% in frontotemporal dementia (non-significant), when compared with the control group. Thalamic acetylcholinesterase activity was reduced by 6.4% in corticobasal syndrome (non-significant), 24.0% in progressive supranuclear palsy (P&lt;0.03) and increased by 3.3% in frontotemporal dementia (non-significant). Both corticobasal syndrome and progressive supranuclear palsy showed brain cholinergic deficits, but their distribution differed somewhat. Significant brain cholinergic deficits were not seen in frontotemporal dementia, which may explain the unresponsiveness of this condition to cholinergic modulation therapy.",M2
20554885,"Neuroelectromagnetic correlates of perceptual closure processes.Perceptual closure refers to the coherent perception of an object under circumstances when the visual information is incomplete. Although the perceptual closure index observed in electroencephalography reflects that an object has been recognized, the full spatiotemporal dynamics of <e>cortical</e> source activity underlying perceptual closure processing remain unknown so far. To address this question, we recorded magnetoencephalographic activity in 15 subjects (11 females) during a visual closure task and performed beamforming over a sequence of successive short time windows to localize high-frequency gamma-band activity (60-100 Hz). Two-tone images of human faces (Mooney faces) were used to examine perceptual closure. Event-related fields exhibited a magnetic closure index between 250 and 325 ms. Time-frequency analyses revealed sustained high-frequency gamma-band activity associated with the processing of Mooney stimuli; closure-related gamma-band activity was observed between 200 and 300 ms over occipitotemporal channels. Time-resolved source reconstruction revealed an early (0-200 ms) coactivation of caudal inferior temporal gyrus (cITG) and regions in posterior parietal cortex (PPC). At the time of perceptual closure (200-400 ms), the activation in cITG extended to the fusiform gyrus, if a face was perceived. Our data provide the first electrophysiological evidence that perceptual closure for Mooney faces starts with an interaction between areas related to processing of three-dimensional structure from shading cues (cITG) and areas associated with the activation of long-term memory templates (PPC). Later, at the moment of perceptual closure, inferior temporal cortex areas specialized for the perceived object are activated, i.e., the fusiform gyrus related to face processing for Mooney stimuli.",M2
20548044,"Familial <e>cortical</e> myoclonic tremor with epilepsy: the third locus (FCMTE3) maps to 5p.BACKGROUND: Familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy (FCMTE) is defined by autosomal dominant adult-onset cortical myoclonus (CM) and seizures in 40% of patients. Two loci, 8q23.3-q24.11 (FAME1/FCMTE1) and 2p11.1-q12.2 (FAME2/FCMTE2), were previously reported without an identified gene. Unlinked families argue for a third mutated gene. METHODS: A genome-wide scan was performed in a large FCMTE family using Linkage-12 microarrays (Illumina). Refinement of the locus on 5p was performed by genotyping 13 polymorphic microsatellite markers in the 45 available family members. RESULTS: This large French FCMTE family included 16 affected relatives. The first symptoms were CM in 5 patients (31.2%), seizures in 5 patients (31.2%), and both at the same time in 6 patients (37.5%). A total of 12.5% (2/16) had only CM without seizures. The genome-wide scan identified a single region on 5p15.31-p15, with a multipoint lod score of 3.66. Further genotyping of all family members confirmed that the region spans 9.31 Mb between D5S580 and D5S2096, 2-point lod scores reaching 6.3 at theta = 0 for D5S486. Sequencing of the SEMA5A and CTNND2 genes failed to detect mutations. CONCLUSIONS: We report the clinical and genetic characteristics of a large familial cortical myoclonic tremor with epilepsy family. The third gene maps to 5p15.31-p15. Identification of the mutated gene is ongoing.",M2
20536943,"How spinalized rats can walk: biomechanics, cortex, and hindlimb muscle scaling--implications for rehabilitation.Neonatal spinalized (NST) rats can achieve autonomous weight-supported locomotion never seen after adult injury. Mechanisms that support function in NST rats include increased importance of <e>cortical</e> trunk control and altered biomechanical control strategies for stance and locomotion. Hindlimbs are isolated from perturbations in quiet stance and act in opposition to forelimbs in locomotion in NST rats. Control of roll and yaw of the hindlimbs is crucial in their locomotion. The biomechanics of the hind limbs of NST rats are also likely crucial. We present new data showing the whole leg musculature scales proportional to normal rat musculature in NST rats, regardless of function. This scaling is a prerequisite for the NST rats to most effectively use pattern generation mechanisms and motor patterns that are similar to those present in intact rats. Pattern generation may be built into the lumbar spinal cord by evolution and matched to the limb biomechanics, so preserved muscle scaling may be essential to the NST function observed.",M2
20536446,"Prothymosin alpha as robustness molecule against ischemic stress to brain and retina.Following stroke or traumatic damage, neuronal death via both necrosis and apoptosis causes loss of functions, including memory, sensory perception, and motor skills. As necrosis has the nature to expand, while apoptosis stops the cell death cascade in the brain, necrosis is considered to be a promising target for rapid treatment for stroke. We identified the nuclear protein, prothymosin alpha (ProTalpha) from the conditioned medium of serum-free culture of <e>cortical</e> neurons as a key protein-inhibiting necrosis. In the culture of cortical neurons in the serum-free condition without any supplements, ProTalpha inhibited the necrosis, but caused apoptosis. In the ischemic brain or retina, ProTalpha showed a potent inhibition of both necrosis and apoptosis. By use of anti-brain-derived neurotrophic factor or anti-erythropoietin IgG, we found that ProTalpha inhibits necrosis, but causes apoptosis, which is in turn inhibited by ProTalpha-induced neurotrophins under the condition of ischemia. From the experiment using anti-ProTalpha IgG or antisense oligonucleotide for ProTalpha, it was revealed that ProTalpha has a pathophysiological role in protecting neurons in stroke.",M2

The change of the firing rate was accompanied by a drop in the spike amplitude at the temperature below 27 and above 34 degrees C. Usually after cooling to 24 degrees C the spike amplitude fully restored when the temperature increased to 32-34 degrees C. The fall of spike amplitude at t &gt;35 degrees C could not be stopped by temperatyre decrease. The data obtained indicate the important role of the neuron membrane K+ permeability.",M2
20534523,"Alterations of <e>cortical</e> pyramidal neurons in mice lacking high-affinity nicotinic receptors.The neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are allosteric membrane proteins involved in multiple cognitive processes, including attention, learning, and memory. The most abundant form of heterooligomeric nAChRs in the brain contains the beta2- and alpha4- subunits and binds nicotinic agonists with high affinity. In the present study, we investigated in the mouse the consequences of the deletion of one of the nAChR components: the beta2-subunit (beta2(-/-)) on the microanatomy of cortical pyramidal cells. Using an intracellular injection method, complete basal dendritic arbors of 650 layer III pyramidal neurons were sampled from seven cortical fields, including primary sensory, motor, and associational areas, in both beta2(-/-) and WT animals. We observed that the pyramidal cell phenotype shows significant quantitative differences among different cortical areas in mutant and WT mice. In WT mice, the density of dendritic spines was rather similar in all cortical fields, except in the prelimbic/infralimbic cortex, where it was significantly higher. In the absence of the beta2-subunit, the most significant reduction in the density of spines took place in this high-order associational field. Our data suggest that the beta2-subunit is involved in the dendritic morphogenesis of pyramidal neurons and, in particular, in the circuits that contribute to the high-order functional connectivity of the cerebral cortex.",M2
20519520,"Reduced <e>cortical</e> BDNF expression and aberrant memory in Carf knock-out mice.Transcription factors are a key point of convergence between the cell-intrinsic and extracellular signals that guide synaptic development and brain plasticity. Calcium-response factor (CaRF) is a unique transcription factor first identified as a binding protein for a calcium-response element in the gene encoding brain-derived neurotrophic factor (Bdnf). We have now generated Carf knock-out (KO) mice to characterize the function of this factor in vivo. Intriguingly, Carf KO mice have selectively reduced expression of Bdnf exon IV-containing mRNA transcripts and BDNF protein in the cerebral cortex, whereas BDNF levels in the hippocampus and striatum remain unchanged, implicating CaRF as a brain region-selective regulator of BDNF expression. At the cellular level, Carf KO mice show altered expression of GABAergic proteins at striatal synapses, raising the possibility that CaRF may contribute to aspects of inhibitory synapse development. Carf KO mice show normal spatial learning in the Morris water maze and normal context-dependent fear conditioning. However they have an enhanced ability to find a new platform location on the first day of reversal training in the water maze and they extinguish conditioned fear more slowly than their wild-type littermates. Finally, Carf KO mice show normal short-term (STM) and long-term memory (LTM) in a novel object recognition task, but exhibit impairments during the remote memory phase of testing. Together, these data reveal novel roles for CaRF in the organization and/or function of neural circuits that underlie essential aspects of learning and memory.",M2
20513818,"Dementia with Lewy bodies and Alzheimer disease: neurodegenerative patterns characterized by DTI.OBJECTIVE: To identify the patterns of diffusivity changes in patients with dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) and Alzheimer disease (AD) and to determine whether diffusion tensor MRI (DTI) is complementary to structural MRI in depicting the tissue abnormalities characteristic of DLB and AD. METHODS: We studied clinically diagnosed age-, gender-, and education-matched subjects with DLB (n = 30), subjects with AD (n = 30), and cognitively normal (CN) subjects (n = 60) in a case-control study. DTI was performed at 3T with a fluid-attenuated inversion recovery-based DTI sequence that enabled <e>cortical</e> diffusion measurements. Mean diffusivity (MD) and gray matter (GM) density were measured from segmented cortical regions. Tract-based diffusivity was measured using color-coded fractional anisotropy (FA) maps. RESULTS: Patients with DLB were characterized by elevated MD in the amygdala and decreased FA in the inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). ILF diffusivity was associated with the presence of visual hallucinations (p = 0.007), and amygdala diffusivity was associated with Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (r = 0.50; p = 0.005) in DLB. In contrast, patients with AD were characterized by elevated MD in the medial temporal, temporal, and parietal lobe association cortices and decreased FA in the fornix, cingulum, and ILF. Amygdala diffusivity was complementary to GM density in discriminating DLB from CN; hippocampal and parahippocampal diffusivity was complementary to GM density in discriminating AD from CN. CONCLUSION: Increased amygdalar diffusivity in the absence of tissue loss in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB) may be related to microvacuolation, a common pathology associated with Lewy body disease in the amygdala. Diffusivity measurements were complementary to structural MRI, demonstrating that measures of diffusivity on diffusion tensor MRI are valuable tools for characterizing the tissue abnormalities characteristic of Alzheimer disease and DLB.",M2
20513813,"<e>Cortical</e> thickness analysis in temporal lobe epilepsy: reproducibility and relation to outcome.OBJECTIVE: To assess the reproducibility of neocortical atrophy and its clinical significance across the spectrum of temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), in particular with respect to postsurgical outcome. METHODS: MRI-based cortical thickness measurement was obtained in 105 patients. A total of 58 had hippocampal atrophy on magnetic resonance volumetry (TLE-HA) and 47 had normal hippocampal volumes (TLE-NV). Twenty-seven patients had repeated scans with a mean interval of 28 months. Patients were compared to 48 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. We used linear models to assess cortical thinning and the effect of seizure control after surgery. Reproducibility of finding cortical atrophy was statistically evaluated using bootstrap simulations. RESULTS: Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses revealed highly similar topology and rates of neocortical thinning in both TLE groups, predominantly in frontocentral, temporal, and cingulate regions. Bootstrap methods showed that at least 20 subjects per group were necessary to reliably observe these patterns of atrophy in TLE. Moreover, power analysis showed that even with sample sizes of 80 subjects per group, differences in thickness between TLE-HA and TLE-NV would be marginal. With respect to postsurgical outcome, we found an association between residual seizures and atrophy in temporopolar and insular cortices in TLE-HA, and in the posterior quadrant in TLE-NV. CONCLUSION: We demonstrated with a high degree of confidence that static and dynamic effects of epilepsy impact similarly the neocortex of patients with hippocampal atrophy and patients with normal hippocampal volumes. On the contrary, areas predicting unfavorable postsurgical outcome were distinct, suggesting different configurations of epileptogenic networks in these 2 groups.",M2
20511283,"Heterogeneous neuronal firing patterns during interictal epileptiform discharges in the human cortex.Epileptic cortex is characterized by paroxysmal electrical discharges. Analysis of these interictal discharges typically manifests as spike-wave complexes on electroencephalography, and plays a critical role in diagnosing and treating epilepsy. Despite their fundamental importance, little is known about the neurophysiological mechanisms generating these events in human focal epilepsy. Using three different systems of microelectrodes, we recorded local field potentials and single-unit action potentials during interictal discharges in patients with medically intractable focal epilepsy undergoing diagnostic workup for localization of seizure foci. We studied 336 single units in 20 patients. Ten different <e>cortical</e> areas and the hippocampus, including regions both inside and outside the seizure focus, were sampled. In three of these patients, high density microelectrode arrays simultaneously recorded between 43 and 166 single units from a small (4 mm x 4 mm) patch of cortex. We examined how the firing rates of individual neurons changed during interictal discharges by determining whether the firing rate during the event was the same, above or below a median baseline firing rate estimated from interictal discharge-free periods (Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis, P&lt;0.05). Only 48% of the recorded units showed such a modulation in firing rate within 500 ms of the discharge. Units modulated during the discharge exhibited significantly higher baseline firing and bursting rates than unmodulated units. As expected, many units (27% of the modulated population) showed an increase in firing rate during the fast segment of the discharge (+ or - 35 ms from the peak of the discharge), while 50% showed a decrease during the slow wave. Notably, in direct contrast to predictions based on models of a pure paroxysmal depolarizing shift, 7.7% of modulated units recorded in or near the seizure focus showed a decrease in activity well ahead (0-300 ms) of the discharge onset, while 12.2% of units increased in activity in this period. No such pre-discharge changes were seen in regions well outside the seizure focus. In many recordings there was also a decrease in broadband field potential activity during this same pre-discharge period. The different patterns of interictal discharge-modulated firing were classified into more than 15 different categories. This heterogeneity in single unit activity was present within small cortical regions as well as inside and outside the seizure onset zone, suggesting that interictal epileptiform activity in patients with epilepsy is not a simple paroxysm of hypersynchronous excitatory activity, but rather represents an interplay of multiple distinct neuronal types within complex neuronal networks.",M2
20510860,"Strong CA2 pyramidal neuron synapses define a powerful disynaptic cortico-hippocampal loop.Neurons propagate information through circuits by integrating thousands of synaptic inputs to generate an action potential output. Inputs from different origins are often targeted to distinct regions of a neuron's dendritic tree, with synapses on more distal dendrites normally having a weaker influence on cellular output compared to synapses on more proximal dendrites. Here, we report that hippocampal CA2 pyramidal neurons, whose function has remained obscure for 75 years, have a reversed synaptic strength rule. Thus, CA2 neurons are strongly excited by their distal dendritic inputs from entorhinal cortex but only weakly activated by their more proximal dendritic inputs from hippocampal CA3 neurons. CA2 neurons in turn make strong excitatory synaptic contacts with CA1 neurons. In this manner, CA2 neurons form the nexus of a highly plastic disynaptic circuit linking the <e>cortical</e> input to the hippocampus to its CA1 neuronal output. This circuit is likely to mediate key aspects of hippocampal-dependent spatial memory.",M2
20505096,"Diversity of lysophosphatidic acid receptor-mediated intracellular calcium signaling in early <e>cortical</e> neurogenesis.Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) is a membrane-derived lysophospholipid that can induce pleomorphic effects in neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from the cerebral cortex, including alterations in ionic conductance. LPA-induced, calcium-mediated conductance changes have been reported; however, the underlying molecular mechanisms have not been determined. We show here that activation of specific cognate receptors accounts for nearly all intracellular calcium responses evoked by LPA in acutely cultured nestin-positive NPCs from the developing mouse cerebral cortex. Fast-onset changes in intracellular calcium levels required release from thapsigargin-sensitive stores by a pertussis toxin-insensitive mechanism. The influx of extracellular calcium through Cd(2+)/Ni(2+)-insensitive influx pathways, approximately one-half of which were Gd(3+) sensitive, contributed to the temporal diversity of responses. Quantitative reverse transcription-PCR revealed the presence of all five known LPA receptors in primary NPCs, with prominent expression of LPA(1), LPA(2), and LPA(4). Combined genetic and pharmacological studies indicated that NPC responses were mediated by LPA(1) (approximately 30% of the cells), LPA(2) (approximately 30%), a combination of receptors on single cells (approximately 30%), and non-LPA(1,2,3) pathways (approximately 10%). LPA responsivity was significantly reduced in more differentiated TuJ1(+) cells within cultures. Calcium transients in a large proportion of LPA-responsive NPCs were also initiated by the closely related signaling lipid S1P (sphingosine-1-phosphate). These data demonstrate for the first time the involvement of LPA receptors in mediating surprisingly diverse NPC calcium responses involving multiple receptor subtypes that function within a single cell. Compared with other known factors, lysophospholipids represent the major activator of calcium signaling identified within NPCs at this early stage in corticogenesis.",M2

We propose that the adult brain utilizes DNA methylation to preserve long-lasting memories.",M2
20493856,"The scaffold protein JIP3 functions as a downstream effector of the small GTPase ARF6 to regulate neurite morphogenesis of <e>cortical</e> neurons.The small GTPase ADP-ribosylation factor 6 (ARF6) plays crucial roles in a wide variety of cell functions. To better understand the molecular mechanisms of ARF6-mediated signaling and cellular functions, we sought new ARF6-binding proteins in the mouse brain. We identified the signaling scaffold protein JNK-interacting protein 3 (JIP3), which is exclusively expressed in neurons, as a downstream effector of ARF6. Overexpression of a unique dominant negative mutant of ARF6, which was unable to interact with JIP3, and knockdown of JIP3 in mouse cortical neurons stimulated the elongation and branching of neurites. These results provide evidence that ARF6/JIP3 signaling regulates neurite morphogenesis.",M2

The study was conducted with a functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (1.5 T Magnetom Vision - Siemens Medical, Germany) using a head coil. The results showed that the most frequently activated areas were Brodmann's areas four and six in the primary motor and premotor cortex, the insula and Broca's area and, overall, showed greater activity of the cortical mastication area (CMA) in the right hemisphere for right-handed and in the left hemisphere for left-handed subjects.",M2
20484649,"Connexin 43 mediates the tangential to radial migratory switch in ventrally derived <e>cortical</e> interneurons.The adult cerebral cortex is composed of excitatory and inhibitory neurons that arise from progenitor cells in disparate proliferative regions in the developing brain and follow different migratory paths. Excitatory pyramidal neurons originate near the ventricle and migrate radially to their position in the cortical plate along radial glial fibers. On the other hand, inhibitory interneurons arise in the ventral telencephalon and migrate tangentially to enter the developing cortex before migrating radially to reach their correct laminar position. Gap junction adhesion has been shown to play an important mechanistic role in the radial migration of excitatory neurons. We asked whether a similar mechanism governs the tangential or radial migration of inhibitory interneurons. Using short hairpin RNA knockdown of Connexin 43 (Cx43) and Cx26 together with rescue experiments, we found that gap junctions are dispensable for the tangential migration of interneurons, but that Cx43 plays a role in the switch from tangential to radial migration that allows interneurons to enter the cortical plate and find their correct laminar position. Moreover this action is dependent on the adhesive properties and the C terminus of Cx43 but not the Cx43 channel. Thus, the radial phase of interneuron migration resembles that of excitatory neuron migration in terms of dependence on Cx43 adhesion. Furthermore, gap junctions between migrating interneurons and radial processes were observed by electron microscopy. These findings provide mechanistic and structural support for a gap junction-mediated interaction between migrating interneurons and radial glia during the switch from tangential to radial migration.",M2
20484634,"Postnatal switch from synaptic to extrasynaptic transmission between interneurons and NG2 cells.NG2 cells, oligodendrocyte precursors, play a critical role in myelination during postnatal brain maturation, but a pool of these precursors is maintained in the adult and recruited to lesions in demyelinating diseases. NG2 cells in immature animals have recently been shown to receive synaptic inputs from neurons, and these have been assumed to persist in the adult. Here, we investigated the GABAergic synaptic activity of NG2 cells in acute slices of the barrel cortex of NG2-DsRed transgenic mice during the first postnatal month, which corresponds to the period of active myelination in the neocortex. Our data demonstrated that the frequency of spontaneous and miniature GABAergic synaptic activity of <e>cortical</e> NG2 cells dramatically decreases after the second postnatal week, indicating a decrease in the number of synaptic inputs onto NG2 cells during development. However, NG2 cells still receive GABAergic inputs from interneurons in the adult cortex. These inputs do not rely on the presence of functional synapses but involve a form of GABA spillover. This GABA volume transmission allows interneurons to induce phasic responses in target NG2 cells through the activation of extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptors. Hence, after development is complete, volume transmission allows NG2 cells to integrate neuronal activity patterns at frequencies occurring during in vivo sensory stimulation.",M2
20483717,"Decreased cerebral <e>cortical</e> serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users: a positron emission tomography/[(11)C]DASB and structural brain imaging study.Animal data indicate that the recreational drug ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) can damage brain serotonin neurons. However, human neuroimaging measurements of serotonin transporter binding, a serotonin neuron marker, remain contradictory, especially regarding brain areas affected; and the possibility that structural brain differences might account for serotonin transporter binding changes has not been explored. We measured brain serotonin transporter binding using [(11)C] N,N-dimethyl-2-(2-amino-4-cyanophenylthio) benzylamine in 50 control subjects and in 49 chronic (mean 4 years) ecstasy users (typically one to two tablets bi-monthly) withdrawn from the drug (mean 45 days). A magnetic resonance image for positron emission tomography image co-registration and structural analyses was acquired. Hair toxicology confirmed group allocation but also indicated use of other psychoactive drugs in most users. Serotonin transporter binding in ecstasy users was significantly decreased throughout all cerebral cortices (range -19 to -46%) and hippocampus (-21%) and related to the extent of drug use (years, maximum dose), but was normal in basal ganglia and midbrain. Substantial overlap was observed between control and user values except for insular cortex, in which 51% of ecstasy user values fell below the lower limit of the control range. Voxel-based analyses confirmed a caudorostral gradient of cortical serotonin transporter binding loss with occipital cortex most severely affected. Magnetic resonance image measurement revealed no overall regional volume differences between groups; however, a slight left-hemispheric biased cortical thinning was detected in methamphetamine-using ecstasy users. The serotonin transporter binding loss was not related to structural changes or partial volume effect, use of other stimulant drugs, blood testosterone or oestradiol levels, major serotonin transporter gene promoter polymorphisms, gender, psychiatric status, or self-reported hyperthermia or tolerance. The ecstasy group, although 'grossly behaviourally normal', reported subnormal mood and demonstrated generally modest deficits on some tests of attention, executive function and memory, with the latter associated with serotonin transporter decrease. Our findings suggest that the 'typical'/low dose (one to two tablets/session) chronic ecstasy-polydrug user might display a highly selective mild to marked loss of serotonin transporter in cerebral cortex/hippocampus in the range of that observed in Parkinson's disease, which is not gender-specific or completely accounted for by structural brain changes, recent use of other drugs (as assessed by hair analyses) or other potential confounds that we could address. The striking sparing of serotonin transporter-rich striatum (although possibly affected in 'heavier' users) suggests that serotonergic neurons innervating cerebral cortex are more susceptible, for unknown reasons, to ecstasy than those innervating subcortical regions and that behavioural problems in some ecstasy users during abstinence might be related to serotonin transporter changes limited to cortical regions.",M2
20479234,"Apolipoprotein E (APOE) genotype has dissociable effects on memory and attentional-executive network function in Alzheimer's disease.The epsilon4 allele of the apolipoprotein E (APOE) gene is the major genetic risk factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD), but limited work has suggested that APOE genotype may modulate disease phenotype. Carriers of the epsilon4 allele have been reported to have greater medial temporal lobe (MTL) pathology and poorer memory than noncarriers. Less attention has focused on whether there are domains of cognition and neuroanatomical regions more affected in noncarriers. Further, a major potential confound of prior in vivo studies is the possibility of different rates of clinical misdiagnosis for carriers vs. noncarriers. We compared phenotypic differences in cognition and topography of regional <e>cortical</e> atrophy of epsilon4 carriers (n = 67) vs. noncarriers (n = 24) with mild AD from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative, restricted to those with a cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) molecular profile consistent with AD. Between-group comparisons were made for psychometric tests and morphometric measures of cortical thickness and hippocampal volume. Carriers displayed significantly greater impairment on measures of memory retention, whereas noncarriers were more impaired on tests of working memory, executive control, and lexical access. Consistent with this cognitive dissociation, carriers exhibited greater MTL atrophy, whereas noncarriers had greater frontoparietal atrophy. Performance deficits in particular cognitive domains were associated with disproportionate regional brain atrophy within nodes of cortical networks thought to subserve these cognitive processes. These convergent cognitive and neuroanatomic findings in individuals with a CSF molecular profile consistent with AD support the hypothesis that APOE genotype modulates the clinical phenotype of AD through influence on specific large-scale brain networks.",M2
20469591,"[Influence of the working memory load on the spatial synchronization of prestimulus <e>cortical</e> electrical activity during recognition of facial expression]The effect of increased working memory load (introduction of additional cognitive task into the context) was studied in adult healthy subjects (n = 35, 16 men, 19 women) in experiments with cognitive set. The EEG coherence in the frequency bands theta (4-7 Hz) and alpha (8-13 Hz), as well as alphal (8-10 Hz) and alpha2 (11-13 Hz) was analyzed and compared to the control data obtained in the experiments without additional memory load. Additional memory load was accompanied by an increase in the rigidity of the set to facial expression and substantial change in the pattern of the spatial synchronization of cortical potentials: coherence of potentials in the theta bands increased between the left and right frontal areas and between the frontal and temporal areas. A hypothesis is suggested that the rigidity of the set to emotionally negative facial expression is associated with the activation of the cortico-hippocampal system, which is justified by a substantial increase in coherence in the theta band in the frontal area known as the key structure in the functioning of cognitive sets. Loading the working memory is associated also with substantial weakening of the spatial synchronization of the low-frequency alpha rhythm, which presumably reflects the increase in the role of the fronto-thalamic system of selective attention in the process of recognition due to redistribution of attention induced by the additional cognitive task included in the context of current activity of a subject.",M2

METHODS: Using speech and sinusoidal stimuli in the active (attend) and the passive (ignore) recording condition, cortical activity of ten aphasic stroke patients and ten control subjects was recorded with whole-head MEG and behavioral measurements. RESULTS: Stroke patients exhibited significantly diminished neuromagnetic transient responses for both sinusoidal and speech stimulation when compared to the control subjects. The attention-related increase of response amplitude was slightly more pronounced in the control subjects than in the stroke patients but this difference did not reach statistical significance. CONCLUSIONS: Left-hemispheric ischemic stroke impairs the processing of sinusoidal and speech sounds. This deficit seems to depend on the severity and location of stroke. SIGNIFICANCE: Directly observable, non-invasive brain measures can be used in assessing the effects of stroke which are related to the behavioral symptoms patients manifest.",M2
20456929,"Investigating relationships between <e>cortical</e> thickness and cognitive performance in patients with schizophrenia and healthy adults.Relationships between prefrontal and temporal lobe grey matter volumes as assessed by magnetic resonance imaging and neurocognitive test results have been reported in schizophrenia. This investigation aimed to localize brain regions where cortical thickness and neurocognitive performance were related, and investigate if such relationships might differ in schizophrenia patients and healthy controls. Sixty-seven patients with schizophrenia and 69 healthy controls were characterized by neurocognitive testing and by brain cortical thickness maps. Putative cortical thickness/cognitive score relationships were investigated with contrast analyses of general linear models for the combined sample. Regions in which relationships were present were further investigated for diagnostic interaction. In the combined sample, significant positive relationships were found between frontal, temporal and occipital regions and tests for verbal IQ, verbal learning and executive functions. Diagnostic interaction was found for the relationships between verbal IQ and the right temporo-occipital junction and the left middle occipital gyrus. In conclusion, the significant relationships between cortical thickness and neurocognitive performances were localized in brain areas known to be involved in cognition. The relationships were similar in patients and controls, except for the right temporo-occipital and left occipital cortical areas, indicating a disrupted structure-function relationship in patients with schizophrenia compared to healthy control subjects.",M2

Voltage-gated Ca2+ channels in plasma membrane are essential components of Ca2+ signal whose change on pathological conditions is closely related to processes of diseases. Although both IL-1beta and Ca2+ channels have key roles in injury and disease of the brain, so far their relations have been reported in few studies. The effects of IL-1beta on Ca2+ channels in cultured cortical neurons of rats were investigated using patch-clamp recording in present research. Our results showed that both 10 and 50 ng/mL of IL-1beta treatment inhibit the Ca2+ currents in time and dose dependent manner, without the change of activation properties of voltage-gated Ca2+ channels (VGCC)s.",M2
20445062,"PICK1 regulates incorporation of calcium-permeable AMPA receptors during <e>cortical</e> synaptic strengthening.While AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) found at principal neuron excitatory synapses typically contain the GluR2 subunit, several forms of behavioral experience have been linked to the de novo synaptic insertion of calcium-permeable (CP) AMPARs, defined by their lack of GluR2. In particular, whisker experience drives synaptic potentiation as well as the incorporation of CP-AMPARs in the neocortex. Previous studies implicate PICK1 (protein interacting with C kinase-1) in activity-dependent internalization of GluR2, suggesting one potential mechanism leading to the subsequent accumulation of synaptic CP-AMPARs and increased synaptic strength. Here we test this hypothesis by using a whisker stimulation paradigm in PICK1 knock-out mice. We demonstrate that PICK1 facilitates the surface expression of CP-AMPARs and is indispensable for their experience-dependent synaptic insertion. However, the failure to incorporate CP-AMPARs in PICK1 knock-outs does not preclude sensory-induced enhancement of synaptic currents. Our results indicate that synaptic strengthening in the early postnatal cortex does not require PICK1 or the addition of GluR2-lacking AMPARs. Instead, PICK1 permits changes in AMPAR subunit composition to occur in conjunction with synaptic potentiation.",M2
20442869,"The brain's router: a <e>cortical</e> network model of serial processing in the primate brain.The human brain efficiently solves certain operations such as object recognition and categorization through a massively parallel network of dedicated processors. However, human cognition also relies on the ability to perform an arbitrarily large set of tasks by flexibly recombining different processors into a novel chain. This flexibility comes at the cost of a severe slowing down and a seriality of operations (100-500 ms per step). A limit on parallel processing is demonstrated in experimental setups such as the psychological refractory period (PRP) and the attentional blink (AB) in which the processing of an element either significantly delays (PRP) or impedes conscious access (AB) of a second, rapidly presented element. Here we present a spiking-neuron implementation of a cognitive architecture where a large number of local parallel processors assemble together to produce goal-driven behavior. The precise mapping of incoming sensory stimuli onto motor representations relies on a  router  network capable of flexibly interconnecting processors and rapidly changing its configuration from one task to another. Simulations show that, when presented with dual-task stimuli, the network exhibits parallel processing at peripheral sensory levels, a memory buffer capable of keeping the result of sensory processing on hold, and a slow serial performance at the router stage, resulting in a performance bottleneck. The network captures the detailed dynamics of human behavior during dual-task-performance, including both mean RTs and RT distributions, and establishes concrete predictions on neuronal dynamics during dual-task experiments in humans and non-human primates.",M2
20439733,"Neural basis of global resting-state fMRI activity.Functional MRI (fMRI) has uncovered widespread hemodynamic fluctuations in the brain during rest. Recent electroencephalographic work in humans and microelectrode recordings in anesthetized monkeys have shown this activity to be correlated with slow changes in neural activity. Here we report that the spontaneous fluctuations in the local field potential (LFP) measured from a single <e>cortical</e> site in monkeys at rest exhibit widespread, positive correlations with fMRI signals over nearly the entire cerebral cortex. This correlation was especially consistent in a band of upper gamma-range frequencies (40-80 Hz), for which the hemodynamic signal lagged the neural signal by 6-8 s. A strong, positive correlation was also observed in a band of lower frequencies (2-15 Hz), albeit with a lag closer to zero. The global pattern of correlation with spontaneous fMRI fluctuations was similar whether the LFP signal was measured in occipital, parietal, or frontal electrodes. This coupling was, however, dependent on the monkey's behavioral state, being stronger and anticipatory when the animals' eyes were closed. These results indicate that the often discarded global component of fMRI fluctuations measured during the resting state is tightly coupled with underlying neural activity.",M2
20437558,"Recurrent spreading depolarizations after subarachnoid hemorrhage decreases oxygen availability in human cerebral cortex.OBJECTIVE: Delayed ischemic neurological deficit (DIND) contributes to poor outcome in subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH) patients. Because there is continuing uncertainty as to whether proximal cerebral artery vasospasm is the only cause of DIND, other processes should be considered. A potential candidate is <e>cortical</e> spreading depolarization (CSD)-induced hypoxia. We hypothesized that recurrent CSDs influence cortical oxygen availability. METHODS: Centers in the Cooperative Study of Brain Injury Depolarizations (COSBID) recruited 9 patients with severe SAH, who underwent open neurosurgery. We used simultaneous, colocalized recordings of electrocorticography and tissue oxygen pressure (p(ti)O(2)) in human cerebral cortex. We screened for delayed cortical infarcts by using sequential brain imaging and investigated cerebral vasospasm by angiography or time-of-flight magnetic resonance imaging. RESULTS: In a total recording time of 850 hours, 120 CSDs were found in 8 of 9 patients. Fifty-five CSDs ( approximately 46%) were found in only 2 of 9 patients, who later developed DIND. Eighty-nine ( approximately 75%) of all CSDs occurred between the 5th and 7th day after SAH, and 96 (80%) arose within temporal clusters of recurrent CSD. Clusters of CSD occurred simultaneously, with mainly biphasic CSD-associated p(ti)O(2) responses comprising a primary hypoxic and a secondary hyperoxic phase. The frequency of CSD correlated positively with the duration of the hypoxic phase and negatively with that of the hyperoxic phase. Hypoxic phases significantly increased stepwise within CSD clusters; particularly in DIND patients, biphasic p(ti)O(2) responses changed to monophasic p(ti)O(2) decreases within these clusters. Monophasic hypoxic p(ti)O(2) responses to CSD were found predominantly in DIND patients. INTERPRETATION: We attribute these clinical p(ti)O(2) findings mainly to changes in local blood flow in the cortical microcirculation but also to augmented metabolism. Besides classical contributors like proximal cerebral vasospasm, CSD clusters may reduce O(2) supply and increase O(2) consumption, and thereby promote DIND.",M2

20435005,"Decoding a perceptual decision process across cortex.Perceptual decisions arise from the activity of neurons distributed across brain circuits. But, decoding the mechanisms behind this cognitive operation across brain circuits has long posed a difficult problem. We recorded the neuronal activity of diverse <e>cortical</e> areas, while monkeys performed a vibrotactile discrimination task. We find that the encoding of the stimuli during the stimulus periods, working memory, and comparison periods is widely distributed across cortical areas. Notably, during the comparison and postponed decision report periods the activity of frontal brain circuits encode both the result of the sensory evaluation that corresponds to the monkey's possible choices and past information on which the decision is based. These results suggest that frontal lobe circuits are more engaged in the readout of sensory information from working memory, when it is required to be compared with other sensory inputs, than simply engaged in motor responses during this task.",M2
20435003,"Intensity-dependent adaptation of <e>cortical</e> and thalamic neurons is controlled by brainstem circuits of the sensory pathway.Current views of sensory adaptation in the rat somatosensory system suggest that it results mainly from short-term synaptic depression. Experimental and theoretical studies predict that increasing the intensity of sensory stimulation, followed by an increase in firing probability at early sensory stages, is expected to attenuate the response at later stages disproportionately more than weaker stimuli, due to greater depletion of synaptic resources and the relatively slow recovery process. This may lead to coding ambiguity of stimulus intensity during adaptation. In contrast, we found that increasing the intensity of repetitive whisker stimulation entails less adaptation in cortical neurons. In a series of recordings, from the trigeminal ganglion to the thalamus, we pinpointed the source of the unexpected pattern of adaptation to the brainstem trigeminal complex. We suggest that low-level sensory processing counterbalances later effects of short-term synaptic depression by increasing the throughput of high-intensity sensory inputs.",M2
20427654,"Abeta-mediated NMDA receptor endocytosis in Alzheimer's disease involves ubiquitination of the tyrosine phosphatase STEP61.Amyloid beta (Abeta) is involved in the etiology of Alzheimer's disease (AD) and may contribute to cognitive deficits by increasing internalization of ionotropic glutamate receptors. Striatal-enriched protein tyrosine phosphatase 61 (STEP(61)), which is targeted in part to the postsynaptic terminal, has been implicated in this process. Here we show that STEP(61) levels are progressively increased in the cortex of Tg2576 mice over the first year, as well as in prefrontal cortex of human AD brains. The increased STEP(61) was associated with greater STEP activity, dephosphorylation of phospho-tyr(1472) of the NR2B subunit, and decreased NR1 and NR2B subunits on neuronal membranes. Treatment with Abeta-enriched medium also increased STEP(61) levels and decreased NR1/NR2B abundance in mouse <e>cortical</e> cultures as determined by biotinylation experiments. In STEP knock-out cultures, Abeta treatment failed to induce NMDA receptor internalization. The mechanism for the increase in STEP(61) levels appears to involve the ubiquitin proteasome system. Blocking the proteasome resulted in elevated levels of STEP(61). Moreover, STEP(61)-ubiquitin conjugates were increased in wild-type cortical slices upon Abeta treatment as well as in 12 month Tg2576 cortex. These findings reveal a novel mechanism by which Abeta-mediated accumulation of STEP(61) results in increased internalization of NR1/NR2B receptor that may contribute to the cognitive deficits in AD.",M2
20427645,"Fibrinogen triggers astrocyte scar formation by promoting the availability of active TGF-beta after vascular damage.Scar formation in the nervous system begins within hours after traumatic injury and is characterized primarily by reactive astrocytes depositing proteoglycans that inhibit regeneration. A fundamental question in CNS repair has been the identity of the initial molecular mediator that triggers glial scar formation. Here we show that the blood protein fibrinogen, which leaks into the CNS immediately after blood-brain barrier (BBB) disruption or vascular damage, serves as an early signal for the induction of glial scar formation via the TGF-beta/Smad signaling pathway. Our studies revealed that fibrinogen is a carrier of latent TGF-beta and induces phosphorylation of Smad2 in astrocytes that leads to inhibition of neurite outgrowth. Consistent with these findings, genetic or pharmacologic depletion of fibrinogen in mice reduces active TGF-beta, Smad2 phosphorylation, glial cell activation, and neurocan deposition after <e>cortical</e> injury. Furthermore, stereotactic injection of fibrinogen into the mouse cortex is sufficient to induce astrogliosis. Inhibition of the TGF-beta receptor pathway abolishes the fibrinogen-induced effects on glial scar formation in vivo and in vitro. These results identify fibrinogen as a primary astrocyte activation signal, provide evidence that deposition of inhibitory proteoglycans is induced by a blood protein that leaks in the CNS after vasculature rupture, and point to TGF-beta as a molecular link between vascular permeability and scar formation.",M2

20423340,"Atomoxetine acts as an NMDA receptor blocker in clinically relevant concentrations.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: There is increasing evidence that not only the monoaminergic but also the glutamatergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Hyperactivity of glutamate metabolism might be causally related to a hypoactive state in the dopaminergic system. Atomoxetine, a selective noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, is the first non-stimulant approved for the treatment of this disorder. Here we have evaluated the effects of atomoxetine on glutamate receptors in vitro. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: The whole-cell configuration of the patch-clamp technique was used to analyse the effect of atomoxetine on N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors in cultured rodent <e>cortical</e> and hippocampal neurons as well as on NMDA receptors heterologously expressed in human TsA cells. KEY RESULTS: Atomoxetine blocked NMDA-induced membrane currents. Half-maximal inhibition emerged at about 3 microM which is in the range of clinically relevant concentrations found in plasma of patients treated with this drug. The inhibition was voltage-dependent, indicating an open-channel blocking mechanism. Furthermore, the inhibitory potency of atomoxetine did not vary when measured on NMDA receptors from different brain regions or with different subunit compositions. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The effective NMDA receptor antagonism by atomoxetine at low micromolar concentrations may be relevant to its clinical effects in the treatment of ADHD. Our data provide further evidence that altered glutamatergic transmission might play a role in ADHD pathophysiology.",M2
20421989,"A reaction-diffusion model of human brain development.<e>Cortical</e> folding exhibits both reproducibility and variability in the geometry and topology of its patterns. These two properties are obviously the result of the brain development that goes through local cellular and molecular interactions which have important consequences on the global shape of the cortex. Hypotheses to explain the convoluted aspect of the brain are still intensively debated and do not focus necessarily on the variability of folds. Here we propose a phenomenological model based on reaction-diffusion mechanisms involving Turing morphogens that are responsible for the differential growth of two types of areas, sulci (bottom of folds) and gyri (top of folds). We use a finite element approach of our model that is able to compute the evolution of morphogens on any kind of surface and to deform it through an iterative process. Our model mimics the progressive folding of the cortical surface along foetal development. Moreover it reveals patterns of reproducibility when we look at several realizations of the model from a noisy initial condition. However this reproducibility must be tempered by the fact that a same fold engendered by the model can have different topological properties, in one or several parts. These two results on the reproducibility and variability of the model echo the sulcal roots theory that postulates the existence of anatomical entities around which the folding organizes itself. These sulcal roots would correspond to initial conditions in our model. Last but not least, the parameters of our model are able to produce different kinds of patterns that can be linked to developmental pathologies such as polymicrogyria and lissencephaly. The main significance of our model is that it proposes a first approach to the issue of reproducibility and variability of the cortical folding.",M2
20419608,"[Developmental malformations of the cerebral cortex]Migration disorders (MD) are increasingly recognized as an important cause of epilepsy and developmental delay. Up to 25 % of children with refractory epilepsy have a <e>cortical</e> malformation. MD encompass a wide spectrum with underlying genetic etiologies and clinical manifestations. Research regarding the delineation of the genetic and molecular basis of these disorders has provided greater insight into the pathogenesis of not only the malformation but also the process involved in normal cortical development. Diagnosis of MD is important since patients who fail three antiepileptic medications are less likely to have their seizures controlled with additional trials of medications and therefore epilepsy surgery should be considered. Recent improvements in neuroimaging have resulted in a significant increase in the recognition of MD. Findings can be subdivided in disorders due to abnormal neurogenesis, neuronal migration, neuronal migration arrest and neuronal organization resulting in different malformations like microcephaly, lissencephaly, schizencephaly and heterotopia. The examination protocol should include T 1-w and T 2-w sequences in adequate slice orientation. T 1-w turbo-inversion recovery sequences (TIR) can be helpful to diagnose heterotopia.

20418805,"SDS-PAGE/immunoblot detection of Abeta multimers in human <e>cortical</e> tissue homogenates using antigen-epitope retrieval.The anomalous folding and polymerization of the beta-amyloid (Abeta) peptide is thought to initiate the neurodegenerative cascade in Alzheimer's disease pathogenesis(1). Abeta is predominantly a 40- or 42-amino acid peptide that is prone to self-aggregation into beta-sheet-rich amyloid fibrils that are found in the cores of cerebral senile plaques in Alzheimer's disease. Increasing evidence suggests that low molecular weight, soluble Abeta multimers are more toxic than fibrillar Abeta amyloid(2). The identification and quantification of low- and high-molecular weight multimeric Abeta species in brain tissue is an essential objective in Alzheimer's disease research, and the methods employed also can be applied to the identification and characterization of toxic multimers in other proteopathies(3). Naturally occurring Abeta multimers can be detected by SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis followed by immunoblotting with Abeta-specific antibodies. However, the separation and detection of multimeric Abeta requires the use of highly concentrated cortical homogenates and antigen retrieval in small pore-size nitrocellulose membranes. Here we describe a technique for the preparation of clarified human cortical homogenates, separation of proteins by SDS-PAGE, and antigen-epitope retrieval/Western blotting with antibody 6E10 to the N-terminal region of the Abeta peptide. Using this protocol, we consistently detect Abeta monomers, dimers, trimers, tetramers, and higher molecular weight multimers in cortical tissue from humans with Alzheimer's pathology.",M2
20418074,"Complex pattern of <e>cortical</e> thinning in schizophrenia: results from an automated surface based analysis of cortical thickness.A considerable body of evidence from structural brain imaging studies suggests that patients with schizophrenia have significant alterations of gray matter density. Additionally, recently developed surface-based analysis approaches demonstrate reduced cortical thickness in patients with schizophrenia. However, the number of studies employing this relatively new method is still limited. Specifically, little is known about changes in cortical thickness in schizophrenia patients whose duration of illness is relatively short. Therefore, the present study sought to examine cortical thickness in a large sample of patients with adult onset schizophrenia and an average duration of illness of 4.4 years, using an automated analysis method over the entire cortex. A significantly decreased cortical thickness in prefrontal and temporolimbic regions as well as parieto-occipital cortical areas was hypothesized. A sample of 58 patients with schizophrenia and 58 age- and sex-matched healthy controls was investigated using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and an automated algorithm for extraction of the cortical surface in order to assess local cortical thinning across the entire cerebrum. Significant reduction of cortical thickness in schizophrenia was found in a spatially complex pattern of focal anatomical regions. This pattern comprised the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as the medial prefrontal cortex, lateral temporal cortices, left entorhinal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, precuneus and lingual cortex, bilaterally. A complex fronto-temporo-parietal pattern of reduced cortical thickness in schizophrenia was observed. This pattern is consistent with a disruption of neurofunctional networks previously implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.",M2

In order to prevent an oxidative stress-induced cytotoxic effect, concomitantly with H(2)O(2), vitamins E and C were added into the nutrient medium. Oxygen, lipid and nitrogen free radicals were registered by method Electron Paramagnetic Resonance (EPR) and spin-traps. The data, obtained in our study revealed decreasing of intensity of NO content and increasing of spin trapped superoxid- (O(2-)) and lipoperoxid-radicals (LOO.) in explants of brain cortex of the newborn albino rats cultured in oxidative stress conditions. These changes were attenuated following action of vitamins E and C (decreasing of intensity of EPR signals of O2- and LOO, increasing of free NO content).",M2
20412388,"Off-line concomitant release of dopamine and glutamate involvement in taste memory consolidation.It has been postulated that memory consolidation process requires post-learning molecular changes that will support long-term experiences. In the present study, we assessed with in vivo microdialysis and capillary electrophoresis whether such changes involve the release of neurotransmitters at post-acquisition stages. Using conditioned taste aversion paradigm we observed spontaneous off-line (i.e. in absence of stimulation) dopamine and glutamate reactivation within the insular cortex about 45 min after the stimuli association. These increments did not appear in control groups that were unable to acquire the task, and it seems to be dependent on amygdala activity since its reversible inactivation by tetrodotoxin impaired <e>cortical</e> off-line release of both neurotransmitters and memory consolidation. In addition, blockade of dopaminergic D1 and/or NMDA receptors before the off-line activity impaired long- but not short-term memory.

20410119,"Cullin 5 regulates <e>cortical</e> layering by modulating the speed and duration of Dab1-dependent neuronal migration.The multilayered mammalian neocortex develops by the coordinated immigration and differentiation of cells that are produced at distant sites. Correct layering requires an extracellular protein, Reelin (Reln), an intracellular signaling molecule, Disabled-1 (Dab1), and an E3 ubiquitin ligase, Cullin-5 (Cul5). Reln activates Dab1, which is then degraded by Cul5. Here we test whether Cul5 regulates neuron layering by affecting Dab1 stability or other mechanisms. We find that a stabilized mutant Dab1, which resists Cul5-dependent degradation, causes a similar phenotype to Cul5 deficiency. Moreover, Cul5 has no effect when Dab1 is absent. The effects of Cul5 and Dab1 are cell autonomous, and Cul5 regulates movement of early as well as late cortical neurons. Removing Cul5 increases the speed at which neurons migrate through the cortical plate by reducing the time spent stationary and increasing the speed of individual steps. These results show that Cul5 regulates neuron layering by stimulating Dab1 degradation and that Cul5 controls migration speed and stopping point, and they demonstrate the importance of negative feedback in signaling during cortical development.",M2
20410105,"Brain plasticity and intellectual ability are influenced by shared genes.Although the adult brain is considered to be fully developed and stable until senescence when its size steadily decreases, such stability seems at odds with continued human (intellectual) development throughout life. Moreover, although variation in human brain size is highly heritable, we do not know the extent to which genes contribute to individual differences in brain plasticity. In this longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study in twins, we report considerable thinning of the frontal cortex and thickening of the medial temporal cortex with increasing age and find this change to be heritable and partly related to cognitive ability. Specifically, adults with higher intelligence show attenuated <e>cortical</e> thinning and more pronounced cortical thickening over time than do subjects with average or below average IQ. Genes influencing variability in both intelligence and brain plasticity partly drive these associations. Thus, not only does the brain continue to change well into adulthood, these changes are functionally relevant because they are related to intelligence.",M2
20404404,"<e>Cortical</e> activity during tactile exploration of objects in blind and sighted humans.PURPOSE: Recent studies show evidence of multisensory representation in the functionally normal visual cortex, but this idea remains controversial. Occipital cortex activation is often claimed to be a reflection of mental visual imagery processes triggered by other modalities. However, if the occipital cortex is genuinely active during touch, this might be the basis for the massive cross-modal plasticity observed in the congenitally blind. METHODS: To address these issues, we used fMRI to compare patterns of activation evoked by a tactile object recognition (TOR) task (right or left hand) in 8 sighted and 8 congenitally blind subjects, with several other control tasks. RESULTS: TOR robustly activated object selective regions in the lateral occipital complex (LOC/LOtv) in the blind (similar to the patterns of activation found in the sighted), indicating that object identification per se (i.e. in the absence of visual imagery) is sufficient to evoke responses in the LOC/LOtv. Importantly, there was negligible occipital activation for hand movements (imitating object palpations) in the occipital cortex, in both groups. Moreover, in both groups, TOR activation in the LOC/LOtv was bilateral, regardless of the palpating hand (similar to the lack of strong visual field preference in the LOC/LOtv for viewed objects). Finally, the most prominent enhancement in TOR activation in the congenitally blind (compared to their sighted peers) was found in the posterior occipital cortex. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that visual imagery is not an obligatory condition for object activation in visual cortex. It also demonstrates the massive plasticity in visual cortex of the blind for tactile object recognition that involves both the ventral and dorsal occipital areas, probably to support the high demand for this function in the blind.",M2

The cohort was divisible into those with dementia at death with (n = 14) or without (n = 10) significant Alzheimer-type pathology, and those who were not demented (n = 19). Amyloid beta-protein monomer in extracts produced using Tris-buffered saline and Tris-buffered saline containing 1% TX-100 were strongly associated with Alzheimer type dementia (P &lt; 0.001) and sodium dodecyl sulphate-stable amyloid beta-protein dimer was detected specifically and sensitively in Tris-buffered saline, Tris-buffered saline containing 1% TX-100 and formic acid extracts of Alzheimer brain. Amyloid beta-protein monomer in the formic acid fraction closely correlated with diffuse and neuritic plaque burden, but was not specific for dementia. These findings support the hypothesis that soluble amyloid beta-protein is a major correlate of dementia associated with Alzheimer-type pathology and is likely to be intimately involved in the pathogenesis of cognitive failure.",M2
20403083,"Mitochondrial protection after traumatic brain injury by scavenging lipid peroxyl radicals.Mitochondrial dysfunction after traumatic brain injury (TBI) is manifested by increased levels of oxidative damage, loss of respiratory functions and diminished ability to buffer cytosolic calcium. This study investigated the detrimental effects of lipid peroxyl radicals (LOO(*)) and lipid peroxidation (LP) in brain mitochondria after TBI by examining the protective effects of U-83836E, a potent and selective scavenger of LOO(*) radicals. Male CF1 mice were subjected to severe controlled <e>cortical</e> impact TBI (CCI-TBI) and treated with either vehicle or U-83836E initiated i.v. at 15 min post-injury. Calcium (Ca(++)) buffering capacity and respiratory function were measured in isolated cortical mitochondrial samples taken from the ipsilateral hemisphere at 3 and 12 h post-TBI, respectively. In vehicle-treated injured mice, the cortical mitochondrial Ca(++) buffering capacity was reduced by 60% at 3 h post-injury (p &lt; 0.001) and the respiratory control ratio was decreased by 27% at 12 h post-TBI, relative to sham, non-injured mice. U-83836E treatment significantly (p &lt; 0.05) preserved Ca(++) buffering capacity and attenuated the reduction in respiratory control ratio values. Consistent with the functional effects of U-83836E being as a result of an attenuation of mitochondrial oxidative damage, the compound significantly (p &lt; 0.001) reduced LP-generated 4-hydroxynonenal levels in both cortical homogenates and mitochondria at both 3 and 12 h post-TBI. Unexpectedly, U-83836E also reduced peroxynitrite-generated 3-nitrotyrosine in parallel with the reduction in 4-hydroxynonenal. The results demonstrate that LOO(*) radicals contribute to secondary brain mitochondrial dysfunction after TBI by propagating LP and protein nitrative damage in cellular and mitochondrial membranes.",M2
20402573,"<e>Cortical</e> and subcortical sensory-motor impairment in patients with major depression: a preliminary analysis.Assessment of patients with depression tends to focus on the psychiatric symptoms of the disorder to quantify distress, potential for suicide, and helps determine the appropriate course of treatment. However, research increasingly reveals comorbid organic and biological deficits in higher order cortical skills and subcortical processes which should be considered when assessing the depressed patient. The current study investigated the presence of cortical and subcortical sensory deficits in a group of 36 patients with Major Depressive Disorder as compared to a group of normal controls. The results of a MANOVA indicated a significant performance difference between depressed and nondepressed participants (Wilks' Lambda = .437, F = 3.68, p &gt; .001). Subsequent univariate tests showed normals performed better on 29 of 35 variables of a sensory-motor battery. Deficits in sensory and motor functioning can have a profound impact on patient functioning and may remit with treatment. Thus, a comprehensive neuropsychological battery for patients with depression should include standardized and psychometrically sound measures of sensory and motor functioning.",M2
20400525,"Epileptic high-frequency network activity in a model of non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy.High-frequency <e>cortical</e> activity, particularly in the 250-600 Hz (fast ripple) band, has been implicated in playing a crucial role in epileptogenesis and seizure generation. Fast ripples are highly specific for the seizure initiation zone. However, evidence for the association of fast ripples with epileptic foci depends on animal models and human cases with substantial lesions in the form of hippocampal sclerosis, which suggests that neuronal loss may be required for fast ripples. In the present work, we tested whether cell loss is a necessary prerequisite for the generation of fast ripples, using a non-lesional model of temporal lobe epilepsy that lacks hippocampal sclerosis. The model is induced by unilateral intrahippocampal injection of tetanus toxin. Recordings from the hippocampi of freely-moving epileptic rats revealed high-frequency activity (&gt;100 Hz), including fast ripples. High-frequency activity was present both during interictal discharges and seizure onset. Interictal fast ripples proved a significantly more reliable marker of the primary epileptogenic zone than the presence of either interictal discharges or ripples (100-250 Hz). These results suggest that fast ripple activity should be considered for its potential value in the pre-surgical workup of non-lesional temporal lobe epilepsy.",M2
20399736,"Predicting value of pain and analgesia: nucleus accumbens response to noxious stimuli changes in the presence of chronic pain.We compared brain activations in response to acute noxious thermal stimuli in controls and chronic back pain (CBP) patients. Pain perception and related <e>cortical</e> activation patterns were similar in the two groups. However, nucleus accumbens (NAc) activity differentiated the groups at a very high accuracy, exhibiting phasic and tonic responses with distinct properties. Positive phasic NAc activations at stimulus onset and offset tracked stimulus salience and, in normal subjects, predicted reward (pain relief) magnitude at stimulus offset. In CBP, NAc activity correlated with different cortical circuitry from that of normals and phasic activity at stimulus offset was negative in polarity, suggesting that the acute pain relieves the ongoing back pain. The relieving effect was confirmed in a separate psychophysical study in CBP. Therefore, in contrast to somatosensory pathways, which reflect sensory properties of acute noxious stimuli, NAc activity in humans encodes its predicted value and anticipates its analgesic potential on chronic pain.

20399730,"The apical complex couples cell fate and cell survival to cerebral <e>cortical</e> development.Cortical development depends upon tightly controlled cell fate and cell survival decisions that generate a functional neuronal population, but the coordination of these two processes is poorly understood. Here we show that conditional removal of a key apical complex protein, Pals1, causes premature withdrawal from the cell cycle, inducing excessive generation of early-born postmitotic neurons followed by surprisingly massive and rapid cell death, leading to the abrogation of virtually the entire cortical structure. Pals1 loss shows exquisite dosage sensitivity, so that heterozygote mutants show an intermediate phenotype on cell fate and cell death. Loss of Pals1 blocks essential cell survival signals, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, while mTORC1 activation partially rescues Pals1 deficiency. These data highlight unexpected roles of the apical complex protein Pals1 in cell survival through interactions with mTOR signaling.",M2
20399207,"Decreased and increased <e>cortical</e> activation coexist in de novo Parkinson's disease.Previous fMRI studies using motor tasks yielded conflicting results concerning the activation pattern in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients. Possible explanations of these discrepancies include differences in the clinical features of the examined patients and in the executed tasks and incomplete task monitoring. We evaluated with fMRI 20 patients with untreated de-novo PD and 11 healthy controls with a simple motor task consisting of self-paced continuous right hand-tapping. The task was monitored on-line with a dedicated device which measures the strength and frequency of the tapping. Fifteen patients performed the task correctly. The frequency was not significantly different, whereas force was slightly different between patients (26.4+/-3.0 N) and controls (28.5+/-2.4 N) (p=0.046, Mann-Whitney U-test). After insertion of the subject's frequency and force as covariate variables in the model, PD patients compared to controls showed areas of significantly [Z statistic image&gt;5.1 and p&lt; or =0.05 (corrected) cluster significance] lower activation in the left primary sensorimotor (SM1) cortex and cerebellum and higher activation in the left temporal-parietal cortex adjacent to the SM1 and in right SM1. Furthermore in PD patients the disease severity evaluated with the Hoehn and Yahr staging system correlated significantly [Z statistic image&gt;2.3 and p&lt; or =0.05 (corrected) cluster significance] with activation of left SM1 and supplementary motor area and cingulum, bilaterally. The mixed pattern of decreased and increased cortical activation in de novo PD patients possibly reflects the coexistence of cortical deafferentation, and compensatory phenomena by cortico-cortical circuits.",M2
20397842,"Repeated exposure to low-level extremely low frequency-modulated microwaves affects cortex-hypothalamus interplay in freely moving rats: EEG study.PURPOSE: To compare the effects of repeated exposure to extremely low frequency-modulated microwaves (ELF-MW) on <e>cortical</e> and hypothalamic electroencephalograms (EEG). MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 10 freely moving rats with carbon electrodes implanted into the cortex and dorsomedial hypothalamus, averaged frequency spectra (0.5-30 Hz) of the EEG were studied for five consecutive days either under sham exposures (five rats) or under mixed sham/MW-exposures (five rats). The rats were exposed to ELF-MW (915 MHz, 20-ms pulse duration, approximately 0.3 mW/cm(2), 4 Hz) intermittently (1-min 'On', 1-min 'Off') for 10 min (specific absorption rate, SAR, approximately 0.7 mW/g on average) several times per day, with 10-min pre- and post-exposure periods. RESULTS: In baseline EEG, the activities of 3.2-6.0 Hz and 17.8-30.5 Hz dominated in the cortex and of 6.0-17.8 Hz in the hypothalamus. This cortical-hypothalamic imbalance was relatively stable at sham-exposures and insensitive to ELF-MW in all frequency ranges but one. ELF-MW increased the beta(2) (17.8-30.5 Hz) level in the hypothalamus to a greater extent than in the cortex, causing significant diminishing of the initial EEG bias between them. Moreover, a cumulative phenomenon under repeated exposures to ELF-MW was revealed. CONCLUSIONS: These results are in line with evidence that repeated low-level exposure to ELF-MW affects brain functioning and provide an additional approach when analysing underlying mechanisms.",M2

DESIGN: Retrospective chart review of 57 individuals with the diagnoses of severe cortical and spinal spasticity requiring an intrathecal baclofen pump. METHODS: Parameters evaluated included daily dosage of medication required, flex vs simple continuous delivery modes, dosing changes, need for other local spasticity treatment, and catheter complications. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant differences between individuals with cortical spasticity and spinal spasticity when comparing daily dosage, number of contacts, and mode of delivery. At 6 months, there was a statistically significant difference in dosing between individuals with multiple sclerosis and those without. Within groups, there was a significant difference in average daily dosing over 3 years. A significant difference was found comparing the use of botulinum toxin type A for upper extremity spasticity within the cortical group. Nine individuals had catheter complications. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical and spinal spasticity appear to parallel each other with no significant differences in daily dosing, dosing changes, and mode of delivery of intrathecal baclofen. This did not hold true at all time points for the multiple sclerosis subgroup. The significant difference noted within groups for daily dosing over the first 3 years challenges the notion of stable dosing over time. Focal injections of Botox/phenol in the upper extremities are an important adjunct therapy for patients with cortical spasticity, even after the placement of an intrathecal baclofen pump. Our complication rate was slightly lower than that reported in the literature.",M2

METHOD: Primary cultures of neurons from the of 16-days-old embryo rats were used to study. Neurons in the experimental group were treated with cort (200 micromol x L(-1)) 30 min after the pretreatment of PF (0.5, 2, 10 micromol x L(-1)). We used MTT assay to detect the action of paeoniflorin on neuronal activity. DAPI staining to study of the influence of PF on neuronal apoptosis morphology, and Annexin V-FITC/PI apoptosis detection kit to inspect the impact of paeoniflorin on the early neuronal apoptosis. RESULT: Compared with model group, every dose of PF (0.5, 2, 10 micromol x L(-1)) can raise the neuronal activity notably (P&lt;0.05), PF of 2 micromol x L(-1) and 10 micromol x L(-1) can reduce the rate of neuronal apoptosis. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that PF achieved prophylactic neuroprotective effect through against corticosterone-induced neurons damages.",M2
20393464,"Control of <e>cortical</e> GABA circuitry development by Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling.Schizophrenia is a complex disorder that interferes with the function of several brain systems required for cognition and normal social behaviour. Although the most notable clinical aspects of the disease only become apparent during late adolescence or early adulthood, many lines of evidence suggest that schizophrenia is a neurodevelopmental disorder with a strong genetic component. Several independent studies have identified neuregulin 1 (NRG1) and its receptor ERBB4 as important risk genes for schizophrenia, although their precise role in the disease process remains unknown. Here we show that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling controls the development of inhibitory circuitries in the mammalian cerebral cortex by cell-autonomously regulating the connectivity of specific GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid)-containing interneurons. In contrast to the prevalent view, which supports a role for these genes in the formation and function of excitatory synapses between pyramidal cells, we found that ErbB4 expression in the mouse neocortex and hippocampus is largely confined to certain classes of interneurons. In particular, ErbB4 is expressed by many parvalbumin-expressing chandelier and basket cells, where it localizes to axon terminals and postsynaptic densities receiving glutamatergic input. Gain- and loss-of-function experiments, both in vitro and in vivo, demonstrate that ErbB4 cell-autonomously promotes the formation of axo-axonic inhibitory synapses over pyramidal cells, and that this function is probably mediated by Nrg1. In addition, ErbB4 expression in GABA-containing interneurons regulates the formation of excitatory synapses onto the dendrites of these cells. By contrast, ErbB4 is dispensable for excitatory transmission between pyramidal neurons. Altogether, our results indicate that Nrg1 and ErbB4 signalling is required for the wiring of GABA-mediated circuits in the postnatal cortex, providing a new perspective to the involvement of these genes in the aetiology of schizophrenia.",M2
20392967,"Focal <e>cortical</e> infarcts alter intrinsic excitability and synaptic excitation in the reticular thalamic nucleus.Focal cortical injuries result in death of cortical neurons and their efferents and ultimately in death or damage of thalamocortical relay (TCR) neurons that project to the affected cortical area. Neurons of the inhibitory reticular thalamic nucleus (nRT) receive excitatory inputs from corticothalamic and thalamocortical axons and are thus denervated by such injuries, yet nRT cells generally survive these insults to a greater degree than TCR cells. nRT cells inhibit TCR cells, regulate thalamocortical transmission, and generate cerebral rhythms including those involved in thalamocortical epilepsies. The survival and reorganization of nRT after cortical injury would determine recovery of thalamocortical circuits after injury. However, the physiological properties and connectivity of the survivors remain unknown. To study possible alterations in nRT neurons, we used the rat photothrombosis model of cortical stroke. Using in vitro patch-clamp recordings at various times after the photothrombotic injury, we show that localized strokes in the somatosensory cortex induce long-term reductions in intrinsic excitability and evoked synaptic excitation of nRT cells by the end of the first week after the injury. We find that nRT neurons in injured rats show (1) decreased membrane input resistance, (2) reduced low-threshold calcium burst responses, and (3) weaker evoked excitatory synaptic responses. Such alterations in nRT cellular excitability could lead to loss of nRT-mediated inhibition in relay nuclei, increased output of surviving TCR cells, and enhanced thalamocortical excitation, which may facilitate recovery of thalamic and cortical sensory circuits. In addition, such changes could be maladaptive, leading to injury-induced epilepsy.",M2
20392955,"Dlx5 and Dlx6 regulate the development of parvalbumin-expressing <e>cortical</e> interneurons.Dlx5 and Dlx6 homeobox genes are expressed in developing and mature cortical interneurons. Simultaneous deletion of Dlx5 and 6 results in exencephaly of the anterior brain; despite this defect, prenatal basal ganglia differentiation appeared largely intact, while tangential migration of Lhx6(+) and Mafb(+) interneurons to the cortex was reduced and disordered. The migration deficits were associated with reduced CXCR4 expression. Transplantation of mutant immature interneurons into a wild-type brain demonstrated that loss of either Dlx5 or Dlx5&amp;6 preferentially reduced the number of mature parvalbumin(+) interneurons; those parvalbumin(+) interneurons that were present had increased dendritic branching. Dlx5/6(+/-) mice, which appear normal histologically, show spontaneous electrographic seizures and reduced power of gamma oscillations. Thus, Dlx5&amp;6 appeared to be required for development and function of somal innervating (parvalbumin(+)) neocortical interneurons. This contrasts with Dlx1, whose function is required for dendrite innervating (calretinin(+), somatostatin(+), and neuropeptide Y(+)) interneurons (Cobos et al., 2005).",M2
20392280,"The neural mechanisms of visual selection: the view from neuropsychology.In this review, we discuss how neuropsychological impairments in visual selection can inform us about how selection normally operates. Using neuroanatomical and behavioral evidence on the disorders of neglect, extinction, and simultanagnosia, we propose functional and anatomical links between different aspects of visual selection and distinct sites in the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). This includes linking: (i) bottom-up attentional capture and the right temporo-parietal junction (TPJ); (ii) top-down segmentation of displays and the medial PPC; (iii) grouping, individuation and identification, and the inferior intra-parietal sulcus (IPS) bilaterally; and (iv) the suppression of saliency and the left IPS. In addition, when neuropsychological studies are combined with fMRI, there is evidence that these regions of the PPC interact with striate and extra-striate <e>cortical</e> areas, which respond to specific properties of stimuli. Selection should be viewed as an emergent property of a network of areas involving both ventral and dorsal cortex.",M2

20389589,"Estimation of directional coupling between <e>cortical</e> areas using Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIRS).This study invesitigated the feasibility of measuring directional coupling between cortical areas with near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Cerebral hemodynamic responses were recorded at the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), secondary somatosensory cortex (S2), and primary motor cortex (M1) regions of the rat barrel cortex during electrical stimulation of rat whiskers. Deoxyhemoglobin concentration changes were calculated from NIRS recordings and the Granger causality based on the multivariate autoregressive (MVAR) model was used to estimate the effective causal connectivity among S1, S2, and M1. The estimated causality patterns of seven rats showed consistent unidirectional coupling between the somatosensory areas and the motor areas (S1 and S2--&gt;M1), which coincided well with our hypothesis because the rats' motor function was completely anesthetized. Our preliminary results suggest that cortico-cortical directional coupling can be successfully investigated with NIRS.",M2
20389079,"Heme oxygenase-2 modulates early pathogenesis after traumatic injury to the immature brain.We determined if heme oxygenase-2 (HO-2), an enzyme that degrades the pro-oxidant heme, confers neuroprotection in the developing brain after traumatic brain injury (TBI). Male HO-2 wild-type (WT) and homozygous knockout (KO) mice at postnatal day 21 were subjected to TBI and euthanized 1, 7, and 14 days later. Relative cerebral blood flow, measured by laser Doppler, <e>cortical</e> and hippocampal pathogenesis, and motor recovery were evaluated at all time points. Cerebral blood flow was found to be similar between experimental groups. Blood flow significantly decreased immediately after injury, returned to baseline by 1 day, and was significantly elevated by 7 days, post-injury. Nonheme iron preferentially accumulated in the ipsilateral cortex, hippocampus, and external capsule in both WT and KO brain-injured genotypes. There were, however, a significantly greater number of TUNEL-positive cells in the hippocampal dentate gyrus and a significantly greater cortical lesion volume in KOs relative to WTs within the first week post-injury. By 14 days post-injury, however, cortical lesion volume and cell density in the hippocampal CA3 region and dorsal thalamus were similar between the two groups. Assays of fine motor function (grip strength) over the first 2 weeks post-injury revealed a general pattern of decreased strength in the contralateral forelimbs of KOs as compared to WTs. Together, these findings demonstrate that deficiency in HO-2 alters both the kinetics of secondary damage and fine motor recovery after TBI.",M2
20385911,"Relationship of <e>cortical</e> atrophy to fatigue in patients with multiple sclerosis.BACKGROUND: Fatigue is a common and disabling symptom of multiple sclerosis (MS). Previous studies reported that damage of the corticostriatothalamocortical circuit is critical in its occurrence. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relationship between fatigue in MS and regional cortical and subcortical gray matter atrophy. DESIGN: Case-control study. SETTING: National Institutes of Health. PARTICIPANTS: Twenty-four patients with MS and 24 matched healthy volunteers who underwent 3.0-T magnetic resonance imaging and evaluations of fatigue (Modified Fatigue Impact Scale) and depression (Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Relationship between thalamic and basal ganglia volume, cortical thickness of frontal and parietal lobes, and, in patients, T2 lesion volume and normal-appearing white matter volume and the extent of fatigue. RESULTS: Patients were more fatigued than healthy volunteers (P = .04), while controlling for the effect of depression. Modified Fatigue Impact Scale score correlated with cortical thickness of the parietal lobe (r = -0.50, P = .01), explaining 25% of its variance. The posterior parietal cortex was the only parietal area significantly associated with the Modified Fatigue Impact Scale scores. CONCLUSIONS: Cortical atrophy of the parietal lobe had the strongest relationship with fatigue. Given the implications of the posterior parietal cortex in motor planning and integration of information from different sources, our preliminary results suggest that dysfunctions in higher-order aspects of motor control may have a role in determining fatigue in MS.",M2
20385653,"Powerful beneficial effects of benfotiamine on cognitive impairment and beta-amyloid deposition in amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 transgenic mice.Reduction of glucose metabolism in brain is one of the main features of Alzheimer's disease. Thiamine (vitamin B1)-dependent processes are critical in glucose metabolism and have been found to be impaired in brains from patients with Alzheimer's disease. However, thiamine treatment exerts little beneficial effect in these patients. Here, we tested the effect of benfotiamine, a thiamine derivative with better bioavailability than thiamine, on cognitive impairment and pathology alterations in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, the amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 transgenic mouse. We show that after a chronic 8 week treatment, benfotiamine dose-dependently enhanced the spatial memory of amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 mice in the Morris water maze test. Furthermore, benfotiamine effectively reduced both amyloid plaque numbers and phosphorylated tau levels in <e>cortical</e> areas of the transgenic mice brains. Unexpectedly, these effects were not mimicked by another lipophilic thiamine derivative, fursultiamine, although both benfotiamine and fursultiamine were effective in increasing the levels of free thiamine in the brain. Most notably, benfotiamine, but not fursultiamine, significantly elevated the phosphorylation level of glycogen synthase kinase-3alpha and -3beta, and reduced their enzymatic activities in the amyloid precursor protein/presenilin-1 transgenic brain. Therefore, in the animal Alzheimer's disease model, benfotiamine appears to improve the cognitive function and reduce amyloid deposition via thiamine-independent mechanisms, which are likely to include the suppression of glycogen synthase kinase-3 activities. These results suggest that, unlike many other thiamine-related drugs, benfotiamine may be beneficial for clinical Alzheimer's disease treatment.",M2
20385128,"Up-regulation of striatal adenosine A(2A) receptors with iron deficiency in rats: effects on locomotion and cortico-striatal neurotransmission.Brain iron deficiency leads to altered dopaminergic function in experimental animals, which can provide a mechanistic explanation for iron deficiency-related human sensory-motor disorders, such as Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS). However, mechanisms linking both conditions have not been determined. Considering the strong modulation exerted by adenosine on dopamine signaling, one connection could involve changes in adenosine receptor expression or function. In the striatum, presynaptic A(2A) receptors are localized in glutamatergic terminals contacting GABAergic dynorphinergic neurons and their function can be analyzed by the ability of A(2A) receptor antagonists to block the motor output induced by <e>cortical</e> electrical stimulation. Postsynaptic A(2A) receptors are localized in the dendritic field of GABAergic enkephalinergic neurons and their function can be analyzed by studying the ability of A(2A) receptor antagonists to produce locomotor activity and to counteract striatal ERK1/2 phosphorylation induced by cortical electrical stimulation. Increased density of striatal A(2A) receptors was found in rats fed during 3 weeks with an iron-deficient diet during the post-weaning period. In iron-deficient rats, the selective A(2A) receptor antagonist MSX-3, at doses of 1 and 3 mg/kg, was more effective at blocking motor output induced by cortical electrical stimulation (presynaptic A(2A) receptor-mediated effect) and at enhancing locomotor activation and blocking striatal ERK phosphorylation induced by cortical electrical stimulation (postsynaptic A(2A) receptor-mediated effects). These results indicate that brain iron deficiency induces a functional up-regulation of both striatal pre- and postsynaptic A(2A) receptor, which could be involved in sensory-motor disorders associated with iron deficiency such as RLS.",M2

20381489,"Resveratrol protects against experimental stroke: putative neuroprotective role of heme oxygenase 1.Epidemiological and experimental reports have linked mild-to-moderate wine and/or grape consumption to a lowered incidence of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular, and peripheral vascular risk. This study revealed that resveratrol, an enriched bioactive polyphenol in red wine, selectively induces heme oxygenase 1 (HO1) in a dose- and time-dependent manner in cultured mouse <e>cortical</e> neuronal cells and provides neuroprotection from free-radical or excitotoxicity damage. This protection was lost when cells were treated with a protein synthesis or heme oxygenase inhibitor, suggesting that HO1 induction is at least partially required for resveratrol's prophylactic properties. Furthermore, resveratrol pretreatment dose-dependently protected mice subjected to an optimized ischemic-reperfusion stroke model. Mice in which HO1 was selectively deleted lost most, if not all, of the beneficial effects. Together, the data suggest a potential intracellular pathway by which resveratrol can provide cell/organ resistance against neuropathological conditions.",M2
20380727,"Decay accelerating factor (CD55) protects neuronal cells from chemical hypoxia-induced injury.ABSTRACT: BACKGROUND: Activated complement system is known to mediate neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration following exposure to hypoxic-ischemic insults. Therefore, inhibition of the complement activation cascade may represent a potential therapeutic strategy for the management of ischemic brain injury. Decay-accelerating factor (DAF, also known as CD55) inhibits complement activation by suppressing the function of C3/C5 convertases, thereby limiting local generation or deposition of C3a/C5a and membrane attack complex (MAC or C5b-9) production. The present study investigates the ability of DAF to protect primary cultured neuronal cells subjected to sodium cyanide (NaCN)-induced hypoxia from degeneration and apoptosis. METHODS: Cultured primary <e>cortical</e> neurons from embryonic Sprague-Dawley rats were assigned one of four groups: control, DAF treatment alone, hypoxic, or hypoxic treated with DAF. Hypoxic cultures were exposed to NaCN for 1 hour, rinsed, followed by 24 hour exposure to 200 ng/ml of recombinant human DAF in normal medium. Human DAF was used in the present study and it has been shown to effectively regulate complement activation in rats. Neuronal cell function, morphology and viability were investigated by measuring plateau depolarization potential, counting the number dendritic spines, and observing TUNEL and MTT assays. Complement C3, C3a, C3a receptor (R) production, C3a-C3aR interaction and MAC formation were assessed along with the generation of activated caspase-9, activated caspase-3, and activated Src. RESULTS: When compared to controls, hypoxic cells had fewer dendritic spines, reduced plateau depolarization accompanied by increased apoptotic activity and accumulation of MAC, as well as up-regulation of C3, C3a and C3aR, enhancement of C3a-C3aR engagement, and elevated caspase and Src activity. Treatment of hypoxic cells with 200 ng/ml of recombinant human DAF resulted in attenuation of neuronal apoptosis and exerted significant protection against neuronal dendritic spine loss and plateau depolarization reduction. Furthermore, treatment with DAF resulted in decreased accumulation of C3a, MAC, C3a-C3aR interaction, caspase-9, activated caspase-3, and pTyr416-Src (activated Src) tyrosine kinase. CONCLUSION: DAF was found to reduce neuronal cell death and apoptosis in NaCN induced hypoxia. This effect is attributed to the ability of DAF to limit complement activation and inhibit the activity of Src and caspases 9 and 3. This study supports the inhibiting of complement as a neuroprotective strategy against CNS ischemia/reperfusion injury.",M2

20377616,"Intrinsic subthreshold oscillations extend the influence of inhibitory synaptic inputs on <e>cortical</e> pyramidal neurons.Fast inhibitory synaptic inputs, which cause conductance changes that typically last for 10-100 ms, participate in the generation and maintenance of cortical rhythms. We show here that these fast events can have influences that outlast the duration of the synaptic potentials by interacting with subthreshold membrane potential oscillations. Inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) in cortical neurons in vitro shifted the oscillatory phase for several seconds. The phase shift caused by two IPSPs or two current pulses summed non-linearly. Cholinergic neuromodulation increased the power of the oscillations and decreased the magnitude of the phase shifts. These results show that the intrinsic conductances of cortical pyramidal neurons can carry information about inhibitory inputs and can extend the integration window for synaptic input.",M2

There is also considerable debate as to the effectiveness of various selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and their potential side-effects on neuronal architecture and function. In this study, using mammalian <e>cortical</e> neurons, a dorsal root ganglia cell line (F11 cells) and identified Lymnaea stagnalis neurons, we provide the first direct and unequivocal evidence that clinically relevant concentrations of Fluoxetine induce growth cone collapse and neurite retraction of both serotonergic and non-serotonergic neurons alike in a dose-dependent manner. Using intracellular recordings and calcium imaging techniques, we further demonstrate that the mechanism underlying Fluoxetine-induced effects on neurite retraction from Lymnaea neurons may involve lowering of intracellular calcium and a subsequent retardation of growth cone cytoskeleton. Using soma-soma synapses between identified presynaptic and postsynaptic Lymnaea neurons, we provide further direct evidence that clinically used concentrations of Fluoxetine also block synaptic transmission and synapse formation between cholinergic neurons. Our study raises alarms over potentially devastating side-effects of this antidepressant drug on neurite outgrowth and synapse formation in a developing/regenerating brain. Our data also demonstrate that drugs such as Fluoxetine may not just affect communication between serotonergic neurons but that the detrimental effects are widespread and involve neurons of various phenotypes from both vertebrate and invertebrate species.",M2
20377612,"Keap1-Nrf2 activation in the presence and absence of DJ-1.The molecular mechanisms leading to neurodegeneration in Parkinson's disease remain elusive. Deletion and mutations of DJ-1 (PARK7) have been reported to cause autosomal recessive familial Parkinson's disease. Wildtype DJ-1 scavenges H(2)O(2) by cysteine oxidation in response to oxidative stress, and thus confers neuroprotection. Activation of the transcription factor NF-E2-related factor-2 (Nrf2) has also been shown to be important for protection against oxidative stress in many models of neurodegenerative diseases. Previous data indicate that DJ-1 affects the transcriptional functions and stability of Nrf2. However, this observation has not been confirmed. In the current study, the role of DJ-1 in the regulation of Nrf2 is examined in primary cultured neurons, astrocytes and in vivo. The prototypical Nrf2 activator tBHQ protected primary <e>cortical</e> neurons derived from DJ-1-knockout (KO) as well as DJ-1 wildtype mice by activation of Nrf2-ARE pathway. Nrf2 nuclear translocation, robust increases in canonical Nrf2-driven genes and proteins, and dramatic activation of the ARE reporter gene, hPAP, were observed after tBHQ treatment. These results were further confirmed by siRNA-mediated DJ-1 knockdown in primary cortical astrocytes from ARE-hPAP mice and tBHQ administration into the striatum of mouse brain. In addition, overexpression of Nrf2 with adenovirus preferentially in astrocytes from DJ-1-KO mice enhanced survival of neurons under oxidative insults. These findings indicate that activation of the Nrf2-ARE pathway is independent of DJ-1, and Nrf2 activation is a potential therapeutic target to prevent neurodegeneration in sporadic and DJ-1 familial Parkinson's disease.",M2
20374429,"Hypoxic ischemia and proteasome dysfunction alter tau isoform ratio by inhibiting exon 10 splicing.Alternative splicing of tau exon 10 influences microtubule assembly and stability during development and in pathological processes of the central nervous system. However, the cellular events that underlie this pre-mRNA splicing remain to be delineated. In this study, we examined the possibility that ischemic injury, known to change the cellular distribution and expression of several RNA splicing factors, alters the splicing of tau exon 10. Transient occlusion of the middle cerebral artery reduced tau exon 10 inclusion in the ischemic <e>cortical</e> area within 12 h, resulting in the induction of three-repeat (3R) tau in cortical neurons. Ubiquitinated protein aggregates and reduced proteasome activity were also observed. Administration of proteasome inhibitors such as MG132, proteasome inhibitor I and lactacystin reduced tau exon 10 splicing in cortical cell cultures. Decreased levels of Tra2beta, an RNA splicing factor responsible for tau exon 10 inclusion, were detected both in cortical cell cultures exposed to MG132 and in cerebral cortex after ischemic injury. Taken together, these findings suggest that transient focal cerebral ischemia reduces tau exon 10 splicing through a mechanism involving proteasome-ubiquitin dysfunction and down-regulation of Tra2beta.",M2
20373349,"A 3-year magnetic resonance imaging study of <e>cortical</e> lesions in relapse-onset multiple sclerosis.OBJECTIVE: We assessed the occurrence, extent, and frequency of formation of cortical lesions (CLs) in patients with relapsing-remitting (RR) and secondary progressive (SP) multiple sclerosis (MS), and their relationship with cortical atrophy and disability progression. METHODS: One-hundred seven MS patients (76 RRMS and 31 SPMS), enrolled in a prospective, longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) study, were assessed clinically and by brain MRI (including a double inversion recovery sequence) 3 years after study initiation. CL number and volume, T2 white matter (WM) lesion volume, gray matter fraction, and expanded disability status scale (EDSS) were measured. RESULTS: At baseline, CLs were detected in 64.4% of RRMS and 74.2% of SPMS patients. During follow-up, 132 new CLs were found in 44 RRMS patients (57.9%; 0.8 new CL/patient/yr) and 61 in 15 SPMS patients (48.4%; 1.0 new CL/patient/yr). Among these patients, only 31 also showed at least 1 new WM lesion. CL number and volume increases were higher in the 52 patients with a clinical worsening compared with those without (p &lt; 0.001). Baseline CL volume correlated with baseline EDSS (r = 0.36, p &lt; 0.001) and EDSS changes over time (r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.001). Baseline CL volume was an independent predictor of EDSS accumulation and GM volume change at follow-up in both patient groups. In SPMS patients, baseline T2 WM lesion volume was another independent predictor of EDSS worsening. INTERPRETATION: In relapse-onset MS, CLs accumulate over time and are associated with disability progression. The quantification of CLs might represent an additional useful paraclinical tool to monitor MS evolution.",M2
20372170,"Impact of arginase II on CBF in experimental <e>cortical</e> impact injury in mice using MRI.Traumatic brain injury (TBI) results in reduced cerebral blood flow (CBF) and low levels of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO) may be involved. Arginase II negatively regulates NO production through competition for the substrate L-arginine. We determined whether arginase II-deficient (ArgII(-/-)) mice would show improved CBF after TBI through arterial spin-labeling magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The ArgII(-/-) mice exhibit a significantly improved CBF recovery after trauma in the perilesional brain (P=0.0015) and in various other brain regions. In conclusion, arginase II deficiency leads to a better CBF recovery after TBI and implicates arginase II in hemodynamic processes.",M2
20371829,"Molecular dissection of I(A) in <e>cortical</e> pyramidal neurons reveals three distinct components encoded by Kv4.2, Kv4.3, and Kv1.4 alpha-subunits.The rapidly activating and inactivating voltage-gated K(+) (Kv) current, I(A), is broadly expressed in neurons and is a key regulator of action potential repolarization, repetitive firing, backpropagation (into dendrites) of action potentials, and responses to synaptic inputs. Interestingly, results from previous studies on a number of neuronal cell types, including hippocampal, cortical, and spinal neurons, suggest that macroscopic I(A) is composed of multiple components and that each component is likely encoded by distinct Kv channel alpha-subunits. The goals of the experiments presented here were to test this hypothesis and to determine the molecular identities of the Kv channel alpha-subunits that generate I(A) in cortical pyramidal neurons. Combining genetic disruption of individual Kv alpha-subunit genes with pharmacological approaches to block Kv currents selectively, the experiments here revealed that Kv1.4, Kv4.2, and Kv4.3 alpha-subunits encode distinct components of I(A) that together underlie the macroscopic I(A) in mouse (male and female) cortical pyramidal neurons. Recordings from neurons lacking both Kv4.2 and Kv4.3 (Kv4.2(-/-)/Kv4.3(-/-)) revealed that, although Kv1.4 encodes a minor component of I(A), the Kv1.4-encoded current was found in all the Kv4.2(-/-)/Kv4.3(-/-) cortical pyramidal neurons examined. Of the cortical pyramidal neurons lacking both Kv4.2 and Kv1.4, 90% expressed a Kv4.3-encoded I(A) larger in amplitude than the Kv1.4-encoded component. The experimental findings also demonstrate that the targeted deletion of the individual Kv alpha-subunits encoding components of I(A) results in electrical remodeling that is Kv alpha-subunit specific.",M2
20371827,"Multiple timescale encoding of slowly varying whisker stimulus envelope in <e>cortical</e> and thalamic neurons in vivo.Adaptive processes over many timescales endow neurons with sensitivity to stimulus changes over a similarly wide range of scales. Although spike timing of single neurons can precisely signal rapid fluctuations in their inputs, the mean firing rate can convey information about slower-varying properties of the stimulus. Here, we investigate the firing rate response to a slowly varying envelope of whisker motion in two processing stages of the rat vibrissa pathway. The whiskers of anesthetized rats were moved through a noise trajectory with an amplitude that was sinusoidally modulated at one of several frequencies. In thalamic neurons, we found that the rate response to the stimulus envelope was also sinusoidal, with an approximately frequency-independent phase advance with respect to the input. Responses in cortex were similar but with a phase shift that was about three times larger, consistent with a larger amount of rate adaptation. These response properties can be described as a linear transformation of the input for which a single parameter quantifies the phase shift as well as the degree of adaptation. These results are reproduced by a model of adapting neurons connected by synapses with short-term plasticity, showing that the observed linear response and phase lead can be built up from a network that includes a sequence of nonlinear adapting elements. Our study elucidates how slowly varying envelope information under passive stimulation is preserved and transformed through the vibrissa processing pathway.",M2
20371813,"Structural plasticity underlies experience-dependent functional plasticity of <e>cortical</e> circuits.The stabilization of new spines in the barrel cortex is enhanced after whisker trimming, but its relationship to experience-dependent plasticity is unclear. Here we show that in wild-type mice, whisker potentiation and spine stabilization are most pronounced for layer 5 neurons at the border between spared and deprived barrel columns. In homozygote alphaCaMKII-T286A mice, which lack experience-dependent potentiation of responses to spared whiskers, there is no increase in new spine stabilization at the border between barrel columns after whisker trimming. Our data provide a causal link between new spine synapses and plasticity of adult cortical circuits and suggest that alphaCaMKII autophosphorylation plays a role in the stabilization but not formation of new spines.",M2
20371807,"Development of global <e>cortical</e> networks in early infancy.Human cognition and behaviors are subserved by global networks of neural mechanisms. Although the organization of the brain is a subject of interest, the process of development of global cortical networks in early infancy has not yet been clarified. In the present study, we explored developmental changes in these networks from several days to 6 months after birth by examining spontaneous fluctuations in brain activity, using multichannel near-infrared spectroscopy. We set up 94 measurement channels over the frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital regions of the infant brain. The obtained signals showed complex time-series properties, which were characterized as 1/f fluctuations. To reveal the functional connectivity of the cortical networks, we calculated the temporal correlations of continuous signals between all the pairs of measurement channels. We found that the cortical network organization showed regional dependency and dynamic changes in the course of development. In the temporal, parietal, and occipital regions, connectivity increased between homologous regions in the two hemispheres and within hemispheres; in the frontal regions, it decreased progressively. Frontoposterior connectivity changed to a  U-shaped  pattern within 6 months: it decreases from the neonatal period to the age of 3 months and increases from the age of 3 months to the age of 6 months. We applied cluster analyses to the correlation coefficients and showed that the bilateral organization of the networks begins to emerge during the first 3 months of life. Our findings suggest that these developing networks, which form multiple clusters, are precursors of the functional cerebral architecture.",M2

Seizure activity in insular epilepsy may mimic temporal, parietal, or other cortical areas. Semiology, electroencephalography, and even surface electrocorticography recordings may falsely localize other cortical foci, leading to inaccurate diagnosis and treatment. The use of insular depth electrodes allows more precise localization of seizure foci. The authors describe the case of a young girl with seizures falsely localized to the cortex, with foci arising from the insula, as proven by depth electrode recordings. Resection of the insula yielded seizure control.",M2
20363222,"Nox4-dependent H2O2 production contributes to chronic glutamate toxicity in primary <e>cortical</e> neurons.Reactive oxygen species (ROS) can trigger neuronal cell death and has been implicated in a variety of neurodegenerative diseases as well as brain ischemia. Here, we demonstrate that chronic (but not acute) glutamate toxicity in primary cortical neuronal cultures is associated with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) accumulation in the culture medium and that neurotoxicity can be eliminated by external catalase treatment. Neuronal cultures in Ca(2+)-free medium or treated with BAPTA showed reduced glutamate-induced H(2)O(2) generation, indicating that H(2)O(2) generation is Ca(2+)-dependent. Pharmacological and genetic approaches revealed that NADPH oxidase plays a role in glutamate-induced H(2)O(2) generation and that activation of NMDA and AMPA receptors is involved in this H(2)O(2) generation. The Nox4 siRNA reduced NMDA-induced H(2)O(2) production by 54% and cytotoxicity in parallel, suggesting that Nox4-containing NADPH oxidase functions NMDA receptor-mediated H(2)O(2) production resulting in neurotoxicity. These findings suggest that the modulation of NADPH oxidase can be used as a new therapeutic strategy for glutamate-induced neuronal diseases.",M2
20362555,"Diverse FGF receptor signaling controls astrocyte specification and proliferation.During CNS development, pluripotency neuronal progenitor cells give rise in succession to neurons and glia. Fibroblast growth factor-2 (FGF-2), a major signal that maintains neural progenitors in the undifferentiated state, is also thought to influence the transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis. Here we present evidence that FGF receptors and underlying signaling pathways transmit the FGF-2 signals that regulate astrocyte specification aside from its mitogenic activity. Application of FGF-2 to <e>cortical</e> progenitors suppressed neurogenesis whereas treatment with an FGFR antagonist in vitro promoted neurogenesis. Introduction of chimeric FGFRs with mutated tyrosine residues into cortical progenitors and drug treatments to specifically block individual downstream signaling pathways revealed that the overall activity of FGFR rather than individual autophosphorylation sites is important for delivering signals for glial specification. In contrast, a signal for cell proliferation by FGFR was mainly delivered by MAPK pathway. Together our findings indicate that FGFR activity promotes astrocyte specification in the developing CNS.",M2
20361984,"Decreased binding of [11C]NNC112 and [11C]SCH23390 in patients with chronic schizophrenia.AIMS: Abnormality of cognitive function in schizophrenia has been suggested to be related to dopamine D1 receptor. However, the results of previous positron emission tomography (PET) studies of dopamine D1 receptor in schizophrenia were not consistent. MAIN METHODS: In this study, six patients with schizophrenia in severe residual phase with chronic antipsychotic treatment and twelve healthy age-matched controls participated. Two different radioligands, [11C]NNC112 and [11C]SCH23390, for dopamine D1 receptor were used on the same subjects. Binding of the ligands was measured by PET, and statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of covariate (ANCOVA) with age as covariate. KEY FINDINGS: Good correlations between binding potential values (BP(ND)) and age were observed in all regions of interest (ROIs) with both ligands. ANCOVA with age as covariate of BP(ND) values of all ROIs revealed that the patient group showed significantly lower BP(ND) value compared with the control group in both ligands. SIGNIFICANCE: In patients with chronic schizophrenia in severe residual phase with chronic antipsychotic treatment, the binding potential values of both ligands were significantly lower in the striatum and <e>cortical</e> regions than those of healthy controls.",M2
20360616,"Effects of 2-chloroadenosine on <e>cortical</e> epileptic afterdischarges in immature rats.Adenosine may represent an endogenous anticonvulsant in the brain. This study focused on the possible anticonvulsant action of an adenosine agonist, 2-chloroadenosine, against cortical epileptic afterdischarges (ADs) in immature rats. Three age groups of rat pups with implanted electrodes were studied: 12-, 18- and 25-days-old. The compound, 2-chloroadenosine, was injected after the first successful stimulation at doses of 1, 4 or 10 mg/kg intraperitoneally, and stimulation at the same intensity was repeated three more times. Movements directly elicited by stimulation, as well as clonic seizures accompanying electroencephalography (EEG) ADs, were markedly suppressed in only the 18-day-old animals. The effects in the 12- and especially the 25-day-old rats were moderate. The duration of the ADs decreased in all three age groups with 2-chloroadenosine treatment, and the shortest AD duration was seen in the treated, 12-day-old rats. The AD suppression also lasted longer in this age group than it did in the older animals. After a brief suppression of the second AD, the treated, 25-day-old group exhibited a significant AD rebound during the third and fourth stimulations. Taken together, our data show that 2-chloroadenosine exhibits an anticonvulsant effect that is dose- and age-dependent.",M2
20360466,"A treatment sequence for phonological alexia/agraphia.PURPOSE: Damage to left perisylvian cortex often results in impaired phonological processing abilities with written language profiles consistent with phonological alexia and phonological agraphia. The purpose of this article was to examine a behavioral treatment sequence for such individuals intended to strengthen phonological processing and links between phonology and orthography, as well as train a means to maximize use of residual orthographic and phonological knowledge for spelling. METHOD: Two women with persistent impairments of written language and phonological processing following damage to left perisylvian <e>cortical</e> regions participated in this study. Both exhibited characteristic features of phonological alexia and agraphia in that reading and spelling performance for real words was better preserved than nonwords (lexicality effect). A 2-stage treatment protocol was administered to strengthen sublexical skills (phonological treatment) and to train interactive use of lexical and sublexical information to maximize spelling performance (interactive treatment). RESULTS: Both participants improved phonological processing abilities and reading/spelling via the sublexical route. They also improved spelling of real words and were able to detect and correct most residual errors using an electronic spelling aid. CONCLUSIONS: Behavioral treatment served to strengthen phonological skills supporting reading and spelling, and provided a functional compensatory strategy to overcome residual weaknesses.",M2
20357117,"Prospective isolation of <e>cortical</e> interneuron precursors from mouse embryonic stem cells.Despite their therapeutic potential, progress in generating fully differentiated forebrain neurons from embryonic stem cells (ESCs) has lagged behind that from more caudal regions of the neuraxis. GABAergic interneuron precursors have the remarkable ability to migrate extensively and survive after transplantation into postnatal cortex, making them an attractive candidate for use in cell-based therapy for seizures or other neuropsychiatric disorders. We have modified a mouse ESC line with an Lhx6-GFP reporter construct that allows for the isolation of newly generated cortical interneuron precursors. When transplanted into postnatal cortex, these cells can migrate into the cortical parenchyma, survive for months, and display morphological, neurochemical, and electrophysiological properties characteristic of mature interneurons. This work demonstrates that forebrain neuronal subtypes with complex traits can be generated from embryonic stem cells, and provides a novel approach to the study of cortical interneuron development and to the establishment of cell-based therapies for neurological disease.",M2

The state of  animal hypnosis  could be easily elicited against the background of the latent focus of the  left  dominanta on the next day after its formation. The  animal hypnosis  restored the  left  dominanta after its extinction. It was accompanied by formation of a new pattern of the <e>cortical</e> EEG coherence in the delta range, which was different from the patterns characteristic of each kind of dominanta. After the  animal hypnosis  session, the formation of the  left  dominanta produced two kinds of nonstable foci.

METHODS: Six days after rat cortical neuronal cultures, two groups were created based on the medium to which were transiently exposed. The control group was exposed to a physiological solution (PS), and the Mg(2+)-free group was exposed to the same medium as the control group except for the removal of magnesium. The expression of GR mRNA and protein was determined by real-time PCR and immunocytochemistry staining 1, 7 and 12 days after transient Mg(2+)-free treatment. RESULTS: Compared to the control group, the Mg(2+)-free group displayed the significantly less accumulated optical density (AOD) of GR immunoreactivity 12 days after transient Mg(2+)-free treatment (p&lt;0.05). On the contrary, GR mRNA expression increased significantly 1 and 7 days after transient Mg(2+)-free treatment in the Mg(2+)-free group (p&lt;0.05).

20348608,"Temporal coupling between stimulus-evoked neural activity and hemodynamic responses from individual <e>cortical</e> columns.Using previously published data from the whisker barrel cortex of anesthetized rodents (Berwick et al 2008 J. Neurophysiol. 99 787-98) we investigated whether highly spatially localized stimulus-evoked cortical hemodynamics responses displayed a linear time-invariant (LTI) relationship with neural activity. Presentation of stimuli to individual whiskers of 2 s and 16 s durations produced hemodynamics and neural activity spatially localized to individual cortical columns. Two-dimensional optical imaging spectroscopy (2D-OIS) measured hemoglobin responses, while multi-laminar electrophysiology recorded neural activity. Hemoglobin responses to 2 s stimuli were deconvolved with underlying evoked neural activity to estimate impulse response functions which were then convolved with neural activity evoked by 16 s stimuli to generate predictions of hemodynamic responses. An LTI system more adequately described the temporal neuro-hemodynamics coupling relationship for these spatially localized sensory stimuli than in previous studies that activated the entire whisker cortex. An inability to predict the magnitude of an initial 'peak' in the total and oxy- hemoglobin responses was alleviated when excluding responses influenced by overlying arterial components. However, this did not improve estimation of the hemodynamic responses return to baseline post-stimulus cessation.",M2
20348416,"Af9/Mllt3 interferes with Tbr1 expression through epigenetic modification of histone H3K79 during development of the cerebral cortex.Mutations of leukemia-associated AF9/MLLT3 are implicated in neurodevelopmental diseases, such as epilepsy and ataxia, but little is known about how AF9 influences brain development and function. Analyses of mouse mutants revealed that during <e>cortical</e> development, AF9 is involved in the maintenance of TBR2-positive progenitors (intermediate precursor cells, IPCs) in the subventricular zone and prevents premature cell cycle exit of IPCs. Furthermore, in postmitotic neurons of the developing cortical plate, AF9 is implicated in the formation of the six-layered cerebral cortex by suppressing a TBR1-positive cell fate mainly in upper layer neurons. We show that the molecular mechanism of TBR1 suppression is based on the interaction of AF9 with DOT1L, a protein that mediates transcriptional control through methylation of histone H3 lysine 79 (H3K79). AF9 associates with the transcriptional start site of Tbr1, mediates H3K79 dimethylation of the Tbr1 gene, and interferes with the presence of RNA polymerase II at the Tbr1 transcriptional start site. AF9 expression favors cytoplasmic localization of TBR1 and its association with mitochondria. Increased expression of TBR1 in Af9 mutants is associated with increased levels of TBR1-regulated expression of NMDAR subunit Nr1. Thus, this study identified AF9 as a developmental active epigenetic modifier during the generation of cortical projection neurons.",M2
20348134,"Biphasic direct current shift, haemoglobin desaturation and neurovascular uncoupling in <e>cortical</e> spreading depression.Cortical spreading depression is a propagating wave of depolarization that plays important roles in migraine, stroke, subarachnoid haemorrhage and brain injury. Cortical spreading depression is associated with profound vascular changes that may be a significant factor in the clinical response to cortical spreading depression events. We used a combination of optical intrinsic signal imaging, electro-physiology, potassium sensitive electrodes and spectroscopy to investigate neurovascular changes associated with cortical spreading depression in the mouse. We identified two distinct phases of altered neurovascular function, one during the propagating cortical spreading depression wave and a second much longer phase after passage of the wave. The direct current shift associated with the cortical spreading depression wave was accompanied by marked arterial constriction and desaturation of cortical haemoglobin. After recovery from the initial cortical spreading depression wave, we observed a second phase of prolonged, negative direct current shift, arterial constriction and haemoglobin desaturation, lasting at least an hour. Persistent disruption of neurovascular coupling was demonstrated by a loss of coherence between electro-physiological activity and perfusion. Extracellular potassium concentration increased during the cortical spreading depression wave, but recovered and remained at baseline after passage of the wave, consistent with different mechanisms underlying the first and second phases of neurovascular dysfunction. These findings indicate that cortical spreading depression is associated with a multiphasic alteration in neurovascular function, including a novel second direct current shift accompanied by arterial constriction and decrease in tissue oxygen supply, that is temporally and mechanistically distinct from the initial propagated cortical spreading depression wave. Vascular/metabolic uncoupling with cortical spreading depression may have important clinical consequences, and the different phases of dysfunction may represent separate therapeutic targets in the disorders where cortical spreading depression occurs.",M2

20335480,"The subthreshold relation between <e>cortical</e> local field potential and neuronal firing unveiled by intracellular recordings in awake rats.In most of the in vivo electrophysiological studies of cortical processing, which are extracellular, the spike-triggered local field potential average (LFP STA) is the measure used to estimate the correlation between the synaptic inputs of individual neuron and the local population. To understand how the magnitude and shape of LFP STA reflect the underlying correlation of synaptic activities, the membrane potential of the firing neuron has to be recorded together with the LFP. Using intracellular recordings from the cortex of awake rats, we found that for a large range of firing rates and for different behavioral states, the LFP STA represents both in its waveform and its magnitude the cross-correlation between the membrane potential of the neuron and the LFP. This data, supported by further analysis, suggests that LFP STA does not represent large network events specific to the spike times, but rather the synchrony between the mean synaptic activity of the population and the membrane potential of the single neuron, present both around spike times and in the intervals between spikes. Furthermore, it introduces a novel interpretation of the available data from unit and LFP extracellular recording experiments.",M2
20335478,"Longitudinal magnetic resonance imaging study of <e>cortical</e> development through early childhood in autism.Cross-sectional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies have long hypothesized that the brain in children with autism undergoes an abnormal growth trajectory that includes a period of early overgrowth; however, this has never been confirmed by a longitudinal study. We performed the first longitudinal study of brain growth in toddlers at the time symptoms of autism are becoming clinically apparent using structural MRI scans at multiple time points beginning at 1.5 years up to 5 years of age. We collected 193 scans on 41 toddlers who received a confirmed diagnosis of autistic disorder at approximately 48 months of age and 44 typically developing controls. By 2.5 years of age, both cerebral gray and white matter were significantly enlarged in toddlers with autistic disorder, with the most severe enlargement occurring in frontal, temporal, and cingulate cortices. In the longitudinal analyses, which we accounted for age and gender effect, we found that all regions (cerebral gray, cerebral white, frontal gray, temporal gray, cingulate gray, and parietal gray) except occipital gray developed at an abnormal growth rate in toddlers with autistic disorder that was mainly characterized by a quadratic age effect. Females with autistic disorder displayed a more pronounced abnormal growth profile in more brain regions than males with the disorder. Given that overgrowth clearly begins before 2 years of age, future longitudinal studies would benefit from inclusion of even younger populations as well as further characterization of genetic and other biomarkers to determine the underlying neuropathological processes causing the onset of autistic symptoms.",M2

19955443,"Shh signaling regulates adrenocortical development and identifies progenitors of steroidogenic lineages.The adrenal cortex is a critical steroidogenic endocrine tissue, generated at least in part from the coelomic epithelium of the urogenital ridge. Neither the intercellular signals that regulate <e>cortical</e> development and maintenance nor the lineage relationships within the adrenal are well defined. We have explored adrenal Shh activity and found that Shh is expressed in relatively undifferentiated steroidogenic cells, which signal to the overlying capsule and subjacent nonsteroidogenic mesenchyme cells that we also find are progenitors of steroidogenic lineages. Shh-expressing cells also generate all steroidogenic cell types, but not nonsteroidogenic ones. Shh mutant adrenals have a thin capsule and small cortex.

19931309,"ACTH receptor blockade: a novel approach to treat congenital adrenal hyperplasia, or Cushing's disease.It is hypothesized that blocking the adrenocorticotrophic hormone (ACTH) receptor, using either a blocking antibody or a drug will result in a medical <e>cortical</e>-adrenalectomy, with relative sparing of mineralocorticoid hormone production. This would be similar to the clinical findings in familial glucocorticoid deficiency type 1, an autosomal recessive condition due to inactivating mutations of the adrenal receptor for ACTH, also known as the melanocortin 2 receptor (MC2R). It is further hypothesized that MC2R blockade should allow using lower glucocorticoid doses to treat congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) due to enzyme deficiency of either 21-hydroxylase (CYP21B) or 11-hydroxylase (CYP11B1), thus reaching a better final adult height than with current therapeutic strategies.

Histological examination showed a single tumor mass composed of an admixed population of adrenal <e>cortical</e> and medullary cells. Immunohistochemical evaluation was positive for chromogranin A.",M3
19762876,"Calcitonin directly increases adrenocorticotropic hormone-stimulated corticosterone production in the hen adrenal gland.The present study was performed to elucidate whether the receptor for calcitonin (CT) exists in the adrenocortical cells of hens and to determine the effect of CT on adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH)-stimulated corticosterone production in its cell. The binding site of CT in the membrane fraction of the adrenal gland in hens was determined using a [125I]CT binding assay system. The binding properties in the adrenal gland satisfied the criteria of a receptor-ligand interaction in terms of specificity, reversibility, and saturation. When the <e>cortical</e> cells were incubated in vitro with chicken ACTH in the presence of CT, greater corticosterone production was observed. The result suggested that CT acts directly on the adrenocortical cells via its receptor binding and increases responsiveness of ACTH on corticosterone production in the laying hen.",M3
19755404,"Synaptophysin immunoreactivity in adrenocortical adenomas: a correlation between synaptophysin and CYP17A1 expression.DESIGN AND METHODS: The adrenal cortex is not considered to be an intrinsic part of the diffuse neuroendocrine system, but adrenocortical neoplasms possess neuroendocrine properties. In this study, we examined synaptophysin (SYP) and neural cell adhesion molecule (NCAM) expression in adrenocortical adenomas in relation to adrenal function. RESULTS: Immunohistochemical analysis showed that 50.7 and 98.6% of the <e>cortical</e> adenomas showed SYP and NCAM immunoreactivities respectively. There was no apparent difference in NCAM immunoreactivity among the adenomas. However, the immunostaining for SYP was significantly stronger in cortisol-producing adenomas (CPA) than in aldosterone-producing adenomas (APA), nonfunctioning adenomas (NFA), showing no clinical or endocrinological abnormality, or adenomas associated with preclinical Cushing's syndrome (preCS). Western blotting and real-time PCR demonstrated that the expression level of SYP protein and mRNA was significantly higher in CPA than in APA or NFA. Additionally, the SYP mRNA level showed a positive correlation with CYP17A1 mRNA. In addition to the plasma membrane, mitochondria, and smooth endoplasmic reticulum, SYP immunoreactivity was detected in the Golgi area, which is known to be involved in the regulation of mitochondrial cholesterol and the transport of steroid intermediates. It was unexpected that the ratio of positive cells for SYP in preCS was less than that in APA and NFA. However, further examination is required, because the number of preCS cases we investigated was very small. CONCLUSIONS: We propose that SYP expression in adrenocortical cells may be involved in some aspect of adrenal function such as transport or secretion of glucocorticoids.",M3
19705299,"Case report: Adrenal LH/hCG receptor overexpression and gene amplification causing pregnancy-induced Cushing's syndrome.Transient pregnancy-induced Cushing's syndrome (CS) is extremely rare, with only several cases reported in the literature. Ectopic LH/hCG-receptors (LHCGR) in the adrenal gland have been suggested to be involved in the pathogenesis of this condition. We report the clinical, molecular, and genetic features of a patient with pregnancy-induced CS. A 29-year-old female patient developed CS during multiple pregnancies, leading to repeated miscarriage. Signs and symptoms of hypercortisolism resolved soon after delivery or abortion, only to recur in subsequent pregnancies. In the non-pregnant state, hCG stimulation testing resulted in elevated cortisol levels. Serum cortisol was not suppressible with dexamethasone. The adrenals exhibited bilateral adrenal <e>cortical</e> nodular hyperplasia. Quantitative RT-PCR revealed a 2-fold increase in LHCGR and progesterone receptor mRNA expression and decreased estrogen receptor-beta expression in the patient's adrenal tissue relative to normal adrenals. Higher intensity of immunostaining for LHCGR was observed, particularly within the nodular lesions, compared to controls. Quantitative PCR revealed a LHCGR-to-beta-actin ratio of 1.5 in genomic DNA from adrenal and peripheral leukocytes, suggesting the presence of a germline duplication of the LHCGR gene. LHCGR overexpression resulting from germline gene duplication may be a potential pathogenic mechanism underlying this case of pregnancy-induced CS.",M3
19592014,"Transplantation of adrenal <e>cortical</e> progenitor cells enriched by Nile red.BACKGROUND: The adrenal cortex may contain progenitor cells useful for tissue regeneration. Currently there are no established methods to isolate these cells. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Murine adrenal cells were sorted into a Nile-red-bright (NR(bright)) and a Nile-red-dim (NR(dim)) population of cells according to their degree of cholesterol content revealed by Nile red fluorescence. The cells were transplanted under the renal capsule to determine their ability for regeneration. RESULTS: The NR(bright) cells contained an abundance of lipid droplets, whereas the NR(dim) cells contained little. The NR(bright) cells expressed Sf1 and the more differentiated adrenal cortical genes, including Cyp11a1, Cyp11b1, and Cyp11b2, whereas the NR(dim) cells expressed Sf1 but not the more differentiated adrenal cortical genes. After 56 d of implantation in unilateral adrenalectomized mice, the NR(dim) cells expressed Sf1 and the more differentiated adrenal cortical genes, whereas the NR(bright) cells ceased to express Sf1 as well as the more differentiated adrenal cortical genes. NR(dim) cells also proliferated in the presence of basic fibroblast growth factor. CONCLUSIONS: The population of NR(dim) cells contained adrenal cortical progenitor cells that can proliferate and give rise to differentiated daughter cells. These cells may be useful for adrenal cortical regeneration.",M3
19416745,"Expression of prepro-ghrelin and related receptor genes in the rat adrenal gland and evidences that ghrelin exerts a potent stimulating effect on corticosterone secretion by cultured rat adrenocortical cells.The orexigenic peptide ghrelin (GHREL) and obestatin (OBS) originate from the same peptide precursor, preproghrelin (ppGHREL). Apart from orexigenic effect, GHREL also regulates neuroendocrine function. We investigated GHREL and OBS effects on corticosterone secretion by freshly isolated and cultured rat adrenocortical cells. Classic RT-PCR revealed the presence of ppGHREL, GHS-R1a, GPR39v1 and GPR39v2 and GOAT4 (ghrelin O-acyl transferase) mRNAs in rat adrenals and cultured for 4 days rat adrenocortical cells. Expression of ppGHREL, GHS-R1a, and GOAT genes was notably higher in the cortex than in medulla. High expression level of GOAT gene was found in the zona glomerulosa, while expression level of both GPR39v1 and GPR39v2 genes was similar in adrenal <e>cortical</e> zones and in medulla. In freshly isolated cells neither GHREL nor OBS had an effect on corticosteroid output. Prolonged exposure of cultured cells to GHREL resulted in a potent, comparable to ACTH, stimulating effect of GHREL on corticosterone secretion. Prolonged exposure to OBS was ineffective. Neither GHREL nor OBS had any effect on proliferation of studied cells, while ACTH notably lowered it. GHREL down regulated GHS-R1a gene expression while both ACTH and GHREL stimulated expression level of GPR39v1 gene. Expression of CYP11A1 gene was notably stimulated and that of StAR gene remained unaffected by ACTH or GHREL. Thus, our study is the first to demonstrate direct stimulating effect of GHREL on corticosterone output by cultured rat adrenocortical cells. This stimulating action differs from that evoked by ACTH and is not dependent on the presence of functional ACTH receptor.",M3
19196135,"Basic fibroblast growth factor delivery enhances adrenal <e>cortical</e> cellular regeneration.The effective delivery of angiogenic factors is a useful strategy for the engineering of vascularized tissues. When adrenal cortical cells were implanted in mice under the renal capsule, the size of the implant was reduced to about 100 microm in thickness after 8 weeks. Either low (approximately 2 microg) levels of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) or high (approximately12 microg) levels of bFGF were encapsulated into poly-lactic-co-glycolic acid microspheres, and these bFGF-encapsulated microspheres were coimplanted with adrenal cortical cells. After 56 days, the implants with low and high levels of bFGF weighed five and eight times more, respectively, than the implants without bFGF delivery. The implants with bFGF-encapsulated microspheres also contained significantly more cells than the implants without bFGF delivery. The levels of adrenal cortical gene expression were not significantly changed with bFGF delivery. The implants with high levels of bFGF also had a more uniform distribution of anti-CD31 immunofluorescence. Based on the increased number of cells that expressed adrenal cortical genes, the delivery of bFGF enhanced adrenal cortical cellular regeneration, possibly through an angiogenic response.",M3

However, adrenal nodules are not uncommon at autopsy, and the number of these found in life is now increasing as they are identified when the abdomen is scanned for the investigation of other diseases using computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging. It is therefore becoming increasingly important for the surgical pathologist to be aware of the range of pathology in the gland and to understand how to approach the specimens. This short review will deal with lesions of the adrenal cortex.",M3
19082512,"Neuromedin U enhances proliferation of ACTH-stimulated adrenocortical cells in the rat.Neuromedin U (NMU) is a brain-gut peptide involved in the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenocortical cell proliferation. In this study, we investigated the effects of NMU8 (three subcutaneous injections of 6.0 nmol/100 g, 24, 16 and 8 h before autopsy) on the adrenal glands of rats treated for 2 or 4 days with a low (2 microg/100 g body weight/24 h) or a high (8 microg) dose of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). As revealed by RT-PCR, ACTH treatment did not prevent expression of NMUR1 in rat adrenal cortex. At day 4 of ACTH administration, the weight of adrenals was lower than at day 2. NMU8 administration prevented ACTH-induced increases of adrenal weight at day 2 of the experiment. ACTH plasma concentrations were increased in all ACTH-administered rats. NMU8 administration increased ACTH plasma concentration at day 2 of the lower ACTH dose-treated group while it reduced the ACTH plasma level at day 4 in the higher ACTH dose-administered rats. In all groups of ACTH-treated rats, NMU8 changed neither aldosterone nor corticosterone plasma concentrations. In the zona glomerulosa (ZG), NMU8 increased metaphase index at days 2 and 4 in the lower ACTH dose-treated group and had no statistically significant effect in rats treated with the higher ACTH dose. In the zona fasciculata (ZF), NMU8 administration increased metaphase index at day 2 in the lower ACTH dose-treated group but reduced metaphase index at day 4 in the higher dose ACTH-administered rats. NMU8 reduced the number of cells per unit area both in ZG and ZF at day 2 in the higher ACTH dose-treated rats. In the remaining groups NMU8 did not produce statistically significant changes in the number of cells per unit area. Thus, our findings demonstrate that exogenous NMU may stimulate proliferation primarily of the <e>cortical</e> ZG cells in rats administered with ACTH, although at high doses of exogenous corticotropin an opposite effect occurred.",M3
19041690,"A transgenic mouse line with specific Cre recombinase expression in the adrenal cortex.The Cre-loxP system combined with gene targeting strategies has proven to be very useful for gene inactivation in specific tissues and/or cell types. To achieve adrenal cortex specific recombination in vivo, we used a 0.5-kb fragment of the 5'-flanking region of the akr1b7 gene to drive Cre expression in adrenocortical cells. The resulting 0.5 akr1b7-Cre mice express Cre in all steroidogenic zones of the adrenal cortex but not in the gonads. Although recombination of the ROSA26R reporter locus was not observed in all <e>cortical</e> cells, we provide evidence that Cre is expressed in all the cells of the cortex in adult mice. In addition, Cre activity was found in collecting ducts and maturing glomeruli of the kidney. This line is the first to show specific Cre expression in the adrenal cortex in the absence of Cre expression in the gonads. This transgene thus provides a valuable tool for specific gene recombination in the adrenal cortex and kidney.",M3

18972688,"Effect of photoperiod on the adrenal activities of male rose ringed parakeet, Psittacala krameri.Adult male rose ringed parakeets were exposed to very long photoperiod (22 hr L: 2 hr D) and very short photoperiod (2 hr L: 22 hr D) daily for 60 days during different phases of the annual testicular cycle. Adrenal activities of the experimental birds were compared with that of parallel held natural photoperiodic birds. Marked atrophy of adrenocortical cells was noted in the glands of long photoperiod (22 hr L:2 hr D) during different phases, i.e., post-breeding, quiescent and pre-breeding phases of annual gonadal cycle. The atrophied cells were not uniformly distributed in different groups of long photoperiod responsive birds. During pre-breeding, post-breeding and quiescent phases marked atrophy of the adrenocortical cells were restricted to the sub capsular zone of the gland. The cytometric and karyometric studies also revealed significant decrease in the <e>cortical</e> cord width and diameter of nuclei in the cortical cells in either subcapsular zone in the gland of long photoperiodic birds considered for treatment during pre-breeding, post-breeding and quiescent phase or in both the sub capsular zone and the inner zone.

18931550,"Ectopic adrenal cortex tissue: an incidental finding during inguinoscrotal operations in pediatric patients.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study was to assess the occurrence of ectopic remnants of adrenal cortex tissue encountered in pediatric patients who underwent groin surgical explorations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied 1,862 patients with groin surgical explorations during a period of 12 consecutive years (1995-2006). Nodules resembling ectopic adrenal tissue were removed and the histopathological examination was performed using hematoxylin and eosin staining. RESULTS: We found ectopic adrenal cortex tissue along the spermatic cord in 31 patients in 1,862 groin surgical explorations, an overall incidence of 1.66%. None were found in females. Of the 31 cases, 20 were diagnosed as having undescended testes, 8 communicating hydrocele, and 3 inguinal hernia. Median age at diagnosis was 6.5 years (range 2-14). The nodules were found located along the spermatic cord, in the apex of the hernial sac, and between the testis and epididymis. Macroscopically, the nodules were round to oval in shape, 2-6 mm in diameter, and bright yellow to orange in color. Microscopically, they had three well-defined layers of adrenal cortex, with predominance of the zona fasciculata, surrounded by a fibrous capsule and none contained any medulla. CONCLUSION: Ectopic adrenal <e>cortical</e> tissue is a benign lesion. Although a routine search for this lesion is not indicated, it should be resected for histological analysis and differential diagnosis when it is found during a surgical procedure in this area.",M3

18824863,"Adrenarche: postnatal adrenal zonation and hormonal and metabolic regulation.Adrenarche is the direct consequence of the organogenesis of the zona reticularis (ZR). Proliferation of <e>cortical</e> cells could take place in the outermost layers of the adrenal cortex. Cells could then migrate to differentiate the zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona fasciculata (ZF) during fetal life, and the ZR during postnatal life. After adrenarche, there are detectable increases in circulating DHEA and DHEA-S. Adrenarche could result from an increase in 17,20-lyase activity of P450c17 secondary to high levels of cytochrome b(5) expression, and from a decrease in 3betaHSD2 expression along with an increase in the expression of SULT2A1 in the ZR. The GH-IGF system and insulin, among other factors, might also modulate adrenal androgen production. Furthermore, high concentrations of estradiol enhance basal and ACTH-stimulated DHEA-S production, while aromatase expression was observed in the human adrenal medulla but not in the ZR, suggesting that estrogens produced in the adrenal medulla might be involved in the regulation of androgen production in the ZR. Premature adrenarche might be associated with ovarian hyperandrogenism and polycystic ovarian syndrome in females, as well as with insulin resistance in both sexes. However, many questions remain, transforming adrenal androgens into markers of diseases important for human health.",M3
18688642,"Oncocytic adrenal <e>cortical</e> tumor with cytoplasmic inclusions and hyaline globules.Adrenal cortical tumors, particularly oncocytic tumors, have been reported to contain a variety of intracytoplasmic and intramitochondrial inclusions. Oncocytic cortical tumors can also morphologically mimic pheochromocytomas. We report an unusual, partially oncocytic cortical neoplasm with nesting architecture, intranuclear inclusions, and hyaline globules reminiscent of pheochromocytoma, together with numerous, small, brightly eosinophilic, periodic acid-Schiff-positive cytoplasmic inclusions and typical cytoplasmic lipid droplets. Ultrastructural study revealed oncocytes containing numerous mitochondria with intramitochondrial crystals and lipid droplets. Immunohistochemistry and immunoblots were utilized to further characterize the tumor. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated immunoreactivity of both the eosinophilic inclusions and the hyaline globules for adipose differentiation-related protein (ADRP), which is one of a group of proteins associated with storage of neutral lipids in many cell types. Immunoblots confirmed the presence of ADRP and demonstrated an imbalance between ADRP and perilipin, another neutral lipid-associated protein, in tumor tissue compared to normal adrenal cortex. The findings suggest that mitochondrial dysfunction in oncocytic cortical tumors may lead to abnormal processing of proteins related to the lipid-storing functions of the adrenal cortex, resulting in unusual cytoplasmic inclusions and extracellular globules resembling the globules in pheochromocytomas. The finding of ADRP as a constituent of inclusions in adrenal cortical tumors has not been previously reported.",M3

Molecular genetic investigations are providing new information on both pathogenesis of adrenal tumors and basic adrenal development and physiology. OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of current knowledge on adrenal cortical development and structure that informs our understanding of genetic diseases of the adrenal cortex and adrenal cortical tumors. DATA SOURCES: Literature review using PubMed via the Endnote bibliography tool. CONCLUSIONS: The understanding of basic developmental and physiologic processes permits a better understanding of diseases of the adrenal cortex.

18661056,"Electron microscopic radioautographic study on mitochondrial DNA synthesis in adrenal <e>cortical</e> cells of developing and aging mice.In order to study the aging changes of intramitochondrial DNA synthesis of mouse adrenal cortical cells, eight groups of developing mice, each consisting of three individuals (total 24), from fetal day 19 to postnatal newborn at days 1, 3, 9, 14, to adult at months 1, 2, and 6, were injected with 3H-thymidine, sacrificed 1 h later, and the adrenal tissues were fixed and processed for electron microscopic (EM) radioautography. On EM radioautograms obtained from each animal, the number of mitochondria and the mitochondrial labeling index labeled with 3H-thymidine showing DNA synthesis in each adrenal cortical cell, in three zones, were counted and the results in respective developing groups were compared. From the results, it was demonstrated that the numbers of mitochondria in the three zones, the zona glomerulosa, fasciculata, and reticularis, of mice at various ages increased from fetal day 19 to postnatal month 6 due to development and aging of animals, respectively, while the number of labeled mitochondria and the labeling index of intramitochondrial DNA syntheses incorporating 3H-thymidine increased from fetal day 19 to postnatal month 2, reaching the maxima, and decreased to month 6.

In this study, we used in situ hybridization to investigate the mRNA expression of steroidogenic enzymes in the adrenal cortices attached to cortisol-producing adenoma (CPA) and clinically silent adenoma (non-functioning adenoma; NFA), in addition to APA. RESULTS: Microscopic subcapsular micronodules, which were several hundreds of micrometers in size and spheroid in shape, were observed in the cortices attached to CPA and NFA, as well as APA, at high frequency. Most of the <e>cortical</e> nodules in zona fasciculata to zona reticularis showed a suppressed steroidogenesis in the cortices attached to adenoma, but some expressed intensely all necessary steroidogenic enzyme mRNAs for cortisol synthesis.

18490519,"Angiotensin II relaxations of bovine adrenal <e>cortical</e> arteries: role of angiotensin II metabolites and endothelial nitric oxide.Angiotensin (Ang) II regulates adrenal steroidogenesis and adrenal cortical arterial tone. Vascular metabolism could decrease Ang II concentrations and produce metabolites with vascular activity. Our goals were to study adrenal artery Ang II metabolism and to characterize metabolite vascular activity. Bovine adrenal cortical arteries were incubated with Ang II (100 nmol/L) for 10 and 30 minutes. Metabolites were analyzed by mass spectrometry. Ang (1-7), Ang III, and Ang IV concentrations were 146+/-21, 173+/-42 and 58+/-11 pg/mg at 10 minutes and 845+/-163, 70+/-14, and 31+/-3 pg/mg at 30 minutes, respectively. Concentration-related relaxations of U46619-preconstricted cortical arteries to Ang II (maximum relaxation=29+/-3%; EC(50)=3.4 pmol/L) were eliminated by endothelium removal and inhibited by the NO synthase inhibitor, nitro-L-arginine (30 micromol/L; maximum relaxation=14+/-7%). Ang II relaxations were enhanced by the angiotensin type-1 receptor antagonist losartan (1 micromol/L; maximum relaxation=41+/-3%; EC(50)=11 pmol/L). Losartan-enhanced Ang II relaxations were inhibited by nitro-L-arginine (maximum relaxation=18+/-5%) and the angiotensin type-2 receptor antagonist PD123319 (10 micromol/L; maximum relaxation=27+/-5%). Ang (1-7) and Ang III caused concentration-related relaxations with less potency (EC(50)=43 and 24 nmol/L, respectively) but similar efficacy (maximum relaxations=39+/-3% and 48+/-5%, respectively) as losartan-enhanced Ang II relaxations. Ang (1-7) relaxations were inhibited by nitro-L-arginine (maximum relaxation=16+/-4%) and the Ang (1-7) receptor antagonist 7(D)-Ala-Ang (1-7) (1 micromol/L; maximum relaxation=10+/-3%) and eliminated by endothelium removal. Thus, Ang II metabolism by adrenal cortical arteries to metabolites with decreased vascular activity represents an inactivation pathway possibly decreasing Ang II presentation to adrenal steroidogenic cells and limits Ang II vascular effects.",M3
18171914,"D4 dopamine receptor enhances angiotensin II-stimulated aldosterone secretion through PKC-epsilon and calcium signaling.Aldosterone secretion is subjected to dopaminergic regulation. Our previous study showed that both human D2 and D4 dopamine receptors (D2R and D4R) modulate aldosterone secretion, but in opposing directions. The inhibitory effect of D2R is mediated by attenuating protein kinase C-micro (PKC-micro) and calcium-dependent signaling. The mechanism of D4R effect on angiotensin II (AII)-stimulated aldosterone secretion is explored in this study. Experiments were done with primary human adrenal <e>cortical</e> cells and human adrenocarcinoma (NCI-H295R) cells. Activation of different PKC isoforms was detected by specific phospho-PKC antibodies and PKC translocation. The role of calcium-dependent signaling was examined by measuring the cytoplasmic inositol 1,4,5-triphosphate (IP(3)) and calcium ([Ca(2+)](i)). The D4R agonist PD-168,077 enhanced AII-stimulated aldosterone synthesis and secretion as early as 30 min following exposure independently of the modulation of aldosterone synthase (CYP11B2) transcription. CYP11B2 mRNA level elevated by AII was augmented by D4R in the later period. These effects were reversed by the D4R antagonist L-745,870. AII activated PKC-alpha/betaII, -epsilon, and -micro but not PKC-delta, -theta, or -zeta/lambda of H295R cells. The D4R agonist selectively enhanced AII-stimulated PKC-epsilon phosphorylation and its translocation to the cell membrane. Furthermore, the D4R agonist enhanced the AII-stimulated elevation of intracellular IP(3) and [Ca(2+)](i). Inhibition of PKC-epsilon translocation by the PKC-epsilon-specific inhibitory peptide attenuated AII-stimulated aldosterone secretion, CYP11B2 mRNA expression, and elevation of intracellular IP(3) and [Ca(2+)](i). We conclude that D4R augmented aldosterone synthesis/secretion induced by AII. The mechanisms responsible for this augmentation are mediated through enhancing PKC-epsilon phosphorylation and [Ca(2+)](i) elevation.",M3
18000306,"Neuroendocrine profiling in inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension rat strain with stress-sensitive arterial hypertension.The functions of the hypothalamic adrenal <e>cortical</e> and sympathetic adrenal medullary systems were studied in rats with inherited stress-induced arterial hypertension (ISIAH strain). A characteristic feature of the ISIAH strain is an increase in arterial blood pressure measured both under basal conditions and after restraint stress in particular. In the control ISIAH rats, the basal plasma ACTH concentration was slightly lower than that in the normotensive Wistar albino Glaxo (WAG) rats, and no differences were found in plasma corticosterone. However, the 0.5-h restraint stress produced higher activation of the adrenal cortex in the ISIAH rats. Gluco- and mineralocorticoid responses to the blood volume reduction stresses and ACTH and corticosterone responses to social stress were stronger in the ISIAH than in the control WAG rats. An increase in epinephrine content in adrenals in the basal state and enhanced response of the sympathetic adrenal medullary system to handling stress were observed in the ISIAH rats. Restraint stress produced significantly higher expression of genes encoding corticotropin-releasing hormone-mRNA in hypothalamus and proopiomelanocortin-mRNA in pituitary in the ISIAH than in the WAG rats. Restraint stress produced a decrease in glucocorticoid receptor (GR) gene expression (GR-mRNA) in hippocampus in the ISIAH, but not in the WAG rats. A persistent increase in tyrosine hydroxylase-mRNA in adrenals of the ISIAH rats was found. It is concluded that the ISIAH rat strain is an appropriate model of stress-sensitive hypertension with the predominant involvement of the hypothalamic adrenal cortical and sympathetic adrenal medullary systems in its pathogenesis.",M3
17890895,"Precursor lesions of the adrenal gland.OBJECTIVE: To review the existing literature for evidence that adrenocortical and adrenomedullary tumours develop through a multistep process of carcinogenesis. RESULTS: In the adrenal cortex hyperplasia and adenomas are frequently observed tumours or tumour-like conditions. In contrast, adrenocortical carcinomas are rare. Based on well-validated histopathological scoring systems, benign and malignant adrenocortical tumours can be separated, although a small subset of tumours remains hard to classify. Although extensive follow-up studies might argue against multistep carcinogenesis, analysis of chromosomal imbalances and gene expression profiling studies in these tumours are inconclusive and could give support for both multistep pathogenesis or de novo genesis of carcinomas. A major limit to most of these studies is the small sample size and the lack of extensive clinical (follow-up) data. In the adrenal medulla, pheochromocytomas (PCC) are the most frequent tumours in adults, with an incidence of 8 per million. They can be divided into benign and malignant PCC, but the distinction can only be made when metastases are present. Arbitrarily, lesions of less than 1 cm in diameter are called hyperplastic, but it should be expected that the majority of these are early lesions and if left in situ would grow to classify as PCC. In contrast to <e>cortical</e> tumours, the frequent 1p and 3q loss as an early event in tumourigenesis of benign PCC is verified in multiple studies. However, studies in malignant PCC yield divergent results, due to the small numbers analysed. CONCLUSION: Taken together, there appears to be a relationship between cortical and medullary hyperplasia on the one hand and cortical adenomas and PCC on the other. However, whether there is a transition from benign to malignant tumours, both cortical and medullary, remains to be determined.",M3

17374700,"Growth analysis of the mouse adrenal gland from weaning to adulthood: time- and gender-dependent alterations of cell size and number in the <e>cortical</e> compartment.The adrenal gland is of critical importance for a plethora of biological processes. We performed the first systematic analysis of adrenal gland growth using unbiased stereological methods in male and female mice from weaning to adulthood (weeks 3, 5, 7, 9, and 11) at the organ, compartment, and cellular levels. Adrenal weights increased from week 3 to week 7 in male and female mice, remained at this level in females, but decreased by 25% between week 7 and week 9 in males. Female adrenal glands displayed a higher weight at any stage investigated. The volume of the zona fasciculata was consistently higher in female vs. male mice. In both genders, the number of zona fasciculata cells reached a maximum at the age of 7 wk and decreased significantly until week 9. Serum corticosterone concentrations decreased from 3 to 11 wk of age both in male and female mice. However, the estimated total amounts of corticosterone in the circulation were similar in 3- and 11-wk-old mice. Furthermore, total circulating corticosterone was higher in females than in males at an age of 5 and 11 wk. In the zona glomerulosa and in the X-zone, time- and gender-dependent growth effects were observed. In conclusion, our results demonstrate that growth and function of the adrenal glands are markedly influenced by gender and age. These factors require careful consideration in studies aiming at the functional dissection of genetic and environmental factors affecting adrenal growth and function.",M3
17327493,"Adrenal transcription regulatory genes modulated by angiotensin II and their role in steroidogenesis.Transcription regulatory genes are crucial modulators of cell physiology and metabolism whose intracellular levels are tightly controlled to respond to extracellular stimuli. We studied transcription regulatory genes modulated by angiotensin II, one of the most important regulators of adrenal <e>cortical</e> cell function, and their role in adrenal steroidogenesis in H295R human adrenocortical cells. Angiotensin II-modulated transcription regulatory genes were identified with high-density oligonucleotide microarrays and the results validated by real-time RT-PCR. Cotransfection reporter assays were performed in H295R cells to analyze the role of these transcription regulatory genes in the control of the expression of 11beta-hydroxylase and aldosterone synthase, the last and unique enzymes of the glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid biosynthetic pathways, respectively. We selected a subset of the most regulated genes for reporter plasmid studies to determine the effect on these enzymes. BHLHB2, BTG2, and SALL1 decreased expression of both enzymes, whereas CITED2, EGR2, ELL2, FOS, FOSB, HDAC5, MAFF, MITF, NFIL3, NR4A1, NR4A2, NR4A3, PER1, and VDR increased expression for both enzymes. By the ratio of aldosterone synthase to 11beta-hydroxylase expression, NFIL3, NR4A1, NR4A2, and NR4A3 show the greatest selectivity toward upregulating expression of the mineralocorticoid biosynthetic pathway preferentially. In summary, this study reports for the first time a set of transcription regulatory genes that are modulated by angiotensin II and their role in adrenal gland steroidogenesis. Abnormal regulation of the mineralocorticoid or glucocorticoid biosynthesis pathways is involved in several pathophysiological conditions; hence the modulated transcription regulatory genes described may correlate with adrenal steroidogenesis pathologies.",M3
17203193,"Effects of neuropeptides B and W on the rat pituitary-adrenocortical axis: in vivo and in vitro studies.Neuropeptides (NP) B and W are hypothalamic peptides involved in the regulation of feeding and neuro-endocrine axes. Evidence has been provided that NPB and NPW act on both the central and the peripheral branches of the rat hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical axis, and we carried out in vivo and in vitro studies to gain insight into this topic. Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction showed the expression of NPB, NPW and their receptors in both adrenal cortex (zonae glomerulosa and fasciculata-reticularis) and adrenal medulla, where immunocytochemistry also detected the presence of abundant NPB- and NPW-immunoreactivity. The acute subcutaneous administration of NPB (0.5 or 1.5 nmol/100 g) did not alter ACTH plasma concentration, while that of NPW (1.5 nmol/100 g) decreased it. Neither NPB nor NPW affected the blood level of aldosterone, while both peptides (0.5 nmol/100 g) raised that of corticosterone. NPB (10(-6) M) lowered ACTH-stimulated aldosterone secretion, and basal and ACTH-stimulated corticosterone production from adrenal quarters containing both <e>cortical</e> and medullary tissues. NPW (10(-6) M) enhanced basal aldosterone secretion from adrenal quarters, and the effect was suppressed by the beta-adrenoceptor antagonist l-alprenolol (10(-5) M). NPW did not affect corticosterone production. Collectively, our findings allow us to draw the following tentative conclusions: i) ACTH-independent extra-adrenal mechanism(s) are operative in vivo, by which NPB and NPW stimulate adrenal glucocorticoid, but not mineralocorticoid secretion; ii) in vitro the interaction of NPB with adrenal medulla activates unknown mechanism(s) hampering adrenocortical steroidogenic machinery; and iii) NPW stimulates in vitro aldosterone secretion by enhancing the release of medullary catecholamines, which in turn activate beta-adrenoceptors located on zona glomerulosa cells.",M3
17161193,"Serum-free cultures of murine adrenal <e>cortical</e> cells.PURPOSE: The feasibility of culturing murine adrenal cortical cells before transplantation was investigated in this study. METHOD: Primary murine adrenal cortical cells were maintained in either fetal bovine and horse sera-containing media or serum-free media. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used to quantify the levels of adrenal cortical gene expression in the cultured cells. RESULTS: The use of sera-containing media led to the growth of many cells in the culture, but the expression of Sf-1, Dax-1, and Cyp11b1 in such cultures declined rapidly. In contrast, there was no significant cell growth in the serum-free culture medium. Culturing murine adrenal cortical cells in the serum-free medium resulted in higher levels of Sf-1, Dax-1, and Cyp11b1 gene expression. In the serum-free medium, adrenal cortical cells also responded to adrenocorticotropic hormone by increasing the expression of Cyp11b1 and suppressing the expression of Dax-1 in a dose-dependent manner. The addition of basic fibroblast growth factor to the serum-free medium maintained the expression of Sf-1, Dax-1, and Cyp11b1 for 4 weeks. CONCLUSION: Adrenal cortical cells isolated from adult mice were successfully maintained in a serum-free culture medium with basic fibroblast growth factor. This culture system may be suitable for further manipulation of adrenal cortical cells in vitro before transplantation.",M3
17095588,"Central dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in neuron-specific proopiomelanocortin-deficient mice.Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is synthesized predominantly in pituitary corticotrophs, melanotrophs, and arcuate hypothalamic neurons. Corticotroph-derived ACTH mediates basal and stress-induced glucocorticoid secretion, but it is uncertain whether POMC peptides produced in the brain also regulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. To address this question, we generated neuron-specific POMC-deficient mice by transgenic (Tg) replacement of pituitary POMC in a global Pomc(-/-) background. Selective restoration of pituitary POMC prevented the adrenal insufficiency and neonatal mortality characteristic of Pomc(-/-) mice. However, adult Pomc(-/-)Tg/+ mice expressing the pituitary-specific transgene exhibited adrenal <e>cortical</e> hypertrophy, elevated basal plasma corticosterone, elevated basal but attenuated stress-induced ACTH secretion, and inappropriately elevated CRH expression in the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus. In addition, Pomc(-/-)Tg/+, Pomc(+/-)Tg/+, and Pomc(+/-) mice, which all displayed varying degrees of elevated CRH, frequently developed melanotroph adenomas after 1 yr of age, whereas Pomc(-/-) mice, with maximal CRH expression and glucocorticoid disinhibition, developed corticotroph and melanotroph adenomas. These results indicate that neuronal POMC peptides are necessary to regulate CRH within physiological limits and that a chronic reduction or absence of hypothalamic POMC leads to trophic stimulation of pituitary cells directly or indirectly through elevated CRH levels.",M3
17004871,"Robot-assisted <e>cortical</e>-sparing adrenalectomy in a patient with Von Hippel-Lindau disease and bilateral pheochromocytomas separated by 9 years.Von Hippel-Lindau disease is a heritable syndrome that confers an increased risk of developing various benign and malignant tumors to those with a germline mutation of the tumor suppressor gene. We present a case of a male patient who initially presented at age 9 with headaches, fevers, and fatigue. He was found to have a left pheochromocytoma which was successfully managed with open total adrenalectomy. He presented again at age 18 with a second pheochromocytoma in the right adrenal gland. DNA analysis revealed a de novo Val84Leu mutation in the Von Hippel-Lindau gene, not seen in either parent. The challenge presented was that of balancing the obvious benefits of cortical- sparing adrenalectomy with the risk of tumor recurrence in spared tissue. Ultimately, management consisted of a robot-assisted laparoscopic partial right adrenalectomy with successful preservation of adrenocortical function.",M3
16971657,"Mitogen-activated protein kinases inhibit the ROMK (Kir 1.1)-like small conductance K channels in the <e>cortical</e> collecting duct.It was demonstrated previously that low dietary potassium (K) intake stimulates Src family protein tyrosine kinase (PTK) expression via a superoxide-dependent signaling. This study explored the role of mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) in mediating the effect of superoxide anions on PTK expression and ROMK (Kir 1.1) channel activity. Western blot analysis demonstrated that low K intake significantly increased the phosphorylation of P38 MAPK (P38) and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) but had no effect on phosphorylation of c-JUN N-terminus kinase in renal cortex and outer medulla. The stimulatory effect of low K intake on P38 and ERK was abolished by treatment of rats with tempol. The possibility that increases in superoxide and related products that are induced by low K intake were responsible for stimulating phosphorylation of P38 and ERK also was supported by the finding that application of H(2)O(2) increased the phosphorylation of ERK and P38 in the cultured mouse collecting duct cells. Simultaneous blocking of ERK and P38 completely abolished the effect of H(2)O(2) on c-Src expression in mouse collecting duct cells. For determination of the role of P38 and ERK in the regulation of ROMK-like small-conductance K (SK) channels, the patch-clamp technique was used to study the effect of inhibiting P38 and ERK on SK channels in the cortical collecting duct from rats that were on a control K diet (1.1%) and on a K-deficient diet for 1 d. Inhibition of ERK, c-JUN N-terminus kinase, or P38 alone had no effect on SK channels. In contrast, simultaneous inhibition of P38 and ERK significantly increased channel activity. The effect of inhibiting MAPK on SK channels was not affected in the presence of herbimycin A, a PTK inhibitor, and was larger in rats that were on a K-deficient diet than in rats that were on a normal-K diet. However, the stimulatory effect of inhibiting ERK and P38 on SK was absent in the cortical collecting duct that was treated with colchicine. It is concluded that low K intake-induced increases in superoxide levels are responsible for stimulation of P38 and ERK and that MAPK inhibit the SK channels by stimulating PTK expression and via a PTK-independent mechanism.",M3
16890544,"The circadian rhythm of glucocorticoids is regulated by a gating mechanism residing in the adrenal <e>cortical</e> clock.In mammals, the master clock of the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) and subordinate clocks found throughout the body coordinate circadian rhythms of behavior and physiology. We characterize the clock of the adrenal, an important endocrine gland that synchronizes physiological and metabolic rhythms. Clock gene expression was detected in the outer adrenal cortex prefiguring a role of the clock in regulating gluco- and mineral corticoid biogenesis. In Per2/Cry1 double mutant mice, which lack a circadian clock, hypothalamus/pituitary/adrenal axis regulation was defective. Organ culture and tissue transplantation suggest that the adrenal pacemaker gates glucocorticoid production in response to adrenocorticotropin (ACTH). In vivo the adrenal circadian clock can be entrained by light. Transcriptome profiling identified rhythmically expressed genes located at diverse nodes of steroid biogenesis that may mediate gating of the ACTH response by the adrenal clock.",M3
16880150,"Fine-needle aspiration of adrenal <e>cortical</e> carcinoma: cytologic spectrum and diagnostic challenges.We reviewed the cytologic features of 20 adrenal cortical carcinomas (ACCs; 9 primary and 11 metastatic) from 19 patients and highlighted diagnostic pitfalls. The mean size of primary ACCs was 11.9 cm, and that of metastatic ACCs was 3.0 cm. The metastatic sites were liver, lung, lymph node, soft tissue, and bone. Primary and metastatic ACCs were cytologically similar and showed a wide range of features varying from well-differentiated tumor resembling a benign cortical lesion or low-grade neuroendocrine tumor to poorly differentiated pleomorphic tumor mimicking poorly differentiated carcinoma, melanoma, or high-grade sarcoma. The common cytologic features were hypercellularity (70% of cases), necrotic debris in the background (70%), moderate to marked nuclear pleomorphism (80%), mitotic figures (90%), and prominent nucleoli (60%). Twenty percent of cases exhibited all 5 features; 40% exhibited 4 features, and 40% exhibited 3 features. Necrosis and/or mitosis were found in all cases, even in tumors with bland cytologic features. Cytologic, immunophenotypic, and ultrastructural findings should be correlated with clinical and radiologic information for achieving a proper cytologic diagnosis.",M3
16867264,"Influences of 3-methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital and dexamethasone on xenobiotic metabolizing-related cytochrome P450 enzymes and steroidogenesis in human fetal adrenal <e>cortical</e> cells.AIM: To explore the influence and possible mechanism of xenobiotics on adrenal steroidogenesis during fetal development. METHODS: Primary human fetal adrenal cortical cells were prepared, cultured and treated with 3-methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital and dexamethasone. The activities of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase, benzphetamine, aminopyrine and erythromycin N-demethylases were measured by enzyme assays. At the same time, quantitative analysis of steroid hormones cortisol, aldosterone, testosterone and progesterone were carried out in cultural medium by radioimmunoassays. RESULTS: The activities of benzphetamine and aminopyrine N-demethylase were increased in the cultural fetal adrenal cells treated with phenobarbital (0.25-1 mmol/L) for 24 h. Dexamethasone (25-100 micromol/L) also increased the activity of erythromycin N-demethylase. The activity of 7-ethoxyresorufin O-dealkylase was undetected in the cells treated without and with 3-methylcholanthrene (0.5-2 micromol/L). Meanwhile, the contents of medium cortisol, aldosterone and progesterone were decreased after treatment with 3-methylcholanthrene. Cortisol, aldosterone and progesterone concentrations were also slightly decreased with phenobarbital. Dexamethasone enhanced the productions of cortisol and progesterone remarkably. The trend of testosterone concentration was uncertain after 3-methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital or dexamethasone treatment. CONCLUSION: 3-Methylcholanthrene, phenobarbital or dexamethasone could interfere with the synthesis of cortisol, aldosterone and progesterone in primary human fetal adrenal cortical cells, which likely act through xenobiotic metabolizing-related cytochrome P450 isoform activation.",M3

16840536,"Zebrafish dax1 is required for development of the interrenal organ, the adrenal cortex equivalent.Mutations in the human nuclear receptor, DAX1, cause X-linked adrenal hypoplasia congenita (AHC). We report the isolation and characterization of a DAX1 homolog, dax1, in zebrafish. The dax1 cDNA encodes a protein of 264 amino acids, including the conserved carboxy-terminal ligand binding-like motif; but the amino-terminal region lacks the unusual repeats of the DNA binding-like domain in mammals. Genomic sequence analysis indicates that the dax1 gene structure is conserved also. Whole-mount in situ hybridization revealed the onset of dax1 expression in the developing hypothalamus at approximately 26 h post fertilization (hpf). Later, at about 28 hpf, a novel expression domain for dax1 appeared in the trunk. This bilateral dax1-expressing structure was located immediately above the yolk sac, between the otic vesicle and the pronephros. Interestingly, weak and transient expression of dax1 was observed in the interrenal glands (adrenal <e>cortical</e> equivalents) at approximately 31 hpf. This gene was also expressed in the liver after 3 dpf in the zebrafish larvae. Disruption of dax1 function by morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) down-regulated expression of steroidogenic genes, cyp11a and star, and led to severe phenotypes similar to ff1b (SF1) MO-injected embryos. Injection of dax1 MO did not affect ff1b expression, whereas ff1b MO abolished dax1 expression in the interrenal organ. Based on these results, we propose that dax1 is the mammalian DAX1 ortholog, functions downstream of ff1b in the regulatory cascades, and is required for normal development and function of the zebrafish interrenal organ.",M3
16807499,"Differentiation and regeneration of adrenal tissues: An initial step toward regeneration therapy for steroid insufficiency.In animal experiments, adrenal <e>cortical</e> tissue has been successfully regenerated through xenotransplantation of cloned adrenocortical cells, suggesting that the intraadrenal stem cells required for such tissue formation may be present in the adrenal cortex. Stable expression of Ad4BP/SF-1, a key factor for adrenal and gonadal development and steroidogenesis, has been shown to direct embryonic stem cells toward the steroidogenic lineage. However, this steroidogenic capacity was very limited since progesterone was only produced in the presence of an exogenous substrate. Bone marrow mesenchymal cells are thought to contain pluripotent progenitor cells, which differentiate into multiple lineages. We have demonstrated that adenovirus-mediated forced expression of SF-1 in long-term cultured bone marrow cells can produce steroidogenic cells with the capacity for de novo synthesis of various steroid hormones in response to ACTH. This discovery may represent the first step in autologous cell transplantation therapy for patients with steroid hormone deficiency.",M3
16759697,"T channels and steroid biosynthesis: in search of a link with mitochondria.The activity of T-type Ca2+ channels has been associated for a long time with steroid biosynthesis in adrenal <e>cortical</e> cells. Because Ca2+-dependent, rate-limiting steps of steroidogenesis have been shown to occur within the mitochondria, a functional link between these organelles and T-type channels has been thoroughly investigated. Based on several experimental data, a model has been proposed in which plasma-membrane-embedded T channels specifically bring calcium entering the cell in proximity of a pumping site of the endoplasmic reticulum. The quasi direct transfer of Ca2+ from the extracellular medium into the lumen of the e.r. would be a specific feature insured by T channels, not by other voltage-operated calcium channels. The e.r. would then act as a sort of Ca2+ pipeline, carrying the cation to the proximity of mitochondria, where it would be released, upon activation of the inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate receptor, before being immediately and avidly taken up by the organelle. A strict structural organization must be maintained at each extremity of the pipeline in order to optimize the specificity and the efficacy of this signal transduction. Both functional and structural evidences supporting this model of calcium transport within steroidogenic glomerulosa cells are reviewed in the present article.",M3
16625963,"Adrenocortical carcinomas: a 12-year clinicopathologic study of 15 cases.Adrenal <e>cortical</e> carcinomas are rare neoplasms and the definitive diagnostic criteria are distant metastasis and / or local invasion. Due to advances in imaging techniques, adrenal cortical neoplasms are discovered earlier and are smaller, increasing the need for more accurate diagnosis and pathologic indicators of prognosis. A twelve year retrospective clinicopathologic analysis of 15 histopathologically proven cases of adrenocortical carcinomas was done. Clinical details including radiologic findings, endocrine manifestations and gross finding were analysed. Hematoxylin and eosin stained slides were reviewed. Emphasis was on application of Weiss criteria. All fifteen tumors fulfilled Weiss criteria of malignancy, ie. all 15 possessed 3 or more of these criteria of malignancy. Functional tumors showed a greater representation of mixed cell type. It was concluded that Weiss criteria is easy to apply and that a combined evaluation of clinical features, size, weight and microscopic appearance seems necessary for the diagnosis of adrenocortical carcinomas.",M3
16556722,"Analysis by cDNA microarrays of gene expression patterns of human adrenocortical tumors.OBJECTIVES: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant neoplasm with extremely poor prognosis. The molecular mechanisms of adrenocortical tumorigenesis are still not well understood. The comparative analysis by cDNA microarrays of gene-expression patterns of benign and malignant adrenocortical tumors allows us to identify new tumor-suppressor genes and proto-oncogenes underlying adrenocortical tumorigenesis. DESIGN AND METHODS: Total RNA from fresh-frozen tissue of 10 ACC and 10 benign adrenocortical adenomas was isolated after histologic confirmation of neoplastic cellularity of at least 85%. The reference consisted of pooled RNA of 10 normal adrenal cortex samples. Amplified RNA of tumor and reference was used to synthesize Cy3- and Cy5-fluorescently labeled cDNA in a flip-color technique. D-chips containing 11 540 DNA spots were hybridized and scanned and the images were analyzed by ImaGene 3.0 software. RESULTS: The comparative analysis of gene expression revealed many genes with more than fourfold expression difference between ACC and normal tissue (42 genes), <e>cortical</e> adenoma and normal tissue (11 genes), and ACC and cortical adenoma (21 genes) respectively. As confirmed by real-time PCR, the IGF2 gene was significantly upregulated in ACCs versus cortical adenomas and normal cortical tissue. Genes that were downregulated in adrenocortical tumors included chromogranin B and early growth response factor 1. CONCLUSIONS: Comprehensive expression profiling of adrenocortical tumors by the cDNA microarray technique is a very powerful tool to elucidate the molecular steps associated with the tumorigenesis of these ill-defined neoplasms. To evaluate the role of identified genes, further detailed analyses, including correlation with clinical data, are required.",M3

16388123,"Neural circuitry in the regulation of adrenal corticosterone rhythmicity.Adrenal <e>cortical</e> secretion of glucocorticoids is an essential adaptive response of an organism to stress. Although the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis regulates the adrenal cortex via release of ACTH, there is strong evidence supporting a role for sympathetic innervation in modulating adrenal glucocorticoid secretion. The dissociation between changes in ACTH and glucocorticoids under non-stress and stress conditions has reinforced the concept that neural control of the adrenal cortex acts to modulate steroidogenic responses to circulating ACTH. A dual control of the adrenal cortex has been implicated in the prominent circadian rhythm in glucocorticoids. However, the central neural substrate for circadian changes in glucocorticoids that are mediated by peripheral neural innervation of the adrenal cortex has not been conclusively delineated. The hypothesis to be addressed is that neurons in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus receive input from the suprachiasmatic nucleus and project to sympathetic preganglionic neurons in the spinal cord to provide inhibitory and excitatory input to the adrenal cortex that drives the circadian rhythm. This review examines anatomical and physiological evidence that forms the basis for this putative neural circuit.",M3

When the cortical cells were incubated in vitro with chicken adrenocorticotropic hormone (cACTH) in the presence of cPTHrP, greater production of corticosterone was observed than when incubated with cACTH alone. The results suggest that PTHrP may act directly on the adrenocortical cells via its receptor binding and increase the response to ACTH for corticosterone secretion in the hen.",M3
16199893,"<e>Cortical</e>-chromaffin cell interactions in the adrenal gland.Adrenal catecholamines and steroids are important regulators of the stress response, immune function, blood pressure, and energy homeostasis. Historically, the two cell populations within the adrenal gland-the steroid-producing adrenocortical cells and the catecholamine-producing chromaffin cells-have been regarded as two independent endocrine systems. Research on adrenal physiology and pathophysiology has therefore largely focused on the individual understanding of each cell type. However, adrenal cortex and medulla appear to be interwoven and show multiple contact zones without separation by connective tissue or interstitial membranes. In vitro studies, animal models, and the analysis of human adrenal pathophysiology have demonstrated critical importance of cortical-chromaffin crosstalk for adrenal function and disease. Thus, chromaffin cells regulate steroid-hormone release by the adrenal cortex and steroids induce catecholamine production in the medulla. Consequently, disorders of the adrenal cortex have been shown to affect chromaffin cell function and vice versa. Mouse models of adrenal cortical dysfunction, such as the targeted disruption of the 21-hydroxylase- or the CRHR1 genes, show alterations in chromaffin cell function, while disruption of tyrosine hydroxylase, a key enzyme in catecholamine synthesis, impairs adrenal cortical function. Accordingly, patients with congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) and Addison's disease show reduced catecholamine biosynthesis. Immense progress in characterizing the mechanisms of chromaffin-cortical interactions has been achieved in recent years. Here, we summarize the current view on intraadrenal communication with respect to adrenal pathophysiology.",M3
16176945,"Lack of an adrenal cortex in Sf1 mutant mice is compatible with the generation and differentiation of chromaffin cells.The diversification of neural-crest-derived sympathoadrenal (SA) progenitor cells into sympathetic neurons and neuroendocrine adrenal chromaffin cells was thought to be largely understood. In-vitro studies with isolated SA progenitor cells had suggested that chromaffin cell differentiation depends crucially on glucocorticoids provided by adrenal <e>cortical</e> cells. However, analysis of mice lacking the glucocorticoid receptor gene had revealed that adrenal chromaffin cells develop mostly normally in these mice. Alternative cues from the adrenal cortex that may promote chromaffin cell determination and differentiation have not been identified. We therefore investigated whether the chromaffin cell phenotype can develop in the absence of an adrenal cortex, using mice deficient for the nuclear orphan receptor steroidogenic factor-1 (SF1), which lack adrenal cortical cells and gonads. We show that in Sf1-/- mice typical chromaffin cells assemble correctly in the suprarenal region adjacent to the suprarenal sympathetic ganglion. The cells display most features of chromaffin cells, including the typical large chromaffin granules. Sf1-/- chromaffin cells are numerically reduced by about 50% compared with the wild type at embryonic day (E) 13.5 and E17.5. This phenotype is not accounted for by reduced survival or cell proliferation beyond E12.5. However, already at E12.5 the 'adrenal' region in Sf1-/- mice is occupied by fewer PHOX2B+ and TH+ SA cells as well as SOX10+ neural crest cells. Our results suggest that cortical cues are not essential for determining chromaffin cell fate, but may be required for proper migration of SA progenitors to and/or colonization of the adrenal anlage.",M3
16175568,"Lithium-induced gene expression of inducible cyclic adenosine monophosphate early repressor in the rat adrenal gland.Lithium has acute and chronic effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis that are important for both therapeutic (e.g., treatment of mood disorders) and experimental (e.g., as the toxin in conditioned taste aversion studies) applications. We visualized lithium-induced activation of the HPA axis in rats by the adrenal expression of inducible cAMP early repressor (ICER), which is activated by elevated intracellular cAMP. We have shown that 1) intraperitoneal lithium chloride (LiCl) induces transient expression of ICER and c-fos mRNAs in the rat adrenal cortex and increases plasma level of corticosterone; 2) the <e>cortical</e> expression of ICER mRNA by LiCl occurs in a dose-dependent manner; 3) adrenal induction of ICER expression is delayed compared with c-fos expression; 4) dexamethasone pretreatment (4 mg/kg) blocks corticosterone release and adrenocortical ICER induction either by systemic LiCl (76 mg/kg) or by restraint stress; and 5) intracerebroventricular LiCl (127 microg/5 microl) is sufficient for adrenocortical, but not medullary, ICER induction. These results suggest that adrenocortical ICER expression could serve as a reliable marker for lithium-induced activation of the HPA axis. Understanding the activation of immediate-early genes such as c-fos or ICER in response to a single LiCl injection is an important first step in understanding the long-term changes in gene expression elicited by lithium that are involved in its therapeutic and toxic effect. The pattern and mechanism by which lithium stimulates ICER transcription in the adrenal gland would serve as a useful model system in future studies of lithium.",M3
16076876,"Mechanisms of histamine-induced relaxation in bovine small adrenal <e>cortical</e> arteries.Adrenal steroidogenesis is closely correlated with increases in adrenal blood flow. Many reports have studied the regulation of adrenal blood flow in vivo and in perfused glands, but until recently few studies have been conducted on isolated adrenal arteries. The present study examined vasomotor responses of isolated bovine small adrenal cortical arteries to histamine, an endogenous vasoactive compound, and its mechanism of action. In U-46619-precontracted arteries, histamine (10(-9)-5 x 10(-6) M) elicited concentration-dependent relaxations. The relaxations were blocked by the H(1) receptor antagonists diphenhydramine (10 microM) or mepyramine (1 microM) (maximal relaxations of 18 +/- 6 and 22 +/- 6%, respectively, vs. 55 +/- 5% of control) but only partially inhibited by the H(2) receptor antagonist cimetidine (10 microM) and the H(3) receptor antagonist thioperamide (1 microM). Histamine-induced relaxations were also blocked by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 30 microM; maximal relaxation of 13 +/- 7%) and eliminated by endothelial removal or L-NA combined with the cyclooxgenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 microM). In the presence of adrenal zona glomerulosa (ZG) cells, histamine did not induce further relaxations compared with histamine alone. Histamine (10(-7)-10(-5) M) concentration-dependently increased aldosterone production by adrenal ZG cells. Compound 48/80 (10 microg/ml), a mast cell degranulator, induced significant relaxations (93 +/- 0.6%), which were blocked by L-NA plus indomethacin or endothelium removal, partially inhibited by the combination of the H(1), H(2), and H(3) receptor antagonists, but not affected by the mast cell stabilizer sodium cromoglycate (1 mM). These results demonstrate that histamine causes direct relaxation of small adrenal cortical arteries, which is largely mediated by endothelial NO and prostaglandins via H(1) receptors. The potential role of histamine in linking adrenal vascular events and steroid secretion requires further investigation.",M3
16006438,"Hyperemesis gravidarum, a literature review.Hyperemesis gravidarum (HG) is a condition causing severe nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy often resulting in hospital admission. The incidence of HG is approximately 0.5% of live births, said to be higher in multiple pregnancies, hydatidiform mole and other conditions associated with increased pregnancy hormone levels. Both the aetiology and pathogenesis of HG remain unknown. We conducted a literature review (1966-now) to summarize the current evidence on the aetiology and pathogenesis of HG. The potential role of pregnancy-related hormones such as progesterone, estrogen and HCG has been widely studied; however, various other hormones such as leptin, placental growth hormone, prolactin, thyroid and adrenal <e>cortical</e> hormones have been implicated in the aetiology of HG. In addition to endocrinological hypotheses, the rationale and evidence considering infectious, immunological, psychological, metabolic and anatomical causes for HG have been analysed here.

This review highlights the need for more extensive studies addressing the pathogenesis and aetiology of HG.",M3
15972274,"Zone-specific cell proliferation during adrenocortical regeneration after enucleation in rats.A quantitative analysis of zone-specific proliferation was done to determine the recovery of adrenal <e>cortical</e> zonation during regeneration after enucleation. Adult male rats underwent adrenal enucleation [unilateral enucleation (ULE)] or sham surgery, both accompanied by contralateral adrenalectomy. At 2, 5, 10, and 28 days, blood and adrenals were collected to assess functional recovery. Adrenal sections were immunostained for Ki67 (proliferation), cytochrome P-450 aldosterone synthase (P-450aldo, glomerulosa), and cytochrome P-450 11beta-hydroxylase (P-45011beta, fasciculata). Unbiased stereology was used to count proliferating glomerulosa and fasciculata cells. Recovery of fasciculata secretory function occurred by 28 days as reflected by plasma ACTH and corticosterone, whereas glomerulosa function reflected by plasma aldosterone remained low at 28 days. At 5 days, ULE adrenals showed increased Ki67+ cells in the glomerulosa and inner fasciculata, whereas at 10 and 28 days increased proliferation was restricted to the outer fasciculata. These data show that enucleation results in transient elevations in glomerulosa and inner fasciculata cell proliferation followed by a delayed increase in the outer fasciculata. To assess adrenal growth in enucleated adrenals previously suppressed by the presence of an intact adrenal, rats underwent ULE and sham surgery; after 4 wk, the intact adrenal was removed and enucleated adrenals were collected at 2, 5, and 10 days. Overall, proliferation was delayed in this model, but at 5 days, Ki67+ cells increased in the outer fasciculata, whereas by 10 days, increased proliferation occurred in the outer and inner fasciculata. The key novel finding of increased proliferation in the inner fasciculata suggests that the delayed growth of the enucleated adrenal results in part from a regenerative response.",M3
15890772,"Angiotensin II dilates bovine adrenal <e>cortical</e> arterioles: role of endothelial nitric oxide.Adrenal steroidogenesis is modulated by humoral and neuronal factors and blood flow. Angiotensin II (AII) stimulates adrenal cortical aldosterone and cortisol production and medullary catecholamine release. However, AII regulation of adrenal vascular tone has not been characterized. We examined the effect of AII on diameters of cannulated bovine adrenal cortical arteries. Cortical arteries (average internal diameter = 230 microm) were constricted with U46619 and concentration-diameter responses to AII (10(-13) to 10(-8) mol/liter) were measured. In endothelium-intact arteries, AII induced dilations at low concentrations (maximum dilation = 25 +/- 6% at 10(-10) mol/liter) and constrictions at high concentrations (maximum constriction = 25 +/- 18% at 10(-8) mol/liter). AII constrictions were blocked by the angiotensin type 1 (AT1) receptor antagonist, losartan (10(-6) mol/liter). AII dilations were enhanced by losartan (maximal dilation = 48 +/- 8%), abolished by endothelial cell removal or N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 3 x 10(-5) mol/liter) and inhibited by the angiotensin type 2 (AT2) receptor antagonist, PD123319 (10(-6) mol/liter, maximal dilation = 18 +/- 4%). In a 4,5-diaminofluorescein diacetate nitric oxide (NO) assay of isolated cortical arteries, AII stimulated NO production, which was abolished by PD123319, L-NA, or endothelial cell removal. Western immunoblot of arterial homogenates and endothelial and zona glomerulosa cell lysates revealed 48-kD and 50-kD bands corresponding to AT1 and AT2 receptors, respectively, in all three and a 140-kD band corresponding to endothelial NO synthase in endothelial cells and arteries. Our results demonstrate that AII stimulates adrenal cortical arterial dilation through endothelial cell AT2 receptor activation and NO release and AT1 receptor-dependent constriction.",M3
15867178,"Elevated blood pressure linked to primary hyperaldosteronism and impaired vasodilation in BK channel-deficient mice.BACKGROUND: Abnormally elevated blood pressure is the most prevalent risk factor for cardiovascular disease. The large-conductance, voltage- and Ca2+-dependent K+ (BK) channel has been proposed as an important effector in the control of vascular tone by linking membrane depolarization and local increases in cytosolic Ca2+ to hyperpolarizing K+ outward currents. However, the BK channel may also affect blood pressure by regulating salt and fluid homeostasis, particularly by adjusting the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here we report that deletion of the pore-forming BK channel alpha subunit leads to a significant blood pressure elevation resulting from hyperaldosteronism accompanied by decreased serum K+ levels as well as increased vascular tone in small arteries. In smooth muscle from small arteries, deletion of the BK channel leads to a depolarized membrane potential, a complete lack of membrane hyperpolarizing spontaneous K+ outward currents, and an attenuated cGMP vasorelaxation associated with a reduced suppression of Ca2+ transients by cGMP. The high level of BK channel expression observed in wild-type adrenal glomerulosa cells, together with unaltered serum renin activities and corticotropin levels in mutant mice, suggests that the hyperaldosteronism results from abnormal adrenal <e>cortical</e> function in BK(-/-) mice. CONCLUSIONS: These results identify previously unknown roles of BK channels in blood pressure regulation and raise the possibility that BK channel dysfunction may underlie specific forms of hyperaldosteronism.",M3
15864504,"Presence of organic anion transporters 3 (OAT3) and 4 (OAT4) in human adrenocortical cells.Since the organic anion transporter-1 (OAT1) has been implicated in cortisol release from bovine and rat adrenal zona fasciculata cells, we addressed the question of whether OATs are present in human adrenal <e>cortical</e> cells. In the human adrenal cell line NCI-H295R, 24-h cortisol secretion increased up to 30-fold on exposure to forskolin. Incubation of forskolin-treated cells for 24 h with the OAT substrates probenecid, p-aminohippurate (PAH), glutarate or cimetidine inhibited cortisol release partly. RT-PCR did not reveal expression of human OAT1 and OAT2, but OAT3 and OAT4 mRNAs were detected in both NCI-H295R cells and human adrenal tissue. When human OAT3 (hOAT3) and hOAT4 were expressed in Xenopus laevis oocytes, only hOAT3 showed [3H]cortisol uptake in excess of that of water-injected control oocytes. Cortisol uptake via OAT3 was saturable with an apparent Kt of 2.4 microM. In NCI-H295R cells, [3H]estrone sulphate uptake was saturable, cis-inhibited by OAT substrates and trans-stimulated by preloading with glutarate or cortisol. Likewise, [3H]PAH uptake was cis-inhibited by estrone sulphate and trans-stimulated by preloading the cells with PAH, glutarate or cortisol, indicating functional expression of OATs in the plasma membrane of NCI-H295R cells.",M3
15805423,"Altered expression patterns of heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2 and B1 in the adrenal cortex.Several proteins implicated in hormonogenesis of the adrenal cortex have alternatively spliced isoforms, which respond differently to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoproteins A2 and B1 are among the abundant pre-mRNA-binding proteins involved in alternative splicing. We examined the expression of A2 and B1 in normal adrenal cortex and tumors. B1 was variably expressed in the zona fasciculata-reticularis, although A2 was diffusely expressed in the three zones. B1 was more abundant in compact cells than clear cells, and B1 expression was frequent in the zona reticularis, which consists mainly of compact cells. In three kinds of <e>cortical</e> adenomas autonomously producing hormones, B1 was generally overexpressed and there were no significant differences among them. In cortisol-producing tumors, non-tumor parts of the cortex, which were generally atrophic due to low ACTH, had less B1 protein than normal adrenals. These results suggested a correlation between B1 expression and the hormonal activity responding to ACTH. In vitro ACTH stimulation induced a biphasic expression of B1 in an H295R cortical carcinoma cell line, and it paralleled hormonogenesis. Conclusively, B1 expression varied in relation to the hormonal activity responding to the ACTH, and it may provide a key to elucidating the splicing mechanisms involved in hormonogenesis.",M3
15707876,"Toluene inhalation-induced adrenocortical hypertrophy and endocrinological changes in rat.Rats were exposed to toluene (1,500 ppm for 4 hr per day) for 7 days. The body weight of the rats was significantly lower and the weight of the adrenal gland was significantly higher in the toluene inhalation group compared to the controls. Microscopically, there was no obvious change in the medulla, but hypertrophy of the cortex was observed in the toluene inhalation group. And, the size of adrenocortical cells in treated-rats was also significantly enlarged than the control. Immunohistochemical staining did not show a clear difference in localization of aldosterone-positive cells between the control and inhalation groups. Expansion of the corticosterone-positive area consistent with the <e>cortical</e> hypertrophy was recognized in the inhalation group. Enhancement of 72 kD-heat-shock protein (HSP70)-expression in the toluene inhalation group was not observed. Neither stress nor damage to cortical cells due directly to toluene exposure was observed in the cortex. Also, there was no obvious difference in the anti-proliferating cell nucleus antigen (PCNA)-immunostaining between control and inhalation groups. Thus, it is suspected that cortical hypertrophy was the result of cell enlargement due to the stimulation of the cortical cells. Corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF) immunoreactivity in the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) was increased in the inhalation group. Concentration of plasma ACTH was elevated significantly by toluene exposure. The amounts of mRNA of adrenocortical steroid metabolism gene, cytochrome side-chain cleavage (P450scc), was also increased by toluene inhalation. Toluene exposure might induce adrenocortical hypertrophy via the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal gland (HPA) axis.",M3
15741242,"Characterization of big stanniocalcin variants in mammalian adipocytes and adrenocortical cells.The hormone stanniocalcin (STC) is widely distributed, and in rodents the highest levels of expression are in the ovaries. In both cows and rodents, ovarian STC consists of three high-molecular-weight variants collectively known as big STC. In the ovary, big STC is made by theca cells and interstitial cells and is targeted to lipid storage droplets of nearby luteal cells to inhibit progesterone release. An endocrine pathway is operative during pregnancy and lactation. Whether or not big STC is made by tissues other than ovary has never been addressed. Therefore, the purpose of this study was to determine via a detailed characterization of adrenal glands and adipocytes whether big STC is present in other cells that store and release lipids. The results showed that STC was made in bovine and mouse adrenals, mainly in steroidogenic, adrenocortical cells. The majority of ligand and receptor were likewise confined to <e>cortical</e> zone cells. As in luteal cells, high levels of ligand and receptor were found in the adrenocortical cell lipid droplet fraction. However, adrenals made only the largest (135 kDa) of the three big STC variants. Nonetheless, adrenal STC had much greater receptor affinity than a mixture of the three big STC variants. Adipocytes contained all three big STC variants, and both ligand and receptor were heavily concentrated on the lipid droplets. Moreover, adipocyte lipid storage droplets had 50-fold more receptors than those in steroidogenic cells, indicating that big STC is heavily targeted to adipose cells. The findings collectively support the hypothesis that big STC is not unique to ovarian steroidogenic cells but is in fact common to cells with a role in lipid storage and release.",M3
15666827,"COUP-TF and transcriptional co-regulators in adrenal steroidogenesis.Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) play key roles in the transcriptional regulation of steroidogenic P450 genes. Transfection studies showed that SF-1 activated bovine CYP17 promoter activity, whereas COUP-TFs repressed it from the CRS2 element in a mutually exclusive manner in mouse adrenocortical Y-1 cells. COUP-TFI and SF-1 competitively bind to the Ad5 element of the human CYP11B2 gene promoter. Unexpectedly, overexpression of COUP-TFI increased the CYP11B2 promoter activity, whereas overexpression of SF-1 repressed it in human adrenocortical H295R cells. In cortisol-producing adrenal <e>cortical</e> adenomas, down-regulation of nuclear receptors, including COUP-TFs was found. We therefore screened for COUP-TFI-interacting proteins using a yeast two-hybrid system and have identified Ubc9 and PIAS1, SUMO-1 conjugating enzyme and ligase, respectively. Coexpression of Ubc9 and PIAS1 synergistically enhanced COUP-TFI-mediated trans-repression of CYP17 gene as well as transactivation of CYP11B2 gene. The SUMOylation-defective mutants of these proteins continued to function as co-regulators of COUP-TFI. These findings indicate that Ubc9 and PIAS1 can function as transcriptional co-regulators of COUP-TFI to modulate adrenal cortical steroidogenesis in a SUMOylation-independent manner.",M3
15666839,"Vitamin C is an important cofactor for both adrenal cortex and adrenal medulla.The adrenal gland is among the organs with the highest concentration of vitamin C in the body. Interestingly, both the adrenal cortex and the medulla accumulate such high levels of ascorbate. Ascorbic acid is a cofactor required both in catecholamine biosynthesis and in adrenal steroidogenesis. Here we provide an overview on the role of vitamin C in the adrenal cortex and medulla derived from in vitro and in vivo studies. In addition, recent insights gained from an animal model with a deletion in the gene for the ascorbic acid transporter will be summarized. Mutant mice lacking the plasma membrane ascorbic acid transporter (SVCT2) have severely reduced tissue levels of ascorbic acid and die soon after birth. There is a significant decrease of tissue catecholamine levels in the adrenals. On the ultrastructural level, adrenal chromaffin cells in SVCT2 null mice show depletion of catecholamine storage vesicles, signs of apoptosis, and increased glycogen storage. Decreased plasma levels of corticosterone and altered morphology of mitochondrial membranes indicate additional effects of the deficiency on adrenal <e>cortical</e> function. The data derived from these animal models and various cell culture studies confirm a crucial role for vitamin C for both the adrenal cortex as well as the adrenal medulla further underlining the interdependence of the two endocrine systems united in one gland.",M3
15618362,"Estrogen elicits <e>cortical</e> zone-specific effects on development of the primate fetal adrenal gland.In the present study, we determined whether endogenous estrogen, the levels of which increase with advancing pregnancy, regulates growth and development of the baboon fetal adrenal cortex. Fetal adrenal glands were obtained at mid- (d 100) and late (d 165, term is 184 d) gestation from untreated baboons and on d 165 from animals in which endogenous estrogen production was suppressed by administration of aromatase inhibitor CGS 20267 between d 100 and 165. Volumes of the respective cortical zones were determined by zone-specific immunocytochemical staining of steroidogenic enzymes and image analysis. Fetal adrenal weight and volume increased (P &lt; 0.01) 3-fold between mid- and late gestation and an additional 70% (P &lt; 0.01) by administration of CGS 20267, which decreased (P &lt; 0.001) fetal serum estradiol levels by more than 95%. Mean +/- se volume (x10(-10) mum(3)) of the fetal cortical zone increased from 3.45 +/- 0.28 at midgestation to 6.64 +/- 0.69 at late gestation in untreated baboons and to 12.55 +/- 0.99 (P &lt; 0.01) in baboons in which estrogen production was suppressed by CGS 20267 administration. The levels of umbilical artery serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, which is secreted primarily by the fetal zone, were increased almost 3-fold (P &lt; 0.01) by administration of CGS 20267. Concomitant administration of CGS 20267 and estradiol returned fetal cortical zone volume and serum dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels to normal. In contrast to the effect of estrogen deprivation on the fetal zone, the volumes of the definitive and transitional zones in untreated baboons late in gestation (3.18 +/- 0.63 and 2.62 +/- 0.43, respectively) and levels of fetal serum cortisol, a steroid secreted from the transitional zone, were not altered by estrogen suppression. The changes in fetal zone growth were not associated with alterations in fetal pituitary proopiomelanocortin mRNA levels. We propose that estrogen acts directly on the fetal adrenal cortex to selectively repress the morphological and functional development of the fetal zone, potentially as a feedback system to maintain physiological secretion of estrogen precursors and thus placental estrogen production to promote normal primate fetal and placental development.",M3
15666805,"Possible participation of outer mitochondrial membrane cytonchrome B5 in steroidogenesis in zona glomerulosa of rat adrenal cortex.Outer mitochondrial membrane cytochrome b5 (OMb) originally found in rat liver is an isoform of cytochrome b5 (b5) of the endoplasmic reticulum. In contrast to accumulated data on the physiological roles of b5, functions of OMb have not been well characterized except for its involvement in regeneration of ascorbic acid [i.e., in a semidehydroascorbate reductase (SDAR) system]. By using highly specific antibodies against rat OMb, we found immunohistochemically that OMb in the rat adrenal gland was most abundant in the zona glomerulosa (zG) among the three <e>cortical</e> zones, and the expression level was enhanced on angiotensin II-stimulation. SDAR activity was found in zG and inhibited by anti-OMb antibody. Moreover, the increase in plasma aldosterone concentration under Na+ -deficiency was suppressed by limited ascorbic acid (Asc) availability in rat mutants unable to synthesize Asc, while plasma corticosterone concentration was not affected. These data suggest that OMb, present abundantly in zG, participates in aldosterone formation in zG of rat under angiotensin II-stimulation through regeneration of Asc.",M3
15591023,"c-Myc protein is stabilized by fibroblast growth factor 2 and destabilized by ACTH to control cell cycle in mouse Y1 adrenocortical cells.ACTH is the hormone known to control adrenal cortex function and maintenance in the intact animal but, in culture, it inhibits proliferation of adrenocortical cells from different mammalian species, a puzzle that has remained unsolved for nearly 30 years. In this paper we compare ACTH and fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) antagonistic effects on the cell cycle in the Y1 cell line, a functional lineage of mouse adreno-<e>cortical</e> tumor cells. This cell line displays chronic high levels of c-Ki-Ras-GTP, high active constitutive levels of phosphatidylinositol 3-OH kinase/Protein Kinase B (PI3K/AKT) and low constitutive basal expression of c-Myc, which accounts for a minor deregulation of the cell cycle. In G0/G1-arrested Y1 cells, over-expression of the dominant negative mutant HaRasN17 drastically reduces c-Ki-Ras-GTP levels, eliminating basal c-Myc expression and basal S phase entry. PI3K/Akt seems to be the downstream pathway from c-Ki-ras for deregulation of c-Myc basal expression, since wortmannin abolishes c-Myc expression in serum-starved, G0/G1-arrested Y1 cells. FGF2 is a strong mitogen for Y1 cells, promoting -- in a manner dependent on the MEK/ERK pathway -- c-myc transcription induction, c-Myc protein stabilization and S phase entry in G0/G1-arrested Y1 cells. On the other hand, ACTH causes c-Myc protein destabilization, partially blocking S phase entry induced by FGF2, by a process dependent on the cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) pathway. The whole pathway activated by ACTH to destabilize c-Myc protein in Y1 cells might comprise the following steps: ACTH receptor --&gt;cAMP/PKA --&gt; Akt deactivation --&gt;GSK3 activity liberation --&gt; c-Myc Thr58 phosphorylation. We demonstrate that c-Myc regulation is a central key in the cell cycle control by these factors, since enforced expression of c-Myc through the MycER chimera abrogates the ACTH inhibitory effect over FGF2-induced S phase entry.",M3
15616950,"Adrenal <e>cortical</e> cell transplantation.PURPOSE: The adrenal cortex is a critical component of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal/gonadal axis that coordinates the stress response and maintains homeostasis. The authors hypothesize that adrenal cortical cells can be transplanted in adrenal insufficiency states to regenerate the adrenal cortex. METHODS: Murine adrenal glands were dissociated into adrenal cortical cells. Cells cultured in a collagen matrix were transplanted under the renal capsule. The implants were retrieved 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks later. Total RNA was extracted from the retrieved specimens and was analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: All animals survived the surgical procedure. At implant retrieval, a distinct organoid could be visualized under the renal capsule. The expressions of adrenal-specific markers including Sf1, Dax1, Star, Cyp11a, Cyp11b1, and Cyp21 were detectable in the retrieved specimens up to 8 weeks posttransplantation. CONCLUSION: Primary adrenal cortical cells retained their gene expressions after heterotopic transplantation. Ex vivo gene transfer followed by adrenal cortical cell transplantation may lead to curative therapy for patients with adrenal insufficiency.",M3
15358701,"Side-effects of fluticasone in asthmatic children: no effects after dose reduction.To assess long-term effects and side-effects of fluticasone propionate (FP), a 2-yr study was performed, comparing a step-down dose approach (1,000 microg.day(-1), with reductions every 2 months to 500, 200 and 100 microg.day(-1) for the remainder of the study) versus a constant dose (200 microg.day(-1)). In 55 children with chronic persistent asthma, aged 6-10 yrs, airways hyperresponsiveness (AHR) and systemic side-effects (height, bone parameters and adrenal <e>cortical</e> function) were assessed at predetermined intervals in a double-blind prospective 2-yr study. AHR improved after 4 months treatment with 1,000 microg.day(-1) FP followed by 500 microg.day(-1), without significant differences during long-term treatment between the two approaches. Dose-dependent reduction of growth velocity, adrenal cortical function and biochemical bone turnover was found during therapy with 1,000 and 500 microg.day(-1) FP when compared with 200 microg.day(-1). In conclusion, doses of 1,000 and 500 microg.day(-1) fluticasone propionate are associated with marked reductions of growth velocity, bone turnover and adrenal cortical function. However, conventional doses (&lt; or =200 microg.day(-1) fluticasone propionate) appear to be safe in the long-term management of childhood asthma. From a safety point of view, high doses of fluticasone propionate should only be prescribed in exceptions, e.g. in persistent severe asthma.",M3
15558987,"[Laparoscopic adrenalectomy: our preliminary experience]INTRODUCTION: In 1992, Gagner described the first laparoscopic adrenalectomy. Since then this technique has been more and more widely employed and several studies confirmed its advantages, comparing to the traditional approach, in terms of reduction of mean hospital stay and therefore of the health expense. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The Authors' preliminary experience spreads from March to November 2003 when 4 patients were studied and thus underwent a transperitoneal laparoscopic adrenalectomy: 2 of them were affected by Cushing syndrome, 1 by pheochromocytoma in MEN and 1 by an incidentaloma. The transabdominal access in lateral decubitus with 4 trocars was performed. RESULTS: No complication was reported with a minimal need of analgesic drugs. The mean hospital stay was 4 days and all patients were discharged 48 hours after surgery. The mean diameter of nodules was 40 +/- 30 mm. The definitive histological examination showed 2 <e>cortical</e> adenomas, 1 diffuse cortical hyperplasia and 1 pheochromocytoma. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary report confirms the optimal results of other experienced authors. Further interventions will be necessary for improvements and technical requirements.",M3
15233560,"Bilateral adrenocortical adenomas causing ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome at different periods: a case report and discussion of corticosteroid replacement therapy following bilateral adrenalectomy.We report a rare case of bilateral adrenocortical adenomas causing ACTH-independent Cushing's syndrome at different periods 9 yr apart. The subject, a 24-yr-old woman, in June 1989 had a typical Cushingoid appearance. Her baseline plasma cortisol levels did not show a diurnal rhythm and she had a very low baseline plasma ACTH level. Plasma cortisol levels could not be suppressed by overnight low-dose or two-day high-dose dexamethasone suppression test. Marked uptake of 131I-6beta-iodomethyl-19-norcholesterol (NP-59) was observed in the right adrenal gland. Abdominal computed tomography (CT) showed a right adrenal tumor. The right adrenal gland with adenoma was removed. The non-tumorous part of the adrenal cortex was atrophic. By April 1998, she had experienced a weight gain of more than 20 kg over a two-yr period. The baseline plasma cortisol levels were at the lower limit of the normal range with loss of diurnal rhythmicity. The baseline plasma ACTH levels were very low. Neither a two-day low-dose nor a two-day high-dose dexamethasone suppression test could suppress serum cortisol or urinary free cortisol levels. NP-59 adrenal scan revealed increased uptake of the left adrenal gland at 72 h after intravenous injection of the tracer. Abdominal CT and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) all demonstrated a left adrenal mass. Left adrenalectomy was performed in June 1998; histological features showed a <e>cortical</e> adenoma and atrophic change in the non-tumorous part of the adrenal cortex. Elevated plasma ACTH levels after bilateral adrenalectomy could be suppressed with conventional corticosteroid replacement therapy and overnight low-dose dexamethasone suppression test.",M3
15256778,"The role of corticosterone in the metabolic recovery after intrasplenic adrenal autotransplantation in rats.Transplantation of adrenal <e>cortical</e> tissue may represent an alternative treatment to reestablish glucocorticoid secretion in adrenal insufficiency. In the present work, performed in adrenalectomized rats and adrenalectomized rats with a complete autotransplanted adrenal into the spleen, several hormones and biochemical parameters were measured and compared to control animals, in order to examine hormone interactions. Rats were sacrificed three weeks after surgery, and plasma and tissue samples were obtained for hormone and biochemical measurements. In adrenalectomized animals, plasma corticosterone, aldosterone and insulin levels were profoundly decreased, whereas in autotransplanted rats plasma corticosterone levels showed a partial recovery, aldosterone plasma concentrations remained low, and plasma insulin levels increased to values close to those of the controls. Both groups showed a marked elevation of plasma ACTH levels, as well as significantly increased plasma glucagon concentrations. In autotransplanted animals, most of the biochemical parameters, which were altered in adrenalectomized rats, returned to normal levels. These results suggest that increased glucagon levels in adrenalectomized and autotransplanted animals, may contribute to the marked increase of plasma ACTH, and could also be important in the recovery of plasma glucose and hepatic glycogen observed in autografted rats. Since high glucagon concentrations alone were unable to normalize carbohydrate levels in adrenalectomized animals, it appears that glucagon can act only in the presence of corticosterone.",M3
15231703,"The effects of proopiomelanocortin deficiency on murine adrenal development and responsiveness to adrenocorticotropin.The mature adrenal cortex is dependent upon proopiomelanocortin (POMC)-derived peptides for the maintenance of its size, structure, and endocrine function. Recent studies in mice genetically deficient in POMC have suggested that early exposure to POMC-derived peptides might also be necessary for the development of a functionally competent adrenal. We examined adrenal morphology and function in an independent line of mice lacking all POMC-derived peptides (Pomc-/-). Adrenal glands were found in all mice, although the glands of Pomc-/- mice had markedly reduced weight compared with control animals (0.5 +/- 0.1 vs. 2.1 +/- 0.1 mg, respectively; P &lt; 0.05) and had disrupted <e>cortical</e> architecture. In Pomc-/- mice, plasma corticosterone was undetectable, and plasma aldosterone was significantly reduced compared with wild-type mice (498 +/- 88 vs. 1845 +/- 168 nmol/liter, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). Heterozygous mice (Pomc+/-) had smaller adrenal glands with significantly lower levels of corticosterone both basally and in response to CRH and ACTH than wild-type mice, indicating that two functional copies of the Pomc gene are necessary to support the fully normal function of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis. Three-month-old Pomc-/- mice were treated for 10 d with a highly specific ACTH analog. This treatment restored adrenal weight, cortical morphology, and plasma corticosterone to the levels seen in wild-type littermates. In conclusion, murine adrenal glands can develop without exposure to endogenous POMC-derived peptides during fetal and neonatal life. Although such glands are atrophic and hypofunctional, exposure to ACTH alone can restore their size, morphology, and corticosterone secretion.",M3
15231705,"Acetylcholine-induced relaxation and hyperpolarization in small bovine adrenal <e>cortical</e> arteries: role of cytochrome P450 metabolites.The present study characterizes the vascular responses of isolated small bovine adrenal cortical arteries to acetylcholine, an endogenous neurotransmitter in the adrenal gland. Acetylcholine (10(-10) to 10(-6) m) elicited a concentration-dependent relaxation, with a maximal relaxation of 96 +/- 1% and EC50 of 4.2 nm. The relaxation was abolished by endothelial removal and attenuated by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-nitro-L-arginine (L-NA, 30 microm) but not by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin (10 microm). The maximal relaxation and EC50 of acetylcholine in the presence of L-NA were 87 +/- 4% and 22 nm, respectively. The acetylcholine-induced, indomethacin- and L-NA-resistant relaxation was eliminated by high K+ and markedly inhibited by the cytochrome P450 inhibitors SKF 525A (10 microm) and miconazole (10 microm). The maximal relaxations and EC50s with SKF 525A and miconazole were 56 +/- 8 and 72 +/- 2% and 0.8 and 0.5 microm, respectively. In indomethacin- and L-NA-treated arteries, acetylcholine induced a smooth muscle hyperpolarization, which was blocked by SKF 525A (3 +/- 1 mV vs. 15 +/- 2 mV of control). Arachidonic acid (10(-9) to 10(-5) m) and 14,15-epoxyeicosatrienoic acid (14,15-EET, 10(-9) to 10(-5) m), a cytochrome P450 metabolite of arachidonic acid, also evoked relaxations in small adrenal arteries, with maximal relaxations of 56 +/- 4 and 90 +/- 5%, respectively. The arachidonic acid-induced relaxation was blocked by SKF 525A. Using high-pressure liquid chromatography and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry analysis, EETs were identified in small adrenal arteries. These results demonstrate that acetylcholine is a potent vasodilator of small adrenal cortical arteries. The acetylcholine-induced relaxation is largely mediated by an endothelium-dependent hyperpolarization mechanism, presumably through cytochrome P450 metabolites of arachidonic acid.",M3

15212142,"Differential localization of brain-type and epidermal-type fatty acid binding proteins in the adrenal gland of mice.In immuno-light and -electron microscopy, brain-type fatty acid binding protein (B-FABP) is localized in the sustentacular cells enclosing the chromaffin cells in the adrenal medulla. This represents another new feature commonly shared by the sustentacular cells and ganglionic satellite cells, the latter of which has already been reported to localize this molecule, and suggests a common feature in lipid metabolism shared by the two cells enclosing peripheral neurons and paraneurons. On the other hand, epidermal-type fatty acid binding protein (E-FABP) is localized in two discrete cells in the adrenal gland: the one is a subpopulation of intra-adrenal macrophages which are intensely immunoreactive for F4/80, a marker of macrophages, and are rich in pleomorphic lysosomes. Because of their direct apposition to adjacent <e>cortical</e> endocrine cells and medullary chromaffin cells, the macrophages may be involved not only in phagocytosis of degenerating adrenal cells but also in exertion of some yet unknown effects on the endocrine function of the cortical and medullary cells via humoral factors such as cytokines which have recently been known to be secreted by macrophages. The other is a population of cells having scanty perikaryal cytoplasm poor in organneles and several thinny extended processes in the cortex and exhibiting weak immunoreactivity for E-FABP. The possible natures of these cells immunoreactive for E-FABP are discussed in view of a subpopulation of endothelial cells or the dendritic cells of antigen-presenting property.",M3
15069328,"F-18 fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography-positive benign adrenal <e>cortical</e> adenoma: imaging features and pathologic correlation.Accurate characterization of adrenal lesions in lung cancer is essential in the staging of the disease. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging as well as fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) imaging are used to differentiate adrenal metastases from benign adenomas. Although FDG-PET is highly accurate in this regard, benign adrenal cortical adenomas have been shown to accumulate FDG, although to a lesser degree. We present a patient with a history of lung cancer and FDG accumulation in a benign adenoma, probably reflecting areas of chronic inflammation also seen within the gland at pathology.",M3
15084485,"Functional luteinizing hormone/chorionic gonadotropin receptors in human adrenal <e>cortical</e> H295R cells.Previous studies have suggested that activation of normal human adrenal and adrenal tumor luteinizing hormone (LH)/chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) receptors results in an increased secretion of steroid hormones. Since it is not feasible to test this suggestion on normal human adrenal cells, we used human adrenal cortical carcinoma H295R cells, which are similar in some respects to normal adrenal cortical cells. These cells contained LH/hCG receptor transcripts and receptor protein that can bind (125)I-hCG in a hormone-specific manner. Culturing the cells with highly purified hCG resulted in a time- and dose-dependent significant increase in dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS) secretion as compared with the controls. The DHEAS response was hormone as well as steroid specific. Since hCG treatment did not increase DHEA secretion, we suspected that the hCG might increase DHEA sulfotransferase (ST). Consistent with this possibility, hCG treatment increased steady-state DHEA-ST mRNA levels. The hCG effects require its receptors, as inhibition of their synthesis by treatment with antisense phosphorothioate oligodeoxynucleotides (ODN) made from the LH/hCG receptor sequence resulted in loss of DHEA-ST and DHEAS responses. The findings that 1) hCG treatment increased cAMP levels and activated protein kinase A (PKA), 2) 8-bromo cAMP mimicked hCG, and 3) blocking PKA activation prevented hCG as well as 8-bromo cAMP from increasing both DHEA-ST mRNA and DHEAS levels suggested that cAMP/PKA signaling was involved in the hCG actions. In conclusion, H295R cells contain LH/hCG receptors, which are coupled to increasing DHEAS secretion through upregulating the ST enzyme mRNA level. This action is mediated by the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway. These findings support the concept that adrenal function in normal and pathological conditions could be influenced by LH and hCG.",M3
14726440,"Characterization of vasoconstrictor responses in small bovine adrenal <e>cortical</e> arteries in vitro.The adrenal gland is highly vascularized with tightly regulated blood flow that is closely correlated with steroidogenesis. Mechanisms involved in the regulation of adrenal blood flow and vascular tone are largely unknown. The present study characterizes the contractile responses of isolated small cortical arteries from bovine adrenal glands. In endothelium-intact arteries, K(+), the thromboxane mimetic U46619, 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT), and endothelin-1 (ET-1) induced concentration-dependent contractions, whereas phenylephrine, norepinephrine, and ACTH were without effect. The EC(50)s for K(+), U46619, 5-HT, and ET-1 were 45 +/- 3 mm, 150 +/- 24 nm, 370 +/- 38 nm, and 2.8 +/- 0.8 nm, respectively. Contractions induced by U46619, 5-HT, and ET-1 were blocked by the thromboxane receptor antagonist SQ 29,548, the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist ketanserin, and the ET(A) receptor antagonist BQ 123, respectively. Removal of the endothelium caused a marked leftward shift of concentration responses to high K(+), U46619, 5-HT, and ET-1, and revealed contractile responses to phenylephrine and norepinephrine. In U46619-preconstricted arteries, BQ 123 converted ET-1-induced contractions to relaxations (maximal relaxation of 57 +/- 8%), which were subsequently blocked by the ET(B) receptor antagonist BQ 788. The ET(B)-mediated relaxations were endothelium dependent and inhibited by the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor N-nitro-l-arginine, the cytochrome P450 inhibitor SKF 525A, and high extracellular K(+), but not by the cyclooxygenase inhibitor indomethacin. These results demonstrate that small adrenal cortical arteries are highly responsive to various vasoconstrictor agents. The forceful contractile responses of these arterioles are consistent with their potential role in the regulation of adrenal blood flow.",M3
15050094,"Dependence of fetal hairs and sebaceous glands on fetal adrenal cortex and possible control from adrenal medulla.Human fetal adrenal development is characterized by rapid growth, high steroidogenic activity, and a distinct morphology, including a unique <e>cortical</e> compartment known as the fetal zone. For most of gestation, the predominant fetal zone accounts for 80-90% of the cortical volume and is the primary site of growth and steroidogenesis, producing 100-200 mg/day of the androgenic steroid, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEA-S). The physiological role of this zone during intrauterine life is not well understood. While the glands appear to be capable of DHEA-S synthesis early in gestation (8-10 weeks), we noticed that this event precedes the differentiation of hairs and sebaceous glands. Hairs begin to develop between 9 and 12 weeks and sebaceous glands between 13 and 15 weeks of gestation. Sebaceous glands form an oily secretion - sebum that mixes with desquamated epidermal cells to form vernix caseosa. Vernix caseosa protects the developing skin from constant exposure to amniotic fluid, and hairs helps to hold the vernix caseosa on the skin. We suggest therefore that the human fetal adrenal cortex produces DHEA-S beginning at around 8-10 weeks of gestation in sufficient quantities to influence the growth of hairs and sebaceous glands. Soon after birth, the fetal zone atrophies, and adrenal androgen production decreases to minimal levels. As a consequence, in concordance with the rapid decrease in adrenal androgen levels and in consistent with our hypothesis, fetal hairs are shed and sebaceous glands shrink to small structures. The mechanism that regulates fetal adrenal androgen production is a key unanswered problem in human adrenal biology. Since there exists a close relationship between epinephrine and DHEA-S levels during adrenarche which shows modulatory interactions between adrenal androgen production and adrenomedullary function, we suggest again that adrenomedullary function might play a role in the control of fetal adrenal androgen secretion.",M3
14690180,"Ultrastructural alterations in cortex of adrenal gland caused by the toxic effect of bee (Apis mellifera) venom.Bee accidents incidence is underestimated because many people do not consult to the physicians. Here it is described for the first time the severe mice adrenal gland damage induced by Apis mellifera venom. Biopsy specimens were obtained from mice adrenal gland and after sample preparation observed in Hitachi H-7100 electron microscope. In this work the ultrastructural analysis showed, 6 h after injection, a non homogeneous smooth endothelial reticulum, and in some places loss of plasma membrane. The fenestrae spaces were bigger and detritus in the capillary lumen were observed. Erythrocytes were seen in a <e>cortical</e> cell. After 48 h of venom injection, expanded fenestrae were observed. Capillary basal membrane was interrupted. Myelin-like figures and autophagic vacuoles were noticed. Swollen smooth endoplasmic reticulum elements and endothelial unfolding to the light were seen. Moreover, swollen Golgi and mitochondria were observed, in some places forming myelinic-like figures. At 144 h after venom injection, widened spaces were noticed in capillary fenestrae. Cellular section showed swollen and lost smooth endoplasmic reticulum elements. Smooth endoplasmic reticulum tubules disappearance suggested non steroidogenesis. In conclusion, we suggest that some of the bee envenoming human clinical manifestations, as is observed in mice, are determined by suprarenal gland damage produced by toxins present in this venom.",M3
14706680,"Developmental aspects of ovine adrenal adrenocorticotropic hormone receptor expression.OBJECTIVE: Maturation of adrenocortical function is important because a prepartum increase in fetal plasma glucocorticoids is required for survival after birth. Adrenal maturation may include alterations in the regulation of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) receptor expression. Therefore, we quantitated ACTH receptor expression in the ovine adrenal cortex during development and after manipulations to better understand the regulation of the adrenal receptor in vivo. METHODS: For the ontogeny study, adrenals were obtained from fetuses at different stages of development, and the <e>cortical</e> tissue was stored at -80C until total RNA was extracted. The ACTH binding studies were done on adrenal membranes obtained from fetuses at two different ages using I125 (Phe-2, Nle-4) ACTH as the ligand. Plasma ACTH was measured by two-site immunoradiometric assay, and cortisol was measured by radioimmunoassay. ACTH receptor mRNA was quantitated by ribonuclease protection assay. The data were analyzed by analyses of variance. RESULTS: ACTH receptor mRNA level progressively increased in fetal life; relative changes in receptor mRNA and binding were similar (3.0-fold and 2.4-fold, respectively). Physiologic increases in fetal plasma cortisol decreased adrenal ACTH receptor mRNA concentration, and there was a strong (r2=0.76, P&lt;.002) linear relationship between fetal plasma ACTH concentration and receptor mRNA levels. Receptor mRNA stability increased in development, and message half-life was greater in adulthood than in fetal life. CONCLUSION: The data suggest that developmental increases in receptor expression are part of the maturation process in the fetal adrenal and that plasma ACTH concentration plays a major role in regulating ACTH receptor mRNA levels in vivo.",M3
14560037,"Inhibition of adrenal <e>cortical</e> steroid formation by procaine is mediated by reduction of the cAMP-induced 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase messenger ribonucleic acid levels.Elevated glucocorticoid levels are associated with many diseases, including age-related depression, hypertension, Alzheimer's disease, and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. Cortisol-lowering agents could provide useful complementary therapy for these disorders. We examined the effect of procaine and procaine in a pharmaceutical formulation on adrenal cortical steroid formation. Procaine inhibited dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP)-induced corticosteroid synthesis by murine Y1 and human H295R adrenal cells in a dose-dependent manner without affecting basal steroid formation. Treatment of rats with the procaine-based formulation reduced circulating corticosterone levels. This steroidogenesis-inhibiting activity of procaine was not observed in Leydig cells, suggesting that the effect was specific to adrenocortical cells. In search of the mechanism underlying this inhibitory effect on cAMP-induced corticosteroidogenesis, procaine was found to affect neither the cAMP-dependent protein kinase activity nor key proteins involved in cholesterol transport into mitochondria, cytochrome P450 side chain cleavage enzyme expression, and enzymatic activities associated with cholesterol metabolism to final steroid products. However, procaine reduced in a dose-dependent manner the 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA) activity and the dbcAMP-induced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA levels by affecting mRNA stability. These data suggest that the inhibitory effect of procaine on cAMP-induced corticosteroid formation is due to the reduced synthesis of cholesterol. This modulatory effect of procaine on HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression was also seen in dbcAMP-stimulated Hepa1-6 mouse liver hepatoma cells. Taken together, these results suggest that procaine may provide a pharmacological means for the control of hormone-induced HMG-CoA reductase mRNA expression and hypercortisolemia.",M3
14578636,"The morphological and functional basis of the new conception about the suprarenal cortex regeneration.The exhaustion of main intracellular and cellular reserves of the regeneration in suprarenal cortex under the influence of exogenous hyperthermia activates the supplementary sources of cellular regeneration. First type of low differentiated <e>cortical</e> cells appears under the outer connective tissue capsule on approximately the 7(th) day of hyperthermia. These cells proliferate and some of them migrate along the cortical blood capillaries towards the deep portion of zona fasciculate. They differentiate into the typical cortical cells (spongiocytes) of zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculate according to their location. Second type of low differentiated cortical cells appears through one circadian-septal period (during 7 days) near the inner connective tissue capsule that separate cortex from the medulla. This cell type gradually differentiates into the typical cortical cells of zona reticularis. Stem cortical cells were found in suprarenal cortex.

14513274,"[Adrenocortical tumours]Adrenocortical tumours have to be differentiated from <e>cortical</e> hyperplasias, medullary tumours and extra-adrenal tumours or metastases. These diagnoses are mostly possible using routine paraffin sections. In some cases, immunostaining for differing cortical and medullary tumours and metastases are necessary. Adrenal hyperplasias can be congenital or acquired. They are diffuse, micronodular or macronodular and may be inactive or induce a cortical hyperfunction. Very rarely, macronodular hyperplasias may transform into autonomous adenomas. Primary, pigmented adrenocortical disease is a rare, special type of primary adrenal Cushing's syndrome, showing many small tumours with pleomorphic cells and an atrophic surrounding cortical tissue. Adrenal adenomas are mostly unilateral and solitary tumours weighing less than 50 g. Adrenal cortical carcinomas are mostly larger. Like the adenomas, they may be inactive and may induce a hypercortisolism, a hyperandrogenism or (very rarely in carcinomas) a hyperaldosteronism. Differentiating cortical adenomas and carcinomas is difficult in some cases but is possible using a diagnostic algorithm. Myelolipomas are benign, inactive tumours composed of mature fat cells and bone marrow cells. They have to be differentiated from adenomas with myelolipomatous metaplasia. Further, rare primary cortical tumours are mentioned.",M3
14557481,"Laminin isoforms in fetal and adult human adrenal cortex.Laminin has been proposed to influence the function of human adrenal cortex. We have studied the distribution of laminin (Ln) chains using immunofluorescence in human fetal and adult adrenal cortex. In the fetal gland Ln alpha2- and alpha5-chains were weakly expressed in the definitive zone, whereas Ln alpha4-, beta1-, and gamma1-chains occurred around vessels. In the adult gland, Ln alpha2-, alpha5-, and gamma1-chains were found in epithelial basement membranes (BM) in all <e>cortical</e> zones, Ln alpha4-chain in vessels, Ln beta1-chain in outer zone, and Ln beta2-chain in the two inner zones of the cortex, respectively. Among the integrins in adult gland, integrin alpha(3)-subunit was confined to basal surfaces of cortical cells, alpha(6) to vessels, alpha(1) to the stroma, and alpha(2) diffusely to epithelial cells. Lutheran glycoprotein and dystroglycan occurred in the fetal gland diffusely in the definitive zone and throughout the epithelium in the adult. The isoform composition of BM of the adult adrenal gland is distinct, with Ln-2 and -10 in BM of the outer zone and Ln-4 and -11 in BM of the two inner zones. The results suggest that integrin alpha(3)beta(1) and Lutheran are candidate receptors for Ln-10 and -11, whereas dystroglycan probably binds Ln-2 and -4.",M3
12915689,"Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease: paradoxical responses of cortisol secretion to dexamethasone occur in vitro and are associated with increased expression of the glucocorticoid receptor.Primary pigmented nodular adrenocortical disease (PPNAD) is a rare cause of ACTH-independent adrenal Cushing's syndrome (CS), which is often associated with Carney complex (CNC). We have recently described a paradoxical increase in cortisol excretion after dexamethasone administration in most patients with PPNAD. In the present study we investigated the hypothesis that this phenomenon is due to a primary abnormality of the tissues affected by PPNAD, rather than a defect of the patients' hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis; as such it should be replicated in vitro by adrenal slices exposed directly to dexamethasone. We were able to study adrenal tissues from eight patients with CS caused by PPNAD; two patients were also studied in vivo according to a protocol first described in ACTH-independent macronodular adrenal hyperplasia (AIMAH) for the clinical detection of aberrant hormone receptor expression. Their DNA has been previously screened for inactivating mutations of the PRKAR1A gene, the most frequent molecular defect leading to PPNAD and/or CNC. We also investigated whether glucocorticoid receptor (GR) expression underlies paradoxical dexamethasone responses in PPNAD by immunohistochemistry and semiquantitative PCR, and we correlated GR expression with that of other markers for PPNAD (e.g. synaptophysin). Indeed, we demonstrated that dexamethasone induced cortisol secretion in vitro in five of these tumors; no such increase was seen in adenomatous or AIMAH tissues that were treated in the same manner. GR mRNA was expressed, and GR immunoreactivity was detected in PPNAD nodular cells. Staining for GR was not seen in surrounding <e>cortical</e> cells, and hence, it correlated with synaptophysin, which also stains PPNAD in a similar manner. In normal adrenal tissue, GR was detected mostly in medullary areas, whereas GR immunoreactivity was weak in adenomatous and AIMAH tissues. We conclude that 1) dexamethasone produces an increase in glucocorticoid synthesis by PPNAD adrenal slices in vitro, suggesting a direct effect on adrenocortical tissue, and 2) this phenomenon is accompanied by increased expression of the GR in PPNAD nodules. PPNAD and/or CNC patients with and without mutations leading to protein kinase A activation demonstrated in vitro and/or in vivo paradoxical dexamethasone responses and GR expression, indicating that PRKAR1A alterations are not necessary for these phenomena.",M3
12943735,"Regulation of differential COUP-TF-coregulator interactions in adrenal <e>cortical</e> steroidogenesis.Hyperfunctioning adrenocortical adenomas produce excessive amounts of various corticosteroids due to dysregulated expression of steroidogenic enzymes. Since no genetic mutations in steroidogenic enzyme genes have been identified as yet, the dysregulated expression at the transcription level may be crucial. Chicken ovalbumin upstream promoter-transcription factors (COUP-TFs) and steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1) play key roles in the transcriptional regulation of steroidogenic P450 genes. Transfection studies showed that SF-1 activated and COUP-TFs repressed the transcription of bovine CYP17 gene promoter from the CRS2 element in a mutually exclusive manner in Y-1 cells. The results indicate that COUP-TFs negatively regulate the transcriptional activity of SF-1, a steroidogenic cell-specific activator of various steroidogenic P450 genes. Expression of both COUP-TFI and COUP-TFII was significantly decreased in the cortisol-producing adenomas, in which CYP17 was drastically overexpressed, indicating that decreased expression of COUP-TFs play a key role in overexpression of CYP17 in this type of tumors. We then screened for COUP-TFI-interacting proteins from a cortisol-producing adenoma cDNA library using a yeast two-hybrid system and identified a novel RING finger-containing protein which can function as a coregulator for COUP-TFI. Notably, COUP-TFI activated rather than repressed several target genes including the human CYP11B2 gene promoter, the results of which were opposite to those of the CYP17 promoter. The bifunctional activities of COUP-TFI may be derived from the promoter context and our newly identified COUP-TFI coregulator.",M3
12768539,"Role of adrenocorticotropic hormone in the development and maintenance of the adrenal <e>cortical</e> vasculature.The adrenal cortex is a highly vascularized endocrine tissue. A dense network of blood capillaries centripetally irrigates the adrenal gland, allowing every endocrine cell to be in contact with an endothelial cell. The pituitary hormone ACTH controls the coordinated development of the vasculature and the endocrine tissue mass. This suggests that paracrine secretions between steroidogenic adrenocytes and capillary endothelial cells participate in the control of adrenocortical homeostasis. Besides its effect on the vascular tone of arteries, ACTH induces the expression of the angiogenic cytokine VEGF-A (vascular endothelial growth factor-A) in primary cultures of adrenocortical cells. This growth factor is a specific mitogen for endothelial cells and is likely to mediate the hormonal control of adrenocortical vascularization through a paracrine mechanism. The newly discovered angiogenic factor EG-VEGF (endocrine-gland-derived vascular endothelial growth factor), the expression of which is restricted to endocrine glands and which is preferentially mitogenic for endocrine tissue-derived endothelial cells, is another candidate mediator of great potential interest.",M3
12822893,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is a constitutively expressed cytokine in the human adrenal gland.Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) has been found to be widely expressed in many cell types throughout the body and appears to play several physiologic roles. We sought to determine the expression and cellular distribution of MIF in human fetal (HFA) and adult (HAA) adrenals. A single band of approximately 0.8 kb was revealed by northern blot hybridization using cDNA probes for MIF in total RNA extracts of both HFA and HAA tissues. Immunohistochemical analysis showed strong immunostaining for MIF in the broad fetal zone of the HFA and in both the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis of HAA. The cells of the zona fasciculata of the HAA and of the neocortex of the HFA were only minimally, if at all, immunopositive for MIF and medullary elements were consistently negative for MIF. These results are indicative of local production of MIF in adrenocortical cells during intrauterine development and also in adulthood. The role of MIF in <e>cortical</e> cells of the human adrenal gland remains to be determined.",M3
12734728,"Functional results after endoscopic subtotal <e>cortical</e>-sparing adrenalectomy.PURPOSE: We examined the required amount of residual adrenal tissue and whether an intact adrenal vein are necessary to achieve sufficient function after endoscopic subtotal adrenalectomy. METHOD: Endoscopic subtotal adrenalectomy was performed in 14 patients. Two patients underwent unilateral subtotal and contralateral total adrenalectomy and another two patients underwent unilateral subtotal adrenalectomy after contralateral total adrenalectomy several years earlier. We analyzed the postoperative serum levels of cortisol and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH). Patients with bilateral tumors underwent an ACTH test. RESULTS: We had to cut the main adrenal vein in ten patients, and less than one third of the adrenal gland was left in situ in four patients. Subtotal adrenalectomy was performed unilaterally in two patients with bilateral tumors. One third of the adrenal gland was preserved in these patients, and also in the two patients with unilateral subtotal adrenalectomy after previous contralateral total adrenalectomy. The postoperative ACTH test confirmed satisfactory adrenocortical function. During the follow-up period of about 24 months no recurrent tumors have been found. CONCLUSION: Subtotal cortical-sparing adrenalectomy can be successfully performed laparoscopically. The venous drainage of the main adrenal vein does not seem to be crucial for sufficient adrenocortical function. We estimate that leaving about one third of the entire adrenal gland as remnant adrenal tissue will result in sufficient function.",M3
12768538,"ACTH and adrenocortical gap junctions.Since the initial identification of gap junctions in the adrenal gland, it has been proposed that a system involving direct cell-cell communication might be involved in adrenal <e>cortical</e> functions. Gap junction channels do, in fact, provide pathways for direct intercellular exchange of small molecules (&lt;1,000 Da), many of which have the potential to influence a wide range of cellular activities. Gap junctions are composed of proteins called connexin which, in the adrenal cortex, have proven to be remarkably consistent in both type and zonal distribution with connexin 43 (Cx43) as the predominant component in mammalian adrenal glands thus far evaluated. Only the inner two zones of the cortex (zonae fasciculata and reticularis) exhibit significant amounts of Cx43 and functional coupling. Adrenocorticotropin (ACTH) has been shown to increase Cx43 protein in vivo and in vitro, and a strong correlation has been noted between the presence of gap junctions and certain adrenal cortical functions, especially steroidogenic capacity and cell proliferation. This review summarizes evidence of the Cx43 expression in adrenal cortical cells and the likely role of Cx43 in steroidogenesis and cell proliferation. It is concluded that control of gap junction expression in the adrenal gland is hormonally dependent and is functionally linked to adrenal gland zonation.",M3
12720169,"The adrenal cortex in experimental congenital diaphragmatic hernia.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Adrenal <e>cortical</e> malfunction was found recently in patients with severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH). The current study tests the hypothesis that the development and function of the adrenal cortex could be abnormal in an experimental model of CDH. METHODS: Pregnant rats were exposed on day 9.5 of gestation to 100 mg of 2-4-dichlorophenyl-p-nitrophenyl ether (nitrofen) diluted in olive oil. The sham group was treated only with oil. Fetuses were recovered on the 21st day, bled, and examined for the presence or absence of CDH. Adrenal glands from sham and CDH animals were dissected, weighed, and prepared for histologic, biochemical, and immunohistochemical studies (ki-67) aimed at measuring total DNA, total protein, and the proportion of proliferating cells. Serum corticosterone levels were assayed. The results in both groups were compared with parametric tests with a significance level of P &lt;.05. RESULTS: The adrenal weight was not different in CDH animals versus controls (0.049 +/- 0.014 v 0.052 +/- 0.012% of body weight; not significant). Total DNA was reduced significantly (1.180 +/- 0.481 v 1.909 +/- 0.893 microgram P &lt;.05) with unchanged DNA to protein ratio. Proliferation index in both groups was 20.1 +/- 3.1% and 26.5 +/- 7.5%, respectively (not significant), and the proliferating cells were mainly located in the glomerular areas of the glands. Corticosterone levels were similar in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Nitrofen induces very slight changes in the development of adrenal glands of fetal rats, expressed by reduced cell proliferation especially in glomerular areas, reduced total DNA with preservation of cell sizes (constant DNA to protein ratio), with no change in function because corticosterone levels remained unchanged. It is doubtful that primary adrenal malformation/malfunction contributes to the severity of CDH in this model.",M3
12710887,"C-terminal fragment of tetanus toxin heavy chain activates Akt and MEK/ERK signalling pathways in a Trk receptor-dependent manner in cultured <e>cortical</e> neurons.Previous publications from our group [Gil, Chaib, Pelliccioni and Aguilera (2000) FEBS Lett. 481, 177-182; Gil, Chaib, Blasi and Aguilera (2001) Biochem. J. 356, 97-103] have reported the activation, in rat brain synaptosomes, of several phosphoproteins, such as neurotrophin tyrosine kinase (Trk) A receptor, phospholipase Cgamma-1, protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms and extracellular-signal-regulated kinases 1 and 2 (ERK-1/2). In the present study, we examined, by means of phospho-specific antibodies, the activation of the signalling cascades involving neurotrophin Trk receptor, Akt kinase and ERK pathway, in cultured cortical neurons from foetal rat brain, by tetanus toxin (TeTx) as well as by the C-terminal part of its heavy chain (H(C)-TeTx). TeTx and H(C)-TeTx induce fast and transient phosphorylation of Trk receptor at Tyr(674) and Tyr(675), but not at Tyr(490), although the potency of TeTx in this action was higher when compared with H(C)-TeTx action. Moreover, H(C)-TeTx and TeTx also induced phosphorylation of Akt (at Ser(473) and Thr(308)) and of ERK-1/2 (Thr(202)/Tyr(204)), in a time- and concentration-dependent manner. The detection of TeTx- and H(C)-TeTx-induced phosphorylation at Ser(9) of glycogen synthase kinase 3beta confirms Akt activation. In the extended analysis of the ERK pathway, phosphorylation of the Raf, mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase (MEK)-1/2 and p90Rsk kinases and phosphorylation of the transcription factor cAMP-response-element-binding protein were detected. The use of tyrphostin AG879, an inhibitor of Trk receptors, demonstrates their necessary participation in the H(C)-TeTx-induced activation of Akt and ERK pathways, as well as in the phosphorylation of phospholipase Cgamma-1. Furthermore, both pathways are totally dependent on phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase action, and they are independent of PKC action, as assessed using wortmannin and Ro-31-8220 as inhibitors. The activation of PKC isoforms was determined by their translocation from the cytosolic compartment to the membranous compartment, showing a clear H(C)-TeTx-induced translocation of PKC-alpha and -beta, but not of PKC- epsilon.",M3

Adrenal glands were examined by CT scan and 131I-MIBG imaging. Pathological examination was performed after operation. The results showed that in 6 cases of hypercatecholaminenia (3 men and 3 women) aged from 34-50 years, the clinical features were just like  pheochromocytoma , for example, episodic headache, perspiration, palpitation, pallor, apprehension, nausea, tremor, anxiety and so on. Plasma levels of CA, NE and E were elevated in all 6 cases. 24-h urinary samples obtained at the onset revealed elevated VMA in 1 case. 24-h urinary cortisol was obviously elevated in all 6 cases. 24-h urinary 17-OHCS, 17-KS was normal. B-type ultrasound, CT, MRI and 131I-MIBG revealed 9 lateral adrenal gland diffuse or nodular enlargement in 6 cases. Pathologic examination showed adrenal cortical and medullary hyperplasia. Clinically, adrenal cortical and medullary hyperplasia resembled  pheochromocytoma . The most significant feature of this disease was both elevated plasma CA and 24-h urinary cortisol obviously. Pathologic examination showed adrenal cortex nodular hyperplasia and medullar diffuse or limit hyperplasia.

12628485,"Transcriptional suppression of the adrenal <e>cortical</e> peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor gene and inhibition of steroid synthesis by ginkgolide B.Treatment of rats and adrenocortical cells with ginkgolide B (GKB), a purified component of Ginkgo biloba leaf extracts, reduces the mRNA, protein, and ligand-binding levels of the adrenal peripheral-type benzodiazepine receptor (PBR), a mitochondrial cholesterol-binding protein, leading to decreased corticosteroid synthesis. In the Y1 adrenocortical cell line, GKB reduced both PBR levels and cyclic AMP-induced steroid formation. In these cells, GKB, but not various steroids and vitamins, reduced the expression of a reporter gene driven by the DNA sequence -624/-513 relative to the transcription start site of the PBR encoding gene. GKB treatment did not affect the SV40 promoter and increased the cytochrome P450 17alpha-hydroxylase gene promoter driven expression of the reporter gene. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) indicated the presence of a functional transcriptional element bound to the -624/-513 DNA fragment. This GKB-induced inhibition of PBR was mediated by an interaction with a transcription factor that binds to the -636/-616 PBR-promoter region. Deletion or mutation of this sequence eliminated the DNA-protein interaction and the inhibitory effect of GKB on PBR gene transcription. This DNA-binding protein could be detected in nuclear extracts of rat brain, liver, and testis, but not kidney. It is also present in the human adrenal glands. However, the inhibitory effect following GKB treatment could be seen only in the adrenal glands. These results demonstrate that the GKB-activated inhibition of glucocorticoid production is due to a specific transcriptional suppression of the adrenal PBR gene and suggest that GKB might serve as a pharmacological tool to control excess glucocorticoid formation.",M3
12608705,"New aspects on primary aldosteronism.The adrenal cortex synthesizes and releases steroid hormones, mainly mineralocorticoids and glucocorticoids. There is a functional zonation of the adrenal cortex and steroid synthesis is thoroughly regulated. Overproduction of aldosterone, primary aldosteronism, may be much more common than previously known and may be responsible for 10% of essential hypertension. Primary aldosteronism is characterized by autonomous production of aldosterone, suppressed renin activity, hypokalemia, and hypertension. The two most common forms are unilateral adenoma and bilateral hyperplasia. In spite of thorough clinical workup and careful histopathology it is often difficult to differentiate between adenoma and hyperplasia. The gene CYP11B2 encodes the steroid synthesizing enzymes for aldosterone production, while the genes CYP17 and CYP11B1 are needed for cortisol production. Most normal controls show expression of CYP11B2 in zona glomerulosa. Expression of CYP11B1 and CYP17 is seen in zona fasciculata and reticularis, whereas the expression of CYP21 is present in all three <e>cortical</e> layers. Adenomas from patients with primary aldosteronism show considerable variation in the expression of CYP11B2. Adenomas from patients with Cushing's syndrome have a strong expression of CYP11B1 and CYP17. In a patient material of 29 cases of primary aldosteronism, 4 patients had small nodules detected with expression of CYP11B2 gene. These nodules were not visualized on CT, whereas adrenal masses seen on CT in these patients showed CYP11B1 and CYP17 gene expression. This suggests that these small nodules are responsible for the aldosterone production and this is characteristic of nodular hyperplasia in patients with primary aldosteronism. In conclusion, this method to visualize mRNA gene expression of steroidogenic enzymes, and especially expression of CYP11B2, has increased the knowledge of adrenal pathophysiology. The results emphasize the value to include functional studies (venous sampling and/or scintigraphy) in the preoperative work up of patients with primary aldosteronism.",M3
19757625,"Polycystic and chronic kidney disease in a young degu (Octodon degus).A young adult (approximately 20 months), 125 g, female degu (Octodon degus) was housed with a male degu for approximately 1.2 years as a breeding pair. The female was multiparous and had weaned its third litter 2 weeks earlier. The degu was reported to the veterinary service for bloody vaginal discharge and a hunched, thin appearance of 1 day's duration. On physical examination, it exhibited cachexia, molting, slight matting of the hair around the eyes, and moderate dehydration. Hematology results included anemia and leukopenia with lymphocytopenia. Biochemical abnormalities included severe azotemia and phosphatemia. Urine specific gravity was 1.016. The condition of this animal prohibited its continued use in the breeding colony, so it was submitted for necropsy. On gross examination, the left kidney measured 10 x 15 mm, had an irregular surface, and was pale and mildly enlarged, consistent with compensatory hypertrophy. The right kidney was small (5 x 8 mm) and cystic. Both adrenal glands appeared mildly enlarged. Histologically, the left kidney had multiple regions with chronic, diffuse interstitial nephritis, and the right kidney was polycystic. There was mild, focal, <e>cortical</e> nodular hyperplasia in the adrenal glands. In the uterus, there was unilateral, locally extensive necrosis of the endometrium. The clinical chemistry results and histopathology findings are supportive of a diagnosis of renal failure secondary to chronic nephritis and polycystic kidney disease. The etiology of the nephritis is unknown. Polycystic kidney disease can be congenital or hereditary in other rodents.",M3
12607610,"Increased expression of adenylyl cyclase isoforms in the adrenal gland of diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rat.The spontaneously diabetic Goto-Kakizaki rat harbors the same defects expressed in human type 2 diabetes. It is not clear, however, whether stress factors emanating from the adrenal glands are involved in causing the diabetic state. For that reason, the authors studied gland size and expression of adenylyl cyclase isoforms in adrenal glands from Goto-Kakizaki and normal rats. Goto-Kakizaki rat adrenals were found to weigh only about half as much as those of control rats. This decrease was the result of a reduction of the cortex, especially of the zona fasciculata, whereas the medulla was unaffected. Cell density measurements showed that the total number of medullary cells in Goto-Kakizaki rats was lower than that in controls. In the cortex, the cell density did not differ between the two groups; thus, our results point to a marked hypotrophy. In the medulla of Goto-Kakizaki rats, the nuclear size was significantly increased, and there was also an overexpression of adenylyl cyclase 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 isoforms in the adrenalin-producing cells, indicating an increased functional capacity. In the cortex, despite the <e>cortical</e> hypotrophy, adenylyl cyclase 5 immunoreactivity was markedly increased in Goto-Kakizaki rats, especially in the zona reticularis. It is unclear whether this morphologic change in the diabetic adrenal glands together with the overexpression of different adenylyl cyclase isoforms plays a role in the pathogenesis of this diabetic state or is a genetic defect or compensatory mechanism of diabetes in this spontaneous rodent model of type 2 diabetes.",M3
12600995,"An inverse correlation between expression of a preprocathepsin B-related protein with cysteine-rich sequences and steroid 11beta -hydroxylase in adrenocortical cells.A cDNA encoding a secretory protein hitherto unknown was cloned from mouse adrenocortical cells by subtractive hybridization between the cells without and with expressing steroid 11beta-hydroxylase (Cyp11b-1), a marker for the functional differentiation of cells in the zonae fasciculata reticularis (zFR). The deduced protein consisting of 466 amino acids contained a secretory signal, epidermal growth factor-like repeats, and a proteolytically inactive cathepsin B-related sequence. The amino acid sequence was 89% identical with that of human tubulointerstitial nephritis antigen-related protein. Among the mouse organs examined, adrenal glands prominently expressed its mRNA. The mRNA and its encoded protein were detected in the outer adrenocortical zones that do not express Cyp11b-1, i.e. the zona glomerulosa and the undifferentiated cell zone, while being undetectable in zFR that express Cyp11b-1. The new protein was designated as adrenocortical zonation factor 1 (AZ-1). Clonal lines with different levels of AZ-1 expression were established from Y-1 adrenocortical cells that originally express Cyp11b-1 but little AZ-1. Analyses of the clonal lines revealed that Cyp11b-1 is detected in the clonal lines maintaining little AZ-1 expression and becomes undetectable in those expressing AZ-1. On the other hand, irrespective of the AZ-1 expression, all clones expressed cholesterol side-chain cleavage enzyme, which occurs throughout the <e>cortical</e> zones. These results demonstrated that adrenocortical cells expressing AZ-1 do not express Cyp11b-1, whereas those with little AZ-1 express this zFR marker in vitro and in vivo, implying a putative role of AZ-1 in determining the zonal differentiation of adrenocortical cells.",M3
12530684,"Proliferation of capsular stem cells induced by ACTH in the rat adrenal cortex.Despite great efforts devoted to clarifying the localization of proliferative activity in the adrenal cortex, the agents that stimulate proliferation remain controversial, and the nature of the stem cells from which <e>cortical</e> cells differentiate is incompletely understood. We studied proliferative activity in the rat adrenal cortex using an immunohistochemical method to detect the presence of the Proliferating Cell Nuclear Antigen (PCNA) (an intranuclear enzyme whose synthesis reaches the maximum intensity during the S-phase of the cell cycle). Groups of six rats were subjected to daily intraperitoneal injection of either corticotropin (ACTH1-24--0.2 mg/kg), dexamethasone (Dexa--4 mg/kg) or 0.9% saline for three consecutive days and killed 24 h after the last injection. Adrenal weight was significantly increased by ACTH treatment and reduced by Dexa. Concentrations of endogenous ACTH in plasma were lower in the Dexa group than in controls, and curiously, this was true in the ACTH1-24 treated group as well, probably in consequence of the increased corticosterone levels providing negative feedback at the hypothalamic-pituitary level. Corticosterone levels, as expected, were increased by the ACTH stimulus and reduced by the use of Dexa. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining was close to zero in Dexa treated animals and low in controls. In ACTH treated rats, a significantly increased number of cells were positively stained. Positive cells were identified in both in zona glomerulosa (ZG) and zona intermedia (ZI) but many were located in the capsule. Zona fasciculata (ZF) and zona reticularis (ZR) were devoid of staining in all of these cases. We conclude that pharmacological doses of ACTH induce proliferation of capsular fibroblasts. Following descriptions by early 20th century researchers it is possible that these cells may also be stem cells and differentiate into adrenal cortex cells.",M3
