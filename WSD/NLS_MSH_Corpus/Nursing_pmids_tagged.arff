20559180,"What is it so stressful about caring for a dying patient? A qualitative study of nurses' experiences.The <e>nursing</e> shortage continues to be a problem in the United States, in part, owing to the experience of stress and burnout by practicing nurses. With an ageing population, the stress of caring for dying patients and their families is one reason for the high levels of stress and burnout. Although we know that caring for dying patients is stressful for nurses, there is little information about the specific aspects of that experience that concern them. In order to alleviate the stress and to help nurses cope more effectively with this situation, this research examined the aspects of caring for a dying patient that cause concern for nurses. This study used a grounded theory approach to examine the experiences of nurses and their particular concerns about caring for a dying patient. Nurses expressed personal concerns, concerns about the patient and their families, which include communication challenges with both patients and families.",M1

The objective of this qualitative study was to understand how individuals cope with job retraining in a public hospital, utilizing interviews to understand how nursing professionals coped with the retraining process, which were then analyzed using Content Analysis as proposed by Bardin. The responses revealed problems in several areas of nursing work: Work Organization, Teamwork, Sick leave and retraining, and Team Management, altogether generating suggestions for improving the work experience in retraining. The retraining process generated individual, professional and social feelings of incompetence and guilt for workers. Important reflection and attitude changes are urgently needed, supporting team management, which will consequently improve care provided to the public.",M1

AIM: The aim of this study is to explore the relationship between coping strategies and job satisfaction. METHODS: A self report questionnaire was administered to all the nurses working in health services and hospitals of Padua province and to free lance nurses members of the College of Nurses, to collect information on coping strategies and job satisfaction. RESULTS: 2264 questionnaires were returned (71%). Active coping strategies are adopted mainly from older nurses while avoiding strategies are prevalent among younger. An association was observed between job satisfaction and active coping strategies, aimed at problem solving: active strategies increase job satisfaction while avoiding strategies descrease it. CONCLUSIONS: Individual coping strategies implemented to face difficult situations are associated to job satisfaction.",M1

The aim of this paper is to describe an educational strategy for teaching standardized nursing languages (SNL) used in both the classroom and clinical components of a psychiatric-mental health nursing course at the associate degree level. DATA SOURCES. Data included a review of the relevant literature, teaching experiences, and faculty and student experiences. DATA SYNTHESIS. Enhancing associate degree student nurses' competency regarding diagnosis and interventions is essential to influence positive health outcomes. Use of diagnostic, outcome, and intervention classifications for learning nursing care promotes critical thinking, individualization of nursing care, and students' fluency with SNL. One possible teaching strategy to assist students to learn and use SNL was implemented through the use of a faculty-developed Student Nurse Documentation Packet. CONCLUSIONS. The educational strategy provided students opportunities to enhance their experience with the SNL to plan and document care of individuals experiencing psychiatric-mental health problems. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING. The educational strategy used in this program was judged to be successful. Research is needed to provide empirical evidence of the efficacy of this pedagogical strategy for increasing knowledge and enhancing students' competency.",M1

For this, management instruments are available which help them to determine the staff needed in the nursing team. This descriptive study aims to evaluate the nursing workload at a specialized clinical and surgical gastroenterology unit. To collect data, the Nursing Activities Score (NAS) was used during 30 consecutive days, with 1080 comments, obtained from the records of 149 patients. The mean NAS score was 34.9% and, considering that each point of NAS corresponds to 0.24 hour, on the average, 8.4 hours of nursing care were required within 24 hours. This means that this profile is of patients who demand intermediate and semi-intensive care, which suggests that the NAS study can be used to evaluate the workload of nurses at that unit.",M1

Standardization was performed for inter-ward analysis by converting ward-specific crude measures to ward-specific relative measures by dividing observed/expected. Two charts: acceptable and tolerable daily nurse workload intensity, were defined. Appropriate staffing indicators were defined as those exceeding predefined rates within acceptable and tolerable limits (50 percent and 80 percent respectively). FINDINGS: A total of 42 percent of the overall days fell within acceptable control limits and 71 percent within tolerable control limits. Appropriate staffing indicators were met in only 33 percent of wards regarding acceptable nurse workload intensity and in only 45 percent of wards regarding tolerable workloads. RESEARCH LIMITATIONS/IMPLICATIONS: The study work did not differentiate crude nurse attendance and it did not take into account patient severity since crude bed occupancy was used. Double statistical process control charts and certain staffing indicators were used, which is open to debate. PRACTICAL IMPLICATIONS: Wards that met appropriate staffing indicators prove the method's feasibility. Wards that did not meet appropriate staffing indicators prove the importance and the need for process evaluations and monitoring. Methods presented for monitoring daily staffing appropriateness are simple to implement either for intra-ward day-to-day variation by using nurse workload capacity statistical process control charts or for inter-ward evaluation using standardized measure of nurse workload intensity. The real challenge will be to develop planning systems and implement corrective interventions such as dynamic and flexible daily staffing, which will face difficulties and barriers. ORIGINALITY/VALUE: The paper fulfils the need for workforce utilization evaluation. A simple method using available data for daily staffing appropriateness evaluation, which is easy to implement and operate, is presented. The statistical process control method enables intra-ward evaluation, while standardization by converting crude into relative measures enables inter-ward analysis. The staffing indicator definitions enable performance evaluation. This original study uses statistical process control to develop simple standardization methods and applies straightforward statistical tools. This method is not limited to crude measures, rather it uses weighted workload measures such as nursing acuity or weighted nurse level (i.e. grade/band).",M1
19953755,"Innovations in technology--Novalung iLA: challenges for the field of critical care <e>nursing</e>.The Novalung interventional lung assist (iLA) device is a new pumpless extracorporeal gas exchange device that imitates the native lung because it allows for protective mechanical ventilation by the reduction of tidal volumes and decreased end expiratory pressures. It is a rescue device for patients with refractory lung failure, as well as a bridge to lung transplantation. While used in Europe for some years, the Novalung iLA has been recently approved by both Health Canada and our facility, as a bridge to lung transplantation. In this article, the author discusses the introduction of this new advancement in extracorporeal gas exchange into an adult critical care setting. First, the author presents an overview of this new technology and how it differs from the traditional model of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation, and then shares the process in which the anticipated challenges of this device introduction were addressed in one institution. Particular attention is paid to the education of the nursing staff. A plan was developed to deliver information, education and training guidelines to prepare for patients requiring a bridge to lung transplantation with this device within the medical surgical intensive care unit in our hospital. Subsequently, these initiatives have expanded to include a workshop and a simulation experience.",M1

A vaccination exists to aid in the prevention of cervical cancer; an estimated 70% of cases could be avoided with the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine. However, women of Hispanic descent have many access barriers. By identifying and addressing such barriers, nurses can play a significant role in educating Hispanic women about the benefits of vaccination before HPV exposure occurs. Theoretical integration with Leininger's Culture Care Theory of Diversity and Universality provides a framework to address cultural differences and awareness when educating Hispanic women about this health issue. Additional nursing research into effective communication and educational programs to help reach the Hispanic population continues to be a priority in this vulnerable community.",M1

19929157,"Men in <e>nursing</e>: re-evaluating masculinities, re-evaluating gender.This paper critically interrogates and re-evaluates the notion that it is somehow difficult being a man in nursing and suggests some ways forward which will allow us to gain a more politically astute purchase on gender, nursing and the socio-political context in which the profession operates. Men appear to be well served by a career in nursing. Despite their lesser numbers they are likely to earn more and be promoted into leadership roles more readily. Yet there is a pervasive sense in the literature on men in nursing that they feel unhappy as a minority in a predominantly female occupation and feel a disjuncture between masculine identity and the nursing role. The genealogy of this idea can be traced to a more extensive literature in the 'men's movement', in sex role theory and masculinity studies which has tended to focus on the putative hurts that men suffer as they are socialized into the male role. This is itself informed by experiences and discourses from therapy, and privileges these kinds of experiences over and above more sober consideration of the respective powers of men and women and the sociopolitical context of the profession. This 'poor me' discourse deflects attention away from the business of tackling material inequalities and enables men to encroach further into the agenda of nursing discussions. Instead, a view of men and women in nursing is proposed which is attentive to the historical and political operations of power and which sees subjective experiences as the effects of power rather than as a starting point for analysis. We must place individual experience coherently and exhaustively in the material environment of social space and time. It is in this way that we can genuinely advance the interest of men and women and build an effective profile for the profession as a whole.",M1

19906284,"Particularizing spirituality in points of tension: enriching the discourse.The tremendous growth in <e>nursing</e> literature about spirituality has garnered proportionately little critique. Part of the reason may be that the broad generalizing claims typical of this literature have not been sufficiently explicated so that their particular implications for a practice discipline could be evaluated. Further, conceptualizations that attempt to encompass all possible views are difficult to challenge outside of a particular location. However, once one assumes a particular location in relation to spirituality, then the question becomes how one resolves the tension between what are essentially theological or philosophical commitments and professional commitments. In this study, we discuss the tension between these perspectives using the idea of a responsible nursing response to spiritual pluralism. We then problematize three claims about spirituality in nursing discourse based upon our location as scholars influenced by Christian theological understandings: (i) the claim that all individuals are spiritual; (ii) the claim that human spirituality can be assessed and evaluated; and (iii) the claim that spirituality is a proper domain of nursing's concern and intervention. We conclude by suggesting that the widely shared values of social justice, compassion and human dignity may well serve as a grounding for the critique of spiritual discourses in nursing across particularized positions.",M1

The goal of this project was to increase interest in nursing as a career among local high school students in order to impact the nursing shortage and improve the health of Northern Kentuckians. Pathways to Nursing activities allowed high school students to explore post-secondary nursing education by participating in nursing career day activities at the university and summer nursing camp which included an overnight stay at the university and nurse shadowing days at the local hospital. High school students were exposed to various clinical experiences, diverse nursing roles, nursing skills laboratory activities and human simulation activities. Students also met with nursing faculty, academic advisors, and university admissions counselors. One hundred and twenty-four high school students participated in Nurse Career Days over the two-year period of the program, and 45 students participated in Summer Nurse Camp over two summers. Ninety-four percent of the high school students who participated in Nurse Career Day stated they would  probably choose  or  definitely choose  the university to attend nursing school; 93.6% stated they  might want to be a nurse  or  definitely would want to be a nurse , and 93.7% rated the information covered as very relevant. Sixty-two percent of the students reported that they  definitely want to be a nurse  after attendance at Summer Nurse Camp. The goal of the Pathways to Nursing program was to provide Northern Kentucky high school students the opportunity to explore nursing through active learning experiences that augment career and academic interests.

The purpose of this paper is to describe the relevance of authentic leadership to the advancement of nursing leadership practice and research and address the question of whether this is a new theory for leadership or an old one in new packaging. DESIGN/METHODOLOGY/APPROACH: The paper outlines the origins and key elements of the model, assesses the theoretical, conceptual and measurement issues associated with authentic leadership and compares it with other leadership theories frequently reported in the nursing literature. FINDINGS: The emerging authentic leadership theory holds promise for explaining the underlying processes by which authentic leaders and followers influence work outcomes and organizational performance. Construct validity of authentic leadership has preliminary documentation and a few studies have shown positive relationships between authenticity and trust. Furthermore, the clarity of the authenticity construct and comprehensiveness of the overall theoretical framework provide a fruitful base for future research examining the relationship between authentic leadership and the creation of healthier work environments.

DATA SOURCES: PubMed and the Cumulative Index to <e>Nursing</e> and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) database were searched for study selection using MeSH terms infant/premature, breastfeeding, weight gain, patient discharge, postnatal care, and counseling. STUDY SELECTION: Inclusion criteria included studies that involved preterm infants who were born less than or equal to 37 weeks of gestation, randomized controlled trials that were in English, conducted in developed countries, and had breastfeeding and weight gain outcomes. A total of 8 articles met inclusion criteria. DATA EXTRACTION: All data related to breastfeeding outcomes including duration, exclusivity, maternal satisfaction, and weight gain were extracted from the randomized controlled trials for the purpose of data synthesis. DATA SYNTHESIS: A total of 310 studies were reviewed. Eight randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria. Gestational age of the infants in the studies ranged from 26 to 37 weeks. The results revealed that kangaroo care, peer counseling, in-home breast milk intake measurement, and postdischarge lactation support improved breastfeeding outcomes among preterm infants, and that maternal satisfaction improved with postdischarge interventions. No significant evidence of pre- and postdischarge interventions on weight gain was found. CONCLUSIONS: Pre- and postdischarge interventions were effective in promoting breastfeeding exclusivity, duration, and maternal satisfaction among mothers of preterm infants. These findings have important clinical implications that support the need for evidence-based breastfeeding interventions for preterm infants before discharge and vigilant postdischarge support. Research to determine more effective interventions to promote exclusive and long-term breastfeeding among preterm infants is required.",M2

METHODS: A cross sectional survey was conducted among 513 mothers of children aged 6- 24 months, attending infant welfare clinics. Data collection was by a structured questionnaire, which was supplemented by focus group discussions to further explore some of the issues covered in the survey. RESULTS: Breast-feeding rate was 99.4%, the duration of which ranged from 1-22 months with a median of 14 months among those who had stopped breastfeeding. Only 145 (28.3%) mothers breastfed their babies exclusively for six months and 259(50.8%) initiated breastfeeding within one hour of birth; both were associated with at least secondary level of education. The main obstacle to exclusive breastfeeding was the belief that water is required to quench thirst in babies. Expression of breast milk was not favoured by majority of the mothers (68%) most of whom felt that the milk would get contaminated. Wet <e>nursing</e> was rarely practiced (0.4%).

We also searched the reference lists of all included papers and relevant reviews, and contacted study authors and researchers in the field for additional papers. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomised controlled trials of any intervention delivered by LHWs (paid or voluntary) in primary or community health care and intended to improve maternal or child health or the management of infectious diseases. A 'lay health worker' was defined as any health worker carrying out functions related to healthcare delivery, trained in some way in the context of the intervention, and having no formal professional or paraprofessional certificate or tertiary education degree. There were no restrictions on care recipients. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently extracted data using a standard form and assessed risk of bias. Studies that compared broadly similar types of interventions were grouped together. Where feasible, the study results were combined and an overall estimate of effect obtained. MAIN RESULTS: Eighty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. These showed considerable diversity in the targeted health issue and the aims, content, and outcomes of interventions. The majority were conducted in high income countries (n = 55) but many of these focused on low income and minority populations. The diversity of included studies limited meta-analysis to outcomes for four study groups. These analyses found evidence of moderate quality of the effectiveness of LHWs in promoting immunisation childhood uptake (RR 1.22, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.37; P = 0.0004); promoting initiation of breastfeeding (RR = 1.36, 95% CI 1.14 to 1.61; P &lt; 0.00001), any breastfeeding (RR 1.24, 95% CI 1.10 to 1.39; P = 0.0004), and exclusive breastfeeding (RR 2.78, 95% CI 1.74 to 4.44; P &lt;0.0001); and improving pulmonary TB cure rates (RR 1.22 (95% CI 1.13 to 1.31) P &lt;0.0001), when compared to usual care. There was moderate quality evidence that LHW support had little or no effect on TB preventive treatment completion (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.92 to 1.09; P = 0.99). There was also low quality evidence that LHWs may reduce child morbidity (RR 0.86, 95% CI 0.75 to 0.99; P = 0.03) and child (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55 to 1.03; P = 0.07) and neonatal (RR 0.76, 95% CI 0.57 to 1.02; P = 0.07) mortality, and increase the likelihood of seeking care for childhood illness (RR 1.33, 95% CI 0.86 to 2.05; P = 0.20). For other health issues, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusions regarding effectiveness, or to enable the identification of specific LHW training or intervention strategies likely to be most effective. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: LHWs provide promising benefits in promoting immunisation uptake and breastfeeding, improving TB treatment outcomes, and reducing child morbidity and mortality when compared to usual care.

20150780,"Influence of test weighing before/after <e>nursing</e> on breastfeeding in preterm infants.PURPOSE: Swedish hospitals apply various regimens for preterm infants' nutrition in connection with their mothers' establishment of breastfeeding. Milk intake is assessed either by test weighing before and after breastfeeding or by observing the infant's suckling behavior (ie, clinical indices). These differing policies may lead to differences in infants' feeding progress. The purpose of this study was to compare effects on breastfeeding and weight gain of preterm infants, depending on whether the volume of breast milk intake when suckled in the hospital was estimated by  clinical indices  or determined by test weighing. SUBJECTS: Sixty-four infants treated at a unit applying test weighing were compared with 59 infants treated at a unit assessing milk intake by  clinical indices.  DESIGN AND METHODS: A retrospective, descriptive, and comparative design was used to explore the consequences of different nutrition regimens. Data were obtained from a review of hospital medical records. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: The infants treated at the hospital where test weighing was practiced attained exclusive breastfeeding at an earlier postmenstrual age (PMA) and were also discharged at an earlier PMA. However, the 2 study units were alike regarding the proportion of infants attaining exclusive breastfeeding, the postnatal age when this occurred, and the weight pattern in hospital. CONCLUSION: To establish breastfeeding in preterm infants, test weighing before and after breastfeeding and gradual reduction of supplementation are both applicable regimens. Mothers can be encouraged to choose either of them, although test weighing may help infants attain exclusive breastfeeding at an earlier PMA.",M2
20105284,"Factors associated with breastfeeding cessation in <e>nursing</e> mothers in a peer support programme in Eastern Lancashire.BACKGROUND: The UK has one of the lowest breastfeeding rates worldwide and in recent years the Government has made breastfeeding promotion one of its priorities. The UNICEF UK Baby Friendly Initiative is likely to increase breastfeeding initiation but not duration. Other strategies which involve provision of support for breastfeeding mothers in the early weeks after birth are therefore required to encourage UK mothers to breastfeed for the recommended duration. This paper examines the effects of maternal socio-demographic factors, maternal obstetric factors, and in-hospital infant feeding practices on breastfeeding cessation in a peer support setting. METHODS: Data on mothers from Blackburn with Darwen (BwD) and Hyndburn in Eastern Lancashire who gave birth at the Royal Blackburn Hospital and initiated breastfeeding while in hospital were linked to the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD). The data were analysed to describe infant feeding methods up to 6 months and the association between breastfeeding cessation, and maternal factors and in-hospital infant feeding practices. RESULTS: The mean breastfeeding duration was 21.6 weeks (95% CI 20.86 to 22.37 weeks) and the median duration was 27 weeks (95% CI 25.6 to 28.30 weeks). White mothers were 69% more likely to stop breastfeeding compared with non-White mothers (HR: 0.59; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.67 [White mothers were the reference group]). Breastfeeding cessation was also independently associated with parity and infant feeding practices in hospital. There were no significant associations between breastfeeding cessation and marital status, mode of delivery, timing of breastfeeding initiation and socio-economic deprivation. CONCLUSION: In this study ethnicity, parity and in-hospital infant feeding practices remained independent predictors of breastfeeding cessation in this peer support setting. However other recognised predictors such as marital status, mode of delivery, timing of breastfeeding initiation and socio-economic deprivation were not found to be associated with breastfeeding cessation.",M2
20005912,"Salt preference of <e>nursing</e> mothers is associated with earlier cessation of exclusive breastfeeding.Successful breastfeeding is predicated on its initial success. Salt appetite during lactation may be relevant to breastfeeding success because sodium is essential for development of foetus and neonate. Here we examined whether maternal salt preference might facilitate breastfeeding. Nursing mothers (n=327) were categorized as high, medium or low salt preferring, and the relationship to persistence of exclusive breastfeeding during the first 25 days postnatal was evaluated. Contrary to expectation, we find that mothers with low salt preference persisted in breastfeeding beyond day 7 postnatal in comparison to mothers with high salt preference, and mothers with high salt preference had the shortest exclusive breastfeeding duration up to postnatal day 25. Awareness of this among health workers and nursing mothers could contribute to successful breastfeeding.",M2

STUDY SELECTION: Studies were included if they were conducted in a developed country, published between the years 2004 and 2008, included a concurrent control group, and reported frequency data on breastfeeding initiation or duration. The suitability of design and quality of execution were evaluated using the Centers for Disease Control procedure for systematic reviews. Twenty-one articles met the criteria for inclusion. Data Extraction: Study design, demographics, intervention/control conditions, settings, sampling strategies, potential threats to validity, and breastfeeding outcomes were abstracted and entered into a database for analysis and synthesis. DATA SYNTHESIS: Odds ratios were calculated for each individual study, and studies were stratified into 2 groups by intervention delivery type. The pooled results indicated that studies using e-based interventions had a moderate effect on breastfeeding (odds ratio=2.2 [1.9-2.7], d=0.5); whereas provider-based interventions had very little to no effect (odds ratio=1.1 [1.0-1.2], d=0.03).

FINDINGS: There were three main findings: (1) organizational and human resources were developed to create a web of support to promote breastfeeding in the NICU; (2) variations in breastfeeding knowledge and experience within the <e>nursing</e> staff, marketing practices of formula companies, and insufficient support from other health professionals served as sources of inconsistent breastfeeding messages; and (3) promotion of breastfeeding in this NICU is evolving over time from a current breast milk feeding focus to the goal for a future breastfeeding process orientation. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: NICU nurses should advocate for organizational and human resources to promote breastfeeding in the unit. To decrease inconsistent messages, staff development should be expanded to all professionals, and formula marketing practices should be curtailed.",M2

19737319,"Tales of resistance and other emancipatory functions of storytelling.TITLE: Tales of resistance and other emancipatory functions of storytelling. AIM: This paper is the report of a study to explore how the process of storytelling might facilitate women's emancipatory knowing, using examples from women's breastfeeding stories. BACKGROUND: Storytelling, as an interactive process, can give women a way to explain pivotal life events, justify choices, examine reality and find meaning in experiences. Emancipatory functions of storytelling have been identified as contextual grounding, bonding with others, validating and affirming experiences, venting and catharsis, resisting oppression and educating others. METHOD: Secondary data analysis was conducted in 2008 on breastfeeding stories originally gathered from 13 women from 2002 to 2004 for a feminist hermeneutic study of maternal breastfeeding confidence. The stories were re-examined through the lens of the emancipatory functions of storytelling. Illustrations of contextual grounding, validating and affirming experiences, venting and catharsis and acts of resistance were found in the breastfeeding stories and presented as exemplars of emancipatory knowing. FINDINGS: Women revealed the difficulties they encountered breastfeeding, transforming these experiences as they discovered their meaning. They described collisions that occurred when personal, familial, healthcare professionals' or cultural expectations differed from their experience. The stories suggested possible liberation from old ideologies about breastfeeding as women redefined the difficulties they encountered. CONCLUSION: Storytelling has potential as a simple, yet profound, and powerful emancipatory intervention which nurses can use to help women in their care make sense of and transform experiences of health and illness. Storytelling may have global implications for <e>nursing</e> practice and research.",M2
19728934,"Breastfeeding promotion for infants in neonatal units: a systematic review and economic analysis.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of interventions that promote or inhibit breastfeeding or feeding with breastmilk for infants admitted to neonatal units, and to identify an agenda for future research. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases were searched (including MEDLINE and MEDLINE In-Process Citations, EMBASE, CINAHL, Maternity and Infant Care, PsycINFO, British <e>Nursing</e> Index and Archive, Health Management Information Consortium, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Science Citation Index, Pascal, Latin American and Caribbean Health Sciences, MetaRegister of Controlled Trials, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness, Health Technology Assessment Database, National Research Register) from inception to February 2008. Advisors identified further published or unpublished material. REVIEW METHODS: All papers fulfilled eligibility criteria covering participants, interventions, study design and outcomes. Results from primary studies were assessed and summarised in a qualitative synthesis for each type of intervention and across types of intervention. To estimate long-term cost utility, a decision tree was developed to synthesise data on enhanced staff contact, breastmilk effectiveness, incidence of necrotising enterocolitis (NEC) and sepsis, resource use, survival and utilities. RESULTS: Forty-eight studies met the selection criteria for the effectiveness review, of which 65% (31/48) were RCTs, and 17% (8/48) were conducted in the UK. Seven were rated as good quality and 28 as moderate quality. No studies met the selection criteria for the health economics review. There is strong evidence that short periods of kangaroo skin-to-skin contact increased the duration of any breastfeeding for 1 month after discharge [risk ratio (RR) 4.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.19 to 19.10] and for more than 6 weeks (RR 1.95, 95% CI 1.03 to 3.70) among clinically stable infants in industrialised settings. There is strong evidence for the effectiveness of peer support at home (in Manila) for mothers of term, low birthweight infants on any breastfeeding up to 24 weeks (RR 2.18, 95% CI 1.45 to 3.29) and exclusive breastfeeding from birth to 6 months (RR 65.94, 95% CI 4.12 to 1055.70), and for the effectiveness of peer support in hospital and at home for mothers of infants in Special Care Baby Units on providing any breastmilk at 12 weeks [odds ratio (OR) 2.81, 95% CI 1.11 to 7.14; p = 0.01]. There is more limited evidence for the effectiveness of skilled professional support in a US Neonatal Intensive Care Unit on infants receiving any breastmilk at discharge (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.2, p = 0.004). Multidisciplinary staff training may increase knowledge and can increase initiation rates and duration of breastfeeding, although evidence is limited. Lack of staff training is an important barrier to implementation of effective interventions. Baby Friendly accreditation of the associated maternity hospital results in improvements in several breastfeeding-related outcomes for infants in neonatal units. Limited evidence suggests that cup feeding (versus bottle feeding) may increase breastfeeding at discharge and reduce the frequency of oxygen desaturation. Breastmilk expression using simultaneous pumping with an electric pump has advantages in the first 2 weeks. Pharmaceutical galactagogues have little benefit among mothers who have recently given birth. Our economic analysis found that additional skilled professional support in hospital was more effective and less costly (due to reduced neonatal illness) than normal staff contact. Additional support ranged from 0.009 quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) to 0.251 QALYs more beneficial per infant and ranged from 66 pounds to 586 pounds cheaper per infant across the birthweight subpopulations. Donor milk would become cost-effective given improved mechanisms for its provision. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the limitations of the evidence base, kangaroo skin-to-skin contact, peer support, simultaneous breastmilk pumping, multidisciplinary staff training and the Baby Friendly accreditation of the associated maternity hospital have been shown to be effective, and skilled support from trained staff in hospital has been shown to be potentially cost-effective. All these point to future research priorities. Many of these interventions inter-relate: it is unlikely that specific clinical interventions will be effective if used alone. There is a need for national surveillance of feeding, health and cost outcomes for infants and mothers in neonatal units; to assist this goal, we propose consensus definitions of the initiation and duration of breastfeeding/breastmilk feeding with specific reference to infants admitted to neonatal units and their mothers.",M2
19698015,"Excretion of antimicrobials used to treat methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus infections during lactation: safety in breastfeeding infants.Community-acquired strains of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have become a common cause of skin and soft tissue infections in the United States. These infections sometimes require treatment with antibiotics, and with the increasing resistance of pathogens to these agents, choosing the appropriate drug can be difficult. In lactating women who develop these infections, selecting an antibiotic is even more challenging, as clinicians need to be aware of risks to the infant from the drug excreted during lactation. To our knowledge, no review has addressed the safety of antibiotics in breastfeeding infants when the drugs are used to treat maternal skin and soft tissue infections from MRSA. Thus, we performed a literature search of the PubMed-MEDLINE and EMBASE databases (1974-March 2009), reviewed reference citations from identified publications, researched antibiotic prescribing information, and corresponded with drug manufacturers. Case reports, case series, and both in vivo and in vitro clinical trials were evaluated for the following antibiotics: clindamycin, daptomycin, linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, rifampin, tetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline, tigecycline, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin. Information for the newer antibiotics (linezolid, quinupristin-dalfopristin, tigecycline, and daptomycin) was limited. Despite heterogeneity in the data for the older antibiotics (clindamycin, rifampin, tetracyclines, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, and vancomycin), all appear to be relatively safe in the minimal quantities <e>nursing</e> infants ingest through breast milk. Although the risk to infants seems to be relatively low for most of the agents we explored, the paucity of data indicates a need for close monitoring of breastfed infants whose mothers are receiving an antibiotic for an MRSA skin and soft tissue infection.",M2

To build competence and confidence in each of these skill areas, an innovative clinical experience for senior students enrolled in women's health nursing was developed to provide nursing care and independent discharge teaching for postpartum mothers. Faculty facilitated this clinical experience by designing a simulation laboratory for students to practice their maternal self-care teaching and infant care skills prior to beginning their clinical rotation. In the hospital, students spent a day independently prioritizing new mothers' need for education and teaching new mothers to care for themselves and their newborns. Students reported confidence in teaching maternal self-care and newborn care, and satisfaction with this unique clinical experience. This approach may assist students in transferring skills learned in simulation laboratories to clinical practice.",M2

19632502,"Breastfeeding experiences of urban adolescent mothers.This qualitative descriptive study examined the breastfeeding experiences of urban adolescent mothers using a combination of focus groups and semi-structured interviews. Analysis of verbatim interview text, field, and debriefing notes was undertaken to discover categories, themes and an emerging conceptual framework. Twenty-three teens, between the ages of 14 and 18, enrolled from two postpartum clinics described the process of teens' breastfeeding decision-making, initiation, continuation, and termination of breastfeeding. Roughly half of the teens were currently breastfeeding and the other half had weaned their infant within the last six months. Adolescent mothers chose breastfeeding mainly for infant health reasons, closeness and bonding. Positive and negative events; barriers and facilitators to continued breastfeeding; and types of support received during breastfeeding illuminated the experience starting in the hospital and extending over time. Among those who weaned, a combination of primary and secondary obstacles or problems, such as perceptions of insufficient milk supply, nipple/breast pain, time demands of school or work, problems with pumping, and feeling overwhelmed and frustrated led to weaning. Many who weaned did not seek out available help and ultimately many reported regret about weaning earlier than intended. Those who continued breastfeeding beyond six weeks reported significant emotional, informational and instrumental support from family, friends, school, and their babies. Implications for <e>nursing</e> practice and research are discussed.",M2
19617811,"Breast milk jaundice correlates with high levels of epidermal growth factor.Maternal milk plays an important role in breast milk jaundice (BMJ) development and is the major source of epidermal growth factor (EGF) for neonates. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a relationship between EGF levels in the infant serum and in the milk of <e>nursing</e> mothers and BMJ. Two groups were defined: study group (n = 30), newborns who were followed up for BMJ without any identifiable pathologic cause; control group, healthy newborns whose serum total bilirubin levels were &lt;10 mg/dL. Milk and infant plasma samples were collected between the third and the fourth postpartum week. EGF concentrations in all of the samples were determined by using ELISA. The infants with BMJ had higher concentrations of EGF in the serum and in the breast milk compared with that of the infants without BMJ. The milk concentrations of EGF were significantly correlated with neonatal bilirubin and blood EGF concentrations. The degree of BMJ was associated with the increased levels of milk borne EGF. Although the exact mechanisms of the hyperbilirubinemic action of EGF are not completely known, the inhibition of gastric motility, increased absorption, and activation of bilirubin transport have been suggested as possible mechanisms.",M2
19607765,"Venlafaxine in human breast milk and <e>nursing</e> infant plasma: determination of exposure.OBJECTIVE: Venlafaxine use during pregnancy has increased over the past decade in concert with accumulating reproductive safety data; however, systematic data on venlafaxine during lactation remain sparse. The current study characterizes the level and determinants of venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine concentrations in breast milk and in nursing infant plasma. METHOD: Women participating in a prospective investigation of perinatal pharmacokinetics from January 2001 through July 2006 who were treated with venlafaxine and who chose to continue venlafaxine during lactation were included in the analysis. Breast milk samples were collected via breast pump from foremilk to hindmilk from a single breast to determine the excretion gradient, and serial samples were collected over 24 hours to determine the time course of excretion. Paired maternal/infant plasma samples were also collected. Venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Statistical analyses of breast milk and infant plasma concentrations and their determinants were conducted. RESULTS: Thirteen women and their nursing infants participated, providing 106 breast milk samples. The mean milk/plasma ratio was 275.3% (95% CI = 144.8% to 405.7%). There were statistically significant time courses of excretion for venlafaxine (R = 0.36, F = 6.82, P &lt; .02), desvenlafaxine (R = 0.48, F = 4.41, P &lt; .009), and combined venlafaxine/desvenlafaxine (R = 0.51, F = 5.16, P &lt; .004), with the highest venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine concentrations in the breast milk occurring 8 hours after maternal ingestion. Infant plasma concentrations for combined venlafaxine/desvenlafaxine were 37.1% of maternal plasma concentrations. The theoretical infant venlafaxine/desvenlafaxine dose was 0.208 mg/kg/d, and the relative infant venlafaxine/desvenlafaxine dose was 8.1%. The theoretical and relative infant doses for desvenlafaxine were 197% and 224% higher, respectively, than those for venlafaxine. No adverse events were observed or reported in the nursing infants. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous investigations of medications in breast milk, the venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine milk/plasma ratios were highly variable. The rate of venlafaxine/desvenlafaxine excretion into human breast milk is relatively higher than that observed for other antidepressants, largely due to higher desvenlafaxine excretion. These data expand the extant literature on venlafaxine and desvenlafaxine in lactation.",M2

19587568,"Formative infant feeding experiences and education of NICU nurses.PURPOSE: To explore the formative infant feeding experiences and education of NICU nurses. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: An ethnography was undertaken over 14 months in a level IV NICU in a free standing pediatric hospital in the Northeastern U.S. Purposeful sampling was used to select informants. General informants included 114 NICU nurses who were observed and informally interviewed an average of 3.5 times. Eighteen of these served as key informants and each was formally interviewed once with an additional average of 12 observations/informal interviews. Descriptions of feeding experiences and education were coded and analyzed for recurring patterns using NUD*IST software. FINDINGS: The NICU nurses identified a norm for formula feeding during their formative experiences as children. The nurses described increased exposure to varied feeding methods during their adulthood, but breastfeeding was often associated with difficulties among their families and friends. The nurses in this study recounted minimal exposure to breastfeeding in <e>nursing</e> school. The nurses' personal experiences with breastfeeding were laden with strong emotional reactions intertwined with their feelings about motherhood. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Nurses' past experiences and education must be addressed if efforts are to be made to promote breastfeeding in the NICU. Breastfeeding education programs for nurses should include reflective components to help nurses identify structural barriers and reframe any negative personal experiences.",M2
19532039,"Managing antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy and lactation.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review discusses data on the pharmacokinetics of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) in pregnancy and lactation, and the clinical consequences thereof, thus providing a basis for a rational management of AEDs during pregnancy and lactation. RECENT FINDINGS: Studies have confirmed that the elimination of lamotrigine and the active metabolite of oxcarbazepine is enhanced during pregnancy. It has been established that the increased clearance of lamotrigine is caused by induction of glucuronidation. Also, the plasma concentrations of levetiracetam decline in pregnancy but the mechanism for this effect is yet to be explored. Lamotrigine is eliminated slowly in breast-fed infants, but although lamotrigine concentrations in the infant can reach pharmacological levels, no studies have reported clinically relevant adverse effects caused by lactation. SUMMARY: Knowledge of the pharmacokinetics of AEDs in pregnancy and during lactation is important to enable optimal treatment. Gestation induced alterations in pharmacokinetics vary with the AED but also between patients and are difficult to predict. Therapeutic drug monitoring is, therefore, advisable during pregnancy and the use of the individual patient's optimal prepregnancy drug level is recommended as reference. Breastfeeding is in general safe but needs appropriate observation of the <e>nursing</e> infant.",M2
19378274,"Breastfeeding structure as a test of parental investment theory in Papua New Guinea.Evolutionary parental investment theory predicts that parents invest preferentially in offspring best able to translate investments into fitness payoffs. It has also been proposed that where the reproductive prospects of offspring are directly correlated with parental investment and variance in fertility is higher for males than females, parents in better condition should bias investment toward males while those in poorer condition should bias investment toward females. Lactation is arguably among the costliest forms of investment expended by mothers and is thus expected to be allocated in ways consistent with fitness payoffs. Quantitative data collected among 110 Papua New Guinean mother-infant pairs during 470 h of focal follows on <e>nursing</e> frequency and duration and responses to infant demands by maternal and offspring characteristics are presented to provide empirically-based descriptions of infant care and tests of evolutionary parental investment theory. Results indicate that mothers show very high levels of investment in offspring. However, although breastfeeding in developing countries is often characterized as on-demand, fussing and crying by infants were only attended to with breastfeeding about 30% of the time. Contrary to expectations of parental investment theory that parents should invest less in poorer quality offspring, mothers increased investment in offspring in poorer condition. The expectation that mothers in better condition would bias investment toward male offspring was also not supported; better nourished mothers biased investment toward female offspring. This study illustrates how infant feeding data may be used for testing larger evolutionary questions such as those derived from parental investment theory.",M2
19365795,"Maternal care affects the development of maternal behavior in inbred mice.The present study investigated the effects of variations in maternal behavior on the development of maternal behavior of female offspring in BALB/c and CBA/Ca inbred mice. In Experiment 1, we conducted fostering within or between the two strains and observed the maternal behaviors of mothers and female offspring for 2 weeks postpartum. Although fostering changed the maternal behavior of mothers in both strains, CBA mothers generally showed greater frequency of <e>nursing</e> posture and pup licking than BALB mothers. BALB female offspring reared by CBA mothers showed more body licking than those reared by BALB mothers, whereas fostering did not affect the maternal behavior of CBA female offspring. In Experiment 2, we examined the maternal behavior of females of F1 hybrids derived from reciprocal crosses between the two strains to confirm the maternal effect demonstrated in Experiment 1. Female F1 hybrids from CBA mothers showed more arched-back nursing, body licking, and nest building than those from BALB mothers. These results suggested that maternal care affect the development of maternal behavior in inbred mice, though the contributions of genetic and prenatal factors cannot be ignored.",M2
19354093,"Breastfeeding in the navy: estimates of rate, duration, and perceived support.In May 2005, the Navy's Bureau of Medicine and Surgery (BUMED) issued an instruction (BUMEDINST 6000.14) on support of servicewomen with <e>nursing</e> infants, indicating that the length of time that Navy women breastfeed is below national targets. To provide additional information on breastfeeding while serving in the Navy, a limited number of questions were added to the 2005 Navy Pregnancy and Parenthood Survey asking about rates, duration, and workplace support of breastfeeding. Results of this descriptive, exploratory, cross-sectional study show that most officers and two-thirds of enlisted women breastfeed, but about one-third have stopped by the time they return to duty. Almost half of enlisted and over one-third of officers indicate they were not given a comfortable, secluded location for breastfeeding or pumping, although the majority are given time to do so. Also, two-thirds of enlisted and half of officer women indicate they stopped breastfeeding because of a work-related reason.",M2
19341740,"Maternal postpartum learned helplessness (LH) affects maternal care by dams and responses to the LH test in adolescent offspring.It is known that the early environment affects the mental development of rodent and human offspring. However, it is not known specifically whether a postpartum depressive state influences the depressive state in offspring. Using learned helplessness (LH) in rats as an animal model of depression, we examined the influence of maternal postpartum LH on responses to the LH test of offspring. Dam rats were judged as LH or non-helpless (nLH) on postnatal days (PN) 2-3, and maternal behavior was recorded during PN2-14. On PN 45-46, offspring were subjected to the LH test. Plasma corticosterone (CORT) levels, hippocampal levels of glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) mRNA were measured before and after the LH test in offspring. Active <e>nursing</e> in LH dams was significantly lower than that in nLH dams. Susceptibility to LH in the offspring of LH dams was significantly higher than in those of nLH dams, and was negatively correlated with active nursing by LH dams. The GR mRNA levels before and after the LH test were lower in the offspring of LH dams than in those of nLH dams, and the reduced basal GR mRNA and protein might have resulted in the higher CORT response after the LH test. There was no significant difference in BDNF mRNA in the offspring of LH and nLH dams. These findings suggest that early postpartum LH decreased active nursing and increased depression-like behavior in the adolescent offspring via dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis.",M2
19336362,"The relationship between infant-feeding outcomes and postpartum depression: a qualitative systematic review.CONTEXT: The negative health consequences of postpartum depression are well documented, as are the benefits of breastfeeding. Despite the detailed research related to these maternal and infant health outcomes, the relationship between maternal mood and breastfeeding remains equivocal. OBJECTIVE: A qualitative systematic review was conducted to examine the relationship between postpartum depressive symptomatology and infant-feeding outcomes. METHODS: We performed electronic searchers in Medline (1966-2007), the Cumulative Index to <e>Nursing</e> and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL) (1982-2007), and Embase (1980-2007) by using specific key words. A hand search of selected specialist journals and reference lists of articles obtained was then conducted. Seventy-five articles were reviewed, of which 49 specifically provided data to be extracted related to postpartum depressive symptomatology and infant-feeding outcomes. Both authors independently extracted data including study design, participants (number and characteristics), and results. RESULTS: The results from this review suggest that women with depressive symptomatology in the early postpartum period may be at increased risk for negative infant-feeding outcomes including decreased breastfeeding duration, increased breastfeeding difficulties, and decreased levels of breastfeeding self-efficacy. There is also beginning evidence to suggest that depressed women may be less likely to initiate breastfeeding and do so exclusively. CONCLUSIONS: Depressive symptomatology in the postpartum period negatively influences infant-feeding outcomes. These findings have important clinical implications and support the need for early identification and treatment of women with depressive symptomatology. However, strategies to address help-seeking barriers are needed if women are to receive appropriate and timely treatment. Research to determine effective interventions to support depressed breastfeeding women is warranted.",M2
19334008,"Prolonged exclusive breastfeeding reduces autoimmune diabetes incidence and increases regulatory T-cell frequency in bio-breeding diabetes-prone rats.BACKGROUND: Previously, we reported that exclusive breastfeeding delayed and partially protected bio-breeding diabetes-prone (BBDP) rats from spontaneous autoimmune diabetes development. To investigate whether this protection results from modulation of the (mucosal) immune system, the present study was designed to analyse the effect of nutrition early in life on the immune status of BBDP rats. METHODS: The breastfeeding period of BBDP pups was extended or not, while allowing half of the pups to eat during that period whereas the other half received only breast milk. Cytokine profiles as well as naturally occurring regulatory T-cell frequencies were measured over time in the mesenteric lymph nodes (MLNs) and spleen. RESULTS: Prolonged exclusive breastfeeding partially protects against autoimmune diabetes development and resulted in elevated levels of natural regulatory T cells (CD4(+) CD25(+) FoxP3(+)) in MLNs and spleen directly after weaning and throughout life. Stimulation of MLN cells from rats that ingested solid food during the <e>nursing</e> period showed massive secretion of interferon gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-4 and IL-10, whereas MLN cells from exclusive breastfed rats did not. In contrast, transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ss) was secreted equally by all groups. CONCLUSIONS: Prolonged exclusive breastfeeding partially protects BBDP rats from autoimmune diabetes development. Interestingly, ingestion of solid food during the weaning period completely abolishes this protective effect. The protective effect of exclusive breastfeeding correlates with higher levels of naturally occurring regulatory T cells throughout life and low cytokine secretion at weaning.",M2
19298003,"Interactions between metabolic and reproductive functions in the resumption of postpartum fecundity.Lactation has long been recognized as a major determinant of interbirth intervals. The temporal pattern of <e>nursing</e> has been proposed as the mechanism behind lactational amenorrhea. We present a new model of the dynamic regulation of lactational amenorrhea that identifies maternal energy availability as the main determinant of ovarian resumption. Variation in the intensity of lactation remains a component of the model as a determinant of the absolute energetic cost of milk production. However, maternal energy supply determines net energy availability; a larger energy supply leaves a greater net energy surplus than a smaller energy supply (lactation costs being equal). We characterize the hormonal postpartum profile of 70 lactating Toba women of Argentina. We use C-peptide, which reflects maternal insulin production, as a measure of energy availability. Initially low, insulin production rises as the postpartum period progresses, reflecting the declining metabolic load of lactation. A short period of supernormal insulin production precedes menstrual resumption. The high levels of insulin may play a role in stimulating the resumption of ovarian activity, which in turn may help to resolve the transient period of insulin resistance. The dynamics of insulin sensitivity during lactation would aid in synchronizing the resumption of ovarian function with a reduction in the energy demands of milk production. This hypothesis is supported by the sustained weight gain experienced by lactating women during the months preceding the first postpartum menses. The link between fecundity and energy balance could serve as a mechanism for adjusting the duration of lactational amenorrhea to the relative metabolic load of lactation.",M2
19280240,"Trans fatty acids and fatty acid composition of mature breast milk in turkish women and their association with maternal diet's.The aim of this study was to determine the fatty acid composition and trans fatty acid and fatty acid contents of breast milk in Turkish women and to find the effect of breastfeeding mothers' diet on trans fatty acid and fatty acid composition. Mature milk samples obtained from 50 Turkish <e>nursing</e> women were analyzed. Total milk lipids extracts were transmethylated and analyzed by using gas liquid chromatography to determine fatty acids contents. A questionnaire was applied to observe eating habits and 3 days dietary records from mothers were obtained. Daily dietary intake of total energy and nutrients were estimated by using nutrient database. The mean total trans fatty acids contents was 2.13 +/- 1.03%. The major sources of trans fatty acids in mothers' diets were margarines-butter (37.0%), bakery products and confectionery (29.6%). Mothers who had high level of trans isomers in their milk consumed significantly higher amounts of these products. Saturated fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids and monounsaturated fatty acids of human milk constituted 40.7 +/- 4.7%, 26.9 +/- 4.2% and 30.8 +/- 0.6% of the total fatty acids, respectively. The levels of fatty acids in human milk may reflect the current diet of the mother as well as the diet consumed early in pregnancy. Margarines, bakery products and confectionery are a major source of trans fatty acids in maternal diet in Turkey.",M2
19262945,"Self-medication in <e>nursing</e> mothers and its influence on the duration of breastfeeding.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the practice of self-medication by nursing mothers, the main drugs used and the influence on the duration of breastfeeding. METHODS: A longitudinal cohort study involving 246 women seen at the maternity unit of Hospital Manoel Gonçalves in Itaúna, state of Minas Gerais, Brazil. A monthly follow-up of mothers and newborns was performed for the first 12 months postpartum or until weaning. The effect of the practice of self-medication on the duration of breastfeeding was evaluated by multivariate analysis using Cox's regression model with time-dependent variables. RESULTS: Self-medication was practiced by 52.4% of the nursing mothers. The most used pharmacological classes were: analgesics/antipyretics (54.5%), non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (15%), spasmolytics (6.2%), laxatives (3.5%), benzodiazepines (3%), nasal decongestants (1.4%), and antibiotics (0.9%). The most used drugs were dipyrone (31.5%) and paracetamol (17.9%). The practice of self-medication was associated with a higher probability of the use of drugs posing the risk of adverse effects for the infant or for lactation (p = 0.000). However, the practice of self-medication was not associated with weaning (p = 0.135). CONCLUSIONS: The high rates of self-medication among nursing mothers and the use of drugs posing risks of undesirable effects for the infant and for lactation reveal the need for better education on the risks of self-medication by nursing mothers. However, self-medication was not proven to be a risk factor for weaning.",M2

19259990,"Nipple preference and contests in suckling kittens of the domestic cat are unrelated to presumed nipple quality.We studied the development of suckling behavior and weight gain in 11 litters (52 kittens) of free-ranging domestic cats until postnatal day 28 just before the start of weaning. In six of these litters, we also recorded milk intake and contests for access to nipples. Already within 12 hr of birth kittens showed a preference for posterior nipples, and by postnatal day 3 each had developed a preference for particular nipples. In fact, 86% of kittens used one particular nipple most often, and even when the mother changed the side she lay on to nurse. Contests for access to nipples occurred throughout the study period at an average rate of one to two contests per kitten per hour of <e>nursing</e>. Contrary to suggestions in the literature that kittens compete for more productive nipples, we found no relation between kittens' use of particular nipples and their weight gain, milk intake, or involvement in contests during suckling. We suggest that kittens' preference for posterior nipples as well as their establishment of an individual  teat order  might function to optimize the number of nipples remaining productive across lactation, and to reduce energetically costly scrambles and potentially injurious contests among littermates.",M2
19249952,"Extremely low excretion of daptomycin into breast milk of a <e>nursing</e> mother with methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus pelvic inflammatory disease.Antibiotic treatment for pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) is often broad spectrum and targets a diverse range of vaginal flora. Treatment of PID in nursing mothers presents a particular clinical challenge because use of antimicrobials during breastfeeding poses several potential risks to infants. Excretion of drugs into breast milk can occur through different mechanisms and depends on the characteristics of both the drug and the mother. Whether daptomycin is excreted into breast milk is unknown, as is its subsequent exposure to breastfeeding infants and the associated risks. We describe a case of PID caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, an uncommon pathogen in PID, in a breastfeeding mother who was successfully treated with daptomycin. Daptomycin concentrations in her breast milk were measured to determine potential exposure to her infant. These concentrations were extremely low, with an estimated milk:plasma ratio of 0.0012. Although additional confirmatory studies are needed, daptomycin may be a reasonable option in the treatment of PID caused by gram-positive organisms that are resistant to other antibiotics.",M2

19196037,"A barrier to exclusive breastfeeding for WIC enrollees: limited use of exclusive breastfeeding food package for mothers.BACKGROUND: In the first 2 weeks of life, most breastfeeding mother-infant dyads in the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) receive infant formula from WIC, instead of a larger food package designed for exclusively breastfeeding mothers. This study was designed to explore reasons for high rates of formula supplementation of breastfeeding newborns enrolled in WIC and the limited use of the WIC expanded food package. METHODS: We conducted in-depth interviews with 29 mothers who either partially or exclusively breastfed for at least 2 months. Interviews were transcribed verbatim, analyzed, coded, and organized into 10 themes. RESULTS: Participants view the WIC program in a contradictory manner. They see it as highly supportive of breastfeeding, but also as a promoter of infant formula. The expanded food package for mothers is not valued, but free supplemental formula is highly valued. Misinformation about breastfeeding pervades the healthcare system, and exclusive breastfeeding is not promoted as an important health goal. Lack of access to breast pumps, the unacceptability of pumping in the workplace, and difficulties with <e>nursing</e> in public all contribute to formula supplementation. CONCLUSIONS: The healthcare system, the WIC program, and demands of daily life all contribute to low rates of exclusive breastfeeding in the WIC program. The available expanded food package for mothers who are exclusively breastfeeding is both disliked and underutilized, while free supplemental formula is rarely discouraged.",M2

19147256,"Risk factors for colonisation of newborn infants during an outbreak of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae in an intermediate-risk neonatal unit.We describe a cross-sectional survey to identify risk factors for colonisation of neonates by extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. This occurred following exposure to a colonised healthcare worker during an outbreak in an intermediate-risk neonatal unit. In total, 120 neonates admitted consecutively during a three-month period were screened for ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae by rectal swabbing and 27 were identified as colonised. Multivariate analysis showed colonisation to be independently associated with use of antibiotics and absence of breastfeeding. Previous use of antibiotics presented an odds ratio (OR) of 12.3 [95% confidence interval (CI): 3.66-41.2, P&lt;0.001]. The most commonly used antibiotics were penicillin and amikacin. Breastfeeding was associated with reduced risk for colonisation (OR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.05-0.99; P=0.049). Nine isolates recovered during the first stage of the outbreak and 27 isolates from surveillance cultures were typed thereafter by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, revealing six different profiles (A-F). Clones A, C, and E were implicated in the first stage of the outbreak, whereas among the 27 strains recovered from surveillance cultures, all six clones were identified. Clone A was also found on the hand of a <e>nursing</e> auxiliary with onychomycosis. We concluded that prior antimicrobial use predisposed to colonisation. The possible role of breastfeeding as a protective factor needs to be further elucidated. Detection of different genotypes of ESBL-producing K. pneumoniae suggests that dissemination of mobile genetic elements bearing the ESBL gene may have been superimposed on the simple dissemination of a clone during the outbreak.",M2
19133400,"Infant feeding and professional advice in the first half of the 20th century in Greece.This study aims to assess the role that health professional and State policies played in shaping breastfeeding practices and attitudes in Greece during the first half of the 20th century. Original texts were used; including those concerned with breastfeeding traditions, health professionals' attitudes to breastfeeding, infant feeding patterns, partial breastfeeding, artificial feeding and State policies for the promotion of breastfeeding. Content analysis was used and breastfeeding rates were considered. In the first two decades of the 20th century, most Greek women breastfed their children, as advised by other experienced women. In the succeeding decades, health professionals and policy makers wrote books and articles praising breastfeeding albeit stressing the <e>nursing</e> mothers' ignorance of sanitary measures. Many health professionals were influenced by trends in developed countries and advocated novel infant feeding practices. Consequently, full breastfeeding was not promoted.",M2

RESULTS: There were significant differences in breast feeding continuation between two groups at each time point except 2 days and 1 week after delivery. The scores of mother-infant attachment and maternal sensitivity of experimental group were higher than those of the control group, but there were no significant differences between two groups.

The Kisumu Breastfeeding Study is a phase IIb open-label trial of prenatal, intrapartum, and postpartum maternal treatment with zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine from 34 weeks of gestation to 6 months postpartum. In a pharmacokinetic substudy, maternal plasma, breast milk, and infant dried blood spots were collected for drug assay on the day of delivery and at 2, 6, 14, and 24 weeks after delivery. Sixty-seven mother-infant pairs were enrolled. The median concentrations in breast milk of zidovudine, lamivudine, and nevirapine during the study period were 14 ng/ml, 1,214 ng/ml, and 4,546 ng/ml, respectively. Zidovudine was not detectable in any infant plasma samples obtained after the day of delivery, while the median concentrations in infant plasma samples from postpartum weeks 2, 6, and 14 were 67 ng/ml, 32 ng/ml, and 24 ng/ml for lamivudine and 987 ng/ml, 1,032 ng/ml, and 734 ng/ml for nevirapine, respectively. Therefore, lamivudine and nevirapine, but not zidovudine, are transferred to infants via breast milk in biologically significant concentrations. The extent and effect of infant drug exposure via breast milk must be well understood in order to evaluate the benefits and risks of maternal antiretroviral use during lactation.",M2
19104374,"Medications in pregnancy and lactation: part 1. Teratology.One of the least-developed areas of clinical pharmacology and drug research is the use of medication during pregnancy and lactation. This article is the first in a two-part series designed to familiarize physicians with many aspects of the drugs they commonly prescribe for pregnant and breast-feeding women. Almost every pregnant woman is exposed to some type of medication during pregnancy. Although the majority of pregnant and breast-feeding women consume clinically indicated or over-the-counter drug preparation regularly, only few medications have specifically been tested for safety and efficacy during pregnancy. There is scant information on the effect of common pregnancy complications on drug clearance and efficacy. Often, the safety of a drug for mothers, their fetuses, and <e>nursing</e> infants cannot be determined until it has been widely used. Absent this crucial information, many women are either refused medically important agents or experience potentially harmful delays in receiving drug treatment. Conversely, many drugs deemed  safe  are prescribed despite evidence of possible teratogenicity. Novel research and diagnostic applications evolving from the opportunities presented by the advances in genomics and proteomics are now beginning to affect clinical diagnosis, vaccine development, drug discovery, and unique therapies in a modern diagnostic-therapeutic framework-part of the new scientific field of theranostics. This review critically explores a number of recently raised issues in regard to the use of several classes of medications during gestation and seeks to provide a general and concise resource on drugs commonly used during pregnancy and lactation. It also seeks to make clinicians more aware of the controversies surrounding some drugs in an effort to encourage safer prescribing practices through consultation with a maternal-fetal medicine specialist and through references and Web sites that list up-to-date information.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 813 children aged 2-6 years were screened for the present study from randomly selected three kindergarten schools each from Government, Government aided, and private managements. Clinical examination was done inside the respective schools. At the time of examination, a proforma was filled for each child comprising of DFS index. The questionnaire by Winter et al. was modified and used in this study. The completed proformas were statistically analyzed to find if any correlation existed between the nursing caries to the feeding practices and socioeconomic status of the family. RESULTS: Duration of breastfeeding increases the number of children with nursing caries and the mean DFS. There is a strong and significant relationship between the severity of nursing caries and the degree of feeding abuse. Children from low socioeconomic status have increased early childhood caries. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of nursing caries was 19.2% in Davangere preschool population. Nursing caries were more in children who were taking a feeding bottle to bed at night and were increasingly seen in large families and lower socioeconomic groups.",M2

We surveyed 150 low-income mothers in a Washington, DC, clinic. Sixty percent had initiated breastfeeding, and 78% of these breastfed infants received formula supplementation in the hospital. There was no clear medical need for supplementation for 87% of the breastfed infants receiving supplementation. Infants of mothers who did not attend a prenatal breastfeeding class were almost 5 times more likely to receive in-hospital formula supplementation than those infants whose mothers had attended a class (OR, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.05-21.14).

18829834,"Why mothers stop breastfeeding: mothers' self-reported reasons for stopping during the first year.OBJECTIVES: Our goal was to determine why women stop breastfeeding at various times during their infant's first year. METHODS: We analyzed self-reported data from 1323 mothers who participated in the Infant Feeding Practice Study II. Mail questionnaires were sent to mothers approximately 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, 10 1/2, and 12 months after their child's birth, in which they were asked to rate the importance of 32 reasons for their decision to stop breastfeeding. We applied exploratory factorial analysis to extract meaningful constructs of mothers' responses to the 32 reasons. We then compared the percentages of mothers who indicated that each reason was important in their decision to stop breastfeeding among various weaning ages and used multiple logistic regression models to examine sociodemographic differences in the most frequently cited reasons for stopping breastfeeding. RESULTS: The perception that their infant was not satisfied by breast milk alone was cited consistently as 1 of the top 3 reasons in the mothers' decision to stop breastfeeding regardless of weaning age (43.5%-55.6%) and was even more frequent among Hispanic mothers and mothers with annual household incomes of &lt;350% of the federal poverty level. Mothers' concerns about lactation and nutrition issues were the most frequently cited reasons for stopping breastfeeding during the first 2 months. Starting from the third month, self-weaning reasons were increasingly cited as important, with the statements  My baby began to bite  (31.7%),  My baby lost interest in <e>nursing</e> or began to wean himself or herself  (47.3%), and  Breast milk alone did not satisfy my baby  (43.5%) cited as the top 3 reasons at &gt; or = 9 months of age. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings about the major reasons why mothers stop breastfeeding at various times during their child's first year should be useful to health professionals when attempting to help mothers overcome breastfeeding barriers and to health officials attempting to devise targeted breastfeeding interventions on those issues prominent for each infant age.",M2

Women aged 16-41 years were recruited in a hospital in the city of Rio de Janeiro between January and March 2005. Data were collected through in-depth interviews using a life history approach and complemented by a semi-structured guide. ANALYSIS OF THE RESULTS: Women expressed mixed feelings of loneliness and good moments regarding maternal care and breastfeeding experience. Most had early cessation of breastfeeding and the reasons reported included: the need to resume their working activities, lack of information on breastfeeding and the violence experienced by these women.

We sought to characterize the determinants of lamotrigine concentrations in breast milk and nursing-infant plasma. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Women who enrolled in a prospective investigation of perinatal medication pharmacokinetics, were treated with lamotrigine, and chose to continue lamotrigine while breastfeeding were included in the analysis. Breast milk samples were collected via breast pump from foremilk to hindmilk from a single breast to determine the excretion gradient and serial samples over 24 hours to determine the time course of excretion. Paired maternal/infant plasma samples were also collected. Lamotrigine concentrations in all of the samples were determined by using high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet detection. Statistical analyses of breast milk and infant plasma concentrations and their determinants were conducted. RESULTS: Thirty women and their nursing infants participated in the study, providing a total of 210 breast milk samples. The mean milk/plasma ratio was 41.3%. There was a nonsignificant trend for higher lamotrigine concentrations in breast milk 4 hours after the maternal dose. Infant plasma concentrations were 18.3% of maternal plasma concentrations. The theoretical infant lamotrigine dose was 0.51 mg/kg per day, and the relative infant lamotrigine dose was 9.2%. Mild thrombocytosis was present in 7 of 8 infants at the time of serum sampling. No other adverse events were observed or reported in the breastfed infants. CONCLUSIONS: Consistent with previous investigations of medications in breast milk, the lamotrigine milk/plasma ratio is highly variable. The rate of lamotrigine excretion into human breast milk is similar to that observed with other antiepileptic drugs. These data expand the extant literature on lamotrigine in breastfeeding and demonstrate relatively comparable nursing-infant exposure to lamotrigine compared with other antiepileptic drugs.",M2

18564001,"Training for perfect breastfeeding or metoclopramide: which one can promote lactation in <e>nursing</e> mothers?BACKGROUND: One of the most common complaints of nursing mothers in a few days after delivery is insufficient lactation. This is known to be partly due to the mothers' deficient knowledge of proper breastfeeding and often results in the beginning of bottlefeeding, which finally diminishes or ceases their breastfeeding. Considering the valuable effects of breastfeeding on nutritional, immunologic, and emotional aspects of infants' health, we planned this study to find out whether training of nursing mothers for breastfeeding can enhance their lactation; also, we tried to compare the effects of metoclopramide on lactation with those of training. METHODS: Throughout 2006, we consecutively enrolled 20 primipara nursing mothers who were referred to Tabriz Children's Hospital, Tabriz, Iran for counseling about prescription of infant formula as a response to their complaint of insufficient lactation during a couple of months after parturition. Only those mothers were included in this study whose newborns had failed to gain appropriate weight, determined by their age and birth weight. First, all newborns were weighed, and all mothers passed a short training course about  perfect practice of breastfeeding ; then we randomly allocated them in two equal groups of 10 mothers-one group received a metoclopramide tablet (10 mg/dose every 8 hours), and the other just placebo, both for a period of 15 days. Thereafter we weighed the newborns again and compared the two recorded weights of each infant and the average weight of the two groups with each other to assess the sufficiency of breastfeeding and effects of training and galactogogue. RESULTS: Eighteen of the 20 newborns studied (90%) showed an appropriate weight gain: 12 newborns gained 385-415 g (mean, 400 +/- 15 g), six neonates gained 270-315 g (mean, 292.5 +/- 22.5 g), but the remaining two newborns gained 150-235 g (mean, 192.5 +/- 42.5 g). Statistical analysis revealed that training of nursing mothers for perfect breastfeeding (with or without metoclopramide consumption) has a significant improving role in infants' weight gain (p &lt; 0.001); however, there was no statistically meaningful difference between the two treatment groups (with and without administration of metoclopramide, p = 0.68). CONCLUSIONS: Counseling nursing mothers for proper lactation before delivery and their continued training thereafter are the main clinical pathways toward a successful and sustained breastfeeding.",M2
18546574,"Sharing breastmilk: wet <e>nursing</e>, cross feeding, and milk donations.Wet nursing and cross feeding both involve the breastfeeding of a child by someone other than the mother. Wet nursing involves a woman who is not the social equal of the employer, is never reciprocal, and is normally for payment. Cross feeding (also 'cross nursing') is the informal sharing of breastfeeding between equals, and is usually unpaid and may be reciprocal. Community attitudes in the late 20th and early 21st centuries are distrustful of this practice, though satisfaction is reported by the women involved in sharing breastfeeding. Community unease has included feelings of revulsion, rationalized by concern about the transmission of infections. Yet recently there have been sporadic feature articles in the print media reporting instances of, and opinions, on these practices. This review article explores the sharing of breastfeeding, principally in Australia, and provides an historical context for concerns about transmission of infection. These issues will also be discussed in relation to human milk banking.",M2

18469364,"Detection of IgE anti-parvovirus antibodies in human breast milk.Breast milk is a complex fluid, rich in nutrients and non-nutritional bioactive components, including antimicrobial factors, immunoglobulins, cytokines, and anti-inflammatory substances. Although IgE is implicated in viral immunity, its role in breast milk in parvovirus B19 immunity has not been studied. Total immunoglobulin levels of IgE, IgG, and IgE anti-parvovirus B19 antibodies were determined by ELISA and Western blot analysis in breast milk and in sera from a mother and her <e>nursing</e> infant (female, 10 mo). For specific IgE protein determination, breast milk was fractionated by chromatography on G-100 Sephadex; 3 peaks were collected and separated by SDS PAGE. The levels of total IgE in breast milk and its fractions were low (&lt;2.4 ng/ml), and those of maternal and infant serum were negligible (18 and 4.3 IU/ml, respectively). Nevertheless, the breast milk and maternal and infant sera contained IgE anti-parvovirus B19 antibodies, even though the infant was never infected with parvovirus B19. Total serum levels of maternal IgG were within the normal range and those of infant IgG were low (473 mg/dl); total IgG in breast milk was not determined. Maternal serum contained some detectable IgG anti-parvovirus antibodies that were not present in infant serum or breast milk. Total maternal and infant serum levels of IgM and IgA were within the normal ranges. The presence of IgE anti-parvovirus B19 antibodies in breast milk suggests that IgE anti-viral antibodies are transmitted in breast milk and may provide protective responses in nursing children.",M2
18460586,"High-dose carisoprodol during pregnancy and lactation.OBJECTIVE: To report a case of use of high-dose carisoprodol during pregnancy and breast-feeding. CASE SUMMARY: A 28-year-old woman with severe back muscle spasm took carisoprodol 2800 mg/day before and throughout an uncomplicated pregnancy and while exclusively breast-feeding her infant during the first month after birth. Serum drug concentrations of carisoprodol and the active metabolite meprobamate were measured in the mother and infant. Concentrations of these agents also were measured in breast milk. Developmental toxicity was not observed in the near-term infant, whose birth weight was at the 10th percentile for gestational age. Only slight sedation was noted in the infant during breast-feeding, and no signs or symptoms of withdrawal were noted when <e>nursing</e> was stopped. DISCUSSION: Carisoprodol and meprobamate are excreted into breast milk. Although the published human pregnancy data are limited to 15 cases, carisoprodol does not appear to cause developmental toxicity (growth restriction, structural anomalies, functional/neurobehavioral deficits, or death), even when the mother is taking high doses. No signs or symptoms of withdrawal were noted in our infant or in a previously published case when breast-feeding was stopped. Long-term follow-up has not been conducted in exposed infants, and the possibility of functional/neurobehavioral l deficits appearing later in life cannot be excluded. CONCLUSIONS: Except for mild sedation, no other toxicity was observed in a near-term infant exposed to carisoprodol throughout gestation and during breast-feeding in the first month after birth.",M2
18458343,"Unlocking evidence of early diet from tooth enamel.Recent developments in microspatial analysis of enamel chemistry provide the resolution needed to reconstruct detailed chronological records of an individual's early life history. Evidence of nutritional history, residential mobility, and exposure to heavy metals can potentially be retrieved from archaeological and even fossil teeth. Understanding the pattern and timing of incorporation of each trace element or stable isotope into enamel is crucial to the interpretation of the primary data. Here, we use laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry and ArcGIS software to map variation in calcium-normalized strontium intensities across thin sections of enamel from exfoliated deciduous teeth. Differences in calcium-normalized strontium intensities across each tooth reflect variation in tooth mineralization, implying that sampling location must be taken into account in interpreting results. Chronologically consistent shifts in calcium-normalized strontium intensities in teeth from children with known <e>nursing</e> histories reflect the onset and duration of breastfeeding and the introduction of nonmaternal sources of food. This tool is likely to be valuable for studying weaning and nursing behavior in the past. The distribution of normalized strontium intensities presented here is consistent with a model for the differential incorporation of strontium and calcium into enamel during the secretory and maturational phases of formation.",M2

The methods and preliminary results have already been described. The participants of the study were questioned about their breast-feeding habits in 4 follow-ups. The follow-up quota was 82%. RESULTS: The frequency of breast-feeding exclusively according to needs at 2-6 days following delivery was about 62%. At the end of the infants' second month of life only 46.7% of the infants were breast-fed at least 7 times. In the first 2 months the prevalence of breast-feeding problems in mothers who still breast-feed and those who had stopped was about the same. In mother-infant pairs who no longer breast-feed, the concerns about too little milk, sore nipples and drinking or sucking problems of the infant predominated. CONCLUSIONS: Breast-feeding problems that lead to termination of <e>nursing</e> are often due to a lack of milk or, respectively, a mother's concern about giving too little milk. Prospective, quality-assured counselling should focus on increasing the frequency of breast-feeding and on an improvement of suckling techniques in the first weeks of life. The medical necessity to supplementary feeding should be critically assessed and clearly explained to the mother in order to avoid giving her the feeling that she is unable to adequately feed her own child.",M2

The authors call the emotional reaction to virtue  moral elevation  and the authors examined its effects on mother-infant dyads. Breastfeeding women who watched a morally elevating video were more likely to nurse their infants and were marginally more likely to hug them, compared to women who watched an equally enjoyable comedy video. Both of these effects suggest that moral elevation may involve the release of oxytocin, a hormone associated with lactation and affiliation.",M2
18402407,"[Drugs and breastfeeding: some facts to consider before deciding they are incompatible]Breastfeeding is considered the ideal way of providing young infants with the required nutrients for healthy growth and development. An increase in the prevalence and duration of breastfeeding has been observed over the last years in response to promotion campaigns. When a medicamentous treatment is started, discontinuation of breastfeeding is often proposed, for fear of harmful consequences for the infant. Nevertheless such a decision is not unimportant, and it appears that many drugs can actually be used during breastfeeding without significant risk. An assessment of the real risk incurred by exposed children makes it possible to avoid unnecessary discontinuations of breastfeeding. This article aims to review the facts needed to assess amount of drug exposure to the child and to list the few drugs associated with significant effects on the <e>nursing</e> infant.",M2

This is currently not considered in chemical risk assessment. A coupled model for bioaccumulation of organic chemicals in breast-feeding mother and nursing infant was developed and tested for a series of organic compounds. The bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) in mother, breast milk and child were predicted to vary with logK(OW) and, for volatile compounds, with K(AW) and concentration in air. The concentrations of POPs in the infant body increase the first half year to about factor 3 above mother and decline thereafter to lower levels. The predicted results are close to empirical data and to an empirical regression. The new mother-child model is compact due to its easy structure and the analytical matrix solution. It could be added to existing exposure and risk assessment systems, such as EUSES.",M2

METHODS: A descriptive, qualitative and quantitative study was carried out. The data for this study was obtained from a survey made of the kindergarten children's parents during 2004 and 2005. RESULTS: 98% of the children received breast milk and 75% recognised its benefits for both mother and child. Only 21% of the children ceased to be breast fed six months after birth, this being the minimum age recommended by the WHO. 40% of the mothers keep breast feeding after 12 months. CONCLUSIONS: The elements resulting from analysing the surveys agreed with other countries' theories and experience; they also contributed to new considerations regarding the specific context of the Universidad Nacional's kindergarten.",M2

It highlights women's important role as caretakers of family health and nutrition. Briefly the authors review how women have been analysed in the different food an nutrition surveys; how gender has been effaced in the  mean per capita , and how women have been taken into account only as far as their reproductive role. This paper also outlines the importance of including the gender category and gender approach in food and nutrition studies; in order to clearly visualize the feeding inequities among men and women throughout the stages of the feeding process, i.e. decision, provision, preparation, distribution and intake. Moreover, improved understanding of women's nutrition practices and meanings that foods convey to women is advocated.

They differ in that wet nurses were usually employees in paid situations and the breastfeeding was not reciprocated, whereas cross-nursing was between peers and was usually unpaid and could be reciprocal. In Australia at the turn of the twentieth century wet nurses were employed in private homes or institutions. By the 1920s, finding a wet nurse had become extremely difficult, but informal cross-feeding existed long after this. This study examines both practices in twentieth century Australia, 1900-2000, and includes a discussion of the decline of human milk banks, another means of sharing mothers' milk.",M2
18073001,"Barriers to breastfeeding in a Vietnamese community: a qualitative exploration.PURPOSE: Vietnamese women's breastfeeding experience and challenges were explored, as were their families' needs for prenatal and postpartum health professional programs and services. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted in Middlesex-London, Ontario, using in-depth, semi-structured interviews in a heterogeneous sample of 11 Vietnamese mothers of children younger than two years. Diverse subject characteristics were sought in terms of parity, maternal age, infant age, marital status, education, employment, and breastfeeding initiation and duration. The 45- to 60-minute interviews were audiotaped and transcribed verbatim. Research team members independently reviewed interview transcripts at several stages during data collection. Qualitative analysis was sequential, and involved a combination of editing and template organizing styles. RESULTS: Lack of knowledge and misinformation were major barriers to breastfeeding. Inability to communicate in English and a lack of effective transportation were key obstacles to the women's ability to access mainstream prenatal and postpartum health programs and services. Standard <e>nursing</e> prenatal and postpartum services appear not to have reached this group of mothers effectively. CONCLUSIONS: Culturally and linguistically sensitive breastfeeding promotion and postpartum support services are needed for this Vietnamese community.",M2
18006608,"Posttherapy radiation safety considerations in radiomicrosphere treatment with 90Y-microspheres.Radiomicrosphere treatment involves the intrahepatic arterial administration of (90)Y-resin or (90)Y-glass microspheres. The microspheres are biocompatible, but not biodegradable, and little to no (90)Y leaches from the microspheres. Without any bioelimination, the beta-dose delivery is generally confined to the liver. Although U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission requirements permit patients treated with these microspheres to be released without the need for dose determination or patient instructions, there are important radiation safety issues that need scientific clarification. We carefully evaluated the radiation exposure mechanisms, including the bremsstrahlung radiation doses to others, for a variety of lifestyle behaviors. Dose estimates were also made for several practical and theoretic situations involving the patient's gonads, an embryo or fetus, and a <e>nursing</e> infant. For the infant, we evaluated the potential beta-dose that might be introduced via breast milk ingestion. The bremsstrahlung component of the decay scheme of the pure beta-emitter (90)Y has traditionally been ignored in internal and external dose calculations. Because the production of in vivo bremsstrahlung with the high-energy pure beta-particle-emitting radionuclides used for therapeutic purposes is sufficient to permit external detection and imaging, we believe that the contribution of such radiation should be considered with regard to patient release; we therefore chose to evaluate this potential external radiation hazard. In all cases, the estimated doses were very small, indicating that no patient restrictions are required for radiation safety purposes after the release of a patient who has been treated with (90)Y-microspheres.",M2

Six nursing textbooks, all published since 1999, were reviewed using a standardized scoring sheet. Five reviewers (1 pediatrician, 2 lactation consultants, 1 nurse, and 1 research assistant) examined breastfeeding content in each text. Each textbook was graded for inclusion of 20 basic breastfeeding facts derived from recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics and the World Health Organization. Of the 20 criteria scored, the mean number present was 17 (range, 14-19). For each category, the mean number of criteria was correct (11.8; range, 10-15) incorrect (5.2; range, 2-8), and omitted (3.0; range, 1-6). The scores were Pilliteri 10/20 (50%), Ladewig 11/20 (55%), Leifer 11/20 (55%), Ball 12/20 (60%), London 12/20 (60%), and Klossner 15/20 (75%).

17968221,"Kangaroo care at birth for full term infants: a pilot study.PURPOSE: To determine whether breastfeeding behaviors, skin temperature, and blood glucose values could be influenced through the use of kangaroo care at the time of birth in healthy full term infants. METHOD: Descriptive study with nine full term neonates given kangaroo care beginning within 1 minute of birth and continuing until completion of the first breastfeeding by mothers who intended to breastfeed. Infant skin temperature was taken at 1 and 5 minutes after birth and every 15 minutes thereafter. Blood glucose level was taken 60 minutes after birth, the time at which the infant latched onto the breast was recorded, and breastfeeding behaviors were observed during the first breastfeeding. RESULTS: Skin temperature rose during birth kangaroo care in eight of the nine infants, and temperature remained within neutral thermal zone for all infants. Blood glucose levels varied between 43 and 85 mg/dL for infants who had not already fed and between 43 and 118 mg/dL for those who had fed. All but one infant spontaneously crawled to and latched onto a breast by 74 minutes after birth. Physicians noted that mothers were distracted from episiotomy or laceration repair discomfort during birth kangaroo care. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: In this institution, birth kangaroo care was integrated into routine delivery room care, with nurses noting no change in <e>nursing</e> workload. Nurses have noted observing the crawling, latching, and successful breastfeeding of most infants.

A descriptive correlational method of investigation was implemented. A total of 210 fathers were recruited to participate in this study from the Kaohsiung City area. The results of this study were: (1) Fathers' attitudes regarding breast feeding were positive. (2) Fathers of breast-fed infants showed significantly more positive attitudes to breast feeding and significantly better marital adjustment. (3) Father's attitudes regarding breast-feeding, father-infant attachment, were positively or related with marital adjustment. (4) The best subsets to predict fathers' attitudes regarding breast-feeding included partner's feeding method, socioeconomic status, marital adjustment, and whether they had participated in deciding the feeding method; together, these subsets accounted for 20% of the total variance. (5) The best subsets to predict partner's feeding method were parity and father's attitudes regarding breast-feeding.

A cross sectional study to determine the current level of knowledge and practice of <e>nursing</e> mothers on exclusive breastfeeding in Jos was carried out. METHODS: The target population of interest was nursing mothers who have infants aged 6-12 months in Jos, a cosmopolitan city in the north central zone of Nigeria. A pre-tested, structured close ended interviewer questionnaire was used. Four hundred and seventy nursing mothers who consented were recruited for the study through a house-to-house visit. Three assistants (two females and a male) were recruited and trained on the questionnaire administration. Data analysis was by SPSS software and chi-square test of proportion for statistical significance of association was done. RESULTS: Out of the 470 nursing mothers studied 387 (82.3%) were able to define correctly exclusive breastfeeding while 315 (67.0%) practiced or were practicing exclusive breastfeeding at the time of this study. The knowledge and practice of exclusive breastfeeding was found to increase with increasing age and better educational status of the women. Ninety six (20.4%) nursing mothers said they never breastfed their babies while in public place. CONCLUSION: Although knowledge and practice of exclusive breastfeeding among the women were considerably high, the younger age brackets were less knowledgeable arid adherent to the practice.

Options to reduce this risk include discontinuing codeine after 2 to 3 days of use and being aware of symptoms of potential opioid toxicity in both mothers and newborns.",M2
17853160,"Breast-feeding pattern and onset of menstruation among Yoruba mothers of South-west Nigeria.OBJECTIVE: To determine the breast-feeding practices and duration of lactational amenorrhoea among women within the first year of delivery in a Nigerian population. METHOD: Cross-sectional study carried out between January 2005 and April 2006, among mothers within one year of delivery, who were attending the Infant Welfare Clinic at Wesley Guild Hospital, Ilesa, Nigeria. Using a semi-structured questionnaire, mothers were interviewed to obtain information regarding their socio-demographic characteristics, parity, breast-feeding habits, use of contraception and onset of menstruation after delivery. Information obtained was analysed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software version 11. RESULTS: All 268 (100%) mothers interviewed breast-fed their babies, 261 (97.4%) of which for at least 6 months. Most (71.6%) suckled exclusively for 6 months and more; only 10 (3.7%) never carried out exclusive breast-feeding. Age, parity and educational level did not affect the duration of exclusive breast-feeding. Lactational amenorrhoea lasted 3 months or more in 229 (85.5%) of the mothers. Of the 174 who exclusively breast-fed for 6 months, 109 (62.6%) remained amenorrhoeic during that time and, hence, met the criteria for use of LAM contraception. CONCLUSION: Exclusive breast-feeding among <e>nursing</e> mothers is highly prevalent among Yoruba mothers of South-west Nigeria. Since lactational amenorrhoea lasts 6 months in about two-thirds of the women nursing for that period of time, there is a great potential for the application of LAM for contraception.",M2
17764381,"The use of mood stabilizers during breastfeeding.The literature and majority of professional organizations endorse breastfeeding as a means to provide a number of health benefits to both mother and child. Notably, the postpartum period heralds an increased vulnerability for both new onset and symptom worsening of neuropsychiatric disorders, particularly bipolar disorder in women. While pharmacologic treatment is important for these patients, many physicians have been hesitant to prescribe medication for women who choose to breast-feed, despite the fact that a variety of medical illnesses are routinely treated in breastfeeding women (e.g., epilepsy, infection, allergies, and migraine) and that <e>nursing</e> infants may also directly receive medications for colic and reflux. To date, all psychotropic medications studied enter human breast milk, and many of these medications have undergone detailed investigations. While breastfeeding may complicate pharmacotherapy, it does not preclude it. There are limited scientifically derived guidelines in the treatment of women who choose to breast-feed. The pharmacokinetic properties and potential impact of infant exposure to mood stabilizers must be considered in the decision to breast-feed infants born to mothers receiving pharmacologic treatment for bipolar disorder. Past practices and methodologies for determining continuation of treatment are discussed in this article, as well as the current data for newer categories of drugs being used to treat bipolar disorder and their indications during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Treating pregnant women with neuropsychiatric illnesses in their childbearing years who are breastfeeding involves a thorough risk:benefit analysis to determine the relative safety of pharmacologic therapy. Familiarity with the extant literature and its limitations and practical considerations will enable optimizing treatment plans that maintain maternal mental health, minimize nursing infant exposures, and provide infant monitoring.",M2

Data on the transfer of inhaled corticosteroids from plasma to breast milk and the subsequent exposure of the breast-feeding infant has been unavailable. OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess budesonide concentrations in milk and plasma of asthmatic nursing women receiving maintenance treatment with the Pulmicort Turbuhaler and estimate the exposure of their breast-fed infants. METHODS: Milk and plasma samples were collected up to 8 hours after dosing from 8 mothers receiving budesonide maintenance treatment (200 or 400 microg twice daily). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated from budesonide milk and plasma concentrations. Infant exposure was estimated based on average milk budesonide concentrations. A single blood sample was obtained from 5 infants close to expected infant maximum concentration. RESULTS: Budesonide concentrations in milk reflected those in maternal plasma, supporting passive diffusion of budesonide between plasma and milk, and was always lower than that in plasma. The mean milk/plasma ratio was 0.46. The estimated daily infant dose was 0.3% of the daily maternal dose for both dose levels, and the average plasma concentration in infants was estimated to be 1/600th of the concentrations observed in maternal plasma, assuming complete infant oral bioavailability. Budesonide concentrations in infant plasma samples were all less than the limit of quantification. CONCLUSION: Maintenance treatment with inhaled budesonide (200 or 400 microg twice daily) in asthmatic nursing women results in negligible systemic exposure to budesonide in breast-fed infants.

OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of training perinatal-neonatal <e>nursing</e> and medical staff in breastfeeding guidance on the duration of breastfeeding in a middle-income urban population. METHODS: This was an interventional study with data collection before and after. The intervention was an intensive course on breastfeeding guidance provided to all of the neonatal nurses and midwives in a local general hospital (2001-2002). Data were collected on two cohorts of mothers and infants (before -1999 [n = 471], after -2003 [n = 364]) regarding the duration of breastfeeding and factors influencing its discontinuation. RESULTS: The rate of breastfeeding initiation rose from 84% to 93% (p = 0.0001) and the mean duration of breastfeeding rose from 3.7 +/- 3.7 to 5.6 +/- 4.3 months (p = 0.0001). The rate of breastfeeding in the delivery room rose from 3% to 37% (p = 0.0001). Satisfaction with breastfeeding guidance in the hospital rose from 43% to 79% (p = 0.0001). However, there was no change in the proportion of mothers who planned to breastfeed this infant (88% in both cohorts) and no significant differences in the reasons given by the mothers for stopping breastfeeding. CONCLUSION: Training hospital nursery staff in breastfeeding guidance is a potential, cost-effective intervention even in settings with relatively high rates of breastfeeding.",M2

17654429,"[Assisting mother with preterm infant breastfeeding]It is necessary to gain nutrition for infants, especially premature. The digestive systems of premature infants are immature, so they find it hard to absorb nutrients. Mother's milk is easy for preterm infants to digest and absorb, so it is the best food for them. In reality, however, mothers always face many problems when breastfeeding preterm infants. They need support systems to establish their confidence in breastfeeding in order to improve their success rates and thus facilitate their continuation of the practice. Nurses can teach mothers how to breastfeed preterm infants. The purpose of this paper, therefore, is to describe the characteristics of the gastrointestinal systems of premature babies, the benefits of breastfeeding for premature babies, the factors influencing premature breastfeeding, the transition from gavage to oral feeding and how to assist the mothers of premature babies with breastfeeding.
