20337714,"Screening a novel Na+/H+ antiporter gene from a metagenomic library of halophiles colonizing in the Dagong Ancient Brine Well in China.Metagenomic DNA libraries constructed from the Dagong Ancient Brine Well were screened for genes with Na(+)/H(+) antiporter activity on the antiporter-deficient Escherichia coli KNabc strain. One clone with a stable Na(+)-resistant phenotype was obtained and its Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene was sequenced and designated as m-nha. The deduced amino acid sequence of M-Nha protein consists of 523 residues with a calculated molecular weight of 58 147 Da and a <e>pI</e> of 5.50, which is homologous with NhaH from Halobacillus dabanensis D-8(T) (92%) and Halobacillus aidingensis AD-6(T) (86%), and with Nhe2 from Bacillus sp. NRRL B-14911 (64%). It had a hydropathy profile with 10 putative transmembrane domains and a long carboxyl terminal hydrophilic tail of 140 amino acid residues, similar to Nhap from Synechocystis sp. and Aphanothece halophytica, as well as NhaG from Bacillus subtilis. The m-nha gene in the antiporter-negative mutant E. coli KNabc conferred resistance to Na(+) and the ability to grow under alkaline conditions. The difference in amino acid sequence and the putative secondary structure suggested that the m-nha isolated from the Dagong Ancient Brine Well in this study was a novel Na(+)/H(+) antiporter gene.",M1
20109435,"A unified method for purification of basic proteins.Protein purification is still very empirical, and a unified method for purifying proteins without an affinity tag is not available yet. In the postgenomic era, functional genomics, however, strongly demands such a method. In this paper we have formulated a unique method that can be applied for purifying any recombinant basic protein from Escherichia coli. Here, we have found that if the pH of the buffer is merely one pH unit below the isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) of the recombinant proteins, most of the latter bind to the column. This result supports the Henderson-Hasselbalch principle. Considering that E. coli proteins are mostly acidic, and based on the pI determined theoretically, apparently all recombinant basic proteins (at least pI-1 &gt; or = 6.94) may be purified from E. coli in a single step using a cation-exchanger resin, SP-Sepharose, and a selected buffer pH, depending on the pI of the recombinant protein. Approximately, two-fifths of human proteome, including many if not all nucleic acid-interacting proteins, have a pI of 7.94 or higher; virtually all these 12,000 proteins may be purified using this method in a single step.",M1
20000792,"gamma-Glutamyl PAMAM dendrimer as versatile precursor for dendrimer-based targeting devices.Poly(amidoamine) (PAMAM) dendrimers are highly branched spherical polymers that have a unique surface of primary amine groups and provide a versatile design for targeted delivery of pharmaceuticals and imaging agents. Acetylation or succinylation of surface amine groups of PAMAM dendrimer derivatives is frequently performed to reduce nonspecific uptake. However, since targeting molecules, drugs/imaging agents, and acylating reagents react with the amine groups on dendrimer, such modification may limit the number of targeting molecules and/or drugs or may result in insufficient charge reduction. In this study, a gamma-glutamyl PAMAM dendrimer was designed and synthesized as a new precursor for targeting device. The relationship between surface electrical properties of the PAMAM dendrimer derivatives and pharmacokinetics was also determined. A PAMAM dendrimer (generation 4.0) was modified with a small number of Bolton-Hunter reagent to prepare Phe-P (<e>pI</e> 9.2). The amine residues of Phe-P were gamma-glutamylated to prepare Glu-P (pI 7.1). The alpha-amine residues of Glu-P were then acetylated or succinylated to prepare Ac-Glu-P (pI 5.3) or Suc-Glu-P (pI 3.6). For comparison, Phe-P was acetylated or succinylated to prepare Ac-P (pI 6.0) or Suc-P (pI 5.1). All the PAMAM dendrimer derivatives exhibited similar molecular size (7.2 to 7.8 nm) except for Ac-P (5.1 nm). The biodistribution studies were performed after radioiodination of each PAMAM dendrimer derivative with Na[(125)I]I. When injected intravenously to mice, both [(125)I]Ac-P and [(125)I]Suc-P exhibited prolonged radioactivity levels in the blood and significantly lower hepatic and renal radioactivity levels than those of [(125)I]Phe-P. Both [(125)I]Glu-P and [(125)I]Ac-Glu-P showed residence times in the blood similar to those of [(125)I]Ac-P and [(125)I]Suc-P. However, [(125)I]Glu-P also registered higher radioactivity levels in the kidney. High hepatic and renal radioactivity levels were observed with highly anionic [(125)I]Suc-Glu-P. These results indicate that, while the manipulation of pI between 5 to 6 would be appropriate to enhance blood retention and reduce renal and hepatic uptake, the amount of primary amine residues on dendrimer surface may also play a crucial role in their renal uptake. The findings in this study show that gamma-glutamyl PAMAM dendrimers would constitute versatile precursors to prepare PAMAM dendrimer-based targeting devices due to their neutral molecular charge (pI 7.1) and the presence of a large number of alpha-amine residues available for conjugation of targeting molecules and drugs/imaging agents.",M1
19879985,"Interaction among proteins and peptide libraries in proteome analysis: pH involvement for a larger capture of species.When capturing proteins via combinatorial peptide ligand libraries, a method well known for drastically reducing the concentration of high-abundance proteins and substantially magnifying the signal of low-abundance species, thus leading to the discovery of a large number of proteins previously undetected in proteomes, we had constantly noticed that there would be a loss of species initially present in the untreated sample, to the tune of 5%, up to 15% in some cases. Such losses are a nuisance and hamper to some extent the unique performance of the method. In order to verify if such losses could be reduced and also to understand some mechanisms of the capture process, we introduce here an important variant to the capture operation, up to the present carried out in physiological saline at pH 7.2. In this novel protocol, the binding step is conducted at three different pH values, namely the standard one at pH 7.2, plus two additional processes, at acidic (pH 4.0) and alkaline (pH 9.3) pH values. Indeed the capture process is more extensive, with a number of additional species captured at the two pH extremes in sera and other proteomes. Interestingly, at pH 4.0 newly detected proteins were mostly acidic, while at the alkaline pH additional protein species were more evenly distributed throughout the <e>pI</e> range towards the alkaline area. The role of pH in the complex mechanism of binding among the hexapeptide library and the various proteomes being analyzed is discussed and evaluated. Due to significant changes in protein patterns with pH, recommendations are thus made to increase the possibility to find additional gene products illustrated by two examples (snake venom and leaf protein extract). Keeping under control the environmental pH when facing reproducibility studies or for comparative proteomics profiling is also a general rule suggested by this study.",M1
19862512,"Purification, characterization, and mode of action of a rhamnogalacturonan hydrolase from Irpex lacteus, tolerant to an acetylated substrate.A novel rhamnogalacturonase (RGase) acting on an acetylated substrate was detected in the commercial preparation Driselase, an enzymatic mixture derived from the basidiomycete Irpex lacteus. The activity was isolated by hydrophobic interaction chromatography, gel filtration, and preparative isoelectric focusing, resulting in the isolation of five different rhamnogalacturonan hydrolases exhibiting various isoelectric points from 6.2 to 7.7. Sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analyses after trypsin cleavage of the five fractions revealed that the five rhamnogalacturonases have a molar mass of 55 kDa without any divergences in the identified peptides. The RGase with a <e>pI</e> of 7.2 exhibited a pH optimum between 4.5 and 5 and a temperature optimum between 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Its mode of action was analyzed by mass spectrometry of the oligosaccharides produced after hydrolysis of acetylated and nonacetylated rhamnogalacturonan. Oligomers esterified by an acetyl group on the reducing galacturonic acid residue or fully acetylated were detected in the hydrolysate showing that the novel enzyme is able to bind acetylated galacturonic acid in its active site.",M1
19801472,"Molecular characterization of a novel peroxidase from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120.The open reading frame alr1585 of Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 encodes a heme-dependent peroxidase (Anabaena peroxidase [AnaPX]) belonging to the novel DyP-type peroxidase family (EC 1.11.1.X). We cloned and heterologously expressed the active form of the enzyme in Escherichia coli. The purified enzyme was a 53-kDa tetrameric protein with a <e>pI</e> of 3.68, a low pH optima (pH 4.0), and an optimum reaction temperature of 35 degrees C. Biochemical characterization revealed an iron protoporphyrin-containing heme peroxidase with a broad specificity for aromatic substrates such as guaiacol, 4-aminoantipyrine and pyrogallol. The enzyme efficiently catalyzed the decolorization of anthraquinone dyes like Reactive Blue 5, Reactive Blue 4, Reactive Blue 114, Reactive Blue 119, and Acid Blue 45 with decolorization rates of 262, 167, 491, 401, and 256 muM.min(-1), respectively. The apparent K(m) and k(cat)/K(m) values for Reactive Blue 5 were 3.6 muM and 1.2 x 10(7) M(-1) s(-1), respectively, while the apparent K(m) and k(cat)/K(m) values for H(2)O(2) were 5.8 muM and 6.6 x 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), respectively. In contrast, the decolorization activity of AnaPX toward azo dyes was relatively low but was significantly enhanced 2- to approximately 50-fold in the presence of the natural redox mediator syringaldehyde. The specificity and catalytic efficiency for hydrogen donors and synthetic dyes show the potential application of AnaPX as a useful alternative of horseradish peroxidase or fungal DyPs. To our knowledge, this study represents the only extensive report in which a bacterial DyP has been tested in the biotransformation of synthetic dyes.",M1
19768463,"Selection of buffer pH by the isoelectric point of the antigen for the efficient heat-induced epitope retrieval: re-appraisal for nuclear protein pathobiology.Epitope retrieval (ER) using heating causes a dramatic improvement in the sensitivity of immunohistochemistry for formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissue sections. Here, the relationship between the pH of the retrieval buffer used for heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) and the isoelectric points (<e>pI</e>) of the antigen recognized by antibodies against nuclear proteins (mainly human pituitary transcription factors in this study) was investigated using FFPE tissue sections. A universal buffer, with a buffering capacity over a wide pH range from 2.0 to 12.0, was used for HIER. We found that the intensity of staining for most nuclear proteins after HIER depended simply on the pH of the buffer. Importantly, for efficient HIER, antigens with acidic pI required basic pH buffer conditions, while antigens with alkaline pI required acidic conditions. This implies that the electrostatic charge of the antigens contributed significantly to the efficiency of HIER. We conclude that appropriate selection of the pH of the buffer based on the pI of the individual antigens is of great importance for efficient ER. It is concluded that the mechanism of HEIR may, therefore, depend to a large extent on the pI of the antigen under investigation.",M1
19683796,"Biochemical and hemostatic mechanism of a novel thrombin-like enzyme.Thrombin-like enzyme (TLE) plays a significant role in vessel injury hemostasis. A novel snake venom TLE (Agacutin) was purified from Agkistrodon Acutus snake venom. Structural analysis indicated that Agacutin is a heterodimer that has a MW of 29,402 Da, a <e>pI</e> value of 5.39, and optimum activity at 35 degrees C and pH 7.5. The N-terminal 15 amino acid sequences of Agacutin are DSSGWSSYEGHEYYV (small subunit) and DCSSGWSSYEEHQYY (large subunit). In vitro studies indicated that the coagulation activity of Agacutin was activated by Ca(+2) or inhibited by phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, but not influenced by heparin or hirudin. The arginine esterase activity and fibrinogen hydrolysis result showed that Agacutin only cleaves alpha-subunit and releases fibrinopeptide A. In vivo studies indicated that Agacutin iv (0.01-0.05 U/kg) shortened 30.2-49% of the rabbit blood clotting time, or ip (0.5-2.0 U/kg) shortened 29.7-73.1% of the mouse tail bleeding time. Agacutin does not influence APTT, platelet or euglobulin clotting time, and activate Factor II or XIII. It converts fibrinogen into the soluble fibrin that accelerates hemostasis at wound.",M1
19646934,"A high throughput dimer screening assay for monoclonal antibodies using chemical cross-linking and microchip electrophoresis.A high throughput screening assay was developed to determine the total dimer level in antibody samples. This method utilizes high speed microchip electrophoresis separation following chemical cross-linking. Upon reacting with homobifunctional N-hydroxysuccinimide-esters (NHS-esters), covalent linkages can be established between the primary amines of two neighboring antibody molecules. The reaction conditions are optimized to achieve quantitative cross-linking of only physically associated monomers within an antibody dimer. The resulting cross-linked dimers, originating from either covalent or non-covalent antibody dimers, can then be separated from monomers by SDS electrophoresis. A commercial microchip electrophoresis instrument is used for high speed separation, allowing each sample to be analyzed in about 1min. This approach was applied to crude mammalian cell culture samples. Using a 96-well gel filtration spin column format, interfering species in the cell culture media were efficiently removed from the samples. This method is well suited to the purpose of high throughput antibody dimer quantitation during cell culture expression, including clone selection and cell culture development. The total dimer content, both covalent and non-covalent, can be determined for hundreds of crude samples in a few hours. The effects of different cross-linking conditions on the determined dimer levels, as well as of different antibody <e>pI</e> values, are discussed.",M1
19616421,"Purification of novel protein elicitor from Botrytis cinerea that induces disease resistance and drought tolerance in plants.PebC1, a novel protein elicitor was isolated and purified from the mycelium of gray mold fungus, Botrytis cinerea strain BC-4-2-2-1. The protein was eluted through HiTrap DEAE FF and RESOURCE Q anion exchange chromatography and displayed as a single band with an apparent molecular weight of 36 kDa on silver staining sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). The <e>pI</e> of the purified protein PebC1 was determined by 2-DE and was 4.85. Three peptide segments were obtained by MALDI-TOF. Similarity, the homology matching using protein BLAST search found that two proteins, viz. XP_001593856 and XP_001551609 were having high score and covered sequence of the three peptides. Protein XP_001551609, a deduced protein nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha-polypeptide, was more authentic because it was from Botryotinia fuckeliana that is better known as its anamorph, B.cinerea and showed 95% homology with the three polypeptides. The full cDNA sequence encoding for pebC1 (Genbank accession number FJ748868) was amplified from B. cinerea and consists of 639bp, which is same as a registered gene of XM_001551559, a nascent polypeptide-associated complex alpha-polypeptide partial mRNA. The gene encode a hypothetical protein speculated from an annotated genomic sequence from B. fuckeliana B05.10 (NW_001814507) and there is no publication about the gene. The PebC1 protein significantly promoted wheat seedling growth with an optimum protein concentration of 5 microg/mL. Root systemic activity of wheat with 4-5 leaves increased by 1.29 fold, and the wheat seedling drought resistance integrated index increased from 36.53 to 57.08 under two cycles of drought stress after treatment of PebC1. PebC1 protein at the optimum concentration of 10 microg/mL induced 69.19% disease resistance against gray mold fungus in tomato. Furthermore, phenylalanine ammonia-lyase (PAL), peroxides (POD), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) related to plant resistance metabolism were also increased considerably after PebC1 treatment. PAL activity was increased by 46.84% at 24h post-treatment, while POD and PPO activity increased by 109.5% and 111.0% at 72 h, respectively over the control.",M1
19616027,"N-terminal negatively charged residues in CD3varepsilon chains as a phylogenetically conserved trait potentially yielding isoforms with different isoelectric points: analysis of human CD3varepsilon chains.CD3varepsilon chains are essential to the structure, expression and signaling of T cell receptors. Here, we extend to human CD3varepsilon our previous data in mouse CD3varepsilon showing that, in T cells, proteolytic processing of the acidic N-terminal sequence of CD3varepsilon chains generate distinct polypeptide species that can be identified by two-dimension (IEF-SDS PAGE) electrophoresis and immunoblot. This was shown first by showing the processing of a fusion protein of GFP and the extracellular domain of mouse CD3varepsilon (mCD3GFP) expressed in Jurkat cells. Secondly, <e>pI</e> heterogeneity was also found in human CD3varepsilon chains immunoprecipitated from the surface of Jurkat cells or PHA blasts of human blood T lymphocytes. Comparison of CD3varepsilon chains from 27 different species shows that their N-terminal sequences share a strong acidic nature, despite the large differences in terms of length and composition, even among closely related species. Our results suggest that generation of CD3varepsilon chain isoforms with different N-terminal sequence and pI is a general phenomenon. Thus, as previously observed in the mouse, the relative abundance of CD3varepsilon chain species might regulate TCR/CD3 structure and function, including the strength of the interactions between CD3 dimers and the TCR clonotypic receptors, as well as TCR/CD3 activation thresholds. Interestingly, CD3varepsilon chains from 7 out of 27 species studied have putative N-glycosylation (NxS or NxT) motifs in their Ig extracellular domain. Their location, plus the conservation of residues involved in domain organization, the interactions with other CD3 chains, or the TCR, and signal triggering add new data useful to establish a permissive topology for the interaction between CD3 dimers and the TCR chains.",M1
19609445,"Physical properties of intact proteins may predict allergenicity or lack thereof.BACKGROUND: Predicting the allergenicity of proteins is challenging. We considered the possibility that the properties of the intact protein that may alter the likelihood of being taken up by antigen presenting cells, may be useful adjuncts in predicting allergens and non-allergens in silico. It has been shown that negatively charged acidic proteins are preferentially processed by dendritic cells. METHODOLOGY: Datasets (aeroallergen, food-allergen and non-allergen) for in-silico study were obtained from public databases. Isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>), net charge, and electrostatic potential (EP) were calculated from the protein sequence (for pI and net charge) or predicted structure (for EP). RESULT: Allergens and non allergens differed significantly in pI, net charge, and EP (p&lt;0.0001). Cluster analysis based on these parameters resulted in well defined clusters. Non-allergens were characterized by neutral to basic pI (mean+/-SE, 7.6+/-0.16) and positive charge. In contrast allergens were acidic (5.7+/-0.15) and negatively charged. Surface electrostatic potentials calculated from predicted structures were mostly negative for allergens and mostly positive for non-allergens. The classification accuracy for non-allergens was superior to that for allergens. Thus neutral to basic pI, positive charge, and positive electrostatic potentials characterize non-allergens, and seem rare in allergens (p&lt;0.0001). It may be possible to predict reduced likelihood of allergenicity in such proteins, but this needs to be prospectively validated.",M1
19581484,"Cloning of a novel pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase gene from Sphingobium sp. strain JZ-1 and characterization of the gene product.A novel esterase gene, pytH, encoding a pyrethroid-hydrolyzing carboxylesterase was cloned from Sphingobium sp. strain JZ-1. The gene contained an open reading frame of 840 bp. Sequence identity searches revealed that the deduced enzyme shared the highest similarity with many alpha/beta-hydrolase fold proteins (20 to 24% identities). PytH was expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and purified using Ni-nitrilotriacetic acid affinity chromatography. It was a monomeric structure with a molecular mass of approximately 31 kDa and a <e>pI</e> of 4.85. PytH was able to transform p-nitrophenyl esters of short-chain fatty acids and a wide range of pyrethroid pesticides, and isomer selectivity was not observed. No cofactors were required for enzyme activity.",M1
19554331,"Structural and functional characterization of Delphinus delphis hemoglobin system.Structural analysis of the hemoglobin (Hb) system of Delphinus delphis revealed a high globin multiplicity: HPLC-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) analysis evidenced three major beta (beta1 16,022 Da, beta2 16,036 Da, beta3 16,036 Da, labeled according to their progressive elution times) and two major alpha globins (alpha1 15,345 Da, alpha2 15,329 Da). ESI-tandem mass and nucleotide sequence analyses showed that beta2 globin differs from beta1 for the substitution Val126 --&gt; Leu, while beta3 globin differs from beta2 for the isobaric substitution Lys65 --&gt; Gln. The alpha2 globin differs from the alpha1 for the substitution Ser15 --&gt; Ala. Anion-exchange chromatography allowed the separation of two Hb fractions and HPLC-ESI-MS analysis revealed that the fraction with higher <e>pI</e> (HbI) contained beta1, beta2 and both the alpha globins, and the fraction with lower pI (HbII) contained beta3 and both the alpha globins. Both D. delphis Hb fractions displayed a lower intrinsic oxygen affinity, a decreased effect of 2,3-BPG and a reduced cooperativity with respect to human HbA(0), with HbII showing the more pronounced differences. With respect to HbA(0), either the substitution Probeta5 --&gt; Gly or the Probeta5 --&gt; Ala is present in all the cetacean beta globins sequenced so far, and it has been hypothesized that position 5 of beta globins may have a role in the interaction with 2,3-BPG. Regarding the particularly lowered cooperativity of HbII, it is interesting to observe that the variant human HbA, characterized by the substitution Lysbeta65 --&gt; Gln (HbJ-Cairo) has a decreased cooperativity with respect to HbA(0).",M1
19489608,"Arginine kinase peptide mass fingerprinting as a proteomic approach for species identification and taxonomic analysis of commercially relevant shrimp species.A proteomic approach aimed at species identification and taxonomic analysis of shrimp species of commercial interest is presented. Six different species belonging to the order Decapoda were considered. Preliminary, two-dimensional gel electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis of the sarcoplasmic proteome revealed interspecific variability in the isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) of arginine kinase. For this reason, arginine kinase spot was selected as a potential molecular marker and subjected to tryptic digestion followed by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) analysis. Arginine kinase PMF allowed the differentiation of the six species studied. Four samples of commercial origin obtained in local markets were analyzed to validate the methodology. The PMF cluster analysis also provided information about the phylogenetic relationships in these species. The application of this methodology may be of interest for the differentiation and taxonomic analysis of shrimp species complementing DNA-based phylogenetic studies.",M1
19459957,"Purification, characterization and mass spectrometric sequencing of a thermophilic glucuronoyl esterase from Sporotrichum thermophile.The cellulolytic system of the thermophilic fungus Sporotrichum thermophile contains a recently discovered esterase that may hydrolyze the ester linkage between the 4-O-methyl-D-glucuronic acid of glucuronoxylan and lignin alcohols. The glucuronoyl esterase named StGE1 was purified to homogeneity with a molecular mass of M(r) 58 kDa and <e>pI</e> 6.7. The enzyme activity was optimal at pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C. The esterase displayed a narrow pH range stability at pH 8.0 and retained 50% of its activity after 430 and 286 min at 50 and 55 degrees C, respectively. The enzyme was active on substrates containing glucuronic acid methyl ester, showing a lower catalytic efficiency on 4-nitrophenyl 2-O-(methyl-4-O-methyl-alpha-d-glucopyranosyluronate)-beta-D-xylopyranoside than its mesophilic counterparts reported in the literature, which is typical of thermophilic enzymes. StGE1 was proved to be a modular enzyme containing a noncatalytic carbohydrate-binding module. LC-MS/MS analysis provided peptide mass and sequence information that facilitated the identification and classification of StGE1 as a family 15 glucuronoyl esterase that showed the highest homology with the hypothetical glucuronoyl esterase CHGG_10774 of Chaetomium globosum CBS 148.51.

19459656,"Generating peptide titration-type curves using polymeric reverse micelles as selective extraction agents along with matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-mass spectrometry detection.Amphiphilic homopolymers that self-assemble into reverse micelles in nonpolar solvents have been used by us in the context of a two-phase liquid-liquid extraction protocol to selectively extract peptides from aqueous solution for MALDI-MS detection. In this manuscript, we investigate the scope of these materials in terms of its extraction capabilities, using compounds with varying isoelectric points (<e>pI</e>) and pK(a) values over a range of aqueous solution pHs. We find that the aqueous solution pH and analyte pK(a) values are the major factors controlling extraction selectivity. We also find that the experimental extraction efficiencies correspond very well with the fractional compositions of species calculated using analyte pK(a) values, indicating that these extraction materials can be used to simultaneously generate titration-type curves for each individual peptide in a mixture. We predict that such titration curves, along with accurate mass measurements, could represent a new way of improving protein identification procedures.",M1
19408412,"Chromatographic isolation and characterization of a novel peroxidase from large lima legumes.A novel peroxidase with antifungal activity was isolated from the large lima bean (Phaseolus limensis) seeds. The procedure entailed extraction, ammonium sulfate precipitation, affinity chromatography on Affi-gel blue gel, ion exchange chromatography on SP-Toyopearl, and gel filtration on Sephadex G-75. The enzyme was adsorbed on Affi-gel blue gel and SP-Toyopearl, and possessed a molecular weight of 34 kDa in SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis under both reducing and nonreducing conditions. There was an almost 110-fold increase in specific activity of the purified peroxidase compared with that of the crude extract. The enzyme exhibited a <e>pI</e> of 8.6 by isoelectric focusing electrophoresis, indicating that it is a basic protein. The optimum pH and the optimum temperature were 5.5 and 30 degreeC, respectively. The enzyme was stable up to 55 degreeC.

19394341,"Characterization of vitellin protein in the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae (Acari: Tetranychidae).In mites, vitellogenin synthesis, regulation and uptake by the oocytes as vitellin remain practically unknown. Although a partial sequence of the gene is now available, no previous studies have been conducted that describe the native vitellin protein in mites. The objective of this study was to characterize vitellin in the twospotted spider mite, Tetranychus urticae. The native twospotted spider mite vitellin migrated as a single major band with a molecular weight of 476+/-14.5 kDa as compared to 590+/-25.5 kDa for vitellin from the American dog tick, Dermacentor variabilis. However, isoelectric focusing analysis of native spider mite vitellin showed five bands with <e>pI</e> values slightly acidic to neutral (pH 5.8, 6.2, 6.7, 7.0 and 7.2), as is the case for insect and tick vitellins. Reducing conditions (SDS-PAGE) also revealed multiple subunits ranging from 290.9 to 3.6 kDa and was similar to that found in D. variabilis. Spider mite vitellin weakly bound lipids and carbohydrates compared to the tick. Unlike D. variabilis, the spider mite egg yolk protein does not bind heme. The significance of non-heme binding in mites is discussed.",M1

Furthermore, the method was used to study FITC-protein A-human IgG binding reaction.

No binding reaction was found between green fluorescence protein and the fluorescent-labeled proteins.",M1
19326945,"Sodium caseinates with an altered isoelectric point as emulsifiers in oil/water systems.Sodium caseinate was chemically modified in order to alter its isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>). Negatively charged carboxylic groups were introduced to lower the pI, and positively charged amino groups to achieve the opposite. Different chemical amino acid modification approaches were studied and the modified proteins were characterized using free amino group assays, SDS-PAGE, MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry, and zeta potential measurements. Oil-in-water emulsions were prepared using these modified caseinates. The pH stability behavior of the emulsions was monitored, and interestingly, the stability of the emulsion could be modulated through steering the pI of caseinate. Using different modified caseinates, it was possible to create emulsions that were stable in the acid, neutral, and alkaline regions of the pH spectrum. The stability behavior of the emulsions correlated well with the theoretical and experimentally determined pI values of the caseinates. Storage stability of emulsions was also studied at pH values around 7, and emulsions made of modified caseinates showed storage stability similar to that of unmodified caseinate emulsions.",M1
19325913,"Virus-specific read-through codon preference affects infectivity of chimeric cucumber green mottle mosaic viruses displaying a dengue virus epitope.A Cucumber green mottle mosaic virus (CGMMV) was used to present a truncated dengue virus type 2 envelope (E) protein binding region from amino acids 379 to 423 (EB4). The EB4 gene was inserted at the terminal end of the CGMMV coat protein (CP) open reading frame (ORF). Read-through sequences of TMV or CGMMV, CAA-UAG-CAA-UUA, or AAA-UAG-CAA-UUA were, respectively, inserted in between the CP and the EB4 genes. The chimeric clones, pRT, pRG, and pCG+FSRTRE, were transcribed into full-length capped recombinant CGMMV transcripts. Only constructs with the wild-type CGMMV read-through sequence yielded infectious viruses following infection of host plant, muskmelon (Cucumis melo) leaves. The ratio of modified to unmodified CP for the read-through expression clone developed was also found to be approximately 1:1, higher than what has been previously reported. It was also observed that infectivity was not affected by differences in <e>pI</e> between the chimera and its wild counterpart. Analysis of recombinant viruses after 21-days-postinculation (dpi) revealed that deletions occurred resulting in partial reversions of the viral population to near wild type and suggesting that this would be the limiting harvest period for obtaining true to type recombinants with this construct.",M1
19277606,"Identification of a novel UDP-N-acetylglucosamine enolpyruvyl transferase (MurA) from Vibrio fischeri that confers high fosfomycin resistance in Escherichia coli.MurA [UDP-N-acetylglucosamine (UDP-NAG) enolpyruvyl transferase] is a key enzyme involved in bacterial cell wall peptidoglycan synthesis and a target for the antimicrobial agent fosfomycin, a structural analog of the MurA substrate phosphoenol pyruvate. In this study, we identified, cloned and sequenced a novel murA gene from an environmental isolate of Vibrio fischeri that is naturally resistant to fosfomycin. The fosfomycin resistance gene was isolated from a genomic DNA library of V. fischeri. An antimicrobial agent hypersensitive strain of Escherichia coli harboring murA from V. fischeri exhibited a high fosfomycin resistance phenotype, with minimum inhibitory concentration of 3,000 microg/ml. The cloned murA gene was 1,269 bp long encoding a 422 amino acid polypeptide with an estimated <e>pI</e> of 5.0. The deduced amino acid sequence of the putative protein was identified as UDP-NAG enolpyruvyl transferase by homology comparison. The MurA protein with an estimated molecular weight of 44.7 kDa was expressed in E. coli and purified by affinity chromatography. MurA of V. fischeri will be a useful target to identify potential inhibitors of fosfomycin resistance in pharmacological studies.",M1
19270313,"Identification of bla(IMP-22) in Pseudomonas spp. in urban wastewater and nosocomial environments: biochemical characterization of a new IMP metallo-enzyme variant and its genetic location.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was the biochemical characterization of a new variant of the metallo-beta-lactamase, IMP-22. Moreover, the genetic environment of the bla(IMP-22) gene was investigated in Pseudomonas fluorescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa collected from urban wastewater and a teaching hospital in L'Aquila, Italy. METHODS: Molecular characterization of genetic elements was carried out by PCR and DNA sequencing methods. The new enzyme was purified from recombinant Escherichia coli BL21(DE)Rosetta/pBC-SK/IMP-22. Steady-state kinetic parameters (K(m) and V(max)) were determined for a large pattern of substrates. RESULTS: A new IMP metallo-beta-lactamase gene was found in a class 1 integron and in one case, in a plasmid of Pseudomonas spp. The bla(IMP-22) encodes for a pre-protein of 246 amino acids and the N-terminus of the mature beta-lactamase (NH(2)-PDLK) was also determined. The molecular mass and <e>pI</e> were 24 930 Da and 6.2, respectively. On the basis of the kinetic parameters calculated (K(m) and V(max)), IMP-22 was found to hydrolyse narrow- and extended-spectrum beta-lactams. Enzyme activity was found to be inhibited by metal chelators such as EDTA, 1,10-o-phenathroline and dipicolinic acid with an IC(50) of 800, 750 and 300 microM, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The finding of the bla(IMP-22) gene in P. fluorescens environmental strains and P. aeruginosa clinical isolate suggests the ongoing spread of bla(MBL) genes in several bacterial species and in different environments.",M1
19241021,"ProMoST: a tool for calculating the <e>pI</e> and molecular mass of phosphorylated and modified proteins on two-dimensional gels.Protein modifications such as phosphorylation are often studied by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, since the perturbation in the protein's pI value is readily detected by this method. It is important to be able to calculate the changes in the pI values that specific post-translational modifications cause and to visualize how these changes will effect protein migration on 2D gels. To address this need, we have developed ProMoST. ProMoST is a freely accessible Web-based application that calculates and displays the mass and pI values for either proteins in the NCBI database identified by accession number or from submitted FASTA format sequence.",M1
19204833,"Biochemical analysis of a papain-like protease isolated from the latex of Asclepias curassavica L.Most of the species belonging to Asclepiadaceae family usually secrete an endogenous milk-like fluid in a network of laticifer cells in which sub-cellular organelles intensively synthesize proteins and secondary metabolites. A new papain-like endopeptidase (asclepain c-II) has been isolated and characterized from the latex extracted from petioles of Asclepias curassavica L. (Asclepiadaceae). Asclepain c-II was the minor proteolytic component in the latex, but showed higher specific activity than asclepain c-I, the main active fraction previously studied. Both enzymes displayed quite distinct biochemical characteristics, confirming that they are different enzymes. Crude extract was purified by cation exchange chromatography (FPLC). Two active fractions, homogeneous by sodium dodecyl sulphate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, were isolated. Asclepain c-II displayed a molecular mass of 23,590 Da, a <e>pI</e> higher than 9.3, maximum proteolytic activity at pH 9.4-10.2, and showed poor thermostability. The activity of asclepain c-II is inhibited by cysteine proteases inhibitors like E-64, but not by any other protease inhibitors such as 1,10-phenantroline, phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride, and pepstatine. The Nterminal sequence (LPSFVDWRQKGVVFPIRNQGQCGSCWTFSA) showed a high similarity with those of other plant cysteine proteinases. When assayed on N-alpha-CBZ-amino acid-p-nitrophenyl esters, the enzyme exhibited higher preference for the glutamine derivative. Determinations of kinetic parameters were performed with N-alpha-CBZ-L-Gln-p-nitrophenyl ester as substrate: K(m)=0.1634 mM, k(cat)=121.48 s(-1), and k(cat)/K(m)=7.4 x 10(5) s(-1)/mM.",M1
19199293,"Analysis of charge heterogeneities in mAbs using imaged CE.An analytical method using the imaged CE (iCE) technology has been developed and validated for measuring contents of charge variants for mAb molecules. The method could generate similar information that require both conventional IEF electrophoresis and ion exchange liquid chromatography to generate as an iCE analysis would produce both the <e>pI</e> of the molecules and quantitative contents of charge variants. Thus, it offers unique advantages over the IEF and ion exchange methods in terms of identification, separation and quantitation of charge variants. The data presented in this study demonstrated that the iCE method is suitable not only for research purposes but also for quality control purpose of mAb clinical or commercial manufacture as the technique can be validated and possesses sufficient robustness. The developed generic iCE method has been tested for a wide range of therapeutic mAbs and proved its suitability for multiple mAb molecules. The tested mAbs are a group of molecules with a wide range of charge compositions (acidic species ranging from 10 to 70%) and a diverse range of pI of 6.9-9.6. Developing platform analytical technologies is an efficient way to meet the demand of rapid growth of therapeutic mAb candidates under clinical and preclinical development. The iCE technology is a good candidate to become a platform method as it could cover a broad range of pH gradient. The experiences learned during the developmental process would provide important and valuable information to the biotech industry for the evaluation of charge heterogeneity of mAbs in terms of release testing, characterization, stability study, process development support and comparability study.",M1
19196175,"Microdialysis of cytokines: methodological considerations, scanning electron microscopy, and determination of relative recovery.Cerebral microdialysis is a monitoring technique with expanding clinical and research utility following traumatic brain injury. This study's aim was to determine the relative recovery for 12 cytokines using both crystalloid (CNS perfusion fluid) and colloid (CNS perfusion fluid supplemented with 3.5% human serum albumin) perfusate. Six CMA71 microdialysis catheters (nominal molecular weight cut-off 100 kDa) were perfused in vitro with either crystalloid or colloid and the relative recovery (%) determined for the cytokines as follows (crystalloid/colloid perfusate): IL-1alpha (50.6/48), IL-1beta (34.6/38.4), IL-1ra (21.9/38.4), IL-2 (17.1/52.8), IL-4 (26/56.7), IL-6 (9.8/25.5), IL-8 (47.7/73.4), IL-10 (2.9/8.7), IL-17 (14.4/43.7), TNF-alpha (4.4/31.2), MIP-1alpha (31.8/55.6), and MIP-1beta (31.9/50.1). The colloid perfusate significantly improved relative recovery for nine of these cytokines ( p &lt; 0.05), but not for IL-1alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-8. Relative recovery was related to apparent molecular weight of cytokine and to isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>), a surrogate marker of hydrophilicity. The mean fluid recovery for crystalloid and colloid perfusate was 92% and 145%, respectively. Scanning electron microscopy was utilized to investigate the ultrastructure of microdialysis membranes: (1) 20-kDa membrane, (2) 100-kDa membrane, and (3) ex vivo 100-kDa membrane. The 100-kDa membranes possessed multiple large cavities and the catheter examined after use in human brain clearly demonstrated cellular debris within the pores of the membrane. While colloid perfusate improves relative recovery, it causes a net influx of fluid into the microdialysis catheter, potentially dehydrating the extracellular space. This study is the first to systematically determine relative recovery in vitro for a wide range of cytokines. The two forms of perfusion fluid require direct comparison in vivo.",M1
19146913,"The primary identification of a calcineurin A subunit-like protein in plants.Many types of serine/threonine protein phosphatase have been cloned and characterized in plants, such as Type-1 serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP1), Type-2A serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP2A), Type-2C serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP2C). However no Type-2B serine/threonine protein phosphatase (PP2B, calcineurin), or calcineurin A subunit-like protein (CaNAL), has been identified. We detected protein phosphatase activity in mixtures of CaM-binding proteins from three plants (Nicotiana tabacum, Brassica oleracea and Arabidopsis thaliana). Two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-D) and Western blot analysis with an anti-rat CNA antibody revealed a small protein of 60 kDa that we believe is a CaNAL. The isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) of this protein in N. tabacum was approximately 5.69. The protein phosphatase activity in the mixture of CaM-binding proteins from N. tabacum was regulated by Ca(2+) and Calmodulin (CaM) with either RII peptides or pNPP as substrate. The immunosuppressive drugs, CsA and FK506, also inhibited the protein phosphatase activity significantly.",M1
19091014,"Flanking signal and mature peptide residues influence signal peptide cleavage.BACKGROUND: Signal peptides (SPs) mediate the targeting of secretory precursor proteins to the correct subcellular compartments in prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Identifying these transient peptides is crucial to the medical, food and beverage and biotechnology industries yet our understanding of these peptides remains limited. This paper examines the most common type of signal peptides cleavable by the endoprotease signal peptidase I (SPase I), and the residues flanking the cleavage sites of three groups of signal peptide sequences, namely (i) eukaryotes (Euk) (ii) Gram-positive (Gram+) bacteria, and (iii) Gram-negative (Gram-) bacteria. RESULTS: In this study, 2352 secretory peptide sequences from a variety of organisms with amino-terminal SPs are extracted from the manually curated SPdb database for analysis based on physicochemical properties such as <e>pI</e>, aliphatic index, GRAVY score, hydrophobicity, net charge and position-specific residue preferences. Our findings show that the three groups share several similarities in general, but they display distinctive features upon examination in terms of their amino acid compositions and frequencies, and various physico-chemical properties. Thus, analysis or prediction of their sequences should be separated and treated as distinct groups. CONCLUSION: We conclude that the peptide segment recognized by SPase I extends to the start of the mature protein to a limited extent, upon our survey of the amino acid residues surrounding the cleavage processing site. These flanking residues possibly influence the cleavage processing and contribute to non-canonical cleavage sites. Our findings are applicable in defining more accurate prediction tools for recognition and identification of cleavage site of SPs.",M1
19091128,"Human immunodeficiency virus type-1 reverse transcriptase exists as post-translationally modified forms in virions and cells.BACKGROUND: HIV-1 reverse transcriptase (RT) is a heterodimer composed of p66 and p51 subunits and is responsible for reverse transcription of the viral RNA genome into DNA. RT can be post-translationally modified in vitro which may be an important mechanism for regulating RT activity. Here we report detection of different p66 and p51 RT isoforms by 2D gel electrophoresis in virions and infected cells. RESULTS: Major isoforms of the p66 and p51 RT subunits were observed, with <e>pI</e>'s of 8.44 and 8.31 respectively (p66(8.44) and p51(8.31)). The same major isoforms were present in virions, virus-infected cell lysates and intracellular reverse transcription complexes (RTCs), and their presence in RTCs suggested that these are likely to be the forms that function in reverse transcription. Several minor RT isoforms were also observed. The observed pIs of the RT isoforms differed from the pI of theoretical unmodified RT (p66(8.53) and p51(8.60)), suggesting that most of the RT protein in virions and cells is post-translationally modified. The modifications of p66(8.44) and p51(8.31) differed from each other indicating selective modification of the different RT subunits. The susceptibility of RT isoforms to phosphatase treatment suggested that some of these modifications were due to phosphorylation. Dephosphorylation, however, had no effect on in vitro RT activity associated with virions, infected cells or RTCs suggesting that the phospho-isoforms do not make a major contribution to RT activity in an in vitro assay. CONCLUSION: The same major isoform of p66 and p51 RT is found in virions, infected cells and RTC's and both of these subunits are post-translationally modified. This post-translational modification of RT may be important for the function of RT inside the cell.",M1
19082176,"In-capillary enrichment, proteolysis and separation using capillary electrophoresis with discontinuous buffers: application on proteins with moderately acidic and basic isoelectric points.Advances in mass spectrometry and capillary-format separation continue to improve the sensitivity of protein analysis. Of equal importance is the miniaturization of sample pretreatment such as enrichment and proteolysis. In a previous report (Nesbitt et al., Electrophoresis, 2008, 29, 466-474), nanoliter-volume protein enrichment, tryptic digestion, and partial separation was demonstrated in capillary electrophoresis followed by MALDI mass spectral analysis. A discontinuous buffer system, consisting of ammonium (pH 10) and acetate (pH 4), was used to create a pH junction inside the capillary, trapping a protein with a neutral isoelectric point, myoglobin (<e>pI</e> 7.2). Moreover, co-enrichment of myoglobin with trypsin led to an in-capillary digestion. In this paper, the ability of this discontinuous buffer system to perform similar in-capillary sample pretreatment on proteins with moderately acidic and basic pI was studied and reported. Lentil lectin (pI 8.6) and a multi-phosphorylated protein, beta-casein (pI 5.1), were selected as model proteins. In addition to the previously shown tryptic digestion, proteolysis with endoproteinase Asp-N was also performed. Digestion of these acidic and basic pI proteins produced a few peptides with extreme pI values lying outside the trapping range of the discontinuous buffer. An alteration in the peptide trapping procedure was made to accommodate these analytes. Offline MALDI mass spectral analysis confirmed the presence of the expected peptides. The presented miniaturized sample pretreatment methodology was proven to be applicable on proteins with a moderately wide range of pI. Flexibility in the choice of protease was also evident.",M1
19070864,"Predicting protein retention time in ion-exchange chromatography based on three-dimensional protein characterization.The isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>), molecular weight (M(W)) and aqueous two-phase partitioning coefficients of a set of model proteins were related to retention time in cation-exchange chromatography using partial least squares regression. A three-dimensional method which combined hydrophobic partitioning and two-dimensional electrophoresis was used to determine those three properties for a mixture of proteins. The regression models fit well (R(2)=0.913 and 0.873 for two resin types) considering the limited property basis, and were able to predict results for a small test set of proteins. The models showed that greater size and charge increased retention time, while the net influence of hydrophobicity depended on the base matrix type. This establishes the potential for the intended application to complex mixtures of host cell proteins.",M1
19066882,"Metabolism of hydroxylated PCB congeners by cloned laccase isoforms.The white-rot fungus T. versicolor UAMH 8272 produced two groups of laccases, each of which included several isoforms showing different isoelectric points (<e>pI</e>). Group 1 and group 2 laccases, respectively, displayed higher pI 5-6 and lower pI 3-4. Of the four cloned full-length laccase cDNAs, Lac 1 and Lac 4 were expressed in the heterologous protein expression system using Aspergillus oryzae. The measured pI of each Lac 1 and Lac 4 expressed in A. oryzae was lower than that of pI predicted from the amino acid composition. With this regard, isoelectric focusing of Lac 1 showed the presence of multiple protein bands in the 3.0-4.0 pI range, although the predicted pI value of Lac 1 was 4.7. Similarly, Lac 4 exhibited a pI value which was lower than that predicted (3.6 vs. 4.3, respectively). In all tested hydroxyPCBs, higher chlorinated hydroxyPCBs were less susceptible to in vitro degradation by laccase than lower chlorinated hydroxyPCBs. Although Lac 4 showed a generally higher activity than Lac 1, the two laccases were characterized by quite different substrate specificity toward two hydroxy-tetrachlorobiphenyl congeners. Two metabolites were obtained from the metabolism of hydroxy-pentachlorobiphenyl: a ten chlorine-substituted dimer with a C-O bond, and one with a C-C bond.",M1
19061081,"Improvement of charge-transfer indices for multifunctional amino acids: application to lysozyme.Valence topological Charge-Transfer (CT) indices are applied to the calculation of pH at the isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>). The model is generalized for molecules with heteroatoms. The ability of the indices for the description of molecular charge distribution is established by comparing them with the pI of 21 amino acids. Linear correlation models are obtained. The CT indices improve multivariable regression equations for pI. The variance decreases by 95%. No superimposition of the corresponding G(k)-J(k) and G(k)(V)-J(k)(V) pairs is observed in most fits, which diminishes the risk of collinearity. The inclusion of heteroatoms in pi-electron system is beneficial for the description of pI, the because of either the role of the additional p orbitals provided by heteroatom or the role of steric factors in pi-electron conjugation. The use of CT/valence CT indices {G(k), J(k), G(k)(V), J(k)(V)} gives limited results for modelling amino acid pI. The inclusion of the number of acidic/basic groups improves the models. The effect is specially noticeable for amino acids with more than two functional groups. The fitting line for 21 amino acids is used to estimate lysozyme pI replacing (1 + Delta n/n(T)) with (M + Delta n)/n(T). The results for lysozyme fragments can estimate the pI of the whole protein with 1-13% error.",M1
19033278,"Aggregation-resistant VHs selected by in vitro evolution tend to have disulfide-bonded loops and acidic isoelectric points.When panned with a transient heat denaturation approach against target enzymes, a human V(H) (antibody heavy chain variable domain) phage display library yielded V(H)s with composite characteristics of binding, non-aggregation and reversible thermal unfolding. Moreover, selection was characterized by enrichment for V(H)s with (i) an even number of disulfide forming Cys residues in complementarity-determining region (CDR) 1 and CDR3 and (ii) acidic isoelectric points. This parallels naturally occurring camelid and shark single-domain antibodies (sdAbs) which are also characterized by (i) solubility and reversible unfolding, (ii) a high occurrence of disulfide forming Cys in their CDRs, particularly, in CDR1 and CDR3 and (iii) acidic V(H)s as inferred here by a <e>pI</e> distribution analysis, reported here, of pools of human and camelid V(H) and V(H)H (camelid heavy chain antibody V(H)) sequences. Our results, reinforced by previous observations by others, suggest that protein acidification may yet be another mechanism nature has devised to create functional sdAbs and that this concept along with the inclusion of inter-CDR disulfide linkages may be applied to human V(H) domains/libraries for non-aggregation optimization. In addition, calculation of theoretical pIs of V(H)s selected by panning may be used for rapid and precise identification of non-aggregating V(H)s.",M1
19023148,"Protease-dependent fractional mass and peptide properties.Mass spectrometric analyses of peptides mainly rely on cleavage of proteins with proteases that have a defined specificity. The specificities of the proteases imply that there is not a random distribution of amino acids in the peptides. The physico-chemical effects of this distribution have been partly analyzed for tryptic peptides, but to a lesser degree for other proteases. Using all human proteins in Swiss-Prot, the relationships between peptide fractional mass, <e>pI</e> and hydrophobicity were investigated. The distribution of the fractional masses and the average regression lines for the fractional masses were similar, but not identical, for the peptides generated by the proteases trypsin, chymotrypsin and gluC, with the steepest regression line for gluC. The fractional mass regression lines for individual proteins showed up to +/-100 ppm in mass difference from the average regression line and the peptides generated showed protease-dependent properties. We here show that the fractional mass and some other properties of the peptides are dependent on the protease used for generating the peptides. With the increasing accuracy of mass spectrometry instruments it is possible to exploit the information embedded in the fractional mass of unknown peaks in peptide mass fingerprint spectra.",M1
19015833,"Discreplasminin, a plasmin inhibitor isolated from Tityus discrepans scorpion venom.Tityus discrepans venom (TdV) produces digestive hemorrhages, disseminated intravascular coagulation, alveoli fibrin deposition and/or prothrombin and partial thromboplastin time alterations in humans. T. discrepans venom presents an in vitro tissue plasminogen activator-like (tPA-like), fibrino(geno)lytic and plasmin inhibitory activities. The plasmin inhibitor, called discreplasminin, was isolated from TdV. Discreplasminin has a <e>pI</e> of 8.0 and a relative molecular weight of &lt;6,000 Da. Discreplasminin and aprotinin strongly inhibited plasmin activity and moderately tPA activity, while epsilon amino caproic acid (EACA) moderately inhibited both enzymes. In presence and absence of fibrin, the plasmin generation by tPA was completely inhibited by aprotinin and discreplasminin. EACA in the absence of fibrin partially inhibited plasmin generation (37%); however, it produced a total inhibition of plasmin generation on a fibrin surface. The tPA-clot lysis assay showed that discreplasminin acts like aprotinin inducing a slight delay in lysis time and lysis rate; in contrast, EACA presented a total inhibitory effect on fibrin lysis. These results suggest that discreplasminin presents an anti-fibrinolytic mechanism similar to aprotinin. Discreplasminin probably interacts with the active sites of plasmin and tPA. The presence of discreplasminin and other similar components in scorpion venom could partially explain the generalized fibrin deposition which was found previously in rams.",M1
19003865,"Peptide separation with immobilized <e>pI</e> strips is an attractive alternative to in-gel protein digestion for proteome analysis.Complex protein mixtures have traditionally been separated by 2-DE. Görg introduced IPGs as the first dimension of protein separation. In recent years, MS-based proteomics has increasingly become the method of choice for identifying and quantifying large number of proteins. In that technology, to decrease analyte complexity, proteins are often separated by 1-D SDS-gel electrophoresis before online MS analysis. Here, we investigate a recently introduced device for peptide separation with IPGs (Agilent OFFGEL). Loading capacity for optimal peptide focusing is below 100 microg and--similar to 2-D gels--IEF is more efficient in the acidic than the basic pH region. The 24-well fractionation format resulted in about 40% additional peptide identifications but less than 20% additional protein identifications than the 12-well format. Compared to in-gel digestion, peptide IEF consistently identified a third more proteins with equal number of fractions. Low protein starting amounts (10 microg) still resulted in deep proteome coverage. Advantages of the in-gel format include better reliability and robustness. Considering its superior performance, diminished sample and work-up requirements, peptide IEF will become a method of choice for sample preparation in proteomics.",M1
19003858,"A versatile peptide <e>pI</e> calculator for phosphorylated and N-terminal acetylated peptides experimentally tested using peptide isoelectric focusing.We experimentally demonstrate the use of an in-house developed pI calculator which takes into account peptide PTM such as phosphorylation and N-terminal acetylation. The pI calculator was utilized for a large set of peptides derived from a complex zebrafish lysate fractionated using peptide IEF, whereby a good correlation between the calculated (theoretical) pI and the experimental pI could be established. This pI calculator permits the implementation of optimal pK values depending on the experimental conditions and a reliable calculation of peptide pI which can be utilized as a filtering technique in validating peptide identifications. Our data reveal that the shift due to a phosphorylation or N-terminal acetylation is highly dependent on the presence of acidic or basic residues in the peptide. Furthermore, using this pI calculator, we revealed previously unknown position-specific pKs of asparagine and carbamidomethylated cysteine depending on their location in the peptide. Collectively, this peptide pI calculator is a welcome addition to the versatility and robustness of IEF for the separation and confident identification of (post-translationally modified) peptides.",M1
18996683,"Comparison of the interfacial properties of Eugenia uniflora and Triticum vulgaris lectins.We have investigated the interfacial and dielectric properties of EuniSL, a recently purified lectin obtained from seeds of Eugenia uniflora (EuniSL), through surface pressure (<e>Pi</e>) and surface potential (DeltaV) measurements of its floating monolayers at the 2.0&lt;pH&lt;9.0 range, and compared the corresponding results to those obtained for Langmuir films of Triticum vulgaris (WGA). The variation of Pi and DeltaV as a function of the molecular area reveals that while the interfacial properties of both lectins are strongly dependent upon the pH of bulk phase, in general terms EuniSL monolayers seem to be more structured than those of WGA. At the pH range investigated, the interfacial electric double layer values (Psi(0)) calculated from the surface potential are negative, both for EuniSL and WGA. While for EuniSL definite breakpoints in an otherwise linear dependence of Psi(0) and zeta-potential as a function of pH were detected at pH 6.5, similar changes were observed for WGA at pH 8.5, a value close to the isoelectric point (pI) of this lectin. We have then used electrical impedance spectroscopy to investigate the dielectric characteristics of aqueous solutions of the two lectins, assuming a simple Debye relaxation model, and determined the pI of EuniSL as 6.5. While it is well known that the pI of a protein dispersed as a Langmuir film can be determined by surface potential measurements, our results confirm the use of impedance spectroscopy as a valuable and convenient technique that allows the identification of the pI of proteins directly dispersed in aqueous solutions.",M1

The novel protein's molecular mass was 19.7 kD and its <e>pI</e> was 4.80. Both SDS-PAGE and isoelectric-focusing (IEF) revealed a single Coomassie brilliant blue stained band, indicating that the novel protein was a single peptide. The N-terminal amino acid sequence of the protein was IPYISASFPLNIEFLPSE, which had no similarity with any other protein sequences in the NCBI protein database.

18945786,"The cationic properties of SEVI underlie its ability to enhance human immunodeficiency virus infection.Human semen contains peptides capable of forming amyloid fibrils termed semen-derived enhancer of viral infection (SEVI) that can greatly increase human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. While SEVI appears to enhance virion attachment to target cells, its underlying mechanism of action is unknown. We now demonstrate that the intrinsic positive charges of SEVI (<e>pI</e> = 10.21) facilitate virion attachment to and fusion with target cells. A mutant form of SEVI in which lysines and arginines are replaced with alanines retains the ability to form amyloid fibrils but is defective in binding virions and enhancing infection. In addition, the interaction of wild-type SEVI with virions and the ability of these fibrils to increase infection are abrogated in the presence of various polyanionic compounds. These anionic polymers also decrease the enhancement of HIV infection mediated by semen. These findings suggest that SEVI enhances viral infection by serving as a polycationic bridge that neutralizes the negative charge repulsion that exists between HIV virions and target cells. Combinations of agents that neutrale SEVI action and produce HIV virucidal effects are an attractive future direction for microbicide development.",M1
18930845,"Sequence microheterogeneity of parvalbumin <e>pI</e> 5.0 of pike: a mass spectrometric study.Parvalbumin (PA) is a muscle and neuronal calcium-binding protein, the major fish and frog allergen. Its characteristic feature is the presence of multiple isoforms with significantly different amino acid sequences. Here we show that the major isoform of northern pike muscle PA (pI 5.0, alpha-PA) exhibits microheterogeneity of amino acid sequence. ESI Q-TOF mass-spectrometry (MS) analysis of alpha-PA sample showed the presence of two components with mass difference of 71 Da. Analysis of tryptic and endoproteinase Asp-N digests of alpha-PA by MALDI-TOF MS revealed peptides, corresponding to two different amino acid sequences. The sequence differences between variant proteins are limited to AB-domain and include substitutions K27A and L31K, and an extra Leu residue between K11 and K12. Since the affected residues comprise a cluster on the surface of PA, an involvement of the identified region into target recognition is suggested. The substitutions at positions 27 and 31 are located in the region of previously identified epitopes of parvalbumin relevant for PA-specific IgE and IgG binding, which suggests different immunoactivities of the variants. The found microheterogeneity of PA is suggested to be of importance for physiological adaptation of the propulsive musculature to developmental and/or environmental requirements and may contribute to PA allergenicity.",M1

The pi-class GST cDNA (leGSTp) was cloned from the cold-adapted Antarctic bivalve Laternula elliptica. We used degenerated primers designed based on highly conserved regions of known mollusk GSTs to amplify the corresponding L. elliptica mRNA. Full-length cDNA was obtained by rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). The full sequence of the GST cDNA was 1189 bp in length, with a 5' untranslated region (UTR) of 74 bp, a 3' UTR of 485 bp, and an open reading frame of 630 bp encoding 209 amino acid residues with an estimated molecular mass of 23.9 kDa and an estimated isoelectric point of 8.3. Quantitative RT-PCR confirmed basal expression of leGSTp, which was up-regulated upon heat treatment (10 degrees C for different time periods) by a factor of 2.3 (at 24 h) and 2.7 (at 48 h) in the digestive gland and gill tissues, respectively. The recombinant leGSTp expressed in Escherichia coli was purified by affinity chromatography and characterized. The purified leGSTp exhibited high activity towards the substrates ethacrynic acid (ECA) and 1-chloro-2,4-dinitrobenzene (CDNB). The recombinant leGSTp had a maximum activity at approximately pH 8.0, and its optimum temperature was 35 degrees C.",M1
18854037,"Cutaneous and mucosal human papillomaviruses differ in net surface charge, potential impact on tropism.Papillomaviruses can roughly be divided into two tropism groups, those infecting the skin, including the genus beta PVs, and those infecting the mucosa, predominantly genus alpha PVs. The L1 capsid protein determines the phylogenetic separation between beta types and alpha types and the L1 protein is most probably responsible for the first interaction with the cell surface. Virus entry is a known determinant for tissue tropism and to study if interactions of the viral capsid with the cell surface could affect HPV tropism, the net surface charge of the HPV L1 capsid proteins was analyzed and HPV-16 (alpha) and HPV-5 (beta) with a mucosal and cutaneous tropism respectively were used to study heparin inhibition of uptake. The negatively charged L1 proteins were all found among HPVs with cutaneous tropism from the beta- and gamma-PV genus, while all alpha HPVs were positively charged at pH 7.4. The linear sequence of the HPV-5 L1 capsid protein had a predicted isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) of 6.59 and a charge of -2.74 at pH 7.4, while HPV-16 had a pI of 7.95 with a charge of +2.98, suggesting no interaction between HPV-5 and the highly negative charged heparin. Furthermore, 3D-modelling indicated that HPV-5 L1 exposed more negatively charged amino acids than HPV-16. Uptake of HPV-5 (beta) and HPV-16 (alpha) was studied in vitro by using a pseudovirus (PsV) assay. Uptake of HPV-5 PsV was not inhibited by heparin in C33A cells and only minor inhibition was detected in HaCaT cells. HPV-16 PsV uptake was significantly more inhibited by heparin in both cells and completely blocked in C33A cells.",M1
18787715,"Pullulanase from rice endosperm.Pullulanase (EC 3.2.1.41) in non-germinating seeds was compared with that in germinating seeds. Moreover, pullulanase from the endosperm of rice (Oryza sativa L., cv. Hinohikari) seeds was isolated and its properties investigated. The <e>pI</e> value of pullulanase from seeds after 8 days of germination was almost equal to that from non-germinating seeds, which shows that these two enzymes are the same protein. Therefore, the same pullulanase may play roles in both starch synthesis during ripening and starch degradation during germination in rice seeds. The enzyme was isolated by a procedure that included ammonium sulfate fractionation, DEAE-cellulofine column chromatography, preparative isoelectric focusing, and preparative disc gel electrophoresis. The enzyme was homogeneous by SDS/PAGE. The molecular weight of the enzyme was estimated to be 100 000 based on its mobility on SDS/PAGE and 105 000 based on gel filtration with TSKgel super SW 3000, which showed that it was composed of a single unit. The isoelectric point of the enzyme was 4.7. The enzyme was strongly inhibited by beta-cyclodextrin. The enzyme was not activated by thiol reagents such as dithiothreitol, 2-mercaptoethanol or glutathione. The enzyme most preferably hydrolyzed pullulan and liberated only maltotriose. The pullulan hydrolysis was strongly inhibited by the substrate at a concentration higher than 0.1%. The degree of inhibition increased with an increase in the concentration of pullulan. However, the enzyme hydrolyzed amylopectin, soluble starch and beta-limit dextrin more rapidly as their concentrations increased. The enzyme exhibited alpha-glucosyltransfer activity and produced an alpha-1,6-linked compound of two maltotriose molecules from pullulan.",M1
18782553,"In situ delipidation of low-density lipoproteins in capillary electrochromatography yields apolipoprotein B-100-coated surfaces for interaction studies.An electrochromatographic method was developed for the in situ delipidation of intact low-density lipoprotein (LDL) particles immobilized on the inner wall of a 50-microm inner diameter silica capillary. In this method, the immobilized LDL particles were delipidated with nonionic surfactant Nonidet P-40 at pH 7.4 and 25 degrees C, resulting in an apolipoprotein B-100 (apoB-100)-coated capillary surface. The mobility of the electroosmotic flow marker dimethyl sulfoxide gave information about the surface charge, and the retention factors of beta-estradiol, testosterone, and progesterone were informative of the surface hydrophobicity. The calculated distribution coefficients of the steroids produced specific information about the affinity interactions of the steroids, with capillary surfaces coated either with intact LDL particles or with apoB-100. Delipidation with Nonidet P-40 resulted in a strong decrease in the hydrophobicity of the LDL coating. Atomic force microscopy images confirmed the loss of lipids from the LDL particles and the presence of apoB-100 protein coating. The in situ delipidation of LDL particles in capillaries represents a novel approach for the isolation of immobilized apoB-100 and for the determination of its <e>pI</e> value. The technique requires extremely low quantities of LDL particles, and it is simple and fast.",M1
18781358,"Characterization of a novel AmpC-type plasmid-mediated beta-lactamase from an Escherichia coli strain isolated in China.The aim of this work was to study the phenotypic and molecular characterization of a novel plasmid-mediated AmpC beta-lactamase from Escherichia coli E384. Conjugation experiments, isoelectric focusing, pulsed-field gel electrophoresis, plasmid profiling, and Southern blot as well as PCR, sequencing techniques, and susceptibility testing were carried out to investigate the underlying mechanism of resistance. The kinetic parameters were determined to characterize the novel enzyme. MIR-4 beta-lactamase, <e>pI</e> 8.2, is a novel variant with four substitutions of amino acids compared with the sequence of MIR-1. E. coli E384 displays resistance to eight beta-lactam antimicrobial agents and three fluoroquinolones. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of beta-lactam in combination with beta-lactamase inhibitors show no significant synergy. Kinetic parameters suggest that the novel enzyme effectively hydrolyzes broad-spectrum beta-lactams. The same hybridization signal was detectable only in the 54-kb plasmid band that hybridized with the bla (CTX-M)- and bla(ampC)-specific probes. This is the first description of a plasmid-mediated MIR-4 enzyme in China. This study illustrates the importance of molecular surveillance in tracking AmpC-producing strains at general hospitals and emphasizes the need for epidemiological monitoring.",M1
18769889,"Structural characterization and neuromuscular activity of a new Lys49 phospholipase A(2) homologous (Bp-12) isolated from Bothrops pauloensis snake venom.Bp-12 was isolated from Bothrops pauloensis snake venom in only one chromatographic step in reverse phase HPLC on micro-Bondapack C-18. The molecular mass of 13,789.56 Da was determined by mass spectrometry. The amino acids composition showed that Bp-12 presented high content of Lys, Tyr, Gly, Pro, and 14 half-Cys residues, typical of a basic PLA(2). The sequence of Bp-12 contains 122 amino acid residues: SLFELGKMIL QETGKNPAKS LGAFYCYCGW GSQGQPKDAV DRCCYVHKCC YKKITGCNPK KDRYSYSWKD KTLVCGEDNS CLKELCECDK AVAICLRENL NTYNKKYRYF LKPLCKKADA AC, with a <e>pI</e> value of 8.55 and with a high homology with Lys49 PLA(2) from other snake venoms. In mouse phrenic nerve-diaphragm, the time needed for 50% paralysis was: 45 +/- 6 min (1.4 microM) and 16 +/- 6 min (3.6 microM). Bp-12 can induce indirect and directly blocked evoked twitches, even in the preparations in which Ca(2+) is replaced by Sr(2+), being the addition of d-tubocurarine required for direct blocking. These results identify Bp-12 as a new member of the Lys49 PLA(2) family and shows that this toxin might contribute to the effects of the crude venom on the neuromuscular junction.",M1
18721457,"The M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase of Plasmodium falciparum binds to human erythrocyte spectrin in vitro.BACKGROUND: During erythrocytic schizogony, Plasmodium falciparum interacts with the human erythrocyte membrane when it enters into, grows within and escapes from the erythrocyte. An interaction between the P. falciparum M18 aspartyl aminopeptidase (PfM18AAP) and the human erythrocyte membrane protein spectrin was recently identified using phage display technology. In this study, recombinant (r) PfM18AAP was characterized and the interaction between the enzyme and spectrin, as well as other erythrocyte membrane proteins, analyzed. METHODS: rPfM18AAP was produced as a hexahistidine-fusion protein in Escherichia coli and purified using magnetic bead technology. The <e>pI</e> of the enzyme was determined by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and the number of subunits in the native enzyme was estimated from Ferguson plots. The enzymatic activity over a pH and temperature range was tested by a coupled enzyme assay. Blot overlays were performed to validate the spectrin-PfM18AAP interaction, as well as identify additional interactions between the enzyme and other erythrocyte membrane proteins. Sequence analysis identified conserved amino acids that are expected to be involved in cofactor binding, substrate cleavage and quaternary structure stabilization. RESULTS: rPfM18AAP has a molecular weight of ~67 kDa and the enzyme separated as three entities with pI 6.6, 6.7 and 6.9. Non-denaturing gel electrophoresis indicated that rPfM18AAP aggregated into oligomers. An in vitro coupled enzyme assay showed that rPfM18AAP cleaved an N-terminal aspartate from a tripeptide substrate with maximum enzymatic activity at pH 7.5 and 37 degrees C. The spectrin-binding region of PfM18AAP is not found in Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and otherPlasmodium species homologues. Amino acids expected to be involved in cofactor binding, substrate cleavage and quaternary structure stabilization, are conserved. Blot overlays with rPfM18AAP against spectrin and erythrocyte membrane proteins indicated that rPfM18AAP binds to spectrin, as well as to protein 4.1, protein 4.2, actin and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase. CONCLUSION: Studies characterizing rPfM18AAP showed that this enzyme interacts with erythrocyte spectrin and other membrane proteins. This suggests that, in addition to its proposed role in hemoglobin digestion, PfM18AAP performs other functions in the erythrocyte host and can utilize several substrates, which highlights the multifunctional role of malaria enzymes.",M1
18693250,"Membrane Interaction of botulinum neurotoxin A translocation (T) domain. The belt region is a regulatory loop for membrane interaction.The translocation of the catalytic domain through the membrane of the endosome to the cell cytoplasm is a key step of intoxication by botulinum neurotoxin (BoNT). This step is mediated by the translocation (T) domain upon endosome acidification, although the mechanism of interaction of the T domain with the membrane is still poorly understood. Using physicochemical approaches and spectroscopic methods, we studied the interaction of the BoNT/A T domain with the membrane as a function of pH. We found that the interaction with membranes does not involve major secondary or tertiary structural changes, as reported for other toxins like diphtheria toxin. The T domain becomes insoluble around its <e>pI</e> value and then penetrates into the membrane. At that stage, the T domain becomes able to permeabilize lipid vesicles. This occurs for pH values lower than 5.5, in agreement with the pH encountered by the toxin within endosomes. Electrostatic interactions are also important for the process. The role of the so-called belt region was investigated with four variant proteins presenting different lengths of the N-extremity of the T domain. We observed that this part of the T domain, which contains numerous negatively charged residues, limits the protein-membrane interaction. Indeed, interaction with the membrane of the protein deleted of this extremity takes place for higher pH values than for the entire T domain. Overall, the data suggest that acidification eliminates repulsive electrostatic interactions between the T domain and the membrane, allowing its penetration into the membrane without triggering detectable structural changes.",M1
18686036,"A putative peroxidase cDNA from turnip and analysis of the encoded protein sequence.A putative peroxidase cDNA was isolated from turnip roots (Brassica napus L. var. purple top white globe) by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE). Total RNA extracted from mature turnip roots was used as a template for RT-PCR, using a degenerated primer designed to amplify the highly conserved distal motif of plant peroxidases. The resulting partial sequence was used to design the rest of the specific primers for 5' and 3' RACE. Two cDNA fragments were purified, sequenced, and aligned with the partial sequence from RT-PCR, and a complete overlapping sequence was obtained and labeled as BbPA (Genbank Accession No. AY423440, named as podC). The full length cDNA is 1167bp long and contains a 1077bp open reading frame (ORF) encoding a 358 deduced amino acid peroxidase polypeptide. The putative peroxidase (BnPA) showed a calculated Mr of 34kDa, and isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) of 4.5, with no significant identity with other reported turnip peroxidases. Sequence alignment showed that only three peroxidases have a significant identity with BnPA namely AtP29a (84%), and AtPA2 (81%) from Arabidopsis thaliana, and HRPA2 (82%) from horseradish (Armoracia rusticana).

Protein sequence analyses indicated that they possessed 39 amino acid residues with three disulfide bonds. The amino acid sequence of dBPS(1) showed 45% identity with dBPS(2). The amino acid sequence of dBPS(2) was the same as cygnin, a small protein from black swan, and strongly homologous with meleagrin from turkey and chicken. Phylogenic relationships implied that dBPS(1) and dBPS(2) share a common ancestry with cygnin and meleagrin. Based on MALDI-TOF mass spectra, the molecular masses of dBPS(1) and dBPS(2) were 4,373, and the 4,486 Da. <e>pI</e> of dBPS(1) and dBPS(2) elucidated by isoelectric focusing were 9.35 and 9.44. FT-IR spectra classified these proteins as (beta) proteins. Both dBPS(1) and dBPS(2), possessed high heat stability, Td 101.2 and 98.3 degrees C.

18646262,"Tailoring orthogonal proteomic routines to understand protein separation during ion exchange chromatography.Surface charge, molecular weight, and folding state are known to influence protein chromatographic behaviour onto ion exchangers. Experimentally, information related to such factors can be gathered via 2-DE methods. The application of 2-D PAGE under denaturing/reducing conditions was already shown to reveal separation trends within a large protein population from cell extracts. However, ion-exchange chromatography normally runs under native conditions. A tailored protocol consisting in a first separation based on IEF on Immobiline strips under native conditions followed by a second dimension SDS-PAGE run was adopted. The chromatographic versus electrophoretic separation behaviours of two model proteins, thaumatin (TAU) and BSA, were compared to better understand which proteomic routine would be better suited to anticipate IEX chromatographic separations. It was observed that the information contained in the <e>pI</e> value obtained with the adapted 2-DE protocol showed better correlation with the IEX chromatographic behaviour. On the other hand, chromatographic separations performed in the presence of urea as a denaturant have demonstrated the potential influence of hydrodynamic radius/conformation on protein separation. Moreover, the information provided by such 2-D system correlated well with the chromatographic behaviour of an additional set of pure proteins. An initial prediction of protein ion-exchange chromatographic behaviour could be possible utilizing an experimental approach based on 2-DE running under milder chemical conditions. This technique provides information that more closely resembles the separation behaviour observed with a complex biotechnological feedstock.",M1
18620086,"A <e>pI</e>-based protein fractionation method using solid-state buffers.The analysis of very complex proteomes is dependent on efficient fractionation methods with low level of carry over from fraction to fraction. Among various possibilities the separation by ranges of isoelectric points for further analysis appears as attractive, but current methods involving an electrically driven migration in the presence of ampholyte carriers are not exempt of technical complications. In the present work a new separation concept is described involving the use of so-called solid-state buffers, in association with ion exchangers, to separate protein categories of different pI ranges with a low level of protein overlapping. Resin blends packed in separated columns are used under a cascade configuration of increasing or decreasing pH and, once proteins of different pI are adsorbed by individual resin blends, the columns are dissociated. From each column protein mixtures corresponding to a given pI range are collected by competitive desorption with salts so as to be ready for proteomic analysis. The process is rapid and does not involve electrical fields nor addition of carrier ampholyte material. The presence of potassium chloride during the separation prevents protein precipitation at the vicinity of their isoelectric points. The fractions thus obtained can be used for two dimensional electrophoresis and mass spectrometry analysis after the removal of salts.",M1
18618459,"Use of quasi-isoelectric buffers to limit protein adsorption in capillary zone electrophoresis.The use of quasi-isoelectric buffers consisting of narrow pH cuts of carrier ampholytes (NC) has been investigated to limit protein adsorption on capillary walls during capillary zone electrophoresis experiments. To quantify protein adsorption on the silica surface, a method derived from that of Towns and Regnier has been developed. alpha-Lactalbumin (14 kDa, <e>pI</e> 4.8) and alpha-chymotrypsinogen A (25 kDa, pI 9.2) have been used as model proteins. Acidic narrow pH cuts of carrier ampholytes (NC, pH 3.0) obtained from fractionation of Serva 4-9 carrier ampholytes were used as BGE in bare-silica capillaries, and allowed to decrease significantly protein adsorption, as compared to experiments performed with classical formate buffer. The use of NC as BGE appeared to be as efficient as the use of polydimethylacrylamide coating to prevent protein adsorption. This increase of protein recovery when using NC was attributed to the interaction of carrier ampholytes with the silica surface, leading to a shielding of the capillary wall.",M1
18615785,"Calculation of the isoelectric point of tryptic peptides in the pH 3.5-4.5 range based on adjacent amino acid effects.Current algorithms for the calculation of peptide or protein <e>pI</e>, based on the charge associated with individual amino acids, can calculate pI values to within +/-0.2 pI units. Here, we present a new pI calculation algorithm that takes into account the effect of adjacent amino acids on the pI value. The algorithm accounts for the effect of adjacent amino acids+/-3 residues away from a charged aspartic or glutamic acid, as well as effects on the free C terminus, and applies a correction term to the corresponding pK values. The correction increments are derived from a 5000-peptide training set using a genetic optimization approach. The accuracy of the new pI values obtained with this method approaches the error associated with the manufacture of the IPG strip (&lt;+/-0.03 pI units). The approach is demonstrated for cytosolic cell extracts derived from the breast-cancer cell line DU4475, and from membrane preparations from human lung-tissue samples. One potential application of a more highly accurate pI calculation is data filtering of MS/MS outputs that will allow for more complex database searches including gene finding, and validation, and detection of coding single-nucleotide polymorphisms in their expressed form.",M1

The protease was subsequently purified and characterized. The apparent molecular mass of the enzyme was 115 kDa in SDS-PAGE under non-reducing condition, while on reduction it showed a 56 kDa protein band indicating that the protease is a dimeric protein. The purified enzyme was optimally active at the pH and temperature of 7.5 and 28 degrees C, respectively. Assays of thermal stability indicated that the enzyme preserved 59% of activity even after pretreatment at 42 degrees C for 1 h. The purified protease was not glycosylated and its isoelectric <e>pI</e> was 5.0. N-alpha-p-tosyl-L-arginine methylester (TAME) appeared to be relatively better substrate among the commonly used synthetic substrates.

18583329,"The AmpC phenotype in Norwegian clinical isolates of Escherichia coli is associated with an acquired ISEcp1-like ampC element or hyperproduction of the endogenous AmpC.OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine resistance mechanisms associated with an AmpC phenotype in Norwegian clinical isolates of Escherichia coli. METHODS: Clinical E. coli isolates (n = 106) with reduced susceptibility to third-generation cephalosporins without clavulanic acid synergy were collected from 12 Norwegian laboratories from 2003 to 2005. Twenty-two isolates with an AmpC phenotype were selected for further characterization by PFGE, isoelectric focusing, different PCR-based techniques, DNA sequencing, AmpC qRT-PCR, transfer studies and plasmid analyses. RESULTS: The 22 isolates were not clonally related by the PFGE analysis. All isolates expressed a beta-lactamase with a <e>pI</e> of 9.0-9.2. Ten isolates contained a bla(CMY) gene, which was linked to an ISEcp1-like element in all cases. Twelve isolates had mutations or insertions in the promoter or the attenuator regions, leading to increased expression of the chromosomal ampC gene. One of these isolates had an ISEc10 element inserted upstream of the chromosomal ampC gene. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first molecular study of Norwegian clinical E. coli isolates with an AmpC phenotype. Resistance was mediated either by expression of bla(CMY) from acquired ISEcp1-like-bla(CMY) elements, or by mutations or insertions in the chromosomal ampC gene control region leading to hyperproduction of the endogenous AmpC enzyme. There was no correlation between the level of ampC mRNA and the MICs of cephalosporins.",M1

The purified enzyme exhibits a band with a molecular mass of 158 kDa on native PAGE and two spots with a molecular mass of 80 kDa and a <e>pI</e> of 5.70, and a molecular mass of 78 kDa and a pI of 6.50, respectively, on two-dimensional gel electrophoresis. The N-terminal amino acid sequences of two subunits are as follows: PPO1, FGEEPGVQTTELKPLANPPQFRRASQLPRD; PPO2, FGDDAGERIPLQNLSQVPQFRVPSQLPTD. The amino acid composition of purified PPO was similar to that from Galleria mellonella. The enzyme kinetic property of the purified protein showed that the affinity of the enzyme for dopamine was higher than that for l-DOPA and N-acetyldopamine. The phenoloxidase (PO) reaction was strongly inhibited by phenylthiourea, thiourea, dithiothreitol and ethylene diamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA), but poorly inhibited by diethyldithiocarbamate (DTC) and triethylenetetramine hexaacetic acid (THAA), and was not inhibited by o-phenanthroline and ethylene glycol-bis (beta-aminoethylether) N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (EGTA). Both Mg(2+) and Cu(2+) stimulated PO activity when compared with controls. The beta-sheet content of PPO treated with Mg(2+) and Cu(2+) increased significantly (P&lt;0.05). The purified PPO has magnesium level of 5.674+/-2.294 microg/mg and copper level of 1.257+/-0.921 microg/mg as determined with ICP-MS, suggesting that the purified PPO is a metalloprotein.",M1

In this paper, a cDNA with two introns and three exons encoding a cysteine protease inhibitor was identified by screening a cDNA subtractive library constructed from the nematode, Steinernema carpocapsae, induced by Galleria mellonella hemolymph. The full-length cDNA contains an open reading frame encoding a 139-amino acid protein, designated Sc-cys, with a 19-residue signal peptide. The mature protein was predicted to have a molecular weight of 12,531.59 Da, a <e>pI</e> of 9.44, one disulfide bond, and three conserved domains believed to be important for the inhibition of cysteine proteases. In Basic Local Alignment and Search Tool analyses, the putative protein precursor displayed 26-42% identities to a multitude of cystatins or cystatin-like proteins. Phylogenetic analysis suggested the novel cystatin is likely a new member of the family 2 cystatins. Reverse northern blot, semi-quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), and real-time RT-PCR analyses showed that the expression level of Sc-cys was upregulated substantially after induction by insect hemolymph.

Both alpha and beta peptides showed bactericidal mode of action against indicator strain, Micrococcus luteus and together showed a synergistic action. These peptides were differentially sensitive to a range of proteolytic enzymes, indicating differences in their composition.

This technique facilitates the investigation and characterization of the formation of adducts between drugs and proteins. Cisplatin and oxaliplatin were mixed with the target protein at different concentrations (0:1, 1:1, 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100), and the reaction mixtures were incubated for 0, 0.5, 1, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h at 37 degrees C in a water-bath. The focused Hb-drug adduct profiles were imaged by WCID. At higher drug to protein molar ratios (for both oxaliplatin and cisplatin), the results exhibit significant changes in the peak shapes and heights, which may indicate the destabilization of the protein. However, the conformational change was less evident at lower molar ratios. In addition, a major <e>pI</e> shift was observed for the oxaliplatin reaction mixtures (for 1:10, 1:50, and 1:100 ratios). In comparison with previously reported findings obtained by other analytical methods, conclusions were drawn about the validity of CIEF as a simple and convenient method for the investigation of protein-drug interactions. These results may provide useful information for further understanding the activity and toxicity of these chemotherapeutic drugs and improving their clinical performance.",M1
18429264,"Proteomic analysis using 2-D liquid separations of intact proteins from whole-cell lysates.This unit describes procedures for 2-D liquid separations of proteins from whole-cell lysates. Protocols for protein isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) fractionation in the first dimension include the use of liquid isoelectric focusing (IEF) and chromatofocusing. The liquid IEF provides a pI-based fractionation using a batch-phase electrophoretic method, while chromatofocusing uses a column-based chromatographic method to generate the pH gradient. Using either method, a second-dimension fractionation is provided in the liquid phase using nonporous silica-based reversed-phase HPLC (NPS-RP-HPLC) to generate a 2-D liquid map of the protein content of the cell. The eluate of the 2-D liquid fractionation is directly coupled to a mass spectrometer for on-line detection of the intact molecular weights of proteins. As a result, a multidimensional map of protein expression is obtained that characterizes cellular proteins by pI, hydrophobicity, and intact molecular weight.

18420794,"ORF018R, a highly abundant virion protein from Singapore grouper iridovirus, is involved in serine/threonine phosphorylation and virion assembly.Iridovirus is an important pathogen causing serious diseases among wild, cultured and ornamental fish. Previous studies have shown that Singapore grouper iridovirus (SGIV) contains 162 open reading frames (ORFs) from which 51 viral proteins have been confirmed by proteomics studies. ORF018R, which is conserved among vertebrate iridoviruses, is an abundant virion protein identified from SGIV. Here, immunofluorescence staining showed that ORF018R occurred at high abundance throughout SGIV-infected cells. The function of ORF018R was explored using antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (asMOs). Knockdown of ORF018R expression resulted in a reduction in the expression of viral late genes, distortion of viral particle assembly and inhibition of SGIV infection in grouper embryonic cells. Western blotting with phosphoserine-specific antibody indicated that serine phosphorylation was significantly enhanced for proteins of molecular masss 17-32 kDa by SDS-PAGE when ORF018R expression was eliminated. These proteins were analysed further by two-dimensional gel electrophoresis, and numerous protein spots were found to shift to a lower <e>pI</e> and higher molecular mass as a result of the loss of ORF018R function. Five proteins with enhanced phosphorylation were identified by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (TOF)-TOF mass spectrometry, including three viral proteins: ORF049L (dUTPase), ORF075R and ORF086R, and two host proteins: subunit 12 of eukaryotic translation factor 3 and natural killer enhancing factor. These findings suggest that ORF018R is involved in serine/threonine phosphorylation in SGIV-infected late-stage cells and plays an important role in expression of viral late genes and virion assembly.",M1
18388989,"Properties of a non collagen-degrading Bacillus subtilis keratinase.Bacillus subtilis S14 produces a keratinase (KerS14) with non collagen-degrading activity. Indeed, this is the first keratinase described so far that does not have any detectable effect on collagen, which is a crucial property for an enzyme intended to be used in skin dehairing. Because of its importance as an industrial tanning enzyme, we report the biochemical characterization of KerS14. This protein exhibited an apparent molecular mass of 27 kDa, a <e>pI</e> of 6.5, and an optimum pH in the range of 8.0-9.0. The enzyme's activity was stimulated by Mn2+ (7.7-fold), Ca2+ (6.1-fold), Mg2+ (4.9-fold), and Co2+ (4.0-fold) but was inhibited by Cu2+ and Zn2+. Using p-nitroanilide and methylcoumarine derivatized peptides, we observed that KerS14 prefered Arg at subsite P1, small amino acid residues at subsite P2, and Gln or Glu at subsite P3. KerS14 presented higher keratin degradation specificity than other commercial proteases. Its high keratinolytic activity and the absence of virtually any activity against collagen remark the biotechnological potential of this enzyme to be used at larger scales in tannery dehairing processes.",M1
18379842,"A bifunctional endoglucanase/endoxylanase from Cellulomonas flavigena with potential use in industrial processes at different pH.Cellulomonas flavigena CDBB-531 was found to secrete a bifunctional cellulase/xylanase with a molecular mass of 49 kDa and <e>pI</e> 4.3. This enzyme was active on Remazol brilliant blue-carboxymethylcellulose (RBB-CMC) and Remazol brilliant blue-xylan (RBB-X). Based on thin-layer chromatographic analysis of the degradation products, the cellulase activity produced glucose, cellobiose, cellotriose, and cellotetraose from CMC as the substrate. When xylan from birchwood was used, end products were xylose, arabinose, and xylobiose. The bifunctional enzyme showed a pH optimum of 6 for cellulase activity and 9 for xylanase activity, which pointed out that this enzyme had separate sites for each activity. In both cases, the apparent optimum temperature was 50 degrees C. The predicted amino acid sequence of purified protein showed similarity with the catalytic domain of several glycosyl hydrolases of family 10.",M1
18376075,"Molecular cloning and characterization of a gene encoding RING zinc finger ankyrin protein from drought-tolerant Artemisia desertorum.A RING zinc finger ankyrin protein gene,designated AdZFP1, was isolated from drought-tolerant Artemisia desertorum Spreng by mRNA differential display and RACE. Its cDNA was 1723 bp and encoded a putative protein of 445 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass of 47.9 kDa and an isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) of 7.49. A typical C3HC4- type RING finger domain was found at the C-terminal region of the AdZFP1 protein,and several groups of ankyrin repeats were found at the N-terminal region. Alignments of amino acid sequence showed that AdZFP1 was 66% identical to the Arabidopsis thaliana putative RING zinc finger ankyrin protein AAN31869. Transcriptional analysis showed that AdZFP1 was inducible under drought stress in root,stem and leaf of the plant.Semi-quantitative reverse- transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis showed that the transcript of AdZFP1 was strongly induced by exogenous abscisic acid (ABA) and also by salinity,cold and heat to some extent. Overexpression of the AdZFP1 gene in transgenic tobacco enhanced their tolerance to drought stress.",M1
18369866,"Fractionation of complex protein mixtures by liquid-phase isoelectric focusing.Protein fractionation is essential to uncovering low-abundance proteins in complex protein mixtures. Many common methods and techniques are used to fractionate proteins, including chromatography (size exclusion, affinity, ion exchange, etc.), electrophoresis, and solution chemistry.

18350387,"Grass degrading beta-1,3-1,4-D-glucanases from Bacillus subtilis GN156: purification and characterization of glucanase J1 and pJ2 possessing extremely acidic <e>pI</e>.Purification of beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase from the cell-free culture fluid of Bacillus subtilis GN156 by affinity chromatography of epoxy-activated sepharose 6B and ultrafiltration technique resulted in homogeneous J1 and partially purified pJ2 enzymes. The molecular weight and pI of J1 were 25 kDa and 3.5, respectively, while those for J2 were 90 kDa and 3.6, respectively. Both beta-1,3-1,4-glucanase J1 and pJ2 had optimum pH values of 6-6.5 and an optimum temperature of 60 degrees C. Both enzymes were not inhibited by Li(2+) but were inhibited significantly by Ca(2+), Cu(2+), Mn(2+) and Zn(2+). However, J1 was slightly inhibited by Fe(2+), while pJ2 was inhibited by Mg(2+) as well. They were highly specific to only barley beta-glucan. K (m) and V (max) values of J1 were 1.53 mg/ml and 8,511 microU/ml.min, respectively, while those for pJ2 were 4.36 mg/ml and 7,397 microU/ml.min, respectively. Degradation of barley beta-1, 3-1,4-glucan resulted in four different oligosaccharides with 1,3 linkages triose, tetrose, pentose and a high molecular weight (HMW) with 1,3 linkage estimated from their mobilities. The quantitative degradation by the crude enzyme after of incubation yielded in descending order: triose, pentose and tetrose, while that of J1 in descending order yielded: pentose, triose and tetrose. The pJ2 showed low activity yielding a degradation pattern in descending order: pentose, triose, tetraose and a HMW polysaccharide.",M1
18343103,"Cholesterol sulphate sulphohydrolase of human placenta lysosomal membrane.In this paper we report that the activity of cholesterol sulphate sulphohydrolase (CHS-ase) is associated with the lysosomal membranes.

18329685,"Aggregation and surface properties of F-specific RNA phages: implication for membrane filtration processes.We report an experimental investigation of the electrokinetic properties and size variations of four F-specific bacteriophages of the types MS2, GA, Qbeta and SP (21-30 nm in diameter) over a broad range of pH values (1.5-7.5) and NaNO3 electrolyte concentrations (1-100 mM). The results obtained by dynamic light scattering show that the aggregation of SP and GA particles takes place over the whole range of pH and ionic strength conditions examined. For MS2 phages, the aggregation of MS2 particles is not observed for pH higher than the isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) and large ionic strengths for which interparticular repulsive electrostatic interactions are however expected to be sufficiently screened. Aggregation of the MS2 phages, dispersed in 1 and 100 mM electrolyte concentration, occurs at pH 4, which basically corresponds to the pI as determined by electrophoresis measurements. The Qbeta particles suspended in solutions of low electrolyte concentrations aggregate at low pH values (pI approximately 3) and, unlike MS2, at large ionic strengths over the whole range of pH conditions considered in this study. These elements allow the determination of the hydrophobic sequence for the four phages SP approximately GA&gt;Qbeta&gt;MS2. Close inspection of the electrokinetic results reveals small to significant variations of the pI values-depending on the phage considered-with respect to the concentration of indifferent NaNO3 electrolyte. This indicates that features other than chemical and electrostatic in nature play a key role in determining the pI and more generally the electrophoretic mobility mu of viral particles. A qualitative interpretation is given and is based on the consideration of inner electro-osmotic flow within the isolated or aggregated particles. The impact of the flow properties within the particles is further in agreement with recent theoretical formalism developed for the electrokinetics of soft multiplayer particles, the phages analyzed here being some illustrative examples. The determination and qualitative interpretation of the surface properties of the viral particles as reported in the current study are commented within the context of water treatment especially concerning viral removal by membrane filtration processes.",M1
18321602,"The PQQ-alcohol dehydrogenase of Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus.The oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid is the most characteristic process in acetic acid bacteria. Gluconacetobacter diazotrophicus is rather unique among the acetic acid bacteria as it carries out nitrogen fixation and is a true endophyte, originally isolated from sugar cane. Aside its peculiar life style, Ga. diazotrophicus, possesses a constitutive membrane-bound oxidase system for ethanol. The Alcohol dehydrogenase complex (ADH) of Ga. diazotrophicus was purified to homogeneity from the membrane fraction. It-exhibited two subunits with molecular masses of 71.4 kDa and 43.5 kDa. A positive peroxidase reaction confirmed the presence of cytochrome c in both subunits. Pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) of ADH was identified by UV-visible light and fluorescence spectroscopy. The enzyme was purified in its full reduced state; potassium ferricyanide induced its oxidation. Ethanol or acetaldehyde restored the full reduced state. The enzyme showed an isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) of 6.1 and its optimal pH was 6.0. Both ethanol and acetaldehyde were oxidized at almost the same rate, thus suggesting that the ADH complex of Ga. diazotrophicus could be kinetically competent to catalyze, at least in vitro, the double oxidation of ethanol to acetic acid.",M1

Using an [alpha-(32)P]GTP-binding assay, we detected the association of small GTP-binding proteins (21 and 17 kDa) with both types of vesicles. In addition, by ADP-ribosylation with C3 exotoxin, and Western blot analysis with specific antibodies, we identified the small GTPases RhoA (Rho1p) and Rab8, and a 17 kDa protein, with <e>pI</e> values of 6.0, 6.1, and 6.2 and molecular masses of 21, 21 and 17 kDa, respectively, associated with those vesicles carrying GOX activity. Rab and Cdc42 proteins with pI values of 6.1 and 6.2 and molecular masses of 21 and 17 kDa, respectively, were found associated with chitosomes. These data indicate the presence in M. circinelloides of low molecular mass G-proteins in chitosomes and in vesicles carrying GOX activity. The difference in association of Rho1 and Cdc42, with vesicles carrying GOX activity and chitosomes, respectively, indicates that each of these proteins probably controls formation, transport and specific plasma membrane site docking of the respective vesicles.",M1
18271253,"[Purification and properties of an antimicrobial substance from marine Brevibacillus laterosporus Lh-1]An antimicrobial substance produced by Brevibacillus laterosporus isolated from the sea sediment was purified and characterized. The antimicrobial substance was purified by ultrafiltration, DEAE-Sepharose Fast flow chromatography, CM-Sepharose Fast flow chromatography and HPLC reversed phase column chromatography, and after the final purification step, one active fraction was obtained, designated R-1. The molecular weight (MW) was accurately determined by MALDI-TOF-MS as 1608.023 Da. And its <e>pI</e> was determined with Rotofor Cell BIO-RAD to be 8.55. Amino acid analysis of the purified R-1 showed that it was composed of Leu, Tyr, Val, Ile, Lys, Gly, Met, Ser and Ala.

R-1 remained active over a wide temperature range and it also was active over a broad pH rang. R-1 was insusceptible to pancreatin, pepsin and alkaline proteinase. Agar radial diffusion assay showed that R-1 had low minimun bactericidal concentration against Gram-Positive Bacteria such as Streptococcus mutans, Staphylococcus aureaus, Clostridium and Gram- egative Bacteria such as Escherichia coli Pseudomonas putrefaciens And R-1 had antibacterial activities against Candida albicans",M1
18265336,"Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis.Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis is the combination of two high-resolution electrophoretic procedures (isoelectric focusing and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis) to provide much greater resolution than either procedure alone.

This gel is then applied to the top of an SDS-slab gel and electrophoresed. The proteins in the first-dimension gel migrate into the second-dimension gel where they are separated on the basis of their molecular weight. The basic protocols in this unit are based on the type of equipment originally described by O'Farrell in 1975. For very basic or very acidic proteins, two alternate protocols are provided.

18241877,"Adsorption, desorption, and conformational changes of lysozyme from thermosensitive nanomagnetic particles.Adsorption of globular protein, lysozyme, on thermosensitive poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) coated nanomagnetic particles was studied at different temperatures and pHs. It was observed that a maximum amount of lysozyme was adsorbed at a temperature above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) (32 degrees C ) of the polymer and at the isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>=11) of lysozyme. Desorption was carried out using either NaH2PO4 (pH 4) or NaSCN (pH 6) as the desorbing agents. Conformational changes in lysozyme on desorption from nanomagnetic particles was studied by circular dichroism and intrinsic fluorescence spectroscopy. Lysozyme desorbed by NaH2PO4 showed very little conformational changes while lysozyme desorbed by NaSCN showed significant conformational changes, and 87% enzymatic activity was retained in the desorbed enzyme for desorption by NaH2PO4.",M1
18094535,"Comparative proteome analysis of the outer membrane proteins of in vitro-induced multi-drug resistant Neisseria gonorrhoeae.Antimicrobial-resistant gonococcus has been a major problem in sexually transmitted disease control . Outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of Neisseria gonorrhoeae were suggested to have influence on its resistance to antibiotics. So, in this work, we provide a proteomic analysis tool for examining the OMPs of N. gonorrhoeae and also provide a comparative analysis of the OMPs between the susceptible parent strain (92WT) and the resistance-induced isogenic mutant (92mu13) to determine the OMPs responsible for resistance. The 2-D gel spots of 92mu13 differed from 92WT particularly in porin, pilus secretion protein (PilQ) and enzymes. PilQ expression in 92mu13 was considerably reduced by abrupt termination at nucleotide 2,112. This made it difficult to form a high molecular mass (HMM) pore at the outer membrane; it is suspected that reduction of PilQ serves a role in antibiotic resistance in N. gonorrhoeae. The amount of porin was not changed but its isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) shifted to a basic region, which is caused by the alteration of an amino acid of porin and it is suggested to relate to the development of antimicrobial resistance . Differential regulation of the enzymes involved in metabolism was found in 92mu13, believed to represent an adaptation of N. gonorrhoeae to the antibiotic environment.",M1
18081201,"Nanoliter-volume protein enrichment, tryptic digestion, and partial separation based on isoelectric points by CE for MALDI mass spectral analysis.Sequence-specific proteolysis is an important part of protein identification by MS. Digestion of protein is commonly performed in-solution, in sample vials with volumes ranging from milli- to microliters. When digestion is performed with a sample volume below 1 microL, handling of solution and potential sample loss via adsorption become significant issues. In this report, a proof of concept for the digestion of a small volume protein solution inside a capillary was demonstrated using a discontinuous buffer system previously studied (Nesbitt, C. A., et al. J. Chromatogr. A 2005, 1073, 175-180). Upon voltage application, a pH junction was created by the discontinuous buffer. Using myoglobin as an example, the protein molecules were enriched at the junction with an estimated volume of a few nanoliters. A protease, trypsin, was then introduced to myoglobin at the junction by coenrichment to induce in-capillary digestion. The voltage application was then suspended to provide the necessary time (2 h) for the proteolysis to proceed. When completed, voltage application was resumed, and the discontinuous buffer reconcentrated the peptides formed from digestion. Importantly, the refocused peptides appeared to roughly elute according to their <e>pIs</e>, resulting in a partial separation. Direct sample deposition from capillary was performed to facilitate mass spectral analysis by MALDI. The partial separation, according to pI, offered the potential benefits of MALDI MS signal enhancement and provided supplementary pI information for peptide identity assignment.",M1
18067978,"The major surface protease (MSP or GP63) in the intracellular amastigote stage of Leishmania chagasi.The Leishmania spp. protozoa have an abundant surface metalloprotease called MSP (major surface protease), which in Leishmania chagasi is encoded by three distinct gene classes (MSPS, MSPL, MSPC). Although MSP has been characterized primarily in extracellular promastigotes, it also facilitates survival of intracellular amastigotes. Promastigotes express MSPS, MSPL, and two forms of MSPC RNAs, whereas amastigotes express only MSPL RNA and one MSPC transcript. We confirmed the presence of MSPC protein in both promastigotes and amastigotes by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). More than 10 MSP isoforms were visualized in both amastigotes and promastigotes using two-dimensional immunoblots, but amastigote MSPs migrated at a more acidic <e>pI</e>. Promastigote MSPs were N-glycosylated, whereas most amastigote MSPs were not. Immuno-electron microscopy showed that two-thirds of the promastigote MSP is distributed along the cell surface. In contrast, most amastigote MSP localized at the flagellar pocket, the major site of leishmania endocytosis/exocytosis. Biochemical analyses indicated that most amastigote MSP is soluble in the cytosol, vesicles or organelles, whereas most promastigote MSP is membrane-associated and GPI anchored. Activity gels and immunoblots confirmed the presence of a novel proteolytically active amastigote MSP of higher Mr than the promastigote MSPs. Furthermore, promastigote MSP is shed extracellularly whereas MSP is not shed from axenic amastigotes. We conclude that amastigotes and promastigotes both express multiple MSP isoforms, but these MSPs differ biochemically and localize differently in the two parasite stages. We hypothesize that MSP plays different roles in the extracellular versus intracellular forms of Leishmania spp.",M1
18052360,"Adsorption behavior of acidic and basic proteins onto citrate-coated Au surfaces correlated to their native fold, stability, and <e>pI</e>.The adsorption of eight different proteins (alpha-lactalbumin (types I and III), bovine serum albumin, hemoglobin, myoglobin, cytochrome c, alpha-casein, and lysozyme) onto a model anionic surface was performed at equivalent bulk (solvent, ionic strength, pH) and surface conditions. Adsorption was monitored on a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation monitoring (QCM-D) with citrate-coated gold surfaces as adsorbents and has been correlated to native fold stability determined from near- and far-UV circular dichroism (CD) measurements. The proteins studied here were chosen based on their pI and documented knowledge about their structural stability and flexibility. Protein adsorption was found to be independent of global protein charge. Rather, binding occurs through oppositely charged patches on protein and surface. Moreover, data indicate that there is a correlation between secondary and tertiary structure stability and the adsorption characteristics at interfaces. Also, protein surface coverage, layer thickness, and flexibility can be tuned as a function of deposition method. This is discussed in terms of adsorption/spreading kinetics and intermolecular (protein-surface and protein-protein) interactions. Adsorption to surfaces can induce formation of supramolecular structures such as micelles (in the case of alpha-Cas) and multilayers (as for Hb). In the case of alpha-casein, this phenomenon depends on the deposition method and protein concentration. When ranking the surface coverage for proteins added in excess, the order is Lyz &lt; Cyt c &lt; Mb &lt; BSA &lt; alpha-La I &lt; alpha-Cas &lt; alpha-La III &lt; Hb, which can be correlated to the proteins ability to form supramolecular structures (alpha-Cas, Hb), overall conformational flexibilities, and ability to form stable intermediates.",M1

CS1-1, which was classified as a novel species belonging to Cellulomonas uda based on chemotaxanomic and phylogenetic analyses. The molecular mass was estimated as 50,000 Da and 52,000 Da for DI and DIII, respectively. Moreover, DIII was identified as a glycoprotein with a <e>pI</e> of 3.8, and DI was identified as a non-glycoprotein with a pI of 5.3. When comparing the ratio of the CMC-saccharifying activity and CMC-liquefying activity, DI exhibited a steep slope, characteristic of an endoglucanase, whereas DIII exhibited a low slope, characteristic of an exoglucanase. The substrate specificity of the purified enzymes revealed that DI efficiently hydrolyzed CMC as well as xylan, whereas DIII exhibited a high activity on microcrystalline celluloses, such as Sigmacells. A comparison of the hydrolysis patterns for pNP-glucosides (DP 2-5) using an HPLC analysis demonstrated that the halosidic bond 3 from the nonreducing end was the preferential cleavage site for DI, whereas bond 2, from which the cellobiose unit is split off, was the preferential cleavage site for DIII. The partial N-terminal amino acid sequences for the purified enzymes were 1Ala-Gly-Ser-Thr-Leu-Gln-Ala-Ala-Ala-Ser-Glu-Ser-Gly-Arg-Tyr15- for DI and 1Ala-Asp-Ser-Asp-Phe-Asn-Leu-Tyr-Val-Ala-Glu-Asn-Ala-Met-Lys15- for DIII.

DG-22 was isolated with a DNA probe obtained by PCR amplification, using degenerated primers deduced from the amino acid residues of the known N-terminal region of the purified enzyme and the conserved region in the family 11 xylanases. The positive clones were screened on the LB agar plates supplemented with xylan, by the Congo-red staining method. The xynA gene consists of a 630-bp open reading frame encoding a protein of 210 amino acids, and the XynA preprotein contains a 28-residues signal peptide whose cleavage yields a 182-residues mature protein of a calculated molecular weight of 20,000 Da and <e>pI</e> value of 8.77. The cloned DNA fragment also has another ORF of 873 nucleotides that showed 76% identity to the putative transcriptional activator of Bacillus halodurans C-125. Most of the xylanase activity was found in the periplasmic space of E. coli. The xynA gene was subcloned into pQE60 expression vector to fuse with six histidine-tag. The recombinant xylanase A was purified by heating and immobilized metal affinity chromatography. The optimum pH and temperature of the purified enzyme were 6.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively.

18031337,"Cloning and heterologous expression of aspartic protease SA76 related to biocontrol in Trichoderma harzianum.Trichoderma harzianum is a soil-borne filamentous fungus that exhibits biological control properties because it parasitizes a large variety of phytopathogenic fungi. The production of hydrolytic enzymes appears to be a key element in the parasitic process. Among the enzymes released by Trichoderma, the aspartic proteases play a major role. A gene (SA76) encoding an aspartic protease was cloned by 3' rapid amplification of cDNA ends from T. harzianum T88. The coding region of the gene is 1,593 bp long, encoding a polypeptide of 530 amino acids with a predicted molecular mass 55 kDa and a <e>pI</e> of 4.5. The catalytic aspartic residues characteristic of aspartic proteases are conserved with an active-site motif (DSG); however, the DSG in the N-terminal lobe is unusual in that Ser replaced Thr. Northern blot analysis indicated that SA76 was induced in response to different fungal cell walls. Aspartic protease SA76 was expressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae under control of the GAL1 promoter. The enzyme activity culminates (10.5 U mL(-1)) 72 h after induction with galactose. The temperature optimum of the enzyme was 45 degrees C and its pH optimum was 3.5. The culture supernatant of the S. cerevisiae strain that expressed the aspartic protease SA76 was able to inhibit the growth of five phytopathogenic fungi. The inhibition of mycelial growth varied between 7% and 38%.",M1
18025566,"Cell bound and extracellular glucose oxidases from Aspergillus niger BTL: evidence for a secondary glycosylation mechanism.Two glucose oxidase (GOX) isoforms where purified to electrophoretic homogeneity from the mycelium extract (GOXI) and the extracellular medium (GOXII) of Aspergillus niger BTL cultures. Both enzymes were found to be homodimers with nonreduced molecular masses of 148 and 159 kDa and <e>pI</e> values of 3.7 and 3.6 for GOXI and GOXII, respectively. The substrate specificity and the kinetic characteristics of the two GOX forms, as expressed through their apparent K m values on glucose, as well as pH and T activity optima, were almost identical. The only structural difference between the two enzymes was in their degrees of glycosylation, which were determined equal to 14.1 and 20.8% (w/w) of their molecular masses for GOXI and GOXII, respectively. The above difference in the carbohydrate content between the two enzymes seems to influence their pH and thermal stabilities. GOXII proved to be more stable than GOXI at pH values 2.5, 3.0, 8.0, and 9.0. Half-lives of GOXI at pH 3.0 and 8.0 were 8.9 and 17.5 h, respectively, whereas the corresponding values for GOXII were 13.5 and 28.1 h. As far as the thermal stability is concerned, GOXII was also more thermostable than GOXI as judged by the deactivation constants determined at various temperatures. More specifically, the half-lives of GOXI and GOXII, at 45 degrees C, were 12 and 49 h, respectively. These results suggest A. niger BTL probably possesses a secondary glycosylation mechanism that increases the stability of the excreted GOX.",M1

17990031,"A potential epidemic factor from the bacteria, Vibrio cholerae WO7.Certain species of Vibrio cholerae have evolved mechanisms to become pathogenic to humans, with the potential to cause a severe life-threatening diarrheal disease, cholera. Cholera can emerge as explosive outbreaks in the human population. V. cholerae illness is produced primarily through the expression of a potent toxin (cholera toxin) within the human intestine. The present study has been carried out on a novel toxin purified from V. cholerae W07, an epidemic cholera strain devoid of cholera toxin gene (ctx). A modified method of purification improved purification fold as well as yield of this toxin. Heating was found to be the essential and sufficient condition for dissociation of the two subunits (58 kDa and 40 kDa) of this toxin (<e>pI</e> 5.2). The 40-kDa subunit of the purified toxin was identified as the carbohydrate binding subunit. This toxin was found to induce apoptosis in HEp-2 cells. Thus, the WO7 toxin seems to have potential importance in the pathogenesis of disease associated with Vibrio cholerae WO7.",M1
17987330,"Cloning and characterization of a thermostable superoxide dismutase from the thermophilic bacterium Rhodothermus sp. XMH10.A superoxide dismutase (SOD) gene was cloned from the thermophilic bacterium Rhodothermus sp. XMH10 for the first time and highly expressed in Escherichia coli. The Rhodothermus sp. XMH10 SOD (RhSOD) gene encodes 209 amino acids with a putative molecular weight of 23.6 kDa and a <e>pI</e> value of 5.53. The recombinant RhSOD was detected to be an iron type SOD and existed as a dimer on its natural status. Experiments revealed that this RhSOD showed high activity at 50-70 degrees C and pH 5.0. Compared to SODs from other thermophiles, it was highly thermostable, maintaining more than 90% of its activity after incubation at 70 degrees C for 12 h, only totally inactivated after more than 4-h incubation at 80 degrees C. It also showed much higher resistance to KCN, NaN(3) and H(2)O(2) as compared to other SODs.",M1
17973290,"Two-dimensional separation of human plasma proteins using iterative free-flow electrophoresis.Blood plasma is the most complex human-derived proteome, containing other tissue proteomes as subsets. This proteome has only been partially characterized due to the extremely wide dynamic range of the plasma proteins of more than ten orders of magnitude. Thus, the reduction in sample complexity prior to mass spectrometric analysis is particularly important and alternative separation methodologies are required to more effectively mine the lower abundant plasma proteins. Here, we demonstrated a novel separation approach using 2-D free-flow electrophoresis (FFE) separating proteins and peptides in solution according to their <e>pI</e> prior to LC-MS/MS. We used the combination of sequential protein and peptide separation by first separating the plasma proteins into specific FFE fractions. Tryptic digests of the separated proteins were generated and subsequently separated using FFE. The protein separation medium was optimized to segregate albumin into specific fractions containing only few other proteins. An optimization of throughput for the protein separation reduced the separation time of 1 mL of plasma to approximately 3 h providing sufficient material for digestion and the subsequent peptide separation. Our approach revealed low-abundant proteins (e.g., L-selectin at 17 ng/mL and vascular endothelial-cadherin precursor at 30 ng/mL) and several tissue leakage products, thus providing a powerful orthogonal separation step in the proteomics workflow.",M1
17960736,"Interactome and interface protocol (2IP): a novel strategy for high sensitivity topology mapping of protein complexes.A few well-characterized protein assemblies aside, little is known about the topology and interfaces of multiconstituent protein complexes. Here we report on a novel indirect strategy for low-resolution topology mapping of protein complexes. Following crosslinking, purified protein complexes are subjected to chemical cleavage with cyanogen bromide (CNBr) and the resulting fragments are resolved by 2-D electrophoresis. The side-by-side comparison of a thus generated and a 2-D CNBr fragment map obtained from uncrosslinked material reveals candidate gel spots harboring crosslinked CNBr fragments. In-gel trypsinization and MALDI MS analysis of these informative spots identify the underlying crosslinked CNBr fragments based on unmodified tryptic peptides. Matching the cumulative theoretical molecular mass and predicted <e>pI</e> of these crosslinked CNBr fragments with original gel spot coordinates is required for confident crosslink assignment. The above strategy was successfully validated with the Escherichia coli RNA polymerase (RNAP) core complex and subsequently applied to query the quaternary structure of components of the yeast Skp1-Cdc53/Cullin-F box (SCF) ubiquitin ligase complex. This protocol requires low picomole sample quantities, can be applied to multisubunit protein complexes, and does not rely on specialized data mining software.",M1
17960731,"Time-course analysis of mouse serum proteome changes following exposure of the skin to ionizing radiation.Radiation-induced lesion outcomes of normal tissues are difficult to predict. In particular, radiotherapy or local exposure to a radioactive source by accident can trigger strong injury to the skin. The finding of biomarkers is of fundamental relevance for the prediction of lesion apparition and its evolution, and for the settlement of therapeutic strategies. In order to study radiation-induced cutaneous lesions, we developed a mouse model in which the dorsal skin was selectively exposed to ionizing radiation (IR). 2-D difference gel electrophoresis (2-D DIGE) coupled with MS was used to investigate proteins altered in expression and/or PTM in serum. Proteome changes were monitored from 1 day to 1 month postirradiation, at a dose of 40 Gy, in this specific model developing reproducible clinical symptoms ranging from erythema to skin ulceration with wound healing. About 60 proteins (including some isoforms and likely post-translational variants), representing 20 different proteins, that exhibited significant and reproducible kinetic expression changes, were identified using MS and database searches. Several proteins, down- or up-regulated from day one, could prove to be good candidates to prognosticate the evolution of a skin lesion such as necrosis. In addition, we observed shifts in <e>pI</e> of several spot trains, revealing potential PTM changes, which could also serve as indicators of irradiation or as predictors of lesion severity.",M1
17953574,"Effects of pH on plaque forming unit counts and aggregation of MS2 bacteriophage.AIM: The aim of this study was to determine whether aggregation processes in aqueous phase may explain the decrease in plaque forming unit (PFU) counts for pH close to the isoelectric point (<e>pI</e>) of viral particles (MS2 phages). METHODS AND RESULTS: Loss in PFU was observed for pH &lt; or = pI (pI(MS2) = 3.9): for example, at pH 2.5, loss was approx. 3 log(10) PFU. Particle size analysis combining results of dynamic light scattering and flow particle image analysis was then applied to determine the aggregate state of viral suspensions by recording size distributions. The size of major population significantly changed to 30 nm at neutral pH to more than several micrometres when passing below the isoelectric point. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that MS2 phages exhibit significant aggregation processes for pH &lt; or = pI leading to aggregate with sizes of few micrometres. This aggregation process can largely explain the decline in PFU counts. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: It is clear that viral aggregation can be a source of significant bias for PFU assays because in the presence of an aggregate the PFU count can be less than the sum of its constituent particles. Therefore, cautions should be taken in terms of conditions of storage (pH far from pI) to avoid such aggregation artefact.",M1
17922514,"Membrane subproteomic analysis of Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin.Mycobacterium bovis bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine has been known for a long time to prevent tuberculosis (TB) worldwide since 1921. Nonetheless, we know little about BCG membrane proteome. In the present study, we utilized alkaline incubation and Triton X-114-based methods to enrich BCG membrane proteins and subsequently digested them using proteolytic enzyme. The recovered peptides were further separated by 2-D LC and identified by ESI-MS/MS. As a result, total 474 proteins were identified, including 78 integral membrane proteins (IMPs). Notably, 18 BCG IMPs were described for the first time in mycobacterium. Further analysis of the 78 IMPs indicated that the theoretical molecular mass distribution of them ranged from 8.06 to 167.86 kDa and <e>pI</e> scores ranged from 4.40 to 11.60. Functional classification revealed that a large proportion of the identified IMPs (67.9%, 53 out of 78) were involved in cell wall and cell processes functional group. In conclusion, here we reported a comprehensive profile of the BCG membrane subproteome. The present investigation may allow the identification of some valuable vaccine and drug target candidates and thus provide basement for future designing of preventive, diagnostic, and therapeutic strategies against TB.",M1
17922506,"Carrier ampholytes for IEF, on their fortieth anniversary (1967-2007), brought to trial in court: the verdict.The present review summarizes the data accumulated in 1-year work, by exploring, via a 3-D methodology (Rotofor fractionation followed by CE-MS), all the narrow (2 pH unit wide) carrier ampholyte (CA) compounds for IEF, produced by three companies (Pharmacia with Pharmalyte and Ampholine, BioRad with Bio-Lyte and Serva with Servalyt). All species have been assessed by measuring the types of pH gradient produced, the total number of individual chemicals (with M(r) values) and isoforms and their focusing behavior ('good' or 'poor' ampholytes). Servalyt contains a grand total of 686 chemical entities and no less than 3899 isoforms; Pharmalyte 643 and 2211; Bio-Lyte 255 and 1192; Ampholine 294 and 1182, respectively. In terms of M(r) distribution, although all 2-pH-unit ranges start with the same low M(r) values (ca. 200) their upper limits are quite different. Thus, Pharmalyte reaches an upper M(r) value of 1179 (in the pH 4-6 range), versus 907 for Servalyt, 835 for Bio-Lyte and 893 for Ampholine. In general, in going towards the more alkaline pH intervals (e.g. pH 8-10) the molecular mass of carrier ampholytes (CAs) is reduced to as low as 491 (Bio-Lyte), indicating that the alkaline species are probably made with shorter oligoamines and are, in general, less substituted. All acidic pH intervals (up to pH 6-8) appear to be constituted by a very large proportion of well focusing species, indicating small values of DeltapK across their <e>pI</e>. Above pH 8, all brands of CAs worsen, the vast majority being unable to focus properly and sustain adequately the pH gradient. General guidelines are given for the synthesis of new alkaline species for improving the basic pH ranges.",M1
17854126,"Novel staining-free proteomic method for simultaneous identification of proteins and determination of their <e>pI</e> values by using low-molecular-mass pI markers.A new proteomic staining-free method for simultaneous identification of proteins and determination of their pI values by using low-molecular-mass pI markers is described. It is based on separation of proteins in gels by IEF in combination with mass spectrometric analysis of both peptides derived by in-gel digestion and low-molecular-mass pI markers extracted form the same piece excised from the gel. In this method, the pI markers are mixed with a protein mixture (a commercial malted barley protein extract) deposited on a gel and separated in a pH gradient. Color pI markers enable supervision of progress of focusing process. Several separated bands of the pI markers (including separated proteins) were excised and the pI markers were eluted from each gel piece by water/ethanol and identified by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS. The remaining carrier ampholytes were then washed out from gel pieces and proteins were in-gel digested with trypsin or chymotrypsin. Obtained peptides were measured by MALDI-TOF/TOF MS and proteins were identified via protein database search. This procedure allows omitting time-consuming protein staining and destaining procedures, which shortens the analysis time. For comparison, other IEF gels were stained with CBB R 250 and proteins in the gel bands were identified. Similarity of the results confirmed that our approach can give information about the correct pI values of particular proteins in complex samples at significantly shorter analysis times. This method can be very useful for identification of proteins and their post-translational modifications in prefractioned samples, where post-translational modifications (e.g., glycation) are frequent.",M1
17827531,"Enhanced secretion of adhesive recognition sequence containing hirudin III mutein in E. coli.It has been previously shown that Escherichia coli L-asparaginase II (L-ASP) signal peptide is capable of being utilized to direct extracellular secretion of hirudin III (HV3) in shake flask. In this study HV3 muteins R33G34D35(S36)-HV3 were generated by introduction of adhesive recognition sequence RGD(S) into the non-functional region of HV3. The resultant recombinants were cultivated on 30 l bioreactor scale using L-ASP signal peptide expression system and the optimized fed-batch cultivation was well established. After cultivation for approximately 11 h the secreted product accumulated up to approximately 1 g l(-1), which means 17-fold increase in productivity compared to initial expression in shake flask. N-terminal analysis, <e>pI</e> measurement, and MALDI mass spectral analysis on mutein R33G34D35S36-HV3 confirmed the authenticity of the product. Compared to wild-type HV3 and R33G34D35HV3, the mutein R33G34D35S36-HV3 exhibits the improved pharmacological activity. Collectively, a novel secretion strategy using L-ASP signal peptide for the rapid, efficient and cost-effective production of HV3 mutein possessing improved pharmacological activity on bioreactor scale has been well established. Using this expression system downstream processing becomes very simple because secreted product is mature, soluble, active, and without N-terminal extension of Met, which is quite critical for most therapeutic protein to reduce the side effect in clinic use. Thus, it provides a promising alternative for extracellular production of other difficult-to-express protein for biopharmaceutical use.",M1
19351499,"[Effects of Hesperetin on cell activation and proliferation of murine T lymphocytes in vitro]AIM: The effect of Hesperetin (Hes) on activation and proliferation of murine T lymphocytes in vitro as well as its mechanism of action is investigated to provide a theory for developing an immunosuppressive agent. METHODS: The lymphocytes were cocultured with Concanavalin A (ConA) and Hes together. Fluorescence conjugated monoclonal antibodies and flow cytometry were used to detect the expression of CD69 of activated T lymphcytes in vitro in response to ConA. MTT test was used to estimate the effect of Hes on proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated by ConA and the toxic effect of Hes on lymphocytes. Proliferation of lymphocytes stimulated by ConA was detected by carboxyl fluorescein diacetate-succinimide ester (CFDA-SE) staining combined with flow cytometry, and the proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) was analyzed by means of ModFit software. RESULTS: The survival rate of lymphocytes shows that DMSO(0.2 mL/L)and Hes (25-75 micromol/L) had little side effect on murine lymphocytes in vitro; Hes can inhibit the activation and proliferation of T lymphocytes in response to ConA with noticed dosage-effect relation. CONCLUSION: Hes may has broad prospects to be developed as immunosuppressive drug through further studies.",M2
18582545,"Genotoxicity and cell death induced by tinidazole (TNZ).Tinidazole (TNZ), a second-generation 5-nitroimidazole compound chemically related to metronidazole (MTZ), has been widely used throughout Europe and developing countries for the treatment of amoebic and parasitic infections. Despite TNZ's increasing use in therapeutics, scarce experimental reports are available in literature on its potential genotoxicity in human cells. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to achieve a precise characterization of the cytotoxic and genotoxic activities of this nitroimidazole in cultured human lymphocytes at therapeutic concentrations (0.1, 1, 10 and 50 microg/ml of culture) and evaluate the possible cell death mechanism associated with it. The endpoints analyzed included: mitotic index (MI), replication index (RI), sister chromatid exchange (SCE) and chromosomal aberrations (CA). A significant decrease (p&lt;0.0001) in MI as well as an increase in SCE (p&lt;0.0001) and CA (p&lt;0.0001) frequencies were observed. No modifications in RI were found. The results suggest a genotoxic and cytotoxic effect of TNZ related with cell death process. Therefore, we evaluated this mechanism by DNA fragmentation (laddering), fluorescence microscopy using acridine orange/ethidium bromide (AO/EB) staining and flow cytometry propidium iodide (<e>PI</e>). DNA extracts of TNZ-treated cells resulted in nucleosomal DNA ladder pattern after 48 h of cell treatment; meanwhile no differences were detected in untreated cells. This pattern correlated with the observed decrease in cellular viability (p&lt;0.05), morphological evidence of apoptosis and increase in the percentage of nuclei with hypodiploid DNA content of TNZ exposed cultures compared with control (p&lt;0.05). We concluded that TNZ is genotoxic, cytotoxic and is able to modulate cell death through apoptotic mechanisms in the experimental design employed.",M2
18366100,"Confirmation of the chromosome damaging effects of lamivudine in in vitro human peripheral blood lymphocytes.The aim of this study was to investigate genotoxic effects of lamivudine (an analogue of cytidine) using in vitro sister chromatid exchange (SCE), chromosome aberration (CA), and micronucleus (MN) tests in human peripheral lymphocytes. The cells were treated with 75, 100, 125, and 150 microg/ml concentrations of lamivudine (roughly 30-60 times higher than plasma levels achieved in patients receiving this drug) for two (24- and 48-hr) treatment periods. Lamivudine induced SCEs at the highest concentration (150 microg/ml) in the 24-hr treatment, and at 125 and 150 microg/ml in the 48-hr treatment, when compared to the solvent control. During both treatment periods, structural chromosome aberrations were significantly increased at 100, 125, and 150 microg/ml lamivudine concentrations. However, the increases of SCEs (22%) and CAs (50%) were weak. In addition, lamivudine reduced both the proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) and the mitotic index (MI) significantly at all concentrations for the two treatment periods. The MI was reduced by lamivudine in a dose-dependent manner during both the 24- and 48-hr treatment periods. In contrast, the PI was reduced by lamivudine only during the 48-hr treatment period. A weak but significant increase in MN formation was observed following lamivudine treatment at 100, 125, and 150 microg/ml for 48 hr, but no significant increase in micronuclei were observed following 24-hr treatment. In conclusion, lamivudine has a weak genotoxic effect at elevated doses on human peripheral lymphocytes.",M2
17719643,"Cytogenetics of uveal melanoma: a 7-year clinical experience.PURPOSE: Chromosome 3 loss and chromosome 8 gains in uveal melanoma are associated with metastatic death. Since 1999, we have offered cytogenetic analysis to patients treated by local resection or enucleation. This study correlated our cytogenetic results with clinical and histologic predictors and disease-specific mortality. DESIGN: Nonrandomized case series. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred fifty-six patients with uveal melanoma with data on chromosome 3 and chromosome 8. METHODS: Tumor diameter was measured by echography. Cell type, presence of closed connective tissue loops, and mitotic rate were determined histopathologically. Fluorescence in-situ hybridization was performed using centromeric probes for chromosomes 3 and 8 and for c-myc. Patients were flagged at the National Health Service Cancer Registry, which notified us of any deaths. Statistics included Cox multivariate analysis and Kaplan-Meier analysis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Disease-specific mortality, according to clinical, histologic and cytogenetic features as well as correlation between cytogenetic variables and other mortality predictors, including a predictive index. RESULTS: The patients had a mean age of 61.9 years. The tumors showed no cytogenetic abnormalities of chromosomes 3 or 8 in 42%, chromosome 8 gains in 11%, monosomy 3 in 21%, and both abnormalities in 27%. These correlated with ciliary body involvement (P&lt;0.001), extraocular spread (P = 0.007), large basal tumor diameter (P&lt;0.001), epithelioid cellularity (P&lt;0.001), closed connective tissue loops (P&lt;0.001), and mitotic rate exceeding 4/40 high power fields (P&lt;0.001). By the study close, 76 patients had died (67 from metastasis). Cox multivariate analysis showed the most significant factors to be basal tumor diameter (P&lt;0.001), monosomy 3 (P&lt;0.001), and epithelioid cellularity (P = 0.004). A predictive index (<e>PI</e>) was derived from these variables. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed that 5-year metastatic death rates ranged from 0% in 84 patients with low-grade melanoma (PI&lt;19) to 66% in 100 patients with high-grade tumor (PI&gt;26; 95% confidence interval, 53%-80%). CONCLUSION: Cytogenetic analysis of chromosomes 3 and 8 enhances prediction of disease-specific mortality after treatment of uveal melanoma but must be interpreted together with tumor diameter and cell type.",M2
17603792,"In vitro evaluation of the genotoxicity of acetamiprid in human peripheral blood lymphocytes.Acetamiprid, a neonicotinoid insecticide, is commonly used both in agriculture and domestic areas against a wide range of insects. The potential genotoxicity of a commercial formulation of acetamiprid (Mosetam 20 SP, containing 20% acetamiprid as the active ingredient) on human peripheral blood lymphocytes was examined in vitro by sister chromatid exchange (SCE), chromosomal aberrations (CAs), and micronucleus tests. Cells were treated with 25, 30, 35, and 40 mug/ml of acetamiprid for 24 and 48 hr. Acetamiprid induced SCEs and CAs significantly at all concentrations and treatment times and micronucleus formation was significantly induced at 30, 35, and 40 mug/ml of acetamiprid as compared with both the control and solvent control. Acetamiprid decreased the proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) at the two highest concentrations (35 and 40 mug/ml) for the 24-hr treatment period and only at the highest concentration (40 mug/ml) for the 48-hr treatment period when compared with the control and solvent control. Peripheral lymphocytes exposed to all concentrations of acetamiprid showed significant decreases in mitotic index (MI) and nuclear division index (NDI) for both treatment periods when compared with both the control and solvent control. Furthermore, acetamiprid decreased the MI in both treatment periods, and the NDI only in the 24-hr treatment period to the same extent as the positive control, mitomycin C (MMC). This study presents the first in vitro evidence for the genotoxicity of a commercial formulation of acetamiprid in human peripheral lymphocytes.",M2
17523292,"The relationship between MIB-1 proliferative activity and mitotic index in gastrointestinal stromal tumors.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GIST) are mesenchymal tumors originating from the gastrointestinal canal wall. Although a number of studies are performed concerning prognostic factors, no indicators of recurrence or metastasis could be established. In this study we assessed the prognostic value of MIB-1 proliferative index (<e>PI</e>) in GIST, and whether there was a relationship to any other clinicopathological findings. METHODOLOGY: In the study 37 patients with GIST diagnosis were included. The cases were classified as low, intermediate, and high risk groups according to tumor size and mitotic activity. The average PI of 10% in high risk group was set as the cut-off value. RESULTS: Of all the cases, those with a MIB-1 PI over the cut-off value had a significantly shorter survival (Log-rank test, p &lt; 0.05). Likewise cases with small bowel tumors with a MIB-1 PI over the cut-off value had a significantly shorter survival (Log-rank test, p &lt; 0.05). A statistically significant negative correlation was found between presence of necrosis and survival using McPearson correlation test (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: MIB-1 PI and presence of necrosis are possible indicators of prognosis especially in GIST cases of the small bowel.",M2
16540741,"Proliferation (MIB-1 expression) in oligodendrogliomas: assessment of quantitative methods and prognostic significance.Expression of to nuclear antigen Ki-67 (MIB-1) has been linked to proliferative activity and prognosis in a variety of tumors. The authors assessed three techniques for quantitating MIB-1 (expression in oligodendrogliomas, correlating results with mitotic activity and prognosis. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded sections of 38 oligodendrogliomas were immunostained using monoclonal MIB-l. Proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) was quantitated by visual estimation, CAS-200, and AC1S image analysis. MIB-1 expression and mitotic count were correlated with overall survival and recurrence (disease-free survival), defined clinically and radiographically as new tumor growth. Mean follow-up was 54 months (range 1-276). Mean PI quantitated by the three methods was statistically similar (Visual 10.5%, CAS-200, 12.2%, CAIS 11.2%). PI results by all three techniques correlated significantly with each other; visual and CAS-200 PI correlated with mitotic index. Overall and disease-free survivals were similar for patients with PIs above and below the mean by both image cytometric assays; visually estimated PIs below the mean, versus above the mean, correlated with improved disease-free survival. The authors show a significant correlation between MIB-1 PI using the visual method and recurrence in patients with oligodendrogliomas. The objectivity and speed of the image analysis systems make them an attractive alternative to visual estimation, and larger series should be analyzed for prognostic value.",M2

Sister chromatid exchange, the mitotic index and the cell proliferation index were determined for three experimental concentrations of Apitol (0.001, 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml). All concentrations significantly (p &lt; 0.001) increased the mitotic index (MI = 7.35+/-0.18%, 8.31+/-0.20% and 12.33+/-0.25%, respectively), the proliferative index (<e>PI</e> = 1.83+/-0.01, 1.84+/-0.01 and 1.88+/-0.02, respectively) and the frequency of sister chromatid exchange (SCE = 8.19+/-1.81, 8.78+/-1.80 and 13.46+/-1.88, respectively), suggesting that cymiazole hydrochloride has genotoxic potential.",M2
15699488,"CD4+ T cell proliferation in response to GAD and proinsulin in healthy, pre-diabetic, and diabetic donors.The ability to measure proliferation of autoantigen-specific T cells is critical for the evaluation of cellular immune function. Using a novel, sensitive, CFSE-based assay, we were able to directly quantitate autoantigen-specific CD4(+) T cell proliferation. However, peripheral blood cells from healthy, pre-diabetic and diabetic donors exhibited overlap in responses to glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD65) and proinsulin (<e>PI</e>). This indicates that autoantigen-induced CD4(+) T cell proliferation in a functionally complex cell population may not discriminate disease in the general population. Clear discrimination was found between diabetic and healthy sibs, suggesting the need to standardize the genetic and environmental background. In addition, the ability of the CFSE assay to allow analysis of the phenotype and function of autoantigen-responsive T cells may improve discrimination.",M2
15085740,"Grading follicular lymphoma on fine needle aspiration specimens. Comparison with proliferative index by DNA image analysis and Ki-67 labeling index.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether follicular lymphoma (FL) can be graded on fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsies by determining the percentage of centroblasts in the neoplastic follicles on the smears. STUDY DESIGN: Eighty-nine cases of histologically confirmed cases of FL, including 31 grade 1, 46 grade 2 and 12 grade 3, were evaluated. Proliferative index (<e>PI</e>) by DNA image analysis (DIA) and Ki-67 labeling index (LI) were obtained on all cases. A minimum of 200 cells were counted per case (range, 200-800 cells) at 40x magnification, and the number of large cells (centroblasts) was expressed as a percentage of the total number of cells counted within the follicles. RESULTS: The percentage of centroblasts in the follicular aggregates was 9.7 +/- 2.9% in grade 1 FLs, 24.7 +/- 5.6% in grade 2 and 48.4 +/- 7.5% in grade 3. These differences were significant (P &lt; .05). DNA image analysis of PI and Ki-67 LI differed significantly between grade 1 FLs and grade 2 and 3 FLs (P &lt; .05), but there were no significant differences between grade 2 and 3 FLs. CONCLUSION: Determining the percentage of centroblasts in the follicular aggregates on FNA specimens is a good method of grading FLs. Using the percentage of centroblasts per follicular structure, FL grades 1, 2 and 3 were adequately distinguished. PI by DIA and Ki-67 LI clearly distinguished FL grade 1 from FL grades 2 and 3; however, it did not clearly distinguish between grades 2 and 3.",M2
15040672,"Mitotic responses to extracts of miracidia and cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni in the amebocyte-producing organ of the snail intermediate host Biomphalaria glabrata.Suspensions of miracidia and cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni were subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles and then injected into resistant Salvador strain Biomphalaria glabrata snails. A pronounced increase in the number of mitotic figures, relative to uninjected, sham-injected, or diluent (water)-injected controls, was observed in the amebocyte-producing organ (APO) at 3 days postinjection (<e>PI</e>). After centrifugation of miracidia freeze-thaw extract (FTE), the resulting supernatant (FTS) and pellet possessed equal stimulatory activity that was approximately half that seen with FTE. Ultracentrifugation of miracidia FTS resulted in a supernatant that retained full activity, indicating a soluble molecule. Heat treatment of miracidia FTE reduced but did not eliminate activity, suggesting a nonprotein active component. Concentration or dilution of FTS by a factor of 10 gave a nonlinear dose-response relationship. Susceptible NIH albino snails injected with miracidia FTE had increased mitotic activity in the APO, which was much less than that seen in Salvador snails, whereas injection of miracidia FTE into Helisoma duryi had no discernable effect. Measurement of mitotic activity as a function of time PI showed no increase in numbers of mitotic figures in the APO at 18 hr but a large increase at 24 hr PI. Mitotic activity returned to preinjection levels by 96 hr PI, although a subsequent increase occurred at 120 hr PI.",M2
15032075,"Cell kinetics analysis in stage I endometrial carcinoma as determined by image cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Correlation with clinicopathologic characteristics.OBJECTIVE: To test the significance of various proliferative indices in endometrial carcinoma (EC) since previous investigations failed to yield consistent results that would establish them as factors of clinical importance. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy patients with EC were evaluated for various proliferative indices (mitotic index, Ki-67 index, argyrophilic nucleolar organizer (AgNOR) number and area per nucleus, and p53 protein expression) in relation to image cytometry (nuclear area, diameter and roundness) and standard clinicopathologic features (age, histologic type and grade, and depth of invasion). We also tested the proliferation index (<e>PI</e>), which combines the Ki-67 index and AgNOR area in Ki-67-positive nuclei. Slides from each case were double stained for Ki-67 antigen and AgNOR proteins for this purpose. RESULTS: Mitotic counts were significantly higher in papillary-serous (vs. endometrioid) tumors (P = .0001), high grade (vs. low grade) tumors (P = .0001), deeply invasive (P = .017) and p53-positive tumors (P = .017). AgNOR counts correlated only with age (higher in older women, P = .002), while the PI correlated with mitotic counts (P = 0.28) and marginally with depth of invasion (P = .06). Morphometric variables were associated just with histologic type and grade. p53 Protein was expressed exclusively in invasive tumors and was related strongly to histologic type (P = .0029) and grade (P = .0001). CONCLUSION: Our data reestablish the value of classic histopathologic features (mitotic index, histologic type and grade) as the most important tools for EC evaluation. In addition, we suggest that p53 immunostaining may be used for predicting aggressive behavior in EC.",M2
12443730,"Proliferative activity of canine mast cell tumours evaluated by bromodeoxyuridine incorporation and Ki-67 expression.The proliferative activity of 91 canine mast cell tumours was assessed on the basis of the Ki-67 positive index (Ki-67 <e>PI</e>) and mitotic index (MI) and, in 15 cases, also by the labelling index of bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU; an analogue of tritiated thymidine) incorporated in vivo into S-phase cells. BrdU and Ki-67 were detected immunohistochemically. The tumours were graded histologically (I, II or III). The BrdU labelling index (BrdU LI) tended to increase as the grade became higher. In terms of the mean values of Ki-67 PI, significant differences were found between histological tumour grades I and II (P &lt; 0.01) and between grades II and III (P &lt; 0.01). In terms of mean MI, grades I and II were found to differ significantly (P &lt; 0.05). With Spearman rank correlation coefficient and linear regression analysis, the BrdU LI and Ki-67 PI showed a highly significant correlation. This strong correlation indicated that Ki-67 was, like BrdU, a useful marker for proliferative potential in canine mast cell tumours; moreover, its use did not require the prior administration of any reagent to the live animal.",M2
12395897,"Elevated (&gt; or = 10%) MIB-1 proliferative index correlates with poor outcome in gastric stromal tumor patients: a study of 35 cases.Mitotic activity and tumor size are currently regarded as the most powerful prognostic indicators for patients with gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST). This retrospective study evaluated the prognostic accuracy of MIB-1 proliferative index (<e>PI</e>) in combination with these two indicators in 35 GIST patients. Within a high-risk group, determined initially by tumor size and mitotic count, overall survival was significantly shorter for patients whose tumors had PI &gt; or = 10% MIB-1 positive cells. When tumor location (gastric versus small intestine) was taken into account, a combination of tumor size, mitotic count, and PI &gt; or = 10% identified a subgroup of patients with significantly shorter survival for gastric (but not small intestinal) GIST. Based on our results, MIB-1 immunostaining, when used in combination with tumor size and mitotic count, appears to be a powerful tool for identifying patients, especially those with gastric tumors, at high risk of recurrence and early tumor-related death.",M2
12208106,"Proliferation activity in oral and cutaneous canine melanocytic tumours: correlation with histological parameters, location, and clinical behaviour.A total of 62 canine melanocytic tumours (10 melanocytomas and 52 primary malignant melanomas) were investigated to compare the accuracy of prognosis provided by MIB-1 proliferation index (MIB-1-<e>PI</e>) with classical histological criteria and location. MIB-1-PI was assessed by means of quantitative image analysis of sections immunostained with MIB-1 monoclonal antibody. Tumour location, histological cell type, stromal or lymphatic vessel invasion, maximum tumour thickness, and presence of inflammation or necrosis were recorded for each case. Thirty-eight dogs were submitted to a 1-year follow-up and the clinical outcome of the disease determined. MIB-1-PI in melanocytomas differed significantly from that detected in primary malignant melanomas (P=0.0001). A significant difference in MIB-1-PI was revealed between oral and cutaneous malignant melanomas (P=0.015), and between presence and absence of lymphatic vessel invasion (P=0.05). MIB-1-PI was not correlated with the other parameters. In univariate analysis, only tumour location (oral vs cutaneous), presence of lymphatic vessel invasion, and MIB-1-PI were associated with decreased overall survival (P=0.0001,P=0.0144, and P=0.0489, respectively). In conclusion, the results of our study confirm that the assessment of the MIB-1-PI may be of additional prognostic value for dogs with primary malignant melanomas.",M2
12197329,"DNA proliferative index as a marker in Iraqi aneuploid mammary carcinoma.This study estimated nuclear DNA ploidy and DNA proliferative indices (<e>PI</e>) in mammary ductal carcinomas from 120 Iraqi female patients. Of the examined specimens, 82.7% were aneuploid. DNA ploidy correlated significantly with histological grade and estrogen receptor content of the primary neoplasm. In aneuploid carcinomas, high PI showed a clearer association than aneuploidy with menopausal status and progesterone receptor content of the tumour. PI and percentage aneuploidy were higher in larger tumours; nodal status showed no association with these cytometric findings. Using PI, patients classified as having Auer aneuploid carcinomas can be divided into subsets with different tumour characteristics, thus improving the selection of those whose high risk, node-negative presentation makes them candidates for adjuvant systemic therapy.",M2
11725208,"Prognostic index for cutaneous melanoma: an analysis after follow-up of 2715 patients.In 2715 of 4524 patients with cutaneous melanoma treated surgically between 1968 and 1992 prognostic parameters were analysed for their value in predicting the occurrence of first progression. All of the 2715 patients developed only one invasive cutaneous melanoma during the follow-up period. Data concerning tumour thickness and mitotic index (maximum number of mitoses per square millimetre) of the cutaneous melanomas were determined. Between the characteristics age, tumour thickness, mitotic index, prognostic index (<e>PI</e>), sex, site of tumour, melanoma subtype and Clark level, the value of the mitotic index, as a prognostic parameter independent of tumour thickness, and the combination of mitotic index and tumour thickness were evaluated. The development of the first metastases was documented during a mean follow-up of 7.5 years. The majority of first recurrences occurred at regional lymph nodes and attempts have been made to identify those patients at risk of developing metastatic disease. The most effective parameters proved to be tumour thickness and mitotic index. For both parameters an independent prognostic influence was shown. The prognostic index, defined as the product of tumour thickness and number of mitoses per square millimetre, was re-evaluated and confirmed. A new modified prognostic index, defined as the product of square tumour thickness and mitotic index, proved to be even more useful for defining a subgroup of patients who are at risk of developing metastases and, therefore, might benefit from adjuvant therapy.",M2
11716041,"Computer-assisted cell morphometry and ploidy analysis in the assessment of thyroid follicular neoplasms.Conventional cytology cannot discriminate between benign and malignant follicular neoplasms. Our study evaluated the diagnostic role of computer-assisted image analysis in the presurgical assessment of thyroid follicular neoplasms. Fifty-eight patients (14 males, 44 females, age range, 45-75 years) who underwent surgery for cytologic diagnosis of thyroid follicular neoplasm were studied. All patients were first evaluated on clinical grounds and assigned a high/low suspicion of malignancy on the basis of gender, age, and nodule size. Cell image analysis was subsequently performed using a Cytometrica BYK Gulden microscope image processor on Feulgen-stained thyroid cytologic smears. A different population of 50 benign and 50 malignant, histologically evaluated nodules was studied in order to establish image analysis criteria suggestive of thyroid malignancy. Ploidy histogram, proliferation index (<e>PI</e>), nuclear area coefficient of variation (NACV), and anisocariosis ratio (AR) were studied. Thyroid cancer was diagnosed in 16 of 58 follicular neoplasms. Only 7 of these lesions were clinically suspicious (43.7%), whereas 14 of 16 (87.5%) malignant tumors were identified by image analysis. Positive and negative predictive values of image analysis versus clinical evaluation were 46.6% versus 30.4% and 92.8% versus 74.3%, respectively. The distribution of ploidy pattern was different in benign versus malignant follicular neoplasms (chi2 8.25, p = 0.016), malignant lesions showing an increased frequency of heteroclonal aneuploid DNA content (37.5% vs. 7.1%). Increased PI (mean +/- standard deviation (SD) = 11.3 +/- 5.7 vs. 7.1 +/- 6.1; p &lt; 0.01) and NACV (mean +/- SD = 25.28 +/- 1.89 vs. 20.14 0.91; p &lt; 0.01) levels were also observed in malignant follicular neoplasms. In conclusion, computer-assisted image analysis may profitably support clinical evaluation in the assessment of thyroid follicular neoplasms.",M2
11594503,"Comparative investigation of proliferation markers and their prognostic relevance in human meningiomas.OBJECTIVE: In human meningiomas, histology alone does not always predict the clinical outcome. Proliferative activity has therefore, become a potential tool in the histopathological grading of these tumors. The aim of this study was to investigate different Ki67 antibodies on meningiomas, to compare their proliferation indices (<e>PI</e>) and with other proliferation markers, such as S-phase fraction and mitotic activity, and to see whether these factors correlate with histological tumor grade. MATERIAL AND METHODS: The study included 43 meningiomas graded according to the criteria of WHO and Jääskeläinen et al. [1985, 1986]. Paraffin sections were used for immunohistochemical detection of Ki67 antigen and flow-cytometric determination of S-phase fraction. RESULTS: The PIs displayed an overall increase with increasing histological grade, however, the range of values for benign, atypical and anaplastic meningiomas were wide, resulting in considerable overlap between the groups. There were for the most significant correlations between the different proliferation markers. CONCLUSIONS: Ki67-equivalent antibodies and S phase fraction have no advantage over counting mitoses to assess the proliferative activity in meningiomas. Thus, mitotic activity justifies its role in meningioma grading.",M2
11593543,"Proliferative activity in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia and cervical carcinoma.OBJECTIVE: To detect the proliferative activity of cervical cells in cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) and cervical carcinoma by using proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunohistochemistry and mitotic index (MI). METHODS: Sixty specimens of CIN and cervical carcinoma from patients treated at the Obstetrics and Gynaecology Hospital, Shanghai Medical University, were analyzed. Among them, 8 were CIN I-II, 16 CIN III, 18 squamous carcinoma, and 18 adenocarcinoma. Serial 4 microns sections were prepared for haematoxylin and eosin (HE) staining to observe mitotic figure and pathological grading and for immunohistochemical staining of PACN which was performed by murine monoclonal antibody PC 10 (DAKO-PCNA). RESULTS: PCNA index (<e>PI</e>) and MI of CIN III and cervical carcinoma were significantly higher than those of normal cervix and CIN I-II. PI and MI increased with progress of disease. In addition, higher level of PI was correlated with higher level of MI, and higher levels of PI and MI were related with higher histological grade. However, there was no significant relationship between PI, MI, clinical staging, and lymph node metastases. CONCLUSION: PCNA and mitotic figure are useful for evaluating proliferative activity in CIN and cervical carcinoma, and could be used to distinguish CIN III from CIN I-II and evaluate the malignant potential of tumour tissues.",M2
11489812,"Proliferation, apoptosis, and survival in high-level microsatellite instability sporadic colorectal cancer.Sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC) characterized by high-level DNA microsatellite instability (MSI-H) has a favorable prognosis. The reason for this MSI-H survival advantage is not known. The aim of this study was to correlate proliferation, apoptosis, and prognosis in CRC stratified by MSI status. The proliferative index (<e>PI</e>) was measured by immunohistochemical staining with the Ki-67 antibody in a selected series of 100 sporadic colorectal cancers classified according to the level of MSI as 31 MSI-H, 29 MSI-Low (MSI-L), and 40 microsatellite stable (MSS). The Ki-67 index was significantly higher in MSI-H cancers (P &lt; 0.0001) in which the PI was 90.1 +/- 1.2% (mean +/- SE) compared with 69.5 +/- 3.1% and 69.5 +/- 2.3% in MSI-L and MSS subgroups, respectively. There was a positive linear correlation between the apoptotic index (AI) and PI (r = 0.51; P &lt; 0.001), with MSI-H cancers demonstrating an increased AI:PI ratio indicative of a lower index of cell production. A high PI showed a trend toward predicting improved survival within MSI-H cancers (P = 0.09) but did not predict survival in MSI-L or MSS cancers. The AI was not associated with survival in any MSI subgroup. In conclusion, this is the first study to show that sporadic MSI-H cancers are characterized by a higher AI:PI ratio and increased proliferative activity compared with MSI-L and MSS cancers, and that an elevated PI may confer a survival advantage within the MSI-H subset.",M2
11045168,"[Importance of determining the propidium-iodide index of plasmacytes in multiple myeloma. II. Relation to disease extent and activity]The authors evaluated in a group of 50 patients with multiple myeloma (MM), examined when the diagnosis was established before onset of treatment, and in a group of 85 patients examined in different stages of MM the relationship of proliferative characteristics of myeloma plasmocytes assessed by means of the propidium-iodide index <e>PI</e>/CD38, PI/ UHKT  and PI/B-B4(CD138) with the progression,  performance status  and the activity of the disease. With the exception of a different value of the PI/CD38 index between stages 1 and 3 evaluated according to Durie-Salmon, in the whole group of patients no relationship was found with the progress of the disease. When evaluating the whole group the authors observed a difference between sub-stages A and B (i.e. between patients without and with a serious impairment of renal function) when using indexes PI/CD38 and PI/B-B4(CD138). Only in the whole group of 85 patients the authors found a significant relationship of all proliferation indexes (PI/CD38PI/ UHKT  and PI/B-B4) with the  performance status  according to ECOG score to or &gt; or = 3 vs. &lt; 3. In both groups there was a very close statistically significant relationship without the activity of the disease whichever of the three proliferation indexes was used. It was revealed that patients with the active but stable form of the disease have different PI/CD38 and PI/B-B4(CD138) indexes within the framework of the same stage of MM (stages 1 + 2 vs. 3). From the investigation ensues that examination of the PI proliferation index, in particular PI/B-B4(CD138) or possibly PI/CD38 using multiparametric flow cytometry is a valuable method extending hitherto used examination procedures in MM, and that it replaces adequately former autoradiographic and microscopic immunofluorescent techniques.",M2

It was revealed that the values of the PI index examined with the aid of different  identification  monoclonal antibodies did not differ significantly. The median and average value of the PI index was in the whole group for PI/CD38 2.3 and 2.3%, for PI  UHKT  1.8 and 1.8% and for PI/B-B4(CD138) 2.2 and 2.4%. In the group of patients examined at the time when the diagnosis of MM was established before chemotherapy the median and average value of the PI/CD38 index was 2.0 and 2.2%, PI/ UHKT  was 1.5 and 1.6%, PI/B-B4 (CD138) 2.6 and 2.5%. In the two analyzed groups no statistically significant correlations of PI/CD38,/ UHKT  and B-B4(CD138) index were found with the number of granulocytes, thrombocytes, immunochemical type and the value of the serum M-component, and levels of S-beta 2 microglobulin, S-urea, S-creatinine, S-calcium, and S-lactic dehydrogenase. A significant positive correlation was found in both groups with the level of S-thymidine kinase, in the whole group of indexes PI/CD38 and PI/B-B4(CD138) with the severity of anaemia, index PI/CD38 correlated with S-albumin and index PI/B-B4(CD138) with the percentage ratio of plasmocytes in bone marrow.

10944075,"Evaluation of genotoxic and cytotoxic properties of pesticides employed in Italian agricultural practices.In a program coordinated by the Italian Ministry of Works, we tested in vitro four pesticides widely employed in a developed agricultural region of central Italy. The four commercial agents were chosen on the basis of their diffusion in agricultural practice, knowledge of their active principle(s), and scant availability of data concerning their toxic and genotoxic activity. The agents were Cirtoxin, Decis, Tramat Combi (TC), and Lasso Micromix (LM). All substances were tested in three in vitro systems: Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells, a metabolically competent hamster cell line (Chinese hamster epithelial liver; CHEL), and root tips of Vicia faba (VF). The cytotoxic and genotoxic end points challenged were micronuclei and root tip length (RTL) in VF and mitotic index (MI), proliferation index (<e>PI</e>), cell survival (CS), cell growth (CG), cell cycle length (CCL), sister chromatid exchanges, chromosomal aberrations, and single-cell gel electrophoresis, or comet assay, in CHEL and CHO cells. Tested doses ranged from the field dose up to 200x the field dose to take into account accumulation effects. On the whole, tested agents appear to induce genotoxic damage only at subtoxic or toxic doses, indicating a low clastogenic risk. MI, PI, CS, CG, RTL, and CCL appear to be the less sensitive end points, showing no effects in the presence of a clear positive response in some or all of the other tests. Using cytogenetic tests, we obtained positive results for TC and LM treatments in CHO but not in CHEL cells. These data could be accounted for by postulating a detoxifying activity exerted by this cell line. However, cytogenetic end points appear to be more sensitive than those referring to cytotoxicity.",M2
10882892,"In vitro micronucleus assay with Chinese hamster V79 cells - results of a collaborative study with in situ exposure to 26 chemical substances.A collaborative study with 10 participating laboratories was conducted to evaluate a test protocol for the performance of the in vitro micronucleus (MN) test using the V79 cell line with one treatment and one sampling time only. A total of 26 coded substances were tested in this study for MN-inducing properties. Three substances were tested by all 10 laboratories and 23 substances were tested by three or four laboratories in parallel. Six aneugenic, 7 clastogenic and 6 non-genotoxic chemicals were uniformly recognised as such by all laboratories. Three chemicals were tested uniformly negative by three laboratories although also clastogenic properties have been reported for these substances. Another set of three clastogenic substances showed inconsistent results and one non-clastogenic substance was found to be positive by one out of three laboratories. Within the study, the applicability of the determination of a proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) as an internal cytotoxicity parameter in comparison with the determination of the mitotic index (MI) was also evaluated. Both parameters were found to be useful for the interpretation of the MN test result with regard to the control of cell cycle kinetics and the mode of action for MN induction. The MN test in vitro was found to be easy to perform and its results were mainly in accordance with results from chromosomal aberration tests in vitro.",M2
10746985,"Effect of normal and tumor factors on different phases of cell populations cycle.In the present experiments we studied the effect of extracts from intact liver (LE), ES2 tumor extract (TE), plasmas from intact mice (<e>PI</e>), and from tumor bearing animals (PT) on different phases of hepatocytes and renocytes cell cycles. C3HS 28-day-old male mice, standardized for periodicity analysis, were injected at 16:00 hours and killed every 4 hours during a circadian cycle at 20:00/04; 00:00/08; 04:00/12; 08:00/16; 12:00/20 and 16:00/24 (time of day/hours post treatment). Colchicine (2 microg/g) was injected 4 hours before killing them. Samples of livers and kidneys were processed for histology and mitotic index determinations. The results were expressed as colchicine arrested metaphases per 1000 nuclei. The TE, LE and PI had a promoting effect on the mitotic activity of hepatocytes during the first 12 hours post treatment. During the subsequent 12 hours, not only these treatments but also the PI had an inhibiting effect on the mitotic activity of the same cell population. Also the TE and the PT had a promoting effect on the mitotic activity of the renocytes during the first 12 hours while the effect of all treatments showed a clear inhibition of the mitotic activity studied during the last 12 hours. Taking into account the time elapsed between the injections and the measurements made in these light-dark synchronized animals, we conclude that the increase in mitotic index observed in those tissues stemmed from a reinitiation of cell-cycle traverse in a subpopulation of G2-arrested, noncycling cells.",M2
10679656,"Evaluation of cell proliferation, epidermal growth factor receptor, and bcl-2 immunoexpression as prognostic factors for patients with World Health Organization grade 2 oligodendroglioma.BACKGROUND: Prognostic factors in oligodendrogliomas are an area of controversy in neuropathology. Although grading and the study of some morphologic variables may be of value as prognostic parameters, the variability of postoperative disease free survival in patients with World Health Organization Grade 2 oligodendroglioma indicates that the biologic behavior of this entity remains unknown. The objective of the current study was to evaluate immunoexpression of the proliferation index (<e>PI</e>), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), and bcl-2 as prognostic factors in patients with Grade 2 oligodendroglioma. METHODS: In a series of 19 cases of pure Grade 2 oligodendroglioma, we assessed the mitotic count, labeling index for MIB-1 and PCNA, and immunoreactivity for EGFR and bcl-2 with semiquantitative parameters and compared these with postoperative disease free survival. Statistical analyses using the Cox-Mantel nonparametric test and Spearman correlation coefficient were used to evaluate the data. RESULTS: Disease free survival was significantly shorter when the MIB-1 PI was &gt; 5% (P = 0.0096) and the PCNA PI was &gt; 9% (P = 0.00011) and when mitoses were observed (P = 0.00004). The paired variables also were found to correlate: MIB-1 versus PCNA (P = 0.04), MIB-1 versus mitotic count (P = 0.0184), and PCNA versus mitotic count (P = 0.0079). In all cases, there was immunoreactivity for EGFR; conversely, all cases were negative for bcl-2 in the cells with an oligodendrocyte phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The PI was found to correlate with the postoperative disease free survival in patients with Grade 2 oligodendroglioma; therefore, the authors suggest a possible subdivision of Grade 2 oligodendrogliomas into two groups based on the mitotic count and PI.",M2
10660096,"N-acetylcysteine suppression of the proliferative index in the colon of patients with previous adenomatous colonic polyps.This investigation is part of an effort to develop chemoprevention for carcinogenesis of the large bowel. The agent investigated is N-acetylcysteine (NAC). We used as a predictive biomarker, the proliferative index (<e>PI</e>), in a short-term human study. Patients with previous adenomatous colonic polyps are a cohort with increased risk for colon cancer and an increased PI of colonic crypts. They were randomly assigned to an experimental group given 800 mg/day of NAC for 12 weeks or a placebo group. Using proliferative cell nuclear antigen immunostaining, the PI of colonic crypts was measured prior to and after the treatments. The PI of the NAC group was decreased significantly (P &lt; 0.02) while the placebo group showed no difference (P &gt; 0.45). Since this decrease in PI may be an indicator of decreased risk of colon cancer, more extensive studies of the potential of NAC as a chemopreventive agent for colon cancer appear warranted.",M2
10473991,"Evaluation of DNA ploidy combined with a cytometric proliferation index of imprints from core needle biopsies in prostate cancer.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate if DNA ploidy analysis with a proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) derived from DNA cytometry of imprints from core needle biopsies predicts disease progression in patients with prostate cancer. METHODS: Touch imprints were done on a consecutive series of core needle biopsies taken by the same urologist from 240 patients with suspected prostate cancer, 137 (46%) of whom were found to have prostate cancer and included in the study. Scattered cells to the right of the image cytometry (ICM) ploidy-establishing peak, the S-phase fraction, and those in the G2M area of the ICM DNA histograms, were counted in percent of the total number of tumor cells, this value being designated the ICM PI. Based on previous results in archival fine needle aspiration material, the following classification was used: DNA group I, diploid tumor with a low PI; DNA group II, diploid tumor with an intermediate PI and tetraploid tumor with a low or intermediate PI, and DNA group III, diploid or tetraploid tumor with high PI and all tumors with an aneuploid pattern. RESULTS: Correlation was found to exist between DNA groups I-III and Gleason score (GS) (p &lt; 0.0001), T-stage (p = 0.006), M-stage (p = 0.009) and disease progression (p &lt; 0.0001). Among the 39 patients who had curative treatment and GS 5-7, the progression-free survival rate was 100% in DNA group I, as compared with only 38% in DNA group II and 55% in DNA group III within the follow-up period (p = 0.008). CONCLUSION: DNA ploidy combined with a PI derived from image cytometry of imprints from core needle biopsies yields additional prognostic information in patients with GS 5-7. Diploid tumors with a low PI (DNA group I) are associated with a low risk of disease progression.",M2
10442686,"Assessment of the malignant potential of mitogen stimulated human Schwann cells.Human Schwann cells (SCs) can be isolated and expanded with mitogens using cell culture techniques. These cells have been demonstrated to promote axonal regrowth in both the central and peripheral nervous system. Primary rat SCs can be immortalized with long-term exposure to mitogens. Transplantation of these cells into an autogenic host sciatic nerve results in the formation of tumors. Human cells are, in general, relatively more resistant to malignant transformation, but any potential risk for inducing tumor after transplantation of SCs in humans must be excluded. In this study, the malignant potential of mitogen expanded human SCs injected into the sciatic nerve of immunodeficient mice was investigated. Human SCs were isolated from human peripheral nerves and placed in cell culture, expanded with mitogens (heregulin and forskolin) for many passages (0-6 times), and then injected within the sciatic nerve of Severe Combined Immunodeficient (SCID) rat or mice. As a positive control for tumor formation in this xenograft model, human glioma cells were also injected. The proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) of the human SCs gradually decreased with each passage in cell culture. SC purity remained stable until the 6th passage, and then decreased significantly for older passages, so that the cultures were over-grown with fibroblasts. The incidence for rat or human glioma cells to induce tumors was 100% and 92%, respectively. In contrast, there was no tumor induced by human primary or mitogen expanded SCs. Demyelination, remyelination and formation of connective sheath at the injection site were observed in some cases after injection of the human SCs. Thus, mitogen-expanded human SCs do not produce tumors when transplanted in vivo, which suggests that these cells are safe, and deserve further study towards their use in clinical transplantation.",M2
10430084,"Apoptotic and mitotic indices predict survival rates in lymph node-negative colon carcinomas.An imbalance between apoptosis and mitosis is believed to underlie colon cancer development and progression. These processes regulate the growth of normal and neoplastic epithelia, and in tumors, may confer prognostic information. To test this hypothesis, we determined apoptotic and mitotic indices (AI, MI) by morphology in H&amp;E sections of 154 lymph node-negative, sporadic colon carcinomas. The relationship of these indices to genetic (p53 and Bcl-2) and biological features (DNA ploidy and cell kinetics) and patient survival rates was determined. Tumor features were compared in proximal and distal tumors, given postulated differences in their pathogenesis. Bcl-2 and p53 proteins were examined using immunohistochemistry and DNA ploidy and proliferative indices (<e>PIs</e>) by flow cytometry. Tumor features were dichotomized for analysis of relapse-free survival and overall survival (OS) rates using a Cox proportional hazards model. Median patient follow-up was 8.8 years. The median AI and MI were 1.2% (0-7.6) and 0.40% (0-1.8), respectively, and did not differ by tumor site. AI correlated with histological grade (P = 0.03); MI correlated with PI (P = 0.02) and inversely with Bcl-2 in distal tumors (P = 0.02). p53 and Bcl-2 expression were detected in 52 and 53% of tumors, respectively. Distal tumor site was associated with aneuploidy (P = 0.001), p53 (P = 0.001), and PI &gt; 15% (P = 0.002). In a univariate analysis, colon cancers with high MIs (&gt;0.5%) had a poor prognosis (P = 0.04). Bcl-2 overexpression (&gt;20% + tumor cells) was associated with more favorable OS (P = 0.04). The association of ploidy and PI with outcome was of borderline significance for all tumors; however, diploidy predicted better survival in proximal cancers. In distal cancers, low AIs (&lt; or = 0.25%) and high MIs (&gt;0.5%) were adverse prognostic markers. After adjustment for other variables, an increased MI predicted shorter OS with a hazard ratio (HR) for death of 2.70; 95% confidence interval (CI) was 1.23-5.91 (P = 0.01). Expression of Bcl-2 was associated with more favorable OS (HR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.21-1.0; P = 0.06). In proximal cancers, Bcl-2 expression was the most important predictor of OS (HR, 0.17; 95% CI, 0.03-0.85; P = 0.03). In distal tumors, low AIs (HR, 3.33; 95% CI, 1.27-9.09; P = 0.01) and high MIs predicted poor survival. In conclusion, increased mitosis and low or absent Bcl-2 expression are significant risk factors for death in node-negative colon cancers, as are low rates of apoptosis in distal tumors. If validated prospectively, our results may identify patient subsets than can benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.",M2
10367777,"Smooth muscle cell hypertrophy versus hyperplasia in infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis.Infantile hypertrophic pyloric stenosis (IHPS) is characterized by hypertrophy of the pyloric muscle. It is not clearly understood whether pyloric muscle enlargement is due to hypertrophy (increase in cell size) or hyperplasia (increase in cell number). In the present study, we investigated proliferative activity as well as size and number of smooth muscle cells to understand the mechanism of pyloric muscle enlargement in IHPS. Full thickness muscle biopsy specimens were obtained from 18 IHPS patients at pyloromyotomy and from 11 age-matched controls. Formalin-fixed paraffin sections were immunostained with MAb MIB-1, which stains cells in the proliferating phase of the cell cycle. The proliferative index (<e>PI</e>) was calculated as the percentage of positive cell nuclei. Smooth muscle cell number per bundle and cell size were measured with an image analyzer. The mean PI in IHPS (9.6 +/- 5.7%) was significantly higher than that of controls (1.3 +/- 1.2%) (p &lt; 0.01). There was a significant inverse correlation between PI and age at operation. Smooth muscle cell number per bundle in IHPS (240.6 +/- 129.4) was significantly greater than that of the controls (134.1 +/- 49.8) (p &lt; 0.05). Smooth muscle cell size in IHPS (298.5 +/- 59.0 microm2) was also significantly greater than that of controls (154.3 +/- 21.5 microm2) (p &lt; 0.01). Our findings suggest that hypertrophy-and hyperplasia as well-play important roles in increasing pyloric smooth muscle mass in IHPS.",M2
10198156,"G2 restriction point within populations of hepatocytes and tongue keratinocytes in young, growing mice.The authors studied the effect of either extracts from liver (LE) or the malignant tumour ES2 (TE) or plasma from intact mice (<e>PI</e>) or tumour-bearing animals (PT) on the mitotic activity of the hepatocytes and tongue keratinocytes in young, growing C3H/s male mice (28+/-1 days old). Animals standardized for periodicity analysis were injected intraperitoneally with either TE, LE, PI, PT, or saline (S) at 16:00 h with 0.01 ml of sample/g of body weight and were then killed at (time of day/h post-injection) 20:00/04, 00:00/08, and 04:00/12. Colchicine (2 microg/g) was injected 4 h before death. Samples of the liver and tongue from each animal were processed for histology and assessment of mitotic index. The results were expressed as colchicine-arrested metaphases/1000 nuclei. The TE and LE stimulated the mitotic activity of hepatocytes and tongue keratinocytes. Taking into account the time elapsed between the injections and the measurements made in these light-dark synchronized animals, we conclude that the increase in mitotic index observed in those tissues stemmed from a reinitiation of cell-cycle traverse in a subpopulation of G2-arrested, noncycling cells.",M2
10023005,"Expression of proliferating cell nuclear antigen in follicular thyroid tumors: correlation with clinicopathological findings.The purpose of this study was to correlate proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining with clinicopathological findings in 60 follicular thyroid tumors. Mean proliferative index (<e>PI</e>) was significantly higher for carcinoma (73%) than microfollicular adenoma (19.6%) (p&lt;0.0001). For atypical and oncocytic adenomas, intermediate PI values (64% and 50%) correlated with size and cytological atypia but not with sex and age. PCNA immunostaining is of limited value for differential diagnosis of malignant and atypical tumors but could be useful for identification of actively growing atypical follicular thyroid nodules on fine needle aspiration biopsies.",M2
9826164,"DNA content and cell proliferation in giant congenital melanocytic naevi (GCMN). An analysis by image cytometry.GCMN may be precursors of melanoma, and it has been suggested that the presence of atypical foci could increase the risk of malignant transformation. In order to better define atypical GCMN, we analyzed DNA content and proliferative activity in 21 samples of GCMN, with (n=13) or without (n=8) cytologic atypia. Six benign acquired naevi (AN) and 6 malignant melanoma (MM) were used as controls. DNA content was determined with the CAS 200 image analyzer, and DNA histograms were classified according to the Auer classification. The proliferative indices (<e>PI</e>) were measured after Ki 67 immunostaining using the CAS 200 system. All AN and GCMN without atypia showed class I histograms (normal DNA content) and low PI (mean 1.9 and 2.1). Atypical GCMN showed in 10 cases an abnormal DNA content (class III or IV histograms) with low PI (mean 2.7), and in 3 cases a normal DNA content (class I histograms) with higher PI (mean 16.2). All MM displayed abnormal DNA content and high PI (mean 32.6). In conclusion, abnormal DNA content seems to correlate with cytologic atypia in GCMN. Atypical GCMN exhibit an overall pattern of DNA content and cell proliferation intermediate between non-atypical naevi and MM.",M2
9696289,"Different patterns of cell proliferation and death and oncogene expression in cutaneous malignant melanoma.Ninety-six cutaneous melanomas (CMs) were investigated aiming at finding differences, if any, among the main four clinicopathological types, for Bcl-2, c-myc and p53 protein expression, and for tumor cell proliferation and death indices. Proliferation was assessed by calculating the mitotic index (MI, number of mitoses) and the MIB1 labelling index (M-LI, number of MIB1+ nuclei), and tumor cell death by calculating the apoptotic index (AI, number of apoptoses) among 1000 tumor cells. CMs were subdivided into thin (&lt;1 mm) and intermediate thickness (1-4 mm) tumors. Bcl-2 expression did not significantly change among different types. c-myc Expression decreased especially in thicker superficial spreading (SSM) and lentigo maligna melanoma (LMM) types. p53 Expression was higher in nodular melanoma (NM) and in acral lentiginous melanoma(ALM), which also showed the highest degrees of proliferation. AI was significantly higher in thin rather than in intermediate thickness SSMs, LMMs and ALMs (8.4 vs. 2; 6.1 vs. 2.3, and 5.8 vs. 3.6, respectively). AI was low in thin (1.7) and intermediate thickness (1.9) NMs, which also showed high MI (3.9 and 4.5, respectively), and M-LI (16.7 and 2.9, respectively). Thin and intermediate thickness ALMs also showed high MI and M-LI (4.1 vs. 5.2 and 11.3 vs. 14.6, respectively). Bcl-2 is among genes which inhibit apoptotic death, whereas c-myc and p-53 genes promote this process. In CMs, no relation was found between Bcl-2 expression, MI, <e>PI</e>, and AI. All SSMs, LMMs, and ALMs with a high AI showed a high c-myc expression and were negative for p53. c-myc, Although highly expressed, did not promote a significant apoptotic death in NM type. Bc12, c-myc, and p53 were not equally expressed nor equally related to tumor cell turnover in all CMs, suggesting their different influence on the various types and stages, and the role of other factors in CM growth control.",M2
9673413,"Flow cytometric studies on the relationship between DNA content and clinicopathologic features of pancreatic cancers.The purpose of this study was to determine DNA (DI) and proliferation indices (<e>PI</e>) in 26 pancreatic and 10 ampulla of Vater carcinomas by flow cytometry using paraffin embedded tissue samples. Furthermore, we analysed the relationship between these parameters and the traditionally used prognostic parameters (type, stage and grade) of the tumor. Out of the 26 pancreas carcinomas 15 proved to be DNA diploid and 11 DNA aneuploid, while among the 10 ampulla of Vater tumors 7 DNA diploids and 3 DNA aneuploids were found. The PI-ces in both type of carcinomas were significantly higher than PI-ces in the surrounding nontumorous pancreatic tissue. The average of PI in aneuploid carcinomas significantly exceeded the one of diploid carcinomas. In group of grade III-IV tumors the ratio of aneuploids (59%), and the average of PI (11.59% +/- 5.27%) proved to be significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05, both) than in grade I-II group (21%, PI = 8.16% +/- 4.03%). Among the tumors falling into the T1 class the ratio of aneuploids (29%) and of tumors (29%) characterized by a PI &gt; 8% proved to be lower than among the tumors of T2-T3 class (46%, 62%). The ratio of aneuploids among cases with lymphnode positivity was higher (3/4), than among those without (8/22), the single case with distant metastasis was also found to be aneuploid. The results indicate a close correlation between the DNA ploidy and PI and the stage and grade of pancreatic cancers.",M2
9657495,"Nuclear multiparameter flow cytometric DNA analysis of human brain tumors: correlation of DNA content with tumor histology and clinical behavior.BACKGROUND: Using fresh surgical specimens of brain tumors to investigate cellular DNA content is uncommon. The aim of this study is to elucidate the relationship among cellular nuclear DNA content, tumor histology, and tumor clinical behavior of various tumors of the central nervous system. METHODS: Multiparameter flow cytometry (FACStar, Becton-Dickinson, San Jose, CA) was randomly applied to analyze 40 fresh surgical specimens from brain tumors. Histologically, there were 19 cases of benign tumors and 21 cases of malignant tumors. RESULTS: DNA distribution profiles in the benign tumors revealed 15 cases of diploidy and four cases of aneuploidy, while the malignant tumors had eight cases of diploidy and 13 cases of aneuploidy (p &lt; 0.01). The mean DNA index (DI) in benign tumors was 1.13 +/- 0.27 and in malignant tumors 1.43 +/- 0.48 (p &lt; 0.05). The mean proliferative index (<e>PI</e>) in benign tumors was 10.27 +/- 5.46% and 18.44 +/- 8.98% in malignant tumors (p &lt; 0.05). Clinically, 10 patients had postoperative recurrence. The PI in recurrent and nonrecurrent tumors was 17.83 +/- 11.13% and 13.20 +/- 7.19%, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). The 1-year cumulative survival rate in benign tumors was 78.9%, and 57.1% in malignant tumors (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Malignant tumors had a significantly higher incidence of aneuploid DNA histograms, a higher DNA index, and a higher proliferative index. Tumors with a high PI had a higher incidence of recurrence and a lower survival rate. Multiparameter DNA analysis by flow cytometry provides a valuable diagnostic aid for the histopathologic differentiation of human brain tumors.",M2
9505211,"Proliferative potentials of glioma cells and vascular components determined with monoclonal antibody MIB-1.Proliferative activity in 78 glioma specimens was assessed immunohistochemically by determining proliferating index of tumor cells (PTC-<e>PI</e>) and endothelial cells (PEC-PI) using the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody. The PTC-PI of anaplastic astrocytoma (9.0 +/- 5.8: mean +/- standard deviation) was significantly higher than that of astrocytoma (1.2 +/- 0.4, &lt; 0.01), and lower than that of glioblastoma multiforme (12.0 +/- 5.6, &lt; 0.05). We then compared PTC-PI values, patients' age and extent of tumor resection with the prognosis of patients with malignant glioma (both glioblastoma and anaplastic astrocytoma). Kaplan-Meier survival rate analysis demonstrated higher survival rates in patients with less than 8.0% of PTC-PI at 5 and 10 years (p &lt; 0.05). The mean age of patients who survived more than a year was lower than that of patients who died within a year (53.0 y.o., vs. 59.7 y.o., p &lt; 0.01). Total or subtotal resection of the tumor was more often performed in the former than latter patients (51% vs. 21%, p &lt; 0.01). These results suggested PTC-PI provides useful information which may allow better assessment of the biological behavior and clinical prognosis of glioma, in addition to histological grading, patients' age and extent of tumor resection. While the average PEC-PI value (3.3) was lower than that of PTC-PI (7.0), there was a significantly close relationship between PTC- and PEC values (p &lt; 0.01), providing an impetus to develop novel therapies directed toward suppression of microvascular regeneration.",M2
9183080,"MIB-1 proliferative index in parathyroid adenoma &amp; hyperplasia.A retrospective study on 22 cases of parathyroid adenoma, 9 cases of primary parathyroid hyperplasia and 14 specimens of normal suppressed glandular tissue was undertaken to determine the usefulness of proliferative index (<e>PI</e>) for discriminating adenoma from hyperplasia, as an adjunct to the existing histological criteria. PI was determined by avidin-biotin-complex immunostaining after high temperature microwave antigen retrieval in paraffin sections, using monoclonal MIB-1 antibody which detects paraffin resistant analogue of cell cycle-associated Ki-67 antigen. PI expressed as percentage positive cell nuclei, was 1.36 +/- 0.62 (range 0.04-2.72) in adenoma, 1.17 +/- 0.83 (0.02-1.98) in hyperplasia and 0.03 +/- 0.02 (0.00-0.06) in normal suppressed glandular tissue. While the difference between normal suppressed glandular tissue and adenoma and hyperplasia was significant (P &lt; 0.001), that between adenoma and hyperplasia was not. We conclude that although PI could distinguish between normal suppressed glandular tissue versus glands with primary hyperparathyroidism, it failed as an additional useful parameter for discriminating between adenoma and hyperplasia, both of which have low but similar proliferative activity.",M2
10846561,"Proliferating cell nuclear antigen expression in Wilms' tumor: a comparative study of pre- and post-chemotherapy specimens.A total of 36 Wilms' tumors were immunohistochemically analyzed for proliferative (proliferating cell nuclear antigen-labeling) index (<e>PI</e>) with special reference to the effect of preoperative chemotherapy on the proliferative potential of tumors and differences in PI according to the histologic components (epithelial, blastemal and stromal). The cases were divided into two groups according to the status of chemotherapy at the time of surgical removal of the tumors. In group I (n = 12, cases with pre-operative chemotherapy), the mean PI +/- s.d. values of epithelial, blastemal and stromal types were 19.5 (n = 1), 10.1 +/- 5.28 (n = 8), and 16.2 +/- 13.49 (n = 3), respectively, and in group II (n = 24, cases without preoperative chemotherapy), 45.2 +/- 15.41 (n = 3), 28.5 +/- 16.92 (n = 10), and 23.2 +/- 4.45 (n = 2), respectively. The cases with mixed histology in group II (n = 9) had comparable PI values for each histologic component. The mean PI +/- s.d. was 12.1 +/- 7.76 in group I and 31.9 +/- 15.95 in group II. The PI value of group II was significantly higher than that of group I (P &lt; 0.001). Alterations in the PI value following chemotherapy implied that the interpretation of tumor histology following chemotherapy should be more prudent because alteration of the PI, which reflects the proliferative potential of tumor cells, suggests modified biology of viable cells in pretreated cases as a consequence of chemotherapy.",M2

Treatment with NDMA caused inhibition of MI and PI which were more expressive in bovine lymphocytes. In addition, statistically significant heterogeneity of the first, second, and third metaphases between the treated and untreated cultures was found.

8532698,"Immunohistochemical staining and Southern blot hybridization for glutathione S-transferase <e>pi</e> in mammary infiltrating ductal carcinoma.Glutathione S-transferase pi, a drug-detoxifying isoenzyme of potential prognostic value for subsets of patients with mammary cancer, was studied by immunohistochemistry and Southern blot analysis in 58 infiltrating ductal carcinomas. The results were compared with the findings of six important clinicopathologic parameters. Cytoplasmic immunoreactivity for glutathione S-transferase pi was absent in 40%, 1+ in 26%, 2+ in 15%, and 3+ in 19% of the cases. There were no significant correlations between the level of immunostaining and patient age, tumor size, axillary lymph node status, nuclear pleomorphism, or tubule formation, but there was a trend with mitotic count (P = 0.06). Immunoreactivity was associated with histologic grade (P = 0.02) and inversely correlated with estrogen (P = 0.006) and progesterone (P = 0.02) receptor content. Ten percent of the cases showed modest levels of glutathione S-transferase pi gene amplification, but no significant correlations were observed between glutathione S-transferase pi amplification and any of the clinicopathologic parameters or level of immunostaining. The results indicate that increased immunohistochemical staining for glutathione S-transferase pi occurs in high-grade, estrogen and progesterone receptor-negative neoplasms. As glutathione S-transferase pi gene amplification appears unassociated with immunopositivity, other mechanisms are responsible for the production of this isoenzyme in infiltrating ductal carcinomas.",M2
7635453,"The proliferative activity in oral epithelial dysplasia analyzed by proliferating cell nuclear antigen immunostaining and argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region staining.The proliferative activity of leukoplakia without dysplastic change (LP), epithelial dysplasia (ED), and squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) in the oral mucosa was examined by means of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) immunostaining, silver-binding argyrophilic nucleolar organizer region (AgNOR) staining, and the frequency of mitotic figures. Significant differences in the labeling index of PCNA immunostaining (<e>PI</e>) and mitotic index (MI) were noted between LP and ED and between ED and SCC. The mean numbers of AgNORs (AI) significantly differed between ED and SCC. There was a significant positive correlation between PI and MI in samples of ED. However, there was no significant correlation between AI and other indexes. The number and the distribution of PCNA-positive cells in ED varied among samples. Five samples with higher PI and MI indexes than the mean values were selected from those of dysplasia based on the correlation between PI and MI. Their histological features symptomatic of oral ED as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO) Collaborating Centre in 1978, were investigated and compared with 10 samples with lower indexes. Histological findings, such as  loss of polarity of the basal cells,   an increased nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio,   cellular pleomorphism,  and  enlarged nucleoli,  were significant histological features of these five samples. This study showed that the four histological components described previously and the increased number of mitotic figures used as the index of proliferating activity were the main histological components related to severe ED of oral mucosa. They will provide a useful means of deciding the histopathological grade of oral ED.",M2
8116574,"Determination of proliferation index with MIB-1 in advanced ovarian cancer using quantitative image analysis.A new monoclonal antibody, MIB-1, reacts with the same epitope recognized by Ki-67. The authors investigated the feasibility of using image analysis to quantitate the MIB-1 staining (proliferation index [<e>PI</e>]) of epithelial ovarian cancers. The PI was determined in 50 advanced-stage primary ovarian cancers. Paraffin sections were immunostained with the MIB-1 monoclonal antibody, and the PI was calculated using a CAS 200 image analyzer. Among 36 stage III ovarian carcinomas, the median PI was 15.1%, compared with 18.9% in 14 stage IV cancers (P = .47). Based on exploratory methods, a cutoff point of 7% best dichotomized these patients into two prognostic groups. Of 39 patients whose cancers had a high MIB-1 expression (&gt; or = 7%), the median survival was 16.5 months, which differed significantly (P = .01) from the median survival of 33.2 months observed in the 11 patients whose tumors demonstrated low MIB-1 expression (&lt; 7%). Using MIB-1 as a binary variable, a strong correlation was found between overexpression of c-erbB-2 (2+ and 3+) and MIB-1 &gt; or = 7% (P = .001). No relationship was found between PI and histologic grade. Further studies are warranted to investigate the relationship between MIB-1, PI expression, and other known clinicopathologic and genetic features of early- and late-stage ovarian cancer.",M2
2240165,"Flow cytometric analysis of the mechanism of methylmercury cytotoxicity.Flow cytometric analysis of murine erythroleukemic cells (MELC) exposed in vitro to 2.5 to 7.5 mumol/l (micromolar) methylmercury (MeHg) reveals a dose-dependent decrease in the rate of DNA synthesis (rate of passage through the S phase of the cell cycle), manifested as the accumulation of most of the cells in the S phase, and a modest accumulation of cells in the G2/M phase of the cycle. Light microscopy reveals a progressive increase in chromosomal damage (condensation, pulverization). At or above 10 mumol/l MeHg, progression through all the phases of the cell cycle is blocked and mitotic cells are arrested irreversibly in anaphase, with most exhibiting arrangement of chromosomes in a wreathlike ring formation. Also the cells exhibit both nuclear propidium iodide (<e>PI</e>) fluorescence (indicative of loss of viability) and concurrent cytoplasmic carboxyfluorescein (CF) fluorescence (viable cells exhibit CF fluorescence and exclude PI). In addition, there is a dose-dependent increase in cellular refractive index (90 degrees light scatter), an apparent decrease in cell volume (axial light loss), and progressive resistance to detergent (NP-40)-mediated cytolysis. Resistance to detergent-mediated cytolysis is indicative of fixation (protein denaturation, cross-linking, and so on) of the plasma membrane/cytoplasm complex. Our findings indicate that DNA synthesis is the primary target of MeHg cytotoxicity and that apparent targets and degree of cytotoxicity are a complex function of dose.",M2

3132355,"Flow cytometric discrimination of mitotic nuclei by right-angle light scatter.Flow cytometry has been used to demonstrate alterations in protein, RNA, and DNA content of cells as they traverse the cell cycle. Employing fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) to stain protein and propidium iodide (<e>PI</e>) to stain nucleic acids, multiple regions within the G1 and G2 phases of the cell cycle, in addition to the M phase, can be distinguished. In this study, cytograms of the 90 degree light scatter signal vs. PI fluorescence were remarkably similar to those of FITC fluorescence vs. PI fluorescence, suggesting a relationship between 90 degree light scatter and protein content. M-phase nuclei can be distinguished from G2-phase nuclei on cytograms of 90 degree light scatter vs. PI fluorescence. However, the percentage of mitotic nuclei obtained by this technique is less than that found by light microscopic analysis. Flow cytometric parameters of nuclei prepared by nonionic detergent (NP40) lysis in Dulbecco's PBS, Vindelov's buffer, or Pollack's hypotonic EDTA/Tris buffer were compared. The best resolution of mitotic nuclei was obtained in Pollack's buffer.

The PI used in this study was first reported from Munich, West Germany, and is calculated from standard histologic sections by multiplying the MM thickness in millimeters (Breslow method) by the number of MM mitoses per square millimeter. A PI value of less than 19 versus greater than or equal to 19 was found to be a significant and independent prognostic variable for Stage I MM when compared with seven other predictive variables (including Breslow thickness). These PI intervals identified a subgroup of patients with MM of intermediate thicknesses (1.50-3.49 mm) whose significantly worse survival would not have been anticipated if prognosis were determined by Breslow thickness alone. For example, patients with MM 1.50 to 2.49 mm thick have a 5-year survival rate of 84.1% determined by Breslow thickness alone; however, among these patients exists a subgroup with PI greater than or equal to 19 whose survival rate is only 57.6%.

3021318,"Flow cytometric analysis of nephroblastomas and related neoplasms.A total of 59 cases of nephroblastoma and related neoplasms were studied by flow cytometry of paraffin-embedded tissue. According to clinical prognosis, cases were subdivided into three groups: Group 1 (low risk) consisted of congenital mesoblastic nephroma (n = 13) and cystic, partially differentiated nephroblastoma (n = 2). Group 2 (intermediate risk) comprised the various subtypes of  typical  nephroblastoma (n = 24) including cases of fetal rhabdomyomatous nephroblastoma (n = 4). In group 3 (high risk) there were cases of anaplastic nephroblastoma (n = 3), clear cell sarcoma of the kidney or  bone metastasizing renal tumor of childhood  (n = 7), and malignant rhabdoid tumor of the kidney (n = 6). The three clinically different groups of tumors also varied in the proportion of cases with aneuploid tumor DNA stemlines, in S-phase fractions, and in proliferation indices (<e>PI</e> = S + G2 + M). Group 1 was generally characterized by a small number of cases with aneuploid tumor DNA stemlines and low values for S-phase fractions and PI, whereas Group 3 showed the largest number of cases with aneuploid tumor DNA stemlines and high values for S-phase fractions and PI. Group 2 was in between. It is concluded that flow cytometry on paraffin-embedded tissue from pediatric tumors may be a useful adjunct in determining prognosis, and that the subdivision of nephroblastomas and related neoplasms into three prognostically different groups is warranted.",M2

At a minimum follow-up of 60 months the highest relapse free survival was observed in patients whose tumours had ER greater than 0.30 fmole/micrograms DNA (ER rich) and PI less than 5% (PI low). Subclassification of tumors in euploid and aneuploid groups gave no prognostic information. When examined by axillary node status (no nodal involvement - involved nodes) both ER and PI contributed prognostic information.

3900213,"Recombinant interleukin 2 stimulates in vivo proliferation of adoptively transferred lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells.We previously reported that the adoptive transfer of lymphokine-activated killer (LAK) cells plus repetitive injections of recombinant interleukin 2 (IL 2) produced a marked reduction in established pulmonary metastases from a variety of murine sarcomas. The requirement for the exogenous administration of IL 2 prompted a subsequent examination of the role of IL 2 in the in vivo function of transferred LAK cells. The in vivo proliferation and migration patterns of lymphoid cells in C57BL/6 mice were examined after i.v. transfer of LAK cells alone, i.p. injection of IL 2 alone, or the combination of LAK cells and IL 2. A model for in vivo labeling of the DNA of dividing cells was used in which mice were injected with 5-[125I]-iodo-2'-deoxyuridine (125IUdR) and, 20 hr later, their tissues were removed and were counted in a gamma analyzer. A proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) was calculated by dividing the mean cpm of organs of experimentally treated mice by the mean cpm of organs of control mice. In animals given LAK cells alone, the lungs and liver demonstrated little if any uptake of 125IUdR above saline-treated controls (PI = 2.5 and 0.8, respectively, on day 5), whereas the same organs of mice receiving 6000 U of IL 2 alone displayed higher radiolabel incorporation (PI = 7.1 and 5.9, respectively). When mice were given LAK cells plus 6000 U of IL 2, their tissues showed an additional increase in 125IUdR uptake. In the spleen, kidneys, and mesenteric lymph nodes, IL 2 treatment alone (6000 U) produced elevated PI values that were not, however, additionally increased if LAK cells were also administered. To separate the stimulatory effects of IL 2 on host lymphocyte proliferation from similar IL 2 effects on injected LAK cells, these studies were repeated in mice immunosuppressed by 500 rad total body irradiation. Pre-irradiation of the host sufficiently reduced endogenous lymphoid expansion stimulated by IL 2 so as to allow the demonstration that IL 2 also induced the proliferation of the transferred LAK cells. A variety of studies confirmed that the injected LAK cells were actively proliferating in tissues in vivo under the influence of IL 2. Substitution of  normal  LAK cells with fresh and cultured (without IL 2) splenocytes, or irradiated LAK cells did not result in increased 125IUdR uptake in tissues. Histologic studies corroborated the findings of the 125IUdR incorporation assays and revealed extensive lymphoid proliferation in irradiated mice receiving LAK cells plus IL 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)",M2

7905542,"Analysis of relative proliferation rates of Wilms' tumor components using proliferating cell nuclear antigen and MIB-1 (Ki-67 equivalent antigen) immunostaining and assessment of mitotic index.BACKGROUND: Flow-cytometric analysis of proliferation index (<e>PI</e>) has potential use in predicting prognosis in malignancy. Its relevance to heterogeneous tumors has not been conclusively studied. In nephroblastoma, where the epithelial components are considered more differentiated than others, potentially different PIs may exist within a single lesion based on the inverse relation between differentiation and proliferation. Proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and MIB-1 (Ki-67 equivalent antigen) demonstration in histologic sections by immunoperoxidase methods may allow for determination of PI in relation to tissue type. EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: A consecutive unselected series of 8 pediatric nephroblastoma patients was used to study the relation between PI and histologic differentiation as established by flow-cytometric analysis of nuclear suspensions prepared from formalin-fixed and paraffin-embedded tissue and by PCNA/MIB1 staining of parallel histologic sections. PI by PCNA/MIB1 was established using 5-microns paraffin sections, immunoperoxidase, and quantification procedures detailed in the literature. The mitotic index (MI) of tissue components was separately assessed using 5-microns hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections and counting procedures detailed in the literature. RESULTS: The 8 lesions showed a PI of 4 to 20% as determined by flow cytometry. Using PCNA staining, the epithelium showed a mean PI of 55.5% (range 40 to 80%), that was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon's two-tailed rank sum test) than blastema (mean PI: 34.1%, range 17.5 to 76.5%) and stroma (mean PI of 14.9%, range 5 to 24%, p &lt; 0.001, Wilcoxon's two-tailed rank sum test). Although, probably due to tissue antigen preservation, acceptable MIB-1 staining was not achieved in all lesions (5 of 8), the results, although generally with lower labeling indices, confirmed the PCNA findings. The relative MI of epithelial components was higher than that of stroma and blastema in keeping with the immunocytochemical findings. In 6 of 8 cases, the PI by flow-cytometric analysis was lower than the lowest value for the PI (labeling index) of an individual tissue type found by PCNA or MIB staining. CONCLUSIONS: The differences found between PI of the different tissue components in nephroblastoma are difficult to understand if the epithelial components (with the highest PI values) are considered as differentiation products from the other components of the lesion. The relation between PIs as determined by PCNA/MIB-1 analysis/mitotic index, for the three components and the PI as established by flow cytometry is not simply explained by the relative volume of the tissue components.",M2
8322710,"Determination of proliferation index in advanced ovarian cancer using quantitative image analysis.It has been shown that the monoclonal antibody Ki-67 reacts with a nuclear antigen that is expressed only by proliferating cells. The feasibility of using image analysis to quantitate Ki-67 staining (proliferation index [<e>PI</e>]) of epithelial ovarian cancers was investigated. The PI was determined in 50 advanced-stage primary ovarian cancers. Frozen sections were immunostained with the Ki-67 monoclonal antibody, and the PI was calculated using static image analysis. Among 35 stage III ovarian carcinomas, the median PI was 8.9%, compared with 17.7% in 15 stage IV cancers (P = 0.06). There was no relationship between PI and histologic grade. The median survival time of 32 patients whose cancers had a high Ki-67 expression (&gt; or = 7.5%) was 16.8 months, which differed significantly (P &lt; 0.01) from the median survival of 31.5 months observed in patients whose tumors demonstrated low Ki-67 expression (&lt; 7.5%). Quantitative image analysis of Ki-67-stained fresh-frozen ovarian cancers may provide useful prognostic information. Further studies are warranted to investigate the relationship between Ki-67 expression and other known clinicopathologic and genetic features of ovarian cancer.",M2
1607732,"Some considerations on the biology of pancreatic serous cystadenoma.Five cases of pancreatic serous cystadenoma were examined pathologically, and their nuclear DNA ploidy patterns were determined. Four were unifocal tumors, and one was a multifocal tumor. The four unifocal tumors were typical serous cystadenomas. However, the multifocal tumor exhibited an increased N/C ratio, irregular nuclear margins, various-sized nuclei, coarse nuclear chromatin, and neural invasion. All tumor cells were stained with antiCA19-9 but none with antiCEA. In the antiCA19-9 staining, the four unifocal tumors and the tumors of the pancreatic tail in the multifocal case were positive only on the apical membrane, whereas the tumor cells of the pancreatic head in the multifocal case were positive within the whole cytosol. The unifocal tumors were diploid with a DNA Index (DI) of 1.0 and proliferation indices (<e>PI</e>) from 4.9 to 20.9% with a mean of 14.4%. In the multifocal case, the tumor in the pancreatic head was aneuploid (DI = 1.9) and had a PI of 27.8%. The multifocal sites in the pancreatic body were aneuploid (DI = 1.9) with a PI of 22.4%. We suggest that the biological property of serous cystadenoma should be revisited.",M2
1985876,"Diffuse centrocytic and/or centroblastic malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas: comparison of mitotic and pyknotic (apoptotic) indices.Mitotic indices (MIs) and pyknotic (apoptotic) indices (<e>PIs</e>) were assessed in diffuse centrocytic (CC, n = 10), centroblastic/centrocytic (CB/CC, n = 18) and centroblastic (CB, n = 20) malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHL). Significant differences were observed. MIs were lowest in CC (median: 0.07%), intermediate in CB/CC (0.18%) and highest in CB (0.43%) NHLs. The PIs exhibited a similar pattern. The PIs of CC (0.11%) and CB/CC (0.17%) NHLs were significantly different from those of CB lymphoma (0.62%). The ratios MI/PI per case, as well as MIs and PIs per case, varied greatly and showed considerable overlapping, thus documenting a marked inter-case and inter-group heterogeneity. MIs tended to loosely correlate with PIs in a non-linear fashion, which raises the question of feedback mechanisms. More information is needed on mitotic time (TM) and apoptotic time (TA), in order to estimate cell doubling time from data on MIs and PIs.",M2
