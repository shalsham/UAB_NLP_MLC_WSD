20408308,"The lessons of <e>SARS</e> in Hong Kong.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a novel coronavirus infection which broke out in Hong Kong in March 2003. Princess Margaret Hospital was designated to manage this new, mysterious and serious disease. Healthcare workers had to work under extremely stressful and often risky conditions to care for patients. Despite manpower and equipment reinforcements, staff infection occurred as a result of bodily exhaustion, working in an unfamiliar environment and lapses in infection control. Patients suffered even more, not only due to physical discomfort, but also because of the fear of isolation and death away from family and friends. Health authorities learnt their lessons in the outbreak and formulated emergency plans for future infectious disease epidemics. The healthcare infrastructure has been examined and upgraded with regard to intensive care capacity, infection control measures, professional training, manpower deployment, staff facilities, and stockpiling of drugs and personal protective equipment.",M1
20388333,"[Perceived stress in general public during prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome and its impact on health behavior]OBJECTIVE: To find out the perceived stress in general public during prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) and its impact on health behavior. METHODS: A retrospective survey was conducted in Guangzhou, Hangzhou, and Taiyuan according to the epidemic situations of SARS, and 2532 subjects were randomly selected from constructive industry, school, and commercial business and residents in urban and rural areas. The perceive stress was measured by Chinese perceived stress scale (CPSS), and health related behavior during SARS was tested by uniform and self-made questionnaire. EpiData 2.0 was used for data management and CPSS value was calculated according to answer to 14 questions contained in the scale. Health risk stress among different population group and health related behavior among low, medium and high stress state were analyzed by SPSS 11.5. RESULTS: 2424 subjects were involved in the survey. The CPSS value was measured from 0 - 49 (22.7 +/- 6.8), M = 24.0. 39.3% (953/2379) subjects were under the health risk stress. The health related behaviors such as washing hands, opening the window for air, keeping away from others when cough and sneeze, doing exercises etc were reduced with the stress increased. Logistic regression indicated that compared with the persons with the thoughts of nothing serious of SARS, without any dread of SARS, and knowing nothing about prevention of SARS, the perceived stress was significantly related with perceiving of the thread to certain extent (beta = 0.41, Wald chi(2) = 4.84, P = 0.03), worrying little about the epidemic (beta = 0.50, Wald chi(2) = 6.69, P = 0.01), worrying about it to certain extent (beta = 1.39, Wald chi(2) = 48.59, P = 0.00) and scared so much (beta = 1.77, Wald chi(2) = 53.59, P = 0.00), and knowing little about the prevention (beta = 0.74, Wald chi(2) = 4.48, P = 0.03), knowing something about prevention (beta = -0.98, Wald chi(2) = 8.29, P = 0.00) and knowing the prevention very well (beta = -1.18, Wald chi(2) = 10.66, P = 0.00). CONCLUSION: The adoption of health related behaviors declined with increase of perceived stress. Opening connection to authority and government, enhancing the awareness of outburst affairs among general public and providing positive social support may be effective ways to reduce the population perceived stress.",M1
20230231,"How to reduce the impact of  low-risk patients  following a bioterrorist incident: lessons from <e>SARS</e>, anthrax, and pneumonic plague.A bioterrorist attack may result in a large number of people who have not been exposed coming to medical facilities in search of treatment or reassurance. In this article, we review evidence from 3 previous biological incidents that are analogous to a bioterrorist attack in order to gauge the likely incidence of such  low-risk patients  and to identify possible strategies for coping with this phenomenon. Evidence from the anthrax attacks in the United States suggested that a surge of low-risk patients is by no means inevitable. Data from the SARS outbreak illustrated that if hospitals are seen as sources of contagion, many patients with non-bioterrorism-related healthcare needs may delay seeking help. Finally, the events surrounding the pneumonic plague outbreak of 1994 in Surat, India, highlighted the need for the public to be kept adequately informed about an incident. Although it is impossible to say what the likely incidence of low-risk patients will be during a future bioterrorist incident, several strategies may help to reduce it and to safeguard the well-being of the low-risk patients themselves. These strategies include providing clear information about who should and should not attend hospital; using telephone services to provide more detailed information and initial screening; employing rapid triage at hospital entrances, based, where possible, on exposure history and objective signs of illness; and following up by telephone those judged to be at low risk.",M1
20216125,"Osteonecrosis in patients after severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>): possible role of anticardiolipin antibodies.OBJECTIVES: This study examined the anticardiolipin antibodies in post-SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome) osteonecrosis patients to investigate the etiology of post-SARS osteonecrosis, and to eventually provide valuable information for the early diagnosis of nontraumatic osteonecrosis and for the susceptible population screening. METHODS: This study recruited 62 post-SARS osteonecrosis patients and 52 age- and gender-matched healthy controls. Fasting blood samples were collected from all the subjects through cubital veins. Immunoglobulins A, G and M (IgA, G and M) types of anticardiolipin antibodies were examined by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The routine examinations of prothrombin time, thrombin time, prothrombin activity, and international normalized ratio were also performed. RESULTS: There were 21 of 62 post-SARS osteonecrosis patients (33.9%) who showed at least one type of anticardiolipin antibodies. The titers of specific IgA, IgG, and IgM were 11.33 +/- 11.209 APL, 5.127 +/- 5.927 GPL, and 17.821 +/- 10.606 MPL, respectively. There were only 4 of 52 subjects in the control group (7.7%) who showed positive anticardiolipin antibody with titers of IgA at 10.702 +/- 3.126 APL, IgG at 5.184 +/- 4.780 GPL, and IgM at 14.684 +/- 5.516 MPL. There were significant differences between the 2 groups confirmed by t-Test and chi(2) test (P &lt; 0.05), while no significant differences were observed in prothrombin time, thrombin time, prothrombin activity, and international normalized ratio results between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: The incidences of anticardiolipin antibodies were increased in the post-SARS osteonecrosis patients and anticardiolipin antibodies may play a role in the pathogenesis of post-SARS osteonecrosis.",M1
20205928,"A comparative epidemiologic analysis of <e>SARS</e> in Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan.BACKGROUND: The 2002-2003 Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak infected 8,422 individuals leading to 916 deaths around the world. However, there have been few epidemiological studies of SARS comparing epidemiologic features across regions. The aim of this study is to identify similarities and differences in SARS epidemiology in three populations with similar host and viral genotype. METHODS: We present a comparative epidemiologic analysis of SARS, based on an integrated dataset with 3,336 SARS patients from Hong Kong, Beijing and Taiwan, epidemiological and clinical characteristics such as incubation, onset-to-admission, onset-to-discharge and onset-to-death periods, case fatality ratios (CFRs) and presenting symptoms are described and compared between regions. We further explored the influence of demographic and clinical variables on the apparently large differences in CFRs between the three regions. RESULTS: All three regions showed similar incubation periods and progressive shortening of the onset-to-admission interval through the epidemic. Adjusted for sex, health care worker status and nosocomial setting, older age was associated with a higher fatality, with adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.10 (95% confidence interval: 1.45, 3.04) for those aged 51-60; AOR: 4.57 (95% confidence interval: 3.32, 7.30) for those aged above 60 compared to those aged 41-50 years. Presence of pre-existing comorbid conditions was also associated with greater mortality (AOR: 1.74; 95% confidence interval: 1.36, 2.21). CONCLUSION: The large discrepancy in crude fatality ratios across the three regions can only be partly explained by epidemiological and clinical heterogeneities. Our findings underline the importance of a common data collection platform, especially in an emerging epidemic, in order to identify and explain consistencies and differences in the eventual clinical and public health outcomes of infectious disease outbreaks, which is becoming increasingly important in our highly interconnected world.",M1
20186649,"Social support and psychological adjustment to <e>SARS</e>: the mediating role of self-care self-efficacy.The study tested the model of perceived support from medical staff and family/friends on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) survivors' mental health as mediated by self-care self-efficacy. One hundred and forty-three SARS survivors recruited from the Hong Kong Hospital Authority following 18 months recovery were surveyed by trained interviewers using structured questionnaires. Based on structural equation modeling, findings showed that self-care self-efficacy completely mediated the effects of perceived medical staff support and perceived family/friends support on mental health status. The model achieved a satisfactory fit, CFI = 0.98, NNFI = 0.98, RMSEA = 0.06, and explained 75.2% of the variance in mental health status. The study is the first attempt in understanding long-term psychological adjustment of SARS survivors. Findings may be applicable to other infectious disease outbreaks in informing psychosocial factors that are important to long-term recovery.",M1
20134095,"Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) in disease pathogenesis.Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a first homolog of ACE, regulates the renin-angiotensin system by counterbalancing ACE activity. Accumulating evidence in recent years has demonstrated a physiological and pathological role of ACE2 in the cardiovascular, renal and respiratory systems. For instance, in the acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), ACE, AngII, and AT1R promote the disease pathogenesis, whereas ACE2 and the AT2R protect from ARDS. Importantly, ACE2 has been identified as a key <e>SARS</e>-coronavirus receptor and plays a protective role in SARS pathogenesis. Furthermore, the recent explosion of research into the ACE2 homolog, collectrin, has revealed a new physiological function of ACE2 as an amino acid transporter, which explains the pathogenic role of gene mutations in Hartnup disorder. This review summarizes and discusses the recently unveiled roles for ACE2 in disease pathogenesis.",M1
20105703,"Psychosocial and coping responses within the community health care setting towards a national outbreak of an infectious disease.OBJECTIVE: The psychological and coping responses of the noninfected community towards infectious disease outbreaks are relatively understudied. This cross-sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>)-related psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and associated coping styles within the general population visiting community health care services. METHODS: It was conducted on individuals attending community polyclinics in Singapore within the first week of July 2003, 16 weeks after the first national outbreak of SARS. The General Health Questionnaire-28, Impact of Event Scale-Revised, and Brief COPE were used to determine the prevalence rates of psychiatric and posttraumatic morbidities and employed coping strategies respectively. RESULTS: The overall response rate was 78.0%. Of the 415 community health care setting respondents, we found significant rates of SARS-related psychiatric (22.9%) and posttraumatic morbidities (25.8%). The presence of psychiatric morbidity was associated with the presence of high level of posttraumatic symptoms [adjusted odds ratio (OR) 2.26, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.24-4.13, P=.008]. Psychiatric morbidity was further associated with being seen at fever stations (adjusted OR 1.90, 95% CI 1.08-3.34, P=.026), younger age (adjusted OR 0.97, 95% CI 0.94-0.98, P=.021), increased self blame (adjusted OR 1.67, 95% CI 1.22-2.28, P=.001), less substance use (adjusted OR 0.74, 95% CI 0.56-0.98, P=.034) and posttraumatic morbidity was associated with increased use of denial (adjusted OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.04-1.67, P=.024), and planning (adjusted OR 1.51, 95% CI 1.16-1.95, P=.002) as coping measures. CONCLUSION: These findings could potentially inform the development of practical community mental health programs for future infectious disease outbreaks.",M1
20083327,"Lessons learned from the anti-<e>SARS</e> quarantine experience in a hospital-based fever screening station in Taiwan.BACKGROUND: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first major novel infectious disease to hit the international community in the 21st century. While SARS was sweeping over almost 30 countries, most hospitals in Taiwan instituted mandatory quarantine measures, one of the most effective public health strategies for preventing disease transmission. We explored the anti-SARS quarantine experience of patients in a hospital-based fever screening station. METHODS: We conducted a phenomenologic, qualitative study using semistructured telephone interviews during the SARS outbreak in Taiwan. Seventeen patients with fever who were quarantined in the fever screening station of a hospital emergency department for at least 2 hours were recruited into this study. RESULTS: Data analysis using Collaizi's 9 steps revealed 2 categories--external burden and internal struggle--and 6 themes regarding patients' quarantine experience. External burden included 3 themes: (1) bearing the uncomfortable surroundings, (2) facing discrimination, and (3) lacking in-person family support. Internal struggle consisted of 3 themes: (1) struggle with being quarantined, (2) struggle with emotional turmoil, and (3) struggle with possible SARS diagnosis. CONCLUSION: These results will contribute to sensitizing health care professionals to empathize with quarantined persons while providing quality quarantine care and other infection control measures.",M1
20008700,"Mental morbidities and chronic fatigue in severe acute respiratory syndrome survivors: long-term follow-up.BACKGROUND: Short-term follow-up studies of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) survivors suggested that their physical conditions continuously improved in the first year but that their mental health did not. We investigated long-term psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue among SARS survivors. METHODS: All SARS survivors from the hospitals of a local region in Hong Kong were assessed by a constellation of psychometric questionnaires and a semistructured clinical interview for the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) to determine the presence of psychiatric disorders and chronic fatigue problems. RESULTS: Of 369 SARS survivors, 233 (63.1%) participated in the study (mean period of time after SARS, 41.3 months). Over 40% of the respondents had active psychiatric illnesses, 40.3% reported a chronic fatigue problem, and 27.1% met the modified 1994 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention criteria for chronic fatigue syndrome. Logistic regression analysis suggested that being a health care worker at the time of SARS infection (odds ratio [OR], 3.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.12- 9.39; P = .03), being unemployed at follow-up (OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 1.50-14.78; P = .008), having a perception of social stigmatization (OR, 3.03; 95% CI, 1.20-7.60; P = .02), and having applied to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.92; 95% CI, 1.18-7.22; P = .02) were associated with an increased risk of psychiatric morbidities at follow-up, whereas application to the SARS survivors' fund (OR, 2.64; 95% CI, 1.07-6.51; P = .04) was associated with increased risk of chronic fatigue problems. CONCLUSIONS: Psychiatric morbidities and chronic fatigue persisted and continued to be clinically significant among the survivors at the 4-year follow-up. Optimization of the treatment of mental health morbidities by a multidisciplinary approach with a view for long-term rehabilitation, especially targeting psychiatric and fatigue problems and functional and occupational rehabilitation, would be needed.",M1
19961669,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of hospital infection control response to an epidemic respiratory virus threat.The outbreak of influenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009 prompted many countries in Asia, previously strongly affected by severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>), to respond with stringent measures, particularly in preventing outbreaks in hospitals. We studied actual direct costs and cost-effectiveness of different response measures from a hospital perspective in tertiary hospitals in Singapore by simulating outbreaks of SARS, pandemic (H1N1) 2009, and 1918 Spanish influenza. Protection measures targeting only infected patients yielded lowest incremental cost/death averted of 23,000 (US dollars) for pandemic (H1N1) 2009. Enforced protection in high-risk areas (Yellow Alert) and full protection throughout the hospital (Orange Alert) averted deaths but came at an incremental cost of up to $2.5 million/death averted. SARS and Spanish influenza favored more stringent measures. High case-fatality rates, virulence, and high proportion of atypical manifestations impacted cost-effectiveness the most. A calibrated approach in accordance with viral characteristics and community risks may help refine responses to future epidemics.",M1
19960223,"Singapore's response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak: what do Singapore physicians think?OBJECTIVE: To gauge Singapore physicians' perceptions of the national response to the severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) outbreak using a questionnaire survey. METHODS: Random sampling was applied to draw the survey population. Descriptive analysis and logistic regressions were used. RESULTS: The majority of physicians agreed that home quarantine of contacts of patients with probable SARS was warranted (95%), government's public education effort was effective (83%), and the overall Singapore's response was commendable (82%). Only 38%, however, agreed that health care workers were supplied with timely and adequate personal protective equipment. CONCLUSIONS: Most Singapore physicians have positive comments about the national response to the SARS crisis. However, systematic weaknesses are identified and recommendations are presented.",M1
19958537,"Identification of a novel conserved HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from the spike protein of <e>SARS</e>-CoV.BACKGROUND: The spike (S) protein is a major structural glycoprotein of coronavirus (CoV), the causal agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The S protein is a potent target for SARS-specific cell-mediated immune responses. However, the mechanism CoV pathogenesis in SARS and the role of special CTLs in virus clearance are still largely uncharacterized. Here, we describe a study that leads to the identification of a novel HLA-A*0201-restricted epitope from conserved regions of S protein. RESULTS: First, different SARS-CoV sequences were analyzed to predict eight candidate peptides from conserved regions of the S protein based upon HLA-A*0201 binding and proteosomal cleavage. Four of eight candidate peptides were tested by HLA-A*0201 binding assays. Among the four candidate peptides, Sp8 (S958-966, VLNDILSRL) induced specific CTLs both ex vivo in PBLs of healthy HLA-A2+ donors and in HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice immunized with a plasmid encoding full-length S protein. The immunized mice released IFN-gamma and lysed target cells upon stimulation with Sp8 peptide-pulsed autologous dendritic cells in comparison to other candidates. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that Sp8 is a naturally processed epitope. We propose that Sp8 epitope should help in the characterization of mechanisms of virus control and immunopathology in SARS-CoV infection.",M1

19892230,"Recently discovered human coronaviruses.In marked contrast to their historical classification as relatively harmless, common cold-causing, respiratory pathogens, human coronaviruses (HCoVs) are associated with more severe clinical complications, as emphasized by the discovery of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated CoV (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) in 2003. Still, their precise pathogenic potential is largely unknown, particularly regarding the most recently identified strains HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, and definite proof for their etiology remains a major challenge.

19892213,"Posttraumatic stress disorder in convalescent severe acute respiratory syndrome patients: a 4-year follow-up study.OBJECTIVE: To measure the incidence and impact of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in a cohort of 70 subjects with severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>). METHODS: Clinical assessments of PTSD were conducted at 2, 7, 10, 20 and 46 months after discharge from medical hospitalization for treatment of SARS. Diagnoses of PTSD were established by a trained psychiatrist using the Chinese Classification of Mental Disorders (CCMD-III) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition (DSM-IV) criteria. To study the impact of PTSD, we used the Impact of Event Scale (IES), Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS), Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale (SDS), Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90), Short Form-36 (SF-36 Health Survey) and Social Disability Screening Schedule (SDSS). RESULTS: Of the 68 subjects who finished at least two follow-up interviews, 30 developed PTSD over the study period (44.1%). Scores on IES, SAS, SDS and SCL-90 (P&lt;.0001) were higher, and functional impairment as measured by SF-36 (P&lt;.0001) and SDSS was more severe (P=.0073) for subjects with PTSD. CONCLUSION: PTSD occurs in a significant percentage of subjects who recover from SARS, and the occurrence of PTSD predicts persistent psychological distress and diminished social functioning in the 4 years after SARS treatment.",M1
19891170,"The impact of ERI, burnout, and caring for <e>SARS</e> patients on hospital nurses' self-reported compliance with infection control.Siegrist's (1996) Effort-Reward Imbalance (ERI) Model provided the theoretical basis for this secondary data analysis that examines the relationship between nurses' ERI and their self-reported compliance with infection control, between ERI and burnout and nurses' compliance, and between nurses' experience in caring for SARS patients and their compliance with infection control. Data for this study came from a collaborative interdisciplinary study examining the barriers and facilitators to implementing protective measures against SARS and other existing and emerging infections among hospital nurses in Ontario and British Columbia. This is the first study to examine the relationship between ERI and compliance with infection control, as well as the impact of nurses' experience in caring for SARS patients on their compliance behaviour with infection control. Hierarchical multiple linear regression analyses revealed that ERI is a significant predictor of decreased compliance with infection control (beta = -.15, p &lt; .05). While ERI was shown to be associated with burnout (beta = .60, p &lt; .001), the combined effect of these two variables did not significantly improve the prediction of compliance behaviour (beta = -.03, p = .63). Nurses who reported having directly cared for SARS patients were found to have increased compliance with infection control (beta = .15, p &lt; .001) after controlling for demographic and work environment factors. These findings highlight how nurses' adverse workplace environments can affect their work and health and thus, can be used by nursing and hospital administrators to help develop interventions to lower occupational stress and improve health in the workplace.",M1

Many control measures that seriously affected public life were implemented afterwards, i.e., when the epidemic was already dying down.",M1
19814763,"Transmission of <e>SARS</e> in three Chinese hospitals.OBJECTIVE: To quantify the transmissibility of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in hospitals in mainland China and to assess the effectiveness of control measures. METHODS: We report key epidemiological details of three major hospital outbreaks of SARS in mainland China, and estimate the evolution of the effective reproduction number in each of the three hospitals during the course of the outbreaks. RESULTS: The three successive hospital outbreaks infected 41, 99 and 91 people of whom 37%, 60% and 70% were hospital staff. These cases resulted in 33 deaths, five of which occurred in hospital staff. In a multivariate logistic regression, age and whether or not the case was a healthcare worker (HCW) were found to be significant predictors of mortality. The estimated effective reproduction numbers (95% CI) for the three epidemics peaked at 8 (5, 11), 9 (4, 14) and 12 (7, 17). In all three hospitals the epidemics were rapidly controlled, bringing the reproduction number below one within 25, 10 and 5 days respectively. CONCLUSIONS: This work shows that in three major hospital epidemics in Beijing and Tianjin substantially higher rates of transmission were initially observed than those seen in the community. In all three cases the hospital epidemics were rapidly brought under control, with the time to successful control becoming shorter in each successive outbreak.",M1
19814762,"The <e>SARS</e> outbreak in a general hospital in Tianjin, China: clinical aspects and risk factors for disease outcome.OBJECTIVES: To describe clinical characteristics of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients in a hospital in Tianjin, China, thereby comparing probable and suspected cases; to study risk factors associated with the death of cases; to describe the implementation of preventive interventions during the hospital outbreak. METHODS: Physical and haematological information was obtained from clinical records. White blood cell counts, and percentages of neutrophilic granulocytes and neutrophilic lymphocytes were measured. The service department of the hospital provided information about daily use of protective materials. Differences in clinical symptoms between probable and suspected SARS cases were tested by Fisher's exact test. Non-linear mixed modelling was used to test for differences between the haematological patterns for probable and suspected cases. Risk factors for dying among probable SARS cases were tested by logistic regression. RESULTS: The SARS outbreak started with a patient from Beijing on 15 April 2003, and spread quickly among the healthcare workers and in-patients in the hospital. In total 90 probable and 21 suspected cases were reported, with 17 deaths among them (case fatality rate 15%). Haematological patterns were significantly different between probable and suspected cases, whereas the percentages with certain clinical symptoms showed no apparent difference. Death of probable SARS cases was only significantly associated with high age and use of a respiratory machine (mainly for the most severe cases), whereas e.g. co-morbidity and steroid treatment showed no impact in multivariate analysis. Stringent control measures, including distribution of huge numbers of protective materials, started on 20 April, which soon lead to a strong decrease in the incidence of new cases. After the last SARS case left the hospital on 6 June, protective materials were dispensed at substantially lower rates, but not to zero, as was the case during the first days of the outbreak. CONCLUSION: The working definition of probable SARS used during the epidemic appeared to have been fairly accurate. Many valuable lessons were learned regarding prevention of hospital spread of infection, especially the need to have sufficient protective supplies available and to implement these rigidly and at an early stage of an (threatening) epidemic.",M1
19814761,"No evidence of over-reporting of <e>SARS</e> in mainland China.OBJECTIVE: To find out whether there was over-reporting of SARS patients in mainland China in view of the relatively low case fatality ratio in mainland China, in comparison with other affected countries and areas. METHODS: We searched PubMed for all SARS antibody detection papers (in English or Chinese language) using the keywords 'SARS' and 'antibody'. Then the resulting articles were further read through to select the SARS detection results using ELISA methods of serum samples collected at least 1 month after disease onset. A multi-level logistic regression was applied to test for possible differences in the proportions positive between locations of the study. RESULTS: A total of 48 studies were identified, including 39 from mainland China and nine from elsewhere (Hong Kong, Taiwan, Canada and Vietnam). For mainland China, there was no difference between Guangdong, Beijing and other provinces in the proportions testing positive (83.0%, 85.8% and 85.4% respectively). The grand average of 84.2% seropositive was lower than the 95.1% for the countries and areas outside of mainland China combined. However, this difference was far from significant after correcting for dependency of individual tests within the same study. CONCLUSIONS: Our study showed no evidence of over-reporting of SARS in mainland China, nor in Guangdong, where the SARS epidemic started. Even if the lower seroprevalence in mainland China, relative to other affected areas, does represent actual over-reporting, then this factor can only explain a modest 10% of the lower case fatality in mainland China.",M1

AIMS: To develop and evaluate a new airway management training protocol by using an integrated course of lectures, technical workshops and medical simulations. METHODS: In each PGY1 course, the trainees participated in the Advanced Airway Life Support (AALS) program. After 2 h lecture, the trainees were divided into three groups for 4 h technical workshop, including 10 skill stations and medical simulation at the Clinical Skills Resources Center of the hospital at different times. Video-based debriefing and feedback were performed after each simulation. The same scenario was re-simulated after debriefing. Participants' performance was assessed by single global rating and a 5 key actions scoring. RESULTS: A total of 266 junior physicians have been trained with this AALS programs in 2 years. They learned the techniques of airway management, passed the performance checklist of technical workshop, and received higher scores during re-simulation regardless of scoring methods.

Family caregiving and other sources of role conflict among nurses during large-scale outbreaks.OBJECTIVES: The global impact of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) brought attention to the role of healthcare professionals as  first receivers  during infectious disease outbreaks, a collateral aspect to their role as responders. This article records and reports concerns expressed by Canadian emergency and critical care nurses in terms of organizational and social supports required during infectious disease outbreaks. The nature of work-family and family-work conflict perceived and experienced by nurses during infectious disease outbreaks, as well as the supports needed to enable them to balance their social roles during this type of heightened stress, are explored. METHODS: Five focus groups consisting of 100 nurses were conducted using a Structured Interview Matrix facilitation technique. RESULTS: Four emergent themes included: (1) substantial personal/professional dilemmas; (2) assistance with child, elder, and/or pet care; (3) adequate resources and vaccinations to protect families; and (4) appropriate mechanisms to enable two-way communication between employees and their families under conditions of quarantine or long work hours. CONCLUSIONS: Social and organizational supports are critical to help buffer the effects of stress for nurses and assist them in managing difficult role conflicts during infectious disease outbreaks. These supports are necessary to improve response capacity for bio-disasters.",M1

But three years later, she was celebrated for her success in the contest for the WHO director-generalship. How was she transformed from an incompetent official into an  honor winner  for China and Hong Kong? In what context was this made possible? How was the collective memory about Chan recalled and reconstructed? This article tackles these questions by reviewing relevant reportage and commentary in major local (Hong Kong), national (China), and international media. It maps the political context of the media discourse and explores the construction of a collective past to foster national cohesion in postcolonial Hong Kong.",M1

The concern centers on the fact that as of April 24, 2009 over 134 cases have been reported in Mexico with an accompanying high mortality rate in healthy young adults. With new information surfacing from public health investigations of recent cases of swine influenza in the United States, here we discuss putative links between the outbreak of SRI in Mexico and the emergence of a novel swine influenza A (H1N1) strain in several southwestern U.S. states.",M1
19747256,"Instructive messages from Chinese nurses' stories of caring for <e>SARS</e> patients.AIM: To identify instructive messages to guide nursing practice in future epidemics by examining the stories of Chinese nurses who cared for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. BACKGROUND: Mainland China had three outbreaks of SARS between November 2002-May 2004 and suffered the greatest impact on morbidity and mortality worldwide. Most of the nursing-related literature about SARS has been reported from other countries. Researchers expect that global infections, like SARS, will persist and escalate in the future. It is important to access the guidance from nurses who cared for SARS patients in China and to uncover instructive messages which can be useful when facing global infections in the future. DESIGN: Descriptive exploratory qualitative study of six Chinese nurses. METHODS: Data were collected in 2003, within the three months following the nurses' quarantine necessitated by caring for SARS patients. Conventional content analysis was done using a cyberspace method of data analysis, where the geographically distant researchers conducted most phases of analysis through email communication. RESULTS: Chinese nurses faced personal challenge, focused on the essence of care and experienced self-growth while caring for SARS patients. They cited structured support, meaningful disease-related information and sensitivity to the importance of a collaborative spirit as factors which enabled their caring nursing practice. CONCLUSIONS: These instructive messages come from China, where the SARS epidemic inflicted an unparalleled health impact. The messages give voice to the Chinese nursing experience and when synthesised with reports from other international nurses, they enable specific direction to enhance potential for a well-prepared nursing workforce and quality patient care in future epidemics. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: The preparation of a knowledgeable, cared-for nursing workforce promises optimal outcomes with the emergence of the next global infection.",M1
19635508,"Elucidating the molecular physiopathology of acute respiratory distress syndrome in severe acute respiratory syndrome patients.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury. It is a response to various diseases of variable etiology, including <e>SARS</e>-CoV infection. To date, a comprehensive study of the genomic physiopathology of ARDS (and SARS) is lacking, primarily due to the difficulty of finding suitable materials to study the disease process at a tissue level (instead of blood, sputa or swaps). Hereby we attempt to provide such study by analyzing autopsy lung samples from patient who died of SARS and showed different degrees of severity of the pulmonary involvement. We performed real-time quantitative PCR analysis of 107 genes with functional roles in inflammation, coagulation, fibrosis and apoptosis; some key genes were confirmed at a protein expression level by immunohistochemistry and correlated to the degree of morphological severity present in the individual samples analyzed. Significant expression levels were identified for ANPEP (a receptor for CoV), as well as inhibition of the STAT1 pathway, IFNs production and CXCL10 (a T-cell recruiter). Other genes unassociated to date with ARDS/SARS include C1Qb, C5R1, CASP3, CASP9, CD14, CD68, FGF7, HLA-DRA, IGF1, IRF3, MALAT-1, MSR1, NFIL3, SLPI, USP33, CLC, GBP1 and TAC1. As a result, we proposed to therapeutically target some of these genes with compounds such as ANPEP inhibitors, SLPI and dexamethasone. Ultimately, this study may serve as a model for future, tissue-based analyses of fibroinflammatory conditions affecting the lung.",M1
19570864,"Protective and pathologic roles of the immune response to mouse hepatitis virus type 1: implications for severe acute respiratory syndrome.Intranasal mouse hepatitis virus type 1 (MHV-1) infection of mice induces lung pathology similar to that observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) patients. However, the severity of MHV-1-induced pulmonary disease varies among mouse strains, and it has been suggested that differences in the host immune response might account for this variation. It has also been suggested that immunopathology may represent an important clinical feature of SARS. Little is known about the host immune response to MHV-1 and how it might contribute to some of the pathological changes detected in infected mice. In this study we show that an intact type I interferon system and the adaptive immune responses are required for controlling MHV-1 replication and preventing morbidity and mortality in resistant C57BL/6J mice after infection. The NK cell response also helps minimize the severity of illness following MHV-1 infection of C57BL/6J mice. In A/J and C3H/HeJ mice, which are highly susceptible to MHV-1-induced disease, we demonstrate that both CD4 and CD8 T cells contribute to morbidity during primary infection, and memory responses can enhance morbidity and mortality during subsequent reexposure to MHV-1. However, morbidity in A/J and C3H/HeJ mice can be minimized by treating them with immune serum prior to MHV-1 infection. Overall, our findings highlight the role of the host immune response in contributing to the pathogenesis of coronavirus-induced respiratory disease.",M1
19559881,"A self-assembled fusion protein-based surface plasmon resonance biosensor for rapid diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome.A surface plasmon resonance (SPR)-based biosensor was developed for simple diagnosis of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) using a protein created by genetically fusing gold binding polypeptides (GBPs) to a SARS coronaviral surface antigen (SCVme). The GBP domain of the fusion protein serves as an anchoring component onto the gold surface, exploiting the gold binding affinity of the domain, whereas the SCVme domain is a recognition element for anti-SCVme antibody, the target analyte in this study. SPR analysis indicated the fusion protein simply and strongly self-immobilized onto the gold surface, through GBP, without surface chemical modification, offering a stable and specific sensing platform for anti-SCVme detection. AFM and SPR imaging analyses demonstrated that anti-SCVme specifically bound to the fusion protein immobilized onto the gold-micropatterned chip, implying that appropriate orientation of bound fusion protein by GBP resulted in optimal exposure of the SCVme domain to the assay solution, resulting in efficient capture of anti-SCVme antibody. The best packing density of the fusion protein onto the SPR chip was achieved at the concentration of 10 microg mL(-1); this density showed the highest detection response (906RU) for anti-SCVme. The fusion protein-coated SPR chip at the best packing density had a lower limit of detection of 200 ng mL(-1) anti-SCVme within 10 min and also allowed selective detection of anti-SCVme with significantly low responses for non-specific mouse IgG at all tested concentrations. The fusion protein provides a simple and effective method for construction of SPR sensing platforms permitting sensitive and selective detection of anti-SCVme antibody.",M1
19558736,"Metered-dose inhaler with spacer instead of nebulizer during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Singapore.BACKGROUND: The use of metered-dose inhaler (MDI) with spacer instead of nebulizer may be important during an outbreak of an airborne infection. However, there is a paucity of data on patients' and nurses' abilities and perspectives on MDI with spacer for the treatment of acute airway obstruction during such an outbreak. METHODS: We evaluated 50 consecutive MDI-with-spacer treatments administered in the respiratory wards of the National University Hospital of Singapore, and interviewed the patients after each treatment during the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>). We also conducted interviews with 50 nurses who had experience in administering bronchodilators via both nebulizer and MDI with spacer. RESULTS: Forty-six patients (92%) were able to use MDI with spacer effectively. Sixteen percent of the patients preferred nebulizer over MDI with spacer. Fifty-eight percent of the patients thought MDI with spacer was easier to use than nebulizer, and 34% thought MDI was as easy to use as nebulizer. Sixteen percent of the patients thought that nebulizer was more effective than MDI with spacer in relieving their symptoms. Ninety-six percent of the nurses preferred nebulizer over MDI with spacer. Forty-two nurses (84%) thought that nebulizer was more effective for treating acute airflow obstruction in the hospital. CONCLUSIONS: In the in-patient setting during an outbreak of an airborne infection, for treatment of acute airflow obstruction, MDI with spacer was acceptable and preferred by a high percentage of patients. However, a high percentage of nurses had misconceptions regarding the efficacy of and patients' ability to use MDI with spacer.",M1
19555791,"Long-term psychiatric morbidities among <e>SARS</e> survivors.OBJECTIVE: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was the first massive infectious disease outbreak of the 21st century. However, it is unlikely that this outbreak will be the last. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term psychiatric morbidities in survivors of SARS. METHOD: This is a cohort study designed to investigate psychiatric complications among SARS survivors treated in the United Christian Hospital 30 months after the SARS outbreak. Psychiatric morbidities were assessed by the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Impact of Events Scale-Revised and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale. Functional outcomes were assessed by the Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short-Form Health Survey. RESULTS: Ninety subjects were recruited, yielding a response rate of 96.8%. Post-SARS cumulative incidence of DSM-IV psychiatric disorders was 58.9%. Current prevalence for any psychiatric disorder at 30 months post-SARS was 33.3%. One-fourth of the patients had post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and 15.6% had depressive disorders. CONCLUSION: The outbreak of SARS can be regarded as a mental health catastrophe. PTSD was the most prevalent long-term psychiatric condition, followed by depressive disorders. Our results highlight the need to enhance preparedness and competence of health care professionals in detecting and managing the psychological sequelae of future comparable infectious disease outbreaks.",M1

19530059,"[Prevention and control of infectious diseases with pandemic potential: the EU-project SARSControl]INTRODUCTION: The influenza pandemics of the 20th century, the <e>SARS</e> epidemic in 2002/03 and the growing number of human cases infected with the H5N1 avian influenza virus clearly demonstrate that the threat of new pandemics is very real. These events have intensified pandemic prevention and control activities worldwide.  SARSControl  is a three-year project funded by the European Commission with the objective to aid European member states in the public health management of new emerging infections. This article summarises the main research results and recommendations arising from this project. METHOD: The reports and papers published in the SARSControl project form the basis of this article. In addition, a literature search for SARS and pandemic influenza was conducted and information on pandemic planning and management guidelines obtained from the WHO and EU websites. The project results are discussed in this context. RESULTS: A lack of knowledge and delayed international communication resulted in the rapid spread of SARS, highlighting the importance of a global system for rapid and transparent information transfer. Epidemiological and economic modelling studies have shown that, in comparison to travel restrictions, applying intervention measures to interrupt local transmission within a country and investing into vaccine research and anti-viral stockpiling, is a more cost-effective and efficient use of resources for the containment of pandemics. A study investigating the perceived threat associated with pandemics showed that the subjective risk perception of people varies among countries. This influences human behaviour and should hence be considered during risk communication and implementation of pandemic control measures. DISCUSSION: The basic prerequisites of an efficient pandemic management are operationalisable pandemic plans, subjected to regular exercises, backed by adequate resources and a sound health-care infrastructure. At international level cross-border co-operation and information exchange on infection control is the key to pandemic mitigation and containment. Strengthening surveillance systems at the international level, to allow the timely monitoring of infectious agents and outbreaks is essential. Transferring such outbreak information in real time into mathematical models and the resulting essential epidemiological information to policy makers would facilitate a more efficient use of scarce resources. Involvement of the public in decisions regarding the implementation of restrictive control measures which often curtail individual liberty is necessary for the acceptance and ultimate success of pandemic control.",M1
19508441,"The <e>SARS</e> epidemic in mainland China: bringing together all epidemiological data.OBJECTIVE: To document and verify the number of cases of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the 2002-2003 epidemic in mainland China. METHOD: All existing Chinese SARS data sources were integrated in one final database. This involved removing non-probable and duplicate cases, adding cases at the final stage of the outbreak, and collecting missing information. RESULTS: The resulting database contains a total of 5327 probable SARS cases, of whom 343 died, giving a case fatality ratio (CFR) of 6.4%. While the total number of cases happens to be equal to the original official reports, there are 5 cases overall which did not result in death. When compared with Hong Kong Special Administrative Region of China, China Taiwan, and Singapore, the SARS epidemic in mainland China resulted in a considerably lower CFR, involved relatively younger cases and included fewer health care workers. CONCLUSIONS: To optimise future data collection during large-scale outbreaks of emerging or re-emerging infectious disease, China must further improve the infectious diseases reporting system, enhance collaboration between all levels of disease control, health departments, hospitals and institutes nationally and globally, and train specialized staff working at county centres of disease control.",M1
19508440,"Controlling <e>SARS</e>: a review on China's response compared with other SARS-affected countries.OBJECTIVE: To summarise the major control measures implemented by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-affected countries and to compare distinctive features of the Chinese approach to other affected Asian countries and Canada. METHOD: Literature review. RESULTS: The realisation in March 2003 that SARS was spreading led affected countries to introduce measures such as rapid dissemination of information, early case detection and isolation, tracing and quarantining of SARS contacts, traveller screening, raising public awareness of risk and institution of stricter infection control in health care settings. SARS became a notifiable disease in China in mid-April 2003, after which introduction of efficient nationwide control measures led to containment within 2 months. Countries differed in the timeliness of implementing control measures, the mode and extent to which these were enforced and in the resources available to do so. CONCLUSION: SARS challenged the political and public health systems of all affected countries. It demanded rapid and decisive action to be taken, yet the comparison shows how difficult this was for an unknown new disease. Guangdong reacted rapidly but this pace was not continued by China for some time, which facilitated national and international spread. Once the Chinese government changed its policy, it developed an impressive control strategy involving the public which culminated in containment. The significance of timely information was perhaps the main lesson which the SARS epidemic taught.",M1
19508439,"Case fatality of <e>SARS</e> in mainland China and associated risk factors.OBJECTIVE: To analyse the case fatality ratio (CFR) and its risk factors for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in mainland China by using a comprehensive dataset of all probable cases. METHODS: The data of all probable SARS cases were derived from the Infectious Disease Reporting System of the Center of Diseases Control and Hospital Information Systems, during the 2003 epidemic in mainland China. The definition of probable SARS case was consistent with the definition for clinically confirmed SARS issued by the Ministry of Health of the People's Republic of China. We performed univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis to determine the association of CFR with age, sex, residence location, occupation, the period of the epidemic and the duration from symptom onset to admission into hospital. RESULTS: The overall CFR was 6.4% among 5327 probable SARS cases in mainland China. Old age, being a patient during the early period of a local outbreak, and being from Tianjin led to a relatively higher CFR than young age, late stage of a local outbreak and cases from Beijing. Guangdong Province resulted in an even lower CFR compared with Beijing. CONCLUSIONS: Because of their deteriorated health status and apparent complications, SARS patients aged &gt;60 years had a much higher risk of dying than younger patients. At the early stage of local outbreaks, lack of experience in patient care and perhaps treatment also led to a relatively higher CFR. The Tianjin SARS outbreak happened mainly within a hospital, leading to a high impact of co-morbidity. The relatively young age of the cases partly explains the low CFR in mainland China compared with other countries and areas affected by SARS.",M1

METHODS: Longitudinal study of 71 former SARS patients (mainly health care workers) who had been treated with corticosteroids, with an observation time of 36 months. Magnetic resonance images (MRI) and X-rays of hips, knees, shoulders, ankles and wrists were taken as part of the post-SARS follow-up assessments. RESULTS: Thirty-nine per cent developed AVN of the hips within 3-4 months after starting treatment. Two more cases of hip necrosis were seen after 1 year and another 11 cases of AVN were diagnosed after 3 years, one with hip necrosis and 10 with necrosis in other joints. In total, 58% of the cohort had developed AVN after 3 years of observation. The sole factor explaining AVN in the hip was the total dose of corticosteroids received. CONCLUSION: The use of corticosteroids in SARS has been debated; opinions conflict about whether the immediate benefits in terms of saving lives compensate for the adverse effects, including AVN.",M1
19508437,"Duration of symptom onset to hospital admission and admission to discharge or death in <e>SARS</e> in mainland China: a descriptive study.OBJECTIVE: To describe and analyse factors associated with the duration of disease onset to hospital admission, admission to discharge and admission to death for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), using the recently developed comprehensive database covering all regions of mainland China, and compare the results within and outside China. METHODS: The database included all probable 5327 SARS cases, of whom 343 died. Linear regression (uni- and multivariate analysis) was performed for all three durations to test the impact of the following variables: sex, age, occupation, geographic location and period of the SARS epidemic (time since the first case, i.e. 16 November 2002). RESULTS: The average duration of onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 3.8 days, of admission to discharge for those who survived was 29.7 days, while admission to death for casualties was 17.4 days. Health care workers, patients from Tianjin and patients infected towards the end of the epidemic had the shortest duration of onset to admission. Regarding admission to discharge, particularly young patients and patients from Guangdong had the shortest duration. Older age was the sole factor associated with shorter duration of admission to death. CONCLUSIONS: The average duration and pattern (with time of epidemic and age) of onset of symptoms to hospital admission of SARS patients in mainland China were comparable to other affected areas. The duration of hospital admission to discharge was shorter than elsewhere, possibly because of different hospitalisation policies. The duration of hospital admission to death in mainland China, however, appeared to be shorter than in other areas, which is in striking contrast to the much lower case fatality in mainland China.",M1
19508436,"Geographical spread of <e>SARS</e> in mainland China.OBJECTIVES: To describe the spatiotemporal diffusion of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in mainland China, and to analyse the spatial pattern of SARS transmission from the Beijing epicentre to its neighbouring areas. METHODS: Probable SARS cases occurring between November 2002 and May 2003 in mainland China were compiled from different sources and geo-coded into a geographical information database based on onset location. Spatial analyses including kernel density estimation, and spatial statistical and tracking analyses were performed to characterise the spatiotemporal distribution of SARS cases based on onset location/date. SARS cases that got infected in Beijing but were reported in three provinces surrounding Beijing were mapped, and logistic regression using a 'case-control' design at the county level was performed to analyse the impact of travel-related risk factors in the diffusion pattern. RESULTS: The SARS epidemic in mainland China spanned a large geographical extent but clustered in two areas: first in Guangdong Province, and about 3 months later in Beijing with its surrounding areas in Shanxi Province, Inner Mongolia Autonomic Region, Hebei Province and Tianjin. Counties in the neighbourhood of Beijing that were crossed by a national highway or inter-provincial freeway showed the highest risk of acquiring SARS infections, even after correction for population density and medical staff density. Being intersected by a railway did not significantly associate with risk of SARS. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides the first complete documentation of the spatial and temporal characteristics of the SARS epidemic in mainland China. Our analyses confirmed that SARS had benefited from national highways and inter-provincial freeways for its spread from epicentres to neighbouring areas, whereas trains showed no significant association. This knowledge may be important for the control of re-emerging SARS, or other future emerging human-to-human transmittable infections.",M1
19508435,"The economic impact of <e>SARS</e> in Beijing, China.OBJECTIVE: To document the impact of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak in Beijing on indicators of social and economic activity. METHODS: Associations between time series of daily and monthly SARS cases and deaths and volume of public train, airplane and cargo transport, tourism, household consumption patterns and gross domestic product growth in Beijing were investigated using the cross-correlation function. RESULTS: Significant correlation coefficients were found for all indicators except wholesale accounts and expenditures on necessities, with the most significant correlations occurring with a delay of 1 day to 1 month. CONCLUSIONS: Especially leisure activities, local and international transport and tourism were affected by SARS particularly in May 2003. Much of this consumption was merely postponed; but irrecoverable losses to the tourist sector alone were estimated at about US$ 1.4 bn, or 300 times the cost of treatment for SARS cases in Beijing.",M1
19508434,"Mathematical modelling of <e>SARS</e> and other infectious diseases in China: a review.OBJECTIVE: To give an overview of the recent history of publications on mathematical modelling of infectious diseases in the Chinese literature, and a more detailed review of the models on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). METHOD: Literature review through the Chinese CAJ full-text database. RESULTS: The number of Chinese publications on mathematical modelling has at least quadrupled since the SARS epidemic in 2003. This increase not only included papers on SARS, but also on various other infectious diseases, indicating a substantial expansion of modelling experience in China. Typical problems of most studies were poor availability of data and lack of involvement of disease experts and decision-makers rendering the studies less useful for policies on control. CONCLUSIONS: We expect that the recent experience on modelling and current better access to and exchange of epidemiological data have paved the way for a more substantial role of this discipline during possible future outbreaks of infectious diseases. By making Chinese modelling initiatives more visible to non-Chinese readers, we hope to attract more international collaborators.",M1
19505330,"The impact on neonatal mortality of shifting childbirth services among levels of hospitals: Taiwan's experience.BACKGROUND: There is considerable discussion surrounding whether advanced hospitals provide better childbirth care than local community hospitals. This study examines the effect of shifting childbirth services from advanced hospitals (i.e., medical centers and regional hospitals) to local community hospitals (i.e., clinics and district hospitals). The sample population was tracked over a seven-year period, which includes the four months of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) epidemic in Taiwan. During the SARS epidemic, pregnant women avoided using maternity services in advanced hospitals. Concerns have been raised about maintaining the quality of maternity care with increased demands on childbirth services in local community hospitals. In this study, we analyzed the impact of shifting maternity services among hospitals of different levels on neonatal mortality and maternal deaths. METHODS: A population-based study was conducted using data from Taiwan's National Health Insurance annual statistics of monthly county neonatal morality rates. Based on a pre-SARS sample from January 1998 to December 2002, we estimated a linear regression model which included  trend,  a continuous variable representing the effect of yearly changes, and two binary variables,  month  and  county,  controlling for seasonal and county-specific effects. With the estimated coefficients, we obtained predicted neonatal mortality rates for each county-month. We compared the differences between observed mortality rates of the SARS period and predicted rates to examine whether the shifting in maternity services during the SARS epidemic significantly affected neonatal mortality rates. RESULTS: With an analysis of a total of 1,848 observations between 1998 and 2004, an insignificantly negative mean of standardized predicted errors during the SARS period was found. The result of a sub-sample containing areas with advanced hospitals showed a significant negative mean of standardized predicted errors during the SARS period. These findings indicate that despite increased use of local community hospitals, neonatal mortality during the SARS epidemic did not increase, and even decreased in areas with advanced hospitals. CONCLUSION: An increased use of maternity services in local community hospitals occurred during the SARS epidemic in Taiwan. However, we observed no increase in neonatal and maternity mortality associated with these increased demands on local community hospitals.",M1
19497162,"The psychological impact of the <e>SARS</e> epidemic on hospital employees in China: exposure, risk perception, and altruistic acceptance of risk.OBJECTIVE: We examined the psychological impact of the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) on hospital employees in Beijing, China. METHODS: In 2006, randomly selected employees (n = 549) of a hospital in Beijing were surveyed concerning their exposure to the 2003 SARS outbreak, and the ways in which the outbreak had affected their mental health. RESULTS: About 10% of the respondents had experienced high levels of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms since the SARS outbreak. Respondents who had been quarantined, or worked in high-risk locations such as SARS wards, or had friends or close relatives who contracted SARS, were 2 to 3 times more likely to have high PTS symptom levels, than those without these exposures. Respondents' perceptions of SARS-related risks were significantly positively associated with PTS symptom levels and partially mediated the effects of exposure. Altruistic acceptance of work-related risks was negatively related to PTS levels. CONCLUSIONS: The psychological impact of stressful events related to an infectious disease outbreak may be mediated by peoples' perceptions of those events; altruism may help to protect some health care workers against these negative impacts.",M1

OUTCOMES: Cases reported from Asia suggest that maternal and fetal outcomes are worsened by SARS during pregnancy. EVIDENCE: Medline was searched for relevant articles published in English from 2000 to 2007. Case reports were reviewed and expert opinion sought. VALUES: Recommendations were made according to the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care. SPONSORS: The Society of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada. Recommendations 1. All hospitals should have infection control systems in place to ensure that alerts regarding changes in exposure risk factors for SARS or other potentially serious communicable diseases are conveyed promptly to clinical units, including the labour and delivery unit. (III-C) 2. At times of SARS outbreaks, all pregnant patients being assessed or admitted to the hospital should be screened for symptoms of and risk factors for SARS. (III-C) 3. Upon arrival in the labour triage unit, pregnant patients with suspected and probable SARS should be placed in a negative pressure isolation room with at least 6 air exchanges per hour. All labour and delivery units caring for suspected and probable SARS should have available at least one room in which patients can safely labour and deliver while in need of airborne isolation. (III-C) 4. If possible, labour and delivery (including operative delivery or Caesarean section) should be managed in a designated negative pressure isolation room, by designated personnel with specialized infection control preparation and protective gear. (III-C) 5. Either regional or general anaesthesia may be appropriate for delivery of patients with SARS. (III-C) 6. Neonates of mothers with SARS should be isolated in a designated unit until the infant has been well for 10 days, or until the mother's period of isolation is complete. The mother should not breastfeed during this period. (III-C) 7. A multidisciplinary team, consisting of obstetricians, nurses, pediatricians, infection control specialists, respiratory therapists, and anaesthesiologists, should be identified in each unit and be responsible for the unit organization and implementation of SARS management protocols. (III-C) 8. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should not care for other pregnant patients. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should be actively monitored for fever and other symptoms of SARS. Such individuals should not work in the presence of any SARS symptoms within 10 days of exposure to a SARS patient. (III-C) 9. All health care personnel, trainees, and support staff should be trained in infection control management and containment to prevent spread of the SARS virus. (III-A) 10. Regional health authorities in conjunction with hospital staff should consider designating specific facilities or health care units, including primary, secondary, or tertiary health care centres, to care for patients with SARS or similar illnesses.

The system evaluation was conducted on seven healthy male subjects (23 +/- 1 years). In order to achieve a pseudo-infection condition, the subjects maintained an ergometer exercise load (100 W, 10 minutes). Before (normal condition) and after (pseudo-infection condition) exercise, a significant linear discriminant function (p &lt; 0.001) was determined to distinguish pseudo-infection condition from normal condition (Mahalanobis D-square = 20.3, classification error rate &lt;5%).

19459044,"Estimating the case fatality rate using a constant cure-death hazard ratio.The case fatality rate is an important indicator of the severity of a disease, and unbiased and accurate estimates of it during an outbreak are important in the study of epidemic diseases, including severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>). In this paper, estimation methods are developed using a constant cure-death hazard ratio. A semiparametric model is presented, in which the cure-death hazard ratio is a parameter of interest, and a profile likelihood-based technique is proposed for estimating the case fatality rate. An extensive simulation was carried out to investigate the performance of this technique for small and medium sample sizes, using both summary and individual data. The results show that the performance depends on the model validity but is not heavily dependent on the sample size.

19445991,"Association of human leukocyte antigen class II alleles with severe acute respiratory syndrome in the Vietnamese population.Excessive immune response is believed to play a role in the development of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>). Inhomogeneous spread of SARS led one to think of an Asian genetic predisposition and contribution of human leukocyte antigen (HLA) to the disease susceptibility. However, past case-control studies showed inconsistent results. In Viet Nam, of 62 patients with SARS, 44 participated in the present study together with 103 individuals who had contact with SARS patients and 50 without contact history. HLA-DRB1*12 was more frequently shown in SARS patients than in controls (corrected p = 0.042). HLA-DRB1*1202, the predominant allele in the Vietnamese population showed the strongest association with SARS in a dominant model (corrected p = 0.0065 and 0.0052, depending on the controls to be compared). Our results and accumulated data on HLA in the Asian populations would help in the understanding of associations with emerging infectious diseases.",M1
19443292,"Hospitalization for ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions in Taiwan following the <e>SARS</e> outbreak: a population-based interrupted time series study.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak resulted in 8096 probable cases and 774 deaths in 26 countries. The purpose of this study was to explore the effect of the SARS outbreak on hospitalization for chronic ambulatory-care-sensitive conditions (ACSCs) in Taiwan. METHODS: We applied a population-based interrupted time series study design and used the time series auto-regressive integrated moving-average model to compare the actual and predicted admission rates of seven selected chronic ACSCs. The analyses were based on National Health Insurance hospital inpatient claims data from 1997 to 2003. RESULTS: The impact of SARS on ACSCs after the outbreak varied among seven selected chronic conditions. Hospitalization for respiratory conditions was significantly lower than the predicted values, whereas hospitalization for diabetes was significantly higher than the predicted values after the outbreak. CONCLUSION: Admission rates for most ACSCs, except for diabetes, did not change in the post-SARS period. The reductions in outpatient utilization during the SARS outbreak did not appear to affect adversely admissions for most ACSCs.",M1

19396666,"Determining <e>SARS</e> sub-clinical infection: a longitudinal seroepidemiological study in recovered SARS patients and controls after an outbreak in a general hospital.A cohort of 67 confirmed SARS patients were prospectively followed for 16 months and were compared with a control population. Serum samples taken at various times were tested for IgG and IgM; dynamic serological changes in these antibodies were described. The positive responses of IgM and IgG antibodies in sera against SARS virus from the first week to the sixth week after onset of the illness in patients with SARS were measured. The ELISA test of IgG antibody was negative in 200 community controls. The positive rate in the SARS high-risk population was 0.61% tested by ELISA and 0.21% by IFA. The high-risk population in this study was defined as those who provided health care and other services to SARS patients during the outbreak. IgG antibody in convalescent serum of patients with SARS revealed an increasing trend, peaking at the 22nd week after onset of illness followed by a slow decline. IgM appeared earlier than IgG and can be better used for early detection. IgG remained at a high level for a much longer period, serving as a good indicator for follow-up and for assessing past exposure. Our results also suggest that sub-clinical infection, if it exists, is very rare.",M1

19284644,"Which preventive measures might protect health care workers from <e>SARS</e>?BACKGROUND: Despite the use of a series of preventive measures, a high incidence of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was observed among health care workers (HCWs) during the SARS epidemic. This study aimed to determine which preventive measures may have been effective in protecting HCWs from infection, and which were not effective. METHODS: A retrospective study was performed among 758 'frontline' health care workers who cared for SARS patients at the Second Affiliated Hospital and the Third Affiliated Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University. The HCWs with IgG against SARS and those without IgG against SARS were respectively defined as the  case group  and the  control group , and logistic regression was conducted to explore the risk factors for SARS infection in HCWs. RESULTS: After adjusting for age, gender, marital status, educational level, professional title, and the department in which an individual worked, the results of a multivariate logistic regression analysis indicated that incidence of SARS among HCWs was significantly and positively associated with: performing tracheal intubations for SARS patients, methods used for air ventilation in wards, avoiding face-to-face interaction with SARS patients, the number of pairs of gloves worn by HCWs, and caring for serious SARS cases. CONCLUSION: Some measures, particularly good air ventilation in SARS wards, may be effective in minimizing or preventing SARS transmission among HCWs in hospitals.",M1
19277874,"The perceived threat of <e>SARS</e> and its impact on precautionary actions and adverse consequences: a qualitative study among Chinese communities in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands.BACKGROUND: Although the SARS outbreak involved few probable cases of infection in Europe, swift international spread of infections raised the possibility of outbreaks. In particular, SARS presented a sociopsychological and economic threat to European Chinese communities because of their close links with the outbreak's origins. METHODS: A qualitative study was conducted among Chinese residents in the United Kingdom and the Netherlands to identify the origins of SARS risk perceptions and their impact on precautionary actions and adverse consequences from the perspective of vulnerable communities living in unaffected regions. Analysis was informed by protection motivation theory. RESULTS: Results revealed that information from affected Asia influenced risk perceptions and protective behavior among the Chinese in Europe when more relevant local information was absent. When high risk perceptions were combined with low efficacy regarding precautionary measures, avoidance-based precautionary action appeared to dominate responses to SARS. These actions may have contributed to the adverse impacts of SARS on the communities. CONCLUSIONS: Experiences of European Chinese communities suggest that practical and timely information, and consistent implementation of protective measures from central governments are essential to protect vulnerable populations in unaffected regions from unnecessary alarm and harm during outbreaks of emerging infections.",M1
19247834,"Mental Symptoms in Different Health Professionals During the <e>SARS</e> Attack: A Follow-up Study.AIM: The aims of the study were to assess the psychological impact of SARS bio-disaster on healthcare workers. METHODS: The participants were 127 healthcare workers who had taken care of suspected SARS patients. All participants completed the Chinese Health Questionnaire (CHQ), Eysenck Personality Questionnaire, and Parental Bonding Instrument at the first stage and the CHQ again a year later. RESULTS: Healthcare workers that had mental symptoms at follow-up reported the symptoms were associated with daily-life stress and not the SARS crisis. The physicians had more somatic symptoms than nurses, suggesting different professions have different impact on mental health. Additionally, individual's early maternal attachment and neuroticism were found to have greater effect on mental health of life-threatening stress. CONCLUSIONS: Life-threatening and daily-life stress show two different patterns of influence on mental health.

19241893,"Cocktail therapy for hip necrosis in <e>SARS</e> patients.BACKGROUND: There are no treatment guidelines for hip necrosis in severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) patients. A new regimen of cocktail therapy that consists of extracorporeal shockwave therapy (ESWT), hyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBO) and oral alendronate was utilized in four patients with eight hips. This study evaluated the outcomes of cocktail therapy with a 4-year followup. METHODS: There were 3 women and 1 man with an average age of 26 +/- 3.8 years. Each hip was treated with 6000 impulses of ESWT at 0.62 mJ/mm2 energy flux density in a single session. Each patient received HBO treatment for 100 sessions and oral alendronate for one year. The evaluations included pain score and Harris hip score, radiographs and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the affected hips. RESULTS: At the 4-year follow-up, significant improvements in pain score and Harris hip score were observed in all cases (p &lt; 0.001). All patients returned to work as healthcare providers. None required surgical intervention including hip replacement. MRI showed a trend of reduction in bone marrow edema and the size of the lesion, but no changes in the stage of the lesion. CONCLUSION: Cocktail therapy seems promising in delaying the disease progression of SARS-associated femoral head necrosis in the short-term.",M1
19214752,"Risk perceptions related to <e>SARS</e> and avian influenza: theoretical foundations of current empirical research.BACKGROUND: The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 and the subsequent emergence of the H5N1 virus have highlighted the threat of a global pandemic influenza outbreak. Planning effective public health control measures for such a case will be highly dependent on sound theory-based research on how people perceive the risks involved in such an event. PURPOSE: The present article aims to review theoretical models and concepts underlying current empirical research on pandemic influenza risk perception. METHOD: A review was conducted based on 28 empirical studies from 30 articles which were published between 2003 and 2007. RESULTS: Concepts of risk perception mostly seemed more pragmatic than theory-based and were highly heterogeneous, for instance, in terms of conceptualizing risk perception as an exclusively cognitive or as a cognitive and emotional phenomenon or whether the concept was dominated by expectancy or expectancy and value components. Similarly, the majority of studies investigating risk perceptions and protective behaviors were not model-based. CONCLUSIONS: The current body of knowledge can only provide preliminary insights. Unlike the reviewed studies, which were mostly launched as a rapid response to outbreak situations, future research will have to invest more strongly into theoretical work to provide sounder evidence.",M1

DESIGN: A survey using a self-administered questionnaire was conducted on 300 printing company workers in Beijing, China, which was under mass isolation following the 2003 SARS outbreak, in the 7-8 months after the isolation was lifted. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Individuals with psychological disorders were classified on the basis of scores on the 30-item General Health Questionnaire during the recovery period. Psychological disorders were observed in 49 of 187 respondents (26.2%; 95% CI = 20.2, 32.7). RESULTS: The predicting factor with the highest correlation was income reduction, with an odds ratio of 25.0. Other items obtained were gender, range of activities, eating restrictions, restrictions in going out, disinfection of clothing, and infection control, with odds ratios of 3.2, 5.5, 3.9, 3.2, 0.2, and 0.1, respectively, and the contribution ratio was 87.7%.

DESIGN: Before-and-after study. SETTING: A 472-bed, urban, university-affiliated hospital.Intervention. During the period March-May 2004, all hospital staff completed a mandatory infection control education program, including the receipt of hospital-specific MRSA data and case-based practice with additional precautions. OUTCOME MEASURE: The rate of nosocomial MRSA acquisition was calculated as the number of cases of nosocomial MRSA acquisition per 100 days that a person with MRSA colonization or infection detected at admission is present in the hospital ( admission MRSA  exposure-days) for 3 time periods: June 2002-February 2003 (before the Toronto outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome [<e>SARS</e>]), June 2003-February 2004 (after the outbreak of SARS), and June 2004-February 2005 (after education). A case of nosocomial acquisition of MRSA colonization or infection represented a patient first identified as colonized or infected more than 72 hours after admission or at admission after a previous hospitalization. RESULTS: The rate of nosocomial acquisition of MRSA colonization or infection was 8.8 cases per 100 admission MRSA exposure-days for the period before SARS, 3.8 cases per 100 admission MRSA exposure-days for the period after SARS (P&lt;.001 for before SARS vs after SARS), and 1.9 cases per 100 admission MRSA exposure-days for the period after education (P=.02 for after education vs before education). The volume of alcohol-based handrub purchased was apparently stable, with 4,010 L during fiscal year 2003-2004 (April 2003-March 2004) compared with 3,780 L during fiscal year 2004-2005. The observed rate of compliance with hand washing did not change significantly (40.9% during education vs 44.2% after education; P=.23). The total number of patients screened for MRSA colonization was not different in the 3 periods. CONCLUSIONS: The rate of nosocomial acquisition of MRSA colonization or infection decreased after SARS and was further reduced in association with a hospital-wide education program.",M1
19199189,"Healthcare-associated atypical pneumonia.Atypical pneumonia was first described in 1938, and over time, Mycoplasma, Legionella, and Chlamydophila were the agents commonly linked with community-associated atypical pneumonia. However, as technology has improved, so has our understanding of this clinical entity. It is now known that there are many agents linked with atypical pneumonia in the community, and many of these agents are also major causes of healthcare-associated pneumonia. This article discusses the history, epidemiology, and pathogenesis of infection; control of infection; clinical findings; diagnosis; and, where applicable, treatment of the agents of healthcare-associated atypical pneumonia. Bacterial agents include Legionella species, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila species, and Coxiella burnetii. Although there are over 100 viruses that can cause respiratory tract infections, only a fraction of those have been defined in the context of healthcare-associated atypical pneumonia: adenovirus and human bocavirus (HBoV); rhinovirus; human coronaviruses (HCoV), including HCoV 229E, HCoV OC43, HCoV NL63, HCoV HKU1; members of the paramyxoviridae (parainfluenza viruses, human metapneumovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus); hantavirus; influenza; and severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) Co-V.

PURPOSE: The study compares SARS knowledge, perceptions, behaviors, and information between Finns and the Dutch during the SARS outbreak in 2003. METHOD: The participants of the study, who used a modified SARS Psychosocial Research Consortium survey, were drawn from Internet panels in Finland (n = 308) and the Netherlands (n = 373) in June 2003. Multiple logistic regression analyses were used to calculate odds ratios (with 95% confidence intervals) to compare Finns with the Dutch for various levels of perceptions and behaviors. RESULTS: Adjusted for age, education, and income, Finns were more likely to be knowledgeable and worried about SARS as well as to have low perceived comparative SARS risk and poor personal efficacy beliefs about preventing SARS. Finns were also more likely than the Dutch to have high confidence in physicians on SARS issues but less likely to have received information from the Internet and have confidence in Internet information. CONCLUSIONS: The study shed light on how two European populations differed substantially regarding lay responses to SARS. Understanding these differences is needed in formulating and executing communication and outbreak management.",M1

To engage them in precautionary actions, it is important to know their information sources, knowledge, and health beliefs. PURPOSE: This study's purpose is to study the use of information sources, knowledge, and health beliefs related to SARS and avian flu of Chinese people in the UK and The Netherlands, and to make comparisons with the general population in these countries. METHOD: Results of a self-administered questionnaire among 300 British/Dutch Chinese were compared to data obtained from a computer-assisted phone survey among the general population (n = 800). RESULTS: British/Dutch Chinese got most information about emerging diseases from family and friends, followed by Chinese media and British/Dutch TV. They had less confidence than general groups in their doctor, government agencies, and consumer/patient interest groups. Their knowledge of SARS was high. They had a lower perceived threat than general populations with regard to SARS and avian flu due to a lower perceived severity. They had higher self-efficacy beliefs regarding SARS and avian flu. CONCLUSION: In case of new outbreaks of SARS/avian flu in China, local authorities in the UK and The Netherlands can best reach Chinese people through informal networks and British/Dutch TV, while trying to improve confidence in information from the government. In communications, the severity of the disease rather than the susceptibility appears to need most attention.",M1
19166639,"Use of personal protective equipment during infectious disease outbreak and nonoutbreak conditions: a survey of emergency medical technicians.OBJECTIVE: We sought to assess the knowledge of, use of and barriers to the use of personal protective equipment for airway management among emergency medical technicians (EMTs) during and since the 2003 Canadian outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (<e>SARS</e>). METHODS: Using a cross-sectional survey, EMTs in Toronto, Ont., were surveyed 1 year after the SARS outbreak during mandatory training on the use of personal protective equipment in airway management during the outbreak and just before taking the survey. Practices that were addressed reflected government directives on the use of this equipment. Main outcome measures included the frequency of personal protective equipment use and, as applicable, why particular items were not always used. RESULTS: The response rate was 67.3% (n = 230). During the SARS outbreak, an N95-type particulate respirator was reported to be always used by 91.5% of respondents. Conversely, 72.9% of the respondents reported that they never used the open face hood. Equipment availability and vision impairment were often cited as impediments to personal protective equipment use. In nonoutbreak conditions, only the antimicrobial airway filter was most often reported to be always used (52.0%), while other items were used at an intermediate frequency. The most common reason for not always donning equipment was that paramedics deemed it unnecessary for the situation. CONCLUSION: Personal protective equipment is not consistently employed as per medical directives. Reasons given for nonuse included nonavailability, judgment of nonnecessity or technical difficulties. There are important public health implications of noncompliance.",M1

Higher levels of perceived threats of diseases were associated with increases in a variety of ways of coping, including empathic responding and wishful thinking. In turn, we examined how coping with the perceived health threat was related to two specific health related behaviours: taking recommended precautions, and avoiding people in an attempt to avoid disease. The findings from linear regression indicated that empathic responding, in response to the threat of a virulent agent, was related to taking recommended and effective health precautions. On the other hand, wishful thinking was associated with those behaviours that may potentially lead to economic hardship in afflicted areas, such as avoiding people perceived to be at risk for an infectious agent. Implications for health promotion are discussed.",M1

19153928,"China engages global health governance: processes and dilemmas.Using HIV/AIDS, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (<e>SARS</e>), and avian influenza as case studies, this paper discusses the processes and dilemmas of China's participation in health governance, both at the domestic level and the global level. Globalization has eroded the boundary between public and private health and between domestic and global health governance. In addition, the SARS outbreak of 2002-2003 focused global attention on China's public health. As a rising power with the largest population on earth, China is expected by the international community to play a better and more active role in health management. Since the turn of this century, China has increasingly embraced multilateralism in health governance. This paper argues that China's multilateral cooperation is driven by both necessity and conscious design. International concerns about good governance and its aspiration to become a 'responsible' state have exerted a normative effect on China to change tack. Its interactions with United Nations agencies have triggered a learning process for China to securitize the spread of infectious diseases as a security threat. Conversely, China has utilized multilateralism to gain access to international resources and technical assistance. It is still a matter of debate whether China's cooperative engagement with global health governance can endure, because of the persistent problems of withholding information on disease outbreaks and because of its insistence on the Westphalian notion of sovereignty.",M1
19149392,"Applying the lessons of <e>SARS</e> to pandemic influenza: an evidence-based approach to mitigating the stress experienced by healthcare workers.We describe an evidence-based approach to enhancing the resilience of healthcare workers in preparation for an influenza pandemic, based on evidence about the stress associated with working in healthcare during the SARS outbreak. SARS was associated with significant long-term stress in healthcare workers, but not with increased mental illness. Reducing pandemic-related stress may best be accomplished through interventions designed to enhance resilience in psychologically healthy people. Applicable models to improve adaptation in individuals include Folkman and Greer's framework for stress appraisal and coping along with psychological first aid. Resilience is supported at an organizational level by effective training and support, development of material and relational reserves, effective leadership, the effects of the characteristics of  magnet hospitals,  and a culture of organizational justice. Evidence supports the goal of developing and maintaining an organizational culture of resilience in order to reduce the expected stress of an influenza pandemic on healthcare workers. This recommendation goes well beyond the provision of adequate training and counseling. Although the severity of a pandemic is unpredictable, this effort is not likely to be wasted because it will also support the health of both patients and staff in normal times.",M1

This study evaluated infrared thermography (IRT) and compared the influence of different imagers, ambient temperature discrepancy, and the distance between the subject and imager. METHODS: IRT-digital infrared thermal imaging (IRT-DITI), thermoguard, and ear drum IRT were used for visitors to Municipal Wang Fang Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. The McNemar and Chi-squared test, standard Pearson correlation, ANOVA, intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC), and receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) analysis were used to calculate the alarm temperature for each imager. RESULTS: A total of 1032 subjects were recruited. Different distances and ambient temperature discrepancy had a significant influence on thermoguard, and lateral and frontal view DITI. By ICC analysis, a significant difference was found at 10 m distance between ear drum IRT and thermoguard (r = 0.45), lateral view DITI (r = 0.37), and frontal view DITI (r = 0.44). With ROC analysis, the optimal preset cut-off temperatures for the different imagers were: 36.05 degrees C for thermoguard (area under the curve [AUC], 0.716), 36.25 degrees C for lateral view DITI (AUC, 0.801), and 36.25 degrees C for frontal view DITI (AUC, 0.812). CONCLUSION: The temperature readings obtained by IRT may be used as a proxy for core temperature. An effective IRT system with a strict operating protocol can be rapidly implemented at the entrance of a hospital during SARS or avian influenza epidemics.",M1
19125335,"Perceived threat, risk perception, and efficacy beliefs related to <e>SARS</e> and other (emerging) infectious diseases: results of an international survey.PURPOSE: To study the levels of perceived threat, perceived severity, perceived vulnerability, response efficacy, and self-efficacy for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and eight other diseases in five European and three Asian countries. METHOD: A computer-assisted phone survey was conducted among 3,436 respondents. The questionnaire focused on perceived threat, vulnerability, severity, response efficacy, and self-efficacy related to SARS and eight other diseases. RESULTS: Perceived threat of SARS in case of an outbreak in the country was higher than that of other diseases. Perceived vulnerability of SARS was at an intermediate level and perceived severity was high compared to other diseases. Perceived threat for SARS varied between countries in Europe and Asia with a higher perceived severity of SARS in Europe and a higher perceived vulnerability in Asia. Response efficacy and self-efficacy for SARS were higher in Asia compared to Europe. In multiple linear regression analyses, country was strongly associated with perceived threat. CONCLUSIONS: The relatively high perceived threat for SARS indicates that it is seen as a public health risk and offers a basis for communication in case of an outbreak. The strong association between perceived threat and country and different regional patterns require further research.",M1
19079846,"An approach to estimate the number of <e>SARS</e> cases imported by international air travel.The worldwide spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) raised questions about the risk of importation of such infection, in particular by air travel. Entry screening was implemented in some countries although poor evidence on its effectiveness is reported. We developed a model to estimate the number of imported SARS cases between regions, using the 2003 SARS epidemic data to apply this model for two scenarios: from Beijing to Frankfurt and from Hong Kong to London. We back-calculated the data to estimate individuals' time of infection and built a model where every individual has a probability of being isolated, of traveling, and of being undetected at arrival. The findings, consistent with what was observed in 2003, suggest that entry screening does not affect the predicted number of imported cases. Inversely, importation depends on the transmission dynamic in the country of origin (including control measures in place) and on the intensity of air travel between regions.",M1

It was particularly frightening to the Chinese-Canadians, because of the origin of the deadly disease. The Chinese-Canadian community organizations launched various activities to help the Chinese-Canadians as well as other Asian-Canadian communities to fight against SARS and its social side-effects. From launching the SARS Supporting Line, distributing health promotional material, disseminating SARS related information, paying tribute to frontline health workers, and promoting local business, to fundraising for SARS related research; they played an active role in easing the public's anxiety, especially for the Chinese-Canadians in the great Toronto area. The culturally diverse population brought problems as well as solutions. Ethnic groups have expertise in almost all areas, including people with leadership skills. The Toronto Chinese community's experience in combating SARS is a good example. The Chinese-Canadian community organizations' activities during the SARS outbreak demonstrate that ethnic minority organizations can play an important role in public health, especially in a public health crisis, and beyond.",M1
19056023,"Characteristic features and outcomes of severe acute respiratory syndrome found in severe acute respiratory syndrome intensive care unit patients.PURPOSE: The aim of the study was to identify characteristic clinical features and outcomes of critically ill patients with confirmed severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>). MATERIALS AND METHODS: This retrospective study enrolled all patients admitted to a 12-bed SARS intensive care unit (ICU) in a tertiary care medical center in Taipei between May 15 and July 17, 2003. Patients with positive results of either reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction or antibody to SARS coronavirus were defined as SARS cases and others with negative results as control cases. RESULTS: Of the 50 patients, 14 had confirmed SARS. Demographics were similar between the 2 groups. The highest leukocyte and neutrophil counts, lactate dehydrogenase, and creatine kinase; positive end-expiratory pressure; and use of corticosteroids, ribavirin, and intravenous immunoglobulin were higher in the SARS group. In contrast, the lowest lymphocyte count and the ratio of Pao(2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen were lower in the SARS group. Of the 15 deaths in the control group, 12 (80%) occurred during the first 2 weeks after ICU admission. However, in the confirmed SARS group, 5 (55.6%) of the 9 deaths occurred within the third or fourth week. This difference in timing between these 2 groups was significant (P = .004). CONCLUSIONS: In a SARS ICU, patients with a confirmed diagnosis of SARS had significantly different clinical features and timing of mortality from those of the control group.",M1

METHODS: 2-DE and MALDI-TOF MS were used to study the comparative serum proteomics among female SARS AVNFH group, female SARS non-AVNFH group and female healthy group. ELISA method was used to detect serum amyloid P component in individual serum; specificity and sensitivity of serum amyloid P component were analyzed. RESULTS: Average protein points on 2-DE of 3 groups were 632 +/- 28, 671 +/- 55, 688 +/- 42 respectively, and the matching rate of protein points was ranged from 85% to 95%; eighteen differentially expressed proteins were discovered including transthyretin, serpin peptidase inhibitor, alpha-1-antitrypsin precursor, serum amyloid P components, etc. Compared to healthy group and SARS non-AVNFH group, transthyretin, C4B3, fibrinogen gamma, apolipoprotein L, apolipoprotein A-IV precursor, albumin and prealbumin showed lower expression, inversely serpin peptidase inhibitor, alpha-1-antitrypsin precursor and serum amyloid P components showed higher expression in serum in the SARS AVNFH necrosis group. The serum amyloid P component in 3 groups were 0.54 +/- 0.30 ng/ml, 0.83 +/- 0.39 ng/ml, 1.21 +/- 0.29 ng/ml respectively. The areas under the ROC curve on serum amyloid P component was 0.854, the specificity was 77.8% and the sensitivity was 85.2%. CONCLUSION: There were differentially expressed serum proteins in three groups. Serum amyloid P components might be one of the potential biomarkers in serum of recovered SARS patients complicating avascular necrosis of femoral head.",M1

The Personal Wellbeing Index (PWI), a contemporary instrument employed to measure SWB, was also examined for its psychometric performance to substantiate its use. METHOD: A total of 302 older adults (age 65 + years) and 158 younger adults (age 35-46 years) were recruited from different districts. Data were collected by individual face-to-face interviews. RESULT: While elderly people living in severely infected districts showed significantly lower levels of SWB, these levels and those of the younger sample were found to remain within the normative range. A major mitigating factor was an increased sense of community-connectedness. Other characteristics linked to low wellbeing levels included chronic illness, female gender, low education and unemployment. The living districts, characterized by varying extents of infection, had stronger associations with SWB than participants' age. The PWI demonstrated good psychometric performance and also more robustness with elderly people, including its sensitivity to the sense of population threat. CONCLUSION: Psychological resilience was identified among both the elderly and younger age-groups in Hong Kong during the SARS pandemic. The PWI is verified as a suitable instrument for SWB measurements.",M1
18990210,"The impact of <e>SARS</e> on hospital performance.BACKGROUND: During the SARS epidemic, healthcare utilization and medical services decreased significantly. However, the long-term impact of SARS on hospital performance needs to be further discussed. METHODS: A municipal hospital in Taipei City was shut down for a month due to SARS and then became the designated SARS and infectious disease hospital for the city. This study collected the outpatient, inpatient and emergency service volumes for every year from April to March over four years. Average monthly service amount +/- standard deviation were used to compare patient volume for the whole hospital, as well as the outpatient numbers accessing different departments. The ARIMA model of outpatient volume in the pre-SARS year was developed. RESULTS: The average monthly service volume of outpatient visits for the base year 2002 was 52317 +/- 4204 visits per month, and number for 2003 and the following two years were 55%, 82% and 84% of the base year respectively. The average emergency service volume was 4382 +/- 356 visits per month at the base year and this became 45%, 77% and 87% of the base year for the following three years respectively. Average inpatient service volume was 8520 +/- 909 inpatient days per month at the base year becoming 43%, 81% and 87% of the base year for the following three years respectively. Only the emergency service volume had recovered to the level of a non-significant difference at the second year after SARS. In addition, the departments of family medicine, metabolism and nephrology reached the 2002 patient number in 2003. The ARIMA (2,1,0) model was the most suitable for outpatient volume in pre-SARS year. The MAPE of the ARIMA (2,1,0) model for the pre-SARS year was 6.9%, and 43.2%, 10.6%, 6.2% for following 3 years. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that if a hospital is completely shut down due to SARS or a similar disease, the impact is longer than previous reported and different departments may experience different recover periods. The findings of this study identify subspecialties that are particularly vulnerable in an infectious disease designated hospital and such hospitals need to consider which subspecialties should be included in their medical structure.",M1

18834747,"A comparison of infection control program resources, activities, and antibiotic resistant organism rates in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999 and 2005: pre- and post-severe acute respiratory syndrome.BACKGROUND: The Resources for Infection Control in Hospitals (RICH) project assessed infection control programs and rates of antibiotic-resistant organisms (AROs) in Canadian acute care hospitals in 1999. In the meantime, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) outbreak and the concern over pandemic influenza have stimulated considerable government and health care institutional efforts to improve infection control systems in Canada. METHODS: In 2006, a version of the RICH survey similar to the original RICH instrument was mailed to infection control programs in all Canadian acute care hospitals with 80 or more beds. We used chi(2), analysis of variance, and analysis of covariance analyses to test for differences between the 1999 and 2005 samples for infection control program components and ARO rates. RESULTS: 72.3% of Canadian acute care hospitals completed the RICH survey for 1999 and 60.1% for 2005. Hospital size was controlled for in analyses involving AROs and surveillance and control intensity levels. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) rates increased from 1999 to 2005 (F = 9.4, P = .003). In 2005, the mean MRSA rate was 5.2 (standard deviation [SD], 6.1) per 1000 admissions, and, in 1999, it was 2.0 (SD, 2.9). Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea rates trended up from 1999 to 2005 (F = 2.9, P = .09). In 2005, the mean Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhea rate was 4.7 (SD, 4.3), and, in 1999, it was 3.8 (SD, 4.3). The proportion of hospitals that reported having new nosocomial vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus (VRE) cases was greater in 2005 than in 1999 (chi(2) = 10.5, P = .001). In 1999, 34.5% (40/116) of hospitals reported having new nosocomial VRE cases, and, in 2005, 61.0% (64/105) reported new cases. Surveillance intensity index scores increased from a mean of 61.7 (SD, 18.5) in 1999 to 68.1 (SD, 15.4) in 2005 (F = 4.1, P = .04). Control intensity index scores trended upward slightly from a mean of 60.8 (SD, 14.6) in 1999 to 64.1 (SD, 12.2) in 2005 (F = 3.2, P = .07). Infection control professionals (ICP) full-time equivalents (FTEs) per 100 beds increased from a mean of 0.5 (SD, 0.2) in 1999 to 0.8 (SD, 0.3) in 2005 (F = 90.8, P &lt; .0001). However, the proportion of ICPs in hospitals certified by the Certification Board of Infection Control decreased from 53% (SD, 46) in 1999 to 38% (SD, 36) in 2005 (F = 8.7, P = .004). CONCLUSION: Canadian infection control programs in 2005 continued to fall short of expert recommendations for human resources and surveillance and control activities. Meanwhile, nosocomial MRSA rates more than doubled between 1999 and 2005, and hospitals reporting new nosocomial VRE cases increased 77% over the same period. Although investments have been made toward infection control programs in Canadian acute care hospitals, the rapid rise in ICP positions has not yet translated into marked improvements in surveillance and control activities. In the face of substantial increases in ARO rates in Canada, continued efforts to train ICPs and support hospital infection control programs are necessary.",M1
18823193,"Psychological resilience and dysfunction among hospitalized survivors of the <e>SARS</e> epidemic in Hong Kong: a latent class approach.OBJECTIVE: To examine trajectories of psychological functioning using latent class analysis on a sample of hospitalized survivors of the 2003 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic in Hong Kong. DESIGN: A longitudinal study of 997 survivors, recruited from among 1,331 individuals hospitalized for SARS, were interviewed at 6, 12, and 18 months after hospitalization. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Psychological and physical functioning at each time point was measured using the 12-item Medical Outcome Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). RESULTS: Four latent classes were identified--chronic dysfunction, delayed dysfunction, recovery, and resilience. All groups had better physical health than the chronic group. Resilient and recovered individuals had greater social support and less SARS-related worry, and resilient individuals were more likely to be male. The resilient group also had greater social support than the delayed group and better physical functioning than the recovered group. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that longitudinal outcome trajectories following a major health-threat event in an Asian sample bear close resemblance to prototypical trajectories observed in trauma studies using Western samples. Unique predictors of the trajectories included factors observed in previous studies, such as social support, as well as factors of particular relevance to a major disease outbreak, such as SARS-related worry.",M1
18810628,"Comparative sequence analyses of a new mammalian reovirus genome and the mammalian reovirus S1 genes from six new serotype 2 human isolates.We previously described isolation of a potentially new mammalian reovirus, designated BYD1, which can cause clinical symptoms similar to that of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) in guinea pigs and macaques, from throat swabs of one SARS patient of Beijing, in 2003. For this study, we determined the genome sequences of BYD1 and the S1 gene sequences of other five mammalian reovirus isolates (BLD, JP, and BYL were isolated from different SARS patients during the outbreak, 302I and 302II were isolated from fecal specimens of two children of Beijing in 1982) to allow molecular comparison with other previously reported mammalian reoviruses (MRVs). Comparative analyses of the BYD1 genome with those of three prototype mammalian reovirus strains demonstrated that BYD1 is a novel reassortant virus, with its S1 gene segment coming from a previously unidentified serotype 2 isolate and other nine segments coming from ancestors of homologous T1L and T3D segments, which supports the hypothesis that mammalian reovirus gene segments reassort in nature. Further analyses of the S1 segments of the six isolates showed that all the isolates are novel serotype 2 MRVs based on their S1 gene sequences, which are markedly different from those of all previously reported, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share more than 99% identity with each other, proving that they diverged from a common ancestor most recently, and the S1 genes of the four new isolates share about 65% identity with those of the two strains isolated in 1982.",M1
18790829,"Alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms among hospital employees exposed to a <e>SARS</e> outbreak.AIMS: The aim of this study was to examine alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms among hospital employees exposed to a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak, and the relationship between types of exposure to the SARS outbreak and subsequent alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. METHODS: A survey was conducted among 549 randomly selected hospital employees in Beijing, China, concerning the psychological impact of the 2003 SARS outbreak. Subjects were assessed on sociodemographic factors and types of exposure to the outbreak, and on symptoms of post-traumatic stress (PTS), alcohol abuse/dependence and depression. RESULTS: Current alcohol abuse/dependence symptom counts 3 years after the outbreak were positively associated with having been quarantined, or worked in high-risk locations such as SARS wards, during the outbreak. However, having had family members or friends contract, SARS was not related to alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count. Symptoms of PTS and of depression, and having used drinking as a coping method, were also significantly associated with increased alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. The relationship between outbreak exposure and alcohol abuse/dependence symptom count remained significant even when sociodemographic and other factors were controlled for. When the intrusion, avoidance and hyperarousal PTS symptom clusters were entered into the model, hyperarousal was found to be significantly associated with alcohol abuse/dependence symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Exposure to an outbreak of a severe infectious disease can, like other disaster exposures, lead not only to PTSD but also to other psychiatric conditions, such as alcohol abuse/dependence. The findings will help policy makers and health professionals to better prepare for potential outbreaks of diseases such as SARS or avian flu.",M1
18776932,"Sampling for global epidemic models and the topology of an international airport network.Mathematical models that describe the global spread of infectious diseases such as influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>), and tuberculosis (TB) often consider a sample of international airports as a network supporting disease spread. However, there is no consensus on how many cities should be selected or on how to select those cities. Using airport flight data that commercial airlines reported to the Official Airline Guide (OAG) in 2000, we have examined the network characteristics of network samples obtained under different selection rules. In addition, we have examined different size samples based on largest flight volume and largest metropolitan populations. We have shown that although the bias in network characteristics increases with the reduction of the sample size, a relatively small number of areas that includes the largest airports, the largest cities, the most-connected cities, and the most central cities is enough to describe the dynamics of the global spread of influenza. The analysis suggests that a relatively small number of cities (around 200 or 300 out of almost 3000) can capture enough network information to adequately describe the global spread of a disease such as influenza. Weak traffic flows between small airports can contribute to noise and mask other means of spread such as the ground transportation.",M1
18757967,"Steroid-induced osteonecrosis: the number of lesions is related to the dosage.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) is a newly described infectious disease caused by the SARS coronavirus which attacks the immune system and pulmonary epithelium. It is treated with regular high doses of corticosteroids. Our aim was to determine the relationship between the dosage of steroids and the number and distribution of osteonecrotic lesions in patients treated with steroids during the SARS epidemic in Beijing, China in 2003. We identified 114 patients for inclusion in the study. Of these, 43 with osteonecrosis received a significantly higher cumulative and peak methylprednisolone-equivalent dose than 71 patients with no osteonecrosis identified by MRI. We confirmed that the number of osteonecrotic lesions was directly related to the dosage of steroids and that a very high dose, a peak dose of more than 200 mg or a cumulative methylprednisolone-equivalent dose of more than 4000 mg, is a significant risk factor for multifocal osteonecrosis with both epiphyseal and diaphyseal lesions. Patients with diaphyseal osteonecrosis received a significantly higher cumulative methylprednisolone-equivalent dose than those with epiphyseal osteonecrosis. Multifocal osteonecrosis should be suspected if a patient is diagnosed with osteonecrosis in the shaft of a long bone.",M1

OBJECTIVES: We assessed whether there were unintended health consequences to seriously ill hospitalized patients. STUDY DESIGN, SETTING, AND POPULATION: Population-based longitudinal cohort study of patients residing in Toronto or an urban control region with an incident admission for 1 of 7 serious conditions in the 3 years before, or the 4 months during or after restrictions. OUTCOME MEASURES: Short-term mortality, overall readmissions, cardiac readmissions for acute myocardial infarction patients, serious complications for very low birth weight babies, and quality of care measures, comparing adjusted rates across time periods within regions. RESULTS: Mortality, readmission, and complication rates did not change for any condition during or after severe acute respiratory syndrome restrictions. Although rates of invasive cardiac procedures for acute myocardial infarction patients decreased 11-37% in Toronto, rates of nonfatal cardiac outcomes did not change. CONCLUSIONS: Restrictions on non-urgent hospital utilization and hospital transfers may be a safe public health strategy to employ to control nosocomial outbreaks or provide hospital surge capacity for up to several months, in large, well-developed healthcare systems with good availability of community-based care.",M1

METHODS: We performed three-phase bone scintigraphy of femoral head regions and whole-body bone scan in SARS patients 4-6 months after they recovered from the syndrome, and then compared the results with simultaneous MRI. RESULTS: Typical avascular necrosis at different stages and severities was found on bone scintigraphy at 31 femoral heads of 16 SARS patients, 97% of which were MRI positive. Suspicious necrosis was found at 42 femoral heads of 23 patients, 67% of which were MRI negative. Among 30 patients with normal three-phase scintigraphic results, 10% of whom were suspicious on MRI. In addition, abnormal distributions of radioactivity were observed in other bones on the whole-body bone scans of 29 patients, including osteonecrosis of knees in 15 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Radionuclide bone scintigraphy is valuable in early diagnosis of osteonecrosis in SARS patients in convalescence. It provides a mutually supplementary tool for MRI.",M1
18618066,"Risk communications: in search of a pandemic.This paper explores the difficulties in managing risk communications in the face of uncertainty of an avian flu pandemic over a protracted period. The communications effort has also been made more difficult by the confusion and cacophony in the media and claims by experts and politicians worldwide. While Singapore secured much praise for its handling of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) just 4 years earlier which threatened its very existence as a nation-state, it also had to  unlearn  and  unfix  assumptions and mindsets that grew out of that experience. A protracted crisis of uncertainty has also raised difficult questions of sustaining public awareness and alertness. Compounding these problems is the seemingly high reliance of Singaporeans on Government to manage the crisis at all stages. Risk communications has become a crucial necessity in an increasingly troubled world and evokes contradictions for many in medicine and public health - calling on Governments to raise the alarm whilst also calming fears at the same time. It is hoped that Singapore's experience throws up some useful lessons for other countries. The basic principles of risk communications employed are in line with the best practices adopted by many other countries. The experience may also contribute to the ongoing and somewhat contentious debate on whether the manner in which Singapore manages the information flow can be replicated or applied by other states and cultures.",M1
18615412,"Bayesian analysis of severe acute respiratory syndrome: the 2003 Hong Kong epidemic.This paper analyzes data arising from a Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) epidemic in Hong Kong in 2003 involving 1755 cases. A discrete time stochastic model that uses a back-projection approach is proposed. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods are developed for estimation of model parameters. The algorithm is further extended to integrate numerically over unobserved variables of the model. Applying the method to SARS data from Hong Kong, a value of 3.88 with a posterior standard deviation of 0.09 was estimated for the basic reproduction number. An estimate of the transmission parameter at the beginning of the epidemic was also obtained as 0.149 with a posterior standard deviation of 0.003. A reduction in the transmission parameter during the course of the epidemic forced the effective reproduction number to cross the threshold value of one, seven days after control interventions were introduced. At the end of the epidemic, the effective reproduction number was as low as 0.001 suggesting that the epidemic was brought under control by the intervention measures introduced.",M1
18583213,"Certainties and uncertainties facing emerging respiratory infectious diseases: lessons from <e>SARS</e>.Every emerging infectious disease is a challenge to the whole of mankind. There are uncertainties regarding whether there will be a pandemic, if it will be caused by the highly pathogenic H5N1 influenza virus, when or where it will occur, how imminent or how severe it will be. No one can accurately predict if and when a given virus will become a pandemic virus. Pandemic prevention strategies must be based on preparing for the unexpected and being capable of reacting accordingly. There is growing evidence that infection control measures were helpful in containment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) as well as avian influenza. Compliance of standard infection control measures, intensive promotion of hand and respiratory hygiene, vigilance and triage of patients with febrile illness, and specific infection control measures are key components to contain a highly contagious disease in hospital and to protect healthcare workers, patients and visitors. The importance of standard precautions for any patient and cleaning and disinfection for the healthcare environment cannot be overemphasized. SARS illustrated dramatically the potential of air travel and globalization for the dissemination of an emerging infectious disease. To prevent the potential serious consequences of pandemic influenza, timely implementation of pharmaceutical and non-pharmaceutical interventions locally within the outbreak area is the key to minimizing global spread. Herein, we relate our perspective on useful lessons derived from a review of the SARS epidemic that may be useful to physicians, especially when looking ahead to the next epidemic.",M1
20421945,"In vitro reconstitution of <e>SARS</e>-coronavirus mRNA cap methylation.SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome expression depends on the synthesis of a set of mRNAs, which presumably are capped at their 5' end and direct the synthesis of all viral proteins in the infected cell. Sixteen viral non-structural proteins (nsp1 to nsp16) constitute an unusually large replicase complex, which includes two methyltransferases putatively involved in viral mRNA cap formation. The S-adenosyl-L-methionine (AdoMet)-dependent (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) activity was recently attributed to nsp14, whereas nsp16 has been predicted to be the AdoMet-dependent (nucleoside-2'O)-methyltransferase. Here, we have reconstituted complete SARS-CoV mRNA cap methylation in vitro. We show that mRNA cap methylation requires a third viral protein, nsp10, which acts as an essential trigger to complete RNA cap-1 formation. The obligate sequence of methylation events is initiated by nsp14, which first methylates capped RNA transcripts to generate cap-0 (7Me)GpppA-RNAs. The latter are then selectively 2'O-methylated by the 2'O-MTase nsp16 in complex with its activator nsp10 to give rise to cap-1 (7Me)GpppA(2'OMe)-RNAs. Furthermore, sensitive in vitro inhibition assays of both activities show that aurintricarboxylic acid, active in SARS-CoV infected cells, targets both MTases with IC(50) values in the micromolar range, providing a validated basis for anti-coronavirus drug design.",M2
20420403,"Mutation of Asn28 disrupts the dimerization and enzymatic activity of <e>SARS</e> 3CL(pro) .Coronaviruses are responsible for a significant proportion of annual respiratory and enteric infections in humans and other mammals. The most prominent of these viruses is the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) which causes acute respiratory and gastrointestinal infection in humans. The coronavirus main protease, 3CL(pro), is a key target for broad-spectrum antiviral development because of its critical role in viral maturation and high degree of structural conservation among coronaviruses. Dimerization is an indispensable requirement for the function of SARS 3CL(pro) and is regulated through mechanisms involving both direct and long-range interactions in the enzyme. While many of the binding interactions at the dimerization interface have been extensively studied, those that are important for long-range control are not well-understood. Characterization of these dimerization mechanisms is important for the structure-based design of new treatments targeting coronavirus-based infections. Here we report that Asn28, a residue 11 A from the closest residue in the opposing monomer, is essential for the enzymatic activity and dimerization of SARS 3CL(pro). Mutation of this residue to alanine almost completely inactivates the enzyme and results in a 19.2-fold decrease in the dimerization K(d). The crystallographic structure of the N28A mutant determined at 2.35 A resolution reveals the critical role of Asn28 in maintaining the structural integrity of the active site and in orienting key residues involved in binding at the dimer interface and substrate catalysis. These findings provide deeper insight into complex mechanisms regulating the activity and dimerization of SARS 3CL(pro).",M2
20409569,"The envelope protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus interacts with the non-structural protein 3 and is ubiquitinated.To analyze the proteins interacting with the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) envelope (E) protein, a SARS-CoV was engineered including two tags associated to the E protein. Using this virus, complexes of SARS-CoV E and other proteins were purified using a tandem affinity purification system. Several viral and cell proteins including spike, membrane, non-structural protein 3 (nsp3), dynein heavy chain, fatty acid synthase and transmembrane protein 43 bound E protein. In the present work, we focused on the binding of E protein to nsp3 in infected cells and cell-free systems. This interaction was mediated by the N-terminal acidic domain of nsp3. Moreover, nsp3 and E protein colocalized during the infection. It was shown that E protein was ubiquitinated in vitro and in cell culture, suggesting that the interaction between nsp3 and E protein may play a role in the E protein ubiquitination status and therefore on its turnover.",M2
20336714,"The route of inoculation determines the tissue tropism of modified vaccinia Tiantan expressing the spike glycoprotein of <e>SARS</e>-CoV in mice.The live replication-competent modified vaccinia virus Tiantan (MVTT) is an attractive vaccine vector, yet little is known about its tissue tropism and pathology in vivo. Recently, we demonstrated that a recombinant MVTT expressing the spike glycoprotein of SARS-CoV (namely MVTT-S) is superior to the non-replicating modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA-S) for inducing high level of neutralizing antibodies through mucosal vaccination. In this study, we further determined the tissue tropism and safety of MVTT-S after the vaccine was administrated through various routes including: intramuscular (i.m.), intranasal (i.n.), and intravaginal (i.vag.) inoculations, respectively. Using real-time PCR, nested PCR, immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization assays, we found that MVTT-S was able to produce a transient infection in all cases within 48 hr post-inoculation, yet the major site of viral replication in various tissues or organs was dependent on the route of viral administration. We demonstrated that i.m. injection of MVTT-S primarily targeted draining inguinal lymph nodes, whereas mucosal inoculation had broader range of tissue infections. i.n. inoculation involved infections in lungs, kidneys, spleens and cervix lymph nodes while i.vag. administration targeted uteruses, ovaries, kidneys and spleens. Critically, the infection did not cause severe pathogenic consequences in infected tissues, which was consistent to the attenuated phenotype of MVTT-S. Our findings have implications for the optimization of vaccination route and for studies on the correlation between the magnitude of immune responses and the extent of tissue involvement in vivo.",M2

A previous study indicated that ACE2 from a horseshoe bat, the host of a highly related SARS-like coronavirus, could not function as a receptor for SARS-CoV. Here, we demonstrate that a 3 aa change from SHE (aa 40-42) to FYQ was sufficient to convert the bat ACE2 into a fully functional receptor for SARS-CoV. We further demonstrate that an ACE2 molecule from a fruit bat, which contains the FYQ motif, was able to support SARS-CoV infection, indicating a potentially much wider host range for SARS-CoV-related viruses among different bat populations.",M2

20181693,"Deubiquitinating and interferon antagonism activities of coronavirus papain-like proteases.Coronaviruses encode multifunctional proteins that are critical for viral replication and for blocking the innate immune response to viral infection. One such multifunctional domain is the coronavirus papain-like protease (PLP), which processes the viral replicase polyprotein, has deubiquitinating (DUB) activity, and antagonizes the induction of type I interferon (IFN). Here we characterized the DUB and IFN antagonism activities of the PLP domains of human coronavirus NL63 and severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) coronavirus to determine if DUB activity mediates interferon antagonism. We found that NL63 PLP2 deconjugated ubiquitin (Ub) and the Ub-line molecule ISG15 from cellular substrates and processed both lysine-48- and lysine-63- linked polyubiquitin chains. This PLP2 DUB activity was dependent on an intact catalytic cysteine residue. We demonstrated that in contrast to PLP2 DUB activity, PLP2-mediated interferon antagonism did not require enzymatic activity. Furthermore, addition of an inhibitor that blocks coronavirus protease/DUB activity did not abrogate interferon antagonism. These results indicated that a component of coronavirus PLP-mediated interferon antagonism was independent of protease and DUB activity. Overall, these results demonstrate the multifunctional nature of the coronavirus PLP domain as a viral protease, DUB, and IFN antagonist and suggest that these independent activities may provide multiple targets for antiviral therapies.",M2

20164235,"Achieving a golden mean: mechanisms by which coronaviruses ensure synthesis of the correct stoichiometric ratios of viral proteins.In retroviruses and the double-stranded RNA totiviruses, the efficiency of programmed -1 ribosomal frameshifting is critical for ensuring the proper ratios of upstream-encoded capsid proteins to downstream-encoded replicase enzymes. The genomic organizations of many other frameshifting viruses, including the coronaviruses, are very different, in that their upstream open reading frames encode nonstructural proteins, the frameshift-dependent downstream open reading frames encode enzymes involved in transcription and replication, and their structural proteins are encoded by subgenomic mRNAs. The biological significance of frameshifting efficiency and how the relative ratios of proteins encoded by the upstream and downstream open reading frames affect virus propagation has not been explored before. Here, three different strategies were employed to test the hypothesis that the -1 PRF signals of coronaviruses have evolved to produce the correct ratios of upstream- to downstream-encoded proteins. Specifically, infectious clones of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>)-associated coronavirus harboring mutations that lower frameshift efficiency decreased infectivity by &gt;4 orders of magnitude. Second, a series of frameshift-promoting mRNA pseudoknot mutants was employed to demonstrate that the frameshift signals of the SARS-associated coronavirus and mouse hepatitis virus have evolved to promote optimal frameshift efficiencies. Finally, we show that a previously described frameshift attenuator element does not actually affect frameshifting per se but rather serves to limit the fraction of ribosomes available for frameshifting. The findings of these analyses all support a  golden mean  model in which viruses use both programmed ribosomal frameshifting and translational attenuation to control the relative ratios of their encoded proteins.",M2
20154085,"Self-assembly of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus membrane protein.Coronavirus membrane (M) protein can form virus-like particles (VLPs) when coexpressed with nucleocapsid (N) or envelope (E) proteins, suggesting a pivotal role for M in virion assembly. Here we demonstrate the self-assembly and release of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) M protein in medium in the form of membrane-enveloped vesicles with densities lower than those of VLPs formed by M plus N. Although efficient N-N interactions require the presence of RNA, we found that M-M interactions were RNA-independent. SARS-CoV M was observed in both the Golgi area and plasma membranes of a variety of cells. Blocking M glycosylation does not appear to significantly affect M plasma membrane labeling intensity, M-containing vesicle release, or VLP formation. Results from a genetic analysis indicate involvement of the third transmembrane domain of M in plasma membrane-targeting signal. Fusion proteins containing M amino-terminal 50 residues encompassing the first transmembrane domain were found to be sufficient for membrane binding, multimerization, and Golgi retention. Surprisingly, we found that fusion proteins lacking all three transmembrane domains were still capable of membrane binding, Golgi retention, and interacting with M. The data suggest that multiple SARS-CoV M regions are involved in M self-assembly and subcellular localization.",M2
20144233,"<e>SARS</e> coronavirus protein 7a interacts with human Ap4A-hydrolase.The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) open reading frame 7a (ORF 7a) encodes a 122 amino acid accessory protein. It has no significant sequence homology with any other known proteins. The 7a protein is present in the virus particle and has been shown to interact with several host proteins; thereby implicating it as being involved in several pathogenic processes including apoptosis, inhibition of cellular protein synthesis, and activation of p38 mitogen activated protein kinase. In this study we present data demonstrating that the SARS-CoV 7a protein interacts with human Ap4A-hydrolase (asymmetrical diadenosine tetraphosphate hydrolase, EC 3.6.1.17). Ap4A-hydrolase is responsible for metabolizing the  allarmone  nucleotide Ap4A and therefore likely involved in regulation of cell proliferation, DNA replication, RNA processing, apoptosis and DNA repair. The interaction between 7a and Ap4A-hydrolase was identified using yeast two-hybrid screening. The interaction was confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation from cultured human cells transiently expressing V5-His tagged 7a and HA tagged Ap4A-hydrolase. Human tissue culture cells transiently expressing 7a and Ap4A-hydrolase tagged with EGFP and Ds-Red2 respectively show these proteins co-localize in the cytoplasm.",M2
20129637,"Identification of N-linked carbohydrates from severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) spike glycoprotein.N-glycans were released from the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike glycoprotein produced in Vero E6 cells and their structures were determined by a combination of matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectrometry, negative ion electrospray collision-induced dissociation time-of-flight mass spectrometry and normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with exoglycosidase digestion. Major glycans were high-mannose (Man(5-9)GlcNAc(2)), hybrid and bi-, tri- and tetra-antennary complex with and without bisecting GlcNAc and core fucose. Complex glycans with fewer than the full complement of galactose residues were present and sialylation was negligible. Treatment with the glucosidase inhibitor N-butyl-deoxynojirimycin (NB-DNJ) inhibited N-glycan processing as evidenced by the appearance of glycans of composition Glc(3)Man(7-9)GlcNAc(2). However, some complex glycans remained suggesting the presence of an alpha-endomannosidase. Our data in tissue culture indicate that inhibition of N-glycan processing may be considered as a therapeutic strategy against SARS CoV infections.",M2
20106914,"The N-terminal region of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus protein 6 induces membrane rearrangement and enhances virus replication.The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) accessory protein 6 (p6) is a 63-amino-acid multifunctional Golgi-endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane-associated protein, with roles in enhancing virus replication and in evading the innate immune response to infection by inhibiting STAT1 (signal transducer and activator of transcription factor 1) translocation to the nucleus. Here, we demonstrate that p6 has an N-terminal region-cytoplasm-C-terminal region-cytoplasm configuration with residues 2 to 37 likely membrane embedded. Expression of p6, or of its N-terminal 41-amino-acid region, in the absence of other viral proteins, induced the formation of membranous structures, some of which were similar to double membrane vesicles involved in virus replication. Consistent with a role in virus replication, p6 partially colocalized with nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3), a marker for virus replication complexes. Further, while the C-terminal region is required for preventing STAT1 translocation to the nucleus, our results also indicated that the N-terminal 18 amino acids were necessary for maximal inhibition. Collectively, these results support the notion that p6 is a two-domain protein, although the function of each is not completely independent of the other.",M2
20103835,"Anti-<e>SARS</e> coronavirus 3C-like protease effects of Rheum palmatum L. extracts.The present study aims to clarify the inhibitive effect of the compounds from Rheum palmatum L. on the SARS-3CL protease. The SARS-CoV 3CL gene was amplified from RNA of the SARS virus by PCR. The SARS-CoV 3CL protease was purified from a colon bacillus recombinant. Drugs and 3CL protease were incubated together. The inhibition rate and IC(50) were calculated based on absorbance. Components from the Rheum palmatum L. had a high level of anti-SARS-CoV 3CL protease activity. The IC(50) was 13.76 +/- 0.03 microg/mL and the inhibition rate was up to 96%. In conclusion, extracts from Rheum palmatum L. have a high level of inhibitory activity against 3CL protease, suggesting that extracts from Rheum palmatum L. may represent a potential therapeutic for SARS.",M2
20034394,"Mutagenesis of the transmembrane domain of the <e>SARS</e> coronavirus spike glycoprotein: refinement of the requirements for SARS coronavirus cell entry.BACKGROUND: The spike protein (S) of SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) mediates entry of the virus into target cells, including receptor binding and membrane fusion. Close to or in the viral membrane, the S protein contains three distinct motifs: a juxtamembrane aromatic part, a central highly hydrophobic stretch and a cysteine rich motif. Here, we investigate the role of aromatic and hydrophobic parts of S in the entry of SARS CoV and in cell-cell fusion. This was investigated using the previously described SARS pseudotyped particles system (SARSpp) and by fluorescence-based cell-cell fusion assays. RESULTS: Mutagenesis showed that the aromatic domain was crucial for SARSpp entry into cells, with a likely role in pore enlargement.Introduction of lysine residues in the hydrophobic stretch of S also resulted in a block of entry, suggesting the borders of the actual transmembrane domain. Surprisingly, replacement of a glycine residue, situated close to the aromatic domain, with a lysine residue was tolerated, whereas the introduction of a lysine adjacent to the glycine, was not. In a model, we propose that during fusion, the lateral flexibility of the transmembrane domain plays a critical role, as do the tryptophans and the cysteines. CONCLUSIONS: The aromatic domain plays a crucial role in the entry of SARS CoV into target cells. The positioning of the aromatic domain and the hydrophobic domain relative to each other is another essential characteristic of this membrane fusion process.",M2
20032190,"Broad-spectrum in vitro activity and in vivo efficacy of the antiviral protein griffithsin against emerging viruses of the family Coronaviridae.Viruses of the family Coronaviridae have recently emerged through zoonotic transmission to become serious human pathogens. The pathogenic agent responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>), the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), is a member of this large family of positive-strand RNA viruses that cause a spectrum of disease in humans, other mammals, and birds. Since the publicized outbreaks of SARS in China and Canada in 2002-2003, significant efforts successfully identified the causative agent, host cell receptor(s), and many of the pathogenic mechanisms underlying SARS. With this greater understanding of SARS-CoV biology, many researchers have sought to identify agents for the treatment of SARS. Here we report the utility of the potent antiviral protein griffithsin (GRFT) in the prevention of SARS-CoV infection both in vitro and in vivo. We also show that GRFT specifically binds to the SARS-CoV spike glycoprotein and inhibits viral entry. In addition, we report the activity of GRFT against a variety of additional coronaviruses that infect humans, other mammals, and birds. Finally, we show that GRFT treatment has a positive effect on morbidity and mortality in a lethal infection model using a mouse-adapted SARS-CoV and also specifically inhibits deleterious aspects of the host immunological response to SARS infection in mammals.",M2
20016037,"Intraspecies diversity of <e>SARS</e>-like coronaviruses in Rhinolophus sinicus and its implications for the origin of SARS coronaviruses in humans.The Chinese rufous horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus sinicus) has been suggested to carry the direct ancestor of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), and the diversity of SARS-like CoVs (SLCoV) within this Rhinolophus species is therefore worth investigating. Here, we demonstrate the remarkable diversity of SLCoVs in R. sinicus and identify a strain with the same pattern of phylogenetic incongruence (i.e. an indication of recombination) as reported previously in another SLCoV strain. Moreover, this strain possesses a distinctive 579 nt deletion in the nsp3 region that was also found in a human SCoV from the late-phase epidemic. Phylogenetic analysis of the Orf1 region suggested that the human SCoVs are phylogenetically closer to SLCoVs in R. sinicus than to SLCoVs in other Rhinolophus species. These findings reveal a closer evolutionary linkage between SCoV in humans and SLCoVs in R. sinicus, defining the scope of surveillance to search for the direct ancestor of human SCoVs.",M2
20007283,"A single tyrosine in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus membrane protein cytoplasmic tail is important for efficient interaction with spike protein.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) encodes 3 major envelope proteins: spike (S), membrane (M), and envelope (E). Previous work identified a dibasic endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal in the cytoplasmic tail of SARS-CoV S that promotes efficient interaction with SARS-CoV M. The dibasic signal was shown to be important for concentrating S near the virus assembly site rather than for direct interaction with M. Here, we investigated the sequence requirements of the SARS-CoV M protein that are necessary for interaction with SARS-CoV S. The SARS-CoV M tail was shown to be necessary for S localization in the Golgi region when the proteins were exogenously coexpressed in cells. This was specific, since SARS-CoV M did not retain an unrelated glycoprotein in the Golgi. Importantly, we found that an essential tyrosine residue in the SARS-CoV M cytoplasmic tail, Y(195), was important for S-M interaction. When Y(195) was mutated to alanine, M(Y195A) no longer retained S intracellularly at the Golgi. Unlike wild-type M, M(Y195A) did not reduce the amount of SARS-CoV S carbohydrate processing or surface levels when the two proteins were coexpressed. Mutating Y(195) also disrupted SARS-CoV S-M interaction in vitro. These results suggest that Y(195) is necessary for efficient SARS-CoV S-M interaction and, thus, has a significant involvement in assembly of infectious virus.",M2
19995578,"TACE antagonists blocking ACE2 shedding caused by the spike protein of <e>SARS</e>-CoV are candidate antiviral compounds.Because outbreaks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) might reemerge, identifying antiviral compounds is of key importance. Previously, we showed that the cellular factor TNF-alpha converting enzyme (TACE), activated by the spike protein of SARS-CoV (SARS-S protein), was positively involved in viral entry, implying that TACE is a possible target for developing antiviral compounds. To demonstrate this possibility, we here tested the effects of TACE inhibitors on viral entry. In vitro and in vivo data revealed that the TACE inhibitor TAPI-2 attenuated entry of both pseudotyped virus expressing the SARS-S protein in a lentiviral vector backbone and infectious SARS-CoV. TAPI-2 blocked both the SARS-S protein-induced shedding of angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a receptor of SARS-CoV, and TNF-alpha production in lung tissues. Since the downregulation of ACE2 by SARS-S protein was proposed as an etiological event in the severe clinical manifestations, our data suggest that TACE antagonists block SARS-CoV infection and also attenuate its severe clinical outcome.",M2
19951177,"Antibody binding site mapping of <e>SARS</e>-CoV spike protein receptor-binding domain by a combination of yeast surface display and phage peptide library screening.The receptor-binding domain (RBD) of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) spike (S) protein plays an important role in viral infection, and is a potential major neutralizing determinant. In this study, three hybridoma cell lines secreting specific monoclonal antibodies against the RBD of the S protein were generated and their exact binding sites were identified. Using yeast surface display, the binding sites of these antibodies were defined to two linear regions on the RBD: S(337-360) and S(380-399). Using these monoclonal antibodies in phage peptide library screening identified 10 distinct mimotopes 12 amino acids in length. Sequence comparison between native epitopes and these mimotopes further confirmed the binding sites, and revealed key amino acid residues involved in antibody binding. None of these antibodies could neutralize the murine leukemia virus pseudotyped expressing the SARS-CoV spike protein (MLV/SARS-CoV). However, these mAbs could be useful in the diagnosis of SARS-CoV due to their exclusive reactivity with SARS-CoV. Furthermore, this study established a feasible platform for epitope mapping. Yeast surface display combined with phage peptide library screening provides a convenient strategy for the identification of epitope peptides from certain antigenic proteins.",M2
19924243,"Cleavage of the <e>SARS</e> coronavirus spike glycoprotein by airway proteases enhances virus entry into human bronchial epithelial cells in vitro.BACKGROUND: Entry of enveloped viruses into host cells requires the activation of viral envelope glycoproteins through cleavage by either intracellular or extracellular proteases. In order to gain insight into the molecular basis of protease cleavage and its impact on the efficiency of viral entry, we investigated the susceptibility of a recombinant native full-length S-protein trimer (triSpike) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) to cleavage by various airway proteases. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: PURIFIED TRISPIKE PROTEINS WERE READILY CLEAVED IN VITRO BY THREE DIFFERENT AIRWAY PROTEASES: trypsin, plasmin and TMPRSS11a. High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and amino acid sequencing analyses identified two arginine residues (R667 and R797) as potential protease cleavage site(s). The effect of protease-dependent enhancement of SARS-CoV infection was demonstrated with ACE2 expressing human bronchial epithelial cells 16HBE. Airway proteases regulate the infectivity of SARS-CoV in a fashion dependent on previous receptor binding. The role of arginine residues was further shown with mutant constructs (R667A, R797A or R797AR667A). Mutation of R667 or R797 did not affect the expression of S-protein but resulted in a differential efficacy of pseudotyping into SARS-CoVpp. The R667A SARS-CoVpp mutant exhibited a lack of virus entry enhancement following protease treatment. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: These results suggest that SARS S-protein is susceptible to airway protease cleavage and, furthermore, that protease mediated enhancement of virus entry depends on specific conformation of SARS S-protein upon ACE2 binding. These data have direct implications for the cell entry mechanism of SARS-CoV along the respiratory system and, furthermore expand the possibility of identifying potential therapeutic agents against SARS-CoV.",M2
19889777,"Integrity of the early secretory pathway promotes, but is not required for, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus RNA synthesis and virus-induced remodeling of endoplasmic reticulum membranes.To accommodate its RNA synthesis in the infected cell, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) induces a cytoplasmic reticulovesicular network (RVN) that is derived from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membranes. We set out to investigate how the early secretory pathway interacts with the RVN and the viral replication/transcription complex (RTC) that is anchored to it. When the secretory pathway was disrupted by brefeldin A (BFA) treatment at the start of infection, RVN formation and viral RTC activity were not blocked and continued up to 11 h postinfection, although RNA synthesis was reduced by ca. 80%. In vitro RTC assays, using membrane fractions from infected cells, demonstrated that BFA does not directly interfere with the activity of the viral RNA-synthesizing enzymes. Confocal microscopy studies showed that early secretory pathway components are not associated with SARS-CoV-induced replication sites, although our studies revealed that infection induces a remarkable redistribution of the translocon subunit Sec61alpha. Ultrastructural studies, including electron tomography, revealed that the formation of the RVN and all its previously documented features can occur in the presence of BFA, despite differences in the volume and morphology of the network. We therefore conclude that early secretory pathway proteins do not play a direct role in RVN morphogenesis or the functionality of the SARS-CoV RTC. The BFA-induced disruption of ER integrity and functionality probably affects the overall quality of the membrane scaffold that is needed to support the viral RTC and/or the availability of specific host factors, which in turn compromises viral RNA synthesis.",M2
19889773,"The open reading frame 3a protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus promotes membrane rearrangement and cell death.The genome of the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) contains eight open reading frames (ORFs) that encode novel proteins. These accessory proteins are dispensable for in vitro and in vivo replication and thus may be important for other aspects of virus-host interactions. We investigated the functions of the largest of the accessory proteins, the ORF 3a protein, using a 3a-deficient strain of SARS-CoV. Cell death of Vero cells after infection with SARS-CoV was reduced upon deletion of ORF 3a. Electron microscopy of infected cells revealed a role for ORF 3a in SARS-CoV induced vesicle formation, a prominent feature of cells from SARS patients. In addition, we report that ORF 3a is both necessary and sufficient for SARS-CoV-induced Golgi fragmentation and that the 3a protein accumulates and localizes to vesicles containing markers for late endosomes. Finally, overexpression of ADP-ribosylation factor 1 (Arf1), a small GTPase essential for the maintenance of the Golgi apparatus, restored Golgi morphology during infection. These results establish an important role for ORF 3a in SARS-CoV-induced cell death, Golgi fragmentation, and the accumulation of intracellular vesicles.",M2
19875857,"Evaluating protein similarity from coarse structures.To unscramble the relationship between protein function and protein structure, it is essential to assess the protein similarity from different aspects. Although many methods have been proposed for protein structure alignment or comparison, alternative similarity measures are still strongly demanded due to the requirement of fast screening and query in large-scale structure databases. In this paper, we first formulate a novel representation of a protein structure, i.e., Feature Sequence of Surface (FSS). Then, a new score scheme is developed to measure the similarity between two representations. To verify the proposed method, numerical experiments are conducted in four different protein data sets. We also classify <e>SARS</e> coronavirus to verify the effectiveness of the new method. Furthermore, preliminary results of fast classification of the whole CATH v2.5.1 database based on the new macrostructure similarity are given as a pilot study. We demonstrate that the proposed approach to measure the similarities between protein structures is simple to implement, computationally efficient, and surprisingly fast. In addition, the method itself provides a new and quantitative tool to view a protein structure.",M2
19875418,"The RNA polymerase activity of <e>SARS</e>-coronavirus nsp12 is primer dependent.An RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) is the central catalytic subunit of the RNA-synthesizing machinery of all positive-strand RNA viruses. Usually, RdRp domains are readily identifiable by comparative sequence analysis, but biochemical confirmation and characterization can be hampered by intrinsic protein properties and technical complications. It is presumed that replication and transcription of the approximately 30-kb severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) RNA genome are catalyzed by an RdRp domain in the C-terminal part of nonstructural protein 12 (nsp12), one of 16 replicase subunits. However, thus far full-length nsp12 has proven refractory to expression in bacterial systems, which has hindered both the biochemical characterization of coronavirus RNA synthesis and RdRp-targeted antiviral drug design. Here, we describe a combined strategy involving bacterial expression of an nsp12 fusion protein and its in vivo cleavage to generate and purify stable SARS-CoV nsp12 (106 kDa) with a natural N-terminus and C-terminal hexahistidine tag. This recombinant protein possesses robust in vitro RdRp activity, as well as a significant DNA-dependent activity that may facilitate future inhibitor studies. The SARS-CoV nsp12 is primer dependent on both homo- and heteropolymeric templates, supporting the likeliness of a close enzymatic collaboration with the intriguing RNA primase activity that was recently proposed for coronavirus nsp8.",M2
19864379,"Differential downregulation of ACE2 by the spike proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and human coronavirus NL63.The human coronaviruses (CoVs) severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>)-CoV and NL63 employ angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) for cell entry. It was shown that recombinant SARS-CoV spike protein (SARS-S) downregulates ACE2 expression and thereby promotes lung injury. Whether NL63-S exerts a similar activity is yet unknown. We found that recombinant SARS-S bound to ACE2 and induced ACE2 shedding with higher efficiency than NL63-S. Shedding most likely accounted for the previously observed ACE2 downregulation but was dispensable for viral replication. Finally, SARS-CoV but not NL63 replicated efficiently in ACE2-positive Vero cells and reduced ACE2 expression, indicating robust receptor interference in the context of SARS-CoV but not NL63 infection.",M2
19853613,"Identification of a new region of <e>SARS</e>-CoV S protein critical for viral entry.Infection by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is initiated by specific interactions between the SARS-CoV spike (S) protein and its receptor ACE2. In this report, we screened a peptide library representing the SARS-CoV S protein sequence using a human immunodeficiency virus-based pseudotyping system to identify specific regions that affect viral entry. One of the 169 peptides screened, peptide 9626 (S residues 217-234), inhibited SARS-CoV S-mediated entry of the pseudotyped virions in 293T cells expressing a functional SARS-CoV receptor (human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2) in a dose-dependent manner (IC(50) approximately 11 microM). Alanine scanning mutagenesis was performed to assess the roles of individual residues within this region of S, which was previously uncharacterized. The effects included significant reductions in expression (K223A), viral incorporation (L218A, I230A, and N232A), and reduced viral entry (L224A, L226A, I228A, T231A, and F233A).

In this work we present the characterization of the dynamic properties of the SARS-CoV S2-HR2 domain (residues 1141-1193 of S) in the prefusion and newly discovered transition states by NMR (15)N relaxation studies. The dynamic properties of the different states, which are stabilized under different experimental conditions, extend the current model of viral membrane fusion and give insight into the design of structure-based antagonists of SARS-CoV in particular, as well as other enveloped viruses such as HIV.",M2
19800091,"Dual effect of nitric oxide on <e>SARS</e>-CoV replication: viral RNA production and palmitoylation of the S protein are affected.Nitric oxide is an important molecule playing a key role in a broad range of biological process such as neurotransmission, vasodilatation and immune responses. While the anti-microbiological properties of nitric oxide-derived reactive nitrogen intermediates (RNI) such as peroxynitrite, are known, the mechanism of these effects are as yet poorly studied. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) belongs to the family Coronaviridae, was first identified during 2002-2003. Mortality in SARS patients ranges from between 6 to 55%. We have previously shown that nitric oxide inhibits the replication cycle of SARS-CoV in vitro by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we have further investigated the mechanism of the inhibition process of nitric oxide against SARS-CoV. We found that peroxynitrite, an intermediate product of nitric oxide in solution formed by the reaction of NO with superoxide, has no effect on the replication cycle of SARS-CoV, suggesting that the inhibition is either directly effected by NO or a derivative other than peroxynitrite. Most interestingly, we found that NO inhibits the replication of SARS-CoV by two distinct mechanisms. Firstly, NO or its derivatives cause a reduction in the palmitoylation of nascently expressed spike (S) protein which affects the fusion between the S protein and its cognate receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2. Secondly, NO or its derivatives cause a reduction in viral RNA production in the early steps of viral replication, and this could possibly be due to an effect on one or both of the cysteine proteases encoded in Orf1a of SARS-CoV.",M2
19782089,"Coronavirus N protein N-terminal domain (NTD) specifically binds the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) and melts TRS-cTRS RNA duplexes.All coronaviruses (CoVs), including the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>), encode a nucleocapsid (N) protein that harbors two independent RNA binding domains of known structure, but poorly characterized RNA binding properties. We show here that the N-terminal domain (NTD) of N protein from mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a virus most closely related to SARS-CoV, employs aromatic amino acid-nucleobase stacking interactions with a triple adenosine motif to mediate high-affinity binding to single-stranded RNAs containing the transcriptional regulatory sequence (TRS) or its complement (cTRS). Stoichiometric NTD fully unwinds a TRS-cTRS duplex that mimics a transiently formed transcription intermediate in viral subgenomic RNA synthesis. Mutation of the solvent-exposed Y127, positioned on the beta-platform surface of our 1.75 A structure, binds the TRS far less tightly and is severely crippled in its RNA unwinding activity. In contrast, the C-terminal domain (CTD) exhibits no RNA unwinding activity. Viruses harboring Y127A N mutation are strongly selected against and Y127A N does not support an accessory function in MHV replication. We propose that the helix melting activity of the coronavirus N protein NTD plays a critical accessory role in subgenomic RNA synthesis and other processes requiring RNA remodeling.",M2
19774076,"Inducible Bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue elicited by a protein cage nanoparticle enhances protection in mice against diverse respiratory viruses.BACKGROUND: Destruction of the architectural and subsequently the functional integrity of the lung following pulmonary viral infections is attributable to both the extent of pathogen replication and to the host-generated inflammation associated with the recruitment of immune responses. The presence of antigenically disparate pulmonary viruses and the emergence of novel viruses assures the recurrence of lung damage with infection and resolution of each primary viral infection. Thus, there is a need to develop safe broad spectrum immunoprophylactic strategies capable of enhancing protective immune responses in the lung but which limits immune-mediated lung damage. The immunoprophylactic strategy described here utilizes a protein cage nanoparticle (PCN) to significantly accelerate clearance of diverse respiratory viruses after primary infection and also results in a host immune response that causes less lung damage. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Mice pre-treated with PCN, independent of any specific viral antigens, were protected against both sub-lethal and lethal doses of two different influenza viruses, a mouse-adapted <e>SARS</e>-coronavirus, or mouse pneumovirus. Treatment with PCN significantly increased survival and was marked by enhanced viral clearance, accelerated induction of viral-specific antibody production, and significant decreases in morbidity and lung damage. The enhanced protection appears to be dependent upon the prior development of inducible bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (iBALT) in the lung in response to the PCN treatment and to be mediated through CD4+ T cell and B cell dependent mechanisms. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The immunoprophylactic strategy described utilizes an infection-independent induction of naturally occurring iBALT prior to infection by a pulmonary viral pathogen. This strategy non-specifically enhances primary immunity to respiratory viruses and is not restricted by the antigen specificities inherent in typical vaccination strategies. PCN treatment is asymptomatic in its application and importantly, ameliorates the damaging inflammation normally associated with the recruitment of immune responses into the lung.",M2

19748648,"Human monoclonal antibodies to <e>SARS</e>-coronavirus inhibit infection by different mechanisms.SARS-CoV causes an acute infection making targeted passive immunotherapy an attractive treatment strategy. We previously generated human mAbs specific to the S1 region of SARS-CoV S protein. These mAbs bind epitopes within the receptor binding domain (RBD) or upstream of the RBD. We show that mAbs recognizing epitopes within the RBD inhibit infection by preventing viral attachment to the cellular receptor. One mAb binds upstream of the RBD and prevents viral entry by inhibiting a post-binding event. Evaluation of several mAbs demonstrated varying ability of the mAbs to select escape mutants when used individually. However, a mixture of antibodies could effectively neutralize a range of mutant viruses. These data strongly suggest that a mixture containing antibodies recognizing distinct regions and targeting more than one step in viral entry is likely to be more effective in neutralizing the virus and suppressing the generation of escape mutants, and thus potentially constitute a highly effective passive immunotherapy.",M2
19717178,"<e>SARS</e>-coronavirus spike S2 domain flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833 is important for activation of membrane fusion.The S2 domain of the coronavirus spike (S) protein is known to be responsible for mediating membrane fusion. In addition to a well-recognized cleavage site at the S1-S2 boundary, a second proteolytic cleavage site has been identified in the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) S2 domain (R797). C-terminal to this S2 cleavage site is a conserved region flanked by cysteine residues C822 and C833. Here, we investigated the importance of this well conserved region for SARS-CoV S-mediated fusion activation. We show that the residues between C822-C833 are well conserved across all coronaviruses. Mutagenic analysis of SARS-CoV S, combined with cell-cell fusion and pseudotyped virion infectivity assays, showed a critical role for the core-conserved residues C822, D830, L831, and C833. Based on available predictive models, we propose that the conserved domain flanked by cysteines 822 and 833 forms a loop structure that interacts with components of the SARS-CoV S trimer to control the activation of membrane fusion.",M2
19684916,"RNA aptamer-based sensitive detection of <e>SARS</e> coronavirus nucleocapsid protein.Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the etiological agent of a newly emerged disease SARS. The SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (N) protein is one of the most abundant structural proteins and serves as a diagnostic marker for accurate and sensitive detection of the virus. Using a SELEX (systematic evolution of ligand by exponential enrichment) procedure and recombinant N protein, we selected a high-affinity RNA aptamer capable of binding to N protein with a dissociation constant of 1.65 nM. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and RNA competition experiments showed that the selected aptamer recognized selectively the C-terminal region of N protein with high specificity. Using a chemiluminescence immunosorbent assay and a nanoarray aptamer chip with the selected aptamer as an antigen-capturing agent, we could sensitively detect N protein at a concentration as low as 2 pg/ml. These aptamer-antibody hybrid immunoassays may be useful for rapid, sensitive detection of SARS-CoV N protein.",M2
19660929,"Detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) coronavirus nucleocapsid protein in human serum using a localized surface plasmon coupled fluorescence fiber-optic biosensor.In order to enhance the sensitivity of conventional immunoassay technology for the detection of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nucleocapsid protein (N protein), we developed a localized surface plasmon coupled fluorescence (LSPCF) fiber-optic biosensor that combines sandwich immunoassay with the LSP technique. Experimentally, a linear relationship between the fluorescence signal and the concentration of recombinant SARS-CoV N (GST-N) protein in buffer solution could be observed from 0.1 pg/mL to 1 ng/mL. In addition, the concentration of GST-N protein in diluted serum across a similar range could also be measured. The correlation coefficients (linear scale) for these two measurements were 0.9469 and 0.9624, respectively. In comparison with conventional enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), the detection limit of the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor for the GST-N protein was improved at least 10(4)-fold using the same monoclonal antibodies. Therefore, the LSPCF fiber-optic biosensor shows an ability to detect very low concentration (approximately 1 pg/mL) of SARS-CoV N protein in serum. The biosensor should help with the early diagnosis of SARS infection.",M2

We subsequently carried out structure-activity relationship studies and optimized the lead structure to potent inhibitors that have shown antiviral activity against SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Upon the basis of the X-ray crystal structure of inhibitor 24-bound to SARS-CoV PLpro, a drug design template was created. Our structure-based modification led to the design of a more potent inhibitor, 2 (enzyme IC(50) = 0.46 microM; antiviral EC(50) = 6 microM). Interestingly, its methylamine derivative, 49, displayed good enzyme inhibitory potency (IC(50) = 1.3 microM) and the most potent SARS antiviral activity (EC(50) = 5.2 microM) in the series. We have carried out computational docking studies and generated a predictive 3D-QSAR model for SARS-CoV PLpro inhibitors.",M2
19641854,"Mesodynamics in the <e>SARS</e> nucleocapsid measured by NMR field cycling.Protein motions on all timescales faster than molecular tumbling are encoded in the spectral density. The dissection of complex protein dynamics is typically performed using relaxation rates determined at high and ultra-high field. Here we expand this range of the spectral density to low fields through field cycling using the nucleocapsid protein of the SARS coronavirus as a model system. The field-cycling approach enables site-specific measurements of R (1) at low fields with the sensitivity and resolution of a high-field magnet. These data, together with high-field relaxation and heteronuclear NOE, provide evidence for correlated rigid-body motions of the entire beta-hairpin, and corresponding motions of adjacent loops with a time constant of 0.8 ns (mesodynamics). MD simulations substantiate these findings and provide direct verification of the time scale and collective nature of these motions.",M2

Although several nsp's exhibit catalytic activities that are important for viral replication and transcription, other nsp's have less clearly defined roles during an infection. In order to gain a better understanding of their functions, we attempted to identify host proteins that interact with nsp's during SARS-CoV infections. For nsp2, we identified an interaction with two host proteins, prohibitin 1 (PHB1) and PHB2. Our results suggest that nsp2 may be involved in the disruption of intracellular host signaling during SARS-CoV infections.",M2

In this study, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) gene of raccoon dog (rdACE2) was cloned and sequenced. The amino acid sequence of rdACE2 has identities of 99.3, 89.2, 83.9 and 80.4 % to ACE2 proteins from dog, masked palm civet (pcACE2), human (huACE2) and bat, respectively. There are six amino acid changes in rdACE2 compared with huACE2, and four changes compared with pcACE2, within the 18 residues of ACE2 known to make direct contact with the SARS-CoV S protein. A HeLa cell line stably expressing rdACE2 was established; Western blot analyses and an enzyme-activity assay indicated that the cell line expressed ACE2 at a similar level to two previously established cell lines that express ACE2 from human and masked palm civet, respectively. Human immunodeficiency virus-backboned pseudoviruses expressing spike proteins derived from human SARS-CoV or SARS-CoV-like viruses of masked palm civets and raccoon dogs were tested for their entry efficiency into these cell lines. The results showed that rdACE2 is a more efficient receptor for human SARS-CoV, but not for SARS-CoV-like viruses of masked palm civets and raccoon dogs, than huACE2 or pcACE2. This study provides useful data to elucidate the role of raccoon dog in SARS outbreaks.",M2
19625461,"Interferon priming enables cells to partially overturn the <e>SARS</e> coronavirus-induced block in innate immune activation.SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is known to efficiently suppress the induction of antiviral type I interferons (IFN-alpha/beta) in non-lymphatic cells through inhibition of the transcription factor IRF-3. Plasmacytoid dendritic cells, in contrast, respond to infection with production of high levels of IFNs. Here, we show that pretreatment of non-lymphatic cells with small amounts of IFN-alpha (IFN priming) partially overturns the block in IFN induction imposed by SARS-CoV. IFN priming combined with SARS-CoV infection substantially induced genes for IFN induction, IFN signalling, antiviral effector proteins, ubiquitination and ISGylation, antigen presentation and other cytokines and chemokines, whereas each individual treatment had no major effect. Curiously, however, despite this typical IFN response, neither IRF-3 nor IRF-7 was transported to the nucleus as a sign of activation. Taken together, our results suggest that (i) IFN, as it is produced by plasmacytoid dendritic cells, could enable tissue cells to launch a host response to SARS-CoV, (ii) IRF-3 and IRF-7 may be active at subdetectable levels, and (iii) SARS-CoV does not activate IRF-7.",M2

19593379,"Structure and inhibition of the <e>SARS</e> coronavirus envelope protein ion channel.The envelope (E) protein from coronaviruses is a small polypeptide that contains at least one alpha-helical transmembrane domain. Absence, or inactivation, of E protein results in attenuated viruses, due to alterations in either virion morphology or tropism. Apart from its morphogenetic properties, protein E has been reported to have membrane permeabilizing activity. Further, the drug hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not amiloride, inhibited in vitro ion channel activity of some synthetic coronavirus E proteins, and also viral replication. We have previously shown for the coronavirus species responsible for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV) that the transmembrane domain of E protein (ETM) forms pentameric alpha-helical bundles that are likely responsible for the observed channel activity. Herein, using solution NMR in dodecylphosphatidylcholine micelles and energy minimization, we have obtained a model of this channel which features regular alpha-helices that form a pentameric left-handed parallel bundle. The drug HMA was found to bind inside the lumen of the channel, at both the C-terminal and the N-terminal openings, and, in contrast to amiloride, induced additional chemical shifts in ETM. Full length SARS-CoV E displayed channel activity when transiently expressed in human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK-293) cells in a whole-cell patch clamp set-up. This activity was significantly reduced by hexamethylene amiloride (HMA), but not by amiloride.

The recombinant nspl4 proteins with either GST fusion or 6-histidine tag were shown to possess ribonuclease activity but nspl4 with a short MGHHHHHHGS tag sequence at the N-terminus increased the solubility of nspl4 protein and facilitated the protein purification. Mutations of the conserved residues of nspl4 resulted in significant attenuation but not abolishment of the ribonuclease activity. Combination of fluorescence and circular dichroism spectroscopy analyses showed that the conformational stability of nsp14 protein varied with many external factors such as pH, temperature and presence of denaturing chemicals.

The membrane topology of SARS-CoV M and the functional significance of its N-glycosylation are not completely understood as is its interaction with the surface glycoprotein S. Using biochemical and immunofluorescence analyses we found that M consists of a short glycosylated N-terminal ectodomain, three transmembrane segments and a long, immunogenic C-terminal endodomain. Although the N-glycosylation site of M seems to be highly conserved between group 1 and 3 coronaviruses, studies using a recombinant SARS-CoV expressing a glycosylation-deficient M revealed that N-glycosylation of M neither influence the shape of the virions nor their infectivity in cell culture. Further functional analysis of truncated M proteins showed that the N-terminal 134 amino acids comprising the three transmembrane domains are sufficient to mediate accumulation of M in the Golgi complex and to enforce recruitment of the viral spike protein S to the sites of virus assembly and budding in the ERGIC.",M2
19523911,"Boosted expression of the <e>SARS</e>-CoV nucleocapsid protein in tobacco and its immunogenicity in mice.Vaccines produced in plant systems are safe and economical; however, the extensive application of plant-based vaccines is mainly hindered by low expression levels of heterologous proteins in plant systems. Here, we demonstrated that the post-transcriptional gene silencing suppressor p19 protein from tomato bushy stunt virus substantially enhanced the transient expression of recombinant SARS-CoV nucleocapsid (rN) protein in Nicotiana benthamiana. The rN protein in the agrobacteria-infiltrated plant leaf accumulated up to a concentration of 79 microg per g fresh leaf weight at 3 days post infiltration. BALB/c mice were intraperitoneally vaccinated with pre-treated plant extract emulsified in Freund's adjuvant. The rN protein-specific IgG in the mouse sera attained a titer about 1:1,800 following three doses of immunization, which suggested effective B-cell maturation and differentiation in mice. Antibodies of the subclasses IgG1 and IgG2a were abundantly present in the mouse sera. During vaccination of rN protein, the expression of IFN-gamma and IL-10 was evidently up-regulated in splenocytes at different time points, while the expression of IL-2 and IL-4 was not.

19453650,"<e>SARS</e>-coronavirus modulation of myocardial ACE2 expression and inflammation in patients with SARS.BACKGROUND: Angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), a monocarboxylase that degrades angiotensin II to angiotensin 1-7, is also the functional receptor for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and is highly expressed in the lungs and heart. Patients with SARS also suffered from cardiac disease including arrhythmias, sudden cardiac death, and systolic and diastolic dysfunction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We studied mice infected with the human strain of the SARS-CoV and encephalomyocarditis virus and examined ACE2 mRNA and protein expression. Autopsy heart samples from patients who succumbed to the SARS crisis in Toronto (Canada) were used to investigate the impact of SARS on myocardial structure, inflammation and ACE2 protein expression. RESULTS: Pulmonary infection with the human SARS-CoV in mice led to an ACE2-dependent myocardial infection with a marked decrease in ACE2 expression confirming a critical role of ACE2 in mediating SARS-CoV infection in the heart. The SARS-CoV viral RNA was detected in 35% (7/20) of autopsied human heart samples obtained from patients who succumbed to the SARS crisis during the Toronto SARS outbreak. Macrophage-specific staining showed a marked increase in macrophage infiltration with evidence of myocardial damage in patients who had SARS-CoV in their hearts. The presence of SARS-CoV in the heart was also associated with marked reductions in ACE2 protein expression. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that SARS-CoV can mediate myocardial inflammation and damage associated with down-regulation of myocardial ACE2 system, which may be responsible for the myocardial dysfunction and adverse cardiac outcomes in patients with SARS.",M2
19436709,"The <e>SARS</e>-unique domain (SUD) of SARS coronavirus contains two macrodomains that bind G-quadruplexes.Since the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, the three-dimensional structures of several of the replicase/transcriptase components of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), the non-structural proteins (Nsps), have been determined. However, within the large Nsp3 (1922 amino-acid residues), the structure and function of the so-called SARS-unique domain (SUD) have remained elusive. SUD occurs only in SARS-CoV and the highly related viruses found in certain bats, but is absent from all other coronaviruses. Therefore, it has been speculated that it may be involved in the extreme pathogenicity of SARS-CoV, compared to other coronaviruses, most of which cause only mild infections in humans. In order to help elucidate the function of the SUD, we have determined crystal structures of fragment 389-652 ( SUD(core) ) of Nsp3, which comprises 264 of the 338 residues of the domain. Both the monoclinic and triclinic crystal forms (2.2 and 2.8 A resolution, respectively) revealed that SUD(core) forms a homodimer. Each monomer consists of two subdomains, SUD-N and SUD-M, with a macrodomain fold similar to the SARS-CoV X-domain. However, in contrast to the latter, SUD fails to bind ADP-ribose, as determined by zone-interference gel electrophoresis. Instead, the entire SUD(core) as well as its individual subdomains interact with oligonucleotides known to form G-quadruplexes. This includes oligodeoxy- as well as oligoribonucleotides. Mutations of selected lysine residues on the surface of the SUD-N subdomain lead to reduction of G-quadruplex binding, whereas mutations in the SUD-M subdomain abolish it. As there is no evidence for Nsp3 entering the nucleus of the host cell, the SARS-CoV genomic RNA or host-cell mRNA containing long G-stretches may be targets of SUD. The SARS-CoV genome is devoid of G-stretches longer than 5-6 nucleotides, but more extended G-stretches are found in the 3'-nontranslated regions of mRNAs coding for certain host-cell proteins involved in apoptosis or signal transduction, and have been shown to bind to SUD in vitro. Therefore, SUD may be involved in controlling the host cell's response to the viral infection. Possible interference with poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase-like domains is also discussed.",M2

In this report, we describe the first application of AMP in the field of nanobiosensors. In(2)O(3) nanowire based biosensors have been configured with an AMP (Fibronectin, Fn) to detect nucleocapsid (N) protein, a biomarker for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS).

To develop an effective and specific medicine targeting the SARS-coronavirus (CoV), a chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme was designed and synthesized using a sequence homologous with the mouse hepatitis virus (MHV). METHOD: Chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeting MHV and SARS-CoV were designed and synthesized.To confirm its activity, in vitro cleavage reactions were performed with the synthesized ribozyme. Effects of the chimeric ribozyme were evaluated on multiplication of MHV. Effects of the chimeric ribozyme on expression of SARS-CoV were evaluated in cultured 3T3 cells. RESULT: The synthetic ribozyme cleaved the synthetic target MHV and SARS-CoV RNA into fragments of predicted length. The chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV significantly inhibited multiplication of MHV in DBT cells by about 60%. The chimeric DNA-RNA hammerhead ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV significantly inhibited the expression of SARS-CoV RNA in 3T3 cells transfected with the recombinant plasmid. The chimeric DNA-RNA ribozyme targeting SARS-CoV significantly inhibited MHV viral activity and expression of recombinant SARS RNA in vitro.

19409595,"Two adjacent mutations on the dimer interface of <e>SARS</e> coronavirus 3C-like protease cause different conformational changes in crystal structure.The 3C-like protease of SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV 3CL(pro)) is vital for SARS-CoV replication and is a promising drug target. It has been extensively proved that only the dimeric enzyme is active. Here we discovered that two adjacent mutations (Ser139_Ala and Phe140_Ala) on the dimer interface resulted in completely different crystal structures of the enzyme, demonstrating the distinct roles of these two residues in maintaining the active conformation of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro). S139A is a monomer that is structurally similar to the two reported monomers G11A and R298A. However, this mutant still retains a small fraction of dimer in solution, which might account for its remaining activity. F140A is a dimer with the most collapsed active pocket discovered so far, well-reflecting the stabilizing role of this residue. Moreover, a plausible dimerization mechanism was also deduced from structural analysis. Our work is expected to provide insight on the dimerization-function relationship of SARS-CoV 3CL(pro).",M2

Selected viruses were also inoculated into chicken embryos for studies of foreign gene expression at different tissue level. The results demonstrated the stability of recombinant viruses depends on the intrinsic properties of the foreign gene itself as well as the position at which the foreign genes were inserted. For unstable viruses, the loss of expression of the inserted genes was found to result from a large deletion of the inserted gene and even IBV backbone sequences. This represents a promising system for development of coronavirus-based gene delivery vectors and vaccines against coronavirus and other viral infections in chicken.",M2
19403678,"Molecular determinants for subcellular localization of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus open reading frame 3b protein.Viruses such as hepatitis C and the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) encode proteins that are distributed between mitochondria and the nucleus, but little is known about the factors that control partitioning between these sites. SARS-CoV encodes a unique accessory gene called open reading frame (ORF) 3b that, like other unique accessory genes in SARS-CoV, likely contributes to viral pathogenicity. The ORF 3b protein is 154 amino acids and is predicted to express from the second ORF in subgenomic RNA3. In this report, we have characterized the molecular components that regulate intracellular localization of the ORF 3b protein. We demonstrate unique shuttling behavior of ORF 3b, whereby the protein initially accumulates in the nucleus and subsequently translocates to mitochondria. Following nuclear localization, ORF 3b traffics to the outer membrane of mitochondria via a predicted amphipathic alpha-helix. Additionally, ORF 3b contains a consensus nuclear export sequence, and we demonstrate that nuclear export and thus mitochondrial translocation are dependent on a leptomycin B-sensitive nuclear export mechanism. We further show that ORF 3b inhibits induction of type I interferon induced by retinoic acid-induced gene 1 and the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein. Our observations provide insights into the cellular localization of ORF 3b that may enhance our understanding of the mechanisms by which ORF 3b contributes to SARS-CoV pathogenesis. The findings reported here reveal that for multilocalized proteins, consideration of the spatiotemporal distribution may be crucial for understanding viral protein behavior and function.",M2

ORF9b as one of these accessory proteins is located in subgenomic mRNA9 and encodes a 98 amino acid protein. However, whether 9b protein is a structural component of SARS-CoV particles remains unknown. In this study, we demonstrate that 9b protein is translated from bicistronic mRNA9 via leaky ribosome scanning and it is incorporated into both virus-like particles (VLPs) and purified SARS-CoV virions. Further analysis shows that sufficient incorporation of 9b protein into VLPs is dependent upon the co-expression of E and M proteins, but not upon the presence of either S or N protein. Our data indicate that 9b protein of SARS-CoV is another virion-associated accessory protein. This finding will lead to a better understanding of the properties of the SARS-CoV 9b protein.",M2
19378126,"Use of GFP to investigate expression of plant-derived vaccines.Plants are low-cost bioreactors for the production of various biopharmaceuticals including oral vaccines. Plant-derived oral vaccines are potentially useful in combating viral infections involving mucosal immunity. Transgenic plants have been generated to successfully produce mucosal vaccines against cholera, hepatitis B, foot-and-mouth disease, and Norwalk virus. As a first step toward the generation of oral vaccines against the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV), we have expressed a recombinant S1 protein of the SARS-CoV in transformed tobacco. Since plant transformation and regeneration of stable transformants require considerable time, we initially used a green fluorescent protein (GFP) to tag the antigen in transient expression. GFP was fused to the carboxy-terminus of S1 for expression of S1-GFP to show expression of recombinant S1 by agroinfiltration of tobacco leaves. The GFP tag enables a relatively quick confirmation of antigen expression in plant cells by fluorescent microscopy. Such analysis using GFP that precedes stable plant transformation will enable the rapid screening of multiple constructs to attain optimal recombinant protein expression. Furthermore, this approach determines the subcellular localization of the recombinant protein in plant cells, providing information on optimal subcellular targeting for production in plant bioreactors.",M2

To determine the biological relevance of this motif, we constructed a SARS-CoV reverse genetic construct by using a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC)-based vector controlled by a T7 promoter; and subsequently deleted the SR-rich motif from the N gene. The mutated infectious clone showed reduced level of genome transcription and significantly reduced levels of the infectious virions.

Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) intimately engages and regulates the host innate immune responses during infection. Using a novel interferon (IFN) antagonism screen, we show that the SARS-CoV proteome contains several replicase, structural, and accessory proteins that antagonize the IFN pathway. In this study, we focus on the SARS-CoV papain-like protease (PLP), which engages and antagonizes the IFN induction and NF-kappaB signaling pathways. PLP blocks these pathways by affecting activation of the important signaling proteins in each pathway, IRF3 and NF-kappaB. We also show that the ubiquitin-like domain of PLP is necessary for pathway antagonism but not sufficient by itself to block these pathways regardless of the enzymatic activity of the protease. The potential mechanism of PLP antagonism and its role in pathogenesis are discussed.",M2
19363699,"Translational control of the subgenomic RNAs of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus.The 3'-one-third of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) genome contains genes for four essential structural proteins and eight virus-specific genes. The expression of this genomic information of SARS-CoV involves synthesis of a nested set of subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs). In this study, we showed that the translational levels of 10 SARS-CoV sgRNAs including the two low-abundance sgRNAs 2-1 and 3-1 varied considerably in translation reporter assays. We also demonstrated that the initiator AUG codon of sgRNA-8 was silent and the repressive control was most likely positioned in the upstream untranslated region (UTR) of sgRNA-8. The initiator AUG codons of most sgRNAs are in poor Kozak contexts and the translation of truncated proteins from downstream AUG codons by leaky scanning was common in our experimental settings. No significant correlation was found between complexity of 5'-UTR and the sequence context of AUG codon with the level of translation of SARS-CoV sgRNAs.

In this study we demonstrate that these chimeras are capable of packaging large amounts of human APOBEC3G (hA3G), and that an HIV-1 Gag chimera containing the carboxyl-terminal half of human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) N as a substitute for NC is capable of directing VLP assembly and efficiently packaging hA3G. When co-expressed with SARS-CoV N and M (membrane) proteins, hA3G was efficiently incorporated into SARS-CoV VLPs. Data from GST pull-down assays suggest that the N sequence involved in N-hA3G interactions is located between residues 86 and 302. Like HIV-1 NC, the SARS-CoV or HCoV-229E N-associated with hA3G depends on the presence of RNA, with the first linker region essential for hA3G packaging into both HIV-1 and SARS-CoV VLPs.

19322648,"Expression and membrane integration of <e>SARS</e>-CoV E protein and its interaction with M protein.The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)-CoV E gene fragment was cloned and expressed as a recombinant protein fused with a myc tag at the N-terminus in vitro and in Vero E6 cells. Similar to other N-glycosylated proteins, the glycosylation of SARS-CoV E protein occurred co-translationally in the presence of microsomes. The SARS-CoV E protein is predicted to be a double-spanning membrane protein lacking a conventional signal peptide. Both of the transmembrane regions (a.a. 11-33 and 37-59) are predicted to be alpha-helices, which penetrate into membranes by themselves. As expected, these two transmembrane regions inserted a cytoplasmic protein into the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Either of these two transmembrane domains co-localized with M protein. Both the transmembrane domains of E protein are required to interact with M protein, while either of the hydrophilic regions (a.a. 1-10 or 60-76) is dispensable as shown by co-immunoprecipitation assay. These results are important for the study of SARS-CoV assembly.",M2
19321428,"Activation of the <e>SARS</e> coronavirus spike protein via sequential proteolytic cleavage at two distinct sites.The coronavirus spike protein (S) plays a key role in the early steps of viral infection, with the S1 domain responsible for receptor binding and the S2 domain mediating membrane fusion. In some cases, the S protein is proteolytically cleaved at the S1-S2 boundary. In the case of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), it has been shown that virus entry requires the endosomal protease cathepsin L; however, it was also found that infection of SARS-CoV could be strongly induced by trypsin treatment. Overall, in terms of how cleavage might activate membrane fusion, proteolytic processing of the SARS-CoV S protein remains unclear. Here, we identify a proteolytic cleavage site within the SARS-CoV S2 domain (S2', R797). Mutation of R797 specifically inhibited trypsin-dependent fusion in both cell-cell fusion and pseudovirion entry assays. We also introduced a furin cleavage site at both the S2' cleavage site within S2 793-KPTKR-797 (S2'), as well as at the junction of S1 and S2. Introduction of a furin cleavage site at the S2' position allowed trypsin-independent cell-cell fusion, which was strongly increased by the presence of a second furin cleavage site at the S1-S2 position. Taken together, these data suggest a novel priming mechanism for a viral fusion protein, with a critical proteolytic cleavage event on the SARS-CoV S protein at position 797 (S2'), acting in concert with the S1-S2 cleavage site to mediate membrane fusion and virus infectivity.",M2
19319935,"C-terminal domain of <e>SARS</e>-CoV main protease can form a 3D domain-swapped dimer.SARS coronavirus main protease (M(pro)) plays an essential role in the extensive proteolytic processing of the viral polyproteins (pp1a and pp1ab), and it is an important target for anti-SARS drug development. We have reported that both the M(pro) C-terminal domain alone (M(pro)-C) and the N-finger deletion mutant of M(pro) (M(pro)-Delta7) exist as a stable dimer and a stable monomer (Zhong et al., J Virol 2008; 82:4227-4234). Here, we report structures of both M(pro)-C monomer and dimer. The structure of the M(pro)-C monomer is almost identical to that of the C-terminal domain in the crystal structure of M(pro). Interestingly, the M(pro)-C dimer structure is characterized by 3D domain-swapping, in which the first helices of the two protomers are interchanged and each is enwrapped by four other helices from the other protomer. Each folding subunit of the M(pro)-C domain-swapped dimer still has the same general fold as that of the M(pro)-C monomer. This special dimerization elucidates the structural basis for the observation that there is no exchange between monomeric and dimeric forms of M(pro)-C and M(pro)-Delta7.",M2

METHODS: S2ED based on bioinformatics prediction and EGFP sequence were amplified by PCR and inserted into pET-14b plasmid. The recombinant protein His-S2ED-EGFP was expressed in E. coli by IPTG induction. After purification by Ni-NTA agarose beads, the soluble fractions of the fusion protein were collected and identified by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The fusion of S2ED with Hela cell membranes was observed with fluorescent microscope. RESULTS: The pET-14b-S2ED-EGFP plasmid was correctly constructed and highly expressed in BL21 (DE3). When incubated with Hela cells, the purified protein could not internalize through membrane fusion. CONCLUSIONS: The expression plasmid containing S2ED of SARS-Cov S protein and EGFP sequence is constructed successfully. Although the recombinant protein obtained has not shown the expected fusion effect with Hela cell membrane, this work may enrich the understanding of the process of membrane fusion mediated by S2 protein and lay the foundation for future study of targeting cell transport system based on cell-specific binding peptide.",M2
19304306,"The 8ab protein of <e>SARS</e>-CoV is a luminal ER membrane-associated protein and induces the activation of ATF6.The 8ab protein of SARS-CoV is a group-specific accessory protein, which is lost when the virus was transmitted from animals to humans due to a 29-nucleotide deletion in the ORF8ab region. Here we found that 8ab protein is associated with ER membrane at luminal surface. 8ab protein was found to up-regulate the synthesis of endogenous ER-resident chaperons involved in protein folding through the activation of the transcription factor ATF6, while it showed no effect on the CHOP induction and XBP1 splicing associated with the unfolded protein response (UPR). When ectopically expressed in mammalian cells, 8ab induced the proteolysis of ATF6 and the translocation of its cleaved DNA-binding and transcription-activation domains from the ER to the nucleus. Finally, we showed that 8ab binds to the luminal domain of ATF6. These findings suggest that 8ab could modulate the UPR by activating ATF6 to facilitate protein folding and processing. Thus, the loss of 8ab in SARS-CoV through viral evolution in animals may play a role in its pathogenicity.",M2

The present study analyzed the activities of nsp1 proteins from the group 2 bat CoV strains Rm1, 133, and HKU9-1, belonging to groups 2b, 2c, and 2d, respectively. The host mRNA degradation and translational suppression activities of nsp1 of SARS-CoV and Rm1 nsp1 were similar and stronger than the activities of the nsp1 proteins of 133 and HKU9-1. Rm1 nsp1 expression in trans strongly inhibited the induction of type I interferon (IFN-I) and IFN-stimulated genes in cells infected with an IFN-inducing SARS-CoV mutant, while 133 and HKU9-1 nsp1 proteins had relatively moderate IFN-inhibitory activities. The results of our studies suggested a conserved function among nsp1 proteins of SARS-CoV and group 2 bat CoVs.",M2
19264610,"Comparison of vesicular stomatitis virus pseudotyped with the S proteins from a porcine and a human coronavirus.The surface proteins S of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) were compared for their ability to mediate infection of viral pseudotypes based on vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The cell tropism of the respective pseudotypes corresponded to the tropism of the viruses from which the S protein was derived. Higher infectivity values were obtained with the SARS-CoV S protein than with the TGEV S protein. Differences were observed with respect to the importance of the cytoplasmic tail and the membrane anchor of the S proteins. In the case of the SARS-CoV S protein, truncation of the cytoplasmic tail resulted in increased infectivity. For the TGEV S protein, the inactivation of an intracellular retention signal in the cytoplasmic tail was required. Exchange of the membrane anchor of the S proteins led to a low infection efficiency. Our results indicate that related glycoproteins may show substantial differences in their ability to mediate pseudotype infection.",M2
19254548,"Thermostability of the N-terminal RNA-binding domain of the <e>SARS</e>-CoV nucleocapsid protein: experiments and numerical simulations.Differential scanning calorimetry, circular dichroism spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and numerical simulations were used to study the thermostability of the N-terminal RNA-binding domain (RBD) of the SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein. The transition temperature of the RBD in a mixing buffer, composed of glycine, sodium acetate, and sodium phosphate with 100 mM sodium chloride, at pH 6.8, determined by differential scanning calorimetry and circular dichroism, is 48.74 degrees C. Experimental results showed that the thermal-induced unfolding-folding transition of the RBD follows a two-state model with a reversibility &gt;90%. Using a simple G?-like model and Langevin dynamics we have shown that, in agreement with our experiments, the folding of the RBD is two-state. Theoretical estimates of thermodynamic quantities are in reasonable agreement with the experiments. Folding and thermal unfolding pathways of the RBD also were experimentally and numerically studied in detail. It was shown that the strand beta(1) from the N-terminal folds last and unfolds first, while the remaining beta-strands fold/unfold cooperatively.",M2
19208150,"A computational analysis of <e>SARS</e> cysteine proteinase-octapeptide substrate interaction: implication for structure and active site binding mechanism.BACKGROUND: SARS coronavirus main proteinase (SARS CoVMpro) is an important enzyme for the replication of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome virus. The active site region of SARS CoVMpro is divided into 8 subsites. Understanding the binding mode of SARS CoVMpro with a specific substrate is useful and contributes to structural-based drug design. The purpose of this research is to investigate the binding mode between the SARS CoVMpro and two octapeptides, especially in the region of the S3 subsite, through a molecular docking and molecular dynamics (MD) simulation approach. RESULTS: The one turn alpha-helix chain (residues 47-54) of the SARS CoVMpro was directly involved in the induced-fit model of the enzyme-substrate complex. The S3 subsite of the enzyme had a negatively charged region due to the presence of Glu47. During MD simulations, Glu47 of the enzyme was shown to play a key role in electrostatic bonding with the P3Lys of the octapeptide. CONCLUSION: MD simulations were carried out on the SARS CoVMpro-octapeptide complex. The hypothesis proposed that Glu47 of SARS CoVMpro is an important residue in the S3 subsite and is involved in binding with P3Lys of the octapeptide.",M2

19233643,"Aryl diketoacids (ADK) selectively inhibit duplex DNA-unwinding activity of <e>SARS</e> coronavirus NTPase/helicase.As anti-HCV aryl diketoacids (ADK) are good metal chelators, we anticipated that ADKs might serve as potential inhibitors of SARS CoV (SCV) NTPase/helicase (Hel) by mimicking the binding modes of the bismuth complexes which effectively competes for the Zn(2+) ion binding sites in SCV Hel thereby disrupting and inhibiting both the NTPase and helicase activities. Phosphate release assay and FRET-based assay of the ADK analogues showed that the ADKs selectively inhibit the duplex DNA-unwinding activity without significant impact on the helicase ATPase activity. Also, antiviral activities of the ADKs were shown dependent upon the substituent. Taken together, these results suggest that there might be ADK-specific binding site in the SCV Hel, which warrants further investigations with diverse ADKs to provide valuable insights into rational design of specific SCV Hel inhibitors.",M2
19224332,"Interaction between <e>SARS</e>-CoV helicase and a multifunctional cellular protein (Ddx5) revealed by yeast and mammalian cell two-hybrid systems.To reveal the putative cellular factors involved in SARS coronavirus replication, the helicase (Hel, nsp13) of SARS coronavirus was used to screen the cDNA library of rat pulmonary epithelial cells using the yeast two-hybrid system. Positively interacting proteins were further tested using a mammalian cell hybrid system and co-immunoprecipitation in the human A549 cell line, which has been shown to support SARS coronavirus replication. Out of the seven positive clones observed by yeast two-hybrid assay, only the Ddx5 (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp box polypeptide 5) protein showed specific interaction with SARS-CoV helicase. When expression of DdX5 was knocked down by small interfering RNA (siRNA), SARS coronavirus replication was significantly inhibited in fetal rhesus kidney (FRhK-4) cells. Since Ddx5 is a multifunctional protein that plays important roles in transcriptional regulation, its interaction with SARS coronavirus helicase provides interesting clues for studying virus-host cell interactions in SARS-CoV infections.",M2

19208801,"Functional screen reveals <e>SARS</e> coronavirus nonstructural protein nsp14 as a novel cap N7 methyltransferase.The N7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap is the defining structural feature of eukaryotic mRNAs. Most eukaryotic viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm, including coronaviruses, have evolved strategies to cap their RNAs. In this report, we used a yeast genetic system to functionally screen for the cap-forming enzymes encoded by severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus and identified the nonstructural protein (nsp) 14 of SARS coronavirus as a (guanine-N7)-methyltransferase (N7-MTase) in vivo in yeast cells and in vitro using purified enzymes and RNA substrates. Interestingly, coronavirus nsp14 was previously characterized as a 3'-to-5' exoribonuclease, and by mutational analysis, we mapped the N7-MTase domain to the carboxy-terminal part of nsp14 that shows features conserved with cellular N7-MTase in structure-based sequence alignment. The exoribonuclease active site was dispensable but the exoribonuclease domain was required for N7-MTase activity. Such combination of the 2 functional domains in coronavirus nsp14 suggests that it may represent a novel form of RNA-processing enzymes. Mutational analysis in a replicon system showed that the N7-MTase activity was important for SARS virus replication/transcription and can thus be used as an attractive drug target to develop antivirals for control of coronaviruses including the deadly SARS virus. Furthermore, the observation that the N7-MTase of RNA life could function in lieu of that in DNA life provides interesting evolutionary insight and practical possibilities in antiviral drug screening.",M2
19159014,"A novel replication-competent vaccinia vector MVTT is superior to MVA for inducing high levels of neutralizing antibody via mucosal vaccination.Mucosal vaccination offers great advantage for inducing protective immune response to prevent viral transmission and dissemination. Here, we report our findings of a head-to-head comparison of two viral vectors modified vaccinia Ankara (MVA) and a novel replication-competent modified vaccinia Tian Tan (MVTT) for inducing neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) via intramuscular and mucosal vaccinations in mice. MVTT is an attenuated variant of the wild-type VTT, which was historically used as a smallpox vaccine for millions of Chinese people. The spike glycoprotein (S) of <e>SARS</e>-CoV was used as the test antigen after the S gene was constructed in the identical genomic location of two vectors to generate vaccine candidates MVTT-S and MVA-S. Using identical doses, MVTT-S induced lower levels ( approximately 2-3-fold) of anti- SARS-CoV neutralizing antibodies (Nabs) than MVA-S through intramuscular inoculation. MVTT-S, however, was capable of inducing consistently 20-to-100-fold higher levels of Nabs than MVA-S when inoculated via either intranasal or intraoral routes. These levels of MVTT-S-induced Nab responses were substantially (approximately 10-fold) higher than that induced via the intramuscular route in the same experiments. Moreover, pre-exposure to the wild-type VTT via intranasal or intraoral route impaired the Nab response via the same routes of MVTT-S vaccination probably due to the pre-existing anti-VTT Nab response. The efficacy of intranasal or intraoral vaccination, however, was still 20-to-50-fold better than intramuscular inoculation despite the subcutaneous pre-exposure to wild-type VTT. Our data have implications for people who maintain low levels of anti-VTT Nabs after historical smallpox vaccination. MVTT is therefore an attractive live viral vector for mucosal vaccination.",M2
19153232,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nsp9 dimerization is essential for efficient viral growth.The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) devotes a significant portion of its genome to producing nonstructural proteins required for viral replication. SARS-CoV nonstructural protein 9 (nsp9) was identified as an essential protein with RNA/DNA-binding activity, and yet its biological function within the replication complex remains unknown. Nsp9 forms a dimer through the interaction of parallel alpha-helices containing the protein-protein interaction motif GXXXG. In order to study the role of the nsp9 dimer in viral reproduction, residues G100 and G104 at the helix interface were targeted for mutation. Multi-angle light scattering measurements indicated that G100E, G104E, and G104V mutants are monomeric in solution, thereby disrupting the dimer. However, electrophoretic mobility assays revealed that the mutants bound RNA with similar affinity. Further experiments using fluorescence anisotropy showed a 10-fold reduction in RNA binding in the G100E and G104E mutants, whereas the G104V mutant had only a 4-fold reduction. The structure of G104E nsp9 was determined to 2.6-A resolution, revealing significant changes at the dimer interface. The nsp9 mutations were introduced into SARS-CoV using a reverse genetics approach, and the G100E and G104E mutations were found to be lethal to the virus. The G104V mutant produced highly debilitated virus and eventually reverted back to the wild-type protein sequence through a codon transversion. Together, these data indicate that dimerization of SARS-CoV nsp9 at the GXXXG motif is not critical for RNA binding but is necessary for viral replication.",M2
19112100,"<e>SARS</e>-CoV proteins decrease levels and activity of human ENaC via activation of distinct PKC isoforms.Among the multiple organ disorders caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), acute lung failure following atypical pneumonia is the most serious and often fatal event. We hypothesized that two of the hydrophilic structural coronoviral proteins (S and E) would regulate alveolar fluid clearance by decreasing the cell surface expression and activity of amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium (Na(+)) channels (ENaC), the rate-limiting protein in transepithelial Na(+) vectorial transport across distal lung epithelial cells. Coexpression of either S or E protein with human alpha-, beta-, and gamma-ENaC in Xenopus oocytes led to significant decreases of both amiloride-sensitive Na(+) currents and gamma-ENaC protein levels at their plasma membranes. S and E proteins decreased the rate of ENaC exocytosis and either had no effect (S) or decreased (E) rates of endocytosis. No direct interactions among SARS-CoV E protein with either alpha- or gamma-ENaC were indentified. Instead, the downregulation of ENaC activity by SARS proteins was partially or completely restored by administration of inhibitors of PKCalpha/beta1 and PKCzeta. Consistent with the whole cell data, expression of S and E proteins decreased ENaC single-channel activity in oocytes, and these effects were partially abrogated by PKCalpha/beta1 inhibitors. Finally, transfection of human airway epithelial (H441) cells with SARS E protein decreased whole cell amiloride-sensitive currents. These findings indicate that lung edema in SARS infection may be due at least in part to activation of PKC by SARS proteins, leading to decreasing levels and activity of ENaC at the apical surfaces of lung epithelial cells.",M2
19109397,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus triggers apoptosis via protein kinase R but is resistant to its antiviral activity.In this study, infection of 293/ACE2 cells with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) activated several apoptosis-associated events, namely, cleavage of caspase-3, caspase-8, and poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP), and chromatin condensation and the phosphorylation and hence inactivation of the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 2alpha (eIF2alpha). In addition, two of the three cellular eIF2alpha kinases known to be virus induced, protein kinase R (PKR) and PKR-like endoplasmic reticulum kinase (PERK), were activated by SARS-CoV. The third kinase, general control nonderepressible-2 kinase (GCN2), was not activated, but late in infection the level of GCN2 protein was significantly reduced. Reverse transcription-PCR analyses revealed that the reduction of GCN2 protein was not due to decreased transcription or stability of GCN2 mRNA. The specific reduction of PKR protein expression by antisense peptide-conjugated phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligomers strongly reduced cleavage of PARP in infected cells. Surprisingly, the knockdown of PKR neither enhanced SARS-CoV replication nor abrogated SARS-CoV-induced eIF2alpha phosphorylation. Pretreatment of cells with beta interferon prior to SARS-CoV infection led to a significant decrease in PERK activation, eIF2alpha phosphorylation, and SARS-CoV replication. The various effects of beta interferon treatment were found to function independently on the expression of PKR. Our results show that SARS-CoV infection activates PKR and PERK, leading to sustained eIF2alpha phosphorylation. However, virus replication was not impaired by these events, suggesting that SARS-CoV possesses a mechanism to overcome the inhibitory effects of phosphorylated eIF2alpha on viral mRNA translation. Furthermore, our data suggest that viral activation of PKR can lead to apoptosis via a pathway that is independent of eIF2alpha phosphorylation.",M2

19057867,"Pseudotyped vesicular stomatitis virus for analysis of virus entry mediated by <e>SARS</e> coronavirus spike proteins.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) contains a spike (S) protein that binds to a receptor molecule (angiotensin-converting enzyme 2; ACE2), induces membrane fusion, and serves as a neutralizing epitope. To study the functions of the S protein, we describe here the generation of SARS-CoV S protein-bearing vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) pseudotype using a VSVdeltaG*/GFP system in which the G gene is replaced by the green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene (VSV-SARS-CoV-St19/GFP). Partial deletion of the cytoplasmic domain of SARS-CoV S protein (SARS-CoV-St19) allowed efficient incorporation into the VSV particle that enabled the generation of a high titer of pseudotype virus. Neutralization assay with anti-SARS-CoV antibody revealed that VSV-SARS-St19/GFP pseudotype infection is mediated by SARS-CoV S protein. The VSVdeltaaG*/SEAP system, which secretes alkaline phosphatase instead of GFP, was also generated as a VSV pseudotype having SARS-CoV S protein (VSV-SARS-CoV-St19/SEAP). This system enabled high-throughput analysis of SARS-CoV S protein-mediated cell entry by measuring alkaline phosphatase activity. Thus, VSV pseudotyped with SARS-CoV S protein is useful for developing a rapid detection system for neutralizing antibody specific for SARS-CoV infection as well as studying the S-mediated cell entry of SARS-CoV.",M2
19052085,"Nuclear magnetic resonance structure shows that the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-unique domain contains a macrodomain fold.The nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) structure of a central segment of the previously annotated severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>)-unique domain (SUD-M, for  middle of the SARS-unique domain ) in SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) nonstructural protein 3 (nsp3) has been determined. SUD-M(513-651) exhibits a macrodomain fold containing the nsp3 residues 528 to 648, and there is a flexibly extended N-terminal tail with the residues 513 to 527 and a C-terminal flexible tail of residues 649 to 651. As a follow-up to this initial result, we also solved the structure of a construct representing only the globular domain of residues 527 to 651 [SUD-M(527-651)]. NMR chemical shift perturbation experiments showed that SUD-M(527-651) binds single-stranded poly(A) and identified the contact area with this RNA on the protein surface, and electrophoretic mobility shift assays then confirmed that SUD-M has higher affinity for purine bases than for pyrimidine bases. In a further search for clues to the function, we found that SUD-M(527-651) has the closest three-dimensional structure homology with another domain of nsp3, the ADP-ribose-1 -phosphatase nsp3b, although the two proteins share only 5% sequence identity in the homologous sequence regions. SUD-M(527-651) also shows three-dimensional structure homology with several helicases and nucleoside triphosphate-binding proteins, but it does not contain the motifs of catalytic residues found in these structural homologues. The combined results from NMR screening of potential substrates and the structure-based homology studies now form a basis for more focused investigations on the role of the SARS-unique domain in viral infection.",M2
19052082,"Multiple nucleic acid binding sites and intrinsic disorder of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus nucleocapsid protein: implications for ribonucleocapsid protein packaging.The nucleocapsid protein (N) of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV) packages the viral genomic RNA and is crucial for viability. However, the RNA-binding mechanism is poorly understood. We have shown previously that the N protein contains two structural domains--the N-terminal domain (NTD; residues 45 to 181) and the C-terminal dimerization domain (CTD; residues 248 to 365)--flanked by long stretches of disordered regions accounting for almost half of the entire sequence. Small-angle X-ray scattering data show that the protein is in an extended conformation and that the two structural domains of the SARS-CoV N protein are far apart. Both the NTD and the CTD have been shown to bind RNA. Here we show that all disordered regions are also capable of binding to RNA. Constructs containing multiple RNA-binding regions showed Hill coefficients greater than 1, suggesting that the N protein binds to RNA cooperatively. The effect can be explained by the  coupled-allostery  model, devised to explain the allosteric effect in a multidomain regulatory system. Although the N proteins of different coronaviruses share very low sequence homology, the physicochemical features described above may be conserved across different groups of Coronaviridae. The current results underscore the important roles of multisite nucleic acid binding and intrinsic disorder in N protein function and RNP packaging.",M2

Here, we have isolated DNA aptamers against the SARS-CoV helicase from a combinatorial DNA library. These aptamers show two distinct classes of secondary structure, G-quadruplex and non-G-quadruplex, as shown by circular dichroism and gel electrophoresis. All of the aptamers that were selected stimulated ATPase activity of the SARS-CoV helicase with low-nanomolar apparent K(m) values. Intriguingly, only the non-G-quadruplex aptamers showed specific inhibition of helicase activities, whereas the G-quadruplex aptamers did not inhibit helicase activities. The non-G-quadruplex aptamer with the strongest inhibitory potency was modified at the 3'-end with biotin or inverted thymidine, and the modification increased its stability in serum, particularly for the inverted thymidine modification. Structural diversity in selection coupled to post-selection stabilisation has provided new insights into the aptamers that were selected for a helicase target. These aptamers are being further developed to inhibit SARS-CoV replication.",M2
19004938,"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) coronavirus-induced lung epithelial cytokines exacerbate SARS pathogenesis by modulating intrinsic functions of monocyte-derived macrophages and dendritic cells.Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which is caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV), is a highly communicable disease with the lungs as the major pathological target. Although SARS likely stems from overexuberant host inflammatory responses, the exact mechanism leading to the detrimental outcome in patients remains unknown. Pulmonary macrophages (Mphi), airway epithelium, and dendritic cells (DC) are key cellular elements of the host innate defenses against respiratory infections. While pulmonary Mphi are situated at the luminal epithelial surface, DC reside abundantly underneath the epithelium. Such strategic locations of these cells within the airways make it relevant to investigate their likely impact on SARS pathogenesis subsequent to their interaction with infected lung epithelial cells. To study this, we established highly polarized human lung epithelial Calu-3 cells by using the Transwell culture system. Here we report that supernatants harvested from the apical and basolateral domains of infected Calu-3 cells are potent in modulating the intrinsic functions of Mphi and DC, respectively. They prompted the production of cytokines by both Mphi and DC and selectively induced CD40 and CD86 expression only on DC. However, they compromised the abilities of the DC and Mphi in priming nave T cells and phagocytosis, respectively. We also identified interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 as key SARS-CoV-induced epithelial cytokines capable of inhibiting the T-cell-priming ability of DC. Taken together, our results provide insights into the molecular and cellular bases of the host antiviral innate immunity within the lungs that eventually lead to an exacerbated inflammatory cascades and severe tissue damage in SARS patients.",M2
18991761,"Structural and biochemical investigation of heptad repeat derived peptides of human <e>SARS</e> corona virus (hSARS-CoV) spike protein.hSARS-CoV is the causative agent for SARS infection. Its spike glycoprotein (S) is processed by host furin enzyme to produce S1 and S2 fragments, the latter being crucial for fusion with the host membrane. This takes place via formation of a coiled coil 6-helix bundle involving N and C-terminal heptad repeat domains (HR-N and HR-C) of S2. Several fluorescent and non-fluorescent peptides from these domains were synthesized to examine their interactions by circular dichroism, thermal denaturation, native-page, mass spectrometry and fluorescence spectroscopy studies. Data revealed that HR-C domains (1153-1189), (1153-1172) and (1164-1184) all exhibit potent binding interactions with HR-N(892-931) domain. These peptides may find useful therapeutic applications in SARS intervention.",M2
18971274,"Protease-mediated entry via the endosome of human coronavirus 229E.Human coronavirus 229E, classified as a group I coronavirus, utilizes human aminopeptidase N (APN) as a receptor; however, its entry mechanism has not yet been fully elucidated. We found that HeLa cells infected with 229E via APN formed syncytia when treated with trypsin or other proteases but not in a low-pH environment, a finding consistent with syncytium formation by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (<e>SARS</e>-CoV). In addition, trypsin induced cleavage of the 229E S protein. By using infectious viruses and pseudotyped viruses bearing the 229E S protein, we found that its infection was profoundly blocked by lysosomotropic agents as well as by protease inhibitors that also prevented infection with SARS-CoV but not that caused by murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus strain JHMV, which enters cells directly from the cell surface. We found that cathepsin L (CPL) inhibitors blocked 229E infection the most remarkably among a variety of protease inhibitors tested. Furthermore, 229E infection was inhibited in CPL knockdown cells by small interfering RNA, compared with what was seen for a normal counterpart producing CPL. However, its inhibition was not so remarkable as that found with SARS-CoV infection, which seems to indicate that while CPL is involved in the fusogenic activation of 229E S protein in endosomal infection, not-yet-identified proteases could also play a part in that activity. We also found 229E virion S protein to be cleaved by CPL. Furthermore, as with SARS-CoV, 229E entered cells directly from the cell surface when cell-attached viruses were treated with trypsin. These findings suggest that 229E takes an endosomal pathway for cell entry and that proteases like CPL are involved in this mode of entry.",M2
18958613,"Expression of <e>SARS</e>-coronavirus spike glycoprotein in Pichia pastoris.To establish a rapid and economical method for the expression of viral proteins in high yield and purity by Pichia pastoris, the S protein of the SARS-CoV was selected in this study. Six S glycoprotein fragments were expressed in Escherichia coli BL21 and yeast KM71H strains. After purification by affinity chromatography, the protein identities were confirmed by western blot analysis, N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry. The proteins expressed in E. coli were low in solubility and bound by GroEL. They still formed soluble aggregates even when the GroEL was removed by urea. The proteins expressed in P. pastoris were relatively soluble. The maximal yield of the RBD reached 46 mg/l with purity greater than 95%. Pull-down assay revealed that ACE2 was specifically captured from cell lysate, indicating that the RBD was biologically active. The glycosylated and deglycosylated RBD was then subjected to SEC and results showed that deglycosylated RBD formed soluble aggregates again. Taken together, pure and biological active RBD of the S protein could be expressed in P. pastoris, and the P. pastoris expression platform will be a good alternative for the expression of viral proteins, in particular, the highly glycosylated surface proteins that mediate the tissue tropism and viral entry.",M2
18820582,"New respiratory viruses of humans.Acute respiratory viruses are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in humans worldwide and most acute respiratory infections are caused by viruses. Many of these viruses cause the highest burden of disease in specific risk groups such as young infants, the elderly, and immune-compromised individuals. Although the most important respiratory viruses of humans have been identified in the last century, in the past decade about a dozen  new  viruses have been discovered that may cause a high burden of acute respiratory disease in humans. Not only viruses were discovered that must have been with humans for many decades or centuries, such as human metapneumovirus and 2 different human coronaviruses, but also viruses that are truly new for humans and have emerged as a result of recent interspecies transmissions from other mammalian or avian reservoirs. The latter include highly pathogenic avian influenza viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (<e>SARS</e>) coronavirus, and Nipah virus. The discovery, etiologic role, and burden of disease caused by these infections are described.",M2
18926799,"<e>SARS</e> coronavirus: unusual lability of the nucleocapsid protein.The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a contagious disease that killed hundreds and sickened thousands of people worldwide between November 2002 and July 2003. The nucleocapsid (N) protein of the coronavirus responsible for this disease plays a critical role in viral assembly and maturation and is of particular interest because of its potential as an antiviral target or vaccine candidate. Refolding of SARS N-protein during production and purification showed the presence of two additional protein bands by SDS-PAGE. Mass spectroscopy (MALDI, SELDI, and LC/MS) confirmed that the bands are proteolytic products of N-protein and the cleavage sites are four SR motifs in the serine-arginine-rich region-sites not suggestive of any known protease. Furthermore, results of subsequent testing for contaminating protease(s) were negative: cleavage appears to be due to inherent instability and/or autolysis. The importance of N-protein proteolysis to viral life cycle and thus to possible treatment directions are discussed.",M2
18989460,"Broadening of neutralization activity to directly block a dominant antibody-driven <e>SARS</e>-coronavirus evolution pathway.Phylogenetic analyses have provided strong evidence that amino acid changes in spike (S) protein of animal and human SARS coronaviruses (SARS-CoVs) during and between two zoonotic transfers (2002/03 and 2003/04) are the result of positive selection. While several studies support that some amino acid changes between animal and human viruses are the result of inter-species adaptation, the role of neutralizing antibodies (nAbs) in driving SARS-CoV evolution, particularly during intra-species transmission, is unknown. A detailed examination of SARS-CoV infected animal and human convalescent sera could provide evidence of nAb pressure which, if found, may lead to strategies to effectively block virus evolution pathways by broadening the activity of nAbs. Here we show, by focusing on a dominant neutralization epitope, that contemporaneous- and cross-strain nAb responses against SARS-CoV spike protein exist during natural infection. In vitro immune pressure on this epitope using 2002/03 strain-specific nAb 80R recapitulated a dominant escape mutation that was present in all 2003/04 animal and human viruses. Strategies to block this nAb escape/naturally occurring evolution pathway by generating broad nAbs (BnAbs) with activity against 80R escape mutants and both 2002/03 and 2003/04 strains were explored. Structure-based amino acid changes in an activation-induced cytidine deaminase (AID)  hot spot  in a light chain CDR (complementarity determining region) alone, introduced through shuffling of naturally occurring non-immune human VL chain repertoire or by targeted mutagenesis, were successful in generating these BnAbs. These results demonstrate that nAb-mediated immune pressure is likely a driving force for positive selection during intra-species transmission of SARS-CoV. Somatic hypermutation (SHM) of a single VL CDR can markedly broaden the activity of a strain-specific nAb. The strategies investigated in this study, in particular the use of structural information in combination of chain-shuffling as well as hot-spot CDR mutagenesis, can be exploited to broaden neutralization activity, to improve anti-viral nAb therapies, and directly manipulate virus evolution.",M2
18986662,"Conserved amino acids W423 and N424 in receptor-binding domain of <e>SARS</e>-CoV are potential targets for therapeutic monoclonal antibody.The receptor-binding domain (RBD) on spike protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is the main region interacting with the viral receptor-ACE2 and is a useful target for induction of neutralizing antibodies against SARS-CoV infection. Here we generated two monoclonal antibodies (mAbs), targeting RBD, with marked virus neutralizing activity. The mAbs recognize a new conformational epitope which consists of several discontinuous peptides (aa. 343-367, 373-390 and 411-428) and is spatially located neighboring the receptor-binding motif (RPM) region of the RBD. Importantly, W423 and N424 residues are essential for mAb recognition and are highly conserved among 107 different strains of SARS, indicating that the residues are the most critical in the epitope which is a novel potential target for therapeutic mAbs. A human-mouse chimeric antibody, based upon the original murine mAb, was also constructed and shown to possess good neutralizing activity and high affinity.",M2
