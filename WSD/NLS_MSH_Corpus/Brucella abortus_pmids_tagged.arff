18763048,"Seroprevalence of brucellosis in yaks (Poephagus grunniens) in India and evaluation of protective immunity to S19 vaccine.The present study was carried out to explore the seroprevalence of brucellosis in yaks of North-Eastern hilly yak tracts of Arunachal Pradesh, India. Of 374 animals tested, 23.79, 21.11 and 18.98% were found positive for brucellosis using avidin-biotin ELISA (AB-ELISA), Rose-Bengal plate test (RBPT) and standard tube-agglutination test (STAT), respectively. The relative sensitivity and specificity for STAT were 79.77 and 100%, respectively and the same for RBPT were 88.76 and 100%, respectively in comparison to AB-ELISA. The alarming prevalence as recorded was highest among the yak cows (31.42%) followed by heifers (23.85%) and bulls (8.88%). The immune response in yaks following standard dose of calfhood vaccination with <e>Brucella abortus</e> strain 19 vaccine showed that protective antibody level persisted up to 210 days. This is the first report from India on prevalence of brucellosis and immunization with B abortus strain 19 vaccine in yaks. The present investigation would be a valuable guideline for future control measure and eradication programme of brucellosis in yaks.",M1
18440660,"Evaluation of surveillance strategies for bovine brucellosis in Japan using a simulation model.Bovine brucellosis is caused by <e>Brucella abortus</e> and induces abortions in female cattle, with other cattle at risk of infection from the aborted fetus or contaminated placenta. In Japan, the number of cases has dramatically reduced due to national surveillance and eradication strategies. Bovine brucellosis is now believed to be eradicated in Japan. Here, we examine the surveillance strategies currently in place for early detection of infected cattle in the event of a future reintroduction of the disease. We compared current serological surveillance for the dairy population with bulk-milk surveillance and abortion surveillance, and used time to detection as the main criterion of surveillance efficacy. A stochastic individual-based model (IBM) was developed to simulate disease transmission within and between farms. Using outputs from the transmission model, a comparison of surveillance strategies was simulated. For evaluation of the robustness of the parameter values used in the transmission model, a sensitivity analysis was conducted. For the purpose of evaluating the direct costs of each surveillance strategy, the annual number of samples to be tested and the annual number of farms to be visited were estimated. Our results indicated that current serological surveillance with 60-month test intervals is not effective enough for rapid detection of a brucellosis outbreak. Bulk-milk surveillance appeared the most effective method based on the early detection of infected cows and a reduced number of samples required. The time to detection for abortion surveillance was greater than that of bulk-milk surveillance but varied widely depending on the reported ratio of abortions. Results from the surveillance model were consistent when alternative scenarios were applied to the transmission model. Although our model cannot exactly replicate an actual brucellosis outbreak, or the results of surveillance, our results may help decision-makers to choose the most effective surveillance strategy.",M1
18338729,"Investigations into the prevalence of bovine brucellosis and the risk factors that predispose humans to infection among urban dairy and non-dairy farming households in Dagoretti Division, Nairobi, Kenya.OBJECTIVE: To explore the knowledge, attitudes and practices of dairy and non-dairy farming households in Dagoretti in regard to the risk posed by bovine brucellosis and determine the prevalence of the disease in urban dairy cattle. DESIGN: A cross sectional study. SETTING: Urban and Peri-urban dairy farming and non dairy farming households in Dagoretti division, Nairobi. SUBJECTS: Two hundred ninety nine dairy farming and 149 non dairy farming households. INTERVENTION: Segregated focus group discussions, administration of a household questionnaire and collection of unboiled milk from dairy and non dairy farming households were the instruments used to gather data on the practices, attitudes, perceptions and prevalence of bovine brucellosis. RESULTS: Three hundred and ninety three milk samples were collected and analysed for the presence of antibodies to <e>Brucella abortus</e> in an indirect ELISA. The apparent prevalence of bovine brucellosis from milk was estimated at 1% for the samples collected while in dairy farming households the prevalence was 1.1% [0.2, 3.4%] and 0.7% [0.4%] in non dairy farming households.. Thirty percent (90/296) of dairy respondents and 22% (32/147) of non-dairy respondents knew of the existence of brucellosis. Risk of contracting brucellosis was very low considering that milk is boiled together with other ingredients used in making tea and porridge. However, 31% (93/296) and 22% (31/143) of dairy and non dairy farming households respectively made traditionally fermented milk without first boiling the milk. This practice may predispose this group to brucellosis. CONCLUSION: The low prevalence of bovine brucellosis requires constant surveillance in case the prevalence rates do change. Education of dairy farming households who are more at risk of contracting brucellosis on the transmission pathways and risk factors is required in order to lower further the prevalence of bovine brucellosis in Dagoretti.",M1
18207262,"Risk associated with animals moved from herds infected with brucellosis in Northern Ireland.The movement of cattle from herds infected with <e>Brucella abortus</e> was investigated in order to assess the control measures for eradication of brucellosis from the cattle population of Northern Ireland. Using recorded cattle movement data, a historical cohort study was designed and carried out to quantify the risk of seropositivity in bovine animals moved from herds infected with brucellosis. The study found that 3.1% of animals, moved in the 6-month period prior to disclosure of infection in the source herd and subsequently tested, were interpreted as seropositive in their destination herds. The odds of seropositivity were approximately 19 (95% confidence interval: 7.8-46.4) times higher in this cohort compared with animals from herds with no history of infection. A multivariate logistic regression model was constructed to examine factors influencing the risk of seropositivity in the exposed cohort of animals, identifying maternal status (whether the dam had been a brucellosis reactor) and age at leaving the infected herd as the main risk factors.",M1
17904229,"Killing of Brucella antigen-sensitized macrophages by T lymphocytes in bovine brucellosis.The present study was an investigation into the role of T lymphocytes in the killing of antigen-sensitized macrophages (M Phi) in bovine brucellosis. Following confirmation of bovine T lymphocyte cell lines derived from <e>Brucella abortus</e> Strain 19 vaccinated steers as antigen-specific in proliferation studies using various antigens, we adapted an apoptosis assay for evaluation of cytotoxicity by these bovine T cells against autologous monocyte-derived macrophages (MDM Phi) as target cells. Various B. abortus antigen preparations were tested including whole gamma-irradiated B. abortus bacteria (gamma BA), a soluble cytosolic protein fraction and a membrane-associated protein fraction. Both polyclonal and cloned T lymphocyte cell lines exhibited cytotoxicity against MDM Phi targets in an antigen-specific fashion. Polyclonal and cloned T lymphocyte cell lines demonstrated cytotoxic responses to varying degrees against B. abortus antigens regardless of whether the antigen used was whole nonviable bacteria, a soluble protein extract or a membrane-associated fraction of extracted bacteria. To further develop correlation of these responses to an in vivo host defense mechanism, cytotoxicity was evaluated using target cells that had been infected with live B. abortus S19 or B. abortus Strain 2308. Cytotoxic responses were also demonstrated consistently against infected targets with either strain of B. abortus although in most cases, cytotoxicity was higher against target cells sensitized with gamma BA compared to those infected with live bacteria. Cloned T lymphocyte cell lines were all CD4+, CD8(-) cells indicating that the observed cytotoxic responses were most likely due to an inflammatory Th1 response and may represent an important host defense mechanism induced by vaccination with live attenuated strains of B. abortus in cattle.",M1
16600408,"Likelihood ratio estimation without a gold standard: a case study evaluating a brucellosis c-ELISA in cattle and water buffalo of Trinidad.The likelihood ratio (LR) is a measure of association that quantifies how many more times likely a particular test result is from an infected animal compared to one that is uninfected. They are ratios of conditional probabilities and cannot be interpreted at the individual animal level without information concerning pretest probabilities. Their usefulness is that they can be used to update the prior belief that the individual has the outcome of interest through a modification of Bayes' theorem. Bayesian analytic techniques can be used for the evaluation of diagnostic tests and estimation of LRs when information concerning a gold standard is not available. As an example, these techniques were applied to the estimation of LRs for a competitive ELISA (c-ELISA) for diagnosis of <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection in cattle and water buffalo in Trinidad. Sera from four herds of cattle (n=391) and four herds of water buffalo (n=381) in Trinidad were evaluated for Brucella-specific antibodies using a c-ELISA. On the basis of previous serologic (agglutination) test results in the same animals, iterative simulation modeling was used to classify animals as positive or negative for Brucella infection. LRs were calculated for six categories of the c-ELISA proportion inhibition (PI) results pooled for cattle and water buffalo and yielded the following estimations (95% probability intervals): &lt;0.10 PI, 0.05 (0-0.13); 0.10-0.249 PI, 0.11 (0.04-0.20); 0.25-0.349 PI, 0.77 (0.23-1.63); 0.35-0.499 PI, 3.22 (1.39-6.84); 0.50-0.749 PI, 17.9 (6.39-77.4); &gt; or =0.75 PI, 423 (129-infinity). LRs are important for calculation of post-test probabilities and maintaining the quantitative nature of diagnostic test results.",M1
15642999,"Efficacy of several serological tests and antigens for diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in the presence of false-positive serological results due to Yersinia enterocolitica O:9.Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 bears a smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) of Brucella sp. O-chain A+C/Y epitopic structure and is a cause of false-positive serological reactions (FPSR) in standard tests for cattle brucellosis. Brucella S-LPS, cross-reacting S-LPSs representing several O-chain epitope combinations, Brucella core lipid A epitopes (rough LPS), <e>Brucella abortus</e> S-LPS-derived polysaccharide, native hapten polysaccharide, rough LPS group 3 outer membrane protein complexes, recombinant BP26, and cytosolic proteins were tested in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) and precipitation tests to detect cattle brucellosis (sensitivity) and to differentiate it from FPSR (specificity). No single serological test and antigen combination showed 100% sensitivity and specificity simultaneously. Immunoprecipitation tests with native hapten polysaccharide, counterimmunoelectrophoresis with cytosolic proteins, and a chaotropic ELISA with Brucella S-LPS were 100% specific but less sensitive than the Rose Bengal test, complement fixation, and indirect ELISA with Brucella S-LPSs and native hapten or S-LPS-derived polysaccharides. A competitive ELISA with Brucella S-LPS and M84 C/Y-specific monoclonal antibody was not 100% specific and was less sensitive than other tests. ELISA with Brucella suis bv. 2 S-LPS (deficient in C epitopes), Escherichia hermannii S-LPSs [lacking the contiguous alpha-(1-2)-linked perosamine residues characteristic of Y. enterocolitica S-LPS], BP26 recombinant protein, and Brucella cytosolic fractions did not provide adequate sensitivity/specificity ratios. Although no serological test and antigen combination fully resolved the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in the presence of FPSR, some are simple and practical alternatives to the brucellin skin test currently recommended for differential diagnosis.",M1
15099717,"A simulation model of brucellosis spread in British cattle under several testing regimes.Brucellosis is a widespread, economically devastating and highly infectious zoonosis. In cattle, infection predominantly is caused by <e>Brucella abortus</e>, and is usually detected in pregnant females through abortions. Great Britain (GB) has been declared free from brucellosis (officially brucellosis free (OBF)) since 1993 and as such is required by European Union (EU) regulations to test &gt; or =20% of both beef and dairy cattle &gt;24 months old routinely. Currently, however, GB serologically tests more cattle than required and the issue of reducing the level of testing has come under consideration. We developed a simulation model to determine the rate of spread of brucellosis under a variety of testing regimes. For dairy herds, we found that reducing the level of testing would have a major effect on the rate of spread of infection, should it be imported. For beef herds, reducing the level of testing would have much less effect. We also found that abortion notification is a very-important additional means of surveillance. As a result of our predictions, policy-makers decided not to reduce the level of testing and actively to promote abortion notification.",M1

A field trial in Mongolia showed cattle, sheep, goat, reindeer, camel, and human sera without infection could be distinguished from Brucella-infected animals by conventional serological tests.",M1
12414165,"How to substantiate eradication of bovine brucellosis when aspecific serological reactions occur in the course of brucellosis testing.Collaborative work was financed by the EU to develop and assess new diagnostic tools that can differentiate between bovine brucellosis and bovine infections due to Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 either in conjunction with, or as an alternative to, the classical serological, bacteriological or allergic skin tests. Sixteen heifers were experimentally infected with <e>Brucella abortus</e> biovar 1 (five heifers), Brucella suis biovar 2 (two heifers), Y. enterocolitica O:9 (six heifers) and Y. enterocolitica O:3 (three heifers). Four heifers, naturally infected with Y. enterocolitica O:9 that presented aspecific brucellosis serological reactions were also included in the experiment. A self-limited infection was induced in cattle by B. suis biovar 2. All the brucellosis serological tests used, i.e. the slow agglutination test (SAW), the Rose Bengal test (RB), the complement fixation test (CFT), indirect and competitive ELISA's, lacked specificity when used to analyze sera from Y. enterocolitica O:9 infected animals. A Yersinia outer membrane proteins (YOPs)-ELISA was also used and although the test is able to detect a Yersinia group infection, it provided no evidence of whether or not there is a possible brucellosis infection when dual infections are present. The brucellergen IFN-gamma test showed a lack of specificity also. The only test that was proven to be specific is the brucellergen skin test. All brucellosis serological tests, except the indirect ELISA, were limited in their ability to detect B. abortus persistently infected animals. Based on these experimental studies, a strategy was implemented as part of the year 2001 Belgian Brucellosis Eradication Program to substantiate the eradication of bovine brucellosis. Epidemiological inquiries have identified risk factors associated with aspecific serological reactions, possible transmission and infection of cattle by B. suis biovar 2 from infected wild boars; and both legal and administrative measures taken by the veterinary services. No cases of bovine brucellosis have been confirmed in Belgium since March 2000.",M1
12414133,"Eradication of bovine brucellosis in the 10th Region de Los Lagos, Chile.The process of Bovine Brucellosis Eradication that began in 1996 in the 10th Region de Los Lagos of Chile will be reviewed. The region comprises the most important dairy area of the country and it has the largest concentration of brucellosis infected herds. Based on the information gathered by an epidemiological surveillance system, the results of the eradication process for the years 1996 till 2001 are presented as rates of Milk Ring Test (MRT) positive dairies, rates of brucellosis reactors (bovines) in livestock markets and slaughterhouses, and the annual incidence and prevalence of brucellosis infected herds. During the period the rates of positive dairies, bovine reactors in livestock markets and slaughterhouses, and the annual incidence and prevalence of infected herds have experienced a decrease, while the rate of bovine reactors in slaughterhouses has remained stable. Data on the preventive measures taken, such as vaccination of female bovines and Certification of Brucellosis Free Herds, are also shown. The surveillance system has allowed the detection of infected herds, while the measures of prevention and cleaning of infected herds have allowed a reduction in the incidence and prevalence of the infection by <e>Brucella abortus</e>.",M1
12414131,"Brucellosis in Central America.Brucellosis is a disease of domestic animals and humans in Central America (CA). Bovine and swine brucellosis caused by <e>Brucella abortus</e> and Brucella suis, respectively, have been identified in all CA countries, while ovine and caprine brucellosis caused by Brucella melitensis has been detected in Guatemala. The prevalence of bovine brucellosis is estimated between 4 and 8%, with higher prevalence in dairy herds, with losses calculated at 25 million US dollars per year. National Control Programs based in calf vaccination and removal of the reactors have had little impact in the control of brucellosis in CA. In a region where experimentation with new vaccines is not affordable, unrestricted adult vaccination by the conjunctival route with S19 is recommended. This strategy is expected to reduce the prevalence and density of the bacteria to numbers where  clean  vaccination would be possible. Thereafter, serological identification and elimination of the reactors could be initiated under more favorable conditions of herd infection.",M1
12414129,"The Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service (APHIS) brucellosis eradication program in the United States.Efforts to eradicate brucellosis caused by <e>Brucella abortus</e> in the United States began in 1934 as part of an economic recovery program to reduce the cattle population because of the Great Depression and concurrent severe drought conditions. A number of states saw this as an opportunity to reduce the level of brucellosis, which was the most significant livestock disease problem in the US at the time. In 1934 and 1935, the reactor rate in adult cattle tested was 11.5%. In 1954, the magnitude of the brucellosis problem in the United States in terms of economics to the cattle industry and human health prompted Congress to appropriate funds for a comprehensive national effort to eradicate brucellosis. The brucellosis eradication program was designed as a cooperative effort between the federal government, the states, and livestock producers. As the science and technology of brucellosis has developed over the years through research and experience, the eradication program has been modified many times. As of 31 December 2000, there were no affected cattle herds in the United States. This was the first time in the history of the brucellosis program that the United States had no known brucellosis affected herds. However, brucellosis has a variable, sometimes quite lengthy incubation period, so it is expected that additional affected herds will be disclosed. It is likely that additional affected herds will be disclosed before brucellosis is finally eradicated from cattle. Animal health officials remain prepared to aggressively pursue any newly disclosed affected herds to eliminate the disease as quickly as possible. The State-Federal Brucellosis Eradication Program has made tremendous progress since its inception. In an eradication program, it is critically important to recognize that, despite all the tools that are available to eliminate the disease, an effective surveillance system is the critical first step that must be in place in order to be successful. It is imperative, not only to be able to find the disease and eliminate it, but to find it before it spreads to susceptible herds. When brucellosis can be identified, contained, and eliminated before spread occurs, eradication can be achieved.",M1
11295336,"Fluorescence polarization assay for the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis: adaptation to field use.A fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) was used to test whole blood samples prepared by mixing blood cells from cattle without exposure to <e>Brucella abortus</e> (B. abortus) with sera from animals with confirmed (bacteriologically) infection. A cut-off value between negative and positive values was initially established to be 87.2mP. This value was changed to 95mP to increase assay specificity without loss of sensitivity when testing blood samples from negative animals. The FPA technology was applied to whole blood samples in the field and to stored whole blood samples using two diluent buffers. Relative sensitivity and specificity values for the FPA performed in the field, based on buffered antigen plate agglutination test and competitive enzyme immunoassay results were 95.3 and 97.3%, respectively. However, to obtain maximum sensitivity and specificity, a cut-off value of 105mP was determined for fresh whole blood samples. The relative sensitivity and specificity values of the FPA when testing stored whole blood samples were 100% each using a 95mP cut-off.The usefulness of the FPA for testing whole blood samples in the field was demonstrated.",M1
10916210,"[History of the eradication of bovine brucellosis in the Czech Republic]In the Czech republic, the program of recovery of the livestock from brucellosis caused by the micro-organisms <e>Brucella abortus</e> was successfully completed in 1964. The campaign started in 1959 by the exploration of the complete cattle population by agglutination tests. Incidence of the disease was 211 positive cases for each 100 thousands, prevalence was 0.676% (20,481 animal in 654 foci of 34 districts). The prevalence was significantly higher in large cattle units. Tens of new cases of the human brucellosis infections were reported. The process of sanitation was first based on the elimination of infected animals. In the later phase the more radical method was employed--the whole herds with infected individuals were eliminated and replaced. During the recovery program more than 41 thousands of infected animals were eliminated. It required solving many complex methodological, legislative, organisational, economical and social problems. Serological test applied to more the half of the livestock population together with epizootiological, epidemiological and laboratory investigation helped to detect all foci. Eradication brought about substantial improvement of the productive and reproductive features of the cattle and eliminated the risks of infection with this zoonosis to the human population.",M1
10458638,"Fluorescence polarization assay: application to the diagnosis of bovine brucellosis in Argentina.A homogeneous fluorescence polarization assay (FPIA) for detection of bovine antibody to <e>Brucella abortus</e> was validated in Argentina Sera were defined based on their reactivity in the buffered antigen plate agglutination test (BPAT) and the competitive enzyme immunoassay (CELISA). Sera negative in these tests were collected from farms without evidence of brucellosis (n=733). Sera positive in the two tests were collected from cattle on farms from which B. abortus was isolated from at least one animal (n=1039). Sera from cattle vaccinated 26, 89, 240 and 272 days previously with B. abortus strain 19 were collected and tested. A cut-off value of 87 mP was determined for the FPIA, resulting in relative sensitivity and specificity values of 98.1 and 99.6%. The specificity for B. abortus strain 19 vaccinated cattle was 64.9% (26 days post vaccination, DPV), 92.1% (89 DPV), 98.6% (242 DPV) and 97.1% (272 DPV). These values were compared to those obtained with the BPAT, the CELISA, the indirect ELISA, the complement fixation test and the 2-mercaptoethanol agglutination test. Sera from 18 cattle which were vaccinated and revaccinated with B. abortus strain 19 were also tested by the same assays and the FPIA was found to be 100% specific. The use of the FPIA as a diagnostic test for brucellosis is discussed.",M1

These sera were previously classified as being <e>Brucella abortus</e>-infected, S-19-vaccinated, or negative after an assessment of historical records and results of 5 standard serologic tests. Most of the sera (85%) from infected cattle precipitated S-LPS, poly B, and PS. Serologic results for poly B and PS were identical. On the other hand, 13% of the sera from vaccinated cattle precipitated S-LPS, but none of these sera precipitated poly B or PS.

To determine the sensitivity and specificity of the immunodiffusion, standard tube, 2-mercaptoethanol, Rivanol, card, and complement fixation tests, sera obtained from 1,328 vaccinated, infected, and seronegative cattle, 56 of which had been examined bacteriologically, were used to evaluate the humoral response to Brucella sp.

2773300,"Evaluation of a delayed-type hypersensitivity test for the diagnosis of <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection in cattle.The delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) test was used to diagnose brucellosis in two cows experimentally induced with brucellosis, and 176 dairy cows from a farm suspected of brucellosis. DTH test results were compared with results of the milk ring test, the serum agglutination test, the complement fixation test and the Coombs test. Cows positive in the DTH test and in one of the other tests were examined bacteriologically. In experimentally infected animals the DTH test was positive 10 days after infection, 1-4 weeks before serologic tests indicated brucellosis. Although the DTH test was positive during the whole experiment, on the one occasion when serologic titres were high, it was negative. Of the 176 dairy cows, 45 were positive in one or more serologic tests. In twelve cows (29%) the diagnosis was inconclusive because they were positive in only one of the serologic tests. In these cases the DTH test confirmed the infection. Three cows with high serologic response tested negative in the DTH test. B. abortus was isolated from 13 of 15 cows examined. We conclude that when serologic results are ambiguous, the DTH test is a useful additional technique for diagnosing brucellosis.",M1

Field strain exposure after vaccination was estimated by the number of cows with brucellosis that calved or aborted in the herd. As the number of exposures increased, the number of cows developing brucellosis increased, and 19 exposures in the 6 herds resulted in 9 new cases. The ratio of exposures to new cases varied from 1.0 to 2.0 in the 4 herds with new cases, whereas 2 herds with 1 and 3 exposures, respectively, did not have new cases of brucellosis. The correlation coefficient between the number of exposures and the number of new cases was 0.85, and the coefficient of determination suggested that 73% of the variation in new cases could be explained by the number of exposures in strain 19-vaccinated herds.",M1

The methods used to monitor dairy herds were testing of all breeding cows over 1 year of age using the rose bengal test (RBT) and complement fixation test (CFT), the bulk milk ring test (BMRT), and testing of blood samples collected at abattoirs using the RBT and CFT. The surveyed herds had at least one whole herd test, and BMRT was done at regular intervals in the period of the survey.

3539295,"A comparison of five serological tests for bovine brucellosis.Five serological assays: the buffered plate antigen test, the standard tube agglutination test, the complement fixation test, the hemolysis-in-gel test and the indirect enzyme immunoassay were diagnostically evaluated. Test data consisted of results from 1208 cattle in brucellosis-free herds, 1578 cattle in reactor herds of unknown infection status and 174 cattle from which <e>Brucella abortus</e> had been cultured. The complement fixation test had the highest specificity in both nonvaccinated and vaccinated cattle. The indirect enzyme immunoassay, if interpreted at a high threshold, also exhibited a high specificity in both groups of cattle. The hemolysis-in-gel test had a very high specificity when used in nonvaccinated cattle but quite a low specificity among vaccinates. With the exception of the complement fixation test, all tests had high sensitivities if interpreted at the minimum threshold. However, the sensitivities of the standard tube agglutination test and indirect enzyme immunoassay, when interpreted at high thresholds were comparable to that of the complement fixation test. A kappa statistic was used to measure the agreement between the various tests. In general the kappa statistics were quite low, suggesting that the various tests may detect different antibody isotypes. There was however, good agreement between the buffered plate antigen test and standard tube agglutination test (the two agglutination tests evaluated) and between the complement fixation test and the indirect enzyme immunoassay when interpreted at a high threshold. With the exception of the buffered plate antigen test, all tests were evaluated as confirmatory tests by estimating their specificity and sensitivity on screening-test positive samples.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M1

Forty-four dams were positive by rivanol and complement-fixation tests and <e>Brucella abortus</e> field strain was isolated from 14. Numbers of expected pregnancies following natural breeding and numbers of viable calves produced were not reduced in the heifers. Persistent B abortus infection was documented in 2 of 37 parturient heifers from reactor dams.

Results of the in vitro lymphocyte transformation test were consistently positive for all 9 Brucella-infected heifers while the skin test was consistently positive for 6 of the 9 heifers. In 7 heifers repeatedly vaccinated with B. abortus strain-19 vaccine the in vitro test classified 3 animals as positive whereas the skin test identified all the animals as infected during most of the experimental period. Four heifers injected with a single dose of B. abortus strain 19 were consistently negative to the lymphocyte transformation test while the skin test classified all the animals as infected during most of the experimental period. The skin test gave strong reactions indicative of Brucella infection in heifers vaccinated with 'Duphavac' and 'Abortox' vaccines whereas the lymphocyte transformation test was consistently negative with these vaccines. The two tests were negative in unexposed cattle. It was concluded that the in vitro test correlated better with Brucella isolation than the in vivo test did and that the lack of agreement between the results of the two tests is likely to be due to the different antigens used in the assays.",M1

Bison (Bison bison) were frequently found infected, but are probably a minor threat to livestock due to their current limited distribution. Most elk (Cervus elaphus) were free of infection except where their range was shared with infected bison or livestock. Deer (Odocoileus spp.), pronghorns (Antilocapra americana), moose (Alces alces), and bighorn sheep (Ovis canadensis) appeared to be insignificant hosts of Brucella abortus. The lack of significant wild ungulate hosts and the distribution of infected livestock herds in the United States suggests that wild ungulates are of little importance in the epidemiology of infections by B. abortus in cattle.",M1

Lymphoid hyperplasia in multiple lymph nodes, lymphoid depletion in the thymic cortex, adrenal cortical hyperplasia, and disseminated inflammatory foci composed mainly of large mononuclear leukocytes were present in infected fetuses. Histopathologic changes in naturally infected fetuses were indistinguishable from those infected fetuses inoculated in utero. Fetuses inoculated with 1.0 X 10(3) to 1.0 X 10(5) colony-forming units of strain 2308 B abortus were aborted on postinoculation day (PID) 7 to 19. Fetuses obtained by PID 9 and 10 had increased immunoglobulin concentrations and antibody. Increased cortisol values were present in fetuses obtained as early as PID 6. The initial fetal inflammatory response was composed of large mononuclear leukocytes. In fetuses obtained by PID 9 to 10, moderate numbers of neutrophils mixed with mononuclear leukocytes were present in the inflammatory foci. This shift in the initial inflammatory reaction coincided with the appearance of agglutinating antibody.",M1
6626063,"Vaccination of cattle against brucellosis using either a reduced dose of strain 19 or one or two doses of 45/20 vaccine.Three groups, each of 14 mature Jersey heifers, were vaccinated. They were mated about 2 months later and those that became pregnant were challenged at about 6.5 months of pregnancy by the conjunctival application of virulent <e>Brucella abortus</e>. Group 1 heifers received 2 doses of B. abortus 45/20 vaccine 2 months apart. Only 5 of the 14 heifers became pregnant, and of these 5 only one resisted challenge. Group 2 heifers received only one dose of 45/20 vaccine, 5 of the 10 challenged resisted infection. Group 3 heifers received 3 x 10(8) cfu of strain 19. Six of the 10 heifers challenged resisted infection. All of 5 non-vaccinated control cattle became infected. It appeared advantageous to give only one dose of 45/20 rather than 2 as presently recommended. A single dose of 45/20 vaccine induced resistance to virulent B. abortus approximately equal to that given by the reduced dose of strain 19. One dose of 45/20 vaccine stimulated transient serological positivity in 2 of 28 heifers whereas the reduced dose of strain 19 gave rise to persistent titres in 2 of 14 vaccinated heifers.",M1

None of the vaccinated heifers was positive by the acidified plate, Rivanol, complement-fixation, or card tests 5 months after inoculation. Sixteen of 21 heifers given S45/20 bacterin with trehalose dimycolate adjuvant had delayed hypersensitivity when skin was tested 7 months after initial vaccination, whereas none of the S19 vaccinates or controls was reactive. After natural breeding, pregnant heifers were challenge exposed at 3.5 to 5 months of gestation with 2.5 X 10(7) viable B abortus S2308 organisms in the conjunctival sac. Abortions occurred as follows: 16/19 (84.2%) of heifers given S45/20 bacterin, 6/12 (50.0%) of heifers vaccinated with S19, and 17/18 (94.4%) of the nonvaccinated controls. Of the 10 heifers that calved normally, only 3 (1 in each group) were seropositive. A correlation was not seen between skin hypersensitivity and acquired resistance. Possible reasons for the poor protection with a reduced dose of S19 vaccine and the failure of S45/20 bacterin to enhance cellular resistance are discussed.",M1

Of the 60 cattle, 48 were vaccinated with either B. abortus 19 or B. abortus 45/20 as calves or as adults. The remaining 12 cattle were not vaccinated. Of the 27 sera from cattle found to be infected, 9 showed aberrant reactions to the CFT. The advantages of the IHLT for these cattle were as follows. After challenge, the titers to the IHLT became positive earlier than or at the same time as the titers to the CFT, they persisted longer than the titers to the CFT, and they failed to show prozone reactions, which are a problem with the CFT. An additional advantage was that before challenge and after vaccination with strain 19, the titers to the IHLT rose later and declined earlier than the titers to the CFT. We concluded that the CFT used in conjunction with the IHLT improves the detection of infected cattle.",M1

It is concluded that serological assays on the seminal plasma alone are inadequate to detect sub-clinically infected animals, and consequently particularly bulls that are intended for use in AI centres should be subjected to a full battery of serological tests as well, before they are certified to be free of brucellosis. The pathology seen in this case was an acute, necrotic orchitis characterized by the presence of numerous granulomas containing the Brucella organisms centrally.",M1

Eighteen heifers had previously been vaccinated with strain 19 or strain 45/20 and nine were unvaccinated. Post-infection serum samples were tested for Brucella antibodies by radioimmunoassay (RIA), complement fixation test (CFT), indirect haemolysis test (IHLT) and Rose Bengal plate test (RBPT). All of the unvaccinated heifers showed strong humoral responses to experimental infection in the RIA, CFT, IHLT and RBPT. The CFT and RBPT became positive sooner after infection than the other tests in the unvaccinated heifers. However, in vaccinated heifers the RIA was the most sensitive test early in infection and the results of the RBPT were variable. Three of the vaccinated heifers showed weak and inconsistent humoral responses and, in these animals, the RIA gave fewer false negative reactions than the other tests.",M1

Comparisons showed that two other abattoirs in the area were slaughtering larger numbers of such cattle, but no cases of human brucellosis were diagnosed there. This suggested an additional risk at the abattoir concerned. All infected men had been employed in a particular part of the works. There was a possibility of movement of aerosols, produced on opening the uteri of pregnant cattle, to other parts of the works, putting a larger number of workers at risk of infection.

Brucella abortus soluble antigen was used as a specific stimulator of lymphocytes. Lymphocyte suspensions were prepared from peripheral blood of cattle by the Ficoll-diatrizoate technique. Cultures were labeled with [3H]thymidine and were assayed for [3H]thymidine incorporation into DNA by liquid scintillation spectrometry. Seroagglutination tests and cultures from Brucella were conducted simultaneously with LST. Brucella abortus soluble antigen induced significantly higher (P less than or equal to 0.005) lymphocyte stimulation responses in lymphocytes from cattle infected with B abortus than in lymphocytes from cattle vaccinated with strain 19 or from nonexposed controls.

Serological responses in agglutination, complement fixation and Rose Bengal tests were typical of those following standard vaccination with Strain B 19 in group B. Iu group C after the booster vaccination, there was a transient rise in titers which lasted about 3 months. Iu group D, titers were infrequent, low, and lasted no more than 8 weeks, after both primary and secondary vaccination. Fifty of the heifers, when 4 1/2 to 6 1/2 months pregnant, were challenged by the conjunctival route, with 16 X 10(6) B. abortus strain 544. Calves were born at full term (greater than or equal to 264 days) to 1/7 heifers in group A, 6/12 in group B, 8/II in group C and 14/19 in group D. Serological tests every two weeks after challenge; bacteriological examination of vaginal mucus, colostrum, foetuses and dead calves; bacterial enumeration of ten mixed samples of lymph nodes and organs taken at slaughter about 6 weeks after parturition, were made to determine the infection status of the heifers. Brucella was isolated at some time from 7/7 heifers in group A, II/I2 in group B, 6/I2 in group C and I4/I9 in group D. Five heifers (2 in B, I in C, 2 in D) cleared themselves of infection between parturition and slaughter, The average degree of infection per group at slaughter, expressed as a logarithmic index of the number of Brucella isolated from the ten samples, was significantly lower in the three vaccinated groups than in the controls, and in groups C and D than in groups B, and it was not significantly different in group C and D. For field vaccination, a booster vaccination by the conjunctival route, as in group C, would provide more protection than the standard vaccination without serious interference in routine diagnostic tests.

20461292,"The feasibility of using antigens prepared with rough Brucella strains for diagnosis of canine brucellosis.Clinical diagnosis of canine brucellosis is not sensitive enough and a negative blood culture cannot rule out the disease. Indirect methods of serological testing such as agar gel immunodiffusion (AGID), rapid slide agglutination test (RSAT) and indirect enzyme linked immunoassay (IELISA) are preferred for routine diagnosis. Since Brucella canis shares antigenic components with the Brucella ovis and <e>Brucella abortus</e> RB51 strain, it would seem that either strain could be used as antigen. We present data on AGID and IELISA tests using the B. ovis antigen, RSAT and IELISA using the B. canis antigen and IELISA using the B. abortus RB51 antigen. The cut-off values were adjusted by the ROC analysis; the IELISA-B. ovis cut-off value was 23 (%P) and the IELISA-B. abortus RB51, 24 (%P), with 100% sensitivity and 98.8% specificity. RSAT detected 100% of positive cases, while AGID was less sensitive. The sera from dogs treated with antibiotic showed that %P correlated well with the clinical course. Sera from dogs presumptively infected with B. suis were negative in all tests performed with the rough Brucella strains. RSAT is a very sensitive screening test and IELISA-B. canis, B. ovis and B. abortus RB51 could be used as confirmatory tests, since they show good specificity and sensitivity.",M2
20400542,"Identification of the quorum-sensing target DNA sequence and N-Acyl homoserine lactone responsiveness of the <e>Brucella abortus</e> virB promoter.VjbR is a LuxR-type quorum-sensing (QS) regulator that plays an essential role in the virulence of the intracellular facultative pathogen Brucella, the causative agent of brucellosis. It was previously described that VjbR regulates a diverse group of genes, including the virB operon. The latter codes for a type IV secretion system (T4SS) that is central for the pathogenesis of Brucella. Although the regulatory role of VjbR on the virB promoter (P(virB)) was extensively studied by different groups, the VjbR-binding site had not been identified so far. Here, we identified the target DNA sequence of VjbR in P(virB) by DNase I footprinting analyses. Surprisingly, we observed that VjbR specifically recognizes a sequence that is identical to a half-binding site of the QS-related regulator MrtR of Mesorhizobium tianshanense. As shown by DNase I footprinting and electrophoretic mobility shift assays, generation of a palindromic MrtR-like-binding site in P(virB) increased both the affinity and the stability of the VjbR-DNA complex, which confirmed that the QS regulator of Brucella is highly related to that of M. tianshanense. The addition of N-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone dissociated VjbR from the promoter, which confirmed previous reports that indicated a negative effect of this signal on the VjbR-mediated activation of P(virB). Our results provide new molecular evidence for the structure of the virB promoter and reveal unusual features of the QS target DNA sequence of the main regulator of virulence in Brucella.",M2
20385349,"The development of a selective medium for the <e>Brucella abortus</e> strains and its comparison with the currently recommended and used medium.The Brucella spp. are fastidious and relatively slow-growing organisms. The isolation of such strains in a variety of specimens often requires the use of a selective medium to reduce or eliminate the growth of unexpected microorganisms. The modified Brucella selective (MBS) medium, which contains improved antibiotic mixtures, erythritol as the only carbon source, and neutral red as a pH indicator, showed good selectivity for the Brucella abortus strains, including the RB51 vaccine strain. Erythritol in the MBS medium was able to promote and/or recover the delayed growth of the B. abortus strains through the antibiotic mixtures. The Brucella colonies, which assumed a pinkish color at their central part, were easily differentiated from other organisms. The MBS medium also allows the isolation of the Brucella strains even in contaminated specimens and/or in specimens containing small numbers of viable organisms. Moreover, this medium can be applied to environmental samples for the isolation of the Brucella strains, and it can thus offer epidemiologic traceback sources for the dissemination or transfer of diseases. Therefore, the MBS medium can be applied as a useful tool of important control measures in the eradication programs.",M2
20382762,"PdhS, an old-pole-localized histidine kinase, recruits the fumarase FumC in <e>Brucella abortus</e>.The bacterial pathogen Brucella abortus was recently demonstrated to recruit the essential cytoplasmic histidine kinase PdhS to its old pole. Here, we report identification of the fumarase FumC as a specific partner for the N-terminal  sensing  domain of PdhS, using an ORFeome-based yeast two-hybrid screen. We observed that FumC and PdhS colocalize at the old pole of B. abortus, while the other fumarase FumA is not polarly localized. FumC is not required for PdhS localization, and polar FumC localization is not FumA dependent. FumC homologs are not polarly localized in Sinorhizobium meliloti and Caulobacter crescentus, suggesting that polar recruitment of FumC by PdhS is evolutionarily recent.",M2
20380737,"<e>Brucella abortus</e> ure2 region contains an acid-activated urea transporter and a nickel transport system.BACKGROUND: Urease is a virulence factor that plays a role in the resistance of Brucella to low pH conditions, both in vivo and in vitro. Brucella contains two separate urease gene clusters, ure1 and ure2. Although only ure1 codes for an active urease, ure2 is also transcribed, but its contribution to Brucella biology is unknown. RESULTS: Re-examination of the ure2 locus showed that the operon includes five genes downstream of ureABCEFGDT that are orthologs to a nikKMLQO cluster encoding an ECF-type transport system for nickel. ureT and nikO mutants were constructed and analyzed for urease activity and acid resistance. A non-polar ureT mutant was unaffected in urease activity at neutral pH but showed a significantly decreased activity at acidic pH. It also showed a decreased survival rate to pH 2 at low concentration of urea when compared to the wild type. The nikO mutant had decreased urease activity and acid resistance at all urea concentrations tested, and this phenotype could be reverted by the addition of nickel to the growth medium. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we concluded that the operon ure2 codes for an acid-activated urea transporter and a nickel transporter necessary for the maximal activity of the urease whose structural subunits are encoded exclusively by the genes in the ure1 operon.",M2
20194591,"The <e>Brucella abortus</e> phosphoglycerate kinase mutant is highly attenuated and induces protection superior to that of vaccine strain 19 in immunocompromised and immunocompetent mice.Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in domestic animals and undulant fever in humans. The mechanism of virulence of Brucella spp. is not yet fully understood. Therefore, it is crucial to identify new molecules that can function as virulence factors to better understand the host-pathogen interplay. Herein, we identified the gene encoding the phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) of B. abortus strain 2308. To test the role of PGK in Brucella pathogenesis, a pgk deletion mutant was constructed. Replacement of the wild-type pgk by recombination was demonstrated by Southern and Western blot analyses. The B. abortus Delta pgk mutant strain exhibited extreme attenuation in bone marrow-derived macrophages and in vivo in BALB/c, C57BL/6, 129/Sv, and interferon regulatory factor-1 knockout (IRF-1 KO) mice. Additionally, at 24 h postinfection the Delta pgk mutant was not found within the same endoplasmic reticulum-derived compartment as the wild-type bacteria, but, instead, over 60% of Brucella-containing vacuoles (BCVs) retained the late endosomal/lysosomal marker LAMP1. Furthermore, the B. abortus Delta pgk deletion mutant was used as a live vaccine. Challenge experiments revealed that the Delta pgk mutant strain induced protective immunity in 129/Sv or IRF-1 KO mice that was superior to the protection conferred by commercial strain 19 or RB51. Finally, the results shown here demonstrated that Brucella PGK is critical for full bacterial virulence and that a Delta pgk mutant may serve as a potential vaccine candidate in future studies.",M2
20147498,"Evaluation of indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and IgG avidity assays using a protein A-peroxidase conjugate for serological distinction between <e>Brucella abortus</e> S19-vaccinated and -infected cows.This study aimed to evaluate the use of protein A-peroxidase (horseradish peroxidase [HRPO]) in indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (iELISAs) and IgG avidity assays for serological distinction between Brucella abortus S19-vaccinated and -infected cows. Four groups were analyzed: GI, 41 nonvaccinated seropositive cows; GII, 79 S19-vaccinated heifers analyzed at 3 months postvaccination; GIII, 105 S19-vaccinated cows analyzed after 24 months of age; and GIV, 278 nonvaccinated seronegative cows. IgG levels and avidity to B. abortus smooth lipopolysaccharide (S-LPS) were determined using anti-bovine IgG-HRPO or protein A-HRPO conjugates. Similar levels of IgG anti-S-LPS were found with GI using both conjugates. Lower IgG levels were detected with GII, GIII, and GIV using protein A-HRPO. Both conjugates showed high performance in discriminating GI from GIII, with high sensitivity (Se; 97.6%) and specificity (Sp; 97.1%). Protein A-HRPO was better in distinguishing GI from GIV (Se, 97.6%; Sp, 94.6%) and GI from GII (Se, 80.5%; Sp, 94.9%). Protein A-HRPO excluded a higher number of positive samples with GII and GIV. IgG avidity showed that protein A-HRPO, but not anti-IgG-HRPO, was able to distinguish nonvaccinated from vaccinated cattle, showing a higher avidity index (AI) with GI than with GII, with 78% of serum samples in GII showing an AI of &lt;50%. Therefore, the iELISA using B. abortus S-LPS antigen and protein A-HRPO conjugate for preferential detection of the IgG2 subclass was shown to be suitable for serological distinction between S19-vaccinated and -infected cows. Also, antibodies generated after vaccination showed lower avidity, suggesting a role for the IgG2 subclass as an antibody of higher-affinity maturation after infection, constituting an additional tool for differentiating vaccinated from infected cattle.",M2
20140321,"[<e>Brucella abortus</e> endocarditis: survival of a 74 year old patient]Brucellosis is not frequent in Chile but it may present with life threatening complications like endocarditis. The case reported refers to a 74 year old man admitted to the Infectious Diseases Hospital Dr. Lucio Córdova in Santiago. He had been febrile for 3 months with no specific symptoms. The trans-esophageal echocardiography confirmed multiple large vegetations and important involvement of the aortic valve. Blood cultures yielded Brucella abortus. The patient required cardiac surgery, along with antibiotics, and he had a satisfactory outcome, being alive at the moment of this report???. Brucellosis can be the responsible for prolonged fever of unknown origin. It is necessary to take in mind brucellosis to obtain the specific laboratory tests.

20093762,"Comparative study of gamma interferon production in mice immunized with outer membrane proteins and whole bacteria of <e>Brucella abortus</e>.Brucella abortus is the intracellular bacterium that causes bovine brucellosis and a chronic human disease known as undulant fever. Interferon (IFN)-gamma plays critical roles in defending against intracellular bacterial infection. In this experiment, we demonstrated the difference in IFN-gamma production between the splenocytes of mice inoculated with outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of B. abortus and whole live bacteria. Our results showed that the OMP-inoculated group showed more IFN-gamma production than did the bacteria-infected group, suggesting that OMPs are candidates for the induction of immune response.",M2
20093491,"<e>Brucella abortus</e> induces the secretion of proinflammatory mediators from glial cells leading to astrocyte apoptosis.Central nervous system (CNS) invasion by bacteria of the genus Brucella results in an inflammatory disorder called neurobrucellosis. In this study we present in vivo and in vitro evidence that B. abortus and its lipoproteins activate the innate immunity of the CNS, eliciting an inflammatory response that leads to astrogliosis, a characteristic feature of neurobrucellosis. Intracranial injection of heat-killed B. abortus (HKBA) or outer membrane protein 19 (Omp19), a B. abortus lipoprotein model, induced astrogliosis in mouse striatum. Moreover, infection of astrocytes and microglia with B. abortus induced the secretion of interleukin (IL)-6, IL-1beta, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, macrophage chemoattractant protein-1, and KC (CXCL1). HKBA also induced these inflammatory mediators, suggesting the involvement of a structural component of the bacterium. Accordingly, Omp19 induced the same cytokine and chemokine secretion pattern. B. abortus infection induced astrocyte, but not microglia, apoptosis. Indeed, HKBA and Omp19 elicited not only astrocyte apoptosis but also proliferation, two features observed during astrogliosis. Apoptosis induced by HKBA and L-Omp19 was completely suppressed in cells of TNF receptor p55-/- mice or when the general caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK was added to cultures. Hence, TNF-alpha signaling via TNF receptor (TNFR) 1 through the coupling of caspases determines apoptosis. Our results provide proof of the principle that Brucella lipoproteins could be key virulence factors in neurobrucellosis and that astrogliosis might contribute to neurobrucellosis pathogenesis.",M2
20090021,"Evaluation of the Western immunoblot as a detection method for <e>Brucella abortus</e> exposure in elk.Brucella abortus has been an important wildlife disease issue for most of the last century, especially because wildlife species are considered to be important disease reservoirs for cattle. Diagnostic uncertainty, caused in part by cross-reactions of antibodies to environmental pathogens such as Yersinia enterocolitica O:9 on standard Brucella serology, has exacerbated the challenges of managing the disease and has highlighted the need for test validation in wildlife species. The western immunoblot was evaluated for use in detecting B. abortus exposure in elk (Cervus elaphus) and for ruling out exposure to cross-reacting bacteria. Samples collected from 2003 to 2006, including 54 female and immature elk from four different elk herds, were tested using standard Brucella serologic methods (card, rapid automated presumptive [RAP], and rivanol tests), as well as the western immunoblot. Samples (n=28) from animals known to be naturally infected with B. abortus biovar 1 served as positive controls. For presumed negative samples, sera (n=26) were collected from two elk herds in which negative serologic tests, and the absence of clinical signs of disease such as abortions, supported Brucella-negative classification. In addition to these study samples, serologic data from 12 tule elk (Cervus elaphus nannodes) were provided from the California Department of Fish and Game in order to illustrate a field application of the western blot. The western immunoblot had the highest sensitivity (1.0; % 0.899-1.0) and specificity (1.0; 0.891-1.0) among all tests used in the study. The Kappa statistic for agreement between the western blot and the card, rivanol, and RAP tests were 0.701, 0.808, and 0.921, respectively, showing good to excellent agreement with the standard diagnostic tests currently in use. Although the western immunoblot is more expensive and time intensive than other tests, in this limited study, it was shown to be reliable for establishing and confirming B. abortus disease status in elk. In addition to this study, subsequent applications of the western blot assay have been successful in detecting Yersinia sp. exposure in elk after their antibodies cross-reacted on standard Brucella serology.",M2
20064480,"An IL-15 adjuvant enhances the efficacy of a combined DNA vaccine against Brucella by increasing the CD8+ cytotoxic T cell response.We investigated whether a combined DNA vaccine delivered together with the IL-15 gene (DNA-IL-15(+)) enhanced the immune response against <e>Brucella abortus</e> in mice. Mice vaccinated with DNA-IL-15(+) developed a robust humoral response; Brucella-specific antibodies exhibited a dominance of immunoglobulin G2a (IgG2a) over IgG1. Splenocytes from DNA-IL-15(+)-vaccinated mice induced significantly higher levels of IFN-gamma (P&lt;0.01) and CD8(+) T cell response (P&lt;0.01), suggesting induction of a T-helper-1-dominated immune response. In a specific cytotoxic-T-lymphocyte activity assay, DNA-IL-15(+) immunization elicited mainly CD8(+) T cells, which mediate cytotoxicity, but also CD4(+) T cells. In vivo depletion of T cell subsets showed that the DNA-IL-15(+)-induced protection against Brucella infection is mediated predominantly by CD8(+) T cells, although CD4(+) T cells also contribute. These data indicate that plasmid-delivered IL-15 increases the efficacy of the Brucella DNA vaccine.",M2
20053755,"Antihepcidin antibody treatment modulates iron metabolism and is effective in a mouse model of inflammation-induced anemia.Iron maldistribution has been implicated in multiple diseases, including the anemia of inflammation (AI), atherosclerosis, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Iron metabolism is controlled by hepcidin, a 25-amino acid peptide. Hepcidin is induced by inflammation, causes iron to be sequestered, and thus, potentially contributes to AI. Human hepcidin (hHepc) overexpression in mice caused an iron-deficient phenotype, including stunted growth, hair loss, and iron-deficient erythropoiesis. It also caused resistance to supraphysiologic levels of erythropoiesis-stimulating agent, supporting the hypothesis that hepcidin may influence response to treatment in AI. To explore the role of hepcidin in inflammatory anemia, a mouse AI model was developed with heat-killed <e>Brucella abortus</e> treatment. Suppression of hepcidin mRNA was a successful anemia treatment in this model. High-affinity antibodies specific for hHepc were generated, and hHepc knock-in mice were produced to enable antibody testing. Antibody treatment neutralized hHepc in vitro and in vivo and facilitated anemia treatment in hHepc knock-in mice with AI. These data indicate that antihepcidin antibodies may be an effective treatment for patients with inflammatory anemia. The ability to manipulate iron metabolism in vivo may also allow investigation of the role of iron in a number of other pathologic conditions.",M2
20003465,"EEVD motif of heat shock cognate protein 70 contributes to bacterial uptake by trophoblast giant cells.BACKGROUND: The uptake of abortion-inducing pathogens by trophoblast giant (TG) cells is a key event in infectious abortion. However, little is known about phagocytic functions of TG cells against the pathogens. Here we show that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) contributes to bacterial uptake by TG cells and the EEVD motif of Hsc70 plays an important role in this. METHODS: <e>Brucella abortus</e> and Listeria monocytogenes were used as the bacterial antigen in this study. Recombinant proteins containing tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains were constructed and confirmation of the binding capacity to Hsc70 was assessed by ELISA. The recombinant TPR proteins were used for investigation of the effect of TPR proteins on bacterial uptake by TG cells and on pregnancy in mice. RESULTS: The monoclonal antibody that inhibits bacterial uptake by TG cells reacted with the EEVD motif of Hsc70. Bacterial TPR proteins bound to the C-terminal of Hsc70 through its EEVD motif and this binding inhibited bacterial uptake by TG cells. Infectious abortion was also prevented by blocking the EEVD motif of Hsc70. CONCLUSIONS: Our results demonstrate that surface located Hsc70 on TG cells mediates the uptake of pathogenic bacteria and proteins containing the TPR domain inhibit the function of Hsc70 by binding to its EEVD motif. These molecules may be useful in the development of methods for preventing infectious abortion.",M2
19968852,"Outbreak of brucellosis in domestic elk in Korea.Seven of 18 elk on a deer farm were found by the official Rose-Bengal agglutination test (RBT) and tube agglutination test to be brucellosis reactors/suspects. Evaluation with the competitive ELISA (C-ELISA) and the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) tests revealed that six and five sera were positive respectively. The seven reactors/ suspects were slaughtered and their blood and tissues were collected. Brucella species could be isolated from three of the slaughtered animals, with nine isolates being obtained from the popliteal, supramammary and submandibular lymph nodes, vaginal discharge, mammary tissue and spleen. Brucella genus-specific PCR based on 16S rRNA and AMOS-PCR, which is specific for differential Brucella species, revealed that all nine isolates were <e>Brucella abortus</e>. These nine were further confirmed to be B. abortus biovar 1 by classical biotyping scheme assays. This is the first report of an outbreak of brucellosis in domestic elk in Korea. Our observations suggest that deer should be included in the routine Brucella surveillance programme for the effective control and prevention of brucellosis in Korea.",M2

Using the DeltaznuA B. abortus 2308 mutant, a second mutation was introduced by deleting purE gene. The DeltaznuA DeltapurE B. abortus 2308 strain was less capable of surviving in macrophages. When evaluated in vivo, it was cleared within 8 weeks (wks) from mice, causing significantly less inflammation than spleens obtained from wild-type B. abortus 2308-infected mice. Furthermore, two doses of DeltaznuA DeltapurE B. abortus 2308 conferred 0.79 log protection, similar to S19 as did a single dose of DeltaznuA B. abortus 2308. Thus, this study shows the DeltaznuA DeltapurE B. abortus 2308 strain to be a potential livestock vaccine candidate.",M2
19901378,"Oral vaccination with microencapsuled strain 19 vaccine confers enhanced protection against <e>Brucella abortus</e> strain 2308 challenge in red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus).Bison (Bison bison) and elk (Cervus elaphus nelsoni) in the Greater Yellowstone Area (GYA), USA, are infected with Brucella abortus, the causative agent of bovine brucellosis, and they serve as a wildlife reservoir for the disease. Bovine brucellosis recently has been transmitted from infected elk to cattle in Montana, Wyoming, and Idaho and has resulted in their loss of brucellosis-free status. An efficacious Brucella vaccine with a delivery system suitable for wildlife would be a valuable tool in a disease prevention and control program. We evaluated Strain 19 (S19) in a sustained release vehicle consisting of alginate microspheres containing live vaccine. In a challenge study using red deer (Cervus elaphus elaphus) as a model for elk, alginate, a naturally occurring polymer combined with a protein of Fasciola hepatica vitelline protein B was used to microencapsulate S19. Red deer were orally or subcutaneously immunized with 1.5 x 10(10) colony-forming units (CFUs) using microencapsulated S19. Humoral and cellular profiles were analyzed bimonthly throughout the study. The vaccinated red deer and nonvaccinated controls were challenged 1 yr postimmunization conjunctivally with 1 x 10(9) CFUs of B. abortus strain 2308. Red deer vaccinated with oral microencapsulated S19 had a statistically significant lower bacterial tissue load compared with controls. These data indicate for the first time that protection against Brucella-challenge can be achieved by combining a commonly used vaccine with a novel oral delivery system such as alginate-vitelline protein B microencapsulation. This system is a potential improvement for efficacious Brucella-vaccine delivery to wildlife in the GYA.",M2
19863821,"Application and evaluation of the MLVA typing assay for the <e>Brucella abortus</e> strains isolated in Korea.BACKGROUND: A Brucella eradication program has been executed in Korea. To effectively prevent and control brucellosis, a molecular method for genetic identification and epidemiological trace-back must be established. As part of that, the MLVA typing assay was evaluated and applied to B. abortus isolates for analyzing the characteristics of the regional distribution and relationships of foreign isolates. RESULTS: A total of 177 isolates originating from 105 cattle farms for the period 1996 to 2008 were selected as representatives for the nine provinces of South Korea. A dendrogram of strain relatedness was constructed in accordance with the number of tandem repeat units for 17 loci so that it was possible to trace back in the restricted areas. Even in a farm contaminated by one source, however, the Brucella isolates showed an increase or decrease in one TRs copy number at some loci with high DI values. Moreover, those 17 loci was confirmed in stability via in-vitro and in-vivo passage, and found to be sufficiently stable markers that can readily identify the inoculated strain even if minor changes were detected. In the parsimony analysis with foreign Brucella isolates, domestic isolates were clustered distinctively, and located near the Central and Southern American isolates. CONCLUSION: The MLVA assay has enough discrimination power in the Brucella species level and can be utilized as a tool for the epidemiological trace-back of the B. abortus isolates. But it is important to consider that Brucella isolates may be capable of undergoing minor changes at some loci in the course of infection or in accordance with the changes of the host.",M2
19854911,"Metabolic control of virulence genes in <e>Brucella abortus</e>: HutC coordinates virB expression and the histidine utilization pathway by direct binding to both promoters.Type IV secretion systems (T4SS) are multicomponent machineries involved in the translocation of effector molecules across the bacterial cell envelope. The virB operon of Brucella abortus codes for a T4SS that is essential for virulence and intracellular multiplication of the bacterium in the host. Previous studies showed that the virB operon of B. abortus is tightly regulated within the host cells. In order to identify factors implicated in the control of virB expression, we searched for proteins of Brucella that directly bind to the virB promoter (P(virB)). Using different procedures, we isolated a 27-kDa protein that binds specifically to P(virB). This protein was identified as HutC, the transcriptional repressor of the histidine utilization (hut) genes. Analyses of virB and hut promoter activity revealed that HutC exerts two different roles: it acts as a coactivator of transcription of the virB operon, whereas it represses the hut genes. Such activities were observed both intracellularly and in bacteria incubated under conditions that resemble the intracellular environment. Electrophoresis mobility shift assays (EMSA) and DNase I footprinting experiments revealed the structure, affinity, and localization of the HutC-binding sites and supported the regulatory role of HutC in both hut and virB promoters. Taken together, these results indicate that Brucella coopted the function of HutC to coordinate the Hut pathway with transcriptional regulation of the virB genes, probably as a way to sense its own metabolic state and develop adaptive responses to overcome intracellular host defenses.",M2
19824392,"Expression of human serum albumin--L7/L12 (<e>Brucella abortus</e> ribosomal protein) fusion protein in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes abortion in pregnant cattle and undulant fever in humans. The immunogenic B. abortus ribosomal protein L7/L12 is a promising candidate antigen for the development of subunit vaccines against brucellosis. It has already been expressed in several bacteria and has been used as DNA vaccine. In order to construct yeast expressing vector for the tHSA-L7/L12 fusion protein, the l7/l12 ribosomal gene was amplified by PCR. The expression plasmid pYtHSA-L7/L12 was constructed by inserting the L7/L12 gene into the pYHSA5 shuttle vector (containing inulinase signal sequence, HSA gene and Gal10 promoter). The recombinant vector was transformed into S. cerevisiae and was then induced by galactose. The secreted recombinant fusion protein was detected in supernatant by SDS-PAGE and confirmed by western blot analysis using anti-HSA and anti-L7/L12 antibodies. Fusion protein was purified by affinity chromatography and its amount was approximately 500 microg/liter.",M2

19747534,"<e>Brucella abortus</e> induces Irgm3 and Irga6 expression via type-I IFN by a MyD88-dependent pathway, without the requirement of TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9.The innate immune system senses bacterial pathogens by pattern recognition receptors, such as the well-characterised Toll-like Receptors (TLR). The activation of TLR signalling cascades depends on several adaptor proteins, among which MyD88 plays a key role in triggering innate immune responses. Here, we show in murine macrophages that Brucella abortus triggers expression of the interferon-inducible resistance proteins (IRGs, p47 GTPases) via type-I IFN secretion at late time points, when Brucella has reached its replication niche. This induction requires the adaptor molecule MyD88 but does not involve the TLRs normally implicated in sensing Gram-negative bacteria, namely TLR2, TLR4, TLR5 and TLR9. Brucella mutants lacking the functional VirB type-IV secretion system were not capable of inducing Irgm3 and Irga6 expression, suggesting that the type-IV secretion system is part of the triggering of the activation process. Our data suggest that Brucella is recognized intracellularly by an unknown receptor, different from the conventional ones used for Gram-negative sensing, but one that nevertheless signals through MyD88.",M2
19737422,"Participation of ezrin in bacterial uptake by trophoblast giant cells.BACKGROUND: Trophoblast giant (TG) cells are involved in systematic removal of bacterial pathogens from the maternal-fetal interface of the placenta. In particular, TG cells have the ability to take up extracellular antigens by active phagocytosis induced by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma). We previously reported that heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70) present on the surface of TG cells mediated the uptake of <e>Brucella abortus</e>. However, the mechanism of bacterial uptake by TG cells is not completely understood. Here we identified ezrin, a member of ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) protein family, as a molecule associated with Hsc70. METHODS: Mouse TG cells were employed in all experiments, and B. abortus was used as the bacterial antigen. Confirmation of the binding capacity of ERM protein was assessed by pull-down assay and ELISA using recombinant Hsc70 and ERM proteins. Ezrin was depleted using siRNA and the depletion examined by immunoblotting or immunofluorescence staining. RESULTS: The expression level of ezrin was higher in TG cells than in trophoblast stem (TS) cells, and ezrin knockdown TG cells showed a reduction in bacterial uptake ability. Although tyrosine phosphorylation of ezrin was not related to bacterial uptake activity, localization of Hsc70 on the membrane was affected by the depletion of ezrin in TG cells. CONCLUSION: Ezrin associates with Hsc70 that locates on the membrane of TG cells and participates in the bacterial uptake by TG cells.",M2
19714247,"Caspase-2 mediated apoptotic and necrotic murine macrophage cell death induced by rough <e>Brucella abortus</e>.Brucella species are Gram-negative, facultative intracellular bacteria that cause zoonotic brucellosis. Survival and replication inside macrophages is critical for establishment of chronic Brucella infection. Virulent smooth B. abortus strain 2308 inhibits programmed macrophage cell death and replicates inside macrophages. Cattle B. abortus vaccine strain RB51 is an attenuated rough, lipopolysaccharide O antigen-deficient mutant derived from smooth strain 2308. B. abortus rough mutant RA1 contains a single wboA gene mutation in strain 2308. Our studies demonstrated that live RB51 and RA1, but not strain 2308 or heat-killed Brucella, induced both apoptotic and necrotic cell death in murine RAW264.7 macrophages and bone marrow derived macrophages. The same phenomenon was also observed in primary mouse peritoneal macrophages from mice immunized intraperitoneally with vaccine strain RB51 using the same dose as regularly performed in protection studies. Programmed macrophage cell death induced by RB51 and RA1 was inhibited by a caspase-2 inhibitor (Z-VDVAD-FMK). Caspase-2 enzyme activation and cleavage were observed at the early infection stage in macrophages infected with RB51 and RA1 but not strain 2308. The inhibition of macrophage cell death promoted the survival of rough Brucella cells inside macrophages. The critical role of caspase-2 in mediating rough B. abortus induced macrophage cell death was confirmed using caspase-2 specific shRNA. The mitochondrial apoptosis pathway was activated in macrophages infected with rough B. abortus as demonstrated by increase in mitochondrial membrane permeability and the release of cytochrome c to cytoplasm in macrophages infected with rough Brucella. These results demonstrate that rough B. abortus strains RB51 and RA1 induce apoptotic and necrotic murine macrophage cell death that is mediated by caspase-2. The biological relevance of Brucella O antigen and caspase-2-mediated macrophage cell death in Brucella pathogenesis and protective Brucella immunity is discussed.",M2
19687621,"Efficacy of strain RB51 vaccine in protecting infection and vertical transmission against <e>Brucella abortus</e> in Sprague-Dawley rats.Immunizing animals in the wild against Brucella (B.) abortus is essential to control bovine brucellosis because cattle can get the disease through close contact with infected wildlife. The aim of this experiment was to evaluate the effectiveness of the B. abortus strain RB51 vaccine in protecting infection as well as vertical transmission in Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats against B. abortus biotype 1. Virgin female SD rats (n = 48) two months of age were divided into two groups: one group (n = 24) received RB51 vaccine intraperitoneally with 3 x 10(10) colony forming units (CFU) and the other group (n = 24) was used as non-vaccinated control. Non-vaccinated and RB51-vaccinated rats were challenged with 1.5 x 10(9) CFU of virulent B. abortus biotype 1 six weeks after vaccination. Three weeks after challenge, all rats were bred. Verification of RB51-vaccine induced protection in SD rats was determined by bacteriological, serological and molecular screening of maternal and fetal tissues at necropsy. The RB51 vaccine elicited 81.25% protection in SD rats against infection with B. abortus biotype 1. Offspring from rats vaccinated with RB51 had a decreased (p &lt; 0.05) prevalence of vertical transmission of B. abortus biotype 1 compared to the offspring from non-vaccinated rats (20.23% and 87.50%, respectively). This is the first report of RB51 vaccination efficacy against the vertical transmission of B. abortus in the SD rat model.",M2
19643148,"Epigallocatechin gallate ameliorates chronic fatigue syndrome in mice: behavioral and biochemical evidence.Three decades after the coining of the term chronic fatigue syndrome, the diagnosis of this illness is still symptom based and the aetiology remains elusive. Chronic fatigue syndrome pathogenesis seems to be multifactorial and the possible involvement of immune system is supported. The present study was designed to evaluate the effects of the epigallocatechin gallate in a mouse model of immunologically induced chronic fatigue. On 19th day, after lipopolysaccharide/<e>Brucella abortus</e> administration, the mice showed significant increase in immobility period, post swim fatigue and thermal hyperalgesia. Behavioral deficits were coupled with enhanced oxidative-nitrosative stress as evident by increased lipid peroxidation, nitrite levels and decreased endogenous antioxidant enzymes (superoxide dismutase, reduced glutathione and catalase) and inflammation (increased levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha and tissue growth factor-beta). Chronic treatment with epigallocatechin gallate restored these behavioral and biochemical alterations in mice. The present study points out towards the beneficial effect of epigallocatechin gallate in the amelioration of chronic fatigue syndrome and thus may provide a new, effective and powerful strategy to treat chronic fatigue syndrome.",M2
19617483,"Pathogenesis and epidemiology of brucellosis in yellowstone bison: serologic and culture results from adult females and their progeny.Our objective in this prospective study was to determine the natural course of <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection in cohorts of seropositive and seronegative, female bison (Bison bison) and their offspring in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) for 5 yr. We collected specimens from 53 adult females and 25 calves at least once and from 45 adults and 22 calves more than once. Annual seroconversion rates (negative to positive) were relatively high (23% for calves and juvenile bison, 6% in the total sample of adult female bison in our study, and 11% in the adult females that began the study as seronegatives). Antibody was not protective against infection, even for calves that passively received antibody from an infected mother's colostrum. Antibody levels stayed remarkably constant, with only a slow decline over time. We found only two seroconversions from a weak positive status to negative. Infected bison aborted and shed viable bacteria. Risk of shedding infective Brucella was highest for bison in the 2 yr following seroconversion from negative to positive. In one bison, we detected shedding for 3 yr following seroconversion. Regardless of serostatus of dams and neonates, most calves were seronegative by 5 mo of age. There was no relationship between the antibody status of the dam and the tendency of a calf to seroconvert to positive during the duration of the study.",M2

The blood samples were collected from dairy cows with history of abortion (n=234) as well as from pregnant cows that were (n=323) kept in the same ranches. N. caninum seroprevalence was 10.77% (60/557). The co-existence rate of N. caninum seropositivity with T. gondii, B. abortus and L. monocytogenes was 24.77% (138/557), 13.82% (77/557) and 42.85% (162/378), respectively. Only one animal had significant antibody titers for all analyzed infectious agents. The seroprevalence of N. caninum and T. gondii were significantly higher in pregnant cows than aborted cows (p&lt;0.05 and p&lt;0.001, respectively). As a result, the comprehensive data generated through this study can significantly contribute to understanding of serologic association of N. caninum with T. gondii, B. abortus and L. monocytogenes in pregnant and aborted dairy cows.",M2
19579969,"Effects of <e>Brucella abortus</e> biotype 1 infection on the reproductive performance of Sprague-Dawley rats.The aim of this study was to assess the impact of Brucella abortus biotype 1 infection on the reproductive performance using Sprague-Dawley (SD) rat model. Virgin female SD rats (n = 24) were infected intraperitoneally with 0.1 mL of saline containing 1 x 10(11) Colony Forming Unit (CFU) of pathogenic B. abortus biotype 1 Korean bovine isolate. Control rats (n = 24) were inoculated with 0.1 mL of apyrogenic saline. Both inoculated and control rats were divided into six subgroups. Four rats in each subgroup were consistently bred at 3, 7, 14, 21, 28 and 60 days after infection. B. abortus infection induced 41.67% infertility in the infected rats. The mean number of offspring/litter was 8.71 +/- 2.01 for infected rats and 12.87 +/- 1.42 for control rats (p &lt; 0.001). The mean weight of the viable offspring was 6.10 +/- 0.36 g for infected rats and 7.15 +/- 0.40 g for control rats (p &lt; 0.001). The rate of stillbirth was 12.30% in the infected rats. B. abortus biotype 1 was isolated from the uteri of the infected rats. The data of this study indicate that B. abortus biotype 1 infections in SD rat model affect reproduction adversely by causing infertility, stillbirth and loss of number and weight of offspring.",M2
19557163,"The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and the small GTPase Rab 2 are crucial for Brucella replication.The intracellular pathogen <e>Brucella abortus</e> survives and replicates inside host cells within an endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-derived replicative organelle named the  Brucella-containing vacuole  (BCV). Here, we developed a subcellular fractionation method to isolate BCVs and characterize for the first time the protein composition of its replicative niche. After identification of BCV membrane proteins by 2 dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry, we focused on two eukaryotic proteins: the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and the small GTPase Rab 2 recruited to the vacuolar membrane of Brucella. These proteins were previously described to localize on vesicular and tubular clusters (VTC) and to regulate the VTC membrane traffic between the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and the Golgi. Inhibition of either GAPDH or Rab 2 expression by small interfering RNA strongly inhibited B. abortus replication. Consistent with this result, inhibition of other partners of GAPDH and Rab 2, such as COPI and PKC iota, reduced B. abortus replication. Furthermore, blockage of Rab 2 GTPase in a GDP-locked form also inhibited B. abortus replication. Bacteria did not fuse with the ER and instead remained in lysosomal-associated membrane vacuoles. These results reveal an essential role for GAPDH and the small GTPase Rab 2 in B. abortus virulence within host cells.",M2

19529776,"The differential interaction of Brucella and ochrobactrum with innate immunity reveals traits related to the evolution of stealthy pathogens.BACKGROUND: During evolution, innate immunity has been tuned to recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns. However, some alpha-Proteobacteria are stealthy intracellular pathogens not readily detected by this system. Brucella members follow this strategy and are highly virulent, but other Brucellaceae like Ochrobactrum are rhizosphere inhabitants and only opportunistic pathogens. To gain insight into the emergence of the stealthy strategy, we compared these two phylogenetically close but biologically divergent bacteria. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In contrast to <e>Brucella abortus</e>, Ochrobactrum anthropi did not replicate within professional and non-professional phagocytes and, whereas neutrophils had a limited action on B. abortus, they were essential to control O. anthropi infections. O. anthropi triggered proinflammatory responses markedly lower than Salmonella enterica but higher than B. abortus. In macrophages and dendritic cells, the corresponding lipopolysaccharides reproduced these grades of activation, and binding of O. anthropi lipopolysaccharide to the TLR4 co-receptor MD-2 and NF-kappaB induction laid between those of B. abortus and enteric bacteria lipopolysaccharides. These differences correlate with reported variations in lipopolysaccharide core sugars, sensitivity to bactericidal peptides and outer membrane permeability. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The results suggest that Brucellaceae ancestors carried molecules not readily recognized by innate immunity, so that non-drastic variations led to the emergence of stealthy intracellular parasites. They also suggest that some critical envelope properties, like selective permeability, are profoundly altered upon modification of pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and that this represents a further adaptation to the host. It is proposed that this adaptive trend is relevant in other intracellular alpha-Proteobacteria like Bartonella, Rickettsia, Anaplasma, Ehrlichia and Wolbachia.",M2
19524659,"Construction and evaluation of an ORFeome-based Brucella whole-genome DNA microarray.The genus Brucella contains bacteria producing a zoonosis of large sanitary and economical impact. The complete nucleotide sequence of eight Brucella isolates is currently available. This information can be used for high throughput approaches to the biology of this genus such as the construction of comprehensive collections of ORF clones or ORFeomes. The ORFeome of Brucella melitensis was a first contribution to this goal. Using the Brucella ORFeome as starting material we have amplified each ORF and printed them in duplicate onto coated glass slides along with the appropriate positive and negative controls. Quality control of the microarray was performed by image analysis after ethidium bromide staining. This Brucella DNA microarray was used to determine the global transcriptional profile of <e>Brucella abortus</e> grown under laboratory conditions. Two sets of genes representing strongly and poorly expressed genes have been defined. The occurrence of several genes of the same operon in the same data set has been taken as additional proof of the significance of the results. The two sets have been validated by RT-PCR of retrotranscribed RNA. Among the more abundant transcripts we found ribosomal proteins, Krebs cycle and oxidative phosphorylation enzymes. virB, flagellar components and other genes related with virulence and intracellular growth were in the poorly transcribed set. This report demonstrated the usefulness of the ORFeome for the construction of a PCR product microarray for the analysis of global gene expression in Brucella and also applicable to other microorganisms. The results provided here represent a comprehensive description of the global transcriptional profile of B. abortus grown under laboratory conditions and, at the same time, validate the use of this Brucella microarray for the study of the biology and pathogenesis of Brucella through the analysis of gene expression under any experimental conditions.",M2

Coxiella burnetii seroprevalence was high (4.6%, 95% CI 2.8-7.1) despite the rare apparent exposure of this urban population. Only two patients exhibited anti-B. abortus antibodies.

19487482,"The manganese transporter MntH is a critical virulence determinant for <e>Brucella abortus</e> 2308 in experimentally infected mice.The gene designated BAB1_1460 in the Brucella abortus 2308 genome sequence is predicted to encode the manganese transporter MntH. Phenotypic analysis of an isogenic mntH mutant indicates that MntH is the sole high-affinity manganese transporter in this bacterium but that MntH does not play a detectable role in the transport of Fe(2+), Zn(2+), Co(2+), or Ni(2+). Consistent with the apparent selectivity of the corresponding gene product, the expression of the mntH gene in B. abortus 2308 is repressed by Mn(2+), but not Fe(2+), and this Mn-responsive expression is mediated by a Mur-like repressor. The B. abortus mntH mutant MWV15 exhibits increased susceptibility to oxidative killing in vitro compared to strain 2308, and a comparative analysis of the superoxide dismutase activities present in these two strains indicates that the parental strain requires MntH in order to make wild-type levels of its manganese superoxide dismutase SodA. The B. abortus mntH mutant also exhibits extreme attenuation in both cultured murine macrophages and experimentally infected C57BL/6 mice. These experimental findings indicate that Mn(2+) transport mediated by MntH plays an important role in the physiology of B. abortus 2308, particularly during its intracellular survival and replication in the host.",M2
19469804,"Modulation of antigen-induced chronic fatigue in mouse model of water immersion stress by naringin, a polyphenolic antioxidant.It is believed that physical stress, infection and oxidative stress are involved in the development of chronic fatigue syndrome. There is little evidence stating the beneficial role of nutritional supplements in chronic fatigue syndrome. Based on this, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of naringin, a natural polyphenol, in a mouse model of immunologically-induced fatigue, wherein purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) as well as <e>Brucella abortus</e> (BA) antigen was used as immunogens. The assessment of chronic fatigue syndrome was based on chronic water-immersion stress test for 10 mins as well as measurement of hyperalgesia for 19 days. Immobility time and tail withdrawal latency as well as oxidative stress were taken as the markers of fatigue. Mice challenged with LPS or BA for 19 days showed significant increase in the immobility time, hyperalgesia and oxidative stress on 19th day. Serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels markedly increased with LPS or BA challenge. Concurrent treatment with naringin resulted in the significant decrease in the immobility time as well as hyperalgesia. There was significant attenuation of oxidative stress as well as in TNF-alpha levels. Present findings strongly suggest the role of oxidative stress and immunological activation in the pathophysiology of chronic fatigue syndrome, and treatment with naringin can be a valuable option in chronic fatigue syndrome.",M2

Field strains of Brucella abortus and Brucella canis were isolated from 9 provinces in the Republic of Korea during the years 1996-2006 and each of the isolates was classified by eight loci of HOOF-Prints. On the basis of the alleles, the 33 B. abortus and 21 B. canis field strains were divided into 22 and 18 distinct genotypes, respectively. Phylogenetic cluster analysis of Brucella isolates could be discriminated with geographical region in the Republic of Korea. Simpson's diversity index values of B. abortus and B. canis isolates ranged from 0 to 0.85. The stability of each locus was determined with in vivo and in vitro experiments. After twenty passages in blood agar, the VNTR numbers of loci 1 and 7 in B. abortus isolates and loci 5, 7, and 8 in B. canis isolates changed. The same change of the VNTR numbers at loci 1 and 7 was observed with B. abortus RB51 strains isolated from vaccinated cattle for the in vivo experiment. Although B. canis and B. abortus isolates were discriminated to herd levels by the HOOF-Prints, this method needs further improvement for the high variable locus.

19436993,"Differential composition of culture supernatants from wild-type <e>Brucella abortus</e> and its isogenic virB mutants.The virB genes coding type IV secretion system are necessary for the intracellular survival and replication of Brucella spp. In this study, extracellular proteins from B. abortus 2308 (wild type, WT) and its isogenic virB10 polar mutant were compared. Culture supernatants harvested in the early stationary phase were concentrated and subjected to 2D electrophoresis. Spots present in the WT strain but absent in the virB10 mutant (differential spots) were considered extracellular proteins released in a virB-related manner, and were identified by MALDI-TOF analysis and matching with Brucella genomes. Among the 11 differential proteins identified, DnaK chaperone (Hsp70), choloylglycine hydrolase (CGH) and a peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase (PPIase) were chosen for further investigation because of their homology with extracellular and/or virulence factors from other bacteria. The three proteins were obtained in recombinant form and specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) were prepared. By Western blot with these mAbs, the three proteins were detected in supernatants from the WT but not in those from the virB10 polar mutant or from strains carrying non-polar mutations in virB10 or virB11 genes. These results suggest that the expression of virB genes affects the extracellular release of DnaK, PPIase and CGH, and possibly other proteins from B. abortus.",M2
19397873,"Smooth Brucella strains invade and replicate in human lung  epithelial cells without inducing cell death.Inhalation is a common route for Brucella infection. We investigated whether Brucella species can invade and replicate within alveolar(A549) and bronchial (Calu-6 and 16HBE14o-) human epithelial cells. The number of adherent and intracellular bacteria was higher for rough strains (Brucella canis and <e>Brucella abortus</e> RB51) than for smooth strains (B. abortus 2308 and Brucella suis 1330). Only smooth strains exhibited efficient intracellular replication (1.5-3.5 log increase at 24 h p.i.). A B. abortus mutant with defective expression of the type IV secretion system did not replicate. B. abortus internalization was inhibited by specific inhibitors of microfilaments, microtubules and PI3-kinase activity. As assessed with fluorescent probes, B. abortus infection did not affect the viability of A549 and 16HBE14o- cells, but increased the percentage of injured cells (both strains) and dead cells (RB51) in Calu-6 cultures. LDH levels were increased in supernatants of Calu-6 and 16HBE14o- cells infected with B. abortus RB51, and to a lower extent in Calu-6 infected with B. abortus 2308. No apoptosis was detected by TUNEL upon infection with smooth or rough B. abortus.

19376263,"<e>Brucella abortus</e> activates human neutrophils.Human brucellosis is caused by infection with certain species of the genus Brucella and is characterized by bacterial persistence and inflammation of many host tissues. Neutrophils are one of the predominant cell types present in the infiltrate of these inflamed tissues, and due to their potential effect on the inflammatory response and tissue damage, direct activation of neutrophils by Brucella abortus might contribute to the pathology associated with human brucellosis. B. abortus expresses outer membrane lipoproteins (Omp) with inflammatory properties on a variety of cell types. This study examines the effect of B. abortus and its lipoproteins on neutrophil functions. B. abortus induced an increment in CD35 and CD11b expression and a decline in CD62L accompanied by IL-8 secretion, a response compatible with neutrophil activation. B. abortus lipoprotein Omp19 (L-Omp19), but not its unlipidated form, mimicked the changes associated with neutrophil activation induced by B. abortus. L-Omp19 primed neutrophils for oxidative burst as well as promoted neutrophil migration and prolonged neutrophil survival. Thus, Brucella lipoproteins possess pro-inflammatory properties that could contribute to the localize tissue injury and inflammation by direct activation of neutrophils. Data presented here, together with our previous results implicate Brucella lipoproteins in the pathogenesis of human brucellosis.",M2
19364836,"Natural antibody contributes to host defense against an attenuated <e>Brucella abortus</e> virB mutant.Brucella abortus is an intracellular pathogen that persists within phagocytic cells of the reticuloendothelial system. To identify in vivo interactions between B. abortus and the host that lead to persistent infection, we studied the persistence of B. abortus and an isogenic virB mutant deficient in the VirB type IV secretion system (T4SS) in knockout mice. In contrast to control mice, mice lacking B cells (Igh6(-/-)) were permissive for infection with the attenuated virB mutant. To determine the basis for this phenotype, we characterized immune functions of Igh6(-/-) mice in the context of B. abortus infection. Igh6(-/-) mice had greater numbers of extracellular bacteria in the spleen and increased early expression of proinflammatory cytokines during B. abortus infection. Further, a virB mutant, despite its wild-type level of survival, failed to elicit microgranuloma formation in the spleens of Igh6(-/-) mice, suggesting a requirement for the T4SS to elicit this pathological change. Passive transfer of immunoglobulin G from naïve mice restored the ability of Igh6(-/-) mice to control the persistence of the virB mutant by a complement-independent mechanism. Further, adoptive transfer of CD11b(+) cells from C57BL/6 mice to Igh6(-/-) mice restored the ability of the knockout mice to limit the replication of the virB mutant in the spleen, suggesting that the Igh6(-)(/)(-) mutation affects phagocyte function and that phagocyte function can be restored by natural antibody.",M2

Thirty Brucella-free female buffaloes were used in this study: ten 4-5 years old were inoculated with the triple of the recommended calfhood dose of SRB51 by subcutaneous route, ten 2-3 years old at the first lactation were previously vaccinated twice as calves with triple the recommended calf dose of RB51, while five 4-5 years old and five 2-3 years old not vaccinated Brucella-free female buffaloes served as controls. Milk samples were taken aseptically on a daily basis for the first 30 days and weekly for the second and third months. The samples were inoculated on selective media for isolation of SRB51 and incubated for 11 days. Moreover, PCR analysis was also performed directly on milk samples. SRB51 was isolated from milk samples only during the first week post-vaccination while RB51 DNA was detected during the first week till the fourth week post-vaccination only in water buffaloes vaccinated as adults. The identification of Brucella RB51 in milk samples, strongly suggests that this Brucella vaccine could be excreted in milk of buffalo cows vaccinated as adults, while our data demonstrate that the vaccine is safe for use in buffaloes vaccinated as calves in which it was not excreted in milk.",M2

OBJECTIVE: This study was aimed to evaluate the protection of recombinant Human Serum Albumin (HAS)-L7/L12 fusion protein in Balb/c mice. METHODS: The amplified L7/L12 gene was cloned in pYHSA5 vector, pYHSA5-L7/L12 construct was transformed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and the expressed protein from supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography. Balb/c mice were immunized in five groups by tHSA-L7/L12 fusion protein (group 1), Brucella abortus S19 (group 2), HSA (group 3), recombinant L7/L12 (group 4), PBS (group 5). ELISA to detect antibody production, LTT test to assess antigen specific lymphocyte response were conducted prior to virulent B. abortus strain 544 challenge two weeks after the last injection. Bacterial counts from spleens of immunized mice were done four weeks after challenge. RESULTS: In ELISA tests, the specific antibodies exhibited a dominance of immunoglobulin IgG1 over IgG2a. In addition, the tHSA-L7/L12 fusion protein and L7/L12 elicited a strong T-cell proliferative response upon restimulation in vitro with recombinant tHSA-L7/L12 and L7/L12, suggesting the induction of a cellular immunity response in vivo. However, there was no significant difference in proliferative response of L7/L12 and tHSA-L7/L12 fusion protein (p&gt;0.05). The L7/L12 and tHSA-L7/L12 fusion protein vaccines could also induce significant protection against challenge with the virulent strain B. abortus 544 in Balb/c mice (p&lt; or =0.05). CONCLUSION: The tHSA-L7/L12 fusion protein, similar to L7/L12 has the ability to induce antigen specific lymphocyte proliferation, stimulate humoral immunity and engender protection.",M2

In the present study, sRB51, B. abortus strain 19 (s19), and virulent B. abortus strain 9941 (s9941) were administered orally to Richardson's ground squirrels to further characterize B. abortus infection in this species. Six groups of nongravid ground squirrels were orally inoculated with 6 x 10(8) colony forming units (cfu) sRB51 (n = 10), 2.5 x 10(4) cfu s19 (n = 10), 2.5 x 10(7) cfu s19 (n = 6), 1.3 x 10(6) cfu s9941 (n = 5), 2.1 x 10(8) cfu s9941 (n = 5), or vaccine diluent (control; n = 4). One of five animals in the lower-dose s19 group and two of three animals in the higher-dose s19 group showed persistence of bacteria in various tissues at 14 wk postinoculation (PI).

The occurrence of the infection in humans is largely dependent on the prevalence of brucellosis in animal reservoirs, including wildlife. The current vaccine used for cattle <e>Brucella abortus</e> strain RB51, has proven ineffective in protecting bison (Bison bison) and elk (Cervus nelsoni) from infection and abortion. To test possible improvements in vaccine efficacy, a novel approach of immunization was examined from April 2004 to November 2006 using alginate composite microspheres containing a nonimmunogenic, eggshell-precursor protein of the parasite Fasciola hepatica (Vitelline protein B, VpB) to deliver live vaccine strain RB51. Red deer (Cervus elaphus), used as a model for elk, were vaccinated orally (PO) or subcutaneously (SC) with 1.5x10(10) viable organisms per animal. Humoral responses postvaccination (immunoglobulin G [IgG] levels), assessed at different time points, indicated that capsules containing live RB51 elicited an anti-Brucella specific IgG response. Furthermore, the encapsulated vaccine elicited a cell-mediated response that the nonencapsulated vaccinates failed to produce. Finally, red deer were challenged with B. abortus strain 19 by conjunctival exposure. Only animals that received encapsulated RB51 vaccine by either route exhibited a significant reduction in bacterial counts in their spleens. These data suggest that alginate-VpB microspheres provide a method to enhance the RB51 vaccine performance in elk.",M2
19176693,"Immune responses and protection against experimental challenge after vaccination of bison with <e>Brucella abortus</e> strain RB51 or RB51 overexpressing superoxide dismutase and glycosyltransferase genes.Vaccination is a tool that could be beneficial in managing the high prevalence of brucellosis in free-ranging bison in Yellowstone National Park. In this study, we characterized immunologic responses and protection against experimental challenge after vaccination of bison with Brucella abortus strain RB51 (RB51) or a recombinant RB51 strain overexpressing superoxide dismutase (sodC) and glycosyltransferase (wboA) genes (RB51+sodC,wboA). Bison were vaccinated with saline only or with 4.6 x 10(10) CFU of RB51 or 7.4 x 10(10) CFU of RB51+sodC,wboA (n = eight animals/treatment). Bison vaccinated with RB51 or RB51+sodC,wboA had greater (P &lt; 0.05) antibody responses, proliferative responses, and production of gamma interferon to RB51 after vaccination than did nonvaccinates. However, bison vaccinated with RB51+sodC,wboA cleared the vaccine strain from draining lymph nodes faster than bison vaccinated with the parental RB51 strain. Immunologic responses of bison vaccinated with RB51+sodC,wboA were similar to responses of bison vaccinated with RB51. Pregnant bison were intraconjunctivally challenged in midgestation with 10(7) CFU of B. abortus strain 2308. Bison vaccinated with RB51, but not RB51+sodC,wboA vaccinates, had greater protection from abortion, fetal/uterine, mammary, or maternal infection than nonvaccinates. Our data suggest that the RB51+sodC,wboA strain is less efficacious as a calfhood vaccine for bison than the parental RB51 strain. Our data also suggest that the RB51 vaccine is a currently available management tool that could be utilized to help reduce brucellosis in free-ranging bison.",M2
19167989,"Cloning, expression and immunogenicity of the translation initiation factor 3 homologue of <e>Brucella abortus</e>.The infC gene of Brucella abortus encoding the translation initiation factor 3 (IF3) was cloned, sequenced and expressed in Escherichia coli. The amino acid sequence analysis predicted a product with 74-80% identity with the IF3 proteins from Mesorhizobium loti, Sinorhizobium meliloti, Aurantimona sp. and Mesorhizobium sp. This protein also show 54% amino acid sequence identity with the E. coli IF3, sharing most of the residues which were described as responsible for the biological activity of this protein. Since we have previously reported the immunoprotective capacity of this Brucella protein, we stimulated lymphoid cells from animals immunized with purified recombinant Brucella IF3 protein  in vitro  with this antigen. The lymphocytes were able to mount a strong proliferative response with concomitant production of gamma interferon, but without the secretion of either IL-4 or antibodies. Thus, immunization with the Brucella recombinant IF3 protein promotes a TH-1 polarized response, allowing us to propose it as a promising candidate antigen for the development of subunit vaccines against Brucella.",M2
19159825,"Curcumin, a polyphenolic antioxidant, attenuates chronic fatigue syndrome in murine water immersion stress model.Chronic fatigue syndrome, infection and oxidative stress are interrelated in epidemiological case studies. However, data demonstrating scientific validation of epidemiological claims regarding effectiveness of nutritional supplements for chronic fatigue syndrome are lacking. This study is designed to evaluate the effect of natural polyphenol, curcumin, in a mouse model of immunologically induced fatigue, where purified lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and <e>Brucella abortus</e> (BA) antigens were used as immunogens. The assessment of chronic fatigue syndrome was based on chronic water-immersion stress test for 10 min daily for 19 days and the immobility time was taken as the marker of fatigue. Mice challenged with LPS or BA for 19 days showed significant increase in the immobility time and hyperalgesia on day 19, as well as marked increase in serum tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) levels. Concurrent treatment with curcumin resulted in significantly decreased immobility time as well as hyperalgesia. There was significant attenuation of oxidative stress as well as TNF-alpha levels. These findings strongly suggest that during immunological activation, there is significant increase in oxidative stress and curcumin can be a valuable option in the treatment of chronic fatigue syndrome.",M2
19150742,"Vaccination with recombinant Semliki Forest virus particles expressing translation initiation factor 3 of <e>Brucella abortus</e> induces protective immunity in BALB/c mice.Recombinant replicons of Semliki Forest virus (SFV) can be used to induce high-level, transient expression of heterologous proteins in vivo. We constructed infectious but replication-deficient SFV particles carrying recombinant RNA encoding the Brucella abortus translation initiation factor 3 (IF3). The recombinant SFV particles (SFV-IF3 particles) were then evaluated for their ability to induce immune responses and to protect BALB/c mice against a challenge with B. abortus 2308 following vaccination. Animals inoculated with SFV-IF3 developed IF3-specific IgM antibodies at day 14 post-immunization. In vitro stimulation of splenocytes from vaccinated mice with either recombinant IF3 (rIF3) or crude Brucella protein extracts resulted in a T-cell proliferative response and induction of interferon gamma secretion, but not interleukin-4. In addition, mice immunized with SFV-IF3 exhibited a significant level of resistance against challenge with the virulent B. abortus strain 2308 (P&lt;0.01). These findings indicate that an SFV-based vector carrying RNA encoding Brucella IF3 has potential for use as a vaccine to induce protection against B. abortus infections.",M2
19074375,"Functional mapping of <e>Brucella abortus</e> cyclic beta-1,2-glucan synthase: identification of the protein domain required for cyclization.Cyclic beta-1,2-glucans (CbetaG) are periplasmic homopolysaccharides that have been shown to play an important role in several symbiotic and pathogenic relationships. Cyclic beta-1,2-glucan synthase (Cgs), the enzyme responsible for the synthesis of CbetaG, is an integral membrane polyfunctional protein that catalyzes the four enzymatic activities (initiation, elongation, phosphorolysis, and cyclization) required for the synthesis of CbetaG. Recently, we have identified the glycosyltransferase and the beta-1,2-glucooligosaccharide phosphorylase domains of Brucella abortus Cgs. In this study, we performed large-scale linker-scanning mutagenesis to gain further insight into the functional domains of Cgs. This analysis allowed us to construct a functional map of the enzyme and led to the identification of the minimal region required for the catalysis of initiation and elongation reactions. In addition, we identified the Cgs region (residues 991 to 1544) as being the protein domain required for cyclization and demonstrated that upon cyclization and releasing of the CbetaG, one or more glucose residues remain attached to the protein intermediate that serves as a primer for the next round of CbetaG synthesis. Finally, our results indicate that the overall control of the degree of polymerization of CbetaG is the result of a balance between elongation, phosphorolysis, and cyclization reactions.",M2
19055850,"Heat shock cognate protein 70 contributes to Brucella invasion into trophoblast giant cells that cause infectious abortion.BACKGROUND: The cell tropism of <e>Brucella abortus</e>, a causative agent of brucellosis and facultative intracellular pathogen, in the placenta is thought to be a key event of infectious abortion, although the molecular mechanism for this is largely unknown. There is a higher degree of bacterial colonization in the placenta than in other organs and many bacteria are detected in trophoblast giant (TG) cells in the placenta. In the present study, we investigated mechanism of B. abortus invasion into TG cells. RESULTS: We observed internalization and intracellular growth of B. abortus in cultured TG cells. A monoclonal antibody that inhibits bacterial internalization was isolated and this reacted with heat shock cognate protein 70 (Hsc70). Depletion and over expression of Hsc70 in TG cells inhibited and promoted bacterial internalization, respectively. IFN-gamma receptor was expressed in TG cells and IFN-gamma treatment enhanced the uptake of bacteria by TG cells. Administering the anti-Hsc70 antibody to pregnant mice served to prevent infectious abortion. CONCLUSION: B. abortus infection of TG cells in placenta is mediated by Hsc70, and that such infection leads to infectious abortion.",M2
19047401,"The <e>Brucella abortus</e> S19 DeltavjbR live vaccine candidate is safer than S19 and confers protection against wild-type challenge in BALB/c mice when delivered in a sustained-release vehicle.Brucellosis is an important zoonotic disease of nearly worldwide distribution. Despite the availability of live vaccine strains for bovine (S19, RB51) and small ruminants (Rev-1), these vaccines have several drawbacks, including residual virulence for animals and humans. Safe and efficacious immunization systems are therefore needed to overcome these disadvantages. A vjbR knockout was generated in the S19 vaccine and investigated for its potential use as an improved vaccine candidate. Vaccination with a sustained-release vehicle to enhance vaccination efficacy was evaluated utilizing the live S19 DeltavjbR::Kan in encapsulated alginate microspheres containing a nonimmunogenic eggshell precursor protein of the parasite Fasciola hepatica (vitelline protein B). BALB/c mice were immunized intraperitoneally with either encapsulated or nonencapsulated S19 DeltavjbR::Kan at a dose of 1 x 10(5) CFU per animal to evaluate immunogenicity, safety, and protective efficacy. Humoral responses postvaccination indicate that the vaccine candidate was able to elicit an anti-Brucella-specific immunoglobulin G response even when the vaccine was administered in an encapsulated format. The safety was revealed by the absence of splenomegaly in mice that were inoculated with the mutant. Finally, a single dose with the encapsulated mutant conferred higher levels of protection compared to the nonencapsulated vaccine. These results suggest that S19 DeltavjbR::Kan is safer than S19, induces protection in mice, and should be considered as a vaccine candidate when administered in a sustained-release manner.",M2
18981242,"Immunization with recombinant Brucella species outer membrane protein Omp16 or Omp19 in adjuvant induces specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as well as systemic and oral protection against <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection.Available vaccines against Brucella spp. are live attenuated Brucella strains. In order to engineer a better vaccine to be used in animals and humans, our laboratory aims to develop an innocuous subunit vaccine. Particularly, we are interested in the outer membrane proteins (OMPs) of B. abortus: Omp16 and Omp19. In this study, we assessed the use of these proteins as vaccines against Brucella in BALB/c mice. Immunization with lipidated Omp16 (L-Omp16) or L-Omp19 in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) conferred significant protection against B. abortus infection. Vaccination with unlipidated Omp16 (U-Omp16) or U-Omp19 in IFA induced a higher degree of protection than the respective lipidated versions. Moreover, the level of protection induced after U-Omp16 or U-Omp19 immunization in IFA was similar to that elicited by live B. abortus S19 immunization. Flow cytometric analysis showed that immunization with U-Omp16 or U-Omp19 induced antigen-specific CD4(+) as well as CD8(+) T cells producing gamma interferon. In vivo depletion of CD4(+) or CD8(+) T cells in mice immunized with U-Omp16 or U-Omp19 plus IFA resulted in a loss of the elicited protection, indicating that both cell types are mediating immune protection. U-Omp16 or U-Omp19 vaccination induced a T helper 1 response, systemic protection in aluminum hydroxide formulation, and oral protection with cholera toxin adjuvant against B. abortus infection. Both immunization routes exhibited a similar degree of protection to attenuated Brucella vaccines (S19 and RB51, respectively). Overall these results indicate that U-Omp16 or U-Omp19 would be a useful candidate for a subunit vaccine against human and animal brucellosis.",M2
18931122,"Phosphatidylethanolamine synthesis is required for optimal virulence of <e>Brucella abortus</e>.The Brucella cell envelope contains the zwitterionic phospholipids phosphatidylcholine (PC) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE). Synthesis of PC occurs exclusively via the PC synthase pathway, implying that the pathogen depends on the choline synthesized by the host cell to form PC. Notably, PC is necessary to sustain a chronic infection process, which suggests that the membrane lipid content is relevant for Brucella virulence. In this study we investigated the first step of PE biosynthesis in B. abortus, which is catalyzed by phosphatidylserine synthase (PssA). Disruption of pssA abrogated the synthesis of PE without affecting the growth in rich complex medium. In minimal medium, however, the mutant required choline supplementation for growth, suggesting that at least PE or PC is necessary for Brucella viability. The absence of PE altered cell surface properties, but most importantly, it impaired several virulence traits of B. abortus, such as intracellular survival in both macrophages and HeLa cells, the maturation of the replicative Brucella-containing vacuole, and mouse colonization. These results suggest that membrane phospholipid composition is critical for the interaction of B. abortus with the host cell.",M2
18926896,"Characterization of <e>Brucella abortus</e> sigma factor sigma54 (rpoN): genetic complementation of Sinorhizobium meliloti ntrA mutant.The intracellular pathogen Brucella abortus has an alternative sigma factor sigma54 (RpoN) highly similar to Sinorhizobium meliloti NtrA. RpoN was described to be required for the transcription of a wide range of genes involved in diverse physiological functions including the regulation of virulence-related factors in both plants and animal pathogens. B. abortus rpoN gene restored the normal growth of an S. meliloti ntrA mutant in minimal media with succinic acid as a sole carbon source as well as the formation of functional nodules in alfalfa, thus revealing that the gene is functional. B. abortus rpoN mutant and B. abortus wild-type strain harboring a multicopy plasmid coding for a wild-type rpoN gene displayed reduced survival under stationary-phase conditions suggesting that expression of RpoN must be tightly regulated. Real-time PCR analysis revealed that B. abortus rpoN expression is downregulated during the stationary phase of growth. This regulation is absent in the rpoN mutant background, indicating that RpoN regulates its own expression. Intracellular multiplication in HeLa or J774 cells, and survival in BALB/c mice of the rpoN mutant, are not affected. However 2weeks postinfection survival of rpoN mutant complemented with a multicopy plasmid containing a wild-type rpoN gene is reduced, thus suggesting that overexpression of rpoN may misregulate the expression of genes involved in this stage of infection.",M2
18843213,"[Brucellosis outbreak in Treviso province caused by infected cheese from an endemic area]Brucellosis is one of the most common zoonoses in the world. Its distribution has changed in recent years due to socioeconomic factors and international travel. In Italy its trend has followed the international pattern, albeit with major differences between the north and south of the country. In northern Italy brucellosis is import-related and rarely laboratory acquired. We describe an outbreak of five cases of brucella infection occurred in Treviso province during August 2005. All the patients had a positive Wright test and two of them had a positive blood culture for <e>Brucella abortus</e>. The source of infection was cheese from an area of Italy where brucellosis is endemic. All the people who consumed the cheese had clinical and laboratory signs of brucellosis. All of them received six weeks of rifampin and doxycycline treatment; none developed any complication or relapse during the two follow-up years. In conclusion, brucellosis should be considered as a differential diagnosis of fever of unknown origin even in countries where it is not endemic; it is necessary not only to rule out travels to endemic regions through clinical history, but also the consumption of infected foods imported from such areas.",M2

18817188,"Comparison of heat shock response in <e>Brucella abortus</e> and Brucella melitensis.Heat shock protein (hsp) is highly conserved, that serves a wide range of function in protein folding and transport. It protect from various type of stress including heat shocks. However, it is well known that the virulence of B. melitensis is more than B. abortus, but there is not any strong evidence to verify it. For this purpose, in refer to potent antigenicity of hsps in various infectious as well as some hsp molecules act as potent activator of macrophage (danger signal), we hypothesized that difference in virulence between B. abortus and B. melitensis may be originated from difference in pattern of response to heat shock induced by high degree of fever that usually present in brucellosis. To this end, five B. abortus and five B. melitensis strains isolated from cows and human, were subjected to 39, 40 and 42 degrees C heat shocks. The bacterial whole cell proteins were extracted and resolved by SDS-PAGE. Western blotting was used to detect antibody production against the extracted bacterial proteins especially hsp60 in both control and patient sera. SDS-PAGE gels revealed protein bands mainly in the range of 10-100 kDa. The amounts of a 60 kDa protein band (hsp60) was significantly enhanced following heat shock at 42 degrees C in relation to the unheated cells in both bacterial species. The heat shock responses in B. abortus and B. melitensis point to the higher production of a 60 kDa protein (hsp60) in both bacterial species, especially in B. abortus. It seems that, lower hsp60 production by B. melitensis would induce a relatively much lower immune response against the bacterium leading to its greater virulence potentials; the sera from Brucellosis patients reacted with several of these cell derived protein bands in western blots, none of which were reactive with sera from healthy individuals. The western blot protein bands showed striking differences. This observation points to the immunogenic properties of hsps, specially the overwhelming response to hsp-60. Therefore, hsp-60 can be a good antigenic candidate for engineering subunit vaccine against Brucella, as well as for ELISA test development.",M2

During the year 2004, serum samples were collected from volunteers in various occupations and screened for brucella antibodies using Rose Bengal Plate Agglutination Test. Information on occupation, kind of work and contacts with livestock was collected and age and sex were recorded. The overall sero prevalence of antibodies to <e>Brucella abortus</e> was 5.52%. One variable in a multivariate regression model was significantly associated with seropositivity to B. abortus: abattoir workers. The prevalence of antibody was significantly higher (P &lt; 0.05) among personnel employed in high-risk jobs such as cutting animal throats and cleaning slaughtered animals parts. None of the other factors investigated was associated with seropositivity to B. abortus.

18761420,"Brucella lipoproteins mimic dendritic cell maturation induced by <e>Brucella abortus</e>.Infection with Brucella abortus induces a pro-inflammatory response that drives T cell responses toward a Th1 profile. The mechanism by which this bacterium triggers this response is unknown. Dendritic cells (DC) are crucial mediators at the host-pathogen interface and are potent Th1-inducing antigen-presenting cells. Thus, we examined the mechanism whereby B. abortus stimulate human DC maturation. B. abortus-infected DC increased the expression of CD86, CD80, CCR7, CD83, MHCII, MHCI and CD40 and induced the production of TNF-alpha, IL-6, IL-10 and IL-12. Both phenomena were not dependent on bacterial viability since they were also induced by heat-killed B. abortus (HKBA). B. abortus LPS was unable to induce markers up-regulation or cytokine production. We next investigated the capacity of the outer membrane protein 19 (Omp19) as a B. abortus lipoprotein model to induce DC maturation. Lipidated Omp19 (L-Omp19), but not its unlipidated form, increased the expression of cell surface markers and the secretion of cytokines. L-Omp19-matured DC also have decreased endocytic activity and displayed enhanced T cell stimulatory activity in a MLR. Pre-incubation of DC with anti-TLR2 mAb blocked L-Omp19-mediated cytokine production. These results demonstrate that B. abortus lipoproteins can stimulate DC maturation providing a mechanism by which these bacteria generate a Th1-type immune response.",M2
18754596,"Tailored magnetic nanoparticles for direct and sensitive detection of biomolecules in biological samples.We developed nanoparticles with tailored magnetic properties for direct and sensitive detection of biomolecules in biological samples in a single step. Thermally blocked nanoparticles obtained by thermal hydrolysis, functionalized with specific ligands, are mixed with sample solutions, and the variation of the magnetic relaxation due to surface binding is used to detect the presence of biomolecules. The binding significantly increases the hydrodynamic volume of nanoparticles, thus changing their Brownian relaxation frequency which is measured by a specifically developed AC susceptometer. The system was tested for the presence of Brucella antibodies, a dangerous pathogen causing brucellosis with severe effects both on humans and animals, in serum samples from infected cows and the surface of the nanoparticles was functionalized with lipopolysaccharides (LPS) from <e>Brucella abortus</e>. The hydrodynamic volume of LPS-functionalized particles increased by 25-35% as a result of the binding of the antibodies, measured by changes in the susceptibility in an alternating magnetic field. The method has shown high sensitivity, with detection limit of 0.05 microg x mL(-1) of antibody in the biological samples without any pretreatment. This magnetic-based assay is very sensitive, cost-efficient, and versatile, giving a direct indication whether the animal is infected or not, making it suitable for point-of-care applications. The functionalization of tailored magnetic nanoparticles can be modified to suit numerous homogeneous assays for a wide range of applications.",M2

18685239,"Regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) contributes to abortion caused by <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection in pregnant mice.Brucella abortus (B. abortus) is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can survive inside macrophages and trophoblast giant cells, and the causative agent of brucellosis. In the present study, we found that production of regulated upon activation normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES) due to B. abortus infection contributes to abortion in pregnant mice. B. abortus infected pregnant interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) knockout mice died within 15 days of infection, but non-pregnant IFN-gamma knockout mice were still alive. With infection by wild type B. abortus, a large amount of RANTES production was observed in pregnant IFN-gamma knockout mice, and induction of RANTES was also observed in normal pregnant mice infected with the wild type, but not in those infected with the intracellular replication-defective mutant. Production of RANTES and IFN-gamma were inhibited in mice inoculated with the respective RANTES or IFN-gamma antibody. Neutralization of RANTES, induced by B. abortus infection, served to prevent abortion. These results indicate that the production and function of RANTES are correlated with IFN-gamma in pregnant mice infected with B. abortus.",M2
18664388,"The role of innate immune receptors in the control of <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection: toll-like receptors and beyond.Research into intracellular sensing of microbial products is an up and coming field in innate immunity. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize Brucella spp. and bacterial components and initiate mononuclear phagocyte responses that influence both innate and adaptive immunity. Recent studies have revealed the intracellular signaling cascades involved in the TLR-initiated immune response to Brucella infection. TLR2, TLR4 and TLR9 have been implicated in host interactions with Brucella; however, TLR9 has the most prominent role. Further, the relationship between specific Brucella molecules and various signal transduction pathways needs to be better understood. MyD88-dependent and TRIF-independent signaling pathways are involved in Brucella activation of innate immune cells through TLRs. We have recently reported the critical role of MyD88 molecule in dendritic cell maturation and interleukin-12 production during B. abortus infection. This article discusses recent studies on TLR signaling and also highlights the contribution of NOD and type I IFN receptors during Brucella infection. The better understanding of the role by such innate immune receptors in bacterial infection is critical in host-pathogen interactions.",M2

For antibody research, 645 serum samples were analyzed by the complement fixation test (CF). A 4.0% frequency was found (26/645) in patients' serum and among those 4.1% (23/551) were slaughterhouses employees and 8.1% (3/37) rural workers. Of the total positive samples, three (2.0%) were women and 23 (4.7%) men; ten (2.9%) were between the ages of 18 and 30, six (3.4%) between 31 and 40, and nine (8.0%) were above 41 years of age. Risk factors for brucellosis in the study groups were age, background (OR = 2.45; CI 95% = 0.98 to 6.10) and previous work conducted with production animals (OR 2.36; CI 95% = 0.95 to 6.02).

18616282,"<e>Brucella abortus</e> MFP: a trimeric coiled-coil protein with membrane fusogenic activity.The bacterial genus Brucella consists of a group of facultative intracellular pathogens which produces abortion and infertility in animals and a chronic debilitating febrile illness in humans. BMFP is a basic protein of Brucella abortus that belongs to a highly conserved group of homologue proteins of unknown structure and function in proteobacteria (COG2960). In this study, we report the structural and biochemical characterization of this protein. We found that BMFP has two structural domains: a carboxyl-terminal coiled-coil domain through which the protein self-associates as a trimer and a natively disordered amino-terminal domain which has propensity to adopt an amphipathic alpha-helical structure. This natively unfolded domain undergoes a structural rearrangement from unfolded to alpha-helix in the presence of high ionic strength, acidic pH, detergents, and phospholipid vesicles. Moreover, we demonstrated that the interaction of BMFP with phospholipid vesicles promotes in vitro membrane fusion. These results contribute to the elucidation of the structural and functional properties of this protein and its homologues present in most proteobacteria.",M2
18602490,"Escheriosomes entrapped DNA vaccine co-expressing Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase and IL-18 confers protection against <e>Brucella abortus</e>.In the present study, we evaluated prophylactic prospective of liposome based DNA vaccine co-expressing Cu-Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD) along with interleukin-18 (IL-18) against experimental murine brucellosis. The immunization schedule involves liposome-mediated delivery of pVsod (encoding SOD of Brucella abortus) and pVIL18-sod (encoding IL-18 of mouse and SOD of B. abortus) DNA constructs. The data highlight potential of Escherichia coli lipid liposome (escheriosome) based DNA delivery vehicle to induce SOD specific humoral and cellular immune responses in the immunized mice. The co-expression of SOD along with IL-18 ensued in higher lymphoproliferative response and IFN-gamma production in comparison to the group of animals that were immunized with free form of SOD-DNA. Antibody response developed upon immunization with both DNA vaccines was of IgG2a type mainly. The results of the present study show that co-expression of IL-18 along with SOD polarized the antigen specific immune responses toward Th-1 direction, a desirable feature to control intracellular pathogens.",M2
18599128,"Evaluation of a fluorescence polarization assay for the detection of serum antibodies to <e>Brucella abortus</e> in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis).The fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) was evaluated for the serological diagnosis of brucellosis in water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) in southern Italy. This assay uses O-polysaccharide prepared from Brucella abortus lipopolysaccharide conjugated with fluorescein isothiocyanate as a tracer. It has many methodological advantages over older, more established tests and can be performed in a fraction of the time. Sera from 890 buffalos from the Campania Region - 526 positive sera and 364 negative sera according to the complement fixation test (CFT) - were evaluated in this study. All samples were tested with the Rose Bengal test (RBT), CFT, and FPA in parallel and in blind fashion. Sensitivities (Sn) were 84.5% and 92.6%, and specificities (Sp) were 93.1% and 91.2% for RBT and FPA, respectively, relative to CFT. Finally, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis suggested a cut-off value of 117 millipolarization (mP) units. On the whole, these results suggested that FPA might replace RBT in the diagnosis of buffalo brucellosis for its better performance relative to CFT, its adjustable cut-off useful in different epidemiological situations, its reliability, ease of performance, and for its potential application in field and high-throughput laboratories.",M2

The quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of the gyrA and parC genes of the two reference strains were analysed by polymerase chain reaction sequencing analysis to obtain the wild-type sequence. These sequences were then compared with the corresponding sequences of four in vitro-selected fluoroquinolone-resistant mutants to characterise mutations associated with resistance. Sequencing of the ofloxacin-selected resistant mutant 2308 revealed a transition of GAT to AAT (corresponding to position 87 of Escherichia coli gyrA), leading to substitution of Asp91--&gt;Asn, whilst at the same position the ciprofloxacin-selected resistant mutant 2308 revealed a transition of GAT to TAT (corresponding to the same position of E. coli as above), leading to substitution of Asp91--&gt;Tyr. The ofloxacin-selected resistant mutant 3196 had a transition of GCT to GTT, generating an amino acid change of Ala87--&gt;Val. Amino acid changes were detected in the portion of the Brucella gyrA gene (Ala71 to Gln110) corresponding to the E. coli gyrA QRDR region (Ala67 to Gln110). Amino acid changes were also detected in Ser83, corresponding to the region where fluoroquinolone-associated amino acid changes are most commonly found in other bacterial species.",M2
18501554,"Expression of heme oxygenase-1 is associated with abortion caused by <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection in pregnant mice.Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular pathogen that can survive inside macrophages and trophoblast giant (TG) cells, and the causative agent of brucellosis. In the present study, we found that expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in TG cells is correlated with abortion induced by B. abortus infection in pregnant mice. Expression of HO-1 in the placenta was decreased by B. abortus infection and treatment with cobalt-protoporphyrin (Co-PP), which is known to up-regulate HO-1 expression, inhibited abortion due to the bacterial infection. In TG cells, treatment with Co-PP was shown to up-regulate HO-1, whereas its expression was decreased by B. abortus infection. Such down-regulation of HO-1 in the TG cells was enhanced by IFN-gamma treatment. HO-1 down-regulation in TG cells due to knockdown or IFN-gamma treatment served to induce cell death caused by B. abortus infection. These results suggest that down-regulation of HO-1 in TG cells due to B. abortus infection is an important event in infectious abortion.",M2
18478107,"Genome sequence of <e>Brucella abortus</e> vaccine strain S19 compared to virulent strains yields candidate virulence genes.The Brucella abortus strain S19, a spontaneously attenuated strain, has been used as a vaccine strain in vaccination of cattle against brucellosis for six decades. Despite many studies, the physiological and molecular mechanisms causing the attenuation are not known. We have applied pyrosequencing technology together with conventional sequencing to rapidly and comprehensively determine the complete genome sequence of the attenuated Brucella abortus vaccine strain S19. The main goal of this study is to identify candidate virulence genes by systematic comparative analysis of the attenuated strain with the published genome sequences of two virulent and closely related strains of B. abortus, 9-941 and 2308. The two S19 chromosomes are 2,122,487 and 1,161,449 bp in length. A total of 3062 genes were identified and annotated. Pairwise and reciprocal genome comparisons resulted in a total of 263 genes that were non-identical between the S19 genome and any of the two virulent strains. Amongst these, 45 genes were consistently different between the attenuated strain and the two virulent strains but were identical amongst the virulent strains, which included only two of the 236 genes that have been implicated as virulence factors in literature. The functional analyses of the differences have revealed a total of 24 genes that may be associated with the loss of virulence in S19. Of particular relevance are four genes with more than 60 bp consistent difference in S19 compared to both the virulent strains, which, in the virulent strains, encode an outer membrane protein and three proteins involved in erythritol uptake or metabolism.",M2
18469100,"VirB3 to VirB6 and VirB8 to VirB11, but not VirB7, are essential for mediating persistence of Brucella in the reticuloendothelial system.The <e>Brucella abortus</e> virB locus contains 12 open reading frames, termed virB1 through virB12, which encode a type IV secretion system. Polar mutations in the virB locus markedly reduce the ability of B. abortus to survive in cultured macrophages or to persist in organs of mice. While a nonpolar deletion of the virB2 gene reduces survival in cultured macrophages and in organs of mice, a nonpolar deletion of virB1 only reduces survival in macrophages, whereas virB12 is dispensable for either virulence trait. Here we investigated the role of the remaining genes in the virB locus during survival in macrophages and virulence in mice. Mutants carrying nonpolar deletions of the virB3, virB4, virB5, virB6, virB7, virB8, virB9, virB10, or virB11 gene were constructed and characterized. All mutations reduced the ability of B. abortus to survive in J774A.1 mouse macrophage-like cells to a degree similar to that caused by a deletion of the entire virB locus. Deletion of virB3, virB4, virB5, virB6, virB8, virB9, virB10, or virB11 markedly reduced the ability of B. abortus to persist in the spleens of mice at 8 weeks after infection. Interestingly, deletion of virB7 did not reduce the ability of B. abortus to persist in spleens of mice. We conclude that virB2, virB3, virB4, virB5, virB6, virB8, virB9, virB10, and virB11 are essential for virulence of B. abortus in mice, while functions encoded by the virB1, virB7, and virB12 genes are not required for persistence in organs with this animal model.",M2
18462974,"Expression of Babesia bovis rhoptry-associated protein 1 (RAP1) in <e>Brucella abortus</e> S19.Brucella abortus strain 19 (live vaccine) induces a strong humoral and cellular immune response and therefore, it is an attractive vector for the delivery of heterologous antigens. The objective of the present study was to express the rhoptry-associated protein (RAP1) of Babesia bovis in B. abortus S19, as a model for heterologous expression of immunostimulatory antigens from veterinary pathogens. A plasmid for the expression of recombinant proteins fused to the aminoterminal of the outer membrane lipoprotein OMP19 was created, pursuing the objective of increasing the immunogenicity of the recombinant antigen being expressed by its association to a lipid moiety. Recombinant strains of B. abortus S19 expressing RAP1 as a fusion protein either with the first amino acids of beta-galactosidase (S19pBB-RAP1) or B. abortus OMP19 (S19pBB19-RAP1) were generated. Plasmid stability and the immunogenicity of the heterologous proteins were analyzed. Mice immunized with S19pBB-RAP1 or S19pBB19-RAP1 developed specific humoral immune response to RAP1, IgG2a being the predominant antibody isotype. Furthermore, a specific cellular immune response to recombinant RAP1 was elicited in vitro by lymphocytes from mice immunized with both strains. Therefore, we concluded that B. abortus S19 expressing RAP1 is immunostimulatory and may provide the basis for combined heterologous vaccines for babesiosis and brucellosis.",M2
18458071,"Inactivation of the type IV secretion system reduces the Th1 polarization of the immune response to <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection.The Brucella abortus type IV secretion system (T4SS), encoded by the virB operon, is essential for establishing persistent infection in the murine reticuloendothelial system. To gain insight into the in vivo interactions mediated by the T4SS, we compared host responses elicited by B. abortus with those of an isogenic mutant in the virB operon. Mice infected with the B. abortus virB mutant elicited smaller increases in serum levels of immunoglobulin G2a, gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), and interleukin-12p40 than did mice infected with wild-type B. abortus. Despite equal bacterial loads in the spleen, at 3 to 4 days postinfection, levels of IFN-gamma were higher in mice infected with wild-type B. abortus than in mice infected with the virB mutant, as shown by real-time PCR, intracellular cytokine staining, and cytokine levels. IFN-gamma-producing CD4(+) T cells were more abundant in spleens of mice infected with wild-type B. abortus than in virB mutant-infected mice. Similar numbers of IFN-gamma-secreting CD8(+) T cells were observed in the spleens of mice infected with B. abortus 2308 or a virB mutant. These results suggest that early differences in cytokine responses contribute to a stronger Th1 polarization of the immune response in mice infected with wild-type B. abortus than in mice infected with the virB mutant.",M2
18457975,"Evidence of <e>Brucella abortus</e> OPS dictating uptake and restricting NF-kappaB activation in murine macrophages.Smooth Brucella abortus S2308 is virulent while rough derivatives are attenuated. Intracellular killing is often blamed for these differences. In the studies described, uptake kinetics and interaction of S2308 and S2308 manBA::Tn5 (CA180) rough mutants with macrophages were investigated. The results revealed that smooth B. abortus was rapidly internalized, achieving a maximum level in less than 5 min without additional uptake over the next 30 min. In contrast, continued uptake of the rough mutant was observed and only achieves a maximum level after 30 min. The results were confirmed by the differences in F-actin polymerization, lipid raft staining, early endosome colocalization and electron microscopic observations after smooth and rough Brucella infection. We also demonstrated for the first time that uptake of S2308, but not rough mutant CA180 was PI3-kinase and toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) dependent. Differences in uptake were associated with differences in macrophage activation with regard to NF-kappaB translocation and cytokine production. These results provide evidence that the presence of B. abortus OPS dictates the interactions between Brucella and specific cell surface receptors minimizing macrophage activation and enhancing Brucella survival and/or persistence.",M2
18390151,"[Multiplication of <e>Brucella abortus</e> and production of nitric oxide in two macrophage cell lines of different origin]Brucella abortus is a bacterium which causes abortions and infertility in cattle and undulant fever in humans. It multiplies intracellularly, evading the mechanisms of cellular death. Nitric oxide (NO) is important in the regulation of the immune response. In the present work, we studied the ability of three B. abortus strains to survive intracellularly in two macrophage cell lines. The bacterial multiplication in both cell lines was determined at two different times in UFC/ ml units. Moreover the inoculated cells were also observed under light-field and fluorescence microscopy stained with Giemsa and acridine orange, respectively. The stain of both cellular lines showed similar results with respect to the UFC/ml determination. The presence of B. abortus was confirmed by electronic microscopy. In both macrophage cell lines inoculated with the rough strain RB51, the multiplication diminished and the level of NO was higher, compared with cells inoculated with smooth strains (S19 and 2308). These results suggest that the absence of O-chain of LPS probably affects the intracellular growth of B. abortus.",M2
18359093,"Improved performance of Brucella melitensis native hapten over <e>Brucella abortus</e> OPS tracer on goat antibody detection by the fluorescence polarization assay.The current method for goat brucellosis diagnosis is based on the World Organization for Animal Health (OIE) using the screening card test (CT), with antigen at 8% (CT8) or 3% (CT3) of cell concentrations, and the confirmatory complement fixation test (CFT). However, these tests do not differentiate antibodies induced by vaccination from those derived from field infections by Brucella species or other bacterial agents; in places like Mexico, where the prevalence of brucellosis and the vaccination rates are high, there is a considerable percentage of false positive reactions that causes significant unnecessary slaughter of animals. Furthermore, results of the fluorescence polarization assay (FPA) using the Brucella abortus O-polysaccharide (OPS) tracer in goats are poorer than those with cattle. The present study was undertaken to investigate a tracer prepared from the native hapten (NH) of the Rev. 1 strain of Brucella melitensis to improve FPA performance on goat brucellosis diagnosis. Evaluation of 48 positive samples and 96 negative samples showed that the NH tracer was more accurate (p&lt;0.01) than the OPS tracer (97.2% vs. 93.8% accuracy, respectively). On the diagnostic performance evaluation, the NH tracer performed better (87.5% accuracy, 79.5% sensitivity, 84.3% specificity, and 163.8 performance index) than the OPS tracer (83.5%, 75.9%, 81.0%, and 156.9, respectively) using 1009 positive and 2039 negative Mexican field goat sera samples selected by test series approved by the OIE (card test 3% and CFT). We demonstrated a new application for the NH lipopolysaccharide on detecting antibodies against Brucella using the FPA, which may yield faster results (minutes vs. 24-72h) than the immunodiagnosis assays frequently used in bovine brucellosis. In addition, NH tracer produces similar or better performance results than the conventional OPS tracer, using the FPA in goat sera samples.",M2
18346482,"Brucellosis in camels (Camelus dromedarius) in Darfur, Western Sudan.In a field outbreak of brucellosis in 21 camels mixed with cattle, sheep and goats, five camels, three of which showed clinical signs, were serologically positive. In a subsequent abattoir survey of apparently healthy camels, six animals were seropositive, albeit with titres that tended to be lower than those found in the field outbreak. Of the six seropositive slaughtered camels, five were shown to have lymph nodes (prescapular and supramammary) infected with brucellae (Brucella melitensis biovar 3, two camels; <e>Brucella abortus</e> biovar 6, three camels). Infection of camels with B. abortus biovar 6 had not previously been reported.

The subjects included in the present study were tested twice-at a 1-month interval-for the presence of anti-B. abortus antibodies in the serum by agglutination, complement fixation and flow cytometry. Cases (335 subjects) included animals consistently positive to all these tests; controls (335 subjects) comprised animals exposed yet negative by the same tests. The serum from genetically resistant subjects displayed in vitro significantly higher antibacterial activity compared to the serum from genetically susceptible subjects, lending biological significance to the results from the association study. Inhibition of the antibacterial activity following heat treatment of the serum, addition of specific MBL inhibitors (EDTA, mannose, N-acetyl-D: -glucosamine) or anti-human MBL antiserum provide convincing evidence that the antibacterial activity present in the serum results from the interaction between MBL and B. abortus.

18317925,"Brain atrophy in a murine model of chronic fatigue syndrome and beneficial effect of Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41).Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is associated with the main symptoms of chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) and neuron apoptosis. Nevertheless, no study has been performed directly to explore the relationship between CFS, BDNF and neuron apoptosis. We induced a CFS model by six injections of killed <e>Brucella abortus</e> antigen in BALB/c mice and treated them with Hochu-ekki-to (TJ-41). Daily running activity, body weight (BW), ratio of cerebral weight to BW (CW/BW) and expression levels of BDNF and Bcl-2 mRNA in the hippocampus were determined. The daily activity and CW/BW decreased significantly in the CFS model. BDNF and Bcl-2 mRNA expression levels in the hippocampus were suppressed in the CFS model and TJ-41 treated mice, while no significant difference was found between them. We improved a murine model to investigate the relationship between CFS and brain dysfunction. In this model, reduced daily activity might have been associated with decreased hippocampal BDNF mRNA expression, hippocampal apoptosis and brain atrophy. TJ-41 increased the daily running activity of the model, which was independent of brain recovery.",M2
18316388,"Modulation of the bovine trophoblastic innate immune response by <e>Brucella abortus</e>.Brucellosis is still a widespread zoonotic disease. Very little is known about the interaction between Brucella abortus and trophoblastic cells, which is essential for better understanding the pathogenesis of the Brucella-induced placentitis and abortion, a key event for transmission of the disease. The goal of this study was to evaluate the profile of gene expression by bovine trophoblastic cells during infection with B. abortus. Explants of chorioallantoic membranes were inoculated with B. abortus strain 2308. Microarray analysis was performed at 4 h after infection, and expression of cytokines and chemokines by trophoblastic cells was assessed by real-time reverse transcription-PCR at 6 and 12 h after inoculation. In addition, cytokine and chemokine expression in placentomes from experimentally infected cows was evaluated. Expression of proinflammatory genes by trophoblastic cells was suppressed at 4 h after inoculation, whereas a significant upregulation of CXC chemokines, namely, CXCL6 (GCP-2) and CXCL8 (interleukin 8), was observed at 12 but not at 6 h after inoculation. Placentomes of experimentally infected cows had a similar profile of chemokine expression, with upregulation of CXCL6 and CXCL8. Our data indicate that B. abortus modulates the innate immune response by trophoblastic cells, suppressing the expression of proinflammatory mediators during the early stages of infection that is followed by a delayed and mild expression of proinflammatory chemokines, which is similar to the profile of chemokine expression in the placentomes of experimentally infected cows. This trophoblastic response is likely to contribute to the pathogenesis of B. abortus-induced placentitis.",M2

Groups I to V received, respectively, the recommended dose (RD) of RB51 vaccine once, RD twice 4 weeks apart, double RD once, double RD twice 4 weeks apart, and saline once (control). Vaccination did not result in a serological response. Experimental animals released 27 weeks post initial inoculation (27 PIIW) into a brucellosis-positive herd failed to seroconvert after 29 weeks. Experimental challenge commenced at 57 PIIW. All animals received B. abortus biovar 1 intraconjunctivally at 0, 5 and 9 weeks post experimental exposure (PEEW). Serum samples collected at 4, 8 and 13 PEEW were negative. At 16 PEEW all animals received B. abortus biovar 1 subcutaneously (SC), and all seroconverted by 20 PEEW. Five of twenty-six animals were positive for Brucella infection on bacterial culture. Brucella abortus biovar 1 was isolated from three animals; B. abortus RB51 was isolated from two.

Studying their intracellular life cycle is key to understanding virulence and requires methodologies that can identify the compartments in which they localize and characterize the replicative niche they generate. Here, we describe immunofluorescence-based microscopy techniques applied to the intracellular pathogens Brucella abortus and Francisella tularensis during their respective intracellular cycles inside murine bone marrow-derived macrophages. Standard immunofluorescence techniques are used to define the intracellular localization of the pathogens based on their co-localization with specifically labeled macrophage organelles. In addition, we describe an assay to assess the integrity of Francisella-containing phagosomes and bacterial release into the macrophage cytoplasm, which is a hallmark of Francisella intracellular pathogenesis.",M2
18266913,"Brucella intracellular replication requires trafficking through the late endosomal/lysosomal compartment.Upon entry into mammalian cells, the intracellular pathogen <e>Brucella abortus</e> resides within a membrane-bound compartment, the Brucella-containing vacuole (BCV), the maturation of which is controlled by the bacterium to generate a replicative organelle derived from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). Prior to reaching the ER, Brucella is believed to ensure its intracellular survival by inhibiting fusion of the intermediate BCV with late endosomes and lysosomes, although such BCVs are acidic and accumulate the lysosomal-associated membrane protein (LAMP-1). Here, we have further examined the nature of intermediate BCVs using confocal microscopy and live cell imaging. We show that BCVs rapidly acquire several late endocytic markers, including the guanosine triphosphatase Rab7 and its effector Rab-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), and are accessible to fluid-phase markers either delivered to the whole endocytic pathway or preloaded to lysosomes, indicating that BCVs interact with late endosomes and lysosomes. Consistently, intermediate BCVs are acidic and display proteolytic activity up to 12 h post-infection. Expression of dominant-negative Rab7 or overexpression of RILP significantly impaired the ability of bacteria to convert their vacuole into an ER-derived organelle and replicate, indicating that BCV maturation requires interactions with functional late endosomal/lysosomal compartments. In cells expressing dominant-negative Rab7[T22N], BCVs remained acidic, yet displayed decreased fusion with lysosomes. Taken together, these results demonstrate that BCVs traffic along the endocytic pathway and fuse with lysosomes, and such fusion events are required for further maturation of BCVs into an ER-derived replicative organelle.",M2
18214602,"Defensin susceptibility and colonization in the mouse model of AJ100, a polymyxin B-resistant, <e>Brucella abortus</e> RB51 isolate.Intracellular pathogens selected for increased susceptibility to polycations are commonly attenuated, yet the effect of decreased susceptibility to polycations on pathogenicity has not been researched. The polymyxin-resistant mutant Brucella abortus AJ100 was characterized by comparing its susceptibility to the polycationic antibiotic polymyxin B, defensins, and lactoferricin, and its colonization and clearance in the mouse model to the parent strain RB51. MIC (minimum inhibitory concentration) values determined by Etest for AJ100 and RB51 were 1.5 and 0.25 mug/ml, respectively. Though AJ100 is less susceptible to polymyxin B than RB51, it was more susceptible than its parent strain to the cationic defensins melittin, magainin 2, and cecropin P1. In the mouse model, initial colonization of the spleen was lower for AJ100 than RB51, and the rate of clearance from the spleen was faster for AJ100 than RB51. However, initial colonization and clearance rates of AJ100 from the liver were indistinguishable from those of RB51. This study suggests that the susceptibility profile of Brucella to polycationic defensins rather than polymyxin B may be indicative of differential survival in the spleen and liver in the mouse and is indicative of spleen and liver residential macrophages' differing ability to inactivate Brucella.",M2

NYSDOH conducted a survey of participating laboratories and identified 17 laboratories that reported handling the RB51 sample in a manner placing lab workers at potential risk for exposure. Subsequently, CDC recommended that public health officials conduct a review of biosafety practices at all LPS-participating laboratories to identify any additional RB51 exposures. This report summarizes the results of investigations in 36 states, two cities, one county, and the District of Columbia. As of January 14, 2008, follow-up by public health officials with LPS-participating laboratories throughout the United States identified a total of 916 laboratory workers in 254 laboratories with potential RB51 exposure.

18178848,"Central role of MyD88-dependent dendritic cell maturation and proinflammatory cytokine production to control <e>Brucella abortus</e> infection.Brucella abortus is a facultative intracellular bacterium that infects humans and domestic animals. The enhanced susceptibility to virulent B. abortus observed in MyD88 knockout (KO) mice led us to investigate the mechanisms involved in MyD88-dependent immune responses. First, we defined the role of MyD88 in dendritic cell (DC) maturation. In vitro as well as in vivo, B. abortus-exposed MyD88 KO DCs displayed a significant impairment on maturation as observed by expression of CD40, CD86, and MHC class II on CD11c+ cells. In addition, IL-12 and TNF-alpha production was totally abrogated in MyD88 KO DCs and macrophages. Furthermore, B. abortus-induced IL-12 production was found to be dependent on TLR2 in DC, but independent on TLR2 and TLR4 in macrophages. Additionally, we investigated the role of exogenous IL-12 and TNF-alpha administration on MyD88 KO control of B. abortus infection. Importantly, IL-12, but not TNF-alpha, was able to partially rescue host susceptibility in MyD88 KO-infected animals. Furthermore, we demonstrated the role played by TLR9 during virulent B. abortus infection. TLR9 KO-infected mice showed 1 log Brucella CFU higher than wild-type mice. Macrophages and DC from TLR9 KO mice showed reduced IL-12 and unaltered TNF-alpha production when these cells were stimulated with Brucella. Together, these results suggest that susceptibility of MyD88 KO mice to B. abortus is due to impaired DC maturation and lack of IL-12 synthesis. Additionally, DC activation during Brucella infection plays an important regulatory role by stimulating and programming T cells to produce IFN-gamma.",M2

METHODOLOGY: Female SD rats were orally administered with 1.0 x 10(7) colony forming unit (cfu) suspension of SRB51 and half of these SD rats were challenged at 4 weeks post inoculation with 1.0 x 10(9) cfu suspension of B. abortus biotype 1 isolated in South Korea. Sera of SD rats were monitored at regular intervals by western blot assay using whole cell antigen of B. abortus strain 1119-3 (S1119-3). The bacteriological examination of blood and clinical examination of the rats were also performed. RESULTS: There were several bands at 120, 70, 45, 30, 20 kDa and clear specific bands were found after vaccination (20, 70 kDa) and challenge (15, 20, 45, 70, 120 kDa). The highest immune response was observed in sera 4 weeks post SRB51 vaccination.

METHODOLOGY: Twenty-five rats were used and the rats were classified into two groups, an infected group (n=15) and a control group (n=10). At 18 days of gestation 500 microliters containing 1.0 x 10(9) colony forming unit (CFU) suspension of B. abortus biotype 1 Korean isolate in physiological saline solution was injected subcutaneously to each of 15 rats, and ten rats were injected with only 500 microliters of physiological saline. The SD rats were examined clinically and the spleen, lymph nodes, uterus and placenta were examined grossly and microscopically. Additionally these organs as well as the blood were cultured bacteriologically. RESULTS: There were no stillbirths, abortions or premature births in any of the SD rats. The gross signs of all the SD rats of the infected group included splenomegaly, metritis, enlargement of lymph nodes and placentitis. Moreover, B. abortus biotype 1 were detected in the organs of infected SD rats as well as in the blood. The microscopic signs of the SD rats of the infected group included infiltrations of macrophages, giant cells and engorged macrophages scattered in necrotic debris in the lymph nodes. In the spleen, there was diffuse congestion of the red pulp, diffuse infiltration of macrophages with increased giant cell numbers and prominent germinal centres. In the uterus, there was moderate, diffuse, but multifocally prominent accumulation of lymphocytes and macrophages in the superficial lamina.

18024491,"Establishment of a method for evaluating intracellular antibiotic efficacy in <e>Brucella abortus</e>-infected Mono Mac 6 monocytes.BACKGROUND: Brucellae produce chronic and often lifelong infections in natural hosts. The persistent nature of these infections is predominantly due to the capacity of these bacteria to maintain intracellular residence in host macrophages. Successful antimicrobial therapy requires eradication of brucellae from this intracellular niche. It is important to seek new and improved antimicrobials for brucellosis therapy as well as a method to efficiently evaluate their intracellular efficacy. OBJECTIVES: For that reason, we have developed a method to evaluate intracellular drug efficacy for new and improved antimicrobials that show initial in vitro activity against Brucella species during drug screening. METHODS: Mono Mac 6 monocytes (MM6) were used because they are the only human cell line that constitutively expresses the phenotypic and functional characteristics of mature monocytes. This cell line has not previously been used with Brucella, therefore parallel studies were performed with J774 murine macrophages. Both cell lines were infected with Brucella abortus 2308 and antibiotics used clinically for treatment of brucellosis were used to determine intracellular efficacy. RESULTS: Significant differences in bacterial burden were observed at or above the MIC in both cell lines. Drug concentrations that fell below the MIC were found to significantly reduce intracellular brucellae only in MM6. CONCLUSIONS: The MM6 intracellular efficacy model will provide a useful method to examine the effect of novel antimicrobials for the treatment of human brucellosis.",M2
17984211,"<e>Brucella abortus</e> inhibits major histocompatibility complex class II expression and antigen processing through interleukin-6 secretion via Toll-like receptor 2.The strategies that allow Brucella abortus to survive inside macrophages for prolonged periods and to avoid the immunological surveillance of major histocompatibility complex class II (MHC-II)-restricted gamma interferon (IFN-gamma)-producing CD4+ T lymphocytes are poorly understood. We report here that infection of THP-1 cells with B. abortus inhibited expression of MHC-II molecules and antigen (Ag) processing. Heat-killed B. abortus (HKBA) also induced both these phenomena, indicating the independence of bacterial viability and involvement of a structural component of the bacterium. Accordingly, outer membrane protein 19 (Omp19), a prototypical B. abortus lipoprotein, inhibited both MHC-II expression and Ag processing to the same extent as HKBA. Moreover, a synthetic lipohexapeptide that mimics the structure of the protein lipid moiety also inhibited MHC-II expression, indicating that any Brucella lipoprotein could down-modulate MHC-II expression and Ag processing. Inhibition of MHC-II expression and Ag processing by either HKBA or lipidated Omp19 (L-Omp19) depended on Toll-like receptor 2 and was mediated by interleukin-6. HKBA or L-Omp19 also inhibited MHC-II expression and Ag processing of human monocytes. In addition, exposure to the synthetic lipohexapeptide inhibited Ag-specific T-cell proliferation and IFN-gamma production of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from Brucella-infected patients. Together, these results indicate that there is a mechanism by which B. abortus may prevent recognition by T cells to evade host immunity and establish a chronic infection.",M2
17979549,"Generation and characterization of murine monoclonal antibodies to recombinant 26-kDa periplasmic protein of <e>Brucella abortus</e>.In the present study, hybridomas were developed for the production of monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against recombinant 26-kDa periplasmic protein (rBP26) of Brucella abortus. A set of six stabilized hybridoma cell lines were generated. Monoclonal antibodies secreted by all of these clones exhibited reaction for rBP26, as well as with the protein of 26-kDa, derived from whole cell lysate of B. abortus 544. Three out of six MAbs were IgG1, two were IgM, and one was IgG2b in nature. These MAbs did not show any cross-reaction with whole cell lysate of Yersinia enterocolitica O: 9, Vibrio cholerae, Salmonella typhimurium, and Escherichia coli O157 in Western blot analysis. Reactivity of these MAbs was further assessed with other organisms of Brucella species, namely, B. abortus 544, B. canis, B. melitensis 16M, and B. suis. Collectively, these data suggest that these MAbs may have the potential for their use in the detection of Brucella species with high specificity.",M2
17938225,"Interaction of Brucella suis and <e>Brucella abortus</e> rough strains with human dendritic cells.Brucella is a facultative intracellular pathogen of various mammals and the etiological agent of brucellosis. We recently demonstrated that dendritic cells (DCs), which are critical components of adaptive immunity, are highly susceptible to Brucella infection. Furthermore, Brucella prevented the infected DCs from engaging in maturation processes and impaired their capacity to present antigen to naive T cells and to secrete interleukin-12 (IL-12). The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) phenotype is largely associated with the virulence of Brucella. Depending on whether they express the O-side chain of LPS or not, the bacteria display a smooth or rough phenotype. Rough Brucella mutants are attenuated and induce a potent protective T-cell-dependent immune response. Due to the essential role of DCs in the initiation of T-cell-dependent adaptive immune responses, it seemed pertinent to study the interaction between rough Brucella strains and human DCs. In the present paper, we report that, in contrast to smooth bacteria, infection of DCs with rough mutants of Brucella suis or Brucella abortus leads to both phenotypic and functional maturation of infected cells. Rough mutant-infected DCs then acquire the capacity to produce IL-12 and to stimulate naive CD4+ T lymphocytes. Experiments with rough and smooth purified LPS of Brucella supported the hypothesis of an indirect involvement of the O-side chain. These results provide new data concerning the role of LPS in Brucella virulence strategy and illuminate phenomena contributing to immune protection conferred by rough vaccine strains.",M2
