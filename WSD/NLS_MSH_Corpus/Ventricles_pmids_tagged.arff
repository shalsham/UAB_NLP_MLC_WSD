20464819,"Ventricular chamber sphericity during spaceflight and parabolic flight intervals of less than 1 G.INTRODUCTION: Pathology driven alterations in the geometric shape of the heart have been found to result in regional changes in ventricular wall stress and a remodeling of the myocardium. If reductions in the gravitational forces acting on the heart produce similar changes in the overall contour of the <e>ventricles</e>, this modification might also induce adaptations in the cardiac structure during long-term spaceflight. In this study we examined the changes in left ventricle (LV) shape in spaceflight and during parabolic flights. METHODS: The diastole dimensions of the human LV were assessed with echocardiography during spaceflight and in parabolic flights which replicated the gravity of the Moon, Mars, and spaceflight and were compared to findings in Earth's gravity. LV dimensions were translated into circularity indices and geometric aspect ratios and correlated with their corresponding gravitational conditions. RESULTS: During parabolic flight, a linear relationship (r = 0.99) was found between both the circularity index and geometric aspect ratio values and the respective gravitational fields in which they were measured. During spaceflight (N = 4) and parabolic flights (N = 3), there was an average 4.1 and 4.4% higher circularity index and a 5.3 and 8.1% lower geometric aspect ratio, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: A correlative trend was found between the degree of LV sphericity and the amount of gravitational force directed caudal to the longitudinal orientation of the body. The importance of this finding is uncertain, but may have implications regarding physiologic adaptations in the myocardial structure secondary to changes in LV wall stress upon prolonged exposure to microgravity.",M1
20459418,"[Changes of repolarization properties of the right ventricle in hypertensive left ventricular hypertrophy]Repolarization properties of left ventricular (LV) myocardium change during its hypertrophy of various genesis. Aim of this work was to study repolarization of epicardial surface of the right ventricle (RV) in experimental model of LV hypertrophy caused by renovascular hypertension in rats. We registered 32 unipolar electrograms on the surface of cardiac <e>ventricles</e> and calculated duration of activation recovery intervals for assessment of repolarization. In hypertensive rats relative LV mass was 26% greater than in control rats, while relative mass of RV was similar in both groups. Length of activation recovery intervals in hypertension was 1.7 times greater than in control group on both LV and RV surfaces. Dispersion of activation recovery intervals did not differ significantly between groups. Thus in LV hypertrophy in rats caused by renovascular hypertension electrical remodeling of myocardium occurs not only in left but also in right ventricle.",M1
20459400,"[Right ventricular remodeling after myocardial infarctions of different location]AIM: To study dynamic dimensional and functional changes of both <e>ventricles</e> after myocardial infarctions (MI) of different locations. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Patients with first acute ST elevation MI (n=180) were distribution to 3 groups: anterior (AMI), inferior (IMI), and posterolateral (PLMI). EchoCG dimensional parameters of LV and RV as well as functional two dimensional EchoCG, flow and tissue doppler parameters were measured on days 7, 90 and after 1 year of follow up to reveal systolic or diastolic dysfunction of both chambers. RESULTS: After 1 year of follow up significant LV remodeling with systolic and diastolic dysfunction was observed in AMI compared with IMI and PLMI. Pronounced RV remodeling was revealed in acute stage of IMI, compared with AMI and PLMI. Dynamic follow up showed reversed RV remodeling in IMI with relative restoration of systolic and diastolic parameters, and progressive RV remodeling in AMI with significant systolic and diastolic dysfunction compared with IMI and PLMI. CONCLUSION: Thus, dynamic structural and functional changes occurr in both ventricles and depend on Ml site, with most ventricular compromise in AMI due to asynergy of the septum, as common ventricular wall plays major role in RV performance.",M1
20451696,"Significance of mechanical alterations in single ventricle patients on twisting and circumferential strain as determined by analysis of strain from gradient cine magnetic resonance imaging sequences.Preliminary speckle-tracking echocardiographic studies show that patients with single <e>ventricles</e> (SVs) have significantly decreased twisting and dyssynchrony of twisting. This could be related to abnormal cardiac looping, which leads to hearts that lack helical fiber patterns. The aim of this study was to analyze gradient cine magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) using Velocity Vector Imaging to assess cardiac mechanics. Subjects were 38 patients (aged 8 to 37 years) with SVs of left ventricular (n = 30) and indeterminate (n = 8) type who underwent cardiac MRI. Controls were 14 normal children and adults. Gradient cine MRI sequences close to the apex were subjected to a Velocity Vector Imaging analysis program adapted for MRI. In the control group, mean circumferential strain was -18.02 +/- 7.31%, mean dispersion of peak circumferential strain was 44.23 +/- 37.14 ms, and average rotation was -7.7 +/- 1.38 degrees . The rotation values were negative, or counterclockwise. In patients with SVs, mean circumferential strain was -8.87 +/- 7.30%, mean dispersion of peak circumferential strain was 181.55 +/- 76.07 ms, and average rotation was -2.6 +/- 1.24 degrees (p &lt;0.001). Mean dispersion of the peak of rotation in the control group was 39.6 +/- 22.8 ms, compared to 166.5 +/- 72.4 ms in patients with SVs. In conclusion, this study showed a dramatic decrease in apical rotation and circumferential strain in the SV group compared to the control group. Strain and rotation mechanics at the apex in patients with SVs showed marked dyssynchrony.",M1
20412480,"Neurodevelopmental outcomes in infants after surgery for congenital heart disease: a comparison of single-ventricle vs. two-ventricle physiology.INTRODUCTION: The neurodevelopmental outcome of children with repaired congenital heart defect has risen in importance with improved survival. This study compares neurodevelopmental outcomes of children who had CHD with single ventricle physiology with those who had CHD with two-ventricle physiology. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Participants included 112 infants discharged from the NICU between February 1999 to August 2006. The 12 infants who had a known genetic defect were excluded. Of the 100 infants 26 had single ventricle physiology and 74 had CHD with two-ventricle physiology. The children were seen in a follow-up clinic and growth parameters and standardized instruments were used to evaluate development. The referral rate to early intervention services was also compared. RESULTS: The number of functional <e>ventricles</e> did not significantly differentiate growth parameters at 6-8 months of age. Early cognitive outcomes were relatively unimpaired in both the groups (single ventricle vs. two ventricle physiology). Early motor outcomes were worse in (p &lt; 0.05) CHD with single ventricle physiology. The rate of referral for early intervention services was high in both groups compared to the average rate of referral in the state, but there was not a significant difference between the CHD groups. CONCLUSION: Significant differences noted on motor outcomes at the 6-8 month visit were no longer apparent in later visits. Referral to early intervention services is high in both the groups. These findings are important to those caring for infants with CHD because many of these patients may need referral for early intervention.",M1
20379051,"Manageability of acute severe heart failure complicated with left ventricular thrombosis during therapy for breast cancer.Trastuzumab-related cardiac dysfunction may be manageable and completely reversible with suitable cardiac medication, allowing optimal breast cancer treatment to continue. We present the case of a 42-year-old woman who developed severe systolic left ventricular failure with impaired contractility of the right ventricle, pulmonary hypertension, and clots in the left ventricular cavity during adjuvant treatment for breast cancer. The patient was initially diagnosed with early breast cancer and underwent surgery on her left breast. She received 6 cycles of anthracycline chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy in the left breast area, then 5 cycles of trastuzumab. After the fifth cycle of trastuzumab, she experienced dyspnoea and leg edema. Fluid was detected in the pleural cavities but no lung metastases were identified. Echocardiography was performed, revealing a severely reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (10%) with impaired contractility of the right ventricle and pulmonary hypertension. Standard medication for heart failure resulted in complete recovery of normal systolic and diastolic function of the left and right <e>ventricles</e>. The combination of low molecular weight heparin and acetylsalicylic acid completely resolved the thrombotic complications. The patient regained her full range of social, occupational, and family activities. This case study is the first to demonstrate the manageability and reversibility of trastuzumab-related cardiac complications in a patient who had developed severe heart failure complicated with left ventricular thrombosis during sequential anthracycline and trastuzumab therapy for breast cancer. The findings contradict other opinions that trastuzumab-related acute heart failure is analogous to stunning or hibernation and recovers without specific cardiac treatment.",M1
20304145,"Ventricular restraint therapy for heart failure: the right ventricle is different from the left ventricle.OBJECTIVE: Effects of ventricular restraint on the left ventricle are well documented, but effects on the right ventricle are not. We hypothesized that restraint affects the right and left <e>ventricles</e> differently. METHODS: We studied acute effects of restraint on left and right ventricular mechanics in healthy sheep (n = 14) with our previously described technique of adjustable and measurable restraint. Transmural pressure, myocardial oxygen consumption indices, diastolic compliance, and end-systolic elastance were assessed at 4 restraint levels for both ventricles. We then studied long-term effects of restraint for 4 months in an ovine model of ischemic dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 6). Heart failure was induced by coronary artery ligation, and polypropylene mesh was wrapped around the heart to simulate clinical restraint therapy. All subjects were followed up with serial cardiac magnetic resonance imaging to assess left and right ventricular volumes and function. RESULTS: Restraint decreased left ventricular transmural pressure (P &lt; .03) and myocardial oxygen consumption indices (P &lt; .05) but not left ventricular diastolic compliance (P = .52). Restraint had no effect on right ventricular transmural pressure (P = .82) or myocardial oxygen consumption indices (P = .72) but reduced right ventricular diastolic compliance (P &lt; .01). In long-term studies, restraint led to reverse left ventricular remodeling with decreased left ventricular end-diastolic volume (P &lt; .006) but did not affect right ventricular end-diastolic volume (P = .82). CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular restraint affects the left and right ventricles differently. Benefits of restraint for right ventricular function are unclear. The left ventricle can tolerate more restraint than the right ventricle. With current devices, the right ventricle may limit overall therapeutic efficacy.",M1
20228258,"Effects of mechanical loading on early conduction system differentiation in the chick.The primary ring, a horseshoe-shaped structure situated between the left and right ventricle and connected superiorly to the atrioventricular canal, is the first specialized fast ventricular conduction pathway in the embryonic heart. It has been first defined immunohistochemically and is characterized as a region of slow myocyte proliferation. Recent studies have shown that it participates in spreading the ventricular electrical activation during stages preceding ventricular septation in the mouse, chick, and rat. Here we demonstrate its presence using optical mapping in chicks between embryonic days (ED) 3-5. We then tested the effects of hemodynamic unloading in the organ culture system upon its functionality. In ED3 hearts cultured without hemodynamic loading for 24 h, we observed a significant decrease in the percentage activated through the primary ring conduction pathway. A morphological examination revealed arrested growth, collapse, and elongation of the outflow tract and disorganized trabeculation. A similar reversal toward more primitive activation patterns was observed with culture between ED4 and ED5. This phenotype was completely rescued with the artificial loading of the <e>ventricles</e> with a droplet of silicone oil. We conclude that an appropriate loading is required during the early phases of the conduction system formation and maturation.",M1
20197490,"Self-beating atypically shaped cardiomyocytes survive a long-term postnatal development while preserving the expression of fetal cardiac genes in mice.The present study was designed to examine the postnatal developmental changes of atypically shaped cardiomyocytes (ACMs) prepared from the heart of newborn [postnatal day 1 (day-1)] through aged (12-month-old) mice. ACMs were identified as a novel type of self-beating cardiomyocyte with a peculiar morphology in mouse cardiac <e>ventricles</e>. The cell length of ACMs significantly increased during the first three postnatal months and further increased over the following 9 months. In contrast, the population of ACMs was significantly decreased within the first 5 weeks and reached a plateau in the adult stage. ACMs obtained from newborn and adult mice exhibited similar spontaneous action potentials. The expression of the fetal cardiac gene products atrial natriuretic peptide and voltage-gated T-type Ca(2+) channel Ca(V)3.2 was confirmed by immunostaining in ACMs obtained from both newborn and aged mice. These observations provide evidence that ACMs that exhibit spontaneous beating survive the long-term postnatal development of cardiac ventricles while preserving the expression of fetal cardiac genes.

20190098,"Heterogeneous ventricular sympathetic innervation, altered beta-adrenergic receptor expression, and rhythm instability in mice lacking the p75 neurotrophin receptor.Sympathetic nerves stimulate cardiac function through the release of norepinephrine and the activation of cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic receptors. The sympathetic innervation of the heart is sculpted during development by chemoattractive factors including nerve growth factor (NGF) and the chemorepulsive factor semaphorin 3a. NGF acts through the TrkA receptor and the p75 neurotrophin receptor (p75(NTR)) in sympathetic neurons. NGF stimulates sympathetic axon extension into the heart through TrkA, but p75(NTR) modulates multiple coreceptors that can either stimulate or inhibit axon outgrowth. In mice lacking p75(NTR), the sympathetic innervation density in target tissues ranges from denervation to hyperinnervation. Recent studies have revealed significant changes in the sympathetic innervation density of p75NTR-deficient (p75(NTR-/-)) atria between early postnatal development and adulthood. We examined the innervation of adult p75(NTR-/-) <e>ventricles</e> and discovered that the subendocardium of the p75(NTR-/-) left ventricle was essentially devoid of sympathetic nerve fibers, whereas the innervation density of the subepicardium was normal. This phenotype is similar to that seen in mice overexpressing semaphorin 3a, and we found that sympathetic axons lacking p75(NTR) are more sensitive to semaphorin 3a in vitro than control neurons. The lack of subendocardial innervation was associated with decreased dP/dt, altered cardiac beta(1)-adrenergic receptor expression and sensitivity, and a significant increase in spontaneous ventricular arrhythmias. The lack of p75(NTR) also resulted in increased tyrosine hydroxylase content in cardiac sympathetic neurons and elevated norepinephrine in the right ventricle, where innervation density was normal.",M1
20173133,"Right ventricular involvement in acute left ventricular myocardial infarction: prognostic implications of MRI findings.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate the prevalence and prognostic importance of the cardiac MRI finding of right ventricular involvement in patients with acute ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction (MI). SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifty patients (41 men, nine women; mean age, 58 +/- 11 years) with first-ST-segment elevation MI underwent 1.5-T cardiac MRI immediately after successful percutaneous coronary intervention. The cardiac MRI protocol included steady-state free precession cine sequences for functional assessment of the left, right, and both <e>ventricles</e> and inversion recovery FLASH delayed enhancement sequences after contrast administration for the quantification of myocardial damage. The prevalence of right ventricular involvement detected with ECG and echocardiography was compared with the prevalence detected with cardiac MRI, which was the reference standard. Patients underwent follow-up for 32 +/- 8 months. RESULTS: Right ventricular involvement was diagnosed with cardiac MRI in 27 patients (54%): 14 of 30 patients (47%) with inferior ST-segment elevation MI and 13 of 20 patients (65%) with anterior ST-segment elevation MI. ECG and echocardiographic findings showed only moderate agreement with cardiac MRI findings in the detection of right ventricular involvement in inferior acute MI (kappa = 0.38). Patients with right ventricular involvement in anterior ST-segment elevation MI had larger infarcts (delayed enhancement, 25.9% +/- 14.5% vs 11.4% +/- 10.1%; p = 0.030), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (34.3% +/- 8.2% vs 45.2% +/- 9.5%; p &lt; 0.015), and lower right ventricular ejection fraction (39.8% +/- 6.6% vs 54.9% +/- 8.8%; p &lt; 0.001) than those without right ventricular involvement. In a multivariate logistic regression model, right ventricular involvement was a strong independent predictor (odds ratio, 15.8; 95% CI, 4-63%) of major cardiac adverse events. CONCLUSION: Right ventricular involvement in ST-segment elevation MI is detected more frequently with cardiac MRI than with ECG and echocardiography and is an independent prognostic indicator.",M1
20167926,"Inotropic response of cardiac ventricular myocytes to beta-adrenergic stimulation with isoproterenol exhibits diurnal variation: involvement of nitric oxide.RATIONALE: Although &gt;10% of cardiac gene expression displays diurnal variations, little is known of their impact on excitation-contraction coupling. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether the time of day affects excitation-contraction coupling in rat <e>ventricles</e>. METHODS AND RESULTS: Left ventricular myocytes were isolated from rat hearts at 2 opposing time points, corresponding to the animals resting or active periods. Basal contraction and [Ca(2+)](i) was significantly greater in myocytes isolated during the resting versus active periods (cell shortening 12.4+/-0.3 versus 11.0+/-0.2%; P&lt;0.05 and systolic [Ca(2+)](i) 422+/-12 versus 341+/-9 nmol/L; P&lt;0.01. This corresponded to a greater sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR) Ca(2+) load (672+/-20 versus 551+/-13 nmol/L P&lt;0.001). The increase in systolic [Ca(2+)](i) in response to isoproterenol (&gt;3 nmol/L) was also significantly greater in resting versus active period myocytes, reflecting a greater SR Ca(2+) load at this time. This diurnal variation in response of Ca(2+)-homeostasis to isoproterenol translated to a greater incidence of arrhythmic activity in resting period myocytes. Inhibition of neuronal NO synthase during stimulation with isoproterenol, further increased systolic [Ca(2+)](i) and the percentage of arrhythmic myocytes, but this effect was significantly greater in active period versus resting period myocytes. Quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed a 2.65-fold increase in neuronal NO synthase mRNA levels in active over resting period myocytes (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The threshold for the development of arrhythmic activity in response to isoproterenol is higher during the active period of the rat. We suggest this reflects a reduction in SR Ca(2+) loading and a diurnal variation in neuronal NO synthase signaling.",M1
20160141,"Changes in left and right ventricular mechanics during the Mueller maneuver in healthy adults: a possible mechanism for abnormal cardiac function in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.BACKGROUND: Obstructive sleep apnea is highly prevalent in patients with cardiovascular disease and has detrimental effects on systolic and diastolic function of the <e>ventricles</e>. In this research, the changes in strain (S) and strain rate (SR) during the performance of the Mueller maneuver (MM) in an effort to better understand how negative intrathoracic pressures affect ventricular mechanics. METHODS AND RESULTS: The MM was performed to maintain a target intrathoracic pressure of -40 mm Hg. Echocardiography was used to measure various parameters of cardiac structure and function. Myocardial deformation measurements were performed using tissue speckle tracking. Twenty-four healthy subjects (9 women; mean age, 30+/-6 years) were studied. Global left ventricular longitudinal S in systole and SR in early filling were significantly decreased during the MM (S: baseline, -17.0+/-1.6%; MM, -14.5+/-2.2%; P&lt;0.0001, SR: baseline, 1.09+/-0.20 s(-1); MM, 0.92+/-0.21 s(-1); P=0.01). Global right ventricular longitudinal S was also significantly decreased during the MM (baseline, -22.0+/-3.1%; MM, -17.2+/-2.5%; P&lt;0.0001), as was global right ventricular longitudinal systolic SR (baseline, -1.34+/-0.35 s(-1); MM, -1.02+/-0.21 s(-1); P=0.0006). CONCLUSIONS: Left ventricular and right ventricular longitudinal deformation are significantly reduced during the MM. These results suggest that negative intrathoracic pressure during apnea may contribute to changes in myocardial mechanics. These results could help explain the observed changes in left ventricular and right ventricular mechanics in patients with obstructive sleep apnea.",M1
20154259,"RT variability unrelated to heart period and respiration progressively increases during graded head-up tilt.Open-loop linear parametric models were exploited to describe ventricular repolarization duration (VRD) variability during graded head-up tilt. Surface ECG and thoracic movements were recorded in 15 healthy humans (age: 24-54 yr, median: 28 yr; 6 women and 9 men). Tilt table inclinations ranged from 15 to 90 degrees and were varied in steps of 15 degrees . All subjects underwent recordings at every step in random order. Heart period was assessed as the time difference between two consecutive R-wave peaks (RR) and the respiratory signal (R) as the sampling of the thoracic movement signal at the R-wave peaks. VRD was measured automatically as the temporal difference between the R-wave peak and T-wave apex (RT(a)) or T-wave end (RT(e)). The best model decomposed RT variability as due to RR changes (RR-related RT variability) to direct respiratory-related inputs (R-related RT variability) and to unknown rhythmical sources unrelated to RR changes and R (RR-R-unrelated RT variability). Using this model, RT(e) variability was found to be less predictable than RT(a) variability and composed of a smaller fraction of RR-related RT variability and a larger fraction of RR-R-unrelated RT variability. Predictability progressively decreased with tilt table angles, suggesting increased complexity of RT regulation. RT variance progressively increased with tilt table inclination. This increase was characterized by a gradual rise of the amount of RR-R-unrelated RT variability, whereas the amount of RR-related RT variability remained unchanged. These results suggest that the amount of RT variability, complexity of RT dynamics, and amount of RR-R-unrelated RT variability increase with the magnitude of the sympathetic drive directly related to tilt table inclination. We propose the utilization of the amount of RR-R-unrelated RT variability instead of overall RT variability as an indirect measure of autonomic regulation directed to <e>ventricles</e>.",M1
20152692,"Dynamic assessment of right ventricular volumes and function by real-time three-dimensional echocardiography: a comparison study with magnetic resonance imaging in 100 adult patients.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to validate a novel real-time three-dimensional echocardiographic (RT3DE) analysis tool for the determination of right ventricular volumes and function in unselected adult patients. METHODS: A total of 100 consecutive adult patients with normal or pathologic right <e>ventricles</e> were enrolled in the study. A dynamic polyhedron model of the right ventricle was generated using dedicated RT3DE software. Volumes and ejection fractions were determined and compared with results obtained on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in 88 patients with adequate acquisitions. RESULTS: End-diastolic, end-systolic, and stroke volumes were slightly lower on RT3DE imaging than on MRI (124.0 +/- 34.4 vs 134.2 +/- 39.2 mL, P &lt; .001; 65.2 +/- 23.5 vs 69.7 +/- 25.5 mL, P = .02; and 58.8 +/- 18.4 vs 64.5 +/- 24.1 mL, P &lt; .01, respectively), while no significant difference was observed for ejection fraction (47.8 +/- 8.5% vs 48.2 +/- 10.8%, P = .57). Correlation coefficients on Bland-Altman analysis were r = 0.84 (mean difference, 10.2 mL; 95% confidence interval [CI], -31.3 to 51.7 mL) for end-diastolic volume, r = 0.83 (mean difference, 4.5 mL; 95% CI, -23.8 to 32.9 mL) for end-systolic volume, r = 0.77 (mean difference, 5.7 mL; 95% CI, -24.6 to 36.0 mL) for stroke volume, and r = 0.72 (mean difference, 0.4%; 95% CI, -14.2% to 15.1%) for ejection fraction. CONCLUSION: Right ventricular volumes and ejection fractions as assessed using RT3DE imaging compare well with MRI measurements. RT3DE imaging may become a time-saving and cost-saving alternative to MRI for the quantitative assessment of right ventricular size and function.",M1
20152253,"Structural and functional changes in left and right <e>ventricles</e> after major weight loss following bariatric surgery for morbid obesity.Obesity and bariatric surgery have been associated with changes in ventricular function and structure. The aim of the present study was to assess the long-term changes in left ventricular (LV) and right ventricular (RV) function and structure in patients with morbid obesity-body mass index &gt;or=40 kg/m(2) or &gt;or=35 kg/m(2) with co-morbidities-who had lost weight after bariatric surgery compared to nonsurgical controls. We reviewed 57 patients with morbid obesity who had undergone gastric bypass surgery and who had undergone echocardiography before and after surgery. A reference group (n = 57) was frequency matched for body mass index (+/-2 kg/m(2)), gender, age (+/-2 years), and follow-up duration (+/-6 months). After a mean follow-up of 3.6 years, the LV mass and LV mass indexed by height had decreased in the patients who had undergone bariatric surgery and had lost weight. In contrast, these measurements had increased in the patients who had not undergone bariatric surgery. The difference between these 2 groups remained significant after adjusting for potential confounders. At follow-up, neither the patients nor controls showed a significant change in ejection fraction, LV myocardial performance index, or RV myocardial performance index. In the study population as a whole, multivariate analysis showed a positive correlation between the change in body weight and ventricular septum thickness (R = 0.33), posterior wall thickness (R = 0.31), LV mass (R = 0.38), RV end-diastolic area (R = 0.22), and estimated RV systolic pressure (R = 0.39), all with p values &lt;0.05. In conclusion, body weight changes in patients with morbid obesity were associated with changes in LV structure independent of improvement in obesity-related co-morbidities, including obstructive sleep apnea. Weight loss improved the RV end-diastolic area and might prevent progression to RV dysfunction.",M1
20128156,"Assessment of left ventricular function in non-dilated and dilated hearts: comparison of contrast-enhanced 2-dimensional echocardiography with multi-detector row CT angiography.OBJECTIVE: Multidetector-row CT (MDCT) and contrast-enhanced echocardiography (CEE) are being increasingly used for assessment of left ventricular (LV) function. Excellent spatial and contrast resolution of MDCT allows this evaluation along with coronary angiography. CEE improves the accuracy of 2D echocardiography. Data on side-by-side comparison of both techniques for assessment of LV size and function in subjects with a non-dilated or dilated left ventricle are limited. METHODS AND RESULTS: Our study population included 64 patients. Group I included 31 patients with an implanted pacemaker who had a non-dilated left ventricle with preserved systolic function. Group II comprised 33 patients with dilated cardiomyopathy and severe systolic LV dysfunction. LV end-diastolic and end-systolic volumes (LVEDV, LVESV) and ejection fraction (LVEF) were assessed using both CEE and short-axis MDCT. The results obtained by both techniques were compared by linear regression and Bland-Altman analysis. Additionally, intra- and interobserver reproducibility was assessed. Both CEE and MDCT measurements highly correlated (r = 0.61-0.94). However, CEE significantly underestimated LVEDV and LVESV, and this bias was higher with enlarged LV volumes. LVEF was overestimated by CEE in both groups with a higher bias in the group with preserved systolic function. Both intra- and interobserver reproducibility was significantly better for MDCT, the worst reproducibility was observed for CEE in group I. CONCLUSION: Despite a high correlation between MDCT and CEE measurements, CEE provides consistently lower volumes and higher LVEF. This suggests that both methods are not completely interchangeable. Reproducibility of CEE is inferior to reproducibility of MDCT, especially in non-dilated left <e>ventricles</e> with preserved function.",M1
20122149,"Relation between cardiac dimensions and peak oxygen uptake.BACKGROUND: Long term endurance training is known to increase peak oxygen uptake (VO2peak) and induce morphological changes of the heart such as increased left ventricular mass (LVM). However, the relationship between and the total heart volume (THV), considering both the left and right ventricular dimensions in both males and females, is not completely described. Therefore, the aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that THV is an independent predictor of VO2peak and to determine if the left and right <e>ventricles</e> enlarge in the same order of magnitude in males and females with a presumed wide range of THV. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study population consisted of 131 subjects of whom 71 were athletes (30 female) and 60 healthy controls (20 female). All subjects underwent cardiovascular MR and maximal incremental exercise test. Total heart volume, LVM and left- and right ventricular end-diastolic volumes (LVEDV, RVEDV) were calculated from short-axis images. was significantly correlated to THV, LVM, LVEDV and RVEDV in both males and females. Multivariable analysis showed that THV was a strong, independent predictor of (R2 = 0.74, p &lt; 0.001). As LVEDV increased, RVEDV increased in the same order of magnitude in both males and females (R2 = 0.87, p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: Total heart volume is a strong, independent predictor of maximal work capacity for both males and females. Long term endurance training is associated with a physiologically enlarged heart with a balance between the left and right ventricular dimensions in both genders.",M1
20104454,"Factors associated with the presence of tricuspid valve regurgitation in patients with systemic right <e>ventricles</e> following atrial switch.BACKGROUND: The development of significant tricuspid regurgitation (TR) is associated with an unfavorable clinical outcome in patients with systemic right ventricles. Increased knowledge about the factors contributing to its presence would help prevent its progression. Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of the factors predictive of significant TR in 60 patients with systemic right ventricles following an atrial switch procedure for complete transposition of the great arteries. Data from echocardiographic examinations, exercise radionuclide angiography, and myocardial perfusion imaging were analyzed. RESULTS: Significant TR was present in 20% of patients. Compared to patients without significant TR, patients with significant TR were older at the time of surgery (p &lt; or = 0.001), with a higher body mass index (p &lt; or = 0.005), lower right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF; p &lt; or = 0.01), higher exercise perfusion abnormalities score on radionuclide angiography (p &lt; or = 0.03), and higher systolic blood pressure (p &lt; or = 0.02). At univariate logistic regression analysis systolic blood pressure (p = 0.03), increasing age at surgery (p = 0.01), and RVEF (p = 0.02), were predictors of significant tricuspid regurgitation. The latter two remained significant at multivariate analysis. Conclusions: Patients operated upon later in life, with decreased RVEF and higher blood pressure, are at risk of significant tricuspid regurgitation and therefore warrant special attention. Prospective studies are needed to ascertain whether appropriate pharmacological intervention would prevent the development and/or progression of TR in these patients.",M1
20103229,"Pulmonary artery banding for functionally single <e>ventricles</e>: impact of tighter banding in staged Fontan era.BACKGROUND: In this study, we assessed our surgical strategy, tighter pulmonary artery banding (PAB) during the neonatal period, as an initial step followed by early application of bidirectional cavopulmonary shunts (BCPS) in infancy, to treat functionally single ventricles with unobstructed pulmonary blood flow. METHODS: On the basis of our surgical strategy, 68 consecutive patients underwent PAB and were divided into two groups, group 1 (January 1990 to June 2003; n = 30) and group 2 (July 2003 to August 2008; n = 38). The median age at PAB was 45 days in group 1 and 9 days in group 2. The circumference of the bands was significantly shorter in group 2 than in group 1, corresponding to the patient's weight in kg plus 19.0 +/- 0.6 mm in group 1 or 17.0 +/- 0.3 mm in group 2 (p = 0.003). RESULTS: Cardiac catheterization before the right heart bypass operation showed that the pulmonary artery index (group 1, 322 +/- 29; group 2, 283 +/- 27 mm(2)/m(2); p = 0.01), pulmonary resistance index (group 1, 2.4 +/- 0.2; group 2, 1.9 +/- 0.1 U x m(2); p = 0.03), and ventricular end-diastolic volume (group 1, 212 +/- 19%; group 2, 166 +/- 9%; p = 0.04) were significantly different between the two groups. The rates for achievement of right heart bypass at 12 months (group 1, 19%; group 2, 81%; p &lt; 0.01) and survival at 3 years (group 1, 70%; group 2, 87%; p = 0.04) were significantly higher in group 2 than in group 1. CONCLUSIONS: Our present strategy could prevent volume overload and improve the achievement and survival rates of right heart bypass operations.",M1
20103227,"Outcomes of biventricular repair for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries.BACKGROUND: This study was undertaken to evaluate long-term results of biventricular repairs for congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries, and to analyze the risk factors that affect mortality and morbidity. METHODS: Between 1983 and 2009, 167 patients with congenitally corrected transposition of the great arteries underwent biventricular repairs. The physiologic repairs were performed in 123 patients, and anatomic repairs in 44. Average follow-up was 9.3 +/- 6.6 years. RESULTS: Kaplan-Meier estimated survival was 83.3% +/- 0.5% at 25 years in biventricular repair. In anatomic repair, left ventricular training and right ventricular dysfunction had negative impact on survival, but bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt had positive impact on survival. The reoperation-free ratio was 10.1% +/- 7.8% at 22 years after physiologic repair, and 46.2% +/- 12.4% at 15 years after anatomic repair (p = 0.885). Freedom from any arrhythmia was 49.6% +/- 7.5% at 22 years after physiologic repair, and 60.8% +/- 14.8% at 18 years after anatomic repair (p = 0.458). Freedom from systemic atrioventricular valve and ventricular dysfunction as well as tricuspid valve and right ventricular dysfunction was significantly higher in anatomic repair than in physiologic repair. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term results of biventricular repair were satisfactory. Patients presenting with right ventricular dysfunction or need for left ventricular training represent a high-risk group of anatomic repair for which selection criteria are particularly important. Late functional outcomes of anatomic repair were excellent compared with physiologic repair. Anatomic repair is the procedure of choice for those patients if both <e>ventricles</e> are adequate or if surgical technique is modified with the help of additional a bidirectional cavopulmonary shunt.",M1
20097623,"Mechanisms for initiation of reentry in acute regional ischemia phase 1B.BACKGROUND: During phase 1B of acute regional ischemia, the subepicardial and subendocardial layers coupled to the inexcitable midmyocardium remain viable. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to examine how the degree of hyperkalemia in the surviving layers, the lateral width of border zone between the normal tissue and the central ischemic zone, and the degree of cellular uncoupling between the surviving layers and the midmyocardium contribute to initiation of reentry. METHODS: Simulations were conducted on the state-of-the-art model of rabbit <e>ventricles</e> with realistic representation of the spatial distribution of the ischemic insult. RESULTS: Hyperkalemia in the surviving layers led to induction of reentry by increasing refractoriness and slowing conduction in the layers. Such reentries were formed solely in the subepicardium. A minimal level of hyperkalemia was required for induction of reentry. Progress increase in hyperkalemia led to a biphasic change in vulnerability to reentry. For each level of hyperkalemia, increased cellular uncoupling between subepicardium and midmyocardium increased inducibility of reentry by restoring subepicardial tissue excitability via blocking midmyocardial electrotonic effect. In addition, increased lateral width of the border zone prevented inducibility of reentry as conduction block occurred in the central ischemic zone when the wave propagated across the border zone from the normal zone. CONCLUSION: The degree of hyperkalemia in the surviving subepicardium, the lateral width of border zone, and cellular uncoupling between the subepicardium and midmyocardium determine dispersion of refractoriness, conduction velocity, excitability, and, therefore, inducibility of reentry during phase 1B.",M1

The regional and differential distribution of gene expression patterns is critical not only for heart development, but, also in the establishment of cardiac hypertrophy phenotypes. the cells of the myocardium employ elaborate regulatory mechanisms to establish changes in chromatin structure and function, yet, the role of epigenetic modifications and specific gene expression patterns in cardiac ventricles remains poorly understood. We have examined gene expression changes and studied histone H3 and H4 acetylation as well as dimethylation of lysine 4 on histone H3 on promoters of alpha-Myosin heavy chain gene (alpha-MHC), beta-Myosin heavy chain gene (beta-MHC), Atrial natriuretic peptide gene (ANp), B-type natriuretic peptide gene (BNP) and Sarcoplasmic reticulum Ca(2+) ATPase gene (SERCA2a). The recruitment of histone acetyltransferase (HAT) enzyme p300, which is a transcriptional coactivator, was also studied on the hyperacetylated promoters using immunopurification of soluble chromatin in the left and right ventricles of the mouse. We present evidence for the first time that the pattern of gene expression is closely linked with histone modifications and propose the left and right chambers of the heart are epigenetically distinguishable.",M1
20082877,"Extracellular matrix metalloproteinase inducer (EMMPRIN) is increased in human left ventricle after acute myocardial infarction.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Elevated activities of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) following acute myocardial infarction (AMI) have been shown to mediate ventricular remodeling. The extracellular MMP inducer (EMMPRIN) plays a key regulatory role for MMP activities. The aim of this study was to evaluate changes of EMMPRIN, MMP-2 and MMP-9 and determine the correlation between EMMPRIN expression and MMPs in human left ventricle after AMI. METHODS: Immunohistochemistry for MMP-2, MMP-9 and EMMPRIN were performed postmortem in 15 human left <e>ventricles</e> including 10 patients with AMI and five normal subjects who were accident victims. Western blot was used to determine protein levels of MMP-2, MMP-9 and EMMPRIN. The correlation between EMMPRIN expression and MMPs was determined by linear regression. RESULTS: Our results showed that there was slight EMMPRIN expression on the membranes of normal cardiac myocytes, whereas its expression strongly increased around the zone of necrosis in the AMI group. Compared with the control group, EMMPRIN (1.10+/-0.17 vs. 0.25+/-0.04, p&lt;0.001), MMP-2 (0.25+/-0.03 vs. 0.64+/-0.11, p&lt;0.001) and MMP-9 (0.16+/-0.03 vs. 0.39+/-0.07, p&lt;0.001) protein levels were significantly increased in the AMI group. The expression of MMP-2 (r(2)=0.82, p&lt;0.001), and MMP-9 (r(2)=0.424, p=0.041) were correlated with EMMPRIN expression in AMI patients. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate for the first time that EMMPRIN expression increases in the human left ventricle after AMI. As one of the upregulators of local MMP expression, augmented expression of EMMPRIN may play a critical role in ventricular remodeling in AMI subjects.",M1
20061548,"Year-long upregulation of connexin43 in rabbit hearts by heavy ion irradiation.A previous study from our laboratory has shown that a single targeted heavy ion irradiation (THIR; 15 Gy) to rabbit hearts increases connexin43 (Cx43) expression for 2 wk in association with an improvement of conduction, a decrease of the spatial inhomogeneity of repolarization, and a reduction of vulnerability to ventricular arrhythmias after myocardial infarction. This study investigated the time- and dose-dependent effects of THIR (5-15 Gy) on Cx43 expression in normal rabbit hearts (n = 45). Five rabbits without THIR were used as controls. A significant upregulation of Cx43 protein and mRNA in the ventricular myocardium was recognized by immunohistochemistry, Western blotting, and real-time PCR from 2 wk up to 1 yr after a single THIR at 15 Gy. THIR &gt; or =10 Gy caused a significant dose-dependent increase of Cx43 protein and mRNA 2 wk after THIR. Anterior, lateral, and posterior free wall of the left ventricle, interventricular septum, and right ventricular free wall were affected similarly by THIR in terms of Cx43 upregulation. The radiation-induced increase of immunolabeled Cx43 was observed not only at the intercalated disk region but also at the lateral surface of ventricular myocytes. The increase of immunoreactive Cx43 protein was predominant in the membrane fraction insoluble in Triton X-100, that is the Cx43 in the sarcolemma. In vivo examinations of the rabbits 1 yr after THIR (15 Gy) revealed no significant changes in ECGs and echocardiograms (left ventricular dimensions, contractility, and diastolic function), indicating no apparent late radiation injury. A single application of THIR causes upregulation and altered cellular distribution of Cx43 in the <e>ventricles</e> lasting for at least 1 yr. This long-lasting remodeling effect on gap junctions may open the pathway to novel therapy against life threatening ventricular arrhythmias in structural heart disease.",M1
20053442,"The performance of photooxidatively crosslinked acellular bovine jugular vein conduits in the reconstruction of connections between pulmonary arteries and right <e>ventricles</e>.In this study, valved photooxidatively crosslinked acellular bovine jugular vein conduits (BJVCs) were implanted in young dogs to reconstruct the connections of pulmonary arteries and right ventricles, with acellular conduits used as controls. All acellular conduits had moderate to severe valvular dysfunction and were explanted at 1-month implantation (n = 5). Histological examination showed inflammatory cell infiltration and intimal hyperplasia in the walls, and severe inflammatory cell infiltration and thrombosis in the valves. The photooxidatively crosslinked acellular conduits were retrieved at 1-month (n = 5) and 6-month (n = 5) implantations respectively. These conduits had excellent valvular function at retrieval. Their walls and valves were still soft and smooth without calcification and hemangioma. Endothelialization in valves and luminal walls was unsatisfied at 1-month retrieval, and was improved at 6-month retrieval. Host cells infiltrated and migrated from outer layer to the middle layer, with tissue remolding and regeneration found in these recellular regions. Histological examination and tissue content assay demonstrated that degeneration and regeneration of collagens and glycosaminoglycans were comparable, but elastic fibers gradually degraded. Photooxidatively crosslinked acellular BJVCs resist calcification and thrombosis and have regeneration patterns, with excellent hemodynamic performance.",M1
20051627,"Heart failure causes cholinergic transdifferentiation of cardiac sympathetic nerves via gp130-signaling cytokines in rodents.Although several cytokines and neurotrophic factors induce sympathetic neurons to transdifferentiate into cholinergic neurons in vitro, the physiological and pathophysiological roles of this remain unknown. During congestive heart failure (CHF), sympathetic neural tone is upregulated, but there is a paradoxical reduction in norepinephrine synthesis and reuptake in the cardiac sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Here we examined whether cholinergic transdifferentiation can occur in the cardiac SNS in rodent models of CHF and investigated the underlying molecular mechanism(s) using genetically modified mice. We used Dahl salt-sensitive rats to model CHF and found that, upon CHF induction, the cardiac SNS clearly acquired cholinergic characteristics. Of the various cholinergic differentiation factors, leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and cardiotrophin-1 were strongly upregulated in the <e>ventricles</e> of rats with CHF. Further, LIF and cardiotrophin-1 secreted from cultured failing rat cardiomyocytes induced cholinergic transdifferentiation in cultured sympathetic neurons, and this process was reversed by siRNAs targeting Lif and cardiotrophin-1. Consistent with the data in rats, heart-specific overexpression of LIF in mice caused cholinergic transdifferentiation in the cardiac SNS. Further, SNS-specific targeting of the gene encoding the gp130 subunit of the receptor for LIF and cardiotrophin-1 in mice prevented CHF-induced cholinergic transdifferentiation. Cholinergic transdifferentiation was also observed in the cardiac SNS of autopsied patients with CHF. Thus, CHF causes target-dependent cholinergic transdifferentiation of the cardiac SNS via gp130-signaling cytokines secreted from the failing myocardium.",M1
20027579,"Measuring the heart in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH): implications for trial study size.PURPOSE: To calculate the sample size for a theoretical pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) randomized controlled trial (RCT) by using cardiovascular magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging to determine the repeatability of measures between two scans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two same-day examinations from 10 PAH patients were analyzed manually and semiautomatically. Study size was calculated from the standard deviation (SD) of repeatability. Different approaches to right-ventricle (RV) mass were investigated, agreement between methods tested and interobserver reproducibility measured by Bland-Altman analysis to explore how the PAH heart might be best measured. RESULTS: Repeatability was good for almost all manually-measured indices but poor for semiautomated measurement of RV mass and left-ventricle (LV) end-diastolic volume (EDV). Thus, for an RCT (power, 80%; significance level, 5%) analyzing  outcome  indices (RVEDV, LVEDV, RV ejection fraction, and RV mass; anticipated change: 10 mL, 10 mL, 3%, and 10 g, respectively) manually, 34 patients are required compared to 78 if analysis is semiautomated. RV mass was repeatable if the interventricular septum was divided between <e>ventricles</e> or if wholly apportioned to the LV. Limits of agreement between manual and semiautomated analyses were unsatisfactory for RV measures and interobserver reproducibility was worse for semiautomated than manual analysis. CONCLUSION: Manual is more robust than semiautomated analysis and at present should be favored in RCTs in PAH as it leads to lower sample size requirements.",M1
20025864,"Genetic fate mapping demonstrates contribution of epicardium-derived cells to the annulus fibrosis of the mammalian heart.The annulus fibrosis electrically insulates the atria and <e>ventricles</e>, allowing the timed sequential beating of these structures that is necessary for efficient heart function. Abnormal development of the annulus fibrosis leads to persistence of accessory electrical pathways from atria to ventricles, providing the anatomical substrate for re-entrant cardiac arrhythmias such as Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome. To better understand the development of the annulus fibrosis and the etiology of these cardiac arrhythmias, we used Cre-LoxP technology to assess the contribution of epicardium derived cells (EPDCs) to the annulus fibrosis. We found that EPDCs migrated into the region of the forming annulus fibrosis, marked by the protein periostin. These EPDCs also stained positive for procollagen I, suggesting that the EPDCs themselves synthesize proteins of the annulus fibrosis. To further test the hypothesis that EPDCs contribute to cells that synthesize the annulus fibrosis, we purified genetically marked EPDCs from the atrioventricular region and measured gene expression by quantitative PCR. These EPDCs were highly enriched for mRNAs encoding periostin, procollagen I, fibronectin I, vimentin, discoidin domain receptor 2, and tenascin C, markers of fibroblasts and components of the annulus fibrosis. In addition, these EPDCs were highly enriched for Snail, Smad1, Slug, and Twist1, markers for epithelial-to-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and a metalloprotease, Mmp2, that contributes to cellular migration. Our work provides for the first time definitive evidence that epicardium contributes to formation of the mammalian annulus fibrosis through EMT. Abnormalities of this differentiation process may underlie development of some forms of re-entrant atrioventricular tachycardia.",M1
20018227,"Characterization of spinal afferent neurons projecting to different chambers of the rat heart.The pattern of distribution of spinal afferent neurons (among dorsal root ganglia-DRGs) that project to anatomically and functionally different chambers of the rat heart, as well as their morphological and neurochemical characteristics were investigated. Retrograde tracing using a patch loaded with Fast blue (FB) was applied to all four chambers of the rat heart and labeled cardiac spinal afferents were characterized by using three neurochemical markers. The majority of cardiac projecting neurons were found from T1 to T4 DRGs, whereas the peak was at T2 DRG. There was no difference in the total number of FB-labeled neurons located in ipsilateral and contralateral DRGs regardless of the chambers marked with the patch. However, significantly more FB-labeled neurons projected to the <e>ventricles</e> compared to the atria (859 vs. 715). The proportion of isolectin B(4) binding in FB-labeled neurons was equal among all neurons projecting to different heart chambers (2.4%). Neurofilament 200 positivity was found in greater proportions in DRG neurons projecting to the left side of the heart, whereas calretinin-immunoreactivity was mostly represented in neurons projecting to the left atrium. Spinal afferent neurons projecting to different chambers of the rat heart exhibit a variety of neurochemical phenotypes depending on binding capacity for isolectin B(4) and immunoreactivity for neurofilament 200 and calretinin, and thus represent important baseline data for future studies.",M1

19964787,"Decay of postextrasystolic potentiation in the left and right <e>ventricles</e> of intact canine hearts.Intracellular regulation of myocardial Ca2+ has long been of interest to physiologists. The force-interval relationship provides a phenomenological approach that permits insight into aspects of calcium regulation. The response to an extrasystole is a potentiation in contractile force and the recovery in contractile force is described by the recirculation fraction (RF). The RF provides a gross estimation of calcium uptake by sarcoplasmic reticulum (SR), leading to myocardial relaxation. The current study focused on the relationship of right (RV) and left ventricular (LV) RF in canines under several contractile states. Anesthetized canines (n = 5) were catheterized for RV and LV pressure measurements. dP/dt(max) for the RV and LV was calculated for three baseline beats, one extrasystole and the first five postextrasystolic beats. The relationship between the LV dP/dt(max) and RV dP/dt(max) for all of the mentioned beats was then examined. Contractility was increased with calcium chloride and extrasystoles were delivered. Once cardiac function returned to a baseline level, contractility was reduced by increasing the concentration of isoflurane and the evaluation repeated. All ventricular contractions were controlled by RA pacing to maintain intrinsic conduction. A strong linear relationship between RV and LV dP/dt(max) (r = 0.94 +/- .06) existed for most canine's contractile states. These results build on findings in isolated hearts and demonstrate that biventricular response to extrasystoles and subsequent contractile recovery is both linear and correlated, suggesting that intracellular calcium regulation in a given heart across contractile state is static.",M1
19964267,"Computerized optimization of biventricular pacing using body surface potential map.An improvement of biventricular pacing (BVP) could be possible by detecting the patient specific optimal pacemaker parameters. Body surface potential map (BSPM) is used to obtain the electrophysiology and pathology of an individual patient non-invasively. The clinical measurements of BSPM are used to parameterize the computer model of the heart to represent the individual pathology. The computer model of the heart is used to simulate the dyssynchrony of the <e>ventricles</e> and myocardial infarction (MI). Cardiac electrophysiology is simulated with ten Tusscher cell model, while excitation propagation is intended with adaptive cellular automaton at physiological and pathological conduction stages. The optimal electrode configurations are identified by minimizing the QRS duration error of healthy and pathology case with/without pacing between pre and post-implantation. Afterwards, the simulated ECGs for optimal pacing are compared to the post implantation clinically measured ECGs. The optimal electrode positions found by simulation are comparable to the ones meausured in hospital. The QRS duration reduction error between measured and simulated 12 ECG signals are similar with a constant offset of 15 ms. The personalized model present in this research is an effective tool for therapy planning of BVP in patients with congestive heart failure.",M1
19964050,"The influence of left-ventricular shape on end-diastolic fiber stress and strain.Passive filling is a major determinant for the pump performance of the left ventricle and is determined by the filling pressure and the ventricular compliance.

Hereto, fiber stress and strain were calculated in a finite element analysis during the inflation of left <e>ventricles</e> of different shape, ranging from an elongated ellipsoid to a sphere, but keeping the initial cavity and wall volume constant. The passive myocardium was described by an incompressible hyperelastic material law with transverse isotropic symmetry along the muscle fiber directions.

While compliance was not altered, the transmural distribution of both passive fiber stress and strain was highly dependent on ventricular shape, where more spherical ventricles exhibited a higher subendocardial gradient in both quantities.",M1
19942786,"Diagnosis-based differences in response of global ventricular performance to modified ultrafiltration in children.BACKGROUND: To determine diagnosis-based differences in the response of global ventricular performance to modified ultrafiltration (MUF) using transesophageal echocardiography during congenital heart surgery. METHODS AND RESULTS: The study included 38 children with atrial septal defect (n=10), ventricular septal defect (VSD) (n=8), tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) (n=9), or a single ventricle (n=11). Arteriovenous MUF was performed for 10-15 min after cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB). The myocardial performance index (MPI) of the systemic <e>ventricles</e> and the % change in MPI before and after MUF were assessed. Impairment of MPI was noted at termination of CPB compared with baseline values in the VSD and TOF groups (P&lt;0.05). MUF resulted in an improvement in MPI in all groups (P&lt;0.01). There was a weak correlation between aortic cross-clamping or CPB time, and the degree of improvement in MPI (r= 0.385, P=0.019; r= 0.348, P=0.037, respectively). MUF improved fractional shortening in all groups (P&lt;0.05) and reversed abnormal relaxation in the VSD and TOF groups. CONCLUSIONS: Modified ultrafiltration ameliorated MPI in all groups, indicating improved systemic ventricular function with MUF. The MPI recovery rate differed among the groups. MUF may be particularly useful for restoring the global ventricular performance of patients undergoing longer CPB and may have minimal advantages for simple open-heart surgery.

19936587,"Does biventricular pacing improve hemodynamics in children undergoing routine congenital heart surgery?Biventricular (BiV) pacing or cardiac resynchronization therapy (CRT) is an established therapy for heart failure in adults. In children, cardiac dyssynchrony occurs most commonly following repair of congenital heart disease (CHD) where multisite pacing has been shown to improve both hemodynamics and ventricular function. Determining which patient types would specifically benefit has not yet been established. A prospective, repeated measures design was undertaken to evaluate BiV pacing in a cohort of children undergoing biventricular repair for correction of their CHD. Hemodynamics, arterial blood gas, electrocardiographic (ECG), and echocardiographic data were collected. Pacing protocol was undertaken prior to the patient's extubation with 20 min of conventional right ventricular (RV) or BiV pacing, preceded and followed by 10 min of recovery time. Multivariate statistics were used to analyze the data with p values &lt;0.05 considered significant. Twenty-five (14 female) patients underwent surgery at a median (range) age of 5.2 (0.1-37.4) months with no early mortality. The Risk-adjusted classification for Congenital Heart Surgery (RACHS) scores were 2 in 14 patients, 3 in eight patients, and 4 in three patients. None had pre-existing arrhythmias, dyssynchrony, or required pacing pre-operatively. No patient required implantation of a permanent pacemaker post-operatively. The median cardio-pulmonary bypass time was 96 (55-236) min. RV and BiV pacing did not improve cardiac index from baseline (3.23 vs. 3.42 vs. 3.39 L/min/m2; p &gt; 0.05). The QRS duration was not changed with pacing (100 vs. 80 vs. 80 ms; p &gt; 0.05). On echocardiography, the time-to-peak velocity difference between the septal and posterior walls (synchrony) during pacing was similar to baseline and was also not statistically significant. BiV pacing did not improve cardiac output when compared to intrinsic sinus rhythm or RV pacing in this cohort of patients. Our study has shown that BiV pacing is not indicated in children who have undergone routine BiV congenital heart surgery. Further prospective studies are needed to assess the role of multisite pacing in children with ventricular dyssynchrony such as those with single <e>ventricles</e>, those undergoing reoperation or those with high RACHS scores.",M1
19933417,"Development of an anatomically detailed MRI-derived rabbit ventricular model and assessment of its impact on simulations of electrophysiological function.Recent advances in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging technology have unveiled a wealth of information regarding cardiac histoanatomical complexity. However, methods to faithfully translate this level of fine-scale structural detail into computational whole ventricular models are still in their infancy, and, thus, the relevance of this additional complexity for simulations of cardiac function has yet to be elucidated. Here, we describe the development of a highly detailed finite-element computational model (resolution: approximately 125 microm) of rabbit <e>ventricles</e> constructed from high-resolution MR data (raw data resolution: 43 x 43 x 36 microm), including the processes of segmentation (using a combination of level-set approaches), identification of relevant anatomical features, mesh generation, and myocyte orientation representation (using a rule-based approach). Full access is provided to the completed model and MR data. Simulation results were compared with those from a simplified model built from the same images but excluding finer anatomical features (vessels/endocardial structures). Initial simulations showed that the presence of trabeculations can provide shortcut paths for excitation, causing regional differences in activation after pacing between models. Endocardial structures gave rise to small-scale virtual electrodes upon the application of external field stimulation, which appeared to protect parts of the endocardium in the complex model from strong polarizations, whereas intramural virtual electrodes caused by blood vessels and extracellular cleft spaces appeared to reduce polarization of the epicardium. Postshock, these differences resulted in the genesis of new excitation wavefronts that were not observed in more simplified models. Furthermore, global differences in the stimulus recovery rates of apex/base regions were observed, causing differences in the ensuing arrhythmogenic episodes. In conclusion, structurally simplified models are well suited for a large range of cardiac modeling applications. However, important differences are seen when behavior at microscales is relevant, particularly when examining the effects of external electrical stimulation on tissue electrophysiology and arrhythmia induction. This highlights the utility of histoanatomically detailed models for investigations of cardiac function, in particular for future patient-specific modeling.",M1
19924823,"In vivo imaging of the cyclic changes in cross-sectional shape of the ventricular segment of pulsating embryonic chick hearts at stages 14 to 17: a contribution to the understanding of the ontogenesis of cardiac pumping function.The cardiac cycle-related deformations of tubular embryonic hearts were traditionally described as concentric narrowing and widening of a tube of circular cross-section. Using optical coherence tomography (OCT), we have recently shown that, during the cardiac cycle, only the myocardial tube undergoes concentric narrowing and widening while the endocardial tube undergoes eccentric narrowing and widening, having an elliptic cross-section at end-diastole and a slit-shaped cross-section at end-systole. Due to technical limitations, these analyses were confined to early stages of ventricular development (chick embryos, stages 10-13). Using a modified OCT-system, we now document, for the first time, the cyclic changes in cross-sectional shape of beating embryonic <e>ventricles</e> at stages 14 to 17. We show that during these stages (1) a large area of diminished cardiac jelly appears at the outer curvature of the ventricular region associated with formation of endocardial pouches; (2) the ventricular endocardial lumen acquires a bell-shaped cross-section at end-diastole and becomes compressed like a fireplace bellows during systole; (3) the contracting portions of the embryonic ventricles display stretching along its baso-apical axis at end-systole. The functional significance of our data is discussed with respect to early cardiac pumping function.",M1
19908161,"Signal density of left ventricular myocardial segments and impact of beam hardening artifact: implications for myocardial perfusion assessment by multidetector CT coronary angiography.We sought to explore the normal myocardial signal density (SD) levels during multidetector computed tomography coronary angiography (MDCT-CA) acquisitions and evaluated the impact of beam hardening artifacts. Background: Since myocardial perfusion by MDCT is based on the myocardial signal density (SD), it is pivotal to determine the normal values of myocardial SD and to identify potential mechanisms of misinterpretation of perfusion defects. In routine MDCT acquisitions, we commonly visualize a considerable SD drop at the posterobasal wall resembling perfusion defects, being attributed to beam hardening artifacts. Consecutive asymptomatic patients without history of coronary artery disease (CAD) and low probability of CAD who were referred for MDCT evaluation at our institution due to inconclusive or discordant functional tests constituted the study population. Perfusion defects were defined as a myocardial segment having a SD two standard deviations below the average myocardial SD for the 16 left ventricular American Heart Association (AHA) segments. Thirty six asymptomatic patients constituted the study population. Myocardial SD was evaluated in 576 American Heart Association (AHA) segments and 36 posterobasal segments. The mean myocardial SD at the posterobasal segment was 53.5 +/- 35.1 HU, whereas the mean myocardial SD at the basal, mid and apical myocardium was 97.4 +/- 17.3, with significant differences (p &lt; 0.001) between posterobasal and all AHA segments. Posterobasal  perfusion defects  were identified in 26 (72%) patients. The only variable associated to the presence of posterobasal SD deficit was the heart rate (61.8 +/- 6.2 bpm vs. 56.3 +/- 8.1 bpm, p = 0.04), whereas body mass index, blood SD of the left and right <e>ventricles</e>, contrast-to-noise ratio, and the extent of atherosclerosis were not related to the presence of  perfusion defects . In an asymptomatic population with no history of coronary artery disease, a myocardial signal density deficit mimicking a perfusion defect is a common finding in the posterobasal wall and is not related to body mass index or scan quality.",M1
19893021,"Origin of cardiac fibroblasts and the role of periostin.Cardiac fibroblasts are the most populous nonmyocyte cell type within the mature heart and are required for extracellular matrix synthesis and deposition, generation of the cardiac skeleton, and to electrically insulate the atria from the <e>ventricles</e>. Significantly, cardiac fibroblasts have also been shown to play an important role in cardiomyocyte growth and expansion of the ventricular chambers during heart development. Although there are currently no cardiac fibroblast-restricted molecular markers, it is generally envisaged that the majority of the cardiac fibroblasts are derived from the proepicardium via epithelial-to-mesenchymal transformation. However, still relatively little is known about when and where the cardiac fibroblasts cells are generated, the lineage of each cell, and how cardiac fibroblasts move to reside in their final position throughout all four cardiac chambers. In this review, we summarize the present understanding regarding the function of Periostin, a useful marker of the noncardiomyocyte lineages, and its role during cardiac morphogenesis. Characterization of the cardiac fibroblast lineage and identification of the signals that maintain, expand and regulate their differentiation will be required to improve our understanding of cardiac function in both normal and pathophysiological states.",M1
19892017,"Enhanced ROS production by NADPH oxidase is correlated to changes in antioxidant enzyme activity in human heart failure.In pathological conditions, the balance between reactive oxygen species (ROS) and antioxidants may shift toward a relative increase of ROS, resulting in oxidative stress. Conflicting data are available on antioxidant defenses in human failing heart and they are limited to the left ventricle. Thus, we aimed to investigate and compare the source of oxidant and antioxidant enzyme activities in the right (RV) and left (LV) <e>ventricles</e> of human failing hearts. We found a significant increase in superoxide production only by NADPH oxidase in both failing ventricles, more marked in RV. Despite unchanged mRNA or protein expression, catalase (CAT) and glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activities were increased, and their increases reflected the levels of Tyr phosphorylation of the respective enzyme. Manganese superoxide dismutase (Mn-SOD) activity appeared unchanged. The increase in NADPH oxidase-dependent superoxide production positively correlated with the activation of both CAT and GPx. However, the slope of the linear correlation (m) was steeper in LV than in RV for GPx (LV: m=2.416; RV: m=1.485) and CAT (LV: m=1.007; RV: m=0.354). Accordingly, malondialdehyde levels, an indirect index of oxidative stress, were significantly higher in the RV than LV. We conclude that in human failing RV and LV, oxidative stress is associated with activation of antioxidant enzyme activity. This activation is likely due to post-translational modifications and more evident in LV. Overall, these findings suggest a reduced protection of RV against oxidative stress and its potential contribution to the progression toward overt heart failure.",M1
19876642,"Evidence of increased electro-mechanical delay in the left and right ventricle after prolonged exercise.We assessed the time delay from the onset of QRS (Q) to peak systolic (S') and diastolic (E') tissue velocities in the left (LV) and right ventricle (RV) before and after prolonged exercise. Nineteen well-trained runners (mean +/- SD age, 41 +/- 9 years) had tissue-Doppler echocardiography performed before and after an 89 km ultra-marathon race. Longitudinal tissue motion was analysed in LV basal and mid-wall segments and RV free wall. Electromechanical coupling was assessed by the delay between Q and S' as well as E' tissue velocities. Average data for all segments were adjusted for the R-R interval. Comparisons were made by paired t-tests. An increase in electro-mechanical delay (EMD) was reported post-exercise in systole (Q-S' LV: 131 +/- 20 vs. 175 +/- 27 ms; RV: 171 +/- 34 vs. 258 +/- 35 ms; P &lt; 0.05) and diastole (Q-E' LV: 486 +/- 51 vs. 647 +/- 44 ms; RV: 500 +/- 80 vs. 690 +/- 75 ms; P &lt; 0.05). Further, post-race peak tissue velocities in basal LV and RV wall segments were reduced (P &lt; 0.05). Recovery from prolonged running was associated with an increased  EMD , and reduced peak tissue velocities, in both <e>ventricles</e>.",M1
19856080,"Phospholipase Cbeta4 isozyme is expressed in human, rat, and murine heart left <e>ventricles</e> and in HL-1 cardiomyocytes.Phospholipase C-beta (PLCbeta) isozymes (PLCbeta(1) and PLCbeta(3)) have been extensively characterized in cardiac tissue, but no data are available for the PLCbeta(4) isozyme. In this study, PLCbeta((1-4)) isozymes mRNA relative expression was studied by real-time PCR (RT-PCR) in human, rat, and murine left ventricle and the presence of PLCbeta(4) isozyme at the protein level was confirmed by Western blotting in all species studied. Confocal microscopy experiments carried out in HL-1 cardiomyocytes revealed a sarcoplasmic subcellular distribution of PLCbeta(4). Although there were unexpected significant interspecies differences in the PLCbeta((1-4)) mRNA expression, PLCbeta(4) mRNA was the main transcript expressed in all left ventricles studied. Thus, whereas in human and rat left ventricles PLCbeta(4) &gt; PLCbeta(3) &gt; PLCbeta(2) &gt; PLCbeta(1) mRNA pattern of expression was found, in murine left ventricle the pattern of expression was different, i.e., PLCbeta(4) &gt; PLCbeta(1) &gt; PLCbeta(3) &gt; PLCbeta(2). However, results obtained in mouse HL-1 cardiomyocytes showed PLCbeta(3) approximately PLCbeta(4) &gt; PLCbeta(1) &gt; PLCbeta(2) pattern of mRNA expression indicating a probable cell type specific expression of the different PLCbeta isozymes in cardiomyocytes. Finally, RT-PCR experiments showed a trend, even though not significant (P = 0.067), to increase PLCbeta(4) mRNA levels in HL-1 cardiomyocytes after angiotensin II treatment. These results demonstrate the presence of PLCbeta(4) in the heart and in HL-1 cardiomyocytes showing a different species-dependent pattern of expression of the PLCbeta((1-4)) transcripts. We discuss the relevance of these findings in relation to the development of cardiac hypertrophy.",M1
19840575,"Postnatal angiographic appearance of left ventricular myocardium in fetal patients with aortic stenosis having in-utero aortic valvuloplasty.Fetal aortic valvuloplasty (FAV) is performed on the basis of the hypothesis that aortic stenosis leads to the impairment of left ventricular (LV) filling and growth. Given that most fetuses fail to exhibit normalization of LV growth even after successful FAV, better understanding of the associated LV myocardial pathology is indicated. Postnatal angiography was reviewed retrospectively for all patients who (1) underwent FAV for severe aortic stenosis and (2) had well-opacified LV angiograms before any surgical intervention from 2000 to 2007. The angiographic appearance of the LV myocardium was described as either smooth or trabeculated in a total of 6 anatomic segments in 2 projections (anteroposterior and lateral). Twenty-four infants who underwent FAV had angiographic images appropriate for review. Of these, 4 (17%) had uniformly smooth LV myocardium, whereas 20 (83%) had deep trabeculations of &gt; or =1 LV myocardial segment. Half of the infants (n = 13) had extensive trabeculations with the involvement of &gt; or =4 segments. In all cases, the septal segments were smooth. In conclusion, patients after FAV have angiographically abnormal left <e>ventricles</e>, commonly involving extensive trabeculations of the free wall, but without septal involvement.",M1
19837897,"Surgical removal of right-to-left cardiac shunt in the American alligator (Alligator mississippiensis) causes ventricular enlargement but does not alter apnoea or metabolism during diving.Crocodilians have complete anatomical separation between the <e>ventricles</e>, similar to birds and mammals, but retain the dual aortic arch system found in all non-avian reptiles. This cardiac anatomy allows surgical modification that prevents right-to-left (R-L) cardiac shunt. A R-L shunt is a bypass of the pulmonary circulation and recirculation of oxygen-poor blood back to the systemic circulation and has often been observed during the frequent apnoeic periods of non-avian reptiles, particularly during diving in aquatic species. We eliminated R-L shunt in American alligators (Alligator mississippiensis) by surgically occluding the left aorta (LAo; arising from right ventricle) upstream and downstream of the foramen of Panizza (FoP), and we tested the hypotheses that this removal of R-L shunt would cause afterload-induced cardiac remodelling and adversely affect diving performance. Occlusion of the LAo both upstream and downstream of the FoP for approximately 21 months caused a doubling of RV pressure and significant ventricular enlargement (average approximately 65%) compared with age-matched, sham-operated animals. In a separate group of recovered, surgically altered alligators allowed to dive freely in a dive chamber at 23 degrees C, occlusion of the LAo did not alter oxygen consumption or voluntary apnoeic periods relative to sham animals. While surgical removal of R-L shunt causes considerable changes in cardiac morphology similar to aortic banding in mammals, its removal does not affect the respiratory pattern or metabolism of alligators. It appears probable that the low metabolic rate of reptiles, rather than pulmonary circulatory bypass, allows for normal aerobic dives.",M1

19828226,"Feasibility of left ventricular shape analysis from transthoracic real-time 3-D echocardiographic images.Despite the potential ability of left ventricular (LV) shape analysis to provide independent information complementary to ventricular size and function, in clinical practice only ejection fraction (EF) is currently assessed while LV shape is not routinely quantified. Moreover, geometric assumptions in the computation of EF from multiple two-dimensional (2-D) cut-planes by disc summation or area-length methods, introduce inaccuracies in the estimates. Also, previous approaches for the quantification of LV shape were based on geometric modeling and, as a result, proved inaccurate. Our aims were (1) to develop and test a three-dimensional (3-D) technique for direct quantification of LV shape from real-time 3-D echocardiographic (RT3DE) images without the need for geometric modeling using a new class of LV shape indices; and (2) to study the relationship between these indices and ventricular size and function in normal and abnormal <e>ventricles</e>. Spherical (S), ellipsoidal (E) and conical (C) shape indices were calculated using custom software for analysis of transthoracic RT3DE images on both global and regional levels and initially tested on computer simulated objects of different shapes. The feasibility of using these indices to differentiate between normal and abnormal ventricles was tested in three groups of patients: normal volunteers (NL, n=9), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM, n=9) and coronary artery disease with apical regional wall motion abnormalities (RWMA, n=9). Computer simulation demonstrated that these shape indices are size-independent and can correctly classify the simulated objects. In human ventricles, both S and C but not E correlated well with LV volumes and EF. Also, S and C changed throughout the cardiac cycle while E remained almost constant. In addition, both regional and global S and C were able to identify differences between NL and abnormal ventricles: normal ventricles were less spherical and more conical than those of patients with DCM at both end-systole and end-diastole (p&lt;0.05) both globally and regionally. In contrast, in patients with RWMA, similar differences were noted only at end-systole, both on a global level and in the apical region. In this study, we demonstrated the feasibility of quantifying LV shape from transthoracic RT3DE images at both global and regional levels. Potentially, such 3-D shape analysis could be combined with conventional evaluation of LV volume and function to provide a more comprehensive assessment of left ventricular performance.",M1
19818405,"Specific inhibition of HCN channels slows rhythm differently in atria, ventricle and outflow tract and stabilizes conduction in the anoxic-reoxygenated embryonic heart model.The hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated (HCN) channels are expressed in pacemaker cells very early during cardiogenesis. This work aimed at determining to what extent these channels are implicated in the electromechanical disturbances induced by a transient oxygen lack which may occur in utero. Spontaneously beating hearts or isolated <e>ventricles</e> and outflow tracts dissected from 4-day-old chick embryos were exposed to a selective inhibitor of HCN channels (ivabradine 0.1-10microM) to establish a dose-response relationship. The effects of ivabradine on electrocardiogram, excitation-contraction coupling and contractility of hearts submitted to anoxia (30min) and reoxygenation (60min) were also determined. The distribution of the predominant channel isoform, HCN4, was established in atria, ventricle and outflow tract by immunoblotting. Intrinsic beating rate of atria, ventricle and outflow tract was 164+/-22 (n=10), 78+/-24 (n=8) and 40+/-12bpm (n=23, mean+/-SD), respectively. In the whole heart, ivabradine (0.3microM) slowed the firing rate of atria by 16% and stabilized PR interval. These effects persisted throughout anoxia-reoxygenation, whereas the variations of QT duration, excitation-contraction coupling and contractility, as well as the types and duration of arrhythmias were not altered. Ivabradine (10microM) reduced the intrinsic rate of atria and isolated ventricle by 27% and 52%, respectively, whereas it abolished activity of the isolated outflow tract. Protein expression of HCN4 channels was higher in atria and ventricle than in the outflow tract. Thus, HCN channels are specifically distributed and control finely atrial, ventricular and outflow tract pacemakers as well as conduction in the embryonic heart under normoxia and throughout anoxia-reoxygenation.",M1
19812120,"Cardiac biomarkers in a model of acute catecholamine cardiotoxicity.Coronary heart disease and in particular its most serious form - acute myocardial infarction (AMI) - represents the most common cause of mortality in developed countries. Better prognosis may be achieved by understanding the etiopathogenetic mechanisms of AMI. Therefore, a catecholamine model of myocardial injury, which has appeared to be very similar to AMI in human in some aspect, was used. Male Wistar:Han rats were randomly divided into two groups: control group (saline) and isoprenaline group (ISO; synthetic catecholamine, 100 mg.kg(- 1) subcutaneously [s.c.]). After 24 hours, functional parameters were measured, biochemical markers in the blood and metals content in the heart tissue were analysed and histological examination was performed. ISO caused marked myocardial injury that was associated with myocardial calcium overload. Close correlation between myocardial impairment (i.e. serum TnT, stroke volume index and wet <e>ventricles</e> weight) and the levels of myocardial calcium was observed. Direct reactive oxygen species (ROS) involvement was documented only by non-significant increase in malonyldialdehyde 24 hours after ISO injury. Moreover, myocardial element analysis revealed no significant changes as for the content of zinc and iron while selenium and copper increased in the ISO group although it reached statistical significance only for the latter.",M1
19808501,"Simultaneous biventricular noncontact mapping and ablation of septal ventricular tachycardia in a chronic ovine infarct model.BACKGROUND: We assessed a novel simultaneous biventricular mapping and ablation approach for septal ventricular tachycardia (VT) in a chronic ovine infarct model. METHODS AND RESULTS: In 8 sheep with inducible VT, mapping and ablation were performed 9+/-3 months after percutaneously induced myocardial infarction, with left ventricular ejection fraction 23+/-8%. Scar was identified by EnSite Dynamic Substrate Mapping plus CARTO voltage mapping. Thirty VT episodes (cycle length, 235+/-42 ms) were mapped with simultaneous analyses using EnSite arrays deployed in both the left ventricle and the right ventricle. Short ablation lines were created perpendicular to the breakout pathway along the scar border in the ventricle with earliest activity. If septal VT was still inducible, this line was extended before ablation in the second chamber. The end point of noninducibility of VT was achieved in all animals. The mean difference in delay in noncontact breakout timing between the <e>ventricles</e> was shorter for VT with (n=18) than without (n=12) septal breakout (32+/-7.8 ms, P&lt;0.001). In 5 of 6 animals, after ablation in one ventricle, septal VT was still inducible with a common breakout site in the second ventricle. After septal ablation in the second ventricle, VT was no longer inducible. In the 6 animals in which septal VT had been ablated, transmural septal ablation was identified at the scar border, with overlapping left ventricular and right ventricular ablation lesions present in 5 of 6 (septal thickness 8 to 17 mm) and left ventricular endocardial ablation being transmural in 1 of 6 (6 mm). CONCLUSIONS: Biventricular scar and VT activation mapping correctly localizes septal VT pathways, directing ablation from one or both septal endocardial aspects. Creation of a transmural septal lesion at the scar border interrupting VT exit points is highly effective at ablating septal VT.",M1
19795347,"Supplementation of University of Wisconsin solution with Nitroglycerin and Nicorandil in long-term myocardial preservation: effects on the oxidative state, endothelial function and morphology.The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of the addition of Nitroglycerin or Nicorandil to University of Wisconsin solution in long-term myocardial preservation. In a model of heterotopic heart transplantation in pigs, the donor heart was preserved for 24 hours by means of continuous perfusion in this solution, in the presence or absence of these drugs. During this period, the oxygenation and pH of the solution were measured, as were lactate concentrations and enzyme release. At regular intervals following reperfusion we measured the concentrations of enzymes, antioxidants, glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase, malondialdehyde, endothelin and nitrite, and, two hours later, samples of both <e>ventricles</e> were taken for a morphological study. In the treated groups there was a higher lactate production during preservation and, during reperfusion, the signs of contracture and the elevation of enzyme levels were more marked than in the untreated groups. In contrast, the glutathione reductase concentrations did not decrease during the first phase of reperfusion and were directly correlated with those of antioxidants, endothelin levels increased less than in the untreated groups and, in the case of nitroglycerin, the nitrite concentration was significantly greater than in the remaining groups. We conclude that nitroglycerin and nicorandil improved the oxidative state and endothelial function and did not produce substantial morphological changes, but increased cell necrosis and contracture, possibly due to the duration of ischemia.",M1
19767530,"Increased susceptibility of aged hearts to ventricular fibrillation during oxidative stress.Oxidative stress with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) readily promotes early afterdepolarizations (EADs) and triggered activity (TA) in isolated rat and rabbit ventricular myocytes. Here we examined the effects of H(2)O(2) on arrhythmias in intact Langendorff rat and rabbit hearts using dual-membrane voltage and intracellular calcium optical mapping and glass microelectrode recordings. Young adult rat (3-5 mo, N = 25) and rabbit (3-5 mo, N = 6) hearts exhibited no arrhythmias when perfused with H(2)O(2) (0.1-2 mM) for up to 3 h. However, in 33 out of 35 (94%) aged (24-26 mo) rat hearts, 0.1 mM H(2)O(2) caused EAD-mediated TA, leading to ventricular tachycardia (VT) and fibrillation (VF). Aged rabbits (life span, 8-12 yr) were not available, but 4 of 10 middle-aged rabbits (3-5 yr) developed EADs, TA, VT, and VF. These arrhythmias were suppressed by the reducing agent N-acetylcysteine (2 mM) and CaMKII inhibitor KN-93 (1 microM) but not by its inactive form (KN-92, 1 microM). There were no significant differences between action potential duration (APD) or APD restitution slope before or after H(2)O(2) in aged or young adult rat hearts. In histological sections, however, trichrome staining revealed that aged rat hearts exhibited extensive fibrosis, ranging from 10-90%; middle-aged rabbit hearts had less fibrosis (5-35%), whereas young adult rat and rabbit hearts had &lt;4% fibrosis. In aged rat hearts, EADs and TA arose most frequently (70%) from the left ventricular base where fibrosis was intermediate ( approximately 30%). Computer simulations in two-dimensional tissue incorporating variable degrees of fibrosis showed that intermediate (but not mild or severe) fibrosis promoted EADs and TA. We conclude that in aged <e>ventricles</e> exposed to oxidative stress, fibrosis facilitates the ability of cellular EADs to emerge and generate TA, VT, and VF at the tissue level.",M1
19760474,"The variable functional effects of the pacing site  in normal and scarred <e>ventricles</e>.BACKGROUND: The pacing site has been shown to influence functional improvement with cardiac resynchronization therapy. We evaluated the effects of the pacing site on left ventricular (LV) function in an animal model. METHODS AND RESULTS: Equilibrium radionuclide angiography was acquired in sinus rhythm (NSR) and with ventricular pacing, from three pacing sites in seven normal and eight infarcted dogs. QRS duration, electrical activation pattern, wall motion, LV ejection fraction (EF), synchrony of ventricular contraction, and mean arterial pressure (MAP), were related to the pacing site and infarct size, during each of 120 episodes. Little changed during pacing in normals. In infarcted dogs, LV wall motion, and synchrony worsened, LVEF and MAP often fell. These changes related to altered activation patterns which were influenced by the pacing site but were not related to infarct size. CONCLUSIONS: Hemodynamic and functional LV changes after infarction were found to vary with the pacing site and associated conduction and synchrony.",M1
19756788,"Sex-dependent gene regulatory networks of the heart rhythm.Expression level, control, and intercoordination of 66 selected heart rhythm determinant (HRD) genes were compared in atria and <e>ventricles</e> of four male and four female adult mice. We found that genes encoding various adrenergic receptors, ankyrins, ion channels and transporters, connexins, cadherins, plakophilins, and other components of the intercalated discs form a complex network that is chamber dependent and differs between the two sexes. In addition, most HRD genes in atria had higher expression in males than in females, while in ventricles, expression levels were mostly higher in females than in males. Moreover, significant chamber differences were observed between the sexes, with higher expression in atria than ventricles for males and higher expression in ventricles than atria for females. We have ranked the selected genes according to their prominence (new concept) within the HRD gene web defined as extent of expression coordination with the other web genes and stability of expression. Interestingly, the prominence hierarchy was substantially different between the two sexes. Taken together, these findings indicate that the organizational principles of the heart rhythm transcriptome are sex dependent, with the newly introduced prominence analysis allowing identification of genes that are pivotal for the sexual dichotomy.",M1
19752188,"Trabeculae carneae as models of the ventricular walls: implications for the delivery of oxygen.Trabeculae carneae are the smallest naturally arising collections of linearly arranged myocytes in the heart. They are the preparation of choice for studies of function of intact myocardium in vitro. In vivo, trabeculae are unique in receiving oxygen from two independent sources: the coronary circulation and the surrounding ventricular blood. Because oxygen partial pressure (PO(2)) in the coronary arterioles is identical in specimens from both <e>ventricles</e>, whereas that of ventricular blood is 2.5-fold higher in the left ventricle than in the right ventricle, trabeculae represent a  natural laboratory  in which to examine the influence of  extravascular  PO(2) on the extent of capillarization of myocardial tissue. We exploit this advantage to test four hypotheses. (1) In trabeculae from either ventricle, a peripheral annulus of cells is devoid of capillaries. (2) Hence, sufficiently small trabeculae from either ventricle are totally devoid of capillaries. (3) The capillary-to-myocyte ratios in specimens from either ventricle are identical to those of their respective walls. (4) Capillary-to-myocyte ratios are comparable in specimens from either ventricle, reflecting equivalent energy demands in vivo, driven by identical contractile frequencies and comparable wall stresses. We applied confocal fluorescent imaging to trabeculae in cross section, subsequently using semi-automated segmentation techniques to distinguish capillaries from myocytes. We quantified the capillary-to-myocyte ratios of trabeculae from both ventricles and compared them to those determined for the ventricular free walls and septum. Quantitative interpretation was furthered by mathematical modeling, using both the classical solution to the diffusion equation for elliptical cross sections, and a novel approach applicable to cross sections of arbitrary shape containing arbitrary disposition of capillaries and non-respiring collagen cords.",M1
19747484,"Adult zebrafish heart as a model for human heart? An electrophysiological study.The zebrafish has recently emerged as an excellent model for studies of heart development and regeneration. The physiology of the zebrafish heart has been suggested to resemble that of the human heart in many aspects, whereas, in contrast to mammals, the zebrafish has a remarkable ability to regenerate after heart injury. Thus, zebrafish have been proposed as a cost-effective model for genetic and pharmacological screens of factors affecting heart function and repair. However, realizing the full potential of the zebrafish heart as a model will require a better understanding of the electrophysiology of the adult zebrafish myocardium. Here, we characterize action potentials (APs) from intact adult atria and <e>ventricles</e> and find that the overall shape of zebrafish APs is similar to that of humans. We show that zebrafish, like most mammals, display functional acetylcholine-activated K(+) channels in the atrium, but not in the ventricle. Furthermore, the zebrafish AP upstroke is dominated by Na(+) channels, L-type Ca(2+) channels contribute to the plateau phase and I(Kr) channels are involved in repolarization. However, despite these similarities between zebrafish and mammalian electrophysiology, we also identified important differences. In particular, zebrafish display a robust T-type Ca(2+) current in both atrial and ventricular cardiomyocytes. Interestingly, in most mammals T-type Ca(2+) channels are only expressed in the developing heart or under pathophysiological conditions, indicating that adult zebrafish cardiomyocytes display a more immature phenotype.",M1

METHODS: Transesophageal echocardiography (TEE) was performed during standard CPR in 34 patients with nontraumatic cardiac arrest (24 males, mean +/- standard deviation [SD] age = 56 +/- 12 years). On the recorded image of TEE, an area of maximal compression (AMC) was identified, and the degree of compression at the AMC and the left ventricular stroke volume was calculated. RESULTS: A significant narrowing of the left ventricular outflow tract (LVOT) or the aorta was noted in all patients, with the degree of compression at the AMC ranging from 19% to 83% (mean +/- SD = 49 +/- 19%). The AMC was found at the aorta in 20 patients (59%) and at the LVOT in 14 patients (41%). A significant narrowing of more than 50% of the diameter at the end of the relaxation phase occurred in 15 patients (44%). On linear regression, the left ventricular stroke volume was correlated with the location of the AMC (R(2) = 0.165, p = 0.017). CONCLUSIONS: The outflow of the left ventricle is affected during standard CPR, resulting in varying degrees of narrowing in the LVOT and/or the aortic root.",M1
19717963,"Left ventricular noncompaction associated with Ebstein's anomaly.Left ventricular (LV) noncompaction is a congenital dysfunction of endomyocardial morphogenesis characterized by excessively prominent trabeculations and deep intratrabecular recesses of the myocardium. Its association with Ebstein's anomaly is very rare. A 13-year-old boy presented to the outpatient clinic for a cardiac evaluation before enrolling in a sports activity. On physical examination, there was a grade 1/6 systolic murmur at the tricuspid valve location. His electrocardiogram was normal. Transthoracic echocardiography revealed numerous large trabeculations and deep intratrabecular recesses at the apex, lateral wall, and the apical part of the interventricular septum. Color flow Doppler examination confirmed the presence of blood flow within the trabeculae. The size and ejection fraction of the LV was normal (65%). The attached margins of the septal and inferior leaflets of the tricuspid valve were apically displaced and there was mild tricuspid regurgitation. The distance between the mitral and tricuspid annuli was 20 mm. The right ventricle showed no dilatation and had normal systolic function, but the right atrium was moderately enlarged. As the patient was asymptomatic and the LV systolic function was preserved, he was scheduled for regular follow-up without medication except for low-dose aspirin (100 mg/day).

19714657,"The application of stereological methods for estimating structural parameters in the human heart.This study describes and exemplifies generally applicable design-based stereological methods for obtaining quantitative estimates of the numbers and sizes of capillaries, cardiomyocytes, and cardiomyocyte nuclei in immersion-fixed human left <e>ventricles</e> (N = 6). The design-based stereological methods are valid in all cardiac investigations onto quantifying changes in structure and function as seen under various conditions such as during development, aging, hypertrophy, and following ischemia/reperfusion. The applied principles of unbiased stereology were as follows: 1) uniform random sampling was taken at all levels, also in respect to orientations, for estimates of length and mean sizes. 2) All global structural quantities were estimated as total quantity = density x volume of the left ventricle. As an example, the left ventricle contains 1.5 x 10(9) capillaries with a total length of just below 200 km. 3) Stereological methods were used for estimating the volume density, surface area density, and length density of capillaries and cardiomyocytes. The numerical density of cardiomyocyte nuclei and capillaries was estimated, using the optical and physical disector, respectively. 4) In all local quantities,  size  was estimated either directly, using unbiased estimators to obtain the average individual size and size distribution parameters, or indirectly, using the relationship that: average size = total quantity/total number. In the six hearts constituting this study, we observed the anticipated correlation between left ventricular volume and global estimates such as total number of capillaries. There were no correlation between local quantities and total left ventricular volume (e.g., average star volume of individual cardiomyocytes).",M1
19695453,"The effects of right ventricular apical pacing on ventricular function and dyssynchrony implications for therapy.Cardiac pacing is the only effective treatment for patients with sick sinus syndrome and atrioventricular conduction disorders. In cardiac pacing, the endocardial pacing lead is typically positioned at the right ventricular (RV) apex. At the same time, there is increasing indirect evidence, derived from large pacing mode selection trials and observational studies, that conventional RV apical pacing may have detrimental effects on cardiac structure and left ventricular function, which are associated with the development of heart failure. These detrimental effects may be related to the abnormal electrical and mechanical activation pattern of the <e>ventricles</e> (or ventricular dyssynchrony) caused by RV apical pacing. Still, it remains uncertain if the deterioration of left ventricular function as noted in a proportion of patients receiving RV apical pacing is directly related to acutely induced left ventricular dyssynchrony. The upgrade from RV pacing to cardiac resynchronization therapy may partially reverse the deleterious effects of RV pacing. It has even been suggested that selected patients with a conventional pacemaker indication should receive cardiac resynchronization therapy to avoid the deleterious effects. This review will provide a contemporary overview of the available evidence on the detrimental effects of RV apical pacing. Furthermore, the available alternatives for patients with a standard pacemaker indication will be discussed. In particular, the role of cardiac resynchronization therapy and alternative RV pacing sites in these patients will be reviewed.",M1

We investigate the influences of gender on ventricular electrophysiology and intracellular Ca(2+) regulation of the guinea pig heart. Comparing sexually mature animals, females exhibited a significantly longer APD. Peak L-type Ca(2+) current (I(CaL)) was larger in females and when this current was inhibited with nifedipine the gender differences in APD were removed. APD differences also disappeared when the SR was depleted of Ca(2+). Inactivation of I(CaL) during a clamp step is faster in females but slower during an action potential and SR Ca(2+) content is larger. We suggest that gender differences in APD result from variation in the kinetics of I(CaL) stemming from alterations to Ca(2+) release.",M1
19674111,"Cholinoceptive and cholinergic properties of cardiomyocytes involving an amplification mechanism for vagal efferent effects in sparsely innervated ventricular myocardium.Our recent studies have shown that, as indicated by vagal stimulation, an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor donepezil, an anti-Alzheimer's disease drug, prevents progression of heart failure in rats with myocardial infarction, and activates a common cell survival signal shared by acetylcholine (ACh) in vitro. On the basis of this and evidence that vagal innervation is extremely poor in the left ventricle, we assessed the hypothesis that ACh is produced by cardiomyocytes, which promotes its synthesis via a positive feedback mechanism. Rat cardiomyocytes expressed choline acetyltransferase (ChAT) in the cytoplasm and vesicular acetylcholine transporter with the vesicular structure identified by immunogold electron microscopy, suggesting that cardiomyocytes possess components for ACh synthesis. Intracellular ACh in rat cardiomyocytes was identified with physostigmine or donepezil. However, with atropine, the basal ACh content was reduced. In response to exogenous ACh or pilocarpine, cardiomyocytes increased the transcriptional activity of the ChAT gene through a muscarinic receptor and ChAT protein expression, and, finally, the intracellular ACh level was upregulated by pilocarpine. Knockdown of ChAT by small interfering RNA accelerated cellular energy metabolism, which is suppressed by ACh. Although physostigmine had a minimal effect on the ChAT promoter activity by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase, donepezil resulted in elevation of the activity, protein expression and intracellular ACh level even in the presence of sufficient physostigmine. Orally administered donepezil in mice increased the ChAT promoter activity in a reporter gene-transferred quadriceps femoris muscle and the amount of cardiac ChAT protein. These findings suggest that cardiomyocytes possess an ACh synthesis system, which is positively modulated by cholinergic stimuli. Such an amplification system in cardiomyocytes may contribute to the beneficial effects of vagal stimulation on the <e>ventricles</e>.",M1
19665866,"Correlation of automated function imaging (AFI) to conventional strain analyses of regional and global right ventricular function.BACKGROUND: Automated function imaging is a software tool available to facilitate the efficiency of workflow when analyzing left ventricular strain. In this study, automated function imaging was compared with a conventional approach for the analysis of right ventricular strain in normal and pressure-overloaded right <e>ventricles</e>. METHODS: Twelve pigs were subjected to graded acute right ventricular systolic pressure overload. Intraclass and interclass correlation coefficients (ICCs) with 95% confidence intervals were used for statistical evaluation, with grading based on the kappa statistic as follows: ICC &gt;0.75 = excellent, 0.4 to 0.75 = good, and &lt;0.40 = poor. RESULTS: Intraobserver and interobserver variability for both regional and global strains consistently ranged from good to excellent (ICC, 0.50-0.99), with good agreement between the conventional and automated methods. CONCLUSION: Automated function imaging correlates well with conventional strain analysis of the right ventricle. Automated function imaging is a practical tool for measuring regional and global longitudinal strain in both normal and pressure-overloaded right ventricles.",M1
19643001,"Gene expression profile of rat left <e>ventricles</e> reveals persisting changes following chronic mild exercise protocol: implications for cardioprotection.BACKGROUND: Epidemiological studies showed that physical exercise, specifically moderate lifelong training, is protective against cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Most experimental work has focused into the effects and molecular mechanisms underlying intense, rather than mild exercise, by exploring the acute effect of training. Our study aims at investigating the cardioprotective effect of mild chronic exercise training and the gene expression profile changes at 48 hrs after the exercise cessation. Rats were trained at mild intensity on a treadmill: 25 m/min, 10%incline, 1 h/day, 3 days/week, 10 weeks; about 60% of the maximum aerobic power. By Affymetrix technology, we investigated the gene expression profile induced by exercise training in the left ventricle (LV) of trained (n = 10) and control (n = 10) rats. Cardioprotection was investigated by ischemia/reperfusion experiments (n = 10 trained vs. n = 10 control rats). RESULTS: Mild exercise did not induce cardiac hypertrophy and was cardioprotective as demonstrated by the decreased infarct size (p = 0.02) after ischemia/reperfusion experiments in trained with respect to control rats. Ten genes and 2 gene sets (two pathways) resulted altered in LV of exercised animals with respect to controls. We validated by real-time PCR the increased expression of four genes: similar to C11orf17 protein (RGD1306959), caveolin 3, enolase 3, and hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha. Moreover, caveolin 3 protein levels were higher in exercised than control rats by immunohistochemistry and Western Blot analysis. Interestingly, the predicted gene similar to C11orf17 protein (RGD1306959) was significantly increased by exercise. This gene has a high homology with the human C11orf17 (alias: protein kinase-A interacting protein 1 or breast cancer associated gene 3). This is the first evidence that this gene is involved in the response to the exercise training. CONCLUSION: Our data indicated that few, but significant, genes characterize the gene expression profile of the rat LV, when examined 48 hrs since the last training section and that mild exercise training determines cardioprotection without the induction of hypertrophy.",M1
19624588,"Design of a protective cage for an intravascular axial flow blood pump to mechanically assist the failing Fontan.Currently, no long-term mechanical bridge-to-transplant or bridge-to-recovery therapeutic alternative exists for failing single <e>ventricles</e>. A blood pump that would augment pressure in the cavopulmonary circulation is needed, and would lead to a reduction in elevated systemic venous pressure, and improve cardiac output. Thus, we are developing a collapsible, percutaneously inserted, axial flow blood pump to support the cavopulmonary circulation in adult patients with a failing single ventricle physiology. This collapsible axial flow pump is designed for percutaneous positioning. The outer protective cage will be designed with radially arranged filaments as touchdown surfaces to protect the vessel wall from the rotating components. This study examined the geometric characteristics of the protective cage of filaments and the impeller through the development and numerical analysis of 13 models. A blood damage analysis was also performed on selected geometric models to assess the probability of blood trauma. All models demonstrated an acceptable hydraulic performance by delivering 2-6 L/min at a rotational speed of 6000-10 000 rpm and generating pressure rise of 5-20 mm Hg. Expected trends in the hydraulic performance of the pump models were found. This study represents the initial first design phase of the impeller and protective cage of filaments. Validation of these flow and performance predictions will be completed in the next round of experimental testing with blood bag evaluation.",M1
19617895,"Beta-receptor activation increases sodium current in guinea pig heart.AIM: To study the influence of beta-receptor activation on sodium channel current and the physiological significance of increased sodium current with regard to the increased cardiac output caused by sympathetic excitation. METHODS: Multiple experimental approaches, including ECG, action potential recording with conventional microelectrodes, whole-cell current measurements, single-channel recordings, and pumping-force measurements, were applied to guinea pig hearts and isolated ventricular myocytes. RESULTS: Isoprenaline was found to dose-dependently shorten QRS waves, increase the amplitude and the V(max) of action potentials, augment the fast sodium current, and increase the occurrence frequencies and open time constants of the long-open and burst modes of the sodium channel. Increased levels of membrane-permeable cAMP have similar effects. In the presence of a calcium channel blocker, TTX reversed the increased pumping force produced by isoprenaline. CONCLUSION: Beta-adrenergic modulation increases the inward sodium current and accelerates the conduction velocity within the <e>ventricles</e> by changing the sodium channel modes, which might both be conducive to the synchronous contraction of the heart and enhance its pumping function.",M1
19603826,"Quantification of protein expression changes in the aging left ventricle of Rattus norvegicus.As the heart ages, electrophysiological and biochemical changes can occur, and the ventricle in many cases loses distensibility, impairing diastolic function. How the proteomic signature of the aged ventricle is unique in comparison to young hearts is still under active investigation. We have undertaken a quantitative proteomics study of aging left <e>ventricles</e> (LVs) utilizing the isobaric Tagging for Relative and Absolute Quantification (iTRAQ) methodology. Differential protein expression was observed for 117 proteins including proteins involved in cell signaling, the immune response, structural proteins, and proteins mediating responses to oxidative stress. For many of these proteins, this is the first report of an association with the aged myocardium. Additionally, two proteins of unknown function were identified. This work serves as the basis for making future comparisons of the aged left ventricle proteome to that of left ventricles obtained from other models of disease and heart failure.",M1
19602028,"Synchronous ventricular pacing without crossing the tricuspid valve or entering the coronary sinus--preliminary results.BACKGROUND: Right ventricular apical (RVA) pacing promotes tricuspid regurgitation (TR), electromechanical dyssynchrony, and ventricular dysfunction. We tested a novel intramyocardial bipolar lead to assess whether stimulation of the atrioventricular septum (AVS) produces synchronous ventricular activation without crossing the tricuspid valve (TV). METHODS: A lead with an active external helix and central pin was placed on the AVS and the RVA in three dogs. High-density electroanatomic (EA) mapping was performed of both <e>ventricles</e> endocardially and epicardially. Intracardiac echocardiography was used to access ventricular synchrony. RESULTS: The lead was successfully deployed into the AVS in all cases with consistent capture of the ventricular myocardium without atrial capture or sensing. The QRS duration was less with AVS compared with RVA pacing (89 +/- 4 ms vs. 100 +/- 11 ms [P &lt; 0.0001, GEE P = 0.03]). There was decreased delay between color Doppler M-mode visualized peak contraction of the septum and the mid left ventricular free wall with AVS compared with RVA pacing (89 +/- 91 ms vs. 250 +/- 11 ms [P &lt; 0.0001, GEE P = 0.006]). Activation time between the mid septum and mid free wall was shorter with AVS versus RVA pacing (20.4 +/- 7.7 vs. 30.8 +/- 11.6 [P = 0.01, GEE P = 0.07]). The interval between QRS onset to earliest free wall activation was shorter with AVS vs. RVA pacing (19.2 +/- 6.4 ms vs. 31.1 +/- 11.7 ms [P = 0.005, GEE P = 0.02]). CONCLUSION: The AVS was successfully paced in three dogs resulting in synchronous ventricular activation without crossing the TV.",M1
19584972,"Alteration of messenger RNA and protein levels of cardiac alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor and angiotensin II receptor subtypes during aging in rats.BACKGROUND: Structural and functional alterations in the senescent heart have been associated with an activated sympathetic nervous system and a regional cardiac renin-angiotensin system. To date, however, limited information related to their expression alteration during the whole procress of growth and development has been reported. OBJECTIVES: To examine the expression of alpha(1)-adrenergic receptor (alpha(1)-AR) and angiotensin II receptor (ATR) subtypes in the left ventricle of hearts from young adult, middle-aged, presenescent and senescent rats. METHODS: Semiquantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction and Western blot were used to quantitate the messenger RNA and protein of alpha(1)-AR and ATR subtypes, respectively, in the left <e>ventricles</e> of three- (young adult), 12- (middle age), 18- (presenescent) and 24-month-old (senescent) Wistar rats. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: alpha(1A)-AR expression decreased gradually with age, and alpha(1D)-AR expression was repressed in middle age and presenescence, while the expression of alpha(1B)-AR remained unchanged during senescence. AT(1)R expression was unaffected by aging from young adulthood to presenescence, but exhibited a remarkable upregulation in senescence. There were no significant discrepancies of cardiac AT(2)R expression among the four age groups, but both messenger RNA and protein had a tendency to upregulate during aging. The results suggest that there are considerable changes of expression of cardiac alpha(1)-AR and ATR subtypes during growth and development. The change of cardiac alpha(1)-AR and ATR expression during aging is a protective response to senescence by keeping normal myocardial contractility, while the upregulation of AT(1)R and AT(2)R promotes age-related myocardium hypertrophy and cardiac remodelling.",M1

Myocardial trabeculation preceeds the ventricular septation and at the same time underlies the formation of the interventricular septum. Trabeculae carneae seem to generate the contractile force of the embryonic myocardium. The differences between right and left ventricular trabecular patterns are conditioned by the changes of intracardiac blood flow during the prenatal period. Anatomical characteristics of the right inlet and outlet relief are reviewed. Special emphasis is given to the correlations of the terms  septomarginal trabeculation  and  moderator band . It is noticed that ITS anatomy is still insufficiently studied. The necessity to develop the anatomical criteria of normal intracardiac structures is accentuated.",M1
19558517,"Chronic cigarette smoking affects left and right ventricular long-axis function in healthy young subjects: a Doppler myocardial imaging study.OBJECTIVE: Cigarette smoking is one of the major risk factors for coronary artery disease. However, chronic smoking has additional cardiac adverse effects independent of coronary atherosclerosis. We assessed the possible effects of chronic smoking on left and right ventricular (LV, RV) long-axis function using Doppler myocardial imaging (DMI). METHODS: Forty otherwise healthy smokers (mean age = 26+/-3 years) and 40 age-matched nonsmoking controls enrolled. Standard echocardiography protocol was followed by DMI. Peak systolic (V(S)), early (V(E)) and late diastolic (V(A)) velocities, peak systolic strain (S), and strain rate (SR) were measured from septal, lateral, and RV free walls. RESULTS: The baseline characteristics of two groups were similar. There were significant differences regarding Doppler myocardial velocity, S, and SR indices. Septal V(E) (P &lt; 0.04), S (P &lt; 0.0001) and SR (P &lt; 0.02) were significantly reduced in smokers. For both lateral and RV free wall, V(S) (P &lt; 0.003, P &lt; 0.002, respectively), V(E) (P &lt; 0.0001, P &lt; 0.002, respectively), S (P &lt; 0.0001 for both), and SR (P &lt; 0.0001, P &lt; 0.002, respectively) were significantly reduced in smokers. There were significant correlations between the amount of smoking and septal, lateral, and RV free wall S and SR. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic cigarette smoking causes alterations in long-axis systolic and diastolic functions of right and left <e>ventricles</e> in healthy young subjects. These changes can be accurately detected with Doppler myocardial velocity and SR imaging.",M1

A 25-year-old male patient presented to the neurology department with complaints of weakness in the left extremities. A mild loss of muscle strength was detected on neurological examination. With a preliminary diagnosis of acute cerebrovascular event, treatment with aspirin and enoxaparin was instituted, which improved his complaints within two hours. Electrocardiography showed sinus rhythm, left ventricular hypertrophy, and loss of R-wave progression in the precordial leads. Transthoracic echocardiography showed apical hypokinesia, marked left ventricular hypertrophy, and normal left ventricular diameters. There were numerous trabeculations in the apex, apical, lateral, and inferior walls, and deep intertrabecular recesses. Color Doppler showed blood flow into the intertrabecular recesses. He also had mild mitral regurgitation and diastolic dysfunction of restrictive type. He was scheduled for outpatient follow-up on aspirin and warfarin treatment.",M1
19545393,"Normal right- and left ventricular volumes and myocardial mass in children measured by steady state free precession cardiovascular magnetic resonance.BACKGROUND: Quantification of ventricular volume by steady state free precession (SSFP) cardiovascular magnetic resonance is accurate and reproducible. Normal values exist for adults, but are lacking for children.We sought to establish normal values for left and right ventricular volumes, mass and function in healthy children by using SSFP. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fifty children (27 females, 23 males) without cardiovascular disease were evaluated. Median age was 11 years (range 7 months - 18 years), weight 35 kg (range 7-77 kg), height 146 cm (range 66-181 cm). Thirty-six examinations were performed with breath holding, 14 in freely breathing sedated children.Ventricular volumes and mass were measured in the end systolic and end diastolic phase on SSFP cine images acquired in a short axis plane as a stack of 12 contiguous slices covering full length of both <e>ventricles</e>. Regression analysis showed an exponential relationship between body surface area (BSA) and ventricular volumes and mass (normal value = a*BSAb). Normative curves for males and females are presented in relation to BSA for the end-diastolic volume, end-systolic volume and mass of both ventricles. Intra- and interobserver variability of the measurements was within the limits of 2% and 7% respectively, except for right ventricular mass (10%).

19539540,"Anatomic insights for catheter ablation of ventricular tachycardia.Safe maneuvering of catheters in and around the <e>ventricles</e>, and ablations for ventricular tachycardia, require knowledge of the anatomy of the cardiac and extracardiac structures. This review emphasises the three-dimensional spatial relationships between the right and left ventricles and highlights the important extracardiac structures in the vicinity of the ventricles. The spatial relationships between the right and left ventricles are intricate owing to the curvature of the ventricular septum. The crossover relationship between the right and left ventricular outflow tracts and different planes and angulations between the aortic and the pulmonary valves is particularly relevant to intervening in the ventricular outlets. Importantly, the central location of the aortic valve in the heart puts it in the vicinity of all four cardiac chambers, both for access and for reducing risk of damage to vital structures such as the atrioventricular conduction bundle. The locations of the cardiac chambers are not as simple as implied by the commonly used terms 'right heart' and 'left heart'.",M1
19526036,"Food restriction promotes downregulation of myocardial L-type Ca2+ channels.Food restriction (FR) has been shown to impair myocardial performance. However, the mechanisms behind these changes in myocardial function due to FR remain unknown. Since myocardial L-type Ca2+ channels may contribute to the cardiac dysfunction, we examined the influence of FR on L-type Ca2+ channels. Male 60-day-old Wistar rats were fed a control or a restricted diet (daily intake reduced to 50% of the amount of food consumed by the control group) for 90 days. Myocardial performance was evaluated in isolated left ventricular papillary muscles. The function of myocardial L-type Ca2+ channels was determined by using a pharmacological Ca2+ channel blocker, and changes in the number of channels were evaluated by mRNA and protein expression. FR decreased final body weights, as well as weights of the left and right <e>ventricles</e>. The Ca2+ channel blocker diltiazem promoted a higher blockade on developed tension in FR groups than in controls. The protein content of L-type Ca2+ channels was significantly diminished in FR rats, whereas the mRNA expression was similar between groups. These results suggest that the myocardial dysfunction observed in previous studies with FR animals could be caused by downregulation of L-type Ca2+ channels.",M1
19515241,"Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging in Alström syndrome.BACKGROUND: A case series of the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging findings in seven adult Alström patients. METHODS: Seven patients from the National Specialist Commissioning Group Centre for Alström Disease, Torbay, England, UK, completed the cardiac magnetic resonance imaging protocol to assess cardiac structure and function in Alström cardiomyopathy. RESULTS: All patients had some degree of left and right ventricular dysfunction. Patchy mid wall gadolinium delayed enhancement was demonstrated, suggesting an underlying fibrotic process. Some degree of cardiomyopathy was universal. No evidence of myocardial infarction or fatty infiltration was demonstrated, but coronary artery disease cannot be completely excluded. Repeat scanning after 18 months in one subject showed progression of fibrosis and decreased left ventricular function. CONCLUSION: Adult Alström cardiomyopathy appears to be a fibrotic process causing impairment of both <e>ventricles</e>. Serial cardiac magnetic resonance scanning has helped clarify the underlying disease progression and responses to treatment.

We describe the application of several experimental techniques for the in vitro study of ventricular flow patterns (e.g., unsteadiness, vortical motions, stagnation regions) in the presence of a continuous flow LVAD. We used dye streaks, particle paths, and hydrogen bubble techniques to visualize fluid flow in an idealized, static, transparent mock ventricle attached to a Jarvik 2000 continuous flow LVAD. We recorded ventricular flow behavior at various pump speeds while independently adjusting pump flow (by varying the afterload) to emulate in vivo pump flow at various phases of the cardiac cycle. Changes in ventricular flow behavior at different pump flow rates may be of clinical relevance, because continuous flow pumps are extremely sensitive to inflow and outflow pressures and instantaneous pump flow varies significantly at different points throughout the cardiac cycle. Further work is needed to quantitatively compare the flow behavior of different continuous flow devices in a pulsatile ventricular model.",M1
19486520,"Transcriptional analysis of the mammalian heart with special reference to its endocrine function.BACKGROUND: Pharmacological and gene ablation studies have demonstrated the crucial role of the endocrine function of the heart as mediated by the polypeptide hormones ANF and BNP in the maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. The importance of these studies lies on the fact that hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure are clinical entities that may be regarded as states of relative deficiency of ANF and BNP. These hormones are produced by the atrial muscle cells (cardiocytes), which display a dual secretory/muscle phenotype. In contrast, ventricular cardiocytes display mainly a muscle phenotype. Comparatively little information is available regarding the genetic background for this important phenotypic difference with particular reference to the endocrine function of the heart. We postulated that comparison of gene expression profiles between atrial and ventricular muscles would help identify gene transcripts that underlie the phenotypic differences associated with the endocrine function of the heart. RESULTS: Comparison of gene expression profiles in the rat heart revealed a total of 1415 differentially expressed genes between the atria and <e>ventricles</e> based on a 1.8 fold cut-off. The identification of numerous chamber specific transcripts, such as ANF for the atria and Irx4 for the ventricles among several others, support the soundness of the GeneChip data and demonstrates that the differences in gene expression profiles observed between the atrial and ventricular tissues were not spurious in nature. Pathway analysis revealed unique expression profiles in the atria for G protein signaling that included Galphao1, Ggamma2 and Ggamma3, AGS1, RGS2, and RGS6 and the related K+ channels GIRK1 and GIRK4. Transcripts involved in vesicle trafficking, hormone secretion as well as mechanosensors (e.g. the potassium channel TREK-1) were identified in relationship to the synthesis, storage and secretion of hormones. CONCLUSION: The data developed in this investigation describes for the first time data on gene expression particularly centred on the secretory function of the heart. This provides for a rational approach in the investigation of determinants of the endocrine of the heart in health and disease.",M1
19484190,"Cell swelling, impulse conduction, and cardiac arrhythmias in the failing heart. Opposite effects of angiotensin II and angiotensin (1-7) on cell volume regulation.The influence of hypotonic solution on cell volume and electrophysiology properties of the failing heart of cardiomyopathic hamsters (TO-2) was investigated. The results showed an increase in cell volume of quiescent isolated ventricular myocytes by 66% within 30 min. Angiotensin (1-7) [Ang (1-7)] (10(-8) M) administered to isotonic solution, elicited a gradual decline in cell volume and a significant decrease of the swelling-activated chloride current (I (Clswell)). The effect of Ang (1-7) on cell volume was inhibited by ouabain (10(-7) M). Angiotensin II (10(-8) M) caused cell swelling and increased I (Clswell). Experiments performed on isolated left <e>ventricles</e> of cardiomyopathic hamsters at an advanced stage of the disease, indicated that hypotonic solution prepared by diluting the normal Krebs solution by 25%, showed a gradual decrease of conduction velocity, generation of early after depolarizations and block of impulse conduction within 10 min.

The device has a long projected service life, a totally implantable, readily available and off-the-shelf energy source. The proposed device is a pulsatile, positive-displacement blood pump composed of a conically-shaped compliance chamber, constructed of a biocompatible material and attached to two bioprosthetic valves (an inlet valve and an outlet valve), surrounded by radially-arranged contractile elements, made of an electro-active polymer and connected to a common stimulating electrode connected to an implantable permanent pacemaker.

19423846,"The Tbx2+ primary myocardium of the atrioventricular canal forms the atrioventricular node and the base of the left ventricle.The primary myocardium of the embryonic heart, including the atrioventricular canal and outflow tract, is essential for septation and valve formation. In the chamber-forming heart, the expression of the T-box transcription factor Tbx2 is restricted to the primary myocardium. To gain insight into the cellular contributions of the Tbx2+ primary myocardium to the components of the definitive heart, genetic lineage tracing was performed using a novel Tbx2Cre allele. These analyses revealed that progeny of Tbx2+ cells provide an unexpectedly large contribution to the Tbx2-negative <e>ventricles</e>. Contrary to common assumption, we found that the embryonic left ventricle only forms the left part of the definitive ventricular septum and the apex. The atrioventricular node, but not the atrioventricular bundle, was found to derive from Tbx2+ cells. The Tbx2+ outflow tract formed the right ventricle and right part of the ventricular septum. In Tbx2-deficient embryos, the left-sided atrioventricular canal was found to prematurely differentiate to chamber myocardium and to proliferate at increased rates similar to those of chamber myocardium. As a result, the atrioventricular junction and base of the left ventricle were malformed. Together, these observations indicate that Tbx2 temporally suppresses differentiation and proliferation of primary myocardial cells. A subset of these Tbx2Cre-marked cells switch off expression of Tbx2, which allows them to differentiate into chamber myocardium, to initiate proliferation, and to provide a large contribution to the ventricles. These findings imply that errors in the development of the early atrioventricular canal may affect a much larger region than previously anticipated, including the ventricular base.",M1
19377378,"Systemic hypertension and the right-sided cardiovascular system: a review of the available evidence.Abnormal vasoconstriction of the lesser circulation characterizes a subset of patients with essential hypertension, a possible effect of mechanisms, such as enhanced sympathetic tone, increased delivery of blood-borne vasoconstrictor substances or abnormal local release of vasoactive factors, acting on both sides of the circulation or to backward transmission of increased pressure due to stiffer left <e>ventricles</e> with more advanced diastolic dysfunction. Elevated systemic pressure also associates with thickening of the right ventricle, a central element of the low-pressure system. Right ventricular remodelling develops in parallel with a similar process occurring at the left side, likely as a result of ventricular interdependence under the influence of trophic factors targeting both ventricles, though other mechanisms, including increased pulmonary afterload, may also be operative. By and large independent of the extent of structural remodelling of both ventricles, systemic hypertension also conditions an impaired filling rate of the right ventricle that accompanies a similar phenomenon at the left side. Thus, quite in contrast with the common and simplistic assumption of a separate behaviour of the two ventricles, the right-sided cardiovascular system is not immune to the effect of systemic hypertension, a concept whose clinical and pathophysiological implications require further studies.",M1

Dynamics of the ventricle intracavital pressure was recorded by transmural catheterization. The pump function of the right ventricle in hen (as compared with sinus rhythm) retained to the greater degree at stimulation of the left ventricle apex and deteriorated significantly at stimulation of the right ventricle, whereas in dog (as compared with supraventricular rhythm) it retained to the greater degree at stimulation of the left ventricle base and deteriorated at stimulation of the right ventricle apex. Changes of the pump function of the right heart ventricle at ectopic ventricle stimulation are similar in birds and mammals. Differences in changes of dog and hen pump functions under effect of location of the ectopic excitation seem to be due to morphofunctional peculiarities of heart ventricles.",M1
19363596,"The importance of myocardial amino acids during ischemia and reperfusion in dilated left ventricle of patients with degenerative mitral valve disease.Taurine, glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and alanine are the most abundant intracellular free amino acids in human heart. The myocardial concentration of these amino acids changes during ischemia and reperfusion due to alterations in metabolic and ionic homeostasis. We hypothesized that dilated left ventricle secondary to mitral valve disease has different levels of amino acids compared to the right ventricle and that such differences determine the extent of amino acids' changes during ischemia and reperfusion. Myocardial concentration of amino acids was measured in biopsies collected from left and right <e>ventricles</e> before cardioplegic arrest (Custodiol HTK) and 10 min after reperfusion in patients undergoing mitral valve surgery. The dilated left ventricle had markedly higher (P &lt; 0.05) concentrations (nmol/mg wet weight) of taurine (17.0 +/- 1.5 vs. 10.9 +/- 1.5), glutamine (20.5 +/- 2.4 vs. 12.1 +/- 1.2), and glutamate (18.3 +/- 2.2 vs. 11.4 +/- 1.5) when compared to right ventricle. There were no differences in the basal levels of alanine or aspartate. Upon reperfusion, a significant (P &lt; 0.05) fall in taurine and glutamine was seen only in the left ventricle. These changes are likely to be due to transport (taurine) and/or metabolism (glutamine). There was a marked increase in the alanine to glutamate ratio in both ventricles indicative of ischemic stress which was confirmed by global release of lactate during reperfusion. This study shows that in contrast to the right ventricle, the dilated left ventricle had remodeled to accumulate amino acids which are used during ischemia and reperfusion. Whether these changes reflect differences in degree of cardioplegic protection between the two ventricles remain to be investigated.",M1

19324912,"Time courses of subcellular signal transduction and cellular apoptosis in remote viable myocardium of rat left <e>ventricles</e> following acute myocardial infarction: role of pharmacomodulation.We tested hypothesis that acute myocardial infarction (AMI) induces cellular apoptosis and serial changes of protein kinase C epsilon (PKC-epsilon) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (p38 MAPK), and tested cardio-protective effect of losartan in this condition. The rats were assigned to group A (sacrificed on day 2), group B (sacrificed on day 5), and group C (sacrificed on day 14). Rats in each group were further randomized into the following groups: AMI (ligation of left coronary artery) without losartan (AMI-L0); AMI with losartan 20 mg/ kg/d (AMI-L1); and sham groups (L0 and L1). The PKC-epsilon expression in membrane compartment was increased in AMI-L1 group than in other groups on day 5 and in AMI groups than in sham groups on day 14 (P &lt; .01). Phosphorylated form of cytosolic p38 MAPK level was increased in AMI-L1 than in other groups on day 14 (P &lt; .05). Furthermore, 14-day left ventricular ejection fraction was higher and cellular apoptosis was lower in AMI-L1 group than in AMI-L0 group (P &lt; .0001).",M1
19324149,"Fluid-dynamic modeling of the human left ventricle: methodology and application to surgical ventricular reconstruction.BACKGROUND: The efficacy of surgical ventricular reconstruction (SVR) for ischemic cardiomyopathy has never been truly quantified. Methods to assess ventricular flow have not been applied to these patients. The objective is to develop a volume-independent technique for assessing the effects of ischemic remodeling and SVR on left ventricular blood flow dynamics. METHODS: Cardiac magnetic resonance images from a healthy volunteer and from a patient before and after SVR were segmented and transformed to generate a grid model of the heart by generating numeric grids and running third-order approximations to achieve 850 grid images per cardiac cycle. These grids formed the skeletal structure of our patient-specific time-dependent ventricular geometry model, the Karlsruhe Heart Model, used for modeling fluid dynamics. We modeled flow, ejection fraction, and blood washout from the ventricle. The model was validated using a silicone ventricle and mock circulation. RESULTS: In the healthy heart and before SVR, ejection fractions were 0.61 and 0.15 and left ventricular volumes were 166 mL and 175 mL, respectively. Surgical ventricular reconstruction decreased left ventricular volume by one fourth. Postoperative ejection fraction was 0.18 in the patient. Post-SVR shape was more spherical than preoperatively and also more spherical than the healthy heart. Ventricular flow patterns in the patient were significantly altered by SVR. However, fluid washout from the ventricle was similar before and after SVR but worse than in the healthy heart. CONCLUSIONS: Fluid dynamic modeling of the heart is possible based on cardiac magnetic resonance imaging data and enables volume-independent quantitative assessment of the surgical procedure. In the future, preoperative modeling for patients with remodeled <e>ventricles</e> may help to achieve optimized post-SVR flow characteristics and potentially outcomes.",M1

19276611,"Characterization of ventricular myocardial performance in the fetus by tissue Doppler imaging.BACKGROUND: Clinically useful indices of fetal cardiac function have not been fully delineated for tissue Doppler imaging (TDI). METHODS AND RESULTS: In the present study, 56 pregnancies between the 17(th) and 38(th) weeks of gestation included 38 normal fetuses, 6 cases of hydrops fetalis (HF), and 12 of intrauterine growth retardation (IUGR). Peak velocity in early diastole (E) was measured by pulsed-wave Doppler and the peak annular velocities in systole (Sa) and early diastole (Ea) were measured by TDI. The ratio between flow velocity and annular velocity in early diastole (E/Ea) and the ratio of the Sa of right ventricle to that of the left ventricle (RVSa/LVSa) were estimated. In all fetuses with HF, LVSa was &lt;2 cm/s and LVE/Ea was &gt;13. RVSa/LVSa in the HF group was significantly higher than that in the normal group, and RVSa/LVSa in the IUGR group was significantly lower than that in the normal group. CONCLUSIONS: A combination of low LVSa and high LVE/Ea shows reduced global myocardial performance of the LV, and would be one of the useful indices for quantitative assessment in high-risk pregnancies. Changes in the RVSa/LVSa ratio may reflect afterload changes in both <e>ventricles</e> and compensatory cardiovascular mechanisms occurring during the process of placental insufficiency and heart failure.",M1
19269986,"Acute atrial tachyarrhythmia induces angiotensin II type 1 receptor-mediated oxidative stress and microvascular flow abnormalities in the <e>ventricles</e>.AIMS: Patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (AF) often present with typical angina pectoris and mildly elevated levels of cardiac troponin (non ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction) during an arrhythmic event. However, in a large proportion of these patients, significant coronary artery disease is excluded by coronary angiography. Here we explored the potential underlying mechanism of these events. METHODS AND RESULTS: A total of 14 pigs were studied using a closed chest, rapid atrial pacing (RAP) model. In five pigs RAP was performed for 7 h (600 b.p.m.; n = 5), in five animals RAP was performed in the presence of angiotensin-II type-1-receptor (AT(1)-receptor) inhibitor irbesartan (RAP+Irb), and four pigs were instrumented without intervention (Sham). One-factor analysis of variance was performed to assess differences between and within the three groups. Simultaneous measurements of fractional flow reserve (FFR) and coronary flow reserve (CFR) before, during, and after RAP demonstrated unchanged FFR (P = 0.327), but decreased CFR during RAP (RAP: 67.7 +/- 7.2%, sham: 97.2 +/- 2.8%, RAP+Irb: 93.2 +/- 3.3; P = 0.0013) indicating abnormal left ventricular (LV) microcirculation. Alterations in microcirculatory blood flow were accompanied by elevated ventricular expression of NADPH oxidase subunit Nox2 (P = 0.039), lectin-like oxidized low-density lipoprotein receptor-1 (LOX-1, P = 0.004), and F(2)-isoprostane levels (P = 0.008) suggesting RAP-related oxidative stress. Plasma concentrations of cardiac troponin-I (cTn-I) increased in RAP (RAP: 613.3 +/- 125.8 pmol/L vs. sham: 82.5 +/- 12.5 pmol/L; P = 0.013), whereas protein levels of eNOS and LV function remained unchanged. RAP+Irb prevented the increase of Nox2, LOX-1, and F(2)-isoprostanes, and abolished the impairment of microvascular blood flow. CONCLUSION: Rapid atrial pacing induces AT(1)-receptor-mediated oxidative stress in LV myocardium that is accompanied by impaired microvascular blood flow and cTn-I release. These findings provide a plausible mechanism for the frequently observed cTn-I elevation accompanied with typical angina pectoris symptoms in patients with paroxysmal AF and normal (non-stenotic) coronary arteries.",M1

We sought to determine if physiologic differences exist between subjects with a normal EF (&gt;55%) or mildly decreased EF (40% to 55%). 357 consecutive Chinese patients who were healthy (n = 93) or had HF (n = 264) underwent comprehensive echocardiography, Doppler analysis, and measurement of neurohormones. Subjects with HF were stratified by EF into those with normal EF (&gt;55%, n = 128), mildly decreased EF (40% to 55%, n = 38), or moderate to severely decreased EF (&lt;40%, n = 100). Employing noninvasive pressure-volume analysis, estimated end-systolic and end-diastolic pressure-volume relations were calculated. Subjects with HF and an EF 40% to 55% more often had a previous myocardial infarction and diabetes than those with HF and an EF &gt;55%. Physiologically, the cohort with a mildly decreased EF had eccentrically enlarged <e>ventricles</e> with evidence of remodeling (rightward shifted end-diastolic pressure-volume relation) and decreased chamber contractility (downward shifted end-systolic pressure-volume relation) most comparable to subjects with overt systolic HF.

19255801,"The cardiac sodium channel displays differential distribution in the conduction system and transmural heterogeneity in the murine ventricular myocardium.Cardiac sodium channels are responsible for conduction in the normal and diseased heart. We aimed to investigate regional and transmural distribution of sodium channel expression and function in the myocardium. Sodium channel Scn5a mRNA and Na(v)1.5 protein distribution was investigated in adult and embryonic mouse heart through immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. Functional sodium channel availability in subepicardial and subendocardial myocytes was assessed using patch-clamp technique. Adult and embryonic (ED14.5) mouse heart sections showed low expression of Na(v)1.5 in the HCN4-positive sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes. In contrast, high expression levels of Na(v)1.5 were observed in the HCN4-positive and Cx43-negative AV or His bundle, bundle branches and Purkinje fibers. In both <e>ventricles</e>, a transmural gradient was observed, with a low Na(v)1.5 labeling intensity in the subepicardium as compared to the subendocardium. Similar Scn5a mRNA expression patterns were observed on in situ hybridization of embryonic and adult tissue. Maximal action potential upstroke velocity was significantly lower in subepicardial myocytes (mean +/- SEM 309 +/- 32 V/s; n = 14) compared to subendocardial myocytes (394 +/- 32 V/s; n = 11; P &lt; 0.05), indicating decreased sodium channel availability in subepicardium compared to subendocardium. Scn5a and Na(v)1.5 show heterogeneous distribution patterns within the cardiac conduction system and across the ventricular wall. This differential distribution of the cardiac sodium channel may have profound consequences for conduction disease phenotypes and arrhythmogenesis in the setting of sodium channel disease.",M1
19255502,"Expression, distribution and regulation of sex steroid hormone receptors in mouse heart.The effects of sex hormones on the heart are dependent on the presence and distribution of sex steroid hormone receptors (SSHR) in cardiac tissue. This study used subcellular fractionation, Western blot analysis and densitometry to characterize the subcellular distribution and abundance of estrogen receptor (ER) alpha, ERbeta and androgen receptor (AR) in atrial and ventricular tissue from male and female mice. The results showed that in both atrial and ventricular tissue ERalpha was primarily found in the sarcolemma, whereas ERbeta and AR were predominantly located in the nucleus and cytosol. Interestingly, ERalpha expression was greater in the <e>ventricles</e> compared to the atria, whereas ERbeta and AR expression were similar in both heart chambers. Furthermore, the distribution and abundance of SSHR in the atria and ventricles did not differ between sexes. This study also showed that a reduction in hormone levels (as a result of ovariectomy) resulted in a significant increase in the abundance of ERalpha in the ventricular sarcolemmal fraction. Overall, the results suggest ERalpha, ERbeta and AR distribution and expression are not sex dependent in the mouse heart. However, it appears that ERalpha expression is chamber specific and that, in certain cases, hormone levels can modulate the subcellular location of SSHRs.",M1
19241322,"Prevalence, pattern, and functional impact of late gadolinium enhancement in left ventricular hypertrophy due to aortic valve stenosis.PURPOSE: To assess the prevalence and pattern of myocardial late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) and its functional impact on patients with left ventricular hypertrophy caused by aortic valve stenosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cardiac magnetic resonance imaging of 40 patients (17 female, 23 male, mean age: 76.6 +/- 22.5 years) with known aortic valve stenosis (mean aortic valve area: 89.8 +/- 19.2 mm(2)) and without coronary artery disease was performed at 1.5 T using steady-state free precession sequences for aortic valve planimetry and for the assessment of left ventricular (LV) volumes and mass. Ten to 15 minutes after injection of 0.2 mmol Gd-DTPA per kilogram body weight, inversion-recovery prepared spoiled gradient echo images were acquired in standard long and short axis views to detect areas of LGE. RESULTS: LGE was observed in 32.5 % (13/40) of our patients. LGE was mainly located in the basal septal and inferior LV segments, and showed a non-ischemic pattern with sparing of the subendocardial region. Patients with LGE showed lower LV ejection fractions (55.5 +/- 13.8 % vs. 69.1 +/- 10.7 %, p = 0.0014), higher LV end-systolic volumes (59.8 +/- 33.3 ml vs. 36.6 +/- 16.0 ml, p = 0.0048), and LV masses (211.0 +/- 13.8 vs. 157.9 +/- 37.5 g, p = 0.0002) compared to patients without LGE. CONCLUSION: LGE is frequent in patients with hypertrophic left <e>ventricles</e> due to aortic valve stenosis and is associated with worse LV function.",M1
19241239,"Morphometric study of the ventricular segment of the human fetal heart between 13 and 20 weeks' gestation.Our objective was to determine the normal dimensions of the ventricular segment of the human fetal heart between 13 and 20 weeks' gestation. Study Design: 103 hearts obtained by necropsy were dissected and measurements of different portions of <e>ventricles</e> were determined under stereoscopic magnification. In each ventricle were measured anteroposterior and lateral diameters, inlet and outlet length, and thickness of walls at different levels. Our results showed the cardiac apex was constituted by the left ventricle in 68.9% of the hearts. Both ventricles showed linear growth during this period of fetal development. Ranges in median values of external and internal ventricular measurements were determined. The left ventricular wall was thicker than the right, and the right ventricular cavity was larger.

19235379,"Diminishing the impact of the partial volume effect in cardiac SPECT perfusion imaging.The partial volume effect (PVE) significantly restricts the absolute quantification of regional myocardial uptake and thereby limits the accuracy of absolute measurement of blood flow and coronary flow reserve by SPECT. The template-projection-reconstruction method has been previously developed for PVE compensation. This method assumes the availability of coregistered high-spatial resolution anatomical information as is now becoming available with commercial dual-modality imaging systems such as SPECT/CTs. The objective of this investigation was to determine the extent to which the impact of the PVE on cardiac perfusion SPECT imaging can be diminished if coregistered high-spatial resolution anatomical information is available. For this investigation the authors introduced an additional parameter into the template-projection-reconstruction compensation equation called the voxel filling fraction (F). This parameter specifies the extent to which structure edge voxels in the emission reconstruction are filled by the structure in question as determined by the higher spatial-resolution imaging modality and the fractional presence of the structure at different states of physiological motion as in combining phases of cardiac motion. During correction the removal of spillover to the cardiac region from the surrounding structures is performed first by using reconstructed templates of neighboring structures (liver, blood pool, lungs) to calculate spillover fractions. This is followed by determining recovery coefficients for all voxels within the heart wall from the reconstruction of the template projections of the left and right <e>ventricles</e> (LV and RV). The emission data are subsequently divided by these recovery coefficients taking into account the filling fraction F. The mathematical cardiac torso phantom was used for investigation correction of PVE for a normal LV distribution, a defect in the inferior wall, and a defect in the anterior wall. PVE correction resulted in a dramatic visual reduction in the impact of extracardiac activity, improved the uniformity of the normally perfused heart wall, and enhanced defect visibility without undue noise amplification. No significant artifacts were seen with PVE correction in the presence of mild (one voxel) misregistration. A statistically significant improvement in the accuracy of the count levels within the normal heart wall was also noted. However, residual spillover of counts from within the myocardium creates a bias in regions of decreased wall counts (perfusion defects/abnormal wall motion) when the anatomical imaging modality does not allow definition of templates for defects present in the heart during emission imaging.",M1

19225828,"The development and structure of the <e>ventricles</e> in the human heart.Over the past decade, much has been learned concerning the origin and development of the ventricles. However, most, if not all, of the new information has come from study of the mouse heart. Most of this information has yet to be assimilated by those who study ventricular function or diagnose congenitally malformed hearts. Nevertheless, the evidence available from recent studies, particularly if it can be shown relevant to human development, is remarkably pertinent to these topics. For example, knowledge of how each ventricle derives its inlet and outlet components, information available for human development (Lamers et al., Circulation 86:1194-1205, 1992), provides a firm foundation for understanding congenital cardiac malformations, particularly those dependent on a functionally univentricular circulation (Jacobs and Anderson, Cardiol Young 16(Suppl 1):3-8, 2006). Appreciation of ventricle development also is important with regard to understanding the basis of so-called ventricular noncompaction because this knowledge will elucidate whether the compact component of the ventricular walls is produced by consolidation of the initially extensive trabecular zone seen during early development or by defective formation and/or maturation of the compact myocardium (Anderson, Eur Heart J 29:10-11, 2008). Knowledge concerning the mechanism whereby ventricular myocytes are packed within the compact component of the ventricular walls then will help clarify the architectural arrangement of the aggregated myocytes, a topic of considerable recent interest. This review discusses all these topics.",M1

METHODS: In this retrospective survey 109/28,935 (3.8 per 1,000) singleton pregnancies with abnormal width of the fetal lateral ventricle system diagnosed by antenatal ultrasound examination at the University Hospital of Schleswig-Holstein, Campus Lübeck, were reviewed between 1993 and 2007. Clinical data and pregnancy outcome information were derived from a standardized parental questionnaire or from hospital records. Postnatal follow-up was obtained in &gt;90%. RESULTS: Forty-seven cases with isolated VM (IVM; 43%) and 62 fetuses (57%) with nonisolated VM were diagnosed. In the IVM group 19 cases had mild and 28 fetuses severe VM. Of 62 cases with non-IVM there were 32 with mildly dilated <e>ventricles</e> and 30 had severe enlargements. Chromosomal aberrations were present in 5 fetuses (4.6%) of the non-IVM group. Thirty-four pregnancies (31%) were terminated on parental request (10 IVM/24 non-IVM). The risk of abnormal neurodevelopmental outcome was highest in the presence of associated anomalies (irrespective of the extent of dilatation) and in cases with severe IVM (91 and 68%, respectively). In contrast, 13/14 children with mild IVM showed an age-related normal psychomotor behavior. Fetuses with severe VM had a 2.2- (IVM) to 3.6-fold (non-IVM) elevated risk of progressive dilatations compared to mild VM. In our study the fetuses with asymmetrical bilateral IVM tended to have severe ventricular enlargements more often. CONCLUSIONS: As reported previously we found a positive association between neurodevelopmental delay and the degree of lateral ventricular dilatation. The presence of additional abnormalities is generally a poor prognostic sign and accompanied by a nonfavorable postnatal outcome.",M2
20208973,"Cella media distance in human brain in relation to age and gender.AIMS: To determine whether simple linear measurements can be used as an accurate and reproducible replacement of the volumetric ones. METHODS: We measured the cella media distance (CM1) and the distance between the right and left human brain surfaces (CM2)--measured along the CM1 line--in the groups of women (F) and men (M) who were divided according to diagnoses into three subgroups (F1-3 and M1-3). Examinations were carried out under standardized conditions: axial serial CT (Computed Tomography) images, in 4 mm layers (333 patients). Measured values were detected by Osiris Software. Recorded values were statistically analysed. RESULTS: We found very highly significant (subgroups M1, M3), and significant (subgroups F1, F2, F3, M2) associations between the cella media distance and the decade of age. There were only non-significant differences in CM1 distances between men and women and between the diagnoses groups as well. Correlation between cella media distance and volume of lateral <e>ventricles</e> was greater in men in both, subgroup M1 (r = 0.659, P &lt; 0.0001) and in a mixed group where all the three male subgroups M1-3 were combined into one group (r = 0.675, P &lt; 0.0001). Among women the correlation was lower, however still significant (r = 0.357, P &lt; 0.0001 for F1 and r = 0.465, P &lt; 0.0001 for F1-3). CONCLUSIONS: The cella media distance is much better predictor of brain lateral ventricular volume in men than in women.",M2
20184807,"Hippocampal and caudate volume reductions in antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia.BACKGROUND: Enlarged <e>ventricles</e> and reduced hippocampal volume are consistently found in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. Studies investigating brain structure in antipsychotic-naive patients have generally focused on the striatum. In this study, we examined whether ventricular enlargement and hippocampal and caudate volume reductions are morphological traits of antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia. METHODS: We obtained high-resolution 3-dimensional T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging scans for 38 antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients and 43 matched healthy controls by use of a 3-T scanner. We warped the brain images to each other by use of a high-dimensional intersubject registration algorithm. We performed voxel-wise group comparisons with permutation tests. We performed small volume correction for the hippocampus, caudate and ventricles by use of a false discovery rate correction (p &lt; 0.05) to control for multiple comparisons. We derived and analyzed estimates of brain structure volumes. We grouped patients as those with (n = 9) or without (n = 29) any lifetime substance abuse to examine the possible effects of substance abuse. RESULTS: We found that hippocampal and caudate volumes were decreased in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. We found no ventricular enlargement, differences in global volume or significant associations between tissue volume and duration of untreated illness or psychopathology. The hippocampal volume reductions appeared to be influenced by a history of substance abuse. Exploratory analyses indicated reduced volume of the nucleus accumbens in patients with first-episode schizophrenia. LIMITATIONS: This study was not a priori designed to test for differences between schizophrenia patients with or without lifetime substance abuse, and this subgroup was small. CONCLUSION: Reductions in hippocampal and caudate volume may constitute morphological traits in antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients. However, the clinical implications of these findings are unclear. Moreover, past substance abuse may accentuate hippocampal volume reduction. Magnetic resonance imaging studies addressing the potential effects of substance abuse in antipsychotic-naive first-episode schizophrenia patients are warranted.",M2

20152907,"Insight into the patterns of cerebrospinal fluid flow in the human ventricular system using MR velocity mapping.The patterns of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow within the human ventricular system are still not fully understood in all their complexity. Knowledge is based on either the interpretation of CSF flow curves or computational simulations. Both approaches only provide an incomplete insight into the spatial and temporal dynamics of CSF flow. Time-resolved three-dimensional magnetic resonance velocity mapping has previously been used to investigate normal and pathologic blood flow patterns in the human vascular system. Here we used this technique to study the spatial and temporal dynamics of CSF flow in the ventricular system of 40 normal volunteers. Classification of the patterns of CSF flow based on calculation of three-dimensional particle path lines over the cardiac cycle revealed one uniform flow pattern for the lateral <e>ventricles</e>, three categories for the third and two categories for the fourth ventricle.

Of these, 14 were aged below 13 years. The volumes of the lateral ventricles were measured using T1-weighted MRI images of sagittal sections of the brain to a precision of 3 mm3. External head sizes were also measured to allow ventricle volumes to be normalized. All patients underwent complex neuropsychological investigations. Memory was assessed, along with visual, auditory, tactile, and spatial recognition functions and the motor and speech spheres. Test data were assessed in terms of the severity of impairments associated with one brain structure or another on a tenpoint scale. Assessment points were summed for each hemisphere, for the  first area  (cortical structures), and all structures for statistical analysis. Neuropsychological testing revealed functional impairments predominantly of the frontal areas of the hemispheres, the hippocampus, and the reticular formation. Neuropsychological deficits were least linked with alterations in the postcentral and parietal areas of the cortex. Statistical analysis demonstrated a significant positive correlation between the normalized left lateral ventricle volume and the degree of neuropsychological impairments (r = 0.5127 at p = 0.0063) for the whole study group. The correlation was more marked on comparison of the normalized left ventricular volume and the severity of neuropsychological impairments related to the left hemisphere (r = 0.6303 at p = 0.0004). A relationship was seen between the volume of the intraventricular space and cortical functional impairments (r = 0.5071 at p = 0.0069) in patients less than 13 years old. A relationship between ventricular volume and linear head size was confirmed (r = 0.5759 at p = 0.0017), which was more marked in subjects less than 13 years old (r = 0.6833 at p = 0.01).",M2
20118844,"A long-term study of changes in the volume of brain <e>ventricles</e> and white matter lesions after successful liver transplantation.BACKGROUND: A prolonged survival in liver transplant recipients due to a better management exposes them to multiple factors that can impair neurologic function in the long term. METHODS: Twenty-two patients were studied by brain magnetic resonance and completed a neuropsychologic assessment shortly before liver transplant, 6 to 12 months after (short term), and 6 to 9 years (long term) after liver transplant. Thirteen healthy controls matched by age were studied in parallel. RESULTS: An enlargement in the ventricular size (an indirect measure of brain volume) was observed in the short term (+8%) and in the long term after liver transplant (+22%); the size of ventricles was larger than in healthy controls. In addition, a progression in the volume of focal T2 white matter lesions (an index of small vessel cerebrovascular disease) was detected in the long term (+49%) and was related to vascular risk factors in those with larger increases (&gt;12.5% per year). Neuropsychologic function showed a significant improvement after liver transplant and remained stable in the long term, except for memory loss in those patients with larger increases in white matter lesions. CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in neuropsychologic function after successful liver transplant can be demonstrated up to 9 years. However, these patients experience a progressive accumulation of focal T2 brain lesions and show a smaller brain volume than controls, which can be related to their previous cirrhosis. A good management to minimize brain injury before transplantation and an accurate treatment of vascular risk factors may be important to prevent consequences on cognitive function.",M2
20114082,"A robust method to estimate the intracranial volume across MRI field strengths (1.5T and 3T).As population-based studies may obtain images from scanners with different field strengths, a method to normalize regional brain volumes according to intracranial volume (ICV) independent of field strength is needed. We found systematic differences in ICV estimation, tested in a cohort of healthy subjects (n=5) that had been imaged using 1.5T and 3T scanners, and confirmed in two independent cohorts. This was related to systematic differences in the intensity of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), with higher intensities for CSF located in the <e>ventricles</e> compared with CSF in the cisterns, at 3T versus 1.5T, which could not be removed with three different applied bias correction algorithms. We developed a method based on tissue probability maps in MNI (Montreal Neurological Institute) space and reverse normalization (reverse brain mask, RBM) and validated it against manual ICV measurements. We also compared it with alternative automated ICV estimation methods based on Statistical Parametric Mapping (SPM5) and Brain Extraction Tool (FSL). The proposed RBM method was equivalent to manual ICV normalization with a high intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC=0.99) and reliable across different field strengths. RBM achieved the best combination of precision and reliability in a group of healthy subjects, a group of patients with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and mild cognitive impairment (MCI) and can be used as a common normalization framework.",M2

For testing, subjects who participated in the Oxford Project to Investigate Memory and Aging (OPTIMA) and the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) were selected for ventriculomegaly. Segmentation quality was substantially improved in the <e>ventricles</e> and surrounding structures (9/9 successes on visual rating versus 4/9 successes using the baseline method). In addition, the modification resulted in a significant increase of segmentation accuracy in healthy subjects' brain images. Hippocampal segmentation results in a group of patients with temporal lobe epilepsy were near identical with both approaches. The modified approach (MAPER, multi-atlas propagation with enhanced registration) extends the applicability of multi-atlas based automatic whole-brain segmentation to subjects with ventriculomegaly, as seen in normal aging as well as in numerous neurodegenerative diseases.",M2
20113219,"Computed tomographic evaluation of cerebral ventricular size in clinically normal calves.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate lateral ventricular size in clinically normal calves by use of computed tomography and to examine the relationships between ventricular height (Vh), ventricular area (VA), and ventricular volume (VV). ANIMALS: 14 Holstein calves. Procedures-14 calves underwent computed tomography of the head with transverse images acquired from the rostral aspect of the frontal lobe continuing caudally to the level of the foramen magnum. Hemispheric height, Vh, VA, and hemispheric area were measured on images obtained at the level of the interventricular foramen. Ventricular volume was calculated by multiplying the sum of VAs measured on each transverse image by the total slice thickness. The left Vh-to-right Vh ratio was calculated to determine the degree of ventricular asymmetry, which was categorized as normal (ie, symmetric) to minimally asymmetric, mildly asymmetric, or severely asymmetric. RESULTS: Mean +/- SD values for Vh and the Vh-to-hemispheric height ratio were 4.96 +/- 1.56 mm and 7.47%, respectively. The mean VA was 114.29 +/- 47.68 mm(2), and the mean VV was 2,443.50 +/- 1,351.50 mm3. Normal to minimally asymmetric <e>ventricles</e> were identified in 13 calves, and mildly asymmetric ventricles were identified in 1 calf. Significant correlations were found between Vh and VA and between Vh and VV. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: These results establish reference values for ventricular size in clinically normal calves and suggest that Vh measurement may be a simple and useful technique for examining size of the cerebral ventricles in calves.",M2
20109539,"Expression of ezrin radixin moesin proteins in the adult subventricular zone and the rostral migratory stream.Continuous proliferation occurs in the adult subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral <e>ventricles</e> throughout life. In the SVZ, progenitor cells differentiate into neuroblasts, which migrate tangentially along the rostral migratory stream (RMS) to reach their final destination in the olfactory bulb. These progenitor cells mature and integrate into the existing neural network of the olfactory bulb. Long distance migration of neuroblasts in the RMS requires a highly dynamic cytoskeleton with the ability to respond to surrounding stimuli. Radixin is a member of the ERM (Ezrin, Radixin, Moesin) family, which connect the actin cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix through transmembrane proteins. The membrane-cytoskeleton linker proteins of the ERM family may regulate cellular events with a high demand on cytoskeleton plasticity, such as cell motility. Recently, specific expression of the ERM protein ezrin was shown in the RMS. Radixin however has not been characterized in this region. Here we used immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy to examine the expression of radixin in the different cell types of the adult subventricular zone niche and in the RMS. Our findings indicate that radixin is strongly expressed in neuroblasts of the adult RMS and subventricular zone, and also in Olig2-positive cells. We also demonstrate the presence of radixin in the cerebral cortex, striatum, cerebellum, thalamus, hippocampus as well as the granular and periglomerular layers of the olfactory bulb. Our studies also reveal the localization of radixin in neurosphere culture studies and we reveal the specificity of our labeling using Western blotting. The expression pattern demonstrated here suggests a role for radixin in neuronal migration and differentiation in the adult RMS. Understanding how adult neuronal migration is regulated is of importance for the development of new therapeutic interventions using endogenous repair for neurodegenerative diseases.",M2
20103795,"Supratentorial abnormalities in the Chiari II malformation, IV: the too-far-back ventricle.OBJECTIVE: The sonographic diagnosis of fetal myelomeningocele (MMC) has improved mainly because the diagnostic focus has shifted from observation of the spinal abnormality to observation of cranial abnormalities. We describe an abnormality in the position of the occipital horn in fetuses with MMC. The occipital horn appears to be too posterior in location when compared to healthy fetuses. METHODS: We searched for all cases in which fetal MMC was sonographically detected from 1999 to 2009. Random controls from normal pregnancies were identified. We then measured the shortest distance of the edge of the occipital horn to the occipital bone in fetuses with MMC compared to healthy fetuses. Only fetuses with MMC who had normal-size <e>ventricles</e> were included. RESULTS: A total of 91 fetuses with MMC were identified. Twenty-six fetuses had a normal ventricle size. The gestational age range in this cohort was 18 weeks 5 days to 30 weeks 0 days. The comparison group of 39 healthy fetuses all had normal ventricles and had a gestational age range of 18 weeks 3 days to 35 weeks 2 days. After adjusting for gestational age, the statistical analysis showed that fetuses with MMC had significantly shorter measured distances from the posterior edge of the occipital horn to the occipital bone than healthy fetuses (P = .003). CONCLUSIONS: The occipital horn both appears to be and measures closer to the occipital bone in fetuses with MMC compared to healthy fetuses.",M2

The CT scan of the brain revealed the presence of blood in both occipital horns and communicating hydrocephalus. The symptoms gradually resolved after tumor removal and there was no need for shunting. This is a complex clinical presentation of a spinal cord tumor associated hemorrhage, which further illustrates the possibility of retrograde passage of blood from the lumbosacral region to the <e>ventricles</e>.",M2
20035270,"Abnormalities of tau-protein and beta-amyloid in brain ventricle cerebrospinal fluid.OBJECTIVE: Determination of various biomarkers, such as beta-amyloid, tau-protein, phosphorylated tau-protein in CSF and their sensitivity and specificity in neurodegenerative brain processes, in particular Alzheimer Dementia (AD), has been recently investigated to monitor their abnormalities in the CSF at early stages of diseases before the clinical manifestation. DESIGN AND SETTING: In the pilot group of our patients (10 men / 5 women) who underwent a drainage neurosurgical procedure for diagnosis of hydrocephalus, CSF was obtained from the brain <e>ventricles</e> and the influence of a different compartment of the CSF on the level of biomarkers, tau-protein and beta-amyloid, was investigated. RESULTS: The mean tau-protein level for all 15 patients was 812.0 pg/ml, with median value 363.7 pg/ml; while mean beta-amyloid level for all 15 patients was 526.7 pg/ml, with median value 239.5 pg/ml, respectively. The abnormal tau-protein and beta-amyloid levels were found in the subgroup of patients in whom hydrocephalus was caused by a severe pathological process, such as brain tumor. The beta-amyloid values were significantly lower also in comparison with our previously published results in patients with AD in the CSF obtained by lumbar puncture in the spinal canal. CONCLUSIONS: CSF in the brain ventricles is theoretically more stable and the values in this CSF probably provide more reliable informations for clinical diagnostic procedure than those for the CSF obtained by lumbar puncture in the spinal canal.",M2
20034310,"[Unusual distribution of blood in a ruptured aneurysm--case report]Computed tomography (CT) is an important tool for the evaluation of subarachnoid hemorrhages caused by ruptured aneurysms. However, an unusual radiologic presentation of blood can result in the misdiagnosis of the rupture site. We report a case of ruptured right internal carotid-posterior communicating (IC-PC) artery aneurysm with an unusual radiologic presentation of hemorrhage. The CT scans images of this patient were indicative of blood clots in the cisterna magna and the <e>ventricles</e> with no blood collection in the suprasellar cistern or sylvian fissure. The intraventricular clots were mainly distributed in the fourth ventricle, with few clots in the lateral ventricles. On the basis of these findings, we suspected the origin of the hemorrhage was an unknown ruptured posterior fossa aneurysm. However, angiography revealed a right internal carotid-posterior communicating (IC-PC) artery aneurysm. Twenty-three days after onset, a repeat CT confirmed that the origin of the hemorrhage was the right IC-PC aneurysm. Possible factors involved in this case were: (1) formation of adhesions in the subarachnoid cisterns due to an earlier minor leakage, (2) the orientation of the aneurysm (posteroinferior direction), and (3) early wash out of the blood clot.",M2
20017009,"Agenesis of the corpus callosum in fetuses with mild ventriculomegaly: role of MR imaging.PURPOSE: We evaluated the role of magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the diagnosis of corpus callosum agenesis - isolated or associated with other anomalies - in fetuses with mild cerebral ventriculomegaly, as depicted at prenatal sonography. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between January 2005 and March 2007, 33 fetuses with a mean gestational age of 28.9 weeks (range 17-37) and mild ventriculomegaly diagnosed at prenatal sonography were included in this prospective study. All fetuses underwent MR imaging according to the following protocol: half-Fourier T2-weighted images along the three orthogonal plane according to the longitudinal axis of the mother, and subsequently three orthogonal planes were acquired according to the fetal brain. Quantitative image analysis included the size of the transverse diameter of the lateral <e>ventricles</e>, in the axial plane, and the thickness of the adjacent cerebral cortex. Qualitative image analysis included morphology of the lateral ventricles (normal, parallel pattern colpocephaly), signal intensity changes of the fetal brain, interruption of the germinative matrix, agenesis of the corpus callosum (complete/partial) and associated malformations. Postnatal physical examination and diagnostic imaging, as well as surgery, were the standard of diagnosis. RESULTS: Mean axial diameter of the lateral ventricle was 11.6 mm (range 10-15 mm), and mean thickness of the adjacent cerebral cortex was 2.1 mm (range 1.8-3 mm); 23/33 fetuses (70%) showed normal morphology of the lateral ventricles, and 8/33 (24%) showed abnormal morphology (parallel pattern, colpocephaly). The entire corpus callosum was visualised in 20/33 fetuses (60%). In 8/33 fetuses (25%), partial agenesis was diagnosed, whereas in 5/33 (15%), there was hypogenesis. In 6/13 fetuses (46%), isolated corpus callosum agenesis was detected, and two cases of hypogenesis of the corpus callosum were misinterpreted - overestimated in one case and underestimated in another. CONCLUSIONS: MR imaging may prove to be a useful second-line imaging modality in the prenatal diagnosis of corpus callosum agenesis in fetuses with mild ventriculomegaly.",M2
19943545,"[Fetal ventriculomegaly secondary to germinal matrix hemorrhage--case report]A germinal matrix is an area of the fetal brain where neuroblasts proliferate till the 20th week of gestation after which their migration takes place. Germinal matrix hemorrhage (GMH) is a frequent cause of fetal ventriculomegaly or hydrocephalus, yet the pathophysiological conditions of GMH remain unclear. A case of fetal ventriculomegaly resulting from GMH has been reported in the article. A prenatal ultrasonographic examination (US) carried out in the 30th week of gestation revealed enlarged <e>ventricles</e>. Utero magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) performed in the 34th week of gestation demonstrated asymetric ventriculomegaly and the changes suggesting the occurance of GMH and ependymal intraventricular hemorrhage.

In these cases MRI allows to establish the final diagnosis.",M2
19942696,"Atrophic enlargement of CSF volume after subarachnoid hemorrhage: correlation with neuropsychological outcome.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Ventricular dilation and sulcal enlargement are common sequelae after aSAH. Our aim was to quantify the late ventricular dilation and volumes of the CSF spaces after aSAH and to determine if they correlate with neurologic and cognitive impairments frequently detected in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 3D T1-weighted images needed for volumetry were available in 76 patients 1 year after aSAH, along with 75 neuropsychological assessments. Volumes of CSF segments and ICV were quantified by SPM in 76 patients and 30 control subjects to determine CSF/ICV ratios. The mCMI was calculated to roughly evaluate the ventricular dilation. The contributing factors for enlarged <e>ventricles</e> and CSF volumes were reviewed from radiologic, clinical, and neuropsychological perspectives. RESULTS: The mCMI was higher in patients with aSAH (0.23 +/- 0.06) compared with control subjects (0.20 +/- 0.04; P = .020). In line with these planimetric measurements, the SPM-based CSF/ICV ratios were higher in patients with aSAH (35.58 +/- 7.0) than in control subjects (30.36 +/- 6.25; P = .001). Preoperative hydrocephalus, higher HH and Fisher grades, and focal parenchymal lesions on brain MR imaging, but not the treatment technique, were associated with ventricular enlargement. The clinical outcome and presence of neuropsychological deficits correlated significantly with CSF enlargement. CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular and sulcal enlargement, together with reduced GM volumes, after aSAH may indicate general atrophy rather than hydrocephalus. Enlarged CSF spaces correlate with cognitive deficits after aSAH. A simple measure, mCMI proved to be a feasible tool to assess the diffuse atrophic brain damage after aSAH.",M2
19896132,"The effects of the interthalamic adhesion position on cerebrospinal fluid dynamics in the cerebral <e>ventricles</e>.The interthalamic adhesion is a unique feature of the third ventricle in the brain. It differs in shape and size and its location varies between individuals. In this study, computational fluid dynamics was performed on 4 three-dimensional models of the cerebral ventricular system with the interthalamic adhesion modeled in different locations in the third ventricle. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was modeled as incompressible Newtonian fluid and flow was assumed laminar. The periodic motion of CSF flow as a function of the cardiac cycle starting from diastole was prescribed as the inlet boundary condition at the foramen of Monroe. Results from this study show how the location of the interthalamic adhesion influences the pattern of pressure distribution in the cerebral ventricles. In addition, the highest CSF pressure in the third ventricle can vary by approximately 50% depending on the location of the interthalamic adhesion. We suggest that the interthalamic adhesion may have functional implications on the development of hydrocephalus and it is important to model this anatomical feature in future studies.",M2
19797859,"Perfusion fluids used in neurosurgery affect cerebrospinal fluid and surrounding brain parenchyma in the rat ventriculocisternal perfusion model.ARTCEREB, an irrigation and perfusion solution (Artcereb), is a preparation intended for the irrigation and perfusion of the cerebral <e>ventricles</e>, and it is therefore important to evaluate its effects on cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and on the surrounding cerebrospinal parenchyma. To confirm the kinetics of the perfusion fluid component, we performed whole body autoradiography and examined glucose balance during ventriculocisternal perfusion with (14)C-glucose labeled Artcereb in the rat model, which simulates ventricular irrigation or ventriculocisternal perfusion in clinical neurosurgery. We also performed ventriculocisternal perfusion with Artcereb, lactated Ringer's solution, or normal saline, and observed the effect of these solutions on animal condition and on brain tissue morphology. In the kinetic study, diffusion of (14)C-glucose from the perfused Artcereb to the cerebrospinal tissue was seen on whole body autoradiography, and almost 90% of the glucose in the perfusion fluid was distributed to the cerebrospinal tissue and the systemic circulation. These data indicated that the perfusion fluid interacted actively with the CSF, surrounding parenchyma and the systemic circulation, and suggested that the formation of perfusion fluid affected CSF composition and cerebrospinal tissue functions. Animals perfused with normal saline were associated with serious symptoms including tonic convulsions and death, and exhibited neuronal death in the cerebrum. However, these severe changes were not observed in animals perfused with Artcereb or lactated Ringer's solution. We therefore propose that during neurosurgery, it is extremely important to use a physiological solution like Artcereb which closely resembles normal human CSF, in order to maintain cerebrospinal function and to alleviate postoperative adverse events.",M2
19790105,"RanBPM regulates the progression of neuronal precursors through M-phase at the surface of the neocortical ventricular zone.Many of the mitoses that produce pyramidal neurons in neocortex occur at the dorsolateral surface of the lateral <e>ventricles</e> in the embryo. RanBPM was found in a yeast two-hybrid screen to potentially interact with citron kinase (CITK), a protein shown previously to localize to the surface of the lateral ventricles and to be essential to neurogenic mitoses. Similar to its localization in epithelia, RanBPM protein is concentrated at the adherens junctions in developing neocortex. The biochemical interaction between CITK and RanBPM was confirmed in coimmunoprecipitation and protein overlay experiments. To test for a functional role of RanPBM in vivo, we used in utero RNAi. RanBPM RNAi decreased the polarization of CITK to the ventricular surface, increased the number of cells in mitosis, and decreased the number of cells in cytokinesis. Finally, the effect of RanBPM knockdown on mitosis was reversed in embryos mutant for CITK. Together, these results indicate that RanBPM, potentially through interaction with CITK, plays a role in the progression of neocortical precursors through M-phase at the ventricular surface.",M2
19774369,"A longitudinal observational study of brain atrophy rate reflecting four decades of multiple sclerosis: a comparison of serial 1D, 2D, and volumetric measurements from MRI images.INTRODUCTION: Multiple sclerosis (MS) has a variable progression with an early onset of atrophy. Individual longitudinal radiological evaluations (over decades) are difficult to perform due to the limited availability of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) in the past, patients lost in follow-up, and the continuous updating of scanners. We studied a cohort with widespread disease duration at baseline. The observed individual atrophy rates over time of 10 years represented four decades of disease span. METHODS: Thirty-seven MS patients (age range 24-65 years with disease duration 1-33 years) were consecutively selected and evaluated with MRI at baseline 1995 and in 1996. They were followed up for a decade (mean of 9.25 years, range 7.3-10 years) up to 2003-2005. Brain parenchymal volume and volumes of the supratentorial <e>ventricles</e> were analyzed with semi-automated volumetric measurements at three time points (1995, 1996, and 2003-2005). RESULTS: Volumetric differences were found over shorter periods of time (1-7 months); however, differences vanished by the end of follow-up. A uniform longitudinal decrease in brain volume and increase in ventricle volumes were found. Frontal horn width (1D) correlated strongest to 3D measures. No statistical differences of atrophy rates between MS courses were found. Supratentorial ventricular volumes were associated with disability and this association persisted during follow-up. CONCLUSION: Despite variable clinical courses, the degenerative effects of MS progression expressed in brain atrophy seem to uniformly progress over longer periods of time. These volumetric changes can be detected using 1D and 2D measurements performed on a routine PACS workstation.",M2
19753118,"Cellular and behavioral effects of cranial irradiation of the subventricular zone in adult mice.BACKGROUND: In mammals, new neurons are added to the olfactory bulb (OB) throughout life. Most of these new neurons, granule and periglomerular cells originate from the subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral <e>ventricles</e> and migrate via the rostral migratory stream toward the OB. Thousands of new neurons appear each day, but the function of this ongoing neurogenesis remains unclear. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In this study, we irradiated adult mice to impair constitutive OB neurogenesis, and explored the functional impacts of this irradiation on the sense of smell. We found that focal irradiation of the SVZ greatly decreased the rate of production of new OB neurons, leaving other brain areas intact. This effect persisted for up to seven months after exposure to 15 Gray. Despite this robust impairment, the thresholds for detecting pure odorant molecules and short-term olfactory memory were not affected by irradiation. Similarly, the ability to distinguish between odorant molecules and the odorant-guided social behavior of irradiated mice were not affected by the decrease in the number of new neurons. Only long-term olfactory memory was found to be sensitive to SVZ irradiation. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: These findings suggest that the continuous production of adult-generated neurons is involved in consolidating or restituting long-lasting olfactory traces.",M2
19726031,"Clozapine administration in adolescence prevents postpubertal emergence of brain structural pathology in an animal model of schizophrenia.BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia is a neuropsychiatric disorder of a neurodevelopmental origin manifested symptomatically after puberty. Structural neuroimaging studies show that neuroanatomical aberrations occur before onset of symptoms, raising a question of whether schizophrenia can be prevented. Treatment with atypical antipsychotic drugs before the development of the full clinical phenotype might reduce the risk of transition to psychosis, but it remains unknown whether neuroanatomical abnormalities can be prevented. We used a neurodevelopmental animal model of schizophrenia to assess the efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine to prevent neuroanatomical deterioration. METHODS: Pregnant rats received injection on gestational day 15 with the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (PolyI:C) or saline. Structural brain changes in the male offspring were assessed at adolescence and adulthood (35 days and 120 days) with structural neuroimaging. In the second part, male offspring of PolyI:C- and saline-treated dams received daily clozapine (7.5 mg/kg) or saline injection in adolescence (days 34-47) and underwent behavioral testing and imaging at adulthood (from 90 days onward). RESULTS: In utero exposure to maternal infection led in the offspring to postpubertal emergence of hallmark structural abnormalities associated with schizophrenia, enlarged <e>ventricles</e>, and smaller hippocampus. These abnormalities were not observed in the offspring of mothers who received PolyI:C that were treated with clozapine in adolescence. This was paralleled by prevention of behavioral abnormalities phenotypic of schizophrenia, attentional deficit, and hypersensitivity to amphetamine. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first demonstration that pharmacological intervention during adolescence can prevent the emergence of brain structural changes resulting from in-utero insult.",M2

In vitro assessment of the effects of Artcereb in cell cultures of human fetal astrocytes was conducted in comparison with normal saline and lactated Ringer's solution. The effects of exposure to Artcereb were evaluated based on microscopic images of the mitochondria stained with rhodamine 123. The effects of exposure to Artcereb on cell function were also evaluated by quantitative analysis of mitochondrial activity based on rhodamine 123 and (3)H-thymidine incorporation. Morphological changes in nuclear structure were also evaluated. The results of the present study showed that cell function in cell cultures of human astrocytes was relatively unaffected by exposure to Artcereb as compared with normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution, suggesting that Artcereb has less effect on brain cells than normal saline or lactated Ringer's solution when used for the irrigation or perfusion of the cerebral ventricles.",M2
19710359,"Enlarged brain <e>ventricles</e> and impaired neurogenesis in the Ts1Cje and Ts2Cje mouse models of Down syndrome.Down syndrome (DS) is the most common cause of mental retardation. Although structural and neurogenic abnormalities have been shown in the brains of DS patients, the molecular etiology is still unknown. To define it, we have performed structural and histological examinations of the brains of Ts1Cje and Ts2Cje, 2 mouse models for DS. These mice carry different length of trisomic segments of mouse chromosome 16 that are orthologous to human chromosome 21. At 3 months of age, ventricular enlargements were observed in both Ts1Cje and Ts2Cje brains at a similar degree. Both mice also showed decreases of the number of doublecortin-positive neuroblasts and thymidine-analog BrdU-labeled proliferating cells in the subventricular zone of the lateral ventricles (LVs) and in the hippocampal dentate gyrus at a similar degree, suggesting impaired adult neurogenesis. Additionally, at embryonic day 14.5, both strains of mice, when compared with diploid littermates, had smaller brains and decreased cortical neurogenesis that could possibly contribute to the ventricular enlargements observed in adulthood. Our findings suggest that the trisomic segment of the Ts1Cje mouse, which is shared with Ts2Cje, contains the genes that are responsible for these abnormal phenotypes and could be relevant to the mental retardation associated with DS.",M2
19688041,"beta1 integrin maintains integrity of the embryonic neocortical stem cell niche.During embryogenesis, the neural stem cells (NSC) of the developing cerebral cortex are located in the ventricular zone (VZ) lining the cerebral <e>ventricles</e>. They exhibit apical and basal processes that contact the ventricular surface and the pial basement membrane, respectively. This unique architecture is important for VZ physical integrity and fate determination of NSC daughter cells. In addition, the shorter apical process is critical for interkinetic nuclear migration (INM), which enables VZ cell mitoses at the ventricular surface. Despite their importance, the mechanisms required for NSC adhesion to the ventricle are poorly understood. We have shown previously that one class of candidate adhesion molecules, laminins, are present in the ventricular region and that their integrin receptors are expressed by NSC. However, prior studies only demonstrate a role for their interaction in the attachment of the basal process to the overlying pial basement membrane. Here we use antibody-blocking and genetic experiments to reveal an additional and novel requirement for laminin/integrin interactions in apical process adhesion and NSC regulation. Transient abrogation of integrin binding and signalling using blocking antibodies to specifically target the ventricular region in utero results in abnormal INM and alterations in the orientation of NSC divisions. We found that these defects were also observed in laminin alpha2 deficient mice. More detailed analyses using a multidisciplinary approach to analyse stem cell behaviour by expression of fluorescent transgenes and multiphoton time-lapse imaging revealed that the transient embryonic disruption of laminin/integrin signalling at the VZ surface resulted in apical process detachment from the ventricular surface, dystrophic radial glia fibers, and substantial layering defects in the postnatal neocortex. Collectively, these data reveal novel roles for the laminin/integrin interaction in anchoring embryonic NSCs to the ventricular surface and maintaining the physical integrity of the neocortical niche, with even transient perturbations resulting in long-lasting cortical defects.",M2
19655089,"Stem cell associated gene expression in glioblastoma multiforme: relationship to survival and the subventricular zone.Current therapies for glioblastoma (GBM) target bulk tumor through measures such as resection and radiotherapy. However, recent evidence suggests that targeting a subset of tumor cells, so-called cancer stem cells, may be critical for inhibiting tumor growth and relapse. The subventricular zone (SVZ), which lines the <e>ventricles</e> of the brain, is thought to be the origin for the majority of neural stem cells and potentially cancer stem cells. Therefore, we assessed the relationship between tumor contact with the SVZ as determined by MRI, cancer stem cell gene expression and survival in 47 patients with GBM. Using DNA microarrays, we found that genes associated with cancer stem cells were not over-expressed in tumors contacting the SVZ. Contact with the SVZ trended with shorter survival (median 358 versus 644, P = 0.066). Over-expression of CD133 (prominin-1) and maternal embryonic leucine zipper kinase (MELK) was associated with shorter survival, whereas mitogen activated protein kinase 8 (MAPK8) was associated with longer survival (P values 0.008, 0.005 and 0.002 respectively). Thus we found no evidence of a stem-cell derived genetic signature specific for GBM in contact with the SVZ, but there was a relationship between stem cell gene expression and survival. More research is required to clarify the relationship between the SVZ, cancer stem cells and survival.",M2

19614268,"Investigation of ventricular cerebrospinal fluid flow phase differences between the foramina of Monro and the aqueduct of Sylvius.In this paper, phase contrast magnetic resonance flow measurements of the foramina of Monro and the aqueduct of Sylvius of seven healthy volunteers are presented. Peak volume flow rates are of the order of 150 mm3/s for the aqueduct of Sylvius and for the foramina of Monro. The temporal shift between these volume flows is analyzed with a high-resolution cross-correlation scheme which reveals high subject-specific phase differences. Repeated measurements show the invariability of the phase differences over time for each volunteer. The phase differences as a fraction of one period range from -0.0537 to 0.0820. A mathematical model of the pressure dynamics is presented. The model features one lumped compartment per ventricle. The driving force of the cerebrospinal fluid is modeled through pulsating choroid plexus. The model includes variations of the distribution of the choroid plexus between the <e>ventricles</e>. The proposed model is able to reproduce the measured phase differences with a very small (5%) variation of the distribution of the choroid plexus between the ventricles and, therefore, supports the theory that the choroid plexus drives the cerebrospinal fluid motion.",M2

There are many cases in both human and animals; however, the cause and mechanism of it's development is not clearly understood. In this study, differences of cerebral ventricles in 5 inbred mice strains (MRL/MpJ, C57BL/6, C3H/He, DBA/2 and BALB/c) were investigated by histological techniques to determine the possibility of a new animal model for hydrocephalus. Our analysis showed that significant differences in the volume and the surface area of lateral ventricles in the 5 inbred strains, with MRL/MpJ mice having the largest lateral, third, aqueduct and fourth ventricles. In addition, when MRL/MpJ mice were compared to BALB/c mice on 0 day after birth, the former already had larger lateral ventricles than the latter. Although there were no significant difference in the ratios of ependymal cell types in MRL/MpJ mice and BALB/c mice, the number and the diameter of lipid droplets in MRL/MpJ mice were, interestingly, smaller than those in BALB/c mice. It is well known that ependymal cells absorb nutritional substances in CSF by endocytosis, suggesting the possibility that their decrease may relate to the larger cerebral ventricles in MRL/MpJ. In conclusion, MRL/ MpJ mice have greater volumes in cerebral ventricles than other strains and may be useful for a model showing high susceptibility to hydrocephalus.",M2
19589002,"Cerebellar loss and brain-stem atrophy associated with neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia in a discordant twin.Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia (NAIT) is due to an immune-mediated maternal-fetal platelet antigen incompatibility. Central nervous system abnormalities have been reported in infants with NAIT and include intracranial hemorrhage, ventriculomegaly, porencephalic cysts, neuronal migrational disorders, and, rarely, cerebellar lesions. We present the clinical and neuropathological findings from a case of a 3-day-old diamniotic/dichorionic female twin with known bilateral ventriculomegaly born prematurely at 33-1/7 weeks in gestational age. The pregnancy was further complicated by discordant intrauterine growth, intraventricular hemorrhage in the co-twin, and NAIT. At birth, the infant was noted to have diffuse body ecchymoses and petechiae and arthrogryposis. She subsequently developed multisystem organ failure and disseminated intravascular coagulopathy and died on the 3rd day of life. Neuropathological findings at autopsy included a posterior fossa cyst with no gross anatomic evidence of a cerebellum, atrophic pons and medulla with prominent pyramidal tracts and absent olivary nuclei, thinned corpus callosum, and symmetrical dilation of bilateral lateral <e>ventricles</e>. Microscopic examination confirmed the gross findings and revealed no histological evidence of cerebellar tissue, absence of superior and inferior cerebellar peduncles, and acute and chronic germinal matrix hemorrhages. Immunohistochemical studies revealed a focus of reactive gliosis at the base of the posterior fossa cyst with no evidence of cerebellar Purkinje or granule cells. To our knowledge, this is the 1st report with well-characterized neuropathological examination detailing complete cerebellar loss and brain-stem atrophy in a neonate with NAIT.",M2
19558606,"Lineage analysis of quiescent regenerative stem cells in the adult brain by genetic labelling reveals spatially restricted neurogenic niches in the olfactory bulb.The subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral <e>ventricles</e> is the major neurogenic region in the adult mammalian brain, harbouring neural stem cells within defined niches. The identity of these stem cells and the factors regulating their fate are poorly understood. We have genetically mapped a population of Nestin-expressing cells during postnatal development to study their potential and fate in vivo. Taking advantage of the recombination characteristics of a nestin::CreER(T2) allele, we followed a subpopulation of neural stem cells and traced their fate in a largely unrecombined neurogenic niche. Perinatal nestin::CreER(T2)-expressing cells give rise to multiple glial cell types and neurons, as well as to stem cells of the adult SVZ. In the adult SVZ nestin::CreER(T2)-expressing neural stem cells give rise to several neuronal subtypes in the olfactory bulb (OB). We addressed whether the same population of neural stem cells play a role in SVZ regeneration. Following anti-mitotic treatment to eliminate rapidly dividing progenitors, relatively quiescent nestin::CreER(T2)-targeted cells are spared and contribute to SVZ regeneration, generating new proliferating precursors and neuroblasts. Finally, we have identified neurogenic progenitors clustered in ependymal-like niches within the rostral migratory stream (RMS) of the OB. These OB-RMS progenitors generate neuroblasts that, upon transplantation, graft, migrate and differentiate into granule and glomerular neurons. In summary, using conditional lineage tracing we have identified neonatal cells that are the source of neurogenic and regenerative neural stem cells in the adult SVZ and occupy a novel neurogenic niche in the OB.",M2
19494478,"Early formation of a GFAP-positive cell population in the ventricular zone during chicken brain development.It is believed that neurons are generated near the surface of the embryonic cerebral <e>ventricles</e>, whereas glial cell proliferation occurs at sites distant to the ventricles. There is still uncertainty concerning the developmental stages when glial and neuronal cell lines diverge in the proliferative zone. The purpose of this study was to determine whether at early stages of chicken brain development during neurogenesis, cells from the astrocytic lineage are present in relevant amounts, where they are located in the neural tube, and to what extent brain regional differences exist. In this report, we demonstrate that specific markers for astrocytes [glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and glutamate-aspartate transporter (GLAST)] are expressed and translated during early neurogenesis in the developing chicken embryo at day 4 in the investigated brain regions. Between days 4 and 7, GFAP expression declines, and increases again after day 7. This profile is not entirely paralleled by GLAST expression, suggesting a later acquisition of this functional glial property. Comparison of different brain regions revealed that caudal parts of the developing chicken central nervous system are delayed in development with respect to the switch from neuronal to glial genesis. In conclusion, we show that gliogenesis occurs much earlier in the embryonic chicken brain than hitherto assumed.",M2

19479832,"Time course and nature of brain atrophy in the MRL mouse model of central nervous system lupus.OBJECTIVE: Similar to patients with systemic lupus erythematosus, autoimmune MRL/lpr mice spontaneously develop behavioral deficits and pathologic changes in the brain. Given that the disease-associated brain atrophy in this model is not well understood, the present study was undertaken to determine the time course of morphometric changes in major brain structures of autoimmune MRL/lpr mice. METHODS: Computerized planimetry and high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) were used to compare the areas and volumes of brain structures in cohorts of mice that differ in severity of lupus-like disease. RESULTS: A thinner cerebral cortex and smaller cerebellum were observed in the MRL/lpr substrain, even before severe autoimmunity developed. With progression of the disease, the brain area of coronal sections became smaller and the growth of the hippocampus was retarded, which likely contributed to the increase in the ventricle area:brain area ratio. MRI revealed reduced volume across different brain regions, with the structures in the vicinity of the ventricular system particularly affected. The superior colliculus, periaqueductal gray matter, pons, and midbrain were among the regions most affected, whereas the volumes of the parietal-temporal lobe, parts of the cerebellum, and lateral <e>ventricles</e> in autoimmune MRL/lpr mice were comparable with values in congenic controls. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that morphologic alterations in the brains of MRL/lpr mice are a consequence of several factors, including spontaneous development of lupus-like disease. A periventricular pattern of parenchymal damage is consistent with the cerebrospinal fluid neurotoxicity, limbic system pathologic features, and deficits in emotional reactivity previously documented in this model.",M2
19463890,"Expression and localization of the Parkin co-regulated gene in mouse CNS suggests a role in ependymal cilia function.Parkin Co-Regulated Gene (PACRG) is a gene that shares a bi-directional promoter with the Parkinson's disease associated gene parkin. The functional role of PACRG is not well understood, although the gene has been associated with parkinsonian syndromes and more recently with eukaryotic cilia and flagella. We investigated the expression of Pacrg in the mouse brain by in situ hybridization and observed robust expression of Pacrg in the cells associated with the lateral, third and fourth ventricle, in addition to the aqueduct of Sylvius and choroid plexus. For all regions of Pacrg expression identified, strong expression was observed in the newborn period and this was maintained into adulthood. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Pacrg was a component of the ependymal cells and cilia lining the <e>ventricles</e>. Based on our results and the previous association of PACRG homologues with cilia and flagella, we propose that Pacrg is a component of the ependymal cilia and may play an important role in motile cilia development and/or function in the CNS.",M2
19449142,"Automatic segmentation of the human brain <e>ventricles</e> from MR images by knowledge-based region growing and trimming.Automatic segmentation of the human brain ventricular system from MR images is useful in studies of brain anatomy and its diseases. Existing intensity-based segmentation methods are adaptive to large shape and size variations of the ventricular system, but may leak to the non-ventricular regions due to the non-homogeneity, noise and partial volume effect in the images. Deformable model-based methods are more robust to noise and alleviate the leakage problem, but may generate wrong results when the shape or size of the ventricle to be segmented in the images has a large difference in comparison to its model. In this paper, we propose a knowledge-based region growing and trimming approach where: (1) a model of a ventricular system is used to define regions of interest (ROI) for the four ventricles (i.e., left, right, third and fourth); (2) to segment a ventricle in its ROI, a region growing procedure is first applied to obtain a connected region that contains the ventricle, and (3) a region trimming procedure is then employed to trim the non-ventricle regions. A hysteretic thresholding is developed for the region growing procedure to cope with the partial volume effect and minimize non-ventricular regions. The domain knowledge on the shape and intensity features of the ventricular system is used for the region trimming procedure. Due to the joint use of the model-based and intensity-based approaches, our method is robust to noise and large shape and size variations. Experiments on 18 simulated and 58 clinical MR images show that the proposed approach is able to segment the ventricular system accurately with the dice similarity coefficient ranging from 91% to 99%.",M2
19419900,"An impedance sensor to monitor and control cerebral ventricular volume.This paper presents a sensor for monitoring and controlling the volume of the cerebrospinal fluid-filled <e>ventricles</e> of the brain. The measurement principle of the sensor exploits electrical conductivity differences between the cerebrospinal fluid and the brain tissue. The electrical contrast was validated using dog brain tissue. Experiments with prototype sensors accurately measured the volume content of elastically deformable membranes and gel phantoms with conductivity properties made to match human brain. The sensor was incorporated into a fully automatic feedback control system designed to maintain the ventricular volume at normal levels. The experimental conductivity properties were also used to assess the sensor performance in a simulated case of hydrocephalus. The computer analysis predicted voltage drops over the entire range of ventricular size changes with acceptable positional dependence of the sensor electrodes inside the ventricular space. These promising experimental and computational results of the novel impedance sensor with feedback may serve as the foundation for improved therapeutic options for hydrocephalic patients relying on volume sensing, monitoring or active feedback control.",M2
19401222,"Olfactory bulb <e>ventricles</e> as a frequent finding in magnetic resonance imaging studies of the olfactory system.Background. In some species an embryologic cavity inside the olfactory bulb (OB) persists and is called olfactory bulb ventricle (OBV). It is generally assumed that OBVs in humans are solitary findings representing remnants of embryologic structures that were not fully regressed, although the incidence of OBVs was never examined. Using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), the present study aimed to study the incidence of OBVs in healthy human subjects. Material and methods. A total of 122 individuals participated. Volumes of the right and left OB were determined using MRI scans and a standardized protocol for OB analysis. For comparison, OBs of 42 cadavers were collected and sectioned. Results. The main finding of this study was the high incidence of OBV-like structures in our study group. Seventy-two out of 122 (59%) participants yielded signs for an OBV whereas three out of 42 postmortem OBs contained histologically detectable OBV. DISCUSSION: This stands in disagreement with the previous assumption of complete obliteration at the time of birth. This discrepancy may be explained by the fact that our present findings are based on modern MRI techniques with much higher resolution than 10 or 20 years ago. Another possible explanation for the discrepancy between studies based on MRI and histopathology might relate to postmortem resorption of cerebrospinal fluid from OBVs. Especially with a long postmortem interval OBVs may collapse and may no longer appear as an open cavity.",M2
19394754,"High-frequency chirp ultrasound imaging with an annular array for ophthalmologic and small-animal imaging.High-frequency ultrasound (HFU, &gt;20 MHz) is an attractive means of obtaining fine-resolution images of biological tissues for ophthalmologic, dermatological and small-animal imaging applications. Even with current improvements in circuit designs and high-frequency equipment, HFU has two inherent limitations. First, HFU images have a limited depth-of-field (DOF) because of the short wavelength and the low fixed F-number of conventional HFU transducers. Second, HFU is usually limited to shallow imaging because of the significant attenuation in most tissues. In a previous study, a five-element annular array with a 17-MHz center frequency was excited using chirp-coded signals, and a synthetic-focusing algorithm was used to extend the DOF and increase penetration depth. In the present study, a similar approach with two different five-element annular arrays operating near a center frequency of 35 MHz is implemented and validated. Following validation studies, the chirp-imaging methods were applied to imaging vitreous-hemorrhage-mimicking phantoms and mouse embryos. Images of the vitreous phantom showed increased sensitivity using the chirp method compared with a standard monocycle imaging method, and blood droplets could be visualized 4mm deeper into the phantom. Three-dimensional datasets of 12.5-day-old mouse embryo heads were acquired in utero using chirp and conventional excitations. Images were formed and brain <e>ventricles</e> were segmented and reconstructed in three dimensions. The brain ventricle volumes for the monocycle excitation exhibited artifacts that were not apparent on the chirp-based dataset reconstruction.",M2
19393633,"Reduced glutathione is highly expressed in white matter and neurons in the unperturbed mouse brain--implications for oxidative stress associated with neurodegeneration.Oxidative stress is implicated in the pathogenesis of many neurodegenerative diseases, including Parkinson's disease and Alzheimer's disease. The depletion of glutathione (GSH) a powerful antioxidant renders cells particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress. Isolated neuronal and glial cell culture studies suggest that glia rather than neurons have greatest reserves of GSH, implying that neurons are most sensitive to oxidative stress. However, pathological in vivo studies suggest that GSH associated enzymes are elevated in neurons rather than astrocytes. The active, reduced form of GSH is rapidly degraded thus making it difficult to identify the location of GSH in post-mortem tissue. Therefore, to determine whether GSH is more highly expressed in neurons or astrocytes we perfused mouse brains with a solution containing NEM which reacts with the sulfhydryl group of GSH, thus locking the active form in situ, prior to immunostaining with an anti-GS-NEM antibody. We obtained brightfield and fluorescent digital images of sections stained with DAPI and antibodies directed against GS-NEM, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) in regions containing the hippocampus, striatum, frontal cortex, midbrain nuclei, cerebellum and reticular formation neurons. GSH was most abundant in neurons and white matter in all brain regions, and only in occasional astrocytes lining the third and fourth <e>ventricles</e>. High levels of GSH in neurons and white matter, suggests astrocytes rather than neurons may be particularly vulnerable to oxidative stress.",M2
19393298,"Aquaporin-4 maintains ependymal integrity in adult mice.Ependymal cells form the walls of the <e>ventricles</e>, and take part in the production of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Aquaporin-4 (AQP4), a predominant water channel of the brain, is restricted to basolateral plasma membranes of ependymal cells. The highly polarized expression of AQP4 suggests it may be involved in maintaining the structural and functional integrity of the ependyma. This hypothesis was validated by using adult AQP4 knockout mice generated by our laboratory [Fan Y, Zhang J, Sun XL, Gao L, Zeng XN, Ding JH, Cao C, Niu L, Hu G (2005) Sex- and region-specific alterations of basal amino acid and monoamine metabolism in the brain of aquaporin-4 knockout mice. J Neurosci Res 82:458-464]. Histological analysis showed disorganized ependymal layer of the lateral ventricle and aqueduct in AQP4-deficiency mice. A majority (92.7%) of null mice displayed reduced lateral ventricular volume, while a small fraction (7.3%) had enlarged or normal ventricular size with a narrow aqueduct. Immunohistochemistry demonstrated that AQP4 deletion resulted in decreased expression of gap junction protein connexin43 in the ependymal cells. Electron microscopy confirmed junctional complex absence at basolateral membranes of ependymocytes. Moreover, AQP4 knockout mice showed decreased CSF production and increased brain water content compared with wild-type mice. These results highlight a key role of AQP4 in maintaining the structure and function of the ependyma. In addition, variable profiles of ventricle system in adult AQP4 null mice indicate functional AQP4 polymorphisms.",M2
19392592,"Feasibility of ventricular expansion postmortem: a novel laboratory model for neurosurgical training that simulates intraventricular endoscopic surgery.OBJECT: Cadavers are often used in the teaching of various neurosurgical procedures. One aspect of this resource that has not been previously explored is the postmortem dilation of the ventricular system, which is often collapsed, for the purpose of training neurosurgeons in the use of intraventricular endoscopy. METHODS: Nine adult cadavers without a history of hydrocephalus or other known intracranial pathology were used for this study. Four specimens were obtained post embalming, and 5 specimens were fresh (time from death until the procedure &lt; 5 hours). In all cadavers catheters were placed into the lateral <e>ventricles</e>; saline and then air were injected into the ventricles through the catheters. Ventriculostomy sites were filled with rubber stoppers, and in fresh specimens, formal embalming was performed with cadavers in the Trendelenburg position. Lastly, serial horizontal sectioning of the cranium was performed in all cadavers to verify ventricular dilation. RESULTS: None of the 4 embalmed specimens were found to have ventriculomegaly following injection. However, this condition was found in 4 of the 5 fresh specimens. In the single fresh cadaver without ventriculomegaly, the cause of death had been massive intracranial subarachnoid hemorrhage, which distorted the ventricular system. This may have prevented cannulation of the ventricle and ventricular expansion in this specimen. CONCLUSIONS: The ventricular system of fresh human cadavers can be dilated postmortem. The method described herein may be useful to neurosurgical trainees or those trained neurosurgeons wishing to practice intraventricular endoscopy.",M2
19373558,"Normal and hydrocephalic brain dynamics: the role of reduced cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption in ventricular enlargement.CINE phase-contrast MRI (CINE-MRI) was used to measure cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) velocities and flow rates in the brain of six normal subjects and five patients with communicating hydrocephalus. Mathematical brain models were created using the MRI images of normal subjects and hydrocephalic patients. In our model, the effect of pulsatile vascular expansion is responsible for pulsatile CSF flow between the cranial and the spinal subarachnoidal spaces. Simulation results include intracranial pressure gradients, solid stresses and strains, and fluid velocities throughout the cranio-spinal system. Computed velocities agree closely with our in vivo CINE-MRI CSF flow measurements. In addition to normal intracranial dynamics, our model captures the transition to acute communicating hydrocephalus. By increasing the value for reabsorption resistance in the subarachnoid villi, our model predicts that the poroelastic parenchyma matrix will be drained and the <e>ventricles</e> enlarge despite small transmantle pressure gradients during the transitional phase. The poroelastic simulation thus provides a plausible explanation on how reabsorption changes could be responsible for enlargement of the ventricles without large transmantle pressure gradients.",M2
19372768,"Amygdala volume and verbal memory performance in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.OBJECTIVE: To clarify the relationship between amygdala-hippocampal volume and cognitive performance in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. BACKGROUND: Abnormalities of the amygdala-hippocampal complex and memory deficits have been reported in both schizophrenia and bipolar illness. METHOD: We examined memory performance and its relationship to the volumes of the whole brain, lateral <e>ventricles</e>, hippocampus, and amygdala using morphometric magnetic resonance imaging in 19 patients with schizophrenia, 11 bipolar patients, and 20 healthy controls. RESULTS: Schizophrenia patients performed more poorly than bipolar patients and controls on indices of memory functioning, whereas patients with bipolar disorder showed milder impairments relative to controls. The schizophrenia group showed reduced total cerebral volume and enlarged ventricles relative to controls, but no group differences were found for amygdala or hippocampal volume. Left amygdala volume was predictive of memory performance in both groups, correlating positively with better immediate and delayed verbal memory for bipolar patients and negatively with immediate and delayed verbal recall for schizophrenia patients. Amygdala volume was unrelated to memory performance in healthy subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Schizophrenia and bipolar disorder both seem to be associated with anomalous and differential limbic volume-function relationships, such that the amygdala may facilitate hippocampal-dependent memory processes in bipolar disorder but impair these same processes in schizophrenia.",M2
19353521,"Rostro-caudal gradual loss of cellular diversity within the periventricular regions of the ventricular system.Neurogenesis occurs constitutively within the periventricular region (PVR) of the lateral <e>ventricles</e> (LV) of the adult mammalian brain. The occurrence of adult neurogenesis within the PVR outside the neurogenic niche of the LV remains controversial, but neural stem cells can be isolated from PVR of the whole ventricular system. The histological basis of this phenomenon including the regional differences of cellular phenotypes within the PVRs is still enigmatic. The occurrence of neurogenesis or manipulable progenitor cells in caudal parts of the adult brain is however one prerequisite for orthotopic regenerative approaches in Parkinson's disease (PD) and other disorders of the midbrain/brainstem. Using quantitative immunohistochemical techniques and electron microscopy, we found a rostro-caudal gradual loss of cellular diversity within the PVR throughout the whole ventricular axis with loss of transit amplifying epidermal growth factor-receptor(+) type C cells in all parts caudal to the LV, a gradual reduction from rostral to caudal of both stem cells (type B cells or astrocytes) without signs of proliferation outside the PVR of the LV as well as neuroblasts-like cells (polysialylated neural cell adhesion molecule [PSA-NCAM](+), but doublecortin negative cells) with a different morphology compared with neuroblasts of the PVR of the LV. Electron microscopy confirmed these immunohistochemical data. The proportion of Nestin(+)/CD24(+) cells and Nestin(+)/S100beta(+) ependymal cells were consecutively increased in the PVR from rostral to caudal, and ultrastructural analysis showed a region-specific morphology with darker cytoplasm with occasional large lipid droplets as well as indented nuclei within the caudal PVRs. The strong correlation of neuroblast-like cells with the number of neurosphere-forming cells suggests that a quiescent subtype of PSA-NCAM(+) cells might be a source of neurosphere-forming cells. We did not find any evidence for neurogenesis or the occurrence of neuroprogenitors within the substantia nigra or other parts of the midbrain/brainstem outside the PVR. Our data provide the histological framework for future studies on orthotopic regenerative approaches in PD by recruiting endogenous predopaminergic progenitors from the midbrain PVR.",M2
19352312,"Zebrafish brain ventricle injection.Proper brain ventricle formation during embryonic brain development is required for normal brain function. Brain <e>ventricles</e> are the highly conserved cavities within the brain that are filled with cerebrospinal fluid. In zebrafish, after neural tube formation, the neuroepithelium undergoes a series of constrictions and folds while it fills with fluid resulting in brain ventricle formation. In order to understand the process of ventricle formation, and the neuroepithelial shape changes that occur at the same time, we needed a way to visualize the ventricle space in comparison to the brain tissue. However, the nature of transparent zebrafish embryos makes it difficult to differentiate the tissue from the ventricle space. Therefore, we developed a brain ventricle injection technique where the ventricle space is filled with a fluorescent dye and imaged by brightfield and fluorescent microscopy. The brightfield and the fluorescent images are then processed and superimposed in Photoshop. This technique allows for visualization of the ventricle space with the fluorescent dye, in comparison to the shape of the neuroepithelium in the brightfield image. Brain ventricle injection in zebrafish can be employed from 18 hours post fertilization through early larval stages. We have used this technique extensively in our studies of brain ventricle formation and morphogenesis as well as in characterizing brain morphogenesis mutants (1-3).",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen children referred for MR imaging of the brain for neurologic symptoms were selected. Seven participants had structural brain abnormalities on MR imaging; seven further participants were age-matched controls with normal brain morphology. MR imaging included T1-weighted volumetric images in all cases. Semiautomated postprocessing techniques were performed on the MR imaging data to generate three-dimensional reconstructions of the ventricles. These were analyzed for morphologic changes, and volumes were calculated. Inter- and intrarater agreement of ventricular volumes were calculated. RESULTS: This technique produced detailed three-dimensional reconstructions of the ventricles, even in children with grossly abnormal ventricular morphology. All MR imaging data were successfully postprocessed in &lt;5 minutes. Inter- and intrarater reliability was excellent, with correlation coefficients of 0.99 and 0.92, respectively. CONCLUSION: This methodology can create detailed three-dimensional visualizations and volumetric measurements of morphologically abnormal ventricles. This technique could help physicians and parents comprehend abnormal ventricular anatomy better and may have future clinical uses in monitoring disease progression or neurosurgical planning.",M2

19340576,"Studies of learning and memory processes in adult rats in conditions of intracerebral administration of caspase inhibitors.The effects of caspase inhibitors on different types of learning and memory were studied in adult rats on administration into the cerebral <e>ventricles</e> and application to the vermis of the cerebellum. The wide-spectrum caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk, given into the lateral ventricles of adult rats, facilitated the formation of long-term spatial memory in a water maze and increased the ability to rearrange the habit at the early stages of acquisition of this skill. Application of the specific caspase 3 inhibitor z-DEVD-CHO to the cerebellar vermis stimulated the extinction of an acoustic startle reaction but had no effect on its retention or reproduction. These results indicate that caspases may be involved in the mechanisms of learning and memory both via indirect influences on the linked processes of neurogenesis and apoptosis in the adult brain and by regulating synaptic efficiency.",M2

From them, 14 were younger than 13 years old. The volumes of lateral ventricles were measured using T1-weighted MR-images of the sagittal brain sections to within 3 mm3. External head radii were measured additionally to normalize ventricle volumes. All patients passed complex neuropsychological testing. Memory and functions of visual, auditory, tactile and spatial recognition, motor and speech spheres were examined. Test results were evaluated by the degree of disorders with reference to corresponding brain structures on a 10-point scale. Absence of disorders corresponded to 0 points and maximum intensity of was scored as 10. Disorder scores were summed up for each of hemispheres, the first area (cortical structures), and all structures. Neuropsychological testing revealed disorders, predominantly, in the frontal area, hippocampus and reticular formation. Neuropsychological deficit was minimally related to the disturbances in post-central and parietal cortical areas. Statistical analysis revealed significant positive correlation between normalized volume of the left lateral ventricle and neuropsychological disorder score (r = 0.5127, p = 0.0063) for the whole group studied. The correlation between the normalized volume of the left lateral ventricle with the disorder score related to the left hemisphere was more significant (r = 0.6303, p = 0.0004). At the same time, a correlation of the ventricle volume and the dysfunction of the cortical structures was revealed (r = 0.5071, p = 0.0069) in subjects younger than 13 years old. The study corroborated interrelation between the volume of ventricles and linear head dimensions (r = = 0.5759, p = 0.0017) which was more pronounced in younger subjects (r = 0.6833, p = 0.01).",M2
19325503,"External ventricular drains in pediatric patients.OBJECTIVE: To determine the indications and complications of external ventricular drain (EVD) placement in pediatric patients. DESIGN: Retrospective chart review. SETTING: University associated, tertiary-level Children's Hospital. PATIENTS: Sixty-six [median age, 10.1 years (interquartile range, 5.9)] patients between 1994 and 2006 with 96 EVDs. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Clinical indications for EVD insertion include traumatic brain injury (TBI; 36%), acute hydrocephalus (35%), and ventriculoperitoneal shunt failure (29%). Of the 96 EVDs, 65% were inserted at the bedside in the pediatric critical care unit (PCCU) and 33% in the operating room (OR). Median duration of EVD insertion was 7.0 days (interquartile range, 8.8). Complications occurred with 26% of EVD insertions and included infection (9.4%), misplacement (6.3%), hemorrhage (4.2%), obstruction (3.1%), and malfunction (3.1%). The primary infectious etiology was coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (67% of infections). Despite patients with TBI having significantly smaller lateral <e>ventricles</e> than hydrocephalus patients (p &lt; 0.05), EVD complications were similar (risk ratios 1.41; 95% confidence interval 0.68-2.72). Furthermore, the complication rate was the same for EVDs inserted in either the PCCU or OR (risk ratios 1.10; 95% confidence interval 0.55-2.29). CONCLUSION: EVDs were placed for TBI, ventriculoperitoneal shunt failure and new-onset hydrocephalus. The overall complication rate was 26%. Complication rates were similar in TBI and hydrocephalus patients, and with EVDs inserted in either the PCCU or OR. Prophylactic antibiotics or antimicrobial-impregnated catheters directed against coagulase-negative Staphylococcus may reduce EVD infections.",M2
19301961,"Avoiding the ventricle: a simple step to improve accuracy of anatomical targeting during deep brain stimulation.OBJECT: The authors examined the accuracy of anatomical targeting during electrode implantation for deep brain stimulation in functional neurosurgical procedures. Special attention was focused on the impact that ventricular involvement of the electrode trajectory had on targeting accuracy. METHODS: The targeting error during electrode placement was assessed in 162 electrodes implanted in 109 patients at 2 centers. The targeting error was calculated as the shortest distance from the intended stereotactic coordinates to the final electrode trajectory as defined on postoperative stereotactic imaging. The trajectory of these electrodes in relation to the lateral <e>ventricles</e> was also analyzed on postoperative images. RESULTS: The trajectory of 68 electrodes involved the ventricle. The targeting error for all electrodes was calculated: the mean +/- SD and the 95% CI of the mean was 1.5 +/- 1.0 and 0.1 mm, respectively. The same calculations for targeting error for electrode trajectories that did not involve the ventricle were 1.2 +/- 0.7 and 0.1 mm. A significantly larger targeting error was seen in trajectories that involved the ventricle (1.9 +/- 1.1 and 0.3 mm; p &lt; 0.001). Thirty electrodes (19%) required multiple passes before final electrode implantation on the basis of physiological and/or clinical observations. There was a significant association between an increased requirement for multiple brain passes and ventricular involvement in the trajectory (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Planning an electrode trajectory that avoids the ventricles is a simple precaution that significantly improves the accuracy of anatomical targeting during electrode placement for deep brain stimulation. Avoidance of the ventricles appears to reduce the need for multiple passes through the brain to reach the desired target as defined by clinical and physiological observations.",M2
19278304,"Endoscopic options in children: experience with 134 procedures.OBJECT: There are frequent applications for endoscopy in neurosurgery. However, endoscopic surgery in children has peculiar characteristics and is associated with different rates of success. In this study, the authors report on their experience with 134 consecutive endoscopy procedures performed in 126 patients&lt;18 years of age. METHODS: Between April 1993 and October 2007, 134 endoscopic procedures were performed in 126 children. Indications for surgery included brain tumors in 48 children, cystic lesions in 24, aqueductal stenosis in 23, various malformations in 20, hemorrhage and infarction in 6, and isolated <e>ventricles</e> in 5 children. In this long-term followup study, data were analyzed with respect to clinical and radiological success rates, as well as shunt dependence both in relation to lesion origin, and to the type of endoscopic procedure performed (endoscopic third ventriculostomy [ETV], septostomy, aqueductoplasty, or cystocisternostomy). Finally, the influence of patient age on the success rate was evaluated. RESULTS: In 114 patients, restoration of CSF circulation was the goal of endoscopy, but in 2 patients only ventriculoscopy was performed followed by ventriculoperitoneal shunt placement. In 12 of 114 patients, tumor biopsy sampling or resection was performed simultaneously with shunt placement. In another 12 patients, only endoscopic tumor resection without CSF circulation restoration was done. The follow-up period ranged from 1 to 6 years. Thirteen tumor biopsies, 7 partial tumor resections, and 4 endoscopically complete tumor resections were performed. An intraoperative switch to microsurgery was made in 2 patients because of recurrent hemorrhage and an overly time-consuming endoscopic surgery. Cerebrospinal fluid circulation was successfully restored in 81 (72%) of 112 patients, with the use of endoscopy in the setting of tumor-related hydrocephalus providing the best results (86% success rate). However, of the various endoscopic procedures, cyst openings (cystocisternostomy, cystoventriculostomy, and ventriculocystocisternostomy) provided the best results-superior even to ETV-with a success rate of 77% and no complications. In contrast, endoscopic aqueductoplasty had a high failure and complication rate. Patients&lt;6 months old who underwent ETV, septostomy, or aqueductoplasty had poor results and became more frequently shunt dependent than older children. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, endoscopy can be considered safe and effective in children. Based on the authors' data, acute hydrocephalus cases such as those caused by tumors are the best candidates for endoscopic CSF flow restoration. Interestingly, cyst openings to the ventricles or cisterns were the most successful endoscopic techniques with the lowest complication rate. Aqueductoplasty should be reserved for selected cases. Finally, the success rate of endoscopic techniques remains poor in infants&lt;6 months of age; this was not only true of ETV, but also other techniques such as septostomy and aqueductoplasty.",M2
19274662,"Totally tubular: the mystery behind function and origin of the brain ventricular system.A unique feature of the vertebrate brain is the ventricular system, a series of connected cavities which are filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and surrounded by neuroepithelium. While CSF is critical for both adult brain function and embryonic brain development, neither development nor function of the brain ventricular system is fully understood. In this review, we discuss the mystery of why vertebrate brains have <e>ventricles</e>, and whence they originate. The brain ventricular system develops from the lumen of the neural tube, as the neuroepithelium undergoes morphogenesis. The molecular mechanisms underlying this ontogeny are described. We discuss possible functions of both adult and embryonic brain ventricles, as well as major brain defects that are associated with CSF and brain ventricular abnormalities. We conclude that vertebrates have taken advantage of their neural tube to form the essential brain ventricular system.",M2
19266127,"[Ventricular haemorrhage in preterm neonates and posthemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Proposal of a management protocol based on early ventriculo-peritoneal shunt]INTRODUCTION: About 50% of the preterm neonates with a ventricular haemorrhage will develop posthaemorrhagic hydrocephalus. Medical treatment is not effective neither safe, does not reduce shunt's dependence and therefore can not be recommended; early and repetitive ventricular or lumbar punctures and the use of intraventricular fibrynolitic treatment have showed no effect on reducing patient's disability, shunt's necessity or mortality of these patients and furthermore, they can have several and important side effects. The ventriculo-peritoneal shunt can be in many cases the only option for definitive treatment, despite well-known infective and obstructive complications and there is an ongoing debate about the ideal moment for the intervention. OBJECTIVE: To present a diagnostic and treatment protocol for post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus of the preterm and describe our initial experience with its application on the Paediatric Neurosurgical Department at the Hospital Materno-Infantil Carlos Haya of Málaga. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 21 patients with diagnosis of preterm post-haemorrhagic hydrocephalus were surgically treated at our hospital with ventriculoperitoneal shunt between January 2003 and September 2006 following the designed protocol. All the cases were Papile's grade III or IV with severe ventricular dilation (Thalamus-Caudate index over 1.5 cm) and subacute or chronic presentation. We used medium pressure valves and antibiotic impregnated catheters. We considered 1500 g as the minimum weight permitted for the intervention. We report the early and late postoperative complications and the patients functional state at the ambulatory follow up classifying them in 4 grades (Excellent or Grade 1; Good or Grade 2; Regular or Grade 3; Poor or Grade 4) according to the presence of neurological focal signs, relation with the surrounding environment, response to stimuli and presence of seizures. RESULTS: The most frequent complications were escaphocephalic cranium in 5 patients, persistent subgaleal collections in 2 patients, symptomatic slit <e>ventricles</e> in 2 patients and surgical wound dehiscence with shunt infection in 1 patient. One patient presented a systemic fungical infection with non-diagnosed meningeal compromise previous to the shunt. 7 patients required shunt replacement (14 procedures); in 2 cases of tabicated hydrocephalus an endoscopical septostomy (associated with an ETV that did not function) was done, and in a third case ETV and shunt removal was performed after shunt malfunction, with delayed failure of ETV. For the functional results 9 patients were classified as Grade 1, 5 patients as Grade 2, 3 patients as Grade 3 and 4 patients as Grade 4. This means a 67% of good or excellent results. CONCLUSIONS: We propose a diagnostic and treatment protocol for preterm neonates with haemorrhagic hydrocephalus that we have been using since 2003 at our department. In our experience it is possible to shunt patients starting at 1500 g with low morbidity. The use of protocols can help in reducing complications and improving functional results in these patients.",M2
19246695,"Intraventricular hemorrhage: severity factor and treatment target in spontaneous intracerebral hemorrhage.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This review focuses on the emerging principles of intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH) management, emphasizing the natural history and treatment of intraventricular hemorrhage. The translational and clinical findings from recent randomized clinical trials are defined and discussed. Summary of Review- Brain hemorrhage is the most severe of the major stroke subtypes. Extension of the hemorrhage into the <e>ventricles</e> (a 40% occurrence) can happen early or late in the sequence of events. Epidemiological data demonstrate the amount of blood in the ventricles relates directly to the degree of injury and likelihood of survival. Secondary tissue injury processes related to intraventricular bleeding can be reversed by removal of clot in animals. Specific benefits of removal include limitation of inflammation, edema, and cell death, as well as restoration of cerebral spinal fluid flow, intracranial pressure homeostasis, improved consciousness, and shortening of intensive care unit stay. Limited clinical knowledge exists about the benefits of intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH) removal in humans, because organized attempts to remove blood have not been undertaken in large clinical trials on a generalized scale. New tools to evaluate the volume and location of IVH and to test the benefits/risks of removal have been used in the clinical domain. Initial efforts are encouraging that increased survival and functional improvement can be achieved. Little controversy exists regarding the need to scientifically investigate treatment of this severity factor. CONCLUSIONS: Animal models demonstrate clot removal can improve the acute and long-term consequences of intraventricular extension from intracerebral hemorrhage by using minimally invasive techniques coupled to recombinant tissue plasminogen activator-mediated clot lysis. The most recent human clinical trials show that severity of initial injury and the long-term consequences of blood extending into the ventricles are clearly related to the amount of bleeding into the ventricular system. The failure of the last 2 pivotal brain hemorrhage randomized control trials may well relate to the consequences of intraventricular bleeding. Small proof of concept studies, meta-analyses, and preliminary pharmacokinetics studies support the idea of positive shifts in mortality and morbidity, if this 1 critical disease severity factor, IVH, is properly addressed. Understanding clinical methods for the removal of IVH is required if survival and long-term functional outcome of brain hemorrhage is to improve worldwide.",M2
19245290,"A new approach for observing cerebral cisterns and <e>ventricles</e> via a percutaneous lumbosacral route by using fine, flexible fiberscopes.OBJECT: To establish a new method for the diagnosis of central nervous system diseases, the authors visualized the cerebral cisterns and ventricles via a percutaneous lumbosacral route by using newly developed fine, flexible fiberscopes. METHODS: Fine, flexible fiberscopes, 0.9 and 1.4 mm in diameter, were introduced up to the cerebral cisterns and ventricles through a percutaneous lumbosacral route in awake patients with chronic headache and/or neck pain or those undergoing spinal surgery and in whom MR imaging did not disclose any particular abnormalities in the brain. A lumbosacral subarachnoid puncture was made with a modified method of a continuous epidural block. RESULTS: In 25 of 31 patients tested, the cerebellomedullary and/or pontine/interpeduncular cisterns were easily and safely reached, and the brainstem structures were visualized. Advancement of the fiberscope beyond the spinal level was abandoned in 6 patients with adhesive spinal arachnoiditis, because the fiberscopes encountered resistance seemingly caused by arachnoid adhesions. Further advancement of the fiberscopes up to the fourth and third ventricles was successfully achieved in 2 patients. A number of arachnoid filaments were found in the cerebellomedullary cistern in 4 patients: 2 with chronic spinal arachnoiditis, 1 with a spinal arachnoid cyst, and 1 with posttraumatic pain syndrome. None of the patients reported pain or any major complication except a postspinal headache and light fever, which were encountered in 4 and 1 patient, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The approach to the supraspinal structures via the lumbosacral route by using a fine, flexible fiberscope may provide a new, minimally invasive, and safe way to observe the cerebral cisterns and/or brainstem regions.",M2
19244067,"Fetal cerebral ventricular pointing as a marker of spina bifida: incidence and observational agreement.OBJECTIVE: Occipital cerebral ventricular pointing is a promising intracranial marker for spina bifida. We sought to determine (1) the incidence of pointing in fetuses with and without spina bifida and (2) inter-observer and intraobserver agreement for visualizing pointing. METHODS: Second-trimester transverse axial images of the lateral cerebral <e>ventricles</e> from an equal number of affected and unaffected fetuses were independently reviewed in a blinded fashion by 2 examiners. RESULTS: Sixty-two fetuses (31 with isolated spina bifida and 31 without) had sonographic examinations at 19.2+/-1.3 weeks (mean+/-SD). Pointing was present in 77.3% of fetuses with spina bifida and 15% of those without by the first examiner and in 78.3% of fetuses with spina bifida and 10% of those without by the second examiner. Interobserver and intraobserver agreement were substantial (kappa=0.69 and 0.78, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular pointing is a highly agreed-on finding that is substantially associated with but not pathognomonic for fetal spina bifida.",M2
19204166,"Ventricular wall granulations and draining of cerebrospinal fluid in chronic giant hydrocephalus.BACKGROUND: In rare cases, adults with normal or almost normal cognition may have giant brain <e>ventricles</e> surrounded by a sliver of brain. Because the usual flow of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is interrupted in these individuals, they may develop alternative CSF pathways to preserve brain function. OBJECTIVE: To describe novel morphologic autopsy findings in a patient with chronic giant hydrocephalus that suggest the existence of alternative CSF draining pathways. DESIGN: Case report. SETTING: Autopsy study. PATIENT: A 48-year-old man with chronic compensated hydrocephalus associated with a Dandy-Walker malformation. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Autopsy findings. RESULTS: We observed microscopic structures on the ventricular wall that may facilitate CSF resorption. Their histologic appearance, reminiscent of pacchionian granulations, showed the opposite relation in regard to CSF/blood compartments: whereas the core of a pacchionian granulation contains CSF and the granulation is bathed in blood of the venous sinus, the core of the ventricular granulation in our patient contained venules, with the granulation bathed in ventricular CSF. CONCLUSIONS: These previously unreported (to our knowledge) ventricular wall granulations may facilitate draining of CSF into the venous system when CSF outflow from the ventricular system is occluded. The presence of these ventricular structures illustrates biologic adaptation to anomalous conditions and successful compensation.",M2
19184972,"The significance of fetal ventriculomegaly: etiology, short- and long-term outcomes.Fetal cerebral ventriculomegaly (VM) is diagnosed when the width of one or both <e>ventricles</e>, measured at the level of the glomus of the choroid plexus (atrium), is &gt; or = 10 mm. VM can result from different processes: abnormal turnover of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), neuronal migration disorders, and destructive processes. In a high percentage of cases, it is associated with structural malformations of the central nervous system (CNS), but also of other organs and systems. The rate of associated malformations is higher (&gt; or =60%) in severe VM (&gt;15 mm) and lower (10-50%) in cases of borderline VM (10-15 mm). When malformations are not present, aneuploidies are found in 3-15% of borderline VM; the percentage is lower in severe VM.

19171630,"Brain and <e>ventricles</e> in very low birth weight infants at term: a comparison among head circumference, ultrasound, and magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to assess the relationship among the size of the lateral ventricles, head-circumference measure, and brain volumes. In addition, the association between ventricular dilatation and various brain lesions was defined. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 257 preterm very low birth weight (&lt; or =1500 g) infants who met the inclusion criteria were born in Turku University Central Hospital between 2001 and 2006. A total of 209 (84.8%) of 218 survivors participated in the study. The measurements at term included the ventricular brain ratio, the widths of the frontal and occipital horns of the lateral ventricles by ultrasound, total and regional brain volumes by MRI, and head circumference. Brain lesions were defined by ultrasound at 3 to 5, 7 to 10, and 30 days of age monthly until discharge and by MRI and ultrasound at term. RESULTS: An abnormal ventricular brain ratio (&gt;0.35), an increasing number of dilated ventricular horns, and smaller head circumference were significantly associated with smaller total brain tissue volume. The abnormal ventricular brain ratio and the increasing number of dilated ventricular horns in ultrasound associated with larger ventricular volumes in MRI, and a smaller head circumference was associated significantly with reduced regional brain tissue volumes. Brain lesions were more common in infants with ventriculomegaly. CONCLUSIONS: The ventricular brain ratio, widths of the lateral ventricular horns, and head circumference are appropriate measures for the estimation of both total and regional brain tissue volumes. Ventriculomegaly is strongly associated with brain lesions.",M2

This issue has major implications for the therapeutic use of NSCs as well as for the study and treatment of brain cancers. Recent studies have both shed light on the issue and added to the controversy.",M2
19147686,"Efhc1 deficiency causes spontaneous myoclonus and increased seizure susceptibility.Mutations in EFHC1 gene have been previously reported in patients with epilepsies, including those with juvenile myoclonic epilepsy. Myoclonin1, also known as mRib72-1, is encoded by the mouse Efhc1 gene. Myoclonin1 is dominantly expressed in embryonic choroid plexus, post-natal ependymal cilia, tracheal cilia and sperm flagella. In this study, we generated viable Efhc1-deficient mice. Most of the mice were normal in outward appearance, and both sexes were found to be fertile. However, the <e>ventricles</e> of the brains were significantly enlarged in the null mutants, but not in the heterozygotes. Although the ciliary structure was found intact, the ciliary beating frequency was significantly reduced in null mutants. In adult stages, both the heterozygous and null mutants developed frequent spontaneous myoclonus. Furthermore, the threshold of seizures induced by pentylenetetrazol was significantly reduced in both heterozygous and null mutants. These observations seem to further suggest that decrease or loss of function of myoclonin1 may be the molecular basis for epilepsies caused by EFHC1 mutations.",M2
20426126,"Model-based estimation of ventricular deformation in the cat brain.The estimation of ventricular deformation has important clinical implications related to neuro-structural disorders such as hydrocephalus. In this paper, a poroelastic model was used to represent deformation effects resulting from the ventricular system and was studied in 5 feline experiments. Chronic or acute hydrocephalus was induced by injection of kaolin into the cisterna magna or saline into the <e>ventricles</e>; a catheter was then inserted in the lateral ventricle to drain the fluid out of the brain. The measured displacement data which was extracted from pre-drainage and post-drainage MR images were incorporated into the model through the Adjoint Equations Method. The results indicate that the computational model of the brain and ventricular system captured 33% of the ventricle deformation on average and the model-predicted intraventricular pressure was accurate to 90% of the recorded value during the chronic hydrocephalus experiments.",M2
19111908,"New experimental model of acute aqueductal blockage in cats: effects on cerebrospinal fluid pressure and the size of brain <e>ventricles</e>.It is generally assumed that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is secreted in the brain ventricles, and so after an acute blockage of the aqueduct of Sylvius an increase in the ventricular CSF pressure and dilation of isolated ventricles may be expected. We have tested this hypothesis in cats. After blocking the aqueduct, we measured the CSF pressure in both isolated ventricles and the cisterna magna, and performed radiographic monitoring of the cross-sectional area of the lateral ventricle. The complete aqueductal blockage was achieved by implanting a plastic cannula into the aqueduct of Sylvius through a small tunnel in the vermis of the cerebellum in the chloralose-anesthetized cats. After the reconstitution of the occipital bone, the CSF pressure was measured in the isolated ventricles via a plastic cannula implanted in the aqueduct of Sylvius and in the cisterna magna via a stainless steel cannula. During the following 2 h, the CSF pressures in the isolated ventricles and cisterna magna were identical to those in control conditions. We also monitored the ventricular cross-sectional area by means of radiography for 2 h after the aqueductal blockage and failed to observe any significant changes. When mock CSF was infused into isolated ventricles to imitate the CSF secretion, the gradient of pressure between the ventricle and cisterna magna developed, and disappeared as soon as the infusion was terminated. However, when mock CSF was infused into the cisterna magna at various rates, the resulting increased subarachnoid CSF pressure was accurately transmitted across the brain parenchyma into the CSF of isolated ventricles. The lack of the increase in the CSF pressure and ventricular dilation during 2 h of aqueductal blockage suggests that aqueductal obstruction by itself does not lead to development of hypertensive acute hydrocephalus in cats.",M2
19085158,"Age and gender based biomechanical shape and size analysis of the pediatric brain.Injuries caused by motor vehicle crashes (MVCs) are the leading cause of head injury and death for children in the United States. This study aims to describe the shape and size (morphologic) changes of the cerebrum, cerebellum, brainstem, and <e>ventricles</e> of the pediatric occupant to better predict injury and assess how these changes affect finite element model (FEM) response. To quantify morphologic differences in the brain, a Generalized Procrustes Analysis (GPA) with a sliding landmark method was conducted to isolate morphologic changes using magnetic resonance images of 63 normal subjects. This type of geometric morphometric analysis was selected for its ability to identify homologous landmarks on structures with few true landmarks and isolate the shape and size of the individuals studied. From the resulting landmark coordinates, the shape and size changes were regressed against age to develop a model describing morphologic changes in the pediatric brain as a function of age. The most statistically significant shape change was in the cerebrum with p-values of 0.00346 for males and 0.00829 for females. The age-based model explains over 80% of the variation in size in the cerebrum. Using size and shape models, affine transformations were applied to the SIMon FEM to determine differences in response given differences in size and size plus shape. The geometric centroid of the elements exceeding 15% strain was calculated and compared to the geometric centroid of the entire structure. Given the same Haversine pulse, the centroid location, a metric for the spatial distribution of the elements exceeding an injury threshold, varied based on which transformation was applied to the model. To assess the overall response of the model, three injury metrics were examined to determine the magnitude of the metrics each element sustained and the overall volume of elements that experienced that value. These results suggested that the overall response of the model was driven by the variation in size, with little variation due to changes in shape. This study demonstrates a new methodology to quantify the shape and size variation of the brain from infancy to adulthood. The use of the changes in shape and size when applied to a FEM suggests that there are differences in the spatial distribution of the elements that exceed a specific threshold based on shape but the overall volume of elements experiencing the specified magnitude was more dependent on the changes in the size of the model with little change due to shape.",M2

19041405,"Mapping genetic influences on ventricular structure in twins.Despite substantial progress in measuring the anatomical and functional variability of the human brain, little is known about the genetic and environmental causes of these variations. Here we developed an automated system to visualize genetic and environmental effects on brain structure in large brain MRI databases. We applied our multi-template segmentation approach termed  Multi-Atlas Fluid Image Alignment  to fluidly propagate hand-labeled parameterized surface meshes, labeling the lateral <e>ventricles</e>, in 3D volumetric MRI scans of 76 identical (monozygotic, MZ) twins (38 pairs; mean age=24.6 (SD=1.7)); and 56 same-sex fraternal (dizygotic, DZ) twins (28 pairs; mean age=23.0 (SD=1.8)), scanned as part of a 5-year research study that will eventually study over 1000 subjects. Mesh surfaces were averaged within subjects to minimize segmentation error. We fitted quantitative genetic models at each of 30,000 surface points to measure the proportion of shape variance attributable to (1) genetic differences among subjects, (2) environmental influences unique to each individual, and (3) shared environmental effects. Surface-based statistical maps, derived from path analysis, revealed patterns of heritability, and their significance, in 3D. Path coefficients for the 'ACE' model that best fitted the data indicated significant contributions from genetic factors (A=7.3%), common environment (C=38.9%) and unique environment (E=53.8%) to lateral ventricular volume. Earlier-maturing occipital horn regions may also be more genetically influenced than later-maturing frontal regions. Maps visualized spatially-varying profiles of environmental versus genetic influences. The approach shows promise for automatically measuring gene-environment effects in large image databases.",M2

RESULTS: Twenty-three patients fulfilled the study criteria. All <e>ventricles</e> were cannulated on the first pass. There were no immediate or early postprocedural complications. All but 1 patient had resolution of symptoms (mainly chronic headache) on follow-up (median 7 months, range 1-17 months). The proximal revision rate was 9% (2 of 23 patients). One patient required distal catheter revision. Infection occurred in 1 patient.

19005388,"Direct measurement of intracranial pressure at high altitude and correlation of ventricular size with acute mountain sickness: Brian Cummins' results from the 1985 Kishtwar expedition.OBJECTIVE AND IMPORTANCE: The  tight-fit  hypothesis and subsequent current understanding of acute mountain sickness (AMS) is that individuals with less compliant cerebrospinal fluid systems (smaller <e>ventricles</e> and cerebrospinal fluid spaces) have a greater increase in intracranial pressure (ICP) for a given increase in brain volume as a result of hypoxic cerebral edema. There has only been 1 study of direct (telemetric) ICP measurement at high altitude. This was performed in 1985 on 3 subjects by Brian Cummins up to a maximum height of 16,500 ft (5030 m). The group also investigated the  tight-fit  hypothesis by correlating computed tomographic scans that measured ventricular size (read blindly) with headache score and AMS symptomatology in 10 subjects. Unfortunately, the data were thought to have been destroyed by fire, and, hence, the findings were not published. The data have now been rediscovered, and this article reviews the methodology and findings of this unique piece of work. RESULTS: The ICP monitoring study demonstrated that ICP remained normal at rest at all altitudes; however, in the single subject with AMS, there was a dramatic increase in ICP even on minimal exertion. The computed tomographic scan analysis of brain compliance demonstrated an inverse correlation between ventricular size and headache score. CONCLUSION: This unique research, which is unlikely to ever be repeated, is the only report of direct ICP measurement at high altitude. This and the computed tomographic study provide the first objective evidence supporting the  tight-fit  hypothesis of AMS.",M2

18996916,"Disruption of neural progenitors along the ventricular and subventricular zones in periventricular heterotopia.Periventricular heterotopia (PH) is a disorder characterized by neuronal nodules, ectopically positioned along the lateral <e>ventricles</e> of the cerebral cortex. Mutations in either of two human genes, Filamin A (FLNA) or ADP-ribosylation factor guanine exchange factor 2 (ARFGEF2), cause PH (Fox et al. in 'Mutations in filamin 1 prevent migration of cerebral cortical neurons in human periventricular heterotopia'. Neuron, 21, 1315-1325, 1998; Sheen et al. in 'Mutations in ARFGEF2 implicate vesicle trafficking in neural progenitor proliferation and migration in the human cerebral cortex'. Nat. Genet., 36, 69-76, 2004). Recent studies have shown that mutations in mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase-4 (Mekk4), an indirect interactor with FlnA, also lead to periventricular nodule formation in mice (Sarkisian et al. in 'MEKK4 signaling regulates filamin expression and neuronal migration'. Neuron, 52, 789-801, 2006). Here we show that neurons in post-mortem human PH brains migrated appropriately into the cortex, that periventricular nodules were primarily composed of later-born neurons, and that the neuroependyma was disrupted in all PH cases. As studied in the mouse, loss of FlnA or Big2 function in neural precursors impaired neuronal migration from the germinal zone, disrupted cell adhesion and compromised neuroepithelial integrity. Finally, the hydrocephalus with hop gait (hyh) mouse, which harbors a mutation in Napa [encoding N-ethylmaleimide-sensitive factor attachment protein alpha (alpha-SNAP)], also develops a progressive denudation of the neuroepithelium, leading to periventricular nodule formation. Previous studies have shown that Arfgef2 and Napa direct vesicle trafficking and fusion, whereas FlnA associates dynamically with the Golgi membranes during budding and trafficking of transport vesicles. Our current findings suggest that PH formation arises from a final common pathway involving disruption of vesicle trafficking, leading to impaired cell adhesion and loss of neuroependymal integrity.",M2

All the residents (n=1142) aged 61 years (n=306, men/women=156/150) and 70-72 years (n=836, men/women=356/480) in the two communities of Japan were requested to take brain MRI examination. The  iNPH features on MRI  were defined as an Evans index of &gt;0.3 and a narrowing of the subarachnoid space and cortical sulci at the high convexity of the cerebrum.  Possible iNPH  was defined as the presence of one or more symptoms of iNPH, together with such MRI features. 790 (69.2%) of the 1142 residents participated in this study. Among them, 51 individuals (men/women=35/16) (6.46%) had the enlarged <e>ventricles</e> (Evans index of &gt;0.3), 12 (men/women=7/5) (1.52%) of which showed the iNPH features on MRI.

Injection of anti-P ribosomal antibodies (anti-P) directly to the brain <e>ventricles</e> of mice induces depression manifested by increased immobility time in the forced swim test (FST). METHODS: Mice were injected intracerebroventricularily (ICV) with affinity-purified human anti-P antibodies or normal commercial IgG as control. Mice were examined for depression by the forced swimming test (FST) and for olfactory function by the smell threshold test. Treatments included the antidepressant drug fluoxetine or aroma therapy by exposure to lemon or cinnamon odor. RESULTS: Mice injected with anti-P developed depression-like behavior, which improved significantly upon treatment with fluoxetine. Depressed mice had a significant deficit in olfactory function which was not reversed by fluoxetine. Exposure of anti-P-injected mice to lemon odor was associated with some improvement of the immobility time, a measure of depression. CONCLUSIONS: ICV injection of anti-P induces both depression-like behavior and impaired olfactory function in mice. Fluoxetine and possibly lemon odor exposure improve depressive behavior in these mice.",M2
18942271,"[Type 1 Arnold Chiari malformation, syringomielia, syringobulbia and IV ventricle entrapment]Arnold-Chiari Malformation (ACM) was first described by Hans Chiari in 1890. Four types of this malformation are recognized, of those, type I is the most common among adults. It is caused by an elongation of the cerebellum into the conic projections that accompany the brain stem within the spinal channel. It is mostly congenital but  acquired  forms can be seen in the context of infections or posterior fossa tumors. Clinically, it can present as an asymptomatic finding, but it can produce brain stem compression. Syringomielia--cavitation of the brain stem central areas--is associated with MAC type I in 75 to 85% of cases. Clinical signs include pain, weakness, extremity parestesia. A shunt to the lateral <e>ventricles</e> can produce IV ventricle entrapment and is associated with cerebrospinal fluid blockage. We describe a case of MAC type I associated with the presence of syringomielia, syringobulbia and IV ventricle entrapment.",M2
18845808,"Characterization of acute brain injuries and neurobehavioral profiles in a rabbit model of germinal matrix hemorrhage.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Germinal matrix hemorrhage-intraventricular hemorrhage (GMH-IVH) is the most common neurological problem of premature infants and has enormous financial and social impact. Despite this, there is no standardized animal model of IVH depicting acute brain injuries. METHODS: We delivered rabbit-pups prematurely at 29-day gestation by C-section, administered intraperitoneal glycerol to the pups at 3-hour postnatal age to induce IVH, and evaluated the brain for evidence of injuries. RESULTS: About 80% of glycerol-treated pups developed gross IVH. We found greater neutrophil and microglia infiltration around the <e>ventricles</e> (periventricular zone) in pups with IVH than in controls. We noted more apoptosis and neuronal degeneration in the periventricular zone than in the neocortex in pups with IVH, but not in controls. There was evidence of axonal damage revealed by beta-amyloid precursor protein and neurofilament immunolabeling. Neurobehavioral testing showed that pups with IVH were more wobbly with lesser capability to walk on inclination than pups without IVH. There was no evidence of acute systemic toxicity in the glycerol-treated pups. An evaluation of autopsy materials from premature infants revealed similar evidence of apoptosis and cellular infiltration in the periventricular zone in cases with IVH, but not in cases without IVH-suggesting clinical relevance of the model. CONCLUSIONS: The study provides an instructive animal model of IVH with evidence of acute brain injuries that can be used to evaluate strategies in prevention of IVH and acute posthemorrhagic complications.",M2

18827653,"Cranial vault expansion in the management of postshunt craniosynostosis and slit ventricle syndrome.BACKGROUND: Slit ventricle syndrome and postshunt craniosynostosis are uncommon complications after shunting procedures for congenital hydrocephalus. Slit ventricle syndrome occurs as a complication in 1 to 5 percent of patients after shunting procedures for hydrocephalus during infancy. These patients usually have had a shunt in place for years, with overdrainage of cerebrospinal fluid resulting in very small <e>ventricles</e>. Excessive intracranial decompression may result in ventricular collapse with the formation of slit-like ventricles and cranial vault collapse with secondary craniosynostosis. METHODS: A retrospective review of 12 patients who had undergone cranial vault expansion for management of postshunt craniosynostosis and slit ventricle syndrome refractory to other treatment modalities was performed. All patients had initially been shunted for congenital hydrocephalus and subsequently underwent a mean of 4.9 shunt revisions before cranial vault expansion. RESULTS: All 12 patients demonstrated decreased ventricular volume, with noncompliant slit-like ventricles in nine of these patients. Five patients demonstrated pancraniosynostosis, three patients demonstrated multiple sutural fusion, and isolated sagittal synostosis occurred in two patients. Two patients appeared to have  functional  synostoses with narrowed, overlapping sutures that were not actually fused. Eleven patients underwent bilateral fronto-orbital advancement with frontotemporoparietal expansion; one patient underwent only posterior vault expansion. Seven of the 12 patients required a mean of 2.3 shunt revisions after cranial vault expansion; five patients did not require subsequent revisions. Improvement in cranial vault shape was achieved in all 12 patients, as was improvement of neurologic symptoms in nine of the 12 patients. CONCLUSIONS: Cranial vault expansion is a useful approach in the management of the restricted cranium associated with slit ventricle syndrome and postshunt craniosynostosis. This approach resulted in a decreased need for shunt revisions and improvement of neurologic symptoms and cranial vault shape.",M2

18798357,"Ventricular expansion in wild-type Wistar rats after alcohol exposure by vapor chamber.BACKGROUND: Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reveals widespread brain damage manifest as tissue shrinkage and complementary ventriculomegaly in human alcoholism. For an animal model to parallel the human condition, high alcohol exposure should produce similar radiologically detectable neuropathology. Our previous structural MRI study demonstrated only modest brain dysmorphology of the alcohol-preferring (P) rat with average blood alcohol levels(BALs) of 125 mg/dl achieved with voluntary consumption. Here, we tested the hypothesis that wild-type Wistar rats, exposed to vaporized alcohol ensuring higher BALs than typically achieved with voluntary consumption in rodents, would model MRI findings in the brains of humans with chronic alcoholism. METHODS: The longitudinal effects of vaporized alcohol exposure on the brains of 10 wild-type Wistar rats compared with 10 sibling controls were investigated with structural MRI, conducted before (MRI 1) and after (MRI 2) 16 of alcohol exposure and after an additional 8 weeks at a higher concentration of alcohol (MRI 3). RESULTS: Two rats in the alcohol group died prior to MRI 2. The remaining vapor-exposed rats(n = 8) achieved BALs of 293 mg/dl by MRI 2 and 445 mg/dl by MRI 3. Whereas the controls gained 17% of their body weight from MRI 1 to MRI 3, the alcohol-exposed group lost 6%.MRI, quantified with atlas-based parcellation, revealed a profile of significant ventricular expansion,after alcohol vapor exposure, in 9 contiguous slices, extending from the dorsolateral to ventrolateral <e>ventricles</e>. In particular, from MRI 1 to MRI 2, this ventricular volume expanded by an average of 6.5% in the controls and by 27.1% in the alcohol-exposed rats but only an additional 1.5% in controls and 2.4% in alcohol-exposed rats from MRI 2 to MRI 3. The midsagittal volume of the full anterior-to-posterior extent of the corpus callosum grew between the first 2 MRIs in both groups followed by regression in the alcohol group by MRI 3. Although group differences were statistically significant, among animals there was substantial variability of the effects of alcohol exposure on brain morphology; some animals showed profound effects, whereas others were essentially unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: The ventricular dilatation and callosal shrinkage produced in wild-type rats following involuntary alcohol exposure yielded a modestly successful model of neurodysmorphology phenotypes of human alcoholism. As is the case for the human condition, however, in which some individuals express greater alcoholism-related neuropathology than others, some rats maybe more susceptible than others to extreme alcohol exposure.",M2
18787659,"Cerebral ventricular volume and temperamental difficulties in infancy. The Generation R Study.BACKGROUND: Numerous studies have provided evidence for subtle deviations in brain morphology in children with psychiatric disorders, but much less is known about the onset and developmental trajectory of these deviations early in life. We sought to determine whether variances in cerebral ventricular size in fetuses and newborns are associated with temperamental difficulties in infants. METHODS: Within a population-based cohort study, we measured the size of the lateral ventricle of the fetus' brain twice during pregnancy. We used 3-dimensional cranial ultrasound to measure the cerebral ventricular volume of infants at age 6 weeks. We then related the size of the cerebral ventricular system to temperamental dimensions at age 3 months using the Mother and Baby Scales, and at age 6 months using the Infant Behavior Questionnaire for a total of 1028 infants. RESULTS: The size of the lateral ventricle of the fetuses in midpregnancy was not related to temperamental difficulties in infants; however, smaller lateral <e>ventricles</e> in late pregnancy were associated with higher activity levels at the age of 6 months. Infants with smaller ventricular volumes at age 6 weeks experienced higher activity levels, more anger or irritability and poorer orienting later in infancy. Children with the lowest ventricular volumes scored on average 0.15 (95% confidence interval 0.06-0.23, p = 0.001) points higher (23%) on activity levels than children with the highest ventricular volumes. CONCLUSION: Variations in ventricular size before and shortly after birth are associated with temperamental difficulties. Some of the morphologic differences between children with and without psychiatric disorders may develop very early in life.",M2
18768110,"Microanatomical evidences for potential of mesenchymal stem cells in amelioration of striatal degeneration.Huntington's disease is an inherited neurodegenerative disorder, characterized by loss of spiny neurons in the striatum and cortex, which usually happens in the third or fourth decades of life. In advanced form of the disease, progressive striatum atrophy happens and medium spiny neurons, which occupy more than 80% of the striatum, become atrophic. Gradually, the atrophy expands to the neocortex and other regions of the brain. To our knowledge, there is no effective therapeutic strategy for diminishing the motor disorders of Huntington's disease. In recent years, cellular transplantation has been an effective therapeutic method for neurodegenerative diseases. In the present study, the potential of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in amelioration of striatal degeneration was assessed in animal model of Huntington's disease. After unilateral lesion in striatum was caused by quinolinic acid (QA), bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells, which were isolated and purified from 4-6 weeks old rats, were transplanted into the damaged striatum. After 9 weeks of transplantation, the volume of striatum, lateral <e>ventricles</e> and hemispheres were measured in control (normal) and test (QA injected + cell transplanted) groups. After volume determination, the atrophy percentage of both striatum and damaged hemisphere and volume extension of lateral ventricles were calculated. Histologic results showed significant difference in amount of striatum atrophy between sham (only QA injected) and test groups. These results confirm the potential of bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells in treatment of microanatomical defects in motor disorders of Huntington's disease. According to our results, cell therapy by means of bone marrow derived adult stem cells could be considered as a good candidate for treatment of neurodegenerative diseases, especially Huntington's disease.",M2
18712664,"[Neurogenesis in the adult brain: from bench to bedside?]Two regions of the mammalian brain maintain the capability to generate new neurons throughout lifetime: Neuronal stem- and precursor cells proliferate in the subgranulare zone (SGZ) of the dentate gyrus in the hippocampus and in the subventricular zone (SVZ) of the lateral <e>ventricles</e> to give rise to new neurons that are functionally integrated into the neural network. The functional relevance of adult neurogenesis under physiological conditions on one hand, and the newly discovered potentiality of cellular regeneration in the diseased brain on the other hand, arouse the interest of fundamental and clinical neuroscientists. There is growing evidence that impaired adult neurogenesis is linked to the etiology of neuropsychiatric disorders (such as depression or Alzheimer's disease), as well as that the neurogenic potential may be used for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases (such as Parkinson's disease or stroke). This review summarizes the neurobiological bases of adult neurogenesis in their relevance for the future trend of novel therapeutic strategies.",M2
18687363,"Environmental enrichment alters locomotor behaviour and ventricular volume in Mecp2 1lox mice.Rett syndrome (RTT) is an autistic spectrum developmental disorder associated with mutations in the X-linked Mecp2 gene, and severe behavioural and neuropathological deficits. In a mouse model of RTT (Mecp2(1lox)), we examined whether environmental enrichment (EE) alters behavioural performance and regional brain volume. At weaning, Mecp2(1lox) and control mice were assigned to enriched or standard housing. From postnatal day 29 to 43, mice were subjected to behavioural tasks measuring motor and cognitive performance. At postnatal day 44, volumes of whole brain, cerebellum, <e>ventricles</e>, and motor cortex were measured using magnetic resonance imaging. EE provided subtle improvements to locomotor activity and contextual fear conditioning in Mecp2(1lox) mice. Additionally, EE reduced ventricular volumes, which correlated with improved locomotor activity, suggesting that neuroanatomical changes contribute to improved behaviour. Our results suggest that post-weaning EE may provide a non-invasive palliative treatment for RTT.",M2
18676530,"Cognitive function and brain structure in females with a history of adolescent-onset anorexia nervosa.OBJECTIVE: Abnormalities in cognitive function and brain structure have been reported in acutely ill adolescents with anorexia nervosa, but whether these abnormalities persist or are reversible in the context of weight restoration remains unclear. Brain structure and cognitive function in female subjects with adolescent-onset anorexia nervosa assessed at long-term follow-up were studied in comparison with healthy female subjects, and associations with clinical outcome were investigated. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Sixty-six female subjects (aged 21.3 +/- 2.3 years) who had a diagnosis of adolescent-onset anorexia nervosa and treated 6.5 +/- 1.7 years earlier in a tertiary care hospital and 42 healthy female control subjects (aged 20.7 +/- 2.5 years) were assessed. All participants underwent a clinical examination, magnetic resonance brain scan, and cognitive evaluation. Clinical data were analyzed first as a function of weight recovery (n = 14, &lt;85% ideal body weight; n = 52, &gt;or=85% ideal body weight) and as a function of menstrual status (n = 18, absent/irregular menses; n = 29, oral contraceptive pill; n = 19, regular menses). Group comparisons were made across structural brain volumes and cognitive scores. RESULTS: Compared with control subjects, participants with anorexia nervosa who remained at low weight had larger lateral <e>ventricles</e>. Twenty-four-hour urinary free-cortisol levels were positively correlated with volumes of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricles and negatively correlated with volumes of the hippocampi in clinical participants. Participants who were amenorrheic or had irregular menses showed significant cognitive deficits across a broad range of many domains. CONCLUSIONS: Female subjects with adolescent-onset anorexia nervosa showed abnormal cognitive function and brain structure compared with healthy individuals despite an extended period since diagnosis. To our knowledge, this is the first study to report a specific relationship between menstrual function and cognitive function in this patient population. Possible mechanisms underlying neural and cognitive deficits with anorexia nervosa are discussed. Additional examination of the effects of estrogen on cognitive function in female subjects with anorexia nervosa is necessary.",M2

18651281,"Models of the pulsatile hydrodynamics of cerebrospinal fluid flow in the normal and abnormal intracranial system.Images obtained from magnetic resonance imaging have helped to ascertain that both the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and brain move in a pulsatile manner within the cranium.

Understanding both the pressure and velocity flow field of CSF in the <e>ventricles</e> is important to help understand the mechanics of hydrocephalus. Four separate fluid structure interaction models of the ventricular system in the sagittal plane were created for this purpose. The first model was of a normal brain. The second and third models were pathological brain models with aqueductal stenosis at various locations along the fluid pathway. The fourth model was of a hydrocephalic brain. Results revealed the hydrodynamics of CSF pulsatile flow in the ventricles of these models. Most importantly, it has also revealed the different changes in CSF pulsatile hydrodynamics caused by the various locations of fluid flow obstructions.",M2
18622601,"Assessing ventricular size: is subjective evaluation accurate enough? New MRI-based normative standards for 19-year-olds.INTRODUCTION: To create new standards for radiological indices of dilated <e>ventricles</e> and to compare these with subjectively assessed ventricular size. METHODS: One hundred healthy controls (54 females), birth weight above 3,000 g, were followed throughout childhood as part of a longitudinal study of ex-prematures. All had a 3 Tesla brain magnetic resonance scan at age 17-20, and the following measurements were performed: biparietal and occipitofrontal diameters, width and depth of the frontal and occipital horns, diameter of the third ventricle and the frontal sub-arachnoid space. Ventricular size was judged subjectively by two neuroradiologists as being normal, or mildly, moderately or severely dilated. RESULTS: Head circumference was 31 mm higher for males than for females (95% confidence interval (CI) 25-28, p &lt; 0.001). Similar, ventricular size except for the depth of the right frontal horn was larger for male; however, the observed differences were partly accounted for by the larger head circumference. Normative sex specific standards for different cerebral measurements were presented as mean and ranges and additional 2.5, 10, 50, 90, 97.5 percentiles. The mean depth of the left ventricle was larger than the right for males, with an observed difference of 0.6 mm in male (95% CI 0.2-0.9, p = 0.005). The mean width of the left ventricle was larger than the right for females, with an observed difference of 0.4 mm in male (95% CI 0.1-0.7, p = 0.018). Two subjects were judged to have moderately and 36 to have mildly dilated ventricles by observer one, while figures for observer two were one and 14. Overall, the two observers agreed on 15 having either mild or moderate dilatation (kappa 0.43). For both sexes, the mean depth of the frontal horns as well as of the larger occipital horns differed significantly between the no dilatation and the mild/moderate dilatation groups. CONCLUSION: In our unselected cohort of healthy 19-year-olds, a high total of 14% was diagnosed to have dilated cerebral ventricles when subjectively assessed by an experienced neuroradiologist, underscoring the need for our new normative standards.",M2
18568545,"Rate of ventricular enlargement in multiple sclerosis: a nine-year magnetic resonance imaging follow-up study.BACKGROUND: In multiple sclerosis (MS), brain atrophy assessed by linear measurements of ventricular widths has been reported to be well correlated with three-dimensional (3D) measurements. Therefore, serial linear measurements with no need for advanced 3D evaluation may be proven to be robust markers of irreversible, destructive changes. PURPOSE: To evaluate the rate of supratentorial ventricular enlargement representing four decades of disease span. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 37 MS patients with disease duration at baseline ranging from 1 to 33 years were included. The mean time of the individual magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) follow-up was 9.25 years (range 7.3-10 years). Enlargement rate of the third and lateral <e>ventricles</e> was studied over time by applying three linear measurements on axial 5-mm T1-weighted MRI images. RESULTS: Progression of supratentorial ventricular widths during 9 years' follow-up was found. The mean annual width increase of the third ventricle was 0.20 mm (P&lt;0.001, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.15-0.25), for the frontal horn width 0.32 mm (P&lt;0.001, 95% CI 0.23-0.40), and increase of the intercaudate distance was 0.26 mm (P&lt;0.001, 95% CI 0.19-0.33). The association between these three measurements and disability status persisted at the time of follow-up. CONCLUSION: We found uniform ventricular enlargement progression during four decades of disease span, suggesting unchanging total brain atrophy progression over time.",M2

18534602,"Biomechanical modelling of normal pressure hydrocephalus.This study investigates the mechanics of normal pressure hydrocephalus (NPH) growth using a computational approach. We created a generic 3-D brain mesh of a healthy human brain and modelled the brain parenchyma as single phase and biphasic continuum. In our model, hyperelastic constitutive law and finite deformation theory described deformations within the brain parenchyma. We used a value of 155.77Pa for the shear modulus (mu) of the brain parenchyma. Additionally, in our model, contact boundary definitions constrained the brain outer surface inside the skull. We used transmantle pressure difference to load the model. Fully nonlinear, implicit finite element procedures in the time domain were used to obtain the deformations of the <e>ventricles</e> and the brain. To the best of our knowledge, this was the first 3-D, fully nonlinear model investigating NPH growth mechanics. Clinicians generally accept that at most 1mm of Hg transmantle pressure difference (133.416Pa) is associated with the condition of NPH. Our computations showed that transmantle pressure difference of 1mm of Hg (133.416Pa) did not produce NPH for either single phase or biphasic model of the brain parenchyma. A minimum transmantle pressure difference of 1.764mm of Hg (235.44Pa) was required to produce the clinical condition of NPH. This suggested that the hypothesis of a purely mechanical basis for NPH growth needs to be revised. We also showed that under equal transmantle pressure difference load, there were no significant differences between the computed ventricular volumes for biphasic and incompressible/nearly incompressible single phase model of the brain parenchyma. As a result, there was no major advantage gained by using a biphasic model for the brain parenchyma. We propose that for modelling NPH, nearly incompressible single phase model of the brain parenchyma was adequate. Single phase treatment of the brain parenchyma simplified the mathematical description of the NPH model and resulted in significant reduction of computational time.",M2
18524626,"Reprogramming of neonatal SVZ progenitors by islet-1 and neurogenin-2.The subventricular zone (SVZ) lining the lateral walls of the lateral <e>ventricles</e> is one of the major neurogenic areas in the postnatal brain. Precursor cells in the SVZ migrate via the rostral migratory stream to the olfactory bulb where they differentiate into neurons. Cell replacement strategies utilizing the recruitment of these endogenous progenitors and their progeny to different areas of the brain hold great promise for the future, but much research is needed in order to understand the sequence of molecular signals necessary to induce proliferation, migration and site-specific differentiation of these cells. In this study we show that the SVZ cells can be redirected from their normal migration route and directed towards other brain regions when they are infected with retroviruses encoding the developmentally important transcription factors Islet-1 and Neurogenin-2. After co-transduction with these transcription factors, transduced cells could be detected in several areas of the brain. When located in the striatum, the reprogrammed cells displayed neuroblast-like morphology. Once removed from the striatal parenchyma and allowed to further differentiation in vitro they developed into beta-III-tubulin positive neurons.",M2
18590438,"Nonlinear poroplastic model of ventricular dilation in hydrocephalus.OBJECT: The mechanism of ventricular dilation in normal-pressure hydrocephalus remains unclear. Numerical finite-element (FE) models of hydrocephalus have been developed to investigate the biomechanics of ventricular enlargement. However, previous linear poroelastic models have failed to reproduce the relatively larger dilation of the horns of the lateral <e>ventricles</e>. In this paper the authors instead elaborated on a nonlinear poroplastic FE model of the brain parenchyma and studied the influence of the introduction of these potentially more realistic mechanical behaviors on the prediction of the ventricular shape. METHODS: In the proposed model the elasticity modulus varies as a function of the distension of the porous matrix, and the internal mechanical stresses are relaxed after each iteration, thereby simulating the probable plastic behavior of the brain tissue. The initial geometry used to build the model was extracted from CT scans of patients developing hydrocephalus, and the results of the simulations using this model were compared with the real evolution of the ventricular size and shape in the patients. RESULTS: The authors' model predicted correctly the magnitude and shape of the ventricular dilation in real cases of acute and chronic hydrocephalus. In particular, the dilation of the frontal and occipital horns was much more realistic. CONCLUSIONS: This finding suggests that the nonlinear and plastic mechanical behaviors implemented in the present numerical model probably occur in reality. Moreover, the availability of such a valid FE model, whose mechanical parameters approach real mechanical properties of the brain tissue, might be useful in the further modeling of ventricular dilation at a normal pressure.",M2
18568547,"White matter abnormalities in children with idiopathic developmental delay.BACKGROUND: The underlying cause of developmental delay (DD) often remains unclear despite extensive clinical examination and investigations. Interference in normal development of the brain may result in DD. PURPOSE: To identify the prevalence of abnormalities on magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in idiopathic developmental delay. MATERIAL AND METHods: Of the 124 children referred for MR imaging with DD, 34 were excluded due to known history of progressive neurodevelopmental disorders, birth asphyxia, congenital CNS infections, metabolic disorder, chromosomal anomalies, and severe epileptic syndromes. The following structures were systematically reviewed: <e>ventricles</e>, corpus callosum, gray and white matter, limbic system, basal ganglia, brainstem, and cerebellum. RESULTS: Ten out of 90 (11%) were referred with DD only, whilst 80/90 (89%) were referred with DD and additional clinical findings, such as seizures, neurological deficit, and abnormal head size. Of the 90 patients, 14 (16%) had normal MR and 76 (84%) had abnormal MR findings. Abnormal ventricles were seen in 43/90 (48%); abnormal corpus callosum was identified in 40/90 (44%). Other MR findings included abnormalities in the white matter (23/90, 26%), hippocampi (5/90, 6%), cerebellum (5/90, 6%), and brainstem (4/90, 4%). CONCLUSION: Abnormalities of the ventricles and corpus callosum were identified in a large proportion of patients with idiopathic DD, indicative of changes in the white matter. Further studies using quantitative methods and diffusion tensor imaging are required to evaluate the white matter in these children.",M2
