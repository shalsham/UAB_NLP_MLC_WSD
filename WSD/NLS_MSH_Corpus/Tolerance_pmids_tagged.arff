20486469,"Comparison of vasorelaxant effect and <e>tolerance</e> profile of a novel isosorbide-5-mononitrate derivative with its stereoisomer and parent drug on rat mesenteric artery.BACKGROUND/AIMS: 5-Ketoximeisosorbide-2-mononitrate (50-IS-2-MN) was synthesized and its pharmacological and toxicological characteristics were examined and compared with its parent drug, isosorbide-5-mononitrate (IS-5-MN, CAS 16051-77-7), and its diastereoisomer 2-ketoximeisosorbide-5-mononitrate. METHODS: Vasorelaxation was studied on phenylephrine-precontracted rat superior mesenteric artery rings in organ bath procedure. In some rings, the endothelium was mechanically removed. In vitro tolerance was induced by treating the precontracted rings with maximal concentrations of the parent drug and the ketoximes, and after washing out, the procedure was repeated for two times. Furthermore, rats were treated with a single oral dose (1000 mg/kg) of 50-IS-2-MN and 20-IS-5-MN. RESULTS: After a phenylephrine-induced contraction, 50-IS-2-MN (10(-8)-10(-4) mol/l) caused a concentration-dependent relaxation of the rat superior mesenteric artery that was strongly potentiated after the removal of the vascular endothelium. In preparations with or without endothelium, 50-IS-2-MN was a more potent relaxant than either the parent compound or its isomer. The mechanism of the relaxant effect of 50-IS-2-MN involves the activated soluble guanylyl cyclase-cyclic GMP pathway. Hydralazine (10(-5) mol/l), a strong antioxidant, ameliorated tolerance to IS-5-MN, but did not affect the absence of tolerance to either ketoxime. The minimum lethal dose in rat for 5O-IS-2-MN and 20-IS-5-MN was greater than 1000 mg/kg. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the modification of the configuration at the ester carbon of IS-5-MN contributes to more potent and tolerance-devoid activity on the rat superior mesenteric artery.",M1
20481538,"Identification and functional characterization of a stable, centrally active derivative of the neurotensin (8-13) fragment as a potential first-in-class analgesic.The neurotensin hexapapetide fragment NT(8-13) is a potent analgesic when administered directly to the central nervous system but does not cross the blood-brain barrier. A total of 43 novel derivatives of NT(8-13) were evaluated, with one, ABS212 (1), being most active in four rat models of pain when administered peripherally. Compound 1 binds to human neurotensin receptors 1 and 2 with IC(50) of 10.6 and 54.2 nM, respectively, and <e>tolerance</e> to the compound in a rat pain model did not develop after 12 days of daily administration. When it was administered peripherally, serum levels and neurotensin receptor binding potency of 1 peaked within 5 min and returned to baseline within 90-120 min; however, analgesic activity remained near maximum for &gt;240 min. This could be due to its metabolism into an active fragment; however, all 4- and 5-mer hydrolysis products were inactive. This pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic dichotomy is discussed. Compound 1 is a candidate for development as a first-in-class analgesic.",M1
20453604,"Use of thalidomide for severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis: a multicenter cohort analysis.Severe recurrent aphthous stomatitis (SRAS) is a rare, disabling disorder of unknown etiology. Thalidomide is an effective second-line therapy for SRAS, but is suppressive rather than curative, and adverse events limit its use. Few reports describe the efficacy, <e>tolerance</e>, and safety of thalidomide, and how it is actually used as long-term (maintenance) therapy for SRAS. Therefore, we conducted this study to describe thalidomide use in the real-life management of a cohort of patients with SRAS. This multicenter retrospective cohort study covered a period of 5 years and 5 months (January 2003-May 2008). Patients who had started thalidomide monotherapy for SRAS during the 2003-2006 period were eligible. Data were collected from patients' medical charts and supplemented by patients' responses during a targeted telephone interview. Ninety-two patients followed at 14 centers were included: 76 had oral or bipolar aphthosis, and 16 had Beh√ßet disease. Thalidomide was rapidly effective: 85% (78/92) entered complete remission (CR) within a median of 14 days. Response time was independent of the initial thalidomide dose (r = 0.04). Thalidomide was continued for &gt; or =3 months (maintenance therapy) by 77/92 (84%) of the patients on 1 of 2 maintenance regimens: continuous therapy with regular intake (60/77) or intermittent therapy in response to attacks (17/77). Although intermittent therapy was less restrictive than continuous therapy, medical supervision under the former was less rigorous. The median maintenance dose was 100 mg/week, and did not reflect the initial dose (r = 0.18). The intermittent-treatment group's median dose was significantly lower and its median duration of thalidomide intake significantly longer than for patients on continuous therapy (19 vs. 150 mg/wk; p &lt; 0.0001, and 32 vs. 19 mo; p = 0.002, respectively). Adverse events were reported by 84% (77/92) of patients. They were mostly mild (78% of patients), but sometimes severe (21%). Nevertheless, after 40 months of follow-up, 60% of patients were still receiving continuous or intermittent maintenance therapy with favorable efficacy/tolerance ratios. Despite its retrospective nature, this detailed study provides novel information on the different ways thalidomide is used as SRAS maintenance therapy in a large and unselected cohort of patients. Low-dose maintenance regimens appear to be widely used, effective, and relatively well tolerated. These observations suggest the value of undertaking a randomized trial to assess various maintenance regimens.",M1
20437553,"How to design an opioid drug that causes reduced <e>tolerance</e> and dependence.Mu opioid receptor (MOR) agonists such as morphine are extremely effective treatments for acute pain. In the setting of chronic pain, however, their long-term utility is limited by the development of tolerance and physical dependence. Drug companies have tried to overcome these problems by simply  dialing up  signal transduction at the receptor, designing more potent and efficacious agonists and more long-lasting formulations. Neither of these strategies has proven to be successful, however, because the net amount of signal transduction, particularly over extended periods of drug use, is a product of much more than the pharmacokinetic properties of potency, efficacy, half-life, and bioavailability, the mainstays of traditional pharmaceutical screening. Both the quantity and quality of signal transduction are influenced by many regulated processes, including receptor desensitization, trafficking, and oligomerization. Importantly, the efficiency with which an agonist first stimulates signal transduction is not necessarily related to the efficiency with which it stimulates these other processes. Here we describe recent findings that suggest MOR agonists with diminished propensity to cause tolerance and dependence can be identified by screening drugs for the ability to induce MOR desensitization, endocytosis, and recycling. We also discuss preliminary evidence that heteromers of the delta opioid receptor and the MOR are pronociceptive, and that drugs that spare such heteromers may also induce reduced tolerance.",M1
20425198,"The effect of morphine on glial cells as a potential therapeutic target for pharmacological development of analgesic drugs.Opioids have played a critical role in achieving pain relief in both modern and ancient medicine. Yet, their clinical use can be limited secondary to unwanted side effects such as <e>tolerance</e>, dependence, reward, and behavioral changes. Identification of glial-mediated mechanisms inducing opioid side effects include cytokine receptors, kappa-opioid receptors, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors, and the recently elucidated Toll-like receptors. Newer agents targeting these receptors such as AV411, MK-801, AV333, and SLC022, and older agents used outside the United States or for other disease conditions, such as minocycline, pentoxifylline, and UV50488H, all show varied but promising profiles for providing significant relief from opioid side effects, while simultaneously potentiating opioid analgesia.",M1
20413817,"<e>Tolerance</e> induced by non-opioid analgesic microinjections into rat's periaqueductal gray and nucleus raphe.Several lines of investigations have shown that the microinjection of non-opioid analgesics, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) in the midbrain periaqueductal gray matter (PAG) induces antinociception with some effects of tolerance. Our recent findings also have shown the same effects of tolerance in intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections of analgin (metamizol), ketorolac, and xefocam. Moreover, just recently, we have shown that microinjection of three NSAIDs analgin, ketorolac and xefocam into the central nucleus of amygdala produces tolerance to these drugs and cross-tolerance to morphine. The present study was designed to examine whether together with analgin, microinjection of another type of NSAIDs clodifen, ketorolac and xefocam into the PAG and the nucleus raphe magnus (NRM) leads to the development of tolerance in male rats. The experiments were carried out on experimental and control (with saline) white male rats by the models of tail-flick (TF, to the stimulation of focusing light beam) and hot plate (HP, paw withdrawal) tests. For microinjections of NSAIDs stainless steel guide cannula was implanted into the PAG and NRM by the stereotaxic atlas. Latency increase of these reflexes indicated the degree of antinociception. Analysis of variance with post-hoc Dunnet Multiple Comparison Test were used for statistical evaluations. Our study showed that microinjection of NSAIDs into the PAG produced antinociception as revealed by a latency increase in TF and HP compared to the baseline control with saline microinjected into the same nucleus. However, when these drugs microinjection subsequent testing also took place in the following days the antinociceptive effects progressively diminished so that on the 4th and especially the 5th experimental days the TF and HP latencies were similar to the averaged control baseline for rats that received repeated (5 days) injections of only saline. On the 5th day, one hour after of NSAIDs testing, experimental groups of rats received i.p. injections of mu-opioid antagonist naloxone and we did not reveal significant alterations in TP and HP latencies in non-opioid tolerant rats as well as in control animals. Microinjections of NSAIDs into the NRM also produced antinociception as revealed by a latency increase in TF and HP compared to the baseline control of as in intact rats so with saline microinjected ones into the same nucleus. Subsequent NSAIDs microinjections caused progressively less antinociception, so by day 4 there was no effect, similar to saline microinjections (baseline control) for both the TF and the HP tests, except analgin. The later did not show complete tolerance even on the 5th experimental day. Special control experiments showed that post-treatment with naloxone in RVM diminished NSAID-induced antinociception on the first and second experimental days and impeded the development of tolerance to the antinociceptive effect of NSAIDs. Obtained results underscore the strong convergence of antinociceptive mechanisms of opioids and non-opioids, particularly NSAIDs in the PAG-RVM downstream circuit in the acute effect of and the development of tolerance to both types of analgesics. On the other hand, our data confirm the results of other authors that NSAIDs are in close relation with endogenous opioids and the tolerance to these non-opioid drugs probably depends on opioid tolerance.",M1
20403936,"<e>Tolerance</e> and withdrawal from prolonged opioid use in critically ill children.OBJECTIVE: After prolonged opioid exposure, children develop opioid-induced hyperalgesia, tolerance, and withdrawal. Strategies for prevention and management should be based on the mechanisms of opioid tolerance and withdrawal. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Relevant manuscripts published in the English language were searched in Medline by using search terms  opioid,   opiate,   sedation,   analgesia,   child,   infant-newborn,   tolerance,   dependency,   withdrawal,   analgesic,   receptor,  and  individual opioid drugs.  Clinical and preclinical studies were reviewed for data synthesis. RESULTS: Mechanisms of opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance suggest important drug- and patient-related risk factors that lead to tolerance and withdrawal. Opioid tolerance occurs earlier in the younger age groups, develops commonly during critical illness, and results more frequently from prolonged intravenous infusions of short-acting opioids. Treatment options include slowly tapering opioid doses, switching to longer-acting opioids, or specifically treating the symptoms of opioid withdrawal. Novel therapies may also include blocking the mechanisms of opioid tolerance, which would enhance the safety and effectiveness of opioid analgesia. CONCLUSIONS: Opioid tolerance and withdrawal occur frequently in critically ill children. Novel insights into opioid receptor physiology and cellular biochemical changes will inform scientific approaches for the use of opioid analgesia and the prevention of opioid tolerance and withdrawal.",M1
20400730,"The role of injection cues in the production of the morphine preexposure effect in taste aversion learning.The attenuation of an LiCl-induced conditioned taste aversion (CTA) by LiCl preexposure is mediated primarily by associative blocking via injection-related cues. Given that preexposure to morphine attenuates morphine-induced CTAs, it was of interest to determine whether injection cues also mediate this effect. Certain morphine-induced behaviors such as analgesic <e>tolerance</e> are controlled associatively, via injection-related cues. Accordingly, animals in the present experiments were preexposed to morphine (or vehicle) every other day for five total exposures, followed by an extinction phase, in which the subjects were given saline injections (or no treatment) for 8 (Experiment 1) or 16 (Experiment 2) consecutive days. All of the animals then received five CTA trials with morphine (or vehicle). The morphine-preexposed animals in Experiment 1 displayed an attenuation of the morphine CTA that was unaffected by extinction saline injections, suggesting that blocking by injection cues during morphine preexposure does not mediate this effect. All of the morphine-preexposed subjects in Experiment 2 displayed a weakened preexposure effect, an effect inconsistent with a selective extinction of drug-associated stimuli. The attenuating effects of morphine preexposure in aversion learning are most likely controlled by nonassociative mechanisms, like drug tolerance.",M1
20397799,"The abuse potential of propofol.CONTEXT: Propofol is a sedative-hypnotic prescription medication that is widely used in anesthesia, long-term sedation, and conscious sedation. It is short acting, effective, and, when used appropriately, safe. It is not a controlled substance by the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration, suggesting that it has little potential for abuse. The objective of this review was to evaluate the evidence for the abuse potential of propofol. METHODS: A systematic review of the medical literature was performed using the search terms: propofol, Diprivan, abuse, addiction, <e>tolerance</e>, misuse, and withdrawal. Six online literature citation databases and relevant bibliographies were searched for articles. RESULTS: Seventy-two articles were identified for review and 45 were relevant to the topic. These articles described propofol's biochemical and pharmacokinetic mechanisms of action that lend themselves to its abuse, propofol's physical and psychological effects that make it alluring as a recreational drug, the current evidence supporting the possibility of tolerance to and withdrawal from propofol, the risk involved in recreational propofol use, and the evidence supporting current abuse of this medication. We found evidence to support propofol's abuse potential from a pharmacological and experiential standpoint with multiple reports describing tolerance, dependence, withdrawal phenomena, abuse, and death from recreational use. CONCLUSIONS: Propofol has alluring and addictive properties that lend itself to potential recreational abuse and dependence. We recommend that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration and other international agencies should consider regulating propofol as a controlled substance.",M1
20363700,"Buspirone attenuates <e>tolerance</e> to analgesic effect of morphine in mice with skin cancer.Adjuvant drugs that can delay tolerance to morphine analgesia may lead to improved management of pain in chronic disease such as cancer. This study was aimed to investigate effect of buspirone, as a partial agonist of 5-HT1A receptor, on tolerance induced to morphine analgesic effect in animals with skin cancer. Study was carried on female Swiss albino mice. For skin tumorigensis, mice were treated with single dose of 7,12-dimethylbenz(a)anthracene (DMBA) and promoted by multiple dose of croton oil. Tolerance to morphine analgesia was induced by daily subcutaneous (sc) injection of morphine (5mg/kg for 30 days) and assayed by using the hot plate method. Results obtained from this study showed that pain threshold in mice with skin cancer were significantly lower. Tolerance to analgesic effect of morphine (5 mg/kg, sc) was appeared at day 15, whereas, in normal and skin tumor bearing mice co-treated daily with morphine (5 mg/kg, sc) and three different intraperitoneal (ip) doses of buspirone (5, 7.5 and 10 mg/kg) tolerance was observed at days 25 and 30. In conclusion our data indicate that concurrent use of morphine with buspirone may produce good cancer pain control and attenuate development of tolerance.",M1
20363694,"The intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of W-7, a calmodulin inhibitor, attenuates the development of morphine <e>tolerance</e> in rats.The present study was performed to determine the effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) administration of W-7, a specific calmodulin inhibitor, on the development of tolerance to antinociceptive effect morphine administration. This study was carried out on male wistar rats, weighing 200-250 g. Morphine was administered daily (15 mg/kg for 8 days). The threshold to thermal nociceptive stimuli was measured by tail-flick test. W-7 (0.25, 0.5 and 1 micromol/rat) was injected through ICV. Maximal possible effect percentage (MPE %) was considered as analgesia index. Our result showed that chronic morphine exposure induced tolerance to its antinociceptive effect and administration of W-7 (0.5 and 1 micromol/rat) decreased the development of tolerance to it. In conclusion these data showed that chronic injection of W-7 inhibited the development of morphine tolerance which indicates that calmodulin and its dependent pathways may play a role in the morphine tolerance processes.",M1
20357116,"Shared mechanisms for opioid <e>tolerance</e> and a transition to chronic pain.Clinical pain conditions may remain responsive to opiate analgesics for extended periods, but such persistent acute pain can undergo a transition to an opiate-resistant chronic pain state that becomes a much more serious clinical problem. To test the hypothesis that cellular mechanisms of chronic pain in the primary afferent also contribute to the development of opiate resistance, we used a recently developed model of the transition of from acute to chronic pain, hyperalgesic priming. Repeated intradermal administration of the potent and highly selective mu-opioid agonist, [d-Ala(2),N-MePhe(4),gly-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO), to produce tolerance for its inhibition of prostaglandin E(2) hyperalgesia, simultaneously produced hyperalgesic priming. Conversely, injection of an inflammogen, carrageenan, used to produce priming produced DAMGO tolerance. Both effects were prevented by inhibition of protein kinase Cepsilon (PKCepsilon). Carrageenan also induced opioid dependence, manifest as mu-opioid receptor antagonist (d-Phe-Cys-Tyr-d-Trp-Orn-Thr-Pen-Thr-NH(2))-induced hyperalgesia that, like priming, was PKCepsilon and G(i) dependent. These findings suggest that the transition from acute to chronic pain, and development of mu-opioid receptor tolerance and dependence may be linked by common cellular mechanisms in the primary afferent.",M1
20350939,"The accuracy of the glucagon test compared to the insulin <e>tolerance</e> test in the diagnosis of adrenal insufficiency in young children with growth hormone deficiency.CONTEXT: The accuracy of the glucagon test in the diagnosis of central adrenal insufficiency in young children has not yet been definitively established. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate the diagnostic accuracy of the glucagon test as an alternative to the insulin tolerance test (ITT) in children with GH deficiency under 6 yr of age. DESIGN AND SETTING: This was a prospective study conducted in two Pediatric Endocrinology Centers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-eight children (median age, 4.2 yr) with GH deficiency confirmed by a peak GH to ITT and arginine less than 10 microg/liter were enrolled: 24 with normal hypothalamic-pituitary anatomy, seven with isolated anterior pituitary hypoplasia, and 17 with structural hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities at magnetic resonance imaging. Twelve subjects had central adrenal insufficiency defined by a peak cortisol response of less than 20 microg/dl to ITT. All children underwent a glucagon stimulation test with blood sampling for cortisol and glucose (time 0 to 180 min) after the im administration of 30 microg/kg of glucagon. RESULTS: The mean peak cortisol after glucagon was not significantly different from that obtained after ITT in the whole cohort (25.9 vs. 26.0 microg/dl; P = 0.908), and it was significantly reduced in patients with structural hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities (P &lt; 0.001). Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis showed that the best diagnostic accuracy was obtained with a peak cortisol cutoff to glucagon of 14.6 microg/dl (sensitivity, 66.67%; specificity, 100%; area under the curve = 0.91; 95% confidence interval, 0.82-0.99). Using this cutoff, 91.67% of the patients were correctly classified. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that glucagon is an accurate and safe diagnostic test for adrenal function in young children who are at risk for adrenal insufficiency.",M1
20329367,"Effects of daily chlorpromazine administration on behavioural and physiological parameters in the rat.Chlorpromazine is a classical neuroleptic drug which produces both therapeutic effects as well as unwanted side effects in human such as sedation, autonomic, endocrine and neurological effects. It is thought that blockade of dopamine D-2 receptors caused by chlorpromazine induces these untoward side effects. Pre-clinical studies on catalepsy has been proposed as an animal model for neuroleptic induced extrapyramidal side effects. The drug also blocks certain stereotypic behaviours in animals induced by dopamine agonists such as apomorphine and amphetamine. These stereotypic behaviours are circling, chewing, rearing, grooming and hyperactivity. Daily administration of chlorpromazine (1, 3 and 10 mg/kg, i.p) to rats for 21 days induced catalepsy, <e>tolerance</e> to catalepsy and locomotor sensitization following PCP (10 mg/kg, i.p) challenge. These results suggest that daily chlorpromazine treatment induced DA/NMDA-receptor sensitization to total locomotor activity following PCP challenge. Furthermore, there were no changes in other behavioural parameters assessed. Surprisingly daily chlorpromazine administration in rats also produced no changes in other physiological parameters assessed (body weight, food and water intake).",M1
20309530,"Rapid development of <e>tolerance</e> to sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine: an oculomotor study in macaque monkeys.BACKGROUND: Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D: -aspartic acid antagonist, has been widely used for anaesthetic purposes. At sub-anaesthetic dosage, it induces a dissociative state similar to schizophrenia. The discovery of this effect on dissociative state has led to its use as a pharmacological model of schizophrenia and has also been responsible for its illegal use as a recreational drug. Whereas the former has provided invaluable information, the latter has demonstrated that repeated administration of ketamine induces tolerance. Surprisingly, a review of the relevant literature shows that tolerance to sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine is largely unreported in neuropharmacological studies. METHODS: In order to investigate this caveat, we have performed a post hoc analysis of the behavioural effects induced by repeated injections of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine observed in five consecutive monkeys performing two oculomotor tasks. Ketamine effects were quantified by the animals' performances and latencies in a prosaccade and an antisaccade task, two oculomotor paradigms that are impaired after ketamine administration. RESULTS: Although the result of the initial injections confirmed a clear behavioural effect of ketamine injections in all monkeys, subsequent administrations showed that a tolerance eventually appeared in all monkeys. The profile of this tolerance exhibited however a large inter-subject variability. CONCLUSIONS: Psychopharmacological experiments using ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis should therefore consider the kinetic and time course of these effects in each individuals and take them into account in the design of experimental protocols.",M1
20300871,"Zinc <e>tolerance</e> and uptake by Arabidopsis halleri ssp. gemmifera grown in nutrient solution.BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: Zinc is an essential micronutrient element but its concentrations found in contaminated soils frequently exceed those required by the plant and soil organisms, and thus create danger to animal and human health. Phytoremediation is a technique, often employed in remediation of contaminated soils, which aims to remove heavy metals or other contaminants from soils or waters using plants. Arabidopsis (A.) halleri ssp. gemmifera is a plant recently found to be grown vigorously in heavy metal contaminated areas of Japan and it contained remarkably high amount of heavy metals in its shoots. However, the magnitude of Zn accumulation and tolerance in A. halleri ssp. gemmifera need to be investigated for its use as a phytoremediation plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A. halleri ssp. gemmifera was grown for 3 weeks into half-strength nutrient solution with Zn (as ZnSO(4)) levels ranging from 0.2 to 2,000 microM. The harvested plants were separated into shoots and roots, dried in the oven, and ground. The plant tissue was digested with nitric-perchloric acid, and the Zn concentration in the digested solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results showed no reduction in shoot and root dry weight when plants were grown at 0.2 to 2,000 microM Zn in the solution. The highest Zn concentration measured in the shoots was 26,400 mg kg(-1) at 1,000 microM Zn, while in the roots, it was 71,000 mg kg(-1) at 2,000 microM Zn treatment. Similar to the Zn concentration in plant parts, maximum Zn accumulation of 62 mg plant(-1) in the shoots and 22 mg plant(-1) in the roots was obtained at 1,000 and 2,000 microM Zn in the solution. The percentage of Zn translocation in shoot varied from 69% to 90% of the total Zn, indicating that the shoot was the major sink of Zn accumulation in this plant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the growth of A. halleri ssp. gemmifera was not affected by the Zn level of up to 2,000 microM in the nutrient solution. The concentration of Zn found in shoot indicated that A. halleri ssp. gemmifera has an extraordinary ability to tolerate and accumulate Zn and hence a good candidate for the phytoremediation of Zn-polluted soil. RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTLOOK: Based on the results presented in this study and earlier hydroponics, and field study, A. halleri ssp. gemmifera seems to be a potential heavy metals hyperaccumulator, and could be recommended to use for phytoremediation of Cd- and Zn-contaminated soils.",M1
20298725,"Strain improvement of the pentose-fermenting yeast Pichia stipitis by genome shuffling.Genome shuffling based on cross mating was used to improve the <e>tolerance</e> of the pentose-fermenting yeast Pichia stipitis towards hardwood spent sulphite liquor (HW SSL). Six UV-induced mutants of P. stipitis were used as the starting strains, and they were subjected to 4 rounds of genome shuffling. After each round, improved strains were selected based on their growth on HW SSL gradient plates. Mutant libraries were established after each round and these improved mutant strains served as the starting pool for the next round of shuffling. Apparent tolerance to HW SSL on the gradient plate increased progressively with each round of shuffling up to 4 rounds. Selected improved mutants were further tested for tolerance to liquid HW SSL. After 4 rounds of shuffling, 4 mutants, two from the third round (designated as GS301 and GS302) and two from the fourth round (designated as GS401 and GS402), were selected that could grow in 80% (v/v) HW SSL. GS301 and GS302 grew also in 85% (v/v) HW SSL. GS301 was viable in 90% (v/v) HW SSL, although no increase in cell number was seen. The P. stipitis wild type strain (WT) could not grow on HW SSL unless it was diluted to 65% (v/v) or lower. Genome-shuffled strains with improved tolerance to HW SSL retained their fermentation ability. Fermentation performance of GS301 and GS302, the 2 strains that exhibited the best tolerance to liquid HW SSL, was assessed in defined media and in HW SSL. Both strains utilized 4% (w/v) of xylose or glucose more efficiently and produced more ethanol than the WT. They also utilized 4% (w/v) of mannose or galactose and produced ethanol to the same extent as the WT. GS301 and GS302 were able to produce low levels of ethanol in undiluted HW SSL.",M1

20206145,"The kappa-opioid receptor is upregulated in the spinal cord and locus ceruleus but downregulated in the dorsal root ganglia of morphine tolerant rats.As a non-selective agonist of opioid receptors, morphine can also act on the kappa-opioid receptor (KOR) when activating the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) and delta-opioid receptor (DOR). Although previous findings indicate that KOR plays an important role in morphine analgesia and antinociceptive <e>tolerance</e>, the reasons for the paradoxical functions of KOR in analgesia and anti-analgesia responses are still unclear. The aim of this study was to explore the role of the KOR in morphine analgesia and antinociceptive tolerance. As such, the changes in KOR expression in different regions of the nervous system in morphine tolerant rats were examined. We were able to attain morphine tolerance in rats via subcutaneous injection of morphine (10 mg/kg) twice daily for 7-consecutive days. Competitive real-time PCR, immunohistochemistry, and Western blot analyses were used to assess KOR expression in related regions of the nervous system, including the thalamus, hypothalamus, hippocampus, locus ceruleus (LC), periaqueductal gray (PAG), lumber-sacral spinal cord, and dorsal root ganglia (DRG). The expression of KOR increased in the locus ceruleus and spinal cord, but was significantly decreased in the DRG of morphine tolerant rats (P&lt;0.05). No other significant changes in KOR expression were observed in the other regions. Consequently, we propose that the locus ceruleus and spinal cord are likely the dominant CNS regions and the DRG is the main peripheral site in which chronic morphine exerts its effect on KOR. Prolonged morphine administration induces inconsistent changes of KOR in the central and peripheral nervous system.",M1
20164830,"Differential regulation of behavioral <e>tolerance</e> to WIN55,212-2 by GASP1.Cannabinoid agonists have shown some promise clinically as analgesics, in particular for cancer pain, in which they have the additional benefit of decreasing nausea. However, as for most other drugs, the long-term use of cannabinoids is limited by the development of tolerance. Several molecular mechanisms have been proposed to explain drug tolerance, including receptor downregulation. The cannabinoid 1 (CB1) receptors can be downregulated in vitro through an interaction with the G-protein-coupled receptor-associated sorting protein1, GASP1, that targets CB1 receptors for degradation after their agonist-mediated endocytosis. To investigate whether GASP1-mediated postendocytic sorting of the CB1 receptor contributes to tolerance to cannabinoid drugs in vivo, we generated a mouse with a disruption of GASP1. In wild-type mice, repeated administration of the cannabinoid agonist WIN55,212-2 promoted downregulation of CB1 receptor levels and concomitant tolerance to the effects of drug on antinociception, motor incoordination, and locomotor hypoactivity. In contrast, GASP1 knockout mice did not develop tolerance to any of these effects and showed no significant receptor downregulation. Taken together, this study provides evidence that GASP1 regulates CB1 receptor downregulation in vivo, and that postendocytic receptor trafficking has a key role in the development of tolerance to WIN55,212-2.",M1
20113878,"Sensitization to social anxiolytic effects of ethanol in adolescent and adult Sprague-Dawley rats after repeated ethanol exposure.Ontogenetic studies using a social interaction paradigm have shown that adolescent rats are less sensitive to anxiolytic properties of acute ethanol than their adult counterparts. It is not known, however, whether adaptations to these anxiolytic effects on repeated experiences with ethanol would be similar in adolescents and adults. The present study investigated sensitivity to the anxiolytic effects of ethanol in adolescent and adult male and female Sprague-Dawley rats after 7 days of exposure (postnatal day [P] 27-33 for adolescents and P62-68 for adults) to 1g/kg ethanol or saline (intraperitoneally]) and in animals left nonmanipulated during this time. Anxiolytic effects of ethanol (0, 0.75, 1.0, 1.25, and 1.5g/kg for adolescents and 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0, and 1.25g/kg for adults in experiments 1 and 2, respectively) were examined 48h after the last exposure using a modified social interaction test under unfamiliar test circumstances. At both ages, repeated ethanol exposure resulted in the development of apparent sensitization to anxiolytic effects of ethanol, indexed by enhancement of social investigation and transformation of social avoidance into social indifference or preference and expression of <e>tolerance</e> to the socially inhibiting effects induced by higher ethanol doses. Evidence for the emergence of sensitization in adults and tolerance at both ages was seen not only after chronic ethanol but also after chronic saline exposure, suggesting that chronic manipulation per se may be sufficient to alter the sensitivity of both adolescents and adults to socially relevant effects of ethanol.",M1
20113637,"[Drugs and the mechanism for reversing the <e>tolerance</e> of flurazepan in rats]OBJECTIVE: Benzodiazepines (BDZ) have many effects on various kinds of epilepsies, but long-term treatment with BDZ often leads to drug tolerance. This study aimed to seek drugs which can reverse the tolerance of flurazepam (FZP), and to explore the role of neuropeptide Y (NPY) in the reversal effect. METHODS: A rat model of anticonvulsant tolerance to FZP was prepared. The rats with FZP tolerance were randomly assigned to seven groups: FZP-tolerance, and nifedipine, levetiracetam, topiramate, flumazenil, L-NAME and pyridoxamine treatment groups. The tolerance to FZP was evaluated through pentylenetetrazol (PTZ) infusion into a tail vein. The latency to onset of clonic seizure and the PTZ threshold were recorded. The mRNA of NPY receptor Y2 in the hippocampus was determined by RT-PCR, and the distribution of NPY in the hippocampus was examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In comparison with the blank control group, the average latency to the onset of clonic seizure was shortened, the average PTZ threshold decreased and the expression of NYT and NPY receptor Y2 mRNA decreased significantly in the FZP-tolerance group (p&lt;0.01). In comparison with the FZP-tolerance group, the average latency to onset of clonic seizure was prolonged by 2 times and the average PTZ threshold doubled in the topiramate treatment group. The average latency to onset of clonic seizure was prolonged by 1 time and the average PTZ threshold increased 1 time in the nifedipine, the levetiracetam and the flumazenil treatment groups. The mRNA expression of NPY receptor Y2 increased by 1 or 2 times in the flumazenil, the nifedipine and the topiramate treatment groups when compared with the FZP-tolerance group. CONCLUSIONS: Nifedipine, levetiracetam, topiramate and flumazenil can reverse the anticonvulsant tolerance to flurazepam. NPY may play a role in mediating the reversal effect.",M1
20086164,"Delineation of a bacterial starvation stress response network which can mediate antibiotic <e>tolerance</e> development.This study aimed at elucidating the physiological basis of bacterial antibiotic tolerance. By use of a combined phenotypic and gene knockout approach, exogenous nutrient composition was identified as a crucial environmental factor which could mediate progressive development of tolerance with markedly varied drug specificity and sustainability. Deprivation of amino acids was a prerequisite for tolerance formation, conferring condition-specific phenotypes against inhibitors of cell wall synthesis and DNA replication (ampicillin and ofloxacin, respectively), according to the relative abundances of ammonium salts, phosphate, and nucleobases. Upon further depletion of glucose, this variable phase consistently evolved into a sustainable mode, along with enhanced capacity to withstand the effect of the protein synthesis inhibitor gentamicin. Nevertheless, all phenotypes produced during spontaneous nutrient depletion lacked the sustainable, multidrug-tolerant features exhibited by the stationary-phase population and were attributed to complex interaction between starvation-mediated metabolic and stress protection responses on the basis of the following reasons: (i) the nutrition-dependent tolerance characteristics observed suggested that adaptive biosynthetic mechanisms could suppress but not fully avert tolerance under transient starvation conditions; (ii) formation of specific phenotypes could be inhibited by suppressing protein synthesis prior to nutrient depletion; (iii) bacteriostatic drugs produced only weak tolerance in the absence of starvation signals; and (iv) the attenuation of the stringent and SOS responses, as well as the functionality of other putative tolerance determinants, including rpoS, hipA, glpD, and phoU, could alter the induction requirement and drug specificity of the resultant phenotypes. These data reveal the common physiological grounds characteristic of starvation responses and the onset of antibiotic tolerance in bacteria.",M1
20083366,"Evaluation of a generic immunoassay with drug <e>tolerance</e> to detect immune complexes in serum samples from cynomolgus monkeys after administration of human antibodies.Current state of the art bridging ELISA technologies for detection of anti-drug antibodies (ADAs) against therapeutic antibodies bear the risk of false-negative results due to interference by circulating drug. Methods to remove the drug in the sample or sample pre-treatment techniques such as acid dissociation of the immune complexes are limited, laborious and may destroy ADAs resulting again in false-negative results. The immune complex ELISA described in this publication provides a simple solution. It is designed to analyze samples from cynomolgus monkeys dosed with human antibodies; it can be used for all human antibodies since it is independent of the specific antibody and its target. The generic applicability of the ADA assay is enabled by the use of (1) a murine anti-human Fc monoclonal antibody (MAb) as capture reagent; (2) a murine anti-cynomolgus monkey IgG MAb as detection reagent; and (3) an ADA positive control conjugate consisting of cynomolgus IgG complexed with human IgG. In its basic version, the generic ADA ELISA specifically detects only immune complexes formed in vivo. Validation of the ADA assay revealed a lower limit of quantitation of 15.6 ng/mL in serum samples. Intra-assay and inter-assay precision was characterized by a coefficient of variation of less than 10% and accuracy was within 8%. Matrix effects were low as evidenced by a mean recovery of 95%. In vitro pre-incubation of the serum samples with drug makes also the free ADA in the sample amenable to measurement by the immune complex ELISA as demonstrated by analysis of ADAs from two cynomolgus monkey studies with two different antibodies. The generic and versatile nature of this ADA assay favors its use in pilot pharmacokinetic and safety studies in cynomolgus monkeys during candidate selection of antibodies. The assay can help to explain unexpected drug clearance profiles, loss of efficacy or safety events caused by immune complexes and guide further development.",M1
20074809,"Nitrite and nitroglycerin induce rapid release of the vasodilator ATP from erythrocytes: Relevance to the chemical physiology of local vasodilation.Extracellular ATP released from circulating erythrocytes induces vasodilation by stimulating receptor-mediated endothelium NO/EDRF (endothelium-derived relaxing factor) production. We report that pre-stimulation of freshly isolated human erythrocytes with physiological nitrite (100 nM NO(2)(-)) or pharmacological nitroglycerin (10microM) concentrations resulted in &gt;200% spike in ATP release, which was detected on resuspending the cells in fresh medium. The observed response was instantaneous following NO(2)(-) pre-stimulation but a delay of approximately 20 s followed nitroglycerin pre-stimulation, reflecting the time required for prodrug activation within the erythrocyte to its vasoactive metabolites, NO(2)(-) and NO. The data provided here are consistent with ATP being a conveyor of a NO-induced vasodilatory signal from the erythrocyte to the endothelium. Extended erythrocyte pre-stimulation with the NO donors resulted in a dose-dependent decrease in extracellular ATP, which would attenuate the signal in intact vessels to prevent excessive vasodilation. Importantly, our study constitutes the first report of enhanced vasodilator (ATP) release following human erythrocyte pre-stimulation by an endogenous (NO(2)(-)) or pharmacological (nitroglycerin) NO donor. The relevance of our findings to the therapeutic effects of nitroglycerin as well as to nitrate <e>tolerance</e> is discussed.",M1
20070387,"Diminishing efficacy of combination therapy, response-heterogeneity, and treatment intolerance limit the attainability of tight risk factor control in patients with diabetes.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the attainability of tight risk factor control targets for three diabetes risk factors and to assess the degree of polypharmacy required. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey-III. STUDY DESIGN: We simulated a strategy of  treating to targets,  exposing subjects to a battery of treatments until low-density lipoprotein (LDL)-cholesterol (100 mg/dL), hemoglobin A1c (7 percent), and blood pressure (130/80 mm Hg) targets were achieved or until all treatments had been exhausted. Regimens included five statins of increasing potency, four A1c-lowering therapies, and eight steps of antihypertensive therapy. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: We selected parameter estimates from placebo-controlled trials and meta-analyses. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Under ideal efficacy conditions, 77, 64, and 58 percent of subjects achieved the LDL, A1c, and blood pressure targets, respectively. Successful control depended highly on a subject's baseline number of treatments. Using the least favorable assumptions of treatment <e>tolerance</e>, success rates were 11-17 percentage points lower. Approximately 57 percent of subjects required five or more medication classes. CONCLUSIONS: A significant proportion of people with diabetes will fail to achieve targets despite using high doses of multiple, conventional treatments. These findings raise concerns about the feasibility and polypharmacy burden needed for tight risk factor control, and the use of measures of tight control to assess the quality of care for diabetes.",M1
20067813,"Selective inhibition of the NOP receptor in the ventrolateral periaqueductal gray attenuates the development and the expression of <e>tolerance</e> to morphine-induced antinociception in rats.The ventrolateral periaqueductal gray (vlPAG) is a major site of opioid analgesic action and a key locus for the development of morphine tolerance. Previous experimental evidence supports the hypothesis that the brain synthesizes and secretes neuropeptides, which act as a part of the homeostatic system to attenuate the effects of morphine and endogenous opioid peptides. Among the known antiopioid peptides, nociceptin/orphanin FQ (N/OFQ) has been shown to inhibit various opioid effects, especially analgesia. The present study investigated the effect of NOP receptor blockade on the tolerance to morphine antinociception in the vlPAG. Systemic morphine (10mg/kg s.c. twice per day) induced an antinociceptive effect that diminished significantly on the third day when tolerance developed, as quantified by the tail flick and the hot plate tests. Intra vlPAG (i.vlPAG) administration of the NOP receptor antagonist (+/-)-J 113397 restored the opioid's analgesic effect. When (+/-)-J 113397 was administered beginning the first day preceding each morphine administration, tolerance did not develop, but it appeared if the NOP antagonist had been suspended. These data suggest that the N/OFQ in the vlPAG may play a key role in opioid-induced antinociceptive tolerance.",M1
20067500,"Transient improvement after brief antiepileptic drug withdrawal in the epilepsy monitoring unit--possible relationship to AED <e>tolerance</e>.PURPOSE: A drug holiday seems to produce seizure interval prolongation (SIP) after reinstitution of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). This effect was demonstrated mainly with carbamazepine. We evaluated SIP with newer AEDs and tested the relationship of SIP to history of AED tolerance. METHODS: We prospectively studied patients with refractory epilepsy admitted to the Vanderbilt epilepsy monitoring unit (EMU) over a period of 12 months. We included only patients on levetiracetam, lamotrigine, or oxcarbazepine who had their AEDs withdrawn on admission and reinstituted without change upon discharge. We defined SIP as the interval from EMU discharge to first seizure minus the interval between the last two seizures before EMU admission. RESULTS: A total of 43 patients completed the study; 15 were on monotherapy. SIP was greater than zero in this patient group (p &lt; 0.0001), with a mean prolongation of 19.4 +/- 28.0 days. The average SIP was higher (p = 0.01) in patients on monotherapy (29.7 +/- 23.8 days) than patients on polytherapy (13.9 +/- 29.0 days). SIP tended to be greater in patients with a prior history of AED tolerance (25.7 +/- 36.8 days) compared to patient with no prior history of AED tolerance (14.0 +/- 16.3 days). DISCUSSION: SIP does occur after brief AED withdrawal. This effect is greater in patients on monotherapy and tends to be larger in patients with a history of AED tolerance. The SIP effect may be related to the phenomenon of tolerance, clinically seen as resistance to AED therapeutic effect.",M1
20058604,"[Expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 in spinal cord of morphine tolerant rats]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the expression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluRS) in spinal cord of morphine tolerant rats and understand the influence of mGluR5 antagonist MPEP upon the expression of mGluRS. METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into four groups with 8 rats each:control group (NS), morphine group, morphine plus MPEP group and MPEP group. A morphine <e>tolerance</e> model of rat was established by repeated administration of 10 microg morphine intrathecally twice daily for 7 days. The effects of morphine co-administrated with MPEP upon the thermal pain threshold were examined by tail flick test. Tail flick latency (TFL) was measured at 30 min pre- and postdosing. MPE% (percentage of maximal possible effect) was calculated by the equation: MPE (%) = [(test response time-basal response time)/(cut-off time-basal response time)] x 100%. The rats were sacrificed and L4-5 spinal cord tissue was removed. The expression of mGluR5 in every group was examined by immunofluorescence and Western blot. RESULTS: MPE% of morphine group decreased gradually after chronic administration of morphine intrathecally. There was no significant difference between morphine group and control group at Day 7 (P &gt; 0.05). Morphine plus MPEP group had significant analgesic effect as compared with morphine group at Day 7 (P &lt; 0.05). The expression of mGluR5 was up-regulated in the dorsal horn of spinal cord in morphine tolerant rats. The protein level of mGluRS in morphine plus MPEP group was lower than that in morphine group (P &lt; 0.05), but higher than control group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The mGluR5 antagonist MPEP can prevent the development of morphine tolerance. The expression of mGluR5 protein increases in the spinal cord of morphine tolerant rats. MPEP plays its role in morphine tolerance by partly inhibiting the expression of mGluRS.",M1
20050852,"Quercetin and its major metabolites selectively modulate cyclic GMP-dependent relaxations and associated <e>tolerance</e> in pig isolated coronary artery.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Quercetin is a major flavonoid that contributes to the reduced risk of cardiovascular disease associated with dietary ingestion of fruits and vegetables. We have pharmacologically characterized the effect of quercetin, and its sulphate and glucuronide metabolites, on vasoconstrictor and vasodilator responses in the porcine isolated coronary artery. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Segments of the porcine coronary artery were prepared for either isometric tension recording or determination of cyclic GMP content. The effect of quercetin and metabolites on submaximal responses to U46619 was examined in the presence and absence of substance P, bradykinin, forskolin, sodium nitroprusside (SNP) and glyceryl trinitrate (GTN). KEY RESULTS: Quercetin and quercetin 3'-sulphate inhibited endothelin and U46619-induced contractions with greater potency (three- to fivefold) against the former, while quercetin 3-glucoronide was inactive. Quercetin enhanced both the cyclic GMP content of the artery (threefold) and cyclic GMP-dependent relaxations to GTN and SNP (two to threefold), but forskolin-induced relaxations were unaffected. Although the effect of quercetin was qualitatively similar to that noted for UK-114,542, a selective inhibitor of phosphodiesterase 5, it was still evident against SNP-induced relaxations in the presence of 10 nM UK-114,542. Quercetin and quercetin 3'-sulphate significantly reduced the development of GTN-associated 'tolerance'. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Quercetin and quercetin 3'-sulphate inhibited receptor-mediated contractions of the porcine isolated coronary artery by an endothelium-independent action. Quercetin selectively enhanced cyclic-GMP-dependent relaxations by a mechanism not involving phosphodiesterase 5 inhibition. In addition, quercetin and quercetin 3'-sulphate opposed GTN-induced tolerance in vitro, which may be beneficial for patients treated for angina pectoris.",M1
20035744,"Non-opioid <e>tolerance</e> in juvenile and adult rats.It has recently been shown that antinociceptive tolerance develops by repeated systemic administration of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) metamizol and lysine-acetylsalicylate. This is similar to the tolerance observed with opioid-induced analgesia [Vanegas and Tortorici, 2002, Cell and Mol. Neurobiol. 22, 655-661]. In the present study, we investigated the development of tolerance to the analgesic effects of the additional NSAIDs analgine, ketorolac and xefocam in juvenile and adult rats. After injection of each drug, tail-flick latencies were significantly elevated on the first day followed by a progressive decrease in tail-flick latency (i.e., tolerance) over the 5-day period, as well as cross-tolerance to morphine-induced analgesia. Tolerance to the analgesic effect of all three NSAIDs developed more rapidly in juvenile compared to adult rats. Pretreatment with naloxone completely prevented the analgesic effects of these drugs in tail-flick and hot plate tests for both juvenile and adult rats. Moreover, each NSAID exhibited cross-tolerance when tolerance to morphine had been induced by systemic morphine delivered repeatedly over 5-day period in both age groups. Our data confirm other recent findings that tolerance to the analgesic action of NSAIDs may depend on an opiate-mediated mechanism.",M1
20008489,"The effect of protein kinase C and G protein-coupled receptor kinase inhibition on <e>tolerance</e> induced by mu-opioid agonists of different efficacy.Differences in the mechanisms underlying tolerance and mu-opioid receptor desensitization resulting from exposure to opioid agonists of different efficacy have been suggested previously. The objective of this study was to determine the effects of protein kinase C (PKC) and G protein-coupled receptor kinase (GRK) inhibition on antinociceptive tolerance in vivo to opioid agonists of different efficacy. A rapid (8-h) tolerance-induction model was used where each opioid was repeatedly administered to naive mice. Animals were then challenged with the opioid after injection of a kinase inhibitor to determine its effects on the level of tolerance. Tolerance to meperidine, morphine, or fentanyl was fully reversed by the PKC inhibitor 12-(2-cyanoethyl)-6,7,12,13-tetrahydro-13-methyl-5-oxo-5H-indolo(2,3-a)pyrrolo(3,4-c)carbazole (G√∂6976). However, in vivo tolerance to [d-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin (DAMGO) was not reversed by PKC inhibition. The novel small-molecule GRK inhibitors beta-adrenergic receptor kinase 1 inhibitor and 2-(8-[(dimethylamino) methyl]-6,7,8,9-tetrahydropyridol[1,2-a]indol-3-yl)-3-(1-methylindol-3-yl)maleimide (Ro 32-0432) did not reverse the tolerance to meperidine, fentanyl, or morphine but did reverse the tolerance to DAMGO. To correlate GRK-dependent DAMGO-induced tolerance with mu-opioid receptor desensitization, we used in vitro whole-cell patch-clamp recording from mouse locus coeruleus neurons and observed that the GRK inhibitors reduced DAMGO-induced desensitization of mu-opioid receptors, whereas the PKC inhibitor had no effect. These results suggest that tolerance induced by low- and moderate-efficacy mu-opioid receptor agonists is dependent on PKC, whereas tolerance induced by the high-efficacy agonist DAMGO is dependent on GRK.",M1

20004338,"The effects of acute and chronic ethanol exposure on presynaptic and postsynaptic gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons.Decades after ethanol was first described as a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) mimetic, the precise mechanisms that produce the acute effects of ethanol and the physiological adaptations that underlie ethanol <e>tolerance</e> and dependence remain unclear. Although a substantial body of evidence suggests that ethanol acts on GABAergic neurotransmission to enhance inhibition in the central nervous system, the precise mechanisms underlying the physiological effects of both acute and chronic ethanol exposure are still under investigation. We have used in vitro ethanol exposure followed by recording of miniature inhibitory postsynaptic currents (mIPSCs) to determine whether acute or chronic ethanol exposure directly alters synaptic GABA(A) receptor (GABA(A)R) function or GABA release in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons. Acute ethanol exposure slightly increased the duration of mIPSCs in hippocampal neurons but did not alter mIPSC kinetics in cortical neurons. Acute ethanol exposure did not change mIPSC frequency in either hippocampal or cortical neurons. One day of chronic ethanol exposure produced a transient decrease in mIPSC duration in cortical neurons but did not alter mIPSC kinetics in hippocampal neurons. Chronic ethanol exposure did not change mIPSC frequency in either hippocampal or cortical neurons. Chronic ethanol exposure also did not produce substantial cross-tolerance to a benzodiazepine in either hippocampal or cortical neurons. The results suggest that ethanol exposure in vitro has limited effects on synaptic GABA(A)R function and action potential-independent GABA release in cultured neurons and that ethanol exposure in cultured cortical and hippocampal neurons may not reproduce all the effects that occur in vivo and in acute brain slices.",M1
20004063,"Beta-lactam antibiotic reduces morphine analgesic <e>tolerance</e> in rats through GLT-1 transporter activation.Glutamate transporter subtype 1 (GLT-1) activation is a promising - and understudied - approach for managing aspects of morphine tolerance caused by increased glutamatergic transmission. Identification of beta-lactam antibiotics as pharmaceuticals which activate GLT-1 transporters prompted us to hypothesize that repeated beta-lactam antibiotic (ceftriaxone) administration blocks development of tolerance to morphine antinociception through GLT-1 activation. Here, we injected rats with morphine (10mg/kg, s.c.) twice daily for 7 days to induce tolerance and used the hot-plate assay to determine antinociception on days 1, 4 and 7 of repeated morphine administration. Ceftriaxone and a selective GLT-1 transporter inhibitor dihydrokainate (DHK) were co-administered with morphine to determine if GLT-1 activation mediated the ceftriaxone effect. Tolerance was present on days 4 and 7 of repeated morphine administration. Ceftriaxone (50, 100 or 200mg/kg, i.p.) administration dose-dependently blocked development of morphine tolerance. DHK (10mg/kg, s.c.), administered 15 min before each morphine injection, prevented inhibition of morphine tolerance by ceftriaxone (200mg/kg, i.p.). These results identify an interaction between ceftriaxone and morphine in opioid-tolerant rats and suggest beta-lactam antibiotics preserve analgesic efficacy during chronic morphine exposure.",M1
20001286,"<e>Tolerance</e> and sensitization to the effects of cocaine use in humans: a retrospective study of long-term cocaine users in Philadelphia.In the effort to develop medications to combat addiction, researchers have developed models that attempt to describe the neurobiological process of cocaine dependence. It has not, however, yet been determined which of these models, if any, best fits the behaviors and experiences of patients. This project retrospectively evaluated changes in patients' experiences with cocaine over time in order to clarify the model that best fits clinical observations. In 2005 and 2007, 100 treatment-seeking, long-term cocaine users were recruited from an urban university-based treatment center in Philadelphia, PA, United States. Each participant was administered the  Cocaine History Questionnaire  which asked them to describe the initiation and escalation of their cocaine usage, changing reward perceptions, and effects of intoxication at certain points in their drug use careers. This data was then analyzed using repeated measures, examining the within subject differences in reported information over the time points. We found evidence that while the amount of drug used increases, self-reported euphoria decreases while negative symptoms associated with cocaine use also increase. The data provide preliminary evidence for the hedonic dysregulation model of addiction. Limitations and implications of the study are discussed in the conclusion.",M1
19951294,"Ethanol-regulated genes that contribute to ethanol sensitivity and rapid <e>tolerance</e> in Drosophila.BACKGROUND: Increased ethanol intake, a major predictor for the development of alcohol use disorders, is facilitated by the development of tolerance to both the aversive and pleasurable effects of the drug. The molecular mechanisms underlying ethanol tolerance development are complex and are not yet well understood. METHODS: To identify genetic mechanisms that contribute to ethanol tolerance, we examined the time course of gene expression changes elicited by a single sedating dose of ethanol in Drosophila, and completed a behavioral survey of strains harboring mutations in ethanol-regulated genes. RESULTS: Enrichment for genes in metabolism, nucleic acid binding, olfaction, regulation of signal transduction, and stress suggests that these biological processes are coordinately affected by ethanol exposure. We also detected a coordinate up-regulation of genes in the Toll and Imd innate immunity signal transduction pathways. A multi-study comparison revealed a small set of genes showing similar regulation, including increased expression of 3 genes for serine biosynthesis. A survey of Drosophila strains harboring mutations in ethanol-regulated genes for ethanol sensitivity and tolerance phenotypes revealed roles for serine biosynthesis, olfaction, transcriptional regulation, immunity, and metabolism. Flies harboring deletions of the genes encoding the olfactory co-receptor Or83b or the sirtuin Sir2 showed marked changes in the development of ethanol tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings implicate novel roles for these genes in regulating ethanol behavioral responses.",M1
19944533,"Cholecystokinin receptors mediate <e>tolerance</e> to the analgesic effect of TENS in arthritic rats.Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a treatment for pain that involves placement of electrical stimulation through the skin for pain relief. Previous work from our laboratory shows that repeated application of TENS produces analgesic tolerance by the fourth day and a concomitant cross-tolerance at spinal opioid receptors. Prior pharmacological studies show that blockade of cholecystokinin (CCK) receptors systemically and spinally prevents the development of analgesic tolerance to repeated doses of opioid agonists. We therefore hypothesized that systemic and intrathecal blockade of CCK receptors would prevent the development of analgesic tolerance to TENS, and cross-tolerance at spinal opioid receptors. In animals with knee joint inflammation (3% kaolin/carrageenan), high (100Hz) or low frequency (4Hz) TENS was applied daily and the mechanical withdrawal thresholds of the muscle and paw were examined. We tested thresholds before and after inflammation, and before and after TENS. Animals treated systemically, prior to TENS, with the CCK antagonist, proglumide, did not develop tolerance to repeated application of TENS on the fourth day. Spinal blockade of CCK-A or CCK-B receptors blocked the development of tolerance to high and low frequency TENS, respectively. In the same animals we show that spinal blockade of CCK-A receptors prevents cross-tolerance at spinal delta-opioid receptors that normally occurs with high frequency TENS; and blockade of CCK-B receptors prevents cross-tolerance at spinal mu-opioid receptors that normally occurs with low frequency TENS. Thus, we conclude that blockade of CCK receptors prevents the development of analgesic tolerance to repeated application of TENS in a frequency-dependent manner.",M1
19941886,"Adenosinergic system is involved in development of diazepam <e>tolerance</e> in mice.In the present study the effect of adenosinergic system on the development of diazepam tolerance to motor disturbances in mice was investigated. Diazepam tolerance was obtained by administration of diazepam at a dose of 5.0 mg/kg, s.c. for ten consecutive days. On the 1st and the 10th day of the experiment motor impairments were measured in two behavioural tests: rota-rod and chimney test. We showed that acute diazepam injection produced significant motor impairments in mice and that effect was decreased by repeated diazepam treatment, confirming the development of tolerance to the motor impairing effect of diazepam. We demonstrated that adenosine A(1) and/or A(2A) receptor agonists: CPA (0.025 and 0.05 mg/kg, i.p.), CGS 21680 (0.1 and 0.2 mg/kg, i.p.), NECA (0.005 and 0.01 mg/kg, i.p.) pretreatment with diazepam were able to attenuate the development of diazepam tolerance and adenosine receptor antagonists: DPCPX (1.0 and 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.), DMPX (3.0 and 6.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and caffeine (10.0 and 20.0mg/kg, i.p.) induced the opposite effect. The most apparent effects were obtained by non-selective agonist (NECA) and antagonist (caffeine) of adenosine receptors. We conclude that adenosinergic system plays an important role in mechanisms underlying the development of benzodiazepine tolerance.",M1
19939965,"Degradation of leucine zipper-positive isoform of MYPT1 may contribute to development of nitrate <e>tolerance</e>.AIMS: A depressed cGMP-dependent protein kinase (PKG) activity is implicated in nitrate tolerance. The present study determines whether the leucine zipper-positive (LZ+) isoform of myosin phosphatase target subunit 1 (MYPT1), a key target protein for PKG actions, is involved in the development of nitrate tolerance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Nitrate tolerance in in vitro preparations was obtained by a 24 h incubation with nitroglycerin (NTG). Nitrate tolerance in in vivo preparations was obtained by subcutaneous injection of mice with NTG, and the aortas were used. Protein levels of total MYPT1, MYPT1 (LZ+), PP1Cdelta, myosin light chain (MLC), and phosphorylated MLC were determined by Western blot analysis. Isometric vessel tension was determined by an organ chamber technique. Protein levels of MYPT1 (LZ+), but not of PP1Cdelta, were significantly reduced in in vitro and in vivo nitrate-tolerant arteries. The decrease in the MYPT1 (LZ+) protein level of coronary artery was also induced by a nitric oxide donor and a cGMP analogue, which was prevented by the inhibitors of soluble guanylyl cyclase and PKG. The decrease in MYPT1 (LZ+) protein levels was not affected by the inhibitor of protein synthesis, but was prevented by the inhibitors of proteasomes. The diminished inhibition of dephosphorylation of MLC as well as the attenuated relaxation of porcine coronary artery and mouse aorta to NTG was improved by proteasome inhibitors. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that a reduction in the protein level of MYPT1 (LZ+) is involved in nitrate tolerance. This may result in part from a proteasome-dependent degradation of MYPT1 (LZ+).",M1
19934882,"Modulation of morphine-induced antinociception in acute and chronic opioid treatment by ibudilast.BACKGROUND: Opioid analgesics are effective in relieving chronic pain, but they have serious adverse effects, including development of <e>tolerance</e> and dependence. Ibudilast, an inhibitor of glial activation and cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases, has shown potential in the treatment of neuropathic pain and opioid withdrawal. Because glial cell activation could also be involved in the development of opioid tolerance in rats, the authors studied the antinociceptive effects of ibudilast and morphine in different models of coadministration. METHODS: Antinociception was assessed using male Sprague- Dawley rats in hot plate and tail-flick tests. The effects of ibudilast on acute morphine-induced antinociception, induction of morphine tolerance, and established morphine tolerance were studied. RESULTS: Systemic ibudilast produced modest dose-related antinociception and decreased locomotor activity at the studied doses of 2.5-22.5 mg/kg. The highest tested dose of 22.5 mg/kg produced 52% of the maximum possible effect in the tail-flick test. It had an additive antinociceptive effect when combined with systemic morphine. Coadministration of ibudilast with morphine did not attenuate the development of morphine tolerance. However, in morphine-tolerant rats, ibudilast partly restored morphine-induced antinociception. CONCLUSIONS: Ibudilast produces modest antinociception, and it is effective in restoring but not in preventing morphine tolerance. The mechanisms of the effects of ibudilast should be better understood before it is considered for clinical use.",M1

Then, a secondary screening test was performed for COD (chemical oxygen demand) and TOC (total organic carbon) removal efficiency analyses. At last, the best mutant YWL-01 with increased capacity to treat saline wastewater was chosen for use. RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) analysis of genetic stability on the mutant YWL-01 showed that it is a hereditary mutant for the treatment of high-saline wastewater.",M1
19933412,"<e>Tolerance</e> to nitroglycerin-induced preconditioning of the endothelium: a human in vivo study.Damage and dysfunction of the vascular endothelium critically influence clinical outcomes after ischemia and reperfusion (I/R). Brief exposure to organic nitrates can protect the vascular endothelium from I/R injury via a mechanism that is similar to ischemic preconditioning and is independent of hemodynamic changes. The clinical relevance of these protective effects clearly depends on whether they can be sustained over time. Twenty-four healthy (age 25-32) male volunteers were randomized to receive 1) transdermal nitroglycerin (GTN; 0.6 mg/h) administered for 2 h on 1 day only, 2) transdermal GTN for 2 h/day for 7 days, or 3) continuous therapy with transdermal GTN for 7 days. Eight volunteers underwent continuous GTN therapy followed by intra-arterial infusion of the antioxidant vitamin C. Finally, five additional subjects underwent no therapy and served as controls. Endothelial function measurements were performed before and after induction of I/R of the arm. I/R caused a significant blunting of the flow responses to acetylcholine in the control group (P &lt; 0.01 vs. before I/R). A single 2-h GTN dosage, given 24 h before I/R, prevented I/R-induced endothelial dysfunction [P = not significant (NS) vs. before I/R], but this protective effect was completely lost after 1 wk of GTN administration 2 h/day (P &lt; 0.05 vs. before I/R; P = NS vs. control). In subjects who received continuous GTN, endothelial responses were blunted before I/R, and I/R did not cause further endothelial dysfunction. Finally, vitamin C normalized acetylcholine responses and prevented the loss of preconditioning associated with prolonged GTN. In a separate experimental model using isolated human endothelial cells, short-term incubation with GTN caused upregulation of heme oxygenase, an effect that was lost after prolonged GTN administration. Although a single administration of GTN is able to protect the endothelium from I/R-induced endothelial dysfunction, this protection is lost upon prolonged exposure, likely via an oxidative mechanism.",M1
19930722,"Attenuation by dextromethorphan on the higher liability to morphine-induced reward, caused by prenatal exposure of morphine in rat offspring.Co-administration of dextromethorphan (DM) with morphine during pregnancy and throughout lactation has been found to reduce morphine physical dependence and <e>tolerance</e> in rat offspring. No evidence was presented, however, for the effect of DM co-administered with morphine during pregnancy on morphine-induced reward and behavioral sensitization (possibly related to the potential to induce morphine addiction) in morphine-exposed offspring. Conditioned place preference and locomotor activity tests revealed that the p60 male offspring of chronic morphine-treated female rats were more vulnerable to morphine-induced reward and behavioral sensitization. The administration of a low dose of morphine (1 mg/kg, i.p.) in these male offspring also increased the dopamine and serotonin turnover rates in the nucleus accumbens, which implied that they were more sensitive to morphine. Co-administration of DM with morphine in the dams prevented this adverse effect of morphine in the offspring rats. Thus, DM may possibly have a great potential in the prevention of higher vulnerability to psychological dependence of morphine in the offspring of morphine-addicted mothers.",M1
19930266,"Drug effects: agonistic and antagonistic processes.The research presented here has shown that <e>tolerance</e> to drugs can be accelerated by conditioning processes. Placebo effects may be considered the opposite of tolerance, and we have shown that placebo effects may be objectively recorded by physiological measures (electromyography, skin conductance responses, and event-related potentials), as well as by behavioral and subjective methods. The placebo response, or more precisely, the expectation of drug effects, can add to the effect of the drug. Drug antagonistic expectations can also reverse the effect of the drug. There is some evidence that placebo effects are strongest when expectations are reinforced by administration of an active drug. Expectations have graded effects and may affect symptoms to a smaller or larger degree. Although drug effects can be considered stimuli, the investigation of the role of classical conditioning in drug use and drug effects involves special issues that must be carefully considered.",M1
19912256,"Differential effects of glucocorticoids in the establishment and maintenance of endotoxin <e>tolerance</e>.Gram-negative infections can result in endotoxic shock, which is the most common cause of death in intensive care units. Most of the undesirable effects in sepsis and septic shock have been ascribed to lipopolysaccharide (LPS), a normal constituent of the bacterial wall. The response to LPS involves rapid secretion of proinflammatory cytokines [tumour necrosis factor-alpha, interleukin (IL)-1, IL-6, IL-8, interferon-gamma] and the concomitant induction of anti-inflammatory mediators such as IL-10 and transforming growth factor-beta and glucocorticoids (GC), which render the host temporarily refractory to subsequent lethal doses of LPS challenge in a process known as LPS or endotoxin tolerance. Although protective from the development of sepsis or systemic inflammation, endotoxin tolerance has also been pointed out as the principal cause of the non-specific immunosuppression described in these patients. In this report we demonstrate, using a mouse model, that while the maintenance of tolerance is dependent upon GC, the establishment of tolerance by LPS could be inhibited by dexamethasone (Dex), a synthetic GC. Conversely, we demonstrated that mifepristone (RU486), a known GC receptor antagonist, was capable of inducing a transient and reversible disruption of endotoxin tolerance, also permitting partial restoration of the humoral immune response in LPS tolerant/immunosuppressed mice. These results are encouraging for the management of immunosuppression in sepsis and/or non-infectious shock, and deserve further investigation in the future.",M1
19896926,"Correlation of the time course of development and decay of <e>tolerance</e> to morphine with alterations in sodium pump protein isoform abundance.Since the heterologous tolerance that develops after chronic morphine administration has been proposed to be an adaptive process, it follows that the time course of the change in the cellular components should coincide with the time course of the altered responsiveness. This study correlated the time course over which heterologous tolerance develops with changes in the abundance of selected proteins in the guinea-pig longitudinal muscle/myenteric plexus (LM/MP) preparation. Tissues were obtained at various times following a single surgical implantation procedure and heterologous tolerance confirmed by a significant reduction in the sensitivity of the LM/MP to inhibition of neurogenic twitches by morphine, DAMGO, and 2-CADO. Tolerance developed with a delayed onset (significant 2-5-fold reduction in sensitivity by day 4 after pellet implantation) that reached a maximum by 7 days (4-8-fold reduction in responsiveness) that was maintained through 14 days with normal sensitivity spontaneously returning by 21 days post-implantation. Dot blot analysis was used to examine the abundance of the alpha(1) and alpha(3) subunit isoforms of the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase and beta-actin over the same time course. The results showed significant decreases in abundance of the alpha(3) subunit at 4, 7, and 10 days following pellet implantation but no change in beta-actin or the alpha(1) subunit at any time period. These data support the idea that heterologous tolerance following chronic morphine exposure results from a cellular adaptive change that may involve a change in the abundance of the alpha(3) subunit isoform of the Na(+)/K(+) ATPase.",M1

However, the enduring effects of MDMA at voluntary intake levels have not been extensively investigated. In this study, MDMA-influenced behaviors and core temperatures were assessed over the course of 20 daily MDMA self-administration sessions in rats. In vivo microdialysis techniques were used in a subsequent MDMA challenge test session to determine extracellular nucleus accumbens dopamine (NAcc DA) and serotonin (5-HT) levels in MDMA-experienced and na√Øve animals before and after a self-administered MDMA injection (3.0mg/kg, i.v.). During self-administration sessions, gradual and significant increases in MDMA intake and MDMA-stimulated locomotor activity were observed across sessions. Core temperature significantly decreased during initial MDMA sessions, but was unaltered by the last 10 sessions. In the MDMA challenge test, MDMA-na√Øve rats showed significantly higher NAcc 5-HT responses compared to MDMA-experienced rats, though MDMA experience did not affect the magnitude of NAcc DA response. The overall findings suggest that changes in MDMA-induced responses over the course of increasing levels of drug exposure may reflect the development of <e>tolerance</e> to a number of MDMA effects.",M1
19888637,"Perioperative pain management in the patient treated with opioids: continuing professional development.PURPOSE: The objective of this continuing professional development module is to describe the perioperative anesthesia and pain management of patients taking opioids because of chronic pain or drug addiction. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The number of patients under opioid treatment is increasing. Pain management is problematic in these patients, because regular opioid intake is associated with mechanisms of <e>tolerance</e> and dependence. More recently, opioid-induced hyperalgesia phenomena have been brought to light. As a rule, the usual opioid dose should be administered with the appropriate conversions, and additional requirements should be anticipated because of the surgical procedure. Local and regional anesthesia, and multimodal analgesia are indicated whenever possible. For the patient addicted to heroin or other opioids, the perioperative period is not a suitable time to initiate weaning. CONCLUSION: The physiological and pharmacological changes caused by chronic opioid intake must be understood in order to provide optimal pain management with respect to each individual and the type of procedure.",M1
19857996,"Cannabinoid-opioid interactions during neuropathic pain and analgesia.Opiates and exogenous cannabinoids, both potent analgesics used for the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain, bind to and activate class A G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs). Several lines of evidence have recently suggested that opioid and cannabinoid receptors can functionally interact in the central nervous system (CNS). These interactions may be direct, such as through receptor heteromerization, or indirect, such as through signaling cross-talk that includes agonist-mediated release and/or synthesis of endogenous ligands that can activate downstream receptors. Interactions between opioid and cannabinoid receptors may mediate many of the behavioral phenomena associated with the use of these drugs, including the production of acute antinociception and the development of <e>tolerance</e> and cross-tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of opioid and cannabinoid-specific ligands. This review summarizes behavioral, anatomical, and molecular data characterizing these interactions during the development of neuropathic pain and during antinociceptive treatment with these drugs alone or in combination. These studies are critical for understanding how the receptor systems involved in pain relief are altered during acute or chronic pain, and for designing better antinociceptive drug therapies, such as the combined use of opioid and cannabinoid receptor agonists or selective activation of receptor heteromers, that directly target the altered neurophysiology of patients experiencing pain.",M1
19857665,"Safety and <e>tolerance</e> of sodium mycophenolate in patients after renal transplantation--an observational study.BACKGROUND: Enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) was developed as an alternative agent to mycophenolate mofetil (MMF), aimed at reduction of gastrointestinal (GI) complications. METHODS: Seventy-four patients (mean age 42.3 years) switched from MMF to MPS were included in the study and followed-up for 3 months (Visit 0, Visit 2 after 1 month and Visit 3 after 3 months). The mean time from transplantation to switch was 3.7 years. During Visit 2 and 3 the following were recorded: impact of treatment change on the severity of GI symptoms (4 point scale: 1-worsening, 2-no change, 3-improvement, 4-resolution), EC-MPS tolerance, adverse events (AEs), patient compliance and physician satisfaction with treatment (4 point scale: 1-bad, 2-fair, 3-good, 4-very good). RESULTS: Sixty-three patients completed the study (85.1%). EC-MPS dose ranged from 720 to 1440 mg. GI symptom severity score averaged at 3.41. Symptoms most commonly compelling a conversion were: abdominal pain, diarrhea, abdominal colic, nausea, anorexia and vomiting. Out of 175 complaints, 144 (82%) either improved or resolved, 5 (2.86%) aggravated, and 25 (14.86%) persisted. Patient compliance and mean physician satisfaction score averaged at 3.70 and 3.02 at Visit 3, respectively. 9 AEs (2 severe) were reported. Causal relationship with the medication was suspected in 5 cases (1 case of SAE). The most common AEs were: anemia, infection (including sepsis), GI symptoms (abdominal pain, diarrhea). CONCLUSIONS: The following was concluded in our study: (1) sodium mycophenolate is well tolerated; (2) after switching from MMF to EC-MPS, gastrointestinal symptoms alleviated; (3) EC-MPS is a safe medication, with a low adverse events rate.",M1
19850034,"The effect of lithium chloride on WIN 55,212-2-induced <e>tolerance</e> in isolated guinea pig ileum.Tolerance to most of the cannabinoid effects has been reported, either in humans or in other species. Pharmacodynamic properties of these agents are perceived to be responsible for this phenomenon. The effect of lithium was examined on tolerance to WIN 55,212-2, a synthetic cannabinoid, in guinea pig ileum, a functional model to examine the mode of action of cannabinoids. Ileum strips were mounted in bath containing 37 degrees C Tyrode, under 0.5 g resting tension. The pulses were delivered, via platinum electrode, to the tissue and subsequent twitches were recorded using PowerLab system. WIN 55,212-2 could inhibit electrically stimulated twitches of guinea pig ileum in a dose dependent manner (pD(2)=8.56+/-0.41). Tolerance to this effect could be induced by incubating isolated ileum for 4h with WIN 55,212-2 (3 x IC(50)) (pD(2)=6.36+/-0.26, degree of tolerance: 159.32) (P&lt;0.01). Lithium (1mM) could interfere with the development of this cannabinoid-induced tolerance and restores the sensitivity of ileum to inhibitory action of WIN 55,212-2 either when strips were exposed to lithium chloride during 4h incubation period (pD(2)=7.26+/-0.39) (P&gt;0.05 versus non-tolerant group) (degree of tolerance: 20.28), or when lithium was added immediately before examining the inhibitory action of WIN 55,212-2 (pD(2)=8.09+/-0.33) (P&lt;0.05 versus corresponding tolerant group) (degree of tolerance: 2.96). Upon these results, it appears reasonable to consider an interventional role for lithium which may be able to break the chain of development and/or expression of tolerance to WIN 55,212-2 in this experimental model.",M1
19846044,"<e>Tolerance</e> to ethanol sedation and withdrawal hyper-excitability is mediated via neuropeptide Y Y1 and Y5 receptors.AIMS: Neuropeptide Y (NPY) is widely distributed throughout the brain and has been implicated in some of the actions of ethanol. The aim of the present study was to characterize the subtypes of NPY receptors in ethanol induced sedation, tolerance and withdrawal hyper-excitability. MAIN METHODS: The loss of righting reflex paradigm was used to record the sleep duration in mice. KEY FINDINGS: The acute administration of ethanol (3-4g per kg, i.p., 20%v/v) resulted in marked sedation. While prolonged ethanol consumption led to the development of tolerance, the mice showed hyper-excitability following ethanol withdrawal. Prior acute intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) injection of NPY (5-20 ng per mouse) or NPY Y1 and Y5 receptors agonist [Leu(31), Pro(34)]-NPY (0.02-0.2 ng per mouse) potentiated ethanol induced sedation. On the other hand, administration of selective NPY Y1 receptor antagonist BIBP3226 (5 ng per mouse, i.c.v.) inhibited ethanol induced sedation. Chronic concomitant treatment of NPY (20 ng per mouse, i.c.v.) or [Leu(31), Pro(34)]-NPY (0.2 ng per mouse, i.c.v.) to ethanol-fed groups prevented the development of tolerance and attenuated withdrawal hyper-excitability. Moreover, acute treatment of NPY (5 ng per mouse, i.c.v.) or [Leu(31), Pro(34)]-NPY (0.02 ng per mouse, i.c.v.) reversed the peak ethanol withdrawal hyper-excitability. SIGNIFICANCE: The results underscore a role for NPY Y1 and Y5 receptors in the ethanol induced sedation, tolerance and withdrawal hyper-excitability. We suggest that modulation of NPY Y1 and Y5 receptors may be a strategy to address the ethanol withdrawal conditions.",M1
19841904,"Administration of neurotoxic doses of MDMA reduces sensitivity to ethanol and increases GAT-1 immunoreactivity in mice striatum.RATIONALE: Mice with reduced dopamine activity following neurotoxic doses of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') consume more ethanol (EtOH) and show greater preference for EtOH. In keeping with human studies and other animal models where alcohol consumption and preference are also high, MDMA treatment will reduce sensitivity to certain physiological effects of EtOH. OBJECTIVE: We have examined the sensitivity to the acute effects of EtOH in MDMA-lesioned mice and the effects of EtOH on striatal gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) accumulation and expression of GABA subtype-1 transporter (GAT-1). METHODS: C57BL/6J mice were injected with neurotoxic MDMA (30 mg/kg, three times, every 3 h, i.p.). Seven days later, mice were given EtOH (3 g/kg, i.p.) to determine the loss of righting response and the development of rapid <e>tolerance</e> to the hypothermic effect of EtOH. The effect of EtOH on the striatal accumulation of GABA after inhibiting GABA transaminase and on GAT-1 immunoreactivity was also determined. RESULTS: Mice pre-treated with a neurotoxic dose of MDMA were less sensitive to the sedative-hypnotic effect of acute EtOH and exhibited alterations in the development of rapid tolerance to the hypothermic effect of EtOH. These animals showed an increase in striatal GAT-1 immunoreactivity. EtOH reduced GABA concentration in the striatum of non-lesioned mice, an effect not observed in MDMA-lesioned mice. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that mice with a MDMA-induced dopaminergic lesion show increased expression of striatal GAT-1 that may contribute to the lower sensitivity to EtOH-induced sedative effects and the resistance to the development of rapid tolerance to hypothermia produced by EtOH.",M1

OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to evaluate the accuracy of ITT, mean 12-h spontaneous nocturnal GH (SNGH), and IGF-I in the definition of permanent GHD. DESIGN AND SETTING: The study was conducted in two Pediatric Endocrinology Centers. PATIENTS AND METHODS: ITT, 12-h SNGH, and IGF-I were evaluated as single or combined tests in 79 subjects with COGHD (median age, 18.0 yr). The cohort consisted of 48 subjects with isolated GHD or one additional pituitary defect and normal MRI or anterior pituitary hypoplasia (group LLGHD, low likelihood GHD), and 31 subjects with structural hypothalamic-pituitary abnormalities or multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies (group HLGHD, high likelihood GHD). RESULTS: Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed the best diagnostic accuracy for peak GH cutoffs to ITT of 5.62 microg/liter or less [sensitivity, 77.4%; specificity, 93.8%; area under the curve (AUC) = 0.92], mean 12-h SNGH of 1.20 microg/liter or less (sensitivity, 90.3%; specificity, 89.6%; AUC = 0.93), and IGF-I of -2.83 sd score or less (sensitivity, 80.7%; specificity, 95.7%; AUC = 0.93). Seven patients in group HLGHD showed a peak GH to ITT above 5.62 microg/liter, but a median IGF-I that was significantly lower than that of group LLGHD (-3.30 vs. -0.73 sd score; P = 0.0001). Peak GH to ITT of 3.6 microg/liter or less and arginine of 3.1 microg/liter or less at childhood diagnosis can predict a future permanent GHD condition. CONCLUSIONS: The adopted peak GH to ITT below 5.62 microg/liter is an accurate diagnostic cutoff point for HLGHD in young adults with COGHD. In addition, IGF-I is a reliable marker providing information about the severity of GHD. Careful follow-up is required for subjects with discordant ITT and IGF-I results.",M1
19836673,"[Prevention with repellent in children]Use of topical insect repellent is an important component in prophylaxis of arthropod bite vector borne diseases. Topical insect repellent are used in a three part management regimen, along with impregnated clothing and mosquito netting. Parental training for efficacious and secure use of repellents for their children is essential part of a successful strategy to combat Lyme borreliosis, dengue fever, Chikungunya, West Nile virus infection and malaria, amongst children, according to local epidemiological risks. Rational repellent prescription for a child must take into account age, active substance concentration, topical substance <e>tolerance</e>, nature and surface of the skin to protect, number of daily applications, and the length of use in a benefit-risk ratio assessment perspective. The 4 currently repellents recommended by Whopes (Who) for their long lasting efficacy and patient tolerance are: 1) Citriodiol (PMD), 2) DEET, 3) Icaridine (KB3023), and 4) IR3535. In field trials the minimum required concentration of each four of these agents to be effective for 3 hours against most arthropods is 20% (in cream, roll-on or spray vehicle). Described side effects of these agents are mild, being limited to local irritative dermatitis and allergy. The risk of severe side effects has been related to DEET misused and neurotoxicity. The international recommendations concerning utilization of topical repellent amongst children for prophylaxis of arthropod borne diseases is concerning short term usage (several weeks). But the use of repellent is sub chronic or chronic amongst the majority of children living in subtropical regions where these vector borne diseases are endemic. And toxicity of topical repellent when used sub-chronically and chronically is not well studied in pediatric age groups. Taking into account these considerations, the current recommendations of the French Group of Tropical Paediatrics are to teach the parents of children who live in arthropod vector disease endemic regions to use topical insect repellent on their children with the recommended age related frequency in the following way: the use of topical repellent in infants above 6 months, once daily. Only in exceptional circumstances of severe arthropod exposure risk, their brief use in nursing infants as young as 2 months is acceptable, however with never more than 1 application daily. From ages 1 to 12 years, 2 applications daily may be safely used; 3 applications daily after 12 years old through adulthood.",M1
19834801,"Arsenite <e>tolerance</e> and biotransformation potential in estuarine bacteria.Bacterial isolates from water and sediment samples from freshwater, estuarine and marine regions were tested for their growth in the presence of different concentrations of arsenic. Despite the generation times being longer in case of all bacterial isolates tested in nutrient broth with 200 ppm Arsenite (As(3+)), many of them were able to attain log phase and substantial growth variously between 36 and 96 h. The isolates tolerating &gt;or=200 ppm arsenic (As) were found to belong to Enterobacteriaceae, Pseudomonas, Corynebaterium, Xanthomonas, Acinetobacter, Flavimonas and Micrococcus. Some of these environmental strains tolerant to 1,000 ppm arsenic were tested to realize their potential to detoxify arsenic. The rate of As biotransformation was faster by many of these strains. The percent of arsenite biotransformed/removed from the growth medium was the highest by a strain of Enterobacteriaceae (as much as 92% of the As in the growth medium by 120 h) followed by that of Corynebaterium and Acinetobacter strains. From these observations it is clear that many environmental strains are capable of quite rapid biotransformation of As. Contamination of drinking water by toxic metalloid arsenic affects thousands of people worldwide. Many environmental isolates of bacteria which detoxify this metalloid would serve beneficial in the depuration processes. We suggest that only such strains capable of high tolerance to toxic arsenite, would biotransform As in polluted estuarine environments and would prove useful in As bioremediation applications.",M1

19819304,"Effect of KEPI (Ppp1r14c) deletion on morphine analgesia and <e>tolerance</e> in mice of different genetic backgrounds: when a knockout is near a relevant quantitative trait locus.We previously identified KEPI as a morphine-regulated gene using subtractive hybridization and differential display PCR. Upon phosphorylation by protein kinase C, KEPI becomes a powerful inhibitor of protein phosphatase 1. To gain insights into KEPI functions, we created KEPI knockout (KO) mice on mixed 129S6xC57BL/6 genetic backgrounds. KEPI maps onto mouse chromosome 10 close to the locus that contains the mu-opioid receptor (Oprm1) and provides a major quantitative trait locus for morphine effects. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in and near the Oprm1 locus identified a doubly-recombinant mouse with C57BL/6 markers within 1 Mb on either side of the KEPI deletion. This strategy minimized the amount of 129S6 DNA surrounding the transgene and documented the C57BL/6 origin of the Oprm1 gene in this founder and its offspring. Recombinant KEPIKO mice displayed (a) normal analgesic responses and normal locomotion after initial morphine treatments, (b) accelerated development of tolerance to analgesic effects of morphine, (c) elevated activity of protein phosphatase 1 in thalamus, (d) attenuated morphine reward as assessed by conditioned place preference. These data support roles for KEPI action in adaptive responses to repeated administration of morphine that include analgesic tolerance and drug reward.",M1
19818835,"NMDA receptors are involved in upstream of the spinal JNK activation in morphine antinociceptive <e>tolerance</e>.N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors and c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) have been shown to be involved in morphine antinociceptive tolerance. However, whether chronic morphine-induced activation of the spinal JNK is NMDA receptor-dependent is unknown. The present study investigated the link between the spinal NMDA receptor NR2B subunit and the JNK activation during morphine antinociceptive tolerance in rats. Our results showed that chronic morphine treatment induced upregulation of the NR2B expression and activation of JNK in the spinal cord. Moreover, the increased NR2B-immunoreactivity (IR) and phosphorylated JNK-IR were observed mainly at the superficial dorsal horn laminae of the spinal cord; the spinal p-JNK was mainly expressed in astrocytes and NR2B in neurons. SP600125, a selective inhibitor of JNK, significantly attenuated morphine tolerance. MK-801, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, not only suppressed morphine antinociceptive tolerance and the increase in NR2B, but also reduced the spinal JNK activation induced by chronic morphine treatment. These findings demonstrated for the first time that NMDA receptor-dependent activation of the spinal JNK contributes to morphine antinociceptive tolerance and that MK-801 attenuates morphine tolerance partly due to its inhibition on the spinal JNK activation.",M1
19818516,"Variation in genotoxic stress <e>tolerance</e> among frog populations exposed to UV and pollutant gradients.Populations of widely distributed species can be subjected to unequal selection pressures, producing differences in rates of local adaptation. We report a laboratory experiment testing tolerance variation to UV-B and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) among common frog (Rana temporaria) populations according to their natural exposure level in the field. Studied populations were naturally distributed along two gradients, i.e. UV-B radiation with altitude and level of contamination by PAHs with the distance to emitting sources (road traffic). Tadpoles from eight populations were subjected to (1) no or high level of artificial UV-B; (2) four concentrations of benzo[a]pyrene (BaP) (0, 50, 250, 500microgL(-1)); (3) simultaneously to UV-B and BaP. Since both stressors are genotoxic, the number of micronucleated erythrocytes (MNE) in circulating red blood cells was used as a bioindicator of tadpole sensitivity. High-altitude populations appear to be locally adapted to better resist UV-B genotoxicity, as they showed the lowest MNE numbers. Conversely, no correlation was observed between levels of PAH contamination in the field and tadpole tolerance to BaP in the laboratory, indicating the absence of local adaptation for BaP tolerance in these populations. Nevertheless, the decrease of MNE formation due to BaP exposure with altitude suggests that high-altitude populations were intrinsically more resistant to BaP genotoxicity. We propose the hypothesis of a co-tolerance between UV-B and BaP in high-altitude common frog populations: local adaptation to prevent and/or repair DNA damage induced by UV-B could also protect these highland populations against DNA damage induced by BaP. The results of this study highlight the role of local adaptation along pollutant gradients leading to tolerance variation, which implies that is it necessary to take into account the history of exposure of each population and the existence of co-tolerance that can hide toxic effects of a new pollutant.",M1
19816677,"Dosing protocol and analgesic efficacy determine opioid <e>tolerance</e> in the mouse.RATIONALE: Analgesic efficacy of opioids and dosing protocol have been shown to influence analgesic tolerance. OBJECTIVE: This study tested the hypothesis that there is an inverse relationship between analgesic efficacy and tolerance following continuous infusion of opioid analgesics. Furthermore, it was hypothesized that analgesic efficacy plays a minor role in determining the magnitude of tolerance following intermittent or acute administration, and that acute and intermittent administration of opioid agonists produces less tolerance than continuous infusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Analgesic (tailflick) efficacy (tau) of etorphine, methadone, oxycodone, and hydrocodone was determined using the operational model of agonism. To induce tolerance, mice were injected with opioid agonists once (acute), once per day for 7 days (intermittent) or continuously infused for 7 days. Dose-response studies were conducted using morphine following treatment. RESULTS: The order of analgesic efficacy was etorphine &gt; methadone &gt; oxycodone congruent with hydrocodone. Infusion of the higher analgesic efficacy drug etorphine produced significantly less tolerance than the lower analgesic efficacy drugs oxycodone, methadone, and hydrocodone at equi-effective doses. In general, intermittent and acute treatment produced less tolerance compared to continuous infusion even at similar daily doses. CONCLUSION: Taken together, intermittent and acute opioid agonist administration produces minimal tolerance compared to continuous infusion. Furthermore, there is an inverse relationship between analgesic efficacy and tolerance following continuous infusion. These results suggest that opioid analgesic tolerance may be increased when sustained release dosing formulations or continuous infusions are employed clinically.",M1

Tolerance was assessed using hot plate after administration of a test dose of morphine (9 mg kg(-1), i.p.) on fifth day. Withdrawal zsymptoms (Jumping and Rearing) were assessed by administration of naloxone (5 mg kg(-1), i.p.) 2 h after the last dose of morphine in fourth day. It was found that administration of lamotrigine or magnesium sulfate or their combination decreased the morphine induced tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. From these results it is concluded that lamotrigine and magnesium sulfate alone or in combination could prevent the development of morphine tolerance and withdrawal symptoms. Glutamate release inhibitory effect of lamotrigine and its possible mechanism and property of magnesium, blocking the N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) receptor calcium channel, is probably its mechanism on preventing morphine induced tolerance and dependence.",M1
19800922,"Chronic NT69L potently prevents drug-induced disruption of prepulse inhibition without causing <e>tolerance</e>.NT69L is a neurotensin receptor agonist with antipsychotic-like activity. NT69L blocks apomorphine-induced climbing in rats with no effect on stereotypic behavior, attenuates d-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity, and blocks pharmacologically induced disruption of prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle response. Repeated administration of NT69L results in tolerance to some, but not to all of its effects. Because schizophrenic patients require long-term treatment, chronic (21-day) administration of NT69L was tested in PPI with comparisons to chronic haloperidol and clozapine treatment. Sprague-Dawley rats received acute or 21 daily, subcutaneous injections of NT69L (1.0mg/kg). On days 1 and 21 the NT69L injection was followed 30 min later by treatment with either saline; the dopamine agonist, d-amphetamine (5.0mg/kg); or the serotonin 5-HT(2A) psychotomimetic receptor agonist [1-(2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodophenyl)-2-aminopropane] DOI (0.5mg/kg). Experiments were repeated with either haloperidol (1mg/kg) or clozapine (20mg/kg) in place of NT69L. Acute injection of NT69L significantly blocked d-amphetamine and DOI disruption of PPI. As with the acute injection, 21 daily administrations of NT69L also blocked d-amphetamine- and DOI-induced disruption of PPI. The data show that animals do not develop tolerance to the antipsychotic-like effects of NT69L when tested in the PPI of the startle response. The persistent efficacy of NT69L with chronic treatment provides further support for the therapeutic use of neurotensin (NT) agonists to treat schizophrenia and possibly other disorders that are characterized by PPI deficits. The modulatory role of NT69L on the dopaminergic and serotonergic neurotransmission systems both of which are implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia is discussed.",M1

We previously demonstrated that chronic intrathecal infusion of morphine leads to tolerance and spinal neuroinflammation. The aim of present study was to examine the possible mechanisms by which ultra-low dose naloxone modulates spinal neuroinflammation, particularly the role of anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin 10 (IL-10). Morphine tolerance was induced in male Wistar rats by intrathecal infusion of morphine (15 microg/h) for 5 days, and co-infusion of naloxone (15 pg/h) was used to evaluate the impact on spinal cytokine expression. Recombinant rat IL-10 (rrIL-10) or anti-rat IL-10 antibody was injected to elucidate the effect of IL-10 on morphine tolerance. Our results showed that co-infusion of naloxone (15 pg/h) with morphine not only attenuated tolerance, shifting the AD(50) from 89.2 to 11.7 microg but also inhibited the increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine (TNF-alpha, IL-1beta, and IL-6) caused by chronic intrathecal morphine infusion. The increase of IL-10 protein and mRNA were 1.5- and 3-fold, respectively, compared to that in morphine-infused rat spinal cords. A combination of daily rrIL-10 (1 microg) injection with morphine infusion produced, in a less potent, preservative antinociception and inhibited pro-inflammatory cytokine production compared to ultra-low dose naloxone co-infusion, and the effect of ultra-low dose naloxone co-infusion was inhibited by daily intrathecal anti-rat IL-10 antibody injection. These results demonstrate that IL-10 contributes to the attenuation of pro-inflammatory cytokine expression caused by ultra-low dose naloxone/morphine co-infusion and thus the attenuation of morphine tolerance.",M1
19788914,"Decreased opioid analgesia in weanling rats exposed to endothelin-1 during infancy.Endothelin-1 produces spontaneous nociceptive-associated behaviors that are modulated by the peripheral opioid system. The present study tests the hypothesis that single or repeated exposure to endothelin-1 during infancy decreases opioid analgesia in weanling rats. Morphine analgesia was measured in male and female postnatal day 21 rats following intraplantar endothelin-1 on postnatal day 7, or 11 or both days 7 and 11. In males, exposure to endothelin-1 on postnatal day 11 or both days 7 and 11 produced a statistically significant decrease in morphine analgesia (EC(50)=0.902 and 1.326mg/kg, respectively) compared to control (EC(50)=0.486mg/kg). Similarly in females, exposure to endothelin-1 on postnatal day 11 or both days 7 and 11 produced a statistically significant decrease in morphine analgesia (EC(50)=1.367 and 1.226mg/kg, respectively) compared to control (EC(50)=0.468mg/kg). In addition, females exposed to endothelin-1 on postnatal day 7 exhibited an intermediate decrease in morphine analgesia with an EC(50) of 0.752mg/kg. In males, exposure to endothelin-1 decreased mu opioid receptor expression without changing endothelin-A receptor or endothelin-B receptor expression in the hindpaw skin. In contrast, in females, exposure to endothelin-1 increased expression of both endothelin receptors and the mu opioid receptor in hindpaw skin.

19783279,"Effects of cadmium on plant growth and physiological traits in contrast wheat recombinant inbred lines differing in cadmium <e>tolerance</e>.Four wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) lines differing in cadmium (Cd) tolerance previously identified from a recombinant inbred line population were subjected to 50 microM CdCl2 from the three-leaf stage for 24 d, to investigate the responses of wheat seedlings to Cd toxicity. Under Cd stress, most growth parameters and root morphological traits were reduced, except for secondary root numbers and average root diameter. Cd enhanced leaf cell peroxidation due to increased malondialdehyde (MDA) content and reduced activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD) and catalase (CAT) in leaves. In addition, CAT activity decreased in the Cd-sensitive lines while increased in the tolerant lines. Leaf photosystem II (PSII) was damaged, since the maximum efficiency of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm) and potential efficiency of PSII photochemistry under dark-adapted (Fv/Fo) decreased, while the initial fluorescence (Fo) increased in all lines under Cd stress. Then, total soluble sugar concentration decreased while free amino acids concentration increased in both shoot and root. We concluded that Cd-tolerant lines accumulated less Cd in plant and contained low Cd concentration in shoot (less translocation of Cd to shoot), maintained higher CAT activity in leaf and higher PS II function than the Cd-sensitive lines under Cd toxicity, thus could be related to their tolerant capacity to Cd in the present study.",M1

Preclinical research demonstrates that lobeline produces locomotor hypoactivity apart from its therapeutic effects; however, the hypothesis that there are sex differences in hypoactivity or in the development of tolerance to its locomotor depressant effects has not been investigated. Periadolescent rats were injected with saline to determine baseline locomotor activity. Animals received saline or lobeline (1.0-10mg/kg) daily for 7 consecutive days (post natal days 29-35), and were challenged with saline 24h later to assess baseline activity. Lobeline produced hypoactivity in total horizontal activity and center distance travelled. Tolerance developed to the lobeline-induced hypoactivity and sex differences in lobeline tolerance were observed on both measures. Females acquired tolerance to lobeline 5.6 mg/kg at a slower rate than males. Saline challenge revealed a linear dose-dependent trend of hyperactivity on both measures, which indicates that rats exhibited altered locomotor behavior 24h after the final lobeline treatment. These findings demonstrate sex differences in the hypoactive response to lobeline prior to puberty and suggest that females may experience more locomotor depressant effects than males. Chronic lobeline may induce hyperactivity following cessation of treatment.",M1
19764437,"[Anti-opioid action of glutamate-NMDA receptor systems underlying morphine analgesic <e>tolerance</e>]Although the opioid analgesics such as morphine represent an important class of agents for the treatment of severe clinical pain, the development of tolerance and dependence often overshadows the therapeutic advantages of morphine and related opioids in individuals undergoing long-term treatments. The mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance are not fully understood, but appear to be comprised of two types of plasticity or counter-adaptation, at the cellular level and through neuronal circuits. Current studies mostly emphasize the cellular adaptation mechanisms, which include altered gene expression and receptor desensitization due to phosphorylation and endocytosis. However, the mechanisms underlying opioid tolerance and dependence are not always explained by cellular adaptation mechanisms alone. This review focuses on the plasticity in neuronal circuits achieved through an enhancement of so-called anti-opioid glutamate/NMDA receptor synaptic activities. There have been also conceptual advances in understanding the changes to supporting systems, which include the altered expression of key molecules regulating the anti-opioid system through neuron-glial networks. We also introduce a new approach using in vivo electroporation to identify the brain loci responsible for morphine tolerance and dependence.",M1
19761042,"Anti-inflammatory, immunomodulatory and antinociceptive activity of Terminalia arjuna Roxb bark powder in mice and rats.Terminalia arjuna back powder (400 mg/kg, po) significantly reduced formalin-indued paw oedema at 24 h but not carrageenan-induced paw oedema. It significantly increased the anti-SRBC antibody titre in the secondary phase of immune response. The same dose significantly reduced the duration of licks and bites in both phases of formalin-induced pain response and showed significant increase in tail flick latency at higher dose (800 mg/kg, po). These effects of T. arjuna were antagonised by pretreatment with naloxone (1 mg/kg, ip). In another series of experiments, mice pretreated with morphine for three days in increasing doses (10, 15, 20 mg/kg, ip; twice daily) showed a decreased response in antinociceptive activity of morphine (5 mg/kg, ip). Further, cross <e>tolerance</e> was observed with T. arjuna (800 mg/kg, po) in morphine tolerant animals.

19747740,"Land use, genetic diversity and toxicant <e>tolerance</e> in natural populations of Daphnia magna.Provided that gene flow is not too high, selection by local environmental conditions in heterogeneous landscapes can lead to genetic adaptation of natural populations to their local habitat. Pollution with anthropogenic toxicants may create pronounced environmental gradients that impose strong local selection pressures. Toxic contaminants may also directly impact genetic structure in natural populations by exhibiting genotoxicity or by causing population declines resulting in genetic bottlenecks. Using populations of Daphnia magna established from the dormant egg banks of ponds located in a landscape dominated by anthropogenic impact, we aimed at detecting evidence for local adaptation to environmental contamination. We explored the relationship between land use around the 10 investigated ponds, population genetic diversity as measured by neutral genetic markers (polymorphic allozymes) and the tolerance of the populations originating from these ponds to acute lethal effects of two model toxicants, the pesticide carbaryl and the metal potassium dichromate. Genetic diversity of the populations as observed by neutral markers tended to be negatively impacted by agricultural land use intensity (Spearman rank correlation, R=-0.614, P=0.059), indicating that genetic bottlenecks may have resulted from anthropogenic impact. We experimentally observed differences in susceptibility to both carbaryl and potassium dichromate among the studied pond populations of D. magna (analysis of deviance, P&lt;0.001). Because the experimental design excluded the possibility of physiological adaptation of the test animals to the toxicants, we conclude that the differences in susceptibility must have a genetic basis. Moreover, carbaryl tolerance levels of the populations tended to increase with increasing agricultural land use intensity as described by ranked percentage of land coverage with cereal and corn crop in the proximity of the ponds (Spearman rank correlation, R=0.602, P=0.066). Together, these two findings provide evidence for local adaptation of D. magna populations to pesticide contamination. Overall, the results demonstrate the potential selection pressure imposed by anthropogenic pollution and provide evidence that genetic erosion in natural Daphnia populations is related to anthropogenic impact.",M1
19744978,"Occurrence of vancomycin-tolerant and heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate strains (hVISA) among Staphylococcus aureus causing bloodstream infections in nine USA hospitals.BACKGROUND: The bactericidal activities of vancomycin and daptomycin were evaluated in a large collection of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) bacteraemia strains from nine major USA medical centres. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the occurrence of heterogeneous vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus (hVISA) among MRSA strains tolerant to vancomycin and/or with increased vancomycin or daptomycin MIC values. The accuracy of the macro Etest method (MET) compared with population analysis profiling (PAP) for the detection of hVISA was also assessed. METHODS: A total of 1800 MRSA strains were collected from bloodstream infections at the nine sites (40 strains per year, per medical centre during the 2002-06 study period). Vancomycin and daptomycin MIC testing was performed by reference broth microdilution (all strains) and MBC tests on 50% of strains (randomly selected). A subset of isolates (n = 268) having an increased vancomycin MBC (&gt; or =16 mg/L), an increased vancomycin MIC (&gt; or =1 mg/L) and/or an increased daptomycin MIC (&gt;0.5 mg/L) were tested for susceptibility to vancomycin and teicoplanin by MET. RESULTS: Overall, 181 of 900 (20.1%) MRSA tested exhibited vancomycin <e>tolerance</e>, varying from 10% to 43% among the medical centres evaluated, and from 11.7% in 2004 to 27.8% in 2005.

The accuracy of MET for identifying hVISA strains varied significantly with the criteria applied for positivity. CONCLUSIONS: The most frequently used criteria to define hVISA, i.e. MET reading values &gt; or =8 mg/L for both vancomycin and teicoplanin or &gt; or =12 mg/L for teicoplanin only, detected 20 of 36 PAP-positive strains (55.6% sensitivity), indicating that the prevalence of hVISA could be higher than currently appreciated.

19740133,"The mammalian circadian clock exhibits acute <e>tolerance</e> to ethanol.BACKGROUND: Tolerance to ethanol is observed over a variety of time courses, from minutes to days. Acute tolerance, which develops over 5 to 60 minutes, has been observed for both behavioral and neurophysiological variables and may involve changes in signaling through NMDA, GABA, or other receptors. Previous work has shown that both acute and chronic ethanol treatments modulate photic and nonphotic phase resetting of the mammalian circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN). Although not specifically tested, the data thus far do not point to the development of chronic tolerance to the modulatory effects of ethanol. Here we investigated whether acute tolerance the ethanol occurs with respect to in vitro phase modulation of the SCN clock. METHODS: Mouse brain slices containing the SCN were pretreated with ethanol for varying lengths of time, followed by treatment concurrent with either glutamate or the serotonin agonist, 8-hydroxy-DPAT (DPAT). The phase of the SCN circadian clock was assessed the following day through extracellular recordings of SCN neuronal activity. SCN neuronal activity normally peaks during mid-day, and this rhythm can be shifted by treatment with either glutamate or DPAT. RESULTS: While concurrent treatment of SCN-containing brain slices with ethanol and glutamate blocks glutamate-induced phase delays of the SCN clock, pretreating the slices with ethanol for &gt; or =15 minutes prevents this inhibition. Likewise, while concurrent treatment with ethanol and DPAT enhances DPAT-induced phase advances of the SCN clock, pretreating the slices with ethanol for &gt; or =30 minutes prevents this enhancement. CONCLUSIONS: Both the inhibiting and enhancing effects of ethanol on in vitro SCN clock phase resetting show acute tolerance. Additional experiments are needed to determine whether more slowly developing forms of tolerance also occur with respect to the SCN circadian clock.",M1
19735939,"Expression of metallothionein and alpha-tubulin in heavy metal-tolerant Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto (Diptera: Culicidae).Anopheles mosquitoes have been shown to adapt to heavy metals in their natural habitats. In this study we explored the possibility of using Anopheles gambiae sensu stricto as bio-reporters for environmental heavy metal pollution through expressions of their metal-responsive metallothionein and alpha-tubulin genes. The study was undertaken with third instar larvae after selection by cadmium, copper, or lead at LC(30) through five successive generations. Expression levels were determined in the 5th generation by semi-quantitative RT-PCR on the experimental and control populations. The data were analyzed using one-way ANOVA. The highest metallothionein (F(3,11)=4.574, P=0.038) and alpha-tubulin (F(3,11)=12.961, P=0.002) responses were observed in cadmium-tolerant treatments. There was significantly higher expression of metallothionein in cadmium or copper treatments relative to the control (P=0.012), and in cadmium than in lead treatments (P=0.044). Expressions of alpha-tubulin were significantly higher in cadmium than in control treatments (P=0.008).

In this issue of the BJP, Schuhmacher et al. characterized a novel class of organic nitrates with amino moieties (aminoalkyl nitrates). Aminoethyl nitrate was identified as a novel organic mononitrate with high potency but devoid of induction of mitochondrial oxidative stress. Cross-tolerance to nitroglycerin or the endothelium-dependent agonist acetylcholine after in vivo treatment was not observed. Like all nitrates, aminoethyl nitrate induced vasorelaxation by activation of soluble guanylate cyclase. Thus, in contrast to the prevailing view, high potency in an organic nitrate is not necessarily accompanied by induction of oxidative stress or endothelial dysfunction.

19730809,"Aspirin attenuates insulin resistance in muscle of diet-induced obese rats by inhibiting inducible nitric oxide synthase production and S-nitrosylation of IRbeta/IRS-1 and Akt.AIM/HYPOTHESIS: High-dose aspirin treatment improves fasting and postprandial hyperglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes, as well as in animal models of insulin resistance associated with obesity and sepsis. In this study, we investigated the effects of aspirin treatment on inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS)-mediated insulin resistance and on S-nitrosylation of insulin receptor (IR)-beta, IRS-1 and protein kinase B (Akt) in the muscle of diet-induced obese rats and also in iNos (also known as Nos2)-/- mice on high fat diet. METHODS: Aspirin (120 mg kg-1 day-1 for 2 days) or iNOS inhibitor (L-NIL; 80 mg/kg body weight) were administered to diet-induced obese rats or mice and iNOS production and insulin signalling were investigated. S-nitrosylation of IRbeta/IRS-1 and Akt was investigated using the biotin switch method. RESULTS: iNOS protein levels increased in the muscle of diet-induced obese rats, associated with an increase in S-nitrosylation of IRbeta, IRS-1 and Akt. These alterations were reversed by aspirin treatment, in parallel with an improvement in insulin signalling and sensitivity, as measured by insulin <e>tolerance</e> test and glucose clamp. Conversely, while aspirin reversed the increased phosphorylation of IkappaB kinase beta and c-Jun amino-terminal kinase, as well as IRS-1 serine phosphorylation in diet-induced obese rats and iNos -/- mice on high-fat diet, these alterations were not associated with the improvement of insulin action induced by this drug. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Our data demonstrate that aspirin treatment not only reduces iNOS protein levels, but also S-nitrosylation of IRbeta, IRS-1 and Akt. These changes are associated with improved insulin resistance and signalling, suggesting a novel mechanism of insulin sensitisation evoked by aspirin treatment.",M1
19727068,"Selective boosting of transcriptional and behavioral responses to drugs of abuse by histone deacetylase inhibition.Histone acetylation and other modifications of the chromatin are important regulators of gene expression and, consequently, may contribute to drug-induced behaviors and neuroplasticity. Earlier studies have shown that a reduction in histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity results in the enhancement of some psychostimulant-induced behaviors.

In contrast, this compound has no effects on the development of morphine <e>tolerance</e> and dependence. Similar effects were observed for cocaine and ethanol-induced behaviors. These behavioral changes were accompanied by a selective boosting of a component of the transcriptional program activated by chronic morphine administration that included circadian clock genes and other genes relevant to addictive behavior.

19721410,"Revisiting <e>tolerance</e> from the endogenous morphine perspective.Tolerance represents a dynamic mechanism that can be used to temper various regulatory processes regardless of whether they mediate excitation or inhibition. Tolerance operationally directs state-dependent attenuation of the action of endogenous and exogenous morphine. For example, tolerance ensures that immuno-inhibition induced by morphine does not compromise a requisite functional system over an extended period of time. In the nervous system, tolerance to inhibitory action insures that excitatory tone is resumed. Thus, desensitization sets in and allows various essential processes to be operational once again. Clearly, the temporal rebound of diverse immune and nervous processes involved with opiate actions provides a self-contained operational mechanism to ensure survival of the organism. Furthermore, love and/or pleasure, and satiety, are complex neurobiological phenomena linked to limbic brain reward circuitry. These processes are critically dependent on oxytocin, vasopressin, dopamine, endogenous morphine and serotoninergic signaling. Naturally rewarding and/or pleasurable activities are usually governed by beneficial biological behaviors like eating, sex, and reproduction. It is our contention that critically important tolerance mechanisms extend to behaviors mediated by CNS reward systems. In other words, we become satisfied with sex, food, pleasure for the moment and disinterest creeps in until the  urges  return.",M1
19709762,"Additive vs non-additive genetic components in lethal cadmium <e>tolerance</e> of Gammarus (Crustacea): novel light on the assessment of the potential for adaptation to contamination.Questioning the likelihood that populations adapt to contamination is critical for ecotoxicological risk assessment. The appraisal of genetic variance in chemical sensitivities within populations is currently used to evaluate a priori this evolutionary potential. Nevertheless, conclusions from this approach are questionable since non-additive genetic components in chemical tolerance could limit the response of such complex phenotypic traits to selection. Coupling quantitative genetics with ecotoxicology, this study illustrates how the comparison between cadmium sensitivities among Gammarus siblings enabled discrimination between genetic variance components in chemical tolerance. The results revealed that, whereas genetically determined differences in lethal tolerance exist within the studied population, such differences were not significantly heritable since genetic variance mainly relied on non-additive components. Therefore the potential for genetic adaptation to acute Cd stress appeared to be weak. These outcomes are discussed in regard to previous findings for asexual daphnids, which suggest a strong potency of genetic adaptation to environmental contamination, but which contrast with compiled field observations where adaptation is not the rule. Hereafter, we formulate the reconciling hypothesis of a widespread weakness of additive components in tolerance to contaminants, which needs to be further tested to gain insight into the question of the likelihood of adaptation to contamination.",M1
19703167,"Involvement of protein kinase C and Src tyrosine kinase in acute <e>tolerance</e> to ethanol inhibition of spinal NMDA-induced pressor responses in rats.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The present study was carried out to examine the role of protein kinases in the development of acute tolerance to the effects of ethanol on spinal N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor-mediated pressor responses during prolonged ethanol exposure. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Blood pressure responses induced by intrathecal injection of NMDA were recorded. The levels of several phosphorylated residues on NMDA receptor NR1 (GluN1) (NR1) and NMDA receptor NR2B (GluN2B) (NR2B) subunits were determined by immunohistochemistry and Western blot analysis. KEY RESULTS: Ethanol inhibited spinal NMDA-induced pressor responses at 10 min, but the inhibition was significantly reduced at 40 min following continuous infusion. This effect was dose-dependently blocked by chelerythrine [a protein kinase C (PKC) inhibitor, 1-1000 pmol] or PP2 (a Src family tyrosine kinase inhibitor, 1-100 pmol) administered intrathecally 10 min following ethanol infusion. A significant increase in the immunoreactivity of phosphoserine 896 of NR1 subunits (pNR1-Ser896) and phosphotyrosine 1336 of NR2B subunits (pNR2B-Tyr1336) was found in neurons of intermediolateral cell column during the development of tolerance. Levels of pNR1-Ser896 and pNR2B-Tyr1336 were also significantly increased in lateral horn regions of the spinal cord slices incubated with ethanol for 40 min in vitro. The increases in pNR1-Ser896 and pNR2B-Tyr1336 levels were inhibited by post-treatment with chelerythrine and PP2, respectively, both in the in vivo and in vitro studies. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The results suggest that activation of PKC and Src tyrosine kinase during prolonged ethanol exposure leading to increases in the levels of pNR1-Ser896 and pNR2B-Tyr1336 may contribute to acute tolerance to inhibition by ethanol of NMDA receptor function.",M1
19700257,"[Pupillary dilatation monitoring to evaluate acute remifentanil <e>tolerance</e> in cardiac surgery]INTRODUCTION: Remifentanil is a powerful morphinic agonist often ordered for anaesthesia. The use of peroperative large doses of this opioid increases the risk to develop postoperative hyperalgesia and acute tolerance. But how early these effects can occur? Despite the fact that these effects could be masked during the preoperative time because of general anaesthesia, it seems they could occur precociously. In order to try to describe this time, this study evaluated the acute tolerance under general anaesthesia requiring large doses of remifentanil by using an effective peroperative monitoring of nociception: the continuous pupillary diameter monitoring. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this prospective observational clinical study, a continuous infusion of remifentanil was started at a range of 0.3 microg/kg/min after induction of anaesthesia by using propofol (TIVA), remifentanil bolus and cisatracurium. The pupil monitoring started 10 min later (T+10 min) and lasted until the surgical incision (T+65 min). So, there was no surgical stimulus during this time. RESULTS: Thirty patients undergoing major cardiac or vascular surgery were included in this study. The continuous pupil diameter evaluation showed a significant increase of the pupil diameter from T+45 min. No significant variation of heart rate, blood pressure, bispectral index (BIS) values were observed. DISCUSSION: The development of acute remifentanil tolerance could possibly explain these results. If evaluations with continuous pupillary diameter monitoring are still limited, these results suggest that the use of powerful opioids such as remifentanil should be associated with a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist agent, including short time administrations.",M1

The present study used dose-addition analysis to evaluate CB(1)/NMDA receptor interactions on this endpoint. Chronic morphine administration (5 days, 100 mg/kg, twice daily) resulted in a 2.8-fold rightward shift in the morphine dose-effect curve. Co-administration of either the CB(1) receptor agonist CP-55940 (5-(1,1-Dimethylheptyl)-2-[5-hydroxy-2-(3-hydroxypropyl)cyclohexyl]phenol; 0.32-1.0 mg/kg) or the NMDA receptor antagonist (-)-6-phosphonomethyl-deca-hydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (LY235959; 1.0-3.2 mg/kg) with morphine dose-dependently attenuated morphine tolerance. The relative potency of each drug alone was quantified using a defined level of effect (one-quarter log shift in the morphine dose-effect curve), resulting in equieffective doses of 0.42 mg/kg and 1.1 mg/kg for CP-55940 and LY235959, respectively. Subsequent experiments assessed CP-55940/LY235959 interactions using a fixed-proportion design. Co-administration of CP-55940/LY235959 mixtures (1:1, 1:3.2, or 1:10 CP-55940/LY235959) with morphine dose-dependently attenuated morphine tolerance. Isobolographic and dose-addition analysis were used to statistically compare the experimentally determined potency for each mixture (z(mix)) with predicted additive potency (z(add)). Mixtures of 1:1 and 1:3.2 CP-55940/LY235959 produced additive effects (z(add) = z(mix)), while the mixture of 1:10 CP-55940/LY235959 produced a supra-additive effect (z(add) &gt; z(mix)). These results suggest that CP-55940 and LY235959 produce additive or supra-additive attenuation of morphine antinociceptive tolerance after repeated morphine administration, depending on their relative concentrations.",M1
19691874,"Quantitative trait loci contributing to physiological and behavioural ethanol responses after acute and chronic treatment.The aim of the present study was the identification of gene loci that contribute to the development and manifestation of behaviours related to acute and chronic alcohol exposure, as well as to alcohol withdrawal. For this purpose, we performed a serial behavioural phenotyping of 534 animals from the second filial (F2) generation of a C57BL/6J and C3H/HeJ mice intercross in paradigms with relevance to alcohol dependence. First, ethanol-induced hypothermia was determined in ethanol-naive animals. The mice then received an ethanol solution for several weeks as their only fluid source. Ethanol <e>tolerance</e>, locomotor activity and anxiety-related behaviours were evaluated. The ethanol was next withdrawn and the withdrawal severity was assessed. The ethanol-experienced animals were finally analysed in a two-bottle choice paradigm to determine ethanol preference and stress-induced changes in ethanol preference. The genotypes of these mice were subsequently assessed by microsatellite marker mapping. We genotyped 264 markers with an average marker distance of 5.56 cM, which represents a high-density whole genome coverage. Quantitative trait loci (QTL) were subsequently identified using univariate analysis performed with the R/qtl tool, which is an extensible, interactive environment for mapping QTL in experimental crosses. We found QTL that have already been published, thus validating the serial phenotyping protocol, and identified several novel loci. Our analysis demonstrates that the various responses to ethanol are regulated by independent groups of genes.",M1
19690270,"Central administration of minocycline and riluzole prevents morphine-induced <e>tolerance</e> in rats.BACKGROUND: Long-term exposure to opiates induces tolerance to the analgesic effect. The neurobiological mechanism of this phenomenon is not completely clear. In this study, we evaluated the effects of central administration of minocycline (a tetracycline derivative) and riluzole (an antiglutamatergic drug) on morphine-induced tolerance in rats. METHODS: Groups of rats received daily morphine (10 mg/kg, IP) in combination with saline (10 microL/rat, intracerebroventricular [ICV]) or 1% Tween 80 (10 microL/rat, ICV) or minocycline (60, 120, and 240 microg/10 microL per rat, ICV) or riluzole (20, 40, 80 microg/10 microL per rat, ICV). Nociception was assessed using hotplate apparatus (55 degrees C +/- 0.5 degrees C). Hotplate latency was recorded when the rat licked its hindpaw. Baseline latencies were determined once per day for each rat, then morphine (10 mg/kg) was injected. After 20 min, the above-mentioned drugs were administered and postdrug latency was measured 10 min after the injection of drugs or vehicles. RESULTS: Results showed that ICV administration of minocycline and riluzole delayed morphine-induced tolerance. Morphine tolerance was complete after 8 days in the control groups but was complete in the groups treated with minocycline (120 microg/10 microL per rat) and riluzole (80 microg/10 microL per rat) on the 13th day. In addition, our results showed that minocycline and riluzole increased the total analgesic effect of morphine (area under the curve of the percentage of maximal possible effect values). CONCLUSION: The effects of minocycline on nitric oxide and the glutamatergic system and the effect of riluzole on the glutamate system are potentially important mechanisms in delaying morphine-induced tolerance.",M1
19684256,"Extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 activation counteracts morphine <e>tolerance</e> in the periaqueductal gray of the rat.Repeated administration of opioids produces long-lasting changes in micro-opioid receptor (MOR) signaling that underlie behavioral changes such as tolerance. Mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways, including MAPK extracellular signal-regulated kinases (ERK1/2), are modulated by opioids and are known to produce long-lasting changes in cell signaling. Thus, we tested the hypothesis that ERK1/2 activation contributes to the development and/or expression of morphine tolerance mediated by the periaqueductal gray (PAG). Changes in phosphorylated ERK1/2 expression were assessed with confocal microscopy and compared to behavioral measures of tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of chronic morphine administration. Repeated microinjection of morphine into the PAG produced tolerance and caused a significant increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation, an effect not evident with acute morphine microinjection. Microinjection of the MAPK/ERK kinase inhibitor, 1,4-diamino-2,3-dicyano-1,4-bis(o-aminophenylmercapto)butadiene ethanolate (U0126), into the PAG had no effect on antinociception produced by acute morphine administration. However, repeated coadministration of U0126 and morphine into the PAG blocked ERK1/2 phosphorylation and enhanced the development of morphine tolerance. Coadministration of U0126 with morphine only on the test day also enhanced the expression of morphine tolerance. Administration of the irreversible opioid receptor antagonist beta-chlornaltrexamine blocked the activation of ERK1/2 caused by repeated morphine microinjections, demonstrating that ERK1/2 activation was a MOR-mediated event. In summary, these studies show that chronic morphine administration alters ERK1/2 signaling and that disruption of ERK1/2 signaling enhances both the development and expression of morphine tolerance. Contrary to expectations, these data indicate that ERK1/2 activation opposes the development of morphine tolerance.",M1
19684255,"Immunoneutralization of agmatine sensitizes mice to micro-opioid receptor <e>tolerance</e>.Systemically or centrally administered agmatine (decarboxylated arginine) prevents, moderates, or reverses opioid-induced tolerance and self-administration, inflammatory and neuropathic pain, and sequelae associated with ischemia and spinal cord injury in rodents. These behavioral models invoke the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor/nitric-oxide synthase cascade. Agmatine (AG) antagonizes the NMDA receptor and inhibits nitric-oxide synthase in vitro and in vivo, which may explain its effect in models of neural plasticity. Agmatine has been detected biochemically and immunohistochemically in the central nervous system. Consequently, it is conceivable that agmatine operates in an anti-glutamatergic manner in vivo; the role of endogenous agmatine in the central nervous system remains minimally defined. The current study used an immunoneutralization strategy to evaluate the effect of sequestration of endogenous agmatine in acute opioid analgesic tolerance in mice. First, intrathecal pretreatment with an anti-AG IgG (but not normal IgG) reversed an established pharmacological effect of intrathecal agmatine: antagonism of NMDA-evoked behavior. This result justified the use of anti-AG IgG to sequester endogenous agmatine in vivo. Second, intrathecal pretreatment with the anti-AG IgG sensitized mice to induction of acute spinal tolerance of two micro-opioid receptor-selective agonists, [D-Ala(2),N-Me-Phe(4),Gly(5)-ol]-enkephalin and endomorphin-2. A lower dose of either agonist that, under normal conditions, produces moderate or no tolerance was tolerance-inducing after intrathecal pretreatment of anti-AG IgG (but not normal IgG). The effect of the anti-AG IgG lasted for at least 24 h in both NMDA-evoked behavior and the acute opioid tolerance. These results suggest that endogenous spinal agmatine may moderate glutamate-dependent neuroplasticity.",M1
19682273,"Prevention and reversal of morphine <e>tolerance</e> by the analgesic neuroactive steroid alphadolone.OBJECTIVE: Alphadolone is a neuroactive steroid that causes antinociception in rats and analgesia in humans by interaction with spinal cord GABA(A) receptors. This study investigated whether alphadolone could affect morphine tolerance. METHODS: Morphine tolerance was induced in rats with subcutaneous sustained release morphine emulsion (M-SR; 125 mg/kg/day). Tolerance was assessed by a blinded observer using tail flick latency (TFL) response to intraperitoneal (ip) injection of immediate release morphine (M-IR 6.25 mg/kg). Fifty-five rats given M-SR were divided into three groups: group A received 1.0 mL subcutaneous emulsion containing vehicle; groups B and C had emulsions injected subcutaneously at the same time as the M-SR (B-250 mg/kg alphadolone; C-alphaxalone 80 mg/kg). RESULTS: Tail flick latency responses (percentage of maximum possible effect [% MPE]) to M-IR were reduced from 89.6 +/- 2.5 pretreatment to 20.3 +/- 4.8 after M-SR treatment (mean +/- SEM; P &lt; 0.001, one-way anova). Coadministration of alphadolone emulsion with the M-SR caused no sedation and prevented the occurrence of morphine tolerance. TFL responses to M-IR (6.25 mg/kg) given to morphine tolerant rats were 29 +/- 8% MPE whereas the TFL was 78.6 +/- 9.8% MPE when immediate release alphadolone (10 mg/kg ip) was injected at the same time as M-IR to tolerant rats (P &lt; 0.001 one-way anova). Alphaxalone treatment caused sedation and no effects on morphine tolerance. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that the alphadolone can prevent morphine tolerance and it also restores normal morphine antinociception in rats with established morphine tolerance. The lack of sedation suggests clinical utility in human pain states requiring morphine.",M1
19679639,"Biomarkers of morphine <e>tolerance</e> and dependence are prevented by morphine-induced endocytosis of a mutant mu-opioid receptor.Growing evidence shows that trafficking of the mu-opioid receptor (MOR) is a critical process in functional recovery from desensitization following activation and plays important roles in morphine tolerance and dependence largely because of the failure of morphine to promote such trafficking. However, morphine tolerance and dependence are believed to be mediated by multiple mechanisms, including well-documented biochemical changes in cAMP activity, N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs), glucocorticoid receptors (GRs), and c-fos. Here, we assess the consequences of promoting morphine-induced endocytosis on these biochemical changes utilizing a knock-in mouse model, RMOR, in which MORs undergo morphine-induced endocytosis. Chronic morphine treatment of wild-type (WT) mice promoted superactivation of adenylyl cyclase, alterations in NMDARs, and up-regulation of GR and c-fos in distinct brain regions. Notably, none of these biochemical changes occurred in the RMOR-knock-in mice. Together, these data demonstrate that morphine tolerance and dependence are mediated by multiple biochemical mechanisms and that MOR endocytosis plays a critical role in each of these mechanisms.",M1
19674045,"Improved seizure control by alternating therapy of levetiracetam and valproate in epileptic rats.PURPOSE: <e>Tolerance</e> to drug treatment is a serious problem in the treatment of epilepsy. We previously showed that tolerance to levetiracetam (LEV) developed within 4 days after the start of the treatment in a rat model for spontaneous seizures after electrically induced status epilepticus. In the current study we tested whether the development of tolerance to LEV could be prevented by alternating between LEV and valproate (VPA) treatment. METHODS: Before starting the alternating therapy with LEV and VPA (3 day LEV-3 day VPA, two cycles), we assessed the efficacy of VPA monotherapy by administering VPA to chronic epileptic rats via osmotic minipumps during 7 days. The anticonvulsive effects were determined by continuous video-EEG (electroencephalography) monitoring, and the concentration of VPA and LEV was measured in plasma using gas chromatography. RESULTS: VPA significantly suppressed spontaneous seizures in chronic epileptic rats for 5 days. Hereafter, seizure frequency increased to pretreatment values despite adequate VPA blood levels. Seizure duration was reduced for 6 days during treatment. Seizure severity was reduced throughout the 7-day treatment period. Alternating treatment of LEV and VPA did not prevent development of tolerance; however, seizures were suppressed significantly longer compared to VPA and LEV monotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: Because alternating treatment with LEV and VPA led to a prolonged effective seizure control in the animal model, it would be worthwhile to explore the possibilities of using an alternating treatment protocol in pharmacoresistant patients in whom an effective treatment is hampered by tolerance to antiepileptic drugs.",M1
19665790,"Solvent <e>tolerance</e> acquired by Brevibacillus brevis during an olive-waste vermicomposting process.In this work, a cultivable, Gram-positive, solvent-resistant bacterium was isolated from vermicomposted olive wastes (VOW). The highest 16S rRNA sequence similarity (99%) was found in Brevibacillus brevis. The genome of the isolate, selected for trichloroethylene (TCE)-tolerance, contained a nucleotide sequence encoding a conserved protein domain (ACR_tran) ascribable to the HAE1-RND family. Members of this family are hydrophobic/amphiphilic efflux pumps largely restricted to Gram-negative bacteria. No DNA sequences of HAE1 transporters were detected in the genome of a reference B. brevis strain isolated from natural soil. Since no cultivable solvent-tolerant bacterium was detected in the unvermicomposted olive waste, a transfer of solvent-resistance genes from Gram-negative bacteria during the vermicomposting process could explain the presence of HAE1 transporters in B. brevis isolated from the vermicompost. Under TCE stress conditions, the acquired nucleotide sequence could be translated into proteins, and the tolerance to solvents is conferred to the bacterium. The isolate was designated as strain BEA1 (EF079071).",M1
19664608,"Glutamate modulation of antinociception, but not <e>tolerance</e>, produced by morphine microinjection into the periaqueductal gray of the rat.The periaqueductal gray (PAG) plays an important role in morphine antinociception and tolerance. Co-localization of mu-opioid and NMDA receptors on dendrites in the PAG suggests that glutamate may modulate morphine antinociception. Moreover, the involvement of glutamate in spinally mediated tolerance to morphine suggests that glutamate receptors may contribute to PAG mediated tolerance. These hypotheses were tested by microinjecting glutamate receptor antagonists and morphine into the ventrolateral PAG (vPAG) of the rat. Microinjection of the non-specific glutamate receptor antagonist kynurenic acid or the NMDA receptor antagonist MK-801 into the vPAG did not affect nociception. However, co-administration of these antagonists with morphine into the vPAG enhanced the acute antinociceptive effects of morphine as measured by a leftward shift in the morphine dose-response curves. Repeated microinjections of morphine into the vPAG caused a rightward shift in the dose-response curve for antinociception whether the glutamate receptor antagonists kynurenic acid or MK-801 were co-administered or not. The lack of effect of microinjecting glutamate receptor antagonists into the vPAG indicates that tonic glutamate release in the PAG does not contribute to nociceptive tone. That these antagonists enhance morphine antinociception indicates that endogenous glutamate counteracts the antinociceptive effect of morphine in the vPAG. However, this compensatory glutamate release does not contribute to tolerance to the antinociceptive effects of microinjecting morphine into the vPAG. Previous research showing that glutamate contributes to spinal mechanisms of tolerance indicate that different tolerance mechanisms are engaged in the vPAG and spinal cord.",M1
19658277,"Effects of chronic administration of calcium-magnesium soft gels on morphine <e>tolerance</e> and dependence in mice.The aim of present study was to assess the effects of chronic administration of calcium-magnesium soft gels on the development of morphine tolerance and dependence in mice. Tolerance was assessed using the tail-pinch test and withdrawal signs of morphine were precipitated by injecting naloxone 2 h after the final morphine injection. CalMag capsules were given in final doses of 50/25, 25/12.5 and 12.5/6.25 mg/kg based on calcium/magnesium ratio. Similar doses of Ca and/or Mg were prepared, separately. CalMag at 50/25, 25/12.5 mg/kg and the mixture of calcium and magnesium (Ca + Mg) at 50/25, 25/12.5, 12.5/6.25 mg/kg and calcium at 50, 25 mg/kg significantly reduced the number of jumps. The number of standings was only reduced after the administration of CalMag at 50/25 mg/kg and Ca + Mg at 25/12.5 mg/kg. The development of morphine tolerance was prevented in all drug-treated groups, except the one which received 6.25 mg/kg Mg. The data suggested that combination of calcium and magnesium at 50/25 and 25/12.5 mg/kg prevented the development of tolerance and dependence. It seems that other ingredients of CalMag capsules do not have an important effect on preventing tolerance and withdrawal signs. Compared to the acute effects, chronic administration of Cal-Mag allowed the effective dose to be reduced. Unlike the acute treatment, chronic administration of calcium alone was effective in reducing morphine tolerance and dependence, and magnesium had no significant effect on withdrawal signs, suggestive of some pharmacological adaptations.",M1
19653792,"Environmental and pharmacological factors in the development of noncontingent <e>tolerance</e> to cocaine in pigeons.Previous research with rats and monkeys has shown that tolerance to behavioral effects of cocaine developed if the drug was administered before behavioral test sessions but not if it was administered after sessions, a finding known as contingent tolerance. In contrast, a recent experiment using pigeons found that they showed tolerance resulting from postsession drug administration (noncontingent tolerance). The 4 experiments reported in this article were conducted to examine that result more fully. Experiment 1 found that immediate presession administration of cocaine to pigeons reliably led to tolerance to effects on food-reinforced operant key pecking and that immediate postsession administration of cocaine also led to tolerance in half the subjects, those whose key pecking was not suppressed by postsession dosing. Experiment 2 showed that eating in the home cage under the effects of postsession cocaine was not necessary for tolerance to develop to effects of postsession cocaine and that the majority of subjects developed tolerance from postsession cocaine administration. Experiment 3 found that mere drug exposure in the home cage without exposure to an experimental session did not reliably produce tolerance during the behavioral session. Experiment 4 showed that tolerance from postsession cocaine administration could be observed even when daily dosing was discontinued during dose-response curve assessment. Therefore, the combined results showed that pigeons often developed tolerance to effects of cocaine during the behavioral session when cocaine was administered postsession and that this tolerance was not the result of feeding under effects of the drug.",M1
19646456,"Early methylphenidate exposure enhances morphine antinociception and <e>tolerance</e> in adult rats.Methylphenidate (MPH) is often used to reduce the symptoms of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder. Early MPH treatment in rats has been shown to enhance adult morphine-induced antinociception. Although this enhanced antinociception could improve pain treatment, it could also lead to enhanced tolerance to morphine. This hypothesis was tested by examining the effects of MPH administration during the pre-weanling period on morphine-induced antinociception and tolerance in adulthood. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats received daily IP injections of saline or MPH (2 or 5 mg/kg) for 10 consecutive days beginning on post-natal day (PD) 11. At 60 days of age, morphine (0, 1.8, 3.2, 5.6, 10.0, and 18 mg/kg) antinociception was assessed. Beginning one day later, rats received two daily injections of either saline or morphine (5 mg/kg) for two consecutive days to induce tolerance. On PD 63 cumulative doses of morphine were administered as before to assess the development of tolerance. Rats pretreated with MPH showed enhanced acute morphine antinociception compared to saline pretreated controls. In addition, tolerance to morphine was greater in rats pretreated with MPH early in life. The magnitude of this decrease in morphine potency was dependent on the dose of MPH, such that animals that received 5 mg/kg of MPH from PD 11 to 20 showed the greatest tolerance. These findings demonstrate that MPH exposure during the pre-weanling period has long-lasting effects that include enhanced morphine antinociception and tolerance.",M1
19645731,"An assay for evoked locomotor behavior in Drosophila reveals a role for integrins in ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol <e>tolerance</e>.BACKGROUND: Ethanol induces similar behavioral responses in mammals and the fruit fly, Drosophila melanogaster. By coupling assays for ethanol-related behavior to the genetic tools available in flies, a number of genes have been identified that influence physiological responses to ethanol. To enhance the utility of the Drosophila model for investigating genes involved in ethanol-related behavior, we explored the value of an assay that measures the sedative effects of ethanol on negative geotaxis, an evoked locomotor response. METHODS: We established eRING (ethanol Rapid Iterative Negative Geotaxis) as an assay for quantitating the sedative effects of ethanol on negative geotaxis (i.e., startle-induced climbing). We validated the assay by assessing acute sensitivity to ethanol and rapid ethanol tolerance in several different control strains and in flies with mutations known to disrupt these behaviors. We also used eRING in a candidate screen to identify mutants with altered ethanol-related behaviors. RESULTS: Negative geotaxis measured in eRING assays was dose-dependently impaired by ethanol exposure. Flies developed tolerance to the intoxicating effects of ethanol when tested during a second exposure. Ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol tolerance varied across 4 control strains, but internal ethanol concentrations were indistinguishable in the 4 strains during a first and second challenge with ethanol. Ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol tolerance, respectively, were altered in flies with mutations in amnesiac and hangover, genes known to influence these traits. Additionally, mutations in the beta integrin gene myospheroid and the alpha integrin gene scab increased the initial sensitivity to ethanol and enhanced the development of rapid ethanol tolerance without altering internal ethanol concentrations. CONCLUSIONS: The eRING assay is suitable for investigating genetic mechanisms that influence ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol tolerance. Ethanol sensitivity and rapid ethanol tolerance depend on the function of alpha and beta integrins in flies.",M1

Ethanol produced by yeast fermentation is inhibitory to both yeast cell growth and metabolisms, and consequently is one of the key stress elements of brewer's yeast. Research on the biochemical and molecular mechanism of the tolerance of yeast can provide basis for breeding of yeast strain with improved ethanol tolerance. In recent years, employing global gene transcriptional analysis and functional analysis, new knowledge on the biochemical and molecular mechanisms of yeast ethanol tolerance has been accumulated, and novel genes and biochemical parameters related to ethanol tolerance have been revealed. Based on these studies, the overexpression and/or disruption of the related genes have successfully resulted in the breeding of new yeast strains with improved ethanol tolerance. This paper reviewed the recent research progress on the molecular mechanism of yeast ethanol tolerance, as well as the genetic engineering manipulations to improve yeast ethanol tolerance. The studies reviewed here not only deepened our knowledge on yeast ethanol tolerance, but also provided basis for more efficient bioconversion for bio-energy production.",M1

For example, a large number of Foxp3(+)Tregs infiltrate into tumors, and systemic removal of Foxp3(+)Tregs enhances natural as well as vaccine-induced antitumor T-cell responses. Tregs are recruited to tumor tissues via chemokines, such as CCL22 binding to CCR4 expressed by Tregs. They appear to expand and become activated in tumor tissues and in the draining lymph nodes by recognizing tumor-associated antigens as well as normal self-antigen expressed by tumor cells. These results indicate that cancer vaccines targeting tumor-associated self-antigens may potentially expand/activate Tregs and hamper effective antitumor immune responses, and that tumor immunity can therefore be enhanced by depleting Tregs, attenuating Treg suppressive function, or rendering effector T cells refractory to Treg-mediated suppression. Recent attempts have indeed demonstrated that combinations of monoclonal antibodies capable of modulating Treg functions synergistically enhance antitumor activity and are more effective than a single monoclonal antibody therapy. Combination therapy targeting a variety of molecules expressed in antigen-presenting cells, effector T cells and Tregs is envisaged to be a promising anticancer immunotherapy.",M2
20501946,"Identification of a B cell signature associated with renal transplant <e>tolerance</e> in humans.Establishing long-term allograft acceptance without the requirement for continuous immunosuppression, a condition known as allograft tolerance, is a highly desirable therapeutic goal in solid organ transplantation. Determining which recipients would benefit from withdrawal or minimization of immunosuppression would be greatly facilitated by biomarkers predictive of tolerance. In this study, we identified the largest reported cohort to our knowledge of tolerant renal transplant recipients, as defined by stable graft function and receiving no immunosuppression for more than 1 year, and compared their gene expression profiles and peripheral blood lymphocyte subsets with those of subjects with stable graft function who are receiving immunosuppressive drugs as well as healthy controls. In addition to being associated with clinical and phenotypic parameters, renal allograft tolerance was strongly associated with a B cell signature using several assays. Tolerant subjects showed increased expression of multiple B cell differentiation genes, and a set of just 3 of these genes distinguished tolerant from nontolerant recipients in a unique test set of samples. This B cell signature was associated with upregulation of CD20 mRNA in urine sediment cells and elevated numbers of peripheral blood naive and transitional B cells in tolerant participants compared with those receiving immunosuppression. These results point to a critical role for B cells in regulating alloimmunity and provide a candidate set of genes for wider-scale screening of renal transplant recipients.",M2

In this study, we aimed to develop reliable and reproducible in vitro assays capable of detecting tolerance in renal transplant recipients. Several biomarkers and bioassays were screened on a training set that included 11 operationally tolerant renal transplant recipients, recipient groups following different immunosuppressive regimes, recipients undergoing chronic rejection, and healthy controls. Highly predictive assays were repeated on an independent test set that included 24 tolerant renal transplant recipients. Tolerant patients displayed an expansion of peripheral blood B and NK lymphocytes, fewer activated CD4+ T cells, a lack of donor-specific antibodies, donor-specific hyporesponsiveness of CD4+ T cells, and a high ratio of forkhead box P3 to alpha-1,2-mannosidase gene expression. Microarray analysis further revealed in tolerant recipients a bias toward differential expression of B cell-related genes and their associated molecular pathways. By combining these indices of tolerance as a cross-platform biomarker signature, we were able to identify tolerant recipients in both the training set and the test set. This study provides an immunological profile of the tolerant state that, with further validation, should inform and shape drug-weaning protocols in renal transplant recipients.",M2

Previous studies demonstrated that blocking IKK2 in bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDC) by adenoviral transfection with a kinase-defective dominant negative form of IKK2 (IKK2dn) could inhibit NF-kappaB activation and impair DC maturation. Here, we transfected IKK2dn into recipient rat (Lewis) BMDC by adenovirus vector (Adv-IKK2dn-DC) and found that Adv-IKK2dn-DC had reduced B7-2 and B7-1 expression under alloantigen stimulation. Their ability to induce allogeneic T-cell proliferation was markedly reduced in comparison with uninfected DC. A higher IL-10 secretion and a lower IFN-gamma secretion were detected in Adv-IKK2dn-DC-stimulated allogenic T cells. Furthermore, we showed that Adv-IKK2dn-DC pulsed with BN (Brown Norway rats) splenocyte lysates markedly prolonged the survival of renal allografts in an antigen-specific manner. These findings suggested that Adv-IKK2dn-DC loaded with BN antigen could suppress anti-alloimmune response and induce tolerance to allografts, which provided an experimental base for immune tolerance induction by recipient DC loaded with donor antigens.

20500682,"Primary immunodeficiency and autoimmunity: lessons from human diseases.Primary immunodeficiency diseases (PID) are a genetically heterogenous group of &gt;150 disorders that affect distinct components of the innate and adaptive immune system and are often associated with autoimmune diseases. We describe PID affecting T-regulatory cells, complement and B cells or their products and discuss the possibility of a cause-effect relationship. The high concordance of T-regulatory cell defects to organ-specific autoimmune disease implies an obligatory role of these cells in maintaining <e>tolerance</e> to epithelial and endocrine tissues; the absence of central nervous system involvement may reflect immunological privilege. Congenital defects in C1q, C1r/s and C4 are strongly associated with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), and this pattern along with laboratory evidence suggests a major importance of classical pathway activity in safe elimination of immune complexes and prevention of immune complex disease (ICD). It is debatable whether this ICD is to be regarded as an autoimmune disease (resulting from a breakdown of immunological ignorance to antigens that are normally hidden), as autoantibodies may be absent, and tissue damage because of deposition of immune complexes could account for all of the pathology observed. Evidence for a causative link between primary antibody deficiencies and autoimmune disease is much less compelling and may in fact involve a common genetic background. However, arguments have also been made in favour of the notion that an intense antigen load as a result of recurrent or persistent infections may affect either tolerance or ignorance, e.g. by molecular mimicry or the presence of superantigens. Similar immunological mechanisms might account for the vast majority of autoimmune diseases.",M2

GRAIL-deficient naive T cells, after activation, exhibited increased proliferation and cytokine expression than controls and did not depend on costimulation for effector generation. Moreover, GRAIL-deficient regulatory T (Treg) cells displayed reduced suppressive function, associated with increased Th17 cell-related gene expression. GRAIL-deficient naive and Treg cells were less efficient in downregulating T cell receptor (TCR)-CD3 expression after activation and exhibited increased NFATc1 transcription factor expression; GRAIL expression promoted CD3 ubiquitinylation.

20483762,"Blockade of CCL1 inhibits T regulatory cell suppressive function enhancing tumor immunity without affecting T effector responses.Intratumoral accumulation of T regulatory cells (Tregs) creates an immunosuppressive environment that reduces the efficacy of antitumor immunotherapy. The immunosuppressive milieu within tumors is largely brought about by the presence of Tregs, which maintain self-<e>tolerance</e> by directly inhibiting T cells, NK cells, and dendritic cells. Depletion of Tregs enhances antitumor immune responses; however, current depletion therapies also affect the function of CD4 and CD8 T effector cells. Previous studies from our laboratory indicate that intratumoral delivery of CpG-ODN strongly reduces the levels of Tregs within the tumor, which is mainly mediated by IL-6. Because IL-6 promotes growth of some human cancers, alternate pathways to inactivate Tregs were sought through microarray analysis, resulting in gene candidates that can be exploited to modulate the function of Tregs. Analysis of these candidates indicates that neutralization of chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 1 (CCL1) prevented de novo conversion and suppressive function of Tregs without affecting the function of T effector cells. The combination of CpG-ODN and anti-CCL1 treatments induced complete rejection of tumors in BALB-neuT tolerant mice, and result in the generation of long-term protective memory responses. Tumor rejection correlated with changes in the lymphocyte composition within the tumor; we observed decreased Treg numbers and a concomitant accumulation of tumoricidal cells such as CD8+NKG2D+ and NK cells. These studies demonstrate that neutralization of CCL1 can be used as an adjuvant to antitumor immunotherapy, as a means of reversing the immunosuppressive function of Tregs without compromising T cell effector function.",M2
20483761,"Diversity of TCRs on natural Foxp3+ T cells in mice lacking Aire expression.Medullary thymic epithelial cells expressing the Aire gene play a critical role in the induction of <e>tolerance</e> to tissue-specific Ags (TSAs). It was postulated that recognition of Aire-controlled TSAs by immature thymocytes results in the selection of natural CD4+Foxp3+ regulatory T cells (Tregs) and enriches this repertoire in self-reactive receptors, contributing to its vast diversity. In this study, we compared the TCRs on individual Tregs in Aire+ and Aire- mice expressing a miniature TCR repertoire (TCRmini) along with GFP driven by the Foxp3 promoter (Foxp3GFP). The Treg TCR repertoires in Aire+ and Aire- TCRminiFoxp3GFP mice were similar and more diverse than their repertoires on CD4+ Foxp3- thymocytes. Further, TCRs found on potentially self-reactive T cells, with an activated phenotype (CD4+Foxp3-CD62Llow) in Aire- TCRminiFoxp3GFP mice, appear distinct from TCRs found on Tregs in Aire+ TCRminiFoxp3GFP mice. Lastly, we found no evidence that TSAs presented by medullary thymic epithelial cells in Aire+TCRmini mice are often recognized as agonists by Treg-derived TCR hybridomas or CD4+CD25+ thymocytes, containing both natural Tregs and precursors. Thus, positive selection and self-reactivity of the global Treg repertoire are not controlled by Aire-dependent TSAs.",M2
20483758,"Human intestinal lamina propria CD1c+ dendritic cells display an activated phenotype at steady state and produce IL-23 in response to TLR7/8 stimulation.Intestinal dendritic cells (DCs) play key roles in mediating <e>tolerance</e> to commensal flora and inflammatory responses against mucosal pathogens. The mechanisms by which intestinal  conditioning  influences human DC responses to microbial stimuli remain poorly understood. Infections with viruses, such as HIV-1, that target mucosal tissue result in intestinal epithelial barrier breakdown and increased translocation of commensal bacteria into the lamina propria (LP). It is unclear whether innate LP DC responses to concurrent viral and bacterial stimuli influence mucosal HIV-1 pathogenesis. In this study, direct ex vivo phenotype and in vitro constitutive cytokine production of CD1c+ DCs in human intestinal LP were compared with those in peripheral blood (PB). To evaluate innate responses to viral and bacterial stimuli, intracellular cytokine production by LP and PB DCs following stimulation with ligands for TLRs 2, 4, 5, and 7/8 was evaluated. At steady state, LP CD1c+ DCs expressed higher levels of activation markers (CD40, CD83, CD86, HLA-DR, and CCR7) than did PB CD1c+ DCs, and higher frequencies of LP CD1c+ DCs constitutively produced IL-6 and -10 and TNF-alpha. LP DCs had blunted cytokine responses to TLR4 ligand and TLR5 ligand stimulation relative to PB DCs, yet similarly produced IL-10 in response to TLR2 ligand. Only synthetic TLR7/8 ligand, a mimic of viral ssRNA, induced IL-23 production by LP CD1c+ DCs, and this proinflammatory cytokine response was synergistically enhanced following combined TLR7/8 and TLR4 stimulation. These findings highlight a potential mechanism by which viruses like HIV-1 may subvert homeostatic mechanisms and induce inflammation in the intestinal mucosa.",M2
20478618,"Bystander suppression to unrelated allergen sensitization through intranasal administration of tolerogenic exosomes in mouse.Exosomes represent a new family of bioactive nanovesicles (30-100 nm in diameter) secreted by different cell types whose appealing features can be exploited for designing vaccines in the context of several human diseases. We previously reported the potential of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF)-derived tolerogenic exosomes (Exo(Tol)) to be used as a nasal allergy vaccine in a mouse model of sensitization to Ole e 1, the main allergen of olive pollen. The aim of the study was to investigate whether such nanovesicles specific to Ole e 1 can also prevent the sensitization to other unrelated allergen, as Bet v 1 from birch pollen. Exo(Tol) were isolated from BALF of mice tolerized against Ole e 1 and used in a prophylactic approach. BALB/c mice were intranasally pretreated with Exo(Tol) one week before sensitization/challenge with Bet v 1, and the magnitude of allergen-specific response was analyzed. Intranasal pretreatment with Exo(Tol) resulted in significant inhibition of both specific IgE and IgG1 antibodies levels. Moreover, T cells from mice pretreated with Exo(Tol) showed a reduction in IL-5 and IL-13 (Th2 cytokines) production. Lung inflammatory response triggered by unrelated allergen-challenge was also significantly reduced after pretreatment: perivascular/peribronchial inflammatory cell infiltration, eosinophilia and mucus secretion. In conclusion, Exo(Tol) specific to Ole e 1, in addition to inhibit specific immune response to this allergen, blocked the allergic response to a second unrelated allergen such as Bet v 1. The in vivo  bystander suppression  that we herein describe for Exo(Tol) may have implications for the treatment of allergy based on mucosal <e>tolerance</e> induction.",M2
20463639,"Study on systemic immune <e>tolerance</e> induction in rat islet transplantation by intravenous infusion of Sertoli cells.BACKGROUND: Sertoli cells are usually co-transplanted with pancreatic islets to induce local immune tolerance. In this report, we used infusion with Sertoli cells in islet transplantation to induce systemic immune tolerance and studied the mechanism of the tolerance induction. METHODS: Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were divided into four groups before islet transplantation: group A as control; group B with intravenous infusion of Sertoli cells; group C with Sertoli cell infusion and Fas ligand antibody treatment; and group D with Sertoli cell infusion and transforming growth factor-beta1 antibody treatment. The mean survival time (MST) and insulin expression of islet grafts were measured. The number of lymphocytes and the levels of cytokines in peripheral blood were also measured. RESULTS: Group B had the longest MST of islet allografts (41.6+/-4.20 days) followed by groups C, D, and A (P&lt;0.05). Immunohistochemistry showed similar results with MST. The rats in group B had the least CD4 T cells (only 15.6%+/-6.4%) compared with other groups (P&lt;0.05). The numbers of CD8 T cells in rats of groups B (11.2%+/-4.3%) and D (14.5%+/-5.6%) were significantly lower than those of groups A and C (P&lt;0.05). After transplantation, group B's interleukin (IL)-2 level (1.92+/-0.68 ng/mL) was found to be significantly lower than that of other groups (P&lt;0.05). Interferon-gamma showed similar pattern of change as IL-2 (P&lt;0.05). Groups A and D had significantly lower levels of IL-4 (4.31+/-1.97 pg/mL 4.69+/-1.33 pg/mL, respectively) than groups B and C (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Infusion of Sertoli cells could effectively prolong the survival of islet grafts and reduce peripheral blood lymphocyte and cytokine levels. In this process, transforming growth factor-beta1 played a major role and Fas ligand played a smaller additional role.",M2
20439708,"Pregnancy induces a fetal antigen-specific maternal T regulatory cell response that contributes to <e>tolerance</e>.A fetus is inherently antigenic to its mother and yet is not rejected. The T regulatory (Treg) subset of CD4(+) T cells can limit immune responses and has been implicated in maternal tolerance of the fetus. Using virgin inbred mice undergoing a first syngenic pregnancy, in which only the male fetuses are antigenic, we demonstrate a maternal splenocyte proliferative response to the CD4(+) T cell restricted epitope of the male antigen (H-Y) in proportion to the fetal antigen load. A portion of the maternal immune response to fetal antigens is Treg in nature. The bystander suppressive function of pregnancy-generated Tregs requires the presence of the fetal antigen, demonstrating their inherent antigen specificity. In vivo targeting of diphtheria toxin to kill Tregs leads to a lower fraction of live male offspring and a selective reduction in mass of the surviving males. Thus, Tregs generated in the context of pregnancy function in an antigen-specific manner to limit the maternal immune response to the fetus in a successful pregnancy.",M2
20435935,"Cutting Edge: Rag deletion in peripheral T cells blocks TCR revision.Mature CD4(+)Vbeta5(+) T cells that recognize a peripherally expressed endogenous superantigen are tolerized either by deletion or TCR revision. In Vbeta5 transgenic mice, this latter <e>tolerance</e> pathway results in the appearance of CD4(+)Vbeta5(-)TCRbeta(+) T cells, coinciding with Rag1, Rag2, and TdT expression and the accumulation of V(beta)-DJ(beta) recombination intermediates in peripheral CD4(+) T cells. Because postthymic RAG-dependent TCR rearrangement has remained controversial, we sought to definitively determine whether TCR revision is an extrathymic process that occurs in mature peripheral T cells. We show in this study that Rag deletion in post-positive selection T cells in Vbeta5 transgenic mice blocks TCR revision in vivo and that mature peripheral T cells sorted to remove cells bearing endogenous TCRbeta-chains can express newly generated TCRbeta molecules in adoptive hosts. These findings unambiguously demonstrate postthymic, RAG-dependent TCR rearrangement and define TCR revision as a tolerance pathway that targets mature peripheral CD4(+) T cells.",M2
20435934,"Maintenance of immune <e>tolerance</e> to a neo-self acetylcholine receptor antigen with aging: implications for late-onset autoimmunity.Age-related changes in immune regulation are likely to account for the age-associated increase in serum autoantibody levels and in certain autoimmune disorders, such as myasthenia gravis (MG). To demonstrate directly a loss of immune tolerance in older individuals, responses to the acetylcholine receptor, the autoantigen in MG, were assessed in transgenic mice expressing the Torpedo californica acetylcholine receptor (TAChR) alpha-chain as a neo-self Ag. T cells from young transgenic mice had been shown to be tolerant to p146-162, the TAChR alpha-chain peptide that dominated young nontransgenic T cell responses in vitro. The immunodominance of p146-162 was not lost with age; fine specificity was preserved. Moreover, T cell tolerance to p146-162, as well as to other epitopes of the TAChR alpha-chain extracellular domain, was maintained in old transgenic mice. Even multiple TAChR immunizations coupled with the MG-enhancing cytokine, IL-12, did not break tolerance. In addition, T cells exhibiting CD4 upregulation, an early activation marker, were reduced in frequency equivalently in old and young transgenic animals, suggesting that immune regulation in this model was not impacted by aging. Moreover, B cell tolerance was also maintained with age. The persistence of immune tolerance was accompanied by an increase in the proportion of T regulatory cells; it is speculated that this may compensate for deficiencies in central tolerance that occur owing to thymic involution. In summary, our study reveals, for the first time, that some immune tolerance mechanisms do survive aging; this suggests that certain late-onset autoimmune disorders may be induced by a specific insult that disrupts immune homeostasis.",M2
20431619,"Autonomous role of medullary thymic epithelial cells in central CD4(+) T cell <e>tolerance</e>.Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) serve an essential function in central tolerance by expressing peripheral-tissue antigens. These antigens may be transferred to and presented by dendritic cells (DCs). Therefore, it is unclear whether mTECs, in addition to being an antigen reservoir, also serve a mandatory function as antigen-presenting cells. Here we diminished major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II on mTECs through transgenic expression of a 'designer' microRNA specific for the MHC class II transactivator CIITA (called 'C2TA' here). This resulted in an enlarged polyclonal CD4(+) single-positive compartment and, among thymocytes specific for model antigens expressed in mTECs, enhanced selection of regulatory T cells (T(reg) cells) at the expense of deletion. Our data document an autonomous contribution of mTECs to both dominant and recessive mechanisms of CD4(+) T cell tolerance and support an avidity model of T(reg) cell development versus deletion.",M2
20428785,"Development of selective immune <e>tolerance</e> towards the allogeneic fetus during pregnancy: Role of tryptophan catabolites (Review).Studies in recent years have shown that the selective expression of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) in certain cell populations may play an important role in mediating immunosuppression. Mechanistically, since IDO is a rate-limiting enzyme of the kynurenine pathway responsible for tryptophan catabolism, the prevailing explanation for its immunosuppressive action is based on the assumption that the presence of IDO in selected cell populations would consume local tryptophan and subsequently starve adjacent maternal T-cells of this essential amino acid. In this review, an alternative hypothesis is discussed, which suggests that IDO is mainly expressed in various types of antigen-presenting cells (such as placental syncytiotrophoblasts during pregnancy), and that its main function is to produce biologically-active tryptophan catabolites that will mediate immunosuppression. Mechanistically, because these tryptophan catabolites are concentrated in a microenvironment surrounding the IDO-expressing dendritic cells, they will selectively suppress the proliferation of a sub-population of T-cells that are activated by the allogeneic antigen-presenting cells and ultimately wipe out this T-cell sub-population. Evidence in support of this new mechanistic explanation is discussed. This hypothesis provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for the development of selective immune tolerance towards the allogeneic fetus during pregnancy. Moreover, it also offers insights into the functional role of certain tryptophan catabolites produced by cancer cells in evading the body's immune surveillance, as well as the potential usefulness of tryptophan catabolites as pharmacological agents for the induction of selective long-term immune tolerance towards the allogeneic organ transplant.",M2
20427770,"RORC2 is involved in T cell polarization through interaction with the FOXP3 promoter.The process of Th cell differentiation toward polarized effector T cells tailors specific immunity against invading pathogens while allowing <e>tolerance</e> against commensal microorganisms, harmless allergens, or autologous Ags. Identification of the mechanisms underlying this polarization process is therefore central to understand how the immune system confers immunity and tolerance. The present study demonstrates that retinoic acid receptor-related orphan receptor C2 (RORC2), a key transcription factor in Th17 cell development, inhibits FOXP3 expression in human T cells. Although overexpression of RORC2 in naive T cells reduces levels of FOXP3, small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of RORC2 enhances its expression. RORC2 mediates this inhibition at least partially by binding to two out of four ROR-responsive elements on the FOXP3 promoter. Knockdown of RORC2 promotes high FOXP3 levels and decreased expression of proinflammatory cytokines beta form of pro-IL-1, IL-6, IL-17A, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha in differentiating naive T cells, suggesting that the role of RORC2 in Th17 cell development involves not only induction of Th17-characteristic genes, but also suppression of regulatory T cell-specific programs. Together, this study identifies RORC2 as a polarizing factor in transcriptional cross-regulation and provides novel viewpoints on the control of immune tolerance versus effector immune responses.",M2
20427765,"Cutting edge: delay and reversal of T cell <e>tolerance</e> by intratumoral injection of antigen-loaded dendritic cells in an autochthonous tumor model.The tumor environment exerts a powerful suppressive influence on infiltrating tumor-reactive T cells. It induces tolerance of adoptively transferred effector T cells as they enter tumors and maintains the tolerance of persisting tumor-infiltrating T cells. In an autochthonous prostate cancer model, in which tumor-reactive CD8 T cells are trackable, we demonstrate that both depletion of endogenous dendritic cells (DCs) and intratumoral injection of Ag-loaded mature DCs delayed the tolerization of tumor-infiltrating effector CD8 T cells. Intratumoral injection of Ag-loaded DCs also reactivated tolerized CD8 T cells in the tumor tissue. The observed effects lasted as long as the injected DCs persisted. These findings are consistent with a critical role of DCs in modulating T cell reactivity in the tumor environment. They also suggest new potential strategies to extend the functionality of transferred effector T cells and to restore function to tolerized tumor-infiltrating T cells for cancer immunotherapy.",M2

Looking forward, this review discusses the potential therapeutic use of antigen-specific <e>tolerance</e> strategies, including tolerance induced by  tolerogenic  antigen-presenting cells pulsed with diabetogenic antigens and transfer of induced or expanded regulatory T cells, which have demonstrated efficacy in nonobese diabetic (NOD) mice.

20404275,"SMAD4 is required for development of maximal endotoxin <e>tolerance</e>.Initial exposure of monocytes/macrophages to LPS induces hyporesponsiveness to a second challenge with LPS, a phenomenon termed LPS tolerance. Molecular mechanisms responsible for endotoxin tolerance are not well defined. We and others have shown that IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK)-M and SHIP-1 proteins, negative regulators of TLR4 signaling, increase in tolerized cells. TGF-beta1, an anti-inflammatory cytokine, is upregulated following LPS stimulation, mediating its effect through SMAD family proteins. Using a monocytic cell line, THP1, we show that LPS activates endogenous SMAD4, inducing its migration into the nucleus and increasing its expression. Secondary challenge with high dose LPS following initial low-dose LPS exposure does not increase IRAK-M or SHIP1 protein expression in small hairpin (sh)SMAD4 THP-1 cells compared with control shLUC THP1 cells. TNF-alpha concentrations in culture supernatants after second LPS challenge are higher in shSMAD4 THP-1 cells than shLUC THP1 cells, indicating failure to induce maximal tolerance in absence of SMAD4 signaling. Identical results are seen in primary murine macrophages and mouse embryonic fibroblasts, demonstrating the biological significance of our findings. TGF-beta1 treatment does not increase IRAK-M or SHIP1 protein expression in shSMAD4 THP-1 cells, whereas it does so in shLUC THP1 cells, indicating that TGF-beta1 regulates IRAK-M and SHIP1 expression through a SMAD4-dependent pathway. Knockdown of endogenous SHIP1 by shSHIP1 RNA decreases native and inducible IRAK-M protein expression and prevents development of endotoxin tolerance in THP1 cells. We conclude that in THP-1 cells and primary murine cells, SMAD4 signaling is required for maximal induction of endotoxin tolerance via modulation of SHIP1 and IRAK-M.",M2
20404100,"Regulation of medullary thymic epithelial cell differentiation and function by the signaling protein Sin.Medullary thymic epithelial cells (mTECs) play an important role in T cell <e>tolerance</e> and prevention of autoimmunity. Mice deficient in expression of the signaling protein Sin exhibit exaggerated immune responses and multitissue inflammation. Here, we show that Sin is expressed in the thymic stroma, specifically in mTECs. Sin deficiency led to thymic stroma-dependent autoimmune manifestations shown by radiation chimeras and thymic transplants in nude mice, and associated with defective mTEC-mediated elimination of thymocytes in a T cell receptor transgenic model of negative selection. Lack of Sin expression correlated with a disorganized medullary architecture and fewer functionally mature mTECs under steady-state conditions. Additionally, Sin deficiency inhibited the expansion of mTECs in response to in vivo administration of keratinocyte growth factor (KGF). These results identify Sin as a novel regulator of mTEC development and T cell tolerance, and suggest that Sin is important for homeostatic maintenance of the medullary epithelium in the adult thymus.",M2
20402063,"Toll-like receptors 2 and 4 cell surface expression reflects endotoxin <e>tolerance</e> in Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura.We aimed to analyze the Toll-like receptor (TLR)2 and TLR4 expressions, which are known to be involved in the recognition of pathogens by the innate immune system, in patients with Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura. Twenty-three patients (10 males, 13 females, aged 4-16 years) with a clinical diagnosis of Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura were enrolled. Twenty healthy age-matched children (10 males, 10 females) served as controls. TLR2 and TLR4 expression levels on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were determined by flow cytometric analysis. PBMCs were cultured with heat shock protein (HSP) 60 (1 microg/ml) as an endogenous ligand for TLR. Levels of TLR2 and TLR4 expression on PBMC were significantly lower in the Henoch- Sch√∂nlein purpura patients compared to healthy controls when stimulated with HSP60 and with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) (p &lt; 0.05 for both). There was no significant difference between the stimulated and unstimulated samples from the patients. The lower TLR response to these ligands among these patients may reflect a tolerance to bacterial antigens. Further studies will clarify whether tolerance to microbial antigens may have a role in the pathogenesis and course of Henoch-Sch√∂nlein purpura.",M2
20400705,"ST2 negatively regulates TLR2 signaling, but is not required for bacterial lipoprotein-induced <e>tolerance</e>.Activation of TLR signaling is critical for host innate immunity against bacterial infection. Previous studies reported that the ST2 receptor, a member of the Toll/IL-1 receptor superfamily, functions as a negative regulator of TLR4 signaling and maintains LPS tolerance. However, it is undetermined whether ST2 negatively regulates TLR2 signaling and furthermore, whether a TLR2 agonist, bacterial lipoprotein (BLP)-induced tolerance is dependent on ST2. In this study, we show that BLP stimulation-induced production of proinflammatory cytokines and immunocomplex formation of TLR2-MyD88 and MyD88-IL-1R-associated kinase (IRAK) were significantly enhanced in ST2-deficient macrophages compared with those in wild-type controls. Furthermore, overexpression of ST2 dose-dependently attenuated BLP-induced NF-kappaB activation, suggesting a negative regulatory role of ST2 in TLR2 signaling. A moderate but significantly attenuated production of TNF-alpha and IL-6 on a second BLP stimulation was observed in BLP-pretreated, ST2-deficient macrophages, which is associated with substantially reduced IRAK-1 protein expression and downregulated TLR2-MyD88 and MyD88-IRAK immunocomplex formation. ST2-deficient mice, when pretreated with a nonlethal dose of BLP, benefitted from an improved survival against a subsequent lethal BLP challenge, indicating BLP tolerance develops in the absence of the ST2 receptor. Taken together, our results demonstrate that ST2 acts as a negative regulator of TLR2 signaling, but is not required for BLP-induced tolerance.",M2
20399959,"Breaking <e>tolerance</e> in a mouse model of multiple myeloma by chemoimmunotherapy.A unique mouse model of multiple myeloma (MM), namely 5T2MM-bearing mouse, was useful for elucidating the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying the disease. Increased accumulation of suppressive CD4(+)CD25(High)Foxp3(+) regulatory T cells (Tregs) was observed in the thymus and lymphoid peripheral organs during disease progression. Adoptive transfer of Tregs, but not other thymocytes, from 5T2MM-bearing mice led to increased progression of disease manifestations in young syngeneic mice. Depletion of Tregs, a proposed strategy in cancer immunotherapy, was tested using cyclophosphamide (CYC), an alkylating agent with selective cytotoxicity. Both low- and high-dose CYC, administered to sick mice with hind limb paralysis, caused the paralysis to disappear, the plasma tumor cells in the bone marrow (BM) cavity to be replaced by normal cell populations, and the survival of the mice to be significantly prolonged. Low-dose CYC, which selectively depletes Tregs, decreased MM incidence, in contrast to high-dose CYC, which was generally cytotoxic, and did not reduce MM incidence. In contrast, low-dose CYC induced Tregs to become susceptible to apoptosis by downregulating Bcl-xL and CTLA-4 in these cells, and by decreasing the production of IL-2 by effector CD4 cells. This treatment consequently triggered the recovery of IFN-gamma-producing natural killer T cells and the maturation of dendritic cells. Transient gradual depletion of Tregs in low-dose CYC-treated 5T2MM mice was maintained beyond 45 days. Thus, less frequent injections of low-dose CYC enabled us to recruit compatible immune-derived cells that would reduce tumor load and delay or prevent tumor recurrence, hence breaking immune tolerance toward MM tumor cells.",M2

20385881,"Activation of murine macrophages via TLR2 and TLR4 is negatively regulated by a Lyn/PI3K module and promoted by SHIP1.Src family kinases are involved in a plethora of aspects of cellular signaling. We demonstrate in this study that the Src family kinase Lyn negatively regulates TLR signaling in murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMM Phis) and in vivo. LPS-stimulated Lyn(-/-) BMM Phis produced significantly more IL-6, TNF-alpha, and IFN-alpha/beta compared with wild type (WT) BMM Phis, suggesting that Lyn is able to control both MyD88- and TRIF-dependent signaling pathways downstream of TLR4. CD14 was not involved in this type of regulation. Moreover, Lyn attenuated proinflammatory cytokine production in BMM Phis in response to the TLR2 ligand FSL-1, but not to ligands for TLR3 (dsRNA) or TLR9 (CpG 1668). In agreement with these in vitro experiments, Lyn-deficient mice produced higher amounts of proinflammatory cytokines than did WT mice after i. v. injection of LPS or FSL-1. Although Lyn clearly acted as a negative regulator downstream of TLR4 and TLR2, it did not, different from what was proposed previously, prevent the induction of LPS <e>tolerance</e>. Stimulation with a low dose of LPS resulted in reduced production of proinflammatory cytokines after subsequent stimulation with a high dose of LPS in both WT and Lyn(-/-) BMM Phis, as well as in vivo. Mechanistically, Lyn interacted with PI3K; in correlation, PI3K inhibition resulted in increased LPS-triggered cytokine production. In this line, SHIP1(-/-) BMM Phis, exerting enhanced PI3K-pathway activation, produced fewer cytokines than did WT BMM Phis. The data suggest that the Lyn-mediated negative regulation of TLR signaling proceeds, at least in part, via PI3K.",M2

20374380,"The immunological basis of B-cell therapy in systemic lupus erythematosus.Loss of B-cell <e>tolerance</e> is a hallmark feature of the pathogenesis in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), an autoimmune disease that is characterized by hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibody production. These autoantibodies lead to formation of immune-complex deposition in internal organs causing inflammation and damage. Autoreactive B-cells are believed to be central in the pathophysiology of SLE. Other than its role in the production of antibodies that mediate humoral immune response, B-cells also function as antigen-presenting cells and are capable of activating T-cells. Activated B-cells may also produce pro-inflammatory cytokines that aggravate local inflammation. Abnormal B-cell homeostasis has been described in SLE patients. This may occur as a result of intrinsic B-cell defect or from aberrant regulation by maturation and survival signals. B-cell-based therapy is the current mainstream of research and development of novel therapies in SLE patients with severe and refractory disease. Potential cellular and molecular targets for B-cell therapies include cell surface molecules such as CD20 (rituximab) and CD22 (epratuzumab); co-stimulatory molecules involved in B-cell-T-cell interaction such as CTLA4 and B7 molecules (abatacept); maturation and growth factors such as B-cell activating factor and a proliferation-inducing ligand (belimumab, briobacept, atacicept) and B-cell tolerogen (abetimus).

20373289,"Tolerogenicity is not an absolute property of a dendritic cell.Pharmacological modulation is known to temper the immune capacity of DC, enhancing the notion that modulated Ag-bearing DC might be used therapeutically to induce <e>tolerance</e>. We have investigated phenotypic features shared by such DC, and queried their potential to tolerize in different settings. Immature, IL-10, TGF-beta and 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D(3)-modulated BMDC all induced tolerance to male skin in female TCR transgenic A1.RAG mice, and the modulated DC also tolerized after exposure to the TLR4-ligand LPS. Transcript profiling revealed that this was achieved despite retaining much of the normal LPS-maturation response. No shared tolerance-associated transcripts could be identified. Equivalent BMDC could not tolerize in Marilyn TCR-transgenic mice. Simultaneous presentation of both A1.RAG and Marilyn peptide-Ag (Dby-H2E(k) and Dby-H2A(b)) on immature (C57BL/6JxCBA/Ca) F1 BMDC also only achieved tolerance in A1.RAG mice. Both strains registered Ag, but Foxp3(+) Treg were only induced in A1.RAG mice. In contrast, Marilyn T cells showed greater proliferation and an inflammatory bias, in response to Ag presented by immature F1 BMDC in vitro. In summary, while pharmacological agents can skew DC to reinforce their immature tolerogenic phenotype, the outcome of presentation is ultimately an integrated response including T-cell-intrinsic components that can over-ride for immune activation.",M2

20368155,"Expansion of allospecific regulatory T cells after anergized, mismatched bone marrow transplantation.Transplantation of hematopoietic stem cells from healthy donors can cure patients with many diseases. Donor T cells can protect against recurrence of infection and disease, but some of these (alloreactive) T cells recognize patient tissues as foreign, causing graft-versus-host disease.

Inactivation of alloreactive T cells by inducing <e>tolerance</e> to patient cells (anergization) before transplantation preserves beneficial donor T cell effects while reducing graft-versus-host disease. We show that this approach also results in expansion of regulatory T cells that specifically suppress alloreactive donor T cell responses in the recipient.

Tfh cells are regulated by a unique molecular programme orchestrated by the transcriptional repressor Bcl6. This transcription factor turns down expression of multiple genes, including transcriptional regulators of other T helper lineages and a vast amount of microRNAs. This enables Tfh cells to express a suite of chemokine receptors, stimulatory ligands and cytokines that enable migration into B-cell follicles, and provision of effective help to B cells. Not surprisingly, dysregulation of this powerful helper subset can lead to a range of autoantibody-mediated diseases; indeed, aberrant accumulation of Tfh cells has been linked with systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's disease and autoimmune arthritis. Here we dissect multiple checkpoints that operate throughout Tfh cell development and maturation to maintain immunological <e>tolerance</e> while mounting robust and long-lasting antibody responses.",M2
20363971,"Differential but direct abolishment of human regulatory T cell suppressive capacity by various TLR2 ligands.CD4(+)CD25(high) regulatory T cells (Tregs) control cellular immune responses and maintain peripheral <e>tolerance</e>. We investigated whether TLR2 ligands are able to abrogate Treg-induced suppression in humans based on different reports about effects of triacylated lipopeptide Pam(3)CSK4 in mice. Pretreatment of human Tregs with a mixture of TLR2 ligands Pam(2)CSK4, FSL-1, and Pam(3)CSK4 reduced the Treg-mediated suppression of CD4(+)CD25(-) responder T cells in the majority of the analyzed donors. Differential effects of individual TLR2 ligands are explained by usage of different TLR2 heterodimers in the recognition of Pam(2)CSK4, FSL-1, and Pam(3)CSK4. In contrast to the murine system, TLR2 ligand-mediated abrogation of human Treg function was not associated with a downregulation of FoxP3 transcription factor. Furthermore, our results excluded an effect of TLR2 ligands on granzyme A/B release by human Tregs as a potential mechanism to abolish Treg-mediated suppression. Our data suggest that a downregulation of p27(Kip1) and restoration of Akt phosphorylation in human Tregs pretreated with TLR2 ligands result in a reversal of suppression on responder T cells. Moreover, our data indicate that a mixture of TLR2 ligands can be used to modulate human Treg activity.",M2
20358704,"Biochemical markers of possible immunodepression in military training in harsh environments.Prolonged, exhaustive exercise frequently leads to an increased incidence of upper respiratory tract illness (URTI) which is linked to transient immunodepression. We investigated potential biochemical markers of stress and fatigue, and URTI symptoms as a surrogate of immunodepression, in US Marines undergoing intensive winter training at altitude. Selected plasma amino acids and leptin (p[Lep]) were measured as possible markers of fatigue and immunodepression, together with nonesterified fatty acids (p[NEFA]) and total antioxidant capacity (p[TAC]). Changes were observed in plasma free tryptophan (p[FT]), p[Gln], p[Lep], p[NEFA], p[TAC] but not branched chain amino acids (p[BCAA]). p[FT] decreased markedly. Resting p[Gln] decreased overall after one month at altitude. p[Gln] routinely decreases 1-2 hrs after prolonged exercise. Importantly, we observed early morning decreases in p[Gln], suggesting a cumulative effect of prolonged activity, stress, and fatigue. Concomitantly, individuals with highest illness scores had the greatest p[Gln] decrease: low p[Gln] may therefore be associated with a diminished stress <e>tolerance</e>.",M2
20355360,"Specific oral <e>tolerance</e> induction for food. A systematic review.BACKGROUND: Specific oral tolerance induction (SOTI) is a new therapeutic approach in the treatment of persistent food allergy. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this article is to systematically review the literature in order to identify, appraise, and synthesize the evidence about SOTI efficacy and safety. METHODS: A comprehensive search for citations was conducted on May 2, 2009 using MEDLINE via PubMed. Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including subjects of any age were considered. All these studies were assessed, discussed in details and evaluatedfor quality by authors in a standardized independent way. RESULTS: 15 clinical trials were found. Of these, six trials met the inclusion criteria: three were open label RCT, three were double blind placebo controlled RCT. Two were conducted using sublingual immunotherapy, four using oral desensitization. Overall, the methodological quality of the studies was sufficient. The mean Jadad score of the studies was 3.33 (range = 2-5). Main characteristics and results of the studies were showed and discussed. CONCLUSIONS: SOTI seems to be a possible approach to accelerate the development of tolerance in children affected by food allergy. However, other studies are needed to clarify which is the best treatment and protocol to follow in order to reduce the adverse events and to increase the percentage of success, before thinking that SOTI might be part of the clinical practice.",M2
20349420,"Transplant <e>tolerance</e>: progress and challenges.Organ transplantation has proven to be an effective therapeutic for a wide variety of disease states, but the chronic immunosuppression required for allograft survival increases the risk for infection and neoplasia. In the past 50 years, a wealth of experimental data has been accumulated relating to strategies to preserve function and prolong graft survival. These strategies operate by inducing peripheral or central tolerance to the allograft, with protocols based on regulatory T cell (Treg) induction as the most promising ones. However, as these protocols move into the clinic, there is recognition that little is known as to their efficacy when confronted with the human immune system: preexisting memory T cells and  heterologous immunity  in antigen-experienced humans but not in immunologically na√Øve rodents, infections and early activation of innate immune response and the related inflammation-induced cytokine milieu that inhibit Treg activity while augmenting the T effector response, all pose significant barriers to tolerance induction. A better understanding of the cellular and molecular mechanisms by which memory T cells and innate immunity modulate transplant tolerance and detailed immunologic studies of the rare  spontaneously tolerant  patients may lead to development of combined strategies that target and modulate the immune system at multiple levels.",M2
20347158,"Immune regulation of conception and embryo implantation-all about quality control?Medawar's hypotheses for explaining maternal immune <e>tolerance</e> of the semi-allogeneic fetus are now proven incorrect or insufficient. The mother's immune response is not passive, suppressed, indolent or physically constrained in pregnancy. Instead, her immune system is centrally engaged with all steps of the reproductive process from conception to embryo implantation and placental development. Emerging studies show that immune cells are positioned and equipped to sense antigens and other signals originating in seminal fluid, the embryo and placental trophoblast. The immune response appears competent to utilise this information to discriminate the reproductive fitness and compatibility of the male partner and the integrity and developmental competence of the conceptus tissue. Since the immune response is modulated by the individual's infectious, inflammatory, stress, nutritional and metabolic status, immune influence on progression or disruption of pregnancy may be further influenced by environmental stressors and resource availability. This opinion paper advances the view that the immune system operates in pregnancy to integrate these signals and to exert executive quality control to either accommodate or reject the conceptus. It is argued that 'immune-mediated quality control' would facilitate optimal female reproductive investment and maximise offspring fitness, and thereby explain the evolutionary advantage of maternal immune awareness of the conceptus tissue.",M2
20345983,"<e>Tolerance</e> induction after specific immunotherapy with pollen allergoids adjuvanted by monophosphoryl lipid A in children.Specific immunotherapy (SIT) is a well-established and clinically effective treatment for allergic diseases. A pollen allergoid formulated with the T helper type 1 (Th1)-inducing adjuvant monophosphoryl lipid A (MPL) facilitates short-term SIT. Little is known about mechanisms of tolerance induction in this setting. In a prospective study, 34 patients allergic to grass pollen (25 male, nine female, median age 10.2 years) received a total of 44 SIT courses (20 in the first, 24 in the second) with MPL-adjuvanted pollen allergoids. Immunogenicity was measured by levels of specific immunoglobulin G (IgG(grass)) and IgG4(grass) by antibody blocking properties on basophil activation, and by induction of CD4(+), CD25(+) and forkhead box P3 (FoxP3(+)) regulatory T cells (T(reg)). Specific IgG and IgG4 levels increased only slightly in the first year of SIT. In the second year these changes reached significance (P &lt; 0.0001). In keeping with these findings, we were able to show an increase of T(reg) cells and a decreased release of leukotrienes after the second year of treatment. In the first year of treatment we found little evidence for immunological changes. A significant antibody induction was seen only after the second course of SIT. Short-course immunotherapy with pollen allergoids formulated with the Th1-inducing adjuvant MPL needs at least two courses to establish tolerance.",M2
20339029,"Induction of lymphoidlike stroma and immune escape by tumors that express the chemokine CCL21.Tumor manipulation of host immunity is important for tumor survival and invasion. Many cancers secrete CCL21, a chemoattractant for various leukocytes and lymphoid tissue inducer cells, which drive lymphoid neogenesis. CCL21 expression by melanoma tumors in mice was associated with an immunotolerant microenvironment, which included the induction of lymphoid-like reticular stromal networks, an altered cytokine milieu, and the recruitment of regulatory leukocyte populations. In contrast, CCL21-deficient tumors induced antigen-specific immunity. CCL21-mediated immune <e>tolerance</e> was dependent on host rather than tumor expression of the CCL21 receptor, CCR7, and could protect distant, coimplanted CCL21-deficient tumors and even nonsyngeneic allografts from rejection. We suggest that by altering the tumor microenvironment, CCL21-secreting tumors shift the host immune response from immunogenic to tolerogenic, which facilitates tumor progression.",M2
20334928,"T cell <e>tolerance</e> towards the fetal allograft.The conceptus is considered a semi-allograft because of the presence of paternal HLA-C molecules. These alloantigens can be processed by maternal antigen presenting cells, which present them to specific maternal CD4+ T cells. After activation, the maternal CD4+ T cells can become effector decidual CD4+ T cells, which are able to release various cytokines. Th1-type cytokines (IFNgamma) that promote allograft rejection may compromise pregnancy, whereas the Th2-type cytokines (IL-4, IL-10) that inhibit Th1 responses, promote allograft tolerance and therefore may improve fetal survival. A collaborative interaction between the decidual natural regulatory T cells, CD4+ CD25+ Foxp3 T cells and NKT cells in preventing fetal allograft rejection is suggested.",M2
20333625,"Efficient and versatile manipulation of the peripheral CD4+ T-cell compartment by antigen targeting to DNGR-1/CLEC9A.DC NK lectin group receptor-1 (DNGR-1, also known as CLEC9A) is a C-type lectin receptor expressed by mouse CD8alpha+ DC and by their putative equivalents in human. DNGR-1 senses necrosis and regulates CD8+ T-cell cross-priming to dead-cell-associated antigens. In addition, DNGR-1 is a target for selective in vivo delivery of antigens to DC and the induction of CD8+ T-cell and Ab responses. In this study, we evaluated whether DNGR-1 targeting can be additionally used to manipulate antigen-specific CD8+ T lymphocytes. Injection of small amounts of antigen-coupled anti-DNGR-1 mAb into mice promoted MHC class II antigen presentation selectively by CD8alpha+ DC. In the steady state, this was sufficient to induce proliferation of antigen-specific na√Øve CD4+ T cells and to drive their differentiation into Foxp3+ regulatory lymphocytes. Co-administration of adjuvants prevented this induction of <e>tolerance</e> and promoted immunity. Notably, distinct adjuvants allowed qualitative modulation of CD4+ T-cell behavior: poly I:C induced a strong IL-12-independent Th1 response, whereas curdlan led to the priming of Th17 cells. Thus, antigen targeting to DNGR-1 is a versatile approach for inducing functionally distinct CD4+ T-cell responses. Given the restricted pattern of expression of DNGR-1 across species, this strategy could prove useful for developing immunotherapy protocols in humans.",M2
20332447,"Immune rejection in a humanized model of murine prostate cancer.Background/Aim: We attempted to develop a humanized mouse model for prostate cancer to study immune recognition and responses to human prostate-tumor antigens in mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Our study was based on cell lines derived from transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) tumors. TRAMP cells were modified to express a chimeric MHC I molecule comprising the extracellular domains of human HLA-A2.1 with the transmembrane and intracellular domain of K(b). RESULTS: These modified TRAMP cells were immunologically rejected following recognition of human tumor epitopes known to be immunodominant in the context of HLA-A2.1. Immune-compromised SCID-beige mice did not reject these tumors. CONCLUSION: We conclude that epitopes derived from endogenous murine homologs were being presented by the chimeric MHC class I molecules due to a lack of central <e>tolerance</e> to these epitopes in the mice.",M2
20308365,"Lymph node-resident lymphatic endothelial cells mediate peripheral <e>tolerance</e> via Aire-independent direct antigen presentation.Peripheral immune tolerance is generally thought to result from cross-presentation of tissue-derived proteins by quiescent tissue-resident dendritic cells to self-reactive T cells that have escaped thymic negative selection, leading to anergy or deletion. Recently, we and others have implicated the lymph node (LN) stroma in mediating CD8 T cell peripheral tolerance. We demonstrate that LN-resident lymphatic endothelial cells express multiple peripheral tissue antigens (PTAs) independent of the autoimmune regulator (Aire). They directly present an epitope derived from one of these, the melanocyte-specific protein tyrosinase, to tyrosinase-specific CD8 T cells, leading to their deletion. We also show that other LN stromal subpopulations express distinct PTAs by mechanisms that vary in their Aire dependence. These results establish lymphatic endothelial cells, and potentially other LN-resident cells, as systemic mediators of peripheral immune tolerance.",M2
20308362,"Lymph node fibroblastic reticular cells directly present peripheral tissue antigen under steady-state and inflammatory conditions.Lymph node stromal cells (LNSCs) can induce potent, antigen-specific T cell <e>tolerance</e> under steady-state conditions. Although expression of various peripheral tissue-restricted antigens (PTAs) and presentation to naive CD8+ T cells has been demonstrated, the stromal subsets responsible have not been identified. We report that fibroblastic reticular cells (FRCs), which reside in the T cell zone of the LN, ectopically express and directly present a model PTA to naive T cells, inducing their proliferation. However, we found that no single LNSC subset was responsible for PTA expression; rather, each subset had its own characteristic antigen display. Studies to date have concentrated on PTA presentation under steady-state conditions; however, because LNs are frequently inflammatory sites, we assessed whether inflammation altered stromal cell-T cell interactions. Strikingly, FRCs showed reduced stimulation of T cells after Toll-like receptor 3 ligation. We also characterize an LNSC subset expressing the highest levels of autoimmune regulator, which responds potently to bystander inflammation by up-regulating PTA expression. Collectively, these data show that diverse stromal cell types have evolved to constitutively express PTAs, and that exposure to viral products alters the interaction between T cells and LNSCs.",M2
20232291,"Forkhead box p3+ regulatory T cell underlies male resistance to experimental type 2 autoimmune hepatitis.Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH), like many autoimmune diseases, is most prevalent in young women. The immunological basis of this age and sex susceptibility bias was investigated in a murine model of AIH. Xenoimmunization of 7-week-old female C57BL/6 mice resulted in more severe AIH with higher levels of liver inflammation, serum alanine aminotransferase, specific T-cell cytotoxicity, and autoantibody than younger and older females. Vaccinated males developed minimal liver inflammation and higher percentages of CD4(+)CD25(+)FoxP3(+) regulatory T cell in peripheral blood mononuclear cells, spleen, and liver than females. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) were virtually absent in liver-lymphocytes infiltrates of females. Castration of C57BL/6 mice, with or without 17beta-estradiol supplementation, did not modify susceptibility in males, nor Treg numbers, suggesting minimal contribution of testosterone and estradiol to autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) susceptibility. Xenoimmunized Aire(+/0) mouse displayed similar AIH susceptibility, sex bias, and Tregs numbers as C57BL/6 mice, suggesting that susceptibility in females is not the result of less stringent thymic central <e>tolerance</e>. Autoreactive B cell response against formiminotransferase-cyclodeaminase correlated with disease activity, possibly linking B-cell autoreactivity and AIH pathogenesis. CONCLUSION: Peripheral tolerance and development of regulatory T cells after self-mimicking antigen exposure, and not sexual hormone nor central tolerance, are the main factors for susceptibility to AIH in females.",M2
20231687,"Peripheral B cell <e>tolerance</e> and function in transgenic mice expressing an IgD superantigen.Transitional B cells turn over rapidly in vivo and are sensitive to apoptosis upon BCR ligation in vitro. However, little direct evidence addresses their tolerance sensitivity in vivo. A key marker used to distinguish these cells is IgD, which, through alternative RNA splicing of H chain transcripts, begins to be coexpressed with IgM at this stage. IgD is also expressed at high levels on naive follicular (B-2) and at lower levels on marginal zone and B-1 B cells. In this study, mice were generated to ubiquitously express a membrane-bound IgD-superantigen. These mice supported virtually no B-2 development, a greatly reduced marginal zone B cell population, but a relatively normal B-1 compartment. B cell development in the spleen abruptly halted at the transitional B cell population 1 to 2 stage, a block that could not be rescued by either Bcl-2 or BAFF overexpression. The developmentally arrested B cells appeared less mature and turned over more rapidly than nontransgenic T2 cells, exhibiting neither conventional features of anergy nor appreciable receptor editing. Paradoxically, type-2 T-independent responses were more robust in the transgenic mice, although T-dependent responses were reduced and had skewed IgL and IgH isotype usages. Nevertheless, an augmented memory response to secondary challenge was evident. The transgenic mice also had increased serum IgM, but diminished IgG, levels mirrored by the increased numbers of IgM(+) plasma cells. This model should facilitate studies of peripheral B cell tolerance, with the advantages of allowing analysis of polyclonal populations, and of B cells naturally lacking IgD.",M2

20227765,"Human chorionic gonadotropin: a hormone with immunological and angiogenic properties.The success of implantation depends on a receptive endometrium, a normal blastocyst and synchronized cross-talk at the maternal-fetal interface. The progression of pregnancy then requires immunological <e>tolerance</e> which allows conceptus survival. A cascade of cytokines mediates this dialogue and is crucial in the cross-talk between the immune and endocrine systems. The first known human embryo-derived signal is chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) by which the embryo profoundly influences immunological tolerance and angiogenesis at the maternal-fetal interface. hCG levels coincide with the development of trophoblast tolerance. Indeed, it increases the number of uterine natural killer cells that play a key role in the establishment of pregnancy. hCG also intervenes in the development of local immune tolerance through the cellular system of apoptosis via Fas/Fas-Ligand. It modulates the Th1/Th2 balance and acts on complement C3 and C4A/B factors modulating decidual immunity. The transient tolerance evident during gestation is at least partially achieved via the presence of regulatory T cells which are attracted by hCG at the fetal-maternal interface. Finally, hCG treatment of activated dendritic cells results in an up-regulation of MHC class II, IL-10 and IDO expression, reducing the ability to stimulate T cell proliferation. Successful implantation requires an extensive endometrial angiogenesis in the implantation site. Recent data demonstrate angiogenic effects of hCG via its interaction with endometrial and endothelial LH/hCG receptors. Our review focuses on these functions of hCG, giving new insight into the endocrine-immune dialogue that exists between the conceptus and immune cells within the receptive endometrium at the time of implantation.",M2

20226691,"Control of intestinal homeostasis, colitis, and colitis-associated colorectal cancer by the inflammatory caspases.Inflammatory caspases are essential effectors of inflammation and cell death. Here, we investigated their roles in colitis and colorectal cancer and report a bimodal regulation of intestinal homeostasis, inflammation and tumorigenesis by caspases-1 and -12. Casp1(-/-) mice exhibited defects in mucosal tissue repair and succumbed rapidly after dextran sulfate sodium administration. This phenotype was rescued by administration of exogenous interleukin-18 and was partially reproduced in mice deficient in the inflammasome adaptor ASC. Casp12(-/-) mice, in which the inflammasome is derepressed, were resistant to acute colitis and showed signs of enhanced repair. Together with their increased inflammatory response, the enhanced repair response of Casp12(-/-) mice rendered them more susceptible to colorectal cancer induced by azoxymethane (AOM)+DSS.

20217563,"Preventing immune rejection through gene silencing.Dendritic cells (DCs) comprise a family of professional antigen-presenting cells responsible for the induction of primary immune responses.

RelB, one of the five families of Rel proteins involved in the NF-kappaB pathway, plays a critical role in coordinating the terminal stages of DC maturation and has the ability to induce optimal Th1 T cell responses. DCs generated from mouse bone marrow can be silenced using siRNA specific for the target gene. Silencing RelB in DCs will result in the generation of immunoregulatory dendritic cells that inhibit allogenic T cell responses. The KLH-specific T cell response should also be inhibited after the RelB siRNA treatment. Furthermore, silencing the RelB gene in DCs can generate regulatory T cells. Administering donor-derived RelB-silencing DCs can prevent allograft rejection in murine heart transplantation.",M2

Thromboembolic and necroinflammatory events occurring in the liver early after portal vein islet transplantation are thought to reduce the total islet mass by up to 75%.

20217518,"Customized cell-based treatment options to combat autoimmunity and restore beta-cell function in type 1 diabetes mellitus: current protocols and future perspectives.Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1D) is considered a classical autoimmune disease which commonly starts during childhood but may appear later in adulthood in a proportion of 30-40% of affected individuals. Its development is based on a combination of a genetic predisposition and autoimmune processes that result in gradual destruction of the beta-cells of the pancreas and cause absolute insulin deficiency. Evidence for an autoimmune origin of T1D results from measurable islet beta-cell autoantibody directed against various autoantigens such as proinsulin or insulin itself, glutamic acid decarboxylase 65, the islet tyrosine phosphatase IA-2, and the islet-specific glucose-6-phosphatase catalytic subunit-related protein. In addition, T-cell lines with specificity for insulin or glutamic acid decarboxylase have been identified within peripheral blood lymphocytes. Importantly, in most instances the pathogenesis of T1D comprises a slowly progressive destruction of beta-cell tissue in the pancreas preceded by several years of a prediabetic phase where autoimmunity has already developed but with no clinically apparent insulin dependency. Unless immunological <e>tolerance</e> to pancreatic autoantigens is re-established, diabetes treated by islet cell transplantation or stimulation/regeneration of endogenous beta-cells would remain a chronic disease secondary to immune suppression related morbidity. Hence, if islet cell tolerance could be re-induced, a major clinical hurdle to curing diabetes by islet cell neogenesis may be overcome. Targeted immunotherapies are currently explored in a variety of clinical studies and hold great promise for causative treatment to readjust the underlying immunologic imbalance with the goal to cure the disease. This chapter will outline possible treatment options to stop or reverse the beta-cell-specific autoimmune and inflammatory process within pancreatic islets. Special emphasis is given to stem cells of embryonic, mesenchymal, and haematopoietic origin, which, besides their use for regenerative purposes, possess potent immunomodulatory functions and thus have the potential to suppress the autoimmune response. At the end of this chapter we will introduce a novel type of in vitro modified monocytes with immunosuppressive and anti-inflammatory properties. These tolerogenic monocytes provide a feasible option to be used as autologous cellular transplants to halt autoimmunity and to protect still viable beta-cells within Langerhans islets.",M2
20212092,"Dynamic regulation of CD8 T cell <e>tolerance</e> induction by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.Cross-presentation of soluble Ag on MHC class I molecules to naive CD8 T cells by liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs) leads to induction of T cell tolerance that requires interaction between coinhibitory B7-H1 on LSECs and programmed cell death-1 on CD8 T cells. In this study, we investigate whether cross-presentation of high as well as low Ag concentrations allowed for LSEC-induced tolerance. Ag concentration directly correlated with the cross-presentation capacity of murine LSECs and thus strength of TCR stimulation. Although LSEC cross-presentation at low-Ag concentrations resulted in tolerance, they induced differentiation into effector T cells (CTL) at high-Ag concentrations. CTL differentiation under these conditions was not caused by increased expression of costimulatory CD80/86 on cross-presenting LSECs but was determined by early IL-2 release from naive CD8 T cells. B7-H1 signals from LSECs and TCR avidity reciprocally controlled early T cell release of IL-2 and CTL differentiation. B7-H1 expression directly correlated with cross-presentation at low- but not high-Ag concentrations, indicating an imbalance between TCR and coinhibitory signals regulating T cell release of IL-2. Exogenous IL-2 overrode coinhibitory B7-H1-mediated signals by LSECs and induced full CTL differentiation. Our results imply that LSEC-mediated T cell tolerance can be broken in situations where T cells bearing high-avidity TCR encounter LSECs cross-presenting high numbers of cognate MHC class I peptide molecules, such as during viral infection of the liver. Furthermore, we attribute a novel costimulatory function to IL-2 acting in a T cell autonomous fashion to promote local induction of immunity in the liver even in the absence of CD80/86 costimulation.",M2

20207438,"Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) levels in the natural history of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-infection: a European perspective.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: The quantifiable level of HBsAg has been suggested as a predictor of treatment response in chronic hepatitis B. However, there is limited information on HBsAg levels considering the dynamic natural course of HBV-infection. This study aimed to determine HBsAg levels in the different phases of HBV-infection in European HBsAg-positive patients. METHODS: 226 HBV-monoinfected patients, not undergoing antiviral therapy, were analyzed in a cross-sectional study. Patients were categorized according to the phase of HBV-infection: HBeAg(+) immune <e>tolerance</e> phase (IT, n=30), immune clearance phase (IC, n=48), HBeAg(-) low-replicative phase (LR, n=68), HBeAg(-) hepatitis (ENH, n=68), and acute hepatitis B (n=12). HBsAg was quantified and correlated with HBV-DNA, HBV-genotypes and clinical parameters. In addition, 30 LR-patients were followed longitudinally. RESULTS: HBsAg levels were higher in IT-patients and IC-patients compared to LR-patients and ENH-patients (4.96/4.37/3.09/3.87-log(10)IU/ml, p&lt;0.001). HBsAg showed a strong correlation with HBV-DNA during acute hepatitis B (R=0.79, p&lt;0.01). Correlation of HBsAg and HBV-DNA was weak or missing when analyzing different phases of persistent HBV-infection separately. However, associations between HBsAg and HBV-DNA were observed in patients infected with HBV-genotype D but not with HBV-genotype A. LR-patients with HBV-reactivation during follow-up (increase of HBV-DNA &gt;2000IU/ml) showed &gt;3-fold higher baseline HBsAg levels with a NPV of 95% for an HBsAg cut-off of 3500IU/ml. CONCLUSIONS: HBsAg levels show significant differences during the natural course of HBV-infection and between HBV-genotypes. These findings may have important implications for understanding the natural history of HBV-infection and for using quantitative HBsAg as a diagnostic tool, i.e. as a marker for predicting HBV-reactivation.",M2

In this mini-review, recent data on the structure of human NK cell receptor repertoires and its relation to functional responses and <e>tolerance</e> to self are discussed.

20201984,"T-cell receptor revision: friend or foe?T-cell receptor (TCR) revision is a process of <e>tolerance</e> induction by which peripheral T cells lose surface expression of an autoreactive TCR, reinduce expression of the recombinase machinery, rearrange genes encoding extrathymically generated TCRs for antigen, and express these new receptors on the cell surface. We discuss the evidence for this controversial tolerance mechanism below. Despite the apparent heresy of post-thymic gene rearrangement, we argue here that TCR revision follows the rules obeyed by maturing thymocytes undergoing gene recombination. Expression of the recombinase is carefully controlled both spatially and temporally, and may be initiated by loss of signals through surface TCRs. The resulting TCR repertoire is characterized by its diversity, self major histocompatibility complex restriction, self tolerance, and ability to mount productive immune responses specific for foreign antigens. Hence, TCR revision is a carefully regulated process of tolerance induction that can contribute to the protection of the individual against invading pathogens while preserving the integrity of self tissue.",M2
20200274,"CD22 x Siglec-G double-deficient mice have massively increased B1 cell numbers and develop systemic autoimmunity.CD22 and Siglec-G are inhibitory coreceptors for BCR-mediated signaling. Although CD22-deficient mice show increased calcium signaling in their conventional B2 cells and a quite normal B cell maturation, Siglec-G-deficient mice have increased calcium mobilization just in B1 cells and show a large expansion of the B1 cell population. Neither CD22-deficient, nor Siglec-G-deficient mice on a pure C57BL/6 or BALB/c background, respectively, develop autoimmunity. Using Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice, we addressed whether Siglec-G and CD22 have redundant functions. Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice show elevated calcium responses in both B1 cells and B2 cells, increased serum IgM levels and an enlarged population of B1 cells. The enlargement of B1 cell numbers is even higher than in Siglecg(-/-) mice. This expansion seems to happen at the expense of B2 cells, which are reduced in absolute cell numbers, but show an activated phenotype. Furthermore, Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice show a diminished immune response to both thymus-dependent and thymus-independent type II Ags. In contrast, B cells from Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice exhibit a hyperproliferative response to stimulation with several TLR ligands. Aged Siglec-G x CD22 double-deficient mice spontaneously develop anti-DNA and antinuclear autoantibodies. These resulted in a moderate form of immune complex glomerulonephritis. These results show that Siglec-G and CD22 have partly compensatory functions and together are crucial in maintaining the B cell <e>tolerance</e>.",M2
20199505,"Evolving paradigms that determine the fate of an allograft.Despite the many advances in both immunological knowledge and the practical application of clinical immunosuppression, the holy grail of indefinite graft survival with immune <e>tolerance</e> in clinical solid organ transplantation remains a distant dream. The tremendous progress made in understanding the molecular and cellular basis of allograft rejection has not been translated into durable modalities that have advanced clinical care and outcomes. Indeed, currently used drugs and treatment protocols, largely directed at inhibiting alloreactive T cells, have not optimally improved allograft survival or function. A shift in emphasis, focusing on under appreciated immune pathways must now be considered to make further improvement. We highlight three areas of recent interest, complement, NK cells and lymphatics, which reinforce the concept that the transplant community must direct attention on how the immune system as a whole responds to a transplant. The current challenge is to integrate molecular, cellular and anatomic concepts to achieve the equivalent of a unified field theory of the immune response to organ transplants.",M2
20176266,"Allergen immunotherapy.Specific immunotherapy (SIT) involves the administration of allergen extracts to achieve clinical <e>tolerance</e> of those allergens that cause symptoms in patients with allergic conditions. Immunotherapy is effective in patients with mild forms of allergic disease and also in those who do not respond well to standard drug therapy. Most SIT is given by means of injection, but there is increasing interest in performing SIT through the sublingual route. SIT remains the treatment of choice for patients with systemic allergic reactions to wasp and bee stings and should be considered as an option in patients with allergic rhinitis, asthma, or both. SIT can modify the course of allergic disease by reducing the risk of new allergic sensitizations and inhibiting the development of clinical asthma in children treated for allergic rhinitis. The precise mechanisms responsible for the beneficial effects of SIT remain a matter of research and debate. An effect on regulatory T cells seems most probable and is associated with switching of allergen-specific B cells toward IgG4 production. Few direct comparisons of SIT and drug therapy have been made. Existing data suggest that the effects of SIT take longer to develop, but once established, SIT achieves long-lasting relief of allergic symptoms, whereas the benefits of drugs only last as long as they are continued.",M2
20176262,"Mucosal immunology, eosinophilic esophagitis, and other intestinal inflammatory diseases.The gastrointestinal mucosa constitutes the largest host-environment interface of the body. It uses both innate and adaptive immune mechanisms to provide protection from the diverse onslaught of foods, microbes, and other ingested products. The innate immune system is genetically encoded and evolutionarily ancient, possesses no memory, and lacks diversity. In contrast, the adaptive immune system is quite diverse, develops memory, and undergoes expansion after stimulation. The gastrointestinal mucosa is charged with the difficult task of mounting protective responses against invading microorganisms while simultaneously maintaining an overall state of nonresponsiveness or <e>tolerance</e> to innocuous substances, such as commensal bacteria and food antigens. Perturbation or malfunction of these complex protective mechanisms results in diseases, such as inflammatory bowel diseases, celiac disease, or eosinophilic gastrointestinal diseases.",M2
20193026,"Dendritic cell physiology and function in the eye.The eye and the brain are immunologically privileged sites, a property previously attributed to the lack of a lymphatic circulation. However, recent tracking studies confirm that these organs have good communication through classical site-specific lymph nodes, as well as direct connection through the blood circulation with the spleen. In addition, like all tissues, they contain resident myeloid cell populations that play important roles in tissue homeostasis and the response to foreign antigens. Most of the macrophage and dendritic cell (DC) populations in the eye are restricted to the supporting connective tissues, including the cornea, while the neural tissue (the retina) contains almost no DCs, occasional macrophages (perivascularly distributed), and a specialized myeloid cell type, the microglial cell. Resident microglial cells are normally programmed for immunological <e>tolerance</e>. The privileged status of the eye, however, is relative, as it is susceptible to immune-mediated inflammatory disease, both infectious and autoimmune. Intraocular inflammation (uveitis and uveoretinitis) and corneal graft rejection constitute two of the more common inflammatory conditions affecting the eye leading to considerable morbidity (blindness). As corneal graft rejection occurs almost exclusively by indirect allorecognition, host DCs play a major role in this process and are likely to be modified in their behavior by the ocular microenvironment. Ocular surface disease, including allergy and atopy, also comprise a significant group of immune-mediated eye disorders in which DCs participate, while infectious disease such as herpes simplex keratitis is thought to be initiated via corneal DCs. Intriguingly, some more common conditions previously thought to be degenerative (e.g. age-related macular degeneration) may have an autoimmune component in which ocular DCs and macrophages are critically involved. Recently, the possibility of harnessing the tolerizing potential of DCs has been applied to experimental models of autoimmune uveoretinitis with good effect. This approach has considerable potential for use in translational clinical therapy to prevent sight-threatening disease caused by ocular inflammation.",M2
20193020,"Harnessing human dendritic cell subsets for medicine.Immunity results from a complex interplay between the antigen-non-specific innate immune system and the antigen-specific adaptive immune system. The cells and molecules of the innate system employ non-clonal recognition receptors including lectins, Toll-like receptors, NOD-like receptors, and helicases. B and T lymphocytes of the adaptive immune system employ clonal receptors recognizing antigens or their derived peptides in a highly specific manner. An essential link between innate and adaptive immunity is provided by dendritic cells (DCs). DCs can induce such contrasting states as immunity and <e>tolerance</e>. The recent years have brought a wealth of information on the biology of DCs revealing the complexity of this cell system. Indeed, DC plasticity and subsets are prominent determinants of the type and quality of elicited immune responses.

20193017,"Unraveling the functions of plasmacytoid dendritic cells during viral infections, autoimmunity, and <e>tolerance</e>.Plasmacytoid dendritic cells (pDCs) are bone marrow-derived cells that secrete large amounts of type I interferon (IFN) in response to viruses. Type I IFNs are pleiotropic cytokines with antiviral activity that also enhance innate and adaptive immune responses. Viruses trigger activation of pDCs and type I IFN responses mainly through the Toll-like receptor pathway. However, a variety of activating and inhibitory pDC receptors fine tune the amplitude of type I IFN responses. Chronic activation and secretion of type I IFN in the absence of infection can promote autoimmune diseases. Furthermore, while activated pDCs promote immunity and autoimmunity, resting or alternatively activated pDCs may be tolerogenic. The various roles of pDCs have been extensively studied in vitro and in vivo with depleting antibodies. However, depleting antibodies cross-react with other cell types that are critical for eliciting protective immunity, potentially yielding ambiguous phenotypes. Here we discuss new approaches to assess pDC functions in vivo and provide preliminary data on their potential roles during viral infections. Such approaches would also prove useful in the more specific evaluation of how pDCs mediate tolerance and autoimmunity. Finally, we discuss the emergent role of pDCs and one of their receptors, tetherin, in human immunodeficiency virus pathogenesis.",M2
20193016,"Langerhans cells and more: langerin-expressing dendritic cell subsets in the skin.Langerhans cells (LCs) are antigen-presenting dendritic cells (DCs) that reside in epithelia. The best studied example is the LC of the epidermis. By electron microscopy, their identifying feature is the unique rod- or tennis racket-shaped Birbeck granule. The phenotypic hallmark is their expression of the C-type lectin receptor langerin/CD207. Langerin, however, is also expressed on a recently discovered population of DC in the dermis and other tissues of the body. These 'dermal langerin(+) dendritic cells' are unrelated to LCs. The complex field of langerin-negative dermal DCs is not dealt with here. In this article, we briefly review the history, ontogeny, and homeostasis of LCs. More emphasis is laid on the discussion of functional properties in vivo. Novel models using genetically engineered mice are contributing tremendously to our understanding of the role of LCs in eliciting adaptive immune responses against pathogens or tumors and in inducing and maintaining <e>tolerance</e> against self antigens and innocuous substances in vivo. Also, innate effector functions are increasingly being recognized.

20193009,"The CD8+ dendritic cell subset.Mouse lymphoid tissues contain a subset of dendritic cells (DCs) expressing CD8 alpha together with a pattern of other surface molecules that distinguishes them from other DCs. These molecules include particular Toll-like receptor and C-type lectin pattern recognition receptors. A similar DC subset, although lacking CD8 expression, exists in humans. The mouse CD8(+) DCs are non-migrating resident DCs derived from a precursor, distinct from monocytes, that continuously seeds the lymphoid organs from bone marrow. They differ in several key functions from their CD8(-) DC neighbors. They efficiently cross-present exogenous cell-bound and soluble antigens on major histocompatibility complex class I. On activation, they are major producers of interleukin-12 and stimulate inflammatory responses. In steady state, they have immune regulatory properties and help maintain <e>tolerance</e> to self-tissues. During infection with intracellular pathogens, they become major presenters of pathogen antigens, promoting CD8(+) T-cell responses to the invading pathogens. Targeting vaccine antigens to the CD8(+) DCs has proved an effective way to induce cytotoxic T lymphocytes and antibody responses.",M2

In the establishment of T-cell central tolerance, the alternative pathway appears to be the key signaling component in thymic stromal cells for their development and function, while the canonical pathway exerts its function more in autonomous T-cell selection. This review intends to summarize the current understanding of the role of NF-kappaB in establishing T-cell central tolerance and highlight unsolved intriguing questions for future work.",M2

20181891,"TNF activates a NF-kappaB-regulated cellular program in human CD45RA- regulatory T cells that modulates their suppressive function.Emerging data suggest that regulatory T cell (Treg) dysfunction and consequent breakdown of immunological self-<e>tolerance</e> in autoimmunity can be mediated by factors that are not Treg-intrinsic (e.g., cytokines). Indeed, recent studies show that in rheumatoid arthritis the proinflammatory cytokine TNF reduces the suppressive function of Tregs, whereas in vivo TNF blockade restores this function and accordingly self-tolerance. However, until now a coherent mechanism by which TNF regulates the Treg has not been described. In this paper, we show that TNF induces preferential and significant activation of the canonical NF-kappaB pathway in human Tregs as compared with CD25(-) conventional T cells. Furthermore, TNF induced primarily in CD45RA(-) Tregs a transcription program highly enriched for typical NF-kappaB target genes, such as the cytokines lymphotoxin-alpha and TNF, the TNFR superfamily members FAS, 4-1BB, and OX-40, various antiapoptotic genes, and other important immune-response genes. FACS analysis revealed that TNF also induced upregulation of cell surface expression of 4-1BB and OX40 specifically in CD45RA(-)FOXP3(+) Tregs. In contrast, TNF had only a minimal effect on the Treg's core transcriptional signature or on the intracellular levels of the FOXP3 protein in Tregs. Importantly, TNF treatment modulated the capacity of Tregs to suppress the proliferation and IFN-gamma secretion by conventional T cells, an effect that was fully reversed by cotreatment with anti-TNFR2 mAbs. Our findings thus provide new mechanistic insight into the role of TNF and TNFR2 in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity.",M2
20181860,"Early embryonic blood cells collect antigens and induce immunotolerance in the hatched chicken.Earlier experimental data in our laboratory showed that introduction of an exogenous protein into early chicken embryonic blood leads to immunotolerance of hatched chicken to that protein. However, the underlying mechanism is yet unknown. In the present study, we show that the blood cells collecting circulating antigen might contribute to the establishment of immunotolerance. In this experiment, most of the chicken embryo blood cells took up injected fluorescein isothiocyanate-BSA at approximately embryonic d 3. At the same stage, 1 microL of embryo blood was taken out and incubated with BSA. After being loaded with BSA in vitro and washed, these cells were injected back into the original embryo. The BSA-specific lymphocytes were depleted in chickens whose early embryo cells had been loaded with BSA, as evidenced by a significant decrease in anti-BSA antibody after challenge with BSA when the chickens were 3 wk old. In addition, by direct injection of BSA to embryonic d 3 embryo blood, the hatched chickens had decreased amounts of anti-trinitrophenol antibody after the chickens were challenged with trinitrophenol-BSA, indicating that the helper function of BSA-specific T cells was impaired. In conclusion, these observations suggest that some early embryo blood cells possibly collect and store antigen for the establishment of self-<e>tolerance</e> before the maturation of B and T cells.",M2
20180832,"Antigen-dependent immunotherapy of non-obese diabetic mice with immature dendritic cells.Immunotherapy can be used to induce immunological <e>tolerance</e> by a number of different protocols. During the last decade the ability to use tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs) to prevent autoimmunity has received much attention. Many studies have attempted to use immature or semi-mature DCs to induce tolerance in the non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model of human type 1 diabetes. However, most studies to date have used protocols in which generation of DCs involved a culture step in fetal bovine serum (FBS)-supplemented medium which may affect tolerance induction in a non-specific fashion. Indeed, several studies have shown that DCs cultured in the presence of FBS will induce a powerful T helper type 2 (Th2) immune response towards FBS-related antigens which can suppress an ongoing immune response. Hence, this may interfere with diabetes development in the NOD mouse by induction of immune deviation rather than by antigen-specific tolerance. In order to test whether antigen-specific tolerance induction by DC therapy is feasible in the NOD mouse, we therefore generated immature DCs using autologous serum [normal mouse serum (NMS)-supplemented cultures] instead of FBS, and we show that these DCs can protect NOD mice from diabetes, if pulsed with insulin-peptide antigens before adoptive transfer. Our data therefore support that DC therapy is able to prevent diabetes in the NOD mouse in an antigen-specific manner.",M2
20176801,"Lymphoma endothelium preferentially expresses Tim-3 and facilitates the progression of lymphoma by mediating immune evasion.Angiogenesis is increasingly recognized as an important prognosticator associated with the progression of lymphoma and as an attractive target for novel modalities. We report a previously unrecognized mechanism by which lymphoma endothelium facilitates the growth and dissemination of lymphoma by interacting with circulated T cells and suppresses the activation of CD4(+) T cells. Global gene expression profiles of microdissected endothelium from lymphoma and reactive lymph nodes revealed that T cell immunoglobulin and mucin domain-containing molecule 3 (Tim-3) was preferentially expressed in lymphoma-derived endothelial cells (ECs). Clinically, the level of Tim-3 in B cell lymphoma endothelium was closely correlated to both dissemination and poor prognosis. In vitro, Tim-3(+) ECs modulated T cell response to lymphoma surrogate antigens by suppressing activation of CD4(+) T lymphocytes through the activation of the interleukin-6-STAT3 pathway, inhibiting Th1 polarization, and providing protective immunity. In a lymphoma mouse model, Tim-3-expressing ECs promoted the onset, growth, and dissemination of lymphoma by inhibiting activation of CD4(+) T cells and Th1 polarization. Our findings strongly argue that the lymphoma endothelium is not only a vessel system but also a functional barrier facilitating the establishment of lymphoma immune <e>tolerance</e>.

Sublingual administration in ovalbumin-sensitized mice of L. helveticus, but not L. casei, reduced airways hyperresponsiveness, bronchial inflammation and proliferation of specific T cells in cervical lymph nodes.

20172383,"Effect of oral <e>tolerance</e> in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis.OBJECTIVE: Induction of oral tolerance (OT) is known to prevent allergic inflammation in models of asthma. This study investigated the preventive effect of OT and airway remodeling in a mouse model of allergic rhinitis (AR). STUDY DESIGN: An in vivo study using an animal model. SETTING: Catholic Research Institutes of Medical Science. METHODS: Forty six-week-old, female BALB/c mice were divided into four groups: control, AR, low-dose OT, and high-dose OT. To induce OT, mice were fed ovalbumin (OVA) before sensitization with OVA/aluminum hydroxide, 1 mg for six days in the low-dose OT group and a 25 mg single dose in the high-dose OT group. Mice in the AR group were fed phosphate-buffered saline. After sensitization followed by challenges with OVA during six weeks, nasal behaviors, interleukin (IL)-13 and interferon gamma (IFN-gamma) levels in nasal lavage (NAL) fluids, as well as OVA-specific IgE levels in serum, were measured. The degree of goblet cell hyperplasia and thickness of lamina propria were observed in nasal tissues by periodic acid-Schiff and Masson's trichrome stain. A P value &lt; 0.05 was accepted as statistically significant. RESULTS: Both OT groups showed a significant decrease in inflammatory cells, IL-13 and IFN-gamma in NAL fluids, as well as OVA-specific IgE levels in serum compared with the AR group. In addition, the degree of goblet cell hyperplasia and thickness of lamina propria were attenuated in both OT groups compared with the AR group. Further, these alterations did not differ significantly between the two OT groups. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that OT may effectively reduce allergic inflammation as well as airway remodeling in a mouse model of AR.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective, experimental, comparative, longitudinal study included 4 experimental groups, each comprising 4 dogs. Group 1 (control group) underwent renal transplantation only; group 2 underwent renal transplantation and splenectomy; group 3 underwent renal transplantation and splenosis; and group 4 underwent renal transplantation, splenectomy, and splenosis. Survival and degree of rejection were compared between the 4 groups. RESULTS: Splenosis improved renal function after transplantation, as indicated by increased serum creatinine concentration (group 3, 6.2 mg/dL vs group 1, 12.9 mg/dL). Comparison of weighted survival curves (corrected for degree of rejection) demonstrated a significant difference between group 2 (66.0 days) and group 4 (66.2 days) vs group 1 (52.7 days) and group 3 (41.2 days) (P = .05, Wilcoxon rank sum test).

20164832,"Regulatory T cells in many flavors control asthma.That regulatory T cells (Tregs) have a crucial role in controlling allergic diseases such as asthma is now undisputed. The cytokines most commonly implicated in Treg-mediated suppression of allergic asthma are transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) and interleukin (IL)-10). In addition to naturally occurring Tregs, adaptive Tregs, induced in response to foreign antigens, have been shown in recent studies. The concept of inducible/adaptive Tregs (iTregs) has considerable significance in preventing asthma if generated early enough in life. This is because cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-6 inhibit Foxp3 induction in naive CD4+ T cells and therefore de novo generation of Tregs can be expected to be less efficient when it is concomitant with effector cell development in response to an allergen. However, if iTregs can be induced, the process of infectious <e>tolerance</e> would facilitate expansion of the iTreg pool as suggested in the recent literature. It is tempting to speculate that there is a window of opportunity in early life in the context of a relatively immature immune system that is permissive for the generation of iTregs specific to a spectrum of allergens that would regulate asthma for lifelong. The focus of this review is the relevance of nTregs and iTregs in controlling asthma from early life into adulthood, the mechanisms underlying Treg function, and the prospects for using our current concepts to harness the full potential of Tregs to limit disease development and progression.",M2

We investigated the effect of rapamycin administration to SJL/j mice affected by PLP(139-151)-induced relapsing-remitting experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (RR-EAE). We found that oral or intraperitoneal treatment at the peak of disease or at the end of the first clinical attack, dramatically ameliorated the clinical course of RR-EAE. Treatment suspension resulted in early reappearance of disease. Clinical response was associated with reduced central nervous system demyelination and axonal loss. Rapamycin induced suppression of IFN-gamma, and IL-17 release from antigen-specific T cells in peripheral lymphoid organs. While CD4(+)FoxP3(+) cells were unaffected, we observed disappearance of CD4(+)CD45RB(high) effector T (T(eff)) cells and selective expansion of T(reg) cells bearing the CD4(+)CD45RB(low)FoxP3(+)CD25(+)CD103(+) extended phenotype. Finally, the dual action of rapamycin on both T(eff) and T(reg) cells resulted in modulation of their ratio that closely paralleled disease course. Our data show that rapamycin inhibits RR-EAE, provide evidence for the immunological mechanisms, and indicate this compound as a potential candidate for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.",M2
20105659,"Neonatal <e>tolerance</e> under breastfeeding influence: the presence of allergen and transforming growth factor-beta in breast milk protects the progeny from allergic asthma.Once the umbilical cord has been cut, immunologists have often looked at the neonate as an entity that develops on its own. For years, breast milk was considered mainly as a source of nutrients for the developing child. The extensive observations that breastfeeding affords protection toward infectious diseases and could reduce by more than the half the mortality rate because of common infections have added another key role to breastfeeding. This protection relies in great part on the passive transfer through breast milk of high amounts of microbe-specific immunoglobulins that compensate for the deficiency of immunoglobulins synthesis during the first year of life. Here, we will present and discuss our data showing how breast milk can actively shape the immune response of the progeny, particularly in the context of allergic disease. Indeed, our data obtained in a mouse model suggest that the protection attributed to breastfeeding toward asthma development might rely on immune tolerance induction. For this to occur, the mother mice needed to be exposed to the allergen by aerosol or oral route during the lactation period, which resulted into the transfer of the allergen to breast milk. The presence of the allergen together with transforming growth factor-beta in breast milk was necessary and sufficient to induce the development of regulatory T lymphocytes in the progeny and their protection from asthma development. If confirmed in human beings, this study may suggest new strategies for asthma prevention such as deliberate exposure of mother to allergens during breastfeeding and qualitative modification of artificial milks.",M2
20148423,"Blockade of GITR-GITRL interaction maintains Treg function to prolong allograft survival.Involvement of Treg in transplant <e>tolerance</e> has been demonstrated in multiple models. During the active process of graft rejection, these regulatory cells are themselves regulated and inactivated, a process termed counter-regulation. We hypothesize that ligation of the costimulatory molecule glucocorticoid-induced TNF receptor-related protein (GITR) on Treg inhibits their ability to promote graft survival, and by blocking GITR ligation graft survival can be prolonged. To this aim, we have designed a soluble GITR fusion protein (GITR-Fc), which binds GITR ligand and inhibits activation of GITR. Here, we show that GITR-Fc prolonged mouse skin graft survival, and this prolongation is dependent on Treg. In a full MHC-mismatched skin graft setting, GITR-Fc significantly improved graft survival when used in combination with MR1, anti-CD40L, while GITR-Fc alone did not demonstrate graft prolongation. These results demonstrate that disruption of binding of GITR with GITR ligand may be an important strategy in prolonging allograft survival.",M2
20146708,"Innate pathways to B-cell activation and <e>tolerance</e>.B cells represent an important link between the adaptive and innate immune systems as they express both antigen-specific B-cell receptors (BCRs) as well as various Toll-like receptors (TLRs). Several checkpoints in B-cell development ensure that self-specific cells are eliminated from the mature B-cell repertoire to avoid harmful autoreactive responses. These checkpoints are controlled by BCR-mediated events but are also influenced by TLR-dependent signals from the innate immune system. Additionally, B-cell-intrinsic and extrinsic TLR signaling are critical for inflammatory events required for the clearance of microbial infections. Factors secreted by TLR-activated macrophages or dendritic cells directly influence the fate of protective and autoreactive B cells. Additionally, naive and memory B cells respond differentially to TLR ligands, as do different B-cell subsets. We review here recent literature describing intrinsic and extrinsic effects of TLR stimulation on the fate of B cells, with particular attention to autoimmune diseases.",M2
20142365,"In vivo imaging of an inducible oncogenic tumor antigen visualizes tumor progression and predicts CTL <e>tolerance</e>.Visualizing oncogene/tumor Ag expression by noninvasive imaging is of great interest for understanding processes of tumor development and therapy. We established transgenic (Tg) mice conditionally expressing a fusion protein of the SV40 large T Ag and luciferase (TagLuc) that allows monitoring of oncogene/tumor Ag expression by bioluminescent imaging upon Cre recombinase-mediated activation. Independent of Cre-mediated recombination, the TagLuc gene was expressed at low levels in different tissues, probably due to the leakiness of the stop cassette. The level of spontaneous TagLuc expression, detected by bioluminescent imaging, varied between the different Tg lines, depended on the nature of the Tg expression cassette, and correlated with Tag-specific CTL tolerance. Following liver-specific Cre-loxP site-mediated excision of the stop cassette that separated the promoter from the TagLuc fusion gene, hepatocellular carcinoma development was visualized. The ubiquitous low level TagLuc expression caused the failure of transferred effector T cells to reject Tag-expressing tumors rather than causing graft-versus-host disease. This model may be useful to study different levels of tolerance, monitor tumor development at an early stage, and rapidly visualize the efficacy of therapeutic intervention versus potential side effects of low-level Ag expression in normal tissues.",M2
20142362,"ADP-ribosylation controls the outcome of <e>tolerance</e> or enhanced priming following mucosal immunization.Accumulating evidence suggests that the dichotomy between tolerance and active IgA immunity in mucosal immune responses is regulated at the APC level. Therefore, immunomodulation of the APC could be an effective mechanism to control the two response patterns. In this study, we demonstrate that ADP-ribosylation controls the outcome of tolerance or active effector T cell immunity to an internal peptide p323-339 from OVA inserted into the cholera toxin (CT)-derived CTA1-OVA-DD adjuvant. We found that a single point mutation, CTA1R7K-OVA-DD, resulting in lack of enzymatic activity, promoted peptide-specific tolerance in TCR transgenic CD4(+) T cells following a single intranasal (i.n.) treatment. The CTA1R7K-OVA-DD-induced tolerance was strong, long-lasting, and impaired the ability of adoptively transferred naive peptide-specific CD4(+) T cells to respond to Ag-challenge, irrespective if this was given i.p or i.n. The tolerance correlated with induction of regulatory T cells of the regulatory T type 1 characterized by CD25(-)Foxp3(-)CD4(+) T cells producing IL-10. In contrast, in IL-10-deficient mice, no peptide-specific tolerance was observed, and these mice exhibited unimpaired CD4(+) T cell responsiveness to recall Ag irrespective of if they were untreated (PBS) or treated i.n. with CTA1R7K-OVA-DD. Thus, for the first time, we can provide unequivocal proof that ADP-ribosylation can control the outcome of mucosal Ag exposure from tolerance to an enhanced effector CD4(+) T cell response. The exploitation of this system for clinical treatment of autoimmune diseases is discussed.",M2

The route of tacrolimus administration was transferred from vein to gut tract gradually, the tacrolimus trough levels were aimed at 10-15 microg/L within the first 3 postoperative months, 5-10 microg/L at 4-6 months post-operation and taped to 5 microg/L thereafter. RESULTS: Two of these 4 cases survived more than one year. The follow-ups of other 2 patients were 6 and 2 months respectively. Three episodes of IND to mild acute rejection verified by pathology through routine ileoscopical biopsy were found at 1-3 months post-operation, anther 3 episodes of IND to mild acute rejection verified during at 4-6 months post-operation and one episode of moderate acute rejection found at 7-12 months post-operation.

CONCLUSIONS: The partial tolerance steroid-free protocol of combining Campath 1H induction with a low-dose monotherapy of tacrolimus can effectively control the graft rejection in small bowel transplantation. And the grafted intestine regains an excellent function.",M2
20136690,"Neonatal programming by neuroimmune challenge: effects on responses and <e>tolerance</e> to septic doses of lipopolysaccharide in adult male and female rats.A mild immune challenge experienced during the neonatal period leads to attenuated febrile responses to a similar challenge experienced later in life. However, the immune response to an endotoxin differs depending upon the severity of the challenge and it is not clear whether a neonatal immune challenge will also affect responses to a severe, potentially life-threatening stimulus, such as sepsis. In the present study, we examined the effects of a neonatal immune challenge with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) on adult sickness responses, as well as the development of endotoxin tolerance, to a septic dose (1 or 3 mg/kg) of the same LPS in male and female rats. We demonstrate significant differences, particularly in males, in the fever profiles of neonatally LPS-treated rats compared to neonatally saline-treated controls. Specifically, male rats treated neonatally with LPS have reduced hypothermic and enhanced hyperthermic responses to both septic doses of LPS in adulthood. A somewhat different profile is seen in females, with neonatally LPS-treated females having reduced hypothermia and enhanced hyperthermia compared to controls with 1 mg/kg but no differences with 3 mg/kg LPS. The results obtained demonstrate that alterations in innate immune responses previously reported for low doses of LPS can, for the most part, also be observed after severe immune challenge in later life.",M2
20134192,"Keeping the balance between immune <e>tolerance</e> and pathogen immunity with endogenous neuropeptides.Identification of the factors that regulate the immune tolerance and control the appearance of exacerbated inflammatory conditions is crucial for the development of new therapies of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. Although much is known about the molecular basis of initiating signals and pro-inflammatory chemical mediators in inflammation, it has only recently become apparent that endogenous stop signals are critical at early checkpoints within the temporal events of inflammation. Some neuropeptides and hormones that are produced during the ongoing inflammatory response have emerged as endogenous anti-inflammatory agents that participate in the regulation of the processes that ensure self-tolerance and/or inflammation resolution. We will examine the latest research findings, which indicate that neuropeptides participate in maintaining immune tolerance in two distinct ways: by regulating the balance between pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory factors, and by inducing the emergence of regulatory T cells with suppressive activity against autoreactive T cell effectors. We will also examine the role of some of these neuropeptides as mediators of innate defense acting as natural antimicrobial peptides. Both anti-inflammatory and pro-resolving neuropeptides have shown therapeutic potential for a variety of inflammatory and autoimmune disorders and could be used as biotemplates for the development of novel pharmacologic agents. From a physiological point of view, neuropeptides play a critical role in the innate-adaptive immune cross talk that allows survival.",M2
20134191,"Tolerogenic dendritic cells in the control of autoimmune neuroinflammation: an emerging role of protein-glycan interactions.During the past decade, a great deal of information has contributed to our understanding of the immunosuppressive pathways that operate during the resolution of autoimmune pathology, including central nervous system (CNS) inflammation. Activation of these pathways is accomplished through the integration of an intricate network of inhibitory signals and immune suppressive cells, including regulatory T cells, myeloid-derived suppressor cells, 'alternatively activated' macrophages and tolerogenic dendritic cells (DCs). During the course of inflammatory diseases, immature or mature DCs may be licensed by different stimuli (e.g. cytokines, neuropeptides and growth factors) to become tolerogenic and suppress pathogenic T cell responses, thus emphasizing the outstanding plasticity of these cells. Recent findings have shed light to an immunoregulatory circuit by which galectin-1, an endogenous glycan-binding protein, favors the differentiation of regulatory DCs which promote T cell <e>tolerance</e> and contribute to resolution of autoimmune pathology through mechanisms involving IL-27 and IL-10. Together with the ability of galectin-1-glycan interactions to selectively blunt T helper (Th)1 and Th17 responses, this effect provides a rational explanation for the broad immunosuppressive effects of this glycan-binding protein in several experimental models of chronic inflammation and cancer. In this mini review, we will summarize the regulatory signals leading to the differentiation of tolerogenic DCs and their participation in CNS inflammation. In addition, we will underscore recent findings on the emerging role of galectin-glycan interactions in the establishment of immunosuppressive networks during the resolution of chronic inflammation.",M2
20128035,"Inhibition of allogeneic T-cell response by Kupffer cells expressing indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase.AIM: To explore the possibility and mechanism of inhibiting allogeneic T-cell responses by Kupffer cells (KC) pretreated with interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) in vitro. METHODS: The expressions of indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO) mRNA and FasL mRNA in KC pretreated with IFN-gamma were studied with real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The catabolism of tryptophan by IDO from KC was analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography. Allogeneic T-cell response was used to confirm the inhibition of KC in vitro. The proliferation of lymphocytes was detected using [(3)H] thymidine incorporation. Cell cycle and lymphocyte apoptosis were evaluated by flow cytometric assay. RESULTS: Real-time PCR revealed IDO mRNA and FasL mRNA expressions in KC pretreated with IFN-gamma, and IDO catabolic effect was confirmed by a decrease in tryptophan and increase in kynurenine concentration. KC expressing IDO and FasL in BABL/c mice acquired the ability to suppress the proliferation of T-cells from C57BL/6, which could be blocked by addition of 1-methyl-tryptophan and anti-FasL antibody. KC expressing IDO could induce allogeneic T-cell apoptosis. CONCLUSION: In addition to Fas/FasL pathway, IDO may be another mechanism for KC to induce immune <e>tolerance</e>.",M2
20113370,"PD-1 signalling in CD4(+) T cells restrains their clonal expansion to an immunogenic stimulus, but is not critically required for peptide-induced <e>tolerance</e>.The ultimate outcome of T-cell recognition of peptide-major histocompatibility complex (MHC) complexes is determined by the molecular context in which antigen presentation is provided. The paradigm is that, after exposure to peptides presented by steady-state dendritic cells (DCs), inhibitory signals dominate, leading to the deletion and/or functional inactivation of antigen-reactive T cells. This has been utilized in a variety of models providing peptide antigen in soluble form in the absence of adjuvant. A co-inhibitory molecule of considerable current interest is PD-1. Here we show that there is the opportunity for the PD-1/PD-L1 interaction to function in inhibiting the T-cell response during tolerance induction. Using traceable CD4(+) T-cell receptor (TCR) transgenic cells, together with a blocking antibody to disrupt PD-1 signalling, we explored the roles of PD-1 in the induction of tolerance versus a productive immune response. Intact PD-1 signalling played a role in limiting the extent of CD4(+) T-cell accumulation in response to an immunogenic stimulus. However, PD-1 signalling was not required for either the induction, or the maintenance, of peptide-induced tolerance; a conclusion underlined by successful tolerance induction in TCR transgenic cells genetically deficient for PD-1. These observations contrast with the reported requirement for PD-1 signals in CD8(+) T-cell tolerance.",M2
20109746,"Allergy or <e>tolerance</e> in children sensitized to peanut: prevalence and differentiation using component-resolved diagnostics.BACKGROUND: Not all peanut-sensitized children develop allergic reactions on exposure. OBJECTIVE: To establish by oral food challenge the proportion of children with clinical peanut allergy among those considered peanut-sensitized by using skin prick tests and/or IgE measurement, and to investigate whether component-resolved diagnostics using microarray could differentiate peanut allergy from tolerance. METHODS: Within a population-based birth cohort, we ascertained peanut sensitization by skin tests and IgE measurement at age 8 years. Among sensitized children, we determined peanut allergy versus tolerance by oral food challenges. We used open challenge among children consuming peanuts (n = 45); others underwent double-blind placebo-controlled challenge (n = 34). We compared sensitization profiles between children with peanut allergy and peanut-tolerant children by using a microarray with 12 pure components (major peanut and potentially cross-reactive components, including grass allergens). RESULTS: Of 933 children, 110 (11.8%) were peanut-sensitized. Nineteen were not challenged (17 no consent). Twelve with a convincing history of reactions on exposure, IgE &gt; or =15 kUa/L and/or skin test &gt; or =8mm were considered allergic without challenge. Of the remaining 79 children who underwent challenge, 7 had &gt; or =2 objective signs and were designated as having peanut allergy. We estimated the prevalence of clinical peanut allergy among sensitized subjects as 22.4% (95% CI, 14.8% to 32.3%). By using component-resolved diagnostics, we detected marked differences in the pattern of component recognition between children with peanut allergy (n = 29; group enriched with 12 children with allergy) and peanut-tolerant children (n = 52). The peanut component Ara h 2 was the most important predictor of clinical allergy. CONCLUSION: The majority of children considered peanut-sensitized on the basis of standard tests do not have peanut allergy. Component-resolved diagnostics may facilitate the diagnosis of peanut allergy.",M2
20109136,"Circumventing immune <e>tolerance</e> through epigenetic modification.In recent decades our understanding of immune cell activation and homeostasis has significantly expanded. Such progress helped to better define the cellular, molecular, and epigenetic networks involved in the immune response in the tumor microenvironment and renewed the enthusiasm towards the potential power of cancer immunotherapy. However, successful translation of novel mechanistic discoveries into effective immunotherapy was hindered by a number of obstacles, among them the ability of tumors to tolerize host lymphocytes rendering them functionally incompetent and the tumor's ability to evade antigen-specific immune recognition through a variety of genetic, epigenetic, and stromal factors. These immunosuppressive strategies have, thus far, blunted our efforts to effectively unleash anti-cancer immunity. Fortunately, the wealth of new information regarding the interactions between tumors and the immune system and the regulation of certain highly antigenic tumor proteins has led to novel approaches with the potential to render cancer cells helpless towards immune attack. Here we summarize recent findings on cancer-induced T-lymphocyte tolerance and discuss a novel  vaccinate-induce  strategy conceived to counteract these effects at an epigenetic level.",M2
20109021,"Third International Conference on Cancer Vaccines/Adjuvants/Delivery for the Next Decade (CVADD 2009).The Third International Conference on Cancer Vaccines/Adjuvants/Delivery for the Next Decade (CVADD), chaired by Malcolm S Mitchell, was hosted in Dublin, Ireland, on 11-13 November 2009. The conference was intended to aid the translation of basic research into clinical progress and to bridge the gap between academia and industrial innovation. In total, 44 speakers gave presentations on preclinical and clinical vaccine development, mostly focusing on cancer vaccination. The present report does not represent a comprehensive review of all topics covered, but highlights selected points of particular novelty and interest. Within the field of cancer vaccines, the considerable discrepancy between high immune response rates and limited clinical effects has led to increased focus on how vaccines may best be applied to maximize their clinical impact. This challenge emerged at the forefront of the conference, reflected by fruitful discussions on adjuvants, delivery systems, strategies for countering tumor <e>tolerance</e> and on combination with conventional therapy. The studies presented at CVADD 2009 support the argument for combining active immunization with agents countering tumor tolerance and with conventional cancer treatment, while also pointing to a need for improved knowledge on how to develop these multimodal regimes.",M2
20126379,"Regulatory T cells and human myeloid dendritic cells promote <e>tolerance</e> via programmed death ligand-1.Immunotherapy using regulatory T cells (Treg) has been proposed, yet cellular and molecular mechanisms of human Tregs remain incompletely characterized. Here, we demonstrate that human Tregs promote the generation of myeloid dendritic cells (DC) with reduced capacity to stimulate effector T cell responses. In a model of xenogeneic graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), allogeneic human DC conditioned with Tregs suppressed human T cell activation and completely abrogated posttransplant lethality. Tregs induced programmed death ligand-1 (PD-L1) expression on Treg-conditioned DC; subsequently, Treg-conditioned DC induced PD-L1 expression in vivo on effector T cells. PD-L1 blockade reversed Treg-conditioned DC function in vitro and in vivo, thereby demonstrating that human Tregs can promote immune suppression via DC modulation through PD-L1 up-regulation. This identification of a human Treg downstream cellular effector (DC) and molecular mechanism (PD-L1) will facilitate the rational design of clinical trials to modulate alloreactivity.",M2
20120086,"[HLA-G: from feto-maternal <e>tolerance</e> to organ grafting]E.D. Carosella was the pioneer who demonstrated the protective role of the HLA-G molecule on trophoblasts, which form a shield protecting the fetus from the immune reaction of its mother and subsequent reject. This non-classical HLA class I molecule is first expressed on the fertilized ovocyte, thus enabling a uterine implantation and then on the surface of the placenta trophoblast where the classical class I and II antigens are absent. He brought the first demonstration ex vivo of the protector role of HLA-G molecule present on the surface of fetal cytotrophoblast cells versus the lysis carried out by maternal decidual uterine NK cells, in both semi-allogenic combinations (maternal uterine NK cells and their own fetal cytotropohoblast counterparts) and allogenic combinations (different maternal uterine NK cells and cytotrophoblasts from different fetuses). The blockage of this protein triggers off an important cytotoxicity towards the fetal cells. Furthermore, he showed that HLA-G molecules act as an inhibitor of the T-lymphocytes, NK cells and antigen presenting cells (APC). Through his discovery Carosella also shows for the first time the three major clinical consequences: I) HLA-G molecules are crucial, as an altered expression of these molecules would lead to abortion and failed pregnancies, i.e. recurrent spontaneous abortions and preeclamptic disease. The embryo expression of soluble HLA-G molecules is a mandatory prerequisite to implantation. II) In allogenic transplantation (heart, kidney and liver-kidney graft) the expression of HLA-G protein significantly reduces acute rejection and showed an absence of chronic rejections. III) Finally, this expression on the malignant cells has a negative functional impact in the anti-tumour response. So the expression of HLA-G molecule constitutes an escape mechanism from immunosurveillance, just as the fetal cells protect themselves from the aggression of maternal immune cells.",M2
