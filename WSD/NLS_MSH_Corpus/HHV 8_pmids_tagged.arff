20462453,"Primary gamma-herpesviral infection in Zambian children.BACKGROUND: <e>HHV-8</e> is closely related to Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but the clinical presentations of these two infections in early childhood are not well understood. Also, it is not known whether infection by one virus correlates with another. Here, we compare the natural history of infection by these two viruses along with the clinical manifestations and risk factors that are associated with early childhood infection in Zambia, which is an endemic area for HHV-8. METHODS: This study was conducted in a cohort of 12 month old Zambian children (N = 677). Data on socio-economic status and a wide range of clinical manifestations were collected. Logistic regression was used to test for significant associations between the collected variables and HHV-8 or EBV serostatus at 12 months of age. RESULTS: We observed a significantly higher seroprevalence for EBV (58.9%) as compared to HHV-8 (13.4%). HIV-1 infected children had at a significantly higher risk of being infected with HHV-8 (Odds ratio [OR] 3.69, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.64 - 8.32). HIV-1 infection of the mothers was a significant risk factor for increased acquisition of EBV but not HHV-8 by children (OR 1.86, 05% CI 1.20 - 2.87). Self reported rash was marginally associated with primary infection for HHV-8 and EBV. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that there is no correlation between EBV and HHV-8 infections. Infection by one does not increase the susceptibility for the second virus. Primary HHV-8 and EBV infection in early childhood may clinically present as rash but remains largely asymptomatic and may remain undetected in this population. HIV infection in the mother or child are important risk factors that contribute to EBV or HHV-8 infection.",M1
20236530,"Human herpesvirus-8 in northwestern China: epidemiology and characterization among blood donors.BACKGROUND: Human herpes virus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is the etiologic agent associated with development of classical, AIDS-related, iatrogenic, and endemic Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Several studies provide strong evidence that HHV-8 can be transmitted by blood transfusion. We evaluated the seroprevalence and potential risk factors of HHV-8 infection in blood donors in one region. We surveyed HHV-8 infection among 4461 blood donors in Xinjiang, China, a unique endemic area for HHV-8 and KS. RESULTS: The HHV-8 seroprevalence was higher in local minority groups which comprise most KS cases in China, than in Han people. HHV-8 prevalence was 18.6% in the Han ethnic group, 25.9% in Uygur subjects, 29.2% in Kazak subjects, 36.8% in Mongolian subjects, and 21.9% in other ethnic groups. In several subgroups, the time of donation of whole blood seemed to be a risk factor. In HHV-8-seropositive subjects, a larger fraction of local minorities (23.9%) had high HHV-8 titers than that of Han subjects (9.2%). HHV-8 infection was associated with ethnicity and residence. CONCLUSION: HHV-8 seroprevalence was significantly high among blood donors in Xinjiang, where the prevalence of KS correlates with HHV-8 prevalence and titers in Uygur and Kazak ethnic groups. Blood exposure represented by the frequency of blood donation indicated a possible blood-borne transmission route of HHV-8 in Xinjiang. Detecting anti-HHV-8 antibodies before donation in this region is therefore important.",M1
20203226,"Human herpesvirus type 8 in patients with cirrhosis independent of thrombocytopenia.BACKGROUND: High seroprevalence of human herpesvirus type 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) in patients with cirrhosis has been reported to be associated with thrombocytopenia. Severe cirrhosis is always complicated with ascites. HHV-8 DNA levels in effusion from patients with primary effusion lymphoma has been reported to be significantly greater than in blood. The status of HHV-8 antibody and DNA in cirrhotic ascites is unclear. AIMS: To assess the status of HHV-8 antibody and DNA in cirrhotic ascites compared to that in cirrhotic plasma. METHODS: Plasma and ascites samples were collected from 85 patients with cirrhosis. HHV-8 antibody and DNA were detected by immunofluorescence assay and PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Male patients seropositive for HHV-8 antibody were significantly younger than seropositive female patients (p=0.0039). The seropositive rate in patients with cirrhosis was not associated with thrombocytopenia (p=0.6860). Both positive rate and titres of antibody in plasma were much greater than in ascites (p&lt;0.0001). More male or Child-Pugh class C than female or class B seropositive patients were positive for ascites. No hepatitis C virus-related ascites were positive for antibody. Neither plasma nor ascites samples from any subject were positive for HHV-8 DNA. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with cirrhosis, the seropositive rate for HHV-8 antibody is independent of thrombocytopenia. The positive rate for HHV-8 antibody in cirrhotic ascites seems to be associated with sex, disease severity and disease aetiology.",M1
20191196,"First survey for detecting the presence of human herpesvirus 8 infection (<e>HHV-8</e>) in Maputo, Mozambique.Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), is endemic in parts of the sub-Saharan, and KS has increased concomitantly with the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In Mozambique (MZ), no data concerning HHV-8 infection was available, thus the main of this work was to investigate, for the first time, the presence of HHV-8 infection in Maputo, MZ. Latent and lytic HHV-8-specific antibodies were assessed in blood samples from 189 individuals from the Central Hospital of Maputo, MZ, using 'in-house' immunofluorescence assays conducted in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. The results obtained were analyzed according to socio-demographic and clinical variables using the Chi-square test and logistic regression. An HHV-8 seropositivity of 1.8% and 9.7% was detected among 57 medical students and 31 individuals from the staff, respectively, in contrast to 16.4% detected among 67 out-patients. Concerning 34 hospitalized patients from the Dermatology Unit, 47.1% were HHV-8-seropositive overall, while the rate was 85.7% among KS patients. The present survey, conducted in Maputo, MZ, demonstrates great variation in HHV-8 infection frequencies depending on the group analyzed and epidemiological variables. An association between HHV-8 seropositivity and male gender (OR 5.72), the central origin of patients (OR 5.33), blood transfusions (OR 3.25), and KS (OR 24.0) was detected among hospitalized patients, and primary school (OR 7.18) and HIV-1 infection (OR 8.76) among out-patients.",M1

20088840,"Human herpesvirus 8 genomes and seroprevalence in United States blood donors.BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is a gamma-herpesvirus that causes Kaposi's sarcoma. The prevalence of HHV-8 genomes in US blood donors has not been systemically studied. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: A sensitive and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was used to detect HHV-8 DNA from purified CD19+ B lymphocytes from randomly selected US whole blood donors. Cellular target for the GAPDH gene was used to quantify cell-equivalent DNA. HHV-8 PCR was run in duplicate for each donor specimen along with an HHV-8 genomic copy standard. HHV-8 antibodies were detected by an indirect immunofluorescence assay. RESULTS: Specimens were obtained from 962 blood donors. DNA from more than 3 x 10(5) B-cell equivalents were obtained from 684 donors. No HHV-8 DNA was detected from any of the blood donor specimens. For the 684 donors, HHV-8 genomes were not detected in the DNA equivalent of 3 x 10(5) to 6 x 10(5) CD19+ B cells with real-time PCR, which has a detection limit of eight copies (95% confidence interval, 0-3/684). Negative results from the remaining 220 donors were potentially confounded by insufficient input DNA into the PCR procedures. Antibodies to HHV-8 were detected in 7.3% (70/962) of the donors. HHV-8 genomes were not detected from 40 of 70 HHV-8-seropositive donor B-cell DNA samples. CONCLUSION: The results indicate that the prevalence of detectable HHV-8 genomes in healthy blood donors is very low.",M1
20070998,"Orbital involvement in Castleman disease.Castleman disease is a quite uncommon lymphoproliferative disorder usually occurring in the lymph nodes. Rarely, Castleman disease develops in an extranodal anatomic location. We report on the first biopsy-proven case of multicentric plasma cell type of Castleman disease involving the orbital areas in a human herpes virus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>)-unassociated/ human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-seronegative 70-year-old man suffering from Parkinson disease. The diagnosis was established on the basis of morphologic, immunophenotypic, and molecular findings of a lymph node and orbital soft tissue biopsy. We additionally provide a review of all previously published cases of Castleman disease with an orbital involvement, discussing the distinctive characteristics and potential associations with regard to their counterparts at other sites. Although Castleman disease involving the orbit is an exceptionally rare occurrence that may present initially with ocular signs and symptoms, this should be included in the complete differential diagnosis of orbital mass lesion.",M1

20004457,"Induction of angiogenic chemokine CCL2 by human herpesvirus 8 chemokine receptor.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), an endothelial cell lesion believed to be initiated and driven primarily by cytokine dysregulation. Among the viral proteins suspected as contributing to viral pathogenesis is the lytically expressed viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR), which can induce various cellular cytokines. CC ligand-2 (CCL2/MCP-1) is a vGPCR-regulated angiogenic chemokine found at elevated levels in KS lesions and induced by HHV-8 infection of endothelial cells. Here we show that vGPCR induces CCL2 in endothelial cells via activation of C/EBPbeta and that vGPCR and C/EBPbeta are critical components of CCL2 induction by HHV-8 infection of endothelial cultures. To our knowledge, this is the first report of vGPCR-mediated cytokine induction, and its characterization, in the context of virus infection. Our results identify a mechanism by which vGPCR can contribute, in a host cell shutoff-independent manner, to viral pathogenesis.",M1
19997691,"Detection of human herpesvirus 8 in the skin of patients with pityriasis rosea.Pityriasis rosea is an acute self-limiting dermatosis with clinical and epidemiological features that suggest viral involvement. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between pityriasis rosea and human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>). Lesional skin tissue was obtained from 34 Kaposi's sarcoma-negative, immunocompetent patients with typical acute phase pityriasis rosea. Nested polymerase chain reaction with specific primer for HHV-8 DNA sequences was performed and all positive results were confirmed by sequencing. Seven out of 34 lesional skin specimens (20.5%) were found to be positive for the HHV-8 genome. All the positive samples were confirmed by DNA sequencing. We conclude that, in some cases, HHV-8 is implicated the pathogenesis of pityriasis rosea.",M1
19962570,"Is human herpesvirus-8 transmitted by transfusion?Studies of human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) transmission through transfusion have produced contradictory results. In North America-a region with a low prevalence of HHV-8 infection-3 studies that tested specimens from linked positive-donor/negative-recipient pairs collected before the introduction of white blood cell (WBC) reduction and the extension of red blood cell (RBC) storage found no case of transmission of HHV-8 to 151 transfusion recipients who were HHV-8-seronegative before the transfusion and received components from HHV-8-seropositive donors. In Uganda, a prospective cohort study of pediatric transfusion recipients observed a small (&lt;or=2.8%/U) increase in the risk of HHV-8 seroconversion over 6 months of follow-up among children who received HHV-8-seropositive (compared with seronegative) transfusion. This excess risk may be due either to the transfusion of non-WBC-reduced and fresh RBC units from donors experiencing a high incidence of HHV-8 primary infection or virus reactivation, or to the acquisition of HHV-8 from other background sources in such a high-prevalence geographic area. Although no adequate explanation exists for the difference, transmission routes of HHV-8 differ strikingly between high- and low-prevalence areas, so that findings of studies from Africa should not be generalized to the situation in North America. Even if fresh and non-WBC-reduced units collected from donors with unusually high viremia were capable of transmitting HHV-8 to transfusion recipients in the United States, such a transmission risk would represent a rare event that does not warrant implementation of safety measures specifically for its prevention.",M1
19900842,"Granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) in common variable immunodeficiency (CVID).Infectious complications of the lung occur quite frequently in patients with common variable immunodeficiency (CVID), a clinical syndrome that represents a primary immunodeficiency. However, there appears to be noninfectious pulmonary complications in association with CVID as well, and recently the term granulomatous-lymphocytic interstitial lung disease (GLILD) has been created to describe these noninfectious, diffuse lung disease complications that develop in CVID patients. They exhibit both granulomatous and lymphoproliferative histologic patterns, consisting of lymphocytic interstitial pneumonia (LIP), follicular bronchiolitis, and lymphoid hyperplasia. There are many unanswered questions surrounding this relatively unstudied entity. In an attempt to answer some of these questions, this review discusses in detail pathologic and clinical features of GLILD and its proposed pathogenesis with a particular attention to potential role of human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>). Lastly, therapeutic approach is discussed to generate novel treatment strategy to better care for a subgroup of CVID patients afflicted with this entity.",M1
19857312,"[Castleman's disease, a fatal cause of lymph node enlargement and fever]A 71-year old Turkish man with fever, night sweats and generalized lymphadenopathy was diagnosed as having multicentric Castleman's disease. This is a rare and often fatal cause of lymph node enlargement and fever. Histological investigation confirms the diagnosis, but the morphological features closely resemble reactive lymphadenopathy or lymphoma. Infection with human herpes virus 8 is associated with Castleman's disease, in both hiv-positive and hiv-negative patients. An interleukin-6 mediated immune response against <e>HHV-8</e> seems to play an important role in the pathogenesis of the multicentric form of Castleman's disease. The disease is usually rapidly progressive, but can have a milder course. There is no standard treatment: usually systemic chemotherapy in combination with steroids is applied..Recently, promising results have been obtained using rituximab and anti-IL-6-receptor antibodies.",M1
19852031,"Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors in childhood: a report from the Italian Cooperative Group studies.BACKGROUND: Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors (IMTs) are myofibroblastic lesions with unpredictable biologic behavior that occur at a young age. For this report, the authors investigated clinicopathologic features in a series of pediatric IMTs. The objective of the study was to identify morphologic or immunohistochemical prognostic markers and the possible pathogenic role of human herpes virus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>). METHODS: Twenty-six patients were observed over a period of 18 years. Clinical/histologic data were reviewed, and immunohistochemical/molecular studies were performed. RESULTS: Patients ages 8-216 months (median age, 60 months) presented with tumors of the lung-bronchus (8 patients), abdomen (17 patients), and thoracic wall (1 patient). Twenty-one patients underwent complete excision, and microscopic or macroscopic residual disease was present in 5 of those patients. Chemotherapy was received by 5 patients. After a median follow-up of 6.6 years, 24 patients were in complete remission, and 2 patients had died of disease. Local recurrences were observed in 6 patients (including 4 recurrences that occurred after a complete excision). Cytologic atypia, low inflammatory infiltrate, and a rich myxoid pattern were detected in patients who had recurrent disease or a poor prognosis. Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) was positive in 7 patients (including 2 patients with recurrent disease). No correlation between clusterin expression and prognosis was demonstrated. HHV-8 was identified in 1 pulmonary IMT. CONCLUSIONS: IMTs are locally aggressive lesions. In this series, the local recurrence rate was 23%, and the 5-year and 10-year event-free survival rates were 87.4% and 72.8%, respectively. The results indicated that the treatment of choice is a complete, nonmutilating excision; chemotherapy may be given to patients who have microscopic or macroscopic residual disease, although the results are controversial; cytologic atypia and positive ALK status are more frequent in aggressive tumors, whereas metastatic tumors are negative for ALK; and HHV8 is not involved in the pathogenesis of IMT.",M1
19793819,"Role of ORF74-encoded viral G protein-coupled receptor in human herpesvirus 8 lytic replication.The human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) viral G protein-coupled receptor (vGPCR) has been implicated in virus-associated disease pathogenesis due principally to its ability to induce the production of angiogenic cytokines involved in this process. However, the role of the vGPCR in normal virus biology is understudied and remains unknown. Here we provide evidence from vGPCR gene knockout and depletion experiments that vGPCR is a positive regulator of HHV-8 productive replication and, through experimental utilization of Galpha-coupling variants of vGPCR, that signaling via Galpha(q) activation and targeted mitogen-activated protein kinase pathways is of particular relevance to this activity.",M1

Approximately 62.5% of SCC and 80% of Rb showed positive staining for AChE. AChE staining in tumors was much higher than in normal control tissue. However, only 21.4% of SCC and 60% of Rb contained HHV-8 antigens. Of the 56 SCC, 17.9% were positive for both AChE and HHV-8 antigens, whereas 60% Rb were positive for both markers. The co-existence of AChE and HHV-8 antigens may play a role in the development of SCC and Rb. A possible mechanism for the development of these tumors is discussed.",M1
19777784,"Mother-to-child HIV and <e>HHV-8</e> transmission in neonates at Saint Camille Medical Centre in Burkina Faso.In Sub-Saharan Africa, many HIV infected people are co-infected with Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV-8). Therefore, the present study aimed to: (1) identify the pregnant women co-infected by HIV and HHV-8 at Saint Camille Medical Centre; (2) use three molecules (Zidovudine, Nevirapine and Lamivudine) to interrupt the vertical transmission of HIV and (3) use the PCR technique to diagnose children, who were infected by these viruses, in order to offer them an early medical assistance. A total of 107 pregnant women, aged from 19 to 42 years were diagnosed to be HIV positive at Saint Camille Centre; among them 13 were co-infected with HHV-8. All included women received the HAART. Two to six months after childbirth their babies underwent PCR diagnosis for HIV and HHV-8. The results revealed that, among these mothers, 68.2% were housewives, 34.6% were illiterates and 60.7% did not have university degree. The prevalence of HHV-8 among these pregnant women was 12.15% and the rate of vertical transmission of both HIV and HHV-8, was 0.0%. The issue of this study revealed that the antiretroviral therapy increased the mother CD4 T-cells, prevented the transcription of the mRNA of HHV-8 and blocked HIV vertical transmission.",M1
19774687,"Prevalence of persistent and latent viruses in untreated patients infected with HIV-1 from Ghana, West Africa.Only limited epidemiological data, pertaining to the prevalence of common persistent viruses has been reported in Ghana. This study was conducted to determine the prevalence of persistent viruses in individuals with untreated HIV-1 infection and uninfected blood donors. Paired plasma and cellular samples from HIV-negative blood donors, asymptomatic HIV and symptomatic/AIDS cohorts were screened by multiplex PCR then qPCR for parvovirus B19 (B19V), hepatitis B virus (HBV), GB virus-C (GBV-C), cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). IgG antibodies specific to each target virus were tested to determine exposure rates. No evidence of viraemia was found for B19V and VZV in any group. Prevalence of GBV-C plasma viraemia was significantly higher in asymptomatic and symptomatic HIV infection (16.7%) and (16.2%) than in blood donors (4%) P &lt; 0.005. Occult HBV infection was significantly more frequent in symptomatic HIV infection (10.9%) compared to asymptomatic HIV (3.6%) and blood donors (1.6%) P &lt; 0.005.

Here we investigated the role of HS during HHV-8 glycoproteins-induced cell fusion. Interestingly, the observed fusion demonstrated an unusual dependence on HS as evident from following lines of evidence: (1) a significant reduction in cell-to-cell fusion occurred when target cells were treated with heparinase; (2) in a competition assay, when the effector cells expressing HHV-8 glycoproteins were challenged with soluble HS, cell-to-cell fusion was reduced; and, (3) co-expression of HHV-8 glycoproteins gH-gL on target cells resulted in inhibition of cell surface HS expression. Taken together, our results indicate that cell surface HS can play an additional role during HHV-8 pathogenesis.",M1
19726225,"Evidence of inability of human cytomegalovirus to reactivate Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus from latency in body cavity-based lymphocytes.BACKGROUND: Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV; also known as human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>)) has been determined to be the most frequent cause of malignancies in AIDS patients. It is associated primarily with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and primary effusion lymphoma (PEL), as well as with multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD).(2) The switch from the latent to the lytic stage is important in the maintenance of malignancy and viral infection. So far, the mechanism of its reactivation has not been fully understood. OBJECTIVES: Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and KSHV might infect the same cells, and it was found by other groups that several viruses could reactivate KSHV from latency. We investigate whether HCMV infection could reactivate KSHV from latency in body cavity-based lymphocyte (BCBL-1) cells. STUDY DESIGN AND RESULTS: Laboratory strains of HCMV cannot infect B cells. In this article, we demonstrate that the UL131-repaired HCMV (vDW215-BADrUL131) derived from AD169 strain is able to infect B lymphocytes. We directly infected KSHV latent cells including BCBL-1 with vDW215-BADrUL131 to evaluate the ability of HCMV to reactivate KSHV. Inconsistent with previous reports in human fibroblast cells, our results provide direct evidence that HCMV is unable to reactivate KSHV from latency-to-lytic infection in BCBL-1 cell lines. As a control, herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) was shown to be able to reactivate KSHV. CONCLUSIONS: Our observations, different from others, suggest that reactivation mechanisms for KSHV might vary in different cells.",M1

A total of 288 IDUs were tested for K8.1 antibodies to HHV-8 lytic antigen. Associations between HHV-8 serostatus and potential risk factors were examined using univariate and multivariate logistic regression analysis. Seroprevalence of HHV-8 was 24.3% (95% CI 19.5-29.7), increasing with age from 19.4% in those aged &lt;30 years to 52.9% in those aged 40 years (P for trend=0.003). No statistically significant associations between HHV-8-positive status and gender, educational level, age at first drug injection, needle sharing, number of imprisonments, complications from drug overdose, HIV and HCV were observed. In the multivariate logistic regression analysis, older age (40 vs. &lt;40 years, OR 3.30, 95% CI 1.14-9.56) and report of septicaemia/abscess (yes vs. no, OR 1.80, 95% CI 1.01-3.18) were each independently associated with higher HHV-8 seroprevalence. HHV-8 is highly prevalent in the IDU population in Greece. The independent association between HHV-8 and reported abscess or septicaemia supports the hypothesis that poor hygiene conditions in the setting of drug injection may contribute to HHV-8 transmission.",M1
19620817,"[HIV- and <e>HHV-8</e>-negative primary effusion lymphoma-like lymphoma presenting with lymphomatous effusions complicated by cardiac tamponade-a case report]We report a rare case of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)- and human herpes virus-8 (HHV-8)-negative primary effusion lymphoma (PEL)-like lymphoma presenting with lymphomatous effusions complicated by cardiac tamponade. A 68-year-old woman was hospitalized with generalized weakness in June 2006. Echocardiogram revealed the presence of pericardial effusion and she had the signs of cardiac tamponade. Urgent pericardial drainage relieved her symptoms. Chest computed tomography showed bilateral pleural effusions along with pericardial effusion. Cytologic findings of both effusions were suggestive of malignancies, including malignant lymphoma. Immunocytochemical studies with a panel of antibodies, including CD20 and CD79a, could not provide a definite diagnosis. Flow cytometric analysis of pleural effusion revealed that tumor cells were positive for CD10 and CD19, but negative for CD20, CD23, surface immunoglobulin, and T-cell associated antigens. Clonal rearrangement of the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was detected by Southern blot analysis. Polymerase chain reaction proved to be negative for HHV-8. The serology test for HIV was negative. After a diagnosis of HHV-8-negative PEL-like lymphoma, she was treated with CHOP chemotherapy (cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone). However, she died of progressive lymphoma 7 months after the diagnosis. PEL-like lymphomas are of B-cell origin. In some cases of PEL-like lymphoma, tumor cells may be negative for representative markers of B-cell phenotype such as CD20 and CD79a.",M1

Mutations in TP53, PTEN, PIK3CA, CTNNB1/beta-catenin genes and deletion of CDKN2A-ARF (p14(ARF)-p16(NK4a I) ) locus were investigated in sixteen primary primary effusion lymphoma tumors and seven primary effusion lymphoma cell lines using PCR and sequencing. TP53 mutations were detected in one primary primary effusion lymphoma tumor (6.2%) and two primary effusion lymphoma cell lines (28.6%). BC-3 and BCP-1 cell lines showed PTEN gene mutations, associated with a loss of PTEN protein expression in both cases. No mutations were detected in PIK3CA and CTNNB1/beta-catenin hotspot sequences. Only BC-3 contained a homozygous deletion of CDKN2A-ARF locus. Although detected at a higher frequency in primary effusion lymphoma cell lines than in primary primary effusion lymphoma tumors, TP53 and/or PTEN mutations, as well as deletion of CDKN2A-ARF locus are uncommon in primary effusion lymphoma, and are found to correlate with the EBV-negative status of primary effusion lymphoma tumors.",M1
19555417,"Quantitation of human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) antibody in patients transfused with HHV-8-seropositive blood.BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is endemic in Uganda where seroprevalence is approximately 40%. In a previous study, Ugandan patients receiving blood transfusions had multiple serum specimens collected for 6 months after transfusion to monitor for HHV-8 infection. It was observed that several HHV-8-seronegative patients were unexpectedly HHV-8 seropositive after blood transfusion. STUDY DESIGN AND METHODS: This study measured HHV-8 antibody in serially collected serum specimens from 542 patients who received transfusions and evaluated the risk of HHV-8 infection as a function of HHV-8 antibody levels in the donors. RESULTS: HHV-8 antibody was observed in 52% of patients transfused with HHV-8-seropositive blood in amounts that corresponded with their donor's antibody titer and waned within 40 days. Higher levels of passive HHV-8 antibody in patients who received transfusions appeared to be associated with a lower risk of HHV-8 infection. CONCLUSION: The source of transient antibody in patients who received transfusions was determined to be the transfused blood. Donors with higher HHV-8 antibody titers may have been less likely to have infectious virus in the blood.",M1

19521981,"Biscoclaurine alkaloid cepharanthine inhibits the growth of primary effusion lymphoma in vitro and in vivo and induces apoptosis via suppression of the NF-kappaB pathway.Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a unique and recently identified non-Hodgkin's lymphoma that was originally identified in patients with AIDS. PEL is caused by the Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpes virus (KSHV/<e>HHV-8</e>) and shows a peculiar presentation involving liquid growth in the serous body cavity and a poor prognosis. As the nuclear factor (NF)-kappaB pathway is activated in PEL and plays a central role in oncogenesis, we examined the effect of a biscoclaurine alkaloid, cepharanthine (CEP) on PEL derived cell lines (BCBL-1, TY-1 and RM-P1), in vitro and in vivo. An methylthiotetrazole assay revealed that the cell proliferation of PEL cell lines was significantly suppressed by the addition of CEP (1-10 microg/ml). CEP also inhibited NF-kappaB activation and induced apoptotic cell death in PEL cell lines. We established a PEL animal model by intraperitoneal injection of BCBL-1, which led to the development of ascites and diffuse infiltration of organs, without obvious solid lymphoma formation, which resembles the diffuse nature of human PEL. Intraperitoneal administration of CEP inhibited ascites formation and diffuse infiltration of BCBL-1 without significant systemic toxicity in this model. These results indicate that NF-kappaB could be an ideal molecular target for treating PEL and that CEP is quite useful as a unique therapeutic agent for PEL.",M1
19484335,"Report of an HIV and <e>HHV-8</e> negative case of primary effusion lymphoma with idiopathic T4 lymphocytopenia.Although primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is usually associated with human herpes virus-8/Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (HHV-8/KSHV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), there are several reports of HHV-8/KSHV and HIV negative cases, mainly in the setting of immunodeficiency. Here, we report the second case of PEL associated with idiopathic T4 lymphocytopenia (ICL), which was HHV-8/KSHV negative, HIV negative and Epstein-Barr virus positive, while no other causative agents for immunodeficiency were documented. Flow cytometry revealed a hyperdiploid and highly mitotic large B-cell population, CD30, EMA, CD66, CD38 and CD71 positive. The malignant lymphoma cells showed atypia with prominent nuclei and basophilic vacuolated cytoplasm, while cytogenetic analysis with fluorescent in situ hybridization showed trisomy 18. The patient was administered R-COP chemotherapy, but no remission was achieved, up to 3 months from diagnosis.",M1
19479040,"High human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) prevalence, clinical correlates and high incidence among recently HIV-1-infected subjects in Sao Paulo, Brazil.BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is the etiological agent for Kaposi Sarcoma, which occurs especially in HIV-infected subjects. HHV-8 infection and its clinical correlates have not been well characterized in recently HIV-1-infected subjects, especially men who have sex with men (MSM). METHODOLOGY/ PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We assessed the HHV-8 seroprevalence, clinical correlates, and incidence after one year of follow-up in a cohort of 228 recently HIV-1-infected individuals, of whom 83.6% were MSM, using indirect immunofluorescence assay. The prevalence of HHV-8 infection at the time of cohort enrollment was 25.9% (59/228). In the univariate model, there were significant associations with male gender, black ethnicity, MSM practice, and previous hepatitis B virus and syphilis infections. In the multivariate model we could still demonstrate association with MSM, hepatitis B, and black ethnicity. No differences in mean CD4+ cell counts or HIV viral load according to HHV-8 status were found. In terms of incidence, there were 23/127 (18.1%) seroconversions in the cohort after 1 year. CONCLUSIONS: HHV-8 is highly prevalent among recently HIV-1-infected subjects. Correlations with other sexually transmitted infections suggest common transmission routes.",M1
19469019,"Transient inhibition of NF-kappaB by DHMEQ induces cell death of primary effusion lymphoma without <e>HHV-8</e> reactivation.Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a refractory malignancy caused by human herpes virus 8 (HHV-8) in immunocompromised individuals. The tumor cells of PEL are characterized by constitutive NF-kappaB activation. Dehydroxymethylepoxyquinomicin (DHMEQ) is a new NF-kappaB inhibitor and is effective on various tumor cells with constitutively activated NF-kappaB. Thus, in search for a new therapeutic modality of PEL, we examined the effect of DHMEQ on PEL cells. We confirmed constitutive activation of NF-kappaB with subcomponents of p50 and p65 in PEL cell lines. DHMEQ quickly and transiently abrogated NF-kappaB activation and reduced the cell viability in dose- and time-dependent manners, inducing apoptosis through activation of both mitochondrial and membrane pathways. Array analysis revealed that DHMEQ down-regulated expression levels of NF-kappaB target genes, such as interleukin-6 (IL6), Myc, chemokine (C-C motif) receptor 5 (CCR5) and NF-kappaB1, whereas it up-regulated expression levels of some genes involved in apoptosis, and cell cycle arrest. DHMEQ did not reactivate HHV-8 lytic genes, indicating that NF-kappaB inhibition by DHMEQ did not induce virus replication. DHEMQ rescued CB-17 SCID mice xenografted with PEL cells, reducing the gross appearance of effusion. Thus, DHMEQ transiently abrogated the NF-kappaB activation, irreversibly triggering the apoptosis cascade without HHV-8 reactivation. In addition, DHMEQ could rescue the PEL-xenograft mice. Therefore, we suggest DHMEQ as a promising candidate for molecular target therapy of the PEL.",M1
19400749,"Lack of evidence for frequent heterosexual transmission of human herpesvirus 8 in Zimbabwe.BACKGROUND: There is conflicting evidence about the contribution of heterosexual transmission to the spread of human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) in southern Africa. This study evaluated the hypothesis that HHV-8 infection is associated with risk factors for human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) and other sexually transmitted infections among Zimbabwean men. METHODS: HHV-8 seroprevalence was determined for 2750 participants in the Zimbabwe AIDS Prevention Project cohort of male factory workers in Harare, Zimbabwe. Potential associations of HHV-8 antibody detection with risk factors for HIV-1 infection were examined by univariate analysis. Variables with P &lt; .1 in the univariate analysis were included in a multivariate logistic regression model. HHV-8 seroprevalence was also determined among 297 heterosexual couples. RESULTS: Prevalence of HHV-8, HIV-1, and HHV-8 and HIV-1 coinfection was 28.5% (95% confidence interval [CI], 26.8%-30.2%), 19.5% (95% CI, 18.0%-20.9%), and 6.5% (95% CI, 5.6%-7.5%), respectively. Detection of HHV-8 antibodies was independently associated with older age and HIV-1 infection but not with number of recent sex partners, marital status, education, condom use, prior sexually transmitted infections, payment for sex, chronic hepatitis B infection, or incident HIV-1 infection. HHV-8 seroprevalence was 31.7% (95% CI, 26.3-37.0) among wives in the couples tested, but HHV-8 infection of wives was not associated with HHV-8 infection of husbands (odds ratio, 1.08; 95% CI, 0.62-1.88; P = .8). CONCLUSIONS: HHV-8 and HIV-1 infection did not have common sexual risk factors among urban Zimbabwean men. Sexual transmission does not explain the high prevalence of HHV-8 in this population.",M1
19386721,"Determinants of secretion and intracellular localization of human herpesvirus 8 interleukin-6.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) interleukin-6 (vIL-6) is distinct from human and other cellular IL-6 proteins in that it does not require the nonsignaling alpha-receptor subunit for the formation of gp130-based signal transducing complexes and also is largely retained intracellularly rather than being secreted. We and others have reported that vIL-6 is retained and is active in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) compartment, and data from our laboratory have demonstrated that intracellular vIL-6 is functional in the autocrine promotion of proliferation and survival of HHV-8 latently infected primary effusion lymphoma cells. It has also been reported that vIL-6 secretion in gp130-deficient cells can be enhanced by introduced gp130, thereby implicating the signal transducer in vIL-6 trafficking to the cell surface. We examine here the requirements for intracellular retention and localization of vIL-6. Using vIL-6-hIL-6 chimeric and point-mutated vIL-6 proteins, we identified regions and residues of vIL-6 influencing vIL-6 secretion. However, there was no correlation between vIL-6 secretion and gp130 interaction. We found that vIL-6, but not hIL-6, could associate stably with ER-resident chaperone protein calnexin. Glycosylation-dependent interaction of vIL-6 with calnexin correlated with proper protein folding, but there was no direct relationship between vIL-6-calnexin interaction and intracellular retention. While calnexin depletion had little influence on absolute amounts of secreted vIL-6, it led to markedly reduced levels of intracellular cytokine. This was reversed by gp130 transduction, which had no detectable effect on vIL-6 secretion, but redistributed vIL-6 into ER-distinct locations in calnexin-depleted cells, specifically. Our data reveal that calnexin plays a role in ER localization of vIL-6 and that gp130 promotes ER exit, but not secretion, of the viral cytokine.",M1
19385734,"Lack of evidence for human herpesvirus-8 transmission via blood transfusion in a historical US cohort.BACKGROUND: Recent studies have found evidence of occasional human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 transmission via blood transfusion. However, because these studies were conducted outside the United States or did not have linked donor-recipient pairs, they have a limited ability to inform US blood-banking policy. METHODS: We investigated <e>HHV-8</e> transmission via blood transfusion in the United States by conducting HHV-8 serologic testing among participants of the Transfusion-Transmitted Viruses Study (TTVS), who enrolled during the 1970s. RESULTS: HHV-8 seroprevalence was 2.8% (29/1023) among blood donors, 7.1% (96/1350) among transfusion recipients, 7.7% (46/599) among surgical control patients who did not receive transfusions, and 96.3% (77/80) among control patients with Kaposi sarcoma. One transfusion recipient seroconverted (0.08% [1/1259]), but this patient did not receive any HHV-8-seropositive blood units, suggesting that the infection was not related to blood transfusion. One of the surgical control patients who did not receive transfusions also seroconverted (0.18% [1/556]). Rates of seroconversion were 1.6 per 1000 person-years (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.04-8.9 per 1000 person-years) for the transfusion recipients and 3.6 per 1000 person-years (95% CI, 0.09-20.1 per 1000 person-years) for the surgical control patients who did not receive transfusions (P = .61). CONCLUSIONS: Rates of HHV-8 seroconversion in the transfusion and nontransfusion groups were not statistically different, and the historical nature of the cohort (e.g., before leukoreduction) suggests that any current transmission via blood transfusion is rare.",M1
19382664,"Human herpesvirus 8 seroprevalence among internationally adopted children coming from Eastern Europe.The seroprevalence of Human Herpes Virus 8 (<e>HHV8</e>) and its transmission pattern were assessed testing serum samples of 120 internationally adopted children (aged 1-15 years) coming from Eastern Europe. Determinations of IgG antibodies against both latent and lytic HHV-8 antigens were performed by indirect immunofluorescence assay. Antibodies were detected only for lytic antigen of the virus in 12.5% of children with a seroprevalence significatively higher (19.6%) in young children (age 1-6). No correlation was observed between HHV8 seropositivity and serological markers for hepatitis A, B and C viruses and Human Immunodeficiency virus. In conclusion, our findings suggest that HHV8 infection is widespread in some populations from the East Europe, and that person to person contacts among children could be considered the predominant mode of HHV8 transmission in younger age.",M1
19369621,"Complete absence of KSHV/<e>HHV-8</e> in posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders: an immunohistochemical and molecular study of 52 cases.Posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders (PTLDs), a heterogeneous group of monoclonal or polyclonal lesions, occur in immunosuppressed patients after solid organ or bone marrow transplantation. Although most PTLDs are Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ and seem to represent EBV-induced proliferations of monoclonal (or less often polyclonal) B, T, or plasma cells, a subset of PTLDs is EBV-. Because Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/HHV-8) has been described in association with the development of hematolymphoid and nonhematolymphoid neoplasms in HIV+ patients, we investigated whether there is an association between KSHV/HHV-8 and PTLDs. Formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from 52 confirmed PTLD cases were analyzed immunohistochemically for expression of KSHV/HHV-8 latent nuclear antigen (LNA)-1 protein and by polymerase chain reaction-hybridization analysis for the KSHV/HHV-8 genome. The PTLD subtypes included 12 with early lesions (1 plasmacytic hyperplasia and 11 infectious mononucleosis-like), 10 polymorphic, 23 monomorphic (5 Burkitt, 14 diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, 1 plasmacytoma, 1 multiple myeloma, and 2 T-cell), 1 Hodgkin lymphoma (HL), 5 HL-like lesions, and 1 unclassified or other. None of the 51 tested specimens showed expression of KSHV/HHV-8 LNA-1. Furthermore, all 46 specimens tested demonstrated complete absence of the KSHV/HHV-8 genome. Our data clearly indicated that KSHV/HHV-8 is not associated with PTLDs.",M1
19343828,"HIV-associated multicentric Castleman disease.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: In this review we will discuss the recent findings in HIV-associated multicentric Castleman disease. On the basis of current knowledge on pathophysiology, we will illustrate different therapeutic approaches and try to provide guidelines at least for the initial care of the disease. RECENT FINDINGS: On the basis of pathological and virological data, pathophysiology appears to conjugate both proliferation of human herpesvirus (<e>HHV-8</e>) infected plasmablasts and replication of HHV-8. Therefore, recent therapies have targeted the infected cells using chemotherapy or rituximab, an anti-CD20 monoclonal antibody or both, and the virus replication by using valganciclovir, a potent antiviral drug usually used against cytomegalovirus. SUMMARY: Etoposide is the most effective first-line therapy for active multicentric Castleman disease. Rituximab can be used after an initial control of the attack and provides a 1-yearremission rate above 70%. Exacerbation of Kaposi sarcoma lesions, observed in half of the patients with previous Kaposi sarcoma lesions, may represent a limitation.Valganciclovir effectively suppresses HHV-8 replication both in vitro and in vivo, and reduction in HHV-8 viremia associated with clinical improvement has been suggested in short series of patients with multicentric Castleman disease treated with valganciclovir.",M1

Patients with Multicentric Castleman Disease and HHV-8-related lymphoma diagnosed and treated from April 1987 to June 2004 were included in the study. HHV-8 and HIV plasma viral load, CD4+ count, hematologic parameters, and general wellbeing (performance status) were assessed at the onset of the diseases and analyzed in order to identify possible prognostic factors. Nine patients with Multicentric Castleman disease, and 16 with HHV-8-related lymphomas (13 primary effusion lymphomas and 3 solid lymphomas), were diagnosed and treated out of 327 HIV-related non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Four patients with Multicentric Castleman disease received only antiretroviral drugs; 5 HAART plus oral etoposide. Nine patients with primary effusion lymphoma were treated with a CHOP-like regimen (Cyclophosphamide, Prednisone anthracyclines, Vinca alkaloids, Bleomycin, Etoposide) and HAART; 1 with etoposide and HAART, 1 with HAART alone. The patients with solid lymphoma underwent CHOP-like chemotherapy. Patients with Multicentric Castleman disease showed lower median values of HHV-8 viral load and longer overall survival compared with HHV-8-related lymphomas. Patients with viral load of HHV-8, &gt;40,000 cp/ml had a significant shorter overall survival. In the univariate analysis, HHV-8-related lymphoma, HHV-8 viral load &gt;40,000 cp/ml and performance status &gt;2 were associated with an increased risk of death. Multivariate analysis confirmed the diagnosis of lymphoma as an independent predictor of shorter survival.",M1

APMIS 2009; 117:222-29. Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a very rare type of lymphoma usually confined to the body cavities predominantly in immunosuppressed patients infected with human herpes virus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>). The new term for HHV-8 independent PEL is HHV8-unrelated PEL-like lymphoma. We describe an 89-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-negative male patient with HHV8-unrelated PEL-like lymphoma in the pleura. No hepatosplenomegaly or lymphadenopathy was detected. Chest radiography and computed tomography revealed right pleural effusion, but no evidence of tumor mass or lymph node enlargement. Cytological analysis of the pleural effusion revealed a high-grade lymphoma with round nuclei, prominent nucleoli and abundant cytoplasm with immunophenotypes positive for CD45, CD30, CD38, CD7 and CD71. Because of the advanced age, no chemotherapy was given. Effusion resolved spontaneously. One year after the diagnosis, a new pleural effusion developed at the left side. Following thoracentesis and pleurodesis, the patient remained in complete remission for 40 months. To date, 30 cases of HHV8-unrelated PEL-like lymphoma/HIV negative have been reported in the literature. The outcome of the HHV8-unrelated PEL-like lymphoma patients who were HIV negative seems to be better than HIV- and HHV-8-positive PEL.",M1
19229882,"vOX2 glycoprotein of human herpesvirus 8 modulates human primary macrophages activity.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is a lymphotropic herpesvirus linked to several disorders such as Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma and multicentric Castleman's disease. Several HHV-8 proteins regulate host innate and adaptive immune response; in particular, orfK14 is expressed as an immediate early gene during the viral lytic cycle and encodes a surface glycoprotein (vOX2), significantly homologous to the cellular OX2, which delivers inhibitory signals to macrophages. Although it has been suggested that vOX2 may down-regulate basophil and neutrophil functions, its role in macrophages, a cell type lytically infected by HHV-8 in vivo, is still controversial. Therefore, we investigated the effect of vOX2 expression in human primary monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs). In this report, we demonstrate that vOX2-expressing MDMs in basal conditions are induced to produce inflammatory cytokines and display higher phagocytic activity with respect to mock cells. By contrast, an opposite effect is exhibited by vOX2 in MDMs undergoing IFN-gamma-activation, with a down-modulation of the cytokine production and phagocytic activity. Moreover, we observed that, when MDMs are co-cultured with vOX2-expressing cells, the inflammatory cytokine release is increased, independently from the MDM activation state. Interestingly, we could correlate our results with the mRNA transcript level of the vOX2 cellular CD200R receptor. Finally, we demonstrate a down-regulation of the MHC class I and class II molecules on the cell surface of vOX2-transduced MDMs. Our results provide new insights into the immunomodulatory effects of HHV-8 vOX2 protein.

19222502,"The successful treatment of haemophagocytic syndrome in patients with human immunodeficiency virus-associated multi-centric Castleman's disease.Both virus-associated haemophagocytic syndrome (HPS) and human immunodeficiency virus-associated multi-centric Castleman's disease (HIV-MCD) induced by human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) are extremely rare. We therefore wished to investigate their occurrence together, and establish the degree of cytokine activation present. From a prospective cohort of individuals with HIV-MCD, we investigated the incidence and outcomes of HPS and measured 15 inflammatory cytokines and the plasma HHV-8 viral loads before and during follow-up. Of 44 patients with HIV-MCD with an incidence of 4.3/10,000 patient years, four individuals (9%) were diagnosed with HPS. All are in remission (range 6-28 months) following splenectomy, etoposide and rituximab-based therapy. Plasma HHV-8 levels were raised markedly at presentation (median 3,840,000 copies/ml). Histological samples from spleen, splenic hilar lymph nodes and bone marrow demonstrated increased phagocytosis by histiocytes and presence of HHV-8-infected plasmablasts outside the follicles. Surprisingly, many known inflammatory plasma cytokines were not elevated, although interleukin (IL)-8 and interferon-gamma were increased in all cases and IL-6 levels were raised in three of four patients. HPS in the setting of HIV-MCD is common and treatment can be successful provided the diagnosis is made appropriately. Systemic activation of cytokines was limited, suggesting that immunosuppressive therapy with steroids is not indicated in HHV-8-driven HPS.",M1
19182916,"Human herpesvirus 8 DNA load in the leukocytes correlates with the platelet counts in HIV type 1-infected individuals.Abstract Human herpes virus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is known to be reactivated in immunocompromised situations and it is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and some hematological diseases. The aim of this study was to analyze the effect of HHV-8 on HIV-1 infection, especially on thrombocytopenia complicated with HIV infection. The HHV-8 DNA load was determined by a quantitative real-time PCR, using leukocytes from 125 HIV-1-infected individuals. HHV-8 DNA was detected in 37 individuals. The increased HIV-1 load and reduced percentage of CD4-positive T cells were significantly associated with the presence of HHV-8. The prevalence and load for HHV-8 are higher in patients with KS than in patients without KS, but the difference is not significant. The increased HHV-8 DNA load was significantly correlated with thrombocytopenia, and platelet counts were significantly lower in individuals with HHV-8 than in individuals without HHV-8. We also obtained the negative correlations between changes in platelet counts and changes in HHV-8 DNA loads. The association between thrombocytopenia and HHV-8 has never been reported previously, apart from some case reports of Castleman's disease and KS. Various cytokines or chemokines are produced by HHV-8-infected cells, some of which have been reported to inhibit hematopoiesis. This may be one of the mechanisms by which HHV-8 infection induces thrombocytopenia. These results indicate that HHV-8 DNA in leukocytes may provide useful information for the assessment of the clinical appearance of HIV-1 infection.",M1
19179554,"The role of immune suppression and <e>HHV-8</e> in the increasing incidence of HIV-associated multicentric Castleman's disease.BACKGROUND: In HIV cohorts with access to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is falling; however, the incidence of multicentric Castleman's disease (MCD) in HIV has not previously been described. METHODS: The incidence of HIV-associated MCD was calculated from a prospective HIV database with 56 202 patient-years of follow-up and compared with KS. Univariate and multivariate analyses were carried out to identify factors associated with MCD. Plasma human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 DNA levels were measured in HIV-seropositive individuals with newly diagnosed MCD (n = 24), KS (n = 72), HIV-associated lymphoma (n = 74) and HIV-positive controls (n = 53). RESULTS: From 24 cases of HIV-associated MCD, the incidence measured 4.3/10,000 patient-years [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.7-6.4]. The incidence in the pre-HAART (1983-1996), early-HAART (1997-2001) and later HAART (2002-2007) eras were 2.3 (95% CI 0.02-4.2), 2.8 (95% CI 0.9-6.5) and 8.3 (95% CI 4.6-12.6), respectively, representing a statistically significant increase over time (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, from 1180 cases of KS, the incidence in this cohort decreased with time. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that a nadir CD4 count &gt;200/mm(3), increased age, no previous HAART exposure and non-Caucasian ethnicity were all associated with an increased risk of MCD. Plasma HHV-8 DNA levels were higher in patients with newly diagnosed MCD than with KS, lymphomas or HIV-positive controls (Mann-Whitney U-test, P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The incidence of HIV-associated MCD is increasing. It appears to occur more frequently in older HIV-positive individuals with well-preserved immune function.",M1
19142585,"Recombinant ORF66 and ORFK12 antigens for the detection of human herpesvirus 8 antibodies in HIV-positive and -negative patients.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>), also known as Kaposi's sarcoma (KS)-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), is not routinely isolated in cell cultures, and thus detection of HHV-8-specific antibodies is usually performed. In this study, we performed recombinant antigens ORF66- and ORFK12-based Western blot strip assays and ELISA, and surveyed the seroprevalence of HHV-8 antibodies in HIV-positive and -negative patients. In serum samples from patients with positive plasma HHV-8 DNA, the sensitivity of the Western blot strip assay was 100% for the anti-ORF66 antibodies and 83.3% for the anti-ORFK12 antibodies. In addition, ORF66-based ELISA showed higher levels of specificity (87.3%) and sensitivity (84.8%) than ORFK12-based ELISA. Moreover, the area under the receiver-operating characteristics curves (AUROC) was 0.76 for ORF66-based ELISA and 0.66 for ORFK12-based ELISA. The seroprevalence of HHV-8 antibodies to ORF66 and/or ORFK12 in the HIV-infected patients (55%, 97/176) was significantly higher than in the DM patients (45%, 135/301) (P = 0.03) and the HIV-/DM-negative group (11%, 11/100) (P &lt; 0.01). In the HIV-infected patients, the seropositivity of the HHV-8-specific antibody was 30% to both antigens, 19% to ORFK12 and 5.7% to ORF66. Importantly, HHV-8 seropositivity in the HIV-infected patients was significantly associated with the transmission method of intravenous injection and high levels of HIV RNA loading (P &lt; 0.01), but not with gender, CD4 cell numbers or AIDS symptoms. This study assessed the sensitivity and specificity of ORF66 and ORFK12 for the detection of HHV-8 antibodies, providing novel antigens for the diagnosis of HHV-8 infection and epidemiology of HHV-8 seroprevalence.",M1
19129458,"A systems biology approach to identify the combination effects of human herpesvirus 8 genes on NF-kappaB activation.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi's sarcoma and primary effusion lymphoma. Activation of the cellular transcription factor nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) is essential for latent persistence of HHV-8, survival of HHV-8-infected cells, and disease progression. We used reverse-transfected cell microarrays (RTCM) as an unbiased systems biology approach to systematically analyze the effects of HHV-8 genes on the NF-kappaB signaling pathway. All HHV-8 genes individually (n = 86) and, additionally, all K and latent genes in pairwise combinations (n = 231) were investigated. Statistical analyses of more than 14,000 transfections identified ORF75 as a novel and confirmed K13 as a known HHV-8 activator of NF-kappaB. K13 and ORF75 showed cooperative NF-kappaB activation. Small interfering RNA-mediated knockdown of ORF75 expression demonstrated that this gene contributes significantly to NF-kappaB activation in HHV-8-infected cells. Furthermore, our approach confirmed K10.5 as an NF-kappaB inhibitor and newly identified K1 as an inhibitor of both K13- and ORF75-mediated NF-kappaB activation. All results obtained with RTCM were confirmed with classical transfection experiments. Our work describes the first successful application of RTCM for the systematic analysis of pathofunctions of genes of an infectious agent. With this approach, ORF75 and K1 were identified as novel HHV-8 regulatory molecules on the NF-kappaB signal transduction pathway. The genes identified may be involved in fine-tuning of the balance between latency and lytic replication, since this depends critically on the state of NF-kappaB activity.",M1
19115001,"In vitro and in vivo human herpesvirus 8 infection of placenta.Herpesvirus infection of placenta may be harmful in pregnancy leading to disorders in fetal growth, premature delivery, miscarriage, or major congenital abnormalities. Although a correlation between human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) infection and abortion or low birth weight in children has been suggested, and rare cases of in utero or perinatal HHV-8 transmission have been documented, no direct evidence of HHV-8 infection of placenta has yet been reported. The aim of this study was to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo susceptibility of placental cells to HHV-8 infection. Short-term infection assays were performed on placental chorionic villi isolated from term placentae. Qualitative and quantitative HHV-8 detection were performed by PCR and real-time PCR, and HHV-8 proteins were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. Term placenta samples from HHV-8-seropositive women were analyzed for the presence of HHV-8 DNA and antigens. In vitro infected histocultures showed increasing amounts of HHV-8 DNA in tissues and supernatants; cyto- and syncitiotrophoblasts, as well as endothelial cells, expressed latent and lytic viral antigens. Increased apoptotic phenomena were visualized by the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated deoxyuridine nick end-labeling method in infected histocultures. Ex vivo, HHV-8 DNA and a latent viral antigen were detected in placenta samples from HHV-8-seropositive women. These findings demonstrate that HHV-8, like other human herpesviruses, may infect placental cells in vitro and in vivo, thus providing evidence that this phenomenon might influence vertical transmission and pregnancy outcome in HHV-8-infected women.",M1

However, seroprevalence and modes of transmission of HHV-8 among Tobago women are not known. HHV-8 seropositivity rates in Tobago women were examined and compared rates to Tobago men of similar ages. To assess possible modes of transmission, sexual behavior among Tobago women was examined to determine its association with HHV-8 seropositivity. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 213 Tobago women, ages 18-65 years, who participated in the Tobago Cervical and Oral Cancer Screening Study. HHV-8 seropositivity was determined by a monoclonal immunofluorescence assay. Age-specific rates were compared to those previously observed in men. Logistic regression analyses were performed to determine the association between HHV-8 seropositivity and sexual behavior among the women. HHV-8 seroprevalence among Tobago women was 14.1% (95% CI, 10-19%), with no significant difference with men of similar age (P-value = 0.741). Age &lt;or=17 years at first sexual intercourse was found to have a minimal significant association with HHV-8 seropositivity (OR = 2.51, 95% CI = 1.09-5.78) in women. HHV-8 age-specific rates were similar between genders. Sexual activity may not be a major contributor to HHV-8 infection among Tobago women.",M1
19088276,"Cytokine production by human herpesvirus 8-infected dendritic cells.We have shown previously that human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>)-infected dendritic cells (DCs) undergo incomplete maturation and have a defective antigen-presenting function. Here, we examined the effects of HHV-8 infection on cytokine production, which is critical to the function of DCs. We detected expression of interleukin (IL)-6, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein (MIP)-1alpha, MIP-1beta, RANTES and IL-12p40 from 2 to 6 h post-infection, and these peaked by 15-24 h. Expression of these factors decreased 24-48 h post-infection, with the exception of TNF-alpha which remained high throughout the entire 72 h. Interestingly, while IL-12p40 expression increased post-infection, bioactive IL-12p70 was not detected in the supernatants. These results suggest an intentional skewing of cytokine production in HHV-8-infected DCs towards induction of a Th2 response.",M1

18989224,"Prevalence and correlates of human herpesvirus 8 infection among Peruvian men who have sex with men.BACKGROUND: Infection with human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is common among men who have sex with men (MSM) in North America and Europe and is also found to be endemic in some regions of South America. Little is known about HHV-8 prevalence and its correlates among MSM in the Andean region. METHODS: We assessed HHV-8 seroprevalence among 497 MSM recruited for the 2002 Peruvian HIV sentinel surveillance program using a combined HHV-8 enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescence assay algorithm. Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate odds ratios (ORs) and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to determine the association between selected covariates and HHV-8 seropositivity. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-one (66.5%, 95% CI 63.1% to 69.9%) of 197 HIV-infected and 80 (26.7%, 95% CI 24.4% to 29.0%) of 300 HIV-uninfected MSM had serologic evidence of HHV-8 infection. Factors independently associated with HHV-8 infection were education&lt;12 years (OR 1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.7), anal receptive sex with the last partner (OR 2.0, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.3), self-reported sexually transmitted infection symptoms during the last year (OR 1.9, 95% CI 1.2 to 3.0), coinfection with HIV (OR 4.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 6.4) and chronic hepatitis B (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.5 to 15.8). MSM with long-standing HIV infection were more likely to have serologic evidence of HHV-8 infection when compared with men with recently acquired HIV (OR 3.8, 95% CI 1.7 to 9.1). CONCLUSIONS: HHV-8 infection is common among both HIV-infected and HIV-negative MSM in Lima, Peru. HHV-8 seropositivity is correlated with anal receptive sex, self-reported sexually transmitted infection symptoms, and HIV infection among these MSM and thus seems to be sexually transmitted. HHV-8 infection seems to be acquired after HIV infection, suggesting that future studies should evaluate the mode of HHV-8 transmission and prevention strategies among HIV-uninfected MSM.",M1
18987143,"Intracellular signaling mechanisms and activities of human herpesvirus 8 interleukin-6.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>)-encoded viral interleukin-6 (vIL-6) has been implicated as a key factor in virus-associated neoplasia because of its proproliferative and survival effects and also in view of its angiogenic properties. A major difference between vIL-6 and human IL-6 (hIL-6) is that vIL-6, uniquely, is largely retained and can signal intracellularly. While vIL-6 is generally considered to be a lytic gene, several reports have noted its low-level expression in latently infected primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) cultures, in the absence of other lytic gene expression. Thus, intracellular autocrine signal transduction by the viral cytokine may be of particular relevance to the growth and survival of latently infected cells and to pathogenesis. Here we report that most intracellular vIL-6 is located in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), signals via the gp130 signal transducer in this compartment, and does so independently of the gp80 alpha-subunit of the IL-6 receptor, required for hIL-6 signal transduction. Signaling and biological assays incorporating ER-retained vIL-6 and hIL-6 confirmed vIL-6 activity, specifically, in this compartment. Knockdown of vIL-6 expression in PEL cells led to markedly reduced cell growth in normal culture, independently of extracellular cytokines. This could be reversed by reintroduction via virus vector of exclusively ER-retained vIL-6. These data indicate that in virus biology vIL-6 may act to support the growth and survival of cells latently infected with HHV-8 in an autocrine manner via intracrine signaling and that these activities may contribute to the maintenance of latently infected cells and to virus-induced neoplasia.",M1
18987137,"Viral inhibitor of apoptosis vFLIP/K13 protects endothelial cells against superoxide-induced cell death.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). HHV-8 encodes an antiapoptotic viral Fas-associated death domain-like interleukin-1beta-converting enzyme-inhibitory protein (vFLIP/K13). The antiapoptotic activity of vFLIP/K13 has been attributed to an inhibition of caspase 8 activation and more recently to its capability to induce the expression of antiapoptotic proteins via activation of NF-kappaB. Our study provides the first proteome-wide analysis of the effect of vFLIP/K13 on cellular-protein expression. Using comparative proteome analysis, we identified manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD), a mitochondrial antioxidant and an important antiapoptotic enzyme, as the protein most strongly upregulated by vFLIP/K13 in endothelial cells. MnSOD expression was also upregulated in endothelial cells upon infection with HHV-8. Microarray analysis confirmed that MnSOD is also upregulated at the RNA level, though the differential expression at the RNA level was much lower (5.6-fold) than at the protein level (25.1-fold). The induction of MnSOD expression was dependent on vFLIP/K13-mediated activation of NF-kappaB, occurred in a cell-intrinsic manner, and was correlated with decreased intracellular superoxide accumulation and increased resistance of endothelial cells to superoxide-induced death. The upregulation of MnSOD expression by vFLIP/K13 may support the survival of HHV-8-infected cells in the inflammatory microenvironment in KS.",M1
18983461,"Immunophenotypic analysis of the Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV; <e>HHV-8</e>)-infected B cells in HIV+ multicentric Castleman disease (MCD).AIMS: Kaposi sarcoma herpesvirus (KSHV) is aetiologically related to Kaposi sarcoma, classical and extracavitary primary effusion lymphoma (PEL; EC-PEL) and multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), entities preferentially occurring in HIV-infected individuals. Characterization of HIV-associated PELs/EC-PELs suggests that the KSHV-infected malignant cells originate from a pre-terminal stage of B-cell differentiation. However, only limited phenotypic studies have been performed on HIV+ MCD, including for PR domain containing 1 with zinc finger domain/B lymphocyte-induced maturation protein 1 (PRDM1/BLIMP1), a key regulator of terminal B-cell differentiation. The aim was to characterize KSHV-infected cells in 17 cases of HIV+ MCD. METHODS AND RESULTS: Double immunohistochemistry and immunohistochemistry-in situ hybridization were used to characterize the KSHV-infected cells in MCD; the results were compared with the phenotypic profiles of 39 PELs/EC-PELs and seven PEL cell lines. Whereas the immunophenotype of KSHV-infected cells in MCD and malignant KSHV+ PEL cells was similar (PAX5, Bcl-6-; PRDM1/BLIMP1, IRF4/MUM1+; Ki67+), the MCD KSHV-infected cells differed, as they expressed OCT2, cytoplasmic lambda immunoglobulin; variably expressed CD27; lacked CD138; and were Epstein-Barr virus negative. CONCLUSIONS: Although both PEL and MCD originate from KSHV-infected pre-terminally differentiated B cells, these findings, with previously reported genetic studies, indicate HIV+ MCD may arise from extrafollicular B cells, whereas PELs may originate from cells that have traversed the germinal centre.",M1

A cross-sectional survey included 166 HIV-infected patients and 219 blood donors. Antibodies against HSV-2 were determined by enzyme immunoassays based on gG2 recombinant glycoprotein. HSV-2 seroprevalence was 45.8% in HIV-infected patients and 8.7% in blood donors (p &lt; 0.0001; OR 8.8; 95% CI 5.05-15.49). Independent predictors of HSV-2 seropositivity were HIV infection (OR 11.0; 95% CI 5.93-20.41), female gender (OR 2.28; 95% CI 1.22-4.26), older age (OR 3.93; 95% CI 2.74-7.11), and HHV-8 seropositivity (OR 2.72; 95% CI 1.09-6.75). Understanding the epidemiology of HSV-2 is a critical first step in designing interventions to decrease HSV-2 and HIV transmission. The association of HSV-2 with HIV infection and HHV-8 antibodies suggests a similar transmission route.",M1
18803660,"Evaluation of the role of human herpes virus 6 and 8 in parapsoriasis.INTRODUCTION: The aetiology of mycosis fungoides and parapsoriasis (which may be considered as an early stage of mycosis fungoides) remains debated. Previous recent studies have suspected the involvement of viral agents and particularly human herpes viruses (HHV).The aim of the present study was to screen for the presence of HHV-6 and <e>HHV-8</e> genome in parapsoriasis samples. METHOD: Fifty paraffin-embedded samples from skin biopsies of parapsoriasis were retrospectively collected from archival files in our Dermatology department. Total DNA was extracted from samples using the phenol-chloroform method and the presence of viral genomes was screened using real-time PCR. RESULTS: Forty nine out of the fifty tissue samples of parapsoriasis were interpretable, they were all found negative for HHV-6 and HHV-8. DISCUSSION: This study does not confirm the suspected role of HHV-6 or -8 in parapsoriasis. HHV-8 has been the most studied virus in parapsoriasis and more widely in cutaneous lymphoproliferative diseases and our results are in agreement with most of the studies which found none or few HHV-8 in more advanced stages of cutaneous lymphoproliferative diseases. Concerning HHV-6, our study is the first one investigating the presence of this virus in lesional tissue samples of patients with parapsoriasis. In conclusion, parapsoriasis does not seem to be associated with either HHV-6 or HHV-8.",M1
18787825,"Plasmablastic lymphoma: CNS involvement, coexistence of other malignancies, possible viral etiology, and dismal outcome.The clinical and pathological findings of plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) have been described in the literature but the etiology is not well established, and treatment options are poorly defined. We reviewed patients with PBL in our institution to characterize the clinicopathologic features in our patient population. In this retrospective analysis from a single academic institution, five patients with PBL were identified and analyzed. Human immunodeficiency virus and human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) were identified in 40% (two out of five) and 80% (four out of five) of these patients, respectively. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement was identified in four out of five (80%) patients. Interestingly, three out of five patients had a concurrent or preceding second primary malignancy including small lymphocytic lymphoma, endometrial cancer, and nonsmall cell lung cancer. Most of the patients had advanced disease and a poor performance status at diagnosis. Only two of the patients received systemic chemotherapy with an initial partial response. All five patients died; the median overall survival was 1 month. Our experience in patients with PBL indicates that CNS involvement is more common than reported in the literature. Coexistence of a second primary malignancy may be frequent, and prognosis remains dismal with standard lymphoma therapy. Lastly, the role of HHV-8 in the etiopathogenesis needs further trials.",M1
18768489,"Mortality among HIV-1- and human herpesvirus type 8-affected mother-infant pairs in Zambia.OBJECTIVE: To determine the respective trends in mortality of Zambian mother-infant pairs based on maternal infection with HIV-1 and human herpesvirus type 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>). METHODS: A prospective cohort study was done on Zambian mother-infant pairs, stratified by maternal serologic status and followed from 6 weeks postdelivery for 48 months. Statistical analysis of the differences in the calculated mortality rates among the four groups was done using Stata 7.0. Kaplan-Meier analysis and Cox proportional hazard models were used to measure subject survival time. RESULTS: Between September 1998 and March 2002, a total of 1,425 mother-infant pairs were enrolled. The crude mortality rate among children born to dually infected mothers was approximately 9 times higher (245.90 deaths per 1,000 live births) when compared with the death ratio of children born to seronegative mothers (24.63 deaths per 1,000 live births). The incidence rate for death was 0.34/1,000 in infants of co-infected mothers in comparison with 0.32/1,000 among HIV-1-infected mothers, 0.0336/1,000 among uninfected mothers, and 0.0403/1,000 among HHV-8-infected mothers (chi(2) = 154.56; P &lt; 0.01). Infants of co-infected mothers had a comparable risk of death in comparison with infants infected with HIV-1 alone [hazard ratio, 9.91 [95% confidence interval (95% CI), 5.08-19.37] for co-infected versus 9.26 [95% CI, 4.75-18.07] for HIV-1-infected alone]. Infants of mothers infected only with HHV-8 also had comparable survival in comparison with uninfected infants (hazard ratio, 1.21; 95% CI, 0.56-2.61). CONCLUSION: Infants born to mothers dually infected with both HIV-1 and HHV-8 have comparable survival with infants exposed to HIV-1 alone. Infants born to mothers infected only with HHV-8 have comparable survival with uninfected infants.",M1
18706107,"Seroprevalence of <e>HHV-8</e>, CMV, and EBV among the general population in Ghana, West Africa.BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) are prevalent in Africa, but less common elsewhere and the modes of transmission are still subject to debate. Generally, they rarely cause disease in the immunocompetent host but are highly oncogenic when associated with immunosuppression. Although the high prevalence of HHV-8, CMV and EBV has been well documented in Africa, such data are sparse from Ghana. METHODS: Serum samples from 3275 HIV-seronegative healthy blood donors and 250 HIV-AIDS patients were tested for antibodies specific for HHV-8, CMV and EBV by IgG ELISA assays. Differences in seropositivity rates by gender and age were evaluated using the Chi-square test with Yates correction. RESULTS: Of the 3275 HIV-seronegative healthy blood donors tested, 2573 (78.6%) were males and 702 (21.4%) were females, with ages ranging from 18 to 65 years (median 32.6; mean 31.2; mode 30). Of the 250 HIV-AIDS patients tested, 140 (56%) were males and 110 (44%) were females, with ages ranging from 17 to 64 years (median 30.8; mean 30.3; mode 28). Among the HIV-seronegative healthy blood donors, overall seroprevalence of HHV-8, CMV and EBV was 23.7%, 77.6% and 20.0%, respectively. Among the HIV-AIDS patients, overall seroprevalence of HHV-8, CMV and EBV was 65.6%, 59.2% and 87.2%, respectively. The seroprevalence of HHV-8 (p &lt; 0.005) and EBV (p &lt; 0.001) was statistically significantly higher in HIV-AIDS patients compared to HIV-seronegative healthy blood donors. There was no statistically significant difference (p = 0.24) between CMV seroprevalence in HIV-AIDS patients and HIV-seronegative healthy blood donors. Age and gender were not independent determinants (p &gt; 0.05) for all three infections among HIV-seronegative healthy blood donors and HIV-AIDS patients in Ghana. CONCLUSION: The results presented herein indicate that HHV-8, CMV and EBV infections are hyperendemic in both HIV-seronegative and HIV-seropositive Ghanaians, and suggest primarily a horizontal route of transmission of these three viral infections in Ghana.",M1

A 60-year-old man presented with persistent fever and progressive pancytopenia in June 2004. On physical examination, anemia, icterus, hepatosplenomegaly, and generalized lymphadenopathy were detected. Laboratory findings showed elevated levels of serum ferritin and soluble interleukin-2 receptor. Anti-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) antibody was negative. Bone marrow aspiration revealed a normocellular marrow with an increased number of hemophagocytic histiocytes. Biopsy of cervical lymph node disclosed pathological features compatible with the plasmablastic variant of Castleman disease. HHV-8 DNA was detected in the specimen from lymph node by polymerase chain reaction. Thus, the diagnosis of HHV-8-associated MCD complicated by HPS was made. The patient was treated with immunotherapy and subsequent chemotherapy. However, he died of bacterial sepsis after one-month therapy.

Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) has been associated with BL with different frequencies depending on the clinical variant. Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus, or human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8), infects a wide range of normal cells, having a well-established role in the pathogenesis of various neoplasms, including Kaposi sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, multicentric Castleman disease (MCD) and MCD-associated plasmablastic lymphoma. In secondary immunodeficiencies, such as HIV-1 infection and organ transplantation, HHV-8 is considered an opportunistic pathogen linked to the development of lymphomas in patients with AIDS and HIV + patients. We studied the association of EBV and HHV-8 by immunohistochemical analysis, in situ hybridization, and polymerase chain reaction in a large number of well-characterized BLs.

Evidence of HHV-8 infection within the pulmonary vasculature of patients with idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension (IPAH) has been described. We hypothesize that HHV-8 infection of pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells results in an apoptotic-resistant phenotype characteristic of severe pulmonary arterial hypertension. Our objective was to investigate the ability of HHV-8 to infect human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in vitro and characterize the phenotypic effect of this infection. Human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells were exposed to HHV-8 using two methods (direct virus and co-culture technique). The presence of lytic and latent infection was confirmed. Changes in endothelial cell gene and protein expression and effects on cellular apoptosis were measured. HHV-8 can both lytically and latently infect primary human pulmonary microvascular endothelial cells in vitro. HHV-8 infection results in significant changes in gene expression, including alterations of pathways important to cellular apoptosis. HHV-8 infection also alters expression of genes integral to the bone morphogenic protein pathway, including down-regulation of bone morphogenic protein-4. Other genes previously implicated in the development of PAH are affected by HHV-8 infection, and cells infected with HHV-8 are resistant to apoptosis.",M1

Its sudden onset suggests precipitating factors. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the putative role of human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) in the pathogenesis of ketosis-prone DM-2. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: A cross-sectional study in which antibodies were searched against latent and lytic HHV-8 antigens using immunofluorescence. The presence of HHV-8 in genomic DNA was investigated in 22 of the participants at clinical onset of diabetes. We also tested whether HHV-8 was able to infect human pancreatic beta cells in culture in vitro. The study was conducted at Saint-Louis University Hospital, Paris, France, from January 2004 to July 2005. All participants were black and of African origin: 187 were consecutive diabetic patients of whom 81 had ketosis-prone DM-2 and 106 had nonketotic DM-2, and 90 individuals were nondiabetic control participants who were matched for age and sex. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Seroprevalence of HHV-8 and percentage of patients with HHV-8 viremia at onset in ketosis-prone DM-2. RESULTS: HHV-8 antibodies were found in 71 patients (87.7%) with ketosis-prone DM-2 vs 16 patients (15.1%) with nonketotic DM-2 (odds ratio, 39.9; 95% confidence interval, 17.1-93.4; P &lt; .001) and 36 of the control participants (40.0%) (odds ratio, 10.7; 95% confidence interval, 4.9-23.4; P &lt; .001). HHV-8 in genomic DNA was present in 6 of 13 patients with ketosis-prone DM-2 tested at acute onset and in 0 of 9 patients with nonketotic DM-2. HHV-8 proteins were present in human islet cells that were cultured for 4 days in the presence of HHV-8. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary cross-sectional study, the presence of HHV-8 antibodies was associated with ketosis-prone DM-2 in patients of sub-Saharan African origin.

18515794,"Early childhood infection by human herpesvirus 8 in Zambia and the role of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 coinfection in a highly endemic area.Kaposi's sarcoma occurs at high incidence among Zambian adults and children, but there is a paucity of data on human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) incidence and routes of infection, especially in children. Between 1998 and 2004, the authors conducted a prospective study of viral transmission in a cohort of 684 children in Lusaka, Zambia, to estimate the annual incidence of HHV-8 from birth through 48 months of age. Maternal and pediatric human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) infection status was also determined. The results, based on 1,532 child-years of follow-up, showed that HHV-8 seroconversion occurs early in life. The incidence rate of HHV-8 seroconversion was 13.8 infections per 100 child-years by 48 months of age. HIV-1-infected children were at substantially higher risk for HHV-8 seroconversion (adjusted hazard ratio = 4.60, 95% confidence interval: 2.93, 7.22). Maternal HIV-1 and HHV-8 infection status were not independently associated with risk of HHV-8 seroconversion in the child. HHV-8 antibody titers in children followed at all consecutive time points revealed sero-reversion of HHV-8 antibodies, with undetectable titers in some children at one or more time points after seroconversion. These results demonstrate that cross-sectional serologic screening probably underestimates true HHV-8 seroprevalence in young Zambian children because of fluctuations in detectable antibody titers.",M1

The results of most current serological assays for the detection of HHV-8-specific antibodies have low levels of concordance among themselves. To establish a sensitive and specific testing strategy that can be used to screen for HHV-8-specific antibodies, three HHV-8 proteins, ORF65, ORF73, and K8.1A, were expressed by using baculoviral vectors in insect cells and incorporated into a monoclonal antibody-enhanced immunofluorescence assay (mIFA) termed the Sf9 three-antigen mIFA. The results obtained by this mIFA were compared to those obtained by a standard mIFA with an HHV-8-infected B-cell line (BC3 mIFA). Test sera were obtained from patients diagnosed with KS, human immunodeficiency virus type 1-infected patients at high risk for HHV-8 infection, and healthy controls from a local blood bank. The combined use of both assays had a sensitivity of 94% and a specificity of 96%.

METHODS: A panel of retinoic acid compounds were tested for their antiviral activity against HHV-8 in human umbilical vascular endothelial cells (HUVECs) and in a human epithelial cell line. The presence, transcription and antigen expression of HHV-8 in infected cells - in the presence or absence of retinoic acid compounds - were evaluated by PCR, reverse transcriptase PCR and immunofluorescence assays; HHV-8 viral load was determined by real-time quantitative PCR. Angiogenesis induced by HHV-8 was also assessed using Cultrex basement membrane extract. RESULTS: The compounds tested specifically inhibited viral promoters, during the early and late phases of infection in both cell systems tested, and resulted in up to 100-fold reduction of viral titre and release of progeny virus. The inhibition of viral replication induced by retinoids in endothelial cells, the primary target of HHV-8-driven transformation in Kaposi's Sarcoma, prevented endothelial cells from developing spindle morphology and in vitro tube formation, characteristic changes associated with HHV-8 infection and transformation. CONCLUSIONS: We show that retinoids inhibit HHV-8 replication and identify new retinoid compounds with a strong antiviral effect. Selective retinoids, particularly those with retinoic acid receptor agonist activity, may be good candidates for the development of antiviral drugs.",M1
18434408,"Autocrine and paracrine promotion of cell survival and virus replication by human herpesvirus 8 chemokines.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>), which is associated with the endothelial tumor Kaposi's sarcoma, encodes three CC/beta-chemokines. These are expressed early during productive (lytic) infection and are believed to be involved in immune evasion, in addition to viral pathogenesis via induction of angiogenic cytokines. Here we report that two of the HHV-8 chemokines, CCR8 agonists vCCL-1 and vCCL-2, have direct effects on endothelial survival and virus replication. The v-chemokines stimulated virus replication when added to infected cultures exogenously, and CCR8 knockdown absent v-chemokine supplementation inhibited virus production, indicative of autocrine effects of endogenously produced vCCLs. This was verified and proreplication functions of each chemokine were demonstrated via shRNA-mediated vCCL depletion. The v-chemokines inhibited expression of lytic cycle-induced proapoptotic protein Bim, RNA interference-mediated suppression of which mimicked v-chemokine proreplication functions. Our data show for the first time that the v-chemokines have direct effects on virus biology, independently of their postulated immune evasion functions, and suggest that in vivo the v-chemokines might play direct roles in Kaposi's sarcomagenesis via paracrine prosurvival signaling.",M1
18408447,"[Prolonged survival in a patient with human herpesvirus-8-negative primary effusion lymphoma after combination chemotherapy with rituximab]Primary effusion lymphoma (PEL) is a unique clinicopathological entity usually associated with human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) infection. It occurs almost exclusively in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected individuals. We presented a rare case of HIV-negative PEL in an elderly HHV-8-negative patient who developed cardiac tamponade due to pericardial effusion. The patient was treated with rituximab and cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine and prednisolone (CHOP). This disease generally has a poor prognosis; however, this patient achieved complete remission and remains without signs of disease 30 months after the last treatment. Because most HIV-negative and HHV-8- negative PEL cases show pan-B-cell markers, there is considerable usage of rituximab, though its optimal usage for PEL is unclear. To the best of our knowledge, there have been five reported cases where rituximab treatment has been used against HIV-negative and HHV-8-negative PEL. The clinical courses of these cases were relatively good without specific adverse effects. HIV-negative and HHV-8-negative PEL appears to be a reasonably new clinicopathological entity. While further investigation will of course be needed, the use of rituximab is worth considering for treatment of such patients.",M1
18394276,"Seroprevalence and risk factors for human herpesvirus 8 infection, rural Egypt.To determine whether human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is associated with schistosomal and hepatitis C virus infections in Egypt, we surveyed 965 rural household participants who had been tested for HHV-8 and schistosomal infection (seroprevalence 14.2% and 68.6%, respectively, among those &lt;15 years of age, and 24.2% and 72.8%, respectively, among those &gt; or =15 years of age). Among adults, HHV-8 seropositivity was associated with higher age, lower education, dental treatment, tattoos, &gt; or =10 lifetime injections, and hepatitis C virus seropositivity. In adjusted analyses, HHV-8 seropositivity was associated with dental treatment among men (odds ratio [OR] 2.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.1-5.2) and hepatitis C virus seropositivity among women (OR 3.3, 95% CI 1.4-7.9). HHV-8 association with antischistosomal antibodies was not significant for men (OR 2.1, 95% CI 0.3-16.4), but marginal for women (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.0-2.5).

18339579,"High prevalence of Human Herpes Virus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) in patients with Warthin's tumors of the salivary gland.BACKGROUND: Warthin's tumor is a common benign neoplasm of the salivary gland. Human Herpes Virus 8 (HHV-8) is the etiologic agent for all forms of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and HHV-8 DNA is present in saliva, suggesting that non-sexual transmission is associated with latent infection of the salivary gland. OBJECTIVES: To provide insights into the HHV-8 cell tropism, the presence of HHV-8 was investigated in a series of Warthin's tumors of the salivary gland and corresponding adjacent normal tissue. STUDY DESIGN: Forty-three patients with Warthin's tumors (cystadenolymphoma) were tested for the presence of HHV-8 DNA, and corresponding adjacent normal tissue samples were obtained from 15 patients. DNA was extracted from the paraffin-embedded tissues. A nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay was applied, and the positive samples were confirmed by direct sequencing. RESULTS: HHV-8 DNA was detected in 19 out of 43 (44%) salivary gland tumor samples. Among the 15 cases with paired samples, 9 were HHV-8-positive for both samples, 4 were HHV-8-negative for both samples while in two cases HHV-8 was detected only in the tumor specimens. CONCLUSIONS: HHV-8 is frequently detected in adenoid salivary neoplasms, suggesting a significant role of the virus in the etiopathogenesis of the disease. Larger studies are required to investigate the role of HHV-8 in the development or progression of Warthin's tumors.",M1
18337571,"Human herpesvirus 8 infects and replicates in primary cultures of activated B lymphocytes through DC-SIGN.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma, primary effusion lymphoma, and some forms of multicentric Castleman's disease. Although latent HHV-8 DNA can be detected in B cells from persons with these cancers, there is little information on the replication of HHV-8 in B cells. Indeed, B cells are relatively resistant to HHV-8 infection in vitro. We have recently shown that DC-SIGN, a C-type lectin first identified on dendritic cells (DC), is an entry receptor for HHV-8 on DC and macrophages. We have also demonstrated previously that B lymphocytes from peripheral blood and tonsils express DC-SIGN and that this expression increases after B-cell activation. Here we show that activated blood and tonsillar B cells can be productively infected with HHV-8, as measured by an increase in viral DNA, the expression of viral lytic and latency proteins, and the production of infectious virus. The infection of B cells with HHV-8 was blocked by the pretreatment of the cells with antibody specific for DC-SIGN or with mannan but not antibody specific for xCT, a cystine/glutamate exchange transporter that has been implicated in HHV-8 fusion to cells. The infection of B cells with HHV-8 resulted in increased expression of DC-SIGN and a decrease in the expression of CD20 and major histocompatibility complex class I. HHV-8 could also infect and replicate in B-cell lines transduced to express full-length DC-SIGN but not in B-cell lines transduced to express DC-SIGN lacking the transmembrane domain, demonstrating that the entry of HHV-8 into B cells is related to DC-SIGN-mediated endocytosis. The role of endocytosis in viral entry into activated B cells was confirmed by blocking HHV-8 infection with endocytic pathway inhibitors. Thus, the expression of DC-SIGN is essential for productive HHV-8 infection of and replication in B cells.",M1

The new commercial CMV HHV-6, 7, 8 R-gene kit (Argene, Varilhes, France) for the simultaneous quantitation of HHV-6 and qualitative detection of HHV-7 and HHV-8 was evaluated using whole blood samples (respectively, n=175, 100 and 161) and using different extraction and real-time PCR platforms in two Centers A and B. In comparison with HHV-6 in-house real-time PCR the commercial kit showed agreements of 96% (n=75) and 85% (n=100) in A and B, respectively, with significant Spearman's correlation between both techniques (in A: r=0.97 [p&lt;0.001]; in B: r=0.70 [p&lt;0.001]). The Bland-Altman test results and prospective monitoring of patients confirmed the accuracy of these HHV-6 real-time PCR techniques. The agreement between the in-house HHV-7 PCR and commercial kit was of 86% (n=100). In comparison with in-house HHV-8 real-time PCRs, the commercial kit showed agreements of 100% (n=61) and 93.7% (n=96) in A and B, respectively. These results demonstrate that the new commercial CMV HHV-6, 7, 8 R-gene kit was an efficient and reliable tool for the diagnosis of herpesvirus 6, 7, 8 infections.",M1
18292568,"Gamma delta+ T cells involvement in viral immune control of chronic human herpesvirus 8 infection.Little is known about what effector populations are associated with the control of human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) infection in vivo. We compared T lymphocyte subsets among HIV-HHV-8+ and HIV-HHV-8- infected human individuals. alphabeta+ T cells from HHV-8-infected individuals displayed a significantly higher percentage of differentiated effector cells among both CD4+ and CD8+ T cell subsets. HHV-8 infection was associated with significant expansion of gammadelta+ Vdelta1 T cells expressing a differentiated effector cell phenotype in peripheral blood. In vitro stimulation of PBMC from HHV-8-infected individuals with either infectious viral particles or different HHV-8 viral proteins resulted in gammadelta Vdelta1 T cell activation. In addition, gammadelta Vdelta1 T cells displayed a strong reactivity against HHV-8-infected cell lines and prevented the release of infectious viral particles following the induction of lyric replication. These data indicate that gammadelta T cells play a role in both innate and adaptive T cell responses against HHV-8 in immunocompetent individuals.",M1
18261181,"Human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>)-associated primary effusion lymphoma in two renal transplant recipients receiving rapamycin.The Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling cascade has been demonstrated to be constitutively activated in several malignancies, including Kaposi sarcoma (KS) and human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8)-associated primary effusion lymphoma (PEL). In organ transplant recipients, therapeutic change from cyclosporin to the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin can lead to regression of KS lesions. Recent experiments using PEL cell lines and murine xenograft PEL models suggested that rapamycin could inhibit the growth of PEL cells. In the present report, we describe the cases of two HIV-1-negative males of African origin who underwent renal transplantation and developed PEL while receiving rapamycin as immunosuppressive treatment. Both patients were retrospectively found to be HHV-8 seropositive before renal transplantation. The present case report suggests that rapamycin may not protect HHV-8-infected renal transplant recipients from occurrence of PEL or progression of pre-existing PEL.",M1
18216089,"Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus transactivator RTA promotes degradation of the repressors to regulate viral lytic replication.Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus/human herpesvirus 8 (KSHV/<e>HHV-8</e>) RTA is an important protein involved in the induction of KSHV lytic replication from latency through activation of the lytic cascade. A number of cellular and viral proteins, including K-RBP, have been found to repress RTA-mediated transactivation and KSHV lytic replication. However, it is unclear as to how RTA overcomes the suppression during lytic reactivation. In this study, we found that RTA can induce K-RBP degradation through the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway and that two regions in RTA are responsible. Moreover, we found that RTA can promote the degradation of several other RTA repressors. RTA mutants that are defective in inducing K-RBP degradation cannot activate RTA responsive promoter as efficiently as wild-type RTA. Interference of the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway affected RTA-mediated transactivation and KSHV reactivation from latency. Our results suggest that KSHV RTA can stimulate the turnover of repressors to modulate viral reactivation. Since herpes simplex virus type 1 transactivator ICP0 and human cytomegalovirus transactivator pp71 also stimulate the degradation of cellular silencers, it is possible that the promotion of silencer degradation by viral transactivators may be a common mechanism for regulating the lytic replication of herpesviruses.",M1
18211958,"vFLIP from KSHV inhibits anoikis of primary endothelial cells.Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV or <e>HHV-8</e>) infection of endothelial cells is an early event in the aetiology of the endothelial cell tumour Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). We have examined the effect of the KSHV latent protein viral FLICE-like inhibitory protein (vFLIP) on dermal microvascular endothelial cell (MVEC) survival as vFLIP is expressed in the KSHV-infected cells within KS lesions. To do this, we have used a lentiviral vector to express vFLIP in MVECs in the absence of other KSHV proteins. vFLIP activates the classical NF-kappaB pathway in MVECs and causes nuclear translocation of RelA/p65. This NF-kappaB activation prevents detachment-induced apoptosis (anoikis) of MVECs but does not inhibit apoptosis induced by removal of essential survival factors, including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). vFLIP expression inhibits anoikis in part by inducing the secretion of an additional paracrine survival factor(s). The implications of these results for KS development are discussed.",M1

Hemodialysis has not yet been demonstrated to be a route of virus transmission/acquisition, although recently blood transfusion has been suggested as a vehicle of HHV-8 transmission. The present study searching HHV-8 antibodies among serum samples from 70 hemodialysis patients disclosed a high prevalence of infection (22.9%).

18077714,"Intracellular localization map of human herpesvirus 8 proteins.Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is the etiological agent of Kaposi's sarcoma. We present a localization map of 85 HHV-8-encoded proteins in mammalian cells. Viral open reading frames were cloned with a Myc tag in expression plasmids, confirmed by full-length sequencing, and expressed in HeLa cells. Protein localizations were analyzed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Fifty-one percent of all proteins were localized in the cytoplasm, 22% were in the nucleus, and 27% were found in both compartments. Surprisingly, we detected viral FLIP (v-FLIP) in the nucleus and in the cytoplasm, whereas cellular FLIPs are generally localized exclusively in the cytoplasm. This suggested that v-FLIP may exert additional or alternative functions compared to cellular FLIPs. In addition, it has been shown recently that the K10 protein can bind to at least 15 different HHV-8 proteins. We noticed that K10 and only five of its 15 putative binding factors were localized in the nucleus when the proteins were expressed in HeLa cells individually. Interestingly, in coexpression experiments K10 colocalized with 87% (13 of 15) of its putative binding partners. Colocalization was induced by translocation of either K10 alone or both proteins. These results indicate active intracellular translocation processes in virus-infected cells. Specifically in this framework, the localization map may provide a useful reference to further elucidate the function of HHV-8-encoded genes in human diseases.",M1
18054964,"Desensitization of herpesvirus-encoded G protein-coupled receptors.Members of the herpesvirus family, including human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV/<e>HHV-8</e>), encode G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) homologs, which strongly activate classical G protein signal transduction networks within the cell. In animal models of herpesvirus infection, the viral GPCRs appear to play physiologically important roles by enabling viral replication within tropic tissues and by promoting reactivation from latency. While a number of studies have defined intracellular signaling pathways activated by herpesviral GPCRs, it remains unclear if their physiological function is subjected to the process of desensitization as observed for cellular GPCRs. G protein-coupled receptor kinases (GRK) and arrestin proteins have been recently implicated in regulating viral GPCR signaling; however, the role that these desensitization proteins play in viral GPCR function in vivo remains unknown. Here, we review what is currently known regarding viral GPCR desensitization and discuss potential biological ramifications of viral GPCR regulation by the host cell desensitization machinery.",M1
18053246,"Incidence of human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) infection among HIV-uninfected individuals at high risk for sexually transmitted infections.BACKGROUND: The occurrence of, and risk factors for, HHV-8 infection have yet to be definitively determined, particularly among heterosexual individuals with at-risk behavior for sexually transmitted infections (STI). The objective of this study was to estimate the incidence and determinants of HHV-8 infection among HIV-uninfected individuals repeatedly attending an urban STI clinic. METHODS: Sera from consecutive HIV-uninfected individuals repeatedly tested for HIV-1 antibodies were additionally tested for HHV-8 antibodies using an immunofluorescence assay. To identify determinants of HHV-8 infection, a nested case-control study and multivariate logistic regression analysis were performed. RESULTS: Sera from 456 HIV-uninfected individuals (224 multiple-partner heterosexuals and 232 men who have sex with men (MSM]) were identified for inclusion in the study. The HHV-8 seroprevalence at enrollment was 9.4% (21/224; 95% C.I.: 6.0-14.2%) among heterosexuals with multiple partners and 22.0% (51/232; 95% C.I.: 16.9-28.0%) among MSM. Among the 203 multiple-partner heterosexuals and 181 MSM who were initially HHV-8-negative, 17 (IR = 3.0/100 p-y, 95% C.I.: 1.9 - 4.8) and 21 (IR = 3.3/100 p-y, 95% C.I:.2.1 - 5.1) seroconversions occurred, respectively. HHV-8 seroconversion tended to be associated with a high number of sexual partners during the follow-up among MSM (&gt; 10 partners: AOR = 3.32 95% CI:0.89-12.46) and among the multiple-partner heterosexuals (&gt; 10 partner; AOR = 3.46, 95% CI:0.42-28.2). Moreover, among MSM, HHV-8 seroconversion tended to be associated with STI (AOR = 1.80 95%CI: 0.52-7.96). During the study period the HIV-1 incidence was lower than that of HHV-8 among both groups (0.89/100 p-y among MSM and 0.95/100 p-y among multiple-partner heterosexuals). CONCLUSION: The large difference between the incidence of HHV-8 and the incidence of HIV-1 and other STIs may suggest that the circulation of HHV-8 is sustained by practices other than classical at-risk sexual behavior.",M1

Primary infection with EBV, in otherwise healthy subjects, causes a benign lymphoproliferative syndrome, the mononucleosis syndrome. However, several epidemiologic and biologic studies have shown a pathogenetic role of EBV in the development of human B cell lymphomas, both in immunocompetent and in immunosuppressed individuals. HHV-8 is the necessary etiologic agent of a lymph vascular tumor, the Kaposi sarcoma, but it is also implicated in the pathogenesis of rare B cell lymphoproliferative disorders, mainly occurring in the setting of immunosuppression. The aim of this review is to provide an updated description of the different strategies used by these two herpesviruses to influence B cell fate decisions. Both EBV and HHV-8 have evolved specific mechanisms in order to: (1) interact with the B cell developmental machinery; (2) allow infected B cells to escape from the control of the immune system; (3) affect the B cell cycle checkpoints; (4) mimic and influence B cellular proliferation and differentiation pathways. Understanding the mechanisms of herpesvirus induced B cell lymphoproliferation will provide the basis for novel treatment approaches in patients with EBV and HHV-8 related lymphomas.",M1

To determine the role of immune responses in MCD, we studied the frequency, antigenic repertoire, differentiation, and functional profile of HHV-8-specific CD8(+) T cells in MCD patients and in human immunodeficiency virus-coinfected asymptomatic HHV-8 carriers (AC). Screening CD8(+) T-cell responses with ELISpot interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) assays using 56 peptides on 6 latent and lytic HHV-8 proteins showed that MCD and AC patients had responses of similar magnitude and antigenic repertoire and identified a new 10-mer human leukocyte antigen B7 CD8 epitope in K15. Intracellular IFN-gamma staining showed significantly more CD45RA(-)CCR7(-)CD27(-) CD8(+)IFN-gamma(+) cells (late phenotype) and significantly fewer CCR7(-)CD27(+)CD45RA(-) cells (early and intermediate phenotype) in MCD than in AC patients. This phenotypic shift was not found for Epstein-Barr virus-specific CD8(+) T cells tested as controls. HHV-8 viral loads were negatively correlated with early and intermediate effector memory cells. HHV-8-specific T cells were polyfunctional (secretion of IFN-gamma, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, macrophage inflammatory protein-1beta, and/or CD107a) in both MCD and AC patients. In conclusion, MCD is not associated with a lack of HHV-8-specific CD8(+) T cells or limitation of their functional profile. Their differentiation increases with HHV-8 viral load. These results offer new insight into the pathophysiology of MCD.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty patients operated on because of laryngeal carcinoma were included in the study. Forty-seven had squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) whereas three had verrucous carcinoma. Fresh tumoral tissues, or tumoral tissues obtained from archival paraffin-embedded blocks, were examined. HHV-8 DNA and HPV DNA were detected using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and viral genotypes of HPV were determined via the hybrid capture method. The presence of HHV-8 DNA and HPV DNA were also investigated in normal appearing laryngeal tissue collected from 50 cadavers at autopsy. RESULTS: HPV DNA was detected in seven patients (7/50; 14%) (5 out of 47 patients with SCC (5/47; 10.6%) and two out of three patients with verrucous carcinoma). HHV-8 DNA was detected in five patients and they all had SCC (5/47; 10.6%). One case had both HHV-8 and HPV DNA. None of the control samples from cadavers harbored HHV-8 DNA, or HPV DNA. There was a statistically significant correlation between HHV-8 DNA and HPV DNA positivity and laryngeal SCC (Fisher exact test; p=0.023 for each). No statistically significant correlations were found between the presence of HHV-8 and/or HPV and age, gender, tumor stage, differentiation, the site of the tumor, smoking and alcohol use. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that beside HPV, HHV-8 might have a role in laryngeal carcinogenesis. Further investigations are necessary to clarify the exact role of these viruses in laryngeal carcinoma.",M1

Here, we report that exposure to Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) of human dendritic cell (DC) monocyte precursors resulted in impaired immature DC (iDC) formation as indicated by a reduced CD1a expression. In accordance, the immunostimulatory ability of such iDC was significantly reduced, as indicated by mixed lymphocyte culture (MLR) assays. The immunostimulatory functions of DCs were similarly inhibited by the UV inactivated viral stocks, suggesting that the virus binding is sufficient to determine the observed effect. Furthermore, HHV8 mediated inhibition of the DC allostimulatory function was present in lipopolysaccharide (LPS) matured DCs. A strong reduction of the expression of the costimulatory molecule CD80 on the surface of the virus-exposed cells was observed as well. Impairment of dendritic cell development and function might represent an important strategy used by HHV-8 to escape from the host defense mechanisms.",M1

METHODS: Pathological specimens were obtained from 33 patients with MTLE undergone temporal lobectomy with amygdalo-hippocampectomy due to intractable seizures. Autopsy materials from the hippocampus of 7 patients without neurological disease were used as controls. The data was also correlated with the clinical history of patients including febrile convulsions, age, and history of CNS infections. Real-time polymerase chain reaction method was performed for detection of DNAs of these viruses. RESULTS: HHV-6, HSV-1 and HHV-8 were detected in the hippocampus of 3, 2 and 1 patients with MTLE respectively. None of the hippocampus of patients with MTLE was positive for DNA of HSV-2 and/or CMV. Three patients with positive HHV-6 DNAs had febrile convulsions and family history for epilepsy. None of our control specimens showed PCR positivity to any of the 5 tested viruses. CONCLUSIONS: Our study is the first to report the presence of HHV-8 viral genome in the brain tissue of patient with MTLE.

Two HIV positive mothers were co-infected by HHV-8 and one by HBV. Among the 5 HIV infected, one mother (20.0%) was HBV positive and two (40.0%) HHV-8 positive. Although we did not have a large sample which would show large prÃ©lalences of the infections, we could put forward that the Co-infection of the HIV with one of these viruses (HBV or HHV-8) could favorite the mother-to-child transmission.",M1
17721201,"<e>HHV-8</e>+, EBV+ multicentric plasmablastic microlymphoma in an HIV+ Man: the spectrum of HHV-8+ lymphoproliferative disorders expands.Human herpesvirus-8 (HHV-8) is associated with several distinct lymphoproliferative disorders: primary effusion lymphoma, multicentric Castleman disease (MCD), MCD-associated plasmablastic lymphoma and HHV-8+, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)+ germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder. We report the case of a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)+ male with fever, generalized lymphadenopathy, and splenomegaly. Two peripheral lymph nodes were excised and showed features of MCD and a prominent proliferation of HHV-8+, EBV+, CD20, CD138, MUM1+, lambda dim+, Ig heavy chain plasmablasts and immunoblasts replacing some follicles. Subsequently, a splenectomy and biopsy of retroperitoneal lymph nodes were performed; the retroperitoneal and splenic hilar lymph nodes showed changes similar to those in the peripheral lymph nodes while the markedly enlarged spleen showed replacement of occasional white pulp by the HHV-8+, EBV+ large cells. The histologic features and coinfection by EBV and HHV-8 suggested a diagnosis of HHV-8+ germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder. However, the occurrence in an HIV+ individual, the background of MCD, the widespread anatomic distribution and the aggressive clinical course tended to exclude germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder, and to favor multifocal plasmablastic microlymphoma. The patient died shortly after surgery; postmortem examination showed progression to overt lymphoma. The marrow showed extensive hemophagocytosis, consistent with development of a hemophagocytic syndrome. This unique case has clinical features compatible with a MCD-associated plasmablastic lymphoproliferative disorder, with pathologic features intermediate between HHV-8+ plasmablastic microlymphoma, and HHV-8+ germinotropic lymphoproliferative disorder, although in contrast to both of these, in our case, light chain expression was dim and heavy chain was not detected.",M1
17721185,"Epstein-Barr virus negative clonal plasma cell proliferations and lymphomas in peripheral T-cell lymphomas: a phenomenon with distinctive clinicopathologic features.Clonal B-cell populations have been described in peripheral T-cell lymphomas (PTCL) as secondary Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) driven B-cell expansions that may evolve to an overt B-cell lymphoma. EBV-negative B-cell proliferations associated with T-cell lymphomas are uncommon and not well characterized. We studied 15 patients who developed an EBV-negative B-cell proliferation or malignant lymphoma associated with PTCL. The T-cell tumors were 8 PTCL, not otherwise specified, 4 angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphomas, and 3 cutaneous PTCL. The B-cell component was intermingled with the PTCL in all patients and it was classified as clonal/monotypic plasma cell proliferation in 8 lesions, clonal/monotypic large B-cell proliferation in 4 patients, and B-cell lymphoma with plasmacytic/plasmablastic differentiation in 3 patients. Two patients had 2 clonally unrelated plasma cell proliferations associated with the same PTCL. All cases showed cytoplasmic Ig light chain restriction. Clonal IgH and T-cell receptor rearrangements were detected in 11/12 and 11/13 cases examined, respectively. EBV, cytomegalovirus, and <e>HHV-8</e> were not observed in any of the examined cases. Sequential samples in 7 patients showed persistence of the PTCL and the B-cell component in 4, the PTCL without the B-cell lymphoma in 2, and progression of the B-cell neoplasm in 1. Patients followed an aggressive clinical course similar to conventional PTCL. In conclusion, EBV-negative clonal or mononotypic B-cell proliferations in patients with PTCL present with a spectrum of lesions ranging from plasma cell proliferations to overt lymphomas with plasmacytic/plasmablastic features. The distinctive features of these patients suggest that these lesions represent a specific phenomenon in PTCL.",M1
17705167,"High diversity of <e>HHV-8</e> molecular subtypes in the Amazon region of Brazil: evidence of an ancient human infection.The present study describes the molecular epidemiology of Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) among four Indian tribes (Kararao, Arara Laranjal, Tiriyo, and Zo'e) of the Amazon region of Brazil and a group of HIV-1-infected subjects from the urban population of Belem, Para. Infection was characterized by the presence of antibodies using ELISA (measuring antibodies to ORF59, ORF65, K8.1A, K8.1B, and ORF73), and molecular assays (gene amplification of the regions ORF26 and the variable region VR1). Antibodies to HHV-8 were detected in 66 samples of the 221 Brazilian Amerindians, namely, 6 (25%) in the Kararao, 18 (19.6%) in the Arara Laranjal, 24 (42.9%) in the Tiriyo, and 18 (36.7%) in the Zo'e. Among the 477 HIV-1-infected subjects, antibodies to HHV-8 were present in 74 (15.5%) persons. The ORF26 region was amplified in seven samples, one of the Arara Laranjal, one of the Tiriyo, two of the Zo'e, and three of the HIV-1-infected group. Subtyping of HHV-8 described a high multiplicity of molecular subtypes, including C (Zo'e), E (Tiriyo), and B (HIV-1 infected). Serological results confirm the high prevalence of HHV-8 among Amerindians and the presence of three subtypes in the Amazon region of Brazil, including a unique subtype, which favors the idea of HHV-8 as an ancient human infection within this particular geographical region.",M1
17703414,"Human herpesvirus-8 infection and oral shedding in Amerindian and non-Amerindian populations in the Brazilian Amazon region.BACKGROUND: Human herpesvirus type 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) is hyperendemic in Amerindian populations, but its modes of transmission are unknown. METHODS: Antibodies against either HHV-8 lytic antigen or HHV-8 latency-associated nuclear antigen (LANA) were detected, by immunofluorescence assays, in 339 Amerindians and 181 non-Amerindians from the Brazilian Amazon. Serological markers of oro-fecal (hepatitis A), parenteral (hepatitis B and C), and sexual (herpes simplex virus type 2 and syphilis) transmission were measured by specific ELISAs. Salivary HHV-8 DNA was detected by use of a nested polymerase chain reaction assay and was sequenced. RESULTS: Antibodies against either lytic antigen or LANA were detected in 79.1% of Amerindians and in 6.1% of non-Amerindians (adjusted seroprevalence ratio [SR], 12.63 [95% confidence interval {CI}, 7.1-22.4]; P&lt;.0001). HHV-8 seroprevalence increased with age among Amerindians (P(Trend) &lt; .001) and already had high prevalence in childhood but was not sex specific in either population. The 2 populations did not differ in seroprevalence of oro-fecal or parenteral markers, but seroprevalence of markers of sexual transmission was lower among Amerindians. HHV-8 DNA in saliva was detected in 47 (23.7%) of 198 HHV-8 seropositive Amerindians. Detection of HHV-8 DNA decreased with age (P(Trend) &lt; .04) and was more common in men (SR, 2.14 [95% CI, 1.3-3.5]; P=.003). A total of 36 (76.6%) of the 47 saliva HHV-8 DNA samples were sequenced, and all clustered as subtype E. CONCLUSION: The data support the hypothesis of early acquisition and horizontal transmission, via saliva, of HHV-8 subtype E in Amerindian populations.",M1
17684131,"Plasma antibodies against Chlamydia trachomatis, human papillomavirus, and human herpesvirus type 8 in relation to prostate cancer: a prospective study.Traditionally, case-control studies of sexually transmitted infections and prostate cancer have focused on gonorrhea and syphilis, with overall positive associations. More recently, researchers have begun to expand their focus to include additional sexually transmitted infections, such as Chlamydia trachomatis, human papillomavirus (HPV), and human herpesvirus type 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) infections. Continuing this investigation, we examined each of these infections in relation to incident prostate cancer in a nested case-control study within the Health Professionals Follow-up Study. Prostate cancer cases were men diagnosed with prostate cancer between the date of blood draw (1993-1995) and 2000 (n = 691). Controls were men free of cancer and alive at the time of case diagnosis who had had at least one prostate-specific antigen test between the date of blood draw and case diagnosis. One control was individually matched to each case by age; year, time of day, and season of blood draw; and prostate-specific antigen screening history before blood draw (n = 691). C. trachomatis and HPV-16, HPV-18, and HPV-33 antibody serostatus were assessed by enzyme-based immunoassays and HHV-8 antibody serostatus was assessed by an immunofluorescence assay. No associations were observed between C. trachomatis [odds ratio (OR), 1.13; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 0.65-1.96], HPV-16 (OR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.57-1.23), HPV-18 (OR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.66-1.64), and HPV-33 (OR, 1.14; 95% CI, 0.76-1.72) antibody seropositivity and prostate cancer. A significant inverse association was observed between HHV-8 antibody seropositivity and prostate cancer (OR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.52-0.95). As this study is the first, to our knowledge, to observe such an inverse association, similar additional studies are warranted.",M1
17643094,"Absence of human herpesvirus-8 in pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor: immunohistochemical and molecular analysis of 20 cases.Inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors are uncommon lesions composed of spindled myofibroblasts within a variable background of collagen and inflammatory cells. Although the true nature of these lesions is not fully elucidated, identification of consistent cytogenetic alterations in the anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) gene suggests that they may be neoplastic. A small number of inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors have been reported to harbor human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>), implicating the virus in its pathogenesis. In this study, 20 cases of pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor were analyzed for the presence of HHV-8 with immunohistochemical and molecular methods. In all cases, antibodies to the latent nuclear antigen of the virus were applied. Four open reading frames (ORFs), including ORFs K2, 16, 26, and 72, were targeted utilizing real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The cohort included 9 men and 11 women with a mean age of 37 years (range, 1-81). Microscopically, the tumors were composed of cytologically bland spindle cells with myofibroblastic differentiation. On immunohistochemical studies, 20% of cases (4/20) demonstrated diffuse cytoplasmic positivity with ALK. Immunohistochemical staining for the latent nuclear protein of the virus was negative in all cases (0/20). All tumors (100%, 20/20) tested with real-time PCR were negative for all four ORFs, whereas 100% (10/10) of positive control Kaposi sarcoma cases were positive. Her2 gene expression was present in all (20/20) inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors confirming the presence of amplifiable deoxyribonucleic acid in the tissue lysate. This study documents the absence of HHV-8 in pulmonary inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors, suggesting that further investigation is required to clarify the pathogenesis of this lesion.",M1
17627235,"Estimation of human herpesvirus 8 prevalence in high-risk patients by analysis of humoral and cellular immunity.BACKGROUND: Immunocompromized individuals, such as patients with end-stage renal disease, transplant recipients, and HIV-infected patients, are at increased risk of acquiring human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 associated infectious complications. The prevalence of <e>HHV-8</e> infection generally is determined by detection of immunoglobulin G. However, because serological assays differ greatly, estimations on the actual HHV-8 prevalence vary considerably. METHODS: HHV-8-specific cellular and humoral immunity were analyzed in 128 controls, 73 patients on dialysis, 67 transplant recipients, and 69 HIV-infected patients with the use of flow cytometry and indirect immunofluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: A higher seroprevalence (from 13.7% to 44.9%) was confirmed for all groups of immunocompromised individuals as compared with healthy controls (3.9%). Among immunocompetent individuals, as little as 12.5% had HHV-8 reactive T-cell frequencies greater than the detection limit. In line with a higher seroprevalence in immunosuppressed patients, HHV-8-specific T cells were detectable in 30.1% of dialysis patients, 20.9% of transplant recipients, and 24.6% of HIV-infected individuals. When combining the individual presence of either HHV-8-specific antibodies or T cells or both, the prevalence of HHV-8 infection approached 15.6% in healthy individuals and 41.1%, 40.3%, and 55.1% in dialysis patients, transplant recipients, and HIV-infected individuals, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The exclusive serological analysis considerably underestimates the prevalence of HHV-8 infection in all study groups. Thus, the combined quantitation of both humoral and cellular immunity may instead be a superior method to assign the individual HHV-8 status. Moreover, this study suggests that the relative contributions of humoral and cellular immunity in control of HHV-8 may be different depending on the type of immunodeficiency.",M1
19712456,"Proteomic characterization of HIV-modulated membrane receptors, kinases and signaling proteins involved in novel angiogenic pathways.BACKGROUND: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), hemangioma, and other angioproliferative diseases are highly prevalent in HIV-infected individuals. While KS is etiologically linked to the human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV8</e>) infection, HIV-patients without HHV-8 and those infected with unrelated viruses also develop angiopathies. Further, HIV-Tat can activate protein-tyrosine-kinase (PTK-activity) of the vascular endothelial growth factor receptor involved in stimulating angiogenic processes. However, Tat by itself or HHV8-genes alone cannot induce angiogenesis in vivo unless specific proteins/enzymes are produced synchronously by different cell-types. We therefore tested a hypothesis that chronic HIV-replication in non-endothelial cells may produce novel factors that provoke angiogenic pathways. METHODS: Genome-wide proteins from HIV-infected and uninfected T-lymphocytes were tested by subtractive proteomics analyses at various stages of virus and cell growth in vitro over a period of two years. Several thousand differentially regulated proteins were identified by mass spectrometry (MS) and &gt;200 proteins were confirmed in multiple gels. Each protein was scrutinized extensively by protein-interaction-pathways, bioinformatics, and statistical analyses. RESULTS: By functional categorization, 31 proteins were identified to be associated with various signaling events involved in angiogenesis. 88% proteins were located in the plasma membrane or extracellular matrix and &gt;90% were found to be essential for regeneration, neovascularization and angiogenic processes during embryonic development. CONCLUSION: Chronic HIV-infection of T-cells produces membrane receptor-PTKs, serine-threonine kinases, growth factors, adhesion molecules and many diffusible signaling proteins that have not been previously reported in HIV-infected cells. Each protein has been associated with endothelial cell-growth, morphogenesis, sprouting, microvessel-formation and other biological processes involved in angiogenesis (p = 10-4 to 10-12). Bioinformatics analyses suggest that overproduction of PTKs and other kinases in HIV-infected cells has suppressed VEGF/VEGFR-PTK expression and promoted VEGFR-independent pathways. This unique mechanism is similar to that observed in neovascularization and angiogenesis during embryogenesis. Validation of clinically relevant proteins by gene-silencing and translational studies in vivo would identify specific targets that can be used for early diagnosis of angiogenic disorders and future development of inhibitors of angiopathies. This is the first comprehensive study to demonstrate that HIV-infection alone, without any co-infection or treatment, can induce numerous  embryonic  proteins and kinases capable of generating novel VEGF-independent angiogenic pathways.",M2
19255968,"[A case of Kaposi's sarcoma in the rapamycin era]We report a case of Kaposi's sarcoma in a patient who received a double kidney transplant in 2005. Immunosuppression was induced with rapamycin and antilymphocyte serum while maintenance therapy consisted of rapamycin, corticosteroids and mycophenolic acid. The patient developed delayed graft function but no rejection. In November 2006 and March 2007 two graft biopsies were taken because of a significant rise in serum creatinine; they revealed chronic allograft nephropathy and polyomavirus infection. Meanwhile a skin biopsy of the leg was performed to determine the nature of a discolored lesion. The morphohistological diagnosis was Kaposi's sarcoma. For this reason rapamycin was stopped and steroid treatment gradually reduced. Specific therapy with doxorubicin was started; radiological and endoscopic examination excluded disseminated disease while serological tests were positive for antibodies to <e>HHV-8</e>, a virus known to cause Kaposi's sarcoma. Unfortunately, withdrawal of antirejection therapy caused loss of the graft, so the patient had to start dialysis. In this report we stress the possible development of malignancy in transplanted patients who are given rapamycin. Rapamycin is known to be an antirejection drug and to have antineoplastic activity; the major risk of malignancy is probably related to immunosuppression rather than the type of drugs used to obtain it.",M2

We analyzed data prospectively collected from the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) between 1984 and 2002. Among the 1335 HIV- and HHV-8-coinfected white men, 401 KS cases were identified. Multivariable Cox regression models were used to estimate the effects of time-varying recreational drug use on KS risk adjusting for potential confounders. The effects of both recent use (6 months prior) of recreational drugs and lagged exposure (i.e., use from 3 and 5 years prior) were examined. We did not observe any clear association with KS for recent use of any of the four drugs. In the analyses using lagged exposures, KS risk was associated with use of poppers 3-5 years prior [hazard ratio (HR)(3 years prior) = 1.27, 95% CI (0.97-1.67), HR(5 years prior) = 1.46 (1.01-2.13)]. However, no clear dose-response relationship was observed. These findings do not support a biological association between use of these substances and KS development in HIV- and HHV-8-coinfected homosexual men.",M2
18958795,"Ultrastructure of Kaposi sarcoma.Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a complex disease with aspects of virology (human herpesvirus-8, <e>HHV-8</e>, and human immunodeficiency virus, HIV), immunology (immunodeficiency), hyperplasia (multiple widely spaced de novo lesions), and neoplasia (metastases) that has always been the most common AIDS-defining malignancy. The lesional spindle cell has been classified as being derived from either blood vascular or, more recently, lymphatic endothelial cell origin. This study revealed a spectrum of endothelial cell ultrastructure from lymphatic to blood vascular. It demonstrated frequent Weibel-Palade bodies and gap junctions. The spindle cells were shown to behave as facultative phagocytes, internalizing and processing necrotic cells and leaked red blood cells (RBCs). Fragmented RBCs were equivalent to the  hyaline droplets  seen by light microscopy. The final stages of RBC disintegration were hemosiderin and ferritin. Most significantly, this study disclosed that KS is actually composed of a single type of randomly oriented spindle cell forming vessels of varying size and integrity.",M2
18836096,"The role of Ephs, Ephrins, and growth factors in Kaposi sarcoma and implications of EphrinB2 blockade.Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is associated with human herpesvirus <e>(HHV)-8</e> and is dependent on the induction of vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs). VEGF regulates genes that provide arterial or venous identity to endothelial cells, such as the induction of EphrinB2, which phenotypically defines arterial endothelial cells and pericytes, and represses EphB4, which defines venous endothelial cells. We conducted a comprehensive analysis of the Eph receptor tyrosine kinases to determine which members are expressed and therefore contribute to KS pathogenesis. We demonstrated limited Eph/Ephrin expression; notably, the only ligand highly expressed is EphrinB2. We next studied the biologic effects of blocking EphrinB2 using the extracellular domain of EphB4 fused with human serum albumin (sEphB4-HSA). sEphB4-HSA inhibited migration and invasion of the KS cells in vitro in response to various growth factors. Finally, we determined the biologic effects of combining sEphB4-HSA and an antibody to VEGF. sEphB4-HSA was more active than the VEGF antibody, and combination of the 2 had at least additive activity. sEphB4-HSA reduced blood vessel density, pericyte recruitment, vessel perfusion, and increased hypoxia, with an associated increase in VEGF and DLL4 expression. The combination of sEphB4-HSA and VEGF antibody is a rational treatment combination for further investigation.",M2

18494611,"Gastrointestinal Kaposi's sarcoma: CD117 expression and the potential for misdiagnosis as gastrointestinal stromal tumour.AIMS: Gastrointestinal Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) may mimic gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GISTs) histologically. Studies have shown that KS outside the gastrointestinal (GI) tract may express CD117, an antibody usually used to support a diagnosis of GIST. The aim was to evaluate the clinicopathological features of GI KS, including the expression of CD117 with and without antigen retrieval. METHODS AND RESULTS: Fourteen GI KS were assessed histologically, 12 of which were also subjected to immunohistochemistry for CD34, human herpesvirus (HHV) 8, DOG1 and CD117. CD117 immunohistochemistry was performed with and without antigen retrieval. All cases showed an infiltrative spindle cell tumour. Lamina propria infiltration, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, extravasated red blood cells and haemosiderin were typical histological features. In all cases tumour cells were positive for CD34 and <e>HHV8</e>, but negative for DOG1. CD117 was positive in four of 12 cases without antigen retrieval and 10 of 12 cases with antigen retrieval. CONCLUSIONS: The microscopic distinction of GI KS from GIST can be difficult. Clues that raise the possibility of GI KS include young patient age, a history of immunosuppression, lamina propria infiltration, lymphoplasmacytic inflammation, extravasated red blood cells and haemosiderin deposition. Use of the immunomarkers CD117 (without antigen retrieval), HHV8 and DOG1 may aid in the distinction between GI KS and GIST.",M2

Here, we used retroviral transduction to generate vGPCR-expressing 3T3 fibroblasts that are tumorigenic in nude mice, but as expected fail to induce tumors in their immunocompetent counterparts. However, tumor fragments obtained from nude mice grow progressively in immunocompetent BALB/c mice. Unexpectedly, vGPCR-expressing cells established from grafted tumor fragments gave rise to tumors in immunocompetent mice. These tumors exhibit a striking histological resemblance to KS including plump spindle cell morphology, a high degree of vascularization and brisk mitotic activity. High expression of vGPCR was confirmed in the cell lines and tumors using a newly developed vGPCR-specific monoclonal antibody. Finally, short interfering RNA directed at vGPCR abrogated or significantly delayed tumorigenesis in mice, demonstrating that the tumor development is specifically driven by vGPCR. This novel model for vGPCR-mediated oncogenesis will contribute to our understanding of the role of vGPCR in the pathogenesis of HHV-8 and may even be important in identifying critical molecular and epigenetic changes during tumor progression in vivo.",M2

KS develops in recipients with pre-existing infection with human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>), the causative agent for KS, but it can also occur in recipients infected by donors. The relative importance of these sources of infection in recipients in the United States is unknown. We report recipient and donor characteristics associated with KS among transplant recipients in the United States. KS risk, after solid organ transplantation during 1993-2003, was analyzed using data from the Organ Procurement and Tissue Network. Associations were determined using proportional hazards regression. Sixtyfive KS cases were identified among 234,127 transplants (incidence 8.8 per 100,000 person-years). Most cases occurred in the first 2 years after transplantation (incidence 12.5 per 100,000 person-years). KS risk increased steadily with recipient age (p(trend) &lt; 0.001) and was associated with the recipient being male (HR 1.8, 95% CI, 1.0-3.2), Hispanic (2.1, 1.1-3.8) and a non-U.S. citizen (3.9, 1.8-8.6). Mismatch at the HLA-B locus, but not at HLA-A or HLA-DR loci, was associated with heightened risk (HR 3.6, 95%CI 1.1-11 for 1-2 vs. 0 HLA-B mismatches). KS was unrelated to donor characteristics and was not significantly related to use of specific antirejection medications. Our study found that KS incidence was low among transplant recipients in the United States, but it was associated with recipient age, sex and citizenship, perhaps reflecting pre-existing HHV-8 infection. The high KS risk immediately posttransplant and in persons with HLA-B mismatch highlights the role of immunosuppression and/or immune stimulation in KS pathogenesis.",M2
16793109,"Molecular epidemiology of the <e>HHV-8</e> K1 gene from Moroccan patients with Kaposi's sarcoma.The genetic variability of the human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) strains circulating in the populations living in the Maghreb region, an endemic area for HHV-8 and associated Kaposi's sarcoma, remains largely unknown. We have thus analyzed the genetic variation of the complete K1 gene of HHV-8 in a series of 35 viral strains, originating from 28 Moroccan patients with classic, AIDS-associated or iatrogenic Kaposi's sarcoma lesions. All but one of the 35 strains belonged to the large C molecular subtype. Furthermore, high genetic diversity within the C subtype was observed in the 35 sequenced HHV-8 K1 genes, with strains belonging to several and distinct subgroups highly supported from a phylogenetically viewpoint (e.g., C3, C7, C'' and C5). Considering these newly identified Moroccan viral strains in the context of 189 complete K1 genes, we were able to characterized, using the Simplot program, two main groups of recombinant chimeric K1 genes, either intertypic (C5) or intratypic (C7). In addition, the genetic characterization of the host maternal gene pool, through the analyses of mtDNA variation, did not provide evidence for any association between a particular human ethno-geographic background (i.e., North African vs. sub-Saharan African vs. West Eurasian linages) and any HHV-8 strain because both C' and C'' strains were randomly distributed among the different patients' population backgrounds.",M2
16778423,"Posttransplant Kaposi's sarcoma restricted to the site of a previous deep venous thrombosis: abrupt onset after withdrawal of sirolimus.Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is an angioproliferative neoplasia associated with human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) infection. HHV-8 generates KS by means of the secretion of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) andup-regulation of VEGF receptor, KDR, in endothelial cells. We report a case of KS in a 72-year-old male with a renal transplant who had received immunosuppressant drugs including sirolimus, mycophenolate mofetil, tacrolimus and steroids. KS developed 11 months after transplantation, in relation to deep venous thrombosis and withdrawal of sirolimus due to toxicity. Multiple purple papules and nodules were observed exclusively in the limb affected by thrombosis. Diagnosis of KS was confirmed by biopsy. Progressive withdrawal of prednisone was accompanied by full remission of the tumour. The thrombosis and withdrawal of sirolimus may have acted as cofactors in the development of KS, favouring the activation of the VEGF/KDR autocrine loop. Our experience contributes to further evidence that sirolimus may protect against KS.",M2
16731675,"HIV serodiscordant sex partners and the prevalence of human herpesvirus 8 infection among HIV negative men who have sex with men: baseline data from the EXPLORE Study.OBJECTIVES: Human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) infection is common among men who have sex with men (MSM), especially those infected with HIV, and is frequently detected in saliva. We sought to determine whether oral or anogenital contact with HIV discordant, or unknown serostatus sexual partners is associated with HHV-8 seroprevalence among HIV negative MSM. METHODS: HIV negative MSM participating in a behavioural intervention trial for the prevention of HIV infection (the EXPLORE study) were recruited from the Seattle and Denver areas for participation in this cross sectional study. Participants completed detailed questionnaires regarding sexual behaviour, focusing on activities with possible exposure to the oropharynx. Serum samples from study enrollment were tested for the presence of HHV-8 antibodies using whole virus enzyme immunoassay and immunofluorescence assay to latent and lytic proteins. RESULTS: 198/819 MSM (24.3%) were HHV-8 antibody positive. Exposure to saliva with HIV positive and HIV unknown serostatus sex partners was reported by 83% and 90% of all men, respectively. In a multivariate model, reporting more than the median number of lifetime sex partners (OR 2.2, p = 0.03) or lifetime sex partners of unknown HIV status (OR 1.7, p = 0.03), and the performance of oro-anal sex ( rimming ) on partners whose HIV status is unknown (OR 2.7, p = 0.04) were independently associated with HHV-8 infection. CONCLUSIONS: The oropharynx may be an important anatomical site in HHV-8 acquisition, and contact with HIV serodiscordant or unknown sex partners is associated with higher HHV-8 seroprevalence among HIV negative MSM.",M2

Classic KS occurs primarily on the lower extremities in elderly men living in the Mediterranean region.

The goal of this work was to specify the profile of this disease in our region through a retrospective study of 65 cases of SK over a 23-year period (1981-2003). In our series, the classic form prevailed 163 cases (96.9%)]. One patient had a secondary form due to steroid therapy and another patient had a KS associated with AIDS. A male prevalence was noticed (M/F: 2.8). Cutaneous lesions were dominated by papulo-nodular lesions (90.9%) of the lower limbs (92.3% of the cases). Mucous lesions were present in 15.4% of the cases. Therapeutic abstention was decided in 38.4%.

15718150,"Treatments of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma.Although Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has decreased in countries where the highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) regimen is available, however it remains, after non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, the most common malignancy in HIV+ patients. Advances in the treatment of AIDS-KS have been achieved, even though a gold standard therapy has not been yet defined. With the availability of HAART, a dramatic KS clinical response has been documented, making HAART essential in all patients. In case of aggressive and/or life threatening KS, more complex therapeutic schedules have to be taken into account, including chemotherapy and/or immunotherapy. Liposomal anthracyclines and paclitaxel have been approved by FDA as first line and second line mono-therapy, respectively. Interferon-alpha (INF-alpha) is the only immunomodulant agent to have shown a therapeutic effect. Among the new drugs, many antiangiogenetic agents have produced encouraging responses. Finally, the identification of the <e>HHV-8</e> as a causative agent and new metalloproteinase inhibitors may offer promising targets for the KS treatment.",M2
15207903,"Insights into the viral G protein-coupled receptor encoded by human herpesvirus type 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>).HHV-8-GPCR is a chemokine-like receptor encoded by KSHV, the etiologic agent of KS. HHV-8-GPCR is constitutively active. Although it is homologous to mammalian CXCR2, it binds CXC and CC chemokines. Structure-function analysis showed that chemokines bind primarily to the amino terminus whereas signaling occurs in the absence of: the amino terminus, which is, therefore, not a tethered agonist. In in vitro systems, HHV-8-GPCR signals via multiple transduction pathways including, activation of phospholipase C and PKC, inhibition of adenylyl cyclase, activation of nuclear factor-kappaB; activation PI 3-kinase, p42/44 MAPK and Akt/PKB, and activation of JNK/SAPK, p38 MAPK and RAFTK. HHV-8-GPCR is important in the HHV-8 life cycle because HHV-8-GPCR-deficient viruses do not replicate in response to chemokines and exhibit, less efficient reactivation from latency. Although the role of HHV-8-GPCR in the pathogenesis of KS has not been defined, expression of HHV-8-GPCR resulted in the development of angioproliferative, KS-like tumors in transgenic mice. As endothelial cells may be targets of HHV-8 infection, HHV-8-GPCR has been studied in endothelial cells in vitro in which it affects cell adhesion and migration, increases cell survival, and stimulates secretion of proinflammatory cytokines and proangiogenic factors. Based on these findings and the observation that HHV-8-GPCR is expressed in only a few endothelial- like  spindle cells  within KS lesions, we propose that HHV-8-GPCR is involved in KS pathogenesis by stimulating secretion of proinflammatory/proangiogenic factors that act in a paracrine fashion to cause tumorigenesis.",M2
15110993,"Alpha-chemokine-mediated signal transduction in human Kaposi's sarcoma spindle cells.The role of chemokines and their receptors in HIV biology and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) pathogenesis has recently gained considerable attention. It has been shown that KS-associated human herpes virus type 8 (KSHV/<e>HHV-8</e>) encodes functional homologues of certain chemokines and chemokine receptors. This suggests that chemokines may contribute to the growth and spread of KS seen in AIDS. We found the expression of CXCR4 in primary KS tissue by using in situ hybridization (ISH). Recently, alpha-chemokine receptors CXCR1 and CXCR2 have also been shown to be expressed by KS tissues. We further characterized the expression of these chemokines as well as the signaling events induced upon binding to their respective cognate ligands in the KS 38 spindle cell line. These cells express authentic characteristics of primary KS spindle cells and provide a useful in vitro model for these studies. We observed using RT-PCR that KS 38 cells express mRNA for the alpha-chemokine receptors CXCR1, CXCR2, and CXCR4. We also confirmed the cell surface protein expression by FACS analysis. Characterization of signaling pathways revealed that the alpha-chemokines, IL-8 and stromal cell-derived factor 1alpha (SDF1alpha/CXCL12), activated members of the mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase family, including Erk kinase, c-Jun amino terminal kinase (JNK)/stress-activated protein kinase (SAPK) and the p38 MAP kinase. Furthermore, using DNA protein-binding experiments, we have shown that IL-8 increased AP-1 and NF Kappa B activity in these cells. IL-8 also enhanced the chemotaxis of KS cells. These results reveal that chemokine-induced signaling pathways may mediate cell growth, transcriptional activation and cell migration in KS.",M2
15105642,"Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma: a study of 33 cases emphasizing its pathologic, immunophenotypic, and biologic uniqueness from juvenile hemangioma.Kaposiform hemangioendothelioma (KH) is a rare tumor of childhood often associated with Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon (KMP) and occasionally lymphangiomatosis. Although generally considered distinct from other vascular neoplasms, its rarity has precluded a thorough study of its immunophenotypic profile and long-term behavior. Thirty-three cases of KH were reviewed and immunostained for alpha-smooth muscle actin, various endothelial markers (CD31, CD34, vWf, FLI1), a platelet marker (CD61), and the juvenile hemangioma-associated markers GLUT-1 and Lewis Y antigen (LeY). In addition, the presence of <e>HHV-8</e> was evaluated by RT-PCR. The patients (20 males and 13 females) ranged in age from 2 weeks to 20 years (mean 3 years 9 months). Tumors developed on the extremities (17 cases), head/neck (8 cases), and other sites (8 cases) and affected both superficial and deep soft tissue. Those in the skin presented as slightly raised blue-red lesions. More than half of the patients presented with KMP (14 of 25). Tumors consisted of irregular, infiltrating nodules of compressed vessels, which modulated between areas resembling a capillary hemangioma and Kaposi sarcoma (KS). Endothelial cells in nodules were CD31, CD34, and FLI1 positive but negative for GLUT1 and LeY. Scattered  epithelioid  or glomeruloid islands featuring endothelium associated with clusters of plump alpha-smooth muscle actin-positive pericytes, stippled hemosiderin, and CD61-positive fibrin thrombi likely represent the morphologic sites of platelet consumption. Small and large lymphatic channels occurred in 22 of 33 cases and were typically seen peripheral or deep to the main tumor mass. HHV-8 transcripts were not identified (0 of 3 cases). Follow-up information was available in 22 patients (range 8 months to 15 years; mean 2 years) and indicated that 3 died of disease, 8 were alive with disease, and 10 were alive without residual disease. Two patients developed regional perinodal soft tissue involvement, but none developed distant metastases. KH is a lesion having both a vascular and lymphatic component. Its common association with KMP probably relates in part to unique architectural features that favor turbulent blood flow and platelet activation. KH can also be reliably separated from JH by GLUT-1 and LeY immunostaining, indicating differences in the morphologic and functional attributes of the endothelium between the two lesions. The absence of HHV-8 in KH underscores a different pathogenesis from Kaposi sarcoma. Our study, the largest to date, emphasizes that mortality is due to KMP and not metastatic disease, which appears limited to regional perinodal soft tissue. Given this behavior, its continued classification as a vascular tumor of intermediate malignancy is warranted.",M2

14682665,"Oral Kaposi sarcoma associated with severe alveolar bone loss: case report and review of the literature.BACKGROUND: In AIDS patients who present with an oral neoplasm, Kaposi sarcoma is the tumor most frequently encountered, comprising 50% to 80% of all tumor occurrences. However, oral Kaposi sarcoma associated with erosion of underlying bone is a relatively rare finding. This report and review of the literature documents a case of AIDS-related oral Kaposi sarcoma exhibiting severe bilateral erosion of the maxillary alveolar ridges. METHODS: An HIV-seropositive male with extensive maxillary Kaposi sarcoma and associated bilateral alveolar bone erosion presented for dental evaluation subsequent to radiation therapy. Clinical and radiographic examinations were performed. Medical and dental histories were procured and supplemented with consultations from the patient's primary physician and radiation oncologist. Maxillary edentulation with surgical revision for primary closure was the treatment of choice for management of the dentoalveolar pathology. A maxillary immediate treatment denture was designed to obturate anticipated antral communications with the maxillary sinus. RESULTS: Surgical and prosthetic treatments were completed, but complicated by an oral-antral perforation that subsequently healed without complication. Soft tissue biopsies obtained during surgery revealed no evidence of residual Kaposi sarcoma. CONCLUSIONS: Although AIDS-related oral Kaposi sarcoma is a relatively common finding, erosion of subjacent alveolar bone is uncommon. Treatment of the tumor with subsequent dental reconstruction can be complicated by the severe lack of bone, surgical perforation of the maxillary sinus, and lack of stable teeth to serve as abutments. Significant advances in understanding the pathogenesis of AIDS-related Kaposi sarcoma have occurred in the last decade. <e>HHV-8</e> and various inflammatory cytokines have been implicated in the pathogenesis and are likely to become the primary targets for therapeutic intervention.",M2

The group  Skin and organ transplantation  of the French Society of Dermatology concentrated one's efforts on skin carcinomas and Kaposis's sarcoma. Skin carcinomas are the most frequent tumors observed in transplant recipients. Many factors participate to their pathogenesis such as genetic, environmental and iatrogenic. Their prevalence is very high in elderly transplant recipients with fair complexion, long time of immunosuppression, long time of sun exposure, multiple keratoses and warts. Preventive measures consist educational training, sun avoidance and treatment of keratoses. Transplant recipients who develop Kaposi's disease are all infected with Human Herpes Virus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>). HHV-8 promoinfection occurred frequently before transplantation. Cofactors involved in the development of Kaposi' sarcoma will be probably identified by the results of an ongoing national prospective study of kidney transplant recipients.

A precise diagnosis is required because of the different management of these diseases. KS or BA involving bone marrow is rare in patients with and without acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS). We report the case of a 40-year-old human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive homosexual male who presented with small KS lesions in the skin and BA in the bone marrow that histologically were similar. Laboratory evaluation revealed anemia and thrombocytopenia; CD4 count was 103/mm3, and the viral load was 750,000 HIV-1 mRNA copies per milliliter in plasma. Bartonella henselae, the etiologic agent of BA, was isolated from a blood culture. DNA sequences of human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>), the putative etiologic agent of KS, were identified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) in skin and bone marrow specimens, but antibody anti-HHV-8-encoded protein ORF73, localized signals only in the skin-KS lesion. The patient received clarithromycin and cefotetan for the BA, and antiretroviral therapy for the HIV infection. The skin lesions gradually regressed, the HIV-1 mRNA copy number decreased to less than 400 per milliliter and the CD4 lymphocyte count increased to 665/mm3. In conclusion, vascular lesions of BA and KS may be clinically and histologically similar, both may be associated with advanced AIDS, and an accurate diagnosis is required because of their different management.",M2

We present a 50 year-old HIV-positive, bisexual, white male with a CD4 count 300/mm(3) and a viral HIV-RNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) load of 237 copies/ml, who developed a painful, purple-red mass in the edentulous area of the maxillary right first molar. Erythematous gingival enlargements of the interdental papillae were seen in three of the dental quadrants. In addition, the patient was being managed with antiretroviral therapy and liposomal doxorubicin for recurrent cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma (KS). Although oral KS was suspected, the gingival lesions were biopsied because they were refractory to chemotherapy and a lymphoma could not be excluded. Histopathologic examination revealed a lymphoid malignant neoplasm, consistent with a plasmablastic lymphoma. Immunoreactivity with vs38c, CD79a, kappa light chain, and IgG was readily identified in tumor cells; while only focal cells expressed CD20 and LCA (CD45RB). CD56, CD3, lambda light chain, and EMA were non-reactive. EBV was detected in the tumor by Southern hybridization, PCR amplification, in situ hybridization for EBER-1 DNA, and immunohistochemistry for latent membrane protein-1.

11687747,"Disseminated manifestation of Kaposi's Sarcoma in newly diagnosed AIDS in an african female.BACKGROUND: Kaposi's sarcomas are the most frequent malignancies in patients with AIDS and there is increasing evidence of an association with human Herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>). A reconstitution of the immune response due to different regimens of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) is the most important step in treatment of Kaposi's sarcomas. Local treatment options include the topic application of alitretionin (9-cis-retinoic acid) as a gel, cryotherapy with liquid nitrogen and intralesional vinblastine, as well as local laser or low-dose X-ray treatment. A systemic chemotherapy can be taken under consideration in selected cases with clinical significant visceral lesions or aggressive sarcomatous behavior with anthracyclines, taxanes, as well as an immunomodulatory treatment with alpha Interferon. CASE REPORT: The case of an african emigrant is described. Hospitalized due to recurrent fever and diarrhea, the diagnosis of AIDS was quickly established. The physical examination revealed multiple nodular, painless skin lesions suspicious of Kaposi's sarcoma. The diagnosis was confirmed histologically, later on also in bronchial and duodenal biopsies due to the atypical subepithelial vessels with slit-like appearance and prominent endothelia. CONCLUSIONS: Cutaneous lesions in patients with dark skin colour may be unfamiliar to European physicians. In patients with HIV-infection, nodular skin lesions should lead suspicion to Kaposi's sarcoma. If this diagnosis is established, it should be clarified, if other locations (e.g.: intestine, respiratory tract) are involved, too.",M2
11441293,"Etiologic factors in soft tissue sarcomas.Soft tissue sarcomas account for about 1% of all malignancies. The increase in incidence of soft tissue sarcomas during the recent decades may predominantly be attributed to AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma; when this tumor is excluded, conclusive evidence for an age-adjusted increase is lacking. Beside the well investigated role of the human immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) and the human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) in the tumorigenesis of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma and several inherited disorders, considerable evidence support a relationship between occupational chemicals as vinyl chloride, phenoxyacetic acid herbicides, chlorphenols, dioxin, medicinal measures as Thorotrast exposure and therapeutic irradiation, and the development of soft tissue sarcoma. Hormones and chronic repair processes are further probably sarcoma-promoting factors. Considering the rarity of soft tissue sarcomas despite the vast portion that soft tissues comprise in the human body, additional knowledge on the tumorigenesis of soft tissue sarcomas might considerably contribute to the understanding of the etiologic pathways of malignant tumors in humans.",M2

AKS is one of the most common cutaneous neoplasms in black Africans and although rare in Europe, it may be seen more frequently in the future because of the ease of international travel. The existing classification of KS into five different types (classic, African-endemic, iatrogenically immunocompromised patients, epidemic HIV-related and Mediterranean-endemic) cannot address fully the many anomalies described in the disease.

Case report and review of the literature]Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is a malignant vascular neoplasia with a viral etiology, characterized by development of multiple hyperpigmentate lesions, primarily at cutaneous level with associated edema and ulcerations, but frequently involving also the mucous membranes and/or visceral organs. In this study, we describe (in the light of the relevant literature) the clinical case of an elderly (78 yrs-old) woman, who developed red-blues multiple hyperkeratotic nodules in the right leg and foot with marked lymphoedema, blushing and pain, after a long period of a low-dose corticosteroid therapy for LES (at least 10 years of continuous treatment). The diagnosis of KS was made on the basis of histologic findings. The patient HLA-typing showed the haplotypes HLA-A2-10, -B21-35, -Bw4-6, -Cw4 and HLA-DR11-13 (some of which are known to predispose to LES, but not to KS). The KS, first described by Moritz Kaposi in 1872, has been a very rare pathology until the  80s, afterwards its frequency has steadly increased, favored by immunosuppressive therapy for autoimmune diseases or tranplants and by immunodepression of AIDS. Concerning the pathogenesis, it is crucial the role of <e>HHV-8</e> of the herpesvirus family (found in the lesions and in the circulating cells of all KS patients), for which a prevailing sexual transmission is postulated. General physicians and specialists of internal medicine and angiology should know this disease, which can be undiagnosed because of the low incidence in the general population and the consequent poor knowledge of this vascular neoplastic disease, which is now reported with increasing frequency.",M2
11368110,"Kaposi's sarcoma before and during a human immunodeficiency virus epidemic in Tanzanian children.BACKGROUND: With the onset of AIDS increased frequency of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has been reported. However, there is no case-based comparison of childhood (&lt;14 years) KS before and during the HIV pandemic in sub-Saharan Africa. Here we report on the Tanzanian cancer registry data of pediatric KS in Tanzania and implications with regard to pathogenic factors. METHODS: One hundred fifty histologically confirmed pediatric KS (PKS) cases registered during 1968 through 1995 (28 years) were analyzed with regard to demographic and clinical characteristics before and during the AIDS epidemic. Statistical analysis was done with the Epi-Info program and chi square test. RESULTS: Of children with PKS 126 (84%) were male and 24 (16%) were female. The gender ratio was 5.1:1 and 5.4:1 during the endemic and epidemic periods, respectively. The highest occurrence of PKS was observed in the 0- to 5-years age group. Overall 73 (4.9/year) of these cases were registered during the pre and 77 (5.9/year) during the AIDS period. Over time a significant increase in anatomically disseminated KS cases was evident during the AIDS epidemic (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: These observations indicate that children younger than 5 years are at high risk for developing KS, possibly reflecting low resistance to human herpesvirus (HHV) 8 infection. It is also likely that an increased susceptibility to <e>HHV8</e> infection and morbidity is related to progressive immunodeficiency. The increase in AIDS PKS incidence appears to reflect a direct or indirect promoting effect of HIV on the development of KS lesions. Recognition of the high KS risk in small children warrants considerations of possible prevention measures including HIV/HHV8 vaccination and therapeutic options.",M2
11365531,"Less cancer--or more--with HAART? Or, reflections on a late opus.Participants in the National AIDS Malignancy Conference grappled with the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on cancer. HAART has sharply decreased rates of opportunistic infections in a number of studies, but its impact on AIDS is complicated. Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) rates have rapidly declined in the past few years, corresponding to the time that HAART has been the standard of care. However, the effects on non-Hodgkin's lymphoma are mixed. Researchers also report a higher risk of cervical cancer among HIV-positive women. Immune-suppressed populations experience higher rates of cancer than expected, but the correlation between HIV-induced immune suppression and AIDS malignancies is not likely to be worked out soon. Charts show how the rates of HIV-associated KS and primary CNS lymphoma have decreased recently, and show how <e>HHV-8</e> seropositivity correlates to the number of sexual partners.

Although KS is primarily a cutaneous disease, extracutaneous spread is common; the oral cavity, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, lungs, and lymph nodes are often involved. The psychosocial burden associated with KS may be profound. The initial evaluation of a patient with KS consists mainly of a thorough physical examination with special attention paid to those areas typically affected by the disease, the testing of stool for occult blood, and a chest x-ray. Treatment options depend greatly on the tumor (extent of tumor and rate of growth), human immunodeficiency virus type I (HIV-I) viral load, and host factors (CD4+ T-lymphocyte count and overall medical condition). Limited cutaneous disease may be treated with topical alitretinoin gel, intralesional vinblastine, radiation therapy, laser therapy, or cryotherapy. The high benefit-to-risk ratio of liposomal anthracyclines (daunorubicin and doxorubicin) and paclitaxel have tremendously simplified the management of patients in whom systemic therapy is warranted. Additionally, epidemiologic evidence of a marked decline in new KS since the widespread use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) advocates its use. KS herpes virus/human herpes virus 8 (KSHV/<e>HHV-8</e>), sex hormones, and the processes of angiogenesis and cellular differentiation all serve as targets for pathogenesis-based clinical trials. Virtually all patients with KS can benefit from the many approved and investigational agents developed through years of collaborative translational and clinical research.",M2
10903192,"Hodgkin's disease related Kaposi's sarcoma in a non HIV infected male patient: a case report and review of the literature on a rare condition.A higher incidence of coexisting lymphoproliferative disease and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has been reported. However, the association of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and KS is a rare condition, and only 41 cases have been found upon a literature review of the last 33 years. In this study the case of a 70 year-old male patient with consecutive appearance of Hodgkin's disease (HD) and Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) without evidence of HIV infection or other immunodeficiency is presented. The data suggest, that the association of KS with HD may be due to common pathogenic mechanisms, rather than a direct causal relationship, except the requirement of an impaired immune system for the development of KS. Recently development of HD and KS has been associated with EBV and <e>HHV-8</e>, respectively. Neither immunosuppression, nor EBV or HHV-8 infection alone result in development of HD or KS. There is no clear time relationship between the development of KS and HD when the two occurred together in the same patient. That finding, coupled with the rarity of the association, suggest, that the association is more likely coincidental.",M2
10643281,"[Infections of the oral mucosa II. Bacterial, mycotic and viral infections]Non-specific infections of the oral mucosa are rare; however, they may present during HIV infection in the form of gingivo-periodontal lesions. In some of these Candida albicans may play a role in the pathogenesis. Sexually transmitted bacterial infections such as gonorrhoea and syphilis are frequently associated with HIV infection. Since penicillin resistance is frequent in gonorrhoea, the cephalosporines are mainly used for treatment. Syphilis increases the risk for transmission of HIV. Lues maligna with oral manifestations has been described. For this, penicillin G is the therapy of choice. Tuberculosis, characterized by multitherapy resistance, is associated with HIV infections world-wide; oral manifestations are rare. Oral candidiasis during HIV infection is often characterized by therapy resistance against fluconazole and a shift in species, with Candida glabrata and Candida krusei as the emerging species. The azoles are still the mainstay of therapy, particularly fluconazole. Herpes simplex (HSV) infections run an atypical course during HIV disease; resistance against acyclovir is a clinical problem. The association of HSV infection with erythema exudativum multiforme has been clearly shown. Oral hairy leukoplakia caused by Epstein Barr virus is a characteristic infection during immunosuppression. Cytomegalovirus infection is also observed in immunodeficient patients. Cases of ganciclovir resistance have been described. Human herpes virus 8 (<e>HHV 8</e>) is associated with Kaposi's sarcoma. Therapeutic trials have focussed on the inhibition of HHV 8 replication. Over 100 different genotypes of human papillomaviruses are known; some can cause infections of the oral mucosa. Characteristic lesions caused by different HPV genotypes are verruca vulgaris, condyloma acuminatum and focal epithelial hyperplasia.",M2
10398144,"Thrombospondin-1 inhibits Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) cell and HIV-1 Tat-induced angiogenesis and is poorly expressed in KS lesions.Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), a neoplasm often associated with iatrogenic and acquired immunosuppression, is characterized by prominent angiogenesis. Angiogenic factors released by both KS and host cells, as well as <e>HHV-8</e> and HIV viral products, have been implicated in the pathogenesis of this lesion. Angiogenesis is the result of imbalance among angiogenesis promoters and inhibitors, which disrupts homeostasis. The aim of this study was to investigate the expression and mechanism of KS control of thrombospondin-1 (TSP), a physiological inhibitor of angiogenesis. Immunohistochemical analysis of four KS lesions showed only spotty reactivity for TSP in the stroma and in less than 10 per cent of lesional blood vessels. In addition, the typical KS spindle cells were not stained. In agreement with these findings, decreased levels of TSP were measured with an ELISA assay in the supernatants of cultured KS cells, compared with endothelial cells. In vitro, TSP inhibited the endothelial cell proliferation and motility induced by KS cell supernatants. TSP also prevented endothelial cell motility induced by Tat, a product of HIV-1 endowed with angiogenic potential and implicated in the pathogenesis of AIDS-KS. In vivo, TSP inhibited the angiogenic activity exerted by Tat in the Matrigel sponge model. These results suggest that TSP down-regulation might be permissive for the development of KS-associated angiogenesis.",M2
10216397,"[Primary cavity-based lymphoma and HIV infection]BACKGROUND: Primary cavity-based lymphomas (PCBL) represent and uncommon group on non-Hodgkin lymphomas associated with AIDS. They present as malignant effusions with no bone marrow or lymph node involvement, although some cases with bone marrow infiltration at advanced stages have been reported. Tumoral cells are monoclonal and are occasionally infected with human herpesvirus type-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>). PATIENTS AND METHODS: The clinical and evolutive characteristics of six HIV-positive patients with PCBL were analysed. In three of them the presence of genetic sequences of HHV-8 in peripheral blood lymphocytes and lymphomatous effusions was investigated by PCR. RESULTS: The mean age of patients was 37 years and 5 were males. The only female patient had been drug abuser, four males were homosexuals and the other promiscuous heterosexual. The mean CD4+ lymphocyte count was 84 x 10(6)/l (range: 20-180) and all of them had been diagnosed of AIDS. The presentation forms were as pericardial effusion in one case, pleural effusion in three and tumoral ascites in two. Two of the male patients had also Kaposi sarcoma (KS). At diagnosis none of them had infiltration of the bone marrow nor lymphadenopathy. Most malignant cells had immunoblastic traits. The effusions had the characteristics of an exudate and the mean value of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was 5,255 IU/l (range: 1,500-11,483). In the three cases investigated there was HHV-8 DNA in the lymphocytes present in the lymphomatous effusion and in peripheral blood. The mean survival after diagnosis was 89 days (7-240). The female patient died without therapy seven days after admission and the five male patients were treated with chemotherapy with a poor response. CONCLUSIONS: HIV-related PCBL associated or not with KA appear in severely immunodepressed patients, their behaviour is very aggressive and its clinical course fatal in a short period of time. The are often associated with KS and HHV-8 seems to be the involved causative agent.",M2
10199480,"Epstein-Barr virus-associated intravascular lymphomatosis within Kaposi's sarcoma in an AIDS patient.Intravascular lymphomatosis (IL) is an unusual neoplasm characterized by multifocal proliferation of lymphoma cells exclusively within the blood vessels. We report here a patient with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) and disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma. A 233-bp amplification product of <e>HHV-8</e> was detected in the DNA extracted from specimens of Kaposi's sarcoma at different sites by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). At autopsy, the vessels within the Kaposi's sarcoma were dilated and filled with atypical large mononuclear cells. No such feature was seen in the vessels of non-Kaposi's sarcomatous regions. Immunohistochemically, the spindle cells of Kaposi's sarcoma were positive for CD31 (endothelial cell marker). The intravascular tumor cells were positive for CD45 (leukocyte common antigen) but negative for others, including chloroacetate esterase, CD45-RO (UCHL-1, Pan-T), CD3, CD43, CD20 (L26, Pan-B), CD30 (Ki-1), immunoglobulin heavy chains and light chains, CD56 (natural killer cell antigen), and CD31. Monoclonal rearrangement of immunoglobulin heavy chain gene was detected in the DNA extracts from fresh tissue of Kaposi's sarcoma by PCR, which indicated that the lymphoma cells within the Kaposi's sarcoma were of monoclonal B cell origin. In situ hybridization revealed that EBER-1 transcripts were present in the lymphoma cells of IL but not in the spindle cells of Kaposi's sarcoma. To the authors' best knowledge, this is the first instance of IL in an AIDS patient with direct evidence of EBV association.",M2
9921413,"Epidemiology, etiology and pathogenesis, clinical presentations and therapeutic approaches in Kaposi's sarcoma: 15-year lessons from AIDS.Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a leading cause of morbidity among 25-30% of AIDS patients and is by far the most common AIDS-associated malignancy. Since the beginning of the 1990s the incidence of KS continuously declined, but it was the introduction of protease inhibitors that markedly reinforced this phenomenon. In our experience, the annual incidence was 59/1,000 patient-years in 1984 vs 21.2/1,000 patient-years in 1990, 12.5/1,000 patient-years in 1996, with a drop to 3.2/1,000 patient-years in 1997. One of the peculiar characteristic of this tumor is the sexual susceptibility, which could be the consequence of a hormonal protection in females. The in vitro models of KS-like cell culture promoted and sustained in vitro with a conditioned medium containing several pro-inflammatory cytokines, the characterization of human herpes virus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) in almost all the cases of AIDS-KS as the putative KS-agent and the determination of a putative role of hCG-associated factors in the control of KS growth are among the leading discoveries of this last decade in this field.",M2
9869826,"Pathology of human immunodeficiency virus infection: noninfectious conditions.Diagnostic anatomic pathologists play a crucial role in the battle against acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). Not only are they intimately involved in the treatment of individual patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, but also they make important observations that result in the expansion of the scientific understanding of its pathogenesis. Pathologists studying tissue from patients with HIV infection should be familiar with the conditions to which these patients are susceptible. Although opportunistic infections are important causes of morbidity and mortality, noninfectious conditions frequently make substantial contributions to the disease course. Patients with HIV infection may be at increased risk for neoplastic disease. They do not, however, have an increased incidence of the most common tumors affecting the general population, such as breast, colon, and prostate carcinoma. Immunodeficiency results in increased susceptibility to malignant neoplasms, both by decreased immunologic response to abnormal cells and increased susceptibility to infection by viruses. All of the malignant neoplastic diseases that are Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) AIDS indicator conditions have been shown to have an association with a virus: Kaposi sarcoma (KS) with herpes hominis virus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>), malignant lymphoma with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and cervical carcinoma with human papilloma virus (HPV). Patients with HIV infection also can develop reactive processes that are attributable to direct effects of HIV or immune system alterations. Such conditions include salivary gland cystic lymphoepithelial lesion, lymphadenopathy, lymphocytic interstitial pneumonitis, encephalopathy, enteropathy, nephropathy, hepatic conditions, dermatologic conditions and anemia.",M2

Recently a putative herpes virus (<e>HHV-8</e>) was described and shown to be present in all four types of KS. The immunological status of patients with EKS has been conflicting. In this study total leucocyte counts, total lymphocyte counts and lymphocyte subsets of patients with EKS and AKS were determined by flow cytometry and compared to those of healthy HIV-1 seronegative controls. Results show that 50% of EKS lesions were of nodular type. Patients with EKS had significantly lower levels of CD4+ T- lymphocytes and CD4:CD8 ratio but significantly higher CD8+ T-lymphocytes compared to controls. Patients with AKS had significantly lower levels of CD4+ T-lymphocytes and also CD4:CD8 ratios but significantly higher percentage of CD8+ T-lymphocytes when compared with EKS patients. These findings indicate that in both forms of KS there is a certain degree of immunological disturbance which is more conspicuous in AKS because of HIV infection and suggests that HIV-1 acts synergistically with the aetiological agent (HHV-8) to cause a more aggressive type of KS.",M2

Control of mucocutaneous KS lesions was obtained with radiotherapy, interferon alfa-2b and withdrawal of systemic immunosuppressive therapy. Erosive oral lichen planus appeared later, and after therapy with topical corticosteroids a new lesion of KS developed that regressed after withdrawal of topical corticosteroids.

9502754,"Clinical manifestations and therapies of AIDS associated tumors.We are giving an overview over the clinical features and different therapeutic options of HIV associated malignancies. There are three AIDS-defining malignancies: - Kaposi's sarcoma - Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) - cervical cancer. In Kaposi sarcoma there is a broad therapeutic spectrum from cryotherapy to systemic chemotherapy depending on the site and stage of the Kaposi sarcoma. In NHL early therapeutic intervention is necessary because of the fast progress of the tumor. The cervical cancer in HIV-infected women seems to be more aggressive than in non-infected and also needs early therapeutic intervention. Many other tumors seem to occur more frequently in patients with HIV infection: anorectal cancer, malignant testicular tumors, lung cancer, Hodgkin's lymphoma, basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and even malignant melanoma. The cancer incidence in HIV-patients seems to be higher among nonblacks. Most of the immunodeficiency associated tumors are virus induced and they are accompanied by a persistent viral infection, including <e>HHV-8</e> in Kaposi's sarcoma; Epstein Barr virus (EBV) in NHL; and human papillomavirus (HPV) in cervical cancer. But there are also types of virus induced tumors which are not frequently associated with HIV-infection like the primary hepatocellular carcinoma in patients with hepatitis B virus infection.",M2
9365767,"Risk factors for Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-positive subjects in Uganda.BACKGROUND: Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is associated epidemiologically with HIV infection and with human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e> or KSHV). Both KS and HIV infection are common in Uganda. We conducted a case-control study of 458 HIV-seropositive. Ugandan adults with KS and 568 HIV-seropositive subjects without KS to examine risk factors for HIV-associated KS. METHODS: We recruited newly diagnosed adult KS cases from five hospitals in Kampala, Uganda and controls from a large referral clinic for HIV infection at Mulago Hospital. All cases and controls were counselled and tested for HIV and answered an interviewer-administered questionnaire about their home, socio-economic conditions, lifestyle and sexual behaviour before they became ill. Only HIV-seropositive subjects were included in the analysis. RESULTS: There were 295 males and 163 females with KS and 227 male and 341 female controls. Age distribution was similar but there was a higher proportion of cases (45%) than controls (29%) residing in rural regions of Uganda. KS cases were more likely than controls to have a higher level of education (X2 for trend, 4.8; P = 0.03), to have occupations associated with affluence [chi 2 for heterogeneity, 17.3 on 5 degrees of freedom (df); P = 0.004] and to come from larger settlements [adjusted odds ratio (OR) for settlements of &gt; 1000 versus 10-99 houses, 1.8; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-3.0]. Cases were more likely than controls to have high household income (chi 2 for trend, 32.6; P &lt; 0.001) and other markers of urban or rural wealth such as owning several cows (chi 2 for trend, 9.5; P = 0.002). Cases were more likely to travel away from home (adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.1-2.3) and more likely to have spent increasing time in contact with water (chi 2 for trend, 12.3; P &lt; 0.001). Few indices of sexual behaviour were related to risk of KS, including reported number of sexual partners. Cases were more likely than controls to be married to one rather than several spouses (adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.2) and to have reported a history of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) (adjusted OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.2-2.3). CONCLUSIONS: Among HIV-infected subjects, KS cases are characterized by better education and greater affluence, compared with controls. Urban address, travel away from home, exposure to water, monogamous marriage and self-reported STD were also more frequent among KS cases than controls. The higher socio-economic status of persons with HIV and KS may be a marker for enhanced exposure to a possibly sexually transmitted agent, or for a delayed exposure to a childhood infection. The risk posed by exposure to water among KS cases requires further study.The risk factors for Kaposi's sarcoma in HIV-infected persons were investigated in a case-control study conducted in Kampala, Uganda, in 1994-96.  Cases included 458 HIV-positive Ugandans with newly diagnosed Kaposi's sarcoma, while the control group was comprised of 568 seropositive subjects without Kaposi's sarcoma.  Men and women with Kaposi sarcoma were significantly more likely than controls to have a higher educational level, have prestigious professional or military jobs, to come from large settlements (over 1000 houses), to have a high household income, to travel away from home more than seven nights per year, and to have spent increasing time in contact with water.  In addition, cases were more likely than controls to be married to one rather than several spouses and to have a history of a sexually transmitted disease.  Indices of sexual behavior, including reported number of sexual partners and condom use, were unrelated to Kaposi's sarcoma risk.  The higher socioeconomic status of HIV-infected persons with Kaposi's sarcoma may be a marker for enhanced exposure to a sexually transmitted agent such as human herpes virus-8 or for delayed exposure to a childhood infection.  The puzzling association between exposure to water and Kaposi's sarcoma warrants further investigation.",M2
9327221,"Treatment of epidemic (AIDS-related) Kaposi's sarcoma.Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor seen in patients with HIV-1 infection. KS causes significant morbidity and mortality through involvement of the skin and visceral organs. The optimal treatment for KS depends on the extent of the disease and immunologic status. However, with knowledge gained on the pathogenesis of disease, newer therapies and compounds are being developed. Early disease patients are best treated with either local therapy or agents that have low toxicity and can be delivered long term. Advanced disease, such as in patients with widespread mucocutaneous disease, lymphedema, and visceral disease, are treated most effectively with cytotoxic agents such as liposomal anthracyclines, vinca alkaloids, or paclitaxel. Future treatment developments are focusing on the role of effective anti-HIV therapy and anti-human herpesvirus <e>(HHV)-8</e> therapy in an effort to interfere with key steps in the etiology of KS to control the disease. Secondly, agents that focus on the interruption of autocrine and paracrine growth factors such as vascular endothelial cell growth factor and basic fibroblast growth factor, interleukin-6, and interleukin-8 are of therapeutic interest.

10592820,"Autopsy findings on patients with AIDS in Taiwan.At National Taiwan University Hospital, from 1986 to 1996, autopsies were performed on 16 patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. There were 15 men and 1 woman. Fourteen of these male patients had contracted the disease as a result of sexual practice, among which 9 were homosexual, 1 was bisexual and 4 were heterosexual. One of the patients had become infected by sharing a syringe during intravenous drug use. The female was a sex worker. Among these patients, only 2 had been tested for HIV before developing AIDS. On autopsy, lymphoid depletion and thymus atrophy were found in all patients. Testicular atrophy was noted in all the male patients. Three patients died of malignant lymphoma. Twelve patients died of opportunistic infections and 1 committed suicide. The initial opportunistic infection was usually oral candidiasis. Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) was the most common opportunistic infection developed in the early stage while cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was the most common one found in the late stage. Mycobacterium infection had developed in 8 patients. Six patients had disseminated Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) and 4 of them were homosexual. In 4 patients, biopsy specimens were proved to have KS associated viral (<e>HHV-8</e>) genome. Malignant lymphoma was found in 4 cases, all were of high grade B cell type. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) encoding small RNA (EBER1) was demonstrated in all the lymphomas. In conclusion, (1) the prevalence of tuberculosis (38%) in patients with AIDS in Taiwan is high; (2) the most common opportunistic infections in this series are candidiasis, PCP and CMV infections; (3) the incidence of AIDS related non-Hodgkin's lymphoma in Taiwan has increased since 1995.",M2

8853726,"Distribution of human herpesvirus-8 sequences throughout the spectrum of AIDS-related neoplasia.OBJECTIVE: AIDS frequently associates with certain malignancies, including Kaposi's sarcoma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), and anogenital neoplasia. In this study we aimed to define the frequency of infection by human herpesvirus (HHV)-8 throughout the spectrum of AIDS-related neoplasia in Europe. DESIGN: A tumour panel representative of the distinct types of AIDS-related neoplasms was tested for the presence of <e>HHV-8</e> DNA sequences. Autologous uninvolved tissues were also tested in selected cases. METHODS: The presence of HHV-8 DNA sequences was assayed by a combination of polymerase chain reaction followed by oligohybridization and Southern blot hybridization of genomic DNA with an HHV-8-specific probe. RESULTS: HHV-8 sequences were detected in 100% of AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma (all 35 cases). Among AIDS-related NHL, HHV-8 sequences selectively clustered with body-cavity-based lymphomas (BCBL; all three cases), although they were consistently negative in small non-cleaved cell lymphomas (none in 18 cases), diffuse large cell lymphomas (none in seven), or anaplastic large cell lymphomas (none in three). No HHV-8 sequences were found in cases of anogenital neoplasia (out of 14) or Hodgkin's disease (out of three). HHV-8 DNA sequences were also positive in the uninvolved skin of all six AIDS-related Kaposi's sarcoma patients, but not in the circulating lymphocytes of a BCBL patient. Positivity for HHV-8 sequences occurred in patients belonging to all major AIDS risk categories. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm that HHV-8 sequences associate at high frequency with selected types of AIDS-related neoplasia, namely Kaposi's sarcoma and BCBL, although they are consistently absent in other types of AIDS-NHL and AIDS-related anogenital neoplasia.",M2

To determine the extent of involvement of this new agent designated HHV-8 (human herpesvirus type 8) or KSHV (Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus) in human malignant lymphomas, we analyzed 24 AIDS-associated lymphoid malignancies and 100 non-AIDS-associated lymphomas by PCR and Southern blot analysis. Three of 24 lymphoid malignancies from patients with AIDS demonstrated HHV-8 sequences by Southern blot and PCR analyses. The fourth was positive by PCR only. None of the non-AIDS-associated lymphomas contained HHV-8 sequences. All three Southern blot positive samples were derived from extranodal regions, two from pleural effusions, and one from a soft tissue mass in the thigh. This latter patient initially presented with a pleural effusion. The fourth PCR positive but Southern blot negative tumor was from a gingival lymphoma in a patient with a history of Kaposi's sarcoma. All tumors positive for HHV-8 were also positive for EBV. These results confirm a recent report that this novel herpesvirus may play a role in AIDS-associated lymphomas especially in those with body cavity presentation.",M2

HHV-8 DNA PCR was positive in 3 of the 6 patients during HIV infection preceding the appearance of KS and in all but 1 of 11 AIDS patients with KS. HHV-8 DNA PCR was negative in all but 1 of the 45 HIV-positive persons with no symptoms of infection and in all but 1 AIDS patient without KS.

Many questions remain regarding the role of this virus in KS and the therapeutic implications of this finding. In the current study, KSHV/HHV-8 DNA was detected in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-infected patients with KS (34/98) more often than in HIV-infected individuals without KS (12/64, P = .03). The detection of KSHV/HHV-8 DNA did not correlate with the CD4 lymphocyte count. Five patients demonstrated KSHV/HHV-8 DNA in their PBMCs during administration of intravenous foscarnet and/or ganciclovir. The continued detection of KSHV/HHV-8 DNA in the PBMCs of patients receiving these anti-herpesvirus drugs has potential implications regarding the virus-cell relationship of KSHV/HHV-8, as well as for the value of these drugs in treating or preventing KS, but additional studies are needed.",M2

Recently a virus, Kaposi sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus-8 (<e>HHV-8</e>), bearing these sequences has been identified in a cell line derived from a body cavity-based lymphoma. In this report, we show that the same sequences are present in KS biopsies as DNA molecules of a form and size characteristic of latent herpesviruses-large, covalently closed, circular episomes. The genomes migrate with an apparent size larger than the herpesvirus Epstein-Barr virus (172 kb). This form of the viral genome was found in four of four biopsies and three of five peripheral blood samples from KS patients. Linear forms of the viral genome, characteristic of viral replication, were not detected in the biopsies, but were present in the peripheral blood of three out of five patients. The sequences for KSHV/HHV-8 were also detected in the blood of four of five allograft patients and three of five healthy donors without KS suggesting that the virus is widespread throughout the human population.",M2
8692871,"Restricted expression of Kaposi sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (human herpesvirus 8) genes in Kaposi sarcoma.Kaposi sarcoma (KS) is the leading neoplasm of HIV-infected patients and is also found in several HIV-negative populations. Recently, DNA sequences from a novel herpesvirus, termed KS-associated herpesvirus (KSHV), or human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) have been identified within KS tissue from both HIV-positive and HIV-negative cases; infection with this agent has been proposed as a possible factor in the etiology or pathogenesis of the tumor. Here we have examined the pattern of KSHV/HHV-8 gene expression in KS and find it to be highly restricted. We identify and characterize two small transcripts that represent the bulk of the virus-specific RNA transcribed from over 120 kb of the KSHV genome in infected cells. One transcript is predicted to encode a small membrane protein; the other is an unusual polyadenylylated RNA that accumulates in the nucleus to high copy number. This pattern of viral gene expression suggests that most infected cells in KS are latently infected, with lytic viral replication likely restricted to a much smaller subpopulation of cells. These findings have implications for the therapeutic utility of currently available antiviral drugs targeted against the lytic replication cycle.",M2

To further elucidate the possibility that HHV-8 plays a role in the pathogenesis of KS, the expression of HHV-8 RNA was examined in fresh KS tissue specimens which were found to harbor HHV-8 DNA by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). The transcription of HHV-8 RNA was detected by RT-PCR in 26 of 29 specimens (89.7%) of the KS tumors including 2 of 3 CKS and 24 of 26 AIDS-KS. No positive signal was detected in eight biopsy specimens of normal skin from healthy donors. By Northern blot analysis, the expression of HHV-8 was detected in 2 of 10 KS tumors examined. Furthermore, the RNA transcripts were observed in endothelial cells lining the irregular vascular spaces and perivascular spindle-shaped cells histologically characteristic of KS in 2 out of 8 different KS specimens examined by in situ hybridization using an antisense probe specific of HHV-8. The detection of RNA expression of HHV-8 in KS tumors further supports the possible etiopathogenic role of this virus in the development of KS.",M2
8669460,"Localization of human herpes-like virus type 8 in vascular endothelial cells and perivascular spindle-shaped cells of Kaposi's sarcoma lesions by in situ hybridization.Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a neoplasm that develops as multifocal lesions characterized by a histological picture that includes irregularly shaped vascular spaces surrounded by perivascular and interstitial spindle-shaped cells, extravasated erythrocytes, and an inflammatory mononuclear cell infiltrate. Recently, the DNA sequences of a novel human gamma-herpesvirus-like (<e>HHV-8</e>) agent have been detected by polymerase chain reaction in KS associated with acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS-KS), classical KS, and African endemic KS. The present study was done to identify the specific cells within KS tumors that contain the viral DNA. Fourteen skin biopsy specimens, including three classical KSs, six AIDS-KSs, three normal skin specimens, and two common warts from healthy individuals, were examined by polymerase chain reaction for the presence of the HHV-8 DNA sequences. HHV-8 DNA were present in all nine KS specimens but not detectable in the five non-KS tissue samples. Using in situ hybridization, we found the HHV-8 DNA sequences to be predominantly localized to the nuclei of endothelial cells lining the vascular slits and some perivascular spindle-shaped cells, in two of three KS and four of six AIDS-KS tissue sections examined. The HHV-8-positive cells of KS specimens were concurrently shown to also be positive for factor-VIII-related antigen by immunohistochemical staining. The presence of the DNA of HHV-8 in the nuclei of KS cells further supports the possibility that this agent may play a role in the pathogenesis of this tumor.",M2
8744575,"Restricted tissue distribution of extralesional Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-like DNA sequences in AIDS patients with Kaposi's sarcoma.Specific herpesvirus-like DNA sequences have been found in Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) lesions of AIDS patients, suggesting that a novel gamma herpesvirus, homologous to Epstein-Barr virus and herpesvirus saimiri, could be implicated in the pathogenesis of KS. To better understand the role of this putative etiological agent, named Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) or human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>), we investigated by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) the presence of viral DNA sequences in various organs obtained at autopsy from seven AIDS patients with KS and six without KS. For each sample, to exclude positive results due to visceral KS dissemination, the presence of microscopic foci of KS cells was rules out by histology and CD34 immunohistochemistry on serial frozen sections immediately adjacent to those employed for DNA extraction. PCR and nested PCR were performed with primers specific for the HIV-8 330 Bam fragment originally described by Chang et al. (Science 1994;266:1865-1869). As quality control, the extracted DNA was amplified with primers for human beta-globin. All KS legions were HHV-8 positive. In addition, extralesional KSHV DNA sequences were detected in seven of seven lymphoid organs and in five of five prostate glands of KS patients. Normal skin was positive in three of five cases and bone marrow in two of three tested cases, all other tissues being negative by PCR and nested PCR. By contrast, no virus was detected in tissue samples of AIDS cases without KS. The restricted organ distribution here documented argues for a selective tissue tropism of HHV-8 in vivo in AIDS patients and suggests that in the infected host lymphoid organs and the prostate gland may represent privileged sites of viral latency and persistence.",M2
8640682,"Herpesvirus-like DNA sequences and Kaposi's sarcoma: relationship with epidemiology, clinical spectrum, and histologic features.BACKGROUND: The evidence of an infectious agent other than human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) acting as a possible etiologic cause of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) has received considerable attention in the last years. Recently, DNA sequences from a new herpesvirus (<e>HHV-8</e>) have been observed in several cases of KS. The discovery suggests that this virus may play a role in the pathogenesis of KS. To evaluate these results, we determined the frequency of HHV-8 DNA sequences in 78 specimens of KS according to different epidemiologic origins (sporadic KS: 6, immunosuppressive drug-associated: 11, and AIDS-associated: 61), clinical forms (cutaneous: 69, mucocutaneous: 4 and visceral; 5) and histologic variants (early-patch: 40, late-plaque or nodular: 38). METHODS: We used the hot start polymerase chain reaction amplification method with KS330 primers specific for HHV-8 DNA. Tumoral or nontumoral skins and visceral specimens free of KS, originating from patients with KS positive for HHV-8 DNA sequences or from immunosuppressed patients without KS, served as controls. Normal skin from healthy HIV seronegative patients was also included. RESULTS: HHV-8 DNA sequences were found in 3 of the 6 sporadic KS (50%), in 5 of the 11 immunosuppressive drug-associated KS (45%), in 41 of the 61 AIDS-associated KS (67%), in 32 of the 69 cutaneous KS (46%), in 3 of the 4 mucocutaneous KS (75%) in 2 of the 5 systemic KS (40%), in 23 of the 40 early or patchstage KS (58%), in 30 of the 38 late plaque or nodular stages KS (79%). These sequences were also demonstrated in one sample of skin with scabies and in a glomerulonephritis lesion from two immunosuppressed patients with KS who were also positive for herpesvirus-like in their KS lesions. None of the other skin or visceral specimens, originating from healthy, AIDS, or transplanted patients without KS, were positive. CONCLUSIONS: Our results reinforce the hypothesis that HHV-8 is incriminated in different epidemiologic, clinical and histologic stages of KS and could contribute to the pathogenesis of this tumor. However, the presence of HHV-8 DNA sequences in skin and visceral samples free of KS from KS indicates that the virus is not restricted to the tumor tissue, and thus is able to disseminate in many organs of the target individual. Absence of the virus from healthy, AIDS, or transplanted patients without KS suggests that the viral Sequences either do not spread easily or do not easily maintain themselves in the human population.",M2

11363312,"Kaposi's sarcoma.Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is the most common tumor in people with AIDS but it is not a common cause of death. There are several types of KS: classical KS, African KS, transplant KS, AIDS-KS, and non-AIDS KS. KS strikes males predominantly; only in children less than thirteen years old is the disease evenly distributed across gender. The cause of KS may be a newly discovered herpesvirus, KSHV (also called <e>HHV-8</e>), but there is no consensus on this yet. Researchers have determined that the presence of KSHV in blood mononuclear cells is predictive of the future onset of KS. Further advancing the theory that KS is a virus is the fact that tumors can be treated and resolved with foscarnet (Foscavir), a drug that is approved to treat CMV disease. KS can occur anywhere on the skin, on any mucous membrane, and on internal organs such as intestines and lungs. It causes lesions which may ulcerate and become secondarily infected. KS has been treated with radiation, localized chemotherapy injections, cryotherapy, and systemic drug therapies. Experimental and currently used drugs are detailed.",M2

The partial analysis of nucleotide sequence showed that HHV-8 was closely related to herpesvirus saimiri and Epstein-Barr virus, two members of Gammaherpesvirinae sub-family. So far, the virus has been neither isolated nor observed using electron microscopy. It is only detected by means of polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and molecular hybridization. HHV-8 detection in human tissues is strongly associated with three diseases: Kaposi's sarcoma, body-cavity-based lymphomas and Castleman's disease. This association raises the question of the causative role of HHV-8 in the occurrence of these three disease.",M2
8825757,"Human herpesvirus-8: detection of novel herpesvirus-like DNA sequences in Kaposi's sarcoma and other lesions.Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) is a malignancy suspected of having an infectious etiology. Unique viral DNA sequences were recognized in KS lesions, using a novel technique that identifies small differences between two complex genomes. The virus had homology with the herpesvirus family, especially Epstein Barr virus (EBV), yet it was distinct from the known herpesviridae, and was appropriately named human herpesvirus 8 (<e>HHV-8</e>) or Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV). HHV-8 DNA sequences were present in AIDS-associated KS, classic KS, African endemic KS, Mediterranean KS, iatrogenic KS, and KS in homosexual men without HIV infection. HHV-8 DNA sequences were also present in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of KS+ patients; body-cavity-based lymphomas in HIV positive patients without KS; and in tissue from a number of malignant and non-malignant lesions in patients without HIV infection. The role of HHV-8 in KS and other malignancies is not known. Viruses are notoriously trophic for lesional tissue. Therefore, in order to determine the role of HHV-8 in KS pathogenesis, HHV-8 needs to be isolated and shown to induce immortalization in a suitable system. Regardless of its role in KS, another human herpesvirus has been discovered, and the extent of its pathogenicity needs to be uncovered.",M2

We sought to identify the target cell of this virus in KS tumour tissue. Using PCR in situ hybridization (PCR-ISH) we show that KSHV/HHV-8 is present in the flat endothelial cells lining vascular spaces of KS lesions as well as in typical KS spindle cells. These findings show that KSHV/HHV-8 is present in the cell types thought to represent neoplastic cells in these lesions.",M2
