20538133,"Serum parameters and echocardiographic predictors of death or need for transplant in newborns, children, and young adults with heart failure.For children admitted with symptomatic heart failure (HF), the risk of death/need for transplantation (D/Tx) is high. Data from adult studies suggest serum measurements, such as percent lymphocytes, are valuable predictors of outcomes. The aim of this study was to identify risk factors for D/Tx in hospitalized pediatric patients with symptomatic HF. Retrospective analysis of children admitted to an academic center from January 1994 to June 2008 with clinical HF was undertaken. The most common cause of HF was dilated cardiomyopathy (58 of 99, 59%). Echocardiographic and serum measurements were collected from admission. Factors independently associated with risk of D/Tx were evaluated by a stepwise multivariate Cox regression model. There were 99 children with 139 hospitalizations. Median age at admission was 3 years (range 0 to 22). Mean systemic ventricular ejection fraction was 23% +/- 11. Risk of D/Tx per hospitalization was 60 of 139 (43%). In multivariate analysis, lymphocytopenia, lower ejection fraction, low serum <e>sodium</e>, and higher serum creatinine were independent predictors of D/Tx. These variables correctly predicted those subjects at risk of D/Tx in 82.1% of cases. Subgroup analysis found that brain natruretic peptide did not improve the model's accuracy markedly. In conclusion, serum measurements (percent lymphocytes, sodium, and creatinine) and echocardiographic assessment routinely obtained at admission are predictive of D/Tx in children hospitalized for HF. Significant lymphocytopenia was predictive of adverse outcomes.",M1
20535994,"[The effect of the environment ion composition upon the blockade of the AMPA receptor channels]It is well known that ion composition significantly affects action of various pharmacological agents. In the present work we studied influence of external <e>sodium</e> on the block of Ca2+ -permeable AMPA receptor channels by dicationic derivative of phenylcyclohexyl IEM-1925. Experiments were performed on native receptors of giant striatal interneurones isolated from the rat brain slices. Registrations were done with the aid of whole-cell patch clamp technique. We found that partial substitution of external sodium by sucrose potentiated the blocking action of IEM-1925. The effect was voltage-dependent, being more pronounced at hyperpolarized voltages. The analysis of kinetics of the IEM-1925 action demonstrated that lowering of external sodium facilitated blocking action, whereas stability of the drug-channel complex remained unaffected. We conclude that the current carrying sodium ions compete with blocking cation IEM-1925 for an intrapore binding site.",M1
20519529,"The RCK2 domain uses a coordination site present in Kir channels to confer <e>sodium</e> sensitivity to Slo2.2 channels.Slo2 Na(+)-activated potassium channels are widely expressed in neurons and other cells, such as kidney, heart, and skeletal muscle. Although their important physiological roles continue to be appreciated, molecular determinants responsible for sensing intracellular Na(+) remain unknown. Here we report identification of an Na(+) regulatory site, similar to an Na(+) coordination motif described in Kir channels, localized in the RCK2 domain of Slo2.2 channels. Molecular simulations of the homology-modeled Slo2.2 RCK2 domain provided structural insights into the organization of this Na(+) coordination site. Furthermore, free energy calculations reproduced the experimentally derived monovalent cation selectivity. Our results suggest that Slo2.2 and Kir channels share a similar mechanism to coordinate Na(+). The localization of an Na(+) sensor within the RCK2 domain of Slo2.2 further supports the role of RCK (regulators of conductance of K(+)) domains of Slo channels in coupling ion sensing to channel gating.",M1
20519416,"Alveolar but not intravenous S-ketamine inhibits alveolar <e>sodium</e> transport and lung fluid clearance in rats.BACKGROUND: S-ketamine is frequently used for analgosedation, especially during sepsis and cardiovascular instability. Because S-ketamine blocks voltage-gated sodium (Na+) channels in neurons and skeletal muscle, it is conceivable that S-ketamine also blocks alveolar epithelial Na+ channels that are crucial for alveolar fluid clearance (AFC). We studied the effects of alveolar and IV S-ketamine on transalveolar Na+ transport and AFC, and investigated whether IV S-ketamine enters the alveolar space in response to endotoxemia-induced pulmonary inflammation. METHODS: Cultured rat alveolar type II (ATII) cells were exposed to S-ketamine and/or the Na+ channel blocker amiloride (100 microM) and transepithelial transport indicated by short circuit current (ISC) was measured in Ussing chambers. AFC was measured in fluid-instilled lungs of anesthetized rats with or without amiloride added to the instillate. S-ketamine was either added to the instillate or injected IV. To induce mild lung injury that might favor the appearance of IV S-ketamine at the alveolar surface, endotoxemia was induced by IV lipopolysaccharide (7.5 mg/kg). RESULTS: In ATII cells, S-ketamine (25 microg/mL) caused a decrease of ISC regardless of apical (-18.9%+/- 1.4%; P &lt; 0.001) or basolateral (-20.4% +/- 3.7%; P &lt; 0.001) application. In ATII cells pretreated with amiloride, addition of apical or basolateral S-ketamine did not decrease ISC. AFC was approximately 8% per 30 minutes in control rats. S-ketamine (5 microg/mL) in the instillate reduced AFC to 1.1% +/- 1.5% (P = 0.04) by decreasing amiloride-sensitive transepithelial Na+ transport. Intravenous S-ketamine (20 mg/kg) did not affect AFC (P = 0.31). In the presence of lipopolysaccharide-induced inflammation, the concentration of IV-injected S-ketamine in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid remained below the concentration that inhibited AFC. CONCLUSIONS: Although exposure of the rat alveolar epithelium to S-ketamine decreases amiloride-sensitive transalveolar Na+ transport and AFC, IV S-ketamine at clinically relevant bolus concentrations does not affect AFC, even in the presence of mild lung injury.",M1
20517944,"<e>Sodium</e> intake and intraventricular hemorrhage in the preterm infant.OBJECTIVE: Hypernatremia is associated with intracranial hemorrhage in term infants. The etiology of intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants is multifactorial. We aimed to characterize the associations between sodium intake, hypernatremia, and intraventricular hemorrhage in preterm infants. METHODS: The charts of 722 preterm infants with a birth weight &lt;or=1.5kg admitted to a tertiary care neonatal intensive care unit from 2002 to 2006 were retrospectively reviewed for daily sodium and fluid intake, weight loss, serum sodium concentrations, gender, gestational age, pneumothorax, hyper- or hypocarbia, severity of illness, and cranial imaging. A multivariate logistic model was used to adjust for risk factors and determine associations between sodium intake, hypernatremia, and intraventricular hemorrhage. RESULTS: Grade II to IV intraventricular hemorrhage was associated with increased sodium intake on each of the first 3 days following birth. The association remained after controlling for gestational age, severity of illness, respiratory factors, and gender. The association of high sodium intake with intraventricular hemorrhage was of similar magnitude to traditionally recognized risk factors such as pneumothorax. INTERPRETATION: Increasing intake of sodium appears to be a modifiable risk factor for intraventricular hemorrhage in very low birth weight infants.",M1
20489711,"Ion-triggered spring-like motion of a double helicate accompanied by anisotropic twisting.Molecules that extend and contract under external stimuli are used to build molecular machines with nanomechanical functions. But although common in biological systems, such extension and contraction motions with helical molecules have rarely been accompanied by unidirectional twisting in synthetic systems. Here we show that <e>sodium</e> ions can trigger the reversible anisotropic twisting of an enantiomeric double-stranded helicate, without racemization. An optically active helicate consisting of two tetraphenol strands bridged by two spiroborate groups sandwiches a sodium ion. On removal of the central sodium-through addition of a cryptand [2.2.1] in solution-the double helicate extends. Crystallographic and nuclear magnetic resonance studies reveal that the extended helicate is over twice as long as the initial molecule, and is twisted in the right-handed direction. Circular dichroism analysis suggests that the twisting doesn't affect the helicate's handedness. This anisotropic extension-contraction process is reversibly triggered by the successive addition and removal of sodium ions in solution.",M1
20453900,"Improving the culturability of freshwater bacteria using FW70, a low-nutrient solid medium amended with <e>sodium</e> pyruvate.Bacterial culture based on the use of plate media is an effective method for investigating bacterial populations in the environment. To improve the culturability of bacteria from freshwater lakes, we developed a new medium, FW70, which contains sodium pyruvate, casamino acids, and lake water and is solidified using gellan gum. To test the importance of these components, we prepared a series of media in which one or more of the components was absent. Water was sampled 31 times from 3 Japanese lakes and was passed through a membrane filter (pore size = 0.45 microm) to remove fast-growing microbes before the water was spread onto the plates. In most cases, significantly larger numbers of bacterial colonies were detected on FW70 than on other media. Furthermore, to test the practicality of FW70, we compared it with standard nutrient agar and R2A agar. In all cases, the culturability was significantly greater on FW70 than on standard nutrient agar or R2A agar. Some isolates recovered by means of FW70 belonged to bacteria that had not previously been classified. These results suggest that FW70 improves the culturability of freshwater bacteria and can be used for the isolation of novel bacteria as a result of the filtration step.",M1
20453771,"Clinical experience using 5% hypertonic saline as a safe alternative fluid for use in trauma.BACKGROUND: Published experience of hypertonic saline (HTS) use in resuscitation has described the use of commercially unavailable 7.5% solutions. The purpose of this study was to compare our experience with the administration of commercially available 5% HTS solution with that of well-matched controls who did not receive HTS. METHODS: Prospective observational study of 51 trauma patients receiving 500 mL of 5% HTS during initial resuscitation. Patients who received HTS were 1:2 matched using age, gender, Injury Severity Score, Coma Score, Head Abbreviated Injury Scale, and injury mechanism to trauma patients who did not receive HTS. The laboratory values and outcomes of the two groups were compared. RESULTS: Patients receiving HTS demonstrated no difference from the matched cohort in mean pH, international normalized ratio, or p/f ratios at 8 hours or 24 hours. The mean serum <e>sodium</e> of the HTS group was higher than controls at 8 hours (143.1 vs. 150.1 mg/dL, p &lt; 0.001) and remained significantly more increased for 3 days without any adverse sequelae related to hypernatremia. No difference in mortality was noted between the two groups. A trend in decreased mortality was observed in patients with Coma Score &lt;or=8 and Head Abbreviated Injury Scale score &gt;or=3 (25.0% vs. 42.5%). The mean ventilator days were 7.3 for HTS group and 9.2 for the non-HTS group. CONCLUSION: Although serum sodium remained increased for several days after HTS administration, no adverse sequelae as a result of hypernatremia resulted. Commercially available 5% HTS solution is safe for use in the resuscitation of trauma patients and may improve outcomes in a selected subset of patients with head injury.",M1
20448142,"Luminal leptin inhibits L-glutamine transport in rat small intestine: involvement of ASCT2 and B0AT1.L-glutamine is the primary metabolic fuel for enterocytes. Glutamine from the diet is transported into the absorptive cells by two <e>sodium</e>-dependent neutral amino acid transporters present at the apical membrane: ASCT2/SLC1A5 and B(0)AT1/SLC6A19. We have demonstrated that leptin is secreted into the stomach lumen after a meal and modulates the transport of sugars after binding to its receptors located at the brush border of the enterocytes. The present study was designed to address the effect of luminal leptin on Na(+)-dependent glutamine (Gln) transport in rat intestine and identify the transporters involved. We found that 0.2 nM leptin inhibited uptake of Gln and phenylalanine (Phe) (substrate of B(0)AT1) using everted intestinal rings. In Ussing chambers, 10 mM Gln absorption followed as Na(+)-induced short-circuit current was inhibited by leptin in a dose-dependent manner (maximum inhibition at 10 nM; I(C50) = approximately 0.1 nM). Phe absorption was also decreased by leptin. Western blot analysis after 3-min incubation of the intestinal loops with 10 mM Gln, showed marked increase of ASCT2 and B(0)AT1 protein in the brush-border membrane that was reduced by rapid preincubation of the intestinal lumen with 1 nM leptin. Similarly, the increase in ASCT2 and B(0)AT1 gene expression induced by 60-min incubation of the intestine with 10 mM Gln was strongly reduced after a short preincubation period with leptin. Altogether these data demonstrate that, in rat, leptin controls the active Gln entry through reduction of both B(0)AT1 and ASCT2 proteins traffic to the apical plasma membrane and modulation of their gene expression.",M1
20444953,"Salt sensitivity is associated with insulin resistance, sympathetic overactivity, and decreased suppression of circulating renin activity in lean patients with essential hypertension.BACKGROUND: The mechanisms by which a derangement of glucose metabolism causes high blood pressure are not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to clarify the relation between salt sensitivity of blood pressure and insulin resistance, which are important subcharacteristics of hypertension and impaired glucose metabolism, respectively. Effects on the renin-angiotensin and sympathetic nervous systems were also studied. DESIGN: The state of glucose metabolism was assessed by a hyperinsulinemic euglycemic glucose clamp technique and a 75-g oral-glucose-tolerance test in 24 essential hypertensive patients who were lean and without diabetes or chronic kidney disease. The subjects were classified as salt-sensitive or salt-resistant on the basis of the difference (Delta mean blood pressure &gt; or =5%) between 24-h ambulatory blood pressure monitoring results on the seventh day of low-salt (34 mmol/d) and high-salt (252 mmol/d) diets. Urine and blood samples were collected for analyses. RESULTS: There was a robust inverse relation between the glucose infusion rate (GIR) and the salt sensitivity index. The GIR correlated directly with the change in urinary <e>sodium</e> excretion and was inversely related to the change in hematocrit when the salt diet was changed from low to high, which is indicative of salt and fluid retention in salt-sensitive subjects. The GIR also showed an inverse correlation compared with the changes in urinary norepinephrine excretion, plasma renin activity, and plasma aldosterone concentration. CONCLUSIONS: Salt sensitivity of blood pressure is strongly associated with insulin resistance in lean, essential hypertensive patients. Hyperinsulinemia, sympathetic overactivation, and reduced suppression of the renin-angiotensin system may play a role in this relation.",M1
20442054,"[Severe hyponatremia and comatose state during colonoscopy preparation]Authors present a case of an 83 years old female, who suddenly became unconscious and had seizures, during bowel preparation for colonoscopy, but before taking the <e>sodium</e> phosphate purgative. Laboratory investigations revealed severe hyponatremia. Hypertonic saline infusion was administered, the electrolyte disturbance returned to normal, the patient slowly regained her consciousness and her disorientation started to improve gradually. Hyponatremia was likely induced by stress provoked ADH secretion, due to the patients' fear for bowel cleansing and colonoscopy, and by large fluid intake consumed as  misunderstanding  of the instructions. The aim of this case presentation is to call attention to the risks of colonoscopy preparation, which threaten those patients who follow the physicians' instructions exorbitantly, and to demonstrate the treatment of the acute hyponatremia.",M1
20437792,"Preoperative hyponatremia and cardiopulmonary bypass: yet another factor for cerebral dysfunction?Hyponatremia is common in patients prior to cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), usually secondary to diuretic therapy. Rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia, which potentially occurs on commencing CPB, may in susceptible patients result in central pontine myelomatosis. There are three parts to this study. Part 1: Patients (n = 170) undergoing CPB with preoperative hyponatremia were analyzed by degree of hyponatremia, additive EuroSCORE, length of stay - intensive care and total hospital, and mortality. Part 2: <e>Sodium</e> concentrations of different prime constituents used clinically were collated from the literature. Part 3: Mathematical modeling of the effects of patient size, sex, preoperative hemoglobin, prime solution, and prime volume with regard to the effect on serum sodium during cardiopulmonary bypass was analyzed, assuming a preoperative serum sodium of 125 mmol/L. Part 1: Patients with preoperative hyponatremia, even after matching by additive EuroSCORE, have longer length of stay - intensive care and total hospital, but not significantly different mortality rates. Part 2: Sodium concentrations of different primes used clinically varied from 0 mmol/L to 160 mmol/L. Part 3: Mathematical modeling revealed that patient size, sex, preoperative hemoglobin, prime solution, and prime volume all can exert a significant effect on serum sodium on initiation of cardiopulmonary bypass. Further work is needed to evaluate the roles of sudden changes in serum sodium, with regard to a rapid correction of chronic hyponatremia, or the rapid creation of acute hyponatremia, and cerebral outcomes in patients undergoing CPB.",M1
20432725,"[Effect of ascorbic acid on the intestinal transport of glycine in chick]The effect of different doses of ascorbic acid on the absorptive functions of the gut has been investigated in chicks. The study describes evidence for the existence of a H+/glycine symport system in chick intestinal brush border, because in <e>sodium</e>-free conditions acidification of the apical medium with ascorbic acid causes a dose-dependent stimulation of glycine absorption. Under the above circumstances, potassium acts as a non-essential activator of H+-dependence glycine cotransport. Our results also suggest that glycine uptake is stimulated in a lesser degree by inward sodium gradient. Ascorbic acid stimulation of glycine uptake from K+- free sodium abundant media was diminished, when the dietary level of ascorbic acid was increased to 2000 mg in 1 kg of food. This may result from conformational change in the Na(-)-dependent glycine transporter protein that lowers glycine binding site affinity induced by the over-acidification of the gut lumen. In addition, there was a possible competition between sodium-dependent glycine and ascorbic acid transporters for sodium.",M1
20429319,"Metabolic abnormalities in patients with recurrent stone formation in a hot territory.OBJECTIVE: This was a cross-sectional study of 150 consecutive patients (105 males and 44 females) with nephrolithiasis. Serum and urine metabolic evaluations were preformed. RESULTS: 70 percent (n=105) of patients were males. Sixty patients (40%) had hypertension. The urine volume of 114 subjects (76%) was less than 1 liter/day. There was an inverse correlation between urine pH and weight of patients (r=-0.48, p=0.001). The prevalence of hypophosphatemia, hypokalemia, hyperuricemia and hypercalcemia was 11% (n=17), 12.6% (n=19), 20% (n=30), and 5% (n=8), respectively. The prevalence of hypercalciuria and hyperuricosuria was 24% (n=36) and 14% (n=21), respectively. The urine calcium significantly correlated with urine <e>sodium</e> (r=0.3, p&lt;0.001) and uric acid (r=0.43, p&lt;0.001). Serum phosphate concentrations were inversely correlated with urine calcium concentrations (r=-0.37, p=0.016). CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that lower urine volume has an important role in nephrolithiasis in hot areas. Higher urine sodium and uric acid and lower serum phosphor correlate with higher urine calcium in stone formers. However, further cohort studies should be performed to establish these findings (Tab. 2, Fig. 3, Ref. 26). Full Text (Free, PDF) www.bmj.sk.",M1
20429274,"[Absorption and fluorescence spectra of hypericin <e>sodium</e> salt in complexes with albumins]The spectra of absorption and fluorescence of hypericin sodium salt (Na-Hy) in organic solvents and in complexes with human serum albumin, bovine serum albumin, and lipoproteins of low and high density have been studied. It was shown that, as the proton donor properties of the solvent enhance, the absorption and fluorescence maxima shift toward the blue region, and as the proton-accepting properties increase, the maxima shift toward the red region. The absorption spectra of complexes of Na-Hy with bovine serum albumin significantly differ from those of complexes of this ligand with human serum albumin, which is evidenced by a lesser width of absorption bands and a lower value of the Stokes shift. The positions of the absorption and fluorescence maxima and the value of the Stokes shift for the complex of Na-Hy with human serum albumin increases when D20 instead of common water is used as a solvent. It was concluded that H-bonds of hypericin play a significant role in the interaction with human serum albumin.",M1
20428113,"G domain dimerization controls dynamin's assembly-stimulated GTPase activity.Dynamin is an atypical GTPase that catalyses membrane fission during clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The mechanisms of dynamin's basal and assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis are unknown, though both are indirectly influenced by the GTPase effector domain (GED). Here we present the 2.0 A resolution crystal structure of a human dynamin 1-derived minimal GTPase-GED fusion protein, which was dimeric in the presence of the transition state mimic GDP.AlF(4)(-).The structure reveals dynamin's catalytic machinery and explains how assembly-stimulated GTP hydrolysis is achieved through G domain dimerization. A <e>sodium</e> ion present in the active site suggests that dynamin uses a cation to compensate for the developing negative charge in the transition state in the absence of an arginine finger. Structural comparison to the rat dynamin G domain reveals key conformational changes that promote G domain dimerization and stimulated hydrolysis. The structure of the GTPase-GED fusion protein dimer provides insight into the mechanisms underlying dynamin-catalysed membrane fission.",M1
20427980,"Dysnatremias in the intensive care unit.Dysnatremias (hypo- and hypernatremia) are common in patients admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) with a prevalence approaching 20-30% in some studies. Recent data reveals that both hypo- and hypernatremia present on admission to or developing in the ICU are independent risk factors for poor prognosis. The origin of hypernatremia in the ICU is often iatrogenic and due to inadequate free water replacement of ongoing water losses. The pathogenesis of hyponatremia in the ICU is more complicated but often is related to the combination of dysregulated arginine vasopressin production and concomitant inappropriate hypotonic fluid administration. Both the dysnatremia itself and the treatment of the electrolyte disturbance can be associated with morbidity and mortality making careful monitoring for and treatment of <e>sodium</e> disorders an imperative in the critically ill patient. Formulae have been devised to guide the therapy of severe hypo- and hypernatremia, but these formulae regard the patient as a closed system and do not take into account ongoing fluid losses that can be highly variable. Thus, a cornerstone of proper therapy is serial measurements of serum and urine electrolytes. The appropriate use of hypertonic (3%) saline in the treatment of hyponatremic encephalopathy has also shown to be very effective and the use of this therapy is reviewed here. Vasopressin receptor antagonists have also been shown to be effective at increasing serum sodium levels in patients with either euvolemic or hypervolemic hyponatremia and represent another therapeutic option. Recent data demonstrates that proper correction of hyponatremia is associated with improved short- and long-term outcomes.",M1

The mesopore size and <e>sodium</e> concentration for the bulky TiO(2)-derived titanate nanotubes were dependent on the treatment conditions on the steam curing process with HCl solutions.

20417342,"Lung fluid movements in hypoxia.Pulmonary edema is a problem of major clinical importance resulting from a persistent imbalance between forces that drive water into the airspace of the lung and the biological mechanisms for its removal. Here, we will first review the fundamental mechanisms implicated in the regulation of lung fluid homeostasis, namely, the Starling forces and the respiratory transepithelial <e>sodium</e> transport. Second, we will discuss the contribution of hypoxia to the perturbation of this fine balance and the role of such perturbations in the development of high-altitude pulmonary edema, a disease characterized by a very high morbidity and mortality. Finally, we will review possible interventions aimed to maintain/restore lung fluid homeostasis and their importance for the prevention/treatment of pulmonary edema.",M1
20417341,"New insights in the pathogenesis of high-altitude pulmonary edema.High-altitude pulmonary edema is a life-threatening condition occurring in predisposed but otherwise healthy individuals. It therefore permits the study of underlying mechanisms of pulmonary edema in the absence of confounding factors such as coexisting cardiovascular or pulmonary disease, and/or drug therapy. There is evidence that some degree of asymptomatic alveolar fluid accumulation may represent a normal phenomenon in healthy humans shortly after arrival at high altitude. Two fundamental mechanisms then determine whether this fluid accumulation is cleared or whether it progresses to HAPE: the quantity of liquid escaping from the pulmonary vasculature and the rate of its clearance by the alveolar respiratory epithelium. The former is directly related to the degree of hypoxia-induced pulmonary hypertension, whereas the latter is determined by the alveolar epithelial <e>sodium</e> transport. Here, we will review evidence that, in HAPE-prone subjects, impaired pulmonary endothelial and epithelial NO synthesis and/or bioavailability may represent a central underlying defect predisposing to exaggerated hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction and, in turn, capillary stress failure and alveolar fluid flooding. We will then demonstrate that exaggerated pulmonary hypertension, although possibly a conditio sine qua non, may not always be sufficient to induce HAPE and how defective alveolar fluid clearance may represent a second important pathogenic mechanism.",M1
20413494,"Molecular basis of alternating access membrane transport by the <e>sodium</e>-hydantoin transporter Mhp1.The structure of the sodium-benzylhydantoin transport protein Mhp1 from Microbacterium liquefaciens comprises a five-helix inverted repeat, which is widespread among secondary transporters. Here, we report the crystal structure of an inward-facing conformation of Mhp1 at 3.8 angstroms resolution, complementing its previously described structures in outward-facing and occluded states. From analyses of the three structures and molecular dynamics simulations, we propose a mechanism for the transport cycle in Mhp1. Switching from the outward- to the inward-facing state, to effect the inward release of sodium and benzylhydantoin, is primarily achieved by a rigid body movement of transmembrane helices 3, 4, 8, and 9 relative to the rest of the protein. This forms the basis of an alternating access mechanism applicable to many transporters of this emerging superfamily.",M1
20409481,"Single-molecule TPM studies on the conversion of human telomeric DNA.Human telomere contains guanine-rich (G-rich) tandem repeats of single-stranded DNA sequences at its 3' tail. The G-rich sequences can be folded into various secondary structures, termed G-quadruplexes (G4s), by Hoogsteen basepairing in the presence of monovalent cations (such as Na+ and K+). We developed a single-molecule tethered particle motion (TPM) method to investigate the unfolding process of G4s in the human telomeric sequence AGGG(TTAGGG)3 in real time. The TPM method monitors the DNA tether length change caused by formation of the G4, thus allowing the unfolding process and structural conversion to be monitored at the single-molecule level. In the presence of its antisense sequence, the folded G4 structure can be disrupted and converted to the unfolded conformation, with apparent unfolding time constants of 82 s and 3152 s. We also observed that the stability of the G4 is greatly affected by different monovalent cations. The folding equilibrium constant of G4 is strongly dependent on the salt concentration, ranging from 1.75 at 5 mM Na+ to 3.40 at 15 mM Na+. Earlier spectral studies of Na+- and K+-folded states suggested that the spectral conversion between these two different folded structures may go through a structurally unfolded intermediate state. However, our single-molecule TPM experiments did not detect any totally unfolded intermediate within our experimental resolution when <e>sodium</e>-folded G4 DNA molecules were titrated with high-concentration, excess potassium ions. This observation suggests that a totally unfolding pathway is likely not the major pathway for spectral conversion on the timescale of minutes, and that interconversion among folded states can be achieved by the loop rearrangement. This study also demonstrates that TPM experiments can be used to study conformational changes in single-stranded DNA molecules.",M1
20405980,"First principles multielectron mixed quantum/classical simulations in the condensed phase. II. The charge-transfer-to-solvent states of <e>sodium</e> anions in liquid tetrahydrofuran.Gas-phase atomic anions lack bound electronic excited states, yet in solution many of these anions exhibit intense absorption bands due to the presence of excited states, referred to as charge-transfer-to-solvent (CTTS) states that are bound only by the presence of the solvent. CTTS spectra thus serve as delicate probes of solute-solvent interactions, but the fact that they are created by the interactions of a solute with many solvent molecules makes them a challenge to describe theoretically. In this paper, we use mixed quantum/classical molecular dynamics with the two-electron Fourier-grid (2EFG) electronic structure method presented in the previous paper [W. J. Glover, R. E. Larsen, and B. J. Schwartz, J. Chem. Phys. 132, 144101 (2010)] to simulate the CTTS states of a sodium anion in liquid tetrahydrofuran, Na(-)/THF. Since our 2EFG method is based on configuration interaction with single and double excitations in a grid basis, it allows for an exact treatment of the two valence electrons of the sodium anion. To simulate Na(-)/THF, we first develop a new electron-THF pseudopotential, and we verify the accuracy of this potential by reproducing the experimental absorption spectrum of an excess electron in liquid THF with near quantitative accuracy. We also are able to reproduce the CTTS spectrum of Na(-)/THF and find that the CTTS states of Na(-) exhibit a Rydberg-like progression due to the pre-existing long-range solvent polarization around the anion. We also find that the CTTS states are highly mixed with the disjoint electronic states supported by naturally occurring solvent cavities that exist in liquid THF. This mixing explains why the solvated electrons that are ejected following CTTS excitation appear with their equilibrium absorption spectrum. The mixing of the CTTS and solvent-cavity states also explains why the recombination of the electron and its geminate Na(0) partner occurs on slower time scales when photoexciting in the blue compared to in the red of the CTTS band: blue excitation accesses CTTS states whose charge densities lies further from the position of the anion, whereas red excitation accesses CTTS states that lie primarily within the anion's first solvation shell. Finally, we see that the radial character of the CTTS states near the Na(+) core matches that of Na(0), explaining why the spectrum of this species appears instantly after photoexciting Na(-).",M1
20405979,"First principles multielectron mixed quantum/classical simulations in the condensed phase. I. An efficient Fourier-grid method for solving the many-electron problem.We introduce an efficient multielectron first-principles based electronic structure method, the two-electron Fourier-grid (2EFG) approach, that is particularly suited for use in mixed quantum/classical simulations of condensed-phase systems. The 2EFG method directly solves for the six-dimensional wave function of a two-electron Hamiltonian in a Fourier-grid representation such that the effects of electron correlation and exchange are treated exactly for both the ground and excited states. Due to the simplicity of a Fourier-grid representation, the 2EFG is readily parallelizable and we discuss its computational implementation in a distributed-memory parallel environment. We show our method is highly efficient, being able to find two-electron wave functions in approximately 20 s on a modern desktop computer for a calculation this is equivalent to full configuration interaction (FCI) in a basis of 17 million Slater determinants. We benchmark the accuracy of the 2EFG by applying it to two electronic structure test problems: the harmonium atom and the <e>sodium</e> dimer. We find that even with a modest grid basis size, our method converges to the analytically exact solutions of harmonium in both the weakly and strongly correlated electron regimes. Our method also reproduces the low-lying potential energy curves of the sodium dimer to a similar level of accuracy as a valence CI calculation, thus demonstrating its applicability to molecular systems. In the following paper [W. J. Glover, R. E. Larsen, and B. J. Schwartz, J. Chem.

20404058,"Cardiac dysfunction in HgCl2-induced nephrotic syndrome.The experimental model of HgCl(2) injection is characterized by a systemic autoimmune disease which leads to the development of nephrotic syndrome (NS). NS seems to be accompanied by cardiovascular alterations, since patients with NS present an increased incidence in cardiac disease. The aim of our work was to study the effects of HgCl(2)-induced NS on myocardial function and morphometry. Normotensive Brown-Norway rats were injected with HgCl(2) (1 mg/kg, HgCl(2) group; n = 6, subcutaneous) or the vehicle (control group; n = 6, subcutaneous) on days 0, 2, 4, 7, 9 and 11. The animals were placed in metabolic cages for evaluation of urinary excretion of noradrenaline, <e>sodium</e>, total proteins, albumin and creatinine. Fourteen and 21 days after the first HgCl(2) injection, left ventricle (LV) hemodynamics was evaluated through pressure micromanometers in basal and isovolumetric heartbeats. The heart and gastrocnemius muscle weights and tibial length were also examined. In an additional group of animals cardiac dimensions and ejection fraction were assessed by echocardiography and LV apoptosis and fibrosis were studied. HgCl(2)-injected rats presented proteinuria, albuminuria, hyperlipidemia, anemia, sodium retention and ascites at day 14. These alterations were accompanied by LV hemodynamic changes only in isovolumetric heartbeats. Similarly, on day 21, HgCl(2)-injected rats presented proteinuria, albuminuria, hyperlipidemia, anemia, but no sodium retention or ascites. These animals presented LV systolic and diastolic dysfunction in both basal and isovolumetric heartbeats, as well as cardiac atrophy, LV fibrosis and an increase in myocyte apoptosis. In conclusion, HgCl(2)-induced NS is accompanied by LV dysfunction and can be a promising model for studying the link between NS and cardiac disease.",M1
20397114,"An ironman triathlon does not lead to a change in body mass in female triathletes.In 16 female nonprofessional Ironman triathletes, body mass, percent body fat, and skeletal muscle mass were determined before and after an Ironman race in order to detect changes. Selected hematological and urinary variables as well as percent total body water were measured in order to quantify a change in hydration status. Body mass, skeletal muscle mass, percent body fat, and percent body water did not change (p &gt; 0.05). Plasma volume increased significantly by 8.1 (13.7) % (p &lt; 0.05). The significant increase in plasma volume, plasma urea concentration, and urinary specific gravity after the race was associated with a significant fall in hematocrit and plasma <e>sodium</e> concentration (p &lt; 0.05). In contrast to studies of male Ironman triathletes, we could not detect a decrease in body mass in female Ironman triathletes. The statistically insignificant loss of 0.6 kg in body mass was smaller than reported in studies of male athletes.",M1
20393620,"[The peritoneal kinetic study performed with hypertonic glucose permits better evaluation of UF capacity and determination of sieving of <e>sodium</e>]INTRODUCTION: The use of solutions containing hypertonic glucose (3.86%/4.25%) has been postulated as the method of choice for study the peritoneal function, and permits a better evaluation of the ultrafiltration (UF) capacity. OBJECTIVE: The aim of our study was to analyze the UF capacity and its relation with the peritoneal permeability and sieving of sodium, performing the peritoneal kinetic study with hypertonic glucose solutions. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We performed 184 peritoneal kinetic studies with hypertonic glucose solutions in stable patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), with a mean time on PD of 16 +/- 22 months. We measured the mass transfer coefficient of creatinine (CrMTC), dialysate to plasma ratio of creatinine (D/PCr), UF capacity and sieving of sodium at 60 minutes (difNa60). RESULTS: The mean values were: CrMTC: 9.1 +/- 4.5 ml/min, D/PCr: 0.71 +/- 0.09, UF 759 +/- 233 ml/4 h and difNa60: 4.7 +/- 2.3. The best multivariate model that predicts the UF capacity included: difNa60, CrMTC, age and time on PD (r = 0.57; p &gt; 0.0001). In patients with UF lower than 600 ml/4 h (Percentil 25) the correlation between UF and CrMTC was lost, but remains the correlation with difNa60 (r = 0.48). The patients with previous peritonitis (n = 38) showed no differences in UF, CrMTC or D/Pcr, but the had lower difNa60 (3.7 +/- 2.8 vs. 4.9 +/- 2.1; p = 0.002) than the remaining patients. CONCLUSIONS: The peritoneal kinetic study performed with hypertonic glucose allows to standardize the UF capacity and by determination of sieving of sodium, the early detection of water transport alterations, before the UF capacity and small solutes permeability alteration develops.",M1
20392930,"Functional characterization of mouse <e>sodium</e>/glucose transporter type 3b.Despite belonging to a family of sugar cotransporters, human sodium/glucose transporter type 3 (hSGLT3) does not transport sugar, but it depolarizes the cell in the presence of extracellular sugar, and thus it has been suggested to work as a sugar sensor. In the human genome there is one SGLT3 gene, yet in mouse there are two. In this study we cloned one of them, mouse SGLT3b (mSGLT3b) and characterized the protein. We found that mSGLT3b has low affinity for sugars, as does hSGLT3, but surprisingly, mSGLT3b transports sugar, although the sugar transport is not as tightly coupled to cations as in SGLT1. Moreover, the sugar specificity of mSGLT3b has characteristics reminiscent of both SGLT1 and hSGLT3: mSGLT3b does not respond to galactose, similar to hSGLT3, but neither does it respond to 1-deoxynojirimycin, unlike hSGLT3 but similar to SGLT1. mSGLT3b has low apparent affinities for sugar and Na(+) and, furthermore, displays pre-steady-state currents, which in SGLT1 report on conformational changes in the protein. Finally, phlorizin, the typical inhibitor of SGLT proteins, also inhibits mSGLT3b. In summary, although mSGLT3b has some characteristics that resemble SGLT1 and others that are similar to hSGLT3, its low sugar affinity and uncoupled sugar transport lead us to conclude that mSGLT3b likely functions as a physiological glucose sensor similar to hSGLT3.",M1
20392812,"Chronic hyponatremia impairs memory in rats: effects of vasopressin antagonist tolvaptan.The effects of stable chronic hyponatremia on the central nervous system are largely unknown, clinically, or in experimental animals. The aim of this study was to identify and characterize these effects in rats. Tolvaptan, a vasopressin V(2) receptor antagonist, was used to correct hyponatremia and determine any potential benefits of such treatment in this condition. Stable chronic hyponatremia was induced by combination of the continuous vasopressin V(2) receptor stimulation and liquid food intake. The hyponatremic rats did not exhibit significant changes in general symptoms or neurological functions assessed by modified Irwin's method, or in motor function assessed by the rotarod test. In passive avoidance test, however, rats with moderate and severe hyponatremia had significantly reduced step-through latency, indicating impairment in memory. This reduced step-through latency was improved by the treatment of tolvaptan (0.25-8 mg/kg daily doses), a vasopressin V(2) receptor antagonist. This improvement is associated with normalization of plasma <e>sodium</e> concentrations in hyponatremic rats. In conclusion, these data suggest that chronic hyponatremia may impair memory, and treatments that normalize sodium level, such as vasopressin V(2) receptor antagonists, may be beneficial to patients with hyponatremia.",M1
20389022,"The Na+-dependent chloride-bicarbonate exchanger SLC4A8 mediates an electroneutral Na+ reabsorption process in the renal cortical collecting ducts of mice.Regulation of <e>sodium</e> balance is a critical factor in the maintenance of euvolemia, and dysregulation of renal sodium excretion results in disorders of altered intravascular volume, such as hypertension. The amiloride-sensitive epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is thought to be the only mechanism for sodium transport in the cortical collecting duct (CCD) of the kidney. However, it has been found that much of the sodium absorption in the CCD is actually amiloride insensitive and sensitive to thiazide diuretics, which also block the Na-Cl cotransporter (NCC) located in the distal convoluted tubule. In this study, we have demonstrated the presence of electroneutral, amiloride-resistant, thiazide-sensitive, transepithelial NaCl absorption in mouse CCDs, which persists even with genetic disruption of ENaC. Furthermore, hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ) increased excretion of Na+ and Cl- in mice devoid of the thiazide target NCC, suggesting that an additional mechanism might account for this effect. Studies on isolated CCDs suggested that the parallel action of the Na+-driven Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (NDCBE/SLC4A8) and the Na+-independent Cl-/HCO3- exchanger (pendrin/SLC26A4) accounted for the electroneutral thiazide-sensitive sodium transport. Furthermore, genetic ablation of SLC4A8 abolished thiazide-sensitive NaCl transport in the CCD. These studies establish what we believe to be a novel role for NDCBE in mediating substantial Na+ reabsorption in the CCD and suggest a role for this transporter in the regulation of fluid homeostasis in mice.",M1
20375644,"[Diagnostic usefulness of the random urine Na/K ratio in cirrhotic patients with ascites: a pilot study]BACKGROUND/AIMS: Twenty-four hour urinary <e>sodium</e> excretion (24-h UNa) of greater than 78 mmol/day is important in the management of cirrhotic ascites. Although the random urine sodium-to-potassium ratio (UNa/K) is strongly correlated with 24-h UNa, and approximately 95% of patients with a random UNa/K greater than 1 have 24-h UNa greater than 78 mmol, few data have been published on the correlation between 24-h UNa and random UNa/K. We evaluated diagnostic value of morning and afternoon random UNa/K (AM UNa/K and PM UNa/K, respectively) with 24-h UNa. METHODS: A total of 42 male patients were enrolled from October 2007 to March 2008. Each patient collected 5 mL of urine twice at random times during 24-h urine collection (at 10-12 a.m. and 3-5 p.m.). ROC curve analysis was performed to evaluate the feasibility of AM and PM UNa/K for differentiating 24-h UNa greater than 78 mmol/day. RESULTS: Forty patients with a 24-h urinary creatinine of greater than 15 mg/kg were analyzed. The 24-h UNa, AM UNa/K, and PM UNa/K were 107.9+/-91.2 mmol (mean+/-SD), 3.44+/-3.64, and 3.97+/-4.60, respectively. When compared with 24-h UNa greater than 78 mmol, AUROC values for AM and PM UNa/K were 0.861 (95% CI, 0.715-0.950) and 0.929 (95% CI, 0.802-0.986), respectively (P=0.0001). No difference was found between the AUROC for AM and PM UNa/K (95% CI, -0.161-0.153, P=0.113). UNa/K greater than 1.25 was sensitive and specific for prediction of 24-h UNa greater than 78 mmol. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that anytime random UNa/K greater than 1.25 is an accurate, cost-effective, and convenient method for replacing 24-h UNa. Large multicentered cohort studies are needed to confirm our results.",M1
20371222,"Triuret as a potential hypokalemic agent: Structure characterization of triuret and triuret-alkali metal adducts by mass spectrometric techniques.Triuret (also known as carbonyldiurea, dicarbamylurea, or 2,4-diimidotricarbonic diamide) is a byproduct of purine degradation in living organisms. An abundant triuret precursor is uric acid, whose level is altered in multiple metabolic pathologies. Triuret can be generated via urate oxidation by peroxynitrite, the latter being produced by the reaction of nitric oxide radical with superoxide radical anion. From this standpoint, an excess production of superoxide radical anions could indirectly favor triuret formation; however very little is known about the potential in vivo roles of this metabolite. Triuret's structure is suggestive of its ability to adopt various conformations and act as a flexible ligand for metal ions. In the current study, HPLC-MS/MS, energy-resolved mass spectrometry, selected ion monitoring, collision-induced dissociation, IRMPD spectroscopy, Fourier transform-ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry and computational methods were employed to characterize the structure of triuret and its metal complexes, to determine the triuret-alkali metal binding motif, and to evaluate triuret affinity toward alkali metal ions, as well as its affinity for Na(+) and K(+) relative to other organic ligands. The most favored binding motif was determined to be a bidentate chelation of triuret with the alkali metal cation involving two carbonyl oxygens. Using the complexation selectivity method, it was observed that in solution triuret has an increased affinity for potassium ions, compared to <e>sodium</e> and other alkali metal ions. We propose that triuret may act as a potential hypokalemic agent under pathophysiological conditions conducive to its excessive formation and thus contribute to electrolyte disorders. The collision- or photo-induced fragmentation channels of deprotonated and protonated triuret, as well as its alkali metal adducts, are likely to mimic the triuret degradation pathways in vivo.",M1
20364881,"Mineralocorticoid receptor antagonism prevents hedonic deficits induced by a chronic <e>sodium</e> appetite.Our laboratory has reported that manipulations that provoke a robust sodium appetite (e.g., sodium depletion, deoxycorticosterone acetate) decrease lateral hypothalamic self-stimulation (LHSS) reward if rats are denied access to hypertonic saline solutions. The following studies investigated the interaction between chronic sodium appetite and the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system on LHSS reward. In Experiment 1, animals treated with the diuretic furosemide (20 mg/kg) when denied access to saline exhibited an increase in the current required to produce 50% of the maximum LHSS response rate (ECu50) 48 hr after extracellular volume depletion. Furosemide-depleted rats that were allowed to drink 0.3 M saline after depletion, or that were treated with the selective mineralocorticoid receptor (MR) antagonist spironolactone, which significantly reduced sodium appetite, did not show ECu50 changes. In Experiment 2 chronic intracerebroventricular administration of the selective MR antagonist RU 28318 (10 microg/microl/hr) prevented decreases in the ECu50 induced by deoxycorticosterone acetate-no salt treatment. We conclude that an unresolved sodium appetite will reduce responding for rewards and that experimental manipulations that reduce sodium appetite (e.g., access to saline or blockade of MR) decrease hedonic deficits.",M1

20355287,"Structural, energetic and dynamical properties of sodiated oligoglycines:  relevance of a polarizable force field.Oligoglycine peptides (from two to ten residues) complexed to the <e>sodium</e> ion were studied by quantum chemical and molecular mechanics calculations to understand their structural and energetic properties. Modeling such systems required the use of a polarizable force field and AMOEBA, as developed by Ren and Ponder [J. Comput. Chem., 2002, 23, 1497], was chosen. Some electrostatic and torsional parameters were re-optimized using a rigorous procedure and validated against both geometric and energetic ab initio data in the gas phase. Molecular dynamics simulations were performed on seven sodiated octa-glycine (G(8)) structures. Structural transitions were generally observed (with the notable exception of the a-helix), leading to new structures that were further proved by ab initio calculations to be of low energies. The main result is that for G(8)-Na(+), there is a compromise between sodium peptide interactions and multiple hydrogen bonding. The accuracy achieved with AMOEBA demonstrates the potential of this force field for the realistic modeling of gaseous peptides.",M1
20338997,"mTOR complex-2 activates ENaC by phosphorylating SGK1.The serum- and glucocorticoid-induced kinase 1 (SGK1) plays a central role in hormone regulation of epithelial <e>sodium</e> (Na+) channel (ENaC)-dependent Na+ transport in the distal nephron. Phosphorylation within a carboxy-terminal domain, designated the hydrophobic motif (HM), determines the activity of SGK1, but the identity of the HM kinase is unknown. Here, we show that the highly conserved serine-threonine kinase mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) is essential for the phosphorylation of the HM of SGK1 and the activation of ENaC. We observed that mTOR, in conjunction with rictor (mTORC2), phosphorylated SGK1 and stimulated ENaC. In contrast, when mTOR assembled with raptor in the rapamycin-inhibited complex (mTORC1), it did not phosphorylate SGK1 or stimulate ENaC. Inhibition of mTOR blocked both SGK1 phosphorylation and ENaC-mediated Na+ transport, whereas specific inhibition of mTORC1 had no effect. Similarly, small hairpin RNA-mediated knockdown of rictor inhibited SGK1 phosphorylation and Na+ current, whereas knockdown of raptor had no effect. Finally, in co-immunoprecipitation experiments, SGK1 interacted selectively with rictor but not with raptor, suggesting selective recruitment of SGK1 to mTORC2. We conclude that mTOR, specifically mTORC2, is the HM kinase for SGK1 and is required for ENaC-mediated Na+ transport, thereby extending our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying Na+ balance.",M1
20335320,"Effects of pH and medullary blood flow on oxygen transport and <e>sodium</e> reabsorption in the rat outer medulla.We used a mathematical model of O(2) transport and the urine concentrating mechanism of the outer medulla of the rat kidney to study the effects of blood pH and medullary blood flow on O(2) availability and Na(+) reabsorption. The model predicts that in vivo paracellular Na(+) fluxes across medullary thick ascending limbs (mTALs) are small relative to transcellular Na(+) fluxes and that paracellular fluxes favor Na(+) reabsorption from the lumen along most of the mTAL segments. In addition, model results suggest that blood pH has a significant impact on O(2) transport and Na(+) reabsorption owing to the Bohr effect, according to which a lower pH reduces the binding affinity of hemoglobin for O(2). Thus our model predicts that the presumed greater acidity of blood in the interbundle regions, where mTALs are located, relative to that in the vascular bundles, facilitates the delivery of O(2) to support the high metabolic requirements of the mTALs and raises the concentrating capability of the outer medulla. Model results also suggest that increases in vascular and tubular flow rates result in disproportional, smaller increases in active O(2) consumption and mTAL active Na(+) transport, despite the higher delivery of O(2) and Na(+). That is, at a sufficiently high medullary O(2) supply, O(2) demand in the outer medulla does not adjust precisely to changes in O(2) delivery.",M1
20299355,"Intercalated cell BK-alpha/beta4 channels modulate <e>sodium</e> and potassium handling during potassium adaptation.The large-conductance, calcium-activated potassium (BK) channels help eliminate potassium in mammals consuming potassium-rich diets. In the distal nephron, principal cells contain BK-alpha/beta1 channels and intercalated cells contain BK-alpha/beta4 channels. We studied whether BK-beta4-deficient mice (Kcnmb4(-/-)) have altered renal sodium and potassium clearances compared with wild-type mice when fed a regular or potassium-rich diet for ten days. We did not detect differences in urinary flow or fractional excretions of potassium (FE(K)) or sodium (FE(Na)) between Kcnmb4-deficient and wild-type mice fed a regular diet. However, a potassium-rich diet led to &gt;4-fold increases in urinary flows for both groups of mice, although Kcnmb4-deficient mice exhibited less urinary flow, higher plasma potassium concentration, more fluid retention, and significantly lower FE(K) and FE(Na) than wild-type mice despite similar plasma aldosterone levels. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed increased basolateral Na-K-ATPase in principal cells of all potassium-adapted mice, but expression of Na-K-ATPase in intercalated cells was &gt;10-fold lower. The size of intercalated cells reduced and luminal volume increased among potassium-adapted wild-type but not Kcnmb4-deficient mice. Paradoxically, this led to increased urinary fluid velocity in potassium-adapted Kcnmb4-deficient mice compared with wild-type mice. Taken together, these data suggest that BK-alpha/beta4 channels in intercalated cells reduce cell size, increasing luminal volume to accommodate higher distal flow rates during potassium adaptation. These changes streamline flow across the principal cells, producing gradients more favorable for potassium secretion and less favorable for sodium reabsorption.",M1
20237237,"COMMD1 downregulates the epithelial <e>sodium</e> channel through Nedd4-2.The epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) is important for the long-term control of Na(+) homeostasis and blood pressure. Our previous studies demonstrated that Copper Metabolism Murr1 Domain-containing protein 1 (COMMD1; previously known as Murr1), a protein involved in copper metabolism, inhibited amiloride-sensitive current in Xenopus laevis oocytes expressing ENaC (J Biol Chem 279: 5429, 2004). In this study, we report that COMMD1 inhibits amiloride-sensitive current in mammalian epithelial cells expressing ENaC, that the COMM domain of COMMD1 is sufficient for this effect, and that knockdown of COMMD1 increases amiloride-sensitive current. COMMD1 is coexpressed with ENaC in rat kidney medulla cells. COMMD1 increased ubiquitin modification of ENaC and decreased its cell surface expression. COMMD1 abolished insulin-stimulated amiloride-sensitive current and attenuated the stimulation of current by activated serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK1). COMMD1 was found to interact with both SGK1 and Akt1/protein kinase B, and knockdown of COMMD1 enhanced the stimulatory effect of both SGK1 and Akt1 on amiloride-sensitive current. COMMD1's effects were reduced in the presence of ENaC proteins containing PY motif mutations, abolished in the presence of a dominant negative form of Nedd4-2, and knockdown of COMMD1 reduced the inhibitory effect of Nedd4-2 on ENaC, but did not enhance current when Nedd4-2 was knocked down. These data suggest that COMMD1 modulates Na(+) transport in epithelial cells through regulation of ENaC cell surface expression and this effect is likely mediated via Nedd4-2.",M1
20237069,"Estimated nutrient intakes from food generally do not meet dietary reference intakes among adult members of Pacific Northwest tribal nations.Diet is influential in the etiology of chronic diseases in many populations including Native Americans. The objective of this report is to present the first comprehensive dietary survey, to our knowledge, of a representative sample of nonpregnant adults from Pacific Northwest tribal nations participating in the Communities Advancing the Studies of Tribal Nations Across the Lifespan (CoASTAL) cohort. Only participants who completed 1-4 d of dietary records and had weights and heights measured in the laboratory were eligible for this analysis (n = 418). Mean nutrient intakes were stratified by gender for the total sample, those with plausibly reported energy intakes (rEI), and those with implausibly rEI. Estimates of nutrient intakes were compared with Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI). Nutrient estimates from NHANES 2001-2002 were used as a reference. Among both men and women, total fat contributed 34-37% of energy intake and saturated fat contributed 11-12% of energy intake. Daily cholesterol intakes ranged from 262 to 442 mg. A majority of men and women were not meeting recommendations for vitamins A, C, and E, magnesium, and <e>sodium</e>. For a majority of the nutrients examined, plausibility resulted in higher mean estimates. The CoASTAL cohort nutrient profile is similar to NHANES 2001-2002, with a majority of DRI recommendations not being met. Adequate dietary intake information may be more important for this population, because Native Americans experience a disproportionate burden for diseases.",M1
20234163,"Cisplatin increases urinary <e>sodium</e> excretion in rats: gender-related differences.OBJECTIVE. There are well-documented reports of cisplatin-associated hyponatremia in the literature, but there are no data on gender-dependent differences. The aim of the present study was to define characteristics of 24-hour urinary sodium excretion in young adult Wistar rats of both genders and to evaluate the gender-related effect of cisplatin. MATERIALS AND METHODS. Twelve control Wistar rats (6 males and 6 females) and 12 cisplatin-treated Wistar rats (6 males and 6 females) after a single and repeated injection of cisplatin (once a day for 3 days) at a dose of 2.5 mg/kg body weight into the caudal vein were examined. The experiment was carried out by measuring 24-h urinary sodium, potassium, chloride, magnesium, creatinine excretion and pH in the urine of age-matched male and female rats. RESULTS. The 24-h urinary sodium excretion, sodium/chloride ratio, and diuresis showed no gender-related differences in control rats. After a single administration of 2.5 mg/kg cisplatin, 24-h urinary sodium excretion was not significantly higher in cisplatin-treated rats than in gender-matched controls. After repeated cisplatin administration, 24-h urinary sodium excretion was significantly higher in cisplatin-treated male rats as compared to matched controls (P&lt;0.05). No such effect was found in cisplatin-treated female rats. CONCLUSION. The study data show that cisplatin enhances urinary sodium excretion in male but not in female rats. The mechanism of such a gender-related effect is not yet clear. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate the mechanism of this pharmacological effect of cisplatin.",M1
20219636,"Neutrophil responses to injury or inflammation impair peripheral gustatory function.The adult peripheral taste system is capable of extensive functional plasticity after injury. Sectioning the chorda tympani (CT), a primary sensory afferent nerve, elicits transient changes in the uninjured, contralateral population of taste receptor cells. Remarkably, the deficits are specific to the <e>sodium</e> transduction pathway. Normal function is quickly restored in the intact nerve, in parallel with an influx of macrophages to both the denervated and uninjured sides of the tongue. However, changing the dietary environment by restricting sodium blocks the macrophage response and prolongs functional alterations. Since the functional deficits occur before macrophages are present in the peripheral taste system, we hypothesized that neutrophils play a role in modulating neural responses in the intact CT. First, the dynamics of the neutrophil response to nerve injury were analyzed in control-fed and sodium-deficient rats. Nerve sectioning briefly increased the number of neutrophils on both the denervated and uninjured sides of the tongue. The low-sodium diet amplified and extended the bilateral neutrophil response to injury, in parallel with the persistent changes in sodium taste function. To test the impact of neutrophils on taste function, we depleted these cells prior to nerve sectioning and recorded neural responses from the intact CT. This treatment restored normal sodium responses in the uninjured nerve. Moreover, recruiting neutrophils to the tongue induced deficits in sodium taste function in both CT nerves. Neutrophils play a critical role in ongoing inflammatory responses in the oral cavity, and may induce changes in taste perception. We also suggest that balanced neutrophil and macrophage responses enable normal neural responses after neural injury.",M1
20219227,"Astrovirus infection induces <e>sodium</e> malabsorption and redistributes sodium hydrogen exchanger expression.Astroviruses are known to be a leading cause of diarrhea in infants and the immunocompromised; however, our understanding of this endemic pathogen is limited. Histological analyses of astrovirus pathogenesis demonstrate clinical disease is not associated with changes to intestinal architecture, inflammation, or cell death. Recent studies in vitro have suggested that astroviruses induce actin rearrangement leading to loss of barrier function. The current study used the type-2 turkey astrovirus (TAstV-2) and turkey poult model of astrovirus disease to examine how astrovirus infection affects the ultrastructure and electrophysiology of the intestinal epithelium. These data demonstrate that infection results in changes to the epithelial ultrastructure, rearrangement of F-actin, decreased absorption of sodium, as well as redistribution of the sodium/hydrogen exchanger 3 (NHE3) from the membrane to the cytoplasm. Collectively, these data suggest astrovirus infection induces sodium malabsorption, possibly through redistribution of specific sodium transporters, which results in the development of an osmotic diarrhea.",M1
20211637,"Thirst and hydration: physiology and consequences of dysfunction.The constant supply of oxygen and nutriments to cells (especially neurons) is the role of the cardiovascular system. The constant supply of water (and <e>sodium</e>) for cardiovascular function is the role of thirst and sodium appetite and kidney function. This physiological regulation ensures that plasma volume and osmolality are maintained within set limits by initiating behaviour and release of hormones necessary to ingest and conserve water and sodium within the body. This regulation is separated into 2 parts; intracellular and extracellular (blood). An increased osmolality draws water from cells into the blood thus dehydrating specific brain osmoreceptors that stimulate drinking and release of anti diuretic hormone (ADH or vasopressin). ADH reduces water loss via lowered urine volume. Extracellular dehydration (hypovolaemia) stimulates specific vascular receptors that signal brain centres to initiate drinking and ADH release. Baro/volume receptors in the kidney participate in stimulating the release of the enzyme renin that starts a cascade of events to produce angiotensin II (AngII), which initiates also drinking and ADH release. This stimulates also aldosterone release which reduces kidney loss of urine sodium. Both AngII and ADH are vasoactive hormones that could work to reduce blood vessel diameter around the remaining blood. All these events work in concert so that the cardiovascular system can maintain a constant perfusion pressure, especially to the brain. Even if drinking does not take place ADH, AngII and aldosterone are still released. Furthermore, it has been observed that treatment of hypertension, obesity, diabetes and cancer can involve renin-AngII antagonists which could suggest that, in humans at least, there may be dysfunction of the thirst regulatory mechanism.",M1
20211600,"<e>Sodium</e>-coupled electrogenic transport of pyroglutamate (5-oxoproline) via SLC5A8, a monocarboxylate transporter.Pyroglutamate, also known as 5-oxoproline, is a structural analog of proline. This amino acid derivative is a byproduct of glutathione metabolism, and is reabsorbed efficiently in kidney by Na(+)-coupled transport mechanisms. Previous studies have focused on potential participation of amino acid transport systems in renal reabsorption of this compound. Here we show that it is not the amino acid transport systems but instead the Na(+)-coupled monocarboxylate transporter SLC5A8 that plays a predominant role in this reabsorptive process. Expression of cloned human and mouse SLC5A8 in mammalian cells induces Na(+)-dependent transport of pyroglutamate that is inhibitable by various SLC5A8 substrates. SLC5A8-mediated transport of pyroglutamate is saturable with a Michaelis constant of 0.36+/-0.04mM. Na(+)-activation of the transport process exhibits sigmoidal kinetics with a Hill coefficient of 1.8+/-0.4, indicating involvement of more than one Na(+) in the activation process. Expression of SLC5A8 in Xenopuslaevis oocytes induces Na(+)-dependent inward currents in the presence of pyroglutamate under voltage-clamp conditions. The concentration of pyroglutamate necessary for induction of half-maximal current is 0.19+/-0.01mM. The Na(+)-activation kinetics is sigmoidal with a Hill coefficient of 2.3+/-0.2. Ibuprofen, a blocker of SLC5A8, suppressed pyroglutamate-induced currents in SLC5A8-expressing oocytes; the concentration of the blocker necessary for causing half-maximal inhibition is 14+/-1microM. The involvement of SLC5A8 can be demonstrated in rabbit renal brush border membrane vesicles by showing that the Na(+)-dependent uptake of pyroglutamate in these vesicles is inhibitable by known substrates of SLC5A8. The Na(+) gradient-driven pyroglutamate uptake was stimulated by an inside-negative K(+) diffusion potential induced by valinomycin, showing that the uptake process is electrogenic.",M1
20209568,"Sensitivity improvement of CE/ESI/MS analysis of gangliosides using a liquid-junction/low-flow interface.Methodology is presented which greatly improves the sensitivity of ganglioside analysis by CE/MS without compromising separation efficiency. In this method, non-volatile additives were removed, where possible, to reduce ion suppression. Specifically, alpha-CD, used to break up ganglioside micelle formation, was replaced with isopropyl alcohol. To reduce ion suppression from <e>sodium</e> ions, ammonium borate was substituted for sodium borate in the preparation of borate buffer. Because borate anions were found to be essential for CE separation, a liquid-junction/low-flow interface was employed to restrict borate anions from entering the ESI ion source. With proper control over the EOF in the connecting capillary, borate anions were controlled to migrate away from the ESI ion source. With these modifications, the sensitivity of CE/MS analysis of gangliosides was improved significantly.",M1
20207815,"Mechanisms of ventricular rate adaptation as a predictor of arrhythmic risk.Protracted QT interval (QTI) adaptation to abrupt heart rate (HR) changes has been identified as a clinical arrhythmic risk marker. This study investigates the ionic mechanisms of QTI rate adaptation and its relationship to arrhythmic risk. Computer simulations and experimental recordings in human and canine ventricular tissue were used to investigate the ionic basis of QTI and action potential duration (APD) to abrupt changes in HR with a protocol commonly used in clinical studies. The time for 90% QTI adaptation is 3.5 min in simulations, in agreement with experimental and clinical data in humans. APD adaptation follows similar dynamics, being faster in mid-myocardial cells (2.5 min) than in endocardial and epicardial cells (3.5 min). Both QTI and APD adapt in two phases following an abrupt HR change: a fast initial phase with time constant &lt; 30 s, mainly related to L-type calcium and slow-delayed rectifier potassium current, and a second slow phase of &gt;2 min driven by intracellular <e>sodium</e> concentration ([Na(+)](i)) dynamics. Alterations in [Na(+)](i) dynamics due to Na(+)/K(+) pump current inhibition result in protracted rate adaptation and are associated with increased proarrhythmic risk, as indicated by action potential triangulation and faster L-type calcium current recovery from inactivation, leading to the formation of early afterdepolarizations. In conclusion, this study suggests that protracted QTI adaptation could be an indicator of altered [Na(+)](i) dynamics following Na(+)/K(+) pump inhibition as it occurs in patients with ischemia or heart failure. An increased risk of cardiac arrhythmias in patients with protracted rate adaptation may be due to an increased risk of early after-depolarization formation.",M1

Extensive N,O-H...O hydrogen bonding utilizing all water H atoms, including four waters of crystallization, provides crystal packing. The structural definition of this novel compound was made possible through the use of synchrotron radiation utilizing a minute fragment (volume approximately 2.4 x 10(-5) mm(-3)) on a beamline optimized for protein data collection. A summary of intra-ring conformations for immucillin structures indicates considerable flexibility while retaining similar intra-ring orientations.",M1
20203161,"Direct effect of methylprednisolone on renal <e>sodium</e> and water transport via the principal cells in the kidney.BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids influence renal concentrating and diluting ability. We tested the hypothesis that methylprednisolone treatment increased renal water and sodium absorption by increased absorption via the aquaporin-2 (AQP2) water channels and the epithelial sodium channels (ENaCs) respectively. METHODS: The effect of methylprednisolone was measured during fasting in a randomized, placebo-controlled, single-blinded cross-over study of 15 healthy humans. The subjects received a standardized diet on day 1, fasted on day 2, and received 500 mg methylprednisolone intravenously on day 3. The effect variables were urinary excretions of AQP2 (u-AQP2), urinary excretion of the beta-fraction of the ENaC (u-ENaC(beta)), cAMP (u-cAMP), prostaglandin E(2) (u-PGE(2)), free water clearance (C(H2O)), and fractional excretion of sodium (FE(Na)), and plasma vasopressin (p-AVP), angiotensin II (p-Ang II), aldosterone (p-Aldo), atrial natriuretic peptide (p-ANP), and brain natriuretic peptide (p-BNP). RESULTS: Methylprednisolone treatment increased u-AQP2, u-ENaC(beta), and p-AVP significantly, but did not change u-cAMP, c(H2O), and FE(Na). P-ANP increased during methylprednisolone treatment, but after the increase in u-AQP2 and u-ENaC(beta). U-PGE(2), p-Ang II, and p-BNP were unchanged. Heart rate increased and diastolic blood pressure fell. CONCLUSIONS: Methylprednisolone increased u-AQP2 and u-ENaC. Neither the AVP-cAMP axis nor changes in the renin-angiotensin-Aldo system, or the natriuretic peptide system seems to bear a causal relationship with the increase in either u-AQP2 or u-ENaC. Most probably, the effect is mediated via a direct effect of methylprednisolone on the principal cells. The lack of decrease in urinary output and sodium reabsorption most likely can be attributed to the diuretic and natriuretic properties of the increased secretion of ANP.",M1
20200151,"<e>Sodium</e>-hydrogen exchanger regulatory factor 1 (NHERF-1) transduces signals that mediate dopamine inhibition of sodium-phosphate co-transport in mouse kidney.Dopamine inhibited phosphate transport in isolated renal brush border membrane vesicles and in cultured renal proximal tubule cells from wild-type but not from NHERF-1 null mice. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments established that NHERF-1 associated with D1-like receptors. In wild-type mice, dopamine stimulated cAMP accumulation and protein kinase C (PKC) activity in renal proximal tubule cells, an effect that was abolished by SCH-23390, a D1-like receptor antagonist. In NHERF-1 null kidney tissue; however, dopamine failed to stimulate either cAMP accumulation or PKC activity. Infection of proximal tubule cells from NHERF-1 null mice with adenovirus-green fluorescent protein-NHERF-1 restored the ability of dopamine to stimulate cAMP and PKC. Finally, in (32)P-labeled wild-type proximal tubule cells and in opossum kidney cells, dopamine increased NHERF-1 phosphorylation at serine 77 of the PDZ I domain of NHERF-1, a site previously shown to attenuate binding of cellular targets including the Npt2a (sodium-dependent phosphate transporter 2a). Together, these studies establish that NHERF-1 plays a key role in dopamine signaling and is also a downstream target of D1-like receptors in the mouse kidney. These studies suggest a novel role for the PDZ adapter protein NHERF-1 in coordinating dopamine signals that inhibit renal phosphate transport.",M1
20199991,"Maintained total body water content and serum <e>sodium</e> concentrations despite body mass loss in female ultra-runners drinking ad libitum during a 100 km race.We investigated in 11 female ultra-runners during a 100 km ultra-run, the association between fluid intake and prevalence of exercise-associated hyponatremia in a cross-sectional study. Athletes drank ad libitum and recorded their fluid intake. They competed at 8.0 (1.0) km/h and finished within 762 (91) min. Fluid intake was 4.1 (1.3) L during the race, equal to 0.3 (0.1) L/h. Body mass decreased by 1.5 kg (p&lt; 0.01); pre race body mass was related to speed in the race (r = -0.78, p&lt; 0.05); and change (Delta) in body mass was not associated with speed in the race. Change in body mass was positively (r = 0.70; p&lt; 0.05), and Delta urinary specific gravity negatively (r = -0.67; p&lt; 0.05), correlated to Delta percent total body water. Changes in body mass were not related to fluid intake during the race. Fluid intake was not correlated to running speed and showed no association with either Delta percent total body water nor Delta [Na] in plasma. Fluid intake showed no relationship with both Delta haematocrit and Delta plasma volume. No exercise-associated hyponatremia occurred. Female ultra- runners consuming fluids ad libitum during the race experienced no fluid overload, and ad libitum drinking protects against exercise-associated hyponatremia. The reported higher incidence of exercise-associated hyponatremia in women is not really a gender effect but due to women being more prone to overdrink.",M1
20199092,"Ions and hydrogen bonding in a hydrophobic environment: CCl(4).It is generally expected that ions in an aqueous ionic solution in contact with a hydrophobic phase enter the hydrophobic phase accompanied by a hydration shell. This expectation suggests that the ion mole fraction in the hydrophobic phase is less than, or at most, equal to that of water. Both gravimetric and spectroscopic evidence shows that for a model hydrophobic phase, carbon tetrachloride, this is not the case: In contact with a 1 M simple salt solution (<e>sodium</e> or potassium halide), the salt concentration in carbon tetrachloride ranges from 1.4 to nearly 3 times that of water. Infrared spectra of the OH stretch region support a model in which water associates with the cation, primarily as water monomers. Salts containing larger, more polarizable anions can form outer-sphere ion pairs that support water dimers, giving rise to a spectral signature at 3440 cm(-1). In CCl(4), the infrared spectral signature of the normally strongly ionized acid HCl clearly shows the presence of molecular HCl. Additionally, the presence of a Q branch for HCl indicates restricted rotational motion. The spectral and gravimetric data provide compelling evidence for ion clusters in the hydrophobic phase, which is a result that may have implications for hydrophobic matter in both biological and environmental systems.",M1
20198610,"Distribution and mobility of phosphates and <e>sodium</e> ions in cheese by solid-state 31P and double-quantum filtered 23Na NMR spectroscopy.The feasibility of solid-state magic angle spinning (MAS) (31)P nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and (23)Na NMR spectroscopy to investigate both phosphates and Na(+) ions distribution in semi-hard cheeses in a non-destructive way was studied. Two semi-hard cheeses of known composition were made with two different salt contents. (31)P Single-pulse excitation and cross-polarization MAS experiments allowed, for the first time, the identification and quantification of soluble and insoluble phosphates in the cheeses. The presence of a relatively 'mobile' fraction of colloidal phosphates was evidenced. The detection by (23)Na single-quantum NMR experiments of all the sodium ions in the cheeses was validated. The presence of a fraction of 'bound' sodium ions was evidenced by (23)Na double-quantum filtered NMR experiments. We demonstrated that NMR is a suitable tool to investigate both phosphates and Na(+) ions distributions in cheeses. The impact of the sodium content on the various phosphorus forms distribution was discussed and results demonstrated that NMR would be an important tool for the cheese industry for the processes controls.",M1
20188910,"Photocurable pH-sensitive membrane for ion-selective field effect transistors.H(+)-ion sensitive ISFETs with photocured polyurethane-based polymer membranes with three different neutral carrier ionophores and four different plasticizers have been studied in 0.05 M TRIS-HCl solutions and in background solutions containing 140 mM of Na(+) ions. The optimised membrane composition showing the best selectivity contains 2.2-2.5 wt.% of the ionophore (tridodecylamine), 36-41 wt.% of a plasticizer, and only 10 mol% of a lipophilic salt KTClPhB. The optimal ionophore/lipophilic salt ratio obtained in this work differs significantly from theoretically recommended for pH-sensitive ion-selective membranes. It is assumed that this is due to the participation of the ionophore (tertiary amine) and lipophilic additives (tetrachlorophenylborate anion) in additional photochemical reactions occurring during irradiation of the membrane matrix. Sensors with the optimised membrane composition showed sufficient sensor selectivity in front of <e>sodium</e> ions for clinical and biomedical applications and the lifetime of more than 3 months.",M1
20187189,"Quantitative <e>sodium</e> MRI of the mouse prostate.A method was developed for quantitative sodium MRI of the mouse prostate at 9.4 T. A small loop-gap radiofrequency coil was constructed and dual-tuned to both the proton and sodium frequencies. The location and boundary of the mouse prostate were localized using high-resolution T(2)-weighted proton images, and sodium images were acquired with 1mm isotropic resolution using a short echo time (0.6 ms) and a long pulse repetition time (300 ms) for sodium density weighting with minimal T(1) and T(2) contrast. Sodium concentration in the prostate was estimated by comparing pixel intensities within the prostate to the pixel intensities in a pair of reference vials with known sodium concentrations, and a radiofrequency field inhomogeneity correction was performed based on field maps of a homogeneous phantom. In a group of five healthy, 5-month-old BALB/c mice, the average sodium concentration within their prostates was measured to be 173 +/- 38 mM. Muscle tissue and bladder were also clearly visible in the sodium images, and their sodium concentrations were estimated to be 40 +/- 15 mM and 210 +/- 72 mM, respectively.",M1
20185666,"A comparison of 3% hypertonic saline and mannitol for brain relaxation during elective supratentorial brain tumor surgery.BACKGROUND: In this study, we compared the effects of 3% hypertonic saline (HTS) and 20% mannitol on brain relaxation during supratentorial brain tumor surgery, intensive care unit (ICU) stays, and hospital days. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, and double-blind study included patients who were selected for elective craniotomy for supratentorial brain tumors. Patients received either 160 mL of 3% HTS (HTS group, n = 122) or 150 mL of 20% mannitol infusion (M group, n = 116) for 5 minutes at the start of scalp incision. The PCO(2) in arterial blood was maintained within 35 to 40 mm Hg, arterial blood pressure was controlled within baseline values +/-20%, and positive fluid balance was maintained intraoperatively at a rate of 2 mL/kg/h. Outcome measures included fluid input, urine output, arterial blood gases, serum <e>sodium</e> concentration, ICU stays, and hospital days. Surgeons assessed the condition of the brain as  tight,   adequate,  or  soft  immediately after opening the dura. RESULTS: Brain relaxation conditions in the HTS group (soft/adequate/tight, n = 58/43/21) were better than those observed in the M group (soft/adequate/tight, n = 39/42/35; P = 0.02). The levels of serum sodium were higher in the HTS group compared with the M group over time (P &lt; 0.001). The average urine output in the M group (707 mL) was higher than it was in the HTS group (596 mL) (P &lt; 0.001). There were no significant differences in fluid input, ICU stays, and hospital days between the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that HTS provided better brain relaxation than did mannitol during elective supratentorial brain tumor surgery, whereas it did not affect ICU stays or hospital days.",M1
20185195,"Serum <e>sodium</e>, renal function, and survival of patients with end-stage liver disease.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Serum creatinine, a component of the model for end-stage liver disease (MELD), is an important prognostic indicator in patients with end-stage liver disease (ESLD). In addition, serum sodium has recently been recognized as an important predictor of mortality in patients with ESLD. We investigate the role of serum creatinine and sodium, and glomerular filtration rate (GFR) as determinants of survival in patients with ESLD. METHODS: A prospective database was utilized to identify all adults listed for primary liver transplantation (LTx) at the Mayo Clinic, Rochester, between 1990 and 1999. GFR was measured by iothalamate clearance. RESULTS: Among 837 patients listed for LTx, 660 had complete data including measured GFR. There was a significant association between GFR and survival after adjustment for MELD, with a linear rise in the risk of death as GFR decreased between 60 and 20ml/min/1.73m(2). Multivariable models showed that GFR is superior to creatinine in predicting mortality - a model consisting of total bilirubin (hazard ratio (HR)=2.17, p&lt;0.01), INR (HR=3.26, p&lt;0.01) and GFR (HR=0.42, p&lt;0.01) was superior to MELD (chi-square 65.6 vs. 59.4, c-statistic 0.792 vs. 0.780). Serum sodium did not contribute to survival prediction when accurately measured GFR data were available. CONCLUSIONS: Serum concentrations of creatinine and sodium in patients with end-stage liver disease reflect a reduction in renal function, the underlying event that decreases survival.",M1

The parameters were analyzed using semi-automated clinical chemistry analyzer Microlab 300, microprocessor-controlled analyzer EasyLite and spectrophotometer Genesys 10. Cells were cultured with lead acetate trihydrate [Pb(CH(3)COO)(2).3H(2)O] as follows: group Max (5 mg Pb(CH(3)COO)(2).3H(2)O/10 mL), group A (2.5 mg/10 mL), group B (0.83 mg/10 mL), group C (0.625 mg/10 mL), group D (0.455 mg/10 mL) and the control group without lead exposure for 18 hrs. The highest TAS was estimated in the control group without lead treatment in comparison with other groups (MAX, A, B, C, D). Statistical analyses showed significantly lower value (P &lt; 0.05) in group B. The activity of SOD was the lowest in the control group in comparison to those exposed to in vitro lead culture. A significant decrease (P &lt; 0.05) of calcium content in group MAX in comparison with control group was determined. Release of phosphorus by ovarian granulosa cells was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05; 0.01; 0.001) in all the treated groups in comparison with control group. Lead was found to stimulate the release of magnesium and potassium by granulosa cells, but the increase remained statistically insignificant. The highest concentration of glucose was noted in control group, but the differences were not significant either. No significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) were detected in concentration of other studied parameters among observed groups, too.",M1
20176039,"Diphenidol inhibited <e>sodium</e> currents and produced spinal anesthesia.The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of diphenidol on blocking Na(+) currents and spinal anesthesia. We used the patch-clamp method to examine if diphenidol blocked Na(+) currents. Lidocaine, a common used local anesthesia, was used as control. We also evaluated the potencies and durations of diphenidol and lidocaine on spinal blockades of motor function, proprioception, and nociception in rats. Lidocaine exhibited a concentration- and state-dependent effect on tonic blockade of voltage-gated Na(+) currents in mouse neuroblastoma N2A cells (IC(50) of 8.1 and 138.9 microM at holding potentials of -70 and -100 mV, respectively). Diphenidol was more potent (IC(50) of 0.77 and 62.6 microM at holding potentials of -70 and -100 mV, respectively). However, unlike lidocaine, block of Na(+) currents by diphenidol lacked use-dependence. We also found that diphenidol acted like lidocaine and produced dose-related spinal blockades of motor function, proprioception and nociception. Although diphenidol had similar potencies of spinal anesthesia compared with lidocaine it produced a much longer duration of spinal blockades than lidocaine. Our results demonstrated that intrathecal diphenidol produced a long duration and similar potency on spinal anesthesia compared with lidocaine in rats. The anesthetic effect of diphenidol could be in part due to its blockade of Na(+) currents.",M1

METHODS: Human Na(V)1.5 channels were expressed in Xenopus oocytes and studied using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. I(Na) and action potentials in rabbit ventricular myocytes were studied using the whole-cell recording. RESULTS: MFA and lidocaine inhibited human Na(V)1.5 channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes in a positive rate-dependent and concentration-dependent manner, with IC(50) values of 72.61 micromol/L and 145.62 micromol/L, respectively. Both of them markedly shifted the steady-state activation curve of I(Na) toward more positive potentials, shifted the steady-state inactivation curve of I(Na) toward more negative potentials and postponed the recovery of the I(Na) inactivation state. In rabbit ventricular myocytes, MFA inhibited I(Na) with a shift in the steady-state inactivation curve toward more negative potentials, thereby postponing the recovery of the I(Na) inactivation state. This shift was in a positive rate-dependent manner. Under current-clamp mode, MAF significantly decreased action potential amplitude (APA) and maximal depolarization velocity (V(max)) and shortened action potential duration (APD), but did not alter the resting membrane potential (RMP). The demonstrated that the kinetics of sodium channel blockage by MFA resemble those of class I antiarrhythmic agents such as lidocaine. CONCLUSION: MFA protects the heart against arrhythmias by its blocking effect on sodium channels.",M1
20172348,"Comparison of dissolution properties of 2 enteric-coated formulations containing mycophenolate <e>sodium</e>: Myfortic vs Femulan.Enteric-coated tablets containing mycophenolate sodium have been developed to reduce gastric toxicity. The objective of this study was to compare 2 enteric-coated formulations containing 360 mg of mycophenolate sodium: the innovator product, Myfortic, and an agent that recently became available in Mexico, Femulan. For both formulations, mycophenolate sodium content was within the 90% to 110% range of the label claimed dose, and no impurities were present as determined at high-performance liquid chromatography. Mycophenolate sodium release was assayed by applying the US Pharmacopeia apparatus 2 dissolution test at 2 different pH values (1.2 and 6.8) to mimic conditions in the stomach and the small intestine, respectively. At pH 1.2, mycophenolate sodium release was less than 2%, with respect to the label claimed dose, for both formulations. At pH 6.8, mean (range) mycophenolate sodium release with Myfortic was 104.9% (104.0%-105.6%), and with femulan was 62.3% (51.3%-67.7%); the difference between formulations achieved statistical significance (P = .04). Moreover, intratablet variability with the generic formulation was unacceptable. Variation between the highest and lowest drug release was 32.0% for Femulan, and 1.02% for Myfortic. Thus, it is likely that Femulan results in insufficient and irreproducible absorption of mycophenolate sodium in the small intestine, leading to inadequate immunosuppressive efficacy. It is concluded that Femulan and myfortic are not equivalent formulations. Furthermore, Femulan is not a suitable formulation for clinical use in organ transplantation because it does not meet pharmaceutical quality standards.",M1
20164365,"<e>Sodium</e>-dependent phosphate uptake in the jejunum is post-transcriptionally regulated in pigs fed a low-phosphorus diet and is independent of dietary calcium concentration.In rodents, severe dietary P restriction increases active phosphate absorption by the intestine. However, it remains unknown if moderate dietary P restriction has a similar effect. Weanling pigs (n = 32; body weight 7.4 +/- 0.55 kg) were used in a 2 x 2 factorial design and fed dietary available P (aP) concentrations of 0.23 or 0.40% and Ca concentrations of 0.58 or 1.00% for 14 d. Diets were formulated on an aP basis instead of a total P basis, because pigs are unable to absorb phytate-P present in corn and soybean meal. Jejunal segments were mounted in modified Ussing chambers for determination of Na(+)-dependent nutrient transport. Intestinal mucosal scrapings were taken for RNA isolation and brush border membrane (BBM) vesicle isolation. Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake and gene expression of Na-phosphate cotransporter IIb (NaPi-IIb), SGLT-1 (sodium/glucose cotransporter-1), and calbindin D(9k) and protein expression of NaPi-IIb were evaluated. Na(+)-dependent phosphate transport increased (P &lt; 0.05) 46% as dietary aP concentration was decreased. However, increased Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake was not accompanied by increased NaPi-IIb mRNA expression. Expression of NaPi-IIb protein in the BBM increased (P &lt; 0.01) 84% in pigs fed low-P diets compared with pigs fed adequate-P diets. No dietary Ca effects or aP x Ca interactions were detected for Na-dependent P uptake, mRNA or protein expression of NaPi-IIb, or mRNA expression of calbindin D(9k). These data suggest that restricting dietary aP concentration by only 43% stimulates Na(+)-dependent phosphate uptake and expression of the NaPi-IIb protein in the BBM of the small intestine and through a post-transcriptional mechanism.",M1
20149721,"A spectroscopic and computational study of Al(III) complexes in <e>sodium</e> cryolite melts: ionic composition in a wide range of cryolite ratios.The structure of sodium cryolite melts was studied using Raman spectroscopy and quantum chemical calculations performed at the density functional theory level. The existence of bridged forms in the melts was argued first from the analysis of experimental Raman spectra. In the quantum chemical modelling emphasis was put on the construction of potential energy surfaces describing the formation/dissociation of certain complex species. Effects of the ionic environment were found to play a crucial role in the energetics of model processes. The structure of the simplest possible polymeric forms involving two Al centres linked through F atoms ( dimers ) was thoroughly investigated. The calculated equilibrium constants and model Raman spectra yield additional evidence in favour of the dimers. This agrees with a self-consistent analysis of a series of Raman spectra for a wide range of the melt composition.",M1

OBJECTIVE: To determine the existence of a linear correlation between intervertebral disc [Na] measured from sodium MRI and [PG] measurement from DMMB assay. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Previous studies have shown the possibility of quantifying Na in vivo using sodium MRI, however, none has shown a direct linear correlation between Na measured from sodium MRI and in the invertebral discs. METHODS: Three-dimensional sodium MRI images of bovine discs were acquired and converted into [Na] maps. Samples were systematically removed from the discs for DMMB assay. The removal locations were photographically recorded and applied to the [Na] maps to extract the [Na] measurements for comparison. In vivo sodium MRI scans were also carried out on a pair of symptomatic and asymptomatic subjects. RESULTS: The linear regression fit of [Na] versus [PG] data yielded a significant linear correlation coefficient of 0.71. The in vivo sodium MRI image of the symptomatic subject showed significant [Na] decrease when compared to that of the asymptomatic subject. CONCLUSION: Specificity of sodium MRI for PG in the intervertebral discs makes it a promising diagnostic tool for the earlier phase of disc degeneration.",M1

We now show the prognostic effect of serum sodium in patients with metastatic RCC (mRCC). METHODS: Cohort A comprised 120 consecutive patients with mRCC receiving subcutaneous, low-dose interleukin-2 and interferon-alpha. Hyponatremia was assessed in univariate and multivariate analyses. An independent cohort of another 120 patients with mRCC was used for validation (cohort B). RESULTS: In cohort A, estimated 5-year survival was 15% and median survival was 15.1 months. Serum sodium ranged between 126 and 144 mM. Twenty-four patients (20%) had serum sodium levels below normal range (&lt;136 mM). In multivariate analysis, significant independent risk factors for short survival were low serum sodium (P=0.014), high neutrophils (P=0.018), lactate dehydrogenase &gt;1.5 upper normal level (P=0.002), and number of metastatic sites (+3) (P=0.003). In cohort B, serum sodium ranged between 128 and 146 mM. Seventeen patients (14%) had sodium levels below normal range. In multivariate analysis, serum sodium was validated as an independent prognostic factor (P=0.001). A significant association between lack of response and hyponatremia was observed in both cohorts (P=0.003 and P=0.02, respectively). CONCLUSION: Low serum sodium is a new, validated, independent prognostic, and predictive factor in patients with mRCC.",M1

These results suggest that the use of S. lycocarpum flour can be an effective support in diabetes mellitus treatment.",M1
20145518,"Improved intestinal preservation using an intraluminal macromolecular solution: evidence from a rat model.BACKGROUND: Intestinal preservation injury consists of progressive submucosal edema, with fluid originating both from the lumen and the interstitium. Although vascular flushing aims to control electrolyte shifts in the tissue, the lumen is not addressed, and luminal water and electrolytes enter the tissue during ischemia. Because macromolecular solutions may retain water and electrolytes intraluminally, we investigated whether these solutions administered intraluminally may alleviate preservation injury. METHODS: Sprague-Dawley rat intestines were perfused with University of Wisconsin solution. After excision of the intestines, we intraluminally introduced solutions containing polyethylene glycol 3350 with high (125 mEq) or low (65 mEq) <e>sodium</e> before cold preservation. Controls underwent only vascular flush. After 8, 14, or 20 hr of cold storage, the intestines were analyzed for extent of tissue injury, water retention, brush-border maltase, and tight junction proteins zonula occludens-1 and claudin-3. RESULTS: Intraluminal composition changed over time, indicating sodium absorption and potassium secretion. After 8 and 14 hr of cold storage, intestines from the low-sodium group had the best morphology and least edema, followed by the controls. Maltase activity slightly decreased in all groups over time and was not affected by the intraluminal polyethylene glycol solutions. Various degrees of delocalization and degradation of zonula occludens-1 and claudin-3 were recorded within the tight junctions, with the most significant effects in intestines from the high-sodium group. CONCLUSIONS: Intraluminal macromolecular solutions may modulate the preservation injury in University of Wisconsin- perfused intestines. Low-sodium solutions administered immediately before preservation may improve preservation injury, but high-sodium solutions may be detrimental.",M1
20142578,"Impact of hospital-associated hyponatremia on selected outcomes.BACKGROUND: Hyponatremia is the most common electrolyte disorder encountered in hospitalized patients. METHODS: We evaluated whether hospital-associated hyponatremia has an independent effect on all-cause mortality, hospital length of stay (LOS), and patient disposition. This cohort study included all adult hospitalizations at an academic medical center occurring between 2000-2007 for which an admission serum <e>sodium</e> concentration ([Na(+)]) was available (N = 53 236). We examined community-acquired hyponatremia (admission serum [Na(+)], &lt;138 mEq/L [to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 1.0]), hospital-aggravated hyponatremia (community-acquired hyponatremia complicated by worsening in serum [Na(+)]), and hospital-acquired hyponatremia (nadir serum [Na(+)], &lt;138 mEq/L with a normal admission serum [Na(+)]). The independent associations of these hyponatremic presentations with in-hospital mortality, LOS, and patient disposition were evaluated using generalized estimating equations adjusted for age, sex, race, admission service, and Deyo-Charlson Comorbidity Index score. RESULTS: Community-acquired hyponatremia occurred in 37.9% of hospitalizations and was associated with adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 1.36-1.69) for in-hospital mortality and 1.12 (95% CI, 1.08-1.17) for discharge to a short- or long-term care facility and a 14% (95% CI, 11%-16%) adjusted increase in LOS. Hospital-acquired hyponatremia developed in 38.2% of hospitalizations longer than 1 day in which initial serum [Na(+)] was 138 to 142 mEq/L. Hospital-acquired hyponatremia was associated with adjusted ORs of 1.66 (95% CI, 1.39-1.98) for in-hospital mortality and 1.64 (95% CI, 1.55-1.74) for discharge to a facility and a 64% (95% CI, 60%-68%) adjusted increase in LOS. The strength of these associations tended to increase with hyponatremia severity. CONCLUSIONS: Hospital-associated hyponatremia is a common occurrence. All forms of hyponatremia are independently associated with in-hospital mortality and heightened resource consumption.",M1
20138121,"Na(x)-deficient mice show normal vasopressin response to dehydration.In dehydrated animals, the antidiuretic hormone vasopressin (VP) is released from the nerve terminals of magnocellular neurons of the supraoptic nucleus (SON) and paraventricular nucleus (PVN) into the systemic circulation at the posterior pituitary. Increases in <e>sodium</e> (Na+)-level and osmolality in body fluids upon dehydration are reportedly sensed by a Na+-sensor and/or an osmosensor, respectively. However, it is still unknown whether both are involved in the regulation of production and/or release of VP. Na(x) is the cerebral Na+-level sensor and Na(x)-knockout mice do not stop ingesting salt even when dehydrated. Here we examined VP production/release in Na(x)-knockout mice, and found that they are normal in the VP response to dehydration or intraperitoneal-administration with hypertonic saline. In situ hybridization using an intron-specific probe showed that VP gene expression in the SON did not differ from wild-type mice when dehydrated. Also, there was no significant difference in the activity of subfornical organ neurons projecting to the SON between the two genotypes when stimulated by water deprivation. Furthermore, Na(x)-knockout mice showed a normal response in urine excretion to dehydration. All these results indicate that the information of Na+-level increase detected by Na(x) does not contribute to the control of VP production/release.",M1
20150700,"Effects of ion exchange resins in different mobile ion forms on semi-aerobic landfill leachate treatment.Landfill leachate is one of the major contamination sources. In this study, the ability of synthetic ion exchange resins which carry different mobile ion for removing color, chemical oxygen demand (COD), and ammonia nitrogen (NH(3)-N) from stabilized leachate was investigated. The synthetic resin INDION 225 Na as a cationic exchanger and INDION FFIP MB as an anionic exchanger were used in this study. INDION 225 Na was used in hydrogen form (H(+)) and in <e>sodium</e> form (Na(+)), while INDION FFIP MB resin was used in hydroxide form (OH(-)) and in calcium form (Cl(-)) form. The results indicated better removal of color, COD and NH(3)-N by using INDION 225 Na in H(+) as compared with Na(+) form, while no performance differences were observed by using INDION FFIP MB in OH(-) or Cl(-) form. Applying cationic resin followed by anionic resin achieved 97, 88 and 94, percent removal of color, COD and NH(3)-N. The residual amounts were 160 Pt-Co, 290 mg/L and 110 mg/L of color, COD and NH(3)-N respectively.",M1
20138071,"Conspecific presence affects the physiology and behaviour of developing trout.Interactions between conspecifics during embryonic development have the potential to influence phenotypic traits of individuals, with social interaction being particularly important for the realisation of normal behaviours. Here, the effect of increasing numbers of conspecifics (from isolation to groups of 20, 50, 100 and 200) on the physiology and behaviour of developing trout was investigated with the hypothesis that a) conspecific presence would alter physiological processes and b) that development in the absence of conspecifics would affect subsequent behavioural performance. During development, mass, oxygen consumption, <e>sodium</e> uptake and ammonia excretion rates were measured at a variety of time points from fertilisation to after hatching. After first feeding, behaviour of individuals raised in social isolation was compared to behaviour of juvenile fish raised in social groups. Embryos and larvae raised in social isolation had lower oxygen consumption rates, lower sodium uptake rates and higher ammonia excretion rates compared to those raised in groups. Social isolation delayed the response of a juvenile fish to its own mirror image but did not affect the probability of it winning a paired encounter with an individual raised in a social environment. In conclusion, the presence of conspecifics alters physiological processes during trout embryo and larval development and subsequent social behaviours of juveniles.",M1
20136958,"Major adverse events, pretransplant assessment and outcome prediction.Liver cirrhosis and portal hypertension pose enormous loss of lives and resources throughout the world, especially in endemic areas of chronic viral hepatitis. Although the pathophysiology of cirrhosis is not completely understood, the accumulating evidence has paved the way for better control of the complications, including gastroesophageal variceal bleeding, hepatic encephalopathy, ascites, hepatorenal syndrome, hepatopulmonary syndrome and portopulmonary hypertension. Modern pharmacological and interventional therapies have been designed to treat these complications. However, liver transplantation (LT) is the only definite treatment for patients with preterminal end-stage liver disease. To pursue successful LT, the meticulous evaluation of potential recipients and donors is pivotal, especially for living donor transplantation. The critical shortage of cadaveric donor livers is another concern. In many Asian countries, cultural and religious concerns further limit the number of the donors, which lags far behind that of the recipients. The model for end-stage liver disease (MELD) scoring system has recently become the prevailing criterion for organ allocation. Initial results showed clear benefits of moving from the Child-Turcotte-Pugh-based system toward the MELD-based organ allocation system. In addition to the MELD, serum <e>sodium</e> is another important prognostic predictor in patients with advanced cirrhosis. The incorporation of serum sodium into the MELD could enhance the performance of the MELD and could become an indispensable strategy in refining the priority for LT. However, the feasibility of the MELD in combination with sodium in predicting the outcome for patients on transplant waiting list awaits actual outcome data before this becomes standard practice in the Asia-Pacific region.",M1
20133698,"Arabidopsis V-ATPase activity at the tonoplast is required for efficient nutrient storage but not for <e>sodium</e> accumulation.The productivity of higher plants as a major source of food and energy is linked to their ability to buffer changes in the concentrations of essential and toxic ions. Transport across the tonoplast is energized by two proton pumps, the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase (V-ATPase) and the vacuolar H(+)-pyrophosphatase (V-PPase); however, their functional relation and relative contributions to ion storage and detoxification are unclear. We have identified an Arabidopsis mutant in which energization of vacuolar transport solely relies on the activity of the V-PPase. The vha-a2 vha-a3 double mutant, which lacks the two tonoplast-localized isoforms of the membrane-integral V-ATPase subunit VHA-a, is viable but shows day-length-dependent growth retardation. Nitrate content is reduced whereas nitrate assimilation is increased in the vha-a2 vha-a3 mutant, indicating that vacuolar nitrate storage represents a major growth-limiting factor. Zinc is an essential micronutrient that is toxic at excess concentrations and is detoxified via a vacuolar Zn(2+)/H(+)-antiport system. Accordingly, the double mutant shows reduced zinc tolerance. In the same way the vacuolar Na(+)/H(+)-antiport system is assumed to be an important component of the system that removes sodium from the cytosol. Unexpectedly, salt tolerance and accumulation are not affected in the vha-a2 vha-a3 double mutant. In contrast, reduction of V-ATPase activity in the trans-Golgi network/early endosome (TGN/EE) leads to increased salt sensitivity. Taken together, our results show that during gametophyte and embryo development V-PPase activity at the tonoplast is sufficient whereas tonoplast V-ATPase activity is limiting for nutrient storage but not for sodium tolerance during vegetative and reproductive growth.",M1
20106993,"Mechanisms of proximal tubule <e>sodium</e> transport regulation that link extracellular fluid volume and blood pressure.One-hundred years ago, Starling articulated the interdependence of renal control of circulating blood volume and effective cardiac performance. During the past 25 years, the molecular mechanisms responsible for the interdependence of blood pressure (BP), extracellular fluid volume (ECFV), the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), and sympathetic nervous system (SNS) have begun to be revealed. These variables all converge on regulation of renal proximal tubule (PT) sodium transport. The PT reabsorbs two-thirds of the filtered Na(+) and volume at baseline. This fraction is decreased when BP or perfusion pressure is increased, during a high-salt diet (elevated ECFV), and during inhibition of the production of ANG II; conversely, this fraction is increased by ANG II, SNS activation, and a low-salt diet. These variables all regulate the distribution of the Na(+)/H(+) exchanger isoform 3 (NHE3) and the Na(+)-phosphate cotransporter (NaPi2), along the apical microvilli of the PT. Natriuretic stimuli provoke the dynamic redistribution of these transporters along with associated regulators, molecular motors, and cytoskeleton-associated proteins to the base of the microvilli. The lipid raft-associated NHE3 remains at the base, and the nonraft-associated NaPi2 is endocytosed, culminating in decreased Na(+) transport and increased PT flow rate. Antinatriuretic stimuli return the same transporters and regulators to the body of the microvilli associated with an increase in transport activity and decrease in PT flow rate. In summary, ECFV and BP homeostasis are, at least in part, maintained by continuous and acute redistribution of transporter complexes up and down the PT microvilli, which affect regulation of PT sodium reabsorption in response to fluctuations in ECFV, BP, SNS, and RAS.",M1
20129533,"Myocardial sympathetic innervation and long-term left ventricular mechanical unloading.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to analyze the effects of left ventricular assist devices (LVADs) on myocardial sympathetic innervation of the failing heart. BACKGROUND: Ventricular unloading by LVADs seems to cause reverse remodeling of the failing heart, but little is known about the sympathetic nerve activity during long-term mechanical unloading. METHODS: We studied the effects of LVADs on myocardial sympathetic innervation, by iodine 123-meta-iodobenzylguanidine (123I-mIBG) scintigraphy performed before and 3 months after LVAD implantation in 12 end-stage heart failure patients. We calculated the: 1) heart-to-mediastinum (H/M) uptake ratio on early and delayed images, indicating myocardial accumulation of 123I-mIBG; and 2) rate of 123I-mIBG washout after initial accumulation. Similar 123I-mIBG imaging and functional and hemodynamic measurements were made 3 months apart in 6 other heart failure patients not treated with an LVAD. RESULTS: After 3 months of LVAD support, the mean left ventricular ejection fraction had increased from 19+/-6% to 29 +/- 9% (p=0.006), peak oxygen consumption increased from 9+/-4 ml/kg/min to 13+/-3 ml/kg/min (p=0.058), serum <e>sodium</e> increased from 135+/-4 mEq/l to 140+/-2 mEq/l (p=0.014), whereas the left ventricular end-diastolic diameter decreased from 72+/-7 mm to 56+/-3 mm (p=0.002), pulmonary capillary wedge pressure decreased from 30+/-6 mm Hg to 5+/-3 mm Hg (p=0.012), serum creatinine decreased from 1.5+/-0.6 mg/dl to 1.0+/-0.4 mg/dl (p=0.011), and B-type natriuretic peptide decreased from 2,279+/-1,900 pg/ml to 102+/-5 pg/ml (p=0.003). After 3 months of LVAD, the H/M ratio increased on delayed images from 1.25+/-0.18 to 1.43+/-0.13 (p=0.01) and on early images from 1.35+/-0.19 to 1.44+/-0.11 (p=0.028), and the washout rate decreased from 51.0+/-23.2% to 30.6+/-8.7%, (p=0.015). There was a significant correlation between the late H/M mIBG ratio and B-type natriuretic peptide (R=0.77, p=0.01) and systolic pulmonary pressure (R=0.7, p=0.05). No significant scintigraphic, functional or hemodynamic change was observed between the 2 evaluations in the 6 patients not treated with an LVAD. CONCLUSIONS: Ventricular unloading caused clinical, functional, and hemodynamic improvements accompanied by improvements in sympathetic innervation in the failing heart.",M1
20122133,"42K analysis of <e>sodium</e>-induced potassium efflux in barley: mechanism and relevance to salt tolerance.*Stimulation of potassium (K(+)) efflux by sodium (Na(+)) has been the subject of much recent attention, and its mechanism has been attributed to the activities of specific classes of ion channels. *The short-lived radiotracer (42)K(+) was used to test this attribution, via unidirectional K(+)-flux analysis at the root plasma membrane of intact barley (Hordeum vulgare), in response to NaCl, KCl, NH(4)Cl and mannitol, and to channel inhibitors. *Unidirectional K(+) efflux was strongly stimulated by NaCl, and K(+) influx strongly suppressed. Both effects were ameliorated by elevated calcium (Ca(2+)). As well, K(+) efflux was strongly stimulated by KCl, NH(4)Cl and mannitol , and NaCl also stimulated (13)NH(4)(+) efflux. The Na(+)-stimulated K(+) efflux was insensitive to cesium (Cs(+)) and pH 4.2, weakly sensitive to the K(+)-channel blocker tetraethylammonium (TEA(+)) and quinine, and moderately sensitive to zinc (Zn(2+)) and lanthanum (La(3+)). *We conclude that the stimulated efflux is: specific neither to Na(+) as effector nor K(+) as target; composed of fluxes from both cytosol and vacuole; mediated neither by outwardly-rectifying K(+) channels nor nonselective cation channels; attributable, alternatively, to membrane disintegration brought about by ionic and osmotic components; of limited long-term significance, unlike the suppression of K(+) influx by Na(+), which is a greater threat to K(+) homeostasis under salt stress.",M1

Plasma sodium and potassium levels of the control rats fluctuated between 153.14 +/- 2.88 - 157.23 +/- 2.16 meq l(-1) and 5.04 +/- 0.32 - 5.63 +/- 0.41 meq l(-1), respectively. Plasma sodium level of the treated rats registered a progressive decline (p&lt;0.01) at 24 hr with the minimum value (126.53 +/- 2.68 meq l(-1)) on day 30 whereas plasma potassium level registered a progressive increase during entire period of the treatment with peak (8.78 +/- 0.23 meq l(-1)) on day 30. Though sublethal herion administration for 30 days elcited cytoplasmic vacuolation in all the three zones of adrenal cortex, much of cytological alterations were observed in zona glomerulosa and zona fasciculata cells. In zona glomerulosa cells, degenerative changes in the organelles were more pronounced as evident by the loss of typical cristae in the mitochondria and hormone granules were rarely seen in these cells. Though rough endoplasmic reticula were scanty, many lipid granules encountered in zona glomerulosa cells of the treated rats.",M1
20138075,"Post-ingestive signals and satiation of water and <e>sodium</e> intake of male rats.This study investigated the role of post-ingestive signals in the satiation of thirst or salt appetite. Post-ingestive signals, defined as those arising from the passage of fluid into the duodenum and proximal jejunum, were manipulated by implanting rats with gastric fistulas. After recovery, rats were water deprived and the following day gastric fistulas were opened (sham-drinking) or closed (control). Deprivation-induced thirst significantly increased water intake with sham-drinking rats consuming four-fold more than controls after 120 min access. Subsequently, rats were given sodium deficient chow for 48 h and the next day were administered furosemide and urine was collected. Twenty-four hours later, gastric fistulas were manipulated and rats were given water and 0.5M NaCl and intakes were measured. After 120 min of access, rats were sacrificed and plasma sodium (pNa) and plasma-renin-activity (PRA) were measured. Furosemide resulted in a loss of 2.2 mEq of sodium in urine and sham-drinking rats consumed significantly more water and 0.5M NaCl when compared to controls. At 120 min sham-drinking rats consumed 7.5 mEq of sodium nearly twice that of controls but had significantly lower pNa and significantly increased PRA. Interestingly, the ratio of water to 0.5M NaCl intake was similar in both groups, with each making a mixture of approximately 0.25 M NaCl. The results suggest that post-ingestive signals are necessary for the satiation of thirst and salt appetite.",M1
20108922,"Factors governing the Na(+) vs K(+) selectivity in <e>sodium</e> ion channels.Monovalent Na(+) and K(+) ion channels, specialized pore-forming proteins that play crucial biological roles such as controlling cardiac, skeletal, and smooth muscle contraction, are characterized by a remarkable metal selectivity, conducting the native cation while rejecting its monovalent contender and other ions present in the cellular/extracellular milieu. Compared to K(+) channels, the principles governing Na(+) vs K(+) selectivity in both epithelial and voltage-gated Na(+) channels are much less well understood due mainly to the lack of high-resolution 3D structures. Thus, many questions remain. It is not clear if the serines lining the pore of epithelial Na(+) channel bind to the metal cation via their backbone or side chain O atoms and why substituting the Lys lining the pore of voltage-gated Na(+) channels to another residue such as Arg drastically reduces or even reverses the Na(+)/K(+) selectivity. This work systematically evaluates the effects of various factors such as (i) the number, chemical type, and charge of the pore's coordinating groups, (ii) the hydration number and coordination number of the metal cation, and (iii) the solvent exposure and the size/rigidity of the pore on the Na(+) vs K(+) selectivity in model Na(+) channel selectivity filters (the narrowest part of the pore) using a combined density functional theory/continuum dielectric approach. The results reveal that the Na(+) channel's selectivity for Na(+) over K(+) increases if (1) the pore provides three rather than four protein ligands to coordinate to the metal ion, (2) the protein ligands have strong charge-donating ability such as Asp/Glu carboxylate or backbone carbonyl groups, (3) the passing Na(+) is bare or less well hydrated inside the filter than the competing K(+), and (4) the pore is relatively rigid, constricted, and solvent exposed. They also reveal that factors favoring Na(+)/K(+) selectivity in Na(+) channels generally disfavor K(+)/Na(+) selectivity in K(+) channels and vice versa. The different selectivity principles for the K(+) and Na(+) channels are consistent with the different architecture, composition, and properties of their selectivity filters. They provide clues to the metal-binding site structure in the selectivity filters of epithelial and voltage-gated Na(+) channels.",M1
20118617,"<e>Sodium</e>-calcium exchangers in rat ameloblasts.Although the central role of ameloblasts in synthesis and resorption of enamel matrix proteins during amelogenesis is well documented, the Ca(2+)-transport/extrusion mechanism remains to be fully elucidated. To clarify Ca(2+)-transport in rat ameloblasts, we investigated expression and localization of Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchanger (NCX) isoforms and the functional characteristics of their ion transporting/pharmacological properties. RT-PCR and immunohistochemical analyses revealed expression of NCX1 and NCX3 in ameloblasts, localized in the apical membrane. In patch-clamp recordings, Ca(2+) efflux by Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange showed dependence on external Na(+). Ca(2+) influx by Na(+)-Ca(2+) exchange, measured by fura-2 fluorescence, showed dependence on extracellular Ca(2+) concentration, and it was blocked by NCX inhibitors KB-R7943, SEA0400, and SN-6. These results showed significant expression of NCX1 and NCX3 in ameloblasts, indicating their involvement in the directional Ca(2+) extrusion pathway from cells to the enamel mineralizing front.",M1
20074896,"[Assessment of efficacy of hypertonic saline - hydroxyethylstarch in haemorrhagic shock]OBJECTIVE: Assessment of haemodynamic, respiratory and renal effects of hypertonic saline-hydroxyethyl starch (HyperHES) in critically ill-patients with hemorrhagic shock. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Seventeen mechanically ventilated patients with hemorragic shock benefiting from a cardiovascular monitoring by PiCCO device and requiring rapid volume loading. Two hundred and fifty milliliters of HyperHES were given over 5 minutes. The efficacy of volume loading was assessed by the measure of the systolic arterial pressure (SAP), cardiac index (CI), stroke volume variation (SVV) and the indexed systemic vascular resistance (iSVR). Studied parameters were assessed at baseline, 5, 30, 60 and 180 minutes after the end of HyperHES infusion. RESULTS: SAP (105 + or - 23 vs 77 + or - 10; p&lt;0.001) and CI (4.8 + or - 1.1 vs 3.5 + or - 0.9; p&lt;0.001) were significantly increased whereas iSVR (1175 + or - 310 vs 1501 + or - 337; p&lt;0.01) and SVV (13 + or - 7 vs 20 + or - 5; p&lt;0.01) were significantly decreased 5 minutes after the HyperHES infusion. <e>Sodium</e> (145 + or - 6 vs 136 + or - 5; p&lt;0.001) and chloride (118 + or - 7 vs 107 + or - 6; p&lt;0.001) were increased 5 minutes after the infusion. The PaO(2)/FiO(2) ratio as the extravascular lung water was not influenced by the infusion. The follow-up of renal parameters during the three first days (creatinemia, uremia and diuresis) did not revelead significant variations. CONCLUSION: In patients with hemorrhagic shock, the infusion of hypertonic saline (7.5%) hydroxyethyl starch association was followed by an increase in SAP, CI serum sodium and chloride concentrations.

20110245,"Brain tissue <e>sodium</e> concentration in multiple sclerosis: a sodium imaging study at 3 tesla.Neuro-axonal degeneration occurs progressively from the onset of multiple sclerosis and is thought to be a significant cause of increasing clinical disability. Several histopathological studies of multiple sclerosis and experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis have shown that the accumulation of sodium in axons can promote reverse action of the sodium/calcium exchanger that, in turn, leads to a lethal overload in intra-axonal calcium. We hypothesized that sodium magnetic resonance imaging would provide an indicator of cellular and metabolic integrity and ion homeostasis in patients with multiple sclerosis. Using a three-dimensional radial gradient-echo sequence with short echo time, we performed sodium magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T in 17 patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis and in 13 normal subjects. The absolute total tissue sodium concentration was measured in lesions and in several areas of normal-appearing white and grey matter in patients, and corresponding areas of white and grey matter in controls. A mixed model analysis of covariance was performed to compare regional tissue sodium concentration levels in patients and controls. Spearman correlations were used to determine the association of regional tissue sodium concentration levels in T(2)- and T(1)-weighted lesions with measures of normalized whole brain and grey and white matter volumes, and with expanded disability status scale scores. In patients, tissue sodium concentration levels were found to be elevated in acute and chronic lesions compared to areas of normal-appearing white matter (P &lt; 0.0001). The tissue sodium concentration levels in areas of normal-appearing white matter were significantly higher than those in corresponding white matter regions in healthy controls (P &lt; 0.0001). The tissue sodium concentration value averaged over lesions and over regions of normal-appearing white and grey matter was positively associated with T(2)-weighted (P &lt; or = 0.001 for all) and T(1)-weighted (P &lt; or = 0.006 for all) lesion volumes. In patients, only the tissue sodium concentration value averaged over regions of normal-appearing grey matter was negatively associated with the normalized grey matter volume (P = 0.0009). Finally, the expanded disability status scale score showed a mild, positive association with the mean tissue sodium concentration value in chronic lesions (P = 0.002), in regions of normal-appearing white matter (P = 0.004) and normal-appearing grey matter (P = 0.002). This study shows the feasibility of using in vivo sodium magnetic resonance imaging at 3 T in patients with multiple sclerosis. Our findings suggest that the abnormal values of the tissue sodium concentration in patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis might reflect changes in cellular composition of the lesions and/or changes in cellular and metabolic integrity. Sodium magnetic resonance imaging has the potential to provide insight into the pathophysiological mechanisms of tissue injury when correlation with histopathology becomes available.",M1
20094673,"Probing the calcium and <e>sodium</e> local environment in bones and teeth using multinuclear solid state NMR and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.Despite the numerous studies of bone mineral, there are still many questions regarding the exact structure and composition of the mineral phase, and how the mineral crystals become organised with respect to each other and the collagen matrix. Bone mineral is commonly formulated as hydroxyapatite, albeit with numerous substitutions, and has previously been studied by (31)P and (1)H NMR, which has given considerable insight into the complexity of the mineral structure. However, to date, there has been no report of an NMR investigation of the other major component of bone mineral, calcium, nor of common minority cations like sodium. Here, direct analysis of the local environment of calcium in two biological apatites, equine bone (HB) and bovine tooth (CT), was carried out using both (43)Ca solid state NMR and Ca K-edge X-ray absorption spectroscopy, revealing important structural information about the calcium coordination shell. The (43)Ca delta(iso) in HB and CT is found to correlate with the average Ca-O bond distance measured by Ca K-edge EXAFS, and the (43)Ca NMR linewidths show that there is a greater distribution in chemical bonding around calcium in HB and CT, compared to synthetic apatites. In the case of sodium, (23)Na MAS NMR, high resolution 3Q-MAS NMR, as well as (23)Na{(31)P} REDOR and (1)H{(23)Na} R(3)-HMQC correlation experiments give the first direct evidence that some sodium is located inside the apatite phase in HB and CT, but with a greater distribution of environments compared to a synthetic sodium substituted apatite (Na-HA).",M1
20107438,"The cells and peripheral representation of <e>sodium</e> taste in mice.Salt taste in mammals can trigger two divergent behavioural responses. In general, concentrated saline solutions elicit robust behavioural aversion, whereas low concentrations of NaCl are typically attractive, particularly after sodium depletion. Notably, the attractive salt pathway is selectively responsive to sodium and inhibited by amiloride, whereas the aversive one functions as a non-selective detector for a wide range of salts. Because amiloride is a potent inhibitor of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC), ENaC has been proposed to function as a component of the salt-taste-receptor system. Previously, we showed that four of the five basic taste qualities-sweet, sour, bitter and umami-are mediated by separate taste-receptor cells (TRCs) each tuned to a single taste modality, and wired to elicit stereotypical behavioural responses. Here we show that sodium sensing is also mediated by a dedicated population of TRCs. These taste cells express the epithelial sodium channel ENaC, and mediate behavioural attraction to NaCl. We genetically engineered mice lacking ENaCalpha in TRCs, and produced animals exhibiting a complete loss of salt attraction and sodium taste responses. Together, these studies substantiate independent cellular substrates for all five basic taste qualities, and validate the essential role of ENaC for sodium taste in mice.",M1
20112818,"Inhibition of <e>sodium</e> current by carbamazepine in dorsal root ganglion neurons in vitro.Carbamazepine (CBZ), one of the most commonly prescribed antiepileptic drug, is proposed to inhibit Na+ channel. In this study, we have investigated the effects of CBZ on Na+ current, evoked in cultured dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons from neonatal rats using whole cell patch clamp technique. In small DRG neurons (20-25 microm), Na+ current was obtained by blocking K+ and Ca2+ currents with appropriate ion replacement and channel blockers. Separation of the Na+ current components was achieved on the basis of response to the conditioning voltage. The CBZ depressed Na+ current in a dose-dependent manner. The maximal Na+ current was depressed at 300 microM of CBZ, where 94 +/- 5.1% of depression was observed. The depression of normalized current amplitude was found to be 72 +/- 13.2%, 84 +/- 10%, 85 +/- 7.1% and 95 +/- 5.2% at 10, 30, 100 and 300 microM of CBZ concentrations, respectively, at -20 mV test pulse, when compared with control. The depression of current amplitude was observed as 48 +/- 12.3%, 42 +/- 15.2%, 71 +/- 17.7% and 90 +/- 5.8% at 10, 30, 100 and 300 microM of CBZ concentration, respectively, at 0 mV voltage pulse. The depression of Na+ currents was found to be dose-dependant at -20 and -10 mV but not at 0 mV, It is concluded that the depression of Na+ currents by CBZ may be responsible for inhibiting the neurotransmitter release.",M1
20100453,"Energy conservation by Rhodothermus marinus respiratory complex I.A <e>sodium</e> ion efflux, together with a proton influx and an inside-positive DeltaPsi, was observed during NADH-respiration by Rhodothermus marinus membrane vesicles. Proton translocation was monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy and sodium ion transport by (23)Na-NMR spectroscopy. Specific inhibitors of complex I (rotenone) and of the dioxygen reductase (KCN) inhibited the proton and the sodium ion transport, but the KCN effect was totally reverted by the addition of menaquinone analogues, indicating that both transports were catalyzed by complex I. We concluded that the coupling ion of the system is the proton and that neither the catalytic reaction nor the establishment of the delta-pH are dependent on sodium, but the presence of sodium increases proton transport. Moreover, studies of NADH oxidation at different sodium concentrations and of proton and sodium transport activities allowed us to propose a model for the mechanism of complex I in which the presence of two different energy coupling sites is suggested.",M1
20089129,"Na+/K+-ATPase inhibitor palytoxin enhances vulnerability of cultured cerebellar neurons to domoic acid via <e>sodium</e>-dependent mechanisms.Dysfunction or deficiency of the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase appears to be a common event in a variety of pathological conditions in the central nervous system. Studies on neurotoxicity associated to impaired Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity have focused on NMDA receptors, while the involvement of non-NMDA receptors has been much less explored. We show that mild, non-toxic, exposures to the Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase inhibitor palytoxin (PTX) synergistically sensitized the vulnerability of neurons to normally non-toxic concentrations of domoic acid, leaving NMDA receptor-mediated excitotoxic response unaltered. Enhancement of excitotoxicity required at least 1 h pre-exposure to PTX, was not observed after longer exposures to PTX, and did not require RNA synthesis. PTX caused a voltage-sensitive Na(+) channel-independent increase in intracellular Na(+). Both intracellular Na(+) increase and potentiation of excitotoxicity depended upon the external concentrations of Na(+) and Cl(-), and were suppressed by the anion exchanger blocker 4,4'-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2, 2'-disulfonic acid in a dose-dependent manner. Other stilbene derivatives, chloride channel antagonists or Na(+) cotransporter inhibitors proved ineffective. Our results demonstrate a crucial role for Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase activity in determining neuronal vulnerability to domoic acid-mediated excitotoxicity. They also raise reasonable concern about possible risks for human health associated to the ingestion of low amounts of phycotoxins PTX and domoic acid in food.",M1

Hypertonic saline (HS) maintains intravascular volume with less intravenous fluid than isotonic salt (IS) solutions, but may increase serum <e>sodium</e>. OBJECTIVES: To determine the benefits and harms of HS versus IS solutions administered to patients undergoing surgery. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), (The Cochrane Library) Issue 1, 2009; MEDLINE (1966 to 2009); EMBASE (1980 to 2009); LILACS (to August 2009) and CINAHL (1982 to 2009) without language restrictions. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomized clinical trials where HS was compared to IS in patients undergoing surgery, irrespective of blinding, language, and publication status. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We assessed the impact of HS administration on mortality, organ failure, fluid balance, serum sodium, serum osmolarity, diuresis and physiologic measures of cardiovascular function. We pooled data using odds ratio or mean difference (MD) for binary and continuous outcomes, respectively, using random-effects models. MAIN RESULTS: We included 15 studies with 614 participants. One death in each group and no other serious adverse events were reported. While all patients were in a positive fluid balance postoperatively, the excess was significantly less in HS patients (standardized mean difference (SMD) -1.43L, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.8 to 2.1 L less; P &lt; 0.00001). Patients treated with HS received significantly less fluid than IS-treated patients (MD -2.4L 95% (CI) 1.5 to 3.2 L less; P &lt; 0.00001) without differences in diuresis between the groups. Maximum intraoperative cardiac index was significantly increased with HS (SMD 0.6 L/min/M2 higher, 95% CI 0.1 to 1.0, P = 0.02) but Intraoperative pulmonary artery wedge pressure remained unchanged. While the maximum serum sodium and the serum sodium at the end of the study were significantly higher in HS patients, the level remained within normal limits (136 to 146 meq/L). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: HS reduces the volume of intravenous fluid required to maintain patients undergoing surgery but transiently increases serum sodium. It is not known if HS effects patient survival and morbidity but it should be tested in randomized clinical trials that are designed and powered to test these outcomes.",M1

20090423,"Impaired stretch modulation in potentially lethal cardiac <e>sodium</e> channel mutants.The presence of two slowly inactivating mutants of the cardiac sodium channel (hNa(V)1.5), R1623Q and R1626P, associate with sporadic Long-QT3 (LQT3) syndrome, and may contribute to ventricular tachyarrhythmias and/or lethal ventricular disturbances. Cardiac mechanoelectric feedback is considered a factor in such sporadic arrhythmias. Since stretch and shear forces modulate hNa(V)1.5 gating, detailed electrophysiological study of LQT-Na(V)1.5 mutant channel alpha subunit(s) might provide insights. We compared recombinant R1623Q and WT currents in control vs. stretched membrane of cell-attached patches of Xenopus oocytes. Macroscopic current was monitored before, during, and after stretch induced by pipette suction. In either mutant Na(+) channel, peak current at small depolarizations could be more than doubled by stretch. As in WT, R1623Q showed reversible and stretch intensity dependent acceleration of current onset and decay at all voltages, with kinetic coupling between these two processes retained during stretch. These two Na(V)1.5 channel alpha subunits differed in the absolute extent of kinetic acceleration for a given stretch intensity; over a range of intensities, R1623Q inactivation speed increased significantly less than did WT. The LQT3 mutant R1626P also retained its kinetic coupling during stretch. Whereas WT stretch-difference currents (I(Na)(V,t) without stretch minus I(Na)(V,t) with stretch) were mostly inhibitory (equivalent to outward current), they were substantially (R1623Q) or entirely (R1626P) excitatory for the LQT3 mutants. If stretch-modulated Na(V)1.5 current (i.e., brief excitation followed by accelerated current decay) routinely contributes to cardiac mechanoelectric feedback, then during hemodynamic load variations, the abnormal stretch-modulated components of R1623Q and R1626P current could be pro-arrhythmic.",M1
20071463,"Developmental effect of antenatal exposure to betamethasone on renal angiotensin II activity in the young adult sheep.Antenatal corticosteroids may have long-term effects on renal development which have not been clearly defined. Our objective was to compare the responses to intrarenal infusions of ANG II in two groups of year-old, male sheep: one group exposed to a clinically relevant dose of betamethasone before birth and one not exposed. We wished to test the hypothesis that antenatal steroid exposure would enhance renal responses to ANG II in adult life. Six pairs of male sheep underwent unilateral nephrectomy and renal artery catheter placement. The sheep were infused for 24 h with ANG II or with ANG II accompanied by blockade of the angiotensin type 1 (AT(1)) or type 2 (AT(2)) receptor. Baseline mean arterial blood pressure among betamethasone-exposed sheep was higher than in control animals (85.8 +/- 2.2 and 78.3 +/- 1.0 mmHg, respectively, P = 0.003). Intrarenal infusion of ANG II did not increase systemic blood pressure (P &gt;/= 0.05) but significantly decreased effective renal plasma flow and increased renal artery resistance (P &lt; 0.05). The decrease in flow and increase in resistance were significantly greater in betamethasone- compared with vehicle-exposed sheep (betamethasone P &lt; 0.05, vehicle P &gt;/= 0.05). This effect appeared to be mediated by a heightened sensitivity to the AT(1) receptor among betamethasone-exposed sheep. <e>Sodium</e> excretion initially decreased in both groups during ANG II infusion; however, a rebound was observed after 24 h. AT(1) blockade was followed by a significant rebound after 24 h in both groups. AT(2) blockade blunted the 24-h rebound effect among the vehicle-exposed sheep compared with the betamethasone-exposed sheep. In conclusion, antenatal corticosteroid exposure appears to modify renal responsiveness to ANG II by increasing AT(1)- and decreasing AT(2) receptor-mediated actions particularly as related to renal blood flow and sodium excretion.",M1
20083182,"Diuretic activity and kidney medulla AQP1, AQP2, AQP3, V2R expression of the aqueous extract of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus FRIES in normal rats.AIM OF THE STUDY: Zhuling, sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus FRIES, a Traditional Chinese Medicine, has long been used as a diuretic. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diuretic effect on the urinary electrolyte concentration (Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-)) and regulation of the relative mRNA expression of aquaporin-1 (AQP1), aquaporin-2 (AQP2), aquaporin-3 (AQP3) and vasopressin V(2) receptor (V(2)R) post-oral administration of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellata aqueous extract in normal rats. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Aqueous extract of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus (50 mg/kg, 250 mg/kg, 500 mg/kg) or the reference drug, furosemide (10mg/kg) were administrated orally to male SD rats and their urine output was quantified and collected 24h and 8 days after the treatment. The kidney medulla AQP1, AQP2, AQP3 and V(2)R mRNA relative expressions were measured with RT-PCR. RESULTS: After single dose of the exact of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellata, urine output was found to be significantly increased, which began at 4h, and at 24h after the treatment, the sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus extract and furosemide treatment produced the similar total volume of urine excreted. The extract increases urinary levels of Na(+), K(+), and Cl(-), to about the same extent, while furosemide increased urinary levels of Na(+) and Cl(-). After the 8-day doses, all two substances induced significant diuresis, natriuresis and chloriuresis. These two substances do not regulate the AQP1 and AQP3 mRNA level in normal rat kidney medulla. The AQP2 mRNA level of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellata extract was down-regulated significantly, the V(2)R mRNA level of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellata extract 50mg/kg dose group and 250 mg/kg dose group were down-regulated significantly too. Interestingly, the low-dose group had higher effect on regulation of AQP2 and V(2)R mRNA level. CONCLUSION: Aqueous extract of sclerotia of Polyporus umbellatus has conspicuous diuretic effect confirming its ethnopharmacological use. From the pattern of excretion of water, <e>sodium</e>, potassium, chlorine, AQP2 and V2R mRNA level, it may be logically concluded that it has effect from down-regulating AQP2, and down-regulate AQP2 by down-regulating V(2)R.",M1
20091493,"E-cadherin and claudin-4 expression has circadian rhythm in adult rat kidney.BACKGROUND: Urinary <e>sodium</e> excretion varies during the day. It is unknown whether expression levels of cell-cell junctions in the kidney are dynamic and associated with urinary sodium excretion. METHODS: Adult Sprague Dawley rats were fed ad libitum or exclusively during the day, or kept under fasting condition. We measured expression levels of Per2, E-cadherin and claudin-4 as representative molecules of the peripheral circadian clock, adherens junctions and tight junctions, respectively. We also measured sodium concentration in urine. Effects of aldosterone on expression levels of Per2 and claudin-4 were also studied. To see proliferating cells in the kidney, rats were labeled with 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine. RESULTS: In rats fed ad libitum, Per2, E-cadherin and claudin-4 mRNA showed robust circadian oscillation: the correlation coefficients (R values) of the cosinor fitting curves with a 24-hour cycle were 0.928, 0.999 and 0.983, respectively. Oscillation phases of these molecules shifted in response to restricted feeding (R=0.922, R=0.815 and R=0.821, respectively). E-cadherin and claudin-4 proteins also oscillated circadianly under ad libitum feeding (R=0.851 and R=0.999, respectively), which shifted in response to the restricted feeding (R=0.811 and R=0.985, respectively). Urinary sodium excretion was low when protein levels of E-cadherin and claudin-4 were high. Aldosterone or cell division did not account for mRNA oscillation of claudin-4 or E-cadherin in the kidney. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of E-cadherin and claudin-4 has a circadian rhythm. The dynamic change in protein levels of E-cadherin and claudin-4 seems to coincide with that in the level of sodium excretion.",M1
20071481,"Lack of hemodynamic effects after extended heme synthesis inhibition by succinylacetone in rats.Hypertyrosinemia (HT) is a life-threatening condition caused in large part by the buildup of tyrosine metabolites and their derivatives. One such metabolite is succinylacetone (SA), a potent irreversible inhibitor of heme biosynthesis. Heme is a key component of numerous enzymes involved in arterial blood pressure (BP) regulation, including nitric-oxide synthase (NOS) and its downstream mediator soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC). Because NOS and sGC are important regulators of cardiovascular function, we hypothesized that inhibition of heme supply to these enzymes by SA would result in the induction of a measurable hypertensive response. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with SA (80 mg x kg(-1) x day(-1) i.p.) for 14 days, resulting in a marked increase in urinary SA and delta-aminolevulinic acid (P &lt; 0.001 for both parameters) and decreased heme concentrations in kidney, liver, spleen, and vascular tissues (P &lt; 0.05 for all parameters). After SA treatment, systemic nitrite/nitrate excretion was reduced by 72% (P &lt; 0.001), and renal NOS and sGC activities were decreased by 32 (P &lt; 0.05) and 38% (P &lt; 0.01), respectively. SA administration also compromised the ex vivo sensitivity of aorta to endothelium-dependent and -independent vasodilation. Despite these effects, SA treatment failed to induce any changes in BP, as assessed by radiotelemetry. Moreover, BP profiles in the SA-treated animals were less responsive to altered <e>sodium</e> intake. The present results demonstrate that extended inhibition of heme synthesis with SA affects hemoenzyme function, albeit without consequent effects on BP regulation and sodium excretion.",M1

METHODS: We performed a retrospective cohort analysis of serum sodium and other analytes routinely evaluated in 100 stable chronic HD patients observed for 12 months. RESULTS: Individual levels across the cohort varied from 122 to 145 m M , but 12-month intraindividual coefficients of variation for sodium were low (pre-HD = 1.6%; post-HD = 1.8%) with overall variability similar to that related to laboratory assay variability especially when compared with other analytes (3.1-30.8%). Pre-HD serum sodium had a trend toward hyponatremia (mean 136 +/- 0.8 m M ). CONCLUSION: Serum sodium is stable over time in HD patients.

We hypothesized this may be attributable to impaired sodium homoeostasis by the remaining nephrons. The present study investigated whether a nephron deficit, induced by fetal uninephrectomy at 100 days gestation (term=150 days), resulted in (i) altered renal sodium handling both under basal conditions and in response to an acute 0.9% saline load (50 ml.kg-1 of body weight.30 min-1); (ii) hypertension and (iii) altered expression of renal channels/transporters in male sheep at 6 months of age. Uninephrectomized animals had significantly elevated arterial pressure (90.1+/-1.6 compared with 77.8+/-2.9 mmHg; P&lt;0.001), while glomerular filtration rate and renal blood flow (per g of kidney weight) were 30% lower than that of the sham animals. Total kidney weight was similar between the groups. Renal gene expression of apical NHE3 (type 3 Na+/H+ exchanger), ENaC (epithelium Na+ channel) beta and gamma subunits and basolateral Na+/K+ ATPase beta and gamma subunits were significantly elevated in uninephrectomized animals, while ENaC alpha subunit expression was reduced. Urine flow rate and sodium excretion increased in both groups in response to salt loading, but this increase in sodium excretion was delayed by approximately 90 min in the uninephrectomized animals, while total sodium output was 12% in excess of the infused load (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the present study shows that animals with a congenital nephron deficit have alterations in tubular sodium channels/transporters and cannot rapidly correct for variations in sodium intake probably contributing to the development of hypertension. This suggests that people born with a nephron deficit should be monitored for early signs of renal and cardiovascular disease.",M1

Excessive sodium intake is independently related to adverse blood pressure and is a key factor in the epidemic of prehypertension/hypertension. Identification of food sources of sodium in modern diets is critical to effective reduction of sodium intake worldwide. We used data from the INTERMAP Study to define major food sources of sodium in diverse East Asian and Western population samples. INTERMAP is an international, cross-sectional, epidemiologic study of 4, 680 individuals ages 40 to 59 years from Japan (four samples), People's Republic of China (three rural samples), the United Kingdom (two samples), and the United States (eight samples); four in-depth, multipass 24-hour dietary recalls/person were used to identify foods accounting for most dietary sodium intake. In the People's Republic of China sample, most (76%) dietary sodium was from salt added in home cooking, about 50% less in southern than northern samples. In Japan, most (63%) dietary sodium came from soy sauce (20%), commercially processed fish/seafood (15%), salted soups (15%), and preserved vegetables (13%). Processed foods, including breads/cereals/grains, contributed heavily to sodium intake in the United Kingdom (95%) and the United States (for methodological reasons, underestimated at 71%). To prevent and control prehypertension/hypertension and improve health, efforts to remove excess sodium from diets in rural China should focus on reducing salt in home cooking. To avoid excess sodium intake in Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States, salt must be reduced in commercially processed foods.",M2

Little is known about the knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to sodium consumption among Canadians. OBJECTIVE: To examine knowledge, attitudes and behaviours related to sodium consumption among a sample of Canadians 35 to 50 years of age. METHODS: A random-digit-dial telephone survey was conducted among adults aged 35 to 50 years of age in two regions in Ontario. Logistic regression was used to examine the likelihood of having taken action in the past 30 days to reduce sodium consumption, and the likelihood that respondents were intending to reduce sodium in the next six months. RESULTS: A total of 3130 interviews were completed. The majority of respondents were aware of excessive sodium consumption as a health issue and reported that they were taking action to reduce their dietary sodium intake. A large proportion of respondents did not correctly identify many foods as being high in sodium and, consequently, may have incorrectly believed they were consuming healthy amounts of sodium. Respondents who believed sodium reduction was important were more likely to have taken action to reduce sodium within the previous 30 days. Respondents who self-identified as consuming too much sodium were less likely to have taken action. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study suggest that in addition to policy changes designed to reduce the sodium content of foods, there is a need to address the low levels of knowledge surrounding sources of excessive sodium in popular Canadian foods, the importance of a reduced intake of sodium and the availability of lower-sodium alternatives.",M2

20427726,"Impact of elevated dietary <e>sodium</e> intake on NAD(P)H oxidase and SOD in the cortex and medulla of the rat kidney.Pathophysiological states, including cardiovascular and renal diseases, are characterized by oxidative stress but what is less clear is whether physiological challenges incur a degree of altered oxidative metabolism. To this end, this study examined whether exposure to a high dietary sodium intake could cause an oxidative stress at the kidney. Animals, placed on either 0.3% or 3% sodium diets for 2 wk, were given a lethal dose of anesthetic, and kidneys were removed to analyze both NAD(P)H oxidase (NOX) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) expression and activities in the cortex and medulla. Placing animals on the high-sodium diet raised sodium and water excretion and caused an approximately 14-fold increase in urinary excretion of 8-isoprostane, a marker of oxidative stress, which was attenuated by chronic treatment with apocynin to prevent NAD(P)H oxidase activity. The protein expression of the NAD(P)H oxidase subunits NOX2 and p47(phox) and overall NAD(P)H oxidase activity were approximately doubled in the cortex of the rats on the high-sodium diet compared with those on the normal sodium intake while both SOD activity and expression were unchanged. By contrast, neither NOX nor SOD protein expression or activity were altered in the medulla when the rats were placed on the high-sodium intake. These data suggest that an elevation in dietary sodium intake can lead to increased generation of reactive oxygen species and a state of oxidative stress in the cortex but not to such a degree that it extends to the medulla.",M2

Several countries, including the United States, are considering strategies to decrease population sodium intake. OBJECTIVE: To assess the cost-effectiveness of 2 population strategies to reduce sodium intake: government collaboration with food manufacturers to voluntarily cut sodium in processed foods, modeled on the United Kingdom experience, and a sodium tax. DESIGN: A Markov model was constructed with 4 health states: well, acute myocardial infarction (MI), acute stroke, and history of MI or stroke. DATA SOURCES: Medical Panel Expenditure Survey (2006), Framingham Heart Study (1980 to 2003), Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension trial, and other published data. TARGET POPULATION: U.S. adults aged 40 to 85 years. TIME HORIZON: Lifetime. PERSPECTIVE: Societal. OUTCOME MEASURES: Incremental costs (2008 U.S. dollars), quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and MIs and strokes averted. RESULTS OF BASE-CASE ANALYSIS: Collaboration with industry that decreases mean population sodium intake by 9.5% averts 513 885 strokes and 480 358 MIs over the lifetime of adults aged 40 to 85 years who are alive today compared with the status quo, increasing QALYs by 2.1 million and saving $32.1 billion in medical costs. A tax on sodium that decreases population sodium intake by 6% increases QALYs by 1.3 million and saves $22.4 billion over the same period. RESULTS OF SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS: Results are sensitive to the assumption that consumers have no disutility with modest reductions in sodium intake. LIMITATION: Efforts to reduce population sodium intake could result in other dietary changes that are difficult to predict. CONCLUSION: Strategies to reduce sodium intake on a population level in the United States are likely to substantially reduce stroke and MI incidence, which would save billions of dollars in medical expenses.

20308610,"Hypoxia-inducible factor prolyl-hydroxylase 2 senses high-salt intake to increase hypoxia inducible factor 1alpha levels in the renal medulla.High salt induces the expression of transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) 1alpha and its target genes in the renal medulla, which is an important renal adaptive mechanism to high-salt intake. HIF prolyl-hydroxylase domain-containing proteins (PHDs) have been identified as major enzymes to promote the degradation of HIF-1alpha. PHD2 is the predominant isoform of PHDs in the kidney and is primarily expressed in the renal medulla. The present study tested the hypothesis that PHD2 responds to high salt and mediates high-salt-induced increase in HIF-1alpha levels in the renal medulla. In normotensive rats, high-salt intake (4% NaCl, 10 days) significantly inhibited PHD2 expressions and enzyme activities in the renal medulla. Renal medullary overexpression of the PHD2 transgene significantly decreased HIF-1alpha levels. PHD2 transgene also blocked high-salt-induced activation of HIF-1alpha target genes heme oxygenase 1 and NO synthase 2 in the renal medulla. In Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats, however, high-salt intake did not inhibit the expression and activities of PHD2 in the renal medulla. Correspondingly, renal medullary HIF-1alpha levels were not upregulated by high-salt intake in these rats. After transfection of PHD2 small hairpin RNA, HIF-1alpha and its target genes were significantly upregulated by high-salt intake in Dahl salt-sensitive rats. Overexpression of PHD2 transgene in the renal medulla impaired renal <e>sodium</e> excretion after salt loading. These data suggest that high-salt intake inhibits PHD2 in the renal medulla, thereby upregulating the HIF-1alpha expression. The lack of PHD-mediated response to high salt may represent a pathogenic mechanism producing salt-sensitive hypertension.",M2

RESULTS: There were 19 independent cohort samples from 13 studies, with 177 025 participants (follow-up 3.5-19 years) and over 11 000 vascular events. Higher salt intake was associated with greater risk of stroke (pooled relative risk 1.23, 95% confidence interval 1.06 to 1.43; P=0.007) and cardiovascular disease (1.14, 0.99 to 1.32; P=0.07), with no significant evidence of publication bias. For cardiovascular disease, sensitivity analysis showed that the exclusion of a single study led to a pooled estimate of 1.17 (1.02 to 1.34; P=0.02). The associations observed were greater the larger the difference in <e>sodium</e> intake and the longer the follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: High salt intake is associated with significantly increased risk of stroke and total cardiovascular disease. Because of imprecision in measurement of salt intake, these effect sizes are likely to be underestimated. These results support the role of a substantial population reduction in salt intake for the prevention of cardiovascular disease.",M2
20178625,"Weight loss in individuals with metabolic syndrome given DASH diet counseling when provided a low <e>sodium</e> vegetable juice: a randomized controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Metabolic syndrome, a constellation of metabolic risk factors for type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is one of the fastest growing disease entities in the world. Weight loss is thought to be a key to improving all aspects of metabolic syndrome. Research studies have suggested benefits from diets rich in vegetables and fruits in helping individuals reach and achieve healthy weights. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of a ready to serve vegetable juice as part of a calorie-appropriate Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet in an ethnically diverse population of people with Metabolic Syndrome on weight loss and their ability to meet vegetable intake recommendations, and on their clinical characteristics of metabolic syndrome (waist circumference, triglycerides, HDL, fasting blood glucose and blood pressure).A secondary goal was to examine the impact of the vegetable juice on associated parameters, including leptin, vascular adhesion markers, and markers of the oxidative defense system and of oxidative stress. METHODS: A prospective 12 week, 3 group (0, 8, or 16 fluid ounces of low sodium vegetable juice) parallel arm randomized controlled trial. Participants were requested to limit their calorie intake to 1600 kcals for women and 1800 kcals for men and were educated on the DASH diet. A total of 81 (22 men &amp; 59 women) participants with Metabolic Syndrome were enrolled into the study. Dietary nutrient and vegetable intake, weight, height, leptin, metabolic syndrome clinical characteristics and related markers of endothelial and cardiovascular health were measured at baseline, 6-, and 12-weeks. RESULTS: There were significant group by time interactions when aggregating both groups consuming vegetable juice (8 or 16 fluid ounces daily). Those consuming juice lost more weight, consumed more Vitamin C, potassium, and dietary vegetables than individuals who were in the group that only received diet counseling (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The incorporation of vegetable juice into the daily diet can be a simple and effective way to increase the number of daily vegetable servings. Data from this study also suggest the potential of using a low sodium vegetable juice in conjunction with a calorie restricted diet to aid in weight loss in overweight individuals with metabolic syndrome.",M2

20168304,"The day-night difference of blood pressure is increased in AT(1A)-receptor knockout mice on a high-<e>sodium</e> diet.BACKGROUND: Abnormal circadian variation of blood pressure (BP) increases cardiovascular risk. In this study, we examined the influence of angiotensin AT(1A) receptors on circadian BP variation, and specifically on its behavioral activity-related and -unrelated components. METHODS: BP and locomotor activity were recorded by radiotelemetry in AT(1A)-receptor knockout mice (AT(1A)(-/-)) and their wild-type controls (AT(1A)(+/+)) placed on a normal-salt diet (NSD) or high-salt diet (HSD, 3.1% Na). RESULTS: The 24-h BP was lower in AT(1A)(-/-) than AT(1A)(+/+) mice on a NSD (92 +/- 2 and 118 +/- 2 mm Hg, respectively), whereas the day-night BP difference (DeltaDNBP) was similar between groups (11 +/- 2 and 12 +/- 1 mm Hg, respectively). HSD increased BP by 20 +/- 2 mm Hg and DeltaDNBP by 7 +/- 1 mm Hg in AT(1A)(-/-) mice, without affecting these parameters much in AT(1A)(+/+) mice. The DeltaDNBP increase in AT(1A)(-/-) mice was caused by nondipping BP during the inactive late-dark period. Conversely, BP rise associated with circadian behavioral activation during the early dark period was not altered by HSD in AT(1A)(-/-) mice. The BP change associated with spontaneous ultradian activity-inactivity bouts was also similar between strains on HSD as was the BP rise associated with induced (cage-switch) behavioral activity. Ganglionic or alpha(1)-adrenergic blockade decreased BP in both strains; HSD did not affect this response in AT(1A)(-/-), but abolished it in AT(1A)(+/+) mice. CONCLUSIONS: AT(1A)-receptor deficiency, when combined with HSD, can increase circadian BP difference in mice. This increase is mediated principally by activity-unrelated factors, such as the nonsuppressibility of basal resting sympathetic tone by HSD, thus suggesting a form of salt-/volume-dependent hypertension.",M2
20144658,"Role of serotonergic 5-HT1A and oxytocinergic receptors of the lateral septal area in <e>sodium</e> intake regulation.Several reports have revealed a high density of 5-HT(1A) receptors in the lateral septal area (LSA), as well as a subpopulation of oxytocin (OT) receptors. Increasing evidence shows that 5-HT(1A) and OT neurons inhibit sodium urinary excretion. The aim of this study was to investigate the part played by serotonergic (5-HT(1A)) and oxytocinergic receptors in the LSA in the sodium intake induced in rats by sodium depletion followed by 24h deprivation. Cannulae were implanted bilaterally into the LSA of rats to enable the introduction of receptor ligands into that brain area. Serotonergic injections of 5-HT (10, 20, and 40 microg/0.2 microL) reduced 1.8% NaCl solution intake, but injections (1, 2, and 4 microg/0.2 microL) of 8-OH-DPAT, a 5-HT(1A) agonist, were more effective than 5-HT in reducing 1.8% NaCl intake. Pretreatment of the LSA with the 5-HT(1A) antagonist pMPPF partially reduced the inhibitory effect of 5-HT and totally reversed the effects of 8-OH-DPAT on 1.8% NaCl intake induced by sodium depletion. Previous treatment with the potent oxytocin receptor antagonist d(CH(2))(5)[Tyr(Me)(2)Thr(4), Orn(5), Tyr(NH(2))(9)]-vasotocin also totally blocked the inhibitory effects of 5-HT or 8-OH-DPAT on 1.8% NaCl intake. These results show that 5-HT(1A) serotonergic receptors in the LSA, including some that interact with the oxytocinergic system, modulate sodium intake induced by sodium loss in rats.",M2
20130659,"Reducing dietary <e>sodium</e> intake: the Canadian context.Sodium is a required nutrient; Adequate Intakes for adults range from 1200 to 1500 mg*day(-1), depending on age. The Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL) for sodium is 2300 mg*day(-1) for adults, based on the relationship between sodium intake and increased blood pressure. Elevated blood pressure, which is prevalent among Canadians, is, in turn, a major risk factor for stroke, cardiovascular disease, and renal disease. Sodium intake is not the only determinant of blood pressure; other modifiable risk factors include relative mass, physical activity, overall dietary quality, and alcohol consumption. However, because &gt;90% of adult Canadian men and two thirds of Canadian women have sodium intakes above the UL, Health Canada's Working Group on Dietary Sodium Reduction has been charged with developing, implementing, and overseeing a strategy to reduce Canadians' sodium intakes. It is estimated that approximately 75% of dietary sodium is added during food processing; in addition to taste and palatability, sodium also has functional roles in food manufacturing and preservation, although the amounts used often exceed those required. Because of the central role of processed foods in sodium intake, the strategy proposed by Health Canada's Working Group includes voluntary reduction of sodium in processed foods and foods sold in food service establishments. It will also include an education and awareness campaign, and research and surveillance. Initiatives to reduce sodium in other parts of the world have demonstrated that it will be challenging to reduce sodium intake to the recommended range and will likely require many years to accomplish.",M2

20097874,"Dietary Na+ inhibits the open probability of the epithelial <e>sodium</e> channel in the kidney by enhancing apical P2Y2-receptor tone.Apical release of ATP and UTP can activate P2Y(2) receptors in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron (ASDN) and inhibit the open probability (P(o)) of the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC). Little is known, however, about the regulation and physiological relevance of this system. Patch-clamp studies in freshly isolated ASDN provide evidence that increased dietary Na(+) intake in wild-type mice lowers ENaC P(o), consistent with a contribution to Na(+) homeostasis, and is associated with increased urinary concentrations of UTP and the ATP hydrolytic product, ADP. Genetic deletion of P2Y(2) receptors in mice (P2Y(2)(-/-); littermates to wild-type mice) or inhibition of apical P2Y-receptor activation in wild-type mice prevents dietary Na(+)-induced lowering of ENaC P(o). Although they lack suppression of ENaC P(o) by dietary NaCl, P2Y(2)(-/-) mice do not exhibit NaCl-sensitive blood pressure, perhaps as a consequence of compensatory down-regulation of aldosterone levels. Consistent with this hypothesis, clamping mineralocorticoid activity at high levels unmasks greater ENaC activity and NaCl sensitivity of blood pressure in P2Y(2)(-/-) mice. The studies indicate a key role of the apical ATP/UTP-P2Y(2)-receptor system in the inhibition of ENaC P(o) in the ASDN in response to an increase in Na(+) intake, thereby contributing to NaCl homeostasis and blood pressure regulation.",M2
19763120,"Correlation between blood pressure responses to dietary <e>sodium</e> and potassium intervention in a Chinese population.BACKGROUND: Blood pressure (BP) responses to dietary sodium and potassium intake vary among individuals. We examined the correlation between BP responses to dietary low-sodium, high-sodium, and potassium supplementation interventions in a feeding study. METHODS: A total of 1,906 Chinese aged &gt; or = 16 years participated in the dietary intervention that included a 7-day low-salt intervention (51.3 mmol/day), a 7-day high-salt intervention (307.8 mmol/day), and a 7-day high-salt plus potassium supplementation (60 mmol/day) intervention. BP was measured nine times during the 3-day baseline observation and during the last 3 days of each intervention phase using a random-zero sphygmomanometer. RESULTS: The correlation coefficients (95% confidence intervals (CIs)) of the BP responses to low-sodium and high-sodium interventions were -0.47 (-0.51 to -0.44), -0.47 (-0.50 to -0.43), and -0.45 (-0.49 to -0.42) for systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), and mean arterial pressure (MAP), respectively (all P &lt; 0.0001). The correlation coefficients (95% CI) of the BP responses to high-sodium intervention and potassium supplementation were -0.52 (-0.56 to -0.49), -0.48 (-0.52 to 0.45), and -0.52 (-0.55 to -0.48) for SBP, DBP, and MAP, respectively (all P &lt; 0.0001). The kappa coefficients were moderate, varying from 0.28 to 0.34, between BP responses to low-sodium and high-sodium interventions (all P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate there is a moderate correlation between BP responses to low-sodium and to high-sodium interventions, and BP responses to high-sodium intervention and potassium supplementation. Furthermore, our study suggests that individuals who were more sensitive to high-sodium diet might benefit more from a low-sodium and/or high-potassium intervention aimed at lowering BP levels.",M2
20089957,"Projected effect of dietary salt reductions on future cardiovascular disease.BACKGROUND: The U.S. diet is high in salt, with the majority coming from processed foods. Reducing dietary salt is a potentially important target for the improvement of public health. METHODS: We used the Coronary Heart Disease (CHD) Policy Model to quantify the benefits of potentially achievable, population-wide reductions in dietary salt of up to 3 g per day (1200 mg of <e>sodium</e> per day). We estimated the rates and costs of cardiovascular disease in subgroups defined by age, sex, and race; compared the effects of salt reduction with those of other interventions intended to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease; and determined the cost-effectiveness of salt reduction as compared with the treatment of hypertension with medications. RESULTS: Reducing dietary salt by 3 g per day is projected to reduce the annual number of new cases of CHD by 60,000 to 120,000, stroke by 32,000 to 66,000, and myocardial infarction by 54,000 to 99,000 and to reduce the annual number of deaths from any cause by 44,000 to 92,000. All segments of the population would benefit, with blacks benefiting proportionately more, women benefiting particularly from stroke reduction, older adults from reductions in CHD events, and younger adults from lower mortality rates. The cardiovascular benefits of reduced salt intake are on par with the benefits of population-wide reductions in tobacco use, obesity, and cholesterol levels. A regulatory intervention designed to achieve a reduction in salt intake of 3 g per day would save 194,000 to 392,000 quality-adjusted life-years and $10 billion to $24 billion in health care costs annually. Such an intervention would be cost-saving even if only a modest reduction of 1 g per day were achieved gradually between 2010 and 2019 and would be more cost-effective than using medications to lower blood pressure in all persons with hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: Modest reductions in dietary salt could substantially reduce cardiovascular events and medical costs and should be a public health target.",M2

METHODS: African American patients with type 1 diabetes who participated in the baseline and 6-year follow-up examinations as part of the New Jersey 725 study were included. At the baseline examination, a food frequency questionnaire was used to document average daily dietary nutrient intakes. Clinical evaluations at baseline and at the 6-year follow-up also included a structured clinical interview, ocular examination, grading of 7 standard field stereoscopic fundus photographs, and blood pressure measurements. Biological evaluations included blood and urine assays. Nutrient intake data were analyzed using DietSys software and nutrient databases developed by the National Cancer Institute. RESULTS: Among the 469 participants at risk for progression of DR, baseline total caloric intake was significantly associated with 6-year incidence of vision-threatening DR (either proliferative DR or macular edema) and of severe hard exudates--after adjusting for clinical risk factors for DR progression. Baseline high sodium intake was a significant and independent risk factor for 6-year incidence of macular edema. CONCLUSIONS: In African American patients with type 1 diabetes, high caloric and sodium intakes are significant and independent risk factors for progression to severe forms of DR.

20016010,"Consumption of <e>sodium</e> and salted foods in relation to cancer and cardiovascular disease: the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective Study.BACKGROUND: Although the influence of salt, per se, on the risk of cancer or cardiovascular disease (CVD) might differ from that of salt-preserved foods, few studies have simultaneously examined the effects of sodium and salted foods on the risk of either cancer or CVD. OBJECTIVE: We simultaneously examined associations between sodium and salted food consumption and the risk of cancer and CVD. DESIGN: During 1995-1998, a validated food-frequency questionnaire was administered to 77,500 men and women aged 45-74 y. During up to 598,763 person-years of follow-up until the end of 2004, 4476 cases of cancer and 2066 cases of CVD were identified. RESULTS: Higher consumption of sodium was associated with a higher risk of CVD but not with the risk of total cancer: multivariate hazard ratios for the highest compared with lowest quintiles of intake were 1.19 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.40; P for trend: 0.06) for CVD and 1.04 (95% CI: 0.93, 1.16; P for trend: 0.63) for total cancer. Higher consumption of salted fish roe was associated with higher risk of total cancer, and higher consumption of cooking and table salt was associated with higher risk of CVD. Similar results were seen for the risk of gastric or colorectal cancer and stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Sodium intake as a whole salt equivalent may not increase the risk of cancer but may increase that of CVD. In contrast, salted food intake may increase the risk of cancer. Our findings support the notion that sodium and salted foods have differential influences on the development of cancer and CVD.",M2
19960392,"Strategies to reduce <e>sodium</e> consumption: a food industry perspective.The global high prevalence of hypertension and cardiovascular disease has raised concerns regarding the sodium content of the foods which we consume. Over 75% of sodium intake in industrialized diets is likely to come from processed and restaurant foods. Therefore international authorities, such as the World Health Organisation, are encouraging the food industry to reduce sodium levels in their products. Significant sodium reduction is not without complications as salt plays an important role in taste, and in some products is needed also for preservation and processing. The most promising sodium reduction strategy is to adapt the preference of consumers for saltiness by reducing sodium in products in small steps. However, this is a time-consuming approach that needs to be applied industry-wide in order to be effective. Therefore the food industry is also investigating solutions that will maintain the same perceived salt intensity at lower sodium levels. Each of these has specific advantages, disadvantages, and time lines for implementation. Currently applied approaches are resulting in sodium reduction between 20-30%. Further reduction will require new technologies. Research into the physiology of taste perception and salt receptors is an emerging area of science that is needed in order to achieve larger sodium reductions.",M2
19955402,"A systematic survey of the <e>sodium</e> contents of processed foods.BACKGROUND: Processed foods are major contributors to population dietary salt intake. Parts of the Australian food industry have started to decrease salt in a number of products. A definitive baseline assessment of current sodium concentrations in foods is key to targeting reformulation strategies and monitoring progress. OBJECTIVES: Our objectives were to systematically collate data on the sodium content of Australian processed food products and compare sodium values against maximum target levels established by the UK Food Standards Agency (UK FSA). DESIGN: Categories of processed foods that contribute the majority of salt to Australian diets were identified. Food-composition data were sought for all products in these categories, and the sodium content in mg/100 g (or mg/100 mL for liquids) was recorded for each. Mean sodium values were calculated for each grouping and compared with the UK FSA benchmarks. RESULTS: Sodium data were collected for 7221 products in 10 food groups, 33 food categories, and 90 food subcategories. The food groups that were highest in sodium were sauces and spreads (1283 mg/100 g) and processed meats (846 mg/100 g). Cereal and cereal products (206 mg/100 g) and fruit and vegetables (211 mg/100 g) were the lowest in sodium. Sixty-three percent of food categories had mean sodium concentrations above the UK FSA targets, and most had wide ranges between the most and least salty product. CONCLUSIONS: Many products, particularly breads, processed meats, and sauces, have salt amounts above reasonable benchmarks. The variation in salt concentrations between comparable products suggests that reformulation is highly feasible for many foods.",M2
19935850,"<e>Sodium</e> food sources in the Canadian diet.The purpose of this study is to provide information on the current sources of dietary sodium in the Canadian food supply to provide a baseline to measure against the effectiveness of strategies to reduce salt consumption. Such strategies are being developed by a Health Canada-led multistakeholder Working Group. Data from the 2004 Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2.2, Nutrition, were used to determine the leading food group contributors of sodium in the diet. The total sample size was more than 35,000 respondents. The results from this study were reported for 4 age and sex groups, namely, youths aged 1 to 8 years, youths aged 9 to 18 years, males aged 19 years and older, and females aged 19 years and older. Average daily intakes of sodium for these groups were 2388 mg, 3412 mg, 3587 mg, and 2684 mg, respectively. In all cases these intakes exceeded the tolerable upper intake level (UL) established by the Institute of Medicine, as well as targets set by the governments of the United Kingdom and the United States and the World Health Organization. The contribution of sodium to the food supply by the top 40 food groups is presented for each of the age and sex groups. The key food group contributors of sodium are breads (13.88%), processed meats (8.90%), and pasta dishes (5.67%). Although breads are found to be major contributors of sodium, this is mainly because of the large consumption, rather than a high concentration of sodium. Higher-sodium foods, such as processed meats, are eaten in smaller quantities but, because of their sodium density, contribute significant amounts of sodium to the diet of Canadians. Some very high sodium foods, such as frozen dinners, are eaten by only a small proportion of the population, but for those consuming these, the sodium could contribute a significant proportion of the UL just from a single meal.",M2
19900021,"Current options for the treatment of resistant hypertension.Patients with resistant hypertension are those who have uncontrolled blood pressure despite use of three or more antihypertensive medications, or those who require four or more medications to achieve control. When evaluating resistant hypertension it is important to rule out pseudoresistant hypertension that may result from factors including poor blood pressure measurement technique and the white coat effect. Potential contributing factors should be identified and reversed if possible, including obesity, excess alcohol intake and use of interfering medications such as NSAIDS, sympathomimetics and oral contraceptives. Modification of lifestyle factors such as weight loss, <e>sodium</e> restriction and physical activity is paramount for treatment success. Secondary causes of hypertension are common in this patient group and, therefore, appropriate screening tests should be carried out as necessary. Pharmacologic therapy is centered on combination therapy of medications from different mechanisms of action, especially diuretics, which are essential in maximizing antihypertensive effects. The role of mineralocorticoid antagonists is expanding, especially in patients with obstructive sleep apnea and obesity where aldosterone excess may be implicated. Finally, when appropriate, specialist referral may facilitate blood pressure reduction and the ability to meet target blood pressure goals.",M2

This study compared the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and renal sympathetic nerve activity (RSNA) responses to intracerebroventricular (i.c.v.) infusion of angiotensin II (AngII) and III (AngIII) before and after peripheral V(1) receptor blockade (V(1)B) in alpha-chloralose-urethane-anaesthetized rats fed a low (0.03%, LNa(+)), normal (0.3%, NNa(+)) or high Na(+) diet (3.0%, HNa(+)) from 4 to 11 weeks of age. The rise in MAP 2 min post AngII i.c.v. was greater in HNa(+) (14 +/- 3 mmHg) versus LNa(+) (8 +/- 1 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05) and after AngIII i.c.v. in HNa(+) (14 +/- 3 mmHg) versus NNa(+) (6 +/- 1 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05) and LNa(+) (7 +/- 1 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05). The MAP responses to AngII and AngIII i.c.v. were abolished after V(1)B in LNa(+), but were only attenuated in HNa(+). In NNa(+), V(1)B blunted the MAP responses to AngII and abolished those to AngIII. The MAP remained elevated 30 min after AngII in all groups, but returned to baseline levels 15 min after AngIII in NNa(+) and HNa(+) (P &lt; 0.01). Twenty minutes after i.c.v. AngII, RSNA rose above baseline in HNa(+) (112 +/- 1%), a response not observed in the LNa(+) and NNa(+) groups. Twenty minutes post AngIII i.c.v., RSNA was elevated in both HNa (109 +/- 2%) and NNa(+) (109 +/- 2%). After V(1)B, RSNA rose only in the HNa(+) group 15 min post AngIII infusion (109 +/- 1%). Together, these findings: (1) suggest that HNa(+) intake augments the MAP and RSNA responses to i.c.v. AngII and AngIII; (2) highlight an important role for peripheral V(1) receptors during these responses; and (3) differentiate the effects of AngII and AngIII on blood pressure and RSNA.",M2

19864488,"Disordered aldosterone-volume relationship in end-stage kidney disease.INTRODUCTION: <e>Sodium</e> loading, and subsequent volume expansion, suppresses aldosterone levels in individuals with normal renal function. We hypothesised that loss of renal function impairs this volume-aldosterone relationship. MATERIALS AND METHODS: With multifrequency bioimpedance spectroscopy, we measured total body water (TBW), extracellular volume (ECV), and intracellular volume in five haemodialysis patients at varied states of hydration and in five healthy volunteers during low-, normal-, and high-salt diets. Serum aldosterone, potassium, and C-reactive protein were measured simultaneously. Scatterplots and general estimating equations were used to examine the relationship among these variables. RESULTS: In healthy volunteers with salt loading, and in haemodialysis subjects with increased inter-dialytic weight gain, expansion of ECV led to reciprocal declines in serum aldosterone concentrations. The relationship was more profound in healthy volunteers (p&lt;0.001) than in haemodialysis subjects (p=0.1). Notably, haemodialysis subjects posted consistently higher levels of ECV (median 49.6% TBW, IQR 43.9-51.8% compared to 41.1%, 39.9-42.8% in volunteers) and serum aldosterone (median 26.7 ng/dl, IQR 19.8-29.6 compared to 12.4 ng/dl, 8.8-16.0 in volunteers). Serum potassium did not appear to influence aldosterone concentration (p=0.9). CONCLUSIONS: The shift of the volume-aldosterone curve in haemodialysis subjects suggests that end-stage kidney disease is a state of high volume and inappropriately high aldosterone. These data have important clinical implications, as dialysis patients may benefit from both volume reduction and mineralocorticoid receptor blockade.",M2
19896959,"Ontogenetic role of angiontensin-converting enzyme in rats: thirst and <e>sodium</e> appetite evaluation.We investigated the influence of captopril (an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor) treatment during pregnancy and lactation period on hydromineral balance of the male adult offspring, particularly, concerning thirst and sodium appetite. We did not observe significant alterations in basal hydromineral (water intake, 0.3M NaCl intake, volume and sodium urinary concentration) or cardiovascular parameters in adult male rats perinatally treated with captopril compared to controls. However, male offspring rats that perinatally exposed to captopril showed a significant attenuation in water intake induced by osmotic stimulation, extracellular dehydration and beta-adrenergic stimulation. Moreover, captopril treatment during perinatal period decreased the salt appetite induced by sodium depletion. This treatment also attenuated thirst and sodium appetite aroused during inhibition of peripheral angiotensin II generation raised by low concentration of captopril in the adult offspring. Interestingly, perinatal exposure to captopril did not alter water or salt intake induced by i.c.v. administration of angiotensin I or angiotensin II. These results showed that chronic inhibition of angiotensin converting enzyme during pregnancy and lactation modifies the regulation of induced thirst and sodium appetite in adulthood.",M2
19626043,"DASH lowers blood pressure in obese hypertensives beyond potassium, magnesium and fibre.The mechanism underlying blood pressure (BP) reduction in the high fruits and vegetables arm of the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study is unknown but may include potassium, magnesium and fibre. This study was designed to separate minerals and fibre from other components of DASH on BP in abdominally obese individuals with metabolic syndrome with pre-hypertension to stage 1 hypertension (obese hypertensives). A total of 15 obese hypertensives and 15 lean normotensives were studied on a standardized usual diet, randomized to DASH or usual diet supplemented with potassium, magnesium and fibre to match DASH, then crossed over to the complementary diet. All diets were 3 weeks long, isocaloric and matched for <e>sodium</e> and calcium. In obese hypertensives, BP was lower after 3 weeks on DASH than usual diet (-7.6+/-1.4/-5.3+/-1.4 mm Hg, P&lt;0.001/0.02) and usual diet supplemented (-6.2+/-1.4/-3.7+/-1.4 P&lt;0.005/0.06), whereas BP was not significantly different on usual and supplemented diets.

Small artery elasticity was lower in obese hypertensives than in lean normotensives on the usual and supplemented diets (P&lt;0.02). This index of endothelial function improved in obese hypertensives (P&lt;0.02) but not lean normotensives on DASH, and was no longer different from values in lean normotensives (P&gt;0.50). DASH is more effective than potassium, magnesium and fibre supplements for lowering BP in obese hypertensives, which suggest that high fruits and vegetables DASH lowers BP and improves endothelial function in this group by nutritional factors in addition to potassium, magnesium and fibre.",M2
19864947,"Regulation of circadian blood pressure: from mice to astronauts.PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Circadian variation is commonly seen in healthy people; aberration in these biological rhythms is an early sign of disease. Impaired circadian variation of blood pressure (BP) has been shown to be associated with greater target organ damage and with an elevated risk of cardiovascular events independent of the BP load. The purpose of this review is to examine the physiology of circadian BP variation and propose a tripartite model that explains the regulation of circadian BP. RECENT FINDINGS: The time-keeper in mammals resides centrally in the suprachiasmatic nucleus. Apart from this central clock, molecular clocks exist in most peripheral tissues including vascular tissue and the kidney. These molecular clocks regulate <e>sodium</e> balance, sympathetic function and vascular tone. A physiological model is proposed that integrates our understanding of molecular clocks in mice with the circadian BP variation among humans. The master regulator in this proposed model is the sleep-activity cycle. The equivalents of peripheral clocks are endothelial and adrenergic functions. Thus, in the proposed model, the variation in circadian BP is dependent upon three major factors: physical activity, autonomic function, and sodium sensitivity. SUMMARY: The integrated consideration of physical activity, autonomic function, and sodium sensitivity appears to explain the physiology of circadian BP variation and the pathophysiology of disrupted BP rhythms in various conditions and disease states. Our understanding of molecular clocks in mice may help to explain the provenance of blunted circadian BP variation even among astronauts.",M2

19750962,"Potential societal savings from reduced <e>sodium</e> consumption in the U.S. adult population.PURPOSE: Policies that address the food environment at the population level may help prevent chronic disease, but their value to society is still uncertain. Dietary sodium is linked to increased prevalence of hypertension, a primary risk factor for cardiovascular and renal diseases. This study calculates the potential societal savings of reducing hypertension and related cardiovascular disease via a reduction in population-level sodium intake. On average, U.S. adults consume almost twice the recommended maximum of dietary sodium, most of it from processed foods. DESIGN: This study modeled sodium-reduction scenarios by using a cross-sectional simulation approach. The model used population-level data on blood pressure, antihypertensive medication use, and sodium intake from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1999-2004). This data was then combined with parameters from the literature on sodium effects, disease outcomes, costs, and quality of life to yield model outcomes. MEASURES: This study calculated the following outcome measures: hypertension prevalence, direct health care costs, and quality-adjusted life years for noninstitutionalized U.S. adults. ANALYSIS: The simulation was conducted with STATA 9.2 and Microsoft Excel. Survey weights were used to calculate population averages. RESULTS: Reducing average population sodium intake to 2300 mg per day, the recommended maximum for adults, may reduce cases of hypertension by 11 million, save $18 billion health care dollars, and gain 312,000 QALYs that are worth $32 billion annually. Greater reductions in population sodium consumption bring even greater savings to society. CONCLUSIONS: Large benefits to society may result from efforts to lower sodium consumption on a population level by modest amounts over time. Although savings in direct health care costs are likely to be quite high, they could easily be matched or exceeded by the value of quality-of-life improvements.",M2
19760574,"[Evidence-based practice of fluid restriction in patients with heart failure]Heart failure (HF) is prevalent in the aging population. Both pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapies are employed in HF and have yielded significant improvements in survival and quality of life. Body fluid must be maintained at a level sufficient to ensure hemodynamic stability and adequate tissue perfusion, which may decrease neurohormonal activation caused by low cardiac output in patients with HF. However, shortness of breath and peripheral edema caused by fluid overload remain the most common clinical symptoms of HF, causing patient distress. In addition to routine pharmacologic approaches, fluid restriction is frequently suggested in HF management strategies. The purpose of this review of published studies that examined use of fluid/water restriction as an intervention was to determine the optimal fluid intake for HF patients in clinical practice. Four articles describing three clinical trials were identified via PubMed and CINAHL. Their findings suggest that patients with clinically stable HF receiving optimal pharmacological treatment may not benefit from fluid restriction. Patients in these studies had preserved renal function, however, and the trials had no long-term follow-up period. Clinicians choosing to restrict fluid intake for patients with HF should consider an individualized fluid prescription, potentially based on patient body weight, <e>sodium</e> intake, and likelihood of adherence. Further clinical trials are warranted to improve clinical practice in caring for patients with HF.",M2
19747457,"Non-NMDA receptors in the lateral parabrachial nucleus modulate <e>sodium</e> appetite.Glutamatergic mechanisms have been implicated in the control of fluid ingestion. In the present study, we investigated whether non-N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamatergic receptors in the lateral parabrachial nucleus (LPBN) are involved in the control of water and sodium intake. Male Sprague-Dawley rats had cannulas implanted bilaterally into the LPBN. They were acutely depleted of water and sodium by injections of the diuretic furosemide (Furo; 10 mg/kg, bw) and given a low dose of the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, captopril (Cap; 5 mg/kg, bw). Bilateral LPBN injections of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist DNQX (2 and 5 nmol/0.2 microl) increased the ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl and water of Furo/Cap treated rats. The increased ingestion produced by DNQX was abolished by pretreating the LPBN with alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA), a non-NMDA receptor agonist. AMPA injected alone into the LPBN reduced water and 0.3 M NaCl intake. Injections of DNQX (5 nmol/0.2 microl) into the LPBN also produced ingestion of 0.3 M NaCl after sc injections of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoproterenol, a hypotensive drug that typically produces only water intake. Food intake, arterial blood pressure and heart rate were not altered by DNQX LPBN injections. We conclude that agonists acting on non-NMDA receptors in the LPBN exert an inhibitory influence on sodium intake during acute fluid depletion with hypotension and after isoproterenol treatment. A possible interaction of serotonin with glutamate within the LPBN is discussed.",M2

Although habitual behaviors clearly influence chronic kidney disease (CKD), lifestyle change often is not stressed in the clinical setting. The purpose of this review is to provide a critical appraisal of the scientific basis for effects of lifestyle on CKD and practical strategies that promote healthy behaviors. This review begins with a clinical case presentation to provide context for the scientific discussion. Dietary composition of macronutrients, particularly protein intake, is highlighted. Clinical evidence is presented for avoiding protein excess, a contemporary problem in the typical overeating environment of the developed world. Concomitant approaches to balancing intake of carbohydrates and fats also are presented. Integration of <e>sodium</e> reduction with macronutrient adjustment is reviewed within the framework of managing blood pressure in the setting of CKD. Considering the emerging body of evidence for obesity-related CKD and associated complications, weight control is addressed from the standpoint of decreasing calories and increasing exercise. Finally, effects of smoking and alcohol use on CKD are discussed. In the spirit of active participation, which is essential to lifestyle change, the discussion returns full circle to a concluding statement from the clinical case patient who provides his point of view on lifestyle change while living with CKD.",M2
19901197,"Physiological genomics identifies estrogen-related receptor alpha as a regulator of renal <e>sodium</e> and potassium homeostasis and the renin-angiotensin pathway.Estrogen-related receptor alpha (ERRalpha) is an orphan nuclear receptor highly expressed in the kidney, an organ playing a central role in blood pressure regulation through electrolyte homeostasis and the renin-angiotensin system. Physiological analysis revealed that, relative to wild-type mice, ERRalpha null mice are hypotensive despite significant hypernatremia, hypokalemia, and slight hyperreninemia. Using a combination of genome-wide location analysis and expression profiling, we demonstrate that ERRalpha regulates the expression of channels involved in renal Na(+) and K(+) handling (Scnn1a, Atp1a1, Atp1b1) and altered in Bartter syndrome (Bsnd, Kcnq1). In addition, ERRalpha regulates the expression of receptors implicated in the systemic regulation of blood pressure (Ghr, Gcgr, Lepr, Npy1r) and of genes within the renin-angiotensin pathway (Ren1, Agt, Ace2). Our study thus identifies ERRalpha as a pleiotropic regulator of renal control of blood pressure, renal Na(+)/K(+) homeostasis, and renin-angiotensin pathway and suggests that modulation of ERRalpha activity could represent a potential avenue for the management of hypertension.",M2
19747470,"Gastric afferents project to the aldosterone-sensitive HSD2 neurons of the NTS.The HSD2 (11-beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase-type 2 enzyme) containing neurons of the nucleus tractus solitarius (NTS) become activated during low-<e>sodium</e> and high-aldosterone states such as hypovolemia. This response may be due to hormonal and/or neural signals. Hormonal signals may activate neurons in the area postrema that innervate the HSD2 neurons. The vagus nerve projects directly to the HSD2 neurons and this could be another route whereby these neurons receive information about systemic sodium/aldosterone status. The peripheral sites of origin that contribute to this vagal projection remain unknown, and in the present study, we injected the transganglionic tracer, cholera toxin beta-subunit-horseradish peroxidase (CTb-HRP), into wall of various gastrointestinal organs (stomach, small and large intestine) or liver of rats. Confocal microscopy of brainstem sections stained by a double immunohistochemical procedure was used to analyze whether the HSD2 neurons received axonal contacts from specific gastrointestinal structures. The major source of afferents arose from the stomach, mainly from its pyloric antrum, but a weaker input originated from the fundus region. A trace amount originated from the duodenum. The terminal part of the small intestine and large intestine did not to contribute to this projection. Similarly, no afferent inputs from the liver or portal vein were found. In conclusion, HSD2 neurons receive an input mainly from the stomach and these results are considered as potential sites affecting sodium intake.",M2

However, the relationship between neighborhoods and children's diet remains understudied. The aim of this research was to examine whether neighborhood disadvantage (eg, socioeconomic status, social and physical disorder) affected dietary quality among children. Data for this cross-sectional study were gathered between June 2005 and December 2008. Research participants included 182 children aged 7 to 12 years who were Hispanic (26%), white (28%), and African American (45%). Dietary intake was gathered via two 24-hour recalls and analyzed using the Nutrition Data System for Research. Descriptive statistics and analyses of variance were conducted to determine whether there were significant differences in dietary intakes by quartile grouping of neighborhood disadvantage. Multivariate linear regression analyses were used to determine whether neighborhood disadvantage (as a continuous measure) was associated with dietary quality. Overall, there were no significant differences in total caloric intake; however, children in disadvantaged neighborhoods consumed a greater percentage of calories from fat (P=0.039), trans fat (P=0.018), and had a higher <e>sodium</e> intake (P=0.01). The results suggest that neighborhood factors may contribute to dietary quality among children.

We show that the Caenorhabditis elegans gene, dkf-2, encodes not just DKF-2A, but also a second previously unknown isoform, DKF-2B. Whereas DKF-2A is present mainly in intestine, we show that DKF-2B is found in neurons. Characterization of dkf-2 null mutants and transgenic animals expressing DKF-2B, DKF-2A, or both isoforms revealed that PKDs couple DAG signals to regulation of <e>sodium</e> ion (Na+)-induced learning. EGL-8 (a phospholipase Cbeta4 homolog) and TPA-1 (a protein kinase Cdelta homolog) are upstream regulators of DKF-2 isoforms in vivo.

OBJECTIVE: To describe the baseline food and nutrient intake of the Look AHEAD (Action for Health in Diabetes) trial participants, compare participant intake to national guidelines, and describe demographic and health characteristics associated with food group consumption. METHODS: The Look AHEAD trial is evaluating the effects of a lifestyle intervention (calorie control and increased physical activity for weight loss) compared with diabetes support and education on long-term cardiovascular and other health outcomes. Participants are 45 to 75 years old, overweight or obese (body mass index [BMI] &gt; or = 25), and have type 2 diabetes. In this cross-sectional analysis, baseline food consumption was assessed by food frequency questionnaire from 2,757 participants between September 2000 and December 2003. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Descriptive statistics were used to summarize intake by demographic characteristics. Kruskal-Wallis tests assessed univariate effects of characteristics on consumption. Multiple linear regression models assessed factors predictive of intake. Least square estimates were based on final models, and logistic regression determined factors predictive of recommended intake. RESULTS: Ninety-three percent of the participants exceeded the recommended percentage of calories from fat, 85% exceeded the saturated fat recommendation, and 92% consumed too much <e>sodium</e>.

The study aimed to assess salt-sensitivity in normotensive young and elderly men. and assess their renin profile. Salt sensitivity was assessed in normotensive 44 young and 58 elderly males. Salt sensitivity was assessed by the difference of mean arterial pressure (MAP) on high (200 mmol/day) vs. low (40 mmol/day) <e>sodium</e> diet. Plasma rennin activity (PRA) was assessed during both diets. High salt diet led to significant increase in systolic blood pressure and MAP only in salt-sensitive subjects with peak levels in the elderly.

SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cross-sectional dietary survey carried out in 1998 and 1999 in nationally representative samples of adults (n=1474) and children (n=1018). Daily sodium and potassium intakes were estimated using a 7-day food record after exclusion of underreporters. RESULTS: Mean sodium intake was well above, whereas mean potassium intake was largely below the current recommendations in adults and children. The consumption of a high sodium and low potassium diet appeared very early in life and increased up to adulthood, especially in men living in small communities. Despite the fact that sodium and potassium intakes were positively correlated to each other and to total food intake, several food categories showed a sodium/potassium intake ratio well above one (cheeses, cooked pork meats, breads, breakfast cereals, soups, fast foods, pastries and sugary products) whereas others presented a ratio well below one (fruits, vegetables, dairy products, meats and hot beverages). CONCLUSIONS: High sodium and low potassium intakes were widespread in the population. The fact that the main dietary sources of sodium and potassium were, for the most part, not the same demonstrates the feasibility of simultaneously decreasing sodium intake and increasing potassium intake at the individual level [corrected].",M2

It is well known that high dietary sodium and low dietary potassium have been implicated in the etiology of increased blood pressure. However, the blood pressure response to dietary sodium and potassium intake varies considerably among individuals. In this study, we have detected that the haplotypes of the WNK1 gene are associated with blood pressure variations in the general Japanese population. In addition, we investigated the interactions between the haplotypes of the WNK1 gene and dietary sodium and potassium intake for determining inter-individual variations in blood pressure.

Wistar dams were maintained on 0.17 M NaCl instead of water from 20 days before mating until either the twentieth pregnancy day/parturition or weaning. Colorimetric methods were used to measure Ox in maternal and offspring tissues, PV, 24-h urinary protein (U(Prot24 h)) and serum triacylglycerols (TG) and cholesterol (Chol). Renal hemodynamics was evaluated in the offspring at 90 days of age using a blood pressure transducer, a flow probe and inulin clearance to measure mean arterial pressure (MAP), renal blood flow and glomerular filtration rate (GFR), respectively. The number of nephrons (NN) was counted in kidney suspensions. Dams showed unchanged PV, placental Ox and fetal weight but increased U(Prot24 h) (150%, P &lt; 0.05). Prenatally sodium-overloaded pups showed increased U(Prot24 h) (45%, P &lt; 0.05) but unchanged MAP, renal hemodynamics, NN and kidney Ox.

DESIGN: Simulation based on secondary data analysis; quantitative research. Measures include absenteeism, presenteeism, disability, and premature mortality under various hypothetical dietary changes. SETTING: United States. SUBJECTS: Two hundred twenty-five million adults. MEASURES: Findings come from a Nutrition Impact Model that combines information from national surveys, peer-reviewed studies, and government reports. ANALYSIS: We compare current estimates of national productivity loss associated with overweight, obesity, and hypertension to estimates for hypothetical scenarios in which national prevalence of these risk factors is lower. Using the simulation model, we illustrate how modest dietary change can achieve lower national prevalence of excess weight and hypertension. RESULTS: We estimate that permanent 100-kcal reductions in daily intake among the overweight/obese would eliminate approximately 71.2 million cases of overweight/obesity. In the long term, this could increase national productivity by $45.7 billion annually. Long-term sodium reductions of 400 mg in those with uncontrolled hypertension would eliminate about 1.5 million cases, potentially increasing productivity by $2.5 billion annually. More aggressive diet changes of 500 kcal and 1100 mg of sodium reductions yield potential productivity benefits of $133.3 and $5.8 billion, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The potential long-term benefit of reduced calories and sodium, combining medical cost savings with productivity increases, ranges from $108.5 billion for moderate reductions to $255.6 billion for aggressive reductions.

Salt was chosen as a central topic because of its multiple physiological and pathological effects, its importance to human health, its role in elevating blood pressure, the unresolved scientific issues, and the absence of an agreed public health response regarding dietary sodium. In addition, much current clinical and population research has begun to shed light on how the interaction of genetics, environment, and diet determines the impact of sodium intake on human health and disease. Surprisingly, given the often passionate professional interest, there has been no regular forum dedicated to an exchange of new knowledge and current research findings. The biomedical literature provides strong evidence that investigators around the world are generating important new findings that increase understanding of how dietary sodium may relate to both health and disease. Given the widely shared need and interest, the workshop's organizers hope that the experience in Xi'an will lead to the appearance of regular working meetings on sodium and human disease on the international scientific schedule.

Fifty-five triathletes and runners (30 males, 39.7 (8.0 S.D.) years; 25 females, 37.2 (9.2 S.D.) years) sip-tested chilled 6% carbohydrate drinks varying in sodium content during sedentary and pre-exercise conditions and had ad lib access to drinks during exercise conditions. There was a significant intensity discrimination among all sodium levels (p&lt;or=0.001) except 0 mmol/l vs. 18 mmol/l, and 30 mmol/l vs. 40 mmol/l. There were no significant differences among time points for perceived salt intensity. However, overall drink acceptability and liking of saltiness of the 60 mmol/l drink was greater pre-exercise, after 60 min and after 120 min of exercise than during the sedentary condition. The environmental cues of the exercise context may be associated with an increase in palatability of the drink containing 60 mmol/l of sodium over the sedentary condition. Sensory measures provided better differentiation (were more sensitive to treatment effects) among salt concentrations than was fluid intake. Neither thirst nor sweat loss were related to drink palatability or liking of saltiness. Liking of saltiness but not thirst was related to fluid intake.

Patients who restrict salt intake to &lt;6 g/day, and drink only when thirsty, should gain no more than 0.8 kg/day. Those with significantly greater weight gains, but predialysis serum sodium close to or higher than the dialysate sodium, need further review of their salt intake. Attempts to restrict fluid intake in these patients will be futile. Patients with high interdialytic weight gain (IDWG) and low predialysis sodium should be assessed for other reasons for fluid intake, such as high blood glucose or social drinking. For patients with poor tolerance of fluid removal during dialysis, and those who are hypertensive in the absence of fluid overload, a salt intake 5 g/day or less may be required. Dietary advice for these patients should be customized to ensure that they do not become malnourished.",M2
19107628,"Nutritional value of traditional Italian meat-based dishes: influence of cooking methods and recipe formulation.The present study provides a picture of the compositional figure and nutritive value of meat-based dishes typical of Italian culinary tradition. Recipes specific for a bovine meat cut (top-side) were selected among the most widespread ones in Italy: in pan, pizzaiola, cutlet, meat ball, and escalope. The total fat and cholesterol content varied depending on the ingredients utilized (extra-virgin olive oil, parmesan, egg). Meat-based dishes that utilized extra-virgin olive oil showed a significant reduction in palmitic and stearic acids and a parallel increase in oleic acid compared with raw meat; furthermore, the ratio among saturated fatty acids, monounsaturated fatty acids and polyunsaturated fatty acids shifted in favour of monounsaturated fatty acids. B vitamins were affected at different extent by heating; by contrast, vitamin E content increased because of the new sources of this vitamin, which masked losses due to heating. Ingredients (parmesan, discretionary salt) induced significant increases in the calcium and <e>sodium</e> concentrations compared with raw meat. The total iron content did not show marked differences in most of the meat-based dishes compared with raw meat; by contrast, losses in the heme-iron concentration were detected depending on the severity of heating treatments. Our findings suggest that heme iron, because of its important health aspects, might be a useful index of the nutritional quality of cooked meats.",M2

19549737,"Effects of salt supplementation on the albuminuric response to telmisartan with or without hydrochlorothiazide therapy in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes are modulated by habitual dietary salt intake.OBJECTIVE This prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study examined the effects of <e>sodium</e> chloride (NaCl) supplementation on the antialbuminuric action of telmisartan with or without hydrochlorothiazide (HCT) in hypertensive patients with type 2 diabetes, increased albumin excretion rate (AER), and habitual low dietary salt intake (LDS; &lt;100 mmol sodium/24 h on two of three consecutive occasions) or high dietary salt intake (HDS; &gt;200 mmol sodium/24 h on two of three consecutive occasions). RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Following a washout period, subjects (n = 32) received 40 mg/day telmisartan for 4 weeks followed by 40 mg telmisartan plus 12.5 mg/day HCT for 4 weeks. For the last 2 weeks of each treatment period, patients received either 100 mmol/day NaCl or placebo capsules. After a second washout, the regimen was repeated with supplements in reverse order. AER and ambulatory blood pressure were measured at weeks 0, 4, 8, 14, 18, and 22. RESULTS In LDS, NaCl supplementation reduced the anti-albuminuric effect of telmisartan with or without HCT from 42.3% (placebo) to 9.5% (P = 0.004). By contrast, in HDS, NaCl supplementation did not reduce the AER response to telmisartan with or without HCT (placebo 30.9%, NaCl 28.1%, P = 0.7). Changes in AER were independent of changes in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS The AER response to telmisartan with or without HCT under habitual low salt intake can be blunted by NaCl supplementation. By contrast, when there is already a suppressed renin angiotensin aldosterone system under habitual high dietary salt intake, the additional NaCl does not alter the AER response.",M2
19515740,"Relations between protein intake and blood pressure in Japanese men and women: the Circulatory Risk in Communities Study (CIRCS).BACKGROUND: An inverse association between protein intake and blood pressure has been reported in Western countries. However, the evidence is limited for Asians, whose protein sources are different from those in Western populations. OBJECTIVES: The objective was to examine the association between protein intake and blood pressure in Japanese adults. Methods: We conducted a population-based, cross-sectional study of 7585 subjects (3499 men and 4086 women) from 40 to 69 y of age living in 5 communities in Japan. Dietary intakes of total, animal, and plant protein were estimated by a single 24-h dietary recall. We then examined the associations between dietary intake of those proteins and blood pressure after adjustment for age, sex, community, body mass index, antihypertensive medication use, ethanol intake, smoking, and dietary intakes of <e>sodium</e>, potassium, and calcium. RESULTS: After adjustment for cardiovascular disease risk factors, a 25.5-g/d increment in total protein intake was associated with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 1.14 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure of 0.65 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001), and a 19.9-g/d increment in animal protein intake was associated with a decrease in systolic blood pressure of 1.09 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001) and in diastolic blood pressure of 0.41 mm Hg (P = 0.003). A 13.1-g/d increment in plant protein intake was associated with a decrease in diastolic blood pressure of 0.57 mm Hg (P &lt; 0.001). Further adjustment for nutritional factors weakened these associations, but the inverse associations of total protein intake with diastolic blood pressure and of animal protein intake with systolic blood pressure remained statistically significant. CONCLUSION: Total and animal protein intakes were inversely associated with blood pressure in Japanese adults.",M2
19325529,"Application of lower <e>sodium</e> intake recommendations to adults--United States, 1999-2006.In 2005-2006, an estimated 29% of U.S. adults had hypertension (i.e., high blood pressure), and another 28% had prehypertension. Hypertension increases the risk for heart disease and stroke, the first and third leading causes of death in the United States. Greater consumption of sodium can increase the risk for hypertension. The main source of sodium in food is salt (sodium chloride [NaCl]); uniodized salt is 40% sodium by weight. In 2005--2006, the estimated average intake of sodium among persons in the United States aged &gt;/=2 years was 3,436 mg/day. In 2005, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and U.S. Department of Agriculture recommended that adults in the United States should consume no more than 2,300 mg/day of sodium (equal to approximately 1 tsp of salt), but those in specific groups (i.e., all persons with hypertension, all middle-aged and older adults, and all blacks) should consume no more than 1,500 mg/day of sodium. To estimate the proportion of the adult population for whom the lower sodium recommendation is applicable, CDC analyzed data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) for the period 1999--2006. The results indicated that, in 2005--2006, the lower sodium recommendation was applicable to 69.2% of U.S. adults. Consumers and health-care providers should be aware of the lower sodium recommendation, and health-care providers should inform their patients of the evidence linking greater sodium intake to higher blood pressure.",M2
19487301,"Genetic and environmental risks for high blood pressure among African American mothers and daughters.OBJECTIVE: To determine the relationship between genetic and environmental lifestyle factors (physical activity and <e>sodium</e>) on blood pressure (BP) among African-American women. METHOD: In this cross-sectional study involving 108 African-American mothers and daughters from a Midwestern area, investigators obtained BP measurements, information on minutes of physical activity, amount of sodium intake, and buccal swab saliva samples. RESULTS: Of the 4 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on the sodium bicarbonate cotransporter gene (SLC4A5), rs8179526 had a statistically significant interaction with cytosine/thymine (C/T) genotype by sodium status on systolic BP (SBP; p=.0077). For gene x physical activity interaction, 2 significant interactions (cytosine/adenine [C/A] genotype by physical activity and adenine/adenine [A/A] genotype by physical activity, p=.0107 and p=.0171, respectively) on SBP and 1 on diastolic BP (DBP; A/A genotype by physical activity, p=.0233) were found on rs1017783. Two significant guanine/adenine [G/A] genotype by physical activity interactions were found on rs6731545 for SBP and DBP (p=.0160 and p=.0492, respectively). DISCUSSION: A gene x environmental interaction with rs8179526 has a protective effect on SBP in African-American women with high sodium intake. Participants with C/T genotype of rs8179526 who consumed greater than 2,300 mg of sodium had lower SBP than those who consumed less than recommended. Women with thymine/thymine (T/T) genotype of rs8179526 who consumed greater than 2,300 mg had lower SBP than those who consumed less. Awareness of both the protective and deleterious properties of rs8179526 in African-American women may one day assist in determining appropriate treatment plans.",M2
19474389,"Dietary <e>sodium</e> modulates the interaction between efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity and afferent renal nerve activity: role of endothelin.Increasing efferent renal sympathetic nerve activity (ERSNA) increases afferent renal nerve activity (ARNA), which in turn decreases ERSNA via activation of the renorenal reflexes in the overall goal of maintaining low ERSNA. We now examined whether the ERSNA-induced increases in ARNA are modulated by dietary sodium and the role of endothelin (ET). The ARNA response to reflex increases in ERSNA was enhanced in high (HNa)- vs. low-sodium (LNa) diet rats, 7,560 +/- 1,470 vs. 900 +/- 390%.s. The norepinephrine (NE) concentration required to increase PGE(2) and substance P release from isolated renal pelvises was 10 pM in HNa and 6,250 pM in LNa diet rats. In HNa diet pelvises 10 pM NE increased PGE(2) release from 67 +/- 6 to 150 +/- 13 pg/min and substance P release from 6.7 +/- 0.8 to 12.3 +/- 1.8 pg/min. In LNa diet pelvises 6,250 pM NE increased PGE(2) release from 64 +/- 5 to 129 +/- 22 pg/min and substance P release from 4.5 +/- 0.4 to 6.6 +/- 0.7 pg/min. In the renal pelvic wall, ETB-R are present on unmyelinated Schwann cells close to the afferent nerves and ETA-R on smooth muscle cells. ETA-receptor (R) protein expression in the renal pelvic wall is increased in LNa diet. In HNa diet, renal pelvic administration of the ETB-R antagonist BQ788 reduced ERSNA-induced increases in ARNA and NE-induced release of PGE(2) and substance P. In LNa diet, the ETA-R antagonist BQ123 enhanced ERSNA-induced increases in ARNA and NE-induced release of substance P without altering PGE(2) release. In conclusion, activation of ETB-R and ETA-R contributes to the enhanced and suppressed interaction between ERSNA and ARNA in conditions of HNa and LNa diet, respectively, suggesting a role for ET in the renal control of ERSNA that is dependent on dietary sodium.",M2
19462490,"Differential associations of dietary <e>sodium</e> and potassium  intake with blood pressure: a focus on pulse pressure.OBJECTIVE: Dietary sodium and potassium intakes are factors known to influence blood pressure (BP) through different pathways. These mechanisms likely result in differential effects on parameters characterizing BP. The aim of the study was to evaluate relationships between both sodium and potassium intake and all BP parameters--namely systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), pulse pressure (PP) and mean arterial pressure (MAP)--simultaneously in a large general population. METHODS: The present cross-sectional analysis was performed on 4919 middle-aged men and women, participants in the SU.VI.MAX study. Dietary intake was assessed through at least three 24-h dietary records. SBP and DBP were measured twice at a single visit after 10 min rest and averaged. Analysis of covariance was used to test for difference in BP parameters across tertiles of dietary sodium and potassium intakes. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, increased dietary sodium and potassium intakes were both significantly associated with increased BP parameters (P &lt; 0.0001). After relevant adjustments, sodium intake remained positively associated with PP (P = 0.006), whereas potassium intake became negatively associated with SBP, DBP and MAP (P &lt; or = 0.02) but was not linked to PP (P = 0.56). CONCLUSION: The positive association between dietary sodium intake and PP observed in the present study provides further evidence for the current concept linking sodium to rise in BP through modification and stiffening of the arterial wall, whereas negative associations between dietary potassium intake and both SBP and DBP, hence MAP, support the vasodilator properties of this latter nutrient.",M2
19573005,"Hyperosmolar <e>sodium</e> chloride, p38 mitogen activated protein and cytokine-mediated inflammation.Although there is increasing clinical evidence that high salt intake contributes to cardiovascular events and deaths seemingly independent of hypertension, the molecular mechanism for increased atherogenesis remains unclear. Vessel wall inflammation secondary to proinflammatory cytokines is one mechanism for atherogenesis. The role of mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) p38 in cytokine production such as IL-1, TNF-alpha, and IL-8 are well established. The link between inflammation and salt intake likely includes p38 MAPK as hyperosmolar sodium chloride triggers phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and stimulates gene expression and synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines. Hence a possible link of high salt intake, inflammation, and atherogenesis may be one molecular mechanism for the association of high salt intake and cardiovascular events.",M2
19407821,"Blood pressure reactivity to emotional stress is reduced in AT1A-receptor knockout mice on normal, but not high salt intake.Pharmacological evidence suggests that angiotensin II type 1 (AT(1)) receptors are involved in the regulation of cardiovascular response to emotional stress and reinforcing effect of dietary salt on this response. In this study, we examined the effect of genetic deletion of AT(1A) receptors on the cardiovascular effects of stress and salt in mice. AT(1A) receptor knockout (AT(1A)(-/-)) and wild-type (AT(1A)(+/+)) mice were implanted with telemetry devices and placed on a normal (0.4%) or high (3.1%) salt diet (HSD). Resting blood pressure (BP) in AT(1A)(-/-) mice (84+/-3 mm Hg) was lower than in AT(1A)(+/+) mice (107+/-2 mm Hg). Negative emotional (restraint) stress increased BP by 33+/-3 mm Hg in AT(1A)(+/+) mice. This response was attenuated by 40% in AT(1A)(-/-) mice (18+/-3 mm Hg). Conversely, the BP increase caused by food presentation and feeding was similar in AT(1A)(-/-) (25+/-3 mm Hg) and AT(1A)(+/+) mice (26+/-3 mm Hg). HSD increased resting BP by 14+/-4 mm Hg in AT(1A)(-/-) mice without affecting it significantly in AT(1A)(+/+) mice. Under these conditions, the pressor response to restraint stress in AT(1A)(-/-) mice (30+/-3 mm Hg) was no longer different from that in wild-type animals (28+/-3 mm Hg). The BP response to feeding was not altered by HSD in either AT(1A)(-/-) or AT(1A)(+/+) mice (25+/-2 and 27+/-3 mm Hg, respectively). These results indicate that AT(1A) receptor deficiency leads to a reduction in BP reactivity to negative emotional stress, but not feeding. HSD can selectively reinforce the cardiovascular response to negative stress in AT(1A)(-/-) mice. However, there is little interaction between AT(1A) receptors, excess dietary <e>sodium</e> and feeding-induced cardiovascular arousal.",M2
19384834,"Salt and its effect on blood pressure and target organ damage: new pieces in an old puzzle.For centuries, salt has been regarded as essential to human health. Recent work, however, has provided further evidence that the current dietary intake of salt in Western societies is an important factor in the genesis of essential hypertension and may even partly cause blood pressure-independent target organ damage including renal damage. Accordingly, recent guidelines recommend reduction of daily consumption of salt to 6 g/day. Individuals vary with respect to the increase of blood pressure with increasing salt intake (salt sensitivity); individuals with renal disease are particularly salt sensitive. Salt causes major alterations of renal hemodynamics and accelerates progression. Despite some opinions to the contrary, salt restriction and volume control is particularly important in dialyzed patients. Understanding of how salt affects blood pressure and renal function has recently been advanced in 2 respects. The past concept that salt acts by expanding the extracellular fluid space has been challenged by the demonstration of water-free <e>sodium</e> storage of salt in tissues. Furthermore, salt promotes the secretion of cardiotonic steroids, i.e., mammalian  digitalis.  Initial observations suggest a causal role for cardiotonic steroids in the genesis of cardiac abnormalities in advanced renal disease.",M2
19361897,"[Short-term effect of dietary-<e>sodium</e> intake on arterial blood pressure of patients treated with systemic corticosteroids: a prospective, randomised, crossover study]INTRODUCTION: It is unknown if the level of dietary-sodium intake influences blood pressure in patients receiving systemic corticosteroids. METHODS: Randomized, single centre, crossover trial involving patients starting systemic corticosteroid therapy and having initial blood pressure less or equals to 159/99 mm Hg. The first period of sodium regimen was randomized (&lt;3 g/j versus &gt;6 g/j) and each period of sodium regimen lasted 3 weeks. No washout period was performed. Blood pressure was recorded for each patient at inclusion and after 3 weeks and 6 weeks. Moreover, all patients were asked to record on a standardized questionnaire everything they ate during 1 week of each period regimen. Questionnaires were analysed by a dietician for mean daily energy and sodium intakes during each period. Mixed models were used to estimate the relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure variations. RESULTS: Between June 2006 and June 2008, 49 patients were randomized, 24 in group 1 (first period regimen=salt&lt;3g/day; women: 63%; mean age: 56+/-21 years; baseline prednisone dosage: 54+/-19 mg/day) and 25 in group 2 (first period regimen=salt&gt;6g/day; women: 56%; mean age: 60+/-19 years; baseline prednisone dosage: 56+/-16 mg/day). Mean daily salt intakes were 2.5+/-1.8 and 9.3+/-1.9 g/day during the first period and 7.8+/-3.2 and 3.8+/-2.9 g/day during the second period, respectively for group 1 and group 2. Blood pressure variations were not significantly associated with daily salt intakes or with randomisation group. No order effect was evidenced. By comparison with baseline, systolic blood pressure increased by greater than 20 mm Hg at week 6 in five patients (2 in group 1 and 3 in group 2). CONCLUSION: At short-term, sodium intake does not seem to influence blood pressure variations in patients starting systemic corticosteroids therapy.",M2
19166671,"Meals offered and served in US public schools: do they meet nutrient standards?BACKGROUND: Concerns about the diets of school-aged children and new nutrition recommendations for the US population have increased interest in the nutritional quality of meals available through the National School Lunch Program and School Breakfast Program. OBJECTIVE: This article updates national estimates of the food energy and nutrient content of school meals and compares these estimates to federal nutrient standards established under the 1995 School Meals Initiative for Healthy Children. DESIGN: Data were collected as part of the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study, a nationally representative cross-sectional study fielded during school year 2004-2005. Menu and recipe data for a typical school week were collected in a mail survey with telephone assistance. Nutrient information for common commercially prepared food items was obtained from manufacturers, to supplement the Food and Nutrient Database for Dietary Studies used to analyze the data. Analyses were conducted for meals offered and meals served to (selected by) children. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Samples of 130 public school districts that offered federally subsidized school meals, and 398 schools within those districts, participated in the study. Foodservice managers in each school completed a menu survey. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Descriptive tabulations present weighted means, proportions, and standard errors for elementary, middle, and high schools, and for all schools combined. RESULTS: Most schools offered and served meals that met the standards for protein, vitamins, and minerals. Fewer than one third of schools met the standards for energy from fat or saturated fat in the average lunch, whereas three fourths or more met the fat standards in school breakfasts. For both meals, average levels of <e>sodium</e> were high and fiber was low relative to Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005 recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: For school meals to meet nutrient standards and promote eating behaviors consistent with the Dietary Guidelines, future policy, practice, and research should focus on reducing levels of fat and sodium and increasing fiber.",M2
19262499,"Effects of salt substitute on pulse wave analysis among individuals at high cardiovascular risk in rural China: a randomized controlled trial.Reduced-<e>sodium</e>, increased-potassium salt substitutes lower blood pressure but may also have direct effects on vascular structure and arterial function. This study aimed to test the effects of long-term salt substitution on indices of these outcomes. The China Salt Substitute Study was a randomized, controlled trial designed to establish the effects of salt substitute (65% sodium chloride, 25% potassium chloride, 10% magnesium sulfate) compared with regular salt (100% sodium chloride) on blood pressure among 600 high-risk individuals living in six rural areas in northern China over a 12-month intervention period. Data on central aortic blood pressure, aortic pressure augmentation (AUG), augmentation index (AIx), the differences of the peak of first and baseline waves (P(1)-P(0)) and pulse wave reflection time (RT) were collected at randomization and at the completion of follow-up in 187 participants using the Sphygmocor pulse wave analysis system. Mean baseline blood pressure was 150.1/91.4 mm Hg, mean age was 58.4 years, 41% were male and three quarters had a history of vascular disease. After 12 months of intervention, there were significant net reductions in peripheral (7.4 mm Hg, P=0.009) and central (6.9 mm Hg, P=0.011) systolic blood pressure levels and central pulse pressure (4.5 mm Hg, P=0.012) and correspondingly there was a significant net reduction in P(1)-P(0) (3.0 mm Hg, P=0.007), borderline significant net reduction in AUG (1.5 mm Hg, P=0.074) and significant net increase in RT (2.59 ms, P=0.001). There were no detectable reductions in peripheral (2.8 mm Hg, P=0.14) or central (2.4 mm Hg, P=0.13) diastolic blood pressure levels or AIx (0.06%, P=0.96). In conclusion, over the 12-month study period the salt substitute significantly reduced not only peripheral and central systolic blood pressure but also reduced arterial stiffness.",M2

Eight vegetables and vegetables were studied. Plant foods Asparagus officinalis DC, Chlorophytum comosum Linn., Cordia myxa Roxb., Portulaca oleracia Linn. and Solanum indicum Linn. were collected in Behbehan, south Iran, and also Alocacia indica Sch., Eulophia ocherata Lindl. and Momordica dioica Roxb. were collected from the south of India. Nutrients were measured with food analytical standard methods. The results of this study provide evidence that these local traditional vegetables, which do not require formal cultivation, could be important contributors to improving the nutritional content of Pune and Behbehan people. Results indicate that 50% of the vegetables have significant energy values ranging from 281.4 to 303.9 kcal/100 g. From this study, it was determined that five vegetables, namely A. officinalis, C. comosum, E. ocherata, P. oleracia and S. indicum, provide mineral concentrations exceeding 2% of the plant dry weight and are much higher than typical mineral concentrations in conventional edible vegetables; they are thus recommended for future commercial cultivation.

19166672,"Nutritional quality of the diets of US public school children and the role of the school meal programs.BACKGROUND: Good nutrition is essential to healthy childhood. Because the school meal programs--the National School Lunch Program and the School Breakfast Program--are so widely available, they are in a unique position to influence the nutritional quality of children's diets. OBJECTIVE: This article assesses the nutritional quality of the diets of US public school children and explores the relationship between children's participation in the school meal programs and the nutritional quality of their diets. DESIGN: Data were collected as part of the third School Nutrition Dietary Assessment Study (SNDA-III), a nationally representative study fielded during school year 2004-2005. Data on children's dietary intakes were collected through in-person 24-hour dietary recalls. Nutritional quality of children's diets was assessed by estimating the prevalence of inadequate and excessive intakes of energy and nutrients. SUBJECTS/SETTING: The analysis is based on a nationally representative sample of 2,314 children in grades 1 through 12 from 287 public schools. STATISTICAL ANALYSES PERFORMED: Nutrient adequacy and excess were assessed by comparing usual nutrient intake distributions to Dietary Reference Intakes and the Dietary Guidelines for Americans 2005. Propensity score matching was used to examine the relationship between school meal program participation and the prevalence of inadequate and excessive intakes. RESULTS: The majority of public school children in the United States had nutritionally adequate diets, but 80% had excessive intakes of saturated fat and 92% had excessive intakes of <e>sodium</e>. School meal program participation was associated with reduced prevalence of nutrient inadequacy but with increased prevalence of excessive sodium intakes. CONCLUSIONS: School meal programs play an important role in the nutritional adequacy of children's diets. However, the association between program participation and excessive sodium intakes, along with the high prevalence of excessive saturated fat intakes among all students, suggest areas for improvement in the meals these programs provide.",M2
19265788,"Dietary <e>sodium</e> alters the prevalence of electrocardiogram determined left ventricular hypertrophy in hypertension.BACKGROUND: Determination of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) via electrocardiogram (ECG) is a known independent risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in hypertension (HTN). Dietary sodium and HTN are both associated with unfavorable alterations in left ventricular mass, however, to what extent their interplay affects ECG screening for LVH is unclear. METHODS: The effects of controlled dietary sodium manipulation on ECG determinants of LVH in hypertensive subjects were evaluated using well-established voltage criteria for LVH. ECGs from 80 hypertensive subjects were evaluated following random sequence assignment to 7 days of high sodium (HS) intake (200 mEq/24 h), and then 7 days of low sodium (LS) intake (10 mEq/24 h). RESULTS: Sodium restriction over 7 days resulted in significant decreases in overall, and LVH-specific, ECG voltages. Most subjects exhibited decrements in overall ECG voltage with sodium restriction (72%); however, a smaller subset displayed higher voltages when on LS intake (28%). The prevalence of ECG-determined LVH was significantly lowered with LS diet (HS diet 22/80 (28%) vs. LS diet 8/80 (10%), P &lt; 0.05). Subjects exhibiting reversal of LVH status with sodium restriction were younger, demonstrated salt sensitivity of blood pressure, and lower LVH-specific ECG voltage. CONCLUSIONS: Short-term dietary sodium fluctuations can significantly alter overall ECG voltage and the prevalence of ECG-determined LVH in hypertensive individuals. Inclusion of dietary sodium assessment when screening hypertensive subjects for LVH by ECG may improve the consistency of cardiac risk assessment.",M2
18849552,"The heart failure and <e>sodium</e> restriction controversy: challenging conventional practice.Optimal care of patients with heart failure requires a multifaceted approach that includes guideline-driven, evidence-based therapies, intensive patient education, careful initial and follow-up assessment, and appropriately constructed nutrition prescriptions. Central to the construct of the nutrition prescription is advice regarding sodium consumption. It is intuitively and generally agreed upon that sodium restriction is appropriate for patients with heart failure, despite the lack of evidence-based research studies. Whereas limiting sodium is most appropriate for the hypertensive patient at risk for developing heart failure and the patient who is overtly volume overloaded, less certainty exists regarding the sodium prescription for patients with diagnosed heart failure that is well compensated. Sodium intake is only 1 component of medical nutrition therapy, and prescription must be individualized according to nutrition assessment and priority of needs. However, in the absence of new compelling data, sodium restriction remains the most appropriate dietary intervention in general for patients with heart failure.",M2
19152919,"Changes in urinary stone risk factors in hypocitraturic calcium oxalate stone formers treated with dietary <e>sodium</e> supplementation.PURPOSE: We investigated the effects of supplemental dietary sodium on risk factors for urinary stone disease in stone forming patients with hypocitraturia. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten patients diagnosed with recurrent isolated hypocitraturic calcium urolithiasis were identified. Baseline 24-hour urinalysis was performed with patients on their regular diet, including citrate replacement with 20 mEq potassium citrate 3 times per day. Strict daily dietary logs were kept for a 7-day period, during which patients had normal oral intake and potassium citrate replacement. Patients then received supplemental sodium chloride for 1 week (1 gm orally 3 times per day), in addition to their regular diets and potassium citrate supplementation. Dietary logs were continued and 24-hour urinalysis was performed at the end of 1 week of supplemental sodium. Risk factors for urinary stone disease were compared using the Student t test and ANOVA. RESULTS: Two patients were unable to comply with sodium supplementation based on 24-hour urinalysis and, therefore, they were excluded from study. The remaining 8 patients were analyzed. Patients on supplemental dietary sodium demonstrated significantly increased mean urinary voided volume (933 ml per day above baseline, p &lt;0.05) and mean urinary sodium excretion (66 mEq per day above baseline, p &lt;0.05). There was no statistically significant change in urinary calcium, oxalate or uric acid. The urinary supersaturation relative risk ratio decreased for calcium oxalate stones (0.93 vs 0.63, p &lt;0.05), while those of brushite, struvite and uric acid were not different before vs after supplemental sodium. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary sodium supplementation resulted in an increased voided urine volume and decreased the relative risk supersaturation ratio for calcium oxalate stones in patients with a history of hypocitraturic calcium oxalate nephrolithiasis. Urinary calcium excretion as well as other urine parameters that are risk factors for nephrolithiasis was not changed. Sodium restriction may be inappropriate in patients with hypocitraturia and recurrent urinary stones. Sodium supplementation may be beneficial in these patients because it results in voluntary increased fluid intake.",M2

The renal artery flow (RBF, Transonic probe), medullary blood flow (MBF, laser-Doppler flux), renal excretion, and medullary tissue NO (selective electrode) were measured in male anaesthetized Wistar rats. We conclude that on standard Na(+) intake, opposed effects of 20-HETE and EETs are almost in equilibrium; however, in the renal circulation the vasodilator EETs influence slightly prevails. High sodium intake stimulates NOS, which limits CYP-450 impact on MABP and kidney function. However, this protection disappears after prolonged sodium intake. Long-lasting high sodium intake lowers NO bioavailability and promotes systemic and intrarenal vasoconstrictor activity of 20-HETE. Opposed effects of NO and AA metabolites of CYP-450 on water and solute excretion are also described.",M2
19115121,"Application of multivariate statistical techniques for differentiation of ripe banana flour based on the composition of elements.Major (<e>sodium</e>, potassium, calcium, magnesium) and minor elements (iron, copper, zinc, manganese) and one heavy metal (lead) of Cavendish banana flour and Dream banana flour were determined, and data were analyzed using multivariate statistical techniques of factor analysis and discriminant analysis. Factor analysis yielded four factors explaining more than 81% of the total variance: the first factor explained 28.73%, comprising magnesium, sodium, and iron; the second factor explained 21.47%, comprising only manganese and copper; the third factor explained 15.66%, comprising zinc and lead; while the fourth factor explained 15.50%, comprising potassium. Discriminant analysis showed that magnesium and sodium exhibited a strong contribution in discriminating the two types of banana flour, affording 100% correct assignation. This study presents the usefulness of multivariate statistical techniques for analysis and interpretation of complex mineral content data from banana flour of different varieties.",M2
19062112,"Does a low <e>sodium</e> diet modify heart rate variability? A randomised placebo-controlled double-blind trial.BACKGROUND: Increased heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with a low risk of mortality, as is consuming a low sodium diet. As the survival benefits of a low sodium diet may be mediated partly by an increase in HRV, we have tested the hypothesis that adopting a low sodium diet increases HRV. METHODS: We used a randomised double-blind placebo-controlled trial design. Participants were aged 18-65 years old, had a physician diagnosis of asthma. All adopted a low sodium diet and they were randomised to receive either 80 mmol/day of oral sodium supplements (normal sodium intake - NSI) or matched placebo (low sodium intake-LSI) for 6 weeks. The primary outcome was change in SDNN (standard deviation of the N-N intervals); secondary outcomes were changes in other time domain and frequency domain measures of HRV. RESULTS: In those allocated to the LSI, mean daily urinary sodium excretion decreased by 22 mmol; and in those allocated to the NSI mean daily urinary sodium excretion increased by 31 mmol. There were no differences between the two groups for either the primary or secondary outcome measures. The mean difference in change in SDNN between those who received the LSI compared to the NSI was -2.7 ms (95% Confidence Intervals CI; -18.0 to +12.6). CONCLUSIONS: Adopting a low sodium diet does not have an impact on SDNN over a 6 weeks period. Future studies should aim to achieve a larger change in dietary sodium intake for a longer duration than 6 weeks.",M2
19107627,"Intake of some minerals in healthy adult volunteers from eastern Croatia.Although minerals have important protective effects in human health, their role in nutrition is still underestimated and insufficiently investigated in Croatian population. The aim of this research was to examine <e>sodium</e>, potassium, magnesium, phosphorus, iron and copper intake in 120 adults, aged 18-54 years. The research was conducted using the 10 times repeated 24-h recall method during 1 year. Participants were separated according to age, as well as according to the sex and body mass index. There were significant differences in daily intake of sodium, potassium, magnesium and copper between age groups, but not for phosphorus and iron. When divided by sex, significant differences in daily intake were found for all minerals. When nutritive density was considered, significant difference was found only for potassium and magnesium regarding sex. In conclusion, considering recommendations, the sodium dietary intake of the examined population is too high, while the intake of iron is to low among women.",M2
19135993,"S 35171 exerts protective effects in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats by preserving mitochondrial function.S 35171 is one of a family of compounds that have been designed to protect mitochondrial function. We tested the hypothesis that S 35171 exerts protective effects in spontaneously hypertensive stroke-prone rats (SHRSPs), an animal model developing spontaneous brain damage preceded by proteinuria and systemic inflammation revealed by the urinary accumulation of acute-phase proteins (APPs) originating in the liver. Male SHRSPs fed a permissive diet received vehicle or S 35171 (10 mg/kg/day) started simultaneously with a high-<e>sodium</e> diet (group A) or after the establishment of proteinuria (group B). The drug delayed urinary APPs accumulation and the appearance of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-monitored brain lesions (after 62+/-3 days in group A, and 51+/-2 days in controls, P&lt;0.01). The delay was more pronounced in group B as 30% of the animals survived the entire 90-day experimental period without brain abnormality. Proteomic analysis showed no significant alteration in the expression pattern of brain mitochondrial proteins, but the liver mitochondrial levels of carbamoylphosphate synthase I (CPS-I), an enzyme involved in urea metabolism) and the antioxidant peroxiredoxin-3 spot were affected by hypertension and S 35171. Stress reduces CPS-I and induces the peroxiredoxin-3 spot, whereas S 35171 brought about normal CPS-I expression and a 12-fold higher level of the peroxiredoxin-3 spot. As both enzymes are involved in maintaining mitochondrial functions, their increased expression after S 35171 treatment may be responsible for delaying the pathological condition that leads to the development of brain damage in SHRSPs.",M2
19082636,"Influence of <e>sodium</e> intake on Amphotericin B-induced nephrotoxicity among extremely premature infants.Amphotericin B (AmphoB) remains the preferred therapy for invasive fungal infections despite many side effects, such as nephrotoxicity and electrolyte imbalance. Our previous study suggested that high sodium (Na) intake &gt;4 mEq/kg per day may be associated with lower nephrotoxicity in extremely premature infants treated with AmphoB. Subsequently, it became a standard of care in our unit to administer Na &gt;4 mEq/kg per day to extremely premature infants treated with AmphoB. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of high Na intake &gt; 4 mEq/kg per day on the incidence of AmphoB-induced nephrotoxicity among extremely premature infants with birth weight &lt;1250 gm. All extremely premature infants with birth weight &lt;1250 gm born between 1992 and 2004 and treated with AmphoB for systemic fungal infections were included in the study. The study infants were divided into two groups: a control (CL) group (1/1992-12/1999, n = 21) consisting of extremely premature infants given a maintenance Na intake during AmphoB therapy, and a high sodium intake (High Na) group (1/2000-12/2004, n = 16) consisting of extremely premature infants given a high Na intake &gt;4 mEq/kg per day during AmphoB therapy. Nephrotoxicity was defined as serum creatinine levels &gt;1 mg/dl, urinary output (UOP) &lt; 1 ml/kg per hour or a decrease in UOP of 50%, compared with the previous 2 days, and persisting for at least 2 days. Invasive fungal infection was diagnosed in 5.7% of the infants (44/763 infants). Thirty-seven infants were eligible for the study and seven were excluded. There were no differences between the two groups in gestational age, birth weight, age at fungal infection diagnosis, length of AmphoB therapy, daily fluid intake or hyponatremia. Nephrotoxicity was significantly higher in the CL group than in the High Na group (13/21 vs. 3/16; P = 0.02). In the CL group, nephrotoxicity occurred at (mean +/- SD) 1.9 +/- 3.2 days after the initiation of AmphoB treatment and lasted for 5.5 +/- 4.7 days. In this group, nephrotoxicity occurred in two of the 13 infants before the initiation of AmphoB therapy. In the High Na group, nephrotoxicity occurred before the start of AmphoB therapy in two of the three infants. In the third infant, nephrotoxicity lasted for 1 day. Mean Na intake was not different between the two groups during the 4-day period prior to AmphoB therapy. Mean Na intake during the first 10-day period of AmphoB therapy was significantly lower in the CL group (3.7 vs 6.2; P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: High Na intake was associated with a reduction in the incidence of AmphoB-induced nephrotoxicity in extremely premature infants with birth weight &lt;1250 gm. We recommend the use of a high Na intake of &gt;4 mEq/kg per day for extremely premature infants during Amphotericin B therapy.",M2
19277820,"Investigation of common Indian edible salts suitable for kidney disease by laser induced breakdown spectroscopy.Salt is an essential and important dietary mineral for maintaining life. Currently, the issue of the potential benefit or damage from salt intake in chronic kidney disease patients is controversial. The attempt of this article is to bring into focus the potential role of elements particularly <e>sodium</e>, Na, and potassium, K, which are the main constituents of dietary salts, in kidney patients by using laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy (LIBS). LIBS spectra of different salt samples have been recorded in the spectral region 200-500 nm with spectral resolution 0.1 nm and in the spectral region 200-900 nm with spectral resolution 0.75 nm. Quantitative elemental study was carried out to determine the constituents of different types of common Indian edible salts by using the calibration-free LIBS method. Our experimental results demonstrate that Saindha salt (commonly known as rock salt) is more beneficial than other edible salts for patients suffering from chronic kidney disease. The results of the quantitative elemental analysis of the salts obtained from LIBS measurements are also compared to atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS).",M2
19037590,"Effects of dietary <e>sodium</e> on reactive oxygen species formation and endothelial dysfunction in low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice on high-fat diet.Hypertension and high serum cholesterol level are important risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease. In the present study we tested the hypothesis whether high sodium intake, when given in combination with Western type high-fat diet, induces endothelial dysfunction and promotes atherosclerosis. Furthermore, the role and enzyme sources of increased oxidative stress were examined. Low-density lipoprotein receptor-deficient mice (LDLR(-/-)) and control C57Bl/6 mice received either high-fat, normal-sodium diet (fat 18% and cholesterol 0.5%; NaCl 0.7%; w/w) or high-fat, high-sodium diet (7% NaCl w/w) for 12 weeks. Superoxide formation was assessed by lucigenin enhanced chemiluminescence, endothelial functions were examined ex vivo, and atherosclerotic lesions from the aorta were assessed by light microscopy. High-fat, high-sodium diet increased systolic blood pressure in LDLR(-/-) mice but not in C57Bl/6 mice, whereas it induced cardiac hypertrophy in both mouse strains. Dietary combination of fat and sodium induced endothelial dysfunction in LDLR(-/-) mice. Preincubation with a superoxide scavenger Tiron normalized endothelial dysfunction, whereas the hydrogen peroxide scavenger catalase did not alter endothelial function. High sodium intake induced superoxide formation in LDLR(-/-) mice on high-fat diet. Stimulation of muscarinic receptors in the endothelial cells by acetylcholine increased superoxide generation, whereas preincubation with the nitric oxide synthase (NOS) inhibitor L-arginine methyl ester or endothelium removal reduced superoxide production. Inhibition of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-oxidase by apocynin decreased vascular superoxide formation whereas the xanthine oxidase inhibitor oxypurinol did not significantly affect oxidative stress in LDLR(-/-) mice. In conclusion, the detrimental effects of dietary sodium on endothelial function and progression of atherosclerosis in LDLR(-/-) mice on high-fat diet are mediated by increased ROS formation mainly through uncoupled NOS and NADPH oxidase. The present study also underscores the importance of superoxide and endothelial NOS uncoupling in the pathogenesis of endothelial dysfunction.",M2
19101237,"Medium term effects of different dosage of diuretic, <e>sodium</e>, and fluid administration on neurohormonal and clinical outcome in patients with recently compensated heart failure.Studies have shown that patients with compensated heart failure (HF) receiving high diuretic doses associated with normal sodium diet and fluid intake restrictions demonstrated significant reductions in readmissions and mortality compared with those who received low-sodium diets, and over a 6-month observation period, a reduction in neurohormonal activation was also observed. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different sodium diets associated with different diuretic doses and different levels of fluid intake on hospital readmissions and neurohormonal changes after 6-month follow-up in patients with compensated HF. Four hundred ten consecutive patients with compensated HF (New York Heart Association class II to IV) aged 53 to 86 years, with ejection fractions &lt;35% and serum creatinine &lt;2 mg/dl, were randomized into 8 groups: group A (n = 52): 1,000 ml/day of fluid intake, 120 mmol/day, and 250 mg furosemide twice daily; group B (n = 51): 1,000 ml/day of fluid intake, 120 mmol/day, and 125 mg furosemide twice daily; group C (n = 51): 1,000 ml/day fluid intake, 80 mmol/day, and 250 mg furosemide twice daily; group D (n = 51): 1,000 ml/day fluid intake, 80 mmol/day, and 125 mg furosemide twice daily; group E (n = 52): 2,000 ml/day fluid intake, 120 mmol/day, and 250 mg furosemide twice daily; group F (n = 50): 2,000 ml/day fluid intake, 120 mmol/day, and 125 mg furosemide twice daily; group G (n = 52): 2,000 ml/day fluid intake, 80 mmol/day, and 250 mg furosemide twice daily; and group H (n = 51): 2,000 ml/day fluid intake, 80 mmol/day, and 125 mg furosemide twice daily. All patients received the treatments &gt;or=30 days after discharge and for 180 days afterward. Signs of HF, body weight, blood pressure, heart rate, laboratory parameters, electrocardiograms, echocardiograms, brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, and plasma renin activity were examined at baseline and 180 days later. Group A showed the best results, with a significant reduction (p &lt;0.001) in readmissions, brain natriuretic peptide, aldosterone, and plasma renin activity compared with the other groups during follow-up (p &lt;0.001). In conclusion, these data suggest that the combination of a normal-sodium diet with high diuretic doses and fluid intake restriction, compared with different combinations of sodium diets with more modest fluid intake restrictions and conventional diuretic doses, leads to reductions in readmissions, neurohormonal activation, and renal dysfunction.",M2
18940294,"Relation of lack of knowledge about dietary <e>sodium</e> to hospital readmission in patients with heart failure.It has previously been demonstrated that patients with heart failure (HF) in an urban public hospital had significant gaps in knowledge regarding dietary sodium restriction. The objective of this study was to determine what risk factors were associated with such gaps in knowledge and to determine if these gaps in knowledge would increase the risk for HF readmission. A standardized test of sodium knowledge (scored 0 to 10) was administered prospectively to 97 hospitalized patients with HF &lt;48 hours before discharge. The incidence of 90-day hospital readmission for HF was compared between subjects with low dietary sodium knowledge (score 0 to 3) and the remainder of the cohort (score 4 to 10) in univariate and multivariate analyses. Another 48 patients with HF were prospectively recruited, and the dietary sodium knowledge test and a survey of psychosocial and other parameters, including the Test of Functional Health Literacy in Adults, a validated measure of health literacy, were administered. The 90-day readmission rate for HF was 3 times higher in those with low sodium knowledge than in the remainder of the cohort (28% vs 9%, p = 0.02). This association persisted in multivariate models adjusting for potential confounders. Low health literacy, but not other psychosocial parameters, was associated with low dietary sodium knowledge. In conclusion, low dietary sodium knowledge was an independent risk factor for 90-day HF hospital readmission in the urban setting. Deficiency in dietary sodium knowledge is one pathway through which low health literacy leads to adverse outcomes in patients with HF.",M2
19004159,"Measuring salt consumption to guide behavior change in applied settings: a critical review.OBJECTIVE: A critical review of the accuracy of salt consumption measurement can enhance future dietary <e>sodium</e> interventions. DATA SOURCE: A review of the measures of salt consumption was conducted with a focus on the measurement that may facilitate behavior modification. Measures were critiqued for factors known to threaten the validity of behavioral measurement in applied settings. STUDY INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA: The review included observational, interventional, and measurement studies that used at least one measure of behavior indicative of salt consumption. DATA EXTRACTION: Eighteen articles were retrieved by examining their definitions of salt consumption to ensure a measurement of behavior and a discussion of factors known to influence behavior and its measurement. DATA SYNTHESIS: Articles meeting the above criteria were critically reviewed for factors related to a valid measurement of behavior: participant and setting characteristics, measurement definitions, and measurement procedures. RESULTS: The results indicate that imprecise definitions of salt consumption and insensitive measurement tools limit valid measurement of salt-eating behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: Further research is needed to improve the specificity of measures of behaviors that are indicative of salt consumption and to produce tools that clinicians and patients may use for more accurate, and possibly real-time, salt consumption measurement. The increasing burden of cardiovascular disease in the aging U.S. population demands better methods to assess and subsequently control salt consumption in applied settings.",M2
18855262,"Causes and mechanisms of nondipping hypertension.Growing evidence indicates that nondippers have worsened cardiovascular outcomes than dippers. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring with a lack of nocturnal BP fall (nondipping) have also been shown to be more closely associated with target organ damage and worsened cardiovascular outcome than in patients with essential hypertension with dipping pattern. The underlying pathogenetic mechanisms potentially linking nondipping with cardiovascular disease are not fully understood. There are multiple possible underlying pathophysiologic mechanisms in the impaired BP decline during the night. Extrinsic and intrinsic factors including abnormal neurohormonal regulation, lack of physical activity, nutritional factors such as increased dietary <e>sodium</e> intake, and smoking of tobacco have been implicated for blunted circadian rhythm of BP. Certain diseases such as diabetes and chronic renal diseases also affect the circadian BP rhythm. Currently, the clinical importance of nondipping is known well; however, the relationship between certain disease states and nondipping has not been fully explained yet. This paper will attempt to address to clarify the underlying basis for nondipping and the specific associations with various disease states.",M2
18843231,"Acute effects of <e>sodium</e> ingestion on thirst and cardiovascular function.Sweating during exercise, especially during exercise in the heat, leads to sodium and water losses, and the quantity of these losses depends upon the intensity and duration of the activity, genetic predisposition and conditioning of the individual, and environmental factors. In athletes, adequate sodium intake is necessary to maintain fluid balance during training and competition. To ensure the precise regulation of volume and osmolality of body fluids, a number of integrated neural and hormonal systems have evolved to control thirst and sodium appetite. These systems respond to stimuli that arise from a deficit of fluid arising in both the intracellular and extracellular fluid compartments or to systemic hypertonicity. Thirst is highly sensitive to increases in plasma sodium concentration and osmolality, requiring only a 2%-3% increase to induce feelings of thirst. A larger change in plasma volume (10%) is required to induce thirst if there is no concomitant change in plasma sodium concentration. If plain water is used to replenish body water, plasma volume is preferentially restored over the interstitial and intracellular fluid space, suppressing plasma sodium concentration and removing the dipsogenic drive long before total body fluid has been restored. During or after dehydrating exercise, sodium ingestion helps to maintain and restore plasma volume and osmolality by continuing thirst sensation (thus drinking) and also by increasing body fluid retention. A high sodium meal or intravascular hypertonic saline infusion may cause transient osmotically mediated blood pressure increases, but in healthy people, acute sodium ingestion does not cause sustained hypertension. The purpose of this review is to provide evidence that acute increases in sodium are an intrinsic part of the thirst response during and after exercise, and that blood pressure increases associated with hypertonicity appear to be short lived.",M2
19022154,"Resistant hypertension: an overview of evaluation and treatment.Resistant hypertension is defined as failure to achieve goal blood pressure (BP) when a patient adheres to the maximum tolerated doses of 3 antihypertensive drugs including a diuretic. Although the exact prevalence of resistant hypertension is currently unknown, indirect evidence from population studies and clinical trials suggests that it is a relatively common clinical problem. The prevalence of resistant hypertension is projected to increase, owing to the aging population and increasing trends in obesity, sleep apnea, and chronic kidney disease. Management of resistant hypertension must begin with a careful evaluation of the patient to confirm the diagnosis and exclude factors associated with  pseudo-resistance,  such as improper BP measurement technique, the white-coat effect, and poor patient adherence to life-style and/or antihypertensive medications. Education and reinforcement of life-style issues that affect BP, such as <e>sodium</e> restriction, reduction of alcohol intake, and weight loss if obese, are critical in treating resistant hypertension. Exclusion of preparations that contribute to true BP treatment resistance, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents, cold preparations, and certain herbs, is also important. Lastly, BP control can only be achieved if an antihypertensive treatment regimen is used that focuses on the genesis of the hypertension. An example is volume overload, a common but unappreciated cause of treatment resistance. Use of the appropriate dose and type of diuretic provides a solution to overcome treatment resistance in this instance.",M2
