19779717,"High endoplasmic reticulum activity renders multiple myeloma cells hypersensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors.Multiple myeloma (MM) cells continuously secrete large amounts of immunoglobulins that are folded in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) whose function depend on the Ca(2+) concentration inside its lumen. Recently, it was shown that the ER membrane leaks Ca(2+) that is captured and delivered back by mitochondria in order to prevent its loss. Thus, we hypothesized that the highly active and abundant ER in MM cells results in greater Ca(2+)-regulation by mitochondria which would render them sensitive to mitochondrial inhibitors. Here, we indeed find that Ca(2+) leak is greater in 3 MM, when compared to 2 <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cell lines. Moreover, this greater leak in MM cells is associated with hypersensitivity to various mitochondrial inhibitors, including CCCP. Consistent with our hypothesis, CCCP is more potent in inducing the unfolded protein response marker, CHOP/GADD153 in MM versus B-cell leukemia lines. Additionally, MM cells are found to be significantly more sensitive to clinically used fenofibrate and troglitazone, both of which were recently shown to have inhibitory effects on mitochondrial function. Overall, our results demonstrate that the unusually high ER activity in MM cells may be exploited for therapeutic benefit through the use of mitochondrial inhibitors including troglitazone and fenofibrate.",M1
19285627,"Induction of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect without graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) by pretransplant donor treatment with immunomodulators.Pretransplant donor treatment with immunomodulators such as complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) or oligodeoxynucleotide sequences expressing CpG motifs (CpG), was applied in sublethally irradiated host mice inoculated with murine models of mammary carcinoma (4T1) or <e>B cell leukemia</e> (BCL1). Spleen cells or IL-2 activated splenocytes (lymphokine activated killer [LAK]) derived from donor mice treated with CpG emulsified in incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA), (CpG + IFA) did not cause graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), but were not efficient enough to induce a significant graft-versus-tumor (GVT) response against 4T1 cells. In contrast, an efficient graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effect was evident in BCL1-bearing mice inoculated with spleen cells from donors pretreated with CFA or CpG + IFA. Pretransplant donor treatment with CFA prolonged survival to a median of 62 days with 3 of 27 mice remaining GVHD- and leukemia-free for &gt;200 days, compared to GVHD-related death of all mice inoculated with na√Øve cells (median 17 days), or leukemia-related death of all mice inoculated with leukemia cells (median of 27 days). Pretransplant donor treatment with CpG + IFA exerted a more efficient GVL effect with reduced GVHD resulting in 12 of 26 GVHD- and leukemia-free survivors for &gt;200 days. Our results suggest that it may be possible to prevent GVHD while sparing an efficient GVL effect by using pretransplant donor treatment with immunomodulators prior to allogeneic stem cell transplantation and/or donor lymphocyte infusions in hematologic malignancies.",M1
19035318,"Impact of antigen-unloaded immature dendritic cells on antileukemic T-cell cytotoxicity.BACKGROUND: Immature dendritic cells (iDC) loaded with antigens are able to induce tolerance in antigen-specific T-cells. The potential of antigen-unloaded iDC to regulate the antileukemic cytotoxicity of autologous T-cells was determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS: iDC generated with 50 U/ml granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and very immature DC (viDC) generated with 10 U/ml GM-CSF from the bone marrow of Balb/c mice were used for T-cell co-culture. RESULTS: The measurement of cellular cytotoxicity against the syngeneic murine <e>B-cell leukemia</e> line A20 revealed that T-cells without co-culture or after co-culture with iDC exerted a similar cytotoxicity, whereas T-cells co-incubated with viDC showed a significantly diminished lysis of A20 cells (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Antigen-unloaded iDC in contrast to antigen-loaded iDC may not affect antileukemic T-cell cytotoxicity, whereas antigen-unloaded DC cultures generated with a low dose of GM-CSF are able to impair the T-cell-mediated cytolysis of leukemic cells.",M1
18591383,"Toll-like receptors: lessons to learn from normal and malignant human B cells.The humoral immune system senses microbes via recognition of specific microbial molecular motifs by Toll-like receptors (TLRs). These encounters promote plasma cell differentiation and antibody production. Recent studies have demonstrated the importance of the TLR system in enhancing antibody-mediated defense against infections and maintaining memory B cells. These results have led the way to the design of vaccines that target B cells by engaging TLRs. In hematologic malignancies, cells often retain B cell-specific receptors and associated functions. Among these, TLRs are currently exploited to target different subclasses of <e>B-cell leukemia</e>, and TLR agonists are currently being evaluated in clinical trials. However, accumulating evidence suggests that endogenous TLR ligands or chronic infections promote tumor growth, thus providing a need for further investigations to decipher the exact function of TLRs in the B-cell lineage and in neoplastic B cells. The aim of this review is to present and discuss the latest advances with regard to the expression and function of TLRs in both healthy and malignant B cells. Special attention will be focused on the growth-promoting effects of TLR ligands on leukemic B cells and their potential clinical impact.",M1
18510704,"U-2973, a novel B-cell line established from a patient with a mature <e>B-cell leukemia</e> displaying concurrent t(14;18) and MYC translocation to a non-IG gene partner.B-cell lymphomas/leukemias with simultaneous t(14;18)(q32;q21) and MYC rearrangements have recently been shown to constitute a separate diagnostic entity, presenting with a rapid clinical course and a very poor prognosis. We describe the establishment of an Epstein-Barr virus negative cell line, designated U-2973, from a male patient with a de novo aggressive B-cell lymphoma/leukemia and very high peripheral blast cell count. Flow cytometry of bone marrow cells and U-2973 displayed a mature B-cell phenotype, and immunostaining showed expression of MYC and BCL2. IG gene rearrangement data were consistent with a lymphoid neoplasm of germinal centre derivation. Cytogenetic studies using conventional G-banding, fluorescent in situ hybridization, spectral karyotyping and single nucleotide polymorphism array demonstrated a complex karyotype with both a t(14;18) and double translocations between MYC and a non-IG gene partner located at chromosome 12p12.1.",M1
18428432,"The role of hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with relapsed or primary refractory childhood B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mature <e>B-cell leukemia</e>: a retrospective analysis of enrolled cases in Japan.BACKGROUND: There have been excellent treatment results for children with B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma (B-NHL) and mature B-cell leukemia (B-ALL) in the last few decades. However, a small subset of relapsed or refractory patients, after first-line therapy, still have a poor prognosis. PROCEDURE: Thirty-three patients with relapsed or primary refractory B-NHL/B-ALL among 327 newly diagnosed patients between 1996 and 2004 were analyzed retrospectively. RESULTS: After salvage therapy, 18 patients were chemotherapy-sensitive and 15 patients suffered from progression. Among 18 patients who had a chemotherapy-sensitive disease, 4 of 5 patients who underwent hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) during remission survived without progression, while 3 of 12 patients who did not receive HSCT were alive without disease progression. Fifteen patients never sensitive to salvage therapy died. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with relapsed/primary refractory B-NHL/B-ALL have a poor prognosis with current treatment approaches, while the patients sensitive to salvage therapy have a respectable chance to achieve a sustained complete second remission with HSCT.",M1

17768389,"The effect of high-dose thiotepa, alone or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents, on a murine <e>B-cell leukemia</e> model simulating autologous stem cell transplantation.The use of thiotepa (TH) is increasing, especially in stem cell transplantation, mainly due to its safety and blood-brain barrier penetration. We evaluated the use of TH in a murine model simulating autologous stem cell transplantation, with or without additional agents. Between 1 and 11 days following inoculation of BALB/c mice with 10(5)-10(8) B-cell leukemia (BCL1) cells (simulating pre-transplant leukemia loads), each group received an 'induction-like' irradiation and/or cytotoxic regimen. Animals were either followed without treatment, or an adoptive transfer (AT) was performed to untreated BALB/c mice. Administered alone without AT, high-dose TH did not change the time to appearance of leukemia. Nevertheless, in the AT experiments, TH as a single agent showed better antileukemic activity than busulfan (BU). Cyclophosphamide (CY)-containing regimens were the most effective, and the TH-CY combination was as effective as the commonly used BU-CY combination, and more effective than the BU-TH combination. Moreover, a synergistic effect was seen in the TH-CY combination (none of the animals developed leukemia, whereas 4/10 animals in the CY-TBI group developed leukemia (P=0.029)). In conclusion, although TH produced only a moderate effect against BCL1 leukemia when used alone, its combination with CY is promising and should be tested further in allogeneic murine models and clinical studies.",M1
17704792,"Interleukin-7 induced facilitation of immunological reconstitution of sublethally irradiated mice following treatment with alloreactive spleen cells in a murine model of <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma (BCL1).Interleukin-7 (IL-7) plays a key role in maturation and function of both T and B cells. We investigate the potential use of recombinant human IL-7 for facilitation of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects mediated by T cells following transplantation in a murine model. Administration of IL-7 in vivo to allogeneic-transplanted mice improved disease-free survival: 67% of mice treated with IL-7 remained alive and disease free for more than 60 days, in comparison to 17% of the controls (P&lt;0.05). Similar results were obtained when C57BL/6 spleen cells sensitized against irradiated B-cell leukemia (BCL(1)) cells in the presence of IL-7 were transplanted to F(1) mice, followed by IL-7 treatment in vivo. Of the BALB/c mice that received spleen cells from F(1) mice treated with IL-7 following transplantation of C57BL/6 spleen cells sensitized with irradiated BCL(1) in the presence of IL-7, only 29% developed leukemia, as compared to 79% in the control group (P&lt;0.05). Mice treated with IL-7 showed increased splenic and thymic cellularity and improved T cell-dependent proliferative responses compared to the controls (P&lt;0.05). IL-7 may provide a novel tool to enhance immune reconstitution following transplantation of mismatched stem cells and for enhancement of GVL effects mediated by alloreactive lymphocytes.",M1
17189229,"Combined use of dendritic cells enhances specific antileukemia immunity by leukemia cell-derived heat shock protein 70 in a mouse model with minimal residual leukemia cells.We have reported that immunotherapy using leukemia cell-derived heat shock proteins (HSPs) is effective against minimal residual disease (MRD) after syngeneic stem cell transplantation (SCT) in mice. However, leukemia patients after SCT are usually immunocompromised and immunologically tolerant to leukemia cells. We investigated whether the use of dendritic cells (DCs) in combination with HSP70 enhances cytotoxicity against <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cell line A20 in mice after syngeneic SCT. All unimmunized mice died of leukemia early after A20 cell inoculation, whereas mice immunized with HSP70 or HSP70-pulsed DCs survived significantly longer. Although only 60% of the HSP70-immunized mice survived, all mice immunized with HSP70-pulsed DCs survived without MRD. In addition, the cytotoxicities against A20 cells for splenocytes from mice immunized with HSP70-pulsed DCs were significantly higher than those of HSP70-immunized mice, and the cytotoxicities against A20 cells were significantly blocked by anti-CD8 antibody and by major histocompatibility complex class I antibody, but not by anti-CD4 antibody. Moreover, abnormalities were detected in neither the biochemical data nor the histopathologic findings. These findings indicate that the combined use of DCs and leukemia cell-derived HSP70 enhances the antileukemia effect by inducing the specific cytotoxicities of CD8+ cytotoxic T-cells, thereby eradicating MRD effectively and safely, even in an immunocompromised state after syngeneic SCT. This approach may thus be useful for further application of HSP in leukemia patients after autologous SCT.",M1
16321836,"Trisomy 12-associated, t(11;14)-negative mature <e>B-cell leukemia</e> with gene expression profile resembling mantle cell lymphoma.Trisomy 12 can be seen in many different lymphoid neoplasms. However, many or most mature B-cell leukemias associated with isolated trisomy 12 are reported in the literature as chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) or 'atypical CLL'. This study reports a case of a mature B-cell leukemia, morphologically and immunophenotypically similar to cases previously published as atypical CLL, in which cytogenetic evaluation revealed an isolated clonal trisomy 12 but no evidence of the mantle cell lymphoma-associated t(11;14)(q13;q32). Further analysis confirmed absence of cyclin-D1 expression. Subsequent lymph node biopsy revealed evidence of large cell transformation of the underlying chronic lymphoproliferative disorder. Gene expression profiling of the initial peripheral blood sample using a cDNA micro-array of approximately 10,000 expressed genes revealed a close resemblance between the reported case and 2 cases of known mantle cell lymphoma. When further compared to 7 known 'typical' CLL cases, the reported case was classified as mantle cell lymphoma by hierarchical cluster analysis. The case reported here raises interesting questions regarding the nature of cases reported previously as trisomy 12-associated CLL and reinforces the fact that other leukemic lymphoproliferative disorders should be included in the differential diagnosis of such cases. Further study is indicated to elucidate the nature and diversity of disorders previously reported as trisomy 12-associated chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",M1
16266994,"Induction of early post-transplant graft-versus-leukemia effects using intentionally mismatched donor lymphocytes and elimination of alloantigen-primed donor lymphocytes for prevention of graft-versus-host disease.Graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects can be induced in tolerant mixed chimeras prepared with nonmyeloablative conditioning. GVL effects can be amplified by post-grafting donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI). Unfortunately, DLI is frequently associated with graft-versus-host disease (GVHD). We investigated the feasibility of induction of potent GVL effects by DLI using intentionally mismatched lymphocytes followed by elimination of alloreactive donor T cells by cyclophosphamide for prevention of lethal GVHD following induction of very short yet most potent GVL effects. Mice inoculated with <e>B-cell leukemia</e> (BCL1) and mismatched donor lymphocytes were treated 2 weeks later with low-dose or high-dose cyclophosphamide. All mice receiving cyclophosphamide 2 weeks after DLI survived GVHD, and no residual disease was detected by PCR; all control mice receiving DLI alone died of GVHD. Analysis of host (female) and donor (male) DNA showed that cyclophosphamide treatment eradicated most alloreactive donor cells, yet mixed chimerism was converted to full donor chimerism following transient self-limited GVHD. Our working hypothesis suggests that short-term yet effective and safe adoptive immunotherapy of leukemia may be accomplished early post-transplantation using alloreactive donor lymphocytes, with prevention of GVHD by elimination of GVL effector cells.",M1
15897589,"A bispecific recombinant immunotoxin, DT2219, targeting human CD19 and CD22 receptors in a mouse xenograft model of <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma.A novel bispecific single-chain fusion protein, DT2219, was assembled consisting of the catalytic and translocation domains of diphtheria toxin (DT(390)) fused to two repeating sFv subunits recognizing CD19 and CD22 and expressed in Escherichia coli. Problems with yield, purity, and aggregation in the refolding step were solved by incorporating a segment of human muscle aldolase and by using a sodium N-lauroyl-sarcosine detergent-based refolding procedure. Problems with reduced efficacy were addressed by combining the anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 on the same single-chain molecule. DT2219 had greater anticancer activity than monomeric or bivalent immunotoxins made with anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 sFv alone and it showed a higher level of binding to patient leukemia cells and to CD19(+)CD22(+) Daudi or Raji cells than did anti-CD19 and anti-CD22 parental monoclonal antibodies. The resulting DT2219, mutated to enhance its avidity, was cytotoxic to Daudi cells in vitro (IC(50) = 0.3 nmol/L). In vivo, DT2219 was effective in a flank tumor therapy model in which it significantly inhibited tumor growth (P &lt; 0.05) and in a systemic model in which it significantly prolonged survival of severe combined immunodeficient mice with established Daudi (P &lt; 0.008) compared with controls. DT2219 has broader reactivity in recognizing B-cell malignancies, has more killing power, and requires less toxin than using individual immunotoxin, which warrants further investigation as a new drug for treating B leukemia/lymphoma.",M1
15634450,"[Application of flow cytometry in the differential diagnosis of lymphoma/leukemia with aberrant antigen expression]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the application of flow cytometry in the differential diagnosis of lymphoma/leukemia with aberrant antigen expression. METHODS: The results of flow cytometry of 30 lymphoma/leukemia cases with aberrant antigen expression, of which 3 cases being lymphomas, 8 <e>B-cell leukemia</e>, 1 T-cell leukemia, 17 acute non-lymphoid leukemia and 1 acute non-lymphoid leukemia involving lymph nodes were analyzed. Immunohistochemistry (EnVision) for CD79a, CD3 and MPO was performed on all cases. RESULTS: Eleven cases of B-cell lymphoma/leukemia were cytoplasmic CD79a (cCD79a)-positive, cytoplasmic CD3 (cCD3epsilon) and cytoplasmic MPO (cMPO)-negative. Five of these cases were positive for CD5 and 2 for CD5, 1 or 2 for myeloid marker(s). The T-cell leukemia cases were cCD3epsilon-positive, cCD79a and cMPO-negative, they also co-expressed CD13 and CD33. The mantle cell lymphoma cases were positive for CD3, CD13 and CD33. Of the 8 B-cell leukemia cases, 4 were positive for CD5, 3 for CD13 and 1 for CD13 and CD33. The 18 acute non-lymphoid leukemia cases (including 1 acute non-lymphoid leukemia case involving lymph nodes) were cMPO-positive and cCD79a and cCD3epsilon-negative. Eight of the 18 expressed T-cell markers (including 1 case of acute non-lymphoid leukemia involving lymph nodes), 8 expressed B-cell markers, 2 expressed both T and B-cell markers. CONCLUSIONS: Flow cytometry can demonstrate aberrant antigen expression in lymphoma/leukemia cells and is helpful in delineating their cell origin. The technique is thus useful in the differential diagnosis of lymphoma/leukemia.",M1
15580294,"Evi3, a zinc-finger protein related to EBFAZ, regulates EBF activity in <e>B-cell leukemia</e>.Retroviral insertions that activate proto-oncogenes are a primary cause of tumors in certain strains of mice. The AKXD recombinant inbred mice are predisposed to a variety of leukemias and lymphomas as a result of viral integration. One common insertion site, the ecotropic viral insertion site 3 (Evi3), has been implicated in most B-cell tumors in the AKXD-27 strain. The Evi3 gene encodes a zinc-finger protein with sequence similarity to the Early B-cell Factor-Associated Zinc-finger gene (EBFAZ). We show that the Evi3 gene is overexpressed in several tumors with viral insertions at Evi3, which results in the upregulation of Early B-cell Factor (EBF)-target gene expression, suggesting that Evi3 modulates EBF activity. Reconstitution of primary leukemia cells showed that these tumors express high densities of the B-cell surface proteins CD19 and CD38, which are EBF targets. Using a transactivation assay, we show that the terminal six zinc-fingers of Evi3 are required for modification of EBF activity. This is the first evidence that Evi3 expression in tumors alters the level of EBF target genes, and the first characterization of the Evi3 protein domains required for modulation of EBF activity. Further, these data imply that Evi3 misexpression initiates tumorigenesis by perturbing B-cell development via an interaction with EBF.",M1
15378599,"Apoptotic effect of PP2 a Src tyrosine kinase inhibitor, in murine <e>B cell leukemia</e>.Src is a non-receptor protein tyrosine kinase that transduces signals regulating cell growth and differentiation. We report here that activation of signaling pathway after blockade of tyrosine phosphorylation by PP2 (4-amino-5-(4-chloro-phenyl)-7-(t-butyl)pyrazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine), a potent and selective inhibitor of the Src-family tyrosine kinase, can lead to cell death in murine B cell leukemia, 70Z/3. Death from PP2 occurred by apoptosis as indicated by the induction of caspase activation and annexin V/propidium iodide staining. Interestingly, PP2 was found to be able to enhance the DNA binding activity of nuclear factor kappaB (NF-kappaB) before induction of apoptosis without accompanying by increased phosphorylation of inhibitor of NF-kappaB-alpha (IkappaB-alpha). Additionally, immunoblotting analysis with PP2-treated cell extract demonstrated that, compared to other protein kinase C (PKC) isotypes, the translocation of novel PKC isotypes from the cytosol to membrane fraction was sustained for a longer time. These data suggest that the inhibition of Src-mediated tyrosine phosphorylation by PP2 may tilt the balance between each PKC isotypes, which in turn, activate NF-kappaB transcription factor, leading to apoptosis.",M1
15368550,"Outcome of children with primary resistant or relapsed non-Hodgkin lymphoma and mature <e>B-cell leukemia</e> after intensive first-line treatment: a population-based analysis of the Austrian Cooperative Study Group.BACKGROUND: Children and adolescents with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) and mature B-cell leukemia (B-ALL) have an excellent prognosis with contemporary chemotherapy stratified according to the histologic subtype and clinical stage of disease. However, a small subset of patients does not respond to front-line therapy or suffers from an early relapse. PROCEDURE: A retrospective analysis was performed to assess the incidence, treatment, and outcome of all children with relapsed or progressed NHL and B-ALL diagnosed in Austria between 1986 and 2003 (n = 22/234). RESULTS: Nine of 140 (6.5%) patients with B-cell NHL/B-ALL (relapse, n = 6; progress, n = 3) failed initial treatment. Four of them underwent a hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) as second-line therapy, two patients received intensive chemotherapy alone and in three patients treatment was palliative. Eight of the nine patients died of their disease. Four of 65 (6%) patients with lymphoblastic lymphoma (LBL) (relapse, n = 2; progress, n = 2) had a treatment failure. High-dose chemotherapy followed by HSCT was performed in two of the four patients; another two patients received chemotherapy alone. Three of the four patients died of resistant disease. Nine of 29 (31%) patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma (ALCL) (relapse, n = 7; progress, n = 2) failed first-line therapy. Six underwent a HSCT (autologous, n = 3; allogeneic, n = 3) and are currently in second complete remission. Treatment of the other three patients consisted of chemotherapy alone-they all died of tumor progression. CONCLUSIONS: Conclusively, patients with early relapsed and progressive B-cell neoplasia or LBL have a very poor prognosis with current treatment approaches, while those with ALCL have a respectable chance to achieve a sustained complete second remission with high-dose chemotherapy and HSCT.",M1

This article describes the 35S release cytotoxic assay, which measures the ability of NK cells derived from spleen cells taken from polyIC-treated mice to lyse B-cell leukemia (BCL1) cells.

14691303,"Activated proliferation of B-cell lymphomas/leukemias with the SHP1 gene silencing by aberrant CpG methylation.Previously we showed reduced protein and mRNA expression of the SHP1 gene in lymphoma/leukemia cell lines and patient specimens by Northern blot, RT-PCR, Western blot, and immunohistochemical analyses. In this study, aberrant methylation in the SHP1 gene promoter was detected in many <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma cell lines as well as in patient specimens, including diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (methylation frequency 93%), MALT lymphoma (82%), mantle cell lymphoma (75%), plasmacytoma (100%) and follicular lymphoma (96%) by methylation-specific PCR, bisulfite sequencing, and restriction enzyme-mediated PCR analyses. The methylation frequency was significantly higher in high-grade MALT lymphoma cases (100%) than in low-grade MALT lymphoma cases (70%), which correlated well with the frequency of no expression of SHP1 protein in high-grade (80%) and low-grade MALT lymphoma (54%). It suggests that the SHP1 gene silencing with aberrant CpG methylation relates to the lymphoma progression. SHP1 protein expression was recovered in B-cell lines after the treatment of the demethylating reagent: 5-aza-2'-deoxycytidine. Transfection of the intact SHP1 gene to the hematopoietic cultured cells, which show no expression of the SHP1 gene, induced growth inhibition, indicating that gene silencing of the SHP1 gene by aberrant methylation plays an important role to get the growth advantage of the malignant lymphoma/leukemia cells. The extraordinarily high frequency (75 to 100%) of CpG methylation of the SHP1 gene in B-cell lymphoma/leukemia patient specimens indicates that the SHP1 gene silencing is one of the critical events to the onset of malignant lymphomas/leukemias as well as important implications for the diagnostic or prognostic markers and the target of gene therapy. These data support the possibility that the SHP1 gene is one of the tumor suppressor genes.",M1

Initial treatment with NaHCO3 was ineffective. Treatment with a vitamin cocktail (OH-cobalamin, pyridoxine, thiamine, riboflavine, biotin, carnitine) at pharmacologic doses rapidly improved the child's clinical and laboratory status. Lactic acidosis was caused by an impairment of pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, which was due to lack of its necessary cofactor thiamine in the TPN. This case report indicates that lactic acidosis may be a front-line diagnosis in patients on TPN with lethargy and outlines the need for monitoring thiamine supply in TPN.",M1
14568412,"HPMA copolymer-bound doxorubicin targeted to tumor-specific antigen of BCL1 mouse <e>B cell leukemia</e>.N-(2-Hydroxypropyl)methacrylamide (HPMA) copolymer carrier containing the anticancer drug doxorubicin and targeted with B1 monoclonal antibody (mAb) to BCL1 leukemia cells was synthesised and tested in vitro and in vivo. BCL1 leukemia growing in syngenic Balb/c mice was selected as a tumor model system. B1 mAb recognising the idiotype of surface IgM on BCL1 cells was used as a targeting moiety. Both B1 mAb and doxorubicin were conjugated to HPMA copolymer carrier by aminolysis through a tetrapeptidic Gly-Phe(D,L)-Leu-Gly spacer to ensure the intracellular delivery and controlled release of the drug. B1 mAb-targeted conjugate was shown to possess strictly tumor-specific binding capacity to target BCL1 cells in vitro. A similar conjugate, but containing human nonspecific Ig (HuIg) instead of B1 mAb, failed to bind to BCL1 cells. In vitro, B1 mAb-targeted conjugate demonstrated 40-fold higher cytotoxic effect than nontargeted or human nonspecific Ig-containing HPMA copolymer-bound doxorubicin. Conjugate targeted with B1 mAb was also shown to bind to target BCL1 cells in vivo. B1 mAb-targeted conjugate was shown to be more efficient in the treatment of established BCL1 leukemia than free doxorubicin, nontargeted and human nonspecific Ig-containing conjugate. Antibody-targeted polymeric drugs are thus promising conjugates for cancer treatment.",M1
14563639,"E mu-BRD2 transgenic mice develop B-cell lymphoma and leukemia.Transgenic mice with lymphoid-restricted overexpression of the double bromodomain protein bromodomain-containing 2 (Brd2) develop splenic B-cell lymphoma and, upon transplantation, <e>B-cell leukemia</e> with leukemic infiltrates in liver and lung. Brd2 is a nuclear-localized transcription factor kinase that is most closely related to TATA box binding protein-associated factor, 250 kDa (TAF(II)250) and the Drosophila developmental protein female sterile homeotic. Constitutive expression of BRD2 in the lymphoid compartment increases cyclin A transcription,  priming  transgenic B cells for proliferation. Mice stochastically develop an aggressive B-cell lymphoma with the features of B-1 cells, including CD5 and surface IgM expression. The B-cell lymphoma is monoclonal for immunoglobulin gene rearrangement and is phenotypically stable. The lymphoblasts are very large and express a transcriptome that is similar to human non-Hodgkin lymphomas. Both a wild-type BRD2 transgene and a kinase-null point mutant drive lymphomagenesis; therefore we propose that, rather than kinase activity, Brd2-mediated recruitment of E2 promoter binding factors (E2Fs) and a specific histone acetyltransferase to the cyclin A promoter by both types of transgene is a mechanistic basis for neoplasia. This report is the first to describe a transgenic mouse model for constitutive expression of a protein with more than one bromodomain.",M1
12942096,"Allogeneic cell-mediated immunotherapy of leukemia with immune donor lymphocytes to upregulate antitumor effects and downregulate antihost responses.Donor lymphocyte infusion mediates most effective graft- versus-leukemia (GVL) effects following induction of host-versus-graft tolerance by transplantation of donor stem cells. This study was designed to maximize GVL effects across both major (MHC) and minor (mHgs) histocompatibility barriers in recipients inoculated with murine <e>B-cell leukemia</e> (BCL1), using specifically immune donor lymphocytes. GVL effects were induced with donor spleen cells from mice immunized across MHC or mHgs barriers with BCL/1 cells or normal BALB/c spleen cells. Our data suggest that spleen cells from donor mice immunized against murine B-cell leukemia of BALB/c origin, or to a lesser extent against normal host alloantigens, induce better therapeutic GVL effects with less great-versus-host disease (GVHD) across both mHgs and MHC. The cytokine profile of effector cells inducing predominantly GVL effects with reduced GVHD across MHC and mHg barriers consisted preferentially of upregulated IFN-gamma, IL-2, IL-10 and IL-12 in donors, implying a Th-1 to Th-2 cytokine shift. We hypothesize that immunotherapy with immune donor lymphocytes sensitized in vivo or in vitro with allogeneic tumor cells or normal host cells together with allogeneic BMT may provide an effective approach for amplifying GVL effects, while reducing procedure-related morbidity and mortality due to uncontrolled GVHD.",M1
12842998,"Generation of autologous cytotoxic and helper T-cell responses against the <e>B-cell leukemia</e>-associated antigen HB-1: relevance for precursor B-ALL-specific immunotherapy.Tumor relapses in patients with precursor B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BALL) occur frequently after primary treatment. Therefore, development of additional treatment modalities to eliminate residual tumor cells is needed. Active immunotherapy using dendritic cells (DCs) loaded with tumor-associated antigens is a promising approach to induce specific T-cell immunity in patients with cancer. In previous studies, we described HB-1 as a B-cell lineage-specific antigen that is recognized by donor-derived cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) on allogeneic B-ALL tumor cells. Here, we investigated the potential use of the HB-1 antigen as an autologous T-cell vaccine target. To determine whether HB-1-specific CTL precursors are present within the T-cell repertoire, we induced expansion of CD8+ T cells using mature monocyte-derived DCs pulsed with the previously identified HB-1.B44 antigenic peptide. In 6 of 8 donors, CD8+ CTL lines have been generated that exert cytotoxicity against target cells exogenously pulsed with peptide or endogenously expressing the HB-1 antigen. From one of these HB-1-specific T-cell lines, we isolated a CD8+ CTL that produces interferon-gamma on stimulation with B-ALL tumor cells. Interestingly, the HB-1 antigen also induced CD4+ T-helper responses on activation with protein-loaded mature monocyte-derived DCs. We identified 2 novel epitopes recognized in the context of HLA-DR4 and HLA-DR11 with the use of HB-1-specific CD4+ T-cell clones generated from different donors. These present data, that HB-1 induces both helper and cytotoxic T-cell responses, indicate that the HB-1 antigen is a candidate target to induce T-cell-mediated antitumor immunity in patients.",M1

Significant postmortem findings included a diffusely enlarged, dark-red friable liver, mild splenomegaly, and mild mesenteric lymphadenopathy. Examination of multiple tissue sections revealed intravascular atypical mononuclear cells in all tissues examined, with a leukemic pattern of infiltration of mesenteric lymph nodes, liver, lung, and spleen. Neoplastic cells were positive for CD79a and negative for CD-3, BLA.36, and CD68 leukocytic markers. The final diagnosis was B-cell leukemia.",M1

Here we report the results of studies, in which the purine analogue, fludarabine phosphate, was used in an attempt to modify and decrease GVHD after stem cell transplantation, across major histocompatibility barriers for murine leukemia. <e>B-cell leukemia</e> (BCL-1) bearing (BALB/c x C57BL/6) F1 mice received two cycles of fludarabine (0.8 mg/kg) for 5 days every 2 weeks, followed by 400 mg/kg cyclophosphamide i.p. Animals were then transplanted with C57BL/6 precursor cells and the development of leukemia and extent of GVHD was monitored both clinically and histopathologically. In the fludarabine-treated group, only nine of 28 (32%) mice developed leukemia, compared to 25 of 33 (76%) of control animals (P=0.0006 ). Mice treated with fludarabine-containing regimens prior to transplantation also had much less GVHD both clinically and at autopsy, while graft-versus-leukemia appeared to be augmented in the same animals.",M1

Linomide given in the drinking water had no impact on graft survival or graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects. Although linomide regulates anti-self reactivity in mice with experimental and spontaneous autoimmune disorders, the anti-tumor effects induced by allogeneic donor lymphocytes were not affected. This indicates that different mechanisms regulate anti-self and anti-leukemia effects. Alternatively, linomide might affect the homing of self-reactive lymphocytes to specific target organs in autoimmune disorders, although the homing process may not be relevant to the control of leukemia by alloreactive lymphocytes.",M1

12079276,"Characterization of FAM10A4, a member of the ST13 tumor suppressor gene family that maps to the 13q14.3 region associated with <e>B-Cell leukemia</e>, multiple myeloma, and prostate cancer.Using the 650-kb DNA sequence from the minimally deleted region in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (BCLL), we have identified a new gene, FAM10A4, that maps to the proximal end of the region. This gene has been shown to be part of a now six-member family of genes with high homology to the ST13 tumor suppressor gene. We have established conditions to specifically undertake mutation studies of the chromosome 13 member of this family and have identified a Ser71Leu change in BCLL samples, which is apparently a polymorphism. The characterization of this gene will permit mutation studies in other tumor cell types such as multiple myeloma and prostate cancer, which also show genetic loss in the 13q14 region.",M1
11869933,"Genomic instability at the human CD5 gene promoter.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The gene coding for the human CD5 lymphocyte surface receptor maps to the 11q12.2 region, which is in the vicinity of a region commonly affected by multiple somatic mutations in human cancers. The 5'-flanking region of the human CD5 gene includes an evolutionarily conserved (TC)n(CA)n microsatellite (MS) of potential utility as a marker for genome instability. The aim of the present study was to investigate the value of the CD5 MS as a marker for instability in different tumor types, particularly in <e>B-cell leukemia</e> and lymphoma. DESIGN AND METHODS: The CD5 MS and a panel of 10 MS markers were analyzed by using a polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based method and polyacrylamide sequencing gels. This was done in several hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines, as well as in 28 cases of B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), 19 mantle cell lymphomas (MCL) and 45 head and neck carcinomas (HNC). RESULTS: The frequency of CD5 MS abnormalities found among HNC was similar to that reported for other well known MS markers at loci near known and suspected cancer genes. However, instability at the CD5 MS was the most frequent MS abnormality among B-CLL and MCL. INTERPRETATION AND CONCLUSIONS: The inclusion of MS markers at chromosome 11q may be especially informative for genome instability analyses of certain B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.",M1
11705877,"Resistance to 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine of the human <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cell line EHEB.The effects of 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA, cladribine), an adenosine deaminase-resistant analogue toxic for both proliferating and resting lymphoid cells, were investigated in the human leukemia cell line EHEB, which was derived from a patient with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia. These cells were found to be less sensitive to CdA than B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia lymphocytes (approximately 25-fold) and other human lymphoblastic cell lines (10-1000-fold). Phosphorylation of CdA by deoxycytidine kinase and intracellular accumulation of 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine triphosphate (CdATP) were similar in EHEB cells and in other CdA-sensitive cell lines. In contrast, the inhibitory effect of CdA on ribonucleotide reductase activity, which was investigated in situ by the conversion of cytidine into deoxyribonucleotides and its incorporation into DNA, was much less pronounced in EHEB cells than in other human lymphoblastic cells. Accordingly, concentrations of deoxynucleoside triphosphates did not decrease and even tended to rise. Unexpectedly, incorporation of thymidine and deoxycytidine into DNA was increased severalfold after a 24-h incubation with CdA. CdA also increased the activities of deoxycytidine kinase and thymidine kinase approximately 4-fold. Analysis of the cell cycle by flow cytometry showed that after 24 h, CdA provoked an increase in the proportion of cells in S phase, synthesizing DNA. We conclude that the EHEB cell line is resistant to the cytotoxic action of CdA not only because of a lack of inhibition of ribonucleotide reduction but also because CdA, in contrast with its known effects, provokes in this cell line an increase in the proportion of cells replicating their DNA. Unraveling of the mechanism of this effect may shed light on clinical resistance to CdA.",M1

He initially lacked circulating viral genomes in his sera and did not have a past history of liver dysfunction. In this patient, the immunosuppressive condition introduced by disease progression of leukemia induced reactivation of dormant HBV, and the withdrawal of chemotherapy resulted in fatal liver failure. Mutation-specific assay based on competitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing analyses revealed the predominant reactivation of an HBV strain with missence mutation (point mutation G-to-A at nucleotide 1896) in the precore regions, as well as point mutations in the core promoter regions. Therefore, it is important to note the risk of HBV reactivation, with resulting lethal hepatic failure, in anti-HBc-positive healthy individuals, even when they lack HBsAg. who receive immunomodulating therapy.",M1

Cell survival and cell death pathway were also investigated in these two cell lines by cell growth curves, flow cytometry, and electron microscopy after ALA hexylester-mediated photodynamic therapy. Both ALA and its hexylester could induce PpIX production in the two cell lines, but ALA hexylester was about 100 times more efficient than ALA. Reh cells appear to be more sensitive than HPB-ALL cells to ALA hexylester-mediated phototoxicity.

11115566,"Mutation analysis of hBUB1, human mitotic checkpoint gene in multiple carcinomas.hBUB1 is a human homolog of yeast mitotic check point gene that plays an important role in chromosome segregation. Recently mutations of hBUB1 were reported in colorectal cancer cell lines, indicating that inactivation of this gene could be directly involved in aneuploidy in human carcinoma cells. To obtain information of the magnitude of hBUB1 inactivation in multiple carcinomas, we examined mutations in 59 multiple carcinoma cell lines showing single base alteration, however, there was no mutation of hBUB1 with amino acid change in these carcinomas. There were four silent mutations at codon 93, codon 735, codon 430 and codon 98 in KYSE190, TE8 esophageal carcinoma cells, KATOIII gastric carcinoma cells and 697 <e>B cell leukemia</e> cells, respectively. Two candidates of mutation were identified in TE3 esophageal carcinoma cells and 697 B cell leukemia cell line at codon 9 and codon 285, respectively. This result suggests that the inactivation of hBUB1 may be very rare in human carcinomas, or restricted to certain cell lines of colorectal carcinomas.",M1
11092614,"Tumor-derived multiple chaperone enrichment by free-solution isoelectric focusing yields potent antitumor vaccines.We have utilized a free-solution/isoelectric focusing technique (FS-IEF) to obtain fractions rich in multiple chaperone proteins from clarified A20 tumor lysates.

This protection is at least equal to that provided by purified, tumor-derived heat-shock protein 70, which was the best chaperone immunogen in our hands against this aggressive murine leukemia model. Dosage escalation studies, however, revealed that increasing vaccine dosages actually abrogated the protective effects. The physical nature of the enriched chaperones indicates that they are associated in complexes, which may have implications for their function. FS-IEF is relatively simple, rapid, and efficient, thus making combined multi-chaperone therapy feasible.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 462 patients with disseminated disease, 49 (10.6%) had CNS disease at diagnosis (CNS+). CNS disease included meningeal disease or CNS parenchymal masses with or without cranial neuropathies (CSF+/Mass; CNPs) in 36 patients and isolated CNPs in 13. Of the CNS+ patients, 28 had M2 (5% to 25% blasts) or M3 (&gt; 25% blasts) bone marrow involvement. All patients received protocol-based systemic and intrathecal chemotherapy. Thirty-six patients also received CNS irradiation. RESULTS: Relapses occurred in 21 (43%) of 49 patients, predominantly in the CNS (71%) and bone marrow (52%). The 3-year event-free survival +/- SE for all patients with CNS+ disease was 45% +/- 7%. Patients with CSF+/Mass had a nominally higher treatment failure rate compared with patients with CNS- after adjusting for marrow status and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) diagnosis, with a relative failure rate (RFR) of 1.52 (95% confidence interval [CI], 0.88 to 2.6; P =.15). In comparison, the RFRs for patients with M2 or M3 marrow and for those with LDH levels greater than 500 IU/L after adjusting for CNS disease were 1.4 (95% CI, 0.96 to 2.0; P =.029) and 2.2 (95% CI, 1.5 to 3.0; P &lt;.001), respectively. The RFR for patients with isolated CNPs was 0.87 (95% CI, 0.36 to 2.1; P =.76). CONCLUSION: We conclude that, with the treatments used during the period covered by these studies, the presence of CSF+/Mass CNS disease at diagnosis was associated with a nominally worse outcome independent of initial bone marrow status and LDH level, but the effect was not statistically significant.",M1
10741715,"Immunoprotective activities of multiple chaperone proteins isolated from murine <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma.Although the use of tumor-derived heat shock/chaperone proteins (HSPs) as anticancer vaccines is gaining wider study and acceptance, there have thus far been no reports concerning chaperone antitumor activities against disseminated hematological malignancies. We have devised an efficient and effective method for purification of the chaperone proteins grp94/gp96, HSP90, HSP70, and calreticulin from harvested A20 murine leukemia/lymphoma tumor material. We have demonstrated that these purified proteins, when used as vaccines, can induce potent and specific immunity against a lethal tumor challenge. Individual chaperone proteins were differentially effective in their abilities to provide immune protection. The increase in survival generated by the most effective chaperone vaccine, HSP70, resulted from at least a 2-log reduction in tumor burden. Syngeneic granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor producing fibroblasts were injected at the site of vaccination in an attempt to augment the immune response. Surprisingly, localized granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor production inhibited the protective effects of chaperone vaccination. These studies provide evidence that chaperone proteins can be isolated from B-cell tumors and used effectively to immunize against disseminated lymphoid malignancies.",M1

The role of non-activated and rIL-2-activated CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in immunotherapy for leukemia.Graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects play a key role in the elimination of residual leukemia cells in the course of allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT). GVL effects can also be induced by donor lymphocyte infusion following alloBMT. We have investigated the role of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in the development of GVL in mice with B-cell leukemia/lymphoma (BCL1) following allogeneic cell therapy. Sublethally irradiated (C57BL/6 x BALB/c)F1 mice were intravenously inoculated with 10(5) BCL1 cells and given untreated or recombinant human Interleukin-2 (rIL-2)-activated C57BL/6 spleen cells. Effective elimination of clonogenic BCL1 cells was confirmed by adoptive transfer of spleen cells obtained from treated mice into secondary BALB/c recipients. GVL effects were maintained after inactivation of CD4+ cells with monoclonal anti-CD4 antibodies in the inoculum, while inactivation of CD8+ cells with monoclonal anti-CD8 antibodies resulted in complete loss of GVL effects induced both by resting and rIL-2-activated allogeneic spleen lymphocytes. These results indicate that Thy-1 cells play the major role in the induction of GVL effects, mediated by C57BL/6 effector T cells in this model. Since the number of natural killer (NK) cells also increased during in vitro culture with rIL-2, their contribution, especially that of CD8+ NK cells, in GVL effects mediated by rIL-2-activated CD8+ cells cannot be ruled out.",M1

Alloimmune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects induced by unmodified and in vitro rIL-2-activated bone marrow and lymphocytes from different lymphoid compartments.We have investigated the efficacy of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects induced by cells obtained from different syngeneic and allogeneic lymphoid compartments, by comparing the response to cell therapy with syngeneic (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 (H-2d/b) (F1) or allogeneic C57BL/6 (H-2b) (B6) lymphocytes in F1 recipients inoculated with B-cell leukemia (BCL1) of BALB/c (H-2d) origin. Eradication of BCL1 was confirmed in vivo by adoptive transfer of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from treated mice into syngeneic BALB/c recipients. Immunotherapy induced by allogeneic but not syngeneic spleen and lymph node lymphocytes was therapeutically more effective than thymocytes and bone marrow cells (BMC). Alloreactive cells could be further activated in vivo with recombinant human interleukin-2 (rIL-2). The GVL effect of allogeneic lymphocytes was cell-dose-dependent; a heavy leukemia load was more efficiently eradicated after three doses than after a single dose of allogeneic spleen cells (100% versus 23% disease-free survival rate of secondary adoptive recipients respectively). The GVL effect induced by allogeneic spleen cells was preserved after ex vivo exposure of cells to 250 cGy, but not 500 cGy or more. Interestingly, GVL was preserved following administration of ex vivo irradiated (500 cGy) spleen cells when rIL-2 was administered in vivo (p &lt; 0.05). Syngeneic effector cells did not induce GVL, regardless of in vitro and in vivo activation with rIL-2. Our data suggest that allogeneic but not syngeneic (in analogy to autologous) cell therapy may be an effective tool to control residual leukemia following high-dose chemo-radiotherapy. The feasibility of augmenting GVL by successive doses of activated allogeneic donor lymphocytes, partly inactivated in vitro by low-dose ionizing irradiation to prevent severe graft-versus-host disease (GVHD), may lead to safer therapeutic approaches that can be used to reduce the incidence of relapse while avoiding the risk of uncontrolled GVHD.",M1

We describe a new retroviral insertion site that is the most frequent genetic alteration in AKXD B-cell leukemias. Multiple genes flank the site of viral insertion, but the expression of just two, Hex and mEg5, is significantly upregulated. Hex is a divergent homeobox gene that is transiently expressed in many hematopoietic lineages, suggesting an involvement in cellular differentiation. mEg5 is a member of the bim-C subfamily of kinesin related proteins that are necessary for spindle formation and stabilization during mitosis. Our data provide the first genetic evidence for the activation of these genes in leukemia, and suggest that unscheduled expression of Hex and mEg5 contributes to the development of B-cell leukemia.

The ability to induce anti-BCL1 immunity and the effect of various cell-modifications on BCL1 tumorigenicity and immunogenicity was evaluated.

9457396,"Cytokine-mediated immunotherapy following autologous bone marrow transplantation in lymphoma and evidence of interleukin-2-induced immunomodulation in allogeneic transplants.PURPOSE: Relapse remains a major problem following treatment of hematologic malignancies and metastatic solid tumors with allogeneic and autologous bone marrow transplantation (alloBMT and autoBMT). Our goal was to introduce posttransplantation immunotherapy for eradication of tumor cells that escape high-dose chemoradiotherapy prior to transplantation. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Murine <e>B-cell leukemia</e> in BALB/c mice was used to develop a preclinical model to study the role of cytokine-mediated immunotherapy and allogeneic cell-mediated immunotherapy with donor lymphocytes in minimal residual disease (MRD). Based on these studies, a clinical trial was initiated to investigate the safety and efficacy of treating lymphoma patients with recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) at the stage of MRD following autoBMT. The clinical application of donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI) was also investigated for treatment and prevention of relapse following alloBMT. Patients in relapse following alloBMT who were resistant to DLI were treated with DLI plus rIL-2 in an attempt to activate the alloreactive potential of immunocompetent donor lymphocytes. RESULTS: High-dose rIL-2 was effective against MRD in BALB/c mice, and the combination of rIL-2 and IFN-alpha resulted in synergistic effects even at doses of rIL-2 that were ineffective when given alone. In this animal model, graft-versus-leukemia/lymphoma (GVL) effects were induced by DLI after alloBMT and could be potentiated by coadministration of rIL-2. In clinical studies, rIL-2 plus IFN-alpha significantly improved relapse rate and survival in lymphoma patients treated after autoBMT. Relapse following alloBMT was successfully treated with DLI, and a proportion of patients who failed to respond to DLI could be salvaged with a combination of DLI and low-dose rIL-2. CONCLUSIONS: Following autoBMT, GVL effects may be induced with a combination of rIL-2 and IFN-alpha, resulting in a reduced rate of relapse. The combination of both allogeneic donor lymphocytes and rIL-2 seemed synergistic. Because DLI plus rIL-2 was effective, even following failure of myeloablative conditioning, future strategies for treatment of leukemia should be based on T-cell-dependent immunotherapy rather than high-dose chemoradiotherapy.",M1

This synthetic flavone has been reported to exhibit antitumor activity in murine and human tumor cell lines in vitro and in vivo and is currently undergoing clinical phase I evaluation. In the present study, 1 Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-prolymphocytic cell line (JVM-2), 1 EBV-transformed B-CLL cell line (I83CLL), and 1 non-EBV transformed B-CLL cell line (WSU-CLL) were used as targets. Treatment of the cells with flavopiridol (100 nmol/L to 400 nmol/L) led to a marked dose- and time-dependent inhibition of cell growth and survival as determined using trypan blue exclusion. Morphologic analysis showed characteristic apoptotic changes such as chromatin condensation and fragmentation, membrane blebbing, and formation of apoptotic bodies. Furthermore, quantitative assessment of apoptosis-associated DNA strand breaks by in situ TdT labeling showed that a significant number of flavopiridol-treated cells underwent apoptosis. These cellular effects were associated with a significant decrease in bcl-2 expression as observed by Northern and Western blotting. The results showed that flavopiridol downregulates bcl-2 mRNA and bcl-2 protein expression within 24 hours. Genistein and quercetin, two flavonoids that do not inhibit CDKs, did not affect bcl-2 expression. These data suggest an additional mechanism of action of this new flavone which might be useful as an agent in the treatment of chronic lymphoid malignancies.",M1
9269780,"T helper 2-dominant antilymphoma immune response is associated with fatal outcome.The precise role of the endogenous immune system in modulating cancer development remains unclear. Tumor cells are generally thought to be nonimmunogenic because they are of 'self' origin. However, tumor-reactive lymphocytes can be isolated from patients with many types of cancer. It is unclear what role these lymphocytes play and why they fail to protect the host. Using a murine <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma (BCL1) model, we showed the development of a vigorous antitumor T-cell response in the tumor-susceptible host. Specific T-cell responses against BCL1 developed as early as day 4. However, the nature of this nonprotective response is different from the protective response produced in a major histocompatibility complex-matched tumor-resistant host. Susceptible hosts developed a T helper 2 (Th2)-dominant response, whereas resistant hosts developed a Th1-dominant response to BCL1. Cytolytic activity against BCL1 developed in both resistant and susceptible hosts, but in the susceptible host, this response was weaker and delayed compared with that in the resistant host. Thus, tumor susceptibility does not necessarily mean the absence of an antitumor immune response. Rather, the nature of the antitumor immune response is critical in determining clinical outcome.",M1

The absence of efficient B7 family (B7-1/CD80; B7-2/CD86) -mediated costimulation has been shown to be a major defect in tumor cells' capacity to function as antigen-presenting cells. We show here the generation of autologous anti-pre-B-cell leukemia-specific cytolytic T-cell lines from the marrows of 10 of 15 patients with pre-B-cell malignancies. T-cell costimulation via CD28 is an absolute requirement for the generation of these autologous cytolytic T cells (CTL). Although costimulation could be delivered by either bystander B7 transfectants or professional antigen-presenting cells (indirect costimulation), optimal priming and CTL expansion required that the costimulatory signal was expressed by the tumor cell (direct costimulation). These anti-pre-B-cell leukemia-specific CTL lysed both unstimulated and CD40-stimulated tumor cells from each patient studied but did not lyse either K562 or CD40-stimulated allogeneic B cells. Cytolysis was mediated by the induction of tumor cell apoptosis by CD8+ T cells via the perforin-granzyme pathway. Although we were able to generate anti-leukemia-specific CTL from the bone marrow, we were unable to generate such CTL from the peripheral blood of these patients. These studies show that antigen-specific CTL can be generated from the bone marrow of patients with pre-B-cell leukemias and these findings should facilitate the design of adoptive T-cell-mediated immunotherapy trials for the treatment of patients with B-cell precursor malignancies.",M1

To further characterize 14q32.33 translocations in these patients, we developed a new procedure using double-color FISH with PRAD1, BCL2, V(H) and Cgamma gene probes. Chromosome t(11;14) was detected in 1 patient with CLL/PL, 1 with PLL and 5 with MCL. Chromosome t(14;18) was detected in 2 patients with FL. In a PLL patient with t(11;14), the cosmid CPP29 containing the PRAD1 gene and its 5'-flanking region split and co-localized with both Cgamma and V(H) gene probes, thus spanning the breakpoint. In CLL and SBLL patients, donor chromosomes were other than chromosomes 2, 11, 18 and 19, suggesting the involvement of a novel oncogene(s) in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Interphase FISH rapidly detected 14q32.33 translocation, t(11;14) and t(14;18) in B-cell malignancies with low mitotic activity at the single-cell level, facilitating the correlation of the molecular features of these translocations with clinical characteristics.",M1
9261743,"The heterogeneous expression of CD80, CD86 and other adhesion molecules on leukemia and lymphoma cells and their induction by interferon.CD80 (B7/BB-1, B7-1) and CD86 (B70, B7-2) take an important role in the interaction between T lymphocytes and antigen presenting cells (APCs) as co-stimulatory molecules. We analyzed the manifestation of adhesion molecules, including CD80 and CD86, on some leukemia and lymphoma cells. Constitutive expression of CD80 and/or CD86 was frequently observed on <e>B cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma cells, while it is rare on myeloid leukemia cells. Interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) amplified the manifestation of MHC class I and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) did both class I and class II. We also showed CD80 could be induced by IFN-alpha on K562 cells, which were originally negative for CD80. Our data implies the immunotherapy via CD80 and CD86 for patients with hematological malignancies and the possibility to enhance it using interferons.",M1
9044845,"Development of a severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model consisting of highly disseminated human <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma, cure of the tumors by systemic administration of immunotoxin, and development/application of a clonotype-specific polymerase chain reaction-based assay.A new severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID) mouse model consisting of highly disseminated human B-cell leukemia/lymphoma was developed by i.v. inoculation of BALL-1a, an in vivo adapted malignant B-cell line. A 100% transplantability was achieved in nonpreconditioned SCID mice using various BALL-1a doses between 2.5 x 10(4) and 6 x 10(6) cells. Hind-leg paralysis preceded the death of the mice. Utility of the developed tumor model for the therapeutic studies was investigated by i.v. administration of an anti-B-cell monoclonal antibody SN7 (IgG1) and its conjugate with deglycosylated ricin A chain (dgRA). The therapy was initiated 2, 4, or 6 days after tumor inoculation using 4 x 24 microg of SN7-dgRA or 4 x 20 microg of SN7; the total dose (96 microg) of SN7-dgRA corresponded to 14% of the LD50 dose. SN7-dgRA showed a strong antitumor efficacy in all groups of treated mice. All of the day-2 group mice (n = 7) and six (66.7%) of the day-4 group mice (n = 9) survived healthily for as long as followed (240 days), whereas four (57.1%) of the day-6 group mice (n = 7) survived healthily for as long as followed (200 days). Unconjugated SN7 showed a significant antitumor efficacy but was less effective than SN7-dgRA. A PCR-based assay specific for the clonogenic BALL-1a tumor was developed and applied to determine tumors in various organs of BALL-1a-bearing SCID mice. The assay was highly sensitive in screening for trace quantities of residual tumors in various organs of SCID mice, and it could detect 1 malignant cell/2.5 x 10(5) tissue cells. The PCR-based assay was shown to be much more powerful than the conventional histological analysis in detecting residual tumors. Furthermore, we could estimate quantities of the detected tumors by the PCR-based assay. It is remarkable to find that all examined organs of some of the SN7-dgRA-treated mice were tumor-free as determined by the clonotype-specific PCR-based assay. The present results show the usefulness of the newly developed SCID mouse model, SN7-dgRA, and the clonotype-specific PCR-based molecular assay for the study of therapy of human B-cell leukemia/lymphoma.",M1
8892624,"NK 1+ CD4- CD8- alphabeta T cells in the peritoneal cavity: specific T cell receptor-mediated cytotoxicity and selective IFN-gamma production against <e>B cell leukemia</e> and myeloma cells.NK1+ double negative (DN) alphabeta T cells were present in the peritoneal exudate cells (PEC) of both normal and athymic B6 mice, accounting for as much as 25% of the total T cells, while their numbers were far less in the PEC of BALB/c and (BALB/c x B6)F1 mice. IL-2-dependent clones established from the DN alphabeta T cell population in the PEC of IL-2 receptor alpha-chain transgenic B6 mice exhibited potent cytotoxicity against a series of B cell lineage leukemias and myelomas, such as CD5+BCL1 and MOPC, without affecting NK-susceptible targets. The cytotoxicity of the clones against BCL1 and MOPC was specifically inhibited by anti-CD3, anti-alphabetaTCR, or anti-relevant Vbeta (Vbeta8) Ab, but not by control Abs, indicating that it was mediated by the specific alphabetaTCR/CD3. Other BALB/c-derived target cells expressing both MHC class I and class II were not affected, and neither Ab against them affected the cytotoxicity, strongly suggesting that the cytotoxicity of NK1+ DN alphabeta T cell clones was independent of the particular MHC Ags. The clones produced IFN-gamma, but little IL-2 or IL-4, in response to anti-CD3 stimulation, to the susceptible, but not resistant, targets, and to IL-12. The clones exhibited TCRalpha (Valpha8) distinct from an invariant TCRalpha (Valpha14) reported to dominate in thymic NK1+ alphabeta T cells. The presence of DN alphabeta T cells with similar functional features in the normal PEC was confirmed by the short term stimulation in vitro. The present results along with other recent reports strongly suggested that, like the mainstream alphabeta T cells, the NK1+ DN alphabeta T cell population consisted of functionally heterogeneous subsets.",M1
8954144,"Induction of graft versus leukemia effects by cell-mediated lymphokine-activated immunotherapy after syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in murine <e>B cell leukemia</e>.The feasibility of inducing graft versus leukemia (GVL) effects with allogeneic T cells in recipients of autologous bone marrow transplantation (BMT) was studied in a murine model (BCL 1) of human B cell leukemia/ lymphoma. Allogeneic cell therapy, induced by infusion with peripheral blood lymphocytes, a mixture of allogeneic spleen and lymph node cells and allogeneic activated cell therapy, induced by in vitro recombinant-interleukin-2(rIL-2)-activated allogeneic bone marrow cells in tumor-bearing mice, prevented disease development in adoptive BALB/c recipients. Concomitant in vivo activation of allogeneic lymphocytes with rIL-2 suppressed even more effectively the development of leukemia in secondary adoptive recipients of spleen cells obtained from treated mice. In contrast, in vivo administration of rIL-2 after syngeneic BMT, with or without equal numbers of syngeneic lymphocytes, led to disease development in secondary recipients. Our data suggest that effective cell therapy can be achieved after SBMT by allogeneic but not syngeneic lymphocytes and that anti-leukemic effects induced by allogeneic lymphocytes can be further enhanced by in vitro or in vivo activation of allogeneic effector cells with rIL-2. Therefore, cell therapy by allogeneic lymphocytes following autologous BMT could become an effective method for inducing GVL-like effects on minimal residual disease provided that graft versus host disease can be prevented or adequately controlled.",M1
8741612,"Establishment and characterization of a new canine <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cell line.A new cell line derived from a spontaneous canine leukemia was established and designated GL-1. The cells have been cultured in a floating fashion and passaged for over two years. They were round with rich cytoplasm containing many rough endoplasmic reticula and mitochondria. Peroxidase staining was negative. The nuclei of many cells were round, but segmented nuclei were seen frequently. The doubling time of the cells was 27.3 hr and they had 78 chromosomes. Surface marker analysis using monoclonal antibodies (MABs) and flowcytometry revealed that GL-1 possessed CD45 and surface IgG. However, the cells did not react with MABs detecting T-cell markers. These results indicate that GL-1 has a lymphocytic lineage and is derived from a B-cell leukemia.",M1
8733699,"Effect of deoxyspergualin on graft-versus-host disease and graft- versus-leukemia in mice.The effect of 15-deoxyspergualin (DSG) on bone marrow (BM) engraftment and graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) was studied in mice across both major (MHC) and minor (MiHC) histocompatibility barriers. (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mice were inoculated with C57BL/6 cells, CBA mice were given B10.BR cells and BALB/c mice were transplanted with B10.D2 cells. All recipient mice were irradiated lethally or sublethally prior to transplantation. DSG had no effect on engraftment of parental cells in F1 mice at both 2.5 mg/kg and 10 mg/kg given daily for 10 days after treatment. Survival of F1 recipients of C57BL/6 cells increased significantly with 2.5 mg/kg DSG (p &lt; 0.05). Across MiHC, 75% of DSG-treated CBA mice survived transplant for more than 150 days. No effect on GVHD was observed in the B10.D2 --&gt; BALB/c setting. DSG abolished graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects in F1 mice transplanted with both BM and spleen cells (20%) of C57BL/6 mice and additionally inoculated with <e>B cell leukemia</e> (BCL1). In summary, in the semi-allogeneic murine models presented here DSG prevented GVHD but at the same time suppressed GVL effects induced by the allograft. For clinical use, DSG might therefore be very useful for prevention of GVHD post-allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for non-malignant diseases or for leukemia.",M1

We have cloned the breakpoint region and chromosone derivatives of the t(3;11)(q27;q23.1) translocation, present in a B cell leukemia cell line (Karpas 231), which define a novel 11q23.1 breakpoint site. As a consequence of the translocation, LAZ3 regulatory regions upstream of non-coding exon 2 are replaced by those of BOB1/OBF1, a recently described B cell-specific coactivator of octamer-binding transcription factors. A detailed structural study of the BOB1/OBF1 genomic DNA and of a nearly full-length cDNA revealed particular features in the 3' untranslated region, such as an Alu motif and a polymorphic tetranucleotide microsatellite. Two mutations leading to two potential amino acid changes in the C-terminal region, were also detected in one allele of a lymphoma B cell line, Raji. Due to its cell-specific expression and role as a coactivating transcription factor, chromosomal translocation and/or point mutation of BOB1/OBF1 may contribute to B cell tumorigenesis.",M1
8906104,"Interleukin-3 (IL-3) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) can induce differentiation of chronic <e>B cell leukemia</e> expressing the alpha subunit of IL-3 and GM-CSF receptor.Interleukin-5 (IL-5), IL-3 and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) exhibit similar functions on eosinophils, and these common functions are believed to be mediated by the shared beta chain of receptors. IL-5 shows activity on the murine chronic B cell leukemia cell line BCL1-B20, inducing differentiation into IgM-secreting cells, but IL-3 and GM-CSF do not have such activity. To elucidate whether the lineage specificity of IL-5 is due to restricted expression of the IL-5 receptor alpha chain (IL-5R alpha), transfectants of BCL1-B20 were established that express IL-3 receptor alpha (BCL1-3R) or GM-CSF receptor alpha (BCL1-GMR). BCL1-3R and BCL1-GMR acquired responsiveness to IL-3 and GM-CSF, respectively, to an extent similar to IL-5 stimulation, resulting in IgM-secreting cells. Thus, the differentiation of BCL1-B20 into IgM-secreting cells can be equally supported by either IL-3 or GM-CSF, suggesting that intracellular signaling through IL-5R can be replaced by signaling from IL-3R and GM-CSFR. These results support the notion that the lineage specificity of IL-5 is mainly due to the restricted expression of IL-5R alpha. Regulation of IL-5R alpha, IL-3R alpha and GM-CSFR alpha expression in the developmental stage appears to be important for understanding the unique function of these cytokines on a particular cell type.",M1
8582705,"[Characterization of tolerogen-producing cells and lymphoid tissues where self-tolerance is induced--a study on allogeneic bone marrow chimeras established with spontaneous leukemia prone mice]SL/Kh strain of mice provides a spontaneous pre-<e>B cell leukemia</e> model and AKR/J mice provides a spontaneous thymoma model. Using these leukemia-prone mice, protective influence of bone marrow (BM) transplantation and tolerance induction to a host antigen, Mls-1a, after BM reconstitution were studied. When SL/Kh mice were reconstituted with BM cells from allogeneic C57BL/6 mice, these [B6--&gt;SL] chimeric mice survived longer than non-treated SL or [SL--&gt;SL] syngeneic chimeras. These findings are compatible to those obtained with [B6--&gt;AKR] chimeras. In [D2--&gt;SL] and [D2--&gt;AKR] chimeras, V beta 6+ T cells reactive to Mls-1a had been clonally eliminated 5 weeks after BM reconstitution. On the other hand, minor graft versus host reaction (GVHR) abrogated the clonal elimination of V beta 6+ T cells in both [D2--&gt;SL] and [D2--&gt;AKR] chimeras. This abrogation appeared to be attributable to early disappearance of Mls-1a producing host T cells in the GVHR chimeras. The cells responsible for the Mls-1a production were revealed to be mainly CD8+CD44+ T cells by in vitro mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR), although other T cell subsets also induced MLR under certain conditions. Administration of the CD8+CD44+ T cells from (AKR x BR)F1 mice induced clonal elimination of V beta 6+ T cells in the thymus and lymph nodes of [BR--&gt;BR] syngeneic chimeras. By contrast, CD8+CD44- T cells induced partial reduction of V beta 6+ T cells only in lymph nodes. CD4+ T cells of Mls-1a type showed no tolerogenicity in this in vivo study, although these CD4+ T cells as well as CD8+ T cells evoked potentially MLR against Mls-1a. The present findings indicate that host CD8+CD44+ T cells are a major source of Mls-1a production in [Mls-1b--&gt;Mls-1a] BM chimera system and suggest that CD44 expression on T cells is associated not only with high Mls-1a production but also with lymphoid tissues where the tolerogenic cells migrate.",M1
8563931,"Expression of vascular permeability factor (VPF/VEGF) messenger RNA by plasma cells: possible involvement in the development of edema in chronic inflammation.Edema occurs in some types of chronic inflammation such as nasal polyps, uterine cervical polyps and gastric hyperplastic polyps. However, the factors or cellular components involved in the development of edema in chronic inflammation remain to be clarified. Recently, the gene encoding vascular permeability factor (VPF) or vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and the genes encoding its receptors (kinase insert domain-containing receptor (KDR) and fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 [fit-1]) have been cloned. VPF/VEGF induces vascular hyperpermeability and vascular endothelial proliferation through KDR or fit-1 receptors. As there is a possibility that VPF/VEGF may play a role in the development of edema in chronic inflammation, we examined the messenger (m) RNA expression of VPF/VEGF and its receptors in nasal polyp tissues, which is an example of chronic inflammation with remarkable edema. Using northern blotting, all nasal polyp tissues examined expressed mRNA of VPF/VEGF and KDR. In situ hybridization revealed that VPF/VEGF mRNA-expressing cells were scattered in the edematous stroma of nasal polyps. In the adjacent sections, these cells showed the morphological features of plasma cells and expressed mRNA of immunoglobulin light chains. Human <e>B cell leukemia</e> and plasmacytoma cell lines expressed VPF/VEGF mRNA but human mast-cell leukemia and T cell leukemia cell lines did not. The alternatively spliced pattern of VPF/VEGF transcripts observed in nasal polyp tissues was consistent with that in plasmacytoma cell lines. Taken together, the VPF/VEGF mRNA-expressing cells in nasal polyps appeared to be plasma cells, suggesting that plasma cells may play an important role in the development of edema in chronic inflammation through the production of VPF/VEGF.",M1

F1 mice with BCL1 were irradiated and reconstituted with parental (C57BL/6) bone marrow cells (BMC) or a mixture of BMC and spleen cells and treated in vivo for 10 days with anti-IL-2 receptor antibody or anti-Asialo-GM1 antibody. Both treatments lessened the GVL effects induced by the allograft and resulted in development of leukemia relapse, as documented in vivo by adoptive transfer of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from treated mice into secondary syngeneic adoptive recipients. Our data indicate that IL-2 receptor-positive T cells and possibly IL-2-activated allogeneic NK cells play a key role in inducing GVL following allogeneic BMT.",M1
7656275,"Expression of the MAGE gene family in human lymphocytic leukemia.The MAGE gene family, encoding tumor-rejection antigens recognized by cytotoxic T lymphocytes, is frequently expressed in human solid cancers. However, its expression in leukemia has not been well studied. We have investigated MAGE gene expression at the mRNA level in human leukemia. The MAGE gene family was expressed in 17 of 34 (50%) examples of T cell leukemia (12/21 patients' peripheral blood mononuclear cells and 5/13 cell lines), in 7 of 16 (44%) cases of <e>B cell leukemia</e> (1/8 and 6/8 respectively), but in none of 23 myelomonocytic leukemia cases (0/16 and 0/7), as evaluated by the primers common to the MAGE-1, -3, -4 (-4a and/or -4b), and -6 genes and the semi-quantificative reverse transcription/polymerase chain reaction method. None of a panel of normal lymphoid cells expressed the MAGE gene family. As revealed by the primers specific for each of the MAGE genes, the MAGE-1, -2, -3, -4 or -6 gene was expressed in 8, 8, 6, 2, or 6 respectively out of 23 types of leukemia cell lines. Expression of the MAGE-1 protein in both the cell lines and patients' cells was confirmed by immunoblot analysis with the polyclonal antibody to recombinant MAGE-1 protein. Cellular MAGE-4 protein in the cell lines was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay with the polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to recombinant MAGE-4b protein. In summary, the MAGE gene family was found to be expressed in the substantial proportion of T cell leukemias, but in no case of myelomonocytic leukemia. Antigens coded by the MAGE gene family could be important molecules for understanding specific immunity against lymphocytic leukemia.",M1

7696916,"Morphological and immunophenotypical characterization of Japanese B-cell lymphocytic leukemia.We have analyzed the clinical and laboratory features of 42 patients with <e>B-cell leukemia</e>. Based on the FAB criteria, the cases were classified in 3 groups: I) typical CLL 15, II) atypical CLL 9 which included 6 cases with large cells, and III) B-cell lymphoma in leukemic phase 18. Cases diagnosed as typical CLL (group I) had similar features to those seen in CLL patients from Western countries. The morphology and markers in cases from group III corresponded to B-cell lymphoma in leukemic phase. On the other hand, group II included 3 cases classified as atypical CLL according to FAB criteria. 1 CLL/PL and 2 mixed CLL and 6 cases with rather distinct features, namely: 1) lymphocytosis (42 +/- 41 x 10(9)/l in average) with large mature-looking lymphocytes with abundant cytoplasm: 2) an immunological profile consistent with CLL but, in addition with the consistent expression of CD38; 3) absence of a monoclonal band in the serum and 4) a clinical course and prognosis similar to CLL. Our findings suggest the existence of a B-cell disorder in Japan very close to CLL but distinct from typical and atypical CLL as seen in Western countries. Further studies would clarify whether such an entity is exclusively confined to Japan having a distinct natural history.",M1
7889004,"Induction of graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) activity in murine leukemia models after IL-2 pretreatment of syngeneic and allogeneic bone marrow grafts.To investigate GVL effects, Balb/c mice (H-2d) received 5 x 10(5) A20 (<e>B cell leukemia</e>) or 1 x 10(6) WEHI-3 (myelomonocytic leukemia) cells. These cell lines lead to death after a median of 19 (WEHI-3) or 30 days (A20). A lethal dose of total body irradiation followed by syngeneic BMT resulted in significantly prolonged survival of leukemia-bearing animals. Transplantation of (C57 x Balb/c)F1 (H-2bxd) allogeneic, but GVH-non-reactive marrow grafts differentially influenced the relapse rates in the two leukemia models. Whereas allogeneic BMT reduced the relapse rates in A20-bearing mice, the leukemia-free survival was not improved in mice bearing the leukemia WEHI-3 compared with syngeneic BMT. Pre-treatment of allogeneic (C57 x Balb/c)F1 or syngeneic Balb/c marrow cells with 200 U/ml IL-2 for 24 h did not reduce relapse rates in animals inoculated with A20 leukemia cells compared with unmanipulated bone marrow. In contrast, IL-2 treatment of syngeneic or allogeneic GVH non-reactive donor marrow significantly decreased the relapse rate in mice inoculated with WEHI-3 leukemia cells. The NK cell-mediated lysis of cultured leukemia cells was determined in vitro using a conventional 56Cr-release assay. Our data revealed a strong correlation between the level of natural killer activity determined in vitro and GVL activity in vivo.",M1
8077666,"Effective graft-versus-leukemia effects independent of graft-versus-host disease after T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow transplantation in a murine model of <e>B cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma. Role of cell therapy and recombinant IL-2.After allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT) for leukemia, beneficial graft-vs-leukemia (GVL) effects are usually accompanied by potentially serious graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). Because T cell depletion is the only effective way to prevent GVHD it seems important to understand whether effective GVL can develop after BMT with T cell depletion in GVHD-free recipients. Well-established C57BL/6--&gt;BALB/c chimeras that were free of GVHD, reconstituted with T cell-depleted allogeneic bone marrow cells, and inoculated 3 mo after BMT with a high inoculation of murine B cell leukemia (BCL1) showed no evidence of disease, whereas all control mice developed leukemia and died within 58 days. Results from adoptive transfer experiments in secondary naive BALB/c recipients indicated that all BCL1 cells were eliminated in the chimeras within 14 days. Hence, complete resistance to BCL1 developed in the chimeras despite complete tolerance to host alloantigens. The GVL effects observed in tolerant chimeras were further amplified by administration of immunocompetent allogeneic C57BL/6 spleen cells, low dose rIL-2, or both for 5 days. Our data suggest that GVL effects can develop even after T cell depletion in the absence of clinically overt GVHD and that GVL can be further amplified by rIL-2, either with or without use of additional immunocompetent donor T cells. Our data may provide the basis for new approaches to induce effective GVL after allogeneic BMT with cell therapy and rIL-2 at the stage of minimal residual disease, while avoiding early GVHD induced by the BMT procedure.",M1
8018922,"Frequent p53 gene involvement in splenic <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphomas of possible marginal zone origin.A phenotypic and molecular evaluation was made of 15 patients with mature B-cell leukemia/lymphoma showing exclusive spleen and bone marrow involvement. According to French-American-British criteria, these cases could not be classified as classical B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia, hairy cell leukemia and its variant forms, splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes, or leukemic phase non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL; follicular or intermediate type). The immunophenotype pattern (high surface Ig and CD25 expression, and little or no reactivity with CD5, CD23, and CD11c) and cytomorphologic features of these neoplasms suggested an origin in the marginal zone of the spleen. Molecular analysis did not show any involvement of the dominantly acting oncogenes generally associated with lymphoid malignancies (c-myc, bcl-2, bcl-1, Ras), but mutations of the p53 tumor suppressor gene involving exons 5, 6, and 8 were found in 6 cases (6 of 15, 40%). In 4 cases, the p53 alterations consisted of a point mutation leading to amino acid substitution. In the remaining 2 cases, an insertion or deletion resulting in a frame-shift of the protein was observed. In all but 1 of the cases, the wild-type sequence at the mutation site was barely visible, implying the loss of the normal p53 allele in leukemic cells. All of the cases showed a clinical course compatible with that of low-grade NHL, regardless of the p53 loss/mutation. Overall, our data suggest the existence of a form of splenic B-cell leukemia/lymphoma of possible marginal zone origin in which p53 inactivation may play an important pathogenetic role.",M1
8167551,"Structure and function of VLA integrins: differential expression in <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma.The integrin family of adhesion receptors includes at least 11 different alpha subunits and 6 different beta subunits which are associated to form 14 different alpha beta heterodimers, divided into three subfamilies. In particular, beta 1 subfamily integrins (VLA 1-6 proteins) have been found to mediate cell adhesion to extracellular matrix (ECM) component such as fibronectin, collagen, laminin; however, VLA-4 has been found to exhibit both cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesion functions. The reactivity of VLAs is virtually ubiquitous and independent of line or tissue specificity. However, the expression of individual VLAs within single tissues can be modulated according to the type or functional status of the cell. One of the main reasons for interest in these molecules is that they may play a determining role in neoplastic transformation and diffusion; in particular, in lymphoproliferative syndromes, a lack of cell adhesiveness or an abnormal adhesion pattern in neoplastic lymphocytes may free these cells from regulation, thus contributing towards the development of leukemia and/or lymphoma. Studies of VLA expression in B-cell leukemia/lymphomas show a modulation of VLA3 and VLA4 reactivity. The most interesting element is the identification of a VLA3/VLA4 pattern associated with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) characterised by a reduced expression of VLA4 and the constant expression of VLA3. Although the value of VLA3 as an additional marker for the diagnosis of classical B-CLL is indisputable, the biological/functional significance of this reactivity remains to be confirmed.",M1
7505024,"Autoantigen inhibits apoptosis of a human <e>B cell leukemia</e> that produces pathogenic rheumatoid factor.We studied a variant CD5- B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cell population that produces pathologic IgM kappa rheumatoid factor autoantibodies. In contrast to common CD5+ B cell CLL, this variant leukemia cell population displays intraclonal diversity in its expressed Ig V genes, similar to that noted for follicular B cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas. Also, in contrast to common B cell CLL, these leukemia cells rapidly undergo cell death hours after being placed in tissue culture. We find that addition of Ag (aggregated human IgG) enhances significantly the survival of these cells in vitro. Leukemia cell survival also could be enhanced by exogenous IFN-gamma or anti-CD40 presented on Fc gamma RII (CDw32)-expressing L cells, but not by exogenous IL-4, IL-6, or monomeric human IgG. We find that Ag acts directly on the leukemia B cells to inhibit apoptosis. This effect could be mimicked by cross-linking the leukemia cells' surface IgM receptors with immobilized murine mAb specific for human Ig mu-chains, but not by immobilized mAb of irrelevant specificity. In contrast to most follicular NHL, this leukemia B cell population does not have evidence of bcl-2 gene rearrangement. Also, in contrast to non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and most B cell CLL, these cells do not express detectable amounts of bcl-2. Finally, although capable of inhibiting apoptosis, surface Ig receptor cross-linking does not induce expression of bcl-2 in these variant leukemia cells. We hypothesize that the lack of bcl-2 expression may render these leukemia cells particularly dependent upon the survival signal(s) derived from surface Ig receptor cross-linking. This state may represent an early stage in leukemia/lymphomagenesis, possibly accounting for the intraclonal diversity observed in the Ig V genes expressed by certain CD5- B cell leukemias and lymphomas.",M1
8231239,"Minimal residual disease in murine <e>B-cell leukemia</e> (BCL1) detected by PCR.Small proportions of leukemic cells escaping chemo-radiotherapy and/or dormant leukemic cells present in undetectable amounts in patients post therapy, i.e. minimal residual disease (MRD), are a source for relapse. The study of MRD and its treatment in a murine model for human B-cell leukemia/lymphoma, (BCL1), should lead to an improved understanding of the human disease. The standard assay for MRD in experimental mice is the adoptive transfer of spleen cells from experimental animals into naive secondary syngeneic recipients. We describe here the detection of MRD in BCL1-carrying BALB/c mice using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR). A BCL1 specific sequence from the rearranged VH-region was amplified yielding a 456 bp long fragment. PCR products hybridized to the cloned BCL1 sequence allowed the detection of a single BCL1 cell. This assay, therefore, reveals the presence of very small numbers of leukemic cells without sacrificing experimental animals.",M1
7692878,"Human T and B lymphocytes express a structurally conserved focal adhesion kinase, pp125FAK.Clustering of beta 1-integrins on adherent cells with antibodies or ligands results in increased tyrosine phosphorylation and activation of a novel focal adhesion tyrosine kinase, pp125FAK. The genes encoding pp125FAK have been cloned previously from both chicken and mouse cDNA libraries, and the deduced amino acid sequences are nearly identical (94%). Two synthetic peptides derived from sequences at the carboxyl terminus of chicken pp125FAK were conjugated to ovalbumin to generate rabbit heteroantisera. Human pp125FAK was immunodetected in both T and B lymphocytes with these antisera. A basal state of pp125FAK tyrosine phosphorylation was observed in T and B lymphocytes, and its expression level was in general augmented among human T- and <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma lines. Additionally, the full-length sequence of human T-cell pp125FAK (huT-FAK) was derived from a Jurkat T-cell cDNA library. huT-FAK is structurally identical with both mouse and chicken FAK, and shares 95% amino acid identity with chicken pp125FAK and has 97% homology with the mouse sequence. This high degree of evolutionary conservation between species suggests that pp125FAK is likely to have a crucial function in the cell. Expression of the full-length huT-FAK gene in COS cells showed an immunologically indistinct human pp125FAK protein compared with the endogenous primate pp125FAK. Taken together, the data indicate that this structurally conserved human T-cell pp125FAK likely functions in T- and B-cell lineages, and its altered expression in human lymphocyte tumor cell lines may contribute to their transformed phenotype.",M1

Optimal synergism between cyclophosphamide and total body irradiation for eradication of murine <e>B cell leukemia</e> (BCL1).The doses of chemotherapy and radiotherapy and the sequence-dependent influence of CY administration and total body irradiation (TBI) on the eradication of murine B cell leukemia (BCL1) were investigated. Tumor-bearing BALB/c mice were treated with either CY followed by TBI (CY/TBI) or in the reverse (TBI/CY) at different time intervals after injection of 10(6) BCL1 cells. The presence of residual tumor cells after cytoreduction was assessed in secondary BALB/c recipients by monitoring leukemia-free survival. The anti-leukemic effect of CY followed by TBI was significantly better than TBI followed by CY. The survival of secondary adoptive recipients inoculated with 10(5) spleen cells obtained from mice treated with CY/TBI was 54% (57 of 105) compared with 25% (25 of 98) of recipients inoculated with 10(5) spleen cells obtained from mice treated with TBI/CY (p = 0.0001).",M1

The concept behind the present experiments was to investigate whether it is possible to improve the outcome in leukemia following total body irradiation used as part of the conditioning prior to allogeneic bone marrow transplantation. We determined whether SOD protects leukemic cells from the effects of ionizing irradiation both in vitro and in vivo. Murine B cell leukemia (BCL1) cells, derived from tumor-bearing mice, were irradiated in vitro with or without SOD and injected into BALB/c mice. All mice receiving 10(4) unirradiated BLC1 cells developed leukemia and died within 19-39 days. In vitro exposure of BCL1 cells to 800 cGy or 1600 cGy abolished the potential to induce leukemia by inoculation with 10(4) or 10(6) BCL1 cells, respectively. Addition of SOD in vitro during irradiation increased the resistance of BCL1 cells to ionizing irradiation; all mice receiving 10(6) BCL1 cells previously exposed in vitro to 1200 cGy in the presence of SOD died of leukemia, whereas only 40% of mice receiving a similar inoculum of irradiated BCL1 cells died of leukemia. In contrast, when BCL1-bearing mice were irradiated with 600-800 cGy with or without intravenous injection of SOD (100 mg/kg) 30 minutes prior to irradiation, development of leukemia was unaffected.

8272154,"A novel cell growth-promoting factor identified in a <e>B cell leukemia</e> cell line, BALL-1.A novel leukemia cell growth-promoting activity has been identified in the culture supernatant from a human B cell leukemia cell line, BALL-1. The supernatant from unstimulated cultures of the BALL-1 cells significantly promoted the growth of 16 out of 24 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines of different lineages (T, B and non-lymphoid) in a minimal concentration of fetal bovine serum (FBS), and of 5 out of 12 cases of fresh leukemia cells in FBS-free medium. The growth-promoting activity in the BALL-1 supernatant has been further characterized using FPLC chromatography, molecular weight (MW) sieve filtration and dialysis. The MW of the factor was less than 10 kDa. The growth-promoting activity was heat and acid stable and resistant to trypsin treatment. The factor isolated from the BALL-1 supernatant was distinct from known polypeptide growth factors with MW below 10 kDa, such as epidermal growth factor, transforming growth factor alpha, insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I), IGF-II and insulin, as determined by specific antibodies and by cell growth-promoting tests. The factor in the BALL-1 supernatant did not promote the proliferation of normal human fresh peripheral blood lymphocytes or mouse fibroblast cell line, BALB/c3T3. In addition to the BALL-1 supernatant, a similar growth-promoting activity was found in the culture supernatants from 13 of 17 leukemia/lymphoma cell lines tested. The activity in these culture supernatants promoted the growth of leukemia/lymphoma cell lines in autocrine and/or paracrine fashions. These observations suggest that the low MW cell growth-promoting activity found in the BALL-1 culture supernatant is mediated by a novel factor which may well be responsible for the clonal expansion of particular leukemic clones.",M1
7678091,"Investigations on the role of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory agents on the treatment of murine <e>B cell leukemia</e> by recombinant human interleukin-2.Human recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) was used in an effort to find effective biological therapy against the murine B-cell leukemia (BCL1), a spontaneous, nonimmunogenic, highly lethal leukemia of Balb/c origin. High dose rIL-2 (10(5) Cetus units 3 times a day for 5 days) was proven to be curative for mice inoculated with up to 10(4) BCL1 cells. Considering the fact that mice which showed more clinical signs of rIL-2 related toxicity had higher leukemia-free survival, and in view of the fact that BCL1 is a totally nonimmunogenic tumor, we have investigated the possible role of nonspecific effects of inflammatory and anti-inflammatory agents in order to speculate on the possible therapeutic role of inflammation on the overall effect of rIL-2 in the treatment of BCL1. According to the results presented in this work, it appears that although mediators of inflammation may play some role against leukemia, their overall effect in comparison with high-dose rIL-2 is relatively insignificant.",M1

Unfractionated bone marrow and spleen cell mixtures (1:1), or high density fractions of these cells induced acute lethal graft-vs-host disease (GVHD). In contrast, low and middle density fractions of bone marrow and spleen cell mixtures reconstituted the irradiated hosts, and the majority survived for at least 100 days. The latter cells contained sufficient hemopoietic cells for reconstitution, but were deficient in inducing GVHD. Examination of the T cell subsets in the low density fractions showed a reduction of typical alpha beta TCR+ CD4+ or CD8+ cells and little change in the proportion of alpha beta TCR+ CD4- CD8- cells. BALB/c mice injected with the BCL1 <e>B cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma were lethally irradiated and transplanted with unfractionated BALB/c or C57BL/Ka bone marrow and spleen mixtures or low density fractions of C57BL/Ka mixtures. All control unirradiated BALB/c mice given the BCL1 tumor cells died by day 55. Almost all BALB/c mice given the BCL1 tumor cells, irradiation, and injected with a syngeneic marrow and spleen mixture died by day 95. All of the latter recipients tested showed evidence of tumor relapse. Almost all BALB/c mice given BCL1 cells, irradiation, and a C57BL/Ka unfractionated marrow and spleen mixture died by day 40. The survival of BALB/c mice given BCL1 cells, irradiation, and a low density fraction of the C57BL/Ka mixture was markedly prolonged as compared to those recipients given unfractionated allogeneic or syngeneic mixtures. None of the low density fraction recipients tested showed evidence of tumor relapse. Similar results were obtained with leukemic C57BL/Ka x BALB/c F1 hybrid mice.

In contrast to their strong reactivity with anti-human CD19 MoAb, BCL-1 cells show no reactivity with MoAb directed against human CD22, CD72, HLA-DR, IgD, or IgM. Western blot analysis of BCL-1 whole cell lysates with the anti-human CD19 MoAb J3-119 showed a single 69-Kd protein band, which was not detected by the negative control MoAb G19.4 (anti-CD3). In contrast to BCL-1 cells, normal BALB/c splenocytes or mouse splenocyte/myeloma hybridoma cell lines did not (1) express any transcripts that hybridized to the human CD19 cDNA probe, (2) react with B43/anti-CD19 MoAb, or (3) express the 69-Kd protein that reacts with the anti-human CD19 MoAb J3-119. Murine BCL-1 B-cell leukemia thus provides a unique model of disseminated B-lineage leukemia to evaluate the antileukemic efficacy of anti-CD19 immunotoxins. This model was subsequently used to evaluate the in vivo homing ability, pharmacokinetics, and antileukemic efficacy of B43 MoAb conjugated to the plant hemitoxin pokeweed antiviral protein (PAP). B43-PAP immunotoxin (1) showed strong and antigen-specific reactivity with BCL-1 cells, (2) promptly penetrated the spleens of leukemic mice, (3) rapidly reduced the BCL-1 leukemia burden of leukemic mice and, most importantly, (4) improved survival. Finally, B43-PAP immunotoxin was more effective against BCL-1 leukemia than 700 cGy (LD100/30) total body irradiation (TBI) followed by syngeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT).",M1

All mice receiving 10(4)-10(6) BCL1 cells developed marked splenomegaly by Day +21 and all adoptive recipients of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from these mice developed leukemia within 21-36 days. Treatment of mice which received 10(4) BCL1 cells by either three courses of low dose IL-2 or three increments of allogeneic spleen cells alone and certainly by a combination of both resulted in normalization of splenomegaly on Day +21, but only adoptive recipients of 10(5) spleen cells obtained from mice treated by both allogeneic spleen cells and IL-2 (10/10) or allogeneic spleen cells alone (8/10) were disease free (greater than 100 days).

1879974,"Survival of leukemic cells in a dormant state following cyclophosphamide-induced cure of strongly immunogenic mouse leukemia (DL811).The <e>B-cell leukemia</e> line, DL811, established in DDD mice, has been characterized by strong immunogenicity leading to occasional spontaneous cure with tumor dormancy. Cyclophosphamide (CY) is an available chemo-immunotherapeutic agent. The effects of CY on the cure and dormancy of DL811 leukemias were investigated. Simultaneous injection of DL811 cells and CY into athymic nude mice revealed that DL811 cells were sensitive to CY doses of 0.5 mg and more per mouse in a dose-related manner. A single dose of 1 mg CY on day 7 after DL811 cell inoculation was most curative of disseminated leukemias (cure rate: 50-80%) as compared with other single CY doses at different times. Cured mice were strongly immune to DL811 leukemias. This therapeutic modality had no curative effect in athymic nude mice. Relapses occurred occasionally in CY-cured mice and most relapsed tumors had the same surface phenotype as that of the DL811 leukemia. In comparison with DL811 leukemias, however, relapsed tumors were less sensitive to rejection by cured mice and less frequently cured by a single dose of 1 mg CY on day 7 of inoculation, implying that they changed in antigenicity and drug sensitivity. Whole-body irradiation of 400 rad gamma-rays to cured mice raised the incidence of relapses from 22.9 to 44.7% and that of deaths from relapses from 8.6 to 26.3%. Thus, leukemic cells may survive against host immune surveillance in a dormant state and relapse after changing their immunologic and chemotherapeutic natures.

1878588,"Use of recombinant human interleukin-2 in conjunction with syngeneic bone marrow transplantation in mice as a model for control of minimal residual disease in malignant hematologic disorders.Unlike allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (BMT), autologous BMT is not accompanied by immune-mediated graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) effects; hence, the relapse rate observed after autologous BMT in malignant hematologic disorders is higher than that observed after allogeneic BMT. Autologous BMT represents a much safer medical procedure available for many patients in need in situations where allogeneic BMT is not feasible or risky. The present experiments were designed to investigate whether it might be possible to combine the therapeutic benefits of autologous BMT with additional immunotherapy after BMT. The tumor model used for investigating GVL effects was the murine <e>B-cell leukemia</e> (BCL1), a spontaneous, nonimmunogenic, highly lethal leukemia of BALB/c origin. BALB/c mice inoculated with 10(3) BCL1 leukemia cells were treated on day-1 with cyclophosphamide 100 mg/kg and transplanted with normal syngeneic BM cells on day 0. High-dose recombinant interleukin-2 (rIL-2) (100,000 Cetus units x 3/day intraperitoneally x 5 consecutive days) was initiated on day +1, +7, or +21 after BMT. Kinetics of lymphocyte reconstitution after syngeneic BMT indicated a steep increase in the absolute number of peripheral blood lymphocytes on days 17 through 24. All experimental groups were observed for relapse. Mice receiving no rIL-2 therapy relapsed and died within 50 days after BMT, whereas mice receiving rIL-2 showed long-term disease-free survival. Optimal time for administration of rIL-2 was noted at 3 weeks post-BMT, with 90% of the mice surviving with no evidence of disease for more than 1 year. Similarly, when 10(4) BCL1 cells were given 1 day after syngeneic BMT to simulate minimal residual disease after syngeneic BMT, rIL-2 therapy administered at 14 days post-BMT seemed effective in prolonging disease-free survival in contrast to the same regimen given at 1 day after BMT.

Adoptive transfer of C.B-20 anti-BCL1 effector cells specific for the minor histocompatibility Ag H-40a protects irradiated C.B-20 but not BALB/c recipients. Because C.B-20 donor cells could potentially generate graft-vs-host disease (GVHD) in BALB/c recipients, we investigated the possibility that GVHD prevents the anti-tumor effect. GVHD was induced in (C.B-20 X B10.D2)F1 [H-2d, H-40b X H-2d,H-40b] recipients after injection of B10.D2-primed C.B-20 donor cells. GVHD was indicated by the histologic appearance of tissue sections from C.B-20----F1 livers, target organs of GVHD, which showed a marked mononuclear cell infiltrate around the portal tracts and central veins. In addition, splenic lymphocytes from these mice had altered CD4/CD8 ratios and were unable to respond to the polyclonal activators Con A and LPS. The mitogen unresponsiveness was at least partially due to the presence of a suppressor cell, because proliferation of normal spleen cells to Con A and LPS was suppressed upon addition of C.B-20----F1 spleen cells. Further immune dysfunction was evident by the inability of T cells from mice with GVHD to generate a CTL response to H-2 alloantigens. Addition of C.B-20----F1 spleen cells to F1 responder cells at the induction of culture did not prevent generation of CTL, indicating that a suppressor cell was not responsible for the lack of CTL activity. In this setting of GVHD, F1 recipients were able to reject BCL1 upon adoptive transfer of C.B-20 anti-BCL1 effector cells. These data indicate that GVHD-induced immune dysfunction does not inhibit the activity of antileukemia T cells.",M1

Graft vs leukemia (GVL) effects independent of graft vs host disease were investigated in allogeneic bone marrow chimeras tolerant of host and donor alloantigens. The role of Thy1.2, L3T4 and Lyt2 T lymphocytes as effector cells of GVL were investigated in (BALB/c x C57BL/6)F1 mice inoculated with murine B-cell leukemia and subsequently conditioned with total lymphoid irradiation and cyclophosphamide (200 mg/kg). Mice were reconstituted with C57BL/6 bone marrow cells depleted of well-defined T-cell subsets or enriched for stem cells by the soybean agglutination method. Detection of residual tumor cells, an indicator for efficacy of GVL, was carried out by adoptive transfer of peripheral blood or spleen cells obtained from treated chimeras into secondary naive BALB/c recipients at different time intervals following bone marrow transplantation. Treatment of the primary marrow inoculum with monoclonal anti-Thy1.2 or anti-Lyt2 abolished the GVL effects and all secondary BALB/c recipients developed leukemia within 60 days. On the other hand, the treatment with monoclonal anti-L3T4 did not influence the effect of GVL and all treated recipients remained without leukemia. The data suggest that T cells may mediate GVL effects in the absence of graft vs host disease and in circumstances where tolerance to conventional alloantigens is elicited. Effector cells of GVL across the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the murine B-cell leukemia tumor model system appear to be Thy1.2+ Lyt2+ L3T4-.

Molecular analysis showed that BCL2 was rearranged in the major breakpoint cluster region and had joined into the immunoglobulin heavy chain gene as in follicular lymphoma. Cloning and sequence analysis of the rearranged MYC gene revealed that MYC was truncated at the Pvu II site at the end of the first exon of MYC and had joined into the regulatory elements of a gene that we called BCL3 (B-cell leukemia/lymphoma 3). The BCL3 locus was mapped to chromosome 17 band q22. We found BCL3 transcribed as a message of 1.7 kilobases in many hematopoietic cell lines representing all hematopoietic lineages. In the patient's leukemia cells, the truncated MYC gene was highly expressed under the influence of BCL3 regulatory elements, leading to an aggressive B-cell leukemia that presumably had been derived from an indolent lymphoma carrying a rearranged BCL2 gene.",M1

No leukemia developed in any of the secondary recipients. Previous studies indicate that as few as 10, or possibly less, BCL1 cells are sufficient to cause lethal disease in BALB/c recipients. Our results suggest that MC540 may be an extremely potent tool for in vitro elimination of residual tumor cells while leaving uncommitted progenitor hemopoietic cells intact for hemopoietic reconstitution following lethal marrow ablation.",M1
2783473,"dATP-mediated inhibition of DNA ligase by 2'-deoxycoformycin in T and <e>B cell leukemia</e>.2'-Deoxycoformycin (dCF), a potent adenosine deaminase inhibitor, has been reported to display greater toxicity for T than for B lymphoblasts. Since this compound can block DNA replication and since this effect is mediated by the intracellular ATP/dATP balance, its possible effect on DNA ligase was investigated. dCF at relatively low concentrations (1 microM), in association with dATP (100 microM), is a strong inhibitor of DNA ligase in T blasts, whereas it has no significant effect in B blasts at this concentration. The AMP-ligase complex is the target of the observed inhibition because the combined presence of the inhibitor and dATP results in a more stable dAMP-ligase complex. Because of this observation and of the greater adenosine deaminase activity observed in T cells, the dATP mediated dCF inhibition of ligase might be the crucial replication target of T cell toxicity. These observations are discussed in terms of T immunodeficiencies including Graft Versus Host Disease and related syndromes.",M1
3263328,"Evaluation of four CD22 antibodies as ricin A chain-containing immunotoxins for the in vivo therapy of human <e>B-cell leukemias</e> and lymphomas.Ricin A chain-containing immunotoxins (IT-As) specific for the human B-cell antigen, CD22, were prepared from 4 monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) or their Fab' fragments: RFB4, HD6, UV22-I and UV22-2. The ITs were tested for their ability to kill cells from the Burkitt lymphoma line, Daudi, the pre-B-cell leukemia line, NALM-6, and the myeloma cell line, ARH-77. Daudi expresses high levels of CD22, whereas NALM-6 and ARH-77 express low levels of CD22. The IgG-RFB4-A was highly toxic to all 3 cell lines; it killed 50% of the Daudi cells at a concentration of 1.2 x 10(-12) M and 50% of NALM-6 and ARH-77 cells at concentrations of 1.5 to 2.1 x 10(-11) M. IgG-RFB4-A was 10-30 times more toxic to Daudi cells than were the IgG-As constructed from the other 3 CD22 MAbs and 10 times more toxic than ricin itself. IT-As constructed from the Fab' fragments of the 4 CD22 antibodies were 2 to 5 times less toxic to Daudi cells than their IgG-A counterparts. Fab'-RFB4-A was twice as toxic to Daudi cells as ricin, whereas the other Fab'-As were about 7 times less toxic than ricin. Scatchard analyses of the binding of the radio-iodinated antibodies to Daudi cells showed that the intact RFB4 antibody bound 3-10 times more strongly than the other antibodies, whereas the Fab'-RFB4 bound 1.2 to 3.5 times more strongly than the Fab' fragments prepared from the other antibodies. Thus, the potent cytotoxic activity of the RFB4-As appears to derive, in part, from their superior binding affinity. Prior studies have shown that UV22-I and HD6 cross-react with certain normal human tissues lacking cells of B-cell lineage, whereas UV22-2 and RFB4 are B-cell-specific. This fact, together with its superior potency as an IT-A, suggests that RFB4 is the antibody of choice for preparing Fab'-As or IgG-As for in vivo therapy of human B-cell leukemias and lymphomas.",M1
3186743,"Evolution of B-cell malignancy: pre-<e>B-cell leukemia</e> resulting from MYC activation in a B-cell neoplasm with a rearranged BCL2 gene.We have analyzed the molecular genetics of the breakpoints involved in the t(8;14) and t(14;18) translocations of an acute pre-B-cell leukemia from a patient with a history of follicular lymphoma. In this patient's leukemic cells, the breakpoint of the t(14;18) translocation occurred in the major breakpoint-cluster region of the BCL2 gene and became linked to the JH4 joining-region gene segment of the immunoglobulin heavy-chain locus on the 14q+ chromosome as previously observed in follicular lymphoma. An N region and heptamer and nonamer signal sequences indicated that this translocation occurred as a mistake in VH-DH-JH joining (where VH and DH are the variable and diversity segments). In the t(8;14) translocation, the breakpoint was located immediately 5' of the first exon of the MYC protooncogene, which was juxtaposed with the C gamma 2 constant gene segment of the second 14q+ chromosome. The finding of repeated sequences typical of switch regions suggested that this translocation occurred during heavy-chain isotype switching, resulting in progression to pre-B-cell leukemia with both the t(8;14) and the t(14;18) translocations. The terminal deoxynucleotidyltransferase-positive phenotype of the patient's leukemic cells further suggests that the pre-B-cell leukemia was derived from a pre-B cell carrying a t(14;18) translocation in the original follicular lymphoma. The polymerase chain reaction method was then used to identify cancer cells in the bone marrow of the patient.",M1
18779747,"A polyvalent cellular vaccine induces T-cell responses against specific self-antigens overexpressed in chronic lymphocytic <e>B-cell leukemia</e>.B cell-derived chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is an incurable disease that requires innovative therapeutic regimens. Experimental approaches of immunotherapy aiming at induction of systemic T-cell responses have been developed. Trioma cells provide a potent vaccine derived from malignant B cells that allows multiple antigens (Ags) from the parental tumor to be ingested by Ag-presenting cells. Like other strategies using modified whole tumor cells, this approach induces polyvalent responses. Using trioma cell-pulsed dendritic cells (DCs) for T-cell activation in vitro, we asked whether specific Ags overexpressed by CLL can be identified as target structures of such responses and what is the nature of these Ags. Expression levels of several genes in CLL samples were quantitated by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. T lymphocytes were polyvalently stimulated by trioma-pulsed DCs and specificities were tested by determining cytokine secretion in the presence of target cells transfected with RNA coding for those Ags that were found to be overexpressed. We demonstrate that DCs pulsed with the modified tumor cells efficiently activate T lymphocytes against CLL and that overexpressed Ags related to leukemogenesis, such as BCL-2, MDM2, and ETV5, serve as targets for those T cells. Immune escape by Ag loss or mutation is less likely to occur if immunity is directed against altered self-proteins that are involved in malignant transformation. Therefore, vaccines based on modified tumor cells such as triomas hold promise for immunotherapy of CLL and other malignancies. Polyvalent vaccines originally designed as individualized therapeutics may be more broadly applicable, at least in patients showing similar Ag patterns.",M2
18418406,"HLA-DP as specific target for cellular immunotherapy in HLA class II-expressing <e>B-cell leukemia</e>.Mismatching for human leukocyte antigen (HLA)-DPB1 in unrelated donor hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (URD-SCT) has been associated with a decreased risk of disease relapse, indicating that HLA-DP may represent a target for graft-versus-leukemia (GVL) reactivity in HLA class II-expressing hematological malignancies. To investigate whether HLA-DP-specific T cells could mediate GVL reactivity following HLA-DPB1-mismatched URD-SCT and donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), we analyzed the immune response in a patient with leukemic lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma responding to DLI without graft-versus-host disease. The emergence of leukemia-reactive CD4+ T cells during the clinical immune response was demonstrated by interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot(ELISPOT)analysis. Following clonal isolation of these leukemia-reactive CD4+ T cells, blocking studies, panel studies and retroviral transduction experiments of both mismatched HLA-DPB1 alleles identified HLA-DPB1(*)0201 and HLA-DPB1(*)0301 as the targets of this immune response. The HLA-DPB1-specific CD4+ T-cell clones were capable of recognizing and lysing several HLA-DP-expressing myeloid and lymphoid hematological malignant cells. Since HLA-DP expression is mainly restricted to hematopoietic cells, HLA-DP may be used as a specific target for immunotherapy following T-cell-depleted URD-SCT. Therefore, in patients with HLA class II-expressing hematological malignancies HLA-DP-mismatched SCT may be preferable over fully matched SCT allowing DLI to induce a GVL effect.",M2
18351539,"[Atypical ocular toxoplasmosis with concomitant ocular reactivation of varicella-zoster virus and cytomegalovirus in an immunocompromised host]BACKGROUND: Necrotising retinopathy in immunocompromised hosts is characterised by an unfavourable course often with unspecific clinical features.

HISTORY AND SIGNS: A case of an initially therapy-resistant, necrotizing retinopathy is presented in a 65-year-old immunocompromised male patient suffering from chronic <e>B-cell leukemia</e>. THERAPY AND OUTCOME: Despite demonstration of cytomegalovirus and Varicella-Zoster-Virus DNA by polymerase chain reaction in vitreous, aqueous humour samples and from retinal biopsy with specific antiviral therapy, a progression of retinal necrosis was noted. Finally Toxoplasma gondii DNA was detected and retinal necrosis resolved after specific treatment. However, visual acuity remains poor because of optic nerve atrophy. CONCLUSIONS: The polymerase chain reaction is an important diagnostic tool for differential diagnosis in immunocompromised patients suffering from necrotising retinopathy. If resistance to therapy is noted atypical ocular toxoplasmosis should be considered. The presented case report shows that even multiple infections are possible in the same host.",M2
18279608,"[Preparation of heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) and idiotypic determinant single-chain antibody (Id-ScFv) in a patient with B-cell chronic lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL) and antitumor effect of peptide complex Hsp70-Id]BACKGROUND &amp; OBJECTIVE: Idiotypic determinant (Id) of malignant B lymphocyte surface membrane immunoglobulin (SmIg) is not only a specific marker for chronic B-cell lymphatic leukemia (B-CLL) but also a specific antigen as an attractive target for active immunotherapy. However, as a small self antigen, it has poor immunogenicity. As an important molecule for antigen presentation, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp70) can efficiently strengthen the immunogenicity of antigen. In this study, we prepared Hsp70 and idiotypic determinant single-chain antibody (Id-ScFv) fragment against SmIg in patient with B-CLL and explored the in vitro antitumor effect of peptide complex Hsp70-Id and the possible immune mechanism. METHODS: Id-ScFv and human Hsp70 proteins were expressed in E.coli and identified by sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electropheresis (SDS-PAGE) and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), and purified by metal chelate chromatography and DEAE ion-exchange chromatography. The purified Hsp70 was combined with the prepared Id-ScFv to produce peptide complex Hsp70-Id in vitro. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from healthy human were stimulated with Id-ScFv, HSP70 and HSP70-Id, separately. The proliferation rate of PBMCs was determined by MTT assay; the changes of T lymphocyte subsets were assessed by flow cytometry (FCM)√ª the levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) in supernatant were detected by ELISA. Killing efficiency of activated PBMCs to chronic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cell line Daudi, chronic myelogenous leukemia cell line K562 and hepatoma carcinoma cell line HepG2 were tested by cell counting. RESULTS: Id-ScFv and Hsp70 were expressed successfully in E.coli. The proliferation rate of PBMCs and secreting levels of IL-12 and TNF-alpha of lymphocytes in Hsp70-Id group were significantly higher than those in Id-ScFv and HSP70 groups (P&lt;0.05), which were significantly higher than that in negative control group (P&lt;0.05). The proportion of CD8+ T cells was increased in Hsp70-Id, Id-ScFv and Hsp70 groups, and the most significant increase was observed in Hsp70-Id group. The activated PBMCs in both Hsp70-Id and Id-ScFv groups had stronger cytotoxic activities to Daudi cells than to K562 or HepG2 cells (P&lt;0.05), and the effect was significantly stronger in Hsp70-Id group than in Id-ScFv group (P&lt;0.001). CONCLUSION: Purified Hsp70 and Id-ScFv proteins in a B-CLL patient were prepared successfully. Hsp70-Id complex could significantly enhance specific antitumor effect of PBMCs in vitro through improving the proliferation of PBMCs, activating specific CD8+ T cells, and inducing secretion of Th1 type cytokines.",M2
17440052,"Targeting CD37-positive lymphoid malignancies with a novel engineered small modular immunopharmaceutical.CD37 is a lineage-specific B-cell antigen that to date has been neglected as an attractive therapeutic target. To exploit this, novel CD37-specific small modular immunopharmaceuticals (CD37-SMIP) that include variable regions linked to modified human IgG(1) hinge, CH(2), and CH(3) domains were designed. The lead CD37-SMIP molecule induces potent apoptosis in the presence of a cross-linker, and antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity against <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma cell lines and primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells superior to therapeutic antibodies used in these diseases. The CD37-SMIP-dependent ADCC function in vitro was mediated by natural killer (NK) cells but not naive or activated monocytes. Significant in vivo therapeutic efficacy was demonstrated in a SCID mouse xenograft leukemia/lymphoma model. Depletion of NK cells in this mouse model resulted in diminished efficacy further supported the in vivo importance of NK cells in SMIP therapy. These findings provide strong justification for CD37 as a therapeutic target and introduce small modular immunopharmaceuticals as a novel class of targeted therapies for B-cell malignancies.",M2
17251335,"Telomeric IGH losses detectable by fluorescence in situ hybridization in chronic lymphocytic leukemia reflect somatic VH recombination events.Routine interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis of chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) with LSI IGH/CCND1 assay, applied to differentiate CLL from leukemic mantle cell lymphoma, identified a subset of cases (42/174) with translocation-like IGH signal pattern. To unravel the underlying 14q32/IGH aberrations, 14 of these cases were subjected to cytogenetic, detailed FISH, and V(H) mutation analyses. FISH identified cryptic losses of various portions of the IGHV region in all 14 cases. Fine mapping of these V(H) deletions revealed a strict correlation between their distal border and localization of the used VH gene, suggesting that they are not oncogenic but reflect physiological events accompanying somatic V-D-J assembly. This hypothesis was further supported by FISH analysis of 20 CLL and hairy cell leukemia cases with the known V(H) usage showing a constant loss of sequences proximal to the used gene, identification of V(H) deletions in normal B cells, and their exclusive demonstration in B cell malignancies, but not of T cell and myeloid linage. Given that these cryptic physiological VH losses in B cells may seriously complicate analysis of <e>B cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma and lead to false conclusions, FISH users should take them into consideration when interpreting IGH aberrations in these malignancies.",M2
17213020,"Bulky lymphadenopathy with poor clinical outcome is associated with ATM downregulation in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients irrespective of 11q23 deletion.B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is the most common <e>B-cell leukemia</e> among older populations in Western countries. The clinical course of B-CLL is heterogeneous: in some patients the disease course is indolent, in others it is aggressive. The B-CLL subgroups with chromosome 11q23 deletion have been associated with aggressive disease course involving ATM deletion, extensive bulky lymphadenopathy (BLA), and inferior clinical outcome. Using real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction, we found that ATM was consistently underexpressed in B-CLL patients with BLA, irrespective of 11q23 deletion status. In addition, B-CLL patients who presented with BLA had a significantly shorter time to treatment (2 months) than did patients without BLA (74 months). Moreover, gene expression analysis in B-CLL patients with and without BLA revealed differences in expression for genes involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, and cell adhesion. These results indicate an association between BLA and reduced expression of ATM, suggesting a role for ATM in disease progression in B-CLL.",M2
17200714,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia requires BCL2 to sequester prodeath BIM, explaining sensitivity to BCL2 antagonist ABT-737.Antiapoptotic <e>B cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma 2 (BCL2) family proteins are expressed in many cancers, but the circumstances under which these proteins are necessary for tumor maintenance are poorly understood. We exploited a novel functional assay that uses BCL2 homology domain 3 (BH3) peptides to predict dependence on antiapoptotic proteins, a strategy we call BH3 profiling. BH3 profiling accurately predicts sensitivity to BCL2 antagonist ABT-737 in primary chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells. BH3 profiling also accurately distinguishes myeloid cell leukemia sequence 1 (MCL1) from BCL2 dependence in myeloma cell lines. We show that the special sensitivity of CLL cells to BCL2 antagonism arises from the requirement that BCL2 tonically sequester proapoptotic BIM in CLL. ABT-737 displaced BIM from BCL2's BH3-binding pocket, allowing BIM to activate BAX, induce mitochondrial permeabilization, and rapidly commit the CLL cell to death. Our experiments demonstrate that BCL2 expression alone does not dictate sensitivity to ABT-737. Instead, BCL2 complexed to BIM is the critical target for ABT-737 in CLL. An important implication is that in cancer, BCL2 may not effectively buffer chemotherapy death signals if it is already sequestering proapoptotic BH3-only proteins. Indeed, activator BH3-only occupation of BCL2 may prime cancer cells for death, offering a potential explanation for the marked chemosensitivity of certain cancers that express abundant BCL2, such as CLL and follicular lymphoma.",M2
17137556,"Pharmacological inhibition of the MAPK/ERK pathway increases sensitivity to 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA) in the <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cell line EHEB.EHEB leukemic cells, which are derived from a patient suffering B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL), display intermediate sensitivity to the purine analogue 2-chloro-2'-deoxyadenosine (CdA). Because the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)/extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) pathway can rescue cancer cells from apoptotic signals, we investigated MAPK/ERK signaling in EHEB cells in response to CdA. We observed that CdA, at concentrations around its IC50, dose- and time-dependently increased the phosphorylation state of ERK 1/2 (p-ERK), indicating an activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway. This activation required CdA metabolism and de novo protein synthesis, and was independent on caspase activation. Interruption of ERK signaling, using the specific MEK inhibitors U-0126 and PD-98059, significantly enhanced CdA cytotoxicity, evaluated by the MTT assay. Drug interaction analysis showed synergism in the majority of combinations between CdA and MEK inhibitors tested. MEK inhibitors also dramatically increased apoptosis induced by CdA alone, evaluated by caspase-3 activation and poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage. Collectively, these observations show that ERK 1/2 activation elicited by CdA serves as a cytoprotective function and suggest that inhibitors of this pathway could be combined with CdA in the treatment of selected hematological malignancies.",M2

Two pairs of primers were designed, and variable region genes of light chain and heavy chain were amplified by PCR respectively from the pGEM-T vectors previously constructed in our laboratory which containing light chain gene or Fd fragment of heavy chain gene. The PCR product was digested, purified and inserted into pHEN2 vector to construct the soluble expression vector pHEN2-scFv. After the induction by IPTG, the scFv protein was identified by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis and purified by Ni-NTA-Chromatography. MTT was used to determine the effect of purified protein on the proliferation of stimulated PBMC in vitro. Plasmid PCR and restriction enzyme digestion of pHEN2-scFv revealed the pHEN2-scFv vector was constructed successfully. Id-scFv protein was expressed in positive clone after induced by IPTG. SDS-PAGE analysis showed that the relative molecular weight of fusion protein was about 30 kD (1 kD= 0.9921 ku), which was consistent with the theoretically predicted value. Proliferation of PBMC could be induced by purified Id-scFv. It was suggested that the expression vector of SmIg scFv fragment was constructed successfully, and scFv protein was expressed and secreted from E. coli, which could induce proliferation of PBMC. This may lay an experimental foundation for further research of Id-HSP complex vaccine for B-CLL.",M2
16157207,"Deletion 6q is not a characteristic marker of nodal lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma.Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma (LPL) is a small B-cell neoplasm with plasmacytic differentiation that does not fulfill the criteria for any other type of <e>B-cell leukemia</e> or lymphoma. In many cases, LPL is associated with Waldenstr√∂m macroglobulinemia (WM), although WM may also be associated with other types of lymphoma. Recent studies have demonstrated that del(6q) is the most common structural abnormality in patients with bone marrow-based LPL. It is unknown whether del(6q) might also be associated with nodal LPL. We, therefore, examined 10 well-characterized LPL involving lymph nodes or other extramedullary tissues for del(6q) using paraffin section interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Dual-color FISH was performed using a chromosome 6 centromere probe (CEP6) and a probe for 6q21 (RP11-91C23). The latter probe has previously been reported as deleted in up to 63% of cases of bone marrow-based LPL. In contrast, no nuclei containing a del(6q) pattern were identified in any case of extramedullary LPL examined in this study, and 89-98.5% of nuclei contained a normal signal pattern. These results indicate that del(6q) is at least uncommon in nodal LPL, and cannot be employed as a diagnostic marker to identify this type of lymphoma. Furthermore, these findings suggest that nodal LPL and bone marrow-based cases of LPL may be associated with different cytogenetic findings.",M2
15914559,"Inhibitors of XIAP sensitize CD40-activated chronic lymphocytic leukemia cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis.Patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) treated with adenovirus CD154 (Ad-CD154, CD40 ligand [CD40L]) gene therapy experienced rapid reductions in leukemia cell counts and lymph node size associated with the induced expression of Fas (CD95). However, CLL cells initially resist CD95-mediated apoptosis within the first 3 days after CD40 ligation in vitro. Thereafter, they become sensitive, which is associated with the CD40-induced expression of the proapoptotic protein <e>B-cell leukemia</e> 2 homology 3 (BH3) interacting domain death agonist (Bid). We hypothesized that the initial resistance to CD95-mediated apoptosis may be due to the high-level expression of X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP) by CLL cells. Consistent with this, CLL cells from patients 1 day after treatment with autologous Ad-CD154-transduced CLL cells became sensitive to CD95-mediated apoptosis following treatment with a novel XIAP inhibitor, 1540-14. Similarly, 1540-14 specifically enhanced CD95-mediated apoptosis of CLL cells following CD40 ligation in vitro. Immunoblot analyses demonstrated that treatment with 1540-14 allowed CD40-stimulated CLL cells to experience high-level activation of caspases-8 and -3 and cleavage of poly(adenosine diphosphate [ADP]-ribose) polymerase following CD95 ligation. This study demonstrates that distal apoptosis regulators contribute to the initial resistance of CD40-activated CLL cells to CD95-mediated apoptosis and suggests that XIAP inhibitors might enhance the effectiveness of immune-based treatment strategies that target CD40, such as CD154 gene therapy.",M2
15621776,"Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibition in chronic lymphocytic <e>B-cell leukemia</e>: a new therapeutic option.Chronic lymphocytic B-cell leukemia (B-CLL) is an incurable disease characterized by the accumulation of monoclonal mature B cells, although disease progression relies upon cycling B-CLL cells in proliferation centers in central lymph organs. Rapamycin and its analogs are immunosuppressant drugs that exert their activity by specific inhibition of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR). mTOR inhibition induces cell cycle arrest not only in normal lymphocytes but also in malignant cells. Therefore, rapamycins have recently entered the field of cancer treatment. In the present review we discuss how progression through the cell cycle is regulated in B-CLL cells and how rapamycin and its analogs can be used as target therapies against proliferating B-CLL cells. We also focus on additional effects of rapamycin, such as targeting the interaction between malignant B cells and the microenvironment.",M2
14996703,"VEGF receptor phosphorylation status and apoptosis is modulated by a green tea component, epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), in B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.We recently reported that chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) cells synthesize and release vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) under normoxic and hypoxic conditions. CLL B cells also express VEGF membrane receptors (VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2), suggesting that they use VEGF as a survival factor. To assess the mechanism of apoptosis resistance related to VEGF, we determined the impact of VEGF on CLL B cells, and we studied the impact of epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG), a known receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) inhibitor, on VEGF receptor status and viability of CLL B cells. VEGF165 significantly increased apoptotic resistance of CLL B cells, and immunoblotting revealed that VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 are spontaneously phosphorylated on CLL B cells. EGCG significantly increased apoptosis/cell death in 8 of 10 CLL samples measured by annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining. The increase in annexin V/PI staining was accompanied by caspase-3 activation and poly-adenosine diphosphate ribose polymerase (PARP) cleavage at low concentrations of EGCG (3 microg/mL). Moreover, EGCG suppressed the proteins <e>B-cell leukemia</e>/lymphoma-2 protein (Bcl-2), X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), and myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) in CLL B cells. Finally, EGCG (3-25 microg/mL) suppressed VEGF-R1 and VEGF-R2 phosphorylation, albeit incompletely. Thus, these results suggest that VEGF signaling regulates survival signals in CLL cells and that interruption of this autocrine pathway results in caspase activation and subsequent leukemic cell death.",M2

Whole blood lysis technique and multiparameter flow cytometry were applied to immunophenotype B cells gated on CD19/SSC dot-plot. The results showed that CD22, CD20, CD62L, CD40, CD24, CD79b, CD79a, and FMC-7 were almost positive in the circulating B cell population, whereas CD11a, CD80, CD103, CD10, CD40L, CD54, CD95L, CD86, and CD95 were almost negative in the peripheral blood B lymphocytes. CD18, CD44, CD23, CD5, CD11c and CD43 were positive in different B cell subpopulations. 78% of B cells were IgD positive and ratio kappa/lambda was 1.26. The significance of all these markers in the differential diagnosis of lymphoproliferative diseases was discussed. The conclusion is that it is necessary to consider the qualitative and quantitative levels of expression of various markers in normal B cell population in order to accurately interpret the pathological immunophenotypic data in clinical practice. It is also important to note the immunotypic differences of B cells between Chinese and Western populations.",M2

RXR rexinoids have demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphomas, but the mechanism of action is unclear. We explored the immunomodulatory effects of RAR and RXR rexinoids in human T- and <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cells and demonstrated that RXR rexinoids are capable of up-regulating high-affinity interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression.

Furthermore, rexinoid exposure enhanced susceptibility of the cells to denileukin diftitox fusion toxin-targeting and -intoxicating cells expressing high-affinity IL-2R. These results suggest a rationale for combining rexinoids with IL-2R-targeted therapies in lymphoid malignancies as well as possibly in autoimmune diseases.",M2
11737247,"Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is rare, but the proportion of T-CLL is high in Japan.Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is a rare disease in Japan. Recent advances in molecular biology, diagnostic criteria and classification of CLL have reinforced the concept of each category of CLL as a distinct entity. Since there have been no recent studies on the incidence and prevalence of CLL in Japan, the Kyushu Hematology Organization for Treatment (K-HOT) Study Group conducted two studies of CLL. One study is a prospective registration of newly diagnosed hematological disorders, which gave us some idea of the incidence of CLL in our region (Kyushu island) where adult T-cell leukemia is endemic. A total of 677 patients with hematological disorders were registered over a 6-month period and 11 patients were diagnosed as having CLL among 182 leukemia patients. This amounts to 6% of all leukemias, which is twice as frequent as previously reported in Japan. The other study is a retrospective analysis of CLL. Eleven institutions of the K-HOT Group analysed their diagnostic records of chronic lymphoid leukemia, and 145 patients with CLL were found over a period of 3-12 yr. After the data were reviewed 11 patients were excluded through having a different type of leukemia. The proportion of chronic B-cell lymphoid leukemia was 73% (98/134), while that of T-cell leukemia was 18% (24/134). The proportion of T-cell chronic leukemia was 5-6 times higher than that in Western countries. Two institutions had a complete database on hematological disorders. From this database, the annual incidence of CLL was estimated to be 0.48 per 100 000. Thus, the incidence of CLL in Japan is at least 4-5 times lower than that in Western countries, suggesting that chronic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> is really rare, but chronic leukemia of T-cell lineage develops in Japan as frequently as in Western societies. Further investigation is required to delineate why the incidence of B-CLL is so low in Japan.",M2
11196184,"Laminin isoforms 8 and 10 are primary components of the subendothelial basement membrane promoting interaction with neoplastic lymphocytes.To determine whether subendothelial laminins (LNs) could be implicated in the extravasation of neoplastic lymphocytes, we have examined the distribution of a number of LN isoforms in human vascular structures of adult individuals and have assayed the ability of the isolated LN molecules to promote adhesion of lymphoma and leukemic cells in vitro using a novel cell adhesion assay, CAFCA, Centrifugal Assay for Fluorescence-based Cell Adhesion (E. Giacomello et al., Biotechniques, 26: 758-762, 1999; P. Spessotto et al., Methods Mol. Biol., 139: 321-343, 2000). The use of previously characterized LN chain-specific antibodies showed that the vast majority of the smaller vascular compartments, known to correspond to sites of lymphocyte transmigration, expressed the subunits involved in the structuring of 9 of the 12 LN isoforms known to date. Eight LN isoforms (i.e., LN-1, -2, -4, -5, -8, -9, -10, and -11) and four naturally occurring LN complexes were isolated from various tissues and cultured cells by combined gel filtration, ion exchange, and immunoaffinity chromatographies, and the identity/composition of the isolated LNs/LN complexes was asserted by immunochemical means and amino-acid sequencing. Notwithstanding the widespread colocalization of LN isoforms, a panel of neoplastic B- and T-cell lines and lymphocytes isolated from patients affected by chronic lymphocytic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> attached preferentially and with high avidity to purified LN-8, purified LN-10, and LN-10-containing protein complexes, whereas lymphocytes derived from patients diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia failed to bind to these LNs. All of the tested neoplastic lymphocytes failed to adhere to the isolated LN-1, LN-4, LN-9, and LN-11 and attached moderately well to purified LN-2 and LN-5. The interaction of transformed lymphocytes with LNs was cation-dependent and interchangeably mediated by the alpha3beta1 and alpha6beta1 integrins. The degree of engagement of the two LN receptors was dependent upon their relative levels of cell surface expression, whereas, irrespective of the phenotype, lymphocytes deprived of either of these receptors were incapable of LN binding. The findings suggest that LN-8 and LN-10 may act in an independent or complementary fashion as primary components of the endothelial basement membrane favoring the interaction of extravasating neoplastic lymphocytes. Thus, our results would demonstrate that different LN isoforms may evoke diverse cellular responses in different cell types and that this divergence may be the basis for the redundancy of LN distribution in a number of vascular structures.",M2

METHODS: The variable region sequences of light and heavy chains (VL, VH) of anti-idiotypic McAb SM6 to B-CLL were analyzed by their cDNA cloning and sequencing. Total RNA was extracted from a hybridoma cell line producing SM6. The VH and VL genes were amplified by RT-PCR with specific primers. The PCR products were cloned into pGEM-T vectors, then transfected into JM109. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: It was confirmed by DNASIS7 sequence analysis that the full-length and potentially functional genes were successfully cloned. The VH gene expressed in SM6 belongs to Q52, the JH region using the JH3. The VL gene belongs to VK19, the JK region using JK2.",M2
11118669,"Changes in ceramide and sphingomyelin following fludarabine treatment of human chronic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cells.Fludarabine is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Both in vitro and in vivo studies have indicated that apoptosis is an important mode of fludarabine-induced cell death. However, the apoptotic pathways activated are not known. The effects of apoptotic doses of fludarabine on sphingomyelin, ceramide and the production of reactive oxygen species were investigated in the chronic B-cell leukemia lines WSU and JVM-2. Apoptosis, as assessed by an increase in phosphatidylserine externalization, internucleosomal DNA fragmentation and caspase-3-like activity, was evident by 18 h after fludarabine in both cell lines. The general caspase inhibitor t-butoxycarbonyl-Asp(OMe)-fluoromethyl ketone (OMe, methyl ester) significantly inhibited apoptosis supporting a role for caspases in fludarabine-induced cell death. A 2.5- to threefold elevation in ceramide levels was observed 6 h after fludarabine treatment. Concomitantly, a decrease in sphingomyelin levels was observed. Fumonisin B1 (an inhibitor of ceramide synthase) pretreatment significantly prevented fludarabine-induced ceramide generation and apoptosis. Conversely, C6-ceramide induced apoptosis in both cell lines. No effect of fludarabine on indices of oxidative stress (dichlorofluorescin oxidation and glutathione disulfide formation) were detected, although partial protection from apoptosis, and prevention of ceramide generation and caspase-3 activation, were achieved with N-acetylcysteine. These findings are consistent with the involvement of caspases and ceramide in fludarabine-induced apoptosis in WSU and JVM-2 cells. Oxidative stress does not appear to be induced by fludarabine, although the protective effects of N-acetylcysteine suggest that thiol redox balance may play a role in the apoptotic pathway.",M2
10740408,"[Expression of CD5 antigen in B and T cells from umbilical cord blood, from blood of healthy adults and patients with chronic lymphocytic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> (PBL-B)]Antigen CD5 is the glycoprotein which belong to the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich family. Mainly there is on the T cells subpopulation. During fetal life B CD5+ cells are major subpopulation of B cells in the spleen, lymph nodes and there are also in the cord blood. In adult CD5+ cells are minor subpopulation (27%) of B cells from the peripheral blood. CD5 there are on chronic lymphocyte leukaemia B cells (B-CLL) also. Usually expression CD5 on B-CLL cells associated with weak or lack expression of the surface immunoglobulins and CD79 beta, CD20, CD22, CD21 (CR-2), CD35 (CR-1) antigens. It appeared interesting to compare the expression of CD5 antigen (the mean fluorescence intensity--MFI of CD5) on B cells from the cord blood, adults peripheral blood and B-CLL patients. MFI of CD5 on B and T cells were also compared in each groups. MFI of CD 19 was studied too. Lymphocytes from the cord blood (11 assays), adult peripheral blood of healthy volunteers (18 assays) and the peripheral blood of no treated patients with B-CLL (56 assays) were studied. The immunological phenotype of lymphocytes was evaluated with the monoclonal antibodies anti-CD5 and anti-CD19 by the flow cytometry method. We have demonstrated that MFI of CD5 on B cells from patients with B-CLL was strongest and weakest from normal individuals. MFI of CD5 on T cells from patients with B-CLL is stronger in comparison to healthy volunteers. MFI of CD19 is weakest on cells from patients with B-CLL and strongest in normal individuals. On the basis of the our results and other medical papers we suggest on the one hand that biology of B-CLL depend on deficit antigens specific for B cells lines on the other hand depend on overexpression of CD5 antigens on leukaemic B and T cells also.",M2

The problem of resistance development of herpes simplex in a patient with chronic lymphatic <e>B-cell leukemia</e>]Herpes simplex viruses are known to be among the most common disease-causing microorganisms. Their prevalence can exceed 90% depending on the socioeconomic status of the population. Since the number of immunocompromised patients has increased because of the increased incidence in the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome and an increase in organ transplantation, herpes virus infection may have a greater clinical significance. While treatment of otherwise healthy individuals will not usually cause any clinical problems herpes infection in an immunocompromised patient can have severe consequences. Additionally, development of viral resistance can be observed that may require alternative drugs in treatment. We present a case history of a man with a B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia that was associated with a very unusual herpes simplex virus infection in the nasal vestibule. Possible causes for the development of resistance in herpes infections and the use of famciclovir and forscarnet as two therapeutic alternatives to aciclovir are discussed.",M2

Detailed analysis with probes spanning the Cmu -switch region and various restriction digests localised the rearrangements in two thirds of the patients to a 1300 bp region at the 5' end of the switch region while in the remaining patients the rearrangements occurred in the switch region. The consequences of these aberrant rearrangements remain to be determined, but their clustering to a defined region of the switch region suggests a  hot spot  that may be involved in the aetiology of the disease.",M2

Clinical features are caused in 93% of the cases by the accumulation and proliferation of immunologically incompetent, anergic, long lived, CD5 positive B-lymphocytes, expressing monoclonal IgM or IgD immunglobulin, in the bone marrow, the peripheral blood, the lymphoid and in other organs. In the etiology genetic basis is highly supposed, whereas affect of toxic agents and radiation exposure can be neglected. The prognosis of patients is variable and is determined by the clinical stage and the proliferative activity of the disease. Treatment is indicated in intermediate and high-risk clinical stages only with signs of disease activation on the basis of individual patient's risk. As first line treatment, Chlorambucil is indicated in high doses. Results achieved by combined chemotherapy are generally not superior compared to high-dose Chlorambucil treatment. For patients who developed resistance to alkilating agents purin analogues are recommended. Out of them the most favorable results had been accumulated with Fludarabine as second line treatment. For minority of the cases hemopoetic stem cell transplantation as the only curative therapeutic measure is being introduced in an increasing number.

9482524,"Impairments in immune cell function in B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia.B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) is a common clonal <e>B cell leukemia</e> that is often accompanied by a multitude of immune abnormalities. Each immune defect may be linked to several of the common complications affecting B-CLL patients. Furthermore, the combined abnormalities constitute a significant immunodeficiency for each patient. Importantly, some of the immune dysfunctions are potentially very relevant to the in vivo survival status of the leukemic B cell. The elucidation of these abnormalities in the circulating non-malignant immune cells of B-CLL patients has generated important insights into the biology of the disease. This discussion reviews the immune abnormalities of the clonal malignant B cells, the polyclonal B cells, and the immunoregulatory T cells and natural killer cells in B-CLL. In addition, we indicate the potential for immunotherapeutic protocols as innovations in treating this disease.",M2
9226155,"Comparative activity of melarsoprol and arsenic trioxide in chronic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> lines.Inorganic arsenic trioxide (As2O3) was recently shown to induce apoptosis in NB4 promyelocytic leukemic cells. We have investigated the effects of the organic arsenical, melarsoprol (a drug used for treatment of trypanosomiasis), upon induction of apoptosis in cell lines representative of chronic B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders. An Epstein-Barr virus (EBV)-transformed B-prolymphocytic cell line (JVM-2), an EBV-transformed B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) cell line (I83CLL), and one non-EBV-transformed B-CLL cell line (WSU-CLL) were used as targets. Dose-response experiments with melarsoprol (10(-7) to 10(-9) mol/L) were performed over 96 hours. Unexpectedly, we found that melarsoprol caused a dose- and time-dependent inhibition of survival and growth in all three cell lines. In contrast, As2O3 at similar concentrations had no effect on either viability or growth. After 24 hours, all three cell lines treated with melarsoprol (10(-7) mol/L) exhibited morphologic characteristics of apoptosis. We also observed prominent concentration-dependent downregulation of bcl-2 mRNA after 24 hours of exposure to melarsoprol in WSU-CLL, I83CLL, and JVM-2 cells. Decrease of bcl-2 protein expression was also observed in all three cell lines, whereas As2O3 had no effect on this parameter. We conclude that melarsoprol may inhibit the growth of lymphoid leukemic cell by promoting programmed cell death. Results of these studies suggest that melarsoprol shows promising therapeutic activity in these diseases, and a study to evaluate clinical effects of this drug has been initiated.",M2

Previously described deletions of 12p in acute lymphoblastic leukemias have been recently shown to harbor undetected translocations involving the TEL gene at 12p13. We document a case of an aggressive chronic B-cell leukemia whose cells had trisomy 12 and two unbalanced translocations involving 12p13, including a t(12;22)(p13;q11) as shown by conventional cytogenetics and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The 12p13 breakpoint of the t(12;22)(p13;q11) was telomeric to the TEL gene, and the second unbalanced translocation with breakpoint 12p13 resulted in the deletion of TEL.

Trisomy 12 and deletions or translocation of chromosome 13q14 are the most common abnormalities, but in neither case has the gene or genes involved in the abnormalities been identified. Combined FISH and immunophenotyping studies suggest that both abnormalities are secondary events in B-CLL. Other recurring chromosome abnormalities include 6q-, 11q- and 12p-, but the genes involved in these abnormalities have not been identified. Involvement of the BCL1, BCL2, and BCL3 genes has been reported, but the numbers are low and the cases tend to be atypical. Trisomy 12 in association with complex karyotypic abnormalities is associated with a poor prognosis, and FISH studies show a strong correlation between trisomy 12, atypical morphology, and advanced disease. Ten to 15% of patients have mutations of p53 which is associated with advanced disease, resistance to treatment, and poor survival.",M2

A comparative study on B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia and related lymphoma/leukemias.The expression of a series of adhesion receptors: L-selectins (CD62L): Leu-8, several integrins (LFA-1: CD11a/CD18, VLA-4: CD49d/CD29 and VLA-5: CD49e/CD29), ICAM-1(CD54) and the 'homing receptor' (CD44) were investigated by a dual color flow cytometry in 56 cases of B cell disorders namely, 39 chronic lymphocytic leukemias (CLL), four hairy cell leukemia (HCL), seven splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL) and six other non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). The functional activity of L-selectins was assessed with L-selectin ligand analogs (polyphosphomonester core polysaccharide: PPME and fucoidin). Leukemic B cells were identified with phycoerythrin-conjugated monoclonal antibodies (McAbs) anti-CD19, anti-kappa/lambda investigated simultaneously for the expression of adhesion receptors estimated with fluorescein-isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated McAbs. The percentage of leukemic cells expressing L-selectins (Leu-8) was high in CLL (52% of positive cases) and integrin expression (LFA-1, VLA-4, 5) was low (19 and 33%, respectively), while a reverse pattern, low Leu-8 (17%), and a high VLA-4 (77%), was observed in non-CLL cases. The expression of LFA-1 alpha-chain was variable in non-CLL cases, and the LFA-1 heterodimer was expressed on most clonal B cell in NHLs (92%). LFA-1 alpha-chain was detected on cells from only one HCL case, while beta2 integrin was regularly expressed on hairy cells. VLA-5 integrin was found on a relatively small number (26%) of mature <e>B cell leukemias</e>. A remarkable finding was the detection of ICAM-1 in all CLL cases albeit the number of positive cells was significantly lower (P &lt; 0.05) compared to non-CLL cases. CD44 was expressed on a high number of neoplastic cells in all the investigated categories. There was no correlation between the expression of the adhesion molecules and clinical and laboratory parameters except for CD18 which was expressed on a significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher number of leukemic cells in CLL with more advanced stages. This study demonstrates that even closely related B cell leukemia/lymphomas have a certain well defined and strictly variable adhesion profile which is characteristic of the disease entity and therefore, the adhesion profile may offer additional information useful for differential diagnosis and study of disease pathogenesis.",M2

In the present study, we used the murine <e>B cell leukemia</e> (BCL1) model system to examine the possible secretion of inhibitory factors from irradiated leukemic spleen cells. It was found that under culture conditions, irradiated spleen cells obtained from leukemic mice produce factors capable of suppressing BCL1 cell proliferation in vitro. The release of an inhibitory factor from nonirradiated cells was also observed, albeit to a lower extent. Supernatants collected from cultured nonirradiated and irradiated cells derived from animals at the first week after BCL1 cell inoculation did not affect the proliferation capacity of cells at any stage of the disease, whereas supernatants obtained at more advanced stages exhibited an inhibitory effect on the proliferation of cells derived from the same stages. The suppressive effect of supernatants of irradiated cells was more pronounced when those of 7 days' culture were used, compared to those of nonirradiated cells. The difference in suppression observed between supernatants of irradiated and nonirradiated BCL1 cells may be attributed either to the same factor produced in a larger amount following irradiation or to two (or more) factors--one produced spontaneously, the other induced by irradiation.",M2

Two years later the patient had indurated, red dermal nodules on the face that clinically and histologically were characteristic of cutaneous chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Immunophenotyping results from a facial nodule confirmed the presence of a B-cell infiltrate (CD20+). Immunophenotyping of a lesion on the right thigh showed that half the cells were composed of a CD2+, CD45RO+ (UCHL-1+) upper dermal and focally epidermotropic population of T cells consistent with mycosis fungoides; however, these T cells coexisted with an equal number of CD20+ B cells arranged in distinct clusters. DNA from the thigh lesion exhibited a B-cell immunoglobulin gene rearrangement, but the T-cell receptor gene rearrangements were germline.

7543264,"Cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.BACKGROUND: Bacillary angiomatosis is a recently described vascular disorder that is associated with infection by Bartonella henselae (formerly known as Rochalimaea henselae) and Bartonella quintana (formerly known as Rochalimaea quintana); this disorder usually occurs in patients with human immunodeficiency virus infection. We report a case of cutaneous bacillary angiomatosis that occurred in a patient with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. OBSERVATIONS: A 55-year-old man with chronic lymphocytic <e>B-cell leukemia</e>, Rai stage IV, presented with multiple angiomatous papules that clinically resembled pyogenic granulomas. Histopathologic examination revealed circumscribed lobules of small vessels with plump endothelial cells, numerous neutrophils, and abundant nuclear dust; these features were diagnostic for bacillary angiomatosis. The diagnosis was confirmed by the Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver nitrate stain that revealed argyrophilic bacteria and by ultrastructural demonstration of bacillary structures with trilaminar walls. Treatment with clarithromycin led to complete resolution of the lesions within 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This case emphasizes that (1) bacillary angiomatosis must be considered in the differential diagnosis of vascular lesions in immunocompromised patients without human immunodeficiency virus infection, (2) Grocott-Gomori methenamine-silver nitrate stain is a simple and satisfactory alternative to the Warthin-Starry stain for the demonstration of bacilli in this condition, and (3) clarithromycin is an effective oral antibiotic for the treatment of this disease.",M2

In FACS, cells from progressive leukaemia were found to over-express p53 with a conformation recognized by PAB240. In a PAb240-based ELISA, 60% of progressive B-CLL were positive. DNA sequencing of p53 exons 5 to 9 revealed a codon 179 His to Gln change in one of the ELISA-positive, progressive B-CLL but failed to reveal any mutations in 4 other ELISA-positive, progressive B-CLL. Among progressive B-CLL populations, 10/14 responded by proliferation in vitro to SAC/IL-2. In non-progressive cells, low levels of p53 were found by FACS, none was positive in the PAb240 ELISA and only one case showed a weak proliferative response to SAC/IL-2. Low p53 expression was also seen in different types of normal B cells, resting and activated, and in EBV-transformed B-cell lines, in contrast to the high expression observed in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines with verified p53 mutations.

CD5 was expressed on leukemic cells in 21 of 26 cases (CD5+) but not in 5 cases (CD5-). Myelomonocytic marker, CD13 antigen was expressed on the leukemic cells in all 5 CD5- cases but in none of CD5+ cases. Leukemic cells in CD5- cases also expressed CD11b antigen more frequently than those in CD5+ cases (80% v 11%; P &lt; .01). Another myeloid marker, CD33, was expressed neither on CD5+ nor CD5- leukemic cells. CD22, a restricted B-cell marker, was expressed more frequently on CD5- leukemic cells than on CD5+ leukemic cells (80% v 33%; P &lt; .05). Another restricted B-cell activation marker, CD23, was expressed at similar frequency in both the CD5+ and CD5- groups (67% v 60%). Although CD45RA was expressed on the majority of leukemic B cells, the CD45RA expression level was significantly higher among CD5- cases than CD5+ cases (P &lt; .01). In the analysis of VH gene expressed in chronic B-cell leukemias by polymerase chain reaction amplification, CD5+ cases preferentially used VH4 family members (48%; 10 of 21). CD5- cases, on the other hand, mainly used VH3 family (80%; 4 of 5). Thus, from our present observation of an albeit limited patient population, we have found an association between VH gene family use and CD5 antigen expression in chronic B-cell leukemias. We have also shown the differential expression of myelomonocytic markers in the CD5+ and CD5- chronic B-cell leukemias. These result are in agreement with previous suggestions that CD5 positivity is the hallmark for distinct clinical entity commonly referred to in the literature as chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",M2

Genomic DNAs from 49 patients with chronic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> and the related lymphomas were examined by Southern blot hybridization using 2 separate probes, named p alpha 1.4P and p alpha .5B, from the BCL3 gene locus. None of the 18 patients with leukemic manifestations of non-Hodgkin's lymphomas had detectable BCL3 rearrangements. Of 31 patients with CLL, 2 had the BCL3 rearrangements. A comigration study using the C alpha and C epsilon constant gene probe from IGH indicated that the t(14;19) translocation occurred in these 2 patients, and they were diagnosed with CLL/prolymphocytic (PL) according to the French-American-British (FAB) classification. Probes for the IGH locus revealed that leukemia cells of the 2 patients each were clonal, indicating that both small lymphocytes and prolymphocytoid cells found in the peripheral blood of one patient had the t(14;19), as well as a major population of the small lymphocytes in the peripheral blood of a second patient. It thus appears that tumor cells carrying the t(14;19) constitute a distinct disease entity in a group of chronic B-cell leukemia, that has a converting potential to more aggressive forms.",M2
8289505,"Does IL-2 receptor expression and secretion in chronic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> have a role in down-regulation of the immune system?Recent evidence of cell membrane expression of interleukin-2 receptors (IL-2R) by malignant B cells in hairy cell leukemia (HCL) and B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (B-CLL) has lead to speculation that growth factors, such as IL-2, may play a role in the pathophysiology of these diseases. However, to date, it is not clear that IL-2 is a consistent growth factor in vitro or in vivo for malignant B cells. What then is the potential significance of membrane IL-2R on the malignant B-cell membrane? Laboratory analysis indicates that the malignant cells are the source of elevated serum levels of soluble Tac protein (sIL-2r alpha) in both diseases. Indeed, these cells spontaneously secrete sIL-2R alpha into culture medium. We speculate that the presence of an expanding mass of malignant B cells possessing high and low affinity membrane IL-2R may contribute significantly to the associated immunodeficiency seen in B-CLL. In particular, it is the cell associated high affinity IL-2R that have the greatest potential for reducing the levels of free IL-2 available to normal immune cells.",M2

Coculture with stromal cells, irrespective of the kind of lymphoid disease affecting the lymph node, induced a plasmacytoid cytology in HN cells, an increase of cIg gamma, and decreases of sIg gamma, CD5, CD21, HC2, and B-ly7. In contrast, coculture with the stromal cells produced no marked effects on hairy cells from two HCL patients. Similarly, coculture with stromal cell supernatant or with various cytokines shown to be produced by bone marrow stromal cells produced no effects on HN cells.

However, blood counts showed lymphocytosis without neutropenia and monocytopenia, and the bone marrow biopsies demonstrated tightly aggregated nodules of lymphocytes. In addition, the lymphoid cells were dual positive for CD19 and CD5, displaying weak-to-moderately positive monoclonal surface immunoglobulin, findings strongly suggestive of CLL. One patient failed to respond to therapy with chlorambucil and prednisone. The second patient showed a partial response to treatment with 2-chlorodeoxyadenosine. We compare our patients with similar variants of differentiated B-cell leukemias reported in the literature, including disorders described as hairy cell variant (HCL-V) or splenic lymphoma with villous lymphocytes (SLVL).",M2
7693038,"Common clonal origin of chronic lymphocytic leukemia and high-grade lymphoma of Richter's syndrome.Patients with B-cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) infrequently may develop high-grade B-cell lymphoma, or Richter's syndrome lymphoma (RS lymphoma). Such lymphomas differ from the original leukemia in both histology and clinical behavior. Studies seeking to define the clonal relationship between the cells of the two malignancies in any one patient have yielded conflicting reports. We examined the clonal relationship between the early and late neoplastic cells of a patient who underwent Richter's transformation. In contrast to the original leukemia cells, the secondary high-grade lymphoma was CD5-. However, both the leukemia cells and the evolved RS lymphoma expressed surface IgM lambda reactive with Lc1, a murine monoclonal antibody specific for a supratypic cross-reactive idiotype encoded by a subset of human Ig variable region genes of the VH4 subgroup. Nucleic acid sequence analyses of the heavy and light chain variable region genes expressed by both leukemia and lymphoma cells show that the CD5- B-cell lymphoma constitutes a clonal expansion of mutant cells derived from the original CD5+ <e>B-cell leukemia</e>. Moreover, certain sets of somatic mutations distinguish the Ig variable region genes used by RS lymphoma from those expressed by the CLL B cells. This is the first study to establish the clonal relationship between CLL and RS lymphoma through primary structural analyses of the expressed Ig genes.",M2

We have cloned and sequenced the breakpoint in a patient with a t(14;19) and shown that the breakpoint on chromosome 14 occurred in the C mu switch region, and that the breakpoint on chromosome 19 occurred in the 5' untranslated region of the BCL3 gene. This is in contrast to all the other reported cases with a t(14;19) in which the breakpoints on chromosome 14 occurred in the C alpha 1 or C alpha 2 switch region, and the breakpoints on chromosome 19 occurred upstream of the BCL3 gene.

8319958,"Clonal heavy chain isotype switching within the proliferation centers of a small lymphocytic lymphoma: implications regarding the origin of proliferation centers.We describe an unusual case of small lymphocytic lymphoma with multiple prominent pseudofollicular proliferation centers in which immunohistochemistry reveals that the small cells are surface IgM kappa positive and the large pseudofollicular cells are surface IgA kappa positive. We further show by genomic DNA analysis that the tumor tissue contains two JH rearrangements, one Cmu rearrangement, one C alpha rearrangement, and a single C kappa rearrangement, strongly suggesting that the large cells within the proliferation centers have arisen from the small cells via a clonal heavy chain immunoglobulin isotype switch. Isotype switching in human lymphoma and leukemia appears to be an uncommon event. However, there are reports that strongly support isotype switching in pre-<e>B-cell leukemia</e>, Richter's syndrome, lymphoid blast crisis of chronic myelogenous leukemia, and multiple myeloma. To our knowledge, there have been no previous reports demonstrating isotype switching within the proliferation centers of small lymphocytic lymphoma.

8374521,"Induction of differentiation of <e>B-cell leukemia</e> cell lines JVM-2 and EHEB by bryostatin 1.The effects of bryostatin 1 (Bryo 1), a protein kinase C (PKC) activator, on proliferation, differentiation and macromolecular synthesis were investigated in the two cell lines EHEB and JVM-2, established from patients with chronic B-cell leukemia. Treatment with Bryo 1 inhibited the proliferation, DNA and RNA synthesis in a time- and dose-dependent fashion. The cells differentiated along the B-cell pathway to plasmacytoid cells as judged by morphological examination and increased their production and secretion of immunoglobulins. c-myc mRNA expression was induced in both cell lines. The phorbol ester TPA, a pharmacological PKC activator, had similar differentiation-inducing effects. The biomodulators failed to induce significant alterations in the cell surface marker profile. Except for their surface markers, all parameters studied were more strongly altered in JVM-2 than in EHEB cells. JVM-2 was established from a patient with B-prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), whereas EHEB originated from a case of B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). These data support the notion that PLL cells appear to be activated B-cells, in contrast to the rather quiescent CLL cells. Since Bryo 1 lacks tumor-promoting activity, this naturally occurring compound, extracted from marine animals, has a potential role in the therapy of B-cell neoplasms as a differentiating agent.",M2

The study was carried out in 13 patient. In those responding to treatment a tendency was observed for normalization of the immunological phenotype of peripheral blood lymphocytes (increased proportion of cells forming rosettes with sheep erythrocytes, reduced proportion of cells forming rosettes with murine erythrocytes), and a tendency for polyclonal pattern of B-cells with immunoglobulins on their surface (although this feature was not a rule). In non-responders these tendencies were much less pronounced or absent. Similarly, in non-responders the tendency for polyclonal B-cell pattern may be only apparent, and may be connected with proliferation of a new lymphocyte population with another type of light chain.",M2

2598162,"Cytogenetic and molecular changes in chronic <e>B-cell leukemia</e>.Cytogenetic studies using B-cell mitogens indicate that approximately 50% of patients with chronic B-cell leukemia (CLL) have chromosome abnormalities. The most common abnormality is an additional chromosome 12, either as the sole abnormality or in conjunction with other abnormalities such as 14q+, 6q-, and 11q-. In two instances, the 14q+ is a result of a translocation from either chromosome 11, t(11;14), or chromosome 19, t(14;19). These two translocations led to the identification of the bcl-1 and bcl-3 genes located on chromosomes 11 and 19, respectively. Very few instances of oncogene activation have been described and it does not seem to be an important mechanism in the pathogenesis of CLL. Further cytogenetic and molecular studies may provide clues for the identification of the genes involved in CLL.",M2

Co.), The patient showed pancytopenia with IgM-kappa type monoclonal protein in the serum. The bone marrow aspiration was failed due to a dry tap, but the biopsied specimen showed a marked infiltration of small sized lymphoid cells with wide cytoplasm. The leukemic cells from peripheral blood showed a morphology of atypical hairy cells, Surface markers of the leukemic cells were IgM, D(kappa)+, CD 19+, CD 20+, CD 21- and HLADR+, The leukemic cells showed no L-tartrate resistant acid phosphatase sensitivity. This case was diagnosed as a chronic B-cell leukemia closely related to a hairy cell leukemia. The treatment with estrogen-chlorambucil compound (Bestrabucil-KUREHA Chem, Co.) or splenic irradiation was not effective. However, after two months' administration of Alfarol the regular blood transfusion was not needed because of increment of the Hb concentration. After eight months of its administration, the bone marrow aspirate showed a marked decrease in the number of the leukemic cells and a restoration of normal hematopoietic cells. This experience suggested that Alfarol in usefull for the treatment of chronic B cell leukemia including hairy cell leukemia and chronic lymphocytic leukemia.",M2
2786598,"The effect of 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) on leukemic cells from chronic <e>B cell leukemia</e>.It is not clear whether cells from various chronic B cell leukemias including B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), CLL in prolymphocytoid transformation (CLL-PLT), B-prolymphocytic leukemia (PLL), and hairy cell leukemia (HCL) simply represent different stages of a single B cell differentiation pathway. Furthermore, it is not known whether cells from any given B cell leukemia are characterized by the same population during the differentiation process. Differentiation of various B cell leukemic cells was induced by 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), and the resulting changes in their morphology, cytoplasmic immunoglobulin (clg), and cytochemistry were evaluated. With respect to peculiar morphological change, i.e. extending long thin processes (spreading) and the appearance of clg, each sample showed different responses. According to these two indices samples were classified into three groups; spread+ clg- samples (one case of CLL-PLT, all HCL), spread+ clg+ samples (one of CLL, one of CLL-PLT), and spread- clg+ samples (a majority of CLL, one of CLL-PLT, and all PLL). Unexpectedly, both CLL and CLL-PLT consisted of heterogenous populations as to the reactivity to TPA. In the process of TPA-induced differentiation in CLL cells, features similar to those of HCL cells were not found. Since three different TPA-induced response patterns were observed in each chronic B cell leukemia type, it was not possible to sequentially assign each of these leukemias along a single B cell differentiation pathway. In order to explain this result, we introduced the hypothesis that these groups might be divided into different lineages in B cell differentiation. Since TPA-induced spreading cells were present in the B cell fraction of normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells, this morphological change should not be associated with malignant transformation.",M2
2500849,"Large granular lymphocytes from B-chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients inhibit normal B cell proliferation.Large granular lymphocytes (LGL) may exert regulatory influences on B cell immunoglobulin synthesis. We, therefore, investigated the influence of LGL from controls and B cell chronic lymphocytic leukemia patients (B-CLL) on control B cell proliferation to costimulation with the F(ab')2 fragment of goat antihuman mu and B cell growth factor (BCGF). Purified LGL (greater than 90% by morphology) from control and B-CLL peripheral blood were added in various concentrations to purified control B cells and incubated with anti-mu and BCGF for 3 days. [3H]-thymidine uptake of B cells was then measured. There was no proliferation of control or CLL LGL alone to the costimulatory signals of the F(ab')2 fragments of goat antihuman mu chain and BCGF. Addition of control LGL to equal numbers of control B cells did not blunt control B cell responsiveness to BCGF (with control LGL 8,649 +/- 298 cpm vs. control B cells alone 8,336 +/- 556 cpm, mean +/- SEM). When control LGL were increased to 10:1 LGL:B cell ratio, the maximal inhibition by control LGL of control B cell proliferative response to BCGF was 23%. In contrast, addition of CLL LGL at a 1:1 LGL:B cell ratio resulted in marked impairment of the control B cell proliferative response to BCGF (with CLL LGL 3,586 +/- 954 cpm vs. control B cells alone 8,649 +/- 298 cpm). Inhibition by CLL LGL occurred in a cell-concentration-dependent manner. No difference in CLL LGL's inhibitory effect on either resting or activated control B cell responsiveness to BCGF was noted. Inhibition of de novo protein synthesis (by cycloheximide inhibition) of CLL LGL did impair CLL LGL's inhibitory capacity for BCGF-induced B cell proliferation. A possible explanation for these findings includes the possibility that a subgroup of LGL with B cell suppressive activity may have expanded as a host response to the <e>B cell leukemia</e> or as part of the disordered cell regulation in B-CLL.",M2

The McAbs were subclasses belonging to IgM and of IgG mouse. Specificity and biologic characters of the monoclonal anti-Id antibodies from culture fluid or ascites were assayed by ELISA, indirect mixed ELISA sandwich, ELISA inhibition, immunofluorescence (IF) and IF inhibition. The study also proved that monoclonal anti-Id antibodies could react with homologous IgM, but not with Ig from normal donors or a panel of patients with myeloma. The results of IF and IF inhibition assay showed that monoclonal anti-Id antibodies were bound to lymphocytes of patient with B-CLL. Their reactivity was inhibited by homologous IgM, but not by lymphocytes of patients with ALL or lymphoma.

2459071,"Triggering of neoplastic B cells via surface IgM and the cell surface antigens CD20 and CDw40. Responses differ from normal blood B cells and are restricted to certain morphologic subsets.By raising monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) against B cells, a number of cell surface molecules have recently been identified which after binding by their specific antibody can trigger B cells, either alone or in co-operation with antibodies to surface immunoglobulin (sIg). The anti-CD20 (Bp35) MAb IF5 can deliver a strong activation signal to resting normal B cells, and the anti-CDw40 (Bp50) MAb G28-5 can promote activated G1 B cells to enter S phase. These antibodies were tested for their functional effects in vitro on suspended cells from 17 follicle-center-cell (FCC) lymphomas, 5 cases of chronic lymphatic <e>B-cell leukemia</e> (B-CLL) and 8 cases of various histological types. Changes in cellular volume, RNA and DNA synthesis were compared with the results obtained with a polyclonal anti-mu [F(ab')2] antiserum, a MAb to surface IgM (AF6), 12-O-tetradecanoyl-phorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and B-cell growth factor (low-molecular-weight BCGF). Our data reveal differences in the requirements for triggering of various B-cell subsets: cells from CLL responded strongly to TPA but not to anti-mu, which is a potent stimulator not only of normal B cells but also of cells from individual cases of FCC lymphomas. Our observations suggest that the differentiation stage of B-CLL cells is distinct from that of small resting B cells from peripheral blood. Centrocytic lymphomas could not be activated by any of the reagents. CD20-mediated triggering was seen in neoplastic B cells from only 4 of 30 cases, indicating that most B-cell neoplasias were not responsive to this activation pathway. In contrast, the anti-CDw40 MAb consistently stimulated DNA synthesis together with anti-mu or TPA in cells from FCC lymphomas, but not from CLL. Together, these results suggest that activation in different neoplastic B-cell subsets depends on distinct signal transduction mechanisms.",M2

Eight cases had three or more rearranged JH bands, indicating oligoclonality, clonal evolution, or chromosomal translocation. One case had a rearrangement of the bcl-1 locus and three of the bcl-2 locus. In the first case, comigration of the rearranged bcl-1 and JH sequences indicated a t(11;14)(q13;q32) translocation, which, in contrast to previously described cases, seems to be completely reciprocal. One case with a bcl-2 rearrangement showed comigration of the bcl-2 major breakpoint region and a rearranged JH band. This indicates a t(14;18) (q32;q21). The two other cases showed rearrangements of the bcl-2 5' breakpoint region without apparent comigration. No rearrangements were detected of c-myc and bcl-3, located at chromosome 19, nor was a deletion of Rb found. All but three cases had CD5 expression. The exceptions included the t(11;14) and the t(14;18) cases. Our results confirm recent data on rearrangements at the 5' site of bcl-2 in CLL. Additionally, they corroborate the presumption that CD5-negative chronic B-cell leukemias should be considered apart from classical CLL.",M2
