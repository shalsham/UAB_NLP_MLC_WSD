20524572,"Endoscopic management of airway venous malformations with Nd:YAG laser.Objectives: The neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser is a powerful tool in treating venous malformations (VMs) involving the upper airway. If left untreated, <e>laryngeal</e> VMs can lead to life-threatening airway obstruction. We aimed to evaluate the efficacy of endoscopic management of laryngeal VMs with the Nd:YAG laser. Methods: We performed a 12-year retrospective review in a tertiary referral center. Patient records were reviewed for demographics, presenting symptoms, area of involvement, age at first Nd:YAG laser therapy, total number of treatments, time between treatments, and treatment response. Results: Seventeen patients were treated endoscopically with an Nd:YAG laser for laryngeal VMs. The mean age at first treatment was 23.0 years (range, 18 to 45 years). The majority of patients presented with obstructive sleep apnea (58.8%), and 17.5% of patients presented with acute airway obstruction or stridor. The remaining patients presented with minor symptoms, including chronic cough and voice changes. The VMs involved the supraglottis, glottis, or both in 29%, 35%, and 35% of patients, respectively. An average of 4 treatments were required per patient (median, 3.5; range, 1 to 9). The time between treatments increased with each consecutive laser therapy, starting at a mean of 3.8 months between the first and second treatments to 21.7 months between the third and fourth. A marked reduction in VM size and symptom improvement were achieved in each patient after Nd:YAG therapy. Two complications (3%) were encountered among 66 total procedures. Conclusions: Endoscopic management of VMs using an Nd:YAG laser appears to be both effective and relatively safe. Multiple treatments are often required, but increased time can elapse between consecutive therapies. Use of the Nd:YAG laser for laryngeal VMs helps avoid tracheotomy and open surgical resection.",M1
20507244,"Early <e>laryngeal</e> injury and complications because of endotracheal intubation in acutely poisoned patients: a prospective observational study.OBJECTIVE: Tracheal intubation may represent a life-saving supportive measure in many acutely poisoned patients. Although considered as a safe procedure, intubation may rapidly damage laryngeal mucosa. The incidence and nature of short-duration intubation-associated laryngeal injuries are unknown in the population of poisoned patients. METHODS: We designed a prospective clinical investigation to study intubation-related laryngeal complications in poisonings. All consecutive intubated poisoned patients admitted over a 20-month period in our toxicological intensive care unit in a teaching hospital were included in this study. Daily clinical observation and laryngeal fiberscopic evaluation were performed to assess intubation-related laryngeal complications. RESULTS: We included 266 consecutive poisoned patients who had been intubated [116M/150F; age 41 years (31-53); median (25-75% percentiles); simplified acute physiology score II 43 (32-51); intubation time 24 h (13-52)]. Intubation was mainly performed at the scene (69%) and depended on the level of coma (89%). Complications included postextubation laryngeal dyspnea (9%) requiring mandatory reintubation (2%). Laryngoscopy was performed in 209 patients (79%) within 24 h after extubation. Eighty percent of patients presented significant initial laryngeal lesions. Stepwise logistic regression showed that two variables were predictive of injuries: female gender (odds ratio: 2.6; 95% confidence interval: 1.3-5.3) and intubation time &gt; or =72 h (odds ratio: 6.4; confidence interval: 1.5-27.6). Overall, injuries were independent of age, severity of illness, coma level, vital signs, intoxicants, and intubation modalities. The most severe injuries were significantly associated with intubation time (p &lt; 0.001) and simplified acute physiology score II (p = 0.04). Within 24 h following extubation, persistent dysphonia (p &lt; 0.0001), dysphagia (p &lt; 0.0001), or pharyngeal pain (p = 0.02) were predictive of laryngeal injury. CONCLUSIONS: Despite short-duration intubation, poisoned patients are at high risk of initial laryngeal injury.",M1
20493362,"A senescence accelerated mouse model to study aging in the larynx.OBJECTIVE: Age-related changes in the larynx lead to significant voice impairment and reduced quality of life. There is a need for aged animal models that have practical generation times to study the fundamental changes and new therapeutics for the aging voice. The senescence accelerated prone mouse strain (SAMP) animals experience rapid aging without any experimental manipulation. The main objective of this study was to demonstrate the use of senescence accelerated mice to study aging in the larynx. STUDY DESIGN: Murine model. SETTING: Department of Animal Resources, Emory University. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Larynges from five senescence accelerated prone mice, five normal aging senescence resistant mice, and five C57BL/6 mice were harvested and processed for paraffin sections. Histomorphometry was performed for assessment of collagen and hyaluronic acid distribution. In addition, frozen <e>laryngeal</e> tissue was harvested for transcriptional and translational assessment of collagen-1, using real-time polymerase chain reaction with specific primers and Western blots. Myofibroblast assessment was performed by immunostaining for the presence of alpha-smooth muscle actin. RESULTS: The deposition of collagen increased at six months of age in the SAMP vocal fold, and the level of collagen-1 mRNA increased with age. The myofibroblast protein alpha-smooth muscle actin was also found at a higher concentration in the SAMP vocal tissue. In contrast, the levels of hyaluronic acid in the vocal folds of SAMP mice decreased with age when compared to age-matched C57BL/6 mice. CONCLUSION: SAMP mice show accelerated, age-related changes in the vocal fold that were evident at as early as six months of age. The use of senescence accelerated mice offers promise as a model to study age-related laryngeal changes.",M1
20433023,"Diagnosis and management of type I posterior <e>laryngeal</e> clefts.OBJECTIVES: We review the diagnosis and management of type I posterior laryngeal clefts (PLCs). METHODS: We performed a retrospective study at a tertiary-care children's hospital of children who were diagnosed with a PLC between January 2003 and August 2008. We studied concurrent airway anomalies, comorbidities, presenting symptoms, age at the time of aspiration resolution, and rate of aspiration resolution. RESULTS: Sixty-seven children with PLCs were identified (41 boys and 26 girls). Fifty-nine had type I clefts, 6 had type II, and 2 had type III. Of the 59 type I cases, 15 (25.4%) were surgically repaired by endoscopy. Eleven of these 15 children (73.3%) have had symptomatic improvement since the surgery, and 7 of those 11 (63.6%) are tolerating thin liquids by mouth. Two of the 15 (13.3%) displayed no improvement with surgery, and 2 of the 15 (13.3%) were lost to follow-up. Forty-four of the 59 type I clefts (74.6%) were managed nonsurgically. Twenty of these 44 children (45.5%) did not present with aspiration. Twenty-four of the 44 (54.5%) presented with aspiration, and 16 of the 24 (66.7%) are now tolerating thin liquids by mouth. Seven of these 24 patients (29.2%) are still aspirating, and 1 has died. The average time to resolution of aspiration was 7.8 months for the surgical group and 13.6 months for the nonsurgical group (p = 0.19). In the surgical group, the average age at resolution of aspiration for patients who received their diagnosis at 0 to 6 months of age was 21.5 months; that for those with a diagnosis at 6 to 12 months was 27.3 months; and that for those with a diagnosis at older than 12 months was 27.3 months (p = 0.31). In the nonsurgical group, the average age at resolution of aspiration for patients who received their diagnosis at 0 to 12 months of age was 15.8 months; that for those with a diagnosis at 12 to 24 months was 27.3 months; and that for those with a diagnosis at older than 24 months was 77.3 months (p = 0.0015). CONCLUSIONS: We found that (1) the reported incidence of type I PLCs is increasing; (2) type I PLCs can often present without clinical aspiration; (3) aspiration caused by type I PLCs can be managed medically or surgically; and (4) operative intervention is advantageous for patients who have severe symptoms or who have persistent aspiration after 2 years of age.",M1
20422850,"[Endotracheal tube fire during <e>laryngeal</e> surgery: analysis of the root cause of a sentinel event]Endotracheal tube fire during laryngeal surgery is a rare complication but one that has serious consequences. Surgeons, anesthesiologists and others involved with this type of surgery should become familiar with how to manage this difficult situation, which should be considered a sentinel event requiring prompt analysis of the root cause and surrounding circumstances. Measures to improve management should be implemented and training provided in order to prevent the recurrence of a similar unfortunate event. We report a case in which a patient's airway caught fire during use of an electrocautery device. The patient died as a result of the lesions sustained. We report the results of the investigation and the protocols for prevention and response implemented in our surgical department, in the hope that the experience will be of interest to others working in similar settings.",M1
20422696,"Slow-release nanoparticle-encapsulated delivery system for <e>laryngeal</e> injection.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: There is a need for a slow-release system for local delivery of therapeutics to the larynx. Most therapeutic substances, such as steroids or chemotherapeutic agents that are injected into the larynx are cleared rapidly. Repeated laryngeal injection of these substances at short intervals is impractical. Injectable encapsulated poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) nanoparticles offer a potential slow-release delivery system for biologically active substances in the larynx. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled animal study. METHODS: PLGA nanoparticles were fabricated using a double emulsion method and were loaded with Texas Red-dextran (NPTR), hepatocyte growth factor (NPHGF), and bovine serum albumin (NPBSA). In vitro release of NPTR, NPBSA, and NPHGF was determined over approximately 2 weeks to assess potential duration of PLGA nanoparticle delivery. In vivo release of NPTR was assessed in a murine vocal fold injection model. The transcriptional effect of NPHGF on procollagen was measured in vitro to assess whether released growth factor retained functionality. RESULTS: In vitro release kinetics demonstrated slow release of NPTR, NPBSA, and NPHGF over 12 to 14 days. In vitro NPTR release correlated with in vivo results. In vivo presence of NPTR occurred up to 7 days compared to 1 day for Texas Red control. In addition, NPHGF ameliorated transforming growth factor-beta induced procollagen in vitro in 3T3 fibroblast cells. CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate the potential utility of nanoparticle encapsulation as an effective method for long-term delivery of specific drugs and biologically active substances to the larynx.",M1
20422689,"KAI1 COOH-terminal interacting tetraspanin (KITENIN) expression in early and advanced <e>laryngeal</e> cancer.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To investigate the expression of KAI1 COOH-terminal interacting tetraspanin (KITENIN) in patients with laryngeal cancers and to examine the correlation between its expression and various clinical and pathological variables. STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional study with planned data collection. METHODS: Tumor specimens were collected from 32 patients with laryngeal squamous carcinoma (collection of consecutive 32 tumor samples; 14 early stage, 18 advanced stage). Expression of KITENIN in the tissues obtained was determined by Western blot analysis and immunohistochemical staining. The patient characteristics including age, gender, tumor location, histology, stage, tumor extent, lymph node metastasis, and survival were obtained by review of the hospital records. RESULTS: KITENIN expression was significantly increased in laryngeal cancer tissues compared to adjacent normal tissue mucosa, as well as in metastatic lymph nodes compared to nonmetastatic lymph nodes. High KITENIN expression was significantly associated with advanced stage, tumor extent, and lymph node metastasis (P = .016, .016, and .005, respectively). There was no difference in the overall survival and disease-free survival between the low- and high-KITENIN expression groups among patients with laryngeal cancer. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that KITENIN expression may be associated with tumor progression in patients with laryngeal cancer. Further studies are needed to determine whether KITENIN expression adds prognostic value to conventional factors, such as the stage and status of metastasis, in a large series with a long period of follow-up.",M1
20403268,"[Tardive endolaryngeal oedema from blunt <e>laryngeal</e> trauma]INTRODUCTION: Mild to moderate blunt laryngeal injuries are frequent. Under the present management regimens patients are hospitalized for 24h observation due to the potential risk of developing endolaryngeal oedema. This group of patients is poorly described in the literature, and the aim of this study was to estimate the incidence of acute and especially tardive endolaryngeal oedema as well as the association between type of injury, symptoms and findings to improve existing evaluation criteria and treatment regimens. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 130 cases exposed to mild to moderate laryngeal injury was performed. The mechanism of injury, symptoms, findings and treatment were registered. RESULTS: Strangulation was the most common type of injury which was seen in 43% of cases, while stranglehold, fall and blow were observed in 29, 14 and 14%, respectively. Dysphagia was reported by 55%, while hoarseness was observed in 17% and stridor in 5%. Fibreoptically, 33% had endolaryngeal pathology. Twenty cases received treatment, 110 were observed. Immediate intubation was performed in 2.3% of the cases. In the observation-group, more patients were exposed to self-inflicted strangulation (p = 0.01). Fall and blow accidents were more frequent in the treatment than in the non-treatment group (p = 0.03). More patients in the treatment group had dyspnoea (p &lt; 0.001), stridor (p = 0.001), hoarseness (p = 0.007) and endolaryngeal pathology (p &lt; 0.001) than in the non-treatment group. CONCLUSIONS: In general, mild to moderate blunt external laryngeal injuries seem rather harmless and should need no further treatment. Nevertheless, any injury against the paediatric larynx and injuries related to fall-accidents or genuine hangings are associated with an increased risk of a respiratory threat. No patients in this study developed tardive laryngeal oedema.",M1
20370039,"Acoustic characteristics of phonation in  wet voice  conditions.A perceptible change in phonation characteristics after a swallow has long been considered evidence that food and/or drink material has entered the <e>laryngeal</e> vestibule and is on the surface of the vocal folds as they vibrate. The current paper investigates the acoustic characteristics of phonation when liquid material is present on the vocal folds, using ex vivo porcine larynges as a model. Consistent with instrumental examinations of swallowing disorders or dysphagia in humans, three liquids of different Varibar viscosity ( thin liquid,   nectar,  and  honey ) were studied at constant volume. The presence of materials on the folds during phonation was generally found to suppress the higher frequency harmonics and generate intermittent additional frequencies in the low and high end of the acoustic spectrum. Perturbation measures showed a higher percentage of jitter and shimmer when liquid material was present on the folds during phonation, but they were unable to differentiate statistically between the three fluid conditions. The finite correlation dimension and positive Lyapunov exponent measures indicated that the presence of materials on the vocal folds excited a chaotic system. Further, these measures were able to reliably differentiate between the baseline and different types of liquid on the vocal folds.",M1
20350072,"Developing a 3D model of the <e>laryngeal</e> cartilages using HRCT data and MIMICS's segmentation software.Discussions relating to the biomechanics of the larynx are still generally controversial. The purpose of this study is to develop a 3D model of the larynx based on high-resolution computer tomography (HRCT) data identifying and visualizing anatomical landmarks and structures of the larynx. We examined four fresh cadaver larynges with HRCT. The DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communication in Medicine) data were post-processed with the software package MIMICS for three-dimensional visualization. All relevant structures of the laryngeal cartilages could be identified on HRCT and visualized in a 3D model. We conclude that 1) HRCT provides excellent data for three-dimensional visualization of the laryngeal anatomy, and 2) the combined technology of HRCT and MIMICS is useful to study the biomechanics on 3D images and for preoperative planning of laryngeal framework surgery.",M1
20329855,"A high-speed laryngoscopic investigation of aryepiglottic trilling.Six aryepiglottic trills with varied <e>laryngeal</e> parameters were recorded using high-speed laryngoscopy to investigate the nature of the oscillatory behavior of the upper margin of the epilaryngeal tube. Image analysis techniques were applied to extract data about the patterns of aryepiglottic fold oscillation, with a focus on the oscillatory frequencies of the folds. The acoustic impact of aryepiglottic trilling is also considered, along with possible interactions between the aryepiglottic vibration and vocal fold vibration during the voiced trill. Overall, aryepiglottic trilling is deemed to be correctly labeled as a trill in phonetic terms, while also acting as a means to alter the quality of voicing to be auditorily harsh. In terms of its characterization, aryepiglottic vibration is considerably irregular, but it shows indications of contributing quasi-harmonic excitation of the vocal tract, particularly noticeable under conditions of glottal voicelessness. Aryepiglottic vibrations appear to be largely independent of glottal vibration in terms of oscillatory frequency but can be increased in frequency by increasing overall laryngeal constriction. There is evidence that aryepiglottic vibration induces an alternating vocal fold vibration pattern. It is concluded that aryepiglottic trilling, like ventricular phonation, should be regarded as a complex, if highly irregular, sound source.",M1
20308785,"Early deficits in cortical control of swallowing in Alzheimer's disease.The goal of this study was to determine whether functional changes in cortical control of swallowing are evident in early Alzheimer's disease (AD), before dysphagia (swallowing impairment) is evident. Cortical function was compared between an early AD group and a group of age-matched controls during swallowing. Swallowing oropharyngeal biomechanics examined from videofluoroscopic recordings were also obtained to more comprehensively characterize changes in swallowing associated with early AD. Our neuroimaging results show that the AD group had significantly lower Blood-Oxygen-Level-Dependent (BOLD) response in many cortical areas that are traditionally involved in normal swallowing (i.e., pre and postcentral gyri, Rolandic and frontal opercula). There were no regions where the AD group showed more brain activity than the healthy controls during swallowing, and only 13% of all active voxels were unique to the AD group, even at this early stage. This suggests that the AD group is not recruiting new regions, nor are they compensating within regions that are active during swallowing. In videofluoroscopic measures, the AD group had significantly reduced hyo-<e>laryngeal</e> elevation than the controls. Although, swallowing impairment is usually noted in the late stages of AD, changes in cortical control of swallowing may begin long before dysphagia becomes apparent.",M1
20304285,"High-speed digital imaging of the neoglottis after supracricoid laryngectomy with cricohyoidoepiglottopexy.OBJECTIVE: To determine the utility of high-speed digital imaging (HSDI) in evaluating vocal kinetics of the neoglottis after supracricoid laryngectomy with cricohyoidoepiglottopexy (SCL-CHEP). STUDY DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: The University of Tokyo Hospital. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: High-speed digital recordings of <e>laryngeal</e> images were obtained from six patients after SCL-CHEP to clarify the vocal kinetics of the postoperative neoglottis. Simultaneous recording of electroglottograms (EGGs) were obtained and multiline kymograms were generated on the basis of the recorded images. The distribution of frequency, amplitude, and phase in the neoglottis were visualized by using gradients of colors superimposed onto the glottal and supraglottal areas of laryngeal images to produce laryngeal topograms. Furthermore, waveforms of estimated laryngeal sound source (ELSS) were obtained on the basis of glottal inverse filtering of the vocal signal to reflect vibratory motions in the neoglottis. The vibratory part of the neoglottis was determined as a possible sound source when the frequencies of the ELSS, EGG, and laryngeal topograms, as well as the waveforms of ELSS, EGG, and kymograms, were consistent with each other. RESULTS: Spaces between the arytenoid(s) and epiglottis (5 patients) or pyriform sinus mucosa (1 patient) were estimated as the major source of sound during postoperative vocalization. The possible sound source could be determined by HSDI, even in the neoglottis, with more than one vibratory position. CONCLUSION: HSDI could be useful for evaluating the vocal kinetics of the neoglottis after SCL-CHEP.",M1
20298550,"Long-term results of intensity-modulated radiotherapy concomitant with chemotherapy for hypopharyngeal carcinoma aimed at <e>laryngeal</e> preservation.BACKGROUND: The objective of this retrospective study is to investigate laryngeal preservation and long-term treatment results in hypopharyngeal carcinoma treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) combined with chemotherapy. METHODS: Twenty-seven patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma (stage II-IV) were enrolled and underwent concurrent chemoradiotherapy. The chemotherapy regimens were monthly cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil for six patients and weekly cisplatin for 19 patients. All patients were treated with IMRT with simultaneous integrated boost technique. Acute and late toxicities were recorded based on CTCAE 3.0 (Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events). RESULTS: The median follow-up time for survivors was 53.0 months (range 36-82 months). The initial complete response rate was 85.2%, with a laryngeal preservation rate of 63.0%. The 5-year functional laryngeal, local-regional control, disease-free and overall survival rates were 59.7%, 63.3%, 51.0% and 34.8%, respectively. The most common greater than or equal to grade 3 acute and late effects were dysphagia (63.0%, 17 of 27 patients) and laryngeal stricture (18.5%, 5 of 27 patients), respectively. Patients belonging to the high risk group showed significantly higher risk of tracheostomy compared to the low risk group (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: After long-term follow-up, our results confirmed that patients with hypopharyngeal carcinoma treated with IMRT concurrent with platinum-based chemotherapy attain high functional laryngeal and local-regional control survival rates. However, the late effect of laryngeal stricture remains a problem, particularly for high risk group patients.",M1
20219844,"The preclinical toxicology of salmeterol hydroxynaphthoate.An extensive toxicology programme on salmeterol hydroxynaphthoate (Serevent), a marketed long-acting beta(2)-adrenoceptor agonist, has been carried out. The studies evaluated both the local (respiratory tract) and systemic tolerance to single and repeated dosing, effects on all stages of reproduction, as well as the genotoxic and oncogenic potential. High acute doses were well tolerated and caused no specific target organ toxicity. In repeat dose studies, animals tolerated salmeterol very well both locally and systemically. No significant effects on the respiratory tract of dogs were seen and only minor <e>laryngeal</e> changes, typical of those occurring with many inhaled medicines, were noted in rats. The high systemic concentrations achieved resulted in a number of changes that are considered to be the result of excessive and prolonged beta( 2)-adrenoceptor stimulation. These included tachycardia, skeletal muscle hypertrophy and minor haematological and blood biochemical changes in general toxicity studies, foetal effects in rabbit organogenesis studies and increased incidences of smooth muscle tumours of the mesovarium in the rat and of the uterus in the mouse oncogenicity studies. Salmeterol showed no evidence of any genotoxic potential. Results of the extensive toxicology programme provide good assurance of the safety for the inhaled use of salmeterol in patients; this has ben confirmed by many years of clinical experience during its development and marketing.",M1
20217338,"The generation of post-inspiratory activity in <e>laryngeal</e> motoneurons: a review.Breathing is a vegetative function that is altered during more complex behaviours such as exercise, vocalisation and respiratory protective reflexes. Recent years have seen recognition of the importance of respiratory pattern generation in addition to rhythm generation. Respiratory-modulated cranial motoneurons (laryngeal, pharyngeal, hypoglossal, facial) offer a unique insight into the control of respiration since: (1) they receive rhythmic respiratory inputs but; (2) their respiratory-modulated firing pattern differs to that of phrenic neurons to suit their function, (for example, hypoglossal motoneurons begin firing and thus the tongue depresses before the onset of phrenic nerve discharge and diaphragmatic during inspiration) and; (3) their activity is often altered in parallel with changes in respiration during stereotypical non-respiratory behaviours such as coughing, swallowing and sneeze. Here we review some mechanisms that modulate the respiratory-related activity of laryngeal motoneurons with an emphasis on the generation of post-inspiratory activity.",M1
20213655,"<e>Laryngeal</e> mucosa: its susceptibility to damage by acid and pepsin.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Exposure of pig laryngeal mucosa to pepsin and acid will have a differential damaging effect depending on the anatomical site, mirroring the effects seen in the human larynx in laryngopharyngeal reflux (LPR). This study aims to quantitate damage caused to laryngeal tissue by acid alone, and acid and pepsin, and also to determine if the extent of this damage depends on the tissue site. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective translational research study. METHODS: An excised porcine laryngeal damage model in a small Ussing chamber was used to measure the effect of pepsin and acid on five sites (ventricles, vocal folds, posterior commissure, supraglottic, and subglottic mucosa). The tissue samples were incubated on the lumenal side for 1 hour with pH 2 and 4 HCl, pH 2 plus 1 mg/mL pepsin, and pH 4 plus 1 mg/mL pepsin. Damage was assessed by changes in absorbance of the bathing solution at optical density (OD) 260 nm and OD 280 nm and by measurement of released DNA compared to tissues bathed in pH 7.4 buffer. Damage was also assessed histologically. RESULTS: Based on histology, all the tissues were resistant to pH 4.0 except the subglottic mucosa. Only the posterior commissure was not damaged by pH 2.0 plus pepsin. Similar patterns were observed with absorbance changes and DNA release. CONCLUSIONS: The subglottic mucosa was the most susceptible to damage and the posterior commissure the least. Laryngeal tissues are essentially resistant to damage at pH 4.0, but are damaged when pepsin is present. This suggests that in LPR, pH 4.0 or above refluxate would only be damaging if it contains pepsin.",M1
20211101,"Optical coherence tomography of the larynx using the Niris system.OBJECTIVES: To present our experience using the first commercially available optical coherence tomography (OCT) device for use in the head, neck, and upper aerodigestive tract and to determine the feasibility and efficacy of this system in comparison with our previous experience using other research OCT systems. METHODS: Using the Niris OCT imaging system (Imalux, Cleveland, OH), we obtained OCT images of benign and premalignant <e>laryngeal</e> disease in 33 patients undergoing surgical head and neck endoscopy. This imaging system has a spatial depth resolution of 10 to 20 mum and a depth scanning range of 2.2 mm, obtaining images of 200 x 200 pixels at a maximum frame rate of 0.7 Hz. The scanning mechanism of the device is located at the distal end of a flexible probe that is placed in contact or near-contact with the area of interest. The tip of the probe was inserted through a rigid laryngoscope, and still images were obtained. RESULTS: OCT images of arytenoids, aryepiglottic folds, piriform sinus, epiglottis, and true and false vocal cords were obtained. In patients whose OCT images were taken from normal tissue, the normal microstructures were clearly identified, as well as disruption of the latter in malignant pathologies. CONCLUSIONS: The device can easily be incorporated into the operating room and requires minimal set-up and staff to operate. OCT imaging with this device potentially offers an efficient, quick, and reliable imaging modality in guiding surgical biopsies, intraoperative decision making, and therapeutic options of various laryngeal pathologies and premalignant disease.",M1
20210957,"Induration of the cricoid cartilage complicates prosthetic laryngoplasty in a horse.OBJECTIVE: To report intraoperative complications during needle penetration and suture placement through the cricoid cartilage during a prosthetic laryngoplasty procedure. STUDY DESIGN: Case report. METHODS: An 11-year-old American Paint gelding with grade IV left <e>laryngeal</e> hemiplegia underwent a terminal prosthetic laryngoplasty for teaching purposes. Passage of the needle through the cricoid cartilage was difficult and resulted in needle breakage before eventual success using a new needle. The larynx was examined postmortem. RESULTS: Palpation of the larynx revealed hardening of the cricoid cartilage. Radiographic examination indicated the presence of diffuse radiopaque speckling. Histologic examination did not find accumulations of calcium salts, rather it revealed a loss of proteoglycans within the cricoid cartilage. CONCLUSIONS: Laryngeal mineralization occurs in the horse and human with advancing age. The loss of proteoglycan and subsequent stiffening of the cricoid cartilage likely resulted in the intraoperative complications noted in this report. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Radiographic examination of the larynx before performing a prosthetic laryngoplasty may reveal the presence of areas of increased radiodensity. The interpretation of this is to be made with caution as it may represent mineralization, or hardening due to the changes in proteoglycan concentration, monomer size or charge.",M1
20203545,"Effects of tracheal intubation on ventilation with LMA classic for percutaneous dilation tracheostomy.AIM: The classic <e>laryngeal</e> mask airway (cLMATM) can be used in place of an endotracheal tube (ETT) as the ventilatory device during percutaneous dilational tracheostomy (PDT). We aimed to investigate the possible loss of efficacy of cLMATM after tracheal intubation. METHODS: Severity of laryngeal lesions and efficacy of cLMATM were determined in two groups of thirty patients each who were switched from ETT ventilation to cLMA ventilation for PDT after a short (&lt;4 days) or a long (&gt;12 days) tracheal intubation. RESULTS: cLMATM allowed us to carry out PDT in all patients. Short tracheal intubations resulted in mild lesions of the larynx and mild gas leaks during cLMATM ventilation. Longer intubations caused moderate-to-severe (P&lt;0.05) lesions of the larynx and larger gas leaks. A single complication occurred in one patient post-procedurally and in no patient at 6-month follow-up. CONCLUSION: Efficacy of cLMATM was maintained after short tracheal intubation and decreased after long intubation.",M1

20196416,"Modified Mallampati test and thyromental distance as a predictor of difficult laryngoscopy in Thai patients.BACKGROUND: Preoperative evaluation of anatomical landmarks and clinical factors are important in the detection of patients at risk for difficult laryngoscopy. The modified Mallampati test (MMT) and thyromental distance (TMD) are commonly used for this purpose but there are controversies regarding their accuracy. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the present study was to evaluate the accuracy of MMT and TMD in the prediction of difficult laryngoscopy in Thai patients. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 1888 consecutive patients undergoing general anesthesia requiring endotracheal intubation were evaluated preoperatively using the MMT and TMD. The cut-off points for the difficult airway predictors were: Mallampati 3, 4 and TMD less than 6 cm. During direct laryngoscopy, the <e>laryngeal</e> view was graded using the Cormack and Lehane (CL) classification. CL grades III and IV were considered difficult laryngoscopy. Sensitivity and specificity for each airway predictor in isolation and in combination were determined. RESULTS: The present study found Mallampati grade I 1050 patients (55.6%), grade II 730 patients (38.7%), grade III 104 patients (5.5%), grade IV 4 pateints (0.2%) and TMD less than 6 cm 85 patients (4.5%), TMD more than 6 cm 1803 patients (95.5%). Difficult laryngoscopy occurred in 60 patients (3.2%). The sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value (PPV) and negative predictive value (NPV) for the two airway predictors were: MMT 41.7%, 95.5%, 23.1% and 98.0% and TMD 23.3%, 96.1%, 16.5% and 97.4% respectively. The combination of two predictors with a sensitivity, specificity PPV and NPV were 55.0%, 92.3%, 19.1% and 98.4%. CONCLUSION: MMT TMD and their combination are good predictors of difficult laryngoscopy in a Thai population.",M1
20194757,"Atrazine induces complete feminization and chemical castration in male African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis).The herbicide atrazine is one of the most commonly applied pesticides in the world. As a result, atrazine is the most commonly detected pesticide contaminant of ground, surface, and drinking water. Atrazine is also a potent endocrine disruptor that is active at low, ecologically relevant concentrations. Previous studies showed that atrazine adversely affects amphibian larval development. The present study demonstrates the reproductive consequences of atrazine exposure in adult amphibians. Atrazine-exposed males were both demasculinized (chemically castrated) and completely feminized as adults. Ten percent of the exposed genetic males developed into functional females that copulated with unexposed males and produced viable eggs. Atrazine-exposed males suffered from depressed testosterone, decreased breeding gland size, demasculinized/feminized <e>laryngeal</e> development, suppressed mating behavior, reduced spermatogenesis, and decreased fertility. These data are consistent with effects of atrazine observed in other vertebrate classes. The present findings exemplify the role that atrazine and other endocrine-disrupting pesticides likely play in global amphibian declines.",M1
20191777,"Fibreoptic assessment of paediatric sized <e>laryngeal</e> mask airways.Laryngeal mask airways (LMA) are commonly used in paediatric anaesthesia. A well-placed LMA should provide a direct view of the vocal cords facilitating bronchoscopy or fibreoptic intubation. The aim of this audit was to assess the bronchoscopic view of the glottis obtained through an LMA with regard to its size. We prospectively assessed the position of LMAs in relation to the glottic aperture in 350 children (zero to seven years) undergoing elective fibreoptic examination of the upper and/or lower airways. Following induction of anaesthesia and positioning of the LMA, a fibreoptic evaluation of the view of the glottis was performed (complete, partial or no visualisation). Chest movement on manual ventilation was judged as good in the majority of patients and adequate for the remainder. No overt signs of airway obstruction were noted in any patient. However, a complete view of the glottic aperture was present in only 50% of size 1 LMAs, 57.5% of size 1.5, 72.7% of size 2 and 77.8% of size 2.5. The epiglottis impinged on the LMA opening, partially obstructing the view of the glottis in 36.3% of size 1 LMAs, 31.5% of size 1.5, 21% of size 2 and 17.8% of size 2.5. In 13.7% of size 1 LMAs, 11% of size 1.5, 6.3% of size 2 and 4.4% of size 2.5, the epiglottis was completely downfolded, obstructing the view of the glottic aperture. The findings indicate that even if ventilation is judged as adequate, smaller paediatric LMAs are more commonly associated with suboptimal anatomical positioning with partial obstruction of the glottic aperture than larger LMAs, and therefore may require repositioning more often.",M1

Laryngeal cancer is the most common cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract. We present a patient with occupational lung disease whose chest CT showed miliary nodular pattern, with concurrent laryngeal cancer who had been engaged in type printing for 22 years. Histology of the laryngeal lession showed squamous cell laryngeal cancer. Histology of the nodules showed a foreign body granulomatous response with several foreign body cells, most probably due to exposure to numerous inorganic (lanthanides, elements such us La, Ce, Nd, Sm, EU, Tb, Lu) and organic particles (such us acrylates, epoxy- and urethane-acrylates).",M1
20179502,"Use of manometry for <e>laryngeal</e> mask airway reduces postoperative pharyngolaryngeal adverse events: a prospective, randomized trial.BACKGROUND: Adverse events such as pharyngolaryngeal complications are indicators of quality patient care. Use of manometry to limit the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) intracuff pressure is not currently a routine practice. This double-blind randomized trial compared pharyngolaryngeal complications in patients managed with manometers to limit the LMA intracuff pressure (&lt;44 mmHg) with patients under routine care. METHOD: Two hundred consenting patients who underwent ambulatory surgery were randomly allocated to pressure-limiting and routine care groups. Anesthesia was induced with propofol and fentanyl, and maintained with desflurane in air-oxygen. An LMA was inserted, and the cuff was inflated as per usual practice. The patients breathed spontaneously. Research assistants measured the LMA intracuff pressure. In the pressure-limiting group, LMA intracuff pressure was adjusted to less than 44 mmHg. No intervention was performed in the routine care group. Sore throat, dysphonia, and dysphagia were assessed at 1, 2, and 24 h postoperatively. Composite pharyngolaryngeal complications were compared using chi-square test. RESULTS: Baseline demographic data were comparable between groups. Mean LMA intracuff pressure was less in the pressure-limiting group versus the routine care group (40 +/- 6 vs. 114 +/- 57 mmHg, P &lt; 0.001). The incidence of composite pharyngolaryngeal complications was significantly lower in the pressure-limiting group versus the routine care group (13.4 vs. 45.6%, P &lt; 0.001), with a relative risk reduction of 70.6%, and a number needed to treat of three (95% CI 2.2-7.5). CONCLUSION: Reduction of LMA intracuff pressure to less than 44 mmHg lowers the incidence of postoperative pharyngolaryngeal complications. The LMA cuff pressures should be measured routinely using manometry, and deflating the intracuff pressure to less than 44 mmHg should be recommended as anesthetic best practice.",M1

20152896,"Manganese-mediated up-regulation of HIF-1alpha protein in Hep2 human <e>laryngeal</e> epithelial cells via activation of the family of MAPKs.High exposure of manganese is believed to be a risk factor for respiratory diseases. Evidence suggests that overexpression of HIF-1alpha transcription factor is linked to pulmonary inflammation and vascular change. In this study, we investigated the effect of manganese-chloride (manganese) on expression and activity of HIF-1alpha in various human airway cells, including Hep2 (laryngeal), H292 (bronchial), and A549 (lung). Profoundly, while manganese treatment led to low or little effect on induction of HIF-1alpha protein in H292 or A549 cells, it strongly induced HIF-1alpha protein expression in Hep2 cells. Mn treatment, however, did not induce HIF-1alpha mRNA expression in Hep2 cells. Luciferase experiments further demonstrated that manganese treatment increased the HRE-driven luciferase activity, suggesting that the induced HIF-1 is functional. Interestingly, manganese treatment also caused activation of p38 MAPK, JNK-1/2, ERK-1/2, and ATF-2, but not of PKB or NF-kappaB in Hep2 cells. Importantly, the manganese-mediated expression and activity of HIF-1alpha protein were largely blocked by treatment with the inhibitor of p38 MAPK (SB203580), JNK-1/2 (SP600125), or ERK-1/2 (PD98059), suggesting roles of these MAPKs in the manganese-induced HIF-1alpha protein expression and activity. Moreover, treatment with SP600125 or SB203580, but not PD98059, had partial inhibitory effects on the stability of HIF-1alpha protein induced by manganese, suggesting that p38 MAPK and JNK-1/2 also contribute to the Mn-mediated HIF-1alpha protein stability. These results suggest that manganese is able to up-regulate HIF-1alpha at the protein level in Hep2 cells and the up-regulation is largely dependent of activities of the family of MAPKs.",M1

The ethimoidal nerve was electrically stimulated to evoke sneezing, and the superior laryngeal nerve to evoke the laryngeal reflex, swallowing, and coughing. Carbachol reduced the amplitudes of the spontaneous electromyographic activities in the neck, TA, PCA, GG, and DIA to 7%, 30%, 54%, 45% and 71% of control, respectively, reduced the respiratory rate to 53% without changes in expiratory CO(2) concentration; the magnitude of the laryngeal reflex in the TA muscle to 56%; increased its latency by 13%; and reduced the probability of stimulus-induced sneezing, swallowing, and coughing to less than 40%. These changes lasted more than 1h. These data demonstrate that important upper airway reflexes are suppressed by increasing cholinergic neurotransmission in the mPRF. Because acetylcholine release in the mPRF changes in accordance with sleep-wake cycles, the present findings are relevant to the control of upper airway reflexes during various vigilance states.",M1
20136226,"Acoustic and laryngographic measures of the <e>laryngeal</e> reflexes of linguistic prominence and vocal effort in German.This study uses acoustic and physiological measures to compare laryngeal reflexes of global changes in vocal effort to the effects of modulating such aspects of linguistic prominence as sentence accent, induced by focus variation, and word stress. Seven speakers were recorded by using a laryngograph. The laryngographic pulses were preprocessed to normalize time and amplitude. The laryngographic pulse shape was quantified using open and skewness quotients and also by applying a functional version of the principal component analysis. Acoustic measures included the acoustic open quotient and spectral balance in the vowel /e/ during the test syllable. The open quotient and the laryngographic pulse shape indicated a significantly shorter open phase for loud speech than for soft speech. Similar results were found for lexical stress, suggesting that lexical stress and loud speech are produced with a similar voice source mechanism. Stressed syllables were distinguished from unstressed syllables by their open phase and pulse shape, even in the absence of sentence accent. Evidence for laryngeal involvement in signaling focus, independent of fundamental frequency changes, was not as consistent across speakers. Acoustic results on various spectral balance measures were generally much less consistent compared to results from laryngographic data.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Eleven cases of laryngeal tuberculosis were diagnosed over a period of 4 years and included in a retrospective study. RESULTS: We identified seven men and four women (average age 43 years). Dysphonia was the primary symptom. Direct laryngoscopy revealed more often a budding ulcerative aspect and allowed us to perform laryngeal biopsy; the pathologic study confirmed the diagnosis in all patients. Medical treatment for tuberculosis for a short period of 6 months was introduced. In all cases, the long-term evolution was favourable, with an average of 15 months. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The topography of tuberculosis is diverse, with many sites of localization.

20099474,"Hyoid movement and <e>laryngeal</e> penetration during sequential swallowing.This study examined hyoid movement during sequential swallowing and evaluated the relationship among trajectory patterns, swallowing types based on laryngeal movement and laryngeal penetration. Twelve healthy adults underwent videofluorography during sequential swallowing. Each swallow was classified into two types: opened laryngeal vestibule after swallow (i-Segmental type) and closed laryngeal vestibule after swallow (i-Continuous type). Each participant's swallowing type was classified by the same method. We analyzed two-dimensional movements of the hyoid, and the trajectories were classified into three patterns: hyoid moved in the anterosuperior direction after the onset of swallow (pattern L); hyoid moved in the anterosuperior direction after the onset of swallow, beyond the mandibular plane (pattern X); and the hyoid was above the mandibular plane at the onset of swallow, and then it moved in the inferior direction (pattern U). Two-way ANOVA revealed that there was a significant interaction between the swallowing type and trajectory pattern, and laryngeal penetration was the highest for the combination of individual swallow of i-Continuous type and pattern L. In sequential swallowing, the existence of a penetration-prone swallowing pattern combination was an interesting phenomenon relevant to eating management for dysphagic patients; however further study in patient groups is required.",M1
20098413,"A bony connection signals <e>laryngeal</e> echolocation in bats.Echolocation is an active form of orientation in which animals emit sounds and then listen to reflected echoes of those sounds to form images of their surroundings in their brains. Although echolocation is usually associated with bats, it is not characteristic of all bats. Most echolocating bats produce signals in the larynx, but within one family of mainly non-echolocating species (Pteropodidae), a few species use echolocation sounds produced by tongue clicks. Here we demonstrate, using data obtained from micro-computed tomography scans of 26 species (n = 35 fluid-preserved bats), that proximal articulation of the stylohyal bone (part of the mammalian hyoid apparatus) with the tympanic bone always distinguishes laryngeally echolocating bats from all other bats (that is, non-echolocating pteropodids and those that echolocate with tongue clicks). In laryngeally echolocating bats, the proximal end of the stylohyal bone directly articulates with the tympanic bone and is often fused with it. Previous research on the morphology of the stylohyal bone in the oldest known fossil bat (Onychonycteris finneyi) suggested that it did not echolocate, but our findings suggest that O. finneyi may have used laryngeal echolocation because its stylohyal bones may have articulated with its tympanic bones. The present findings reopen basic questions about the timing and the origin of flight and echolocation in the early evolution of bats. Our data also provide an independent anatomical character by which to distinguish laryngeally echolocating bats from other bats.",M1
20097312,"Gestational nicotine exposure exaggerates hyperthermic enhancement of <e>laryngeal</e> chemoreflex in rat pups.Laryngeal chemoreflex (LCR) apnea occurs in infant mammals in response to water or other liquids in the laryngeal lumen and is suspected to contribute to some cases of the sudden infant death syndrome. We have previously found that the LCR is prolonged in neonatal piglets and rats that are warmed 1-3 degrees C above their normal body temperatures and that this prolongation is exaggerated in rat pups whose mothers have been exposed to cigarette smoke during pregnancy. We have therefore examined the effects on the LCR of combined prenatal nicotine exposure and brief postnatal hyperthermia. Nicotine was infused in pregnant rats via implanted osmotic minipumps (6.5mg/kg per day) from gestational day 3 (G3) until G21, the day of delivery. Control animals received saline infusions. On postnatal days 4-12, LCR apnea and respiratory disruption, elicited by intralaryngeal water, were measured with and without hyperthermia in anesthetized pups. The results indicate that prenatal exposure to nicotine significantly exaggerates the hyperthermic prolongation of the LCR.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: Prospective animal study. SETTING: Academic research at a tertiary medical center. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Fifteen recipient mice (five per group) were injected with everolimus (1 mg/kg/d) until euthanized at 15, 30, and 60 days posttransplantation. Five mice received transplants without immunosuppression and were euthanized at day 15. Larynges were graded for rejection severity. Draining lymph nodes and spleens were evaluated by flow cytometry to assess the systemic immunological environment. RESULTS: Each time group demonstrated minor allograft rejection (rejection severity scores: 2.51, 2.46, 2.78; no rejection, 1; severe, 6). This was not significantly different between groups. Everolimus-treated mice had significantly less rejection at all time points compared with non-immunosuppressed mice. Flow cytometry showed a blunted cytotoxic T-cell response, differentiation favoring regulatory T-cells, and decreased number and function of dendritic cells. CONCLUSIONS: Everolimus successfully prevents laryngeal allograft rejection up to 60 days posttransplantation. It appears to increase the production of regulatory T-cells while decreasing cytotoxic T-cell and dendritic cell response. Everolimus alone or in combination with other immunosuppressants may enable laryngeal transplantation to become a viable reconstructive option following laryngectomy for malignancy.",M1

DESIGN: Randomized controlled animal study. SUBJECTS: Eight Sus scrofa piglets (15-20 kg) randomly intubated with either a standard or a modified uncuffed ETT. INTERVENTIONS: The modified ETT was handcrafted by gluing and then trimming dry polyvinyl acetate foam circumferentially to the distal end of a standard uncuffed ETT. After intubation, the foam quickly self-expanded as it absorbed the secretions of the laryngopharynx and adopted the shape of the intraluminal airway. This conforming shape also sealed the larynx to allow for positive pressure ventilation. Both groups were intubated for 4 hours under constant hypoxic conditions (mean oxygen saturation &lt;70%) to enhance and accelerate intubation damage. They were then humanely killed, and the larynx and trachea were harvested for histologic examination. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The severity of laryngeal injury graded on a scale from 0 to 4 (0 indicates normal; 1, epithelial compression; 2, epithelial loss; 3, subepithelial and glandular necrosis; and 4, perichondrium involvement). RESULTS: All of the specimens histologically demonstrated areas of inflammation and epithelial loss. The standard ETT caused substantial deep damage, with a mean (SD) severity score of 2.79 (0.74). The modified ETT caused mainly superficial damage, with a mean (SD) severity score of 1.65 (0.56) (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSION: The modified ETT objectively caused less laryngotracheal damage compared with the standard ETT and may be of potential clinical benefit.",M1
20069644,"The historical Latin and etymology of selected anatomical terms of the larynx.The etymological evolution of the anatomical terms larynx, cricoid, glottis, epiglottis, and thyroid (cartilage) dates to antiquity. Human dissection replaced animal in the 16th and 17th centuries and terms evolved. This evolution was recorded in the literature largely in Latin. We translated key studies of <e>laryngeal</e> anatomy from the 16th century to better understand this evolution. We present the Latin with our translations, and historical commentary as essential to this understanding. Vesalius favored the Latin scutiform (shield) for the thyroid cartilage, but recognized peltalis (shield). The Basle Nomina Anatomica (BNA) chose the Greek thyroid (theta upsilon rho epsilon omicron epsilon iota delta eta) for modern convention. Vesalius used the name  innominate  for the cricoid cartilage, but described its resemblance to a ring, drawn in the margin of the Fabrica. Krikoid, the Greek for ring shaped, was adopted by the BNA. Although the term arytenoid was used for centuries, Vesalius argued the Greek name referred to the spout of a cup or ladle. He recognized the human arytenoids as two separate cartilages as opposed to single in certain animals. The glottis was defined by Vesalius as the vocal fold or rima glottidis of today, and he advanced its function by understanding the paired, mobile arytenoid cartilages. He defined the function of the epiglottis and first described the pre-epiglottic space. Vesalius' student at Padua, Italy, Columbo contributed to anatomical knowledge, but animosity between them clouded the record. Harvey, working 75 years later in England, offers an evolutionary window from Vesalius. Harvey's laryngeal studies preceded by a decade his groundbreaking studies on the circulation of blood.",M1
20067440,"Pre-exposure to sulfur dioxide attenuates most allergic reactions upon trimellitic anhydride challenge in sensitized Brown Norway rats.Irritant-induced inflammation of the airways may aggravate respiratory allergy induced by chemical respiratory allergens. Therefore, it was studied whether airway irritation by sulfur dioxide (SO(2)) would enhance respiratory allergic reactions to trimellitic anhydride (TMA), using a rat model. Brown Norway (BN) rats were topically sensitized, subsequently exposed for a single time or repeatedly to 300 ppm SO(2), and challenged by inhalation to a distinctly irritating or minimally irritating concentration of TMA after the (last) SO(2) exposure. Repeated exposure to SO(2) alone reduced breathing frequency during exposure, and caused epithelial alterations including hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia, and infiltration of polymorphonuclear inflammatory cells into nasal tissues, larynx, trachea, and bronchi/bronchioli. Histopathological changes were less prominent after 1 day of SO(2) exposure. Repeated pre-exposure to SO(2) reduced the number of TMA-induced apnoeas, in an SO(2) exposure duration-dependent manner. This effect of SO(2) on TMA-induced functional allergic reactions (apnoeas) was distinct only when the TMA challenge concentration was not too irritating itself. Repeated pre-exposure to SO(2) reduced TMA-induced <e>laryngeal</e> ulceration, goblet-cell hyperplasia, and inflammation in the lungs in most animals, regardless of the TMA challenge concentration. The SO(2)-induced replacement of normal respiratory epithelium by less sensitive, squamous epithelium may offer an explanation for the, unexpected, reduced allergic manifestation. However in a few animals, SO(2) appeared to facilitate TMA-induced irritation, probably due to incomplete protection. Overall, SO(2) exposure of TMA-sensitized rats reduced TMA-related allergic respiratory responses in most animals.",M1
20058989,"Unsteady <e>laryngeal</e> airflow simulations of the intra-glottal vortical structures.The intra-glottal vortical structures developed in a static divergent glottis with continuous flow entering the glottis are characterized. Laryngeal airflow calculations are performed using the Large Eddy Simulation approach. It has been shown that intra-glottal vortices are formed on the divergent wall of the glottis, immediately downstream of the separation point. Even with non-pulsatile flow entering the glottis, the vortices are intermittently shed, producing unsteady flow at the glottal exit. The vortical structures are characterized by significant negative static pressure relative to the ambient pressure. These vortices increase in size and strength as they are convected downstream by the flow due to the entrained air from the supra-glottal region. The negative static pressures associated with the intra-glottal vortical structures suggest that the closing phase during phonation may be accelerated by such vortices. The intra-glottal negative pressures can affect both vocal fold vibration and voice production.",M1

Aspiration is defined as passage of materials through the vocal folds, and <e>laryngeal</e> penetration is defined as passage of materials into the larynx, but not through the vocal folds. In this study, we compared the risk of laryngeal penetration or aspiration during VF using various liquid volumes and food consistencies. Between January 2006 and September 2008, 229 patients with suspected dysphagia each were fed at least 2 out of 6 types of liquids or foods during VF in an upright posture without compensatory maneuvers. The 6 types were pudding-thick barium of 4 ml (PD), thin liquid barium of 4 ml (LQ4) and 10 ml (LQ10), one swallow of thin liquid barium from a cup (CUP), corned beef hash (8 g) with barium (CB), and a two-phase mixture of corned beef hash (4 g) with barium and thin liquid barium of 5 ml (MX). The paired comparisons revealed that laryngeal penetration risk increased in the following order: PD, CB, LQ4, LQ10, MX and CUP, while aspiration risk after PD increased in the following order: CB, LQ4, LQ10, CUP and MX. Thus, risk of laryngeal penetration or aspiration varies, depending on food types. In conclusion, risk of aspiration is highest with the two-phase food, and multi-textured foods should be used with caution in individuals with dysphagia.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: Case-control study. ANIMALS: National Hunt Thoroughbred racehorses (n=71) and race-matched controls (n=126). METHODS: Race records for National Hunt racehorses that had LP and ventriculocordectomy were analyzed and racing performance was compared with race-matched controls. RESULTS: Sixty-three of 71 cases were matched with controls. Postoperatively, 78% of cases raced, 47% improved their individual performance and cases were as likely to start in 1 or 3 races as controls. In the 5 preoperative races, case horses earned less prize money than race-matched controls but there was no difference in prize money earned in 5 postoperative races between groups. Cases started in significantly fewer total (lifetime) races both before and after the date of surgery compared with controls. CONCLUSIONS: LP seemingly restored short-term postoperative racing performance of National Hunt horses to a level comparable with that of a matched control population; however, the career  longevity  of case horses appears to be shorter than that of control horses.

STUDY DESIGN: Case series. ANIMALS: National Hunt Thoroughbred racehorses (n=68). METHODS: Grade of postoperative arytenoid abduction for National Hunt racehorses that had LP with ventriculocordectomy was assessed at 1 day, 6 days, and 6 weeks after LP. Race records were analyzed to ascertain if there was correlation between the degree of arytenoid cartilage abduction and various measures of race performance (return to racing postoperatively, total earnings in 5 races immediately postoperatively, and lifetime number of starts postoperatively). RESULTS: Median postoperative arytenoid abduction was grade 2 on day 1 but had decreased to grade 3 by 6 weeks. Horses with grades 1, 2, and 3 abduction 1 day after surgery had median losses of 1, 1, and 0.5 abduction grades, respectively, at 6 weeks. Horses with grade 1 abduction on day 1 were significantly more likely to lose abduction by day 6 after surgery than horses with grade 3 abduction on day 1. There was no statistically significant correlation between the postoperative grade of arytenoid abduction at any time point and earnings in 5 races after surgery, likelihood of racing postoperatively, or total number of lifetime race starts postoperatively. CONCLUSIONS: Horses with maximal (grade 1) surgical arytenoid abduction are significantly more likely to suffer postoperative loss of abduction than those with grade 3 abduction. Postoperative grade of abduction does not appear significantly correlated with markers of racing performance in National Hunt racehorses; however, very few horses with poor (grade 4 or 5) abduction were included and thus conclusions regarding racing performance in such horses cannot be drawn from this study. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Seemingly, most horses with grade 3 <e>laryngeal</e> abduction can race successfully and perhaps surgeons should not be disillusioned by the appearance of only moderate (grade 3) abduction in the long term after LP in racehorses.",M1
20013850,"Transoral laser ventricular fold resection and thyroarytenoid myoneurectomy for adductor spasmodic dysphonia: long-term outcome.OBJECTIVES: A transoral approach to laser myoneurectomy of the thyroarytenoid muscles was recently reported as an effective technique for treatment of adductor spasmodic dysphonia (ASD). The short-term results were encouraging. In this study, a long-term surgical outcome of this technique is investigated. STUDY DESIGN: A prospective clinical series. METHODS: Fifty-two patients with ASD underwent transoral laryngomicrosurgery with a CO(2) laser to resect the ventricular folds followed by myoneurectomy of the thyroarytenoid muscles. The nerve fibers of recurrent <e>laryngeal</e> nerve terminating at the thyroarytenoid muscle, which were frequently found branching deeply among the posterior belly of this muscle, were vaporized. Care was taken not to damage the vocal ligaments, lateral cricoarytenoid muscles, or arytenoid cartilages. Pre- and postoperative subjective voice assessments, and acoustic and aerodynamic measurements, were performed and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: Twenty-nine of the 52 patients who were followed up for more than 12 months (range, 12-63 months; mean, 31 months) were studied. Moderate and marked vocal improvement was achieved in 90% (26/29) of the patients. Three patients had 30% improvement, which was reported as unsuccessful. Eight of the 26 patients who were satisfied with their postoperative voice still had a mild strain during phonation. Of the eight patients, seven achieved normal or nearly normal voice quality after revision laser surgery. No significant vocal deficit or paralysis was observed in any patient. CONCLUSIONS: After long-term follow-up of 31 months on average, approximately 90% of the ASD patients obtained moderate to marked improvement of vocal performance after transoral laser surgery. The long-lasting outcome is encouraging.",M1
20012947,"<e>Laryngeal</e> somatosensory deficits in Parkinson's disease: implications for speech respiratory and phonatory control.Parkinson's disease (PD) is often associated with substantial impairment of speech respiratory and phonatory control. However, the degree to which these impairments are related to abnormal laryngeal sensory function is unknown. This study examined whether individuals with PD exhibited abnormal and more asymmetric laryngeal somatosensory function compared with healthy controls, and whether these deficits were associated with disease and voice severity. Nineteen PD participants were tested and compared with 18 healthy controls. Testing included endoscopic assessment of laryngeal somatosensory function, with aerodynamic and acoustic assessment of respiratory and phonatory control, and clinical ratings of voice and disease severity. PD participants exhibited significantly abnormal and asymmetric laryngeal somatosensory function compared with healthy controls. Sensory deficits were significantly associated with timing of phonatory onset, voice intensity, respiratory driving pressure, laryngeal resistance, lung volume expended per syllable, disease severity, and voice severity. These results suggest that respiratory and phonatory control are influenced by laryngeal somatosensory function, that speech-related deficits in PD are related to abnormal laryngeal somatosensory function, and that this function may degrade as a function of disease severity. Thus, PD may represent a model of airway sensorimotor disintegration, highlighting the important role of the basal ganglia and related neural networks in the integration of laryngeal sensory input for speech-related motor control.",M1
20006418,"Out-of-hospital airway management by paramedics and emergency physicians using <e>laryngeal</e> tubes.CONCEPT: Endotracheal intubation (ETI) is considered to be the gold standard of prehospital airway management. However, ETI requires substantial technical skills and ongoing experience. Because failed prehospital ETI is common and associated with a higher mortality, reliable airway devices are needed to be used by rescuers less experienced in ETI. We prospectively evaluated the feasibility of laryngeal tubes used by paramedics and emergency physicians for out-of-hospital airway management. MATERIAL AND METHODS: During a 24-month period, all cases of prehospital use of the laryngeal tube disposable (LT-D) and laryngeal tube suction disposable (LTS-D) within five operational areas of emergency medical services were recorded by a standardised questionnaire. We determined indications for laryngeal tube use, placement success, number of placement attempts, placement time and personal level of experience. RESULTS: Of 157 prehospital intubation attempts with the LT-D/LTS-D, 152 (96.8%) were successfully performed by paramedics (n=70) or emergency physicians (n=87). The device was used as initial airway (n=87) or rescue device after failed ETI (n=70). The placement time was &lt; or =45s (n=120), 46-90s (n=20) and &gt;90s (n=7). In five cases the time needed was not specified. The number of placement attempts was one (n=123), two (n=25), three (n=2) and more than three (n=2). The majority of users (61.1%) were relative novices with no more than five previous laryngeal tube placements. CONCLUSION: The LT-D/LTS-D represents a reliable tool for prehospital airway management in the hands of both paramedics and emergency physicians. It can be used as an initial tool to secure the airway until ETI is prepared, as a definitive airway by rescuers less experienced with ETI or as a rescue device when ETI has failed.",M1
20004027,"The combined endoscopic management of congenital <e>laryngeal</e> web.Laryngeal web in the anterior commissure is a rare congenital anomaly often leading to severe dyspnea. Endoscopic procedures based on a simple transsection in these cases may worsen the condition because vocal folds have a tendency for fibrosis and granulation tissue formation after surgical interventions. Thus the traditional treatment of choice is the demanding, externally performed laryngotracheal reconstruction generally with a rib cartilage graft and longer period of stenting. This report presents the successful endoscopic management of a congenital laryngeal web in a 2-year-old boy, who previously underwent an uneffective scar laser transsection that led to excessive glotto-subglottic refibrosis. After the CO(2)-laser transsection the authors applied Mitomycin-C and inserted a combined silicon stent by extra-endolaryngeal technique. After the removal of the stent the patient could be decannulated and his voice improved. The application of these minimally invasive endoscopic techniques was successful, hence it may be an effective alternative treatment option for laryngeal webs.",M1
19999359,"Vocal exercise versus voice rest following botulinum toxin injections: a randomized crossover trial.OBJECTIVES: The intensity of muscle activity immediately following intramuscular botulinum toxin injection may affect the clinical efficacy of the injection. We tested this effect in patients who underwent botulinum toxin injections for adductor spasmodic dysphonia. METHODS: Patients were studied over 3 to 5 injection cycles. Cycle 1 was the baseline control; cycle 2 was randomized between a 1-hour reading aloud task ( exercise ) and a 24-hour period of complete voice rest. For cycle 3, the patient completed the task not performed in cycle 2. Patients who were willing to continue for cycles 4 and 5 repeated the experiment at one half the injection dosage. Efficacy was determined with a battery of voice recordings and clinical outcomes instruments administered via telephone at 2- to 4-week intervals. The primary outcome measure was the result of the Voice-Related Quality of Life (VRQOL) instrument. RESULTS: Nine patients (8 women, 1 man) with a mean age of 60.8 years (range, 42 to 76 years) completed at least 3 injection cycles. The VRQOL results were significantly higher for cycles that followed the exercise task. The patients reported subjectively that these were some of the best injection cycles they had ever experienced. Some achieved equivalent results with the half-dose injection plus exercise. The VRQOL results after voice rest cycles were not significantly different from the patients' baseline cycles. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the conclusion that a period of intense vocalization immediately following <e>laryngeal</e> botulinum toxin injections improves the efficacy of the injection. Possible mechanisms are proposed.",M1

It is reflected in the acoustic characteristics of the phonemes as deviations from their healthy counterparts. In the current work, the deviations associated with laryngeal dysfunctions are analysed in order to assess and quantify parameters that will help evaluate dysarthria. Perturbation measures, pitch period statistics and Pitch Variation Index (PVI) are computed for the assessment of laryngeal dysfunctions of dysarthric speakers. The assessments were performed on the Nemours database of dysarthric speech and compared with normal speakers available in the TIMIT speech corpus. The results were correlated with Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA) scores. The analysis resulted in a technique to predict the degree of severity of dysarthria and illustrate the multi-causal nature of the disorder.",M1
19950372,"Laryngopharyngeal sensory deficits and impaired pharyngeal motor function predict aspiration in patients irradiated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: To assess the contribution of laryngopharyngeal sensory deficits and impaired pharyngeal motor function to aspiration in patients irradiated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. STUDY DESIGN: A retrospective study at a tertiary referral university teaching hospital. METHODS: One hundred consecutive patients who underwent radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma referred to a dysphagia clinic underwent sensory testing of their laryngopharynx and endoscopic evaluation of their swallowing. The sensory threshold of the laryngopharynx was determined, the pharyngeal contraction assessed, and the status of the larynx and hypopharynx documented before and after swallowing. The presence of <e>laryngeal</e> penetration and aspiration was noted. RESULTS: The average time from radiation therapy to assessment was 10.2 years, and the mean duration of swallowing symptoms was 27 months. Laryngopharyngeal sensation was deficient in 89% of patients and the pharyngeal contraction impaired in 93% patients. Laryngeal penetration and aspiration occurred in 87% and 74% of patients, respectively. Aspiration was associated with food residue in the pyriform fossae after swallowing (P &lt; .001) and impaired pharyngeal contraction (P &lt; .001), but not with laryngopharyngeal sensory deficiency. There was no association between a laryngopharyngeal sensory deficit and impaired pharyngeal contraction. CONCLUSIONS: Impaired pharyngeal contraction and food bolus clearance from the hypopharynx during swallowing are more important than laryngopharyngeal sensory deficiency in predicting aspiration in patients who underwent radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.",M1
19950370,"Electromyographic <e>laryngeal</e> synkinesis alters prognosis in vocal fold paralysis.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Synkinesis, or misdirected reinnervation, is likely a confounder when predicting return of function of an immobile vocal fold. Currently, no information exists on the incidence of synkinesis in unilateral vocal fold immobility (UVFI) or the effect synkinesis has on prognosis and treatment. Our objective was to examine a vocal fold adductor synkinesis screening protocol using diagnostic laryngeal electromyography (LEMG). We aim to determine the effect of synkinesis on prognosis of recovery of purposeful vocal fold motion. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review of LEMG data and patient charts from laryngology practice. METHODS: A standardized LEMG analysis method to diagnose vocal fold adductory synkinesis was performed in 124 consecutive laryngeal electromyographic exams. RESULTS: Synkinesis testing was positive in 12/124 patients (9.7%). Post hoc quantitative analysis of electromyographic recordings to compare motor unit potential amplitude in the thyroarytenoid/lateral cricoarytenoid complex during sustained phonation to those in the same muscle during a  sniff  revealed a significant difference in motor unit potential amplitude ratio for control subjects (0.32), those who recovered purposeful vocal fold motion (0.40), and those with vocal fold paralysis (0.96) (P = .001). The presence of synkinesis in patients with UVFI improved the negative predictive value of LEMG from 53% to 100% and the sensitivity from 56% to 100%. CONCLUSIONS: Presence of laryngeal synkinesis using motor amplitude ratio criteria, in the setting of good voluntary motor unit recruitment and UVFI, downgrades a patient's prognosis to one that is poor for recovery. We propose this screening protocol as an adjunct to diagnostic LEMG.",M1
19948754,"Using <e>laryngeal</e> electromyography to differentiate presbylarynges from paresis.PURPOSE: Differential diagnosis of patients over 64 years of age reporting hoarseness is challenging. Laryngeal electromyography (LEMG) was used to determine the status of the recurrent and superior laryngeal nerves. The authors hypothesized that individuals with hoarseness but normal LEMG would have measures similar to those of patients from previous studies with presbylarynges and significantly different from those of patients with abnormal LEMG. METHOD: A retrospective chart review of acoustic, aerodynamic, endoscopic, and self-rating measures was completed for 52 individuals over 64 years of age reporting moderate to severe hoarseness. RESULTS: Individuals with normal LEMG had measures similar to those of patients from previous studies diagnosed with presbylarynges. The group with LEMG abnormalities was subcategorized by specific nerve(s) affected. Significant differences were found for measures between presbylarynges and unilateral but not bilateral paresis groups. Several endoscopic findings were observed more often than expected in the presbylarynges group. Using electromyography as a gold standard, the presence of any impairment in arytenoid movement had the most sensitivity (77%) in making the diagnosis of paresis, and the absence of any impairment had the most specificity (67%) in making the diagnosis of presbylarynges. CONCLUSION: LEMG may be useful in differentially diagnosing hoarseness in older patients, especially to distinguish between bilateral paresis and presbylarynges.",M1
19940187,"Functional but not structural networks of the human <e>laryngeal</e> motor cortex show left hemispheric lateralization during syllable but not breathing production.The laryngeal motor cortex (LMC) is indispensible for the vocal motor control of speech and song production. Patients with bilateral lesions in this region are unable to speak and sing, although their nonverbal vocalizations, such as laughter and cry, are preserved. Despite the importance of the LMC in the control of voluntary voice production in humans, the literature describing its connections remains sparse. We used diffusion tensor probabilistic tractography and functional magnetic resonance imaging-based functional connectivity analysis to identify LMC networks controlling two tasks necessary for speech production: voluntary voice as repetition of two different syllables and voluntary breathing as controlled inspiration and expiration. Peaks of activation during all tasks were found in the bilateral ventral primary motor cortex in close proximity to each other. Functional networks of the LMC during voice production but not during controlled breathing showed significant left-hemispheric lateralization (p &lt; 0.0005). However, structural networks of the LMC associated with both voluntary voice production and controlled breathing had bilateral hemispheric organization. Our findings indicate the presence of a common bilateral structural network of the LMC, upon which different functional networks are built to control various voluntary laryngeal tasks. Bilateral organization of functional LMC networks during controlled breathing supports its indispensible role in all types of laryngeal behaviors. Significant left-hemispheric lateralization of functional networks during simple but highly learned voice production suggests the readiness of the LMC network for production of a complex voluntary behavior, such as human speech.",M1
19921363,"Comparison of Parker-tipped and Murphy-tipped tracheal tubes in Airway Scope-assisted intubation in a manikin.PURPOSE: We tested our hypothesis that a Parker-tipped tracheal tube could improve the reliability of tracheal tube passage as compared to a Murphy-tipped tracheal tube during Airway Scope-assisted intubation in a manikin. METHODS: Twenty-seven resident doctors performed Airway Scope-assisted intubations using both tracheal tubes, and the number of times the tracheal tube tip touched the glottis or other <e>laryngeal</e> structures was counted on the Airway Scope monitor. RESULTS: The incidence of the tracheal tube tip touching the glottis during Airway Scope-assisted intubation using the Parker-tipped tracheal tube (7.4%; 2 of 27 attempts) was significantly less than that obtained using the Murphy-tipped tracheal tube (33.3%; 9 of 27 attempts; P = 0.039).

The ulcers appear every one or two weeks for at least one entire year. Some patients suspected for recurrent aphthoid stomatitis develop lesions in atypical sites - mainly in the larynx - concurrently to the ones found in the oral mucosa. AIM: this study aims to describe a series of recurrent aphthoid stomatitis patients with atypical laryngeal injuries. Study design: this is a case series study. MATERIALS AND METHOD: patients diagnosed with recurrent aphthoid stomatitis with oral mucosa ulcers and laryngeal symptoms without altered lab test results and no evidence of systemic disease underwent fibroscopic examination, oral and laryngeal biopsies, followed by specimen evaluation by direct immunofluorescence. RESULTS: all six patients in this series had acute and chronic inflammatory processes according to pathology studies and negative direct immunofluorescence test results. CONCLUSION: laryngeal involvement in recurrent aphthoid stomatitis is rare. Therefore, during diagnostic examination thorough clinical history and meticulous physical examination accompanied by fibroscopic examination are necessary. When atypical lesions are found, biopsies for histological evaluation and direct immunofluorescence tests are required.",M1

We get informed consent from a person in question and the bereaved family. The superior laryngeal artery was divided into the ascending and descending branches. The ascending branch supplied the epiglottis chiefly from the ventral surface, and anastomosed with branches of the lingual artery.

19877191,"Decoy NF-kappaB fortified immature dendritic cells maintain <e>laryngeal</e> allograft integrity and provide enhancement of regulatory T cells.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The increased risk of malignancy associated with post-transplant immunosuppression limits the potential of laryngeal transplantation as a reconstructive option. This risk may be mitigated by utilizing decoy nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) immature dendritic cells (iDC) to provide donor-specific tolerance. The purpose of this study was to explore whether tolerogenic properties of iDC can be applied to composite tissue transplantation. STUDY DESIGN: Animal study. METHODS: Five iDC-injected mice were euthanized at 15, 30, and 60 days post-laryngeal transplant. Control groups included five transplanted mice without immunosuppression, one iDC-injected mouse euthanized prior to transplantation, one mouse without injection or transplantation, and one mouse administered mature DC to serve as an accelerated rejection control. Larynges were graded for rejection severity according to a grading scale. Draining lymph nodes and spleens were evaluated by flow cytometry to determine immunogenic activity of iDC and T cells locally and peripherally. RESULTS: Each time group demonstrated moderate allograft rejection (rejection severity scores: 4.38, 5.10, 5.29). NF-kappaB iDC-treated mice had significantly less rejection at all time points compared to nonimmunosuppressed mice. Flow cytometry showed inhibition of cytotoxic T cell infiltration and expansion of regulatory T cells at the allograft site. CONCLUSIONS: iDC immunosuppression maintains laryngeal allograft integrity up to 60 days post-transplantation. Regulatory T cells are enhanced at the allograft site, which serves to suppress immune cell activation and induce self-antigen tolerance. iDC injection may lessen post-transplant comorbidities by decreasing the systemic immune response and favorably affecting concurrent immunosuppressive dose sequencing for laryngeal allograft preservation.",M1
19877187,"A new mouse <e>laryngeal</e> transplantation rejection grading system.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Development of a rat laryngeal transplantation model allowed for the first total human laryngeal transplantation by the senior author in 1998. In an effort to further our knowledge of the immune system's role in laryngeal rejection, a change to the mouse model was required. Prior to initiating immunosuppressive research protocols, a reliable mouse larynx rejection classification had to be established. STUDY DESIGN: Animal study. METHODS: Thirty-one mouse laryngeal transplants (C57 BL/6 donors to C3H recipients) were performed and allowed to reject. Six time points were evaluated histologically: 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, and 15 days post-transplant. Eight anatomic sites were evaluated and assigned a point value. A linear regression model was constructed using the group number as the response and the scores from the eight histological criteria as predictors. Severity classifications were determined by observing patterns in the sum of scores of variables found to be significant contributors. Group 1 was normal; group 2, minimal rejection; groups 3, 4, and 5, moderate rejection; and group 6, severe rejection. RESULTS: All mice survived the transplants. Of the observed histological changes, cartilage, fat, muscle, and magnitude of lymphocytic infiltration significantly correlated with rejection severity. The rejection model created demonstrated 100% accuracy in predicting the severity classification for the 31 specimens in the study. CONCLUSIONS: The model established provides an accurate and reliable way to classify rejection severity in mice receiving laryngeal allografts. This sets the stage for future advanced study of manipulating the immune system as a mechanism for establishing allograft tolerance.",M1
19875464,"Staging of <e>laryngeal</e> cancer using 64-channel multidetector row CT: comparison of standard neck CT with dedicated breath-maneuver laryngeal CT.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: With a 64-channel multidetector row CT, imaging acquisition during speech, swallowing, or phonation has become feasible. However, the actual benefit of these additional focused images should be critically evaluated with respect to radiation dose. The purpose of this study was to determine if dedicated laryngeal CT using breath-holding and straw-blowing improved the accuracy of TNM-staging for patients with biopsy-proved laryngeal carcinomas in comparison with a standard neck CT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 27 patients underwent a standard neck CT and a laryngeal CT with additional images acquired while patients held their breath or blew through a straw. Two radiologists interpreted the neck CT and later the laryngeal CT and assigned a TNM-stage for each case. These interpretations were compared with a TNM-stage determined by surgery and/or clinical examination for the individual patients. The accuracy of standard neck CT was compared with the accuracy of laryngeal CT. RESULTS: The overall accuracy was not significantly different between standard neck CT and the additional laryngeal CT and was, in fact, lower in cases with additional larynx images. The accuracy of staging was slightly improved with the additional laryngeal CT for glottic cancers; however, it was decreased for supraglottic cancers. The accuracy of a dichotomous diagnosis of early-versus-advanced-stage cancer was 0.86 for the standard neck CT and 0.80 for the laryngeal CT. The readers' confidence levels did not improve with the use of the additional images. CONCLUSIONS: In the era of isovoxel multidetector CT technology and judicious monitoring of radiation dose, a standard neck CT with coronal and sagittal reformats should suffice for the staging of laryngeal cancer.",M1
19862544,"Three-dimensional imaging of the larynx for pre-operative planning of <e>laryngeal</e> framework surgery.Modern laryngeal framework surgery (LFS) requires an exact understanding of the laryngeal biomechanics and precise pre-operative planning, for which bi-planar imaging is not sufficient. The aim of the study was to test whether MIMICS, a commercially available software package for three-dimensional (3D) rendering of high-resolution computerised tomography (HRCT), is suitable for 3D imaging of the larynx, analysis of laryngeal biomechanics and pre-operative planning. We examined four cadaver larynx and one patient larynx. In the five larynges, all relevant structures and landmarks could be 3D visualised. Superimposing of two HRCT scans shows that when the arytenoids move from 'respiration' to 'phonation', they perform a rotating, translating and tilting motion. Moreover, we could demonstrate that the vocal fold elongates by 7% with cricothyroid approximation. We conclude that MIMCS is well suited for 3D imaging of the larynx, analysis of laryngeal biomechanics and pre-operative planning of LFS procedures.",M1

DESIGN: Case-control, retrospective. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-five participants divided into 2 cohorts according to cognitive level at the time of baseline instrumental swallowing assessment. Group 1 (n = 17) participants were at Rancho Los Amigo (RLA) level II/III or RLA level III, while Group 2 (n = 18) participants were rated better than RLA level III. RESULTS: Aspiration and <e>laryngeal</e> penetration rates for both groups were similar (aspiration rate Group 1 = 41%, Group 2 = 39%; laryngeal penetration rate Group 1 = 59%, Group 2 = 61%).

CONCLUSION: The majority of participants who underwent an instrumental swallowing examination while still functioning at RLA level II/III or RLA level III were able to return to some form of oral feedings immediately following their baseline examination. Swallowing as a treatment modality can be considered a part of the overall plan to facilitate neurobehavioral recovery for patients with prolonged disordered consciousness participating in rehabilitation.",M1
19858971,"<e>Laryngeal</e> function: a comparative analysis between children and adults subsequent to traumatic brain injury.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate laryngeal function and speech disorders in children and adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI) by applying both perceptual and instrumental analysis. PARTICIPANTS: 15 children and 15 adults with moderate to severe acquired TBI and 2 control groups (19 adults and 16 children). MAIN MEASURES: A battery of perceptual analyses (the Frenchay Dysarthria Assessment (FDA) and speech sample assessment) and instrumental techniques (electrolaryngographic and computerized airflow/air pressure analysis systems-Aerophone II). RESULTS: While children with TBI exhibited fewer speech disorders (based on the deviant laryngeal features) than did the adult group with TBI during the perceptual assessments, the significant differences found between both groups using electroglottography (EGG) analysis for the laryngeal function investigation could be explained by the anatomical and physiological differences between adults and children. Consistent with the findings based on electroglottography, the aerodynamic analysis carried out in the present study failed to demonstrate significant changes in laryngeal function following TBI in either adults or children. CONCLUSIONS: Four reasons may explain the differences between children and adults: (1) the different types of injury can vary the degree of neurologic impairment, (2) potential differences during recovery, (3) the developmental changes in, or level of maturation of, laryngeal function in the pediatric group and, (4) time postinjury. Because of these variations, children may be better able to compensate for any impairment.",M1

In order to improve such patients' quality of life, we sought to preserve the larynx by selective (intra-arterial), rapid infusion chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy. METHODS: Chemotherapy was administered intra-arterially in the angiography suite via transfemoral catheterisation of the superior thyroid artery. Patients received up to four once-weekly infusions of cisplatin (75 mg/patient) with simultaneous intravenous administration of sodium thiosulphate, a neutralising agent. Patients also received external radiation simultaneously at a dose of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy per fraction, once daily for five days a week for 7 weeks. RESULTS: Intra-arterial infusion chemo-radiotherapy was performed in eight patients with advanced laryngeal carcinoma (four glottic, three supraglottic and one subglottic type carcinoma). A complete response was achieved at the primary site and at lymph node metastases in all eight patients. Overall toxic side effects were modest. No catheter-related thrombo-embolic complications were observed during any of the chemotherapy sessions.

METHODS: Thirty-nine patients (15 with supraglottic <e>laryngeal</e> cancer and 24 with hypopharyngeal cancer) who had undergone subtotal laryngectomy between 2000 and 2006 were included in this study. In all patients, a sternohyoid muscle flap has been used for primary, one-stage reconstruction of laryngopharyngeal defects, following resection of advanced stage lesions. Patients' times to oral intake and decannulation, their speech function and their post-operative complications were reviewed. RESULTS: The patients' three-year overall survival rate was 46.1 per cent. Their mean time to oral intake was 14 days. Twenty-six patients were decannulated (66.7 per cent). Almost all patients regained their speech function post-operatively, although their voice quality was not as good as before surgery. CONCLUSIONS: Sternohyoid muscle fascia reconstruction leads to optimal repair of subtotal laryngectomy defects and restored laryngeal function.",M1
19847995,"Local immune status and tumour marker expression in the human larynx.This study examined the local immune status and tumour marker expression in secretions and related tissue specimens from the <e>laryngeal</e> ventricle, comparing individuals with and without head and neck cancer. Laryngeal secretion and mucosal tissue specimens were collected during laryngeal microsurgery or surgical laryngectomy. The laryngeal secretions were found to contain immunological factors such as immunoglobulins G and A and secretory immunoglobulin A. A high level of the tumour marker Cyfra 21-1 was also detected in laryngeal secretions and mucosal tissue. Lows levels of secretory immunoglobulin A and Cyfra 21-1 were seen in the laryngeal mucosal tissue of controls and patients who had previously undergone radiation therapy. The level of secretory immunoglobulin A in laryngeal secretions closely correlated to the level of this immunoglobulin in mucosal tissue. These results indicate that local immunity is present in the human larynx; furthermore, it is strongly affected both by the presence of malignancy and by laryngeal cancer treatments such as irradiation.",M1

19824052,"11.7 Tesla magnetic resonance microimaging of <e>laryngeal</e> tissue architecture.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: High-resolution imaging of vocal folds that distinguishes vocal fold (VF) layered microstructure and VF implants would provide a key experimental tool for translational research investigating biomaterial-based interventions to treat vocal fold scar. To establish proof of concept, we studied whether 11.7 Tesla (T) magnetic resonance (MR) microimaging provides the needed resolution to resolve vocal fold tissue architecture. STUDY DESIGN: We performed ex vivo MR microimaging of fixed ferret and canine larynges to determine whether changes in the layered architecture can be detected in the presence of scar and subsequent to biomaterial injections into the vocal folds. Serial section histological analyses were done to corroborate MR microimaging findings. METHODS: Multiple axial and transverse/coronal 300-microm slices were obtained using an 11.7 T MR spectrometer/500 MHz for proton with gradient-recalled echo and rapid acquisition with relaxation enhancement imaging sequences. RESULTS: High-resolution (39 microm/pixel) MR microimages distinguished VF epithelium, lamina propria, muscle, and cartilage in ferret and canine larynges. In ferret scarred VFs (n = 25), collagen-rich dense scar tissue was distinguishable from contralateral nonscarred VFs and from normal ferret VFs (n = 25), as confirmed on histology. MR microimaging accurately detected injected autologous fat, hyaluronic acid-based and polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based implants injected into both ferret and canine VFs. Importantly, MRI accurately showed resorption of PEG implants in ferrets and canines, as confirmed on histology. Additionally, ex vivo MR spectroscopy distinguished fat from PEG-based implants. CONCLUSIONS: Ex vivo 11.7 T MR microimaging provided high-resolution images of ferret and canine laryngeal tissue microstructure, although the superficial lamina propria could not be distinguished. Histology confirmed MR microimaging findings, indicating utility of MR microimaging of modeled scar, implant residence time, and tissue responses, thus providing integrative insight relevant to translational research.",M1

19818701,"Role of the artificial tooth arch during swallowing in edentates.PURPOSE: This study aimed to clarify the role of the artificial tooth arch (ATA) during swallowing in edentates. METHODS: The tongue pressures, activities of the masseter and suprahyoid muscles, and <e>laryngeal</e> and mandibular movements when swallowing saliva, water, pudding, and corned beef were measured simultaneously using experimental dentures with and without an ATA. We analysed the maximum magnitudes of muscle activities and tongue pressures (MAmax and TPmax, respectively), the times from reaching MAmax and TPmax to laryngeal movement (TLM-MAmax and TLM-TPmax, respectively), and the vertical mandibular position. RESULTS: The MAmax of the masseter muscle and TPmax were significantly greater with the ATA than without the ATA (p&lt;0.05). However, MAmax of the suprahyoid muscles was not significantly different in the conditions with and without the ATA. TLM-TPmax was significantly longer without the ATA than with the ATA (p&lt;0.05) but the TLM-MAmax of the suprahyoid and masseter muscles were not significantly different with and without the ATA. The MAmax of both suprahyoid and masseter muscles and the TPmax were significantly greater, and TLM-TPmax was significantly longer when swallowing corned beef than other materials (p&lt;0.05). The intermaxillar distance and the range of measured mandibular position at the time of swallowing were shorter and wider in the absence of the ATA than with it. CONCLUSION: The present study shows that during swallowing the ATA supports the function of the tongue to perform skillful movements for the smooth passage of food to the oropharynx and the elevation of the larynx by maintaining the mandible position constant near the intercuspal position.",M1
19810607,"Clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of larynx in myasthenia gravis.OBJECTIVES: We investigated the clinical and electrophysiological characteristics of the larynx in patients with myasthenia gravis (MG). METHODS: Thirty-two cases of MG were analyzed. The <e>laryngeal</e> behaviors and characteristics of laryngeal electromyography were evaluated, and voice assessment and repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) tests were conducted. RESULTS: The initial symptoms of patients were ptosis and/or diplopia in 28, dysphagia and slurred speech in 3, and limb weakness in 1. Only 8 patients had slight hoarseness and vocal fatigue, and 4 patients had positive laryngeal signs. When compared with normal subjects, the patients with MG had worse results on the acoustic analysis of shimmer, their normalized noise energy was greater, and the harmonics-to-noise ratio and maximum phonation time were significantly lower. The RNS findings were positive in 28 patients and negative in 4 patients. The average (+/-SD) amplitude decrement was 31.9% +/- 19.1%. The mean number of involved laryngeal muscles was 2.22 +/- 1.35. Cricothyroid muscles were involved in 26 cases, thyroarytenoid muscles were involved in 14 cases, posterior cricoarytenoid muscles were involved in 6 cases, and lateral cricoarytenoid muscles were involved in 2 cases. CONCLUSIONS: Although few patients presented with laryngeal symptoms as their initial symptoms, most patients with MG exhibited asymmetry and abnormal findings on laryngeal electromyography. The RNS test for laryngeal muscles is a more sensitive indicator for the diagnosis of MG, especially in the cricothyroid muscle.",M1

19793279,"<e>Laryngeal</e> epithelial thickness: a comparison between optical coherence tomography and histology.OBJECTIVES: Optical coherence tomography, an imaging modality using near-infrared light, produces cross-sectional tissue images with a lateral pixel resolution of 10 microm. However, normative data is first needed on epithelial thickness for lesion characterisation, and, to date, little exists. The purpose of our study is to measure normal laryngeal epithelial thickness by in vivo optical coherence tomography, and compare these values to those obtained from fixed ex-vivo laryngectomy specimens. DESIGN AND SETTING: Prospective at a single medical center in California, United States. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 116 patients undergoing operative endoscopy. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Optical coherence tomography images of clinically normal laryngeal subsites were selected. Calibrated measurements of epithelial thickness at various laryngeal subsites were recorded. Measurements of epithelial thickness from corresponding areas were obtained using optical micrometry on histologically normal regions of 15 total laryngectomy specimens. Descriptive statistics were performed. RESULTS: Mean epithelial optical coherence tomography thicknesses were: true vocal cords (81 microm), false vocal cords (78 microm), subglottis (61 microm), aryepiglottic folds (111 microm), laryngeal epiglottis (116 microm) and lingual epiglottis (170 microm). Epithelial thicknesses in fixed tissues were: true vocal cords (103 microm), false vocal cords (79 microm), aryepiglottic folds (205 microm) subglottis (61 microm), laryngeal epiglottis (38 microm) and lingual epiglottis (130 microm). CONCLUSIONS: Optical coherence tomography does not have the artifacts associated with conventional histologic techniques. The inevitable development of office-based optical coherence tomography devices will increase the precision of laryngeal measurements and contribute to the clinical application of this technology in diagnosing laryngeal disease.",M1
19788033,"Radiographic quantification of tracheal dimensions of the normal Thoroughbred horse.Radiographic measurement of tracheal dimensions in the horse may be useful in evaluating upper and lower respiratory tract conditions due to the gradient of pressure changes between these areas. Lateral radiographs of the trachea of 15 normal sedated Thoroughbred horses were made at inspiration and expiration and magnification-corrected mean airway heights measured were, respectively: larynx: 5.89 and 5.86 cm; trachea at the third cervical vertebra (C3): 4.17 and 4.04cm; at the fifth cervical vertebra (C5): 3.62 and 3.59 cm; at the first thoracic vertebra (T1): 3.4 and 3.23cm; and carina: 3.85 and 4.12 cm. The ratio of airway height to nearby vertebral body lengths, at inspiration and expiration were, respectively: <e>laryngeal</e> height at C3: 0.56 and 0.56; tracheal height at C3: 0.4 and 0.39; at C5: 0.37 and 0.37; at T1: 0.59 and 0.59; and carina height: 0.91 and 0.94. The ratio of tracheal height to the thoracic inlet at inspiration and expiration was, respectively, 0.15 and 0.15. There was not a statistically significant association between airway diameter and phase of respiration. No association was found between tracheal height and body mass or height at the withers. Radiographic tracheal height can be measured independent of respiratory phase in sedated horses. It is suggested that the ratio of tracheal height to an adjacent bony landmark is more reliable for comparison between horses and tracheal height measurement should be made at C5, due to a lower standard deviation. If only thoracic radiographs are made, measurements of tracheal height at the thoracic inlet may be valuable.",M1
19787239,"Let-7a microRNA functions as a potential tumor suppressor in human <e>laryngeal</e> cancer.MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenously expressed non-coding RNAs, which are involved in the gene expression regulation. Lethal-7a (let-7a) is a founding member of miRNA family and recently it was found to be associated with several cancers, such as lung and colon cancers. In the present study, we found that let-7a miRNA expression was significantly downregulated both in human laryngeal squamous cancer tissues and in Hep-2 cells, a laryngeal cancer cell line, as compared with adjacent normal tissues and BEAS-2B cells, respectively. Moreover, we found that let-7a expression levels were significantly further decreased in non-differentiated (G3) cancer tissues as compared with moderately and well differentiated cancer tissues (G2 and G1), although no significant difference in let-7a expression levels between the cancer specimens with different T stages or specimens from patients with different lymph node metastasis status was revealed. In Hep-2 cells, let-7a mimics transfection markedly suppressed proliferation and induced apoptosis of Hep-2 cells under the treatment of diamminedichloroplatinum or not and downregulated RAS and c-MYC protein expression without affecting the mRNA levels. In parallel, RAS and c-MYC protein levels were found significantly upregulated only in cancer tissues with downregulated let-7a expression. Thus, we propose that let-7a may be a tumor suppressor in laryngeal cancer by inhibiting cell growth, inducing cell apoptosis and downregulating the oncogenes expression.",M1
19786222,"Proposal for staging airway hemangiomas.OBJECTIVE: To describe a method of airway infantile hemangioma staging using standardized assessment of airway narrowing, and hemangioma location and volume, as determined with endoscopy and CT angiography. STUDY DESIGN: Case series with chart review. SETTING: Tertiary pediatric hospital, 2003-2008. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Subjects included airway hemangioma patients evaluated at a tertiary pediatric hospital. Data collected were age at first symptoms, diagnostic evaluation, percent airway compromise, and estimated hemangioma volume. Data were analyzed with descriptive and Fisher exact statistics. RESULTS: Twelve patients were identified and seven had complete data sets. Mean age at first symptoms was 1.9 months (SD 1.09 months, range 0.5-4 months). Evaluation consisted of nasopharyngoscopy, microlaryngoscopy, CT angiography, and/or MRI. Mean <e>laryngeal</e> airway narrowing was estimated at 63.75 percent (SD 19.0%, range 40%-90%). Total hemangioma volume was less in patients with isolated (focal) endolaryngeal hemangiomas compared with airway hemangiomas associated with extralaryngeal (segmental) hemangiomas. Airway hemangioma stages were stage one (5 of 12; 41.6%), stage two (6 of 12; 50.0%), and stage three (1 of 12; 8.3%). CONCLUSION: This method of airway hemangioma staging may be applicable to treatment planning and used to measure treatment outcomes.",M1
19782550,"Exercise induced dyspnea in the young. Larynx as the bottleneck of the airways.BACKGROUND: Exercise induced asthma may symptomatically be difficult to differentiate from exercise related obstruction in the upper airways, sometimes leading to diagnostic confusion and inappropriate treatment. Larynx accounts for a significant fraction of total airway resistance, but its role as a limiting factor for airflow during exercise has been hampered by lack of diagnostic tools. We aimed to study <e>laryngeal</e> function in exercising humans by transnasal laryngoscopy. METHODS: Continuous video recording of the larynx was performed in parallel with continuous film recording of the upper part of the body and recording of breath sounds in subjects running to respiratory distress or exhaustion on a treadmill. RESULTS: A successful examination was obtained in 20 asymptomatic volunteers and 151 (91%) of 166 young patients with a history of inspiratory distress or stridor during exercise. At rest, six patients had abnormal laryngeal findings. During exercise, a moderate or severe adduction of laryngeal structures was observed in parallel with increasing inspiratory distress in 113 (75%) patients. In 109 of these, adduction started within supraglottic structures, followed by adduction of the vocal cords in 88. In four patients, laryngeal adduction started in the vocal cords, involving supraglottic structures secondarily in three. CONCLUSION: Larynx can safely be studied throughout a maximum intensity exercise treadmill test. A characteristic laryngeal response pattern to exercise was visualised in a large proportion of patients with suspected upper airway obstruction. Laryngoscopy during ongoing symptoms is recommended for proper assessment of these patients.",M1

METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty-eight patients were considered for this study who met the following criteria: (1) grossly uninvolved larynx, (2) no prior major surgery except for neck dissection and tonsillectomy, (3) at least one fiberoptic examination of the larynx within 2 years from radiotherapy, (4) minimum follow-up of 15 months. Larynx dose-volume histograms (DVHs) were corrected into a linear quadratic equivalent one at 2 Gy/fr with alpha/beta = 3 Gy. Subacute/late edema was prospectively scored at each follow-up examination according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group scale. G2-G3 edema within 15 months from RT was considered as our endpoint. Two NTCP models were considered: (1) the Lyman model with DVH reduced to the equivalent uniform dose (EUD; LEUD) and (2) the Logit model with DVH reduced to the EUD (LOGEUD). The parameters for the models were fit to patient data using a maximum likelihood analysis. RESULTS: All patients had a minimum of 15 months follow-up (only 8/48 received concurrent chemotherapy): 25/48 (52.1%) experienced G2-G3 edema. Both NTCP models fit well the clinical data: with LOGEUD the relationship between EUD and NTCP can be described with TD50 = 46.7 +/- 2.1 Gy, n = 1.41 +/- 0.8 and a steepness parameter k = 7.2 +/- 2.5 Gy. Best fit parameters for LEUD are n = 1.17 +/- 0.6, m = 0.23 +/- 0.07 and TD50 = 47.3 +/- 2.1 Gy. CONCLUSIONS: A clear volume effect was found for edema, consistent with a parallel architecture of the larynx for this endpoint. On the basis of our findings, an EUD &lt;30-35 Gy should drastically reduce the risk of G2-G3 edema.",M1

We compared the effect of esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily (b.i.d.) vs placebo on voice and acoustic-related measures in patients with LPR. METHODS: Patients with LPR underwent endoscopy and pH testing. Subsequently, patients underwent videostroboscopic recordings of the larynx, acoustic voice and speech analysis. A voice use and quality diary and oesophageal symptom diary were completed at baseline. Thereafter, patients were randomized to esomeprazole 20 mg twice daily vs placebo for 3 months. The voice use and quality diary and oesophageal symptom dairy were repeated during the last week of treatment. Videostroboscopy and acoustic voice and speech analysis were also performed at the end of treatment. KEY RESULTS: Twenty-four patients were randomized to the esomeprazole group and 17 to the placebo group. There was no significant difference in videostroboscopic reflux finding scores from baseline to post-treatment. Acoustic measures also failed to demonstrate significant differences within the same or between groups, even when a sub-group analysis of patients with endoscopically documented oesophageal inflammation at baseline was performed. Additionally, no significant differences were found between groups when using voice use and quality diary. CONCLUSIONS &amp; INFERENCES: Use of more specific <e>laryngeal</e> functional parameters such as voice-related acoustic measures of pitch range, fundamental frequency and intensity also failed to demonstrate a significant response to proton pump inhibitor treatment as compared to placebo in patients with suspected LPR.",M1
19708903,"Diagnosis of vocal cord dysfunction in asthma with high resolution dynamic volume computerized tomography of the larynx.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Vocal cord dysfunction (VCD) often masquerades as asthma and reports have suggested that up to 30% of patients with asthma may have coexistent VCD. Diagnosis of VCD is difficult, in part because it involves laryngoscopy which has practical constraints, and there is need for rapid non-invasive diagnosis. High speed 320-slice volume CT demonstrates <e>laryngeal</e> function during inspiration and expiration and may be useful in suspected VCD. METHODS: Endoscopy and high resolution 320-slice dynamic volume CT were used to examine and compare laryngeal anatomy and movement in a case of subglottic stenosis and in a patient with confirmed VCD. Nine asthmatics with ongoing symptoms and suspected VCD also underwent 320-slice dynamic volume CT. Tracheal and laryngeal anatomy and movement were evaluated and luminal areas were measured. Reductions in vocal cord luminal area &gt;40%, lasting for &gt;70% duration of inspiration/expiration, were judged to be consistent with VCD. RESULTS: Studies of subglottic tracheal stenosis validated anatomical similarities between endoscopy and CT images. Endoscopy and 320-slice volume CT also provided comparable dynamic images in a patient with confirmed VCD. A further nine patients with a history of severe asthma and suspected VCD were studied using CT. Four patients had evidence of VCD and the median reduction of luminal area during expiration was 78.2% (range 48.2-92.5%) compared with 10.4% (range 4.7-30%) in the five patients without VCD. Patients with VCD had no distinguishing clinical characteristics. CONCLUSIONS: Dynamic volume CT provided explicit images of the larynx, distinguished function of the vocal cords during the respiratory cycle and could identify putative VCD. The technique will potentially provide a simple, non-invasive investigation to identify laryngeal dysfunction, permitting improved management of asthma.",M1
19707144,"The usefulness of the <e>laryngeal</e> mask airway Fastrach for laryngeal surgery.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Suspension laryngoscopy under general anaesthesia with a tracheal tube has been widely used for laryngeal microsurgery, but it has some limitations such as intense cardiovascular stimulation during anaesthesia of short duration, occasionally a poor surgical field, and the possibility of a mass being hampered by the tracheal tube. The aim of this study was to compare the usefulness of the laryngeal mask airway (LMA) Fastrach and fibreoptic bronchoscope with a conventional suspension laryngoscope in laryngeal microsurgery. METHODS: Forty patients scheduled for laryngeal microsurgery were enrolled in this prospective randomized study consecutively. After general anaesthesia was induced, laryngeal microsurgery was performed with a fibreoptic bronchoscope through the LMA Fastrach or conventional suspension laryngoscope. The best view of the surgical field, evaluated by percentage of glottic opening score, was obtained by the up-down manipulations of the LMA Fastrach or repositioning the suspension laryngoscope. Blood pressure and heart rate changes at the baseline, preinsertion, and postinsertion were recorded. RESULTS: Percentage of glottic opening score of the LMA Fastrach group was 100 and that of the suspension laryngoscope group was 80 (P &lt; 0.05). The LMA Fastrach insertion was performed without remarkable systolic or diastolic blood pressure or heart rate changes, but systolic, diastolic blood pressure or heart rate were increased after intubation in the suspension laryngoscope group. CONCLUSION: The LMA Fastrach during fibreoptic bronchoscope-guided laryngeal surgery provided a good surgical field and haemodynamic stability without additional risk compared with the conventional suspension laryngoscope.",M1
19699044,"Study of endolaryngeal structures by videolaryngoscopy after hanging: a new approach to understanding the physiopathogenesis.PURPOSE: To evaluate laryngoscopic findings in hanging cases and to compare them with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and forensic autopsy results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Postmortem nasolaryngofibroscopy and MRI of five people who died from hanging were performed. Three people who died from other causes than hanging were also examined with a flexible laryngofibroscope. The results were compared with injuries discovered during forensic autopsy. RESULTS: In all five hanging cases, laryngofibroscopic investigation showed a vocal fold position in complete adduction confirmed by MRI. This position did not seem to be influenced by the intensity of the forces applied to neck or postmortem delay and cadaveric phenomena. The vocal cords of the three non-hanging deceased were found in the intermediate position. These findings could suggest that pressure applied to the cervical nervous and cartilaginous structures or their elongation during hanging could lead to closure of the glottis with vocal cord adduction maintained after death. CONCLUSION: Laryngofibroscopic examination in hanging cases could be very useful in confirming the vital character of the hanging and understanding asphyxial phenomena in incomplete suspension without <e>laryngeal</e> crush.",M1

The protocol consisted of sagittal and transverse T2-weighted (T2w) fast spin echo, transverse T1-weighted (T1w) spin echo, and dorsal high-resolution T1w gradient echo (both pre- and postcontrast enhancement) sequences. Euthanasia was performed at the end of the imaging procedure. Macroscopic anatomy of the cadaver sections were compared with the MR images in transverse, midsagittal, and parasagittal planes. There was good differentiation of anatomic structures, including soft tissues. The laryngeal cartilages, hyoid apparatus, and upper airway muscle groups with their attachments could be clearly identified. However, it was not always possible to delineate individual muscles in each plane. Most useful were both T2w and T1w transverse sequences. Intravenous application of contrast medium was helpful to identify blood vessels. The MR images corresponded with the macroscopic anatomy of cadaver sections.",M1
19688842,"Phonation threshold pressure estimation using electroglottography in an airflow redirection system.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: The present study proposed to estimate phonation threshold pressure (PTP) noninvasively using airflow redirection into a pneumatic capacitance system. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study. METHODS: Subjects phonated into the device, which interrupts airflow mechanically and redirects the flow into a pneumatic capacitor. Five interruptions were effected per trial. PTP was estimated as the difference between subglottal pressure (SGP) and transglottal pressure at phonation offset. The novel method was tested for consistency in 20 normal human subjects at low (75 dB) and high (85 dB) sound pressure levels. The device was tested for validity on a tracheotomy patient. RESULTS: Mean SGP was 9.02 +/- 3.27 cm H(2)O, and mean PTP was 3.68 +/- 1.41 cm H(2)O. Intrasubject coefficient of variation, a measure of intrasubject consistency, was 0.33 +/- 0.23. Statistically significant differences existed between the means of SGP but not PTP at 75 dB and 85 dB. The correlation coefficient between accepted and experimental SGP in a tracheotomy patient was 0.947 (P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Measurements corresponded well to previously reported values, and intrasubject variability was low, indicating the device was consistent. Testing on a tracheotomy patient demonstrated validity. More research is needed to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the device in differentiating between normal and pathological voices. This device may have clinical application as a noninvasive and reliable method of estimating PTP and indicating that <e>laryngeal</e> health is likely abnormal.",M1

GA with ET was found to be better for JO-RRP patients with dyspnoea, as it provided better stabilization of the vital signs with fewer postoperative complications. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the safety and efficacy of two different anaesthetic techniques in the removal of JO-RRP. METHODS: A total of 52 JO-RRP patients with mild dyspnoea were included in the study. Each case underwent two procedures, one by IVGA and the other by GA with ET. A total of 104 procedures were performed. The effectiveness and safety of the two anaesthetic techniques were pairwise compared. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in anaesthetic recovery time, operative time or postoperative voice quality between the two anaesthetic groups. However, significant differences in heart rate, oxygen saturation and carbon dioxide saturation were observed. Some patients who underwent IVGA developed apnoea (28.8%) and <e>laryngeal</e> spasm (19.2%). These complications were not observed in the GA with ET group.",M1

For in-depth, immunology-based transplantation research, however, a thoroughly studied animal model must exist. The purpose of this study was to develop a reliable surgical technique in mice to serve as a model for further study of laryngeal transplantation. METHODS: Heterotopic laryngeal transplantation was attempted in 15 immunocompetent mice by use of modifications of previously described techniques established in rats. RESULTS: Various microvascular techniques were used that led to 8 successful transplants (of 15) with patent vascularity at the time of sacrifice. The first 7 attempts at transplantation were unsuccessful because of technical difficulties related to vessel size, soft tissue traumatic injury, and venous congestion. Subsequently, 8 transplantation procedures were successfully performed after modifications of the surgical technique. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study describes the reproducible surgical techniques performed in using mice for studying laryngeal transplantation. Mice are cost-effective and immunologically well studied, and are thus ideal for further laryngeal transplantation research.",M1

19593285,"A short perspective on the surgical restoration of alaryngeal speech.Despite advances in conservative <e>laryngeal</e> surgery and radiotherapy, total laryngectomy still remains the procedure of choice for advanced-stage laryngeal carcinoma around the world. The loss of natural voice is very often traumatic for the total laryngectomy patient, presenting lifelong challenges for communication in a world that relies heavily on verbal communication. Functional rehabilitation of these patients has long been one of the major challenges facing clinicians, but it is only in the last three decades that the emphasis on restoration of function and quality of life has become almost as important as cure and survival. Although voice restoration for alaryngeal speakers can be attained with any of 3 speech options - esophageal speech, electrolarynx and surgical voice restoration (SVR) using a valve the SVR technique has today become the preferred method and 'gold standard.' Successful tracheo-esophageal voice restoration in laryngectomy patients can be very rewarding, and patients are no longer condemned to silence while they await the results of their cancer treatments. They can face the challenges of life with the knowledge that a near-normal quality of life is very much possible.",M2
19565394,"The voice handicap index with post-laryngectomy male voices.BACKGROUND: Surgical treatment for advanced <e>laryngeal</e> cancer involves complete removal of the larynx ('laryngectomy') and initial total loss of voice. Post-laryngectomy rehabilitation involves implementation of different means of 'voicing' for these patients wherever possible. There is little information about laryngectomees' perception of their changed voice quality and communication status. Surgical voice restoration (SVR) has become the 'gold standard' rehabilitation, but there continue to be patients who use other methods of communication. There is no clear evidence comparing patients' perception of their voice handicap across different types of alaryngeal communication. AIMS: To compare the self-assessed vocal handicap of laryngectomees using SVR with those using non-SVR methods of post-laryngectomy communication. METHODS &amp; PROCEDURES: Potential participants were identified from one Head and Neck cancer centre in South Wales. They included both male and female participants using all methods of post-laryngectomy communication. Each patient's Voice Handicap Index (VHI) score, sub-set scores, and group means were calculated. Two major confounding factors: age and time since surgery, and communication method (SVR/non-SVR), were considered to identify factors, other than method of communication, which may influence rehabilitation outcomes. OUTCOMES &amp; RESULTS: A total of 71 questionnaires were sent out and 62 (82%) were returned from 35 patients who had undergone SVR and 27 patients who used non-SVR methods of communication. Of the non-SVR group, twelve used oesophageal voice, eleven an electrolarynx, two writing and two mouthing for communication. The gender ratio (53:9), age (43-90 years) and time since surgery (1-40 years) were broadly representative of this population, but because of the small number of females, we excluded the women from further analysis. Individual VHI scores ranged from 4 to 106. Both the SVR and non-SVR group mean scores: 44.7 and 50.9, were within the range of moderately severe voice handicap. There was no significant difference between the groups for total VHI scores or two of the three sub-domains, nor any significant effect on voice handicap due to the confounding factors assessed: age or time since surgery. The total VHI score was better by 6.5 ( - 4.9 to 17.9) points in the SVR group (p = 0.3), probably reflecting the literature reporting superior voice in SVR. CONCLUSIONS &amp; IMPLICATIONS: The data suggest that where patient-assessed quality of life is concerned, SVR and non-SVR outcomes are comparable. This is an important consideration when planning and carrying out treatment recommendations. The study has clear clinical implications; understanding the potential of all methods of post-laryngectomy communication is essential for holistic patient management.",M2
19507224,"Evaluation of voice prosthesis placement at the time of primary tracheoesophageal puncture with total laryngectomy.OBJECTIVES/HYPOTHESIS: Primary tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) is a well-described and accepted method of surgical voice restoration and is standardly completed with a catheter placement intraoperatively, which is replaced with a prosthesis at a later date. This study evaluates the intraoperative placement of the voice prosthesis at the time of the primary TEP in an effort to understand the potential advantages and disadvantages of voice prosthesis placement at the time of primary TEP completed in conjunction with total laryngectomy. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective chart review within an academic medical center. METHODS: After approval by the institutional review board of the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary, a retrospective chart review was completed of all cases of primary tracheoesophageal prosthesis placement completed in conjunction with primary tracheoesophageal puncture performed at the time of total laryngectomy. RESULTS: Thirty patients were identified, 29 of whom underwent laryngectomy for advanced <e>laryngeal</e> carcinoma. Twenty-eight of 29 patients received preoperative full-dose radiation therapy. Twenty-nine of 30 patients had a 20F classic Indwelling Blom-Singer prosthesis (InHealth Technologies, Carpinteria, CA) placed. One had placement of 16F Indwelling Blom-Singer prosthesis. No complications were noted with intraoperative prosthesis placement. No prostheses were dislodged in the postoperative period. Twenty-nine of 30 subjects had initial success with tracheoesophageal voice production. At 1-year follow-up, 23/30 subjects (77%) had successful voice restoration. Five failed because of recurrent disease, one subject never achieved successful voice, and one subject wanted the prosthesis removed although successful voice was achieved. Twenty-three of 25 (92%) disease-free subjects had functional voice restoration at 1-year post-total laryngectomy and primary prosthesis placement. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the voice prosthesis can be safely and effectively placed intraoperatively at the time of primary TEP and laryngectomy. Initial voice acquisition rates were high and long-term success was well within the acceptable range.",M2
19299898,"An acoustical and perceptual study of vowels produced by alaryngeal speakers of Cantonese.OBJECTIVE: The present study determines the acoustical and perceptual differences between alaryngeal and <e>laryngeal</e> speakers of Cantonese in the production of Cantonese vowels. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Formant frequencies (F1 and F2) associated with eight Cantonese vowels [see text] produced by 40 alaryngeal (10 esophageal, 10 tracheoesophageal, 10 with pneumatic artificial larynx, 10 electrolaryngeal) and 10 laryngeal speakers were obtained. To assess how formants affect vowel perception, the vowels were identified by 20 naïve listeners, based on which confusion matrices were established. RESULTS: Spectral analysis revealed that F1 and F2 values of Cantonese vowels produced by the alaryngeal speakers were significantly higher than those produced by laryngeal speakers, with the exception of F2 of [see text], /i/ and /y/ produced by alaryngeal speakers using pneumatic artificial larynx, and [see text] produced by electrolaryngeal speakers. CONCLUSION: The acoustic findings suggest a general shortening of the effective vocal tract length for resonance in alaryngeal speakers after laryngectomy. Percent correct identification of vowels from the perceptual experiment indicated similar error patterns in vowel identification between alaryngeal and laryngeal speaker groups. Among the different alaryngeal speaker groups, naïve listeners tended to perceive the vowels produced by electrolaryngeal speakers more accurately.",M2
19261410,"Long-term average spectral characteristics of Cantonese alaryngeal speech.OBJECTIVE: In Hong Kong, esophageal (SE), tracheoesophageal (TE), electrolaryngeal (EL), and pneumatic artificial <e>laryngeal</e> (PA) speech are commonly used by laryngectomees as a means to regain verbal communication after total laryngectomy. While SE and TE speech has been studied to some extent, little is known regarding the EL and PA sound quality. The present study examined the sound quality associated with SE, TE, EL, and PA speech, and compared with that associated with laryngeal (NL) speech by using long-term average speech spectra (LTAS). METHODS: Continuous speech samples of reading a 136-word passage were obtained from NL, SE, TE, EL, and PA speakers of Cantonese. The alaryngeal speakers were all superior speakers selected from the New Voice Club of Hong Kong, which is a self-help organization for the laryngectomees in Hong Kong. TE speakers were fitted with Provox valve, and EL speakers used Servox-type electrolarynx. Speech samples were digitized at 20kHz and 16bits/sample by using Praat, based on which LTAS contours were developed. First spectral peak (FSP), mean spectral energy (MSE), and spectral tilt (ST) derived from the LTAS contours associated with different speaker groups were compared. RESULTS: Data revealed all speakers generally exhibited similar LTA contours. However, PA speakers exhibited the lowest average FSP value and the greatest average MSE value. NL phonation was associated with a significantly greater ST value than alaryngeal speech of Cantonese. CONCLUSION: The differences in FSP, MSE, and ST values in different speaker groups may be related to the different sound sources being used by the laryngectomees, and the difference in the way the sound source is coupled with the vocal tract system.",M2
19233382,"Electromyographic control of a hands-free electrolarynx using neck strap muscles.Three individuals with total laryngectomy were studied for their ability to control a hands-free electrolarynx (EL) using neck surface electromyography (EMG) for on/off and pitch modulation. The laryngectomy surgery of participants was modified to preserve neck strap musculature for EMG-based EL control (EMG-EL), with muscles on one side maintaining natural innervation and those on the other side receiving a transferred recurrent <e>laryngeal</e> nerve (RLN). EMG from each side of the neck controlled the EMG-EL across a day of unstructured practice followed by a day of formal training, including EMG biofeedback. Using either control source, participants spoke intelligibly and fluently with the EMG-EL before formal training. This good initial performance did not consistently improve across testing for either control source in terms of voice timing, speech intelligibility, fluency, and intonation of interrogative versus declarative sentences. Neck strap muscles have activation patterns capable of simple alaryngeal voice control without requiring RLN transfer. LEARNING OUTCOMES: The reader will better understand (1) functionality of the hands-free electrolarynx (2) modification of laryngectomy surgery to preserve neck strap musculature and (3) performance of hands-free electrolarynx with different control sources.",M2
19189337,"Playing a brass instrument after total laryngectomy: a case report.BACKGROUND: A brass instrument is a musical instrument in which the tone is produced by vibration of the lips as the player blows into a tubular resonator. The case of a professional brass player who continued his activity after total laryngectomy, with insertion of a voice prosthesis in a tracheoesophageal shunt, is reported. METHODS: A videoendoscopic and videofluoroscopic study of the patient during brass playing was conducted. RESULTS: A nonvibrating, open neoglottis during brass playing was found on videoendoscopy. Videofluorography revealed an enlarged hypopharynx, a thick neoglottis while playing at lower tone; at higher pitch the tongue base was retracted, the neoglottis was thin and stretched, and the subneoglottic area was extremely enlarged. CONCLUSION: The case reported shows that the insertion of a voice prosthesis in a tracheoesophageal shunt seems to create a regulating airflow system sufficiently advanced to play a brass instrument, further reducing the disability of <e>laryngeal</e> speakers.",M2
19148810,"Quality of 'glottal' stops in tracheoesophageal speakers.Glottal stops are conveyed by an abrupt constriction at the level of the glottis. Tracheoesophageal (TE) speakers are known to have poor control over the new voice source (neoglottis), and this might influence the production of 'glottal' stops. This study investigated how TE speakers realized 'glottal' stops in abutting words that end and begin with the same vowel. Ten phoneticians rated seven TE speakers' attempts to convey 'glottal' stops less favourably than two <e>laryngeal</e> control speakers' 'glottal' stops. Acoustic analyses showed that TE speakers relied on more gradual changes, but in 25% of realizations, a constriction at the neoglottis, similar to the constriction found in normal speakers, was produced. It was concluded that control over the neoglottis might be greater than is generally assumed. It might be possible to improve TE speakers' awareness and control over the neoglottis through training, using such tools as digital high-speed imaging.",M2
19052392,"Current status and future prospects in prosthetic voice rehabilitation following laryngectomy.Total laryngectomy or laryngopharyngectomy remains the procedure of choice for advanced-stage (UICC T3 and T4) <e>laryngeal</e> carcinoma around the world despite advances in conservative laryngeal surgery and radiotherapy. However, it has profound effects on respiration and deglutition, in addition to the most disabling effect-the loss of verbal communication. Successful voice restoration can be attained with any of three speech options, namely esophageal speech, electrolarynx, and tracheoesophageal (TO) speech using an artificial valve. Although, no single method is considered the best for every patient, the tracheoesophageal puncture has become the preferred method in the past decade. Several types of voice prostheses have been produced since the first prosthesis was introduced in 1980 by Blom and Singer. However, eventually all prostheses are confronted by the same problem, i.e., the development of a biofilm, leading to deterioration and ultimately to dysfunction of the prostheses, necessitating replacement. This article attempts to sum up the historical background as well as the current state of surgical voice rehabilitation following laryngectomy; we review the recent major advances as well as the future prospects. Data was collected by conducting a computer-aided search of the MEDLINE and PubMed databases, supplemented by hand searches of key journals. Over 50 articles published in the last three decades on the topic have been reviewed, out of which about 20 were found to be of relevance for this article.",M2
19024218,"Voice restoration after total laryngectomy using provox 2 (generation II) prosthesis.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Voice restoration after total laryngectomy is of outmost importance for patient and a therapeutic challenge for the surgeon and speech pathologist. Among various rehabilitation methods prosthetic voice yields nowadays the best results. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 12 patients underwent laryngectomy at the Department of Otorhinolaryngology, University Hospital, Patras, Greece, between February 2006 and May 2007. All patients had advanced <e>laryngeal</e> squamous cell carcinoma. Eight patients had primary voice prosthesis inserted and four patients had a tracheo-esophageal puncture (TEP) carried out as a secondary procedure. RESULTS: The majority of the patients (80%) from both the primary insertion or the secondary insertion group, developed good and understood speech using the prosthesis. No significant difference in quality of speech was found between the two subgroups. Four patients required replacement of the prosthesis at intervals of 8 and 10 months after insertion, because of salivary leakage and granulation formation around the fistula, while 3 patients developed a mild mucositis and tracheitis due to postoperative radiotherapy. DISCUSSION: TEP puncture and prosthesis insertion is a relatively simple, safe and effective surgical procedure for voice restoration after laryngectomy. Provox 2 (generation II) voice prosthesis is a new and useful modified device that has overcome the previous prosthesis drawbacks, is well tolerated by the patients and can be easily changed via the front-loading technique.",M2
18656722,"Comparison of voice outcomes after radial forearm free flap reconstruction versus primary closure after laryngectomy.OBJECTIVE: Laryngectomy with primary closure and tracheoesophageal prosthesis (TEP) voice rehabilitation has been the mainstay of the management of patients with advanced <e>laryngeal</e> malignancy. When adequate mucosal tissue is not available, pharyngeal reconstruction with free flaps can be utilized. The speech outcomes of these patients have been traditionally considered inferior based on the findings of a limited number of studies. We report the results of a review of our experience with radial forearm free flap (RFFF) reconstruction of extensive laryngopharyngectomy defects vs our institutional outcomes seen with primary closure. STUDY DESIGN: Retrospective review. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: All patients treated with laryngectomy procedures with either primary closure (28 patients) or RFFF (20 patients) reconstructions at the Cleveland Clinic from 2002 through 2007 were included. Blinded evaluation with statistical analysis of standard speech outcomes measures (maximal sustained phonation, fluent count) as well as qualitative variables are reported. RESULTS: Based on our data collection, the two groups are statistically indistinguishable. CONCLUSIONS: These findings support the utility and effectiveness of the RFFF in pharyngeal reconstruction in achieving good voice outcomes.",M2

18003196,"Development of a wearable electro-larynx for laryngectomees and its evaluation.An electro-larynx is one of speech-substitute devices for patients who have lost <e>laryngeal</e> function. Unfortunately, the voices produced by a conventional electro-larynx are completely flat, unlike a human voice. In order to improve it, we developed a pitch-controlled electro-larynx that allows patients to control a voice intonation using their exhalation. The pitch-controlled electro-larynx has been manufactured in Japan and about 3500 patients have used the device since 1998. However, most patients have strongly requested a further advanced electro-larynx so that they can use it without their hands occupied. We designed a wearable electro-larynx so that it contributes to increase their quality of life. The new electro-larynx can be attached to the patient's neck using a thermo-plastic brace on which a thin-vibrator can be mounted. In this report, we mentioned how to design the wearable electro-larynx and the new electro-larynx was evaluated from a view-point of its sound quality and the usability. Although our wearable electro-larynx has not yet been equipped with the pitch-control function, it was ascertained that it works well while the users are moving their head in the various direction.",M2
17959326,"Vocal efficiency in tracheoesophageal phonation.OBJECTIVE: Voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy is challenging. In order to investigate and understand the function of the neoglottis sophisticated measurements need to be made. During voice production, aerodynamic energy is transformed into sound energy. In non-laryngectomized patients, the voice production efficiency is called the vocal efficiency. Vocal efficiency is an indication of how efficient the transformation of energy takes place. Vocal efficiency is calculated by dividing the output sound power by the aerodynamic power. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In a group of eight laryngectomees with tracheoesophageal voice, we measured aerodynamic and acoustic quantities and calculated vocal efficiency. We used a computer setup with airflow transducers, pressure transducers, mikrotip transducers and sound intensity measurement to allow calculation of the needed parameters. RESULTS: The tables show the results of the power used and produced in various phonatory tasks. Relatively high levels of aerodynamic power are interpreted as increased effort to speak. CONCLUSION: The aerodynamic power is an indication of the effort needed for voice generation. The efficiency of TE-voice production is lower compared to <e>laryngeal</e> voice production but does show an increase when sound intensity increases, a known phenomenon in healthy laryngeal voice production.",M2
17600751,"Development of a (silent) speech recognition system for patients following laryngectomy.Surgical voice restoration post-laryngectomy has a number of limitations and drawbacks. The present gold standard involves the use of a tracheo-oesophageal fistula (TOF) valve to divert air from the lungs into the throat, which vibrates, and from this, speech can be formed. Not all patients can use these valves and those who do are susceptible to complications associated with valve failure. Thus there is still a place for other voice restoration options. With advances in electronic miniaturization and portable computing power a computing-intensive solution has been investigated. Magnets were placed on the lips, teeth and tongue of a volunteer causing a change in the surrounding magnetic field when the individual mouthed words. These changes were detected by 6 dual axis magnetic sensors, which were incorporated into a pair of special glasses. The resulting signals were compared to training data recorded previously by means of a dynamic time warping algorithm using dynamic programming. When compared to a small vocabulary database, the patterns were found to be recognised with an accuracy of 97% for words and 94% for phonemes. On this basis we plan to develop a speech system for patients who have lost <e>laryngeal</e> function.",M2

METHODS: This retrospective study reports information regarding pregnancy and birth history, family history, initial and delayed clinical features, treatment and follow-up of these infants. The following <e>laryngeal</e> procedures have been performed: Laser cordectomy (n=3), arytenoidopexy by external approach (n=2), botulinum toxin injection alone or associated with surgical treatments (n=6), enlargement laryngoplasty (n=1), endolaryngeal prostheses insertion (n=2). RESULTS: Any spontaneous recovery has been noticed. Four patients experiencing swallowing disorders required a gastrostomy in proportion to neurologic diseases and association of anomalies. Electromyograms performed were unremarkable. Botulinum toxin injected alone in laryngeal adductor muscles was not effective. The best results were observed when both arytenoidopexy and botulinum toxin injection were carried out. Bilateral cordectomies have been disappointing because of persistent vocal cord adduction. CONCLUSION: The low probability of spontaneous recovery and the drawbacks of tracheotomy encourage us to perform vocal cords adduction procedures as soon as possible.",M2
17490856,"Electroglottographic and perceptual evaluation of tracheoesophageal speech.To optimize tracheoesophageal (TO) speech after total laryngectomy, it is vital to have a robust tool of assessment to help investigate deficiencies, document changes, and facilitate therapy. We sought to evaluate and validate electroglottography (EGG) as an important tool in the multidimensional assessment of TO speech. This study is a cross-sectional study of the largest cohort of TO speakers treated by a single surgeon. A second group of normal <e>laryngeal</e> speakers served as a control group. EGG analysis of both groups using connected speech and sustained vowels was performed. Two trained expert raters undertook perceptual evaluation using two accepted scales. EGG measures were then analyzed for correlation with treatment variables. A separate correlation analysis was performed to identify EGG measures that may be associated with perceptual dimensions. Our data from EGG analysis are similar to data obtained from conventional acoustic signal analysis of TO speakers. Sustained vowel and connected speech parameters were poorer in TO speakers than in normal laryngeal speakers. In perceptual evaluation, only grade (G) of the GRBAS scale and Overall Voice Quality appeared reproducible and reliable. T stage, pharyngeal reconstruction and method of closure, cricopharyngeal myotomy, and postoperative complications appear to be correlated with the EGG measures. Five voice measures-jitter, shimmer, average frequency, normalized noise energy, and irregularity-correlated well with the key dimensions of perceptual assessment. EGG is an important assessment tool of TO speech, and can now be reliably used in a clinical setting.",M2
17487819,"[Chronic aspiration secondary to a Staffieri fistula: successful therapy with Provox voice prosthesis]BACKGROUND: The Staffieri technique is a method for surgical rehabilitation of the voice after laryngectomy. A fistula between trachea and esophagus is created to achieve a so-called  Neoglottis phonatoria . The assignment of the neoglottis is to protect the airways during ingestion and to give the patient a chance to phonate during expiration. PATIENT: The case of a 71-year-old man with aspiration via his Staffieri fistula is presented. The fistula was created in 1979 after laryngectomy because of a <e>laryngeal</e> carcinoma. He also suffered from a metastasized gastric carcinoma which was cured by a 2/3 resection of the stomach in 1970. He is free of recurrence with regard to his oncologic diseases. Until 2003 the patient had no problems with the fistula and was able to phonate well. In 2003 the patient had progressive aspiration via the fistula and the Staffieri fistula was therefore reduced in diameter by surgery. In 2005 the patient presented himself again because of a recurrence of the aspiration. Endoscopy of the upper aerodigestive tract showed healthy mucosa, contrast imaging of the esophagus showed a significant aspiration of the contrast medium into the trachea. Due to these findings a voice prosthesis was inserted into the fistula. This therapy cured the patient from aspiration. He is able to phonate well and has no further complaints. CONCLUSION: Aspiration via a Staffieri fistula is described in about 25 % of cases and therapy is sometimes difficult. Surgical narrowing of the diameter of the fistula is inadequate in most cases and many patients would lose their restored voice if the fistula was closed permanently. Through the insertion of a voice prosthesis aspiration could be stopped and voice was immediately restored.",M2
17239553,"Electrolarynx in voice rehabilitation.OBJECTIVE: Patients of <e>laryngeal</e> cancer who have undergone the surgical removal of the entire larynx suffer the loss of phonation. Electrolarynx (EL) speech is the most commonly adopted alaryngeal phonation. However, EL speech is notorious of the sound quality being monotonic and robotic with the lack of pitch control and the presence of the radiated noise. This paper provides a review of modalities in EL speech as well as introducing the technologies to control the pitch and reduce the noise of the device. METHODS: Improvements of EL speech quality have been divided into two parts: improving the sound quality of EL device by applying different enhancement algorithms to reduce the radiated and the additive noise, and implementing pitch-control function to the EL with advanced technology. RESULTS: Adaptive filtering and the subtractive-type algorithms have shown to be able to reduce the noise level associated with EL speech. And more mature technologies are showing promise to the making of a hand-free EL system producing more accurate and synchronized pitch and voice onset control. CONCLUSION: The advent of micro-technology and human-machine integration promisingly improves EL speech quality and more efficient algorithms enhance EL sound quality. Such improvements apparently improve the intelligibility of EL speech, and thus better quality of life of the EL speakers.",M2
17197503,"Reaction times of normal listeners to <e>laryngeal</e>, alaryngeal, and synthetic speech.The purpose of this study was to compare listener processing demands when decoding alaryngeal compared to laryngeal speech. Fifty-six listeners were presented with single words produced by 1 proficient speaker from 5 different modes of speech: normal, tracheosophageal (TE), esophageal (ES), electrolaryngeal (EL), and synthetic speech (SS). Cognitive processing load was indexed by listener reaction time (RT). To account for significant durational differences among the modes of speech, an RT ratio was calculated (stimulus duration divided by RT). Results indicated that the cognitive processing load was greater for ES and EL relative to normal speech. TE and normal speech did not differ in terms of RT ratio, suggesting fairly comparable cognitive demands placed on the listener. SS required greater cognitive processing load than normal and alaryngeal speech. The results are discussed relative to alaryngeal speech intelligibility and the role of the listener. Potential clinical applications and directions for future research are also presented.",M2

METHODS: Patients were evaluated with auto-evaluation scales: EORTC QLQ C30 dealing with common aspects affecting all patients with cancer, EORTC QLQ H&amp;N 35 dealing with characteristics more particular of cancers of head and neck and a scale of vocal handicap (VHI) to be able to compare quality of life and felt vocal handicap. We completed this study by a perceptive evaluation with the I(I)NFVo scale corresponding to the GRBAS for non-<e>laryngeal</e> voices. POPULATION: 37 subjects, 31 men (84%), 6 women (16%). average age: 60 years. 9 subjects implanted with a tracheo-oesophageal prosthesis (24%). Average post-operative period: 5 years. RESULTS: The quality of life among patients with TL is relatively well preserved, the principal complaint being in the social field. Neither the age, the sex, the post-operative period, nor the use of a tracheo-oesophageal voice (TOV) instead of an oro-oesophageal voice (OOV) seem to have an influence on the quality of life of the questioned patients. The results with the VHI show that only the post-operative period influences the vocal handicap. As for the perceptive analysis, only the postoperative period and the use of the TOV influence the scores. CONCLUSION: This study enabled us to note the absence of correlation between the quality of life, the vocal handicap, and the perceptive quality of the non-laryngeal voice. These scales are complementary tools and can constitute an invaluable help in the treatment of the TL thanks to simple methods (self-evaluation), which are standardized, reproducible, with an aim of assessment at the beginning or at the end of treatment, or to control and follow-up.",M2
17137738,"Voice rehabilitation with Provox2 voice prosthesis following total laryngectomy for <e>laryngeal</e> and hypopharyngeal carcinoma.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effectiveness of the Provox2 voice prosthesis for voice rehabilitation following total laryngectomy. METHODS: From September 2000 to December 2004, the Provox2 voice prosthesis was used for voice rehabilitation in 32 patients following total laryngectomy. The quality of speech with the Provox2 voice prosthesis was analyzed using the HRS rating scale, the maximum phonation time (MPT), incidence of complications and the in situ lifetime. The rate of speech restoration was further analyzed in 129 patients with total laryngectomy from 1996 to 2004. RESULT: Twenty-nine of 32 patients were able to restore speech using the Provox2 voice prosthesis, a speech restoration rate of 90.6%. The maximum phonation time (MPT) was measured in 18 patients using the Provox2 voice prosthesis. The mean MPT was 15.1 s, with a range of 8-28 s. MPT was not influenced by age, concurrent radiotherapy treatment, the location of the primary tumor or use of reconstructive surgery. The average lifetime of the Provox2 in patients with laryngeal carcinoma (12 patients) and hypopharyngeal carcinoma (17 patients) was 27.2 and 16.6 weeks, respectively, which was significantly different (P=0.024, non-parametric Mann-Whitney's U-test). The rate of speech restoration by the use of esophageal speech, and insertion of an artificial larynx was 62.7% for laryngeal carcinoma (59 cases) and 38.6% for hypopharyngeal carcinoma (70 cases), which was also significantly different (P&lt;0.01, chi-square test). CONCLUSION: Provox2 voice prosthesis speech was very useful due to the higher rate of speech restoration, longer phonatory time, and better intelligibility. It was also thought that voice prosthesis speech was useful in conjunction with esophageal speech and an artificial larynx depending on the patient's condition or wishes.",M2

Syllables /ma/ and /ba/ produced at four different tone levels by 8 normal laryngeal (NL), 7 standard esophageal (SE), and 8 electrolaryngeal (EL) speakers of Mandarin were perceived by 8 naïve listeners. Results from the listening experiments showed a higher percent correct identification of tone for NL speech than SE and EL speech. Perceptual data showed different patterns of tone confusion associated with the three types of speech. SE and EL speakers were not able to produce the four tone levels as accurately as were NL speakers. NL speakers achieved a near-perfect level of accuracy in signaling tonal contrasts. SE speakers produced the falling-rising and high-falling tones more accurately than high-level and mid-rising tones, but tonal confusions existed between mid-rising tone and falling-rising tone, and between high-level tone and high-falling tone. In EL phonation, high-level tone was produced more accurately than the other tones which were often misidentified as a high-level tone.",M2

Although serviceable, EL speech is plagued by shortcomings in both sound quality and intelligibility. This study sought to better quantify the relative contributions of previously identified acoustic abnormalities to the perception of degraded quality in EL speech. Ten normal listeners evaluated the sound quality of EL speech tokens that had been acoustically enhanced by (a) increased low-frequency energy, (b) EL-noise reduction, and (c) fundamental frequency variation to mimic normal pitch intonation in relation to nonenhanced EL speech, normal speech, and normal monotonous speech (fundamental frequency variation removed). In comparing all possible combinations of token pairs, listeners were asked to identify which one of each pair sounded most like normal natural speech, and then to rate on a visual analog scale how different the chosen token was from normal speech. The results indicate that although EL speech can be most improved by removing the EL noise and providing proper pitch information, the resulting quality is still well below that of normal natural speech or even that of monotonous natural speech. This suggests that, in addition to the widely acknowledged acoustic abnormalities examined in this investigation, there are other attributes that contribute significantly to the unnatural quality of EL speech. Such additional factors need to be clearly identified and remedied before EL speech can be made to more closely approximate the sound quality of normal natural speech.",M2
16308247,"Cost of tracheoesophageal prostheses in developing countries. Facing the problem from an internal perspective.CONCLUSIONS: All the discussants of our questionnaire agreed that the price of tracheoesophageal (TE) prostheses was too expensive for developing countries. The problem could be addressed in terms of international laws regarding companies' patent rights. TE prosthesis manufacturers from rich countries could move their manufacturing in part to developing countries. High production standards could allow TE prostheses to be exported to developed countries. Another approach to the problem may be based on a partnership between non-profit-making Western laryngological societies with specific medical and technical prosthetic know-how and local manufacturers. The aim of this cooperation could be the low-cost production of advanced TE prostheses in the developing countries. OBJECTIVES: In communities in the developing world, most <e>laryngeal</e> and hypopharyngeal carcinomas are diagnosed at advanced stages and require total laryngectomy. Prosthetic TE voice restoration is the method of choice for voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomy in developed countries. Unacceptably high costs are a significant limitation to Third World use of TE voice prostheses. The aims of this paper are to discuss the consequences of the high costs of TE prostheses in developing countries with head and neck surgeons working in Third World hospitals and to propose how European and American laryngological societies can promote TE speech in the developing countries. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A questionnaire was given to a group of expert head and neck surgeons working in developing countries and their answers and suggestions discussed.",M2
16158525,"Difficulties in the fixation of prostheses for voice rehabilitation after laryngectomy.In most patients with advanced or recurrent <e>laryngeal</e> or hypopharyngeal cancer, total laryngectomy is indicated. This means the loss of three main functions: phonation; respiration; and the prevention of aspiration during deglutition. Laryngectomy patients have various options to restore phonation: an oesophageal voice; an electrolaryngeal voice; or a tracheo-oesophageal voice. In the last case a silicone rubber shunt valve is placed in the tracheo-oesophageal wall and phonation is generated when exhaled air is forced through the oesophagus and neopharynx. This method is widely applied in Western Europe. In this paper we review the literature on fixation problems with shunt valves, tracheostoma valves and heat and moisture exchange (HME) filters. Tracheo-oesophageal speech without a valve is not considered. Despite 22 years of experience with the implantation of tracheo-esophageal shunt valves and many improvements in the design, problems still remain, such as biofilm formation with subsequent leakage through the valve, the need for frequent and inconvenient replacements, fistula enlargement leading to leakage around the device and reduced fixation, and infections. The high cost of shunt valves is a drawback to their use worldwide. To enable hands-free speech, different types of tracheostoma valve have been developed. These valves are fixed to the skin or to the tracheostoma by means of an intra-tracheal device. An HME filter is used to protect the airway and maintain physiological balance. Such devices are only suitable for a selected group of patients as fixation to the skin or trachea can be a major problem. Speaking and coughing cause pressure increases, which often result in mucous leakage and disconnection of the valve and/or HME filter. Recommendations are made for future improvements in fixation techniques.",M2
16001246,"Intelligibility of laryngectomees' substitute speech: automatic speech recognition and subjective rating.Substitute speech after laryngectomy is characterized by restricted aero-acoustic properties in comparison with <e>laryngeal</e> speech and has therefore lower intelligibility. Until now, an objective means to determine and quantify the intelligibility has not existed, although the intelligibility can serve as a global outcome parameter of voice restoration after laryngectomy. An automatic speech recognition system was applied on recordings of a standard text read by 18 German male laryngectomees with tracheoesophageal substitute speech. The system was trained with normal laryngeal speakers and not adapted to severely disturbed voices. Substitute speech was compared to laryngeal speech of a control group. Subjective evaluation of intelligibility was performed by a panel of five experts and compared to automatic speech evaluation. Substitute speech showed lower syllables/s and lower word accuracy than laryngeal speech. Automatic speech recognition for substitute speech yielded word accuracy between 10.0 and 50% (28.7+/-12.1%) with sufficient discrimination. It complied with experts' subjective evaluations of intelligibility. The multi-rater kappa of the experts alone did not differ from the multi-rater kappa of experts and the recognizer. Automatic speech recognition serves as a good means to objectify and quantify global speech outcome of laryngectomees. For clinical use, the speech recognition system will be adapted to disturbed voices and can also be applied in other languages.",M2
15453536,"Surface electromyographic activity in total laryngectomy patients following <e>laryngeal</e> nerve transfer to neck strap muscles.Hands-free triggering and pitch control would improve electrolarynx devices, which are inconvenient to use and sound unnatural. The present study tested the strategy of salvaging voice-related neural signals for hands-free electrolarynx control either by transferring cut recurrent laryngeal nerves (RLNs) to denervated neck strap muscles or by preserving strap muscles with their normal innervation. An RLN nerve transfer was performed at the time of total laryngectomy in 8 individuals, and in 5 of these subjects, strap muscles with intact ansa cervicalis innervation were also preserved for comparison. Neck surface electromyography performed over the strap muscles was used periodically for more than 1 year on phonatory and nonphonatory tasks. Signals were eventually obtained in all subjects from both RLN-innervated and ansa-innervated strap muscles that correlated with speech production. After 1 year, RLN-driven signals were larger than ansa-driven signals in magnitude, and their timing appeared better correlated with intended phonation. The results show that neck surface electromyography is an effective control source for hands-free electrolarynx activation, and that RLN transfer may provide the best approach for obtaining phonation-related activity.",M2

All patients are males aged 41-72 years (mean age 58) treated in the Department of Otolaryngology Medical Academy of Bialystok from November 2001 to March 2002. The voice prostheses were placed during the total laryngectomy in 5 patients. In 2 patients the voice prosthesis was placed in the period of 1.5 to 2 years after laryngectomy. The voice prostheses type Provox 2 were used in all cases. In 2 cases the prosthesis was in size of 8 mm, in 5 cases--10 mm. The control group included 7 patients after total laryngectomy without placing the voice prostheses. These patients developed oesophageal speech. All patients underwent phoniatric measurements during 12 to 30 days after the surgical procedure. The data indicate that patients who developed oesophageal speech, their voice in the range of subjective measurements is understandable but it is necessary to emphasize that the voice is harsh, low without fluency of the speech result from the intervals essential to accumulate the air in the oesophagus. The patients with voice prostheses have dull voice but more fluent and louder. The clarity of the voice of the patients with voice prostheses is significantly higher.

Focussing on the handicap experienced by dysphonic patients, the Voice Handicap Index (VHI) has previously been found to be of significant clinical and scientific value for different voices. In this study the VHI questionnaire was applied to demonstrate the voice handicap of 20 male laryngectomees using tracheoesophageal voice (Provox), aged 65.5 +/- 8.7 years. Their VHI was 45.5 +/- 24.1, which was significantly higher than the score of patients with functional voice disorders, but differed only slightly from patients with organic <e>laryngeal</e> dysphonia. Focussing on individual data, VHI scores ranged from values similar to persons without voice disorder to maximum handicap of 101. Comparing the VHI scores with the laryngectomees' gradual self-perception of voice disorder severity, no consistent relationship was found. Considering the large interindividual differences, the VHI may serve as a valuable instrument for the assessment of individual interventional needs rather than for the identification of a general laryngectomees' handicap.",M2

12942982,"Measuring the neck frequency response function of laryngectomy patients: implications for the design of electrolarynx devices.Measurements of the neck frequency response function (NFRF), defined as the ratio of the spectrum of the estimated volume velocity that excites the vocal tract to the spectrum of the acceleration delivered to the neck wall, were made at three different positions on the necks of nine laryngectomized subjects (five males and four females) and four normal <e>laryngeal</e> speakers (two males and two females). A minishaker driven by broadband noise provided excitation to the necks of subjects as they configured their vocal tracts to mimic the production of the vowels /a/, /ae/, and /I/. The sound pressure at the lips was measured with a microphone and an impedance head mounted on the shaker measured the acceleration. The neck wall passed low-frequency sound energy better than high-frequency sound energy, and thus the NFRF was accurately modeled as a low-pass filter. The NFRFs of the different subject groups (female laryngeal, male laryngeal speakers, laryngectomized males, and laryngectomized females) differed from each other in terms of corner frequency and gain, with both types of male subjects presenting NFRFs with larger overall gains. In addition, there was a notable amount of intersubject variability within groups. Because the NFRF is an estimate of how sound energy passes through the neck wall, these results should aid in the design of improved neck-type electrolarynx devices.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: Historical review. METHODS: The unpublished documents of Taptas's family archives and one of his papers, describing his own original technique for voice rehabilitation after total laryngectomies, were studied. RESULTS: In his texts, Taptas described the application of external <e>laryngeal</e> prostheses in one of his patients who underwent total laryngectomy. Taptas meticulously recorded his own first successful attempt in a woman with cancer of the larynx. He was one of the first scientists who, at the end of the 19th century, devised an external laryngeal prosthesis, which had the advantage of rehabilitating a sufficiently strong whispering voice; by using a prototype valve, he avoided problems of aspiration of liquids and food to the bronchi.

12587251,"Swallowing and speech therapy after definitive treatment for <e>laryngeal</e> cancer.As the trend in laryngeal cancer treatment shifts towards organ-conservation surgeries and organ-preservation protocols, patients will more often retain anatomy vital to communication and swallowing. Despite a conservative approach, results of treatment may have debilitating effects. Rehabilitation efforts are directed towards a return to functional, if not normal, status. Although there are predictable trends in voice and swallowing disorders of patients with laryngeal cancer, posttreatment dysphonia and dysphagia are diverse in presentation. Considering the significant diversity of this population, speech pathologists should work closely with otolaryngologists to determine the most appropriate treatment for each patient. As this article demonstrates, voice and swallowing therapy are necessary components of the rehabilitation process following treatment for head and neck cancers. As always, treatment is tailored to the specific individual and based on information obtained during a thorough evaluation by a speech pathologist.

Twenty males between the ages of 18 and 45 performed the following three tasks on the vowels /a/ and /i/: (1) 4 seconds of sustained vowel, (2) 2 seconds of sustained vowel followed by 2 seconds of artificial phonation via a neck placement, and (3) 4 seconds of sustained vowel, the last two of which were accompanied by artificial phonation via an oral placement. Frequencies for formants 1-4 were measured for each task at second 1 and second 3 using linear predictive coding. These measures were compared across second 1 and second 3, as well as across all three tasks. Neither of the methods of artificial laryngeal stimulation tested in this study yielded formant frequency estimates that consistently agreed with those obtained from natural phonation for both vowels and all formants.

The low airflow resistance of the ULR Groningen voice prosthesis objectively (PITP = 2.7 kPa) and subjectively leads to a low effort to phonate. Compared to  normals  maximal phonation time shows no significant difference, but speech rate, maximal vocal intensity and dynamic vocal intensity range show a significant worse outcome. The mean device lifetime of the ULR Groningen prosthesis is more than 13.6 weeks, which is comparable to other indwelling voice prostheses.

These ILEPs are simple to place, well tolerated, efficacious in preventing deglutition pneumonitis and easy to remove. Furthermore, the reversibility of this bloodless procedure facilitates the monitoring of a possible recovery of the laryngeal functions.",M2

We studied 30 tracheoesophageal shunt speakers while using  trap-door  type voice prostheses. Videostroboscopy was undertaken to investigate vibratory patterns of the neoglottis during phonation of the sustained vowel sound /e/ in these patients. The voice qualities of the patients were judged perceptually. A regular neoglottic vibration was observed in 21 patients. Nine patients had irregular neoglottic vibrations. In this latter group, two patients had incomplete neoglottic closures with breathy voices, four patients had multiple contacts of several mucosal walls with rough voices, and three patients had tight neoglottic closures with strained voices. During stroboscopic evaluation of tracheoesophageal shunt phonation, regularity of the neoglottic vibration may be the most significant finding. These findings show that it is as important to evaluate neoglottic vibration in alaryngeal voicing as it is to study glottic vibration in <e>laryngeal</e> voicing.

We also compared the patients' own perceptual ratings of their voice to the perceptual ratings of a group of listeners. STUDY DESIGN: Two groups of laryngeal cancer patients were studied. METHODS: Fourteen irradiated laryngeal speakers with preserved larynx were matched with 14 salvage surgery laryngectomized patients speaking with tracheoesophageal prosthesis (TEP). To measure patients' QOL, we used the European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Core Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30), the EORTC Head and Neck module (EORTC QLQ-H&amp;N35), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD) and a study-specific questionnaire. For the perceptual speech evaluation we used visual analog scales. RESULTS: The perceptual ratings of speech intelligibility, voice quality, and speech acceptability showed a significant difference between the treatment groups. Both the patients who received treatment with radiotherapy and the listeners rated the irradiated laryngeal voices higher than the tracheoesophageal speech. The laryngectomized patients scored significantly better than the patients treated with radical radiotherapy on the question about hoarseness.

8915450,"Efficacy of prosthetic laryngoplasty with and without bilateral ventriculocordectomy as treatments for <e>laryngeal</e> hemiplegia in horses.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy of prosthetic laryngoplasty with and without bilateral ventriculocordectomy for treatment of experimentally induced left laryngeal hemiplegia (LLH). ANIMALS: 15 adult Standardbreds. PROCEDURE: Horses were allotted to 3 equal groups. Sham operation (group 1), prosthetic laryngoplasty (group 2), or prosthetic laryngoplasty with bilateral ventriculocordectomy (group 3) was performed after induction of LLH. Upper airway function testing was performed prior to left recurrent laryngeal neurectomy (LRLN), 14 days after LRLN, and 60 and 180 days after surgical treatment. Measurements were obtained at rest and at treadmill speeds corresponding to 75 and 100% of maximal heart rate. Videoendoscopy was performed at rest and during exercise in all horses prior to LRLN and 60 and 180 days after surgical treatment. Upper airway endoscopy was performed immediately after LRLN to document induction of grade-IV LLH. Also, horses in group 3 were endoscopically examined at 7, 14, 21, 28, and 120 days after surgical treatment to evaluate healing of the ventriculocordectomy sites. RESULTS: When horses were at rest, significant differences were not apparent between groups at any period or between periods for any measured variable. LRLN induced airway obstruction in all horses during exercise. In sham-operated horses, this obstruction was unaffected by time. In contrast, 60 and 180 days after surgical treatment, inspiratory flow limitations induced by LRLN were reversed in horses of groups 2 and 3. There were no significant differences between the 2 treatment groups. Endoscopy revealed the left arytenoid cartilage abducted beyond the intermediate position, but not touching the pharyngeal wall in all horses with a laryngeal prosthesis. After surgical treatment, 4 group-2 horses had filling of both ventricles with air during exercise. There was moderate to marked swelling of the ventriculocordectomy sites immediately after surgery, and this swelling resolved by 7 days after surgery. The ventriculocordectomy sites looked best at 14 and 180 days. CONCLUSIONS: 60 and 180 days after prosthetic laryngoplasty, upper airway function returned to pre-LRLN values in horses with experimentally induced LLH exercising at 100% of maximal heart rate. Combining ventriculocordectomy with prosthetic laryngoplasty does not further improve upper airway function in these horses.",M2
8846981,"[Speech rehabilitation following total laryngectomy with tracheo-esophageal puncture]Speech rehabilitation after total laryngectomy has often been neglected, and traditional methods of esophageal voice production are frequently unsuccessful or disappointing. The development of the tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) technique and the valved voice prosthesis by Singer and Blom in 1979 offered patients an alternative method for <e>laryngeal</e> speech rehabilitation. This technique is now used successfully in an increasing number of patients after total laryngectomy. We present our experience with TEP since 1988 in 8 men and 1 woman, aged 50-86 years, who had adequate follow-up. In 5, primary TEP was performed at the same time as the total laryngectomy; in 4, secondary puncture was performed 12-18 months after primary surgery. 1 had serious operative complications, 2 had minor complications, 1 had long-term problems which necessitated discontinuing use of the prosthesis, while 8 achieved satisfactory voice use and could communicate effectively. We hope that further experience with TEP in Israel will confirm its effectiveness for speech rehabilitation after total laryngectomy.",M2

This study examines factors associated with laryngeal complications after type I thyroplasty. Ten laryngoscopic variables were analyzed from preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative videolaryngoscopies of 51 patients undergoing 58 medialization procedures. Ten patient and operative variables were examined by medical record review. Major complications were defined as wound hemorrhage, airway obstruction, or prosthesis extrusion. Minor complications were defined as vocal fold hematoma without airway obstruction or prosthesis movement. The major complication rate was 8.6%, and the minor complication rate was 29%. No delayed hemorrhage or airway obstruction occurred. Prosthesis extrusion occurred in five (8.6%) patients 1 week to 5 months after surgery. Extrusion was associated with suboptimal prosthesis placement in 80% of cases. Two patients retained excellent glottal closure despite extrusion. Vocal fold hematoma was identified in 14 (24%) cases and resolved within 1 week. Prosthesis movement occurred in three (5%) patients 1 week to 6 months after surgery and resulted in poor glottal closure. All patients with prosthesis extrusion or movement were female. Type I thyroplasty remains a safe outpatient procedure with few major complications. Prosthesis extrusion was associated with suboptimal prosthesis placement and may or may not result in poor glottal closure. Minor vocal fold hematomas were relatively frequent, resolved rapidly, and were not associated with airway obstruction. Female patients may be more prone to complications because of their small laryngeal size.",M2

Results of a patient survey]105 of 292 patients who had been laryngectomised at the Zentralkrankenhaus Bremen, between 1975 and 1990, were asked retrospectively by questionnaires concerning the state of their voice rehabilitation. 66.6% of them had learnt oesophageal speech, 36.2% used an external vibrator, and 9.4% a voice prosthesis (since 1985). 82.8% used only one kind of substitute (non-<e>laryngeal</e>) speech. If patients used more than one non-laryngeal speech pattern, the most frequent combination was oesophageal speech and an external vibrator. The most rapid voice rehabilitation was achieved by patients using a voice prosthesis (71.3% within six weeks). In the same period of time, 45.5% of the patients learnt to use the electronic voice aid, and only 16.1% learnt oesophageal speech. It took a whole year before all patient who eventually used oesophageal speech, had learned to handle it. Ambulant speech therapy was the predominant treatment leading to voice rehabilitation, followed by the support given by self-aid groups. A comparison of the various non-laryngeal speech patterns with regard to daily communication problems, and of the general satisfaction achieved with the type of non-laryngeal speech used, showed quantitative predominance of oesophageal speech as a positively rated method for voice restoration, even though a clear trend towards increased use of the voice prosthesis since its introduction is noticeable.",M2
8049046,"Problems with tracheoesophageal fistula voice restoration in totally laryngectomized patients. A review of 95 cases.OBJECTIVES: Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) construction, performed during or after total laryngectomy, is used for voice and speech restoration but has been associated with mild to severe complications. Our goal was to study the successes and complications in the application of this technique to restore voice function after laryngectomy in 95 consecutive patients. RESEARCH DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study with a mean follow-up time of 3.5 years. SETTING: Five medical facilities in northern California: the Veterans Affairs Medical Centers in San Francisco and Martinez, the Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Oakland, and private practice offices in San Francisco and Pinole. PATIENTS: Ninety-five patients (90 men and five women) who had undergone total laryngectomy with subsequent or primary TEF construction. Patients' ages ranged from 35 to 80 years. INTERVENTIONS: Three- or two-layer closure was used, depending on whether TEF construction was done as a secondary or a primary procedure. Most patients underwent radiation therapy, and most used surface or intraoral electrolarynx devices before TEF construction. Insufflation tests were performed by clinicians, or self-insufflation tests were performed by the patient. Patients' voices were recorded and analyzed. In many cases, respiratory and pulmonary function studies were performed before and after total laryngectomy or TEF. Blom-Singer and Groningen voice prostheses were used. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Voice restoration was considered successful when the patient was able to communicate effectively via the TEF. RESULTS: Approximately 92% of patients who underwent TEF construction and had voice prostheses placed were considered to be successfully rehabilitated. Complications ranged from mild to severe and included problems with predictive values obtained during insufflation, fistula retention, TEF angulation shifts, fungal colonization of the prosthesis, valve retention problems, difficulty with digital occlusion, pressure necrosis, postradiation necrosis, dysphagia, phonatory gagging, emesis, gastric distention, pouching, stenosis, infection, hypertrophy, shunt insufficiency, persistent spasm, myotomy, inadvertent fistula closure, and aspiration of the prosthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Acoustic measures indicate that speech produced with the TEF compares better with normal <e>laryngeal</e> speech than does esophageal or electronic speech. Thus, TEF should remain the preferred procedure to rehabilitate patients undergoing total laryngectomy.",M2

Generally, the modality of treatment is mainly radiation and surgery; radiation or partial laryngectomy for early-stage cancer, total laryngectomy for advanced-stage cancer. However, selection of therapy should not only be based on stage, but also on various other factors, e.g., type of growth, medical facilities available and the patient's situation (age, etc.).
