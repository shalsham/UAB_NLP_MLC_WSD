20509902,"Infrequent detection of <e>Pneumocystis</e> jirovecii by PCR in oral wash specimens from TB patients with or without HIV and healthy contacts in Tanzania.BACKGROUND: In tuberculosis (TB) endemic parts of the world, patients with pulmonary symptoms are managed as  smear-negative TB patients  if they do not improve on a two-week presumptive, broad-spectrum course of antibiotic treatment even if they are TB microscopy smear negative. These patients are frequently HIV positive and have a higher mortality than smear-positive TB patients. Lack of access to diagnose Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia might be a contributing reason. We therefore assessed the prevalence of P. jirovecii by PCR in oral wash specimens among TB patients and healthy individuals in an HIV- and TB-endemic area of sub-Saharan Africa. METHODS: A prospective study of 384 patients initiating treatment for sputum smear-positive and smear-negative TB and 100 healthy household contacts and neighbourhood controls. DNA from oral wash specimens was examined by PCR for P. jirovecii. All patients delivered sputum for TB microscopy and culture. Healthy contacts and community controls were clinically assessed and all study subjects were HIV tested and had CD4 cell counts determined. Clinical status and mortality was assessed after a follow-up period of 5 months. RESULTS: 384 patients and 100 controls were included, 53% and 8% HIV positive respectively. A total number of 65 patients and controls (13.6%) were at definitive risk for PCP based on CD4 counts &lt;200 cells per mm3 and no specific PCP prophylaxis. Only a single patient (0.3% of the patients) was PCR positive for P. jirovecii. None of the healthy household contacts or neighbourhood controls had PCR-detectable P. jirovecii DNA in their oral wash specimens regardless of HIV-status. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of P. jirovecii as detected by PCR on oral wash specimens was very low among TB patients with or without HIV and healthy individuals in Tanzania. Colonisation by P. jirovecii was not detected among healthy controls. The present findings may encourage diagnostic use of this non-invasive method.",M1
20414100,"Granulomatous reaction to <e>pneumocystis</e> jirovecii: clinicopathologic review of 20 cases.To better characterize the clinical and pathologic features of granulomatous reaction to Pneumocystis jirovecii, we reviewed 20 cases of this uncommon response. Patients included 15 males and 5 females (mean age 52 y). The most common symptom was dyspnea (5 of 14). Primary medical diagnoses included human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (7 of 20), hematopoietic (6 of 20), and solid malignancies (4 of 20). Radiology findings included nodular (8 of 16) and diffuse (5 of 16) infiltrates and solitary nodules (3 of 16). Diagnostic procedures with the highest yield were open lung biopsy (13 of 20) and autopsy (5 of 20); false-negative results were most common on bronchial washings/brushings, bronchoalveolar lavage, fine needle aspiration, and transbronchial biopsy. Follow-up showed resolution of disease (6 of 13), death from disease (6 of 13), and death from unknown cause (1 of 13). Histologically, clusters of Gomori methenamine silver-positive (20 of 20) Pneumocystis organisms were identified in all cases. Organisms were identified within well (16 of 20) and poorly (4 of 20) formed necrotizing (16 of 20) and non-necrotizing (4 of 20) granulomas ranging in size from 0.1 to 2.5 cm (mean 0.5 cm); granulomas were multiple (18 of 20) or single (2 of 20). Giant cells (11 of 20), a fibrous rim (8 of 20), and eosinophils (6 of 20) were seen. Foamy eosinophilic exudates were present centrally within some granulomas (5 of 20). Cystic spaces (1 of 20) and calcification (1 of 20) were rare. Only one case demonstrated classic intra-alveolar foamy exudates containing Pneumocystis. Granulomatous P. jirovecii pneumonia occurs most commonly in males with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, hematopoietic, and solid malignancies. The diagnosis may be overlooked as conventional radiologic and pathologic features are absent. When suspected, open lung biopsy is most likely to yield diagnostic material. Attention to organism morphology avoids misdiagnosis as Histoplasma.",M1
20395244,"Polymerase chain reaction positivity of <e>Pneumocystis</e> jirovecii during primary lung cancer treatment.OBJECTIVE: When treating lung cancer, pneumocystic pneumonia is a life-threatening complication seen during chemotherapy. Polymerase chain reaction is used to detect its cause, Pneumocystis jirovecii, but polymerase chain reaction positives without pneumocystic pneumonia are sometimes seen. The purpose of this study was to assess the frequency of pneumocystic pneumonia during cancer treatment. METHODS: Fifty induced sputum specimens and 4 bronchoalveolar lavage specimens collected from 50 patients with acute respiratory symptoms during anticancer therapy were retrospectively studied after classifying the patients into lung cancer (n = 29) and solid tumor (n = 21) groups. All of the patients in both groups had an interstitial shadow suspected of being pneumocystic pneumonia, and all had polymerase chain reaction tests. RESULTS: Eleven of the 54 specimens were polymerase chain reaction positive, and 1 patient was clinically diagnosed with pneumocystic pneumonia. The incidence of polymerase chain reaction positivity in the lung cancer group was significantly higher than in the solid tumor group (31 vs. 5%; P = 0.03), and the incidence of subclinical pneumocystic pneumonia (29 vs. 5%; P = 0.059) also tended to be higher in that group. There were no significant biochemical differences between the two groups, irrespective of the polymerase chain reaction results. Among polymerase chain reaction-positive patients in the lung cancer group, the cumulative dose of corticosteroid administration tended to be higher than among the polymerase chain reaction-negative patients (P = 0.09). Following the polymerase chain reaction tests, nearly all polymerase chain reaction-positive patients without pneumocystic pneumonia received antipneumocystic agents, and none developed pneumocystic pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest polymerase chain reaction positivity for P. jirovecii will be detected in a fraction of lung cancer patients. Although it is difficult to predict the need for administration of pneumocystic pneumonia treatment to subclinical pneumocystic pneumonia based on polymerase chain reaction and biochemical results, polymerase chain reaction-positive patients should be followed-up with antipneumocystic agents to ensure they are not at an early stage of pneumocystic pneumonia.",M1
20378904,"Prognostic value of C-reactive protein in HIV-infected patients with <e>Pneumocystis</e> jirovecii pneumonia.C-reactive protein (CRP) is a sensitive marker of inflammation and tissue damage. We aimed to describe CRP responses in HIV-infected patients presenting with Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), bacterial pneumonia (BP) and pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) and, in patients with PCP, to identify if elevated CRP has prognostic significance. Data obtained by case-note review of consecutive HIV-infected adults with acute respiratory episodes included admission CRP (elevated &gt;5 mg/L), haemoglobin, white blood count, CD4 count and partial pressure of oxygen in the blood (PaO(2)), presence of pulmonary co-pathology/intercurrent infection and outcome (survival). Median (range) CRP in patients with BP = 120 mg/L (&lt;5-620 mg/L), TB = 44 mg/L (&lt;5-256.3 mg/L) and PCP = 35 mg/L (&lt;5-254 mg/L). CRP was elevated in 93/103 (90.3%) patients with PCP; six patients died; and all had an elevated CRP. PaO(2) and CRP values were associated as follows: average CRP levels declined by 10% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.20%) per kPa increase in PaO(2) = 0.002. Factors associated with death were higher CRP, odds ratio (OR) (95% CI) = 5.30 (1.61 to 17.51) per 100 mg/L increase, P = 0.006 and haemoglobin, OR (95% CI) = 0.52 (0.29 to 0.93) per g/dL, P = 0.033. CRP is elevated in the majority of HIV-infected patients with PCP, BP and TB. Admission CRP measurement lacks specificity, but in PCP elevations of CRP are associated with disease severity (PaO(2)) and poor outcome and might be used prognostically, together with other mortality risk factors; further prospective evaluation is needed.",M1

20350666,"Rituximab-associated infections.After more than 10 years of use, rituximab has proven to be remarkably safe. However, accumulated evidence now suggests that under some circumstances it may significantly increase the risk of infections. This risk is difficult to quantify because of confounding factors (namely, concomitant use of immunosuppressive or chemotherapeutic agents and underlying conditions), as well as under-reporting. Increased number of infections has been documented in patients treated with maintenance rituximab for low-grade lymphoma and in patients with concomitant severe immunodeficiency, whether caused by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection or immunosuppressive agents like fludarabine. From the practical standpoint, the most important infection is hepatitis B reactivation, which may be delayed and result in fulminant liver failure and death. Special care should be placed on screening for hepatitis B virus (HBV) and preemptive antiviral treatment. Some investigators have reported an increase in <e>Pneumocystis</e> pneumonia. Finally, there is increasing evidence of a possible association with progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a lethal encephalitis caused by the polyomavirus JC. This review enumerates the described infectious complications, summarizes the possible underlying mechanisms of the increased risk, and makes recommendations regarding prevention, diagnosis and management.",M1
20195409,"Severe pulmonary adverse effects in lymphoma patients treated with cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) regimen plus rituximab.BACKGROUND/AIMS: The aim of our study was to determine the incidence and clinical features of severe pulmonary complications in patients receiving cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisone (CHOP) or rituximab plus CHOP (R-CHOP) as the initial treatment for lymphoma. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of pulmonary infection and drug-induced interstitial pneumonitis (DIIP) was performed using lymphoma registry data. R-CHOP was administered in 71 patients and CHOP in 29 patients. RESULTS: The severe pulmonary adverse events tended to occur more frequently with R-CHOP (18.3%) than CHOP alone (13.8%), although the difference was not significant (p = 0.771). DIIP occurred in five patients in the R-CHOP arm (7%) and in one in the CHOP arm (3%). The continuous use of steroids for conditions other than lymphoma significantly increased the risk of pulmonary infection including <e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci pneumonia (p = 0.036) in the multivariate analysis. International prognostic index, tumor stage, smoking, previous tuberculosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and lymphoma involvement of lung parenchyma were not related to pulmonary adverse events. Patients who experienced severe pulmonary events showed shorter survival when compared to those without complications (p = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Our experiences with serial cases with DIIP during chemotherapy and the correlation of continuous steroid use with pulmonary infection suggest that the incidence of pulmonary complications might be high during lymphoma treatment, and careful monitoring should be performed.",M1
20194450,"A survey of rheumatologists' practice for prescribing <e>pneumocystis</e> prophylaxis.OBJECTIVE: Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) occurs in immunocompromised hosts, in both the presence and absence of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection, with substantial morbidity and a heightened mortality. We assessed practice patterns among rheumatologists for prescribing PCP prophylaxis. METHODS: Invitations to an online international survey were e-mailed to 3150 consecutive members of the American College of Rheumatology. RESULTS: Completed surveys were returned by 727 (23.1%) members. Among respondents, 505 (69.5%) reported prescribing prophylaxis. Factors associated with significantly higher frequency of prescribing PCP prophylaxis included female gender (OR 1.47, p = 0.03), US-based (OR 1.77, p = 0.004), academic-based (OR 2.75, p &lt; 0.001), in practice less than 10 years (OR 4.08, p &lt; 0.001), having previously treated PCP (OR 2.62, p &lt; 0.001), and in a practice with a higher proportion of patients maintained on chronic glucocorticoids (OR 2.04, p &lt; 0.001) or other immunosuppressant medications (OR 3.19, p = 0.003). In multivariate analysis, rheumatologists early in their careers and those with academic and US-based practices were more likely to prescribe prophylaxis. Among prescribers, the most important determinants for issuing prophylaxis were treatment regimen (68.6%), rheumatologic diagnosis (9.3%), and medication dosage (8.3%). CONCLUSION: Nearly one-third (30%) of the rheumatologists surveyed reported that they never prescribed PCP prophylaxis. While the patient characteristics for which prophylaxis was prescribed varied widely, physician demographics were strongly predictive of PCP prophylaxis use. These findings suggest that development of consensus guidelines might influence clinical decision-making regarding PCP prophylaxis in HIV-negative patients with rheumatologic diagnoses.",M1
20173272,"Racial variations in care and outcomes for inpatient HIV-related <e>pneumocystis</e> pneumonia.Racial disparities in HIV-care include the disproportionate impact of HIV/AIDS on African Americans. We conducted a retrospective review of 1,855 cases at 78 hospitals in nine cities to evaluate racial variations in inpatient care for AIDS-related Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) shortly after the introduction of highly active anti-retroviral therapies. While inpatient HIV-related PCP mortality was comparable between Whites and Hispanics (p=0.94), African Americans were less likely than Whites to die in-hospital (AOR 0.69, 95% CI 0.48, 0.99) and more likely to receive timely anti-PCP medications (AOR 1.67, 95% CI 1.21, 2.30) and timely corticosteroids (AOR 1.46, 95% CI 1.17, 1.82). Findings were compared with those from our study involving 1,547 patients at 82 hospitals in five cities over the first decade of the AIDS epidemic. In contrast to the first study, in the second decade African Americans were more likely to receive timely and appropriate therapy for HIV-related PCP, and resultantly were more likely to survive the hospitalization.",M1

20154431,"Comparison of clinical and radiological features of <e>pneumocystis</e> pneumonia between malignancy cases and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome cases: a multicenter study.BACKGROUND: The clinical features of pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) differ according to the predisposing factors responsible for immunosuppression. Although PCP in patients with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) has been extensively described, its characteristics in non-AIDS patients, such as those with malignancies, are not thoroughly documented. STUDY OBJECTIVE: To characterize and compare the clinical and imaging features of PCP in patients with malignancies with those in AIDS patients. DESIGN: A multi-center retrospective study. PATIENTS AND MEASUREMENTS: We evaluated the clinical and radiological features of PCP in 21 patients with malignancies and in 17 with AIDS. Clinical presentation, serum markers, oxygenation, CT findings, and outcome were examined. RESULTS: The patients with malignancies showed shorter durations of symptoms before PCP was diagnosed. The levels of serum markers and the oxygenation index did not differ. CT showed diffuse or widespread ground-glass opacity (GGO) in all of the patients evaluated. None of the AIDS patients demonstrated consolidation, whereas half of the patients with malignancy showed consolidation along with GGO. The extent of GGO scored on CT images was significantly greater in the AIDS patients. No correlation was observed between the CT findings and other clinical parameters. All of the AIDS patients recovered from PCP, whereas six patients with malignancies died within a month after the onset of PCP. CONCLUSION: The characteristics of the CT images differed between the patient groups with different underlying disorders, although it remains to be determined whether CT findings are associated with other clinical features or are predictive of the outcome of PCP.",M1
20126455,"Echinocandin treatment of <e>pneumocystis</e> pneumonia in rodent models depletes cysts leaving trophic burdens that cannot transmit the infection.Fungi in the genus Pneumocystis cause pneumonia (PCP) in hosts with debilitated immune systems and are emerging as co-morbidity factors associated with chronic diseases such as COPD. Limited therapeutic choices and poor understanding of the life cycle are a result of the inability of these fungi to grow outside the mammalian lung. Within the alveolar lumen, Pneumocystis spp., appear to have a bi-phasic life cycle consisting of an asexual phase characterized by binary fission of trophic forms and a sexual cycle resulting in formation of cysts, but the life cycle stage that transmits the infection is not known. The cysts, but not the trophic forms, express beta -1,3-D-glucan synthetase and contain abundant beta -1,3-D-glucan. Here we show that therapeutic and prophylactic treatment of PCP with echinocandins, compounds which inhibit the synthesis of beta -1,3-D-glucan, depleted cysts in rodent models of PCP, while sparing the trophic forms which remained in significant numbers. Survival was enhanced in the echincandin treated mice, likely due to the decreased beta -1,3-D-glucan content in the lungs of treated mice and rats which coincided with reductions of cyst numbers, and dramatic remodeling of organism morphology. Strong evidence for the cyst as the agent of transmission was provided by the failure of anidulafungin-treated mice to transmit the infection. We show for the first time that withdrawal of anidulafungin treatment with continued immunosuppression permitted the repopulation of cyst forms. Treatment of PCP with an echinocandin alone will not likely result in eradication of infection and cessation of echinocandin treatment while the patient remains immunosuppressed could result in relapse. Importantly, the echinocandins provide novel and powerful chemical tools to probe the still poorly understood bi-phasic life cycle of this genus of fungal pathogens.",M1
20113271,"Imaging characteristics of <e>pneumocystis</e> pneumonia after renal transplantation.Identification of Pneumocysis pneumonia (PCP) after renal transplantation has a great impact on early diagnosis and therapy, which could decrease its mortality. Due to a lack of characteristic clinical symptoms, imaging modalities became very important in the diagnosing PCP. Thirteen PCP patients after renal transplantation were reviewed. They underwent a series of chest radiographs and chest high-resolution CT scans. The common radiological presentations were bilateral diffuse symmetrical ground-glass and consolidation opacities, followed by pneumoceles or air-filled cysts or linear or reticular shadows. Ground-glass attenuations were showed clearly on HRCT in 13 patients, while only 6 on CXR. Pneumoceles or cysts (n = 8) were seen only on HRCT. Air-filled cysts or pneumoceles within bilateral diffuse symmetrical ground-glass and consolidation opacities may be the characteristic of this disease. If combined with clinical data, the diagnosis of PCP could be established.",M1

Chest CT findings and clinical parameters of 38 consecutive immunocompromised patients, nine with AIDS and 29 with other causes of immunosuppression, were characterized and compared. PCP in patients without AIDS was diagnosed after a significantly shorter time interval from symptom onset: 8 +/- 6 vs. 18 +/- 1.0 days (p = 0.024). From a radiographic point of view, non-AIDS patients had a significantly higher proportion of diffuse ground glass lesions, 86 vs. 44% (p = 0.02), and a lower proportion of cystic lesions, 3 vs. 56% (p = 0.015). The two subgroups did not differ in smoking status and the number of pack-years. On multivariant analysis, only the presence of AIDS was found to be a risk factor for the formation of pulmonary cystic lesions. Different immune reactions to the parasite P. jirovecii in immunocompromised patients with and without AIDS results in a different time lag between symptoms and a correspondingly different radiographic pattern: widespread ground glass opacities in the former and cystic lesions in the latter.",M1

Symptomatic therapy resolved these symptoms after three days, but they recurred on recommencing trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid revealed aseptic meningitis. These episodes were thought to be induced by trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole.

Similar to other opportunistic pathogens, Pneumocystis causes disease in individuals who are immunocompromised, particularly those infected with HIV. PCP remains the most common opportunistic infection in patients with AIDS. Incidence has decreased greatly with the advent of HAART. However, an increase in the non-HIV immunocompromised population, noncompliance with current treatments, emergence of drug-resistant strains and rise in HIV(+) cases in developing countries makes Pneumocystis a pathogen of continued interest and a public health threat. A great deal of research interest has addressed therapeutic interventions to boost waning immunity in the host to prevent or treat PCP.

Mice depleted of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells prior to infection are markedly protected from PcP-related respiratory deficit and death, despite progressive lung infection. However, the therapeutic effectiveness of Ab-mediated disruption of T cell function in mice already displaying clinical symptoms of disease has not been determined. Therefore, a murine model of PcP-related immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome was used to assess whether Ab to the pan-T cell molecule CD3 is effective for reducing the severity of PcP when administered after the onset of disease. Mice that received anti-CD3 Ab exhibited a rapid and dramatic halt in the PcP-associated pulmonary function decline within 1 week after treatment, and a striking enhancement of survival rate compared with mice receiving the control Ab. Physiologic improvement in anti-CD3 treated mice was associated with a significant reduction in the number of CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells recovered in lung lavage fluid. This effectiveness of anti-CD3 was noted whether the mice also received antibiotic therapy with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. These data suggest that monoclonal Ab-mediated disruption of T cell function may represent a specific and effective adjunctive therapy to rapidly reverse the ongoing pathologic immune response occurring during active PcP. Thus, the anti-human CD3 monoclonal Ab OKT3, which is already in clinical use, has the potential to be developed as an adjunctive therapy for PcP.",M1

Knowing the different characteristics and outcomes of PCP according to HIV status would help physicians manage and treat patients with PCP. METHODS: The medical charts of all patients with a proven first episode of PCP, diagnosed between 1997 and 2007 were retrospectively reviewed, and clinical and laboratory data abstracted. RESULTS: Of the 35 patients with PCP, 18 were HIV-positive and 17 were HIV-negative with other immunosuppressive conditions. HIV-negative patients were significantly older than HIV-positive patients. The WCC (10 952 +/- 5669 vs 9750 +/- 3133/microL; P = 0.015), neutrophil counts (9631 +/- 5421 vs 5680 +/- 2628/microL; P = 0.01) and CD4+ lymphocyte counts (329 +/- 502 vs 47 +/- 50/microL; P &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in HIV-negative patients.

OBJECTIVE: To determine whether PJP prophylaxis is required in the non-human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS) immunocompromised patient and, if so, the optimal prophylactic therapy. METHODS: A thorough literature review, with the appropriate MeSH terms, was conducted using PubMed, Medline, and The Cochrane Database. A number of cases describing PJP in patients with various systemic diseases and immunosuppressive medications, along with a Cochrane review, were highlighted. RESULTS: Although there are a number of case reports in the literature, the only collagen vascular disease with an increased incidence of PJP is Wegener granulomatosis. Oral trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole continues to be the prophylaxis of choice for PJP. CONCLUSION: There is currently no evidence to recommend PJP prophylaxis in the non-HIV/AIDS immunocompromised population. If physicians do decide to use prophylaxis, they should always weigh the benefits with the potential risks. Further studies are needed to better quantify the risks of PJP with immunosuppressive medications.",M1

Few data exist to guide the choice of second-line therapy for patients failing or developing toxicity to first-line therapy. METHODS: A case note review of 1122 patients with 1188 episodes of HIV-associated PCP from three observational cohorts in Copenhagen, London and Milan, between 1989 and 2004, was conducted. RESULTS: Trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (962 PCP episodes, 81%) was the most frequently used first-line therapy, followed by intravenous pentamidine (87 episodes, 7%), clindamycin/primaquine (72 episodes, 6%) and 'other' (atovaquone, dapsone/pyrimethamine, trimetrexate or inhaled pentamidine; 67 episodes, 6%). Rates of unchanged therapy were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole = 79%, clindamycin/primaquine = 65% and pentamidine = 60% (P &lt; 0.001). First-line therapy was changed because of failure in 82 (7%) episodes and because of toxicity in 198 (17%) episodes. Three month survival rates were trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole = 85%, clindamycin/primaquine = 81% and pentamidine = 76% (P = 0.09). After adjustment for possible confounders, pentamidine was associated with a significantly greater risk of death at 3 months [hazard ratio (HR) = 2.0, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.2-3.4]. Second-line therapy survival rates differed: trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole = 85%; clindamycin/primaquine = 87%; and pentamidine = 60% (P = 0.01). Multivariable time-updated Cox regression analysis showed a greater risk of death associated with pentamidine (HR = 3.3, 95% CI = 2.2-5.0), but not for clindamycin/primaquine, when both were compared with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. CONCLUSIONS: Pentamidine was associated with a greater risk of death when used as first- and second-line therapy for HIV-associated PCP, and was associated with more treatment changes. Clindamycin/primaquine appeared superior to pentamidine as second-line therapy for PCP in patients failing or developing toxicity with trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. In patients failing first-line treatment with non-trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole regimens, second-line therapy should be trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole.",M1

Hypercalcemia (HCa) is not a classic symptom of the disease. However, HCa (mean [SD; range], 2.90 [0.20; 2.71-3.17] mmol/L) was detected in 5 patients with PJP at diagnosis. The HCa was associated with decreased concentrations of circulating parathormone (PTH), from 294 (292) ng/L 3 to 6 months previously to 20 (23.5; 7-53) ng/L. Concentrations of 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D, measured in 3 patients, were in the high normal range (54.66 [7.23; 225-66] microg/L), whereas 25-(OH) vitamin D concentrations were low (13.9 [2.17; 20-60] microg/L). After treatment with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole for 21 days, 4 patients recovered and 1 died. Calcium and PTH concentrations rapidly returned to normal (2.36 [0.05] mmol/L and 89 [29.7] ng/L, respectively) at 2 months after the acute phase of the disease. Although fewer than 10 cases of PJP-associated HCa have been reported to date, it is possible that this association is more frequent than previously thought because our cases were detected during 2 years. As in other granulomatous disease-induced HCa, including fungal infections, it is likely that endogenous extrarenal production of 1-alpha-hydroxylase by activated macrophages and by interferon-gamma involved in granuloma formation results in increased conversion from 25-(OH) vitamin D to 1,25-(OH)2 vitamin D and, consequently, in transient HCa and suppression of PTH secretion. Fortuitous detection of HCa in transplant recipients with pulmonary symptoms must raise suspicion of PJP or fungal infection.",M1
19857716,"Procalcitonin serum concentration during <e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci colonization or Pseudomonas aeruginosa infection/colonization in lung transplant recipients.BACKGROUND: Allograft infection after lung transplantation (OLT) has a significant impact on outcomes and represents a diagnostic challenge. Pneumocystis jirovecii causes an opportunistic infection, life-threatening pneumonia among immunocompromised patients. Airway colonization with Pseudomonas aeruginosa is common in lung transplant recipients. The aim of the study was to evaluate procalcitonin (PCT) serum concentrations during P jiroveci and P aeruginosa colonization/infections in lung transplant recipients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifteen OLT patients were retrospectively enrolled into the study (10 men and 5 women) of overall mean age of 41.4 +/- 14.6 years. In seven patients, P jiroveci cysts were diagnosed (group J) and in 13 patients, we isolated P aeruginosa (group A). In respiratory samples, P jiroveci was detected using an indirect immunofluorescence method, and P aeruginosa was isolated using routine microbiologic methods. PCT was measured using immunoluminescence assay. RESULTS: The average PCT value in group A was 0.30 +/- 0.21 and in group J, 0.88 +/- 0.43, a difference that was not significant. In group A, 3 patients (23.1%) has PCT values indicating moderate infection risk (PCT &gt; 0.5) and one patient (7.7%), a high infection risk (PCT &gt; 2.0 and &lt;10). In group J, three patients (42.9%) has PCT values indicating moderate and one patient (14.3%), high infection risk. CONCLUSIONS: Bronchial tree colonization with P jiroveci as well as P aeruginosa colonization can be associated with increased PCT suggesting a general, systemic response in addition to local colonization.",M1

OBJECTIVE: We sought to describe the frequency of PCP among dermatologic patients receiving immunosuppression for immunobullous disease or connective tissue disease. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the cases of patients with immunobullous and connective tissue disease at our department of dermatology between 1980 and 2006 who received immunosuppression and had subsequent development of pneumonia. We recorded patient characteristics, use of PCP prophylaxis, whether PCP developed, and if so, their morbidity and mortality. RESULTS: Of 334 patients identified, 7 (2.1%) were given the diagnosis of PCP during immunosuppressive treatment. Of these 7 patients, 3 (43%) died within 1 month of diagnosis, and none received PCP prophylaxis. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective study design and limited patient group are limitations.

OBJECTIVES: To measure mortality, identify predictors of mortality at time of illness presentation and derive a PCP mortality prediction rule that stratifies patients by risk for mortality. METHODS: An observational cohort study with case note review of all HIV-infected persons with a laboratory diagnosis of PCP at San Francisco General Hospital from 1997 to 2006. RESULTS: 451 patients were diagnosed with PCP on 524 occasions. In-hospital mortality was 10.3%. Multivariate analysis identified five significant predictors of mortality: age (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) per 10-year increase, 1.69; 95% CI 1.08 to 2.65; p = 0.02); recent injection drug use (AOR 2.86; 95% CI 1.28 to 6.42; p = 0.01); total bilirubin &gt;0.6 mg/dl (AOR 2.59; 95% CI 1.19 to 5.62; p = 0.02); serum albumin &lt;3 g/dl (AOR 3.63; 95% CI 1.72-7.66; p = 0.001); and alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient &gt;or=50 mm Hg (AOR 3.02; 95% CI 1.41 to 6.47; p = 0.004).

19805570,"Polyamine transport as a target for treatment of <e>Pneumocystis</e> pneumonia.Polyamine levels are greatly increased in alveolar macrophages (AMs) during Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP), leading to increased production of H(2)O(2), which causes AMs to undergo apoptosis. One of the mechanisms by which polyamine levels in AMs are elevated is enhanced uptake of exogenous polyamines. In this study, the possibility of targeting polyamine uptake as a treatment for PCP was examined. Four anthracene- and one benzene-polyamine conjugates that are potential polyamine transport inhibitors, including N1-anthracen-9-ylmethyl-butane-1,4-diamine; N-(4-aminobutyl)-N-anthracen-9-ylmethylbutane-1,4-diamine; N-[4-(4-aminobutylamino)butyl]-N-anthracen-9-ylmethylbutane-1,4-diamine; N-(4-amino-butyl)-N'-(10-[[4-(4-amino-butylamino)butylamino]-methyl]anthracen-9-ylmethyl)butane-1,4-diamine (44-Ant-44); and benzene-polyamine conjugate N-(4-amino-butyl)-N'-(4-[[4-(4-amino-butylamino)butylamino]-methyl]benzyl)butane-1,4-diamine (44-Bn-44), were tested. Compounds 44-Ant-44 and 44-Bn-44 were found to have a very low toxicity to AMs in vitro and were evaluated for their therapeutic effect on PCP in vivo. Sprague-Dawley rats infected with P. carinii for 28 days were intranasally instilled with 50 microl of a 1 mM solution of 44-Bn-44 or 44-Ant-44 every 2 days. Twenty-one days after initiation of the treatment, three to five rats from each group were sacrificed and examined for lung pathology, organism burden, and apoptosis of AMs. Both 44-Bn-44 and 44-Ant-44 reduced organism burdens; however, only 44-Ant-44 decreased the severity of the infection with reduced lung inflammation, increased clearance of exudates, increased air space, and decreased apoptosis of AMs. 44-Ant-44 also significantly prolonged the survival of treated animals.

We have developed a typing method for Pneumocystis jirovecii that is based on restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis after polymerase chain reaction amplification of an approximately 1300 base-pair region of the msg gene family, which comprises an estimated 50-100 genes/genome. The RFLP pattern was reproducible in samples containing &gt;1000 msg copies/reaction and was stable over time, based on analysis of serial samples from the same patient. In our initial analysis of 48 samples, we found that samples obtained from different individuals showed distinct banding patterns; only samples obtained from the same patient showed an identical RFLP pattern. Despite this substantial diversity, samples tended to cluster on the basis of country of origin. In an evaluation of samples obtained from an outbreak of PCP in kidney transplant recipients in Germany, RFLP analysis demonstrated identical patterns in samples that were from 12 patients previously linked to this outbreak, as well as from 2 additional patients. Our results highlight the presence of a remarkable diversity in human Pneumocystis strains.

RESULTS: Of the 615 sputum specimens, P. jirovecii positive rates of PCR and GMS stain were 20.3% and 10.2% respectively (P &lt; 0.05). Of 236 BALF specimens, P. jirovecii positive rates of PCR and GMS stain were 32.6% and 25.5% respectively (P &gt; 0.05). Of the total 851 pneumonia cases, 123 (14.5%) were GMS positive for P. jirovecii cyst and 202 cases (23.7%) were PCR positive for P. jirovecii DNA. In those immuno-suppressed patient group including patients with connective tissue diseases, organ transplant recipients, nephrotic, hematologic diseases and malignant tumor, P. jirovecii positive rate appeared the highest, 28.2% for GMS stain and 39.4% for PCR.

The double-sandwich ELISA for galactomannan is reported to have a high sensitivity (96.5%) for the detection of invasive aspergillosis when a cut-off value of 0.8 ng/ml is used. However, we have experienced a case of lethal disseminated aspergillosis in a patient that presented with a negative galactomannan (GM) test and persistent elevation of beta-D glucan (BG) levels. A 63-year-old female was admitted to our Intensive Care Unit (ICU) in acute respiratory failure and elevated BG. She had been receiving medication for Good-pasture syndrome based on anti-glomerular basement membrane antibodies and myeloperoxidase-antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies for 9 months and was receiving long-term prednisolone therapy (20 mg/day). On admission, her trachea was immediately intubated, and a PCR analysis of the bronchoalveolar lavage sample revealed Pneumocystis jiroveci. Trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole therapy was started for Pneumocystis pneumonia. The levels of BG remained elevated (&gt; 100 pg/ml) during the treatment period despite the clinical resolution of Pneumocystis pneumonia, raising concerns of another complicated invasive fungal disease; consequently, fosfluconazole was administered empirically. The serum BG levels, however, did not decrease. Blood cultures did not detect a fungal infection. Serum GM levels measured by a double-sandwich ELISA on the 6th, 11th, and 24th days in the ICU were negative (&lt; 0.2 ng/ml). The patient ultimately died of multiple organ failure on the 45th ICU day. Postmortem examination revealed a disseminated fungal infection with aggressive vascular invasion of the lungs, heart, and brain. In situ hybridization with a 568-bp probe of the alkaline proteinase sequence of Aspergillus fumigatus showed specific positive staining within the fungus present in the infected lung tissue, revealing that this patient may have had a systemic infection by A. fumigatus or A. flavus. This is a case of serum GM-negative disseminated aspergillosis pathologically proven by autopsy. Persistent elevated BG levels (&gt; 100 pg/ml) refractory to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and fosfluconazole may suggest possible Aspergillus infection and should prompt the initiation of empiric anti-aspergillosis therapies in patients at risk for fungal infection.",M1

Nine patients fulfilled the criteria for PCP protective therapy provided by Ministry of Health Labor and Welfare, and 7 of them died of respiratory failure. The frequency of PCP remarkably decreased in our hospital after we had started the protective therapy with ST using the criteria, suggesting that it is effective for the protection of PCP. However, some patients who do not fulfill the criteria may acquire severe PCP.",M1

19710347,"<e>Pneumocystis</e>-associated organizing pneumonia as a manifestation of immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome in an HIV-infected individual with a normal CD4+ T-cell count following antiretroviral therapy.We describe a rare case of Pneumocystic jirovecii-associated organizing pneumonia (PJP) in an HIV-infected individual on highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with a CD4(+) T-cell count of 835 x 10(3) cells/mL and a low viral load. PJP was confirmed using transbronchial biopsies and bronchoalveolar lavage. The presentation in this patient suggests immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) after institution of antiretroviral therapy (ART). This case report, however, is the first documented presentation of PJP in a patient with CD4 count greater than 300 prior to the induction of HAART who developed PJP and organizing pneumonia as a manifestation of IRIS. This suggests that there is continuing immune dysfunction in the face of re-expansion of CD4(+) T-cells and low viral load in HIV patients despite ART.",M1

19673964,"Linking <e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci sulfamethoxazole resistance to the alleles of the DHPS gene using functional complementation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.Curative and prophylactic therapy for Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia relies mainly on cotrimoxazole, an association of trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (SMX). SMX inhibits the folic acid pathway through competition with para-aminobenzoic acid (pABA), one of the two substrates of the dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS), a key enzyme in de novo folic acid synthesis. The most frequent non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in P. jiroveci DHPS are seen at positions 165 and 171, the combination leading to four possible different genetic alleles. A number of reports correlate prophylaxis failure and mutation in the P. jiroveci DHPS but, because of the impossibility of reliably cultivating P. jiroveci, the link between DHPS mutation(s) and SMX susceptibility is not definitively proven. To circumvent this limitation, the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae was used as a model. The introduction of the P. jiroveci DHPS gene, with or without point mutations, directly amplified from a clinical specimen and cloned in a centromeric plasmid into a DHPS-deleted yeast strain, allowed a fully effective complementation. However, in the presence of SMX at concentrations &gt;250 mg/L, yeasts complemented with the double mutated allele showed a lower susceptibility compared with strains complemented with either a single mutated allele or wild-type alleles. These results confirm the need for prospective study of pneumocystosis, including systematic determination of the DHPS genotype, to clarify further the impact of mutations on clinical outcome. Additionally, the S. cerevisiae model proves to be useful for the study of still uninvestigated biological properties of P. jiroveci.",M1
19667941,"Outbreak of <e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci pneumonia in renal transplant recipients: P. jiroveci is contagious to the susceptible host.BACKGROUND: Prophylaxis against Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) is only recommended during some periods after renal transplantation. Recent advances in immunosuppressive therapy have considerably reduced acute rejection. However, the reported PCP outbreaks are increasing in renal transplant recipients. METHODS: Only three sporadic PCP cases had occurred since 1976 in our Renal Transplant Unit until the index case in July 2004. A PCP outbreak of 27 cases occurred mainly in the outpatient clinic within 1 year, followed by six additional cases during the next 3 years. Molecular analysis of P. jiroveci and surveys of reservoir were performed. RESULTS: Molecular analysis documented that all cases were caused by the same strain. Among 27 cases of the outbreak, human-to-human transmissions were traceable in 22 cases based on dates of outpatient clinic visits and in four cases during hospitalization. Based on the confirmed cases, airborne transmission was suspected with an estimated median PCP incubation period of 53 days (range 7-188 days). Surveys for reservoir of P. jiroveci identified asymptomatic carriers and environmental contamination. Some sporadic cases might be caused by reservoirs. Among the 33 cases, none had received PCP prophylaxis, 22 cases had PCP over 12 months, and six cases over 10 years after renal transplantation. CONCLUSION: On documentation of a PCP case, we recommend PCP prophylaxis for a maximum period of 6 months (upper limit of incubation period) in all renal transplant recipients including those on regular maintenance immunosuppressive therapy.",M1

19656784,"Influence of concomitant prednisolone on trimethoprim-associated hyperkalaemia.OBJECTIVES: Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole may cause hyperkalaemia by the amiloride-like effect of trimethoprim on sodium channels in the distal nephron. Hyperkalaemia usually occurs after 7-10 days and has been reported in 20%-50% of patients receiving trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Patients with <e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci pneumonia and severe hypoxaemia benefit from the use of prednisolone as an adjuvant to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. The addition of prednisolone may lower the incidence of trimethoprim-related hyperkalaemia due, in part, to its mineralocorticoid activity. We studied the effect of concomitant prednisolone on trimethoprim-related hyperkalaemia. PATIENTS: Thirty patients qualified for inclusion and were reviewed. Patients were divided into two groups: one group received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus prednisolone (18 patients); and the other group received trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone (12 patients). RESULTS: The two groups were comparable at baseline, except for the severity of the P. jiroveci pneumonia. Hyperkalaemia developed in seven patients: all in the prednisolone and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole group. The greater incidence of hyperkalaemia in this group is surprising and was counter to our expectation. CONCLUSIONS: Although it is possible that there is an unexplained interaction between trimethoprim and prednisolone, we postulate that our observation is a result of the catabolic effect of prednisolone. The patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole plus prednisolone appear to be more likely to develop hyperkalaemia than patients treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole alone.",M1

For the study, 65 patients-liquidators with diagnosed pneumonia, 44 liquidators with chronic bronchitis and 34 with bronchial asthma were examined. The control group was included 65 patients with pneumonia, 44 with chronic bronchitis, 34 with bronchial asthma which were unlinked with radionucleotide aggression. Mean age in main group was 46,9 and in control group- 47,6 years old. Main and control groups were randomized by sexual characteristics also. Serologic examinations were performed by the ELISA (enzyme-linked immunoSorbent assay) and method of immunofluorescent detection of P.carinii. Circulation of pneumocystosis etiologic agent among patients-liquidators of accident consequences in the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant with different bronchopulmonary pathology was established and high percentage of seropositivity was revealed. Overall these data revealed high probability of Pneumocystis carini/jiroveci in the etiology of bronchopulmonary pathology among liquidators of accident consequences in the the Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant. Even among immunocompromised patients, liquidators of accident consequences, represent an exclusive group, that is in risk for activation of latent infection or new infection with P. carini/jiroveci.

METHODS: Analyses of this patient cohort were conducted using the YRG Centre for AIDS Research and Education HIV Natural History Observational Database. Causes of death were then individually confirmed by patient chart review. RESULTS: Sixty-nine deaths occurred within the inpatient unit; 25% were female and the median age of the 69 patients was 34 years. Over half of the patients (55%) died within three months of initiating HAART. At the time of enrollment into clinical care, the median CD4 cell count was 64 cells/microl (interquartile range (IQR) 37-134). At the time of initiating HAART, the median CD4 cell count was 58 cells/microl (IQR 31-67) for patients who died within 3 months of initiating HAART and 110 cells/microl (IQR 77-189) for patients who died more than 3 months after initiating HAART. Close to three-fourths of patients (70%) died from an AIDS-defining illness (ADI). The major ADI causes of death included <e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci pneumonia (22%), extrapulmonary tuberculosis (19%), CNS toxoplasmosis (12%), and pulmonary tuberculosis (10%). A tenth of patients died from cerebrovascular infarcts. Three patients (4%) died from non-Hodgkin lymphoma.

Positive rates of PCR and GMS staining in sputum specimens were 21.1% and 9.5%, respectively (P &lt; 0.01), and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), specimens were 31.9% and 25.5%, respectively. Among 5 patient groups, the highest GMS staining and PCR positive rates were observed in immunosuppressed patients. In 28 GMS staining-positive patients, positive rates of PCR and GMS staining after a short anti-PCP treatment were 39.3% and 17.9%, respectively. In 5 patients with positive PCR but negative GMS staining results in initial sputum examination, GMS staining result turned positive in subsequent BAL specimens.

METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study of 32,757 Medicare primary transplant recipients in the United States Renal Data System from January 1, 2000 through July 31, 2004. PCP infection was defined by Medicare claims using International Classification of Disease, 9th Revision codes. The incidence of PCP infections, graft loss, and death were measured. RESULTS: There were a total of 142 cases (cumulative incidence 0.4%) of PCP after kidney transplantation during the study period. By using multivariate analysis with Cox regression, expanded criteria donor, donation after cardiac death, and earlier year of transplant were associated with development of PCP disease. Induction immunosuppression and acute rejections were not associated with risk for PCP infections. However, based on adjusted hazard ratio (AHR), maintenance immunosuppression regimens containing the combination of tacrolimus and sirolimus (AHR 3.60, confidence interval [CI] 2.03-6.39), Neoral and mycophenolate mofetil (AHR 2.09, CI 1.31-3.31), and sirolimus and mycophenolate mofetil (AHR 2.77, CI 1.40-5.47), were associated with development of PCP. As a time dependent variable, PCP was associated with an increased risk of both graft loss and death. CONCLUSION: PCP infections are rare in the modern era of prophylaxis; however, these infections are a serious risk factor for graft loss and patient death, in particular, in patients who are on sirolimus as part of the immunosuppressive regimen. The median time to development of PCP after transplant was 0.80+/-0.95 years, suggesting a longer period of PCP prophylaxis.",M1
19558669,"Lymphocyte apoptosis in murine <e>Pneumocystis</e> pneumonia.BACKGROUND: Apoptosis of lymphocytes is important in the termination of an immune response to infection but has also been shown to have detrimental effects in animal models of systemic infection and sepsis. We sought to characterize lymphocyte apoptosis in an animal model of pneumonia due to Pneumocystis murina, an infection localized to the lungs. METHODS: Control mice and mice depleted of CD4+ lymphocytes were inoculated with Pneumocystis. Apoptosis of lung and spleen lymphocytes was assayed by flow cytometry and PCR assay of apoptotic proteins. RESULTS: In control mice, apoptosis of lung lymphocytes was maximal just after the infection was cleared from lung tissue and then declined. However, in CD4-depleted mice, apoptosis was also upregulated in recruited lymphocytes in spite of progressive infection. In splenic lymphocytes, apoptosis was observed early at 1 week after inoculation and then declined. Apoptosis of lung lymphocytes in control mice was associated with a decrease in mRNA for Bcl-2 and an increase in mRNA for Bim. In CD4-depleted mice, lavaged CD8+ cells did change intracellular Bcl-2 but showed increased mRNA for Bim. CONCLUSION: Apoptosis of both pulmonary and extrapulmonary lymphocytes is part of the normal host response to Pneumocystis but is also triggered in CD4-deficient animals with progressive infection. In normal mice apoptosis of pulmonary lymphocytes may serve to terminate the immune response in lung tissue. Apoptosis of lung lymphocytes takes place via both the intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways and is associated with changes in both pro- and anti-apoptotic proteins.",M1

The observation of several cases with reduced increase of CD4-cells upon start of antiretroviral treatment (ART) prompted us to investigate the topic using the ClinSurv cohort. METHODS: 17 German HIV treatment centers contribute to ClinSurv, a multicentre observational cohort under the auspices of the Robert Koch Institute. We retrospectively selected all antiretroviral-naive patients with toxoplasmic encephalitis (TE) and - as comparator group - with pneumocystosis (PCP) between January 1999 and December 2005. RESULTS: A total of 257 patients were included in the analysis, 61 with TE and 196 with PCP. Demographic baseline data showed differences with regard to gender, transmission group, and baseline CD4 superset+ counts (60.9 vs. 44.7/microl, p = 0.022). After ART-initiation the increase in CD4 superset+ lymphocytes was lower in the TE- versus the PCP-group in the first, second and fourth three-month-period (74.4 vs. 120.3/microl, p = 0.006; 96.6 vs. 136.2/microl, p = 0.021; 156.5 vs. 211.5/microl, p = 0.013). Viral load (VL) was higher in the PCP-group at baseline (4.46 log subset10cop/ml vs. 5.00 log subset10cop/ml, p = 0.008), while virological success of ART was equal. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show for the first time that the average CD4 superset+ T-cell increase of patients with toxoplasmosis is impaired compared to PCP-patients. Most clinicians would not be prepared to discontinue follow-up TE-therapy unless CD4 superset+ counts of 200/microl are reached. Explanation for our finding might be the myelosuppressive side effect of pyrimethamine, possible interactions of toxoplasmosis therapy with ART, or an unknown direct biological influence of toxoplasmosis on immune restoration.",M1
19521925,"Severity and outcomes of <e>Pneumocystis</e> pneumonia in patients newly diagnosed with HIV infection: an observational cohort study.It is unclear whether patients who are unaware of their HIV infection have different severity or outcomes of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) compared to patients who have been previously diagnosed with HIV. In this retrospective observational cohort study of consecutive HIV-infected patients with microscopically diagnosed PCP at San Francisco General Hospital between 1997 and 2006, 121 of 522 patients (23%) were unaware of their HIV infection prior to their diagnosis of PCP. The proportion of patients with concurrently diagnosed HIV and PCP each year remained unchanged during the study period. Patients with newly diagnosed HIV had a significantly higher alveolar-arterial oxygen gradient at presentation (median 51 vs 45 mm Hg, p =0.03), but there were no differences in mortality, frequency of mechanical ventilation, or admission to intensive care compared to patients with previously diagnosed HIV infection. In multivariate analysis, patients who reported a sexual risk factor for HIV infection were more likely to be newly diagnosed with HIV than patients who reported injection drug use as their only HIV risk factor (odds ratio = 3.14, 95% CI 1.59-6.18, p=0.001).

Assessments of key prosurvival molecules in Amø and bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from infected rats and mice showed low levels of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and reduced activation of phosphoinositide-3 kinase (PI-3K). Ubiquitous calcium-sensing protein calmodulin protein and mRNA levels were also reduced in Amø during Pneumocystis pneumonia (Pcp). Calmodulin has been implicated in control of GM-CSF production and PI-3K activation in other immune cell types. Experiments to determine the control of GM-CSF and PI-3K by calmodulin in Amø showed that GM-CSF expression and PI-3K activation could not be induced when calmodulin was inhibited. Calmodulin inhibition also led to increased levels of ROS and apoptosis in cells exposed to bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from infected animals. Supplementation of Amø with exogenous calmodulin increased survival signaling via GM-CSF and PI-3K and reduced ROS and apoptosis. These data support the hypotheses that calmodulin levels at least partially control survival signaling in Amø and that restoration of GM-CSF or PI-3K signaling will improve host response to the organism.",M1

19400763,"Management of community-acquired pneumonia in HIV-infected children.Pneumonia is a major cause of childhood mortality and morbidity worldwide, particularly in low-income countries. Often, these are also the countries most affected by the HIV epidemic. Pneumonia is the leading cause of death in HIV-infected children and a major cause of hospitalization and healthcare utilization. A broader spectrum of organisms, such as <e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci and Gram-negative bacteria, cause pneumonia in HIV-infected children compared with uninfected children. Etiologic organisms have higher rates of antimicrobial resistance in HIV-infected children. Polymicrobial disease is more common in HIV-infected children and associated with an exponential increase in mortality rate. HIV-infected children develop more severe pneumonia and have a worse outcome than HIV-uninfected children. HIV-exposed but HIV-negative children are also at higher risk of severe pneumonia and death compared with HIV-unexposed children. Although case-management guidelines for childhood pneumonia have led to an overall decrease in global childhood morbidity and mortality, HIV-infected children continue to have unacceptably high treatment failure and case fatality rates despite adherence to these guidelines. Standard guidelines require adaptation for use in high HIV-prevalence areas. Specific preventive interventions, including chemoprophylaxis for P. jiroveci pneumonia or for TB and early initiation of highly active antiretroviral therapy, may significantly reduce the burden of pneumonia in HIV-infected children.",M1

Pneumocystis pneumonia causes interstitial changes, so making a diagnosis of PCP in patients who have interstitial pneumonia (IP) with P. jirovecii colonization is sometimes difficult based on radiography. METHODS: This study investigated the prevalence of P. jirovecii colonization in IP patients and assessed pulmonary injury due to P. jirovecii colonization by measurement of serum markers (KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, and (1--&gt;3) beta-D-glucan (beta-D-glucan)) and the peripheral lymphocyte counts, prospectively. A total of 75 patients with idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (n = 29), collagen vascular-related interstitial pneumonia (n = 19), chronic bronchitis or pneumonia (n = 20), and Pneumocystis pneumonia (n = 7) were enrolled in this prospective study. P. jirovecii DNA was detected in sputum samples, while serum markers and the lymphocyte count were measured in the peripheral blood. RESULTS: IP patients (idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and collagen vascular-related IP) who received oral corticosteroids had a high prevalence of P. jirovecii colonization (23.3%). In IP patients, oral corticosteroid therapy was a significant risk factor for P. jirovecii colonization (P &lt; 0.05). Serum markers did not show differences between IP patients with and without P. jirovecii colonization. The beta-D-glucan level and lymphocyte count differed between patients with Pneumocystis pneumonia or P. jirovecii colonization. CONCLUSION: Serum levels of KL-6, SP-A, SP-D, and beta-D-glucan were not useful for detecting P. jirovecii colonization in IP patients.

19370790,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci pneumonia and pneumomediastinum in an anti-TNFalpha naive patient with ulcerative colitis.We report the case of a 21-year-old man who was noted to have pneumomediastinum during an admission for an acute flare of ulcerative colitis. At that time, he was on maintenance treatment with azathioprine at a dose of 1.25 mg/kg per day, and had not received supplementary steroids for 9 mo. He had never received anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)alpha therapy. Shortly after apparently effective treatment with intravenous steroids and an increased dose of azathioprine, he developed worsening colitic and new respiratory symptoms, and was diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci (carinii) pneumonia (PCP). Pneumomediastinum is rare in immunocompetent hosts, but is a recognized complication of PCP in human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients, although our patient's HIV test was negative. Treatment of PCP with co-trimoxazole resulted in resolution of both respiratory and gastrointestinal symptoms, without the need to increase the steroid dose. There is increasing vigilance for opportunistic infections in patients with inflammatory bowel disease following the advent of anti-TNFalpha therapy. This case emphasizes the importance of considering the possibility of such infections in all patients with inflammatory bowel disease, irrespective of the immunosuppressants they receive, and highlights the potential of steroid-responsive opportunistic infections to mimic worsening colitic symptoms in patients with ulcerative colitis.",M1

We describe factors associated with nonadherence to primary PCP prophylaxis. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We used 2000-2004 data from the Supplement to HIV/AIDS Surveillance (SHAS) project, a cross-sectional interview project of HIV-infected persons &gt;or=18 years conducted in 18 states. We limited the analysis to persons who denied having prior PCP, reported having a current prescription to prevent PCP, and answered the question  In the past 30 days, how often were you able to take the PCP medication(s) exactly the way your doctor told you to take them?  We used multivariable logistic regression to describe factors associated with nonadherence. Of 1,666 subjects prescribed PCP prophylaxis, 305 (18.3%) were nonadherent. Persons were more likely to be nonadherent if they reported using marijuana (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.1-2.4), non-injection drugs other than marijuana (aOR = 1.5, 95% CI = 1.0-2.1), or injection drugs (aOR = 2.3, 95% CI = 1.3-4.1) in the past year; their mental health was  not good  for &gt;or=1 day during the past month (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.2-2.2); their most recent CD4 count was &lt;200 cells/microL (aOR = 1.6, 95% CI = 1.1-2.2); or taking ART usually (aOR = 9.6, 95% CI = 6.7-13.7) or sometimes/rarely/never (aOR = 18.4, 95% CI = 11.1-30.4), compared with always, as prescribed. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Providers should inquire about and promote strategies to improve adherence to PCP prophylaxis, particularly among persons who use illicit drugs, have mental health issues, and who are not compliant with ART to reduce the occurrence of PCP.",M1

METHODS: We examined the sequential serologic responses to recombinant Msg carboxyl terminus fragments (MsgC1, MsgC3, MsgC8, and MsgC9) by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay in a cohort of individuals with HIV infection for the 5.5 years before death and autopsy. Analyses included mean antibody levels by status at death (Pneumocystis pneumonia, P. jirovecii colonization, or neither), factors associated with high antibody levels, and antibody responses before and after active Pneumocystis pneumonia. RESULTS: Patients who died from Pneumocystis pneumonia had higher levels of antibody to MsgC8 than did patients who died from other causes. Previous episode of Pneumocystis pneumonia, geographic location, and age were independent predictors of high levels of anitbodies to most or all Msgs. Failure to take Pneumocystis pneumonia prophylaxis was associated with high levels of antibody to MsgC1. Patients who developed and recovered from active Pneumocystis pneumonia during the study exhibited an increase in serum antibody levels that persisted for months after the infection, whereas patients who developed another acquired immunodeficiency syndrome-defining illness did not. CONCLUSIONS: Serum antibodies to Msgs are important markers of P. jirovecii infection in patients with HIV infection and are influenced by host and environmental factors in complex ways.",M1

METHODS: We compared P jiroveci PCR and conventional stains in HIV-uninfected immunocompromised patients. RESULTS: Among the 448 patients, 296 (66%) patients had hematologic malignancies; 72 (16.1%), bone marrow transplants; 44 (9.8%), solid tumors; 21 (4.7%), renal transplants; and 15 (3.4%) were taking immunosuppressants for systemic diseases. Diagnostic strategy consisted of BAL in 351 patients and induced sputum (IS) in 97 patients. Conventional pneumocystic pneumonia (PCP) stain was positive in 39 (8.7%) patients, including 34 with positive PCR. In addition, PCR was positive in 32 patients, including 21 with complete follow-up, of whom 14 were diagnosed with probable or definitive PCP (a 36% increase). PCR was 87.2% sensitive and 92.2% specific; positive and negative predictive values were 51.5% and 98.7%, respectively. Sensitivity and negative predictive value were 100% on IS.

To elucidate the clinical presentation and outcome of this disease in Taiwan, we analyzed the patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia during a 34-month period. METHODS: We collected data retrospectively from patients with P. jirovecii pneumonia at a medical center in northern Taiwan between January 2004 and October 2006. The diagnosis was made by nested polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis of expectorated sputum. Demographics, clinical characteristics, laboratory findings, and outcomes were compared between patients with and without human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection. RESULTS: Forty nine patients were included in this study. The most common underlying diseases were HIV and malignancies. The mean (+/- standard deviation) age of the 49 patients was 54 +/- 20.2 years (range, 5 to 96 years). The mean CD4+ T-lymphocyte count was 110 cells/microL (range, 0-670 cells/microL). Although the mean CD4+ T-lymphocyte count of the non-HIV group was higher than that of the HIV group (165 +/- 78 cells/microL vs 57.5 +/- 97 cells/microL), statistical significance was not obtained (p=0.087). Arterial oxygenation (ratio of arterial oxygenation to fraction of inspired oxygen) was less than 200 mm Hg in 28 patients. Lactate dehydrogenase levels were higher than the normal range in 15 patients. A significantly higher proportion of patients died in the group without HIV compared with the HIV-infected patients (17/34 [50.0%] vs 1/15 [6.7%]; p=0.004). CONCLUSION: P. jirovecii pneumonia remains a significant problem for immunocompromised patients. The mortality rate for patients without HIV infection was high (50%). Greater alertness with regard to early detection of P. jirovecii in HIV-negative immunosuppressed patients with the application of nested PCR may improve the clinical management and outcome.",M1
19255292,"Trends in hospitalizations for AIDS-associated <e>Pneumocystis</e> jirovecii Pneumonia in the United States (1986 to 2005).BACKGROUND: Although hospitalizations for AIDS-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (PCP) in the United States have decreased since the introduction of chemoprophylaxis and potent combination antiretroviral therapy (ART), PCP remains an important cause of illness and death among AIDS patients. METHODS: We analyzed trends in AIDS-associated PCP hospital discharges using the National Hospital Discharge Surveys between 1986 and 2005. RESULTS: An estimated 539 million patients were discharged from hospitals between 1986 and 2005, of whom an estimated 312,411 had AIDS-associated PCP. The proportion of patients discharged from the hospital with AIDS-associated PCP decreased from 31% before the introduction of chemoprophylaxis (1986 to 1989) to 17% with chemoprophylaxis (1990 to 1995) and subsequently to 9% after the introduction of ART in 1996 (p &lt; 0.001). Mortality from AIDS-associated PCP decreased from 21 to 16% and subsequently to 7% between these three time periods (p &lt; 0.001). Among those who received mechanical ventilation, mortality decreased from 79% in the prechemoprophylaxis era to 31% in the ART era (p &lt; 0.001) alongside an increase (from 5 to 11%) in the use of mechanical ventilation. We also observed a shift in the population at-risk for PCP over time: a greater proportion of black people, women, and people from Southern states were affected (all p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: While there have been significant reductions in hospitalizations and hospital mortality for AIDS-associated PCP over the last 20 years, these reductions have not been homogenous across demographic subpopulations and geographic regions and point to new at-risk populations. Furthermore, mortality in severe cases of PCP that require mechanical ventilation has improved substantially.",M1
19255271,"Retrospective review of <e>Pneumocystis</e> jirovecii pneumonia over two decades.The aim of the study was to compare a retrospective case note review of all cases of Pneumocystis carinii (now Pneumocystis jirovecii) pneumonia (PJP) over the period 1997-2004 at North Manchester General Hospital with a previous audit covering the years 1986-1995. During 1986-1995, 777 patients were diagnosed with HIV. One hundred and eighty-one were also diagnosed with PJP. Of these, 11 patients required ventilation with a mortality rate of 100%. For the current review during 1997-2004, 210 patients were diagnosed with PJP, and 64 with severe PJP. Median age was 39 years (interquartile range [IQR] 22-61). Twenty-four patients had a prior diagnosis of HIV (median 43 months, IQR 6-72 months), and for 38 patients this was the presenting diagnosis of HIV. Median CD4 was 34 cells/L (IQR of 12-80 cells/L). Median viral load was 3.5 x 10(5) copies/mL (IQR 1-5.8 x 10(5) copies/mL). Eighteen patients required intubation during this period. Nine (50%) were alive at 30 days postextubation. We believe that the 50% reduction in mortality seen between 1997-2004 in intubated patients with severe PJP is due to the improvement in intensive care management of severe respiratory failure rather than changes in the specific management of PJP. The necessity of ventilation in HIV patients is no longer a mandatory death sentence.",M1

PCP has been observed in 0.4% of patients with RA treated with infliximab in Japan. METHODS: Data from patients with RA (n = 21) who were diagnosed with PCP during infliximab treatment and from 102 patients with RA who did not develop PCP during infliximab therapy were collected from 14 rheumatology referral centers in Japan. A retrospective review of these patients and a case-control study to compare patients with and without PCP were performed. RESULTS: The median length of time from the first infliximab infusion to the development of PCP was 8.5 weeks. At the onset of PCP, the median dosages of prednisolone and methotrexate were 7.5 mg/day and 8 mg/week, respectively. Pneumocystis jiroveci was microscopically identified in only 2 patients, although the polymerase chain reaction test for the organism was positive in 20 patients. The patients with PCP had significantly lower serum albumin levels (P &lt; 0.001) and lower serum IgG levels (P &lt; 0.001) than the patients without PCP. Computed tomography of the chest in all patients with PCP revealed ground-glass opacity either with sharp demarcation by interlobular septa or without interlobular septal boundaries. Sixteen of the 21 patients with PCP developed acute respiratory failure, but all survived. CONCLUSION: PCP is a serious complication that may occur early in the course of infliximab therapy in patients with RA. For the proper clinical management of this infectious disease, physicians need to be aware of the possibility of PCP developing during infliximab therapy.",M1

19670532,"[Presence of <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii and Pneumocystis wakefieldiae DNA in the extrapulmonary tissues of immunocompromised laboratory rats]Fungi of the genus Pneumocystis are opportunistic pathogens which cause lethal pneumonia in immunocompromised hosts. Those fungi may also invade other visceral organs where they induce lesions, although, the pathways or mechanisms of the in vivo infection are still unknown. The corticosteroid-treated rat model was used to evaluate the course of extrapulmonary pneumocystosis. Liver, kidney, spleen, and mesenteric lymph nodes of 16 rats were examined for the presence of mtLSU gene fragments of P. carinii and P. wakefieldiae using the nested PCR method. Pneumocystis DNA was detected in 26 organ samples of which 17 contained both species (P. carinii and P. wakefieldiae) and 9 contained only P. carinii. Positive samples were received from 10 rats examined after 6-9 weeks of immunosuppression. The highest percentage of positive samples (62.5%) was obtained among examined visceral lymph nodes. Pneumocystis DNA was detected in the blood serum of two rats with no traces of the DNA in their internal organs. Conversely, Pneumocystis DNA was found in the internal organs of two other rats, although their serum samples were negative. The average number of Pneumocystis cysts in the lungs of animals in which extrapulmonary infection was detected was 3.4 per one microscopic view field. In the case of animals where the infection was limited to the lung tissue this number was almost two times lower (1.8 cysts per one microscopic view field). An analysis of the results of the presently reported experiment showed that massive Pneumocystis infection in the lungs makes it more likely that Pneumocystis will spread to other internal organs. This spread probably takes place via the lymphatic vessels. The extrapulmonary foci may contain either P. carinii alone, or both pathogens: P. carinii and P. wakefieldiae.",M2

It acts by inhibiting the cytochrome bc(1) complex via interactions with the Rieske iron-sulfur protein and cytochrome b in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket. As the targeted pathogens have developed resistance to this drug there is an urgent need for new alternatives. To better understand the determinants of inhibitor binding in the ubiquinol oxidation pocket of the bc(1) complex we synthesized a series of hydroxy-naphthoquinones bearing a methyl group on the benzene ring that is predicted to interact with the nuclear encoded Rieske iron-sulfur protein. We have also attempted to overcome the metabolic instability of a potent cytochrome bc(1) complex inhibitor, a 2-hydroxy-naphthoquinone with a branched side chain, by fluorinating the terminal methyl group. We have tested these new 2-hydroxy-naphthoquinones against yeast and bovine cytochrome bc(1) complexes to model the interaction with pathogen and human enzymes and determine parameters that affect efficacy of binding of these inhibitors.

Although most fungi developing in animals do not complete a sexual cycle in vivo, Pneumocystis species constitute one of a few exceptions. Recently, the molecular identification of several key players in the fungal mating pathway has provided further evidence for the existence of conjugation and meiosis in Pneumocystisorganisms. Dynamic follow-up of stage-to-stage transition as well as studies of stage-specific proteins and/or genes would provide a better understanding of the still hypothetical Pneumocystislife cycle.

Pneumocystis pathogenic fungi, which are transmitted from host-to-host via an airborne route, have been shown to constitute genuine host markers of evolution. These parasites can also provide valuable information about their host ecology. Here, we suggest that parasites can be used as phylogeographic markers to understand the geographical distribution of intra-specific host genetic variants. To test our hypothesis, we characterised Pneumocystis isolates from wild bats living in different areas. Bats comprise a wide variety of species; some of them are able to migrate. Thus, bat chorology and migration behaviour can be approached using Pneumocystis as phylogeographic markers. In the present work, we find that the genetic polymorphisms of bat-derived Pneumocystis are structured by host chorology. Therefore, Pneumocystis intra-specific genetic diversity may constitute a useful and relevant phylogeographic tool.",M2
19255189,"The absence of Hck, Fgr, and Lyn tyrosine kinases augments lung innate immune responses to <e>Pneumocystis</e> murina.Src family tyrosine kinases (SFKs) phosphorylate immunotyrosine activation motifs in the cytoplasmic tail of multiple immunoreceptors, leading to the initiation of cellular effector functions, such as phagocytosis, reactive oxygen species production, and cytokine production. SFKs also play important roles in regulating these responses through the activation of immunotyrosine inhibitory motif-containing inhibitory receptors. As myeloid cells preferentially express the SFKs Hck, Fgr, and Lyn, we questioned the role of these kinases in innate immune responses to Pneumocystis murina. Increased phosphorylation of Hck was readily detectable in alveolar macrophages after stimulation with P. murina. We further observed decreased phosphorylation of Lyn on its C-terminal inhibitory tyrosine in P. murina-stimulated alveolar macrophages, indicating that SFKs were activated in alveolar macrophages in response to P. murina. Mice deficient in Hck, Fgr, and Lyn exhibited augmented clearance 3 and 7 days after intratracheal administration of P. murina, which correlated with elevated levels of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), IL-6, CXCL1/KC, CCL2/monocyte chemoattractant protein 1, and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor in lung homogenates and a dramatic increase in macrophage and neutrophil recruitment. Augmented P. murina clearance was also observed in Lyn(-/-) mice 3 days postchallenge, although the level was less than that observed in Hck(-/-) Fgr(-/-) Lyn(-/-) mice. A correlate to augmented clearance of P. murina in Hck(-/-) Fgr(-/-) Lyn(-/-) mice was a greater ability of alveolar macrophages from these mice to kill P. murina in vitro, suggesting that SFKs regulate the alveolar macrophage effector function against P. murina. Mice deficient in paired immunoglobulin receptor B (PIR-B), an inhibitory receptor activated by SFKs, did not exhibit enhanced inflammatory responsiveness to or clearance of P. murina. Our results suggest that SFKs regulate innate lung responses to P. murina in a PIR-B-independent manner.",M2

18820078,"Biofilm formation by <e>Pneumocystis</e> spp.Pneumocystis spp. can cause a lethal pneumonia in hosts with debilitated immune systems. The manner in which these fungal infections spread throughout the lung, the life cycles of the organisms, and their strategies used for survival within the mammalian host are largely unknown, due in part to the lack of a continuous cultivation method. Biofilm formation is one strategy used by microbes for protection against environmental assaults, for communication and differentiation, and as foci for dissemination. We posited that the attachment and growth of Pneumocystis within the lung alveoli is akin to biofilm formation. An in vitro system comprised of insert wells suspended in multiwell plates containing supplemented RPMI 1640 medium supported biofilm formation by P. carinii (from rat) and P. murina (from mouse). Dramatic morphological changes accompanied the transition to a biofilm. Cyst and trophic forms became highly refractile and produced branching formations that anastomosed into large macroscopic clusters that spread across the insert. Confocal microscopy revealed stacking of viable organisms enmeshed in concanavalin A-staining extracellular matrix. Biofilms matured over a 3-week time period and could be passaged. These passaged organisms were able to cause infection in immunosuppressed rodents. Biofilm formation was inhibited by farnesol, a quorum-sensing molecule in Candida spp., suggesting that a similar communication system may be operational in the Pneumocystis biofilms. Intense staining with a monoclonal antibody to the major surface glycoproteins and an increase in (1,3)-beta-D-glucan content suggest that these components contributed to the refractile properties. Identification of this biofilm process provides a tractable in vitro system that should fundamentally advance the study of Pneumocystis.",M2

The pathogenic potential of Pneumocystis species, especially of the human-associated Pneumocystis jirovecii, has stimulated a growing interest in these peculiar microfungi. However, a comprehensive understanding of basic biology and pathogenic power of Pneumocystis organisms calls for their recognition as natural, complex entities, without reducing them to their pathogenic role. For many years, the entity named  Pneumocystis carinii  was considered like an anecdotal pulmonary pathogen able to cause pneumonia in immunosuppressed hosts. Only for the last years, marked genetic divergence was documented among the Pneumocystis strains of different mammals. Cross-infection experiments showed that Pneumocystis species are stenoxenous parasites. Mainly on the basis of the Phylogenetic Concept of Species, Pneumocystis strains were considered as genuine species. Five species were described: P. carinii and Pneumocystis wakefieldiae in rats, P. jirovecii in humans, Pneumocystis murina in mice, and Pneumocystis oryctolagi in rabbits. They also present distinctive phenotypic features. Molecular techniques have revealed a high prevalence of Pneumocystis colonization in wild mammals, probably resulting from active airborne horizontal and vertical (transplacental or aerial) transmission mechanisms. Cophylogeny is the evolutionary pattern for Pneumocystis species, which dwelt in the lungs of mammals for more than 100 million years. Consistently, Pneumocystis organisms exhibit successful adaptation to colonize the lungs of both immunocompromised and healthy hosts that can act as infection reservoir. Pneumocystis pneumonia, rarely reported in wild mammals, seems to be a rather unfrequent event. A larger spectrum of Pneumocystis infections related to the heterogeneous level of immune defence found in natural populations, is, however, expected. Pneumocystis infection of immunocompetent hosts emerges therefore as a relevant issue to human as well as animal health.",M2

Recent reports demonstrate associations between the detection of Pneumocystis jirovecii DNA in lung specimens or respiratory secretions and the presence of emphysema in COPD patients. Additionally, human immunodeficiency virus-infected individuals who smoke cigarettes develop early emphysema, but a role for P. jirovecii in pathogenesis remains speculative. We developed a new experimental model using immunocompetent mice to test the interaction of cigarette smoke exposure and environmentally acquired Pneumocystis murina infection in vivo. We hypothesized that cigarette smoke and P. murina would interact to cause increases in total lung capacity, airspace enlargement, and pulmonary inflammation. We found that exposure to cigarette smoke significantly increases the lung organism burden of P. murina. Pulmonary infection with P. murina, combined with cigarette smoke exposure, results in changes in pulmonary function and airspace enlargement characteristic of pulmonary emphysema. P. murina and cigarette smoke exposure interact to cause increased lung inflammatory cell accumulation. These findings establish a novel animal model system to explore the role of Pneumocystis species in the pathogenesis of COPD.",M2
18467653,"Immune responses to <e>Pneumocystis</e> murina are robust in healthy mice but largely absent in CD40 ligand-deficient mice.Pneumocystis is a pathogen of immunocompromised hosts but can also infect healthy hosts, in whom infection is rapidly controlled and cleared. Microarray methods were used to examine differential gene expression in the lungs of C57BL/6 and CD40 ligand knockout (CD40L-KO) mice over time following exposure to Pneumocystis murina. Immunocompetent C57BL/6 mice, which control and clear infection efficiently, showed a robust response to infection characterized by the up-regulation of 349 primarily immune response-associated genes. Temporal changes in the expression of these genes identified an early (Week 2), primarily innate response, which waned before the infection was controlled; this was followed by primarily adaptive immune responses that peaked at Week 5, which coincided with clearance of the infection. In conjunction with the latter, there was an increased expression of B cell-associated (Ig) genes at Week 6 that persisted through 11 weeks. In contrast, CD40L-KO mice, which are highly susceptible to developing severe Pneumocystis pneumonia, showed essentially no up-regulation of immune response-associated genes at Days 35-75. Immunohistochemical staining supported these observations by demonstrating an increase in CD4+, CD68+, and CD19+ cells in C57BL/6 but not CD40L-KO mice. Thus, the healthy host demonstrates a robust, biphasic response to infection by Pneumocystis; CD40L is an essential upstream regulator of the adaptive immune responses that efficiently control infection and prevent development of progressive pneumonia.",M2

In the week following the influenza infection, immunocompetent coinfected animals exhibited an accelerated rate of virus clearance, an accelerated appearance of higher influenza-specific neutralizing Ab titers in their serum and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), significantly reduced inflammatory cytokine levels in their BALF, and reduced levels of morbidity relative to animals infected only with influenza virus. The beneficial outcome observed in coinfected immunocompetent animals was dependent on the ongoing resolution of a viable Pneumocystis infection. No differences in viral clearance were detected between coinfected and influenza-only-infected muMT mice or likewise for SCID mice. The accelerated anti-influenza response did not appear to be associated with influenza-specific CD8 T cell-mediated responses or NK cell responses in the lung. Rather, the increased rate of viral clearance was due to the enhancement of the influenza-specific Ab response, which in turn was transiently dependent upon the resolution of the ongoing Pneumocystis infection.",M2
17320432,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> murina MSG gene family and the structure of the locus associated with its transcription.Analysis of the Pneumocystis murina MSG gene family and expression-site locus showed that, as in Pneumocystis carinii, P. murina MSG genes are arranged in head-to-tail tandem arrays located on multiple chromosomes, and that a variety of MSG genes can reside at the unique P. murina expression site. Located between the P. murina expression site and attached MSG gene is a block of 132 basepairs that is also present at the beginning of MSG genes that are not at the expression site. The center of this sequence block resembles the 28 basepair CRJE of P. carinii, but the block of conserved sequence in P. murina is nearly five times longer than in P. carinii, and much shorter than in P. wakefieldiae. These data indicate that the P. murina expression-site locus has a distinct structure.",M2

17300510,"Antigenic variation in <e>pneumocystis</e>.Pneumocystis is a genus containing many species of non-culturable fungi, each of which infects a different mammalian host. Pneumonia caused by Pneumocystis is a problem in immunodeficient humans, but not in normal humans. Nevertheless, it appears that Pneumocystis organisms cannot survive and proliferate outside of their mammalian hosts, suggesting that Pneumocystis parasitizes immunocompetent mammals. Residence in immunocompetent hosts may rely on camouflage perpetrated by antigenic variation. In P. carinii, which is found in rats, there exist three families of genes that appear to be designed to create antigenic variation. One gene family, which encodes the major surface glycoprotein (MSG), contains nearly 100 members. Expression of the MSG family is controlled by restricting transcription to the one gene that is linked to a unique expression site. Changes in the sequence of the MSG gene linked to the expression site occur and appear to be caused by recombination with MSG genes not at the expression site. Preliminary evidence suggests that gene conversion is the predominant recombination mechanism.",M2

Rad51 from Pneumocystis showed high homology to those from yeast. ATP binding motifs GEFRTGKS and LLIVD, similar to those of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe, are conserved in Pneumocystis Rad51. The recombinant protein when expressed in E. coli showed DNA-dependent ATPase activity.

17020928,"<e>Pneumocystis</e>-mediated IL-8 release by macrophages requires coexpression of mannose receptors and TLR2.Interaction with the unique fungus Pneumocystis (Pc) promotes IL-8 release by human alveolar macrophages (AM), although the receptor(s) mediating IL-8 release have not been identified. TLR2 recognizes fungal components and mediates release of host defense cytokines and chemokines, although whether TLR2 mediates signaling in response to Pc is not known. In the current study, Pc induced IL-8 release by human AM, and AM pretreatment with anti-TLR2 neutralizing antibody reduced IL-8 release. However, in nonphagocytic human embryonic kidney (HEK)293 cells transfected with human TLR2 cDNA, incubation with Pc did not induce IL-8 release, whereas these same cells released IL-8 in response to the TLR2 agonist lipoteichoic acid. Targeted gene silencing of AM mannose receptors (MR; phagocytic receptors for Pc) using small interfering RNA also reduced Pc-mediated IL-8 release in human AM. However, HEK293 cells transfected with human MR cDNA alone did not release IL-8 in response to Pc. In contrast, HEK293 cells cotransfected with human TLR2 and human MR cDNA released IL-8 in response to Pc. In human AM, Pc promoted direct interaction of MR and TLR2, IL-8 release was reduced markedly upon simultaneous blocking of TLR2 and gene silencing of MR, and IL-8 release was dependent in part on transcription factor NF-kappaB and ERK1/2 and JNK MAPKs. These studies demonstrate that Pc-mediated IL-8 release by human AM requires the coexpression of MR and TLR2 and further supports the concept that combinatorial interactions of macrophage innate receptors provide specificity of host defense cell responses to infectious challenge.",M2

16785543,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> cell wall beta-glucans induce dendritic cell costimulatory molecule expression and inflammatory activation through a Fas-Fas ligand mechanism.Respiratory failure during Pneumocystis pneumonia is mainly a consequence of exaggerated inflammatory responses to the organism. Dendritic cells (DCs) are the most potent APCs in the lung and are key to the regulation of innate and adaptive immune responses. However, their participation in the inflammatory response directed against Pneumocystis infection has not been fully elucidated. Therefore, we studied the role of Pneumocystis carinii, as well as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, cell wall-derived beta-glucans, in DC costimulatory molecule expression. We further studied the impact of beta-glucans on subsequent T cell activation. Because cytokine secretion by DCs has recently been shown to be regulated by Fas ligand (FasL), its role in beta-glucan activation of DCs was also investigated. beta-Glucan-induced DC activation occurred in part through dectin-1 receptors. We demonstrated that DC activation by beta-glucans elicits T cell activation and polarization into a Th1 patterned response, but with the conspicuous absence of IL-12. These observations differed from LPS-driven T cell polarization, suggesting that beta-glucans and LPS signal DC activation through different mechanisms. We additionally determined that IL-1beta and TNF-alpha secretion by beta-glucan-stimulated DCs was partially regulated by Fas-FasL. This suggests that dysregulation of FasL could further enhance exuberant and prolonged cytokine production by DCs following DC-T cell interactions, further promoting lung inflammation typical of Pneumocystis pneumonia.",M2
16757739,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> melanins confer enhanced organism viability.Pneumocystis continues to represent an important opportunistic fungal pathogen of those with compromised immunity. Thus, it is crucial to identify factors that affect its viability and pathogenicity. We previously reported the first identification of melanins in Pneumocystis. In the present study, we sought to further characterize these components and define the function for these melanins. Melanins extracted from Pneumocystis and melanized Pneumocystis cells were analyzed by electron spin resonance spectroscopy, revealing spectra consistent with melanins from other fungi. Immunofluorescence assays using anti-melanin monoclonal antibodies showed that melanins are widely present across Pneumocystis host species, including mouse-, ferret-, and human-derived Pneumocystis organisms, as well as Pneumocystis carinii derived from rat. Using immunoelectron microscopy, melanins were found to localize to the cell wall and cytoplasm of P. carinii cysts, as well as to intracystic bodies within mature cysts. Next, the role of melanins on the maintenance of Pneumocystis viability was determined by using quantitative reverse transcription-PCR measurement of the heat shock protein mRNA under adverse environmental conditions. Using a new method to promote the melanization of Pneumocystis, we observed that strongly melanized Pneumocystis retained viability to a greater degree when exposed to UV irradiation or desiccation compared to less-pigmented organisms. These studies support our previous identification of Pneumocystis melanins across the genus, further characterize these Pneumocystis components, and demonstrate that melanins protect Pneumocystis from environmental stressors.",M2

16495560,"Toll-like receptor 2 mediates alveolar macrophage response to <e>Pneumocystis</e> murina.The innate immune response to Pneumocystis infection is not well understood. In this study, normal C57BL/6 mouse alveolar macrophages were found to respond to Pneumocystis murina organisms through Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2), leading to the nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB and the production of proinflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and chemokine macrophage inflammatory protein 2 (MIP-2). P. murina stimulation of normal alveolar macrophages from C57BL/6 mice resulted in increased TLR2 transcription but not increased TLR4 transcription. In gain-of-function studies with HEK293 cells expressing TLR2 or TLR4, only TLR2 was found to stimulate an NF-kappaB response to P. murina. TNF-alpha and MIP-2 production in response to P. murina by mouse alveolar macrophages was inhibited by a monoclonal antibody that specifically blocked the ligand-binding ability of TLR2. Alveolar macrophages from TLR2 knockout (TLR2-/-) mice showed little increase in TNF-alpha and MIP-2 mRNA levels upon P. murina stimulation. An in vivo study showed that TLR2-/- mice challenged with P. murina had reduced cytokine responses. These results indicate that TLR2 plays a major role in the innate immune response to P. murina.",M2

In the absence of CD4 T cells, Pneumocystis infection results in vigorous CD8 T cell influx into the alveolar and interstitial spaces of the lung. This response results in lung damage characterized by low pO2 and albumin leakage into the bronchoalveolar lavage fluid similar to other CD8 T cell-mediated interstitial lung diseases. How this extracellular pathogen elicits a CD8 T cell response is not clear, and it was the aim of our study to determine the Ag specificity of the recruited CD8 T cells and to determine whether MHC class I (MHC I) expression was necessary to initiate lung damage. Using an adoptive T cell-transfer model with either polyclonal wild-type CD8 T cells or transgenic influenza virus-specific CD8 T cells we found that CD8 T cell recruitment is Ag-specific and requires the continuous presence of the Pneumocystis pathogen. Bone marrow chimera experiments using Rag-1 and beta2-microglobulin-deficient mice as hosts demonstrated a requirement for MHC I expression on nonbone marrow-derived cells of the lung. This suggests either direct processing of Pneumocystis Ags by nonbone marrow-derived cells of the lung or the induction of lung damage triggered by a lung-specific autoantigen. Using perforin-, Fas-, and IFN-gamma-deficient animals, we showed that these molecules are not directly involved in the CD8-mediated lung damage. However, CD8 T cell-mediated lung damage is Ag-specific is induced by a MHC I-expressing nonbone marrow-derived cell in the lung and is dependent on the continued presence of live Pneumocystis.",M2
16239546,"In vitro effector activity of <e>Pneumocystis</e> murina-specific T-cytotoxic-1 CD8+ T cells: role of granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor.Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related opportunistic infections continue to occur in patients who are newly diagnosed with HIV infection, those in the early course of highly active antiretroviral therapy or nonadherent to HIV care, and other immunosuppressed individuals. One of the most common opportunistic infections in these patients is Pneumocystis pneumonia. CD8+ T cells are recruited to the lung after P. carinii infection and have been associated with both lung injury and host defense. This variability may be due to subpopulations of CD8+ T cells recruited to the lung. We have previously shown using adoptive transfer studies that in vivo-generated T-cytotoxic-1 (Tc1) CD8+ T cells, defined by the secretion of gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), have effector activity against Pneumocystis spp. in vitro as well as in vivo. To better understand the mechanisms of these effects, we generated, expanded, and tested Tc1 and Tc2 CD8+ T cells specific for P. murina ex vivo. Tc1-polarized CD8+ T cells secreted higher levels of IFN-gamma and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) and lower levels of interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-5, IL-10, and IL-13 than Tc2 CD8+ T cells when stimulated with P. murina antigen. Moreover, Tc1 CD8+ T cells demonstrated enhanced effector activity in a macrophage-mediated killing assay which was independent of cell contact. The augmentation in macrophage-mediated P. murina killing was significantly abrogated when GM-CSF was neutralized in the Tc1 CD8+ T cells. These data support the possibility that antigen-specific GM-CSF secretion is critical for effector activity of P. murina-specific Tc1 CD8+ T cells in vitro.",M2

Five hundred seventy-three glioblastoma multiforme patients were randomized to receive either temozolomide + radiotherapy (n = 287) or radiotherapy alone (n = 286). Patients in the temozolomide + radiotherapy arm received concomitant temozolomide (75 mg/m2) once daily for the duration of radiation therapy (42-49 days). This was followed, 4 weeks later, by six cycles of temozolomide, 150 or 200 mg/m2 daily for 5 days, every 4 weeks. Patients in the control arm received radiotherapy only. In both arms, radiotherapy was delivered as 60 Gy/30 fractions to the tumor site with a 2 to 3 cm margin. <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii pneumonia prophylaxis was required during temozolomide + radiotherapy treatment and was continued until recovery of lymphocytopenia (Common Toxicity Criteria grade &lt;1).

These animals produce roughly 30- to 50-fold greater SP-D than their wild-type (WT) counterparts but show no other differences in lung morphology and function. Animals in both the SP-D OE and WT groups were depleted of CD4 lymphocytes with weekly injections of GK1.5 antibody, before Pneumocystis inoculation, and throughout the subsequent infection period. At various time points, mice were killed and analyzed for inflammatory parameters and organism burden. Proinflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were elevated throughout the period of infection, with OE animals exhibiting significantly higher levels of TNF-alpha and macrophage inflammatory protein-2 compared with WT controls. The total number of cells in the lavage fluid was also increased significantly only in the OE group, whereas the cell differential composition demonstrated lymphocyte and eosinophil infiltration in both groups of animals. Significantly, the organism burden was markedly higher in the SP-D OE animals, whereas the WT mice demonstrated little alteration in organism number over the course of infection. These results further indicate that SP-D facilitates the development of Pneumocystis infection and related lung inflammation in an immunosuppressed mouse model.",M2

The present study aims to describe the circulation of Pneumocystis organisms within a social organization of healthy crab-eating macaques (Macaca fascicularis) living in a natural setting in France. Animals were followed for up to 2 years. Deep nasal swab and blood samples were collected monthly from each animal under general anaesthesia. Environmental air was sampled for a 1 week period every month in the park where the macaques dwelt. Pneumocystis DNA was detected by nested-PCR of mitochondrial large subunit rRNA (mtLSU) gene in nasal swab and air samples. Anti-Pneumocystis IgG antibodies were detected in serum samples by indirect immuno-fluorescence assay. Pneumocystis DNA was detected in 168 of 500 swab samples examined (33.6 %). The number of macaques with detectable Pneumocystis DNA was highly variable from one month to another. Positive detection of Pneumocystis DNA was not related to the detection of serum anti-Pneumocystis antibody. During the second year of the study, Pneumocystis DNA was amplified more frequently from unweaned macaques than from adults or subadults. The mtLSU sequence showed marked polymorphism with eight Pneumocystis sequence types representing two distinct groups. On the whole, a constant and intensive circulation of Pneumocystis organisms within the community was observed. However, the implication of the various members of the colony was probably different and several levels of colonization by Pneumocystis may occur in immunocompetent macaques.",M2

Atovaquone, an analog of ubiquinone (coenzyme Q [CoQ]), inhibits mitochondrial electron transport and is effective in clearing mild to moderate cases of the infection. Purified rat-derived intact Pneumocystis carinii cells synthesize de novo four CoQ homologs, CoQ7, CoQ8, CoQ9, and CoQ10, as demonstrated by the incorporation of radiolabeled precursors of both the benzoquinone ring and the polyprenyl chain. A central step in CoQ biosynthesis is the condensation of p-hydroxybenzoic acid (PHBA) with a long-chain polyprenyl diphosphate molecule. In the present study, CoQ biosynthesis was evaluated by the incorporation of PHBA into completed CoQ molecules using P. carinii cell-free preparations. CoQ synthesis in whole-cell homogenates was not affected by the respiratory inhibitors antimycin A and dicyclohexylcarbodiimide but was diminished by atovaquone. Thus, atovaquone has inhibitory activity on both electron transport and CoQ synthesis in this pathogen. Furthermore, both the mitochondrial and microsomal fractions were shown to synthesize de novo all four P. carinii CoQ homologs. Interestingly, atovaquone inhibited microsomal CoQ synthesis, whereas it had no effect on mitochondrial CoQ synthesis. This is the first pathogenic eukaryotic microorganism in which biosynthesis of CoQ molecules from the initial PHBA:polyprenyl transferase reaction has been unambiguously shown to occur in two distinct compartments of the same cell.",M2

16000387,"Negative regulatory role of mannose receptors on human alveolar macrophage proinflammatory cytokine release in vitro.Alveolar macrophages (AM) are critical components of lung innate immunity and contribute to an effective host response to <e>Pneumocystis</e> pneumonia. Recognition of unopsonized Pneumocystis organisms by human AM is mediated predominantly via mannose receptors and results in phagocytosis, release of reactive oxygen species, and activation of the nuclear transcription factor (NF)-kappaB. However, the AM host defense genes activated by Pneumocystis have not been defined. In the present study, incubation of AM with unopsonized Pneumocystis organisms was not associated with release of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, or tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha (important cytokines in the host response to Pneumocystis) and did not induce IL-1beta, IL-6, or TNF-alpha mRNA transcripts. These findings were not attributed to Pneumocystis-induced cytopathic changes, as these same AM released IL-8 and matrix metalloproteinase-9 in response to Pneumocystis. NF-kappaB-mediated IL-8 release was independent of Pneumocystis phagocytosis. The observed response was specific, as IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha release and mRNA induction were preserved in response to lipopolysaccharide or serum-opsonized Pneumocystis. The absence of IL-1beta, IL-6, and TNF-alpha release in response to Pneumocystis was predominately influenced by AM mannose receptors, as blocking mannose receptors or targeted mannose receptor small interfering RNA functional gene silencing resulted in TNF-alpha release in response to unopsonized Pneumocystis organisms. Furthermore, ligation of AM mannose receptors by unopsonized Pneumocystis organisms reduced Toll-like receptor 4-mediated TNF-alpha release. Taken together, these data suggest that mannose receptors on human AM may suppress select proinflammatory cytokine release and may serve to regulate the innate inflammatory responses to infectious challenge in the lungs.",M2

15770087,"Analysis of <e>Pneumocystis</e> jirovecii DHPS alleles implicated in sulfamethoxazole resistance using an Escherichia coli model system.Pneumocystis jirovecii is a major opportunistic pathogen that causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). Drug treatment failure has been associated epidemiologically with point mutations in the gene for dihydropteroate synthase which is part of a gene that encodes three covalently linked enzymes involved in folic acid synthesis (FAS). The evaluation of whether mutations found in P. jirovecii FAS lead to sulfa drug resistance is hampered by the lack of a culture system for P. jirovecii as well as the failure of P. jirovecii FAS to complement in a heterologous system. Therefore, we chose to model the P. jirovecii mutations in the Saccharomyces cerevisiae FAS protein (encoded by FOL1) via its expression in Escherichia coli. An optimized drug diffusion assay was used to evaluate the FAS mutants against 15 sulfa drugs. It was established that the single amino acid substitution, P599S, in the (DHPS) domain of FAS led to sulfa drug resistance, whereas the T597A substitution led to increased sensitivity. The presence of both mutations (T597A and P599S) was cooperative and led to increased sulfa drug resistance. Analysis of a novel double mutant, (T597V P599S) was found to have significantly higher sulfa drug resistance than the T597A P599S mutant. These data suggest that further amino acid substitutions may lead to the evolution of higher sulfa drug resistance.

15673759,"Mutations in the <e>Pneumocystis</e> jirovecii DHPS gene confer cross-resistance to sulfa drugs.Pneumocystis jirovecii is a major opportunistic pathogen that causes Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) and results in a high degree of mortality in immunocompromised individuals. The drug of choice for PCP is typically sulfamethoxazole (SMX) or dapsone in conjunction with trimethoprim. Drug treatment failure and sulfa drug resistance have been implicated epidemiologically with point mutations in dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) of P. jirovecii. P. jirovecii cannot be cultured in vitro; however, heterologous complementation of the P. jirovecii trifunctional folic acid synthesis (PjFAS) genes with an E. coli DHPS-disrupted strain was recently achieved. This enabled the evaluation of SMX resistance conferred by DHPS mutations. In this study, we sought to determine whether DHPS mutations conferred sulfa drug cross-resistance to 15 commonly available sulfa drugs. It was established that the presence of amino acid substitutions (T(517)A or P(519)S) in the DHPS domain of PjFAS led to cross-resistance against most sulfa drugs evaluated. The presence of both mutations led to increased sulfa drug resistance, suggesting cooperativity and the incremental evolution of sulfa drug resistance. Two sulfa drugs (sulfachloropyridazine [SCP] and sulfamethoxypyridazine [SMP]) that had a higher inhibitory potential than SMX were identified. In addition, SCP, SMP, and sulfadiazine (SDZ) were found to be capable of inhibiting the clinically observed drug-resistant mutants. We propose that SCP, SMP, and SDZ should be considered for clinical evaluation against PCP or for future development of novel sulfa drug compounds.",M2
15638243,"Sterol metabolism in the opportunistic pathogen <e>Pneumocystis</e>: advances and new insights.Pneumocystis can transiently colonize healthy individuals without causing adverse symptoms, and most people test positive for exposure to this organism early in life. However, it can cause Pneumocystis pneumonia (PcP) in people with impaired immune systems and is a major cause of death in HIV/AIDS. Although it has close affinities to the Ascomycetes, Pneumocystis has features unlike those of any single group of fungi. For example, Pneumocystis does not synthesize ergosterol, which is consistent with the inefficacy of amphotericin B and some triazoles in clearing PcP. Pneumocystis sterols include distinct delta7 24-alkylsterols. Metabolic radiolabeling experiments demonstrated that P. carinii synthesizes sterols de novo. Cholesterol is the most abundant sterol in Pneumocystis; most, if not all, is scavenged from the mammalian host lung by the pathogen. The P. carinii erg7, erg6, and erg11 genes have been cloned, sequenced, and expressed in heterologous systems. The recombinant P. carinii S-adenosyl-L-methionine:C-24 sterol methyl transferase (SAM:SMT) has a preference for lanosterol over zymosterol as substrate, and the enzyme can catalyze the transfer of either one or two methyl groups to the C-24 position of the sterol side chain. Two different sterol compositions were detected among human-derived P. jirovecii; one was dominated by C28 and C29 sterols, and the other had high proportions of higher molecular mass components, notably the C32 sterol pneumocysterol. The latter phenotype apparently represents organisms blocked at 14alpha-demethylation of the sterol nucleus. These studies suggest that SAM:SMT is an attractive drug target for developing new chemotherapy for PcP.",M2
15574879,"Cdc42 and RhoB activation are required for mannose receptor-mediated phagocytosis by human alveolar macrophages.Human alveolar macrophages (AMs) phagocytose <e>Pneumocystis</e> (Pc) organisms predominantly through mannose receptors, although the molecular mechanism mediating this opsonin-independent process is not known. In this study, using AMs from healthy individuals, Pc phagocytosis was associated with focal F-actin polymerization and Cdc42, Rac1, and Rho activation in a time-dependent manner. Phagocytosis was primarily dependent on Cdc42 and RhoB activation (as determined by AM transfection with Cdc42 and RhoB dominant-negative alleles) and mediated predominantly through mannose receptors (as determined by siRNA gene silencing of AM mannose receptors). Pc also promoted PAK-1 phosphorylation, which was also dependent on RhoGTPase activation. HIV infection of AMs (as a model for reduced mannose receptor expression and function) was associated with impaired F-actin polymerization, reduced Cdc42 and Rho activation, and markedly reduced PAK-1 phosphorylation in response to Pc organisms. In healthy AMs, Pc phagocytosis was partially dependent on PAK activation, but dependent on the Rho effector molecule ROCK. These data provide a molecular mechanism for AM mannose receptor-mediated phagocytosis of unopsonized Pc organisms that appears distinct from opsonin-dependent phagocytic receptors. Reduced AM mannose receptor-mediated Cdc42 and Rho activation in the context of HIV infection may represent a mechanism that contributes to the pathogenesis of opportunistic pneumonia.",M2

15504856,"Mutations of <e>Pneumocystis</e> jirovecii dihydrofolate reductase associated with failure of prophylaxis.Most drugs used for prevention and treatment of Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia target enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of folic acid, i.e., dihydropteroate synthase (DHPS) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). Emergence of P. jirovecii drug resistance has been suggested by the association between failure of prophylaxis with sulfa drugs and mutations in DHPS. However, data on the occurrence of mutations in DHFR, the target of trimethoprim and pyrimethamine, are scarce. We examined polymorphisms in P. jirovecii DHFR from 33 patients diagnosed with P. jirovecii pneumonia who were receiving prophylaxis with a DHFR inhibitor (n = 15), prophylaxis without a DHFR inhibitor (n = 11), or no prophylaxis (n = 7). Compared to the wild-type sequence present in GenBank, 19 DHFR nucleotide substitution sites were found in 18 patients with 3 synonymous and 16 nonsynonymous mutations. Of 16 amino acid changes, 6 were located in positions conserved among distant organisms, and five of these six positions are probably involved in the putative active sites of the enzyme. Patients with failure of prophylaxis, including a DHFR inhibitor, were more likely to harbor nonsynonymous DHFR mutations than those who did not receive such prophylaxis (9 of 15 patients versus 2 of 18; P = 0.008). Analysis of the rate of nonsynonymous versus synonymous mutations was consistent with selection of amino acid substitutions in patients with failure of prophylaxis including a DHFR inhibitor. The results suggest that P. jirovecii populations may evolve under selective pressure from DHFR inhibitors, in particular pyrimethamine, and that DHFR mutations may contribute to P. jirovecii drug resistance.",M2
15155616,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> activates human alveolar macrophage NF-kappaB signaling through mannose receptors.Alveolar macrophages (AM) represent important effector cells in the innate immune response to the AIDS-related pathogen Pneumocystis, but the early AM host defense signaling events are poorly defined. Using AM from healthy individuals, we showed in the present study that Pneumocystis organisms stimulate AM NF-kappaB p50 and p65 nuclear translocation in a time-dependent and multiplicity-of-infection-dependent manner as determined by electrophoretic mobility shift assay and immunofluorescence microscopy and that NF-kappaB nuclear translocation is associated with I-kappaB phosphorylation. Importantly, competitive inhibition of mannose receptor and targeted short interfering RNA-mediated gene suppression of mannose receptor mRNA and protein is associated with complete elimination of NF-kappaB nuclear translocation in response to Pneumocystis. Furthermore, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection of AM (as a model human disease state of reduced AM mannose receptor expression and function) inhibits Pneumocystis-mediated NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and is associated with reduced I-kappaB phosphorylation and reduced interleukin-8 (IL-8) release. In contrast, NF-kappaB nuclear translocation and IL-8 release in response to lipopolysaccharide are intact in AM from both healthy and HIV-infected individuals, indicating that the observed impairment is not a global disturbance of the NF-kappaB pathway. Thus, in addition to phagocytic and endocytic effector functions, the present study identifies mannose receptors as pattern recognition receptors capable of NF-kappaB activation in response to infectious non-self challenge. AM mannose receptor-mediated NF-kappaB activation may represent an important mechanism of the host cell response to Pneumocystis, and altered NF-kappaB activation in the context of HIV infection may impair a critical innate immune signaling response and may contribute to pathogenesis of opportunistic lung infections.",M2

A very high level of sequence heterogeneity was detected with 18 original sequence types. Two genetic groups of Pneumocystis could be distinguished from the samples. Within each group, the extent of genetic divergence was low (2.5+/-1.4% in group 1 and 2.3+/-1.7% in group 2). Genetic divergences were systematically higher when macaque-derived sequence types were compared with Pneumocystis mtLSU sequences from other primate species (from 5.3+/-2.7% to 19.3+/-3.0%). The two macaque-derived groups may be considered as distinct Pneumocystis species. Surprisingly, these Pneumocystis species were recovered from both M. mulatta and M. fascicularis suggesting that host-species restriction may not systematically occur in the genus Pneumocystis. Alternatively, these observations question about the species concept in macaques.",M2
15117741,"Association of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease severity and <e>Pneumocystis</e> colonization.Factors modulating the variable progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are largely unknown, but infectious agents may play a role. Because Pneumocystis has previously been shown to induce a CD8(+) lymphocyte- and neutrophil-predominant response similar to that in COPD, we explored the association of the organism with accelerated disease progression. We examined Pneumocystis colonization rates in lung tissue obtained during lung resection or transplantation in smokers with a range of airway obstruction severity and in a control group with lung diseases other than COPD. Using nested polymerase chain reaction, Pneumocystis colonization was detected in 36.7% of patients with very severe COPD (Global Health Initiative on Obstructive Lung Disease [GOLD] Stage IV) compared with 5.3% of smokers with normal lung function or less severe COPD (Stages 0, I, II, and III) (p = 0.004) and with 9.1% of control subjects (p = 0.007). Colonized subjects exhibited more severe airway obstruction (median FEV(1) = 21% predicted versus 62% in noncolonized subjects, p = 0.006). GOLD IV was the strongest predictor of Pneumocystis colonization (odds ratio = 7.3, 95% confidence interval = 2.4-22.4, p &lt; 0.001) and was independent of smoking history. We conclude that there is a strong association between Pneumocystis colonization and severity of airflow obstruction in smokers, suggesting a possible pathogenic link with COPD progression.",M2

Fifty-seven (36.1%) of 158 patients were infected with a mutant DHPS genotype.

Fungi utilize a specific pheromone-induced MAPK pathway to regulate conjugation, formation of an ascus, and entry into meiosis. We have previously identified a MAPK, PCM, from the fungal opportunist Pneumocystis, responsible for causing severe pneumonia in patients with AIDS. In order to gain insight into the function of PCM, we expressed it in Saccharomyces cerevisiae deficient in pheromone signaling and tested activation and inhibition of this MAPK pathway. PCM restored pheromone signaling in S. cerevisiae fus3Delta kss1Delta mutants with alpha-factor pheromone (six-fold increase) and was not activated by osmotic stress. Signaling through this pathway decreased 2.5-fold with 10 microM U0126, and was unaffected with SB203580. We evaluated the conditions for native PCM kinase activity isolated from Pneumocystis carinii organisms and found that 0.1 mM MgCl2, pH 6.5, temperature 30-35 degrees C, and 10 microM ATP were optimal. The activity of PCM is significantly elevated in P. carinii trophic forms compared to cysts, implicating a role for PCM in the life cycle transition of P. carinii from trophic forms to cysts.",M2
12936966,"Recapitulation in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of cytochrome b mutations conferring resistance to atovaquone in <e>Pneumocystis</e> jiroveci.Pneumocystis jiroveci (human-derived P. carinii) is an opportunistic pathogenic fungus which causes pneumonia and is life-threatening in immunocompromised individuals. Spontaneously acquired resistance to atovaquone, a hydroxynaphthoquinone that is used to treat P. jiroveci infections, was linked to mutations in the mitochondrially encoded cytochrome b gene. Because P. jiroveci cannot be easily cultivated, we have developed Saccharomyces cerevisiae as an alternative system to study atovaquone resistance mutations. In this work, we introduced seven mutations linked with atovaquone resistance in P. jiroveci into the S. cerevisiae cytochrome b gene. The effects of the mutations on the respiratory function and on the sensitivity to the inhibitor were then characterized. Six of the reported mutations lowered the sensitivity of the S. cerevisiae bc(1) complex to atovaquone, while one mutation had no effect on the drug resistance. These results were confirmed by monitoring the in vivo resistance of S. cerevisiae mutants which carried both the cytochrome b mutations and a deletion of the ABC transporter genes, allowing the drug to bypass the weakened efflux pump system. S. cerevisiae thus provides an easy-to-use system to characterize in vivo and in vitro cytochrome b mutations reported in pathogens and to assess their role in drug resistance.",M2
12909353,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii STE11, an HMG-box protein, is phosphorylated by the mitogen activated protein kinase PCM.A pheromone-induced mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway controls mating in fungi by regulating gene transcription. In the opportunistic fungus Pneumocystis carinii, we have identified a protein containing a high-mobility group (HMG) motif which is homologous to the transcriptional activators STE11 of Schizosaccharomyces pombe and STE12 of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. In fungi, this transcriptional activator functions in sexual development, filamentous growth, and pathogenicity. The fungal pheromone-activated MAPK phosphorylates the transcriptional activator to allow binding to pheromone-response elements in the promoter regions of certain genes. We have previously identified a P. carinii MAPK, PCM, which has significant homology to fungal MAPKs involved in mating. As an initial step in understanding the downstream molecules which interact with the PCM kinase, we have cloned a STE11 homologue in P. carinii. PCSTE11 has an open-reading frame of 1.5 kb which encodes a protein of 501 amino acids with a molecular weight of 56 kDa. Greatest homology was to S. pombe STE11 (52%). We have expressed a His-tag fusion of PCSTE11 and purified the protein with nickel affinity resin. PCM phosphorylates the purified protein indicating that PCSTE11 is associated with the MAPK cascade in P. carinii.",M2
12885408,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii BCK1 functions in a mitogen-activated protein kinase cascade regulating fungal cell-wall assembly.Pneumocystis pneumonia remains the most common AIDS-defining opportunistic infection in people with HIV. The process by which Pneumocystis carinii constructs its cell wall is not well known, although recent studies reveal that molecules such as beta-1-3-glucan synthetase (GSC1) and environmental pH-responsive genes such as PHR1 are important for cell-wall integrity. In closely related fungi, a specific mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade regulates cell-wall assembly in response to elevated temperature. The upstream mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase kinase (MAPKKK, or MEKK), BCK1, is an essential component in this pathway for maintaining cell-wall integrity and preventing fungal cell lysis. We have identified a P. carinii MEKK gene and have expressed it in Saccharomyces cerevisiae to gain insights into its function. The P. carinii MEKK, PCBCK1, corrects the temperature-sensitive cell lysis defect of bck1Delta yeast. Further, at elevated temperature PCBCK1 restored the signaling defect in bck1Delta yeast to maintain expression of the temperature-inducible beta-1-3-glucan synthetase gene, FKS2. PCBCK1, as a functional kinase, is capable of autophosphorylation and substrate phosphorylation. Since glucan machinery is not present in mammals, a better understanding of this pathway in P. carinii might aid in the development of novel medications which interfere with the integrity of the Pneumocystis cell wall.",M2
12837736,"Assessment of immune reconstitution to <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii in HIV-1 patients under different highly active antiretroviral therapy regimens.The introduction of protease inhibitors (PIs) gave a dramatic drop in AIDS-related opportunistic events, mainly due to induced immune reconstitution. Discontinuation of prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii is considered safe when CD4 &gt; 200 cells/mm(3). Ideally, we should have specific functional tests for HIV-1-related decisions. We examined viro-immunological profiles, clinical outcome and lymphocyte proliferation (LP) to P. carinii and other antigens in 108 subjects: 28 AIDS presenters with P. carinii pneumonia (PCP) (CD4 &lt; 200 cells/mm(3)), 22 untreated asymptomatic HIV-1-infected patients (CD4 &gt; 200 cells/mm(3)), 44 HIV-1-infected patients immune-reconstituted on antiretroviral regimens and 14 HIV-1-uninfected healthy controls. As regards viral load, there was no significant difference in therapy duration, nadir, or actual CD4, CD8, natural killer or B cell counts in immune-reconstituted patients receiving protease inhibitor (PI)-based versus those receiving PI-sparing antiretroviral regimens. Among subjects showing abnormally low P. carinii-specific LP, three patients receiving a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (nNRTI) developed PCP despite having CD4 &gt; 250 cells/mm(3). P. carinii-specific LP could be considered for doubtful situations, i.e. for a safer clinical decision of discontinuing or restarting prophylaxis in patients with a low CD4 nadir or experiencing a sudden CD4 decrease under highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART).

Thioredoxin reductases encoded by the full-length genes have predicted molecular weights of approximately 35,000 and show high homology to yeast Trr1. An NADPH-binding domain with a putative redox active site CAVC as well as an flavin-adenine dinucleotide-binding domain are highly conserved in both proteins, which were 85% identical. The multicopy trr1 gene fragments in P. carinii are not transcribed or expressed. Duplication of the gene fragment likely occurred in conjunction with duplication of the kexin homologue, protease-1, which is located immediately upstream of the trr1 gene. Thioredoxin reductase, an enzyme implicated in the growth, survival and pathogenicity of certain microbes, could be a potential target for therapeutic intervention in Pneumocystis infection.",M2
12716885,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii cell wall beta-glucans initiate macrophage inflammatory responses through NF-kappaB activation.beta-Glucans are major structural components of fungi. We have recently reported that the pathogenic fungus Pneumocystis carinii assembles a beta-glucan-rich cell wall that potently activates alveolar macrophages to release pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Purified P. carinii beta-glucans predictably induce both cytokine generation and associated neutrophilic lung inflammation. Herein, we demonstrate that P. carinii beta-glucan-induced macrophage stimulation results from activation of NF-kappaB. Although analogous to macrophage activation induced by bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS), P. carinii beta-glucan-induced macrophage NF-kappaB activation exhibits distinctly different kinetics, with slower induction and longer duration compared with LPS stimulation. Macrophage activation in response to P. carinii beta-glucan was also substantially inhibited with the NF-kappaB antagonist pyrrolidine dithiocarbamate. In addition to different kinetics of NF-kappaB activation, P. carinii beta-glucan and LPS also utilize different receptor systems to induce macrophage activation. Macrophages from Toll-like receptor 4-deficient and wild type mice produced equivalent amounts of tumor necrosis factor alpha when stimulated with P. carinii beta-glucan. However, Toll-like receptor 4-deficient macrophages were refractory to stimulation with LPS. In contrast, MyD88-deficient macrophages exhibited a significant (though partial) blunted response to P. carinii beta-glucan. These data demonstrate that P. carinii beta-glucan acts as potent inducer of macrophage activation through NF-kappaB utilizing cellular receptors and signaling pathways distinct from LPS.",M2

The selectivity index of DHFR inhibition was evaluated by comparing the potency of each compound against the parasite enzymes with its potency against rat liver DHFR. 2,4-Diamino-5-[5'-(5-carboxy-1-pentynyl)-2'-methoxybenzyl]pyrimidine (3) inhibited Pc DHFR with a selectivity index of 79 and was 430 times more potent than TMP. 2,4-Diamino-5-[5'-(4-carboxy-1-butynyl)-2'-methoxybenzyl]pyrimidine (2), with one less carbon than 3 in the side chain, had a selectivity index of 910 against Ma DHFR and was 43 times more potent than TMP. 2,4-Diamino-5-[5'-(5-carboxypentyl)-2'-methoxybenzyl]pyrimidine (6) had a selectivity index of 490 against Tg DHFR and was 320 times more potent than TMP. 2,4-Diamino-5-[5'-(6-carboxy-1-hexynyl)-2'-methoxybenzyl]pyrimidine (4), with one more carbon than 3, was less potent against all three of the parasite enzymes than either 3 or 6 and also had a lower selectivity index than 3 against the Pc enzyme. However, 4 was the only member of the series with a selectivity index of &gt;300 against both Tg and Ma DHFR. Given that PTX is at least 10 times more potent against rat DHFR than against P. carinii or T. gondii DHFR and that the selectivity index of several of the compounds matches or exceeds that of TMP as well as PTX, our results suggest that it may be possible to develop clinically useful nonclassical antifolates that are both potent and selective against the major opportunistic pathogens of AIDS.",M2
12655009,"Molecular recognition properties of IGS-mediated reactions catalyzed by a <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii group I intron.We report the development, analysis and use of a new combinatorial approach to analyze the substrate sequence dependence of the suicide inhibition, cyclization, and reverse cyclization reactions catalyzed by a group I intron from the opportunistic pathogen Pneumocystis carinii. We demonstrate that the sequence specificity of these Internal Guide Sequence (IGS)-mediated reactions is not high. In addition, the sequence specificity of suicide inhibition decreases with increasing MgCl(2) concentration, reverse cyclization is substantially more sequence specific than suicide inhibition, and multiple reverse cyclization products occur, in part due to the formation of multiple cyclization intermediates. Thermodynamic analysis reveals that a base pair at position -4 of the resultant 5' exon-IGS (P1) helix is crucial for tertiary docking of the P1 helix into the catalytic core of the ribozyme in the suicide inhibition reaction. In contrast to results reported with a Tetrahymena ribozyme, altering the sequence of the IGS of the P.carinii ribozyme can result in a marked reduction in tertiary stability of docking the resultant P1 helix into the catalytic core of the ribozyme. Finally, results indicate that RNA targeting strategies which exploit tertiary interactions could have low specificity due to the tolerance of mismatched base pairs.",M2

PC is intrinsically resistant to treatment with azole antifungal medications. The enzyme lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase (Erg11) is the target for azole antifungals. We cloned PCERG11 and compared its sequence to Erg11 proteins present in azole-resistant organisms, and performed chromosomal and Northern blot analysis for PCERG11. Of 13 potential sites which could confer resistance to azoles, two were identical to azole-resistant Candida. By site-directed mutagenesis we changed these two sites in PCERG11 to those present in azole-sensitive Candida to generate PCERG11-SDM (E113D, T125K). We tested the susceptibility of ERG11 deletion strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae (SC) expressing PCERG11, PCERG11-SDM, and wild-type SCERG11 to three azole antifungals: fluconazole, itraconazole, and voriconazole. PCERG11 required a 2.2-fold higher dose of voriconazole and 3.5-fold higher dose of fluconazole than SCERG11 for a 50% reduction in growth. No difference was observed in the sensitivity to itraconazole. PCERG11-SDM has increased sensitivity to fluconazole and voriconazole, but not itraconazole. We believe that the molecular structure of the lanosterol 14 alpha-demethylase encoded by PCERG11 confers inherent resistance to azole antifungals and plays an integral part in the overall resistance of this PC to azole therapy.",M2

12543137,"Prediction of dihydrofolate reductase inhibition and selectivity using computational neural networks and linear discriminant analysis.A data set of 345 dihydrofolate reductase inhibitors was used to build QSAR models that correlate chemical structure and inhibition potency for three types of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR): rat liver (rl), <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii (pc), and Toxoplasma gondii (tg). Quantitative models were built using subsets of molecular structure descriptors being analyzed by computational neural networks. Neural network models were able to accurately predict log IC(50) values for the three types of DHFR to within +/-0.65 log units (data sets ranged approximately 5.5 log units) of the experimentally determined values. Classification models were also constructed using linear discriminant analysis to identify compounds as selective or nonselective inhibitors of bacterial DHFR (pcDHFR and tgDHFR) relative to mammalian DHFR (rlDHFR). A leave-N-out training procedure was used to add robustness to the models and to prove that consistent results could be obtained using different training and prediction set splits. The best linear discriminant analysis (LDA) models were able to correctly predict DHFR selectivity for approximately 70% of the external prediction set compounds. A set of new nitrogen and oxygen-specific descriptors were developed especially for this data set to better encode structural features, which are believed to directly influence DHFR inhibition and selectivity.",M2
12531182,"Sterol biosynthesis in <e>Pneumocystis</e>: unique steps that define unique targets.Pneumocystis lacks ergosterol, and several antimycotics that bind ergosterol in fungal membranes or inhibit its synthesis are ineffective against Pneumocystis pneumonia. The organism synthesizes C(28) and C(29) Delta(7) 24-alkylsterols, 24-alkyllanosterol derivatives, and Delta(5) 24-alkylsterols, which may be produced by modifying scavenged Delta(5) sterols. Mammals cannot desaturate C-22 and alkylate C-24 of sterols, thus, these processes are particularly attractive targets for antifungal drug development. Recent data indicate that C-22 desaturation is not, but C-24 alkylation is an attractive target in P. carinii. The P. carinii S-adenosyl-L-methionine:sterol C-24 methyl transferase (SAM:SMT) has unique properties; it prefers lanosterol as its sterol substrate.",M2
12496148,"Diversity at the locus associated with transcription of a variable surface antigen of <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii as an index of population structure and dynamics in infected rats.Pneumocystis carinii expresses a surface glycoprotein called MSG. Different isoforms of MSG are encoded by a gene family spread over at least 15 telomeric sites. Only one locus, called UCS, supports the production of MSG mRNA. Previous studies showed that P. carinii populations from individual rats exhibited high degrees of diversity with respect to the MSG genes attached to the UCS locus. This diversity could have been generated primarily in the rats studied. Alternatively, the rats may have been infected by P. carinii organisms that were already different at the UCS locus. To investigate this issue, we examined the UCS locus in P. carinii from rats that had been exposed to few of the microbes at a specified time, which produced a bottleneck in the microbial population. Some of the rats with bottlenecks produced P. carinii populations in which a single MSG sequence resided at the UCS locus in 80 to 90% of the organisms, showing that P. carinii can proliferate within a rat without generating the very high levels of UCS diversity previously seen. From the degree of diversity observed in the bottlenecked populations, the maximum rate of switching appeared to be 0.01 event per generation. These data also suggest that the infectious dose is as low as one organism, that rats that share a cage readily infect each other, and that the doubling time of P. carinii in vivo is approximately 3 days. In addition, we found that inoculation with 10(7) P. carinii organisms from a population highly heterogeneous at the UCS locus reproduced this heterogeneity. By contrast, shifts in population structure occurred in rats given 10(4) P. carinii organisms, suggesting that a small fraction of these proliferated.",M2

The reaction is intramolecular with regard to substrate. The ribozyme targets its substrate by base pairing with two or three noncontiguous regions on the substrate, and the reaction occurs through a nucleotide cofactor independent mechanism. The excised segment can be as long as 28 nucleotides, or more, and as little as one nucleotide. The potential usefulness of this reaction is demonstrated by engineering a ribozyme that excises the triplet-repeat expansion region from a truncated myotonic dystrophy protein kinase transcript mimic in vitro.",M2

Also prepared via a scheme based on the Taylor ring expansion/ring annulation synthesis were three heretofore undescribed 2,4-diamino-5-(substituted benzyl)-7H-pyrrolo[2,3-d]pyrimidines (3b-c). Standard spectrophotometric assays were used to compare the ability of 2a-e and 3b-c to inhibit dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) from Pneumocystis carinii, Toxoplasma gondii, and Mycobacterium avium, three examples of opportunistic pathogens to which AIDS patients are highly vulnerable because of their immunocompromised state. For comparison, 13 previously untested 2,4-diamino-6-(substituted benzyl)quinazolines (17a-m) were also evaluated as inhibitors of these enzymes, as well as the enzyme from rat liver. None of the quinazolines or pyridopyrimidines tested was more potent against the P. carinii enzyme than the structurally related reference compound piritrexim (1), and none showed selectivity for the P. carinii enzyme over the rat enzyme. One of the pyridopyrimidines (2c) showed 10-fold selectivity for T. gondii versus rat DHFR, and two of them (2b, 2c) showed selectivity for the M. avium enzyme. However, this gain in species selectivity was achieved at the cost of decreased in potency, as has been noted with many other lipophilic DHFR inhibitors.",M2
12421494,"[The diagnostic value of polymerase chain reaction for the detection of <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii DNA from induced sputum samples]OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the diagnostic value of PCR for detection of Pneumocystis carinii DNA from induced sputum samples. METHODS: P. carinii cysts or trophozoites were detected in induced sputa by Giemsa stain or Gomori Methenamine silver (GMS) stain. A fragment of the Pneumocystis carinii mitochondrial large-subunit rRNA gene was amplified from sputum samples using a one-step PCR method with mt-rRNA primers. RESULTS: In this study, sputum samples from 16 patients with a clinical diagnosis of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP) and 20 patients with other respiratory infections were first tested by cytochemical staining. Pneumocystis carinii was detected in 8 and 0 sputum samples from the two groups, respectively. The sensitivity and specificity of cytochemical stain were 50% and 100%. With the one-step mt-rRNA-PCR method, Pneumocystis carinii DNA was detected in 14 and 0 sputum samples from 16 PCP patients and 20 non-PCP patients. The sensitivity and specificity of mt-rRNA-PCR was 88% and 100%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The specificity of both Giemsa and GMS staining of induced sputum samples is high and the methods are simple, but the sensitivity is low. The sensitivity of PCR for P. carinii DNA from induced sputum samples is significantly higher than cytochemical stains, and the method is highly specific when used in the clinical diagnosis of PCP.",M2
12419803,"<e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii cell wall beta-glucan induces release of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 from alveolar epithelial cells via a lactosylceramide-mediated mechanism.Infiltration of the lungs with neutrophils promotes respiratory failure during severe Pneumocystis carinii (PC) pneumonia. Recent studies have shown that alveolar epithelial cells (AECs), in addition to promoting PC attachment, also participate in lung inflammation by the release of cytokines and chemokines. Herein, we demonstrate that a PC beta-glucan rich cell wall isolate (PCBG) stimulates the release of macrophage inflammatory protein-2 (MIP-2) from isolated AECs through a lactosylceramide-dependent mechanism. The results demonstrate that MIP-2 mRNA and protein production is significantly increased at both early and late time points after PCBG challenge. Although CD11b/CD18 (Mac-1, CR3) is the most widely studied beta-glucan receptor, we demonstrate that CD11b/CD18 is not present on AECs. This study instead demonstrates that preincubation of AECs with an antibody directed against the membrane glycosphingolipid lactosylceramide (CDw17) results in a significant decrease in MIP-2 secretion. Preincubation of the anti-CDw17 antibody with solubilized lactosylceramide reverses this effect. Furthermore, incubation of AECs with inhibitors of glycosphingolipid biosynthesis, including N-butyldeoxyno jirimycin and d-threo-1-phenyl-2-decanoylamino-3-morpholino-1-propanol-HCl, also results in a significant decrease in AEC MIP-2 production following challenge with PCBG. These data demonstrate that PC beta-glucan induces significant production of MIP-2 from AECs and that CDw17 participates in the glucan-induced inflammatory signaling in lung epithelial cells during PC infection.",M2

METHODS: Immunosuppression was induced in 5 rats with an immunosuppresion regimen consisting mainly of dexamethasone in a course of 2 weeks, after which pulmonary homogenates of rats infected with Pneumocystis carinii were fed to the immunosuppressed rats. Immunosuppression was maintained for approximately 4 weeks after the feeding to induce Pneumocystis pneumonia in the rats. GpA gene was subsequently amplified from the rats with pneumonia as confirmed by microscope and PCR detection, and was subcloned into T-vector for the transformation of Escherichia coli JM109 strain. RESULTS: Pneumocystis carinii was detected by microscope and PCR detection in rats with immunosuppression. The length of PCR product was 319 bp as shown by agarose electrophoresis. CONCLUSION: The rat model of Pneumocystis carinii infection can be established by immunosuppression with dexamethasone and a single oral administration of the pathogen.",M2

12198294,"Analysis of quinazoline and pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine N9-C10 reversed-bridge antifolates in complex with NADP+ and <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii dihydrofolate reductase.Structural studies of two ternary complexes of Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase (pcDHFR) with the cofactor NADP(+) and potent antifolates, the N9-C10 reversed-bridge inhibitor 2,4-diamino-6-[N-(2',5'-dimethoxybenzyl)-N-methylamino]quinazoline (1) and its 3',5'-dimethoxypyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine analog (2), were carried out. Data for the monoclinic crystals were refined to 1.90 A resolution for the complex with (1) (R = 0.178) and to 2.1 A resolution for the complex with (2) (R = 0.193). The effect of the N9-C10 reversed-bridge geometry is to distort the bridge from coplanarity with the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine or quinazoline ring system and to twist the C10 methylene conformation toward a gauche conformation. This change also influences the conformation of the methoxybenzyl ring, moving it away from a trans position. This change places the 5'-methoxy group deeper within the hydrophobic pocket made by Ile65, Pro66 and Phe69 of the pcDHFR active site. These results also revealed the first observation of an unusual conformation for the reversed-bridge geometry (C5-C6-N9-C10 torsion angle) in antifolate (2). The electron density is consistent with the presence of two models (conformers 2-1 and 2-2) that result from inversion of the geometry at N9. The four examples of N9-C10 reversed-bridge antifolates cluster in two conformations, with the structure of quinazoline (1) similar to that previously reported for its 2',5'-dimethoxypyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine analog (3). The two conformers of (2) differ from these and each other by a twisted-bridge geometry that results in the dimethoxybenzyl ring occupying the same conformational space. Conformer 2-2 also has the N9-C10 reversed bridge perpendicular to the pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidine plane, in contrast to the gauche-trans conformation normally observed. As a result of these changes, the N9 methyl probes conformational space in the active site not normally occupied by antifolate structures. The N9 methyl of conformer 2-2 makes close contacts to the conserved Leu25 as well as the hydroxyl O atoms of the nicotinamide ribose and Ser64, whereas the other three reversed-bridge conformers make weak hydrophobic contacts with Ile123, Thr61 and Ile65. These antifolates are ten times more selective for pcDHFR than the C9-N10 bridge parent trimetrexate. However, pyrido[2,3-d]pyrimidines (2) and (3) are three times more selective for pcDHFR than quinazoline (1) is for rat liver DHFR. These data suggest that the loss of hydrogen-bonding interactions with N8 is more important to potency than the interactions of the methoxybenzyl substituents.",M2

Divided into several subgroups termed the 'special forms', P. carinii is prone to an extensive karyotype variation. In previous studies, the nuclear genome of these organisms has been considered to be haploid and a set of 16 chromosomes has been assigned to P. carinii f. sp. carinii, a special form known to infect rats. We report the analysis of the genome of an isolate representative of the karyotype 1 of this special form, using two-dimensional pulsed-field gel electrophoresis procedures. The 'karyotype and restriction display' (KARD) fingerprints indicated the presence of 17 different chromosomes. The haploid genome size was estimated to be 8.4 Mbp. Some homologous chromosomes were distinguished on the basis of a single restriction fragment length polymorphism, which raises the possibility of a diploid nucleus. A restriction map of the chromosome 15, characterized by two homologues with a size difference of 7 kb, was constructed. Hybridization data indicated that insertion/deletion events may have occurred within subtelomeric regions which carry genes encoding the major surface glycoprotein (MSG) of Pneumocystis.",M2

12091496,"Comprehensive and definitive structural identities of <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii sterols.Pneumocystis causes a type of pneumonia in immunodeficient mammals, such as AIDS patients. Mammals cannot alkylate the C-24 position of the sterol side chain, nor can they desaturate C-22. Thus, the reactions leading to these sterol modifications are particularly attractive targets for the development of drugs against fungal and protozoan pathogens that make them. In the present study, the definitive structures of 43 sterol molecular species in rat-derived Pneumocystis carinii were elucidated by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Ergosterol, Delta(5,7) sterols, trienes, and tetraenes were not among them. Most (32 of the 43) were 24-alkylsterols, products of S-adenosyl-L-methionine:C-24 sterol methyl transferase (SAM:SMT) enzyme activity. Their abundance is consistent with the suggestion that SAM:SMT is highly active in this organism and that the enzyme is an excellent anti-Pneumocystis drug target. In contrast, the comprehensive analysis strongly suggest that P. carinii does not form Delta(22) sterols, thus C-22 desaturation does not appear to be a drug target in this pathogen. The lanosterol derivatives, 24-methylenelanost-8-en-3 beta-ol and (Z)-24-ethylidenelanost-8-en-3 beta-ol (pneumocysterol), previously identified in human-derived Pneumocystis jiroveci, were also detected among the sterols of the rat-derived P. carinii organisms.",M2

The P. carinii topoisomerase I protein contains 763 amino acids and has a molecular mass of ca. 90 kDa. The expressed enzyme relaxes supercoiled DNA to completion and has no Mg2+ requirement. Cleavage assays reveal that both the human and P. carinii enzymes form covalent complexes in the presence of camptothecin, Hoechst 33342, and the terbenzimidazole QS-II-48. As with the human enzyme, no cleavage is stimulated in the presence of 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) or berenil. A yeast cytotoxicity assay shows that P. carinii topoisomerase I is also a cytotoxic target for the mixed intercalative plus minor-groove binding drug nogalamycin. In contrast to the human enzyme, P. carinii topoisomerase I is resistant to both nitidine and potent protoberberine human topoisomerase I poisons. The differences in the sensitivities of P. carinii and human topoisomerase I to various topoisomerase I poisons support the use of the fungal enzyme as a molecular target for drug development. Additionally, we have characterized the interaction of pentamidine with P. carinii topoisomerase I. We show, by catalytic inhibition, cleavage, and yeast cytotoxicity assays, that pentamidine does not target topoisomerase I.",M2

A handheld vacuum cleaner equipped with a high-retention bag was found to be superior to a 37-mm filter cassette attached to an electrically powered vacuum pump in terms of dust collection efficiency (87% [n = 37] versus 81% [n = 35]), although the precision of the two devices as assessed by the standard deviation was similar (6.2% versus 6.3%).

12037296,"Structure-based enzyme inhibitor design: modeling studies and crystal structure analysis of <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii dihydrofolate reductase ternary complex with PT653 and NADPH.Structural data are reported for N-(2,4-diaminopteridin-6-yl)methyldibenz[b,f]azepine (PT653), an example of structure-based inhibitor design with 21-fold selectivity for Pneumocystis carinii dihydrofolate reductase (pcDHFR) relative to rat liver dihydrofolate reductase (rlDHFR). These data test the hypothesis that 2,4-diaminopteridines with a bulky N,N-diarylaminomethyl side chain at the 6-position could fit better into the larger active site of pcDHFR than into that of mammalian DHFR. The crystal structure of the ternary complex of NADPH, PT653 and pcDHFR, refined to 2.4 A resolution, reveals that PT653 binds in a different orientation than predicted from modeling studies reported previously [Rosowsky et al. (1999), J. Med. Chem. 42, 4853-4860]. These crystal data show that the pteridine-ring plane is tilted compared with that observed in the crystal structure of the pcDHFR methotrexate (MTX) NADPH ternary complex used as a template to model PT653 binding. Also, as a result of this tilt, the dibenzoazepine ring is bound deeper into the p-aminobenzoyl folate binding pocket of pcDHFR, thereby relieving close intermolecular contacts predicted from the modeling data. By far the most significant structural change, but more subtle in magnitude, is the ligand-induced conformational shift of 1.2 A away from the inhibitor of residues 61-66 in helix C. The other major effect is the unwinding of the short helical segment involving loop 47 which has a different conformation to that observed in other pcDHFR complexes [Cody et al. (1999), Biochemistry, 38, 4303-4312]. The favorable pcDHFR selectivity of PT653 could be a result of ligand-induced fit of the large hydrophobic dibenzazepine ring which occupies regions of the enzyme active site not probed by other antifolates and which take advantage of sequence and conformational differences between the structures of human and pcDHFR. These data suggest that such hydrophobic analogs could be used as lead compounds in the design of more pcDHFR-selective antifolates. Enzyme inhibition data also show that PT653 is 102-fold selective for Toxoplasma gondii (tg) DHFR relative to rlDHFR. Homology-modeling studies of the tgDHFR structure suggest that differences in ligand-binding orientation and enzyme sequence could influence the enhanced selectivity of PT653 for tgDHFR.",M2

11982603,"Preservation of clonal heterogeneity of the <e>Pneumocystis</e> carinii-specific CD4 T cell repertoire in HIV infected, asymptomatic individuals.The loss of CD4 lymphocytes in HIV disease associates with opportunistic infections. Since diverse CD4 T cell clones respond to an opportunistic pathogen, we asked whether CD4 depletion deletes selected clones in the repertoire (vertical depletion) or it affects all clones by reducing the cell number in each progeny without affecting the overall number of clones (horizontal depletion). Understanding this point may help explain the mode of CD4 depletion and the mode of immunoreconstitution after therapy. Therefore we examined the CD4 T cell repertoire specific for Pneumocystis carinii, a relevant opportunistic pathogen in AIDS, in HIV-infected, asymptomatic individuals. We identified two patients of 36 asymptomatics for lack of proliferation to P. carinii, suggesting selective depletion of specific CD4 cells. To investigate clonal heterogeneity of P. carinii-responsive CD4 lymphocytes, specific CD4 T cell lines were generated and studied by TCR BV gene family usage and CDR3 length analysis (spectratyping). Clonal heterogeneity was similar in antigen-specific CD4 lines generated from P. carinii non-responding HIV seropositives and from controls. Thus, despite undetectable response to the pathogen, residual specific cells probably prevent overt infection and, when expanded in vitro, exhibit a clonal diversity similar to normal controls. These findings suggest a horizontal, rather than vertical, depletion in these asymptomatic patients.",M2

Pneumocystis remains difficult to study in the absence of culture methods for luxuriant growth. Recombinant protein technology now makes it possible to avoid some major obstacles. The P. carinii expressed sequence tag (EST) database contains 11 entries of a sequence encoding a protein homologous to S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM):C-24 sterol methyl transferase (SMT), suggesting high activity of this enzyme in the organism. We sequenced the erg6 cDNA, identified the putative peptide motifs for the sterol and SAM binding sites in the deduced amino acid sequence and expressed the protein in Escherichia coli. Unlike SAM:SMT from other organisms, the P. carinii enzyme had higher affinities for lanosterol and 24-methylenelanosterol than for zymosterol, the preferred substrate in other fungi. Cycloartenol was not a productive substrate. With lanosterol and 24-methylenelanosterol as substrates, the major reaction products were 24-methylenelanosterol and pneumocysterol respectively. Thus, the P. carinii SAM:SMT catalysed the transfer of both the first and the second methyl groups to the sterol C-24 position, and the substrate preference was found to be a unique property of the P. carinii SAM:SMT. These observations, together with the absence of SAM:SMT among mammals, further support the identification of sterol C-24 alkylation reactions as excellent targets for the development of drugs specifically directed against this pathogen.",M2
