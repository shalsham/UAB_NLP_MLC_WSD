20385362,"Dissecting the unique role of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor during cellular senescence.The <e>RB</e> protein family (RB, p107, and p130) has overlapping and compensatory functions in cell-cycle control. However, cancer-associated mutations are almost exclusively found in RB, implying that RB has a nonredundant role in tumor suppression. We demonstrate that RB preferentially associates with E2F target genes involved in DNA replication and is uniquely required to repress these genes during senescence but not other growth states. Consequently, RB loss leads to inappropriate DNA synthesis following a senescence trigger and, together with disruption of a p21-mediated cell-cycle checkpoint, enables extensive proliferation and rampant genomic instability. Our results identify a nonredundant RB effector function that may contribute to tumor suppression and reveal how loss of RB and p53 cooperate to bypass senescence.",M1
20107171,"Gelatinase expression in retinoblastoma: modulation of LH(BETA)T(AG) retinal tumor development by anecortave acetate.PURPOSE: Gelatinases, matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-2, and MMP-9 are known for their importance in angiogenesis and tumor biology. The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that anecortave acetate (AA) decreases transgenic retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) tumor burden by modulating gelatinase activity. METHODS: To assess the possible gelatinase modulation after AA treatment, a single subconjunctival injection of AA (300 microg) was delivered to the right eyes of 10-week-old LH(BETA)T(AG) mice. Eyes were evaluated for gelatinase expression and activity by gel and in situ zymography at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 1 week after treatment. RESULTS: Gel zymography of whole eye extracts and in situ zymography of retinal tumors showed strong gelatinase expression and activity within transgenic RB tumors. AA treatment in RB transgenic mice resulted in a significant decrease of gelatinase activity 1 week after AA treatment. Surprisingly, there was an initial transient upregulation of MMP-9 activity in whole eye extracts at 24 and 48 hours after AA treatment in both LH(BETA)T(AG) transgenic and wild-type mice. This increase was not observed in the tumors. CONCLUSIONS: As suggested by our data, inhibition of gelatinase activity appears to be a mechanism of action of AA. AA treatment results in a decrease in gelatinase activity that correlates with the significant decrease in tumor burden shown by the authors' previous studies. However, the significance of the initial, transient upregulation of gelatinase by AA injection is unknown, and further studies are warranted. Combining antiangiogenic agents with multiple mechanisms of action has the potential to enhance RB tumor control.",M1
20090211,"A comprehensive, sensitive and economical approach for the detection of mutations in the RB1 gene in retinoblastoma.Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy in children. It is brought about by the mutational inactivation of both alleles of RB1 gene in the developing retina. To identify the RB1 mutations, we analysed 74 retinoblastoma patients by screening the exons and the promoter region of RB1. The strategy used was to detect large deletions/duplications by fluorescent quantitative multiplex PCR; small deletions/insertions by fluorescent genotyping of RB1 alleles, and point mutations by PCR-RFLP and sequencing. Genomic DNA from the peripheral blood leucocytes of 74 Rb patients (53 with bilateral Rb, 21 with unilateral Rb; 4 familial cases) was screened for mutations. Recurrent mutations were identified in five patients with bilateral Rb, large deletions in 11 patients (nine with bilateral Rb and two with unilateral Rb), small deletions/insertions were found in 12 patients all with bilateral Rb, and point mutations in 26 patients (14 nonsense, six splice site, five substitution and one silent change). Three mutations were associated with variable expressivity of the disease in different family members. Using this method, the detection rates achieved in patients with bilateral Rb were 44/53 (83%) and with unilateral Rb, 5/21 (23.8%). This approach may be feasible for clinical genetic testing and counselling of patients.",M1
20041760,"G2-phase chromosomal radiosensitivity of primary fibroblasts from hereditary retinoblastoma family members and some apparently normal controls.We previously described an enhanced sensitivity for cell killing and gamma-H2AX focus induction after both high-dose-rate and continuous low-dose-rate gamma irradiation in 14 primary fibroblast strains derived from hereditary-type retinoblastoma family members (both affected RB1(+/-) probands and unaffected RB1(+/+) parents). Here we present G(2)-phase chromosomal radiosensitivity assay data for primary fibroblasts derived from these <e>RB</e> family members and five Coriell cell bank controls (four apparently normal individuals and one bilateral RB patient). The RB family members and two normal Coriell strains had significantly higher ( approximately 1.5-fold, P &lt; 0.05) chromatid-type aberration frequencies in the first postirradiation mitosis after doses of 50 cGy and 1 Gy of (137)Cs gamma radiation compared to the remaining Coriell strains. The induction of chromatid-type aberrations by high-dose-rate G(2)-phase gamma irradiation is significantly correlated to the proliferative ability of these cells exposed to continuous low-dose-rate gamma irradiation (reported in Wilson et al., Radiat. Res. 169, 483-494, 2008). Our results suggest that these moderately radiosensitive individuals may harbor hypomorphic genetic variants in genomic maintenance and/or DNA repair genes or may carry epigenetic changes involving genes that more broadly modulate such systems, including G(2)-phase-specific DNA damage responses.",M1
20039270,"Downregulation and aberrant promoter methylation of p16INK4A: a possible novel heritable susceptibility marker to retinoblastoma.<e>RB</e> loss has long been recognized as the causative genetic alteration underlying retinoblastoma but it is increasingly evident that other alterations are required for the tumor to develop. Therefore, we set out to identify additional inheritable susceptibility markers and new potential preventive and therapeutic targets for retinoblastoma. We focused on the p16INK4A tumor suppressor gene because of its possible role in retinoblastoma pathogenesis and its involvement in predisposition to familial cancer. p16INK4A expression was analyzed in tumor samples from retinoblastoma patients by immunohistochemistry and in peripheral blood cells from both patients and their parents by real-time quantitative reverse transcription-PCR (qRT-PCR). Since promoter methylation is a common mechanism regulating p16INK4A expression, the methylation status of its promoter was also analyzed in blood samples from patients and their parents by methylation-specific PCR. A downregulation of p16INK4A was observed in 55% of retinoblastoma patients. Interestingly, in 56% of the cases showing p16INK4A downregulation at least one of the patients' parents bore the same alteration in blood cells. Analysis of p16INK4A promoter methylation showed hypermethylation in most patients with p16INK4A downregulation and in the parents with the same alteration in p16INK4A expression. The finding that p16INK4A was downregulated both in patients and their parents suggests that this alteration could be a novel inheritable susceptibility marker to retinoblastoma. The observation that p16INK4A downregulation seems to be due to its promoter hypermethylation opens the way for the development of new preventive and therapeutic strategies using demethylating agents.",M1
20007825,"Inhibition of retinoblastoma in vitro and in vivo with conditionally replicating oncolytic adenovirus H101.PURPOSE: To determine the therapeutic effect of oncolytic adenovirus H101 on retinoblastoma in vitro and in vivo. METHODS: The expression of coxsackievirus-adenovirus receptor (CAR) in human retinoblastoma cell line HXO-<e>RB</e>(44) was determined by RT-PCR, Western blot, immunofluorescence, and immunocytochemistry staining. Appropriate multiplicity of infection was determined using flow cytometry in retinoblastoma cells with green fluorescent protein-expressing adenovirus (AdGFP). The viability of HXO-RB(44) cells treated with H101 or AdGFP was measured using a cell counting kit-8-based procedure. Viral proliferation in vitro was measured by end point dilution titration and real-time PCR. Cell cycle and apoptotic activity of HXO-RB(44) were analyzed by flow cytometry. NOD-SCID mice bearing retinoblastoma xenografts were treated with intratumoral injection of H101, AdGFP, or PBS. Tumor volume and survival time were recorded. Immunohistochemistry for adenoviral fiber protein and Western blot for adenoviral Hexon protein of retinoblastoma xenografts were performed to evaluate H101 virus replication in vivo. RESULTS: HXO-RB(44) cells expressed CAR and were sensitive to adenoviral infection. HXO-RB(44) cells treated with H101 had reduced cell viability compared with AdGFP-treated cells (P &lt; 0.01). Abundant replication of H101 in HXO-RB(44) cells resulted in G(2)/M-phase arrest and finally tumor cell lysis, but the apoptosis pathway was not activated. Tumor-bearing mice treated with H101 had reduced tumor burdens and prolonged survival times compared with PBS and AdGFP controls (both P &lt; 0.01). Immunohistochemical and Western blot examination revealed widespread replication of H101 within the tumor. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that H101 effectively inhibits the growth of retinoblastoma cells in vitro and in mice and may serve as a novel therapy for retinoblastoma.",M1
19967608,"[The relevance of molecular biology studies in the genetic counselling of Argentine retinoblastoma families]OBJECTIVE: Evaluate the relevance of RB1 mutations detection in the genetic counselling of Argentine retinoblastoma families. METHODS: We included in this study 34 Argentine families with bilateral and unilateral Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>). 130 DNA samples from leukocytes, tumors and chorionic villus were analyzed by indirect and direct molecular biology assays like Southern blot, segregation of polymorphisms BamHI, Rbi4, XbaI y Rb 1.20 (PCR-RFLP, PCR-STR), PCR-heteroduplex and sequencing of RB1 gene. RESULTS: Molecular biology analysis was informative in 18 out of 34 families studied (53%), 56% with bilateral and 44% with unilateral Rb. DNA tumor samples of 11 patients were available and could be studied by loss of heterozygosity (LOH) detection, that allowed us to identify the mutated RB1 allele in 9 (82%) patients. When tumor samples were not analized, the studies were informative only in 9 out of 23 patients (39%); we used direct mutation detection in 17 (41% informative) and indirect assays in 20 (60% informative) patients. CONCLUSIONS: The results prove the necessity to have DNA tumor, when the patient has been enucleated, and emphasize the importance of direct mutation detection in families with early sporadic Rb without tumor sample. The RB1 molecular biology contributed to the adequate genetic counselling of Argentine patients and relatives and their appropriate early treatment planning (Arch Soc Esp Oftalmol 2009; 84: 557-562).",M1
19958119,"Oxidative stress in retinoblastoma: correlations with clinicopathologic features and tumor invasiveness.PURPOSE: Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy of infancy and childhood, where tumor invasion into the choroid, optic nerve, and/or orbit are risk factors for metastasis. Here we have correlated oxidative stress with the clinicopathologic characteristics of retinoblastoma. METHODS: Tumor samples were processed for histopathologic examination. Malondialdehyde, a biomarker of oxidative stress, was immunohistochemically analyzed in 34 archival retinoblastoma tumor specimens, which included 17 tumors that did not have any invasion of the choroid, optic nerve, and/or orbit, and another 17 tumors that had some form of invasion of the choroid, optic nerve, and/or orbit. Lipid peroxidation levels were biochemically measured in another cohort of retinoblastoma tissue samples (n = 16), and correlated clinicopathologically. RESULTS: Malondialdehyde immunostaining was positive in all 34/34 (100%) tumors, and their corresponding clinicopathologic features were recorded. Malondialdehyde levels were significantly higher in tumors with invasion of the choroid, optic nerve, and orbit, when compared with tumors with no invasion (p &lt; 0.05). No significant correlation was noted between malondialdehyde immunoreactivity and the differentiation/laterality of the tumors. Lipid peroxidation levels increased significantly in tumors with invasion of the choroid, optic nerve, and orbit than in tumors without invasion (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: RB with invasion of the choroid, optic nerve, and/or orbit strongly correlates with increased oxidative stress.",M1
19927293,"Axenfeld-Rieger ocular anomaly and retinoblastoma caused by constitutional chromosome 13q deletion.Axenfeld-Rieger (AR) ocular anomaly might be due to deletions of different chromosomes. No association between AR, mental retardation, and retinoblastoma has been described. We report a 2-month-old female with general development delay and dysmorphic features. AR anomaly was detected, and a retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) was diagnosed in a very early stage. De novo 13q deletion was identified. Systemic chemotherapy, focal cryotherapy, transpupillary thermotherapy, brachytherapy, and intra-arterial chemotherapy were needed to control the RB. This is the first report of an association of AR, 13q deletion, and retinoblastoma, to be disclosed in patients born with such ocular and dysmorphic features.",M1
19786571,"Changes in retinoblastoma cell adhesion associated with optic nerve invasion.In the 1970s, several human retinoblastoma cell lines were developed from cultures of primary tumors. As the human retinoblastoma cell lines were established in culture, growth properties and changes in cell adhesion were described. Those changes correlated with the ability of the human retinoblastoma cell lines to invade the optic nerve and metastasize in orthotopic xenograft studies. However, the mechanisms that underlie these changes were not determined. We used the recently developed knockout mouse models of retinoblastoma to begin to characterize the molecular, cellular, and genetic changes associated with retinoblastoma tumor progression and optic nerve invasion. Here we report the isolation and characterization of the first mouse retinoblastoma cell lines with targeted deletions of the <e>Rb</e> family. Our detailed analysis of these cells as they were propagated in culture from the primary tumor shows that changes in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion are associated with retinoblastoma invasion of the optic nerve prior to metastasis. In addition, the same changes in cadherin-mediated cell adhesion correlate with the invasive properties of the human retinoblastoma cell lines isolated decades ago, providing a molecular mechanism for these earlier observations. Most importantly, our studies are in agreement with genetic studies on human retinoblastomas, suggesting that changes in this pathway are involved in tumor progression.",M1
19779100,"Acetylcholinesterase and HHV-8 in squamous cell carcinoma and retinoblastoma.Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) and human herpesvirus type 8 (HHV-8) antigens were studied in tissue sections from 56 squamous cell carcinomas (SCC) and five retinoblastomas (<e>Rb</e>). Approximately 62.5% of SCC and 80% of Rb showed positive staining for AChE. AChE staining in tumors was much higher than in normal control tissue. However, only 21.4% of SCC and 60% of Rb contained HHV-8 antigens. Of the 56 SCC, 17.9% were positive for both AChE and HHV-8 antigens, whereas 60% Rb were positive for both markers. The co-existence of AChE and HHV-8 antigens may play a role in the development of SCC and Rb. A possible mechanism for the development of these tumors is discussed.",M1
19760766,"Restrictions in daily life after retinoblastoma from the perspective of the survivors.BACKGROUND: Little is known about the impact of retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) on the health status of survivors in terms of disabilities and worries, both of which may restrict participation in activities of daily life. METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, content analysis was used to extract data on perceived restrictions and worries, from semi-structured interviews held with 156 RB survivors aged 8-35 years. The International Classification of Functioning Disabilities and Health (ICF) was used as a framework. RESULTS: Of all survivors, 55% perceive RB-related restrictions in daily life activities (school, professional career, mobility, self-care, intimate relationships). Young/adolescent survivors (6%) and adult survivors (15%) frequently report anxiety about developing a second primary tumor (SPT). Compared with the general population, RB survivors did not differ in rates of employment or marital status. However, special educational services were more frequently offered, and the level of completed education was lower. CONCLUSION: RB has influenced the lives of most survivors and, even though their prognosis was good, illness-related restrictions are common. Especially fear of developing SPT and of further loss of vision are important life-long problems, and many survivors had special education needs. The ICF might serve as a bridge between families and professionals, because this classification may facilitate early detection of problems.",M1
19737884,"Trichostatin A-induced TGF-beta type II receptor expression in retinoblastoma cell lines.PURPOSE: Retinoblastoma, an intraocular malignant tumor of childhood, is caused by a mutation in the retinoblastoma tumor-suppressor gene <e>RB</e>. Retinoblastoma cells are thought to be resistant to transforming growth factor-beta (TGF-beta) because they do not express the TGF-beta type II receptor (TbetaR-II). In several tumor cell lines, trichostatin A (TSA), a potent inhibitor of histone deacetylase, induces expression of the TbetaR-II gene. The objective of the present study was to determine the effects of TSA on TbetaR-II gene expression in retinoblastoma cells. METHODS: Four retinoblastoma cell lines were transfected with a TbetaR-II promoter-luciferase reporter construct and analyzed for the effect of TSA on TbetaR-II mRNA expression, TbetaR-II promoter activity, transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta-related signal transduction, and cell growth using RT-PCR, Western blot analysis, chromatin immunoprecipitation, luciferase activity assay, and cell viability assays. RESULTS: TSA treatment induced the expression of TbetaR-II mRNA, activated the TbetaR-II promoter, and inhibited cell growth in the examined retinoblastoma cell lines. It did not restore TGF-beta-related signaling, however. CONCLUSIONS: These data show that TSA induces the expression of TbetaR-II mRNA and activates the TbetaR-II promoter in retinoblastoma cells. However, TSA treatment alone was insufficient to restore TGF-beta signaling in these cell lines. The inhibitory effect of TSA on cell growth may be unrelated to its effect on TbetaR-II expression.",M1
19726429,"Allelic imbalance at 13q31 is associated with reduced GPC6 in Chinese with sporadic retinoblastoma.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) has been discovered in retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) in previous studies. In this study, we aimed to discover potential tumour suppressor genes through investigation of the incidence of allelic loss in chromosome 1, 6, 9, 13, 19, 20, 21, 22 and X in Chinese sporadic retinoblastoma patients and to study the expression of genes flanking LOH region 13q31. METHODS: Twenty-five microdissected RB samples were analysed to investigate the LOH in 140 microsatellite markers. Expression of genes flanking D13S265 was investigated by real-time quantitative-PCR on available frozen samples. The promoter and entire coding region of GPC6 were examined for sequence changes in an extended batch of 29 RB samples. RESULTS: Allele losses were found in 92% (23/25) of the tumours. We identified a new LOH locus at 13q31 (D13S265) with a high occurrence rate (67%, 14/21) apart from the RB1 locus (68%, 17/25). Expression study detected the reduced expression of Glypican 6 (GPC6) transcript significantly associated with the LOH at 13q31 (p=0.024). Furthermore, mutation screening revealed no remarkable sequence alteration in GPC6 that could affect its expression. CONCLUSION: Results suggest that a reduction in GPC6 mRNA in retinoblastoma is associated with the non-random allelic loss at 13q31 that could contribute to RB development.",M1
19693468,"Constitutional retinoblastoma gene deletion in Egyptian patients.BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma is a neuroblastic tumor of childhood with an incidence of 1: 20 000. Retinoblastoma gene (Rb1) is a tumor suppressor gene that is located on the long arm of chromosome 13 at region 14. This study was to evaluate the constitutional monoallelic Rb1 deletion among retinoblastoma families. METHODS: Nine families with an affected <e>Rb</e> proband were evaluated. Clinical examination, pedigree analysis, and complete eye examination were given to patients, their sibs and parents. Standard cytogenetic and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analyses were carried out for all of them. Also, two sib fetuses were tested for Rb1 deletion. RESULTS: No dysmorphic features were detected in any patient. Developmental milestones were within normal limit except in one proband who had a mild delay. The age of onset ranged from one month to 4 years. Positive family history was found in two families. In one, the father and 3 sibs had retinoblastoma, and in the other, 2 sibs were affected, but the parents were free. Chromosomal study revealed no abnormalities in all parents and sibs. Two patients had mosaic chromosome 13 abnormalities, 46,XY/46,XY,del(13)(pter--&gt;q14:) and 46,XX/46,inv(13)(q14q22). FISH analysis detected mosaic Rb1 deletion in two patients and excluded Rb1 deletion in two fetuses. CONCLUSIONS: The detection of genetic alterations affecting the Rb1 locus is important for the establishment of carriers, and prenatal and presymptomatic diagnosis. The search for deleted Rb1 mosaic cell lines is important for genetic counseling. Germline mutation may be considered as genetic transmission method of the Rb1 gene.",M1
19608529,"Noninvasive visualization of retinoblastoma growth and metastasis via bioluminescence imaging.PURPOSE: To establish human retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) animal models that allow sensitive, noninvasive and continuous monitoring of tumor growth and metastasis in vivo. METHODS: The human RB tumor cell lines HXO-Rb44 and Y79 were engineered to express a fusion reporter gene allowing for bioluminescence and fluorescence imaging. Intraocular and metastatic tumors were induced in immunodeficient nude mice by injection of bioluminescent RB cells into eye compartments and into the left ventricle or tail vein. The growth kinetics of intraocular and metastatic tumors was quantitatively and continuously monitored via bioluminescence imaging (BLI). RESULTS: Intraocular injection of HXO-Rb44-GFP-luc cells resulted in 100%, 80%, and 80% successful RB tumor development in the anterior chamber, vitreal cavity and subretinal space, respectively. The subretinal injection of Y79-GFP-luc cells resulted in 100% tumor development. BLI signal intensity correlated with the number of tumor cells injected as well as the weight of the tumor-bearing eyes. After bilateral subretinal injection of HXO-Rb44-GFP-luc cells, one of six RB tumor mice developed brain metastasis. Intracardiac injection of HXO-Rb44-GFP-luc cells resulted in metastatic disease in 9 of 15 nude mice, whereas tail vein injection resulted in metastasis in 1 of 16. Metastases were developed in multiple organs, including lymph nodes, bone, and brain, resembling the metastatic profile in patients with RB. CONCLUSIONS: BLI allowed sensitive, noninvasive, and quantitative localization and monitoring of intraocular and metastatic RB tumor growth in vivo and thus may be a useful tool to study RB biology as well as anti-RB therapies.",M1
19601762,"The <e>rb</e> pathway and cancer therapeutics.The retinoblastoma gene, Rb, was originally identified as the tumor suppressor gene mutated in a rare childhood cancer called retinoblastoma (reviewed in [1]). Subsequent studies showed that Rb functions in a pathway that is often functionally inactivated in a large majority of human cancers. Interestingly, recent studies showed that in certain types of cancers, Rb function is actually required for cancer development. The intimate link between the Rb pathway and cancer development suggests that the status of Rb activity can potentially be used to develop targeted therapy. However, a prerequisite will be to understand the role of Rb and its interaction with other signaling pathways in cancer development. In this review, we will discuss the roles of Rb in proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation by reviewing the recent findings in both mammalian systems and different model organisms. In addition, we will discuss strategies that can be employed that specifically target cancer cells based on the status of the Rb pathway.",M1
19582819,"Cytopathological diagnosis of adult retinoblastoma in a vitrectomy specimen.Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is extremely rare in adults. We describe a case of RB diagnosed by cytology in a vitrectomy specimen of a 23-year-old patient who presented with diminished visual acuity and retinal detachment in the absence of a clinically-visible mass. Cytological examination of the vitreous fluid showed clusters of loosely cohesive atypical cells with high nuclear to cytoplasmic ratio and  salt and pepper  chromatin pattern in a background of normal neuronal retinal cells. Nuclear molding was present as well as numerous apoptotic bodies. The cells were focally positive for epithelial markers and showed strong and diffuse positivity for neuroendocrine markers. Ki-67 stained 90% of the  atypical cells  nuclei, in contrast to nonneoplastic retinal neuronal cells, which were negative for the marker. A diagnosis of RB was rendered, and subsequently was confirmed in the enucleation specimen. The cytological differential diagnosis is discussed as well as the role that cytology and immunohistochemistry can play in differentiating neoplastic cells from normal retinal cellular elements in vitreous fluid specimens.",M1
19524506,"Retinoblastoma has properties of a cone precursor tumor and depends upon cone-specific MDM2 signaling.Retinoblastomas result from the inactivation of the RB1 gene and the loss of <e>Rb</e> protein, yet the cell type in which Rb suppresses retinoblastoma and the circuitry that underlies the need for Rb are undefined. Here, we show that retinoblastoma cells express markers of postmitotic cone precursors but not markers of other retinal cell types. We also demonstrate that human cone precursors prominently express MDM2 and N-Myc, that retinoblastoma cells require both of these proteins for proliferation and survival, and that MDM2 is needed to suppress ARF-induced apoptosis in cultured retinoblastoma cells. Interestingly, retinoblastoma cell MDM2 expression was regulated by the cone-specific RXRgamma transcription factor and a human-specific RXRgamma consensus binding site, and proliferation required RXRgamma, as well as the cone-specific thyroid hormone receptor-beta2. These findings provide support for a cone precursor origin of retinoblastoma and suggest that human cone-specific signaling circuitry sensitizes to the oncogenic effects of RB1 mutations.",M1
19491728,"Molecular karyotype of sporadic unilateral retinoblastoma tumors.BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is a childhood ocular malignancy associated with mutations in RB1, a tumor susceptibility gene. Inactivation of both copies of the RB1 gene in a retinal cell is followed by the sequential acquisition of additional genetic changes that define the course to tumor formation. METHODS: To identify the genetic events that cooperate with loss of the RB1 gene function, we performed a whole genome sampling assay based on single nucleotide polymorphism genotyping. We used DNA isolated from 25 sporadic, unilateral RB tumors and matched blood samples. RESULTS: Genomic profiles were analyzed to identify regions of loss of heterozygosity or amplification. Two major subclasses of RB tumors were defined by the presence (n = 18) or absence (n = 7) of loss of heterozygosity of chromosome 13. Loss of heterozygosity in most cases was the result of copy-neutral events caused by mitotic recombination and mitotic nondisjunction. Tumors harbored novel regions of amplification at 1q44, 3p25, 11q14, 11q25, 14q23, 15q21, 16p13, 17p11.2, 19q13, and 20q13, whereas regions of loss included 6q22, 7q21, and 21q2. CONCLUSION: Whole genome sampling assay-based analysis of unilateral RB tumors revealed novel regions as significant. These minimum critical regions that are lost or amplified are expected to harbor genes that aid the process of tumorigenesis.",M1
19443717,"Differential microRNA-34a expression and tumor suppressor function in retinoblastoma cells.PURPOSE: The role of miR-34a, a p53-regulated microRNA, in retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) was investigated. METHODS: The expression of miR-34 family members in RB cells was determined by semiquantitative RT-PCR and real-time qPCR. Regulation of miR-34a expression by p53-activating compounds was determined by qPCR analysis. The tumor suppressor functions of miR-34a in RB cell lines were determined by tetrazolium-based cell growth assay and by caspase-3/7 and activated caspase-3 apoptotic activity assays. Additive growth inhibitory properties of miR-34a in combination with topotecan were determined by cell growth assay. miR-34a targets in RB cells were identified by real-time qPCR expression analysis of previously reported and GenMiR++-predicted mRNAs. RESULTS: Differential miR-34a and miR-34b expression was observed in RB cell lines and tumor samples. miR-34a expression could be increased in Y79 cells, but not Weri-Rb1 cells, after p53 activation. This differential regulation was not caused by genomic alterations at the miR-34a p53 binding site or mature gene. Exogenous miR-34a inhibited Y79 and Weri-Rb1 cell growth and increased apoptotic activity in Y79 cells. Increased inhibition of Y79 and Weri-Rb1 cell growth was observed with combination miR-34a and topotecan treatment. mRNA expression changes were observed in 7 of 7 previously reported and 13 of 18 GenMiR++-predicted miR-34a targets after transfection of Y79 cells with miR-34a compared with negative control microRNA. CONCLUSIONS: miR-34a functions as a tumor suppressor in RB cells and is a potential therapeutic target. Differential expression, regulation, and activity of miR-34a in RB cells may suggest further p53 pathway inactivation in RB.",M1
19390654,"Germline mutations in retinoma patients: relevance to low-penetrance and low-expressivity molecular basis.PURPOSE: To study phenotype-genotype correlation in patients who have retinoma, which is a benign tumor resembling the post irradiation regression pattern of retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>). METHODS: We selected patients who had retinoma and positive family history for RB and patients who had retinoma in one eye and either retinoma or RB in the other eye. The study included 22 patients with available DNA: 18 from 11 families and four sporadic cases. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes. The RB1 gene was screened by DHPLC and direct sequencing of the promoter and all the exons. RESULTS: We identified 17 occurrences of 11 distinct germline mutations in two sporadic and in 15 familial cases (nine families). The 11 identified mutations were located in exons 1, 10,11,13,14, and 19 to 23. Four of the identified mutations were not previously reported, including g.64407delT, g.153236A&gt;T, g.156743delTCTG, and g.162078delA. Eight out the 11 mutations were truncating and three were nontruncating (missense). There was no correlation between the type of mutation and the number of tumor foci per eye (RB or retinomas). Highly heterogeneous intrafamilial expressivity was observed. CONCLUSIONS: To our knowledge, this study is the largest series of mutations of consecutive retinoma patients. The present data suggest that the type of inherited mutations underlying retinoma is undistinguishable from RB related ones, i.e., largely dominated by truncating mutants. This finding is in contrast with the RB1 genotypic spectrum of mutations associated with low-penetrance RB, i.e., nontruncating mutants. The molecular mechanism underlying low-penetrance and attenuated expressivity (retinomas) appeared to be distinct.",M1
19387079,"Molecular sequelae of histone deacetylase inhibition in human retinoblastoma cell lines: clinical implications.PURPOSE: To characterize the molecular sequelae induced in retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) cells by histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACIs). Hydroxamic acid-based HDACIs such as vorinostat (suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid) induce the differentiation and apoptosis of transformed cells. Vorinostat has demonstrated significant anticancer activity against hematologic and solid tumors at doses well tolerated by patients and has been approved for the treatment of patients with cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. METHODS: The authors evaluated the effects of the HDACIs vorinostat and m-carboxycinnamic acid bis-hydroxamide on the Rb cell lines Y79 and WERI-Rb1 with the use of the MTT assay, BrdU incorporation assay, flow cytometry, immunoblotting, gene-expression profiling, quantitative RT-PCR, and NF-kappaB DNA-binding assay. RESULTS: Both HDACIs were effective against both Rb cell lines, inducing growth arrest and apoptosis in vitro. Vorinostat increased p53 expression and activated caspases -8, -9 and -3, whereas caspase inhibition abrogated vorinostat-induced apoptosis. Vorinostat downregulated baseline NF-kappaB activity and potentiated the activity of the DNA-damaging chemotherapeutic doxorubicin. Gene expression profiling and qRT-PCR demonstrated that vorinostat modulated the mRNA levels of genes important for signal transduction, cell cycle, cellular metabolism, stress response, apoptosis, extracellular matrix synthesis, and cell differentiation. Notably, several transcripts involved in the ephrin and Notch signaling pathways were upregulated. CONCLUSIONS: HDACIs, such as vorinostat, induce caspase-dependent apoptosis in Rb cells, downregulate baseline NF-kappaB activity, and potentiate the effectiveness of conventional chemotherapy. The finding that vorinostat augments the effectiveness of doxorubicin provides a rationale for future clinical studies looking at the use of vorinostat in combination with conventional chemotherapy in Rb.",M1
19328781,"Oncolytic adenovirus delivering herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase suicide gene reduces the growth of human retinoblastoma in an in vivo mouse model.Oncolytic conditionally replicating adenoviruses (CRAd) can exclusively replicate in and lyse tumor cells and are therefore promising tools in cancer therapy. In this study, we combined the oncolytic potential of a CRAd with its ability to deliver a suicide gene (herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase suicide gene, HSVtk) in order to further enhance tumor cell killing in a human retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) mouse model. We could demonstrate that CRAd driven by the human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) promoter and armed with the HSV thymidine kinase suicide gene/ganciclovir (HSVtk/GCV) could very effectively reduce growth of human RB in an orthotopic nude mouse model. These findings suggest that hTERT promoter-driven CRAd in combination with HSVtk/GCV gene therapy could be a promising new approach for the treatment of RB. In addition, we found that hTERT promoter-driven CRAd replication occurred exclusively in human RB cells but not in primary human retinal pigment epithelial cells (hRPE), indicating that application of hTERT promoter-driven CRAd for the treatment of RB would be safe.",M1
19262251,"Expression of high mobility group A2 protein in retinoblastoma and its association with clinicopathologic features.Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is the commonest primary intraocular tumor in children. Overexpression of the high mobility group (HMG) A2 protein has been observed in a variety of malignant tumors and often correlates with poor prognosis. We studied the expression of HMGA2 in primary tumor samples and correlated with clinicopathologic features such as invasion, differentiation, and laterality of the tumors. Among 64 tumors, there were 29 tumors with invasion of the optic nerve, choroid, and/or orbit and 35 tumors without invasion. HMGA2 immunoreactivity was evaluated on archival paraffin sections and the results confirmed by Western blotting on 12 fresh tumor samples. Among 29 tumors with invasion, HMGA2 was strongly positive (++) in 10 tumors, moderately positive (+) in 11 tumors. Among 35 tumors without invasion, HMGA2 was strongly positive (++) in 6 tumors, moderately positive (+) in 6 tumors. Tumors with invasion showed significantly higher expression of HMGA2 compared with tumors without invasion (P&lt;0.01). Non-neoplastic retina was negative for HMGA2. There was no correlation between HMGA2 expression and differentiation/laterality. Western blotting revealed that 7 tumors were strongly positive, 2 were moderately positive, and 1 was faintly positive for HMGA2. Our study has demonstrated the HMGA2 expression in a large cohort of primary retinoblastoma tumors and its correlation with invasiveness.",M1
19252413,"High incidence of allelic loss at 16q12.2 region spanning RBL2/p130 gene in retinoblastoma.Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) is the most common intra-ocular tumor that manifests in early childhood. It is initiated by the inactivation of RB1/p105 gene, a prototype tumor suppressor gene. However, observed recurrent chromosomal aberrations accompanying RB1/p105 mutations suggest the involvement of additional mutational events. Chromosome 16q is one of the loci with recurrent losses which are likely to contain tumor suppressor genes. In this study, allelic loss was demonstrated at a second locus for retinoblastoma, RBL2/p130 on 16q12.2. Using intragenic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (rs1074182 and rs10748) and flanking extragenic microsatellite markers (D16S411 and D16S408), 40 retinoblastoma tumor samples were analyzed. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of these markers was found in 11 (57.9%) out of 19 informative tumors at the RBL2/p130 gene locus and while a total of 15 (78.9%) tumors showed LOH in at least one marker. Deletions extending more than 13 cM across the pericentromeric region of 16q12.1-q13 were inferred from four tumors. Microsatellite instability was observed in two other tumors at the flanking markers. No mutations were found in RBL2/p130 exons 19-22 coding for the protein domain critical for biological activity. This is the first evidence of LOH within RBL2/p130 gene in retinoblastoma. The high frequency of allelic loss provides further evidence on the implication of this gene in retinoblastoma development and/or progression.",M1
19222049,"Coping strategies of retinoblastoma survivors in relation to behavioural problems.OBJECTIVE: To assess coping strategies of long-term retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) survivors and explore determinants of behavioural functioning, including medical, socio-demographic and coping variables. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 117 RB survivors (12-35 years), registered in the Dutch national RB register. Survivors were asked to fill in coping, social support and behavioural questionnaires, and situational characteristics were obtained from medical archives and from an interview. Prevalence rates of coping strategies were computed based on self-reports. One-sample t-tests were applied to analyse differences in the use of coping strategies compared with healthy reference samples. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify various determinants for behavioural problems within the RB sample. RESULTS: RB survivors differed from their healthy reference group in one coping style, i.e. they showed significantly less emotion-oriented coping behaviour. Adolescents who came from a single-parent family and/or experienced lower social support and used more emotion-oriented coping reported more total problem behaviour. More internalizing problems were reported for adolescents who experienced less social support and less acceptance of the disease. For adults, more life events, emotion-oriented coping and lower social support explained more total problem behaviour, especially internalizing problems. CONCLUSION: RB survivors showed less emotion-oriented coping behaviour compared with the reference group. Behavioural problems are best determined by emotion-oriented coping, social support, life events other than RB and acceptance of the disease, and not by medical variables. Therefore, these variables should be taken into consideration during interventions for this group.",M1
19190782,"KIF14 and E2F3 mRNA expression in human retinoblastoma and its phenotype association.PURPOSE: We quantified mRNA expression of candidate genes for proliferation (KIF14 and E2F3) in a large retinoblastoma tumor cohort and associated with disease phenotype. METHODS: KIF14 and E2F3 mRNA expression was quantified by real time PCR in 57 retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) tumors, 3 RB cell lines, and control samples that included 4 each fetal, age-matched, adult retinas. Immunohistochemistry was done to confirm KIF14 and E2F3 protein expression in tumor cells. The mRNA expression levels were correlated with disease phenotypes including the significance of chemotherapy on tumors. RESULTS: There was statistically significant overexpression of KIF14 and E2F3 mRNA in tumors compared with control retinas (p&lt;0.0001). Further, E2F3 also showed a significant overexpression compared to RB cell lines (p=0.01). Immunohistochemistry confirmed KIF14 and E2F3 protein overexpression in tumor cells. KIF14 had significant mRNA overexpression with older age (p=0.01) in presenting patients and in unilateral RB patients (p=0.04). Chemotherapy-treated tumors showed a significant decrease in KIF14 and E2F3 expression compared to untreated tumors (p&lt;0.01 and 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: This report confirms significant mRNA overexpression of KIF14 and E2F3 together in a large cohort of RB tumors. The decreased expression in chemotherapy treated cases needs further validation in a large chemotherapy-treated cohort.",M1
19177832,"[Gigantic ovarian and suprarenal cysts ten years after enucleation of unilateral retinoblastoma]INTRODUCTION: Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is the most common eye tumour in children and is curable. Patients with hereditary RB have increased risk of developing additional tumours, predominantly sarcomas. The published results on the treatment of bilateral RB have shown that 10-15% of patients develop second primary tumours (SPT). Average latent period, e.g. the period from the diagnosis of bilateral RB to the appearance of SPT is 10.4 years. In the literature, the appearance of second benign tumours in patients suffering from unilateral and bilateral RB has not been analyzed separately. However, the size and the location of benign tumours can cause serious complications. CASE OUTLINE: We present a 14-year-old female patient. At age 4 years, her left eye was enucleated owing to unilateral RB. In the postoperative period, she did not undergo irradiation, nor did she receive chemotherapy. On her regular ophthalmologic check-up, the patient informed us that her belly was  swelling  over the past four months. She had no pains or other complaints. The abdomen was significantly above the level of the chest, tense, painless on palpation, with obvious fluctuations. Abdominal echosonography confirmed the presence of a huge multilocular cystic formation, 19 x 18 cm in diameter, spreading from the pelvis to the epigastrium, and pressing the liver and spleen. A cyst of 4.7 cm in diameter was observed in the upper pole of the left kidney. Both the gigantic cyst of the left ovary (weighing 10300 g) and the left suprarenal cyst (weighing 30 g) were removed. CONCLUSION: We report a patient who developed second non-ocular tumours (ovarian and suprarenal cysts) after successful treatment of unilateral RB. Patients treated for RB (hereditary and non-hereditary) should be checked regularly and meticulously. Early recognition of tumours, treatment can prevent possible complications.",M1
19150725,"How the <e>Rb</e> tumor suppressor structure and function was revealed by the study of Adenovirus and SV40.The review recounts the history of how the study of the DNA tumor viruses including polyoma, SV40 and Adenovirus brought key insights into the structure and function of the Retinoblastoma protein (Rb). Knudsen's model of the two-hit hypothesis to explain patterns of hereditary and sporadic retinoblastoma provided the foundation for the tumor suppressor hypothesis that ultimately led to the cloning of the Rb gene. The discovery that SV40 and Adenovirus could cause tumors when inoculated into animals was startling not only because SV40 had contaminated the poliovirus vaccine and Adenovirus was a common cause of viral induced pneumonia but also because they provided an opportunity to study the genetics and biochemistry of cancer. Studies of mutant forms of these viruses led to the identification of the E1A and Large T antigen (LT) oncogenes and their small transforming elements including the Adenovirus Conserved Regions (CR), the SV40 J domain and the LxCxE motif. The immunoprecipitation studies that initially revealed the size and ultimately the identity of cellular proteins that could bind to these transforming elements were enabled by the widespread development of highly specific monoclonal antibodies against E1A and LT. The identification of Rb as an E1A and LT interacting protein quickly led to the cloning of p107, p130, p300, CBP, p400 and TRRAP and the concept that viral transformation was due, at least in part, to the perturbation of the function of normal cellular proteins. In addition, studies on the ability of E1A to transactivate the Adenovirus E2 promoter led to the cloning of the heterodimeric E2F and DP transcription factor and recognition that Rb repressed transcription of cellular genes required for cell cycle entry and progression. More recent studies have revealed how E1A and LT combine the activity of Rb and the other cellular associated proteins to perturb expression of many genes during viral infection and tumor formation.",M1
19147556,"p18Ink4c and p53 Act as tumor suppressors in cyclin D1-driven primitive neuroectodermal tumor.The retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) tumor suppressor pathway is likely important in primitive neuroectodermal tumors (PNET) of the brain. In fact, 10% to 15% of children born with RB mutations develop brain PNETs, commonly in the pineal gland. Cyclin D1, which in association with cyclin-dependent kinase (Cdk) 4 and Cdk6 phosphorylates and inactivates the RB protein, is expressed in 40% of sporadic medulloblastoma, a PNET of the cerebellum. To understand tumorigenic events cooperating with RB pathway disruption in brain PNET, we generated a transgenic mouse where cyclin D1 was expressed in pineal cells. Cyclin D1 enhanced pinealocyte proliferation, causing pineal gland enlargement. However, proliferation ceased beyond 2 weeks of age with reversal of Cdk4-mediated Rb phosphorylation despite continued expression of the transgene, and the pineal cells showed heterochromatin foci suggestive of a senescent-like state. In the absence of the p53 tumor suppressor, cell proliferation continued, resulting in pineal PNET that limited mouse survival to approximately 4 months. Interestingly, the Cdk inhibitor p18(Ink4c) was induced in the transgenic pineal glands independently of p53, and transgenic mice that lacked Ink4c developed invasive PNET, although at an older age than those lacking p53. Analogous to our mouse model, we found that children with heritable RB often had asymptomatic pineal gland enlargement that only rarely progressed to PNET. Our finding that the Cdk4 inhibitor p18(Ink4c) is a tumor suppressor in cyclin D1-driven PNET suggests that pharmacologic interventions to inhibit Cdk4 activity may be a useful chemoprevention or therapeutic strategy in cancer driven by primary RB pathway disruption.",M1
19126594,"Crystal structure of human esterase D: a potential genetic marker of retinoblastoma.Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>), a carcinoma of the retina, is caused by mutations in the long arm of chromosome 13, band 13q14. The esterase D (ESD) gene maps at a similar location as the RB gene locus and therefore serves as a potential marker for the prognosis of retinoblastoma. Because very little is known about the structure and function of ESD, we determined the 3-dimensional structure of the enzyme at 1.5 A resolution using X-ray crystallography. ESD shows a single domain with an alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. A number of insertions are observed in the canonical alpha/beta-hydrolase fold. The active site is located in a positively charged, shallow cleft on the surface lined by a number of aromatic residues. Superimposition studies helped identify the typical catalytic triad residues--Ser-153, His264, and Asp230--involved in catalysis. Mutagenesis of any of the catalytic triad residues to alanine abolished the enzyme activity. Backbone amides of Leu54 and Met150 are involved in the formation of the oxyanion hole. Interestingly, a M150A mutation increased the enzyme activity by 62%. The structure of human ESD determined in this study will aid the elucidation of the physiological role of the enzyme in the human body and will assist in the early diagnosis of retinoblastoma.",M1
19125079,"Detection of human papillomavirus DNA in retinoblastoma samples: a preliminary study.Recent studies have shown the presence of human papillomavirus (HPV) genome in retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) tumor samples. There is no information on the HPV status in the RB tumors of Indian patients. We studied the presence of HPV genome in RB tumor samples from patients with unilateral tumor. Forty-four fresh RB tumor samples and 30 non-neoplastic donor retinas were analyzed for the presence of HPV 16 and 18 genome by nested and seminested polymerase chain reaction. Tumor tissue sections were also used to assess the expression of the retinoblastoma (Rb) protein. All 30 control tissues were negative for HPV genome. Among the 44 tumor samples, there were 23 tumors with invasion of optic nerve/choroid and 21 tumors with no invasion. HPV DNA was present in 21/44 (47%) RB tumors. Among 21 unilateral RB tumors that were positive for HPV DNA, HPV 16 was detected in 12/21 (57%) tumors. However, HPV 18 was negative in all the tumors. Rb protein was absent in 16 (71%) of 21 tumors that had HPV DNA. However, Rb was also absent in 20 (86%) of 23 tumors that were HPV negative. Children younger than 18 months old were significantly associated with the presence of HPV DNA compared with children above 24 months old (P&lt;0.014). Our study shows the presence of HPV and HPV 16 in a subset of RB tumor samples. However, further studies are in progress to know the role played by HPV in RB.",M1
19083227,"Radiation-sensitive genetically susceptible pediatric sub-populations.Major advances in pediatric cancer treatment have resulted in substantial improvements in survival. However, concern has emerged about the late effects of cancer therapy, especially radiation-related second cancers. Studies of childhood cancer patients with inherited cancer syndromes can provide insights into the interaction between radiation and genetic susceptibility to multiple cancers. Children with retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>), neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), Li-Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), and nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome (NBCCS) are at substantial risk of developing radiation-related second and third cancers. A radiation dose-response for bone and soft-tissue sarcomas has been observed in hereditary Rb patients, with many of these cancers occurring in the radiation field. Studies of NF1 patients irradiated for optic pathway gliomas have reported increased risks of developing another cancer associated with radiotherapy. High relative risks for second and third cancers were observed for a cohort of 200 LFS family members, especially children, possibly related to radiotherapy. Children with NBCCS are very sensitive to radiation and develop multiple basal cell cancers in irradiated areas. Clinicians following these patients should be aware of their increased genetic susceptibility to multiple primary malignancies enhanced by sensitivity to ionizing radiation.",M1
19073934,"RNA interference and retinoblastoma-related genes are required for repression of endogenous siRNA targets in Caenorhabditis elegans.In Caenorhabditis elegans, a vast number of endogenous short RNAs corresponding to thousands of genes have been discovered recently. This finding suggests that these short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) may contribute to regulation of many developmental and other signaling pathways in addition to silencing viruses and transposons. Here, we present a microarray analysis of gene expression in RNA interference (RNAi)-related mutants rde-4, zfp-1, and alg-1 and the retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) mutant lin-35. We found that a component of Dicer complex RDE-4 and a chromatin-related zinc finger protein ZFP-1, not implicated in endogenous RNAi, regulate overlapping sets of genes. Notably, genes a) up-regulated in the rde-4 and zfp-1 mutants and b) up-regulated in the lin-35(Rb) mutant, but not the down-regulated genes are highly represented in the set of genes with corresponding endogenous siRNAs (endo-siRNAs). Our study suggests that endogenous siRNAs cooperate with chromatin factors, either C. elegans ortholog of acute lymphoblastic leukemia-1 (ALL-1)-fused gene from chromosome 10 (AF10), ZFP-1, or tumor suppressor Rb, to regulate overlapping sets of genes and predicts a large role for RNAi-based chromatin silencing in control of gene expression in C. elegans.",M1
19043380,"The retinoblastoma paradigm revisited.BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) is the most common primary malignant intraocular tumour in childhood. The  two hit  theory, formulated by Knudson in 1971 to explain the variegated clinical expression of the disease, led to the discovery of the so called tumour suppressor genes and the identification of the Rb1 as the prototype of such genes. Mutations of the Rb1 gene are now commonly believed to be the  cause  retinoblastoma, although epidemiological, clinical, and biological evidences argue against it. MATERIAL/METHODS: The Authors have performed a systematic review of available data concerning clinical and diagnostic aspects of retinoblastoma, including molecular genetics. Meta analysis of literature data has been performed in order to validate some of the predictions made by the two hit theory. RESULTS: The following theses are discussed in detail: 1) there is no difference in the age at diagnosis between unilateral and bilateral retinoblastoma; 2) the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying familial, hereditary, and sporadic retinoblastoma are different; 3) bilateral retinoblastoma is not necessarily hereditary; 4) The real incidence of the unilateral phenotype within the familial group is disproportionately higher than that predicted by the  two hit ; 5) retinoblastoma is most probably  caused  by the combination of epigenetic factors and aneuploidy. CONCLUSIONS: Epidemiological, clinical, and more recent biological and genetic evidences, show that the  two hit  theory represents a rather simplistic, outdated, and unreliable model to explain tumour development and clinical evolution of retinoblastoma.",M1
19029022,"Phenotypic characterization of retinoblastoma for the presence of putative cancer stem-like cell markers by flow cytometry.PURPOSE: Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) is an intraocular tumor that grows rapidly and poses a threat to sight and life. Similar to other tumors, there is increasing speculation that the Rb tumor also contains cancer stem-like cells that could influence the prognosis and response to therapy. This study was undertaken in an attempt to identify putative stem-like cells by characterizing different subpopulations of cells in retinoblastoma. METHODS: Freshly isolated tumor cells obtained from unfixed eye specimens (n=7) were analyzed for the presence of CD44, ABCG2, CXCR4, CD133, and CD90 using flow cytometry. RT-PCR was performed to analyze the expression of human Syntaxin1A, PROX1, CD133, and NSE in the sorted subpopulation of tumor cells. RESULTS: Two different subpopulations of cells were observed in seven samples. The small cells, assigned FSC(lo)/SSC(lo) (forward scatter low/side scatter low, ranging from 1.7% to 17.7%) were characterized as positive for CD44 and negative for CD133, CXCR4, and CD90. The large cells were designated as FSC(hi)/SSC(lo) (ranging from 2.7% to 35.1%) and characterized as positive for all markers. RT-PCR analysis revealed that sorted cells of FSC(lo)/SSC(lo) subpopulation expressed the retinal progenitor cell markers PROX1 and Syntaxin1A. CONCLUSIONS: Retinoblastoma, on flow cytometric analysis, revealed two distinct subpopulations with variable expression of stem cell and retinal progenitor markers. In these populations, the FSC(lo)/SSC(lo) subpopulation appeared to be more primitive, since they expressed stem cell (CD44) and retinal progenitor markers (PROX1 and Syntaxin 1A) combined with a relatively lower percentage of differentiated markers. Moreover, the FSC(hi)/SSC(lo) subpopulation showed a higher percentage of differentiated markers (CD90 and CD133).",M1
18952925,"Blood vessel maturation in retinoblastoma tumors: spatial distribution of neovessels and mature vessels and its impact on ocular treatment.PURPOSE: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the spatial distribution of neovessels versus mature vessels in both human retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) and LH(BETA)T(AG) tumors, assess similarities and differences between the animal model and the human RB specimens, and determine whether vessel maturation is associated with risk factors for metastasis. METHODS: Immunohistochemical analyses were performed on human (n = 10) and LH(BETA)T(AG) (n = 11) enucleation specimens to evaluate the spatial distribution of neovessels and mature vessels. In human RB, vessel maturation was correlated with treatment history and metastatic risk factors. RESULTS: In human RB, the percentage of neovessels was higher in the periphery of the tumor than in the center (P = 0.021). This finding was mostly attributed to the distribution of large-caliber vessels (i.e., neovessels were higher in the periphery for large [P = 0.050]- and medium [P = 0.032]-caliber vessels; and mature vessels were higher in the center for large-caliber vessels [P = 0.032]). In this small series, vessel maturation did not correlate with risk for metastasis. Similar results were observed in LH(BETA)T(AG) tumors. The percentage of large-caliber neovessels was higher in the periphery than in the center (P = 0.038). CONCLUSIONS: There is a spatially distributed, heterogeneous vessel population containing neovessels and mature vessels in advanced RB disease. There is a significantly higher concentration of mature, large-caliber vessels in the center of tumors that is similar in human RB and LH(BETA)T(AG) retinal tumors. From these data the authors hypothesize that tumor vessel maturation in RB initiates in central regions of the tumor and radiates toward the periphery.",M1
18835587,"A novel population health approach: Using fish retinoblastoma gene profiles as a surrogate for humans.Retinoblastoma, a tumor suppressor gene, is frequently mutated in diverse types of human tumors. We have previously shown that two types of fish tumor, eye and liver, also possess mutant <e>Rb</e> genes. Our aim is to determine if the Rb allele status is linked to environmentally-induced cancer and whether this information in fish can be used to predict future phenotype. This is a proof-of-concept investigation to elucidate if fish may act as surrogates in assessing pollution-induced tumor incidence and inform regulatory authorities of potential long-term population health consequences. Marine flatfish, Limanda limanda, that display either normal liver histopathology, liver adenoma or liver hepatocellular carcinoma were analysed for the presence of Rb gene alterations. Several Rb alterations were detected in the fish displaying adenoma and carcinoma, and not in the surrounding normal tissue from the same individuals. The profile is similar to that reported in humans in that they spread across the gene, particularly exons 8-23, and a functionally important region of the protein. This Rb allele data was then used to build statistical classifier sets, linking Rb status with tumor pathology. Further flatfish caught from coastal-water areas of differing contaminant burden around the UK were subsequently analysed for the presence of Rb alterations. Using novel pattern matching statistics of the classifier sets compared with the coastal samples, the coastal fish were considered more similar to the characterised disease phenotype than the normal phenotype. Preliminary data suggests that using a statistical approach, based on classifying sets of histopathologically-defined tumor states, makes it possible to predict the phenotype of wild fish based on the status of the Rb allele. Since the Rb gene is orthologous, fish populations could act as surrogates for human populations in an eco-epidemiological investigation of the combined roles of genetics and environmental exposures in the tumorigenesis process.",M1
18799932,"Comparative genomic hybridization analysis of newly established retinoblastoma cell lines of adherent growth compared with Y79 of nonadherent growth.Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) shows cytogenetic aberrations involving genes other than RB gene located on 13q14. We analyzed genomic aberration in newly established RB cell lines SNUOT-RB1 and SNUOT-RB4 of adherent growth and Y79 cell line of nonadherent growth by microarray comparative genomic hybridization. SNUOT-RB1 showed 44 significant copy number changes (gain in 11 and loss in 33, P&lt;0.0005). SNUOT-RB4 showed 42 significant copy number changes (gain in 8 and loss in 34, P&lt;0.0005). Y79 cell line had the greatest gain of 19.65-fold in the locus of MYCN gene 2p24.1, whereas SNUOT-RB1 and SNUOT-RB4 showed no significant gain. SNUOT-RB1 and SNUOT-RB4 gained chromosomal copy numbers commonly in chromosome 11, especially in locus 11q13, which is responsible for cancer-related genes such as CCND1, MEN1, and FGF3. Losses of copy numbers occurred in chromosomes 3, 9, 10, 11, 16, and 17. In summary, SNUOT-RB1 and SNUOT-RB4 represented similar pattern in gain and loss of chromosomal copy number changes, while different from Y79.

18703556,"The success of primary chemotherapy for group D heritable retinoblastoma.AIMS: To report the ocular survival and event-free survival following primary multiagent chemotherapy for group D, heritable bilateral retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>). METHODS: The RB database was used to identify children with heritable, bilateral RB treated with primary chemotherapy (six cycles of vincristine, etoposide and carboplatin). Only Group D eyes with more than 12 months' follow-up were analysed. The timing, number and type of salvage treatments were recorded. Kaplan-Meier estimates for the ocular survival and event-free survival (percentage of eyes that avoided external beam radiotherapy and/or enucleation) were performed as a function of time. RESULTS: Of 18 group D eyes, two (11%) were treated successfully with chemotherapy alone, nine (50%) underwent successful salvage treatment, and seven (39%) were enucleated. The median time from completing chemotherapy to enucleation was 9 months (range 4 to 25 months). Ocular survival was 67% at 2 years. External beam radiotherapy proved successful salvage treatment in five of nine eyes, so the event-free survival was 34% at 2 years. CONCLUSION: Multiagent chemotherapy alone is rarely sufficient for the preservation of group D eyes. External beam radiotherapy and plaque radiotherapy remain important salvage treatments for advanced, heritable retinoblastoma.",M1
18628066,"Molecular biology of retinoblastoma.Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>), the most common intraocular tumor in childhood, is caused by the loss of function of both retinoblastoma susceptibility gene (RB1 or Rb1) alleles. In 1971, Alfred Knudson proposed his  two-hit  theory based upon empiric observations of the clinical genetics of Rb, revealing the role of tumor-suppressor genes in human cancer. Knudson proposed that:  In the dominant inherited form of Rb, one mutation is inherited via germ line and the second occurs in somatic cells. In the nonhereditary form, both mutations occur in somatic cells.  The Knudson hypothesis was validated later with the cloning of RB1, the first tumor-suppressor gene to be identified. A few years later, Harbour extended these findings to small-cell lung cancer, showing that the RB1 locus was disrupted in tumors other than Rb and osteosarcoma. Since then, it has been found that most, if not all, tumors have defects in their RB1 pathway through genetic lesions in the RB1 gene itself or other genes in the pathway. The history of Rb research highlights how basic research on a rare childhood cancer can have a much broader effect on a disease that affects millions of people each year worldwide.",M1
18619959,"Expression of p63 and p73 in retinoblastoma: a clinicopathological correlation study.The aim of the study was to explore the expression profile of p63, p73 and their delta isoforms in the retinoblastoma tumor samples and to correlate with clinicopathological parameters. Immunohistochemistry was performed for p63, delta p63, p73 and delta p73 on the archival paraffin sections of retinoblastoma and correlated with clinicopathological features. Western blotting was performed to confirm immunoreactivity results. p63 immunoreactivity was observed in 59% (29/49) of the <e>RB</e> specimens. p63 was expressed in 60% (20/33) low risk tumors and in 56% (9/16) of high risk tumors. p73 was expressed in 77% (38/49) RB specimens. Among the 33 low risk tumors, p73 was expressed in 69% (23/33) tumors and among the 26 high risk tumors, p73 was expressed in 93% (15/16) tumors. High risk tumors showed significantly increased expression of p73 compared to tumors with low risk (P&lt;0.05). This is the first correlation between p63/p73 expression and histopathology in human RB tumors. Our study showed increased expression of p73 in high risk tumors (P&lt;0.05) compared to low risk tumors. Further functional studies are required to explore the role of p63, p73 and their respective isoforms in retinoblastoma.",M1
18614803,"Basic fibroblast growth factor impact on retinoblastoma progression and survival.PURPOSE: Chemotherapy resistance is a problem in the treatment of advanced retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>). Since basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) is a survival factor for neural precursor cells, bFGF was evaluated as a growth and chemoresistance factor in RB. METHODS: bFGF expression was analyzed in the LH-betaTag transgenic mouse model of RB and human RB cell lines by immunofluorescence, RT-PCR, and Western blot. Proliferation and apoptosis (TUNEL) assays were performed. RESULTS: bFGF levels significantly increased during tumorigenesis in transgenic RB, as a function of tumor status (P = 0.005). PCR and confocal microscopy confirmed that the human cell lines and primary tumors expressed bFGF. bFGF was localized to vascular and tumor cells and rarely to glial cells. Exogenous 18-kDa bFGF induced proliferation in two RB cell lines (WERI and Y79). Western blot analysis demonstrated 34-, 22-, and 18-kDa isoforms in transgenic RB and both cell lines. In TUNEL assays, chemoresistance to carboplatin-induced apoptosis was observed in the Y79 line, which expressed a higher ratio of high (34 kDa)- to low-molecular-weight bFGF isoforms, compared with the WERI line. Similar to other bFGF tumor studies, exogenous low-molecular-weight (18 kDa) bFGF (1 ng) significantly enhanced carboplatin-induced apoptosis in the more chemosensitive WERI, but not the chemoresistant Y79 line. CONCLUSIONS: RB tumors produce significant amounts of bFGF, and the differential production and response to isoforms of bFGF may have implications for invasive tumor growth and chemoresistance.",M1
18613302,"Behavioural functioning of retinoblastoma survivors.OBJECTIVE: To assess behavioural problems in retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) survivors. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study included 148 RB survivors (8-35 years), registered in the Dutch national RB register. Survivors and parents were asked to fill in behavioural questionnaires. Prevalence rates were computed, based on both self-reports and proxy reports. One-sample T-tests were applied to analyse differences compared with healthy reference samples. Multiple regression analyses were performed to identify predictors for behavioural problems within the RB sample. RESULTS: Between-group differences varied across informants and across age groups. Parents reported significantly elevated total problem behaviour in 30% of their offspring (aged 8-17 years); this against 9% in adolescents (12-17 years) and 12% in adults (18-35 years) based on self-report. Parental reports showed significantly elevated rates of (1) internalising problems in boys and (2) somatic complaints in both girls and boys. Self-reports indicate significantly lowered levels of (1) externalising problems in adolescent and adult women and (2) thought problems in female adolescents and in adult men. Especially survivors who suffered hereditary RB, who had undergone more intensive treatment, and who came from a single-parent family were identified to be at most behavioural risk. CONCLUSION: Perception of severity and the nature of behavioural problems seem to differ between beholder, and to vary between age groups, if not between life stages. Health professionals should be aware that especially those who are confronted with hereditary RB and who subsequently undergo intensive treatment, and who grow up in broken families, run the risk of developing behavioural difficulties.",M1
18599993,"[Arsenic trioxide induced apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells in vitro and its possible mechanism]OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of arsenic trioxide on the apoptosis of retinoblastoma cell line HXO-<e>RB</e>(44) and the possible mechanism. METHODS: The effect of arsenic trioxide on the proliferation of retinoblastoma cell line HXO-RB(44) was observed by MTT colorimetric assay; the apoptosis of the HXO-RB(44) was examined by AO/EB staining and flow cytometry analysis (Annexin V+ PI staining); caspase-3 activity and bcl-2/bax expression in the HXO-RB(44) were detected by cpp32 colorimetric assay kit and Western blot. RESULTS: Arsenic trioxide inhibited the proliferation of HXO-RB(44) cell in dose and duration-dependent manner in vitro; arsenic trioxide significantly increased the apoptosis in HXO-RB(44) cells. The activation of caspase-3 was increased, and the rate of bcl-2/bax was down-regulated in the HXO-RB(44) cells processed with arsenic trioxide. CONCLUSION: Arsenic trioxide can inhibit the proliferation of retinoblastoma cell HXO-RB(44) in vitro by apoptosis induction. The apoptosis induction is possibly related to the caspase-3 activation and bcl-2/bax down-regulation.",M1
18579764,"Photodynamic therapy in retinoblastoma: effects of verteporfin on retinoblastoma cell lines.PURPOSE: In contrast to the excellent survival rates of the malignant childhood tumor retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>), morbidity is high in patients with this disease because of the enucleation or loss of retinal areas caused by current bulb-saving therapies. The authors aimed to preclinically assess the effects of photochemotherapy using second-generation photochemotherapeutics as a prerequisite to develop a promising therapeutic alternative. This therapy implies intravenous application of a photosensitizer activated locally by light of the appropriate wavelength. Activation leads to the formation of free radicals, vascular occlusion, and death of affected cells in the area of irradiation. The photosensitizer verteporfin is approved for the therapy of neovascularizations, such as age-related maculopathy. METHODS: The uptake of verteporfin in RB cell lines was investigated. Established RB cell lines, an RB subline resistant to etoposide, and dissociated cells from a primary RB were incubated with verteporfin and irradiated with activating laser light. Proliferation was measured at different time points after application. RESULTS: All five RB cell lines investigated incorporated verteporfin, and nanomolar concentrations were sufficient for effective killing. At lower doses, surviving cells started to proliferate again after several days, but verteporfin 50 ng/mL and 100 J/cm(2) were sufficient for irreversible killing. High verteporfin concentrations caused cell death with little to no irradiation. Etoposide-resistant cells and primary tumor cells had a comparable susceptibility to photodynamic therapy (PDT) as established parental cell lines. CONCLUSIONS: PDT using verteporfin efficiently kills chemotherapy-resistant and nonresistant retinoblastoma cell lines and primary tumor cells in vitro, and it warrants further preclinical evaluation as a therapeutic option for the treatment of retinoblastoma.",M1
18509746,"Identification of a mutation in exon 27 of the RB1 gene associated with incomplete penetrance retinoblastoma.Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) is initiated by germline mutations in the RB1 gene. Up to date, no mutation was identified in exons 26 and 27. We have identified a 2 bp frameshift insertion in exon 27 of the RB1 gene (RBg.177008_177009dup) in a boy with unilateral Rb and his healthy father that has occurred de novo on the allele transmitted by the father's father. RT-PCR showed that the mutant +2 bp transcript is present in RNA from peripheral leukocytes after short-term culture. The level of the mutant transcript was low compared to the normal transcript indicating abnormal expression of the variant allele. The mutant transcript was further reduced after puromycin treatment suggesting that NMD is not involved. Although oncogenic mutations in the terminal exons of the RB1 gene are rare molecular testing is important as those terminal mutations can be associated with incomplete penetrance and cause high recurrence risk in family members.",M1
18483379,"Evaluation of the in vitro and in vivo antitumor activity of histone deacetylase inhibitors for the therapy of retinoblastoma.PURPOSE: To evaluate the potential utility of histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) for treatment of retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>). EXPERIMENTAL DESIGN: Growth-inhibitory effects of HDACi [trichostatin A (TSA), suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA), or MS-275] were assessed in human and transgenic murine RB cells. Effects of TSA and MS-275 were also assessed in combination with standard therapeutic agents for RB. Proapoptotic effects of MS-275 and TSA were evaluated by caspase-3/7 activity, Annexin V translocation, and/or Bim expression analyses. Effects of MS-275 on cell cycle distribution and reactive oxygen species levels were determined by flow cytometry. Retinal tissue morphology was evaluated in mice after local administration of MS-275. Analysis of retinal acetyl-histone levels was used to assess MS-275 delivery after systemic administration. Therapeutic effects of MS-275 were determined in transgenic mouse and rat ocular xenograft models of RB after i.p. injection of 20 mg/kg every other day for 21 or 13 days, respectively. RESULTS: TSA, SAHA, and MS-275 dose dependently reduced RB cell survival. TSA and MS-275 showed additive growth-inhibitory effects in combination with carboplatin, etoposide, or vincristine. TSA and MS-275 increased caspase-3/7 activity. MS-275 increased Annexin V membrane translocation and induced G1 arrest. Cytotoxicity of MS-275 was dependent on increased reactive oxygen species levels and was reversed by antioxidant pretreatment. Intraocular administration of 1 microL of 10 micromol/L MS-275 did not alter ocular tissue morphology. Increased acetyl-histone levels confirmed MS-275 delivery to retinal tissue after systemic administration. MS-275 significantly reduced tumor burden in both mouse and rat models of RB. CONCLUSIONS: HDACi should be considered for clinical trials in children with RB.",M1
18439048,"Radiation sensitivity of primary fibroblasts from hereditary retinoblastoma family members and some apparently normal controls: colony formation ability during continuous low-dose-rate gamma irradiation.We previously described an enhanced sensitivity for cell killing and G(1)-phase cell cycle arrest after acute gamma irradiation in primary fibroblast strains derived from 14 hereditary-type retinoblastoma family members (both affected RB1(+/-) probands and unaffected RB1(+/+) parents) as well as distinctive gene expression profiles in unirradiated cultures by microarray analyses. In the present study, we measured the colony formation ability of these cells after exposure to continuous low-dose-rate (0.5-8.4 cGy/h) (137)Cs gamma radiation for a 2-week growth period. Fibroblasts from all <e>RB</e> family members (irrespective of RB1 genotype) and from 5 of 18 apparently normal Coriell cell bank controls were significantly more radiosensitive than the remaining apparently normal controls. The average dose rates required to reduce relative survival to 10% and 1% were approximately 3.1 and 4.7 cGy/h for the Coriell control strains with normal radiosensitivity and approximately 1.4 and 2.5 cGy/h for the radiosensitive RB family member and remaining apparently normal Coriell control strains. The finding that a significant proportion of fibroblast strains derived from apparently normal individuals are sensitive to chronic low-dose-rate irradiation indicates such individuals may harbor hypomorphic genetic variants in genomic maintenance and/or DNA repair genes that may likewise predispose them or their children to cancer.",M1
18437681,"Heat shock proteins and survivin: relationship and effects on proliferation index of retinoblastoma cells.Survivin and HSPs (heat shock proteins) are important anti-apoptotic proteins. However, limited research has been done regarding the collective effects of HSPs and survivin on the proliferative activities of <e>RB</e> cells. The purpose of this study was to narrow this gap by focusing on the expression of HSP70 and HSP90 and the interaction of these proteins with survivin. The proliferative activities of RB cells were analyzed by assessing the Ki-67 labeling index. Ki-67 recognizes a nuclear antigen expressed in all phases of the cell cycle except G(0) and early G(1), which makes it an excellent marker of cells in the proliferative phase. Immunohistochemical procedures were performed on retinal tissues from 43 RB patients who had undergone enucleation. Expression of HSP70, HSP90 and survivin was found in 65.12%, 86.05% and 62.79% of the cases respectively. No expression of any of these markers was found in normal retinal tissues. Expression of survivin was more frequent when HSP90 was detected than when HSP90 was not detected (P&lt;0.05). The Ki-67 labeling index was higher in cases in which HSP90 or survivin was found than in cases in which neither protein was found (P&lt;0.05). The Ki-67 labeling index was higher in cases positive for both HSP90 and survivin than in cases in which neither protein or only one protein was found (P&lt;0.05). Expression of HSP70 neither correlated with that of survivin, nor had any significant effect on the Ki-67 labeling index (P&gt;0.05). Although expression of HSPs and survivin and the Ki-67 labeling index did not correlate with histopathologic typing of RB (P&gt;0.05), our findings demonstrate that expression of HSP90 correlates with that of survivin in RB and the co-existence of survivin and HSP90 probably plays an important role in cellular proliferation in RB. Further work is indicated to clarify the role of these processes in progression of RB.",M1
18411872,"Mothers' explanations of communicating past health and future risks to survivors of childhood cancer.Mothers of survivors of Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) experience unique challenges communicating with their child about the condition. Children are mostly diagnosed within their first year but the consequences continue into young adult life. Here 39 mothers of Rb survivors (23 males, mean age = 10.26 years) were interviewed about their experiences. Mothers were asked about communication with their children about Rb, and future health risks. Interviews were analysed using thematic analysis. Mothers reported that they had informed children about past diagnosis and treatment but had spoken less about genetic risk or risk of secondary cancer. The child's age and information-seeking behaviour were associated with mothers' disclosure, along with mothers' perceptions that information would facilitate child coping. Findings suggest that mothers may need more guidance during follow-up care in communicating about the disease and its consequences for future health. Medical staff should also take extra care to ensure that mothers are aware of genetic counselling services and how to access them before the child is discharged from specialist care.",M1
18350306,"Identification of candidate cancer genes involved in human retinoblastoma by data mining.OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to discover potential cancer-related genes involved in retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) tumorigenesis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a data-mining tool called cDNA Digital Gene Expression Displayer (DGED) and serial analysis of gene expression DGED from the Cancer Genome Anatomy Project (CGAP) database, eight cDNA libraries and five serial analysis of gene expression libraries from retinoblastoma (RB) solid tumors and normal retina tissues were analyzed. The deregulated genes were classified into major families using information from Gene Ontology. Several candidate cancer-related genes were analyzed by real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) on tissue microarrays (TMA) of RB and human normal retina samples. RESULTS: A total of 260 genes with deregulated expression emerged when examined by DGED from the CGAP database. Functional classification of these genes not only provided an interesting insight into RB tumorigenesis but also facilitated target identification for RB therapeutics. Several candidate genes were confirmed by real-time RT-PCR and IHC analysis on TMA and were found to be associated with RB genesis through text-mining in Information Hyperlinked over Proteins. The results also implicated MCM7 and WIF1 as promising therapeutic targets for RB, but further validation is needed.",M1
18239449,"A new model of tumor susceptibility following tumor suppressor gene inactivation.Since the cloning of the first tumor suppressor gene 22 years ago, we have learned a great deal about the role of tumor suppressor pathways in human cancer. One general principle is that some tumor suppressor pathways (e.g., p53 and <e>Rb</e> pathways) are inactivated in virtually every human cancer. Thus, one might predict that inheritance of a genetic lesion in such a pathway would cause the rapid onset of tumors originating from different tissues. However, this is not true for the Rb pathway. Children with a defective copy of the RB1 gene show increased susceptibility to retinoblastoma but not to other developmental tumors of the nervous system. Moreover, after RB1 inactivation, certain retinal cell types are more susceptible to tumorigenesis than others. Our recent studies on the role of the Rb family of genes in retinal development and retinoblastoma have led to a new hypothesis that explains this paradox. We propose that cells that require the Rb family for their cell fate specification and/or differentiation are less susceptible to tumorigenesis than those that do not require the Rb family for these processes. If correct, this hypothesis would allow us to predict which cell types in the developing nervous system are susceptible to tumorigenesis after inactivation of the Rb family and may establish a general principle of tissue- and cell type-specific susceptibility to tumorigenesis. In this perspective, we discuss our recent findings that have changed our views on tumor initiation and progression following Rb family inactivation.",M1
18234990,"Subconjunctival topotecan in fibrin sealant in the treatment of transgenic murine retinoblastoma.PURPOSE: To test the effects of subconjunctival topotecan (TPT) in fibrin sealant (FS) in transgenic murine retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>). METHODS: Growth inhibitory, apoptotic, and cell cycle effects of TPT were assayed in human RB cell lines. In a dose-escalation study, eight groups of three 10- to 14-week-old wild-type mice were treated bilaterally with a single 30-microL injection of subconjunctival TPT in FS (0.025, 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.8, 1.6, or 3.2 mg/mL). Two groups of twenty 10-week-old LHbeta-Tag transgenic mice were then treated in the right eye only with TPT in FS (3.2 mg/mL in 30 microL; 0.1-mg total dose) or with FS only. The contralateral eye in each group was left untreated to serve as an internal control. After 3 weeks, ocular tumor burden was determined by histologic examination. RESULTS: At 48 hours, IC(50) values of TPT in Y79 and Weri-Rb1 RB cell lines were 35 nM and 50 nM, respectively. Growth inhibitory effects were correlated with increased apoptosis and accumulation of cells in G2. Cytotoxicity of TPT was comparable in aqueous media and in FS. In the dose-escalation study, no histopathologic evidence of ocular toxicity was observed at any dose. Clinical toxicities (mild enophthalmos and eyelid alopecia) were observed only at the highest dose tested (3.2 mg/mL). In the treatment study, both eyes of TPT-treated mice demonstrated significant reduction in tumor burden compared with both eyes of mice treated with FS only (59% reduction; P = 0.04). In mice treated with TPT, tumor burden in TPT-treated eyes and in untreated contralateral eyes did not differ significantly. CONCLUSIONS: Subconjunctival administration of TPT in FS to one eye allows the formation of a TPT depot sufficient for an effect to occur 3 weeks after treatment. This effect -- bilateral reduction in tumor burden without a significant difference in treated versus untreated eyes -- suggests that the major route of drug delivery in this system is hematogenous rather than transscleral.",M1
18196575,"The p75 NTR neurotrophin receptor is a tumor suppressor in human and murine retinoblastoma development.The transition from the benign retinal tumor retinoma to its malignant counterpart retinoblastoma is accompanied by the loss of expression of the p75(NTR) neurotrophin receptor. This change in expression is mimicked in the TAg-<e>RB</e> murine model of retinoblastoma, where early tumors retain expression of p75(NTR) and advanced tumors lack it. We sought to determine the functional effect on tumor development of absence of p75(NTR) from the onset of TAg-RB tumor initiation. TAg-RB mice were crossed with either p75(NTR) exon 3 (E3KO) or exon 4 knockout (E4KO) mice to produce TAg-RB offspring that lacked one or both normal p75(NTR) alleles. The average tumor area per eye as a percentage of retinal area was measured. TAg-RB/E3KO (TAg-RB(E3KO)) and heterozygous mice showed no significant difference in tumor area compared to the TAg-RB control mice at any time point studied. However, TAg-RB/E4KO (TAg-RB(E4KO)) and heterozygous mice displayed a significantly larger tumor area than the TAg-RB control mice. Furthermore, adenoviral-mediated expression of p75(NTR) in a p75(NTR)-deficient human retinoblastoma cell line resulted in increased apoptosis. Our results confirm that p75(NTR) suppresses progression of both human and TAg-RB murine retinoblastoma, and holds promise as a target for future therapy of the disease.",M1

CASE PRESENTATION AND INTERVENTION: The child was diagnosed as a case of RB of the right eye at the age of 9 months. He was fully investigated and found to have locally advanced RB with bone marrow involvement (Reese-Ellsworth stage IVA). Enucleation was recommended to the family, but they refused. The patient received chemotherapy and diode laser thermotherapy in Kuwait and the UK. He had a local relapse after 11 months and subsequently underwent enucleation of the right eye. After 3 years, he was investigated for a small swelling in his right lower leg. After extensive investigations, it was reported as Ewing's sarcoma. He was treated with chemotherapy, surgery (complete excision of the fibula) and high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplantation. The child is now nearly 2 years after completing the treatment and is disease free. CONCLUSIONS: This case confirms the increased risk of a second malignant neoplasm (SMN) in children with hereditary RB. These children need a very close follow-up for the early diagnosis of SMNs or even subsequent malignancies.",M1
18053178,"Health-related quality of life of child and adolescent retinoblastoma survivors in the Netherlands.BACKGROUND: To assess health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in children (8-11 years) and adolescents (12-18 years) who survived retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>), by means of the KIDSCREEN self-report questionnaire and the proxy-report version. METHODS: This population-based cross-sectional study (participation rate 70%) involved 65 RB survivors (8-18 years) and their parents. Child/adolescents' and parents' perception of their youth's HRQoL was assessed using the KIDSCREEN, and the results were compared with Dutch reference data. Relations with gender, age, marital status of the parents, and visual acuity were analyzed. RESULTS: RB survivors reported better HRQoL than did the Dutch reference group on the dimensions  moods and emotions  and  autonomy . Increased ratings of HRQoL in RB survivors were mainly seen in perceptions of the younger children and adolescent girls. RB survivors with normal visual acuity scored higher on  physical well-being  than visually impaired survivors. Age was negatively associated with the dimensions  psychological well-being ,  self-perception  (according to the child and parent reports) and  parent relations and home life  (according to the child).  Self-perception  was also negatively associated with visual acuity (according to the child). Only parents of young boys surviving RB reported lower on  autonomy  than the reference group, and parents of low visual acuity and blind RB survivors reported higher on  autonomy  than parents of visually unimpaired survivors. Survivors' perceptions and parents' perceptions correlated poorly on all HRQoL dimensions. CONCLUSION: RB survivors reported a very good HRQoL compared with the Dutch reference group. The perceptions related to HRQoL differ substantially between parents and their children, i.e. parents judge the HRQoL of their child to be relatively poorer. Although the results are reassuring, additional factors of HRQoL that may have more specific relevance, such as psychological factors or coping skills, should be explored.",M1
17996702,"Crystal structure of the retinoblastoma protein N domain provides insight into tumor suppression, ligand interaction, and holoprotein architecture.The retinoblastoma susceptibility protein, <e>Rb</e>, has a key role in regulating cell-cycle progression via interactions involving the central  pocket  and C-terminal regions. While the N-terminal domain of Rb is dispensable for this function, it is nonetheless strongly conserved and harbors missense mutations found in hereditary retinoblastoma, indicating that disruption of its function is oncogenic. The crystal structure of the Rb N-terminal domain (RbN), reveals a globular entity formed by two rigidly connected cyclin-like folds. The similarity of RbN to the A and B boxes of the Rb pocket domain suggests that Rb evolved through domain duplication. Structural and functional analysis provides insight into oncogenicity of mutations in RbN and identifies a unique phosphorylation-regulated site of protein interaction. Additionally, this analysis suggests a coherent conformation for the Rb holoprotein in which RbN and pocket domains directly interact, and which can be modulated through ligand binding and possibly Rb phosphorylation.",M1

17963824,"pRB detection as a common event in human retinoblastomas: an immunohistochemical study.Approximately 30% of the cases of retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>), the childhood eye cancer, are inherited and are manifested by unilateral or bilateral tumor. In sporadic tumors, accounting for 70% of cases, only one eye is affected. RB has three histological features: undifferentiated anaplastic cells, retinoblast pattern, and differentiated pattern characterized by Flexner Wintersteiner rosettes (FWR). Currently, results concerning phosphoprotein RB (pRB) expression in RB tumors are contradictory. In this study we detected pRB immunohistochemically in 10 tumors from bilateral or unilateral RBs, which did not show gross chromosomal alterations in cytogenetic studies. Interestingly, pRB was undetectable in only one tumor where we found distinct histological features. Our results suggest that pRB immunopositivity may be common in these tumors. However, it does not rule out the possibility that pRB is functionally inactive in some cases. This may be due to the protein being present in phosphorylated form or being altered by point mutations not affecting its expression. Another possibility is that mechanisms other than RB1 gene changes may lead to retinoblastoma because not all cases of retinoblastoma show gene alterations. Together these findings may be useful in understanding the molecular mechanisms associated with this type of pediatric tumor.",M1
17956737,"Differentiated horizontal interneurons clonally expand to form metastatic retinoblastoma in mice.During neurogenesis, the progression from a progenitor cell to a differentiated neuron is believed to be unidirectional and irreversible. The <e>Rb</e> family of proteins (Rb, p107, and p130) regulates cell-cycle exit and differentiation during retinogenesis. Rb and p130 are redundantly expressed in the neurons of the inner nuclear layer (INL) of the retina. We have found that in the adult Rb;p130-deficient retinae p107 compensation prevents ectopic proliferation of INL neurons. However, p107 is haploinsufficient in this process. Differentiated Rb(-/-);p107(+/-);p130(-/-) horizontal interneurons re-entered the cell cycle, clonally expanded, and formed metastatic retinoblastoma. Horizontal cells were not affected in Rb(+/-);p107(-/-);p130(-/-) or Rb(-/-);p107(-/-);p130(+/-), retinae suggesting that one copy of Rb or p130 was sufficient to prevent horizontal proliferation.

In this study, we investigated the role of mAChR activation in relation to its subtypes in human retinoblastoma cell-lines (WERI-<e>Rb</e>-1) using Ca(2+) measurement, real-time PCR, and Western Blot techniques. Acetylcholine (ACh) produced prominent [Ca(2+)](i) transients in a repeated manner in WERI-Rb-1 cells. The maximal amplitude of the [Ca(2+)](i) transient was almost completely suppressed by 97.3 +/- 0.8% after atropine (1 microM) pretreatment. Similar suppressions were noted after pretreatments with thapsigargin (1 microM), an ER Ca(2+)-ATPase (SERCA) inhibitor, whereas the ACh-induced [Ca(2+)](i) transient was not affected even in the absence of extracellular calcium. U-73122 (1 microM), a PLC inhibitor, and xestospongin C (2 microM), an IP(3)-receptor antagonist, elicited 11.5 +/- 2.9% and 17.8 +/- 1.9% suppressions, respectively. The 50% inhibitory concentration of (IC(50)) values for blockade of a 100 microM ACh response by pirenzepine and 4-DAMP were 315.8 and 9.1 nM, respectively. Moreover, both M(3) and M(5) mAChRs were prominent in quantitative real-time-PCR. Taken together, the M(3)/M(5) subtypes appear to be the major contributor, leading to intracellular calcium mobilization from the internal store via an IP(3)-dependent pathway in the undifferentiated retinoblastoma cells.",M1

In order to evaluate the potential value of PpIX, the expression profiles of genes involved in heme biosynthesis in human retinoblastoma WERI-Rb-1 and Y79 cells were analyzed by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression levels were highest in protoporphyrinogen oxidase (PPOX), uroporphyrinogen synthase and aminolevulinic acid synthase. Ferrochelatase expression showed a reduction compared to PPOX. PpIX levels were 15- and 18-fold higher in WERI-Rb-1 and Y79 cells, respectively, following induction by delta-aminolevulinic acid.

17657745,"Does the evidence matter in medicine? The retinoblastoma paradigm.Retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) is the most common intraocular malignant tumour in childhood, with an incidence of 1 in 15,000 live births. Complete information on this rare tumour can be easily accessed through the internet, although many aspect concerning the aetiology and pathogenesis of the disease, are still controversial. The  two hit  theory, formulated in 1971 to explain the variegated clinical expression of the disease, is based on the idea that single gene mutation may determine the development of cancer. However, this view does not take into account the most recent evidences showing the role of aneuploidy and chromosome instability in cancer. Also, a number of other genes and epigenetic mechanisms are involved in the genesis of retinoblastoma. More importantly, the  two hit  theory makes predictions, concerning the age distribution of the tumour, its mode of  transmission  (hereditary retinoblastoma), and its pathogenesis, which are not fulfilled by the clinical reality. Overall, the  two hit  theory represents a rather simplistic and outdated model to explain tumour development and clinical evolution of retinoblastoma.",M1
17615543,"Human embryonic and neuronal stem cell markers in retinoblastoma.PURPOSE: Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is the most common intraocular tumor of early childhood. The early onset of RB, coupled with our previous findings of cancer stem cell characteristics in RB, led us to hypothesize that subpopulations of RB tumors harbor markers and behaviors characteristic of embryonic and neuronal origin. METHODS: Our RB sources included: human pathological tissues, and the human RB cell lines Y79 and WERI-RB27. Microarray screening, single and dual-label immunocytochemistry and RT-PCR were performed to detect embryonic and neuronal stem cell markers, such as Oct3/4, Nanog, CD133, and Musashi-1. To test for functional evidence of stem cell behavior, we examined RB cells for their ability to form neurospheres and retain BrdU label as indicators of self-renewal and slow cell cycling, respectively. RESULTS: Microarray comparisons of human RB tumors with normal retinal tissue detected upregulation of a number of genes involved in embryonic development that were also present in Y79 cells, including Oct3/4, Nanog, Musashi-1 and Musashi-2, prominin-1 (CD133), Jagged-2, Reelin, Thy-1, nestin, Meis-1,NCAM, Patched, and Notch4. Expression of Musashi-1, Oct3/4 and Nanog was confirmed by immunostaining and RT-PCR analyses of RB tumors and RB cell lines. CD133 expression was confirmed by PCR analysis. Y79 and WERI-RB27 contained populations of Hoechst-dim/ABCG2-positive cells that co-localized with embryonic stem cell markers Oct3/4-ABCG2 and Nanog-ABCG2. Subpopulations of Y79 and WERI-RB27 cells were label-retaining (as seen by BrdU incorporation) and were able to generate neurospheres, both hallmarks of a stem cell phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: Small subpopulation(s) of RB cells express human embryonic and neuronal stem cell markers. There are also subpopulations that demonstrate functional behavior (label retention and self-renewal) consistent with cancer stem cells. These findings support the hypothesis that RB is a heterogeneous tumor comprised of subpopulation(s) with stem cell-like properties.",M1
17613328,"Secondary acute myelogenous leukemia in patients with retinoblastoma: is chemotherapy a factor?PURPOSE: To describe a series of patients with secondary acute myelogenous leukemia (sAML) and retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>). DESIGN: Retrospective observational cases series. PARTICIPANTS: Ocular and pediatric oncologists at referral centers in Europe and the Americas and the RB databases at the National Institutes of Health and the Ophthalmic Oncology Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. METHODS: Physician survey, retrospective database review, and literature search. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: History of RB and development of sAML, management of RB (surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy), age at diagnosis of RB and leukemia, French-American-British (FAB) subtype, and current status of patient (alive or dead). RESULTS: Fifteen patients with sAML were identified; 13 occurred in childhood. Mean latent period from RB to AML diagnosis was 9.8 years (median, 42 months). Nine cases were of the M2 or M5 FAB subtypes. Twelve patients (79 %) had received chemotherapy with a topoisomerase II inhibitor, 8 (43%) had received chemotherapy with an epipodophyllotoxin. Ten children died of their leukemia. CONCLUSIONS: Acute myelogenous leukemia is a rare secondary malignancy among retinoblastoma patients, many of whom were treated with primary or adjuvant chemotherapy. Additional studies are needed to assess potential risk factors contributing to sAML development in this cohort.",M1
17604597,"Identification of genes associated with tumorigenesis of retinoblastoma by microarray analysis.There is no report on the gene expression profile of retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>). We analyzed the gene expression profile of Rb by the microarray technique. One thousand four genes were upregulated and 481 genes were downregulated. Microarray data were confirmed by semiquantitative RT-PCR for 5 genes in Rb samples: CDC25A, C17orf75, ERBB3, LATS2, and CHFR. Clusters of differentially expressed genes were identified on chromosomes 1, 16, and 17. Based on the expression profile, we hypothesized that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR (insulin signaling) pathway might be dysregulated in Rb. Our semiquantitative RT-PCR analysis of the PIK3CA, AKT1, FRAP1, and RPS6KB1 genes in Rb samples supported this hypothesis. We suggest that known inhibitors of this pathway could be evaluated for the treatment of Rb.",M1
17565741,"Identification of tumorigenic retinal stem-like cells in human solid retinoblastomas.Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is the most common malignant tumor of the retina in human children. Although it has been hypothesized for a long time that RB derives from multipotent retinal stem cells (RSCs) or retinoblasts, the direct evidence that the presence of tumorigenic RSCs in RB tumors is still lacking. Some studies indicate that malignant tumors contain tumor stem cells similar to their normal tissue stem cell counterparts. With in vitro culture and differentiation method we demonstrate that tumorigenic retinal stem-like cells (RSLCs) indeed exist in RB lesions and that RB tumor-derived cultures encompass undifferentiated cells capable of extensive proliferation as clonal nonadherent neurospheres and can differentiate into different retinal cells in vitro. Interestingly, cultured cells expressed retinal development related genes including nestin, CD133, pax6, chx10 and Rx, and overexpressed Bmi-1, a gene required for self-renewal and proliferation of stem cells. Significantly, when these cultured cells were intraocularly transplanted into SCID mice, they gave rise to new tumors with histomorphological features and immunophenotypes similar to their parental primary RBs. The results show that RBs contain tumorigenic RSLCs that contribute to tumorigenesis. This study provides a new insight to investigate the histogenesis of RBs and establishes a model for other RB research.",M1
17551402,"Expression of matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors in retinoblastoma.Tumor invasion is the critical step that could lead to metastasis in retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>), a common childhood cancer. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) degrade extracellular matrix, which is a crucial step involved in various stages of tumor progression, including tumor angiogenesis, tumor growth, and also local invasion and subsequent distant metastasis. We investigated the role of extracellular MMP inducer (EMMPRIN), MMP-2, MMP-9 and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases (TIMPs): TIMP-1, TIMP-2 in RB and correlated clinicopathologically. Among 60 tumors, EMMPRIN was expressed in 40 (64%), MMP-2 in 41 (66%), MMP-9 in 38 (61%), TIMP-1 in 35 (56%), and TIMP-2 in 33 (53%) tumors. EMMPRIN was positive (3+) in 13 (39%) out of 33 tumors with invasion and was positive (3+) in only 1 (3%) out of 29 tumors without invasion. MMP-2 (P&lt;0.0001) and MMP-9 (P&lt;0.0001) were significantly positive (3+) in 7 (21%) and 12 (36%) out of 33 tumors with invasion, whereas positive (3+) in 3 (10%) and faint (1+) in 10 (34%) tumors, respectively, out of 29 tumors without invasion. TIMP-1 (P&lt;0.0001) and TIMP-2 (P=0.04) were significantly positive (3+) in 7 (21%) and 10 (30%), respectively out of 33 tumors with invasion, whereas positive (3+) in only 1 (3%) tumor each out of 29 tumors without invasion. Immunoblotting of tumors confirmed the presence of EMMPRIN, MMPs, and TIMPs. In conclusion, both MMPs and TIMPs may be involved RB invasion and EMMPRIN could play a role in up-regulation of MMP-2 in invasive RB.",M1
17547767,"Quality of life of adult retinoblastoma survivors in the Netherlands.BACKGROUND: To assess the quality of life (QoL) and predictors thereof in Dutch adult hereditary and non-hereditary retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) survivors. METHODS: In this population-based cross-sectional study, a generic QoL questionnaire (SF-36) and a disease-specific interview were administered to 87 adult RB survivors aged 18 to 35 years. Their QoL data were compared with those of a Dutch healthy reference group. Among the RB hereditary/non-hereditary survivors, the QoL was compared and predictors for QoL were identified by linear multiple regression analyses. RESULTS: As a group, RB survivors scored significantly lower than the reference group on the SF-36 subscale 'mental health' (t = -27, df = 86, p &lt; 0.01). Hereditary RB survivors scored lower on the subscale 'general health' (t = 2.6, df = 85, p &lt; 0.01) than non-hereditary RB survivors. Having experienced bullying, as a child was a predictor for the SF-36 subscales: 'physical functioning' (p &lt; 0.05), 'role functioning physical' (p &lt; 0.01), 'role functioning emotional' (p &lt; 0.05) and 'social functioning' (p &lt; 0.01). Having experienced bullying (p &lt; 0.01), but also subjective experience of impairment related to RB (p &lt; 0.05), was predictors for 'general health'. Subjective experience of impairment was a predictor for 'vitality' (p &lt; 0.01) and 'bodily pain' (p &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSION: In this exploratory study, it appears that the group of adult RB survivors experience a relatively good overall but slightly decreased QoL compared with the reference group. However, they report more problems with regard to their mental health (anxiety, feelings of depression, and loss of control). Hereditary RB survivors differ significantly from non-hereditary RB survivors only in 'general health'. Bullying in childhood and subjective experience of impairment are the main predictors of a worse QoL. In order to prevent worsening of QoL, or perhaps to improve it, clinicians should make an inventory of these issues at an early stage. We recommend further research to assess the specific psychological factors that may lead to mental health problems in this population.",M1
17525212,"Neurokinin-1 receptors located in human retinoblastoma cell lines: antitumor action of its antagonist, L-732,138.PURPOSE: The authors have recently demonstrated that substance P and L-733,060 induce cell proliferation and cell inhibition, respectively, in human retinoblastoma cell lines. However, the presence of neurokinin-1 receptors has not been demonstrated in such cell lines, nor is it known whether other neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists exert antitumoral action against retinoblastoma cell lines. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the presence of neurokinin-1 receptors in the human retinoblastoma cell lines WERI-<e>Rb</e>-1 and Y-79 and to study the growth inhibitory capacity of the neurokinin-1 receptor antagonist L-732,138 against those cell lines. The authors also sought to demonstrate that the administration of L-732,138 or L-733,060 induces apoptosis in retinoblastoma cells and that neurokinin-1 receptors and substance P are present in primary retinoblastoma. METHODS: Immunoblot analysis was used to determine neurokinin-1 receptors, and a Coulter counter was used to determine viable cell numbers; this was followed by application of the tetrazolium compound WST-8, a colorimetric method, to evaluate cell viability. DAPI stain was applied to assess chromatin condensation, characteristic of apoptosis, and immunoperoxidase was used to demonstrate neurokinin-1 receptors and substance P in eyes with primary retinoblastoma. RESULTS: Neurokinin-1 receptors were present in both retinoblastoma cell lines studied. Three identical bands (isoforms of approximately 33, 58, and 75 kDa) were observed in both cell lines. Moreover, L-732,138 inhibited the growth of both cell lines studied, with and without previous administration of substance P. This inhibition occurred in a dose-dependent manner, with the IC50 values of 60.47 microM for WERI-Rb1 and 56.78 microM for Y-79. Moreover, apoptosis was observed in both cell lines after the administration of L-732,138 or L-733,060. In fixed eyes with primary retinoblastoma, a high density of neurokinin-1 receptors was observed in tumor cells, whereas a very low number of such cells contained substance P. CONCLUSIONS: This study showed that the same isoforms of the neurokinin-1 receptor are present in human retinoblastoma cell lines WERI-Rb-1 and Y-79. Both L-732,138 and L-733,060 can induce apoptosis in these cell lines and therefore can act as antitumoral agents. Primary retinoblastoma specimens display neurokinin-1 receptor immunolabeling. These results suggest that the neurokinin-1 receptor may be a promising new target for the treatment of retinoblastoma.",M1
17452985,"Loss of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor: differential action on transcriptional programs related to cell cycle control and immune function.Functional inactivation of the retinoblastoma tumor suppressor gene product (<e>RB</e>) is a common event in human cancers. Classically, RB functions to constrain cellular proliferation, and loss of RB is proposed to facilitate the hyperplastic proliferation associated with tumorigenesis. To understand the repertoire of regulatory processes governed by RB, two models of RB loss were utilized to perform microarray analysis. In murine embryonic fibroblasts harboring germline loss of RB, there was a striking deregulation of gene expression, wherein distinct biological pathways were altered. Specifically, genes involved in cell cycle control and classically associated with E2F-dependent gene regulation were upregulated via RB loss. In contrast, a program of gene expression associated with immune function and response to pathogens was significantly downregulated with the loss of RB. To determine the specific influence of RB loss during a defined period and without the possibility of developmental compensation as occurs in embryonic fibroblasts, a second system was employed wherein Rb was acutely knocked out in adult fibroblasts. This model confirmed the distinct regulation of cell cycle and immune modulatory genes through RB loss. Analyses of cis-elements supported the hypothesis that the majority of those genes upregulated with RB loss are regulated via the E2F family of transcription factors. In contrast, those genes whose expression was reduced with the loss of RB harbored different promoter elements. Consistent with these analyses, we found that disruption of E2F-binding function of RB was associated with the upregulation of gene expression. In contrast, cells harboring an RB mutant protein (RB-750F) that retains E2F-binding activity, but is specifically deficient in the association with LXCXE-containing proteins, failed to upregulate these same target genes. However, downregulation of genes involved in immune function was readily observed with disruption of the LXCXE-binding function of RB. Thus, these studies demonstrate that RB plays a significant role in both the positive and negative regulations of transcriptional programs and indicate that loss of RB has distinct biological effects related to both cell cycle control and immune function.",M1

17363928,"Beta-lapachone inhibits proliferation and induces apoptosis in retinoblastoma cell lines.AIMS: To investigate the cytotoxicity of beta-lapachone, a potent agent that may selectively target tumour cells, in retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) cell lines. METHODS: Growth inhibitory effects of beta-lapachone were evaluated in Y79, WERI-RB1, and RBM human retinoblastoma cell lines. Pro-apoptotic effects of beta-lapachone were evaluated in Y79 cells by detection of caspase 3/7 activity, by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for nucleosome fragments, and by cellular morphological analysis. RESULTS: Beta-lapachone induced significant dose-dependent growth inhibitory effects in all three retinoblastoma cell lines. The 50% growth inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of this agent was 1.9 microM in Y79 cells, 1.3 microM in WERI-RB1 cells, and 0.9 microM in RBM cells. Beta-lapachone also induced proapoptotic effects in RB cells. Treatment of Y79 cells with 1.9 microM beta-lapachone (IC(50)) resulted in a peak, fourfold induction of caspase 3/7 activity at 72 h post-treatment; a peak, 5.6-fold increase in nucleosome fragments at 96 h post-treatment; and a peak, 1.7-fold increase in the frequency of apoptotic cells at 48 h post-treatment, relative to vehicle-treated controls. CONCLUSION: Beta-lapachone induced potent cytotoxic effects in RB cell lines at low micromolar concentrations, suggesting this agent could be useful in the clinical management of RB.",M1
17339135,"A defect in DNA double strand break processing in cells from unaffected parents of retinoblastoma patients and other apparently normal humans.Cells from unaffected parents of retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) patients were previously shown to be hypersensitive to radiation induced G(1) arrest and cell killing [1]. The hypersensitivity was similar to that reported for cells from ATM heterozygotes. The latter was consistent with a mild DNA DSB rejoining defect which we demonstrated using a gamma-H2AX focus assay after low dose-rate (LDR) irradiation of non-cycling G(0) cells [2,3]. Since neither parent carried the mutant RB allele of the RB heterozygous probands, these results suggested the possibility of an enhanced germline mutation rate, perhaps resulting from some mild defect in genome maintenance. We therefore examined levels of gamma-H2AX foci for cells from these RB parents in this G(0) LDR assay, which reflects the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) capacity of cells and in a G(2)/M assay, which reflects additional contributions from other G(2)-related damage processing systems. For several of the cell strains parallel radiosensitivity comparisons were made for cell killing and for G(2) chromosomal radiosensitivities. G(0) cells from the RB parents were clearly hypersensitive both in the LDR gamma-H2AX assay, and for cell killing. In addition, cultured fibroblasts from 6 of 15 apparently normal individuals in this study (and one of six in a previous study) were also hypersensitive in the same assays. In the G(2)/M gamma-H2AX assay, the relative sensitivities were similar to those seen in the low dose-rate G(0) assay and tracked with chromosomal radiosensitivity, but some differences were observed.",M1
17316610,"Expression of motility-related protein MRP1/CD9, N-cadherin, E-cadherin, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin in retinoblastoma.In our earlier study we showed that invasive retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) had down regulated tetraspanin protein KAI1/CD82, a family of cell surface glycoprotein. KAI1 may link to the cell surface molecules, such as integrins, E-cadherin, and other TM4SF members, and loss of KAI1 function may have a significant role in the progression of retinoblastoma. We also showed that epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) is overexpressed in invasive RB. EpCAM expression decreases adhesion mediated by cadherins. Thus, we were further interested in studying the role of other adhesion molecules like cadherins and catenins in RB. We studied the expression of Motility-Related Protein 1 (MRP-1)/CD9, E-cadherin, N-cadherin, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin in RB and correlated clinicopathologically in 62 archival paraffin-embedded tumors by immunohistochemistry. There were 29 tumors with no invasion of choroids/optic nerve and 33 tumors with invasion of choroid/optic nerve/orbit. Western blotting was performed on 20 tumors using the same antibodies. We observed higher expression of CD9 (P&lt;0.001), E-cadherin (P&lt;0.001) and alpha-catenin (P&lt;0.001) in the non-invasive RB and higher expression of N-cadherin (P&lt;0.001) in invasive RB. The expression of beta-catenin was not significantly different between two groups of tumors. In Western blotting, we were able to see CD9 and E-cadherin expression in a minority of tumors while N-cadherin, alpha-catenin and beta-catenin were expressed with differing intensities in a majority of tumors. Thus, invasive tumors expressed increased N-cadherin, alpha-catenin and decreased E-cadherin and CD9. Thus, it appears that loss of E-cadherin and gain of N-cadherin expression are features of invasiveness. Further functional studies are required to evaluate the role of beta-catenin in RB.",M1
17286451,"Retinoblastoma in India : microsatellite analysis and its application in genetic counseling.OBJECTIVES: This study was conducted with two objectives. The first was to estimate the frequency of loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of the RB1 gene as a mechanism in disease causation in tumors of patients from India. The second objective was to employ RB1 molecular deletion and microsatellite-based linkage analysis as laboratory tools, while counseling families with a history of retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>). METHODS: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and tumors of 54 RB patients and their relatives. Eight fluorescent microsatellite markers, both intragenic and flanking the RB1 gene, were used. After PCR amplification, samples were run on an ABI PRISM 310 genetic analyzer for LOH, deletion detection, and haplotype generation. RESULTS: LOH was found in conjunction with tumor formation in 72.9% of RB patients (39/54 patients; p=0.001; 95% CI 0.6028, 0.8417); however, we could not associate various other clinical parameters of RB patients with the presence or absence of RB1 LOH. Seven germline deletions (13% of RB patients) were identified, and the maternal allele was more frequently lost (p=0.01). A disease co-segregating haplotype was detected in two hereditary autosomal dominant cases. CONCLUSION: LOH of the RB1 gene could play an important role in tumor formation. Large deletions involving RB1 were observed, and a disease co-segregating haplotype was used for indirect genetic testing. This is the first report from India where molecular testing has been applied for RB families in conjunction with genetic counseling. In tertiary ophthalmic practice in India, there is an emerging trend towards the application of genetical knowledge in clinical practice.",M1
17286450,"RB1 germ-line deletions in Argentine retinoblastoma patients.BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is a malignant tumor originating in the retinal cell precursors and can be presented as a unilateral or bilateral form in childhood (one or both eyes affected). Development of this tumor is caused by mutations in the RB1 gene on chromosome 13q14; the first mutation may occur in the germ line (hereditary RB) or in somatic cells (non-hereditary RB). The hereditary form of RB is transmitted with a high penetrance to offspring (90%). Because early diagnosis is necessary for implementing effective treatment and preserving vision, it is important to identify the mutations in the affected family. AIM: The aim of this study was to identify large and small RB1 germ-line mutations and to correlate them with the RB phenotype. METHODS: Constitutional RB1 gene gross deletions were studied in 40 patients with bilateral or unilateral familial RB by a segregation assay of four intragenic polymorphisms located in introns 1, 4, 17, and 20 of the RB1 gene, along with fluorescence in situ hibridization (FISH) analysis. Small mutations were ascertained in a subgroup of ten patients by heteroduplex/sequence analysis of RB1-exons. RESULTS: In the course of our study, we have found three large deletions, which probably represent whole gene deletions, and two small deletions of 1bp in length. One large deletion was found in a family with several members affected. This represents a rare case of familial RB, which is usually caused by small mutations. Phenotype analysis of the family revealed a low penetrance inheritance, with an 'affected eyes : number of mutation-carriers' ratio of approximately 1.0, whereas this ratio in families with small loss-of-function mutations is 1.5-2.0. CONCLUSIONS: Our results emphasize the usefulness of a combined methodology that includes segregation of polymorphisms, FISH, and heteroduplex/sequence analyses for detection of gross and small DNA rearrangements in familial and sporadic RB. Identification of mutations in sporadic cases is important for risk-assessment in patients' relatives. The degree of penetrance in the inheritance of RB not only depends on the occurrence of the second mutation in the RB1 gene but also on the extent of inactivation of the first mutation.",M1
17235288,"Murine bilateral retinoblastoma exhibiting rapid-onset, metastatic progression and N-myc gene amplification.Human retinoblastoma is a pediatric cancer initiated by <e>RB</e> gene mutations in the developing retina. We have examined the origins and progression of retinoblastoma in mouse models of the disease. Retina-specific inactivation of Rb on a p130-/- genetic background led to bilateral retinoblastoma with rapid kinetics, whereas on a p107-/- background Rb mutation caused predominantly unilateral tumors that arose with delayed kinetics and incomplete penetrance. In both models, retinoblastomas arose from cells at the extreme periphery of the murine retina. Furthermore, late retinoblastomas progressed to invade the brain and metastasized to the cervical lymph nodes. Metastatic tumors lacking Rb and p130 exhibited chromosomal changes revealed by representational oligonucleotide microarray analysis including high-level amplification of the N-myc oncogene. N-myc was found amplified in three of 16 metastatic retinoblastomas lacking Rb and p130 as well as in retinoblastomas lacking Rb and p107. N-myc amplification ranged from 6- to 400-fold and correlated with high N-myc-expression levels. These murine models closely resemble human retinoblastoma in their progression and secondary genetic changes, making them ideal tools for further dissection of steps to tumorigenesis and for testing novel therapies.",M1

17163992,"<e>Rb</e> induces a proliferative arrest and curtails Brn-2 expression in retinoblastoma cells.BACKGROUND: Retinoblastoma is caused by loss of the Rb protein in early retinal cells. Although numerous Rb functions have been identified, Rb effects that specifically relate to the suppression of retinoblastoma have not been defined. RESULTS: In this study, we examined the effects of restoring Rb to Y79 retinoblastoma cells, using novel retroviral and lentiviral vectors that co-express green fluorescent protein (GFP). The lentiviral vector permitted transduction with sufficient efficiency to perform biochemical analyses. Wild type Rb (RbWT) and to a lesser extent the low penetrance mutant Rb661W induced a G0/G1 arrest associated with induction of p27KIP1 and repression of cyclin E1 and cyclin E2. Microarray analyses revealed that in addition to down-regulating E2F-responsive genes, Rb repressed expression of Brn-2 (POU3F2), which is implicated as an important transcriptional regulator in retinal progenitor cells and other neuroendocrine cell types. The repression of Brn-2 was a specific Rb effect, as ectopic p27 induced a G0/G1 block, but enhanced, rather than repressed, Brn-2 expression. CONCLUSION: In addition to Rb effects that occur in many cell types, Rb regulates a gene that selectively governs the behavior of late retinal progenitors and related cells.",M1

METHOD: Twenty-five RB mice were divided into 5 groups for the study(GO-G4). GO for control group received 0.9% sodium chloride injection subconjunctival. G1: 5 RB mice for systemic delivery received 6 systemic administration of Etoposide 150 microg and Cyclosporin A (CSA ) 1.0mg at 3 days intervals, respectively. G2-G4: 5 RB mice in each group received 6 subconjunctival delivery of Etoposide in 50, 75, 150 microg at 3 days intervals, respectively.To observe the changes of the volume of RB in anterior chamber and the part of conjunctiva for injections of chemotherapeutic drugs. All eyes and conjunctiva and scleras of the part for drugs injections were obtained at 6 weeks after experiment for histopathologic examination. The findings under the light microscope were analysed with software to measure the areas of RB in anterior chambers and the tumor inhibition rate. RESULTS: The volume of RB in anterior chambers for G1 and G2 increase quickly and none of the mice exhibited tumor control. The RB volume increase slowly in G3 and exhibit tumor control in G4. The areas of tumors in GO-G4 are 0.710,0.659,0.634, 0.515,0.235 mm(2), respectively. The rate for tumor inhibition in GO-G4 are 0.0%, 7.18%, 10.70%, 27.43% , 66.90%, respectively. There are statistical significant difference between the G1 and G4 for the volumes of tumors and the rate of tumor inhibition. The pathologic examination of subconjunctiva and sclera for the injective sites showed no pathologic changes. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant effects for the method of subconjunctival delivery of Etoposide in RB control, demonstrating a positive dose-related relationship. Subconjunctival injection of Etoposide reached better efficacy in controlling and inhibiting RB cells than systemic delivery of Etoposide for the same dose. The pathologic results showed the subconjunctival delivery of etoposide were safety for conjunctiva and sclera. It would be one of effective and safety method of chemotherapy for RB.",M1

MATERIAL/METHODS: The studies were carried out on a cohort of 100 sarcoma cases, i.e. Ewing's sarcoma (n=44), osteosarcoma (n=36), and rhabdomyosarcoma (n= 20), and on 50 retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) cases. RESULTS: Constitutional allelic deletion was found by FISH in 4% of sarcoma cases. Overall, 20% of sarcoma tumors showed p53 rearrangement by PCR/SSCP and Southern blot. Allelic deletion of p53 was detected in 78% of sarcoma and 55% of Rb tumors. p53 protein expression was detected by immunohistochemistry in 20% of sarcoma tumors. CONCLUSIONS: This study for the first time provided evidence of p53 alteration through allelic deletion that are common primary somatic mutation events which occur irrespective of grade and stage and are hence probably associated with an early phase of tumorigenesis and/or tumor progression. The studies also explored the occurrence of de novo constitutional deletion of p53 in sporadic childhood sarcomas.

The purpose of the present study was to explore further the mechanism of CTCF controlling Pax6 gene expression in human retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) cells and in the development of chicken and mouse retinas. METHODS: Northern and Western analyses were used to detect expressions of CTCF and Pax6 in Rb cells. Pax6 transcription reporter and deletion mutants were used to study the regulatory interaction between CTCF and Pax6 in Rb cells and in the retina of chicken embryos. CTCF transgenic chicken embryos and mice were established by lipofection and microinjection of linearized cytomegalovirus (CMV)-CTCF construct into fertilized eggs and mouse oocytes, respectively. Injected oocytes were implanted in the uterus of foster mothers through microinjection into the ovarian duct. The expression of CTCF and Pax6 was determined in embryo sections by immunochemistry. RESULTS: Stimulation of Rb cells with 10% FBS resulted in an increase in CTCF expression and a decrease in Pax6 expression. To study the regulatory mechanism, the Pax6 reporter and its deletion mutant activities were determined in transfected Rb cells and chicken embryonic retinas, revealing that CTCF interacts with the Pax6 gene in Rb cells through transcription control in the 5'-flanking region upstream from the Pax6 P0 promoter. Overexpression of CTCF in Rb cells suppressed Pax6 reporter activity and downregulated endogenous Pax6 expression. In contrast, downregulation of CTCF expression by knockdown of CTCF mRNA using specific small interfering (si)RNA markedly enhanced Pax6 expression in Rb cells. Further study in CTCF transgenic mouse embryos verified that overexpression of CTCF suppressed Pax6 gene expression in the retina. CONCLUSIONS: CTCF plays an important role in regulating Pax6 expression in Rb cells and in the developmental retina, and the regulation of Pax6 gene expression by CTCF in the retina is through transcriptional regulation.",M1
17099872,"Profiling genomic copy number changes in retinoblastoma beyond loss of RB1.Loss of both RB1 alleles is rate limiting for development of retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>), but genomic copy number gain or loss may impact oncogene(s) and tumor suppressor genes, facilitating tumor progression. We used quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction to profile  hot spot  genomic copy number changes for gain at 1q32.1, 6p22, and MYCN, and loss at 16q22 in 87 primary RB and 7 cell lines. Loss at 16q22 (48%) negatively associated with MYCN gain (18%) (Fisher's exact P = 0.031), gain at 1q32.1 (62%) positively associated with 6p  hot spot  gain (43%) (P = 0.033), and there was a trend for positive association between 1q and MYCN gain (P = 0.095). Cell lines had a higher frequency of MYCN amplification than primary tumors (29% versus 3%; P = 0.043). Novel high-level amplification of 1q32.1 in one primary tumor, confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridization, strongly supports the presence of oncogene(s) in this region, possibly the mitotic kinesin, KIF14. Gene-specific quantitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction of candidate oncogenes at 1q32.1 (KIF14), 6p22 (E2F3 and DEK), and tumor suppressor genes at 16q22 (CDH11) and 17q21 (NGFR) showed the most common gene gains in RB to be KIF14 in cell lines (80%) and E2F3 in primary tumors (70%). The patterns of gain/loss were qualitatively different in 25 RB compared with 12 primary hepatocellular carcinoma and 12 breast cancer cell lines. Gene specific analysis of one bone marrow metastasis of RB, prechemotherapy and postchemotherapy, showed the typical genomic changes of RB pretreatment, which normalized after chemotherapy.",M1
17096365,"Genotype-phenotype correlations in hereditary familial retinoblastoma.We studied 50 unrelated pedigrees with a family history of retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) (165 carriers of a RB1 mutation) to delineate the spectrum of RB1 germline mutations in familial Rb and to identify genotype-phenotype correlations as well as putative modifiers. Patients were followed at Institut Curie and they were examined by an ophthalmologist, a pediatrician, and a geneticist. All cases of familial Rb were determined via genetic counseling. Clinical features included disease status, laterality, age at diagnosis, mutation type, follow-up, and disease-eye ratio (DER). To eliminate mosaic cases, first-generation carriers displaying low-penetrance (LP) Rb were excluded from the analysis. Complete penetrance was the rule for nonsense and frameshift mutations (25 families) and high penetrance was observed for large rearrangements (eight families). Promoter (two families) and missense (two families) mutations displayed heterogeneous phenotypes and LP. Variable penetrance was observed for splice abnormalities (13 families) and was explained by in/out of frame mutations or respect of functional domains. Surprisingly, two families with the LP g.45867G&gt;T/IVS6+1G&gt;T mutation presented data that conflicted with the data reported in previous publications, as unaffected carriers had paternally inherited mutant alleles. Moreover, RNA analyses suggested that the lack of penetrance in unaffected carriers could be explained by an increase in expression levels of the wild-type allele. This observation prompted us to define a new class  3  of LP alleles. We believe this is the first large-scale study of familial Rb with a high level of homogeneity in the clinical and genetic analysis of patients and their relatives, thereby allowing for reliable intrafamilial genotype-phenotype correlations. Our analysis suggests in some cases the influence of modifier factors probably involved in mRNA level regulation and/or pRB pathway regulation.",M1
17091485,"SRPK1: a cisplatin sensitive protein expressed in retinoblastoma.Chemotherapy is an essential modality in the treatment of retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>). Mammalian serine/arginine-rich protein-specific kinase 1 (SRPK1) is a cisplatin-sensitivity-related protein and its downregulation is known to be associated with decreased response to cisplatin and carboplatin. We investigated the expression of SRPK1 in 63 archival RB and correlated its expression with pathologic staging and exposure to chemotherapy. The majority of the RB (62/63) were advanced stage (Groups D and E) with intermediate to high risk of treatment failure according to the new international classification for intraocular RB and SRPK1 was reduced in 32/62 (51%) tumors. SRPK1 protein expression was reduced in (100%) 8/8 RB that had recurred in the orbit or had metastasized. SRPK1 protein expression is reduced in RB with advanced stage of presentation and this may add to drug resistance mechanisms in RB.",M1

17080083,"Inactivation of the p53 pathway in retinoblastoma.Most human tumours have genetic mutations in their <e>Rb</e> and p53 pathways, but retinoblastoma is thought to be an exception. Studies suggest that retinoblastomas, which initiate with mutations in the gene retinoblastoma 1 (RB1), bypass the p53 pathway because they arise from intrinsically death-resistant cells during retinal development. In contrast to this prevailing theory, here we show that the tumour surveillance pathway mediated by Arf, MDM2, MDMX and p53 is activated after loss of RB1 during retinogenesis. RB1-deficient retinoblasts undergo p53-mediated apoptosis and exit the cell cycle. Subsequently, amplification of the MDMX gene and increased expression of MDMX protein are strongly selected for during tumour progression as a mechanism to suppress the p53 response in RB1-deficient retinal cells. Our data provide evidence that the p53 pathway is inactivated in retinoblastoma and that this cancer does not originate from intrinsically death-resistant cells as previously thought. In addition, they support the idea that MDMX is a specific chemotherapeutic target for treating retinoblastoma.",M1
17027002,"Expressions of Rac1, Tiam1 and Cdc42 in retinoblastoma.The Rho GTPases are the molecular regulators of the cell motility processes and are involved in cell cycle progression and gene transcription. We studied the expression of Rho-like GTPases molecules, particularly Rac, Tiam1 and cdc42, in retinoblastoma and correlated these with clinicopathological parameters of the tumors. Sixty-seven tumors were included which were divided in to two groups; group A: tumors with optic nerve/choroidal/orbital invasion (n=35) and group B: tumors with no invasion (n=32). Immunohistochemistry was done on paraffin sections for all the proteins and were confirmed by Western blot on fresh tumor samples. In group A tumors, Rac was positive in 10/35 (28%), cdc42 was positive in 12/35 (34%) and Tiam1 was positive in 30/35 (85%) tumors. In group 2 tumors, Rac was positive in 5/32 (15%), cdc42 was positive in 4/32 (12%) and Tiam1 was positive in 30/32 (93%) tumors. Two groups (both invasive and non-invasive tumors) showed decreased expression of Rac1 and cdc42 whereas Tiam1 was significantly expressed in invasive tumors compared to non-invasive tumors (P&lt;0.0001). We observed a 70K cleavage product of Tiam1 along with an 110K product by blotting in <e>RB</e> samples. Caspase-3 was also demonstrated in RB samples, which showed Tiam1 cleavage products. This is the first study that showed the expression patterns of Rac, cdc42 and Tiam1 in retinoblastoma tumors. Thus, further studies are required to prove the involvement of caspase-3 in the cleavage of Tiam1 in vitro in RB cells and to trace out alternative pathways involved in tumor progression.",M1
17011832,"Regulation of CDKN2A/B and Retinoblastoma genes in Xiphophorus melanoma.Xiphophorus interspecies hybrids provide several well-characterized genetic models of melanoma susceptibility. The Xiphophorus CDKN2A/B gene, homologous to mammalian CDKN2A/B cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors (p16 and p15), is a candidate tumor susceptibility gene in these models. Using real-time PCR and Western blot analysis, we analyzed expression of CDKN2A/B in spontaneous and UV-induced primary melanomas from individual backcross hybrid fish. We found that CDKN2A/B mRNA is highly expressed in melanomas (18-fold), relative to other fish tissues. Expression is also elevated, to a lesser extent (9.5-fold), in melanized skin from tumor-bearing fish. However, quantitative levels of CDKN2A/B mRNA in tumors varied considerably and positively correlated with expression of the Xmrk oncogene, suggesting possible functional interaction between Xmrk and CDKN2A/B expression. As a homolog corresponding to members of the mammalian CDKN2 family which regulate cell cycle progression at the G1 checkpoint, the CDKN2A/B p13 protein is a putative regulator of the G1 checkpoint apparatus in Xiphophorus. Since CDKN2A is often observed to be inversely regulated compared to <e>RB</e> in some human tumors, and is capable of transcriptionally regulating RB in human ovarian tumors, we cloned the Xiphophorus maculatus RB cDNA and analyzed RB expression by real-time PCR and Western blot analysis in the fish melanomas. These experiments were designed to ascertain whether CDKN2A/B and RB expression were inversely correlated. Our results indicate that RB mRNA was consistently expressed at only a 2-fold higher level in both tumors and melanized skin than in muscle. Qualitatively similar results were obtained for protein expression. These results collectively suggest that (i) Xmrk and CDKN2A/B may be co-regulated at the transcriptional level, and (ii) there is little, if any, alteration of RB expression in Xiphophorus melanomas.",M1
16988938,"Attenuation of disease phenotype through alternative translation initiation in low-penetrance retinoblastoma.Hereditary predisposition to retinoblastoma (<e>RB</e>) is caused by germline mutations in the retinoblastoma 1 (RB1) gene and transmits as an autosomal dominant trait. In the majority of cases disease develops in greater than 90% of carriers. However, reduced penetrance with a large portion of disease-free carrier is seen in some families. Unambiguous identification of the predisposing mutation in these families is important for accurate risk prediction in relatives and their genetic counseling but also provides conceptual information regarding the relationship between the RB1 genotype and the disease phenotype. In this study we report a novel mutation detected in 10 individuals of an extended family, only three of whom are affected by RB disease. The mutation comprises a 23-basepair (bp) duplication in the first exon of RB1 (c.43_65dup) producing a frameshift in exon 1 and premature chain termination in exon 2. Mutations resulting in premature chain termination classically are associated with high penetrance disease, as message translation may not generate functional product and nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) frequently eliminates the mutant transcript. However, appreciable NMD does not follow from the mutation described here and transcript expression in tissue culture cells and translation in vitro reveals that alternative in-frame translation start sites involving Met113 and possibly Met233 are used to generate truncated RB1 products (pRB94 and pRB80), known and suspected to exhibit tumor suppressor activity. These results strongly suggest that modulation of disease penetrance in this family is achieved by internal translation initiation. Our observations provide the first example for rescue of a chain-terminating mutation in RB1 through alternative translation initiation.",M1
16966622,"Small molecule inhibition of HDM2 leads to p53-mediated cell death in retinoblastoma cells.PURPOSE: To determine the efficacy of inducing p53-mediated cell death in retinoblastoma cells by Nutlin 3A, a small molecule HDM2 inhibitor. METHODS: Retinoblastoma cell lines WERI-<e>RB</e>-1 and Y79 were treated with Nutlin 3A. Cell viability assays, Western blot analyses, confocal microscopy, and flow cytometry were performed to measure cell survival, p53 protein levels, activation of downstream targets, and apoptosis. To determine whether the effects of Nutlin 3A were p53-dependent, cell viability assays were performed on Y79 cells expressing short interfering RNA (siRNA) against p53. RESULTS: Nutlin 3A induced cell death in Y79 and WERI-RB-1 in the 5- to 10-microM dose range. Treated cells demonstrated increased protein levels of p53 and the p53 targets p21 and HDM2. Phosphorylation of p53-serine-15, a marker for activation of p53 via genotoxic mechanisms, was absent. Y79 cells expressing siRNA against p53 demonstrated resistance to Nutlin 3A. CONCLUSIONS: Nutlin 3A induced p53-mediated apoptosis in a dose-dependent, nongenotoxic fashion in 2 retinoblastoma cell lines. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Nutlin 3A is effective against retinoblastoma cells in a nongenotoxic manner. Because the mutagenic effects of radiation and chemotherapy may increase risks of secondary tumor formation, targeted p53 activation may be a safer alternative treatment for retinoblastoma in the future.",M1
16952195,"Gene therapy for BCR-ABL+ human CML with dual phosphorylation resistant p27Kip1 and stable RNA interference using an EBV vector.BACKGROUND: BCR-ABL-mediated chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) CD34(+) cell proliferation mostly depends on the nucleo-cytoplasmic ratio of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27. The ubiquitin-ligase SCF(Skp2) promotes degradation of phosphorylated p27 at T187 in the nucleus, resulting in G1/S progression of the cells. On the other hand, phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K)-directed T157 nuclear localization signal (NLS) phosphorylation results in cytoplasmic sequestration of p27, leading to abnormal integrin-mediated proliferation of CD34(+) CML cells. METHODS: We demonstrate the generation of an engineered Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) vector with a BAC backbone that has the unique capacity to carry doubly modified (DM) p27 (i.e. T187A, T157A p27) along with the BCR-ABL siRNA expression construct. The HSV-tk suicide gene has also been incorporated in the same vector, which promotes apoptosis in a BCR-ABL-independent pathway. RESULTS: Expression of DM p27 markedly inhibits proliferation of BCR-ABL(+) primary human CML cells. Moreover, DM p27 strongly inhibits the growth of imatinib-resistant CML cells, compared to the T157A p27 (SM p27). The CML growth inhibition is found to be the result of significant G1/S arrest with concomitant increase in hypophosphorylated retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>). Moreover, the EBV vector mediated stable RNA interference induces apoptosis in K562 cells and reduces myeloid colony forming units. CONCLUSIONS: We therefore propose a multi-gene delivery strategy for BCR-ABL(+) CML cells by targeting not only the fusion transcript, but also the downstream signaling, to overcome drug resistance in the acute phase of CML.",M1
16936757,"Mortality from second tumour among long-term survivors of retinoblastoma: a retrospective analysis of the Italian retinoblastoma registry.Survivors of retinoblastoma (<e>Rb</e>) are at high risk of dying from second malignant tumour. The occurrence of second malignant neoplasm (SMN) and related mortality in a cohort of 1111 cases from the Italian Retinoblastoma Registry was analysed, considering the possible role of both genetic and iatrogenic causes. Rb patients had a greater than 10-fold excess in overall mortality compared with the general population (standardized mortality ratio (SMR) 10.73, 95% CI 9.00-12.80). Their excess risk attributable to cancers other than Rb was 14.93 95% CI 10.38-21.49). Survivors of hereditary Rb had an SMR for all causes of 16.25 (95% CI 13.20-20.00), whereas their SMR for all cancers was 25.72 (95% CI 17.38-38.07). Survivors of unilateral sporadic Rb had an SMR of 4.12 from all cancers (95% CI 1.55-10.98) and a much higher excess for overall mortality (SMR 13.34, 95% CI 10.74-16.56).

16936754,"Involvement of <e>RB</e> gene family in tumor angiogenesis.Angiogenesis, the development of new blood vessels from pre-existing vessels, represents a fundamental step in tumor progression and metastatization. The induction of vasculature is required for growth of the tumor mass, to ensure an adequate supply of oxygen and metabolites to the tumor beyond a critical size. Tumor angiogenesis is a highly regulated process that is controlled physiologically by the tumor microenvironment and genetically by alteration of several oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. We will focus on recent demonstrations regarding the involvement of the retinoblastoma family proteins (phosphorylated retinoblastoma (pRb), p107 and pRb2/p130) at different levels of the angiogenic process. pRb and its homologs can regulate the expression of pro- and antiangiogenic factors, such as the vascular endothelial growth factor, through an E2F-dependent mechanism. Moreover, pRb is able to modulate also the transcriptional activity of several angiogenesis-related factors like HIF-1, Id2 and Oct-1. pRb2/p130 is required for both differentiation and mobilization of bone marrow-derived endothelial cell precursors and endothelial sprouting from neighboring vessels. The involvement of the pRb pathway in the angiogenesis process has also been demonstrated by different cellular models expressing viral oncoproteins, like human papilloma virus. Moreover, some natural and synthetic compounds demonstrate their antiangiogenetic activity with a mechanism of action involving pRb. Finally, the possible prognostic value of immunohistochemical evaluation of pRb and/or pRb2/p130 expression can represent a useful tool for the characterization of the angiogenic phenotype of specific tumor histotypes.",M1
16936751,"<e>RB</e> family members as predictive and prognostic factors in human cancer.The retinoblastoma family members--pRb, pRb2/p130 and p107--are tumor suppressor genes involved in controlling four major cellular processes: growth arrest, apoptosis, differentiation and angiogenesis. Molecular genetic studies have identified abnormalities of these tumor suppressor genes in a large proportion of human cancers. These genetic alterations have emerged as significant factors in the pathogenesis and progression of many types of tumors and are therefore likely to provide relevant information to assess risk in cancer patients. There is a pressing clinical need to identify prognostic and predictive factors for patients with cancer, because there is an undeniable importance in being able to determine which patients will have a favorable outcome without further therapy (prognostic factor) and which will need some additional treatment (predictive factor). This review examines the predictive and/or prognostic role of each retinoblastoma family member in human cancer.",M1
20302352,"Critical role of the isoform-specific region in alpha1-Na,K-ATPase trafficking and protein Kinase C-dependent regulation.The isoform-specific region (ISR) is a region of structural heterogeneity among the four isoforms of the catalytic alpha-subunit of the Na,K-ATPase and an important structural determinant for isoform-specific functions. In the present study, we examined the role of a potential dileucine clathrin adaptor recognition motif [DE]XXXL[LI] embedded within the alpha1-ISR. To this end, a rat alpha1 construct where leucine 499 was replaced by a valine (as found in the alpha2 isoform sequence) was compared to wild-type rat alpha1 after stable expression in opossum kidney cells. Total Na,K-ATPase expression, activity, or in situ (86)<e>Rb</e>(+) transport was not affected by the L499V mutation. However, surface Na,K-ATPase expression was nearly doubled. This increase was associated with a reduced rate of internalization from the cell surface of about 50% after a 4 h chase and became undetectable if clathrin-coated pit-mediated trafficking was blocked with chlorpromazine. Further, PKC-induced stimulation of Na,K-ATPase-mediated (86)Rb(+) uptake was doubled in mutant-expressing cells, comparable to the chimera containing the intact alpha2-ISR. Similar results were observed when the potential motif was disrupted by means of an E495S mutation. These findings suggest that a dileucine motif embedded within the Na,K-ATPase alpha1-ISR plays a critical role in the surface expression of Na,K-ATPase alpha1 polypeptides at steady state and in the response to PKC activation.",M2

Experimentally, the bond energies are determined using threshold collision-induced dissociation of the Rb(+)(AA) complexes with xenon in a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer. Analyses of the energy dependent cross sections include consideration of unimolecular decay rates, internal energy of reactant ions, and multiple ion-molecule collisions. 0 K bond energies of 108.9 +/- 7.0, 115.7 +/- 4.9, 122.1 +/- 4.6, and 125.2 +/- 4.5 kJ/mol are determined for complexes of Rb(+) with Gly, Ser, Thr, and Pro, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations are conducted at the B3LYP, B3P86, and MP2(full) levels of theory with geometries and zero point energies calculated at the B3LYP level using both HW*/6-311+G(2d,2p) and Def2TZVP basis sets. Results obtained using the former basis sets are systematically low compared to the experimental bond energies, whereas the latter basis sets show good agreement. For Rb(+)(Gly), the ground state conformer has the rubidium ion binding to the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid, and a similar geometry is found for Rb(+)(Pro) except the secondary nitrogen accepts the carboxylic acid hydrogen to form the zwitterionic structure. Both Rb(+)(Ser) and Rb(+)(Thr) are found to have tridentate binding at the B3LYP and MP2(full) levels, whereas the B3P86 slightly prefers binding Rb(+) at the carboxylic acid.

20049853,"Ion transport in a human lens epithelial cell line exposed to hyposmotic and apoptotic stress.Membrane transport changes in human lens epithelial (HLE-B3) cells under hyposmotic and apoptotic stress were compared. Cell potassium content, K(i), uptake of the K congener rubidium, <e>Rb</e>(i), and water content were measured after hyposmotic stress induced by hypotonicity, and apoptotic stress by the protein-kinase inhibitor staurosporine (STP). Cell water increased in hyposmotic (150 mOsm) as compared to isosmotic (300 mOsm) balanced salt solution (BSS) by &gt;2-fold at 5 min and decreased within 15 min to baseline values accompanied by a 40% K(i) loss commensurate with cell swelling and subsequent cell shrinkage likely due to regulatory volume decrease (RVD). Loss of K(i), and accompanying water, and Rb(i) uptake in hyposmotic BSS were prevented by clotrimazole (CTZ) suggesting water shifts associated with K and Rb flux via intermediate conductance K (IK) channels, also detected at the mRNA and protein level. In contrast, 2 h after 2 microM STP exposure, the cells lost approximately 40% water and approximately 60% K(i), respectively, consistent with apoptotic volume decrease (AVD). Indeed, water and K(i) loss was at least fivefold greater after hyposmotic than after apoptotic stress. High extracellular K and 2 mM 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) but not CTZ significantly reduced apoptosis. Annexin labeling phosphatidylserine (PS) at 15 min suggested loss of lipid asymmetry. Quantitative PCR revealed significant IK channel expression during prolonged hyposmotic stress. Results suggest in HLE-B3 cells, IK channels likely partook in and were down regulated after RVD, whereas pro-apoptotic STP-activation of 4-AP-sensitive voltage-gated K channels preceded or accompanied PS externalization before subsequent apoptosis.",M2

A long loop (L3) carrying multiple acidic residues folds into the beta-barrel pore to form a narrow  constriction zone . A strong and highly conserved charge asymmetry is observed at the constriction zone, with multiple basic residues attached to the wall of the beta-barrel (Lys16, Arg42, Arg82 and Arg132) on one side, and multiple acidic residues of L3 (Asp107, Asp113, Glu117, Asp121, Asp126, Asp127) on the other side. Several computational studies have suggested that a strong transverse electric field could exist at the constriction zone as a result of such charge asymmetry, giving rise to separate permeation pathways for cations and anions. To examine this question, OmpF was expressed, purified and crystallized in the P6(3) space group and two different data sets were obtained at 2.6 A and 3.0 A resolution with K(+) and <e>Rb</e>(+), respectively. The Rb(+)-soaked crystals were collected at the rubidium anomalous wavelength of 0.8149 A and cation positions were determined.

19828839,"Developmental and functional studies of the SLC12 gene family members from Drosophila melanogaster.The electroneutral cation-chloride cotransporter gene family, SLC12, contains nine members in vertebrates. These include seven sodium and/or potassium-coupled chloride transporters and two membrane proteins of unknown function. Although SLC12 family members have been identified in a number of lower species, the functional properties of these proteins are unknown. There are five SLC12 homologues in Drosophila melanogaster, including at least one member on each of the four main branches of the vertebrate phylogenetic tree. We have employed in situ hybridization to study the expression patterns of the Drosophila SLC12 proteins during embryonic development. Our studies indicate that all five members of this family are expressed during early embryogenesis (stages 1-6), but that spatial and temporal expression patterns become more refined as development proceeds. Expression during late embryogenesis was seen predominantly in the ventral nerve cord, salivary gland, gut, and anal pad. In parallel studies, we have carried out transport assays on each of the five Drosophila homologues, expressed as recombinant proteins in the cultured insect cell line High Five. Under our experimental conditions, we found that only one of these proteins, CG4357, transported the potassium congener (86)<e>Rb</e>. Additional experiments established that rubidium transport via CG4357 was saturable (K(m) = 0.29 +/- 0.05 mM), sodium-dependent (half-saturation constant = 53 +/- 11 mM), chloride-dependent (half-saturation constant = 48 +/- 5 mM), and potently inhibited by bumetanide (inhibitor constant = 1.17 +/- 0.08 muM), a specific inhibitor of Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransporters.

19717680,"X-ray microanalysis of <e>Rb</e>+ entry into cricket Malpighian tubule cells via putative K+ channels.Elemental imaging by X-ray microanalysis of fully frozen-hydrated samples shows that when Malpighian tubules of the black field cricket (Teleogryllus oceanicus L.) are incubated in saline in which Rb(+) has been substituted for K(+), Rb(+) replaces much of the cellular K(+) in the main segment of control Malpighian tubules and this is prevented by incubation in saline containing Ba(2+), a non-selective K(+) channel blocker. Similarly the amount of cellular K(+) is greatly reduced when tubules incubated in normal, i.e. K(+) containing, saline are exposed to Ba(2+). By considering the amounts of cellular K and Rb remaining in the main segments of tubules incubated in either K(+) containing saline or Rb(+) containing saline after Ba(+) treatment, it is suggested that: (a) a major part (56%) of cellular K(+) enters by Ba(2+) sensitive K(+) channels and that Rb(+) can also enter by this route; (b) a smaller fraction (26%) of cellular K(+) enters by a previously proposed Na(+)/K(+)/2Cl(-) co-transporter, which can also transport Rb(+); (c) a previously proposed Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase is responsible for maintaining a K(+) pool (18%) in the tubule cells that is not exchangeable by Rb(+); and (d) entry by this Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase is not available to Rb(+).",M2
19673509,"Charging properties of cassiterite (alpha-SnO(2)) surfaces in NaCl and RbCl ionic media.The acid-base properties of cassiterite (alpha-SnO2) surfaces at 10-50 degrees C were studied using potentiometric titrations of powder suspensions in aqueous NaCl and RbCl media. The proton sorption isotherms exhibited common intersection points in the pH range of 4.0-4.5 under all conditions, and the magnitude of charging was similar but not identical in NaCl and RbCl. The hydrogen bonding configuration at the oxide-water interface, obtained from classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, was analyzed in detail, and the results were explicitly incorporated in calculations of protonation constants for the reactive surface sites using the revised MUSIC model. The calculations indicated that the terminal SnOH2 group is more acidic than the bridging Sn2OH group, with protonation constants (log KH) of 3.60 and 5.13 at 25 degrees C, respectively. This is contrary to the situation on the isostructural alpha-TiO2 (rutile), apparently because of the difference in electronegativity between Ti and Sn. MD simulations and speciation calculations indicated considerable differences in the speciation of Na+ and <e>Rb</e>+, despite the similarities in overall charging. Adsorbed sodium ions are almost exclusively found in bidentate surface complexes, whereas adsorbed rubidium ions form comparable numbers of bidentate and tetradentate complexes. Also, the distribution of adsorbed Na+ between the different complexes shows a considerable dependence on the surface charge density (pH), whereas the distribution of adsorbed Rb+ is almost independent of pH. A surface complexation model (SCM) capable of accurately describing both the measured surface charge and the MD-predicted speciation of adsorbed Na+/Rb+ was formulated. According to the SCM, the deprotonated terminal group (SnOH(-0.40)) and the protonated bridging group (Sn2OH+0.36) dominate the surface speciation over the entire pH range of this study (2.7-10). The complexation of medium cations increases significantly with increasing negative surface charge, and at pH 10, roughly 40% of the terminal sites are predicted to form cation complexes, whereas anion complexation is minor throughout the studied pH range.",M2

19621894,"Quaternary benzyltriethylammonium ion binding to the Na,K-ATPase: a tool to investigate extracellular K+ binding reactions.This study examined how the quaternary organic ammonium ion, benzyltriethylamine (BTEA), binds to the Na,K-ATPase to produce membrane potential (V(M))-dependent inhibition and tested the prediction that such a V(M)-dependent inhibitor would display electrogenic binding kinetics. BTEA competitively inhibited K(+) activation of Na,K-ATPase activity and steady-state (86)<e>Rb</e>(+) occlusion. The initial rate of (86)Rb(+) occlusion was decreased by BTEA to a similar degree whether it was added to the enzyme prior to or simultaneously with Rb(+), a demonstration that BTEA inhibits the Na,K-ATPase without being occluded. Several BTEA structural analogues reversibly inhibited Na,K-pump current, but none blocked current in a V(M)-dependent manner except BTEA and its para-nitro derivative, pNBTEA. Under conditions that promoted electroneutral K(+)-K(+) exchange by the Na,K-ATPase, step changes in V(M) elicited pNBTEA-activated ouabain-sensitive transient currents that had similarities to those produced with the K(+) congener, Tl(+). pNBTEA- and Tl(+)-dependent transient currents both displayed saturation of charge moved at extreme negative and positive V(M), equivalence of charge moved during and after step changes in V(M), and similar apparent valence. The rate constant (k(tot)) for Tl(+)-dependent transient current asymptotically approached a minimum value at positive V(M). In contrast, k(tot) for pNBTEA-dependent transient current was a  U -shaped function of V(M) with a minimum value near 0 mV. Homology models of the Na,K-ATPase alpha subunit suggested that quaternary amines can bind to two extracellularly accessible sites, one of them located at K(+) binding sites positioned between transmembrane helices 4, 5, and 6. Altogether, these data revealed important information about electrogenic ion binding reactions of the Na,K-ATPase that are not directly measurable during ion transport by this enzyme.",M2

19491099,"E2P state stabilization by the N-terminal tail of the H,K-ATPase beta-subunit is critical for efficient proton pumping under in vivo conditions.The catalytic alpha-subunits of Na,K- and H,K-ATPase require an accessory beta-subunit for proper folding, maturation, and plasma membrane delivery but also for cation transport. To investigate the functional significance of the beta-N terminus of the gastric H,K-ATPase in vivo, several N-terminally truncated beta-variants were expressed in Xenopus oocytes, together with the S806C alpha-subunit variant. Upon labeling with the reporter fluorophore tetramethylrho da mine-6-maleimide, this construct can be used to determine the voltage-dependent distribution between E(1)P/E(2)P states. Whereas the E(1)P/E(2)P conformational equilibrium was unaffected for the shorter N-terminal deletions betaDelta4 and betaDelta8, we observed significant shifts toward E(1)P for the two larger deletions betaDelta13 and betaDelta29. Moreover, the reduced DeltaF/F ratios of betaDelta13 and betaDelta29 indicated an increased reverse reaction via E(2)P --&gt; E(1)P + ADP --&gt; E(1) + ATP, because cell surface expression was completely unaffected. This interpretation is supported by the reduced sensitivity of the mutants toward the E(2)P-specific inhibitor SCH28080, which becomes especially apparent at high concentrations (100 microm). Despite unaltered apparent <e>Rb</e>(+) affinities, the maximal Rb(+) uptake of these mutants was also significantly lowered. Considering the two putative interaction sites between the beta-N terminus and alpha-subunit revealed by the recent cryo-EM structure, the N-terminal tail of the H,K-ATPase beta-subunit may stabilize the pump in the E(2)P conformation, thereby increasing the efficiency of proton release against the million-fold proton gradient of the stomach lumen. Finally, we demonstrate that a similar truncation of the beta-N terminus of the closely related Na,K-ATPase does not affect the E(1)P/E(2)P distribution or pump activity, indicating that the E(2)P-stabilizing effect by the beta-N terminus is apparently a unique property of the H,K-ATPase.",M2

19420417,"Optimization of <e>Rb</e>-82 PET acquisition and reconstruction protocols for myocardial perfusion defect detection.The purpose of this study is to optimize the dynamic Rb-82 cardiac PET acquisition and reconstruction protocols for maximum myocardial perfusion defect detection using realistic simulation data and task-based evaluation. Time activity curves (TACs) of different organs under both rest and stress conditions were extracted from dynamic Rb-82 PET images of five normal patients. Combined SimSET-GATE Monte Carlo simulation was used to generate nearly noise-free cardiac PET data from a time series of 3D NCAT phantoms with organ activities modeling different pre-scan delay times (PDTs) and total acquisition times (TATs). Poisson noise was added to the nearly noise-free projections and the OS-EM algorithm was applied to generate noisy reconstructed images. The channelized Hotelling observer (CHO) with 32x32 spatial templates corresponding to four octave-wide frequency channels was used to evaluate the images. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was calculated from the CHO rating data as an index for image quality in terms of myocardial perfusion defect detection. The 0.5 cycle cm(-1) Butterworth post-filtering on OS-EM (with 21 subsets) reconstructed images generates the highest AUC values while those from iteration numbers 1 to 4 do not show different AUC values. The optimized PDTs for both rest and stress conditions are found to be close to the cross points of the left ventricular chamber and myocardium TACs, which may promote an individualized PDT for patient data processing and image reconstruction. Shortening the TATs for &lt;approximately 3 min from the clinically employed acquisition time does not affect the myocardial perfusion defect detection significantly for both rest and stress studies.",M2
19371328,"Effect of K+ and <e>Rb</e>+ on the action of verapamil on a voltage-gated K+ channel, hKv1.3: implications for a second open state?BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Verapamil blocks current through the voltage-gated K(+) channel K(v)1.3 in the open and inactivated state of the channel but not the closed state. The binding site for verapamil was proposed to be close to the selectivity filter and the occupancy of the selectivity filter might therefore influence verapamil affinity. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the influence of intra- and extracellular K(+) and Rb(+) on the effect of verapamil by patch-clamp studies, in COS-7 cells transfected with hK(v)1.3 channels. KEY RESULTS: Verapamil affinity was highest in high intracellular K(+) concentrations ([K(+)](i)) and lowest in low [Rb(+)](i), indicating an influence of intracellular cations on verapamil affinity. Experiments with a mutant channel (H399T), exhibiting a strongly reduced C-type inactivated state, demonstrated that part of this changed verapamil affinity in wild-type channels could be caused by altered C-type inactivation. External K(+) and Rb(+) could influence verapamil affinity by a voltage-dependent entry into the channel thereby modifying the verapamil off-rate and in addition causing a voltage-dependent verapamil off-rate. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Recovery from verapamil block was mainly due to the voltage-dependent closing of channels (state-dependent block), implying a second open state of the channel. This hypothesis was confirmed by the dependency of the tail current time course on duration of the prepulse. We conclude that the wild-type hK(v)1.3 channel undergoes at least two different conformational changes before finally closing with a low verapamil affinity in one open state and a high verapamil affinity in the other open state.",M2
19248525,"[Application of ICP-MS in evaluating element contamination in soils]The Yunfu pyrite was the second biggest pyrite bed in the world. Plants using industrial ore of the Yunfu pyrite are distributed in many sections across the country. In the present paper, elements V, Cr, Co, Cu, Zn, Mo, Cd, Sb, <e>Rb</e> and Cs in soil profiles in slag disposing area of a sulfuric acid plant using industrial ore of theYunfu pyrite were studied. A method for simultaneously determination of metals and some reference elements in soils by ICP-MS was developed. The correlations between the metals and their reference elements were fast found. Enrichment factors were applied for evaluating the degree of soil contamination, and the problem about choosing contamination elements background values was pointed out. The results indicated that element V showed apparent and serious pollution, The Co showed middle degree pollution, and there has been a trend of apparent pollution. The Cr, Mo and Cd showed pollution between light degree and middle degree. The Zn and Sb showed light degree pollution, and there was a latent trend of middle degree pollution. The Cu showed light degree pollution. The high enrichment points of the V and the Cr were observed in the upper part (4.0-10.5 cm) and deep part of soil profiles (44.0-75.5 cm). Those of Co and Mo were found in the surface of soil profiles (0-5.0 cm), middle-upper part (9.5-10.5 cm) and middle part (29.5-46.0 cm), while those of Cd and Cu occurred just in the middle of soil profiles (29.5-46.0 cm). The formation of highly enrichment points of contamination elements in the soil profiles was the result of leaching and accumulating effect of the metals released from slag and the residual metals of highly weathered red soils. Most of pollution of V in the soil was contributed by the V in soil bed. Part of the V pollution in the soil was supplied by leaching and accumulating effect of the V which came from catalyst with lost activity in sulfuric acid production volatilizing into slag.",M2

19201231,"Separation of isotropic chemical and second-order quadrupolar shifts by multiple-quantum double rotation NMR.Using a two-dimensional multiple-quantum (MQ) double rotation (DOR) experiment the contributions of the chemical shift and quadrupolar interaction to isotropic resonance shifts can be completely separated. Spectra were acquired using a three-pulse triple-quantum z-filtered pulse sequence and subsequently sheared along both the nu(1) and nu(2) dimensions. The application of this method is demonstrated for both crystalline (RbNO(3)) and amorphous samples (vitreous B(2)O(3)). The existence of the two rubidium isotopes ((85)<e>Rb</e> and (87)Rb) allows comparison of results for two nuclei with different spins (I=3/2 and 5/2), as well as different dipole and quadrupole moments in a single chemical compound. Being only limited by homogeneous line broadening and sample crystallinity, linewidths of approximately 0.1 and 0.2 ppm can be measured for (87)Rb in the quadrupolar and chemical shift dimensions, enabling highly accurate determination of the isotropic chemical shift and the quadrupolar product, P(Q).

Capillary affinity electrophoresis was employed for the experimental evaluation of the strength of the Val-Rb(+) complex. The study involved the measurement of the change of effective electrophoretic mobility of Val at increasing concentration of Rb(+) cation in the BGE. From the dependence of Val effective electrophoretic mobility on the Rb(+) cation concentration in the BGE (methanolic solution of 100 mM Tris, 50 mM acetic acid, 0-1 mM RbCl), the apparent binding (stability) constant (K(b)) of the Val-Rb(+) complex in methanol was evaluated as log K(b)=4.63+/-0.27.

METHODS: The lipophilic and monocationic (67)Ga-labeled gallium chelates of five novel hexadentate bis(salicylaldimine) ligands the bis(salicylaldimine), bis(3-methoxysalicylaldimine), bis(4-methoxysalicylaldimine), bis(6-meth,oxysalicylaldimine), and bis(4,6-dimethoxysalicylaldimine) of N,N'-bis(3-aminopropyl)-N,N'-dimethylethylenediamine (BAPDMEN), were prepared. The structure of the unlabeled [Ga(4-MeOsal)(2)BAPDMEN](+)PF(6)(-) salt was determined by X-ray crystallography, and the biodistribution of each of the (67)Ga-labeled gallium chelates was determined in rats following intravenous administration and compared with the biodistribution of [(86)<e>Rb</e>]rubidium chloride. RESULTS: The [Ga(4-MeOsal)(2)BAPDMEN](+)PF(6)(-) complex exhibited the expected pseudo-octahedral N(4)O(2)(2-) coordination sphere about the Ga(3+) center with a trans disposition of the phenolate oxygen atoms. All five (67)Ga radiopharmaceuticals were found to afford the desired myocardial retention of the radiogallium. The [(67/68)Ga][Ga(3-MeOsal)(2)BAPDMEN](1+) radiopharmaceutical appears to have the best properties for myocardial imaging, exhibiting 2% of the injected dose in the heart 1 min and 2 h postinjection and very high heart/nontarget ratios (heart/blood ratios of 7.6+/-1.0 and 54+/-10 at 1 and 120 min, respectively; heart/liver ratios of 1.8+/-0.4 and 39+/-3 at 1 and 120 min, respectively).

19098917,"High-resolution structure of the open NaK channel.We report the crystal structure of the nonselective cation channel NaK from Bacillus cereus at a resolution of 1.6 A. The structure reveals the intracellular gate in an open state, as opposed to the closed form reported previously, making NaK the only channel for which the three-dimensional structures of both conformations are known. Channel opening follows a conserved mechanism of inner helix bending using a flexible glycine residue, the gating hinge, seen in MthK and most other tetrameric cation channels. Additionally, distinct inter and intrasubunit rearrangements involved in channel gating are seen and characterized for the first time along with inner helix twisting motions. Furthermore, we identify a residue deeper within the cavity of the channel pore, Phe92, which is likely to form a constriction point within the open pore, restricting ion flux through the channel. Mutating this residue to alanine causes a subsequent increase in ion-conduction rates as measured by (86)<e>Rb</e> flux assays. The structures of both the open and closed conformations of the NaK channel correlate well with those of equivalent K(+) channel conformations, namely MthK and KcsA, respectively.",M2
19098915,"Structural analysis of ion selectivity in the NaK channel.Here we present a detailed characterization of ion binding in the NaK pore using the high-resolution structures of NaK in complex with various cations. These structures reveal four ion binding sites with similar chemical environments but vastly different ion preference. The most nonselective of all is site 3, which is formed exclusively by backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms and resides deep within the selectivity filter. Additionally, four water molecules in combination with four backbone carbonyl oxygen atoms are seen to participate in K(+) and <e>Rb</e>(+) ion chelation, at both the external entrance and the vestibule of the NaK filter, confirming the channel's preference for an octahedral ligand configuration for K(+) and Rb(+) binding. In contrast, Na(+) binding in the NaK filter, particularly at site 4, utilizes a pyramidal ligand configuration that requires the participation of a water molecule in the cavity. Therefore, the ability of the NaK filter to bind both Na(+) and K(+) ions seemingly arises from the ions' ability to use the existing environment in unique ways, rather than from any structural rearrangements of the filter itself.",M2

19000196,"Relative contribution of AtHAK5 and AtAKT1 to K+ uptake in the high-affinity range of concentrations.The relative contribution of the high-affinity K(+) transporter AtHAK5 and the inward rectifier K(+) channel AtAKT1 to K(+) uptake in the high-affinity range of concentrations was studied in Arabidopsis thaliana ecotype Columbia (Col-0). The results obtained with wild-type lines, with T-DNA insertion in both genes and specific uptake inhibitors, show that AtHAK5 and AtAKT1 mediate the NH4+-sensitive and the Ba(2+)-sensitive components of uptake, respectively, and that they are the two major contributors to uptake in the high-affinity range of <e>Rb</e>(+) concentrations. Using Rb(+) as a K(+) analogue, it was shown that AtHAK5 mediates absorption at lower Rb(+) concentrations than AtAKT1 and depletes external Rb(+) to values around 1 muM. Factors such as the presence of K(+) or NH4+ during plant growth determine the relative contribution of each system. The presence of NH4+ in the growth solution inhibits the induction of AtHAK5 by K(+) starvation. In K(+)-starved plants grown without NH4+, both systems are operative, but when NH4+ is present in the growth solution, AtAKT1 is probably the only system mediating Rb(+) absorption, and the capacity of the roots to deplete Rb(+) is reduced.",M2

18991593,"hERG (KCNH2 or Kv11.1) K+ channels: screening for cardiac arrhythmia risk.Testing new compounds for pro-arrhythmic potential has focused in recent years on avoiding activity at the hERG K+ channel, as hERG block is a common feature of many pro-arrhythmic compounds associated with Torsades de Pointes in humans. Blockers of hERG are well known to prolong cardiac action potentials and lead to long QT syndrome, and activators, although rarer, can lead to short QT syndrome. The most reliable assays of hERG utilize stable cell lines, and include ligand binding, <e>Rb</e>+ flux and electrophysiology (both automated and manual). These assays can be followed by measurement of activity at other ion channels contributing to cardiac contractility and detailed action potential/repolarization measurements in cardiac tissue.

18842165,"Asymmetry of <e>Rb</e>+ conduction emerged under bi-ionic conditions in epithelial maxi-K+ channels.K(+) channels permit more than one ion within their conducting pathway at any given moment and show a saturating single-file behavior. The conduction of Rb(+) shows an unusual behavior, a so-called  Rb(+) anomaly,  and it has been used to probe the mechanism of the ion conduction through K(+)-selective channels. Under the bi-ionic condition of K(+) and Rb(+), we carried out patch-clamp single-channel current measurements in MaxiK(+) channels from mouse submandibular acinar cells. Keeping only K(+) on one side of the membrane while varying fractional Rb(+) concentration on the opposite, we had a series of current-voltage relationships. It showed a characteristic inflection at which the ion conductance was divided into two components, one ascribed to pure K(+) conduction and the other to K(+) and Rb(+) bi-ionic conduction. By analyzing the latter, we depicted that (1) the bi-ionic conductance showed a characteristic reduction curve as the Rb(+) fractional concentration increased; (2) Rb(+) can bind the channel more tightly when it accesses from the outside than from the inside. Thus we conclude that such asymmetry of the Rb(+) binding determines the pattern of bi-ionic conductance reduction in K-selective channels.",M2

Treatment with 0.2 microM STS for 5 hours led to mild apoptosis with 10-13 % cell dehydration and either moderate increase of channel mediated Rb(+) influx without significant changes in the pump activity or moderate decrease of pump Rb(+) influx without significant change of channel influx, depending on the cell line used. Treatment with 1 microM STS was followed by 18-23 % cell dehydration, a decrease of the pump activity and a small or insignificant increase in the OR Rb(+) influx in all studied sublines. It is concluded that moderate apoptotic cell shrinkage may be associated with both an increase in K(+) channel permeability and inhibition of the pump whereas more remarkable shrinkage occurs presumably due to inhibition of the pump.",M2

18669634,"Identification and function of a cytoplasmic K+ site of the Na+, K+ -ATPase.A cytoplasmic nontransport K(+)/<e>Rb</e>(+) site in the P-domain of the Na(+), K(+)-ATPase has been identified by anomalous difference Fourier map analysis of crystals of the [Rb(2)].E(2).MgF(4)(2-) form of the enzyme. The functional roles of this third K(+)/Rb(+) binding site were studied by site-directed mutagenesis, replacing the side chain of Asp(742) donating oxygen ligand(s) to the site with alanine, glutamate, and lysine. Unlike the wild-type Na(+), K(+)-ATPase, the mutants display a biphasic K(+) concentration dependence of E(2)P dephosphorylation, indicating that the cytoplasmic K(+) site is involved in activation of dephosphorylation. The affinity of the site is lowered significantly (30-200-fold) by the mutations, the lysine mutation being most disruptive. Moreover, the mutations accelerate the E(2) to E(1) conformational transition, again with the lysine substitution resulting in the largest effect. Hence, occupation of the cytoplasmic K(+)/Rb(+) site not only enhances E(2)P dephosphorylation but also stabilizes the E(2) dephosphoenzyme. These characteristics of the previously unrecognized nontransport site make it possible to account for the hitherto poorly understood trans-effects of cytoplasmic K(+) by the consecutive transport model, without implicating a simultaneous exposure of the transport sites toward the cytoplasmic and extracellular sides of the membrane. The cytoplasmic K(+)/Rb(+) site appears to be conserved among Na(+), K(+)-ATPases and P-type ATPases in general, and its mode of operation may be associated with stabilizing the loop structure at the C-terminal end of the P6 helix of the P-domain, thereby affecting the function of highly conserved catalytic residues and promoting helix-helix interactions between the P- and A-domains in the E(2) state.",M2
18569003,"Elements in rice on the Swedish market: part 2. Chromium, copper, iron, manganese, platinum, rubidium, selenium and zinc.A survey of the levels of some essential and non-essential trace elements in different types of rice available on the Swedish retail market was carried out in 2001-03. The types of rice included long and short grain, brown, white, and parboiled white. The mean levels found were: chromium (Cr) = 0.008 mg kg(-1), copper (Cu) = 1.9 mg kg(-1), iron (Fe) = 4.7 mg kg(-1), manganese (Mn) = 16 mg kg(-1), platinum (Pt) &lt; 0.0003 mg kg(-1), rubidium (<e>Rb</e>) = 3.3 mg kg(-1), selenium (Se) =0.1 mg kg(-1); and zinc (Zn) = 15 mg kg(-1). Inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) was used for the determination of Pt, Rb, and Se, after acid digestion. All other elements were determined using atomic absorption spectrometry (AAS) after dry ashing. Intake calculations were performed and it was concluded that rice may contribute considerably to the daily requirements of the essential elements Cu, Fe, Mn, Se, and Zn if rice consumption is high. The levels of some elements, e.g. Fe and Mn, were significantly higher in brown compared with white rice.",M2
18567833,"Imaging nutrient distributions in plant tissue using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry and scanning electron microscopy.A new approach to trace the transport routes of macronutrients in plants at the level of cells and tissues and to measure their elemental distributions was developed for investigating the dynamics and structure-function relationships of transport processes. Stem samples from Phaseolus vulgaris were used as a test system. Shock freezing and cryo-preparation were combined in a cryogenic chain with cryo-time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (cryo-ToF-SIMS) for element and isotope-specific imaging. Cryo-scanning electron microscopy (cryo-SEM) was integrated into the cryogenic workflow to assess the quality of structural preservation. We evaluated the capability of these techniques to monitor transport pathways and processes in xylem and associated tissues using supplementary sodium (Na) and tracers for potassium (K), rubidium (<e>Rb</e>), and (41)K added to the transpiration stream. Cryo-ToF-SIMS imaging produced detailed mappings of water, K, calcium, magnesium, the K tracers, and Na without quantification. Lateral resolutions ranged from 10 microm in survey mappings and at high mass resolution to approximately 1 microm in high lateral resolution imaging in reduced areas and at lower mass resolution. The tracers Rb and (41)K, as well as Na, were imaged with high sensitivity in xylem vessels and surrounding tissues. The isotope signature of the stable isotope tracer was utilized for relative quantification of the (41)K tracer as a fraction of total K at the single pixel level. Cryo-SEM confirmed that tissue structures had been preserved with subcellular detail throughout all procedures. Overlays of cryo-ToF-SIMS images onto the corresponding SEM images allowed detailed correlation of nutrient images with subcellular structures.",M2

Using a single-loop wire and a magnetic bias field, the two clouds, each containing more than 1 x 10(6) atoms, are spatially separated above and below the wire center of the double-well MOT. The cloud interdistance can be controlled by independently varying the wire current and external bias field. This allows to load the double-well magnetic trap, and to study the dynamics of cold collisions between two-species atoms.",M2
18542210,"Optical recording in <e>Rb</e> loaded-porous glass by reversible photoinduced phase transformations.We report reversible phase transformations in Rb loaded-porous glass irradiated with weak laser light which allow us to realize image storage on it. The effect is due to photo-induced changes of Rb distribution inside the glass pores, where atomic photodetachment and confinement produce either formation or evaporation of Rb nanoclusters. These processes depend on light frequency and intensity making controllable by light the porous glass transparency. We demonstrate that porous glass doped with Rb can be used as a support to record a light pulse for a long time as well as to remember the order of light colors in an illumination sequence.",M2

The chemical shifts of (19)F, (23)Na and (139)La in solid and in liquid have been compared for AF (A = alkali) and LaF(3). In pure molten alkali fluorides, the polarisability of anion-cation pairs appears to be a key parameter to depict the observed evolution of (19)F chemical shifts. The influence of the composition has also been studied by measuring the chemical shifts in molten LaF(3)-AF as a function of LaF(3) concentration. A strong influence of the alkali influence is observed. The coordination number of lanthanum is decreased versus AF amount all the more since the alkali atomic number is high. Moreover, the more polarisable the alkali, the less bridging fluorines between the LaF(x) units.",M2
18465842,"The pathway for spontaneous occlusion of <e>Rb</e>+ in the Na+/K+-ATPase.Occlusion of K (+) in the Na (+)/K (+)-ATPase can be achieved under two conditions: during hydrolysis of ATP, in media with Na (+) and Mg (2+), after the K (+)-stimulated dephosphorylation of E2P (physiological route) or spontaneously, after binding of K (+) to the enzyme (direct route). We investigated the sidedness of spontaneous occlusion and deocclusion of Rb (+) in an unsided, purified preparation of Na (+)/K (+)-ATPase. Our studies were based on two propositions: (i) in the absence of ATP, deocclusion of K (+) and its congeners is a sequential process where two ions are released according to a single file mechanism, both in the absence and in the presence of Mg (2+) plus inorganic orthophosphate (Pi), and (ii) in the presence of Mg (2+) plus Pi, exchange of K (+) would take place through sites exposed to the extracellular surface of the membrane. The experiments included a double incubation sequence where one of the two Rb (+) ions was labeled as (86)Rb (+). We found that, when the enzyme is in the E2 conformation, the first Rb (+) that entered the enzyme in media without Mg (2+) and Pi was the last to leave after addition of Mg (2+) plus Pi, and vice-versa. This indicates that spontaneous exchange of Rb (+) between E2(Rb 2) and the medium takes place when the transport sites are exposed to the extracellular surface of the membrane. Our results open the question if occlusion and deocclusion via the direct route participates in any significant degree in the transport of K (+) during the ATPase activity.",M2
18434537,"Critical role of a K+ channel in Plasmodium berghei transmission revealed by targeted gene disruption.Regulated K(+) transport across the plasma membrane is of vital importance for the survival of most cells. Two K(+) channels have been identified in the Plasmodium falciparum genome; however, their functional significance during parasite life cycle in the vertebrate host and during transmission through the mosquito vector remains unknown. We hypothesize that these two K(+) channels mediate the transport of K(+) in the parasites, and thus are important for parasite survival. To test this hypothesis, we identified the orthologue of one of the P. falciparum K(+) channels, PfKch1, in the rodent malaria parasite P. berghei (PbKch1) and examined the biological role by performing a targeted disruption of the gene encoding PbKch1. The deduced amino acid sequence of the six transmembrane domains of PfKch1 and PbKch1 share 82% identity, and in particular the pore regions are completely identical. The PbKch1-null parasites were viable despite a marked reduction in the uptake of the K(+) congener (86)<e>Rb</e>(+), and mice infected with PbKch1-null parasites survived slightly longer than mice infected with WT parasites. However, the most striking feature of the phenotype was the virtually complete inhibition of the development of PbKch1-null parasites in Anopheles stephensi mosquitoes. In conclusion, these studies demonstrate that PbKch1 contributes to the transport of K(+) in P. berghei parasites and supports the growth of the parasites, in particular the development of oocysts in the mosquito midgut. K(+) channels therefore may constitute a potential antimalarial drug target.",M2
18342998,"A study of mechanisms responsible for incorporation of cesium and radiocesium into fruitbodies of king oyster mushroom (Pleurotus eryngii).Ex vitro cultures of Pleurotus eryngii were carried out under controlled conditions using sterile medium composed of barley seeds. The influence of alkali and alkaline earth element salts (CsCl, KCl, NaCl, RbCl, and CaCl(2)) and tetraethylammonium chloride on incorporation of cesium, potassium, sodium, rubidium and calcium, and their distribution within fruitbodies, was examined. The results show that incorporation of cesium into fruitbodies was not suppressed by Na(+) and <e>Rb</e>(+) or tetraethylammonium chloride. However, it was inhibited by Ca(2+) and stimulated by high concentrations of K(+). The inhibition of cesium incorporation by Ca(2+), lack of influence of tetraethylammonium chloride and stimulation by high K(+) concentrations suggest that there may exist two pathways of passive transport of cesium in mycelium: (i) uptake mediated by a non-specific potassium channel localised in plasmalemma (similar to voltage-insensitive cation channel, VICC) followed by diffusive transport inside hyphae and (ii) extracellular transport from the medium through inter-hyphal cavities into fruitbodies. The results highlight distinctiveness of mechanisms responsible for the uptake and incorporation of cesium in mushrooms and plants.",M2
18191875,"CSF Mg and Ca as diagnostic markers for dementia with Lewy bodies.Accumulating evidence implicates a role for altered metal homeostasis in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). However, few investigations have addressed this issue in dementia with Lewy bodies (DLB). The aim of the present study was to investigate metal concentrations in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from patients with DLB and other neurodegenerative disorders. To that end, CSF and plasma samples were collected from 29 patients with DLB, 174 patients with AD, 90 patients with AD with minor vascular components, and 51 healthy volunteers. Total concentrations of Mg, Ca, Mn, Fe, Cu, Zn, <e>Rb</e>, Sr, and Cs were determined using mass spectrometry. Patients with DLB had elevated Ca and Mg levels in CSF and Mg levels in plasma as compared to all other groups (p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, a combination of CSF-Mg and CSF-Ca could distinguish DLB from AD with a sensitivity of 93% and a specificity of 85%. Cu levels in both CSF and plasma tended to be higher in DLB compared to the other groups, but these trends failed to reach significance after correction for multiple comparisons. Mn, Fe, Zn, Rb, and Sr concentration in CSF or plasma were similar in all groups. The observed elevations of CSF-Mg, CSF-Ca and CSF-Cu may contribute to or be associated with the neurodegenerative process in DLB. Furthermore, determination of CSF-Mg and CSF-Ca concentration may be a valuable tool in distinguishing DLB from AD.",M2
18184876,"Apparent intermediate K conductance channel hyposmotic activation in human lens epithelial cells.This study explores the nature of K fluxes in human lens epithelial cells (LECs) in hyposmotic solutions. Total ion fluxes, Na-K pump, Cl-dependent Na-K-2Cl (NKCC), K-Cl (KCC) cotransport, and K channels were determined by 85Rb uptake and cell K (Kc) by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and cell water gravimetrically after exposure to ouabain +/- bumetanide (Na-K pump and NKCC inhibitors), and ion channel inhibitors in varying osmolalities with Na, K, or methyl-d-glucamine and Cl, sulfamate, or nitrate. Reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), Western blot analyses, and immunochemistry were also performed. In isosmotic (300 mosM) media approximately 90% of the total <e>Rb</e> influx occurred through the Na-K pump and NKCC and approximately 10% through KCC and a residual leak. Hyposmotic media (150 mosM) decreased K(c) by a 16-fold higher K permeability and cell water, but failed to inactivate NKCC and activate KCC. Sucrose replacement or extracellular K to &gt;57 mM, but not Rb or Cs, in hyposmotic media prevented Kc and water loss. Rb influx equaled Kc loss, both blocked by clotrimazole (IC50 approximately 25 microM) and partially by 1-[(2-chlorophenyl) diphenylmethyl]-1H-pyrazole (TRAM-34) inhibitors of the IK channel KCa3.1 but not by other K channel or connexin hemichannel blockers. Of several anion channel blockers (dihydro-indenyl)oxy]alkanoic acid (DIOA), 4-2(butyl-6,7-dichloro-2-cyclopentylindan-1-on-5-yl)oxybutyric acid (DCPIB), and phloretin totally or partially inhibited Kc loss and Rb influx, respectively. RT-PCR and immunochemistry confirmed the presence of KCa3.1 channels, aside of the KCC1, KCC2, KCC3 and KCC4 isoforms. Apparently, IK channels, possibly in parallel with volume-sensitive outwardly rectifying Cl channels, effect regulatory volume decrease in LECs.",M2
18067357,"Fluorescence-detected two-dimensional electronic coherence spectroscopy by acousto-optic phase modulation.Two-dimensional electronic coherence spectroscopy (ECS) is an important method to study the coupling between distinct optical modes of a material system. Such studies often involve excitation using a sequence of phased ultrashort laser pulses. In conventional approaches, the delays between pulse temporal envelopes must be precisely monitored or maintained. Here, we introduce a new experimental scheme for phase-selective nonlinear ECS, which combines acousto-optic phase modulation with ultrashort laser excitation to produce intensity modulated nonlinear fluorescence signals. We isolate specific nonlinear signal contributions by synchronous detection, with respect to appropriately constructed references. Our method effectively decouples the relative temporal phases from the pulse envelopes of a collinear train of four sequential pulses. We thus achieve a robust and high signal-to-noise scheme for phase-selective ECS to investigate the resonant nonlinear optical response of photoluminescent systems. We demonstrate the validity of our method using a model quantum three-level system-atomic <e>Rb</e> vapor. Moreover, we show how our measurements determine the resonant complex-valued third-order susceptibility.",M2

17768246,"Cloning and characterization of two K+ transporters of Debaryomyces hansenii.Two genes from the halotolerant yeast Debaryomyces hansenii were cloned, DhTRK1 and DhHAK1. These genes encode K(+) transporters with sequence similarities to the TRK and HAK transporters from Debaryomyces occidentalis and Candida albicans. The DhHAK1p transporter was only expressed in K(+)-starved cells, as shown by Northern blot analysis. Both DhTRK1p and DhHAK1p were expressed in a trk1Delta trk2Delta mutant of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, unable to grow at low K(+). This expression resulted in partial recovery of growth and ability to retain K(+) at low concentrations. In liquid media, 0.5 M NaCl affected growth of these S. cerevisiae transformants as it does in D. hansenii, resulting in a much less deleterious effect than in wild-type S. cerevisiae. Kinetics of <e>Rb</e>(+) uptake in the transformants suggest that DhTRK1p and DhHAK1p code for moderate-affinity K(+) transporters exhibiting a sigmoid response against Rb(+) concentration and presenting a deviation from classic Michaelis-Menten kinetics at low substrate concentrations. Rb(+) uptake by the DhTRK1p transporter was stimulated by millimolar concentrations of Na(+) at pH 4.5. The good performance of DhTRK1p in the presence of NaCl may be a key feature in the halotolerance of D. hansenii.",M2
17761513,"Canine erythrocytes express the P2X7 receptor: greatly increased function compared with human erythrocytes.Over three decades ago, Parker and Snow (Am J Physiol 223: 888-893, 1972) demonstrated that canine erythrocytes undergo an increase in cation permeability when incubated with extracellular ATP. In this study we examined the expression and function of the channel/pore-forming P2X(7) receptor on canine erythrocytes. P2X(7) receptors were detected on canine erythrocytes by immunocytochemistry and immunoblotting. Extracellular ATP induced (86)<e>Rb</e>(+) (K(+)) efflux from canine erythrocytes that was 20 times greater than that from human erythrocytes. The P2X(7) agonist 2'(3')-O-(4-benzoylbenzoyl)adenosine 5'-trisphosphate (BzATP) was more potent than ATP, and both stimulated (86)Rb(+) efflux from erythrocytes in a dose-dependent fashion with EC(50) values of approximately 7 and approximately 309 microM, respectively. 2-Methylthioadenosine 5'-triphosphate and adenosine 5'-O-(3-thiotriphosphate) induced a smaller (86)Rb(+) efflux from erythrocytes, whereas ADP, AMP, UTP, or adenosine had no effect. ATP-induced (86)Rb(+) efflux from erythrocytes was inhibited by oxidized ATP, KN-62, and Brilliant blue G, known P2X(7) antagonists. ATP also induced uptake of choline(+) into canine erythrocytes that was 60 times greater than that into human erythrocytes. Overnight incubation of canine erythrocytes with ATP and BzATP induced phosphatidylserine exposure in &gt;80% of cells and caused up to 20% hemolysis. In contrast, &lt;30% of human erythrocytes showed phosphatidylserine exposure after overnight incubation with ATP and BzATP, and hemolysis was negligible. Flow cytometric measurements of ATP-induced ethidium(+) uptake showed that P2X(7) function was three times lower in canine monocytes than in human monocytes. These data show that the massive cation permeability increase induced by extracellular ATP in canine erythrocytes results from activation and opening of the P2X(7) receptor channel/pore.",M2
17688580,"Signalling mechanisms in the regulation of vacuolar ion release in guard cells.Pharmacological agents were used to investigate the possible involvement of actin in signalling chains associated with abscisic acid (ABA)-induced ion release from the guard cell vacuole, a process which is absolutely essential for stomatal closure. Effects on the ABA-induced transient stimulation of tonoplast efflux were measured, using (86)<e>Rb</e> in isolated guard cells of Commelina communis, together with effects on stomatal apertures. In the response to 10 microm ABA (triggered by Ca(2+) influx rather than internal Ca(2+) release), jasplakinolide (stabilizing actin filaments) and latrunculin B (depolymerizing actin filaments) had opposite effects. Both closure and the vacuolar efflux transient were inhibited by jasplakinolide but enhanced by latrunculin B. At 10 microm ABA prevention of mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase activation by PD98059 partially inhibited closure and reduced the efflux transient. By contrast, latrunculin B inhibited the efflux transient at 0.1 microm ABA (involving internal Ca(2+) release rather than Ca(2+) influx). The results suggest that 10 microm ABA activates Ca(2+)-dependent vacuolar ion efflux via a Ca(2+)-permeable influx channel which is maintained closed by interaction with F-actin. A MAP kinase is also involved, in a chain similar to that postulated for Ca(2+)-dependent gene expression in cold acclimation.",M2
17638537,"A cell-based <e>Rb</e>(+)-flux assay of the Kv1.3 potassium channel.The Kv1.3 channels expressed by human T lymphocytes are emerging as important therapeutic targets. Peptides like agitoxin and margatoxin in scorpion venom and some non-peptide small molecules are known to inhibit this channel. Since such blockers cannot be used as drugs, pharma has a need to discover effective blockers. The major limiting factor for such development has been the lack of a reliable high-throughput screening (HTS) technology. A cell-based HTS assay for this target was developed in 96-well format to facilitate screening of many candidates. The assay incorporates rubidium ion as a tracer for potassium ion, which can be analyzed by the atomic absorption spectroscopy. The assay provided a Z' factor of 0.813 with more than a 4.5-fold window of detection. The two known blockers agitoxin and margatoxin gave a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC(50)) of 1.52 and 2 nM, respectively. These values are about five- and 2.8-fold higher than their IC(50) values obtained from patch clamp. Some non-peptide compounds like tamoxifen, nifedipine, and fluoxetine also inhibited the efflux through these channels, whereas astemizole and pimozide (potent human ether-a-go-go-related gene blockers) did not block Kv1.3 activity.",M2
17595522,"Characterization of glial cell K-Cl cotransport.BACKGROUND: The molecular mechanism of K-Cl cotransport (KCC) consists of at least 4 isoforms, KCC 1, 2, 3, and 4 which, in multiple combinations, exist in most cells, including erythrocytes and neuronal cells. METHODS: We utilized reverse-transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ion flux studies to characterize KCC activity in an immortalized in vitro cell model for fibrous astrocytes, the rat C6 glioblastoma cell. Isoform-specific sets of oligonucleotide primers were synthesized for NKCC1, KCC1, KCC2, KCC3, KCC4, and also for NKCC1 and actin. K-Cl cotransport activity was determined by measuring either the furosemide-sensitive, or the Cl(-)-dependent bumetanide-insensitive <e>Rb</e>(+) (a K(+) congener) influx in the presence of the Na/K pump inhibitor ouabain. Rb(+) influx was measured at a fixed external Cl concentrations, [Cl(-)](e), as a function of varying external Rb concentrations, [Rb(+)](e), and at a fixed [Rb(+)](e) as a function of varying [Cl(-)](e), and with equimolar Cl replacement by anions of the chaotropic series. RESULTS: RT-PCR of C6 glioblastoma (C6) cells identified mRNA for three KCC isoforms (1, 3, and 4). NKCC1 mRNA was also detected. The apparent K(m) for KCC-mediated Rb(+) influx was 15 mM [Rb(+)](e), and V(max) 12.5 nmol Rb(+) * mg protein(-1) * minute(-1). The calculated apparent K(m) for external Cl(-) was 13 mM and V(max) 14.4 nmol Rb(+) * mg protein(-1) * minute(-1). The anion selectivity sequence of the furosemide-sensitive Rb(+) influx was Cl(-)&gt;&gt;Br-=NO(3)(-)&gt;I(-)=SCN(-)&gt;&gt;Sfm(-) (sulfamate). Established activators of K-Cl cotransport, hyposmotic shock and N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) pretreatment, stimulated furosemide-sensitive Rb(+) influx. A ñ50% NEM-induced loss of intracellular K(+) was prevented by furosemide. CONCLUSION: We have identified by RT-PCR the presence of three distinct KCC isoforms (1, 3, and 4) in rat C6 glioblastoma cells, and functionally characterized the anion selectivity and kinetics of their collective sodium-independent cation-chloride cotransport activity.",M2

Anopheles gambiae larvae survived to adulthood at concentrations as high as 1000 p.p.m. Rb but suffered pupal mortality and reduced adult longevity at high concentrations. We were able to culture An. stephensi at Rb concentrations as high as 300 p.p.m. The presence of Rb in adults was evaluated using a portable XRF analyser, and we were able to reliably detect Rb above background levels in 10-day-old females and 4-day-old males at concentrations causing minimal pupal or adult mortality. We observed that Rb marking was not permanent, and the concentration declined significantly as adults aged.

17541788,"The selectivity, voltage-dependence and acid sensitivity of the tandem pore potassium channel TASK-1: contributions of the pore domains.We have investigated the contribution to ionic selectivity of residues in the selectivity filter and pore helices of the P1 and P2 domains in the acid sensitive potassium channel TASK-1. We used site directed mutagenesis and electrophysiological studies, assisted by structural models built through computational methods. We have measured selectivity in channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using voltage clamp to measure shifts in reversal potential and current amplitudes when <e>Rb</e>+ or Na+ replaced extracellular K+. Both P1 and P2 contribute to selectivity, and most mutations, including mutation of residues in the triplets GYG and GFG in P1 and P2, made channels non-selective. We interpret the effects of these--and of other mutations--in terms of the way the pore is likely to be stabilised structurally. We show also that residues in the outer pore mouth contribute to selectivity in TASK-1. Mutations resulting in loss of selectivity (e.g. I94S, G95A) were associated with slowing of the response of channels to depolarisation. More important physiologically, pH sensitivity is also lost or altered by such mutations. Mutations that retained selectivity (e.g. I94L, I94V) also retained their response to acidification. It is likely that responses both to voltage and pH changes involve gating at the selectivity filter.",M2

While 95-100% cells were viable in callus cultures grown without RbCl, viability was 75% in 50 mM RbCl selected cultures. Growth of RbCl selected calli in presence of salt was comparable to that of callus grown without it. Cells tolerant to RbCl showed more vacuoles and accumulated more K(+) in comparison with their corresponding controls. Suspension cultures were established and uptake of (86)<e>Rb</e>(+) was measured at 10 and 20 min intervals, which revealed a linear relationship between the absorption of K(+) and time. Callus cultures (560-day-old) tolerant to 50 mM RbCl regenerated shoots with 35-40% frequencies in both the varieties, but the same age-old callus grown in the medium devoid of RbCl did not show any organogenesis. Callus cultures that are tolerant to 50 mM RbCl when exposed to 25 mM LiCl, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM KCl and 25 mM CsCl also exhibited cross tolerance in both the varieties. This is the first time that a callus line of rice resistant to RbCl was raised and shown to accumulate a major cation K(+ )and also an increased influx of it.",M2
17444807,"Susceptibility of the ocular lens to nitric oxide: implications in cataractogenesis.Oxides of nitrogen, such as nitric oxide (NO), are now biologically referred to as reactive nitrogen species. The generation of NO gives rise to several other reactive species, such as NO+, NO-, NO2, N2O3, and ONOO- and so forth, which are all capable of inflicting tissue damage. Indeed, NO generation is known to be associated with retinal degeneration and glaucoma. Its level has also been found to increase in the aqueous and vitreous humors in diabetes. We hypothesize that such an increase would have a detrimental effect on the biochemistry and metabolism of tissues, including the lens, bathed by the aqueous containing elevated levels of NO. The primary aim of our investigations was, therefore, to examine the susceptibility of the lens to damage by NO in vitro in the presence of nitroaspirin, a novel NO donating agent. The extent of physiologic damage to the lens was initially assessed by determining the integrity of its active transport mechanism. The overall status of tissue metabolism was determined by measuring the adenosine triphosphate (ATP) levels. The levels of glutathione (GSH) and glutathione disulfide, reflecting the status of its antioxidant reserve, were also determined. That NO is indeed deleterious to the lens was apparent by the inhibition of the active transport of <e>Rb</e>(+). This was associated with a substantial decrease in the contents of ATP and GSH, the decrease in the latter directly suggesting that the NO effects are caused by oxidative stress. That the effects are caused by NO generated from nitroaspirin was proven by a substantial increase in NO level in the medium during incubation of the lenses with nitroaspirin, as compared to the controls. The results, therefore, were highly suggestive of a contribution of the oxides of nitrogen in cataract formation associated with diabetes and other aging diseases.",M2
17403653,"Can fog contribute to the nutrition of Chamaecyparis obtusa var. formosana? Uptake of a fog solute tracer into foliage and transport to roots.Yellow cypress (Chamaecyparis obtusa (Siebold &amp; Zucc.) Endl. var. formosana (Hayata) Rehder) is the predominant tree species of Taiwan's nutrient-poor, mountain fog forests. Little is known about the potential contribution of solute uptake from fog to the overall nutrition of these trees. Shoots of yellow cypress seedlings were misted with artificial fog containing the tracer rubidium (<e>Rb</e>) in laboratory and field experiments to determine if there is solute uptake from the fog. After misting shoots for six weeks, substantial amounts of tracer were detected in unexposed roots by inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy bulk analysis. Possible routes of entry were examined by element imaging with energy dispersive X-ray analysis. Direct uptake of the tracer into leaves across the cuticle and epidermis was small, excluding this as the major uptake path. Accumulations of Rb were found on leaf surfaces along the edges of the leaves. The almost daily changes in fog coverage and air humidity may enhance the accumulation of fog solutes at leaf edges. Accumulation of Rb was also found in narrow clefts between opposite leaves and between the outermost and underlying alternating stacked leaves. The clefts provide a direct passage from the leaf surface to the space beneath the imbricate leaves and the underlying alternate leaves, possibly facilitating solute uptake from fog, which in turn may contribute to the nutrition of yellow cypress.",M2
17399731,"Large volume injection in ion chromatography Separation of rubidium and strontium for on-line inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry determination of strontium isotope ratios.Large volume injection, up to 5 mL, was evaluated and optimised for the on-line ion chromatographic separation of <e>Rb</e> and Sr before ICP-MS measurement of Sr isotope ratios. Flat-topped chromatographic peaks, ideally suited for multicollector ICP-MS isotope ratio measurements, could be obtained when the composition of the mobile phase (nitric acid and 18-crown-6 ether) was identical to the matrix of the sample. Under those conditions rubidium eluted at the dead volume of the column while strontium produced a flat-topped transient signal with several minutes of stable plateau. On-line data acquisition during several minutes at the plateau of Sr signal allowed high precision Sr isotope ratio measurement. The developed procedure was evaluated for Sr isotope ratio measurements on different types of samples, including cider, apples, apple leaves, and soil extracts, in the frame of a long-term project aiming at origin authentication using strontium isotope ratio measurements. It was observed that sample matrix caused broadening of the strontium chromatographic peak and loss of flat-topped peak profile. Under those circumstances the addition of the complexing crown-ether 18-crown-6 both to samples and chromatographic eluent provided two distinct advantages. First, a drastic increase in the retention of strontium was observed which could be modulated by increasing the concentration of nitric acid in the eluent up to 900 mM. This increase in the eluent HNO(3) concentration allowed the application of the method to acid soil digests and other high acidity samples. Second, the matrix of the sample did not affect any more the chromatographic peak profile and similar chromatographic separations could be obtained for samples and standards maintaining the flat-topped Sr peak profile. Sample preparation consisted of a simple 1:10 dilution of the cider or pre-treated solid samples by adding HNO(3) (900 mM) and 18-crown-6 ether (5mM) to obtain similar composition in the sample solution and the HPLC eluent.",M2
17337217,"Analysis of the monovalent ion fluxes in U937 cells under the balanced ion distribution: recognition of ion transporters responsible for changes in cell ion and water balance during apoptosis.Unidirectional (22)Na, Li(+) and <e>Rb</e>(+) fluxes and net fluxes of Na(+) and K(+) were measured in U937 human leukemic cells before and after induction of apoptosis by staurosporine (1 microM, 4 h) to answer the question which ion transporter(s) are responsible for changes in cell ion and water balance at apoptosis. The original version of the mathematical model of cell ion and water balance was used for analysis of the unidirectional ion fluxes under the balanced distribution of major monovalent ions across the cell membrane. The values of all major components of the Na(+) and K(+) efflux and influx, i.e. fluxes via the Na(+),K(+)-ATPase pump, Na(+) channels, K(+) channels, Na/Na exchanger and Na-Cl symport were determined. It is concluded that apoptotic cell shrinkage and changes in Na(+) and K(+) fluxes typical of apoptosis in U937 cells induced by staurosporine are caused by a complex decrease in the pump activity, Na-Cl symport and integral Na(+) channel permeability.",M2
17189489,"Saccharomyces cerevisiae multidrug resistance transporter Qdr2 is implicated in potassium uptake, providing a physiological advantage to quinidine-stressed cells.The QDR2 gene of Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes a putative plasma membrane drug:H(+) antiporter that confers resistance against quinidine, barban, bleomycin, and cisplatin. This work provides experimental evidence of defective K(+) (<e>Rb</e>(+)) uptake in the absence of QDR2. The direct involvement of Qdr2p in K(+) uptake is reinforced by the fact that increased K(+) (Rb(+)) uptake due to QDR2 expression is independent of the Trk1p/Trk2p system. QDR2 expression confers a physiological advantage for the yeast cell during the onset of K(+) limited growth, due either to a limiting level of K(+) in the growth medium or to the presence of quinidine. This drug decreases the K(+) uptake rate and K(+) accumulation in the yeast cell, especially in the Deltaqdr2 mutant. Qdr2p also helps to sustain the decrease of intracellular pH in quinidine-stressed cells in growth medium at pH 5.5 by indirectly promoting H(+) extrusion affected by the drug. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that Qdr2p may also couple K(+) movement with substrate export, presumably with quinidine. Other clues to the biological role of QDR2 in the yeast cell come from two additional lines of experimental evidence. First, QDR2 transcription is activated under nitrogen (NH(4)(+)) limitation or when the auxotrophic strain examined enters stationary phase due to leucine limitation, this regulation being dependent on general amino acid control by Gcn4p. Second, the amino acid pool is higher in Deltaqdr2 cells than in wild-type cells, indicating that QDR2 expression is, directly or indirectly, involved in amino acid homeostasis.",M2
17162942,"Movement of dengue vectors between the human modified environment and an urban forest in Rio de Janeiro.The movement of Aedes aegypti (L.) and Aedes albopictus (Skuse) females between sylvatic and urban environments was investigated by marking, releasing, and recapturing adults and by identifying rubidium (<e>Rb</e>)-marked eggs of females that were released after taking a bloodmeal containing RbCI. When released in the forest, Ae. albopictus females flew as far as 1000 m and reached houses within 1 wk. When Ae. albopictus were released close to houses, most females were recaptured near the release point, and Rb-marked eggs were found 1000 m away in the forest only once, 35 d after the release. These differing patterns of movement may suggest a preference of Ae. albopictus for the human-modified environment. Ae. aegypti, however, showed low tendency to disperse into the forest. The capacity of Ae. albopictus females to disperse from a sylvatic into a human-modified environment suggests that this species may play a role in the dissemination of forest-restricted pathogens, such as yellow fever virus.",M2
17130901,"Rottlerin inhibits P2X(7) receptor-stimulated phospholipase D activity in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia B-lymphocytes.Phospholipase D (PLD) is a ubiquitous enzyme that can be activated by extracellular adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) in B-lymphocytes from subjects with chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). In this study, ATP- but not PMA-induced PLD stimulation in CLL B-lymphocytes was abolished in the presence of an anti-P2X(7) receptor monoclonal antibody, as well as in B-lymphocytes from CLL subjects homozygous for the Glu(496) to Ala loss-of-function P2X(7) polymorphism. Rottlerin, an inhibitor of novel protein kinase C (PKC) isoforms, but not GF 109203X, an inhibitor of conventional PKC isoforms, impaired the ATP-stimulated PLD activity in CLL B-lymphocytes. In contrast, both inhibitors impaired PLD activity stimulated by PMA, a known mediator of PKC activation. The inhibition of P2X(7)-stimulated PLD activity by rottlerin was attributed to a target downstream of P2X(7) activation, as the ATP-mediated (86)<e>Rb</e>(+) efflux from CLL B-lymphocytes was not altered in the presence of rottlerin. Our results indicate a possible role for novel PKC isoforms in the regulation of P2X(7)-mediated PLD activity.",M2
17103013,"Cloning of two SOS1 transporters from the seagrass Cymodocea nodosa. SOS1 transporters from Cymodocea and Arabidopsis mediate potassium uptake in bacteria.Two cDNAs isolated from Cymodocea nodosa, CnSOS1A, and CnSOSIB encode proteins with high-sequence similarities to SOS1 plant transporters. CnSOS1A expressed in a yeast Na+-efflux mutant under the control of a constitutive expression promoter mimicked AtSOS1 from Arabidopsis; the wild type cDNA did not improve the growth of the recipient strain in the presence of Na+, but a cDNA mutant that expresses a truncated protein suppressed the defect of the yeast mutant. In similar experiments, CnSOS1B was not effective. Conditional expression, under the control of an arabinose responsive promoter, of the CnSOSIA and CnSOS1B cDNAs in an Escherichia coli mutant defective in Na+ efflux was toxic, and functional analyses were inconclusive. The same constructs transformed into an E. coli K+-uptake mutant revealed that CnSOS1A was also toxic, but that it slightly suppressed defective growth at low K+. Truncation in the C-terminal hydrophilic tail of CnSOS1A relieved the toxicity and proved that CnSOS1A was an excellent low-affinity K+ and <e>Rb</e>+ transporter. CnSOS1B mediated a transient, extremely rapid K+ or Rb+ influx. Similar tests with AtSOS1 revealed that it was not toxic and that the whole protein exhibited excellent K+ and Rb+ uptake characteristics in bacteria.",M2
17098581,"Rubidium content in autopsy liver tissue samples from Greenlandic Inuit and Danes measured by X-ray fluorescence spectrometry.BACKGROUND: The biological function of rubidium (<e>Rb</e>) is unknown, but this alkali metal probably has a normal biologic role. OBJECTIVE: To measure the content of Rb in liver tissue samples from Greenlandic Inuit using X-ray fluorescence spectrometry, and compare the results with those obtained in liver samples from ethnic Danes. STUDY DESIGN: Observational, descriptive survey on environmental pathology. METHODS: The setting was related to forensic medicine and hospitalised care in Nuuk, Ilulissat and Copenhagen. Normal liver tissue was obtained at autopsy from 50 Greenlandic Inuit (27 men) with a median age of 61 years (range 23-83) and from 42 Danes (31 men) with a median age of 38 years (range 16-83). RESULTS: Liver Rb content in Inuit was not significantly different compared with Danes. There was no significant gender difference in liver Rb content either in Inuit or in Danes. The content of Rb given as median (5-95 percentile) was 0.1837mmol/kg dry liver (0.1041-0.3147) in Inuit, and 0.1965mmol/kg dry liver (0.0799-0.2815) in Danes (p=0.6). There was an inverse correlation between liver Rb content and age in Inuit (r(s)=-0.45, p=0.002) but not in Danes. Median hepatic Rb index (Rb content in micromol/kg dry weight divided by age in years) in Inuit was 3.05 and in Danes 4.21 (p=0.02). The correlations between liver Rb and liver potassium content were: Inuit r(s)=0.28, p=0.07; Danes r(s)=0.25, p=0.08; combined series r(s)=0.34, p=0.01. CONCLUSIONS: Inuit have liver Rb levels, which are quite similar to the levels found in Danes. In Inuit, liver Rb content appears to decrease with age.",M2
17059226,"Eosin fluorescence changes during <e>Rb</e>+ occlusion in the Na+/K(+)-ATPase.We used suspensions of partially purified Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase from pig kidney to compare the effects of Rb(+), as a K(+) congener, on the time course and on the equilibrium values of eosin fluorescence and of Rb(+) occlusion. Both sets of data were collected under identical conditions in the same enzyme preparations. The incubation media lacked ATP so that all changes led to an equilibrium distribution between enzyme conformers with and without bound eosin and with and without bound or occluded Rb(+). Results showed that as Rb(+) concentration was increased, the equilibrium value of fluorescence decreased and occlusion increased along rectangular hyperbolas with similar half-maximal values. The time courses of attainment of equilibrium showed an initial phase which was so quick as to fall below the time resolution of our rapid-mixing apparatus. This phase was followed by the sum of at least two exponential functions of time. In the case of fluorescence the fast exponential term accounted for a larger fraction of the time course than in the case of occlusion. Comparison between experimental and simulated results suggests that fluorescence changes express a process that is coupled to Rb(+) occlusion but that is completed before occlusion reaches equilibrium.",M2
16945016,"<e>Rb</e>+ efflux through functional activation of cardiac KCNQ1/minK channels by the benzodiazepine R-L3 (L-364,373).The slow delayed rectifier K+ current, Iks, encoded by KCNQ1 (KvLQT1)/KCNE1 (mink) genes, contributes to cardiac action potential repolarization and determines the heartbeat rate. Mutations in either KCNQ1 or KCNE1 that reduce Iks cause long-QT syndrome (LQTS), a disorder of ventricular repolarization that results in cardiac arrhythmia and sudden death. A well-recognized potential treatment for LQTS caused by reduction of Iks is to enhance functional activation of cardiac KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels. In the present study, we generated a stable Chinese hamster ovary cell line that expresses KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels confirmed by electrophysiology. Using a pharmacological tool compound R-L3 (L-364,373 [(3-R)-1,3-dihydro-5-(2-fluorophenyl)-3-(1H-indol- 3-ylmethyl)-1-methyl-2H-1,4-benzodiazepin-2-one]), which activates KCNQ1/mink channels, we then developed and validated a non-radioactive rubidium (Rb+) efflux assay that directly measures the functional activity of KCNQ1/KCNE1 channels by atomic absorption spectroscopy. Our results show that the validated Rb+ efflux assay can be used for screening of KCNQ1/KCNE1 openers that potentially treat LQTS in both inherited and acquired forms. In addition, the assay also can be used for evaluation of possible long-QT liability during cardiac selectivity of new chemical entities.",M2
16943600,"<e>Rb</e>-Cs ratio as an indicator of fish diet in lakes of the Patagonia, Argentina.The ratios of Rb to Cs contents were studied in five fish species from seven lakes located in the Patagonia Andean Range, Argentina in order to trace fish diet. The species studied were native velvet catfish (Diplomistes viedmensis) and creole perch (Percichthys trucha), and exotic brown trout (Salmo trutta), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and brook trout (Salvenilus fontinalis). Rainbow trout specimens from two farms were also studied, as well as fish food items and native mussels (Diplodon chilensis). Rb and Cs concentrations were determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis. A positive correlation of Cs concentration in the muscle of velvet catfish with fish length was observed, probably associated with the long biological half-life of this element in this species, whereas the Rb concentration remained constant, hence inhibiting the use of Rb-Cs ratios as a tracer in this case. Seasonal variations observed for rainbow trout and Cs concentration background bias in one of the lakes studied are also a limiting factor to the use of Rb-Cs ratios as a diet tracer. Rb-Cs ratios allowed clear differentiation of rainbow trout raised in farms from the natural specimens that lived in the same environment, in agreement with Rb-Cs ratios determined in both diets. Rb-Cs ratios in rainbow trout showed significant differences between Rivadavia and Futalaufquen lakes compared to Moreno and Nahuel Huapi lakes, which could be associated with a higher participation of plankton in the diet in the first case. No relevant variations in Rb-Cs ratios of brown trout were observed, probably because of the similarity in the diet.",M2
16939283,"Structural and functional consequences of an amide-to-ester substitution in the selectivity filter of a potassium channel.The selectivity filter of K(+) channels comprises four contiguous ion binding sites, S1 through S4. Structural and functional data indicate that the filter contains on average two K(+) ions at any given time and that these ions reside primarily in two configurations, namely to sites S1 and S3 or to sites S2 and S4. Maximum ion flux through the channel is expected to occur when the energy difference between these two binding configurations is zero. In this study, we have used protein semisynthesis to selectively perturb site 1 within the filter of the KcsA channel through use of an amide-to-ester substitution. The modification alters K(+) conduction properties. The structure of the selectivity filter is largely unperturbed by the modification, despite the loss of an ordered water molecule normally located just behind the filter. Introduction of the ester moiety was found to alter the distribution of K(+), <e>Rb</e>(+,) and Cs(+) within the filter, with the most dramatic change found for Rb(+). The redistribution of ions is associated with the appearance of a partially hydrated ion just external to the filter, at a position where no ion is observed in the wild-type channel. The appearance of this new ion-binding site creates a change in the distance between a pair of K(+) ions some fraction of the time, apparently leading to a reduction in the ion conduction rate. Importantly, this finding suggests that the selectivity filter of a potassium channel is optimized both in terms of absolute ion occupancy and in terms of the separation in distance between the conducting ions.",M2

Mutation leading to development of Cs(+)-R phenotype could be overcome by availability of Cs(+)/Rb(+). Parent and mutant strains were similar with respect to their Cs(+)/Rb(+) uptake.

In this study, we characterized components of the electrogenic (86)<e>Rb</e>(+) flux observed in isolated chromaffin granules. In order to study single channel activity, chromaffin granules from the bovine adrenal medulla were incorporated into planar lipid bilayers.

A multiconductance potassium channel with a conductivity of 110 +/- 8 pS and 31 +/- 4 pS was also found.

16847099,"A trapped intracellular cation modulates K+ channel recovery from slow inactivation.Upon depolarization, many voltage-gated potassium channels undergo a time-dependent decrease in conductance known as inactivation. Both entry of channels into an inactivated state and recovery from this state govern cellular excitability. In this study, we show that recovery from slow inactivation is regulated by intracellular permeant cations. When inactivated channels are hyperpolarized, closure of the activation gate traps a cation between the activation and inactivation gates. The identity of the trapped cation determines the rate of recovery, and the ability of cations to promote recovery follows the rank order K+ &gt; NH4+ &gt; <e>Rb</e>+ &gt; Cs+ &gt;&gt; Na+, TMA. The striking similarity between this rank order and that for single channel conductance suggests that these two processes share a common feature. We propose that the rate of recovery from slow inactivation is determined by the ability of entrapped cations to move into a binding site in the channel's selectivity filter, and refilling of this site is required for recovery.",M2

16626643,"Nicotinic receptor inactivation after acute and repeated in vivo nicotine exposures in rats.Nicotine tolerance is often accompanied by an upregulation of brain area nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) in both animal and human subjects. This upregulation has been hypothesized to result from repeated or prolonged exposures of these receptors to nicotine. To explore this further, this study examined the level of nAChR desensitization following acute and repeated nicotine administration in the male Lewis rat. Nicotine-stimulated (86)<e>Rb</e>(+) efflux was measured in synaptosomes prepared from the frontal cortex, hippocampus, striatum, and thalamus. Analysis of receptor functionality was achieved by calculating area-under-the-curve (AUC) for nicotine-induced fractional (86)Rb(+) efflux. Nicotine-stimulated (86)Rb(+) efflux from all brain regions was significantly less in rats that received an acute injection of 0.4 mg/kg nicotine (s.c.) 15 min prior to dissection compared to control rats. This decrease in nAChR functional status was also observed in rats treated with 1 day or 14 days of twice-daily nicotine administration. These results are consistent with the concept that acute exposure to nicotine induces rapid desensitization of nAChRs. In addition, following repeated exposure to nicotine, nAChRs did not become tolerant to the loss in receptor function that occurs after an initial nicotine administration. Overall, these data suggest that neuronal adaptations underlying nicotine tolerance may begin upon initial exposure then persist following repeated exposures.",M2
16603545,"Binding of a single <e>Rb</e>+ increases Na+/K+-ATPase, activating dephosphorylation without stoichiometric occlusion.We used partially purified Na+/K+-ATPase from pig kidney to study dephosphorylation, occlusion, and ATPase activity in the same enzyme preparation and in media of identical composition containing 10 microM ATP and different concentrations of Rb+, used as a K+ congener. The experiments were performed using a rapid-mixing apparatus with a time resolution of 3.5 ms. The main findings were as follows. (i) At sufficiently low Rb+ concentration the initial rate of dephosphorylation was higher than that of occlusion, (ii) as [Rb+] tended to zero the slope of the time course of occlusion but not that of the time course of dephosphorylation approached zero and, (iii) as Rb+ concentration increased, ATPase activity first increased and, after passing through a maximum, tended to a value that was lower than that observed in media without Rb+. None of these results is compatible with the currently held idea that binding of a single Rb+ to the E2P conformer of the ATPase does not modify the rate of dephosphorylation and strongly suggest that a single Rb+ does promote dephosphorylation through a mechanism that is not stoichiometrically coupled to Rb+ occlusion. If this mechanism is included in the currently accepted scheme for ATP hydrolysis by the Na+/K+-ATPase, a reasonable prediction of the experimental results is obtained.",M2
16563806,"Optimisation and validation of a medium-throughput electrophysiology-based hERG assay using IonWorks HT.INTRODUCTION: Regulatory and competitive pressure to reduce the QT interval prolongation risk of potential new drugs has led to focus on methods to test for inhibition of the human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG)-encoded K+ channel, the primary molecular target underlying this safety issue. Here we describe the validation of a method that combines medium-throughput with direct assessment of channel function. METHODS: The electrophysiological and pharmacological properties of hERG were compared using two methods: conventional, low-throughput electrophysiology and planar-array-based, medium-throughput electrophysiology (IonWorks HT). A pharmacological comparison was also made between IonWorks HT and an indirect assay (<e>Rb</e>+ efflux). RESULTS: Basic electrophysiological properties of hERG were similar whether recorded conventionally (HEK cells) or using IonWorks HT (CHO cells): for example, tail current V1/2 -12.1+/-5.0 mV (32) for conventional and -9.5+/-6.0 mV (46) for IonWorks HT (mean+/-S.D. (n)). A key finding was that as the number of cells per well was increased in IonWorks HT, the potency reported for a given compound decreased. Using the lowest possible cell concentration (250,000 cells/ml) and 89 compounds spanning a broad potency range, the pIC50 values from IonWorks HT (CHO-hERG) were found to correlate well with those obtained using conventional methodology (HEK-hERG)(r=0.90; p&lt;0.001). Further validation using CHO-hERG cells with both methods confirmed the correlation (r=0.94; p&lt;0.001). In contrast, a comparison of IonWorks HT and Rb+ efflux data with 649 compounds using CHO-hERG cells showed that the indirect assay consistently reported compounds as being, on average, 6-fold less potent, though the differences varied depending on chemical series. DISCUSSION: The main finding of this work is that providing a relatively low cell concentration is used in IonWorks HT, the potency information generated correlates well with that determined using conventional electrophysiology. The effect on potency of increasing cell concentration may relate to a reduced free concentration of test compound owing to partitioning into cell membranes. In summary, the IonWorks HT hERG assay can generate pIC50 values based on a direct assessment of channel function in a timeframe short enough to influence chemical design.",M2
16513790,"Base of pore loop is important for rectification, activation, permeation, and block of Kir3.1/Kir3.4.The Kir3.1/Kir3.4 channel is an inward rectifier, agonist-activated K(+) channel. The location of the binding site within the channel pore that coordinates polyamines (and is thus responsible for inward rectification) and the location of the gate that opens the channel in response to agonist activation is unclear. In this study, we show, not surprisingly, that mutation of residues at the base of the selectivity filter in the pore loop and second transmembrane domain weakens Cs(+) block and decreases selectivity (as measured by <e>Rb</e>(+) and spermine permeation). However, unexpectedly, the mutations also weaken inward rectification and abolish agonist activation of the channel. In the wild-type channel and 34 mutant channels, there are significant (p &lt; 0.05) correlations among the K(D) for Cs(+) block, Rb(+) and spermine permeation, inward rectification, and agonist activation. The significance of these findings is discussed. One possible conclusion is that the selectivity filter is responsible for inward rectification and agonist activation as well as permeation and block.",M2
16506892,"Application of cryopreserved cells to HERG screening using a non-radioactive <e>Rb</e>+ efflux assay.The aim of the present study was to test the use of cryopreserved cells for human ether-ago- go (hERG) channel screening. A stable Chinese hamster ovary-K1 cell line expressing hERG channels was used in a non-radioactive Rb+ efflux assay for screening hERG channel activity. Cells prepared from normal cultures and following cryopreservation were compared with regard to time course of Rb+ efflux response at different concentrations of KCl, overall cell morphology, signal-to noise assay window, assay robustness, and 50% inhibitory concentration (IC50) of the hERG blocker dofetilide. Our results showed that cryopreserved hERG-expressing cells at 1, 2, and 3 days following plating at different cell densities had no obvious morphological changes in comparison to the growing cells. The assay window, Z' factor, and IC50 of dofetilide were also very similar in all series of cells tested. It was concluded that the cryopreserved hERG cells prepared using the protocol described are as effective as growing hERG cells in the non-radioactive Rb+ efflux assay.",M2
16506891,"Evaluation of the rubidium efflux assay for preclinical identification of HERG blockade.Inhibition of the delayed-rectifier potassium channel current, human ether-a-go-go (hERG), by pharmaceutical agents can lead to acquired long QT syndrome and the generation of potentially lethal arrhythmias and sudden death. There remains an unmet need for higher-throughput assays to screen compounds in preclinical development for the potential to block hERG and cause QT prolongation. We evaluated the rubidium efflux assay for its ability to determine block of the hERG potassium channel. hERG-transfected human embryonic kidney-293 cells were cultured on 96-well assay plates and loaded with rubidium ion by incubating in media in which potassium was replaced by 5.4 mM <e>Rb</e>+. Cells were exposed to test compounds and then depolarized with a K+ channel opening buffer containing 50 mM K+. The supernatant was removed, and cells were lysed using 0.1% Triton X-100. Concentration-response curves were generated for test agents by determining the Rb+ efflux using a flame atomic absorption spectrometer. Multiple trials with cisapride yielded 50% inhibitory concentration values between 308.1 +/- 11 nM to 456.3 +/- 24 nM for inhibition of Rb+ efflux and a Z factor of 0.80 +/- 0.07 (n = 5 plates, 12 wells per plate). The values for inhibition of the hERG channel exhibited a rightward shift in potency as compared to those measured using electrophysiological techniques. In addition, we evaluated 19 blinded compounds at 10 microM in the Rb+ efflux assay, and compared results to those using patch clamp electrophysiology and the dofetilide displacement binding assay. The dofetilide displacement binding assay yielded a good correlation with electrophysiological measurements of hERG block. The rubidium efflux assay lacked sensitivity to consistently identify significant channel blockade. In conclusion, the rubidium efflux assay provides a higher-throughput means to identify potent hERG channel blocking agents, but lacks the sensitivity required to accurately determine the potency of blockade.",M2
16506888,"Validation of DRG-like F11 cells for evaluation of KCNQ/M-channel modulators.F11 cells are derived from a fusion between mouse embryonic neuroblastoma and rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons. These cells have been shown to retain many features of native DRG neurons, including synthesis of neurotransmitters, expression of neuropeptide receptors, and voltage-gated calcium channels. In this study, we describe the presence of KCNQ2/3 channels in F11 cells as determined by both reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and functional assessment. Electrophysiological recordings in whole-cell configuration performed in F11 cells revealed the functional expression of a KCNQ/M-current with characteristic slow deactivation kinetics, similar to the KCNQ/M-current recorded from dissociated DRG neurons. Deactivation tail currents elicited by conventional M-current protocols were enhanced by a specific KCNQ/M-channel opener, WAY-1, and inhibited by the specific blocker XE991 [10,10-bis(4-pyridinylmethyl)-9(10H)- anthracenone]. Using a non-radioactive atomic absorption <e>Rb</e>+ efflux assay, we further validated that Rb+ efflux can be induced in differentiated F11 cells by activation of KCNQ/M-channels. These findings have led us to conclude that F11 cells can be used as a DRG cell model to evaluate effects of KCNQ/M-channel modulators.",M2
16486926,"Optical pumping system design for large production of hyperpolarized.We present a design for a spin-exchange optical pumping system to produce large quantities of highly polarized 129Xe. Low xenon concentrations in the flowing gas mixture allow the laser to maintain high <e>Rb</e> polarization. The large spin-exchange rate between Rb and 129Xe through the long-lived van der Waals molecules at low pressure, combined with a high flow rate, results in large production rates of hyperpolarized xenon. We report a maximum polarization of 64% achieved for a 0.3 l/h Xe flow rate, and maximum magnetization output of 6 l/h at 22% polarization. Our findings regarding the polarization dependence on temperature, nitrogen partial pressure, and gas mixture flow velocity are also reported.",M2
16477998,"Testing of conductivity/calcium and rubidium/strontium ratios as indicators of the chemical stability of a river: comparison with a biological indicator.It is customary to detect pollution in a water flow by monitoring the increase of sensitive elements concentrations (NH4+, PO4(3-), NO3-...). However, concentrations are dependent on the flow rate and these compounds are not conservative, implying a concentration decrease downstream leading to false negative diagnosis of pollution impact. The use of elemental ratios of conservative compounds should diminish these pitfalls. We then thought of the chi/Ca (conductivity/calcium) and <e>Rb</e>/Sr (rubidium/strontium) ratios as water chemical stability indicators to clearly identify and discriminate point from diffuse pollutions. This hypothesis has been tested on 12 brooks located in the basin of Lake Geneva, during 2 hydrological years. The results were compared to the observed land use of the watershed and a biological indicator: the Pollution Sensitivity Index (PSI). The PSI is calculated from diatom taxonomy and evaluates biological quality with a grade ranging from 0 to 20 (bad to excellent). The main results of the research can be summarized as follows. The pollution signal is observable far downstream of the pollution site. Both chi/Ca and Rb/Sr ratios are water quality indicators expressing the stability of water chemistry. They can both be used to detect diffuse and point pollution impact. These indicators provide complementary information: chi/Ca variations increase in case of point pollution; Rb/Sr variations increase when diffuse pollutions occur. The results obtained with the indicators chi/Ca and Rb/Sr agree with biological indicator and observation of the land use. chi/Ca and Rb/Sr ratios represent important tools to identify and discriminate point source pollution from diffuse pollution.",M2
16473910,"Gating of cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNGA1) channels by cGMP jumps and depolarizing voltage steps.We expressed rod-type homotetrameric cyclic nucleotide-gated (CNGA1) channels in Xenopus oocytes and studied activation by photolysis-induced jumps of the 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) concentration and by voltage steps. cGMP jumps to increasing concentrations up to the EC50 value of 46.5 microM decelerate the activation gating, indicative that even at concentrations of cGMP &lt;&lt; EC50 binding is not rate limiting. Above the EC50 value, activation by cGMP jumps is again accelerated to the higher concentrations. At the same cGMP concentration, the speed of the activation gating by depolarizing voltage steps is roughly similar to that by cGMP jumps. Permeating ions passing the pore more slowly (<e>Rb</e>+ &gt; K+ &gt; Na+) slow down the activation time course. At the single-channel level, cGMP jumps to high concentrations cause openings directly to the main open level without passing sublevels. From these results it is concluded that at both low and high cGMP the gating of homotetrameric CNGA1 channels is not rate-limited by the cGMP binding but by conformational changes of the channel which are voltage dependent and include movements in the pore region.",M2
16240044,"Balanced basis sets of split valence, triple zeta valence and quadruple zeta valence quality for H to Rn: Design and assessment of accuracy.Gaussian basis sets of quadruple zeta valence quality for <e>Rb</e>-Rn are presented, as well as bases of split valence and triple zeta valence quality for H-Rn. The latter were obtained by (partly) modifying bases developed previously. A large set of more than 300 molecules representing (nearly) all elements-except lanthanides-in their common oxidation states was used to assess the quality of the bases all across the periodic table. Quantities investigated were atomization energies, dipole moments and structure parameters for Hartree-Fock, density functional theory and correlated methods, for which we had chosen Møller-Plesset perturbation theory as an example. Finally recommendations are given which type of basis set is used best for a certain level of theory and a desired quality of results.",M2
16171405,"Importance of the GP dipeptide of the antiporter motif and other membrane-embedded proline and glycine residues in tetracycline efflux protein Tet(L).Proline and glycine residues are well represented among functionally important residues in hydrophobic domains of membrane transport proteins, and several critical roles have been suggested for them. Here, the effects of mutational changes in membrane-embedded proline and glycine residues of Tet(L) were examined, with a focus on the conserved GP(155,156) dipeptide of motif C, a putative  antiporter motif . Mutation of Gly155 to cysteine resulted in a mutant Tet(L) that bound its tetracycline-divalent metal (Tc-Me2+) substrate but did not catalyze efflux or exchange of Tc-Me2+ or catalyze uptake or exchange of <e>Rb</e>+ which was used to monitor the coupling ion. These results support suggestions that this region is involved in the conformational changes required for translocation. Mutations in Pro156 resulted in reduction (P156G) or loss (P156A or P156C) of Tc-Me2+ efflux capacity. All three Pro156 mutants exhibited a K+ leak (monitored by 86Rb+ fluxes) that was not observed in wild-type Tet(L). A similar leak was observed in a mutant in a membrane-embedded proline residue elsewhere in the Tet(L) protein (P175C) as well as in a P156C mutant of related antiporter Tet(K). These findings are consistent with roles proposed for membrane-embedded prolines in tight helix packing. Patterns of Tc resistance conferred by additional Tet(L) mutants indicate important roles for another GP dipeptide in transmembrane segment (TMS) X as well as for membrane-embedded glycine residues in TMS XIII.",M2
16146341,"Introduction of unsaturation into the N-n-alkyl chain of the nicotinic receptor antagonists, NONI and NDNI: effect on affinity and selectivity.N-n-octylnicotinium iodide (NONI) and N-n-decylnicotinium iodide (NDNI) are selective nicotinic receptor (nAChR) antagonists mediating nicotine-evoked striatal dopamine (DA) release, and inhibiting [3H]nicotine binding, respectively. This study evaluated effects of introducing unsaturation into the N-n-alkyl chains of NONI and NDNI on inhibition of [3H]nicotine and [3H]methyllycaconitine binding (alpha4beta2* and alpha7* nAChRs, respectively), (86)<e>Rb</e>+ efflux and [3H]DA release (agonist or antagonist effects at alpha4beta2* and alpha6beta2*-containing nAChRs, respectively). In the NONI series, introduction of a C3-cis- (NONB3c), C3-trans- (NONB3t), C7-double-bond (NONB7e), or C3-triple-bond (NONB3y) afforded a 4-fold to 250-fold increased affinity for [3H]nicotine binding sites compared with NONI. NONB7e and NONB3y inhibited nicotine-evoked 86Rb+ efflux, indicating alpha4beta2* antagonism. NONI analogs exhibited a 3-fold to 8-fold greater potency inhibiting nicotine-evoked [3H]DA overflow compared with NONI (IC50 = 0.62 microM; Imax = 89%), with no change in Imax, except for NONB3y (Imax = 50%). In the NDNI series, introduction of a C4-cis- (NDNB4c), C4-trans-double-bond (NDNB4t), or C3-triple-bond (NDNB3y) afforded a 4-fold to 80-fold decreased affinity for [3H]nicotine binding sites compared with NDNI, whereas introduction of a C9 double-bond (NDNB9e) did not alter affinity. NDNB3y and NDNB4t inhibited nicotine-evoked 86Rb+ efflux, indicating antagonism at alpha4beta2* nAChRs. Although NDNI had no effect, NDNB4t and NDNB9e potently inhibited nicotine-evoked [3H]DA overflow (IC50 = 0.02-0.14 microM, Imax = 90%), as did NDNB4c (IC50 = 0.08 microM; Imax = 50%), whereas NDNB3y showed no inhibition. None of the analogs had significant affinity for alpha7* nAChRs. Thus, unsaturated NONI analogs had enhanced affinity at alpha4beta2*- and alpha6beta2*-containing nAChRs, however a general reduction of affinity at alpha4beta2* and an uncovering of antagonist effects at alpha6beta2*-containing nAChRs were observed with unsaturated NDNI analogs.",M2
16128076,"[Study on the spectra of NTO and its rubidium salt in aqueous solution]In this paper, the Raman and difference FTIR spectra of NTO crystal, NTO solutions at different pH and saturated aqueous solution of <e>Rb</e>(NTO) x H2O have been studied. The determined structure of crystal suggests that the metal ion with oxygen and nitrogen atoms of [chemical structure see text] C-N, [chemical structure see text] C-NO2, [chemical structure see text] C=O and H2O formed bonds. The highest characterization peaks of Raman and FTIR spectra show that [chemical structure see text] C-NO2, [chemical structure see text] C=O and [chemical structure see text] C-N of NTO- formed week coordination bonds. The vibration spectra of saturation solution basically accord with those of the crystal. The bonds of saturation solution of the coordination compound have not changed. Therefore, the different vibration spectra of the saturation water solution of Rb (NTO) x H2O can be explicated by the formation of the bonds in crystal. The coordination compound formation mechanism of metal ion with NTO in alkali aqueous solution is discussed.",M2
16444007,"Influence of lanthanum on the accumulation of trace elements in chloroplasts of cucumber seedling leaves.Influence of La3+ on the accumulation of trace elements (75Se, 56 Co, 83 <e>Rb</e>, 48 V, 95 mTc, and 67Ga) in chloroplasts of cucumber seedling leaves was studied by a radioactive multi-tracer technique. At the same time, chloroplast contents of different concentrations of La3+ treatment were calculated. It was observed that chloroplast contents peaked at 0.02 mM La3+ treatment and that the uptake and distribution of these trace elements in chloroplasts of cucumber seedling leaves are different under different La3+ treatments. With the increase of lanthanum concentrations from 0.002 to 2 mM, the uptake percentages of 75Se, 56 Co, and 83 Rb presented an obvious increase and then sharply decreased in contrast to the non-lanthanum treatment, whereas there appeared a sharp decrease and then restored control level in the uptake of 48 V. The other two trace elements, namely 95 mTc and 67Ga, were accumulated only in the presence of 0.02 mM La3+. The results indicate that lanthanum treatments to growing the cucumber lead to the change of trace element uptake in the chloroplasts of leaves, which suggest that lanthanum might influence the accumulation of trace elements in chloroplasts of cucumber seedling leaves by regulation of various ion transport mechanisms, thus affecting the photosystem of leaves.",M2
16283201,"Allosteric effects of external K+ ions mediated by the aspartate of the GYGD signature sequence in the Kv2.1 K+ channel.K+ channels achieve exquisite ion selectivity without jeopardizing efficient permeation by employing multiple, interacting K+-binding sites. Introduction ofa cadmium (Cd2+)-binding site in the external vestibule of Kv2.1 (drk1), allowed us to functionally characterize a binding site for external monovalent cations. Permeant ions displayed higher affinity for this site than non-permeant monovalent cations, although the selectivity profile was different from that of the channel. Point mutations identified the highly conserved aspartate residue immediately following the selectivity filter as a critical determinant of the antagonism between external K+ and Cd2+ ions. A conservative mutation at this position (D378E) significantly affected the open-state stability. Moreover, the mean open time was found to be modulated by external K+ concentration, suggesting a coupling between channel closing and the permeation process. Reducing the <e>Rb</e>+ conductance by mutating the selectivity filter to the sequence found inKv4.1, also significantly reduced the effectiveness ofRb+ ions to antagonize Cd2+ inhibition, thereby implicating the selectivity filter as the site at which K+ions exert their antagonistic effect on Cd2+ block. The equivalent of D378 in KcsA, D80, takes part in an inter-subunit hydrogen-bond network that allows D80to functionally interact with the selectivity filter. The results suggest that external K+ ions antagonize Cd2+inhibition (in I379C) and modulate the mean open time(in the wild-type Kv2.1) by altering the occupancy profile of the K+-binding sites in the selectivity filter.",M2
