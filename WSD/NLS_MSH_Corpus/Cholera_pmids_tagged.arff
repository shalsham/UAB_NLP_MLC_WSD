The appearance of <e>cholera</e> in 1832 in southwest France]In 1832 the epidemic cholera provoked the fear of a new plague on the banks of the Garonne and the administrative measures to struggle against the illness as the sprawling epidemic could be delimited in three departments. The author describes the clinical pictures of the illness and underlines the prophylactic measures which followed from epidemics of previous centuries and lasted until pasteurism, the increasing hygiene and the apparition of chemical treatments.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Seven hundred strains of V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 serogroups were studied in reaction of slide-agglutination with array of 80 diagnostic sera for non-O1/non-O139 serogroups. Selective screening of strains representing dominating serogroups was performed for extended number of genetic determinants of pathogenicity factors. RESULTS: It was established that V. cholerae belonging to serogroups O53, O67, O75, and O76 are dominating in water ecosystems of Rostov-on-Don city at this time. All studied strains were characterized by lack of <e>cholera</e> toxin genes and toxin-coregulated pili but had different combinations of genes of additional virulence factors. There was no correlation between genotypic characteristics and serogroup. CONCLUSION: The study showed that change of serologic landscape of V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 occurred in water objects in studied area during last decades. Necessity of dynamic surveillance for circulation of V. cholerae non-O1/non-O139 in aquatic environment with widening of studied spectrum of their biological features was demonstrated.",M1

Isolates from the northeastern regions were analyzed. Interestingly, the outbreak strain was identified as biotype El Tor; serotype Ogawa with cholera toxin B subunit gene (ctxB) of the classical type and CTX prophage repressor gene of the El Tor type. The clone was genetically closely related to pulsotype H, which is predominantly found in India. It was probably introduced into Thailand recently.",M1
20417206,"Molecular basis of <e>cholera</e> blood-group dependence and implications for a world characterized by climate change.Climate change has the potential to increase the threat of water-borne diseases, through rises in temperature and sea-level, and precipitation variability. Cholera poses a particular threat, and the need to develop better intervention tools is imminent. Cholera infections are particularly severe for blood group O individuals, who are less protected by the current vaccines. Here we derive a hypothesis as to the molecular origins of blood-group dependence of this disease, based on relevant epidemiological, clinical and molecular data, and give suggestions on how to plan prevention strategies, and develop novel and improved pharmaceuticals.",M1

20336507,"Virulence profile and clonal relationship among the Vibrio cholerae isolates from ground and surface water in a <e>cholera</e> endemic area during rainy season.All the V. cholerae non-O1, non-O139 isolates from ground and surface water samples collected during the rainy season (rainfall contributes significantly in the spread of cholera) contained ompW and a regulatory toxR gene, while many others possessed accessory cholera toxin (ace), hemolysin (hlyA) and outer membrane protein (ompU) genes. All the isolates lacked ctxAB, tcp, zot, rfbO1 and rfbO139 genes. The strains could be grouped into two main clusters colligating the isolates from ground water and surface water samples. The results suggest that surface water harbors various virulent V. cholerae strains that contaminate the ground water due to rain or poor hygienic practices, and result in the emergence of new toxigenic strains for cholera.",M1
20301065,"Health impact of the 2004 Andaman Nicobar earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia.BACKGROUND: The human impact of the tsunami that occurred on 26 December 2004 was enormous, with Indonesia bearing a huge proportion of the losses. The aftermath brought predictions of communicable disease outbreaks and widespread fear of epidemics. However, evidence from previous disasters due to natural hazards does not support all of these predictions. The objectives of this study were to: (1) describe the relative importance of infectious diseases and injuries as a consequence of a disaster due to natural hazards; and (2) identify key recommendations for the improvement of control and surveillance of these diseases during and after disasters. METHODS: A team from the Center for Research on the Epidemiology of Disasters visited Jakarta and Banda Aceh from 11-23 January 2005, and collected data from the Central and Provincial Ministries of Health (MOH), the World Health Organization (WHO), and a field hospital from the International Committee of the Red Cross in Banda Aceh. The epidemiological profiles of diseases before and after the tsunami were compared. <e>Cholera</e>, tetanus, wounds and wound infections, acute respiratory infections, malaria, and dengue were included in this analysis. RESULTS: Certain diseases (e.g., cholera, malaria, dengue) are not always an immediate priority post-disaster. Rates of disaster-related health conditions requiring emergency response fell by half, and became negligible around four weeks after the precipitating events. Some conditions, such as aspiration pneumonia and tetanus, which normally are rare, require special preparedness for emergency personnel. In addition, resistant and rare pathogens are associated with disasters due to natural hazards in the tropics and require specialized knowledge for the rapid and successful treatment of related infections. CONCLUSIONS: Within the first four weeks of a disaster, international humanitarian agencies in the health sector should start working with the MOH. The WHO surveillance system established immediately after the tsunami offers lessons for developing a prototype for future emergencies. Guidelines for tetanus and aspiration pneumonia should be included in disaster medicine handbooks, and humanitarian aid groups should be prepared to provide emergency obstetrics and post-natal services. Relief funding after naturally occurring disasters should consider funding sustainability. Donors should know when to stop providing emergency relief funds and transition to recovery/development strategies.",M1
20300569,"Informal urban settlements and <e>cholera</e> risk in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.BACKGROUND: As a result of poor economic opportunities and an increasing shortage of affordable housing, much of the spatial growth in many of the world's fastest-growing cities is a result of the expansion of informal settlements where residents live without security of tenure and with limited access to basic infrastructure. Although inadequate water and sanitation facilities, crowding and other poor living conditions can have a significant impact on the spread of infectious diseases, analyses relating these diseases to ongoing global urbanization, especially at the neighborhood and household level in informal settlements, have been infrequent. To begin to address this deficiency, we analyzed urban environmental data and the burden of cholera in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Cholera incidence was examined in relation to the percentage of a ward's residents who were informal, the percentage of a ward's informal residents without an improved water source, the percentage of a ward's informal residents without improved sanitation, distance to the nearest cholera treatment facility, population density, median asset index score in informal areas, and presence or absence of major roads. We found that cholera incidence was most closely associated with informal housing, population density, and the income level of informal residents. Using data available in this study, our model would suggest nearly a one percent increase in cholera incidence for every percentage point increase in informal residents, approximately a two percent increase in cholera incidence for every increase in population density of 1000 people per km(2) in Dar es Salaam in 2006, and close to a fifty percent decrease in cholera incidence in wards where informal residents had minimally improved income levels, as measured by ownership of a radio or CD player on average, in comparison to wards where informal residents did not own any items about which they were asked. In this study, the range of access to improved sanitation and improved water sources was quite narrow at the ward level, limiting our ability to discern relationships between these variables and cholera incidence. Analysis at the individual household level for these variables would be of interest. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our results suggest that ongoing global urbanization coupled with urban poverty will be associated with increased risks for certain infectious diseases, such as cholera, underscoring the need for improved infrastructure and planning as the world's urban population continues to expand.",M1
20299504,"Multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis of Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor strains harbouring classical toxin B.Atypical Vibrio cholerae O1 strains - hybrid strains (strains that cannot be classified either as El Tor or classical biotype) and altered strains (El Tor biotype strains that produce classical <e>cholera</e> toxin) - are currently prevalent in Asia and Africa. A total of 74 hybrid and altered strains that harboured classical cholera toxin were investigated by multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis (MLVA). The results showed that the hybrid/altered strains could be categorized into three groups and that they were distant from the El Tor strain responsible for the seventh cholera pandemic. Hybrid/altered strains with a tandem repeat of the classical CTX prophage on the small chromosome were divided into two MLVA groups (group I: Mozambique/Bangladesh group; group III: Vietnam group), and altered strains with the RS1-CTX prophage containing the El Tor type rstR and classical ctxB on the large chromosome were placed in two MLVA groups (group II: India/Bangladesh group; group III: India/Vietnam group).",M1
20233893,"Diarrhoeal disease through enterocyte secretion: a doctrine untroubled by proof.For almost 40 years, one of the principal causes of diarrhoeal disease has been thought to be fluid secretion emanating from the epithelial cells of the small and large intestine. Given the extremely large fluid losses seen in <e>cholera</e>, where secretion can be up to several litres per day, this seems a plausible hypothesis. The enterocyte (epithelial cell) secretion hypothesis rapidly displaced all other alternatives, such as vasodilatation coupled with enhanced paracellular permeability. An essential mechanism underlying enterocyte secretion has always been assumed to be electrogenic chloride secretion, leading to a localized osmotic imbalance at the mucosal surface of the enterocytes that causes fluid entry into the lumen by osmosis. The chloride secretion basis for enterotoxin-deranged secretion is assumed to be measurable by changes in electrical currents and by altered transport of chloride ion. These can be detected after the small intestine is exposed to a heat-stable enterotoxin (STa) produced by Escherichia coli. However, in vivo, when the recovered volume technique is used, STa is found not to be secretory. The heat-stable enterotoxin is therefore a test case toxin, because the complex techniques used to demonstrate enterocyte secretion after STa exposure show apparent secretion, while the simplest technique based on fluid recovery and genuinely measuring the mass transport of fluid does not. This review scrutinizes the nature of the evidence put forward for enterocyte secretion and reaches the conclusion that there is no evidence for it. Debilitating secretion undoubtedly does take place in severe diarrhoeal disease, but secretion from enterocytes is unlikely to be the cause.",M1
20223896,"Emergence and genetic diversity of El Tor Vibrio cholerae O1 that possess classical biotype ctxB among travel-associated cases of <e>cholera</e> in Japan.Vibrio cholerae O1 are classified into two biotypes, classical and El Tor, each encoding a biotype-specific cholera toxin. However, El Tor strains have recently emerged with a classical cholera-toxin genotype (El Tor variant). We characterized El Tor strains of V. cholerae O1 from travel-associated cases of cholera in Japan isolated from 1991 to 2006 by cholera toxin B subunit gene (ctxB) typing and by molecular epidemiological methods. ctxB in the biotype El Tor shifted from the El Tor-specific type to the classical-specific type around 1993, and this type fully dominated the later half of the 1990s. Based on the results of PFGE and multilocus variable-number tandem repeat analysis, strains of the classical biotype remained diverse from those of El Tor biotype. The El Tor biotype strains formed multiple minor clusters and intermingled with each other irrespective of their origins and toxin types. El Tor variant strains are widespread in Asian countries and show significant genetic diversity, indicating that their spread is a result of multiclonal expansion rather than spread from a single clone.",M1
20218337,"[Role of galactose-specific receptor--lectin in bactericidal activity of hemolysin of Vibrio cholerae non O1/O139]AIM: To study the role lectin galactose-specific receptor of Vibrio cholerae hemolysin in receptor mechanisms of bacterial cells lysis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five strains of V. cholerae eltor ctx- Hly+ and 5 strains V. cholerae eltorctx+ Hly(-) isolated from patients and environment as well as 6 strains from Shigella genus, 3 strains of Escherichia coli, 2 strains of V. cholerae eltor, and 1 strain of V. cholerae non O1 were used in the study. Preparation P-11702 obtained from strain of V. cholerae non O1 was used for the study of bactericidal activity of hemolysin. For neutralization of bactericidal effect antihemolytic serum prepared against P-11702 as well as 1% solutions of carbohydrates (galactose, sucrose, glucose, and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine) were used. RESULTS: It was shown that lytic activity of hemolysin against <e>cholera</e> vibrios and indicator cultures for detection of vibriocins was neutralized by galactose as well as hemolysis of erythrocytes was neutralized by specific antihemolytic serum. Sucrose, glucose, and N-acetyl-D-galactosamine did not have effect on bactericidal and hemolytic activity of hemolysin. CONCLUSION: Protein-carbohydrate receptor binding of galactose-specific lectin has an important role in realization of bactericidal effect of V. cholerae hemolysin.",M1
20205935,"Spatial clustering in the spatio-temporal dynamics of endemic <e>cholera</e>.BACKGROUND: The spatio-temporal patterns of infectious diseases that are environmentally driven reflect the combined effects of transmission dynamics and environmental heterogeneity. They contain important information on different routes of transmission, including the role of environmental reservoirs. Consideration of the spatial component in infectious disease dynamics has led to insights on the propagation of fronts at the level of counties in rabies in the US, and the metapopulation behavior at the level of cities in childhood diseases such as measles in the UK, both at relatively coarse scales. As epidemiological data on individual infections become available, spatio-temporal patterns can be examined at higher resolutions. METHODS: The extensive spatio-temporal data set for cholera in Matlab, Bangladesh, maps the individual location of cases from 1983 to 2003. This unique record allows us to examine the spatial structure of cholera outbreaks, to address the role of primary transmission, occurring from an aquatic reservoir to the human host, and that of secondary transmission, involving a feedback between current and past levels of infection. We use Ripley's K and L indices and bootstrapping methods to evaluate the occurrence of spatial clustering in the cases during outbreaks using different temporal windows. The spatial location of cases was also confronted against the spatial location of water sources. RESULTS: Spatial clustering of cholera cases was detected at different temporal and spatial scales. Cases relative to water sources also exhibit spatial clustering. CONCLUSIONS: The clustering of cases supports an important role of secondary transmission in the dynamics of cholera epidemics in Matlab, Bangladesh. The spatial clustering of cases relative to water sources, and its timing, suggests an effective role of water reservoirs during the onset of cholera outbreaks. Once primary transmission has initiated an outbreak, secondary transmission takes over and plays a fundamental role in shaping the epidemics in this endemic area.",M1
20176796,"Concomitant enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli infection induces increased immune responses to Vibrio cholerae O1 antigens in patients with <e>cholera</e> in Bangladesh.Vibrio cholerae O1 and enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) are major bacterial pathogens that cause dehydrating disease requiring hospitalization of children and adults. The cholera toxin (CT) produced by V. cholerae O1 and the heat-labile toxin (LT) and/or heat-stable toxin (ST) of ETEC are responsible for secretory diarrhea. We have observed that about 13% of hospitalized diarrheal patients are concomitantly infected with V. cholerae O1 and ETEC. In order to understand the outcome of such dual infections on the clinical and immunological responses in cholera patients, we studied patients infected with V. cholerae O1 (group VC; n = 25), those infected with both V. cholerae O1 and ETEC (group VCET; n = 25), and those infected with ETEC only (group ET; n = 25). The VCET group showed more severe dehydration and had a higher intake of intravenous fluid and more vomiting than the ETEC group (P = 0.01 to 0.003). The VCET patients showed higher vibriocidal responses and increased antibody titers to cholera toxin and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) in plasma than did the V. cholerae O1 patients (P = 0.02 to &lt;0.001). All responses in the V. cholerae O1 and in the VCET groups were more robust than those seen in the group infected with ETEC only (P = 0.01 to &lt;0.001). We thus show that concomitant colonization with ETEC induces immune responses to V. cholerae antigens that are more robust than those seen with V. cholerae O1 infection alone. It is possible that LT or other factors expressed by ETEC may play a role as a mucosal adjuvant in enhancing the immune responses to V. cholerae O1.",M1
20175419,"Contamination of drinking water sources during the rainy season in an urban post-conflict community in Guinea Bissau: implications for sanitation priority.Since the 1998 civil warcholera outbreaks and waterborne infections have been a major cause of morbidity and mortality during the rainy season in Guinea Bidsau. Our survey aims at: (1) describing the distribution, characteristics and use of water sources and sewage facilities in a central area of the capital city of Bissau; (2) determining the microbiological quality of drinking water during the rainy season. After mapping of the Cuntum 3 study area, water sources' and latrines' location, characteristics and use were determined by visual inspection and interviews with householders. Microbiological analyses were peformed from water sources for evaluation of total Coliforms, E. coli, Enterococcus faecalis. Twelve water sources (9 wells, 3 taps) and 15 latrines were identified and used by 444 inhabitants. Water sources and latrines were at less than 5 meters distance apart. Wells were self-built, hand-dug, shallow (4-6 meters), unprotected. Taps were located outdoor. Latrines were self-built, open air, unprotected. None of the houses had a bathroom. Maintenance of wells, taps and latrines is not performed on regular basis and well's handling habits are not safe. Well and tap water showed heavy faecal contamination with more than 1000 CFU/100 ml. The contamination of drinking water in Bissau due to poor construction, maintenance and improperuse ten years after the civil war, demonstrates the need to allocate resources after conflicts in the area of water and sanitation. Both should be included as a priority in post-conflict reconstruction programs in order to reduce <e>cholera</e> outbreaks and diarrhoea related mortality.",M1
20135270,"Prevalence of <e>cholera</e> in pediatric patients with acute dehydrating diarrhea.OBJECTIVE: To estimate the prevalence of culture-confirmed cholera in patients with acute dehydrating diarrhea, at a tertiary care center in north India, during a 6-month period from March to August, 2006. METHODS: We studied 145 children, who presented to the pediatric emergency services of a tertiary care teaching hospital in north India with acute dehydrating diarrhea. Each patient had his/her stool sample collected for Vibrio cholerae culture and hanging drop preparation for darting motility. The stool specimen for hanging drop analysis was immediately transported to the emergency laboratory, where a trained technician prepared the slides and examined them for darting motility characteristic of Vibrio cholerae. RESULTS: V. cholerae was isolated in 36 (24.8%) patients. Forty-nine (33.7%) patients had a positive hanging drop examination. Hanging drop examination had a sensitivity and specificity of 85.8% and 81.7%, respectively. Severe dehydration (OR 4.3; P&lt;0.01) and hanging drop positivity (OR 12.42; P&lt;0.001) were associated with higher odds of cholera after adjustment for other risk factors. CONCLUSION: Cholera is an important cause of acute watery diarrhea in pediatric patients in urban north India and should be ruled out in all children presenting with acute dehydrating diarrhea, particularly those with severe dehydration. Hanging drop test is useful for diagnosis in the emergency setting.",M1

20099756,"Familial aggregation of Vibrio cholerae-associated infection in Matlab, Bangladesh.Vibrio cholerae is a major cause of diarrhoeal illness in endemic regions, such as Bangladesh. Understanding the factors that determine an individual's susceptibility to infection due to V. cholerae may lead to improved prevention and control strategies. Increasing evidence suggests that human genetic factors affect the severity of V. cholerae-associated infection. This study, therefore, sought to characterize the heritable component of susceptibility to infection due to V. cholerae using the Matlab Health and Demographic Surveillance System database of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh. In total, 144 pedigrees that included a <e>cholera</e> patient and 341 pedigrees without a cholera patient were evaluated during 1 January-31 December 1992. The odds of the sibling of a patient being admitted with cholera were 7.67 times the odds of the sibling of an unaffected individual being admitted with cholera [95% confidence interval (CI) 2.40-24.5, p &lt; 0.001], after adjustment for gender, age, socioeconomic status, and hygiene practices. Although exposure to environmental reservoirs is essential in the epidemiology of cholera, household-specific factors, such as familial relatedness to an index case, may also be important determinants of risk of cholera. Further analysis of human genetic factors that contribute to susceptibility to cholera may be productive.",M1
20095434,"[Role of <e>cholera</e> toxin-induced apoptosis in alteration of macrophages in mice]AIM: To study the role of active programmed cell death induced by Vibrio cholerae antigens in alteration of peritoneal macrophages of experimental animals. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Apoptosis was assessed by cytofluorometric analysis with propidium iodide using cytofluorometer  Coulter  as well as on characteristic morphological changes of cells in stained histological preparations. RESULTS: Performed experiments carried out by both methods provide evidence that V. cholerae and its antigens (cholera toxin, neuraminidase, chitinase, and lypopolysaccharide) cause apoptosis of mice peritoneal macrophages, which leads to their alteration. CONCLUSION: Our results demonstrate that programmed cell death of phagocytes is one of the causes of cytotoxic effect of V.cholerae and its antigens. Performed experiments show the role of apoptosis of macrophages in formation of postimmunization immunosuppression after vaccination against cholera.",M1
20080633,"Quorum-regulated biofilms enhance the development of conditionally viable, environmental Vibrio cholerae.The factors that enhance the waterborne spread of bacterial epidemics and sustain the pathogens in nature are unclear. The epidemic diarrheal disease <e>cholera</e> caused by Vibrio cholerae spreads through water contaminated with the pathogen. However, the bacteria exist in water mostly as clumps of cells, which resist cultivation by standard techniques but revive into fully virulent form in the intestinal milieu. These conditionally viable environmental cells (CVEC), alternatively called viable but nonculturable cells, presumably play a crucial role in cholera epidemiology. However, the precise mechanism causing the transition of V. cholerae to the CVEC form and this form's significance in the biology of the pathogen are unknown. Here we show that this process involves biofilm formation that is dependent on quorum sensing, a regulatory response that is controlled by cell density. V. cholerae strains carrying mutations in genes required for quorum sensing and biofilm formation displayed altered CVEC formation in environmental water following intestinal infections. Analysis of naturally occurring V. cholerae CVEC showed that organisms that adopt this quiescent physiological state typically exist as clumps of cells that comprise a single clone closely related to isolates causing the most recent local cholera epidemic. These results support a model of cholera transmission in which in vivo-formed biofilms convert to CVEC upon the introduction of cholera stools into environmental water. Our data further suggest that a temporary loss of quorum sensing due to dilution of extracellular autoinducers confers a selective advantage to communities of V. cholerae by blocking quorum-mediated regulatory responses that would break down biofilms and thus interfere with CVEC formation.",M1
20074356,"Local population and regional environmental drivers of <e>cholera</e> in Bangladesh.BACKGROUND: Regional environmental factors have been shown to be related to cholera. Previous work in Bangladesh found that temporal patterns of cholera are positively related to satellite-derived environmental variables including ocean chlorophyll concentration (OCC). METHODS: This paper investigates whether local socio-economic status (SES) modifies the effect of regional environmental forces. The study area is Matlab, Bangladesh, an area of approximately 200,000 people with an active health and demographic surveillance system. Study data include (1) spatially-referenced demographic and socio-economic characteristics of the population; (2) satellite-derived variables for sea surface temperature (SST), sea surface height (SSH), and OCC; and (3) laboratory confirmed cholera case data for the entire population. Relationships between cholera, the environmental variables, and SES are measured using generalized estimating equations with a logit link function. Additionally two separate seasonal models are built because there are two annual cholera epidemics, one pre-monsoon, and one post-monsoon. RESULTS: SES has a significant impact on cholera occurrence: the higher the SES score, the lower the occurrence of cholera. There is a significant negative association between cholera incidence and SSH during the pre-monsoon period but not for the post-monsoon period. OCC is positively associated with cholera during the pre-monsoon period but not for the post-monsoon period. SST is not related to cholera incidence. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, it appears cholera is influenced by regional environmental variables during the pre-monsoon period and by local-level variables (e.g., water and sanitation) during the post-monsoon period. In both pre- and post-monsoon seasons, SES significantly influences these patterns, likely because it is a proxy for poor water quality and sanitation in poorer households.",M1
20040104,"Molecular characterisation of Vibrio cholerae O1 strains carrying an SXT/R391-like element from <e>cholera</e> outbreaks in Kenya: 1994-2007.BACKGROUND: Over the last decade, cholera outbreaks in parts of Kenya have become common. Although a number of recent studies describe the epidemiology of cholera in Kenya, there is paucity of information concerning the diversity and occurrence of mobile genetic elements in Vibrio cholerae strains implicated in these outbreaks. A total of 65 Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor serotype Inaba isolated between 1994 and 2007 from various outbreaks in Kenya were investigated for mobile genetic elements including integrons, transposons, the integrating conjugative elements (ICEs), conjugative plasmids and for their genotypic relatedness. RESULTS: All the strains were haemolytic on 5% sheep blood and positive for the Vibrio cholerae El Tor-specific haemolysin toxin gene (hylA) by PCR. They all contained strB, sulII, floR and the dfrA1 genes encoding resistance to streptomycin, sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim respectively. These genes, together with an ICE belonging to the SXT/R391 family were transferable to the rifampicin-resistant E. coli C600 en bloc. All the strains were negative for integron class 1, 2 and 3 and for transposase gene of transposon Tn7 but were positive for integron class 4 and the trpM gene of transposon Tn21. No plasmids were isolated from any of the 65 strains. All the strains were also positive for all V. cholera El Tor pathogenic genes except the NAG- specific heat-stable toxin (st) gene. None of the strains were positive for virulence genes associated with the V. cholerae classical biotype. All the strains were positive for El Tor-specific CTXphi bacteriophage rstrR repressor gene (CTXETPhi) but negative for the Classical, Calcutta, and the Environmental repressor types. Pulse Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) showed that regardless of the year of isolation, all the strains bearing the SXT element were clonally related. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that the V. cholerae O1 strains carrying an SXT/R391-like element implicated in recent cholera outbreaks in Kenya has not changed significantly between 1994 and 2007 and are clonally related.",M1
20030720,"Genetic analysis of CTX prophages with special reference to ctxB and rstR alleles of Vibrio cholerae O139 strains isolated from Kolkata over a decade.Chronological analysis of 125 Vibrio cholerae O139 strains isolated during 1993-2005 in Kolkata revealed the prevalence of two new genotypes of <e>cholera</e> toxin (CT) and novel combinations of ctxB and rstR alleles resulting in variant CTX prophages. One of the new genotypes of ctxB, which first appeared in 1996 with the re-emerged V. cholerae O139 strains that had CTX Calcutta phage, was designated as genotype 4. In 1998, another new genotype, designated as genotype 5, was detected that prevailed mostly in CTX phages with El Tor rstR. The prototype El Tor CTX phage with genotype 3 gradually disappeared in O139, and since 2002 the predominant CTX prophages in O139 are Calcutta phages with genotype 4 and El Tor phages with genotype 5. Results showed that V. cholerae O139 strains of Kolkata, isolated over a decade, harboured CTX prophages in the large chromosome having no RS1 downstream of CTX prophage. During the course of its intermittent incidence over a decade, five types of O139 strains were detected based on CT genotypes. Such abrupt genetic changes in O139 strains might not favour its continued prevalence in human cases in Kolkata, India.",M1

20023099,"Mechanisms involved in governing adherence of Vibrio cholerae to granular starch.Vibrio cholerae has been shown to adhere to cornstarch granules. The present work explored the mechanisms involved in this adhesion and the possibility of its occurrence in vivo. The findings suggest that both specific and nonspecific interactions are involved in the adhesion. Nonspecific hydrophobic interactions may play a role, since both V. cholerae and cornstarch granules exhibited hydrophobic properties when they were tested using a xylene-water system. In addition, the presence of bile acids reduced the adhesion. The adhesion also involves some specific carbohydrate-binding moieties on the cell surface, as reflected by reduced adhesion following pretreatment of the bacteria with proteinase K and sodium m-periodate. Further investigations supported these observations and showed that media containing low-molecular-weight carbohydrates had a significant inhibitory effect. Binding cell lysate to starch granules and removing the adhered proteins using either glucose or bile acids led to identification (by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis) of several candidate V. cholerae outer membrane-associated starch-binding proteins. Different sets of proteins were isolated by removal in a glucose solution or bile acids. When the upper gastrointestinal tract conditions were simulated in vitro, both bile salts and the amylolytic activity of the pancreatic juices were found to have an inhibitory effect on the adherence of V. cholerae to starch. However, during acute diarrhea, this inhibitory effect may be significantly reduced due to dilution, suggesting that adhesion does occur in vivo. Such adhesion may contribute to the beneficial effects observed following administration of granular starch-based oral rehydration solutions to <e>cholera</e> patients.",M1

In this study we demonstrate that when strains of the El Tor and classical biotypes were cocultured in standard LB medium, the El Tor strains clearly had a competitive growth advantage over the classical biotype starting from the late stationary phase and could eventually take over the population. The classical biotype produces extracellular protease(s) in the stationary phase, and the amounts of amino acids and small peptides in the late stationary and death phase culture filtrates of the classical biotype were higher than those in the corresponding culture filtrates of the El Tor biotype. The El Tor biotype cells could utilize the amino acids more efficiently than the classical biotype under the alkaline pH of the stationary phase cultures but not in medium buffered to neutral pH. The growth advantage of the El Tor biotype was also observed in vivo using the ligated rabbit ileal loop and infant mouse animal models.",M1

In recent years, new pathogenic variants of V. cholerae have emerged and spread throughout many Asian and African countries. These variants display a mixture of phenotypic and genotypic traits from the two main biotypes (known as 'classical' and 'El Tor'), suggesting that they are genetic hybrids. Classical and El Tor biotypes have been the most epidemiologically successful cholera strains during the past century, and it is believed that the new variants (which we call here 'atypical El Tor') are likely to develop successfully in a manner similar to these biotypes.

Thirteen of these cases were hospitalized. A matched case-control study was conducted to identify the possible exposure variables. Since all wells were heavily chlorinated immediately after the outbreak, water samples were not tested. The cases were managed symptomatically. Descriptive epidemiology suggested clustering of cases around one public well. Vibrio cholerae El Tor O1, serotype Ogawa was isolated from four of six rectal swabs. The water from the public well was associated with the outbreak (matched odds ratio: 12; 95% confidence interval 1.2-44.1). On the basis of these conclusions, access to the well was barred immediately, and it was protected. This investigation highlighted the broader use of field epidemiology methods to implement public-health actions guided by epidemiologic data to control a cholera epidemic.",M1

We compared clinical and immunological features in patients in Bangladesh infected with these 2 serotypes. Blood was collected from hospitalized Ogawa (N=146) or Inaba (N=191) patients at the acute stage (day 2) and 5 and 19 days later. Ogawa patients were younger than Inaba, presented with shorter duration of diarrhoea, and had more frequent abdominal pain, vomiting and need for intravenous fluids (p&lt;0.05). Inaba patients more frequently had dark-field positive stools (p&lt;0.01). Inaba strains were more susceptible to tetracycline and erythromycin than Ogawa strains (p&lt;0.001). Ogawa infection produced higher plasma vibriocidal as well as IgG responses to cholera toxin B subunit, toxin-coregulated pilus subunit and lipopolysaccharide (LPS); higher IgA responses to LPS in 'antibody in lymphocyte supernatant' (ALS) specimens were also seen. These results suggest that a cholera vaccine based on the Ogawa serotype needs to be further investigated.",M1

AIM: This work aims to describe the characteristics of the cholera epidemics which occurred in Mali between 1995 and 2004. METHOD: A retrospective survey was conducted within the Division of the fight against the diseases of epidemic potential and the Institute of Public Health and Research of the Ministry of Health of Mali. Individual medical records tracking the follow-up of patients as well as the registers of these structures were used as sources to collect data for the study. RESULTS: There were 12,176 cases of cholera recorded, including 1,406 deaths, from 1995 to 2004. Cholera outbreaks in Mali have been a regular occurrence every year since 2001. The regions of Mopti and Segou seem to be the most impacted by these epidemics. The lethal rates were higher than 1% at the time of each of these epidemics during this period. Vibrio cholerae O: 1, biotype El Tor were responsible for the epidemics, and the serotype Ogawa was prevalent. CONCLUSION: Cholera epidemics have been constant in Mali since the beginning of the 21st century in spite of the efforts which have been made to prevent and control them. A rigorous analysis of the factors which support this persistence and appropriate measures are essential to reverse cholera in this country.",M1
19858575,"Household fish preparation hygiene and <e>cholera</e> transmission in Monrovia, Liberia.BACKGROUND: In the 1980s Vibrio cholerae was found to be an autochthonous resident of aquatic environments. As result, ingestion of undercooked, contaminated fish has been associated with cholera transmission. An alternative mechanism of transmission associated with fish was hypothesised by Schürmann et al. in 2002. He described a cholera case that was more likely to have been infected by contamination on the patient's hands rather than by ingestion of contaminated fish. METHODOLOGY: With fish being the main diet in Liberia, we decided to examine fish samples and preparation techniques in Monrovia. Excreta of 15 fish, caught in the estuarine waters of Monrovia, were analysed for V. cholerae. In addition, fish preparation methods were observed in 30 households. RESULTS: Two fish samples were found positive. Observations revealed that hygiene measures during the gutting process of fish were limited; although hands were usually rinsed, in all cases soap was not used. Furthermore, contaminated water was frequently reused during food preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Since the cooking process of fish (and thus elimination of bacteria) in Monrovia usually consists of both frying and boiling, it seems plausible that in this context, the hypothesis by Schürmann et al. could be applicable. Further research is necessary to confirm this association, which could be a starting point for more context-specific health education campaigns addressing food preparation hygiene as risk factor for cholera.",M1

Development of memory B cells of the immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA isotypes to V. cholerae O1 antigens, including serotype-specific lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and the B subunit of <e>cholera</e> toxin (CTB), after cholera infection has been demonstrated. Memory B cells of the IgM isotype may play a role in long-term protection, particularly against T-cell-independent antigens, but IgM memory has not been studied in V. cholerae O1 infection. Therefore, we assayed acute- and convalescent-phase blood samples from cholera patients for the presence of memory B cells that produce cholera antigen-specific IgM antibody upon polyclonal stimulation in in vitro culture. We also examined the development of serological and antibody-secreting cell responses following infection. Subjects developed significant IgM memory responses by day 30 after infection, both to the T-cell-independent antigen LPS and to the T-cell-dependent antigen CTB. No significant corresponding elevations in plasma IgM antibodies or circulating IgM antibody-secreting cells to CTB were detected. In 17 subjects followed to day 90 after infection, significant persistence of elevated IgM memory responses was not observed. The IgM memory response to CTB was negatively correlated with the IgG plasma antibody response to CTB, and there was a trend toward negative correlation between the IgM memory and IgA plasma antibody responses to LPS. We did not observe an association between the IgM memory response to LPS and the vibriocidal titer.",M1
19855842,"Massive fluid requirements and an unusual BUN/creatinine ratio for pre-renal failure in patients with <e>cholera</e>.BACKGROUND: Cholera is an important infectious cause of secretory diarrhea. The primary symptom of infection is the sudden onset of watery diarrhea with subsequent volume depletion causing renal insufficiency. The objective of this research is to study the level of dehydration at presentation and subsequent fluid management in patients with cholera. METHODS: This study was conducted on 191 patients of Cholera admitted at a tertiary care hospital in Karachi, Pakistan during the period of 5 years. Medical charts were evaluated retrospectively for initial hydration status, baseline lab investigations on admission and discharge and fluid therapy given to all the patients while their stay in the hospital and the data was analyzed on SPSS 15.0. RESULTS: Out of the 191 patients, 83(43%) were males and 108 (57%) were females with mean age of 42.3 years (SD+/-18.34). The average duration of symptoms was 3.75 days (SD+/-2.04). Of 191 patients, 175 (92.1%) presented with dehydration, 80 (42.3%) were given Ringer's Lactate (R/L) + Normal Saline (N/S), 45 (24%) patients were given R/L + N/S + Oral Rehydration Therapy (ORS), 27 (14.3%) of the patients were kept on R/L only and remaining were given various combinations of R/L, N/S, ORS and Dextrose Saline (D/S). On admission mean Blood Urea Nitrogen (BUN) was 24.54 (SD+/-16.6), mean creatinine was 2.47 (SD+/-2.35) and mean BUN/Creatinine ratio was 11.63 (SD+/-5.7).

The objective of this study was to examine the incidence of V. cholerae infection and associated clinical symptoms in household contacts of patients with cholera and to identify risk factors for development of severe dehydration in this cohort. METHODS: Household contacts of hospitalized patients with cholera were observed with frequent clinical assessments and collection of serum and rectal swab samples for culture for a period of 21 days after presentation of the index case. RESULTS: One-half (460 of 944) of all contacts reported diarrhea during the study period, and symptoms most frequently began 2 days after presentation of the index case. Antibiotics were used by 199 (43%) of 460 contacts with diarrhea. Results of rectal swab cultures for V. cholerae were positive for 202 (21%) of 944 contacts, and 148 (73%) infected contacts experienced diarrhea. Significant dehydration developed in 26 contacts; predictors of dehydration included vomiting, each additional day of diarrhea, and blood group O status. CONCLUSIONS: In urban Bangladesh, the burden of diarrheal illness among household contacts of patients with cholera is higher than was previously estimated, and prophylactic intervention is feasible, because the majority of symptomatic cases of V. cholerae infection in contacts begin soon after presentation of the index case. Re-evaluation of targeted chemoprophylaxis for household contacts of patients with cholera may be warranted.",M1

One hundred and twenty five years of study of V. cholerae microbiology have made this lethal pathogen arguably the most well-understood non-invasive mucosal pathogen. Over the past 25 years, modern molecular techniques have permitted the identification of many genes and cellular processes that are critical for V. cholerae colonization of the gastrointestinal tract. Review of the literature reveals that there are two classes of genes that influence V. cholerae colonization of the suckling mouse intestine, the most commonly used animal model to study V. cholerae pathogenesis. Inactivation of one class of genes results in profound attenuation of V. cholerae intestinal colonization, whereas inactivation of the other class of genes results in only moderate colonization defects. The latter class of genes suggests that V. cholerae may colonize several intestinal niches that impose distinct requirements and biological challenges, thus raising the possibility that there is physiologic heterogeneity among the infecting population. Efficient V. cholerae intestinal colonization and subsequent dissemination to the environment appears to require temporally ordered expression of sets of genes during the course of infection. Key challenges for future investigations of V. cholerae pathogenicity will be to assess the degree of heterogeneity in the infecting population, whether such heterogeneity has functional significance, and if stochastic processes contribute to generation of heterogeneity in vivo.",M1

We have previously demonstrated that control of glycopolypeptide backbone extension and ligand spacing significantly impacts the inhibition of the cholera toxin B subunit pentamer (CT B(5)) by these polymers. In the studies reported here, we elucidate the role of backbone charge and linker length in modulating the inhibition event. Peptides of the sequence AXPXG (where X is a positive, neutral or negative amino acid), equipped with the alkyne functionality of propargyl glycine, were designed and synthesized via solid-phase peptide synthetic methods and glycosylated via Cu(I)-catalyzed alkyne-azide cycloaddition reactions. The capacity of the glycopeptides to inhibit the binding of the B(5) subunit of cholera toxin was evaluated. These studies indicated that glycopeptides with a negatively charged backbone show improved inhibition of the binding event relative to the other glycopeptides. In addition, variations in the length of the linker between the peptide and the saccharide ligand also affected the inhibition of CT by the glycopeptides. Our findings suggest that, apart from appropriate saccharide spacing and polypeptide chain extension, saccharide linker conformation and the systematic placement of charges on the polypeptide backbone are also significant variables that can be tuned to improve the inhibitory potencies of glycopolypeptide-based multivalent inhibitors.",M1

A quadruplex real-time PCR assay targeting four genes, the <e>cholera</e> toxin gene (ctxA), the hemolysin gene (hlyA), O1-specific rfb, and O139-specific rfb, was developed for detection and differentiation of O1, O139, and non-O1, non-O139 strains and for prediction of their toxigenic potential. The specificity of the assay was 100% when tested against 70 strains of V. cholerae and 31 strains of non-V. cholerae organisms. The analytical sensitivity for detection of toxigenic V. cholerae O1 and O139 was 2 CFU per reaction with cells from pure culture. When the assay was tested with inoculated water from bullfrog feeding ponds, 10 CFU/ml could reliably be detected after culture for 3 h. The assay was more sensitive than the immunochromatographic assay and culture method when tested against 89 bullfrog samples and 68 water samples from bullfrog feeding ponds. The applicability of this assay was confirmed in a case study involving 15 bullfrog samples, from which two mixtures of nontoxigenic O1 and toxigenic non-O1/non-O139 strains were detected and differentiated. These data indicate that the quadruplex real-time PCR assay can both rapidly and accurately detect/identify V. cholerae and reliably predict the toxigenic potential of strains detected.",M1

While the disease no longer poses a menace to countries with minimum standards of hygiene, it remains a serious challenge to countries where access to safe drinking water and adequate sanitation cannot be guaranteed. The objective of this work was to analyse the results obtained when contrasting the reports of the World Health Organization (WHO) about cholera disease with those of the World Bank List of economies (countries). METHODOLOGY: Data were obtained from reports of two international organizations, the report on cholera disease incidence of the World Health Organization and the World Bank's classification of countries attending to their income. RESULTS: We determined that low-income countries are more affected by cholera disease than countries with middle or high income. This difference was reflected in the percent of countries, the total number of reported cases, the number of cases per 100,000 habitants, as well as in the reported mortality. These results support the phrase  cholera disease is a disease of poverty.

Correlations between monthly cholera incidences and amount of precipitation were examined. The distribution pattern of the disease was analyzed by a kriging spatial analysis method. We analyzed cholera case distribution and spatiotemporal cluster by using 2590 cholera cases traced with a global positioning system in the 2005-2006 season. The association between drainage networks and cholera cases was analyzed with regression analysis. RESULTS: Increased precipitation was associated with the occurrence of cholera outbreaks, and insufficient drainage networks were statistically associated with cholera incidences.

This epidemic has been the least studied because it barely affected Pamplona, the largest urban area in the province. But the situation was critical in other zones close to the River Ebro (the Ribera area). BACKGROUND: In 1886, the  Regional-Medical Congress of Navarre , held in Tafalla (Navarre), studied the latest cholera epidemic in the region. An analysis of this scientific meeting is of interest because of the data it offers on the physicians' reactions to the development of microbiology and public hygiene, shortly after Robert Koch had isolated the comma-shaped cholera bacillus in 1883 ( Bacillus virgula ), and the controversy over the distribution of the vaccine by Jaime Ferrán y Clúa, in 1885. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Analysis of the conference reports presented at the  Regional-Medical Congress . CONCLUSIONS: This scientific medical gathering in Tafalla was innovative for Navarre. The transfer of ideas from international conferences on the cholera epidemic can be seen. The development of the Conference was influenced by medical celebrities like Nicasio Landa and Antonio Espina y Capo. We can also observe differences in the physicians' ideas. At the time there was no paradigm on microbiology in the world of science.

The implication of switch in terms of function of the toxin and its impact on human disease is unclear. How this change has influenced their prevalence relative to that of V. cholerae O1 in human infection is also not clear. The other common virulence gene clusters including the Vibrio pathogenicity island-1, Vibrio seventh pandemic island (VSP)-I and VSP-II of V. cholerae O139 did not show any remarkable difference from that of the O1 El Tor strains.

We defined a case of diarrhea as occurrence of &gt; or =3 loose/watery stools a day among the residents of Garulia since April 2006. We searched for cases of diarrhea in health care facilities and health camp. We conducted a gender- and age-matched case-control study to identify risk factors. We inspected the sanitation and water supply system. We collected rectal swabs from diarrhea patients and water specimens from the affected areas for laboratory investigation. Two hundred and ninety-eight cases of diarrhea were reported to various health care facilities (attack rate: 3.5/1000, no deaths). The attack rate was highest among children (6.4/1000). Vibrio cholerae El Tor O1 Inaba was isolated from two of 7 rectal swabs. The outbreak started on 10 April 2006, peaked on 26 April and lasted till 6 May. Cases clustered in an area distal to leaking water pipelines. Drinking municipal water exclusively was significantly associated with the illness (OR 13, 95% CI=6.5-27). Eight of the 12 water specimens from the affected area had fecal contamination and poor chlorine content. This outbreak was due to a contaminated municipal piped water supply and V. cholera 01 Inaba was possibly the causative organism.",M1

V. cholerae O1 isolated from these patients was found to be El Tor in its phenotype, but its cholera toxin (CT) was determined to be that of classical biotype. Whether the observed higher proportion of severe dehydration produced by the El Tor biotype was due to a shift from El Tor to classical CT or due to other factors is not clear. However, if cholera due to strains with increased severity spread to other areas where treatment facilities are limited, there are likely to be many more cholera deaths.",M1

This retrospective study was undertaken over a period of nine years (January 1999-December 2007) from a tertiary care hospital in north India to understand the changing epidemiology aspects and antibiotic resistance patterns in Vibrio cholerae isolates. METHODS: A total of 277 isolates of V. cholerae were included in the study. V. cholerae was identified by standard microbiological procedures. Antibiotic sensitivity testing was performed by disc diffusion method and isolates phage typed. RESULTS: All the isolates were identified as V. cholerae O1 biotype El Tor serotype Ogawa; phage 27 was the predominant type. Men were more commonly affected with maximum number in the age group 0-5 yr. Majority of the isolates were resistant to furazolidone but sensitive to gentamicin and cefotaxime. Resistance pattern to amoxycillin was variable. Three isolates were found to be resistant to ciprofloxacin. All the patients presented during June-October coinciding with the monsoon season and a majority were from suburbs. INTERPRETATION &amp; CONCLUSION: The emergence of resistance amongst V. cholerae especially towards ciprofloxacin may significantly influence the control strategies in future outbreaks. Phage 27 remained the predominant type in all the years. Continuous surveillance with regard to drug resistance, early detection and a strong regional commitment may help contain the disease.",M1
19650770,"Differential expression of enteric neuroimmune-network in invasive and acute watery diarrhoea.We aimed to evaluate the changes of nerve morphology and distribution of neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in the rectum of Shigella flexneri-infected patients and in the duodenum of Vibrio cholerae O1-infected patients. Nerve morphology was observed by transmission electron microscopy. Immunoreactivity of nerve growth factor (NGF), neurotransmitters and neuropeptides in tissues were studied by immunohistochemistry. Ultrastructural analysis of intestinal biopsy revealed persisting axons degeneration throughout the study period in all patients. Regeneration was already evident at the acute stage with marked increase at late convalescence. Both acute shigellosis and <e>cholera</e> were accompanied by increased expression of NGF and histamine and decreased expression of serotonin that was restored at convalescence. Immunoreactivity of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) was increased during acute cholera, whereas in shigellosis VIP- and substance P-immunoreactive nerves appeared at early convalescence. Both shigellosis and cholera induced long-lasting degeneration of enteric neuronal axons, despite the presence of ongoing proliferation and regeneration processes. Neurotransmitters and neuropeptides may play differential roles in invasive and watery diarrhoea.",M1

The purpose of this study was to describe and analyze these outbreaks as a basis for prevention and control. A total of 29556 cases were reported during the 18-month epidemic. The attack rate ranged from 0.6 to 100 per 10(4) inhabitants depending on region. The epidemic unfolded in three phases. The first phase (11 weeks) was promptly contained using basic control measures such as public information campaigns and environmental hygiene. The second and longest phase (12 months) was marked by two outbreaks caused by massive religious gatherings and severe flooding. Cities particularly the capital Dakar (25.5% of cases) and the religious district of Touba in the north (41.1% of cases) were most affected due to the many social and environmental problems related to poor urban infrastructure. The isolated strains of Vibrio cholerae O1, biotype El Tor, were susceptible to doxycycline and fluoroquinolones (100%) but resistant to cotrimoxazole (90.3%). The overall death rate was 1.38%. Unfavorable prognostic factors included age over 60 years, delayed treatment and severe dehydration at the time of admission. Despite lower mortality this cholera epidemic was more widespread and longer than the previous outbreaks in Senegal and was associated with a trend to endemicity in urban areas.",M1

METHODS: Whole stool was collected from patients presenting to a hospital cholera ward during a 2008 epidemic in Guinea-Bissau. The VC test on stool samples was conducted on-site; samples were subsequently stored in Cary-Blair transport media and sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for diagnostic testing by culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR). In addition, four local laboratory technicians who were unfamiliar with the test were provided with stool samples, the VC test kit, and simple written instructions and asked to perform the test and interpret results. RESULTS: A total of 101 stool specimens were collected and tested. Compared with PCR, the test was 97% sensitive and 71-76% specific. Laboratory technicians in Bissau performed the test and interpreted results correctly using only simple written instructions. CONCLUSIONS: The VC test may be useful for cholera diagnosis in outbreak situations where laboratory capacity is limited.",M1
19605400,"On spatially explicit models of <e>cholera</e> epidemics.We generalize a recently proposed model for cholera epidemics that accounts for local communities of susceptibles and infectives in a spatially explicit arrangement of nodes linked by networks having different topologies. The vehicle of infection (Vibrio cholerae) is transported through the network links that are thought of as hydrological connections among susceptible communities. The mathematical tools used are borrowed from general schemes of reactive transport on river networks acting as the environmental matrix for the circulation and mixing of waterborne pathogens. Using the diffusion approximation, we analytically derive the speed of propagation for travelling fronts of epidemics on regular lattices (either one-dimensional or two-dimensional) endowed with uniform population density. Power laws are found that relate the propagation speed to the diffusion coefficient and the basic reproduction number. We numerically obtain the related, slower speed of epidemic spreading for more complex, yet realistic river structures such as Peano networks and optimal channel networks. The analysis of the limit case of uniformly distributed population sizes proves instrumental in establishing the overall conditions for the relevance of spatially explicit models. To that extent, the ratio between spreading and disease outbreak time scales proves the crucial parameter. The relevance of our results lies in the major differences potentially arising between the predictions of spatially explicit models and traditional compartmental models of the susceptible-infected-recovered (SIR)-like type. Our results suggest that in many cases of real-life epidemiological interest, time scales of disease dynamics may trigger outbreaks that significantly depart from the predictions of compartmental models.",M1
19583033,"[Five years of <e>cholera</e> surveillance in Ivory Coast during social and political crisis, 2001 to 2005]For an efficient struggle against infectious diseases with epidemic potential, the Cdte d'Ivoire set up a precocious alert system in 2001 with a main objective: to detect epidemics of cholera, measles, yellow fever and meningitis and to provide necessary information for their control and their prevention. During the 2001 to 2005 period, the country was marked by military and political crisis which occurred in 2002; the country had to face up to a reappearance of cholera. How did it evolve in such a context? The question was to describe the performances of the system and the evolution of cholera from weekly data collected by the centers of epidemiological monitoring in health districts. The cases and declared deaths were compiled and the indicators of morbidity and mortality were then studied according to time site and individual features on the period of 2001 to 2005. From 2001 to 2005, 11,874 cases were notified with 564 deaths and a lethal rate of 4.7%. In 2001, from the initial source of infection, the civil jail, the epidemic of cholera disseminated itself through visitors in the whole city of Abidjan where 3250 cases were notified. Out of city, 20 outbreaks have been declared with a total of 3010 cases. The yearly highest impact, 37 living cases/100,000 inhabitants recorded in 2001, decreased regularly until 2005 with 0.2 living cases/100,000. After 2002, outbreaks were located mainly in the half south of the country which welcomed displaced populations from the north, preferably in transition or settling zones near the front line. The lethal rate in Abidjan (2.3%) was less important than that of other health districts (8.6%). The lethal rate globally increased as the impact decreased. Vibrio cholerae was responsible for the epidemics. The group of 15 years old and over was the most affected (12.69 living cases/100,000) whereas the highest lethal rate appeared in the group under 5 years old (6.6%). The reappearance and constant cholera epidemics in Côte d'Ivoire are due to bad general hygiene conditions, insufficient supply of drinking water from wells or packaged, concentration of populations in the south of the country due to war and uncontrolled development of the poor and unsanitary precarious boroughs. Outburst during the dry season is a warning signal of an important epidemic during the raining season especially in poor urban areas. The precocious alert system has permitted to detect the epidemics, to follow up their evolution and to orientate the struggle against cholera in Côte d'Ivoire.",M1

A simple and highly discriminating method for connecting clinical and environmental isolates of V. cholerae is needed in microbial forensics. Twelve different loci containing variable numbers of tandem-repeats (VNTRs) were evaluated in which six loci were polymorphic. Two multiplex reactions containing PCR primers targeting these six VNTRs resulted in successful DNA amplification of 142 various environmental and clinical V. cholerae isolates. The genetic distribution inside the V. cholerae strain collection was used to evaluate the discriminating power (Simpsons Diversity Index=0.99) of this new MLVA analysis, showing that the assay have a potential to differentiate between various strains, but also to identify those isolates which are collected from a common V. cholerae outbreak. This work has established a rapid and highly discriminating MLVA assay useful for track back analyses and/or forensic studies of V. cholerae infections.",M1

Diseases of interest included gastroenteritis, amoebic dysentery, typhoid fever and <e>cholera</e>. Water-borne disease occurrence was observed to follow a seasonal pattern with peaks occurring between the months of January and May followed by drops between June and October and rose again from November. Children below 5 years were found to be more vulnerable to diarrhoea, gastroenteritis, amoebic dysentery while persons between 15-44 years were more vulnerable to typhoid and cholera. Physico-chemically, water samples had turbidities varying between 5.5-86 NTU, pH values between 4.2 and 7.1 and zero residual chlorine. Bacteriological analysis showed that the total coliform count was averagely 74/100 ml, the faecal colform count was 43/100 ml and the faecal streptococci count was 27/100 ml. Lack of access to potable water, absence of sanitation facilities and environmental factors could be advanced as the probable causes of water-borne disease spread.",M1

Dominant periodic modes identified for cholera incidence were 11.0, 4.8, 3.5, 2.9, 1.6, 1.0 and 0.5 years. The majority of these modes, e.g. the 11.0-, 4.8-, 3.5-, 1.6- and 1.0-year modes, were essentially consistent with those obtained for the SST data (dominant modes: 5.1, 3.7, 2.5, 2.1, 1.5, 1.0 years) and the sunspot number data (dominant modes: 22.1, 11.1, 7.3, 4.8, 3.1 years). We confirmed that the variations of cholera incidence were synchronous with SSTs, and were inversely correlated to the sunspot numbers.

19528207,"Antigen-specific memory B-cell responses to Vibrio cholerae O1 infection in Bangladesh.<e>Cholera</e>, caused by Vibrio cholerae, is a noninvasive dehydrating enteric disease with a high mortality rate if untreated. Infection with V. cholerae elicits long-term protection against subsequent disease in countries where the disease is endemic. Although the mechanism of this protective immunity is unknown, it has been hypothesized that a protective mucosal response to V. cholerae infection may be mediated by anamnestic responses of memory B cells in the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. To characterize memory B-cell responses to cholera, we enrolled a cohort of 39 hospitalized patients with culture-confirmed cholera and evaluated their immunologic responses at frequent intervals over the subsequent 1 year. Memory B cells to cholera antigens, including lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the protein antigens cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and toxin-coregulated pilus major subunit A (TcpA) were enumerated using a method of polyclonal stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells followed by a standard enzyme-linked immunospot procedure. All patients demonstrated CTB, TcpA, and LPS-specific immunoglobulin G (IgG)and IgA memory responses by day 90. In addition, these memory B-cell responses persisted up to 1 year, substantially longer than other traditional immunologic markers of infection with V. cholerae. While the magnitude of the LPS-specific IgG memory B-cell response waned at 1 year, CTB- and TcpA-specific IgG memory B cells remained significantly elevated at 1 year after infection, suggesting that T-cell help may result in a more durable memory B-cell response to V. cholerae protein antigens. Such memory B cells could mediate anamnestic responses on reexposure to V. cholerae.",M1

This study used genotypic patterns of PCR-based detection of virulence-associated and regulatory protein genes, along with phage typing, to characterize 86 V. cholerae strains. Thirty-eight of 53 O1 biotype El Tor strains harboured both tcpA classical and tcpA El Tor genes, and three El Tor strains lacked the V. cholerae O1-specific gene (Vc-O1); three O139 strains contained both Vc-O1 and Vc-O139 genes and seven out of ten non-O1/non-O139 strains possessed the Vc-O1 gene. The latter strains all harboured the virulence-associated genes ctxA, zot, ace, RS1, hlyA, ompU, rtxA and sxt. Two phage types, T27 and T25, were predominant in strains from different geographical regions of India, whereas more variation in phage susceptibility was observed for tetracycline-resistant strains from Kolkata.

Their increased prevalence was the result of deteriorating sanitary and living conditions of the city population. The spread of epidemic infectious diseases was enhanced by marching troops, migration of civilians and war prisoners, return of large groups of displaced people and demobilized soldiers after regaining independence in November 1918. Additionally, unfavorable epidemiological situation in Lvov deteriorated at the time of the war with Ukrainians (November 1918-April 1919) and Bolsheviks (July-August 1920). The control of infectious diseases was in the hands of regional local physicians who referred patients to hospitals, isolated homes, bath and disinfection institutions, and conducted vaccinations against smallpox. A decrease in infectious diseases prevalence and deaths to the prewar levels occurred in 1922.",M1
19477477,"Effects of local climate variability on transmission dynamics of <e>cholera</e> in Matlab, Bangladesh.Cholera is considered as a model for climate-related infectious diseases. In Bangladesh, cholera epidemics occur during summer and winter seasons, but it is not known how climate variability influences the seasonality of cholera. Therefore, the variability pattern of cholera events was studied in relation to the variation in local climate variables in Matlab, Bangladesh. Classification and regression tree (CART) and principal component analysis (PCA) were used to study the dependency and variability pattern of monthly total cholera cases. An average temperature &lt;23.25 degrees C corresponded to the lowest average cholera occurrence (23 cases/month). At a temperature of &gt;or=23.25 degrees C and sunshine &lt;4.13h/day, the cholera occurrence was 39 cases/month. With increased sunshine (&gt;or=4.13h/day) and temperature (23.25-28.66 degrees C), the second highest cholera occurrence (44 cases/month) was observed. When the sunshine was &gt;or=4.13h/day and the temperature was &gt;28.66 degrees C, the highest cholera occurrence (54 cases/month) was observed. These results demonstrate that in summer and winter seasons in Bangladesh, temperature and sunshine hours compensate each other for higher cholera incidence.

19474207,"Differential modulation of NF-kappaB-mediated pro-inflammatory response in human intestinal epithelial cells by cheY homologues of Vibrio cholerae.Vibrio cholerae, the etiological agent of <e>cholera</e>, colonizes the small intestine, produces an enterotoxin and causes acute inflammatory response at intestinal epithelial surface. Chemotaxis and motility greatly influence the infectivity of V. cholerae although the role of chemotaxis genes in V. cholerae pathogenesis is less well understood. Four cheY genes are present in three clusters in the complete genome sequence of V. cholerae. A less motile and less adherent mutant was generated by inactivation of cheY-3 (O395Y3N) or cheY-4 (O395Y4N) whereas alterations in motility or adherence were not observed for cheY-1 (O395Y1N) or cheY-2 (O395Y2N) insertional mutants. In contrast to O395Y1N and O395Y2N, O395Y3N and O395Y4N showed reduced cholera toxin production compared to wild-type in vitro. Infection of the human intestinal epithelial cell line Int407 with O395Y3N and O395Y4N caused reduced secretion of interleukin (IL)-1a, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor (TNF-a) and monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) compared to wild-type and was associated with delayed activation of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) p65 and its co-activator cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). Further, the absence of nuclear translocation of NF-kappaB p50 subunit upon infection with O395Y3N or O395Y4N and its reversal upon complementation indicates the involvement of cheY-3 and cheY-4 in V. cholerae-induced pro-inflammatory response in the INT407 cell line.",M1

These conditions have been suspected to favour emergence and spread of cholera epidemics. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In order to assess the influence of these conditions on outbreaks, reports of cholera cases were collected weekly from each health district of North Kivu (4,667,699 inhabitants) and South Kivu (4,670,121 inhabitants) from 2000 through 2007. A geographic information system was established, and in each health district, the relationships between environmental variables and the number of cholera cases were assessed using regression techniques and time series analysis. We further checked for a link between complex emergencies and cholera outbreaks. Finally, we analysed data collected during an epidemiological survey that was implemented in Goma after Nyiragongo eruption. A total of 73,605 cases and 1,612 deaths of cholera were reported. Time series decomposition showed a greater number of cases during the rainy season in South Kivu but not in North Kivu. Spatial distribution of cholera cases exhibited a higher number of cases in health districts bordering lakes (Odds Ratio 7.0, Confidence Interval range 3.8-12.9). Four epidemic reactivations were observed in the 12-week periods following war events, but simulations indicate that the number of reactivations was not larger than that expected during any random selection of period with no war. Nyiragongo volcanic eruption was followed by a marked decrease of cholera incidence. CONCLUSION/SIGNIFICANCE: Our study points out the crucial role of some towns located in lakeside areas in the persistence of cholera in Kivu. Even if complex emergencies were not systematically followed by cholera epidemics, some of them enabled cholera spreading.",M1

Biochemical and serological characterization of the strains was performed by standardized procedures while virulence properties of NCVs were assayed by molecular, in vivo and in vitro toxicological methods. Of the 300 seafood samples examined, including mussel, cod, mackerel, anchovy, clam, prawn and cuttlefish, 5.6% were positive for NCVs: 4.7% and 8.5% from local and imported seafood, respectively. The prevalence of NCVs was highest in prawn (16.6%) and mussel (7.7%). Of 58 hospitalized patients that presented acute diarrhea, 3.4% eliminated NCVs in stools 24-48 h after consumption of seafood. All NCVs had ToxR and hlyAET genes but lacked ctxA, zot, and tcpA genes. One isolate from prawn had stn/sto gene. All strains were hemolytic, cytotoxic, and able to induce intestinal and extraintestinal effects on the suckling mouse model. Our results confirm that non-toxigenic NCVs that express the gene encoding El Tor-like hemolysin can be isolated from patients suffering a <e>cholera</e>-like syndrome after consumption of seafood. This evidence along with the virulence and enteropathogenicity of all the ctxA(-) tcpA(-) zot(-) stn/sto(-) hlyAET(+) NCV isolates in the experimental model, suggest that El Tor-like hemolysin may play an important role in human pathogenesis. Moreover, the isolates from seafood showed molecular, biological and enzymatic patterns similar to those isolated from clinical samples, underlining that environmental NCVs are potentially able to induce human infections and confirming the important role of seafood as a vehicle of V. cholerae diseases.",M1
19370638,"Polymer-based oral rehydration solution for treating acute watery diarrhoea.BACKGROUND: Acute diarrhoea is one of the principal causes of morbidity and mortality among children in low-income countries. Glucose-based ORS helps replace fluid and prevent further dehydration from acute diarrhoea. Since 2004, the World Health Organization has recommended the osmolarity &lt; 270 mOsm/L (ORS &lt;/= 270 ) over the &gt; 310 mOsm/L formulation (ORS &gt;/= 310). Glucose polymer-based ORS (eg prepared using rice or wheat) slowly releases glucose and may be superior. OBJECTIVES: To compare polymer-based ORS with glucose-based ORS for treating acute watery diarrhoea. SEARCH STRATEGY: In September 2008, we searched the Cochrane Infectious Diseases Group Specialized Register, CENTRAL (The Cochrane Library 2008, Issue 3), MEDLINE, EMBASE, LILACS, and mRCT. We also contacted researchers, organizations, and pharmaceutical companies, and searched reference lists. SELECTION CRITERIA: Randomized controlled trials of people with acute watery diarrhoea (<e>cholera</e> and non-cholera associated) comparing polymer-based and glucose-based ORS (with identical electrolyte contents). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two authors independently assessed the search results and risk of bias, and extracted data. In multiple treatment arms with two or more treatment groups, we combined outcomes as appropriate and compared collectively with the control group. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-four trials involving 4214 participants met the inclusion criteria: 27 in children, five in adults and two in both. Twelve trials used adequate methods to conceal allocation. Most compared polymer-based ORS with ORS &gt;/= 310. There were fewer unscheduled intravenous infusions in the polymer-based ORS group compared with glucose-based ORS (ORS &gt;/= 310 and &lt;/= 270 groups combined) (RR 0.75, 95% CI 0.59 to 0.95; 2235 participants, 19 trials). Adults positive for Vibrio cholerae had a shorter duration of diarrhoea with polymer-based ORS than with ORS &lt;/= 270 (MD -7.11 hours, SD -11.91 to -2.32; 228 participants, 4 trials). Wheat-based ORS resulted in lower total stool output in the first 24 hours compared with ORS &lt;/= 270 (MD -119.85 g/kg, SD -114.73 to -124.97; 129 participants, 2 trials).

19357634,"<e>Cholera</e> outbreak--southern Sudan, 2007.Vibrio cholerae causes cholera, an acute infectious diarrheal disease that can result in death without appropriate therapy, depending on the severity of the disease. War, poverty, inadequate sanitation, and large numbers of refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs) are major precursors to cholera outbreaks. In 2005, Southern Sudan ended its 22-year civil war with North Sudan; as a result, IDPs and refugees are returning to the south. During April--June 2007, investigators from the Southern Sudan Field Epidemiology and Laboratory Training Program (SS-FELTP) and CDC investigated a cholera outbreak in the town of Juba, Southern Sudan. This report summarizes the results of that investigation, which found that 3,157 persons were diagnosed with suspected cholera during January--June 2007, with 74 deaths resulting from the disease. An environmental investigation revealed suboptimal hygiene practices and a lack of water and sanitation infrastructure in Juba. A case-control study indicated that persons less likely to have cholera were more likely to have consumed hot meals containing meat during the outbreak. Contaminated food or water were not identified as possible sources of the cholera outbreak in Juba. However, this might be attributed to limitations of the study, including small sample size. Cholera can reach epidemic proportions if adequate control measures are not implemented early. Mass media campaigns are important for current and new residents in Juba to understand the importance of proper food handling, clean water, and optimal hygiene practices to prevent the spread of cholera.",M1
19346392,"<e>Cholera</e> outbreak in Kenyan refugee camp: risk factors for illness and importance of sanitation.An outbreak of watery diarrhea struck within the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya in April 2005; 418 people were treated, and 4 persons died. Vibrio cholerae O1 was isolated from 33 patients. In June 2005, we conducted a retrospective matched case-control study to define risk factors associated with cholera among camp residents and identify interventions that could prevent further cases and future outbreaks. We identified cases of cholera through medical records at the main health facility in the camp and matched controls (without watery diarrhea since November 2004) to the cases by age category (&lt; 2, 2-4, 5-14, and &gt; 14 years) and location of residence within the camp. Cases were defined as any person of any age with profuse, effortless watery diarrhea (three or more stools in 24 hours). A multivariate model showed that storing drinking water at home in sealed or covered containers was protective against cholera (matched odds ratio [MOR] = 0.49 [0.25, 0.96]), whereas  sharing a latrine with at least three households  (MOR = 2.17 [1.01, 4.68]) and arriving at the Kakuma camp on or after November 2004 (MOR = 4.66 [1.35, 16.05]) were risk factors. Improving sanitation and promoting methods to ensure safe drinking water are likely to be effective measures in moderating future cholera outbreaks in this setting. Higher risks for cholera illness among refugees recently  in-migrated  suggest that there may be value in targeting new arrivals in the camp for risk reduction messages and interventions, such as covered water storage containers, to prevent cholera.",M1

METHODS AND RESULTS: Eight-one epidemiologically unrelated isolates of V. cholerae, and 19 isolates from seven cholera outbreaks were used as the panels. When comparing the two methods using the epidemiologically unrelated isolates, automated ribotyping using PvuII distinguished 38 different ribotypes with a D-value of 0.8956. When combined with serotyping, the D-value is 0.9466. However, PFGE with NotI and SfiI digestions had higher D-values of 0.9951 and 0.9948, respectively. PFGE could cluster the isolates from each outbreak into the same pattern, and distinguish different patterns from different outbreaks, whereas automated ribotyping had lower discriminatory ability. CONCLUSIONS: The automated ribotyping has lower discriminatory ability compared to PFGE, and is limited to application in V. cholerae subtyping and outbreak investigation. SIGNIFICANCE AND IMPACT OF THE STUDY: The study evaluated the limitation in subtyping of automated ribotyping for V. cholerae, and raise the question of improvement for the automated ribotyping in subtyping.",M1

19333369,"Immunologic responses to Vibrio cholerae in patients co-infected with intestinal parasites in Bangladesh.BACKGROUND: Infection with intestinal helminths is common and may contribute to the decreased efficacy of Vibrio cholerae vaccines in endemic compared to non-endemic areas. However, the immunomodulatory effects of concomitant intestinal parasitic infection in <e>cholera</e> patients have not been systematically evaluated. METHODS: We evaluated V. cholerae-specific immune responses in a cohort of patients with severe cholera. 361 patients completed 21 days of observation and 53 (15%) had evidence of a concomitant intestinal parasitic infection based on direct microscopy. Although there were no significant differences in the vibriocidal or lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-specific immune responses to V. cholerae, helminth-infected cholera patients had decreased fecal and serum IgA immune responses to the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) as well as a more modest decrease in serum IgG response to CTB. These findings remained significant for all classes of helminth infection and when controlling for potential confounding variables such as age and nutritional status. Although we hypothesized the differential effect on CTB and LPS immune responses was due to T-cell-dependent immunomodulatory effects of helminth infection, we did not find additional evidence to support a classic Th1 or Th2 polarization of the immune response to V. cholerae infection related to parasite infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The finding that helminth infection has a profound association with the mucosal humoral immune response to V. cholerae has implications for the development of protective immunity in cholera-endemic areas and provides an additional basis for deworming programs in cholera-endemic areas. Additional studies, including further characterization of the role of T cells in the immune response to human V. cholerae infection and the development of an animal model of co-infection, may provide additional insight into the mechanisms underlying these findings.",M1

The bacteria adhere to the mucosal membrane and release cholera toxin, leading to watery diarrhea. There are &gt;100 serovars of V. cholerae, but the O1 and O139 serovars are the main causative agents of cholera. The present study aimed to compare the severity of intestinal mucosal infection caused by O1 El Tor and O139 V. cholerae in a rabbit ileal loop model. The results showed that although the fluid accumulation was similar in the loops inoculated with O1 and O139 V. cholerae, the presence of blood was detected only in the loops inoculated with the O139 serovar. Serosal hemorrhage was confirmed by histopathological examination and the loops inoculated with O139 showed massive destruction of villi and loss of intestinal glands. The submucosa and muscularis mucosa of the ileum showed the presence of edema with congested blood vessels, while severe hemorrhage was seen in the muscularis propria layer. The loops inoculated with O1 El Tor showed only minimal damage, with intact intestinal villi and glands. Diffuse colonies of the O139 serovar were seen to have infiltrated deep into the submucosal layer of the intestine. Although the infection caused by the O1 serovar was focal and invasive, it was more superficial than that due to O139, and involved only the villi. These observations were confirmed by immunostaining with O1 and O139 V. cholerae-specific monoclonal antibodies. The peroxidase reaction demonstrated involvement of tissues down to the submucosal layer in O139 V. cholerae infection, while in O1 El Tor infection, the reaction was confined mainly to the villi, and was greatly reduced in the submucosal region. This is the first reported study to clearly demonstrate the histopathological differences between infections caused by the O139 Bengal and O1 El Tor pathogenic serovars of V. cholerae.",M1

PATIENTS AND METHODS: A group of 175 severely malnourished children of either sex (weight/length &lt;70% of National Center for Health Statistics median), ages 6 to 36 months with cholera, were randomly assigned to receive 1 of 3 oral rehydration solutions (ORSs): glucose-ORS (n=58), glucose-ORS plus 50 g/L of amylase-resistant starch (n=59), or rice-ORS (n=58). Severely dehydrated children at enrollment were administered 100 mL/kg of an intravenous solution for 4 to 6 hours before randomisation, and those with some dehydration were randomised on enrollment. The electrolytes of the 3 ORSs were identical. In acute and convalescence phases, treatment was similar other than the nature of the ORSs. RESULTS: Intravenous fluid (mean) administered to 149 study children was 103 mL/kg (95% confidence interval [CI] 96-109), and all were rehydrated within 6 hours. None of them developed overhydration or heart failure. During the first 24 hours, stool output (31%; 95% CI 14%-42%; P=0.004) and the ORS intake (26%; 95% CI 12%-37%; P=0.002) of children receiving rice-ORS were significantly less compared with children receiving glucose-ORS. The mean duration of diarrhoea in all children (66 hours; 95% CI 62-71), and time to attain 80% of median weight/length (7.15+/-2.81 days) were not different. CONCLUSIONS: Dehydration in severely malnourished children can safely be corrected within 6 hours. All study ORSs were equally efficient in correcting dehydration.

However, the diversity of colonic bacteria in patients with cholera is not known. AIM: To study the diversity of colonic bacteria in malnourished children with cholera before and during treatment with oral rehydration salt solutions containing 1 of these 3 substrates: glucose, rice, or amylase-resistant starch. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Serial fecal samples were collected from 30 malnourished children with cholera until completion of rehydration and partial nutritional recovery; 11 malnourished children without diarrhea; and 6 better nourished children. Polymerase chain reaction, using universal primers for 16S rDNA, was performed on chromosomal DNA extracted from the stool samples, and the products were separated by temporal temperature gradient gel electrophoresis. RESULTS: The Vibrio cholerae band was detected in all children at enrollment and disappeared within 2 days. On day 2, a rapid and significant increase in the band numbers was observed, which was followed by a steady increase until day 28. After full recovery from cholera and partial recovery from malnutrition, the number of bands (11.5+/-2.8) was lower than in healthy children (22.2+/-1.3). On day 3, the number of bands was greater with rice or amylase-resistant starch than with glucose (P&lt;.05).

20160087,"Reactogenicity of live-attenuated Vibrio cholerae vaccines is dependent on flagellins.<e>Cholera</e> is a severe diarrheal disease caused by the motile Gram-negative rod Vibrio cholerae. Live-attenuated V. cholerae vaccines harboring deletions of the genes encoding cholera toxin have great promise for reducing the global burden of cholera. However, development of live vaccines has been hampered by the tendency of such strains to induce noncholeric reactogenic diarrhea in human subjects. The molecular bases of reactogenicity are unknown, but it has been speculated that reactogenic diarrhea is a response to V. cholerae's flagellum and/or the motility that it enables. Here, we used an infant rabbit model of reactogenicity to determine what V. cholerae factors trigger this response. We found that V. cholerae ctx mutants that produced flagellins induced diarrhea, regardless of whether the proteins were assembled into a flagellum or whether the flagellum was functional. In contrast, approximately 90% of rabbits infected with V. cholerae lacking all five flagellin-encoding genes did not develop diarrhea. Thus, flagellin production, independent of flagellum assembly or motility, is sufficient for reactogenicity. The intestinal colonization and intraintestinal localization of the nonreactogenic flagellin-deficient strain were indistinguishable from those of a flagellated motile strain; however, the flagellin-deficient strain stimulated fewer mRNA transcripts coding for proinflammatory cytokines in the intestine. Thus, reactogenic diarrhea may be a consequence of an innate host inflammatory response to V. cholerae flagellins. Our results suggest a simple genetic blueprint for engineering defined nonreactogenic live-attenuated V. cholerae vaccine strains.",M2

V. cholerae O1 and O139 serogroups are toxigenic and are known to cause epidemic <e>cholera</e>. These serogroups produce cholera toxin and other accessory toxins such as accessory cholera enterotoxin, zonula occludens toxin, and multifunctional, autoprocessing repeat in toxin (MARTX). In the present study, we incorporated mutated rtxA and rtxC genes that encode MARTX toxin into the existing aminolevulinic acid (ALA) auxotrophic vaccine candidate VCUSM2 of V. cholerae O139 serogroup. The rtxC mutant was named VCUSM9 and the rtxC/rtxA mutant was named VCUSM10. VCUSM9 and VCUSM10 were able to colonize intestinal cells well, compared with the parent vaccine strain, and produced no fluid accumulation in a rabbit ileal loop model. Cell rounding and western blotting assays indicated that mutation of the rtxC gene alone (VCUSM9 strain) did not abolish MARTX toxicity. However mutation of both the rtxA and rtxC genes (VCUSM10) completely abolished MARTX toxicity. Thus we have produced a new, less reactogenic, auxotrophic rtxC/rtxA mutated vaccine candidate against O139 V. cholerae.",M2
19880451,"A rice-based oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine induces macaque-specific systemic neutralizing antibodies but does not influence pre-existing intestinal immunity.We previously showed that oral immunization of mice with a rice-based vaccine expressing cholera toxin (CT) B subunit (MucoRice-CT-B) induced CT-specific immune responses with toxin-neutralizing activity in both systemic and mucosal compartments. In this study, we examined whether the vaccine can induce CT-specific Ab responses in nonhuman primates. Orally administered MucoRice-CT-B induced high levels of CT-neutralizing serum IgG Abs in the three cynomolgus macaques we immunized. Although the Ab level gradually decreased, detectable levels were maintained for at least 6 mo, and high titers were rapidly recovered after an oral booster dose of the rice-based vaccine. In contrast, no serum IgE Abs against rice storage protein were induced even after multiple immunizations. Additionally, before immunization the macaques harbored intestinal secretory IgA (SIgA) Abs that reacted with both CT and homologous heat-labile enterotoxin produced by enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli and had toxin-neutralizing activity. The SIgA Abs were present in macaques 1 mo to 29 years old, and the level was not enhanced after oral vaccination with MucoRice-CT-B or after subsequent oral administration of the native form of CT. These results show that oral MucoRice-CT-B can effectively induce CT-specific, neutralizing, serum IgG Ab responses even in the presence of pre-existing CT- and heat-labile enterotoxin-reactive intestinal SIgA Abs in nonhuman primates.",M2

A serum vibriocidal assay has been widely used to evaluate the immunogenicity of cholera vaccines in clinical trials. In this study, we developed a duplex vibriocidal assay to obtain vibriocidal antibody titers against both serotypes simultaneously. Initially, serial dilutions of serum from vaccinees were incubated with guinea pig complements along with both streptomycin-resistant Inaba and ampicillin-resistant Ogawa strains for 1h. The mixture was then inoculated on separate agar plates containing each antibiotic to selectively culture each corresponding serotype and incubated at 37 degrees C for 16 to 20h. Bacterial colonies were enumerated using an automated colony counting system to obtain the vibriocidal antibody titers defined by the reciprocal of serum dilution inhibiting bacterial growth by 50%. Performance of the duplex vibriocidal assay was examined by comparison with a single serotype vibriocidal assay using 20 clinical sera consisting of ten-paired sera prepared at pre- and post-vaccination. Both assays showed a good correlation for vibriocidal titers against the two serotypes, respectively, as determined by Pearson correlation coefficient (r) and regression coefficient (beta) analyses; r=0.998, beta=1.003 for Inaba and r=0.997, beta=0.999 for Ogawa, respectively.

19737904,"Toxin-mediated effects on the innate mucosal defenses: implications for enteric vaccines.Recent studies have confirmed older observations that the enterotoxins enhance enteric bacterial colonization and pathogenicity. How and why this happens remains unknown at this time. It appears that toxins such as the heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) from Escherichia coli can help overcome the innate mucosal barrier as a key step in enteric pathogen survival. We review key observations relevant to the roles of LT and <e>cholera</e> toxin in protective immunity and the effects of these toxins on innate mucosal defenses. We suggest either that toxin-mediated fluid secretion mechanically disrupts the mucus layer or that toxins interfere with innate mucosal defenses by other means. Such a breach gives pathogens access to the enterocyte, leading to binding and pathogenicity by enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) and other organisms. Given the common exposure to LT(+) ETEC by humans visiting or residing in regions of endemicity, barrier disruption should frequently render the gut vulnerable to ETEC and other enteric infections. Conversely, toxin immunity would be expected to block this process by protecting the innate mucosal barrier. Years ago, Peltola et al. (Lancet 338:1285-1289, 1991) observed unexpectedly broad protective effects against LT(+) ETEC and mixed infections when using a toxin-based enteric vaccine. If toxins truly exert barrier-disruptive effects as a key step in pathogenesis, then a return to classic toxin-based vaccine strategies for enteric disease is warranted and can be expected to have unexpectedly broad protective effects.",M2

In order to determine whether transcutaneous immunization (TCI) with a V. cholerae neoglycoconjugate (CHO-BSA) comprised of a synthetic terminal hexasaccharide of the O-specific polysaccharide of V. cholerae O1 (Ogawa) conjugated with bovine serum albumin (BSA) could induce anti-V. cholerae LPS and vibriocidal responses, we applied CHO-BSA transcutaneously in the presence or absence of the immune adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) to mice. Transcutaneously applied neoglycoconjugate elicited prominent V. cholerae specific LPS IgG responses in the presence of CT, but not IgM or IgA responses. CT applied on the skin induced strong IgG and IgA serum responses. TCI with neoglycoconjugate did not elicit detectable vibriocidal responses, protection in a mouse challenge assay, or stool anti-V. cholerae IgA responses, irrespective of the presence or absence of CT.

SCOPE: Risk of travellers' diarrhoea was assessed according to destination and reason for travel in high-risk travellers of a travel clinic in Barcelona, Spain. Those at high-risk between January and December 2005 were advised on water/food safety and hygiene. High-risk travellers between January and December 2006 were additionally vaccinated with WC/rBS oral cholera vaccine. Data regarding diarrhoea were gathered by structured telephone interview or e-mailed questionnaire following the travellers' return. The incidence of diarrhoea in the group vaccinated with WC/rBS oral cholera vaccine (n=321) was 17.4%, compared with 39.7% in the non-vaccinated group (n=337) (adjusted risk ratio 0.40). The first episode was significantly shorter in the vaccinated group (mean 2.3 days) than in the non-vaccinated group (mean 3.8 days) (p&lt;0.001).

19192125,"Cost-benefit of WC/rBS oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine for vaccination against ETEC-caused travelers' diarrhea.BACKGROUND: The most common infectious health problem encountered by travelers to countries in the developing region is travelers' diarrhea (TD), with enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) being the most common pathogen isolated. Although mild in most cases, the disease still leads to the loss of a significant part of a vacation or business trip. There is currently a lack of knowledge about the costs in relation to the benefits of vaccination against TD caused by ETEC, and the purposes of this study were to estimate and develop a cost-benefit analysis of vaccination using whole-cell/recombinant-B-subunit oral cholera vaccine. METHODS: The consequences of the vaccination were identified and quantified in monetary terms. The cost-benefits for leisure and business travelers were assessed separately. The value of the travel was separated into the cost of the trip and of lost leisure time/business opportunities. A person with TD was in base case estimated to lose on average 3.5 days of a 7-day leisure trip and 2.5 days of a 4-day business trip. Results are presented for a Canadian traveler to endemic areas in year 2007 in US$. RESULTS: The average cost of a TD event was estimated at $1,460 and $1,996 for leisure and business travelers, respectively. The net value of the vaccination, however, varied with the risk of the disease. Through extensive literature searches, an updated ETEC map illustrating the proportion of ETEC-caused TD was created. CONCLUSIONS: The analysis indicated that vaccination would be considered cost-effective at incidence rates of ETEC-caused TD above about 13 and 9% for leisure and business travelers, respectively. It is, however, important to keep in mind that it is the value of the travel for the individual traveler that will decide if the vaccination provides good value for money.",M2

Since decreased immunogenicity of oral vaccines in children in developing countries is a critical problem, we tested interventions to enhance responses to Dukoral. We evaluated the effect on the immune responses by temporarily withholding breast-feeding or by giving zinc supplementation. Two doses of Dukoral consisting of killed cholera vibrios and cholera B subunit were given to 6-18 months old Bangladeshi children (n=340) and safety and immunogenicity studied. Our results showed that two doses of the vaccine were safe and induced antibacterial (vibriocidal) antibody responses in 57% and antitoxin responses in 85% of the children. Immune responses were comparable after intake of one and two doses. Temporary withholding breast-feeding for 3 h before immunization or supplementation with 20 mg of zinc per day for 42 days resulted in increased magnitude of vibriocidal antibodies (77% and 79% responders, respectively). Administration of vaccines without buffer or in water did not result in reduction of vibriocidal responses.

Although the prevalence of diarrhea due to V. cholerae O139 has recorded a decrease, efforts on vaccine development continues to formulate an oral vaccine capable of stimulating the gut mucosal system. We have studied the mucosal immunogenicity in Bangladeshi adults to a killed whole cell (WC) bivalent cholera vaccine composed of V. cholerae O139 as well as V. cholerae O1 strains together with the recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) (WC-O1/O139/CTB) and compared the immune responses to that obtained with the licensed monovalent cholera vaccine, Dukoral (WC-O1/CTB). Direct estimation of the WC-O1/O139/CTB vaccine-specific mucosal responses were carried out using lymphocytes isolated from duodenal biopsies, intestinal lavage fluid and feces. The vaccine induced robust antibody-secreting cell responses in the duodenum specific to CTB as well as the O1 and O139 lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Magnitude of response was higher in the gut than in the circulation in all three antibody isotypes. The CTB and LPS-specific mucosal antibody responses were also seen in intestinal lavage fluid and fecal extracts. Vibriocidal antibody responses in plasma were observed to both the V. cholerae O1 and O139 serogroups (76% and 57% response rates, respectively). Plasma IgA and IgG responses to CTB and IgA responses to both O1 and O139 LPS were elevated. The immune responses were comparable to that seen to the monovalent WC-O1/CTB recipients in all components studied. Overall, the bivalent cholera vaccine induces strong mucosal responses and the addition of the O139 component does not interfere with the responses to the licensed vaccine Dukoral. This sets the ground for testing such vaccines in large field trials in Bangladesh and also demonstrates that addition of other vibrio components to the existing cholera vaccine does not alter the responses to the O1 vaccine components.",M2
19135286,"Spatial and environmental connectivity analysis in a <e>cholera</e> vaccine trial.This paper develops theory and methods for vaccine trials that utilize spatial and environmental information. Satellite imagery is used to identify whether households are connected to one another via water bodies in a study area in rural Bangladesh. Then relationships between neighborhood-level cholera vaccine coverage and placebo incidence and neighborhood-level spatial variables are measured. The study hypothesis is that unvaccinated people who are environmentally connected to people who have been vaccinated will be at lower risk compared to unvaccinated people who are environmentally connected to people who have not been vaccinated. We use four datasets including: a cholera vaccine trial database, a longitudinal demographic database of the rural population from which the vaccine trial participants were selected, a household-level geographic information system (GIS) database of the same study area, and high resolution Quickbird satellite imagery. An environmental connectivity metric was constructed by integrating the satellite imagery with the vaccine and demographic databases linked with GIS. The results show that there is a relationship between neighborhood rates of cholera vaccination and placebo incidence. Thus, people are indirectly protected when more people in their environmentally connected neighborhood are vaccinated. This result is similar to our previous work that used a simpler Euclidean distance neighborhood to measure neighborhood vaccine coverage [Ali, M., Emch, M., von Seidlein, L., Yunus, M., Sack, D. A., Holmgren, J., et al. (2005). Herd immunity conferred by killed oral cholera vaccines in Bangladesh. Lancet, 366(9479), 44-49]. Our new method of measuring environmental connectivity is more precise since it takes into account the transmission mode of cholera and therefore this study validates our assertion that the oral cholera vaccine provides indirect protection in addition to direct protection.",M2
19100303,"Differential immunogenicity of Vibrio cholerae O139 variants expressing different combinations of naturally occurring and atypical forms of the serogroup polysaccharide.Field testing of an inactivated bivalent O1/O139 <e>cholera</e> vaccine suggests that Vibrio cholerae O1 is more immunogenic than V. cholerae O139. To investigate whether this might be partly attributable to the production of capsular polysaccharide (CPS) by O139 isolates, we have compared the immunogenicity of variant strains expressing different combinations of lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and CPS. These studies indicate that the core-linked LPS structure is of paramount importance for induction of antibodies to the serogroup antigen. By contrast CPS was minimally immunogenic. Significantly the presence of CPS did not modulate the immunogenicity of the underlying LPS. To examine whether differences in LPS structure might contribute to the differing immunogenicities of the O1 and O139 serogroups, an attempt was made to modify the normal O139 LPS structure by provision of one of several heterologous wzz genes. The resulting variants displayed additional, atypical surface polysaccharide, whose modal length was characteristic for the particular wzz gene. By immunoblotting this novel material showed a ladder-like banding pattern typical of LPS, but its failure to be stained by silver indicated that it was not core-associated and was therefore more like truncated CPS. Consistent with our earlier findings, studies using systemic or mucosal routes of immunization failed to demonstrate any consistent enhancement of antibody responses associated with production of these aberrant polysaccharide polymers.",M2
18648931,"Investigation towards bivalent chemically defined glycoconjugate immunogens prepared from acid-detoxified lipopolysaccharide of Vibrio cholerae O1, serotype Inaba.A free amino group present on the acid-detoxified lipopolysaccharide (pmLPS) of V. cholerae O1 serotype Inaba was investigated for site-specific conjugation. Chemoselective pmLPS biotinylation afforded the corresponding mono-functionalized derivative, which retained antigenicity. Thus, pmLPS was bound to carrier proteins using thioether conjugation chemistry. Induction of an anti-LPS antibody (Ab) response in BALB/c mice was observed for all conjugates. Interestingly, the sera had vibriocidal activity against both Ogawa and Inaba strains opening the way to a possible bivalent vaccine. However, the level of this Ab response was strongly affected by both the nature of the linker and of the carrier. Furthermore, no switch from IgM to IgG, i.e. from a T cell-independent to a T cell-dependent immune response was detected, a result tentatively explained by the possible presence of free polysaccharide in the formulation. Taken together, these results encourage further investigation towards the development of potent pmLPS-based neoglycoconjugate immunogens, fully aware of the challenge faced in the development of a <e>cholera</e> vaccine that will provide efficient serogroup coverage.",M2
18582519,"Construction of a Vibrio cholerae prototype vaccine strain O395-N1-E1 which accumulates cell-associated <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit.Because of its production and use in Vietnam, the most widely used oral cholera vaccine consists of heat- or formalin-killed Vibrio cholerae whole cells (WC). An earlier version of this type of vaccine called whole cell-recombinant B subunit vaccine (BS-WC) produced in Sweden also contained the B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB). Both WC and BS-WC vaccines produced moderate levels of protection in field trials designed to evaluate their cholera efficacy. V. cholerae cells in these vaccines induce antibacterial immunity, and CTB contributes to the vaccine's efficacy presumably by stimulating production of anti-toxin neutralizing antibody. Although more effective than the WC vaccine, the BS-WC vaccine has not been adopted for manufacture by developing world countries primarily because the CTB component is difficult to manufacture and include in the vaccine in the doses needed to induce significant immune responses. We reasoned this was a technical problem that might be solved by engineering strains of V. cholerae that express cell-associated CTB that would co-purify with the bacterial cell fraction during the manufacture of WC vaccine. Here we report that construction of a V. cholerae O1 classical strain, O395-N1-E1, that has been engineered to accumulate CTB in the periplasmic fraction by disrupting the epsE gene of type II secretion pathway. O395-N1-E1 induces anti-CTB IgG and vibriocidal antibodies in mice immunized with two doses of formalin killed whole cells. Intraperitoneal immunization of mice with O395-N1-E1 induced a significantly higher anti-CTB antibody response compared to that of the parental strain, O395-N1. Our results suggest that this prototype cholera vaccine candidate strain may assist in preparing improved and inexpensive oral BS-WC cholera vaccine without the need to purify CTB separately.",M2
18564011,"Vaccination with Dukoral against travelers' diarrhea (ETEC) and <e>cholera</e>.There is currently only one vaccine available that provides protection against diarrhea caused by Vibrio cholerae and, to a lesser degree, enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC). Adverse events of this oral whole-cell/recombinant B-subunit vaccine have been negligible. Protective efficacy against cholera is 85%, while protection against the heat-labile toxin of ETEC reaches 67%. There is still a need for data on protection of Western travelers against travelers' diarrhea in general by Dukoral vaccination. However, current studies show a protective effect of up to 43%. Although the vaccine is only licensed for vaccination against cholera in most Western countries, there is mounting evidence that the oral cholera vaccine is a valuable option to those traveling to high-risk endemic areas. Vaccination against cholera and ETEC should be recommended for at-risk travelers, in particular those with high exposure at their travel destination or high personal risks through fluid loss.",M2
18422632,"Effects of seven potential probiotic strains on specific immune responses in healthy adults: a double-blind, randomized, controlled trial.This pilot study investigated the immunomodulatory properties of seven probiotic strains. Eighty-three healthy volunteers aged 18-62 years consumed 2 x 10(10) CFU of bacteria or a placebo (maltodextrin) over 3 weeks (D0-D21). Subjects received an oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine at D7 and at D14; blood and saliva samples were collected at D0, D21 and D28. Serum samples were analyzed for specific IgA, IgG and IgM, and saliva samples were analyzed for specific IgA only, by ELISA. Statistical analyses were based on Wilcoxon's signed-rank test (intragroup analyses) and exact median t-test (intergroup analyses). Salivary analysis showed no difference in specific IgA concentrations between groups. Serum analysis indicated an effect of some of the tested strains on specific humoral responses. Between D0 and D21, IgG increased in two probiotic groups, for example, Bifidobacterium lactis Bl-04 and Lactobacillus acidophilus La-14, compared with controls (P=0.01). Trends toward significant changes in immunoglobulin serum concentrations compared with controls (P&lt;0.1) were found for six out of the seven probiotic strains. In conclusion, some strains of probiotics demonstrated a faster immune response measured with serum immunoglobulin indicators, especially IgG, although overall vaccination was not influenced. Specific strains of probiotics may thus act as adjuvants to the humoral immune response following oral vaccination.",M2
18154075,"[An avirulent vibrio cholerae strain--producer of the <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit: obtaining and molecular genetic analysis]The conjugative recombinant plasmid pIEM3 (KmR TcR) was constructed in order to introduce the cloned ctxB gene encoding the cholera toxin B subunit into the Vibrio cholerae cells. The plasmid was obtained as a result of co-integration of two plasmids: a conjugative plasmid, pIEM1(KmR), carrying mini-kan transposon and IS1 element, as well as the pCTdelta27(TcR) plasmid that is a derivative of the pBR322 which carries the cloned ctxB gene. The avirulent Vibrio cholerae strain eltor biovar deprived (according to the PCR analysis) of the key structural and regulatory pathogenicity genes and carrying a mutation in a single gene of the O1 antigen was chosen as the pIEM3 plasmid carrier strain. The cointegrate uncoupling was shown to take place in 5% the cholera vibrio cells followed by retention of only the multi-copy pCTdelta7 plasmid. This event leads to the formation of the TcRKmS clones characterized by high levels of the cholera toxin secreted B subunit production (10 to 14 microg/ml), one of these (KM93) being selected as a strain-producer of the protein. Molecular-genetic and biochemical assays were used to elucidate peculiar features of inheritance and expression of the cloned ctxAB gene within the KM93 cells. The expression of the cloned ctxB gene was shown to be independent of the presence of the toxR, tcpP, tcpH, toxT regulatory genes suggesting the existence of some other mechanisms that might exert their control over the transcriptional activity of the cholera toxin B subunit gene. Effective production of the cholera toxin B subunit would be also observed if the constructed producer strain was cultured under the conditions of industrial process. This indicates a possibility of its employment as a source of this protein involved in manufacturing cholera immunodiagnostic and prophylactic preparations.",M2
18045752,"Construction and preclinical evaluation of recombinant Peru-15 expressing high levels of the <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit as a vaccine against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli.Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is the leading cause of traveler's diarrhea. The heat-labile (LT) and heat-stable (ST) toxins mediate ETEC induced diarrhea. ETEC strains may express LT, ST, or both LT and ST, with LT-expressing strains accounting for approximately 50-60% of ETEC-related traveler's diarrhea. Cholera toxin (CT) is &gt;80% homologous to LT and vaccination with CT-B subunit (CT-B) -based vaccines elicit a protective immune response against LT-producing ETEC strains. Peru-15 is an oral, single-dose, live-attenuated cholera vaccine candidate that has been investigated in several clinical trials (n&gt;400 subjects) and was proven well tolerated, immunogenic, and efficacious. Peru-15 was genetically engineered to express and secrete high levels of CT-B by cloning ctxB onto a glnA balanced-lethal plasmid under the transcriptional control of a strong constitutive promoter, resulting in Peru-15pCTB. In vitro characterization demonstrated that Peru-15pCTB secreted approximately 30-fold more CT-B than Peru-15 and CT-B was stably produced after 40 generations of growth and throughout simulated Seed Bank and FDP (Final Drug Product) production conditions. In preclinical studies, the geometric mean anti-CT-B IgG titer in the sera of mice inoculated intranasally with two doses of Peru-15pCTB was &gt;32-fold higher than in mice inoculated with Peru-15. Similarly, rabbits orally inoculated with a single dose of Peru-15pCTB developed titers that were approximately 30-fold higher than rabbits inoculated with a single dose of Peru-15. Sera from Peru-15pCTB vaccinated mice and rabbits neutralized LT toxicity in an in vitro assay. Peru-15pCTB has several promising characteristics of an oral, single-dose, bivalent cholera/ETEC vaccine and is advancing towards a Phase 1 clinical trial.",M2
17962948,"Expression of toxin co-regulated pilus subunit A (TCPA) of Vibrio cholerae and its immunogenic epitopes fused to <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit in transgenic tomato (Solanum lycopersicum).For protection against cholera, it is important to develop efficient vaccine capable of inducing anti-toxin as well as anti-colonizing immunity against Vibrio cholerae infections. Earlier, expression of cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) in tomato was reported by us. In the present investigation, toxin co-regulated pilus subunit A (TCPA), earlier reported to be an antigen capable of providing anti-colonization immunity, has been expressed in tomato. Further, to generate more potent combinatorial antigens, nucleotides encoding P4 or P6 epitope of TCPA were fused to cholera toxin B subunit gene (ctxB) and expressed in tomato. Presence of transgenes in the tomato genome was confirmed by PCR and expression of genes was confirmed at transcript and protein level. TCPA, chimeric CTB-P4 and CTB-P6 proteins were also expressed in E. coli. TCPA protein expressed in E. coli was purified to generate anti-TCPA antibodies in rabbit. Immunoblot and G(M1)-ELISA verified the synthesis and assembly of pentameric chimeric proteins in fruit tissue of transgenic tomato plants. The chimeric protein CTB-P4 and CTB-P6 accumulated up to 0.17 and 0.096% of total soluble protein (TSP), respectively, in tomato fruits. Whereas expression of TCPA, CTB-P4 and CTB-P6 in E. coli can be utilized for development of conventional vaccine, expression of these antigens which can provide both anti-toxin as well as anti-colonization immunity, has been demonstrated in plants, in a form which is potentially capable of inducing immune response against cholera infection.",M2
17822799,"Private demand for <e>cholera</e> vaccines in rural Matlab, Bangladesh.OBJECTIVES: To estimate household willingness to pay (WTP) for cholera vaccines in a rural area of Bangladesh, which had participated in a 1985 oral cholera vaccine trial. METHODS: A contingent valuation study was undertaken in Matlab, Bangladesh in summer 2005. All respondents (N=591) received a description of a cholera vaccine that was 50% effective for 3 years and had negligible side effects. Respondents were asked how many vaccines they would purchase for their household at randomly pre-assigned prices. Negative binomial regression models were used to estimate the number of vaccines demanded and to calculate average WTP. RESULTS: On average, respondents were willing to pay about US$ 9.50 to purchase vaccines for all members of their household (i.e. US$ 1.70 per vaccine). Average WTP per person is US$ 2.40 for young children (1-4 years), US$ 1.20 for school-age children, and US$ 1.05 for adults. Median WTP estimates are significantly smaller: US$ 1.00 for young children, US$ 0.05 for schoolchildren, and US$ 0 for adults. CONCLUSIONS: There is significant demand for cholera vaccines in Matlab at low prices. Recent herd protection research suggests that unvaccinated persons would also experience reduced incidence via indirect effects at low coverage rates associated with moderate vaccine prices.",M2
17573530,"Rice-based mucosal vaccine as a global strategy for cold-chain- and needle-free vaccination.Capable of inducing antigen-specific immune responses in both systemic and mucosal compartments without the use of syringe and needle, mucosal vaccination is considered ideal for the global control of infectious diseases. In this study, we developed a rice-based oral vaccine expressing <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit (CTB) under the control of the endosperm-specific expression promoter 2.3-kb glutelin GluB-1 with codon usage optimization for expression in rice seed. An average of 30 mug of CTB per seed was stored in the protein bodies, which are storage organelles in rice. When mucosally fed, rice seeds expressing CTB were taken up by the M cells covering the Peyer's patches and induced CTB-specific serum IgG and mucosal IgA antibodies with neutralizing activity. When expressed in rice, CTB was protected from pepsin digestion in vitro. Rice-expressed CTB also remained stable and thus maintained immunogenicity at room temperature for &gt;1.5 years, meaning that antigen-specific mucosal immune responses were induced at much lower doses than were necessary with purified recombinant CTB. Because they require neither refrigeration (cold-chain management) nor a needle, these rice-based mucosal vaccines offer a highly practical and cost-effective strategy for orally vaccinating large populations against mucosal infections, including those that may result from an act of bioterrorism.",M2

17348246,"Traffic of antibody-secreting cells after immunization with a liposome-associated, CpG-ODN-adjuvanted oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine.An oral cholera vaccine made up of heat-treated recombinant cholera toxin (rCT), V. cholerae lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and recombinant toxin-co-regulated pili subunit A (rTcpA), entrapped in liposomes in the presence of unmethylated bacterial CpG-DNA (ODN#1826) was used to orally immunize a group of eight week old rats. A booster dose was given 14 days later. Control rats received placebo (vaccine diluent). The kinetics of the immune response were investigated by enumerating the antigen specific-antibody secreting cells (ASC) in the blood circulation and intestinal lamina propria using the ELISPOT assay and a histo-immunofluorescence assay (IFA), respectively. ASC of all antigenic specificities were detected in the blood of the vaccinated rats as early as two days after the booster dose. The numbers of LPS-ASC and TcpA-ASC in the blood were at their peak at day 3 post booster while the number of CT-ASC was highest at day 4 after the booster immunization. At day 13 post immunization, no ASC were detected in the blood. A several fold increase in the number of ASC of all antigenic specificities in the lamina propria above the background numbers of the control animals were found in all vaccinated rats at days 6 and 13 post booster (earlier and later time points were not studied). Vibriocidal antibody and specific antibodies to CT, LPS and TcpA were detected in 57.1% and 52.4%, 14.3%, and 19.0% of the orally vaccinated rats, respectively. The data indicated that rats orally primed with the vaccine could produce a rapid anamnestic response after re-exposure to the V. cholerae antigens. Thus, a single dose of the vaccine is expected to elicit a similar anamnestic immune response in people from cholera endemic areas who have been naturally primed to V. cholerae antigens, while two doses at a 14 day interval should be adequate for a traveler to a disease endemicarea.",M2

Respondents were told that two doses of the vaccine would be required 2 weeks apart, and that the cholera vaccine would offer excellent protection against infection for the first year following vaccination, and some protection during the second and third year after a person is vaccinated. This research was carried out in order to learn more about private demand for vaccines in a cholera-endemic area. We asked two types of valuation questions: (1) a discrete-price offer for a vaccine that could be purchased for household members and (2) a payment card designed to assess uncertainty in the respondent's demand for a vaccine for self-protection. We estimate average household willingness to pay (WTP) for cholera vaccines in Beira to be 2005 US$ 8.45. This estimate of household WTP represents the perceived private economic benefits to a household--six persons on average--of giving all members free cholera vaccines.",M2
17242760,"Using a fingerprint recognition system in a vaccine trial to avoid misclassification.PROBLEM: The potential for misidentification of trial participants, leading to misclassification, is a threat to the integrity of randomized controlled trials. The correct identification of study subjects in large trials over prolonged periods is of vital importance to those conducting clinical trials. Currently used means of identifying study participants, such as identity cards and records of name, address, name of household head and demographic characteristics, require large numbers of well-trained personnel, and still leave room for uncertainty. APPROACH: We used fingerprint recognition technology for the identification of trial participants. This technology is already widely used in security and commercial contexts but not so far in clinical trials. LOCAL SETTING: A phase 2 <e>cholera</e> vaccine trial in SonLa, Viet Nam. RELEVANT CHANGES: An optical sensor was used to scan fingerprints. The fingerprint template of each participant was used to verify his or her identity during each of eight follow-up visits. LESSONS LEARNED: A system consisting of a laptop computer and sensor is small in size, requires minimal training and on average six seconds for scanning and recognition. All participants' identities were verified in the trial. Fingerprint recognition should become the standard technology for identification of participants in field trials. Fears exist, however, regarding the potential for invasion of privacy. It will therefore be necessary to convince not only trial participants but also investigators that templates of fingerprints stored in databases are less likely to be subject to abuse than currently used information databases.",M2

DUKORALR the inactivated oral cholera vaccine has recently been licensed for use in the European Union. This vaccine contains killed whole cells of V cholerae and 1 mg of purified recombinant CTB (rCTB). DUKORALR has a good safety profile and there has been no indication that active CT is present. Nevertheless, an assay that confirms the absence of active CTA in the vaccine is advantageous to ensure vaccine safety. Conventional assays such as the Y-cell assay cannot detect biologically active amounts of CT in DUKORALR because of the large amount of rCTB present. We have developed an assay based on a fluorescently labelled 11-mer peptide substrate that detects CTA activity despite the presence of excess rCTB.",M2

METHODS: The prokaryotic expression vector pET32a+/ctB/ure I was constructed by inserting ctB gene amplified by PCR into the 5' terminus of ure I gene of expression vector pET32a+/ure I. The fusion gene was verified by endonuclease digestion and sequence analysis. The fusion protein ctB/ure I was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3), purified by His-HP affinity chromatography, and analyzed by SDS-PAGE, Western blot and Pro-gel analyzer 4.0. The mice were immunized with purified ctB/ure I, and the immunoreactivity with ctB and ure I of the murine sera was analyzed by indirect ELISA. RESULTS: The pET32a+/ctB/ure I expression vector was constructed successfully and confirmed by endonuclease digestion and sequence analysis. The expressed ctB/ure I protein with molecular weight about 58,000 was shown when induced with 1 mmol/L IPTG for 4 h at 22 degrees C, and the protein could react with horse anti-ctB and human anti-ure I sera when detected with Western blot, and the purity of the purified protein was about 94.3%. The sera from mice immunized with purified ctB/ure I protein could react with ctB, ure I, and ctB/ure I when detected with indirect ELISA. CONCLUSION: The fusion protein expression vector pET32a+/ctB/ure I was constructed successfully. The fusion protein ctB/ure I was shown to have immunoreactivity with both anti-ctB and anti-ure I anti-sera, and could evoke production of anti-ctB and anti-ure I antibody in mice.

16493030,"Dendritic cell-mediated induction of mucosal cytotoxic responses following intravaginal immunization with the nontoxic B subunit of <e>cholera</e> toxin.The use of the nontoxic B subunit of cholera toxin (CTB) as mucosal adjuvant and carrier-delivery system for inducing secretory Ab responses has been documented previously with different soluble Ags. In this study, we have evaluated this approach for inducing CTL responses against a prototype Ag, OVA, in the female genital mucosa. We report here the ability of an immunogen comprised of CTB conjugated to OVA (CTB-OVA) given by intravaginal (ivag) route to induce genital OVA-specific CTLs in mice. Using adoptive transfer models, we demonstrate that ivag application of CTB-OVA activates OVA-specific IFN-gamma-producing CD4 and CD8 T cells in draining lymph nodes (DLN). Moreover, ivag CTB induces an expansion of IFN-gamma-secreting CD8+ T cells in DLN and genital mucosa and promotes Ab responses to OVA. In contrast, ivag administration of OVA alone or coadministered with CTB failed to induce such responses. Importantly, we demonstrate that ivag CTB-OVA generates OVA-specific CTLs in DLN and the genital mucosa. Furthermore, genital CD11b+ CD11c+ dendritic cells (DCs), but not CD8+ CD11c+ or CD11c- APCs, present MHC class I epitopes acquired after ivag CTB-OVA, suggesting a critical role of this DC subset in the priming of genital CTLs. Inhibition studies indicate that the presentation of OVA MHC class I epitopes by DCs conditioned with CTB-OVA involves a proteasome-dependent and chloroquine-sensitive mechanism. These results demonstrate that CTB is an efficient adjuvant-delivery system for DC-mediated induction of genital CTL responses and may have implications for the design of vaccines against sexually transmitted infections.",M2
16467326,"Influence of exogenous reproductive hormones on specific antibody production in genital secretions after vaginal vaccination with recombinant <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit in humans.The objective of this study was to investigate the influence of exogenous reproductive hormones on the local and systemic production of specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibodies after vaginal vaccination with recombinant cholera toxin subunit B (CTB). Three groups of women using either progesterone-containing intrauterine devices (n=9), oral contraceptives (n=8), or no hormonal contraceptive methods (n=9) were vaginally immunized twice, 2 weeks apart. Cervical secretions, vaginal fluids, and serum were collected before and after vaccination. Total and CTB-specific IgA and IgG antibodies in genital secretions and serum were analyzed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. A majority of the women presented strong CTB-specific IgA and IgG antibody responses in cervicovaginal secretions after vaccination, whereas the antitoxin responses in serum were weaker. Exogenously administered steroid hormones did not seem to have any impact on the production of specific antibodies. Both the frequencies and the magnitudes of IgA and IgG antitoxin responses in genital secretions were comparable among the three immunization groups. An association, in particular for IgA, was found between the magnitudes of the CTB-specific antibody responses in cervical secretions and vaginal fluids after vaccination. The sensitivities and positive predictive values of vaginal antibody analyses to reflect responses in cervical secretions were also high, suggesting that vaginal fluids alone might be used for evaluation of genital immune responses in large-scale vaccination studies in the future.",M2
16432199,"Identification of a conserved bacterial protein secretion system in Vibrio cholerae using the Dictyostelium host model system.The bacterium Vibrio cholerae, like other human pathogens that reside in environmental reservoirs, survives predation by unicellular eukaryotes. Strains of the O1 and O139 serogroups cause <e>cholera</e>, whereas non-O1/non-O139 strains cause human infections through poorly defined mechanisms. Using Dictyostelium discoideum as a model host, we have identified a virulence mechanism in a non-O1/non-O139 V. cholerae strain that involves extracellular translocation of proteins that lack N-terminal hydrophobic leader sequences. Accordingly, we have named these genes  VAS  genes for virulence-associated secretion, and we propose that these genes encode a prototypic  type VI  secretion system. We show that vas genes are required for cytotoxicity of V. cholerae cells toward Dictyostelium amoebae and mammalian J774 macrophages by a contact-dependent mechanism. A large number of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens carry genes homologous to vas genes and potential effector proteins secreted by this pathway (i.e., hemolysin-coregulated protein and VgrG). Mutations in vas homologs in other bacterial species have been reported to attenuate virulence in animals and cultured macrophages. Thus, the genes encoding the VAS-related, type VI secretion system likely play an important conserved function in microbial pathogenesis and represent an additional class of targets for vaccine and antimicrobial drug-based therapies.",M2
16343705,"Resistance of the <e>cholera</e> vaccine candidate IEM108 against CTXPhi infection.The cholera toxin (CT) genes ctxAB are carried on a lysogenic phage of Vibrio cholerae, CTXPhi, which can transfer ctxAB between toxigenic and nontoxigenic strains of bacteria. This transfer may pose a problem when live oral cholera vaccine is given to people in epidemic areas, because the toxin genes can be reacquired by the vaccine strains. To address this problem, we have constructed a live vaccine candidate, IEM108, which carries an El Tor-derived rstR gene. This gene encodes a repressor and can render bacterial resistance to CTXPhi infection. In this study, we evaluated the resistance of IEM108 against CTXPhi infection by using a CTXPhi marked for chloramphenicol (CAF) resistance and an in vivo model. We found that the cloned rstR gene rendered IEM108 immune to infection with the marked CTXPhi. In addition, the infection rate of IEM108 was even lower than that of the native CTXPhi-positive strain. These results suggest that the vaccine candidate IEM108 is resistant to infection by CTXPhi.",M2
16173391,"[Effects of the recombinant plasmid carrying the genes of <e>cholera</e> prophages CTX and RS1 on the expression of virulence and immunogenicity genes in the cholera pathogen]Using toxin-coregulated adhesion pili (TCP), the etiologic agent of cholera is able to colonize human small intestine, where this pathogen proceeds with the production of the secreted cholera toxin (CT), inducing the development of severe diarrhea. At the same time, TCP and CT are not only the major factors of pathogenicity but also form a part of the group of key protective antigens. Immunoenzyme, immunoblotting, self-agglutination investigations, electron-microscopic studies, and electrophoretic assay of the outer membrane proteins showed that the recombinant plasmid carrying a number of cloned genes of two prophages, CTX and RS1, introduced into model Vibrio cholerae strains classical biovariant, resulted in the formation of strains with an enhanced rate of synthesis of three protective antigens: CT, TCP, and an outer membrane protein, OmpU. A simultaneous increase in the level of biosynthesis of the three antigens in V. cholerae was demonstrated to be specified by alterations in the expression of the toxR regulatory gene. Information was obtained suggesting that the transcriptional activity of toxR gene was dependent on the activity of rstC antirepressor gene derived from RS1 pro-phage and localized in the cloned fragment. Strains hyperproducing the three protective antigens can be used to construct more efficient non-living cholera vaccines, and to isolate the indicated proteins applicable to the development of diagnostic test-systems.",M2

A single dose of Peru-15 (approximately 2 x 108 cfu) or placebo (buffer only) was given in standard bicarbonate and ascorbic acid buffer.RESULTS. Study treatment did not elicit any major adverse events in the volunteers, during either the inpatient or the outpatient phases, and there were no reports of diarrhea. V. cholerae was isolated from the stool of only 1 volunteer and was found to be genetically identical to the vaccine strain. Vibriocidal antibody responses were seen in 30 (75%) of 40 vaccine recipients and in 3 (10%) of 30 placebo recipients. Peripheral blood immunoglobulin (Ig) A and IgM antibody-secreting cell responses to lipopolysaccharide were seen in the majority of vaccine recipients (response rate, 78%--88%). Seroconversion for lipopolysaccharide-specific IgA antibodies was seen in 88% of vaccine recipients. The response in vaccine recipients was significantly higher than that in placebo recipients, in all of the immunological assays (P=.036 to &lt;.001). A lower immunological response against cholera toxin B subunit was detected.CONCLUSIONS. The safety and immunogenicity of this Peru-15 vaccine candidate indicates the usefulness of future studies in Bangladesh, where cholera is endemic.",M2
15982790,"Analysis of efficacy of CVD 103-HgR live oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine against all-cause travellers' diarrhoea in a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC), which produces heat labile toxin (LT) and/or heat stable toxin (ST), is considered to be the most common known cause of travellers' diarrhoea (TD). Owing to the antigenic similarity between cholera toxin and LT, immunization with inactivated oral B-subunit/whole-cell cholera vaccine (BS-WC) offers short term (3 months) but significant (&gt;67%) protection against TD caused by LT-related ETEC. Since it expresses the cholera toxin B (CTB) subunit, the live attenuated oral cholera vaccine strain CVD 103-HgR, may induce similar protection. A trial was performed to determine if CVD 103-HgR live oral cholera vaccine would provide a protective efficacy of at least 50% against TD. In addition, the protective efficacy of the vaccine against TD specifically due to LT-ETEC and LT/ST-ETEC was determined. Volunteers (n=134) travelling to Indonesia, India, Thailand or West-Africa were randomised to receive either a placebo (n=65) or the vaccine (n=69). In the placebo group, 46% reported an episode of diarrhoea, compared to 52% in the vaccine group. No significant group differences were found with regard to incidence, duration or severity of all caused TD or ETEC-associated TD. However, ETEC-associated TD occurred earlier in the placebo group (median 5 days), compared to the vaccine group (median 15 days). In conclusion, CVD 103-HgR live oral cholera vaccine failed to provide a 50% protection against TD. This study does not exclude that the vaccine may offer a short-lived protection against ETEC-associated TD. However, the power of the study was limited by the unexpected low incidence of LT-ETEC-associated diarrhoea (9% of all TD) compared to ST-associated TD (24% of all TD).",M2
15780724,"Policymakers' views regarding the introduction of new-generation vaccines against typhoid fever, shigellosis and <e>cholera</e> in Asia.Face-to-face interviews and meetings with more than 160 policymakers and other influential professionals in seven large Asian countries (Bangladesh, China, India, Indonesia, Pakistan, Thailand and Vietnam) were conducted to survey opinions regarding the need for, and potential uses of new-generation vaccines against cholera, typhoid fever and shigellosis. Despite several barriers to their uptake--notably uncertainty of the burden of enteric diseases; preference for water, sanitation and other environmental improvements over vaccination for disease control; and high prices of the current vaccines relative to basic EPI vaccines, and their moderate protection levels--considerable interest was found in the targeted use of Vi typhoid vaccine in most countries, followed by (future) Shigella and oral cholera vaccines. The introduction of these vaccines in Asia could be greatly facilitated by country-specific evidence of disease burden, local or regional vaccine production, field studies demonstrating their safety and efficacy in local populations, evidence of potential economic savings from vaccination, and effective dissemination of research results to all those who make or influence immunization policy.",M2

The relative efficiencies of one, two, and three vaginal doses of recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) in generating mucosal and systemic immune responses in healthy women were evaluated, and the kinetics of the immune responses were monitored for responding volunteers for up to 12 months after the last vaccination. A single dose of CTB failed to generate CTB-specific IgA antibody responses in cervical secretions. Two vaccinations induced significant increases in IgA antitoxin titers in seven of nine volunteers, and four volunteers also developed IgG antitoxin responses. The magnitudes of the responses were 20-fold for IgA antitoxin and 7.1-fold for IgG antitoxin. A third vaccination did not significantly increase the antitoxin responses, although the frequency of IgG responses was slightly higher than that after the second vaccination. In serum, CTB-specific antibodies were observed already after a single vaccination. However, two vaccinations were required to induce marked IgA as well as IgG antitoxin titer increases in the majority of volunteers. The postvaccination levels of antitoxin antibodies in serum were comparable after two and three vaccinations. At 12 months after vaccination, significantly elevated IgA and IgG antitoxin levels in cervical secretions could still be detected in approximately half of the volunteers who had initially responded to the vaccine. Antitoxin titer increases in serum were found in most of the vaccinees at follow-up.",M2

Intranasal immunization of mice with strains producing Ag2/PRA induced serum vibriocidal antibody and Ag2/PRA-specific total IgG responses in outbred Swiss Webster and inbred BALB/c mice. Analysis of IgG subclasses showed a predominance of IgG2a subclass antibodies. Lymphocytes from immunized mice stimulated with pure Ag2/PRA showed a significant proliferative response with production of interferon-gamma. Positive selection for plasmid maintenance in vivo did not enhance immune response to Ag2/PRA.

15322194,"The <e>cholera</e> toxin-derived CTA1-DD vaccine adjuvant administered intranasally does not cause inflammation or accumulate in the nervous tissues.Although highly effective, the use of GM1-receptor binding holotoxins as nasal mucosal adjuvants has recently been cautioned due to the risk for their accumulation in the brain and other nervous tissues. Therefore we have explored the efficacy of the CTA1-DD adjuvant for its ability to enhance nasal immune responses in mice. We found that despite the lack of a mucosal binding element, the B cell-targeted CTA1-DD molecule was an equally strong adjuvant as cholera toxin (CT). The potency of CTA1-DD was not a result of endotoxin contamination because more than a 50-fold higher dose of LPS was needed to achieve a similar enhancement. Moreover, the adjuvant effect was TLR4-independent and absent in mutant CTA1-E112K-DD, lacking enzymatic activity. The CTA1-DD adjuvant augmented germinal center formations and T cell priming in the draining lymph nodes, and contrary to CT, promoted a balanced Th1/Th2 response with little effect on IgE Ab production. CTA1-DD did not induce inflammatory changes in the nasal mucosa, and most importantly did not bind to or accumulate in the nervous tissues of the olfactory bulb, whereas CT bound avidly to the nervous tissues. We believe that the nontoxic CTA1-DD adjuvant is an attractive solution to the current dilemma between efficacy and toxicity encountered in CT-holotoxin adjuvant or Escherichia coli heat-labile toxin-holotoxin adjuvant strategies and provides a safe and promising candidate to be included in future vaccines for intranasal administration.",M2
15161075,"Comparison of different routes of vaccination for eliciting antibody responses in the human stomach.Determination of optimal routes to induce mucosal immune responses locally in the stomach and duodenum are important steps in the development of vaccines against Helicobacter pylori infection. In this study, we immunized H. pylori-infected individuals either nasally or rectally with a model antigen, i.e. <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit, and compared the immune responses after these routes with the responses after oral or intrajejunal vaccination. Specific antibody levels in serum as well as specific antibody levels and antibody-secreting cells in biopsies from antrum and duodenum were determined by ELISA and ELISPOT methods. In contrast to oral vaccination, nasal and rectal vaccination did not induce significant increases in specific antibody-secreting cells either in the antrum or duodenum. Furthermore, when analyzing the antibody levels in saponin extracted biopsies, intrajejunal vaccination was superior to both nasal and rectal vaccination in inducing antigen-specific IgA levels in the stomach. We conclude that oral vaccination is the optimal route for induction of antigen-specific IgA antibody responses in the stomach and duodenum of humans, while nasal or rectal vaccination is less suitable for this purpose.",M2

14965834,"Dynamics of intestinal flora after oral vaccination with inactivated whole-cell/recombinant B subunit O139 <e>cholera</e> vaccine.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the change of intestinal flora in subjects receiving oral vaccination with inactivated whole-cell/recombinant B subunit (WC/rBS) O139 cholera vaccine made in China. METHODS: The fecal smears of 5 groups of subjects receiving the vaccine were collected before and 2 and 3 months after the vaccination to examine the distribution of the intestinal flora. RESULTS: In the 458 specimens examined, the total amount of bacteria and percentages of G+b, G+c and G-c were decreased whereas the amount of G-b significantly increased after vaccination. Compared with the placebo control group, the vaccinated groups exhibited significant changes in G+b and G-c, which also varied significantly between the group receiving 3 doses of WC/rBS vaccine and the other vaccinated groups. The vaccination produced distinct changes in the percentage of the intestinal flora at different time points, showing the most obvious effect on G-b. Oral vaccination was shown to affect the percentage of the intestinal flora very likely through its effect on the amount of G-b. The percentages of G+b, G-b and G-c varied significantly between male and female subjects after vaccination. CONCLUSION: Oral vaccination with WC/rBS affects the intestinal flora in human, and the mechanism as well as the implications needs to be further explored.",M2
14742547,"Mucosal vaccination increases endothelial expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 in the human gastrointestinal tract.Homing of leukocytes to various tissues is dependent on the interaction between homing receptors on leukocytes and their ligands, addressins, on endothelial cells. Mucosal immunization results in homing of antigen-specific lymphocytes back to the mucosa where they first encountered the antigen. However, it is unknown whether this homing of antigen-specific cells is mediated by an altered endothelial addressin expression after vaccination. Using different immunization routes with an oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine, we show that the endothelial expression of mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1) is increased in the gastric and upper small intestinal mucosae after immunization through various local routes in the upper gastrointestinal tract. In contrast, rectal immunization did not influence the levels of MAdCAM-1 in the gastric or duodenal mucosa. Furthermore, we show that MAdCAM-1 can be induced on human endothelial cells by tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and gamma interferon. The vaccine component cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) increased MAdCAM-1 expression on endothelial cells in cultured human gastric explants, an effect that seemed to be mediated by TNF-alpha. In conclusion, MAdCAM-1 expression is increased in the upper gastrointestinal tract after local immunizations with a vaccine containing CTB. This strongly suggests the involvement of MAdCAM-1 in the preferential homing of mucosal lymphocytes to their original site of activation.",M2
14670323,"Suppressive effect of zinc on antibody response to <e>cholera</e> toxin in children given the killed, B subunit-whole cell, oral cholera vaccine.In a previous study, children aged 2-5 years old in Bangladesh were supplemented orally with a single dose of Vitamin A (200,000 IU) and a placebo for zinc (zinc equivalent to 20 mg of elemental zinc) everyday for 42 days (group A), zinc and a placebo for Vitamin A (group Z), zinc and Vitamin A (group AZ) or both placebos (group P). All children were orally immunised with two doses of the killed cholera vaccine containing whole cells and a recombinant B subunit of cholera toxin (CT). The number of children who responded with &gt; or = 4-fold vibriocidal antibody (a proxy indicator of protection against cholera) was significantly greater among the zinc-supplemented groups than among the non-zinc-supplemented groups, while Vitamin A supplementation did not appear to have any effect. The sera from these children were assayed for antibody to CT. Antibody to CT is known to exert a synergistic protective effect against cholera in animal studies, and offer significantly higher short-term protection against cholera and significant short-term protection against enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli diarrhoea in humans on oral immunisation with the cholera vaccine. Children who received zinc had significantly reduced levels of serum antibodies to CT than children who received placebos only. Factorial analysis showed a trend for zinc showing a reduction in the number of children responding with CT-antibody, while Vitamin A did not appear to have any effect. Thus, zinc enhanced vibriocidal antibody response, but suppressed CT-antibody response, suggesting that zinc supplementation has different modulating effects on vibriocidal antibody response and CT-antibody response.",M2
14645284,"Novel type of specialized transduction for CTX phi or its satellite phage RS1 mediated by filamentous phage VGJ phi in Vibrio cholerae.The main virulence factor of Vibrio cholerae, the <e>cholera</e> toxin, is encoded by the ctxAB operon, which is contained in the genome of the lysogenic filamentous phage CTX phi. This phage transmits ctxAB genes between V. cholerae bacterial populations that express toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), the CTX phi receptor. In investigating new forms of ctxAB transmission, we found that V. cholerae filamentous phage VGJ phi, which uses the mannose-sensitive hemagglutinin (MSHA) pilus as a receptor, transmits CTX phi or its satellite phage RS1 by an efficient and highly specific TCP-independent mechanism. This is a novel type of specialized transduction consisting in the site-specific cointegration of VGJ phi and CTX phi (or RS1) replicative forms to produce a single hybrid molecule, which generates a single-stranded DNA hybrid genome that is packaged into hybrid viral particles designated HybP phi (for the VGJ phi/CTX phi hybrid) and HybRS phi (for the VGJ phi/RS1 hybrid). The hybrid phages replicate by using the VGJ phi replicating functions and use the VGJ phi capsid, retaining the ability to infect via MSHA. The hybrid phages infect most tested strains more efficiently than CTX phi, even under in vitro optimal conditions for TCP expression. Infection and lysogenization with HybP phi revert the V. cholerae live attenuated vaccine strain 1333 to virulence. Our results reinforce that TCP is not indispensable for the acquisition of CTX phi. Thus, we discuss an alternative to the current accepted evolutionary model for the emergence of new toxigenic strains of V. cholerae and the importance of our findings for the development of an environmentally safer live attenuated cholera vaccine.",M2

Strain 638 was highly immunogenic when inoculated to adult Swiss mice by the intranasal route as judged by the induction of a strong serum vibriocidal antibody response. A side-by-side comparison of strain 638 with its isogenic hapA(+) precursor (strain 81) in the above model indicated that inactivation of hapA does not affect immunogenicity. The spherule-associated antigen 2/proline-rich antigen (Ag2/PRA) of Coccidioides immitis has been shown to protect mice against coccidioidomycosis to an extent dependent on the modes of antigen presentation and challenge with C. immitis arthrospores. In this work, we demonstrate the use of a live genetically attenuated V. cholerae strain to deliver Ag2/PRA. Ag2/PRA was expressed in 638 as a fusion protein with the Escherichia coli heat labile toxin B subunit leader peptide using the strong Tac promoter. The recombinant Ag2/PRA was efficiently expressed, processed and secreted to the periplasmic space. Intranasal immunizations of adult mice with strain 638 expressing Ag2/PRA induced serum vibriocidal antibody response to the vector strain and serum total IgG response to Ag2/PRA. Strain 638 expressing PRA could be recovered from trachea and lung up to 20h after immunization but was effectively cleared 72h post-inoculation.",M2

Following mass immunization of schoolchildren in Ca Mau City using an oral bivalent killed cholera vaccine, adverse reactions were noted. METHODS: Salient data were collected in a systematic fashion including the review of medical records; interview of the school principal, teachers, students, parents and doctors; and review of the storage and handling of the vaccine. FINDINGS: On 18 December 2001, 234 children at a primary school in Ca Mau City received the cholera vaccine. Within 1h of immunization, three children in one of the classrooms complained of trembling, nausea and headache and were brought to the library and soon other children followed. Out of 234, 97 (42%) pupils were affected and brought to the Municipal Health Center or Ca Mau Provincial Hospital. Those who were affected were younger (mean age=9.6 years; 95% CI=9.4-9.7) compared to those who were not affected (mean age=10 years; 95% CI=9.7-10.3; t-test=-2.4; P-value=0.02). The proportion of affected females among those who had received the vaccine (49/114 or 43%) was similar to the proportion in males (48/120 or 40%; RR=1.07; 95% CI=0.79-1.46). The most frequent presenting complaint was cold extremities (60%) followed by headache (27%). All affected children recovered and were discharged in a few hours. None reported any sequelae or relapse. Once the situation was recognized, the cholera immunization campaign was continued. Laboratory tests of vaccine samples from the same batch detected no abnormality or contaminating agent. DISCUSSION: The findings suggest that the children at primary school number 1 suffered from a mass psychogenic illness. This incident was unusual in that a similar number of boys and girls were affected, in contrast to the frequently reported preponderance of female cases. Furthermore the underlying cause was very quickly diagnosed, medical interventions were kept to a minimum, and no relapse was observed. Future vaccination campaigns have to assure that the families are informed in advance.",M2

Total protein from the transgenic leaf tissue was isolated and an aliquot containing 5 microg recombinant CTB was injected intradermally into Balb/c (H2K(d)) mice. CTB-specific serum IgG was detected in animals that had been administered plant-expressed or native purified CTB. A T-cell proliferation study using splenocytes and cytokine estimations in supernatants generated by in vitro stimulation of macrophages isolated from the immuno-primed animals was carried out. Inhibition of proliferation of T lymphocytes was observed in splenic T lymphocytes isolated from animals injected with either native or plant-expressed CTB. Macrophages isolated from mice immunised with native or plant-expressed CTB showed enhanced secretion of interleukin-10 but secretion of lipopolysaccharide-induced interleukin-12 and tumor necrosis factor alpha was inhibited. These studies suggest that plant-expressed protein behaved like native CTB with regards to effects on T-cell proliferation and cytokine levels, indicating the suitability of plant expression systems for the production of bacterial antigens, which could be used as edible vaccine.

Hydrophobic residue F223 in the A subunit of CT (CTA) as well as residues 174, L77, and T78 in the B subunit of CT (CTB) were replaced individually with aspartic acid, and the resulting CTA and CTB variants were analyzed for their ability to assemble into holotoxin in vivo. CTA-F223D holotoxin exhibited decreased stability and toxicity and increased susceptibility to proteolysis by trypsin. CTB-L77D was unable to form functional pentamers. CTB-I74D and CTB-T78D formed pentamers that bound to GM(1) and D-galactose but failed to assemble with CTA to form holotoxin. In contrast, CTB-T78D and CTA-F223H interacted with each other to form a significant amount of holotoxin in vivo. Our findings support the importance of hydrophobic interactions between CTA and CTB in holotoxin assembly. We also developed an efficient method for assembly of CT in vitro, and we showed that CT assembled in vitro was comparable to wild-type CT in toxicity and antigenicity. CTB-I74D and CTB-T78D did not form pentamers or holotoxin in vitro, and CTA-F223D did not form holotoxin in vitro. The efficient system for in vitro assembly of CT described here should be useful for future studies on the development of drugs to inhibit CT assembly as well as the development of chimeric CT-like molecules as potential vaccine candidates.",M2

The 30 participants were immunized twice, with a 17-day interval. The vaccinees in the intervention group ingested 45 mg of elemental zinc thrice daily for 9 days starting 2 days before each vaccine dose. The median serum anti-CTB immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG responses from day 0 to day 30, i.e. after two vaccine doses, were 13-fold lower (P value for identical distribution, &lt;0.005) in the zinc-supplemented compared to the nonsupplemented vaccinees. The median serum vibriocidal responses from baseline to after one (day 0 to day 17) and two (day 0 to day 30) vaccine doses were at least sixfold (P = 0.033) and fourfold (P = 0.091) higher, while the median fecal anti-CTB IgA response after two doses was estimated to be fourfold higher (P = 0.084) in the zinc-supplemented vaccinees. These observations show that zinc reduces the antitoxin and may enhance the antibacterial responses in serum. Zinc may also improve the intestinal antitoxin immune response. Oral zinc administration has the potential to modify critical immune responses to antigens applied to mucosal surfaces.",M2

The study was carried out in a double blinded, placebo controlled design in 158 children, 18-36 months of age. Children were given two doses of the CF-BS-ETEC vaccine or the placebo which consisted of E. coli K12. The vaccine was well tolerated. The immune response was studied in 60 children (30 each in the placebo and vaccine group). Significant vaccine specific IgA antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses were seen 7 days after ingestion of the first and second dose of the vaccine. The responses to CFA/I (P&lt;or=0.001), CS2 (P=0.021), CS4 (P=0.009) and rCTB (P&lt;or=0.001) were elevated in the vaccines in comparison to the pre-immune values and in comparison to those seen in the placebo recipients (P=0.018 to &lt;0.001). Vaccines but not placebo recipients also showed significantly increased IgM ASC responses to all three CF antigens that were tested (P=0.012 to &lt;0.001) and IgG-ASCs to rCTB (P&lt;0.001). Peak ASC levels were reached after one dose of the vaccine with no further increase or decrease after the second dose.

The average size of the microspheres was less than 5 microns, the amount of OMP encapsulated in microspheres was 15.3%. It was found that microspheres were taken up in Peyer's patches and then distributed in spleen, liver and mesenteric lymph nodes after oral administration.",M2

The results showed the optimal expressing condition of TCP was in AKI or CFA medium, at 30 C for 24-36 h with stationary cultivation. The molecular weight of the TCP subunit protein measured by sodium dodecyl sulfate-poly acrylamide gel electrophoresis was about 20.5 kd. By using mouse anti-TCP monoclone antibody and sheep anti-mouse IgG-HRP antibody, the TCP was confirmed by dot blot immunoassay. Rabbit immune serum of TCP purified from O139 strain agglutinated both O139 biotype and El Tor biotype Vibrio cholera strains. These indicate that TCP may be an effective and protective antigen to conduct the preparation of V. cholera vaccine.",M2
12077289,"Differential induction of mucosal and systemic antibody responses in women after nasal, rectal, or vaginal immunization: influence of the menstrual cycle.A <e>cholera</e> vaccine containing killed vibrios and cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) was used to compare mucosal immunization routes for induction of systemic and mucosal Ab. Four groups of women were given three monthly immunizations by the rectal immunization (R(imm)) route, nasal immunization (N(imm)) route, or vaginal immunization route during either the follicular (V-FP(imm)) or luteal (V-LP(imm)) menstrual cycle phase. N(imm) was performed with 10-fold less vaccine to determine if administration of less Ag by this route can, as in rodents, produce mucosal Ab responses comparable to those induced by higher dose R(imm) or vaginal immunization. Concentrations of Ab induced in sera and secretions were measured by ELISA. None of these routes produced durable salivary Ab responses. N(imm) induced greatest levels of CTB-specific IgG in sera. R(imm) failed to generate CTB-specific IgA in genital tract secretions. N(imm), V-FP(imm), and V-LP(imm) all produced cervical CTB-specific IgA responses comparable in magnitude and frequency. However, only V-FP(imm) induced cervical IgA2-restricted Ab to the bacterial LPS vaccine component. V-FP(imm), but not V-LP(imm), also induced CTB-specific IgA in rectal secretions. N(imm) was superior to V-FP(imm) for producing rectal CTB-specific IgA, but the greatest amounts of CTB-specific IgA and LPS-specific IgA, IgG, and IgM Ab were found in rectal secretions of R(imm) women. These data suggest that in women, N(imm) alone could induce specific Ab in serum, the genital tract, and rectum. However, induction of genital tract and rectal Ab responses of the magnitude generated by local V-FP(imm) or R(imm) will likely require administration of comparably high nasal vaccine dosages.",M2
12034098,"Comparison of mucosal and systemic humoral immune responses after transcutaneous and oral immunization strategies.In order to compare the ability of transcutaneous and oral immunization strategies to induce mucosal and systemic immune responses, we inoculated mice transcutaneously with <e>cholera</e> toxin (CT) or the non-toxic B subunit of cholera toxin (CtxB), or orally with Peru2(pETR1), an attenuated vaccine strain of Vibrio cholerae expressing CtxB. In addition, we also evaluated dual immunization regimens (oral inoculation with transcutaneous boosting, and transcutaneous immunization with oral boosting) in an attempt to optimize induction of both mucosal and systemic immune responses. We found that transcutaneous immunization with purified CtxB or CT induces much more prominent systemic IgG anti-CtxB responses than does oral inoculation with a vaccine vector strain of V. cholerae expressing CtxB. In comparison, anti-CtxB IgA in serum, stool and bile were comparable in mice either transcutaneously or orally immunized. Overall, the most prominent systemic and mucosal anti-CtxB responses occurred in mice that were orally primed with Peru2(pETR1) and transcutaneously boosted with CT. Our results suggest that combination oral and transcutaneous immunization strategies may most prominently induce both mucosal and systemic humoral responses.",M2
11895960,"Randomized, controlled human challenge study of the safety, immunogenicity, and protective efficacy of a single dose of Peru-15, a live attenuated oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine.Peru-15 is a live attenuated oral vaccine derived from a Vibrio cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain by a series of deletions and modifications, including deletion of the entire CT genetic element. Peru-15 is also a stable, motility-defective strain and is unable to recombine with homologous DNA. We wished to determine whether a single oral dose of Peru-15 was safe and immunogenic and whether it would provide significant protection against moderate and severe diarrhea in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled human volunteer cholera challenge model. A total of 59 volunteers were randomly allocated to groups to receive either 2 x 10(8) CFU of reconstituted, lyophilized Peru-15 vaccine diluted in CeraVacx buffer or placebo (CeraVacx buffer alone). Approximately 3 months after vaccination, 36 of these volunteers were challenged with approximately 10(5) CFU of virulent V. cholerae O1 El Tor Inaba strain N16961, prepared from a standardized frozen inoculum. Among vaccinees, 98% showed at least a fourfold increase in vibriocidal antibody titers. After challenge, 5 (42%) of the 12 placebo recipients and none (0%) of the 24 vaccinees had moderate or severe diarrhea (&gt; or = 3,000 g of diarrheal stool) (P = 0.002; protective efficacy, 100%; lower one-sided 95% confidence limit, 75%). A total of 7 (58%) of the 12 placebo recipients and 1 (4%) of the 24 vaccinees had any diarrhea (P &lt; 0.001; protective efficacy, 93%; lower one-sided 95% confidence limit, 62%). The total number of diarrheal stools, weight of diarrheal stools, incidence of fever, and peak stool V. cholerae excretion among vaccinees were all significantly lower than in placebo recipients. Peru-15 is a well-tolerated and immunogenic oral cholera vaccine that affords protective efficacy against life-threatening cholera diarrhea in a human volunteer challenge model. This vaccine may therefore be a safe and effective tool to prevent cholera in travelers and is a strong candidate for further evaluation to prevent cholera in an area where cholera is endemic.",M2
11705949,"Immune response genes modulate serologic responses to Vibrio cholerae TcpA pilin peptides.<e>Cholera</e> is an enteric disease caused by Vibrio cholerae. Toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP), a type 4 pilus expressed by V. cholerae, is a cholera virulence factor that is required for host colonization. The TCP polymer is composed of subunits of TcpA pilin. Antibodies directed against TcpA are protective in animal models of cholera. While natural or recombinant forms of TcpA are difficult to purify to homogeneity, it is anticipated that synthesized TcpA peptides might serve as immunogens in a subunit vaccine. We wanted to assess the potential for effects of the immune response (Ir) gene that could complicate a peptide-based vaccine. Using a panel of mice congenic at the H-2 locus we tested the immunogenicity of TcpA peptide sequences (peptides 4 to 6) found in the carboxyl termini of both the classical (Cl) and El Tor (ET) biotypes of TCP. Cl peptides have been shown to be immunogenic in CD-1 mice. Our data clearly establish that there are effects of the Ir gene associated with both biotypes of TcpA. These effects are dynamic and dependent on the biotype of TcpA and the haplotypes of the host. In addition to the effects of the classic class II Ir gene, class I (D, L) or nonclassical class I (Qa-2) may also affect immune responses to TcpA peptides. To overcome the effects of the class II Ir gene, multiple TcpA peptides similar to peptides 4, 5, and 6 could be used in a subunit vaccine formulation. Identification of the most protective B-cell epitopes of TcpA within a particular peptide and conjugation to a universal carrier may be the most effective method to eliminate the effects of the class II and class I Ir genes.",M2

It is not a strong immunogen when delivered in the context of whole cells, yet pilus subunits or TcpA derivative synthetic peptides induce protective responses. We examined the efficacy of immunizing mice with TCP conjugated to anti-class II monoclonal antibodies (MAb) with or without the addition of cholera toxin (CT) or anti-CD40 MAb to determine if the serologic response to TcpA could be manipulated. Anti-class II MAb-targeted TCP influenced the anti-TCP peptide serologic response with respect to titer and isotype. Responses to TcpA peptide 4 were induced with class II MAb-targeted TCP and not with nontargeted TCP. Class II MAb-targeting TcpA reduced the response to peptide 6 compared to the nontargeted TCP response. Class II MAb-targeted TcpA, if delivered with CT, enhanced the serologic response to TcpA peptides. The effectiveness of the combination of targeted TCP and CT was reduced if anti-CD40 MAb were included in the primary immunization.

11559649,"Homing commitment of lymphocytes activated in the human gastric and intestinal mucosa.BACKGROUND: Gastric infection with the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori results in a large accumulation of IgA and IgM secreting cells in the gastric mucosa. The molecular mechanisms resulting in B cell migration to the gastric mucosa in H pylori infection are however not known. AIMS: To examine expression of the mucosal homing receptor integrin alpha4beta7 and the homing receptor for secondary lymphoid tissues, L-selectin, on lymphocytes activated by gastric, intestinal, or systemic antigens. Furthermore, to examine gastric expression of the mucosal addressin cellular adhesion molecule 1 (MAdCAM-1), the endothelial counter-receptor to integrin alpha4beta7. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: H pylori infected individuals were immunised by either gastric (n=8) or intestinal (n=8) delivery of an inactivated <e>cholera</e> vaccine. The resulting circulating vaccine specific B cells were sorted according to alpha4beta7 and L-selectin expression and assayed for production of IgA and IgG using an enzyme linked immunospot assay. In addition, circulating CD4+ T cells from seven H pylori infected individuals were fractionated according to alpha4beta7 and L-selectin expression. The resulting T cell fractions were then assayed for specific proliferation against H pylori or the systemic antigen tetanus toxoid. Finally, gastric expression of MAdCAM-1 was determined by immunohistochemistry in H pylori infected (n=16) and uninfected (n=8) individuals. RESULTS: Virtually all B cells induced by both gastric and intestinal antigen delivery expressed alpha4beta7 whereas less then half coexpressed L-selectin. Furthermore, H pylori reactive T cells were mainly found in the alpha4beta7+L-selectin+ T cell fraction whereas tetanus specific T cells were largely alpha4beta7-L-selectin+. MAdCAM-1 was present in similar amounts in gastric mucosa from H pylori infected and uninfected individuals. CONCLUSIONS: B cells and T cells activated by antigens delivered to the gastric mucosa express the mucosal homing receptor integrin alpha4beta7, as do cells activated in the intestine. Together with the observation that gastric endothelial cells express MAdCAM-1, this may partly explain the homing of lymphocytes activated in the stomach or in the small intestine to the gastric mucosa.",M2
11559648,"Human gastric B cell responses can be induced by intestinal immunisation.BACKGROUND: In a previous study, we found that oral vaccination induces strong B cell responses in the stomach of Helicobacter pylori infected but not of uninfected individuals. In this study, we have evaluated the possibility of inducing gastric immune responses in H pylori infected volunteers by intestinal and gastric immunisation. METHODS: H pylori infected subjects were given two doses of an inactivated <e>cholera</e> vaccine, either intestinally via an endoscope approximately 30 cm distal to the pylorus sphincter or intragastrically as small droplets applied directly onto the stomach mucosa. Uninfected individuals received the vaccine by standard oral procedure. Vaccine specific antibody secreting cells in antral and duodenal biopsies were detected by the enzyme linked immunospot assay technique before and seven days after the second immunisation. RESULTS: Intestinal immunisations resulted in induction of vaccine specific gastric IgA secreting cells in five of eight volunteers. This immunisation schedule also gave rise to specific duodenal antibody secreting cells in seven of eight individuals. Local gastric immunisation resulted in the induction of specific B cells in the gastric mucosa of four of eight volunteers. Gastric antigen application also resulted in B cell responses in the duodenum in all volunteers. Uninfected volunteers receiving the vaccine perorally responded in the duodenum but not in the stomach. CONCLUSIONS: H pylori infection increases the ability of the gastric mucosa to serve as an expression site for intestinally induced B cell responses. These findings are of importance when designing a therapeutic H pylori vaccine, and based on our results such a vaccine can be delivered along the whole upper gastrointestinal tract.",M2
11553546,"Diminished diarrheal response to Vibrio cholerae strains carrying the replicative form of the CTX(Phi) genome instead of CTX(Phi) lysogens in adult rabbits.Toxigenic Vibrio cholerae strains are lysogens of CTX(Phi), a filamentous bacteriophage which encodes <e>cholera</e> toxin (CT). Following infection of recipient V. cholerae cells by CTX(Phi), the phage genome either integrates into the host chromosome at a specific attachment site (attRS) or exists as a replicative-form (RF) plasmid. We infected naturally occurring attRS-negative nontoxigenic V. cholerae or attenuated (CTX(-) attRS negative) derivatives of wild-type toxigenic strains with CTX(Phi) and examined the diarrheagenic potential of the strains carrying the RF of the CTX(Phi) genome using the adult rabbit diarrhea model. Under laboratory conditions, strains carrying the RF of CTX(Phi) produced more CT than corresponding lysogens as assayed by a G(M1)-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and by fluid accumulation in ligated ileal loops of rabbits. However, when tested for diarrhea in rabbits, the attRS-negative strains (which carried the CTX(Phi) genome as the RF) were either negative or produced mild diarrhea, whereas the attRS-positive strains with integrated CTX(Phi) produced severe fatal diarrhea. Analysis of the strains after intestinal passage showed that the attRS-negative strains lost the phage genome at approximately a fivefold higher frequency than under in vitro conditions, and 75 to 90% of cells recovered from challenged rabbits after 24 h were CT negative. These results suggested that strains carrying the RF of CTX(Phi) are unable to cause severe disease due to rapid loss of the phage in vivo, and the gastrointestinal environment thus provides selection of toxigenic strains with an integrated CTX(Phi) genome. These results may have implications for the development of live V. cholerae vaccine candidates impaired in chromosomal integration of CTX(Phi). These findings may also contribute to understanding of the etiology of diarrhea occasionally associated with nontoxigenic V. cholerae strains.",M2

11395206,"Cost of immunization with a locally produced, oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine in Viet Nam.Policy decisions regarding whether to incorporate new vaccines into routine public health practice in developing countries will depend in part on the costs of vaccine purchase and of vaccine delivery. In March, 1997, a large-scale effectiveness trial of a locally produced, orally administered bivalent vaccine against Vibrio cholerae 01 and 0139 began in Viet Nam. Empirical data obtained from the trial was used to determine the costs of the immunization campaign from the government perspective. The study population, including the children less than one year of age and pregnant women who were ineligible for immunization, was 353926. A total of 289041 persons received two doses of vaccine, and 13340 persons received one dose of vaccine. Two-dose vaccine coverage was 83.4%. The total cost of vaccine delivery during the immunization campaign was $66527. The cost of each dose of vaccine was $0.31. Therefore, the total cost of the immunization campaign was $0.44 per dose administered, and $0.91 per fully immunized person. Attempts to reduce the cost per dose of vaccine (e.g. the use of a monovalent vaccine against serogroup 01) are likely to have a large impact on the cost of future similar immunization campaigns.",M2

11329444,"Development of a novel in vitro assay (ALS assay) for evaluation of vaccine-induced antibody secretion from circulating mucosal lymphocytes.We describe here a novel method for measuring in vitro antibody secretion from the tissue culture of human B lymphocytes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) after oral vaccination with a killed <e>cholera</e> vaccine. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) titers of the antibody secreted in the cell supernatant were determined. The validation results demonstrated that human PBMC remained viable and continued to secrete antibodies (total immunoglobulin A [IgA] and IgG) for up to 4 days of incubation at 37 degrees C with 5% CO(2) in cell cultures. The secreted antibody concentration correlated positively with the PBMC concentration and incubation time in the tissue culture and correlated negatively with the storage time of the whole blood at room temperature. In vitro assay of secreting antibody in the lymphocyte supernatant (i.e., the ALS assay) is capable of the detecting specific antibody response after oral vaccination with a killed whole-cell-plus-B-subunit cholera vaccine (WC-B) in healthy adults in a phase I clinical trial. Postimmunization PBMC secreted antibodies to cholera toxin in the cell supernatants. Antibody production did not require any in vitro antigen stimulation. In the ALS assay, antigen-specific antibody titers of prevaccination samples were barely detectable, whereas serum antitoxin ELISA titers in background of prevaccine samples were significantly higher than the ALS titers. We conclude that, without any in vitro antigen stimulation after vaccination, PBMC secrete antibodies into the supernatants in the ALS assay. This assay can quantitatively measure the antigen-specific antibody production from the PBMC culture in postvaccination blood samples.",M2
11294508,"Evaluation of synthetic schemes to prepare immunogenic conjugates of Vibrio cholerae O139 capsular polysaccharide with chicken serum albumin.Vibrio cholerae serotype O139 is a new etiologic agent of epidemic <e>cholera</e>. There is no vaccine available against cholera caused by this serotype. V. cholerae O139 is an encapsulated bacterium, and its polysaccharide capsule is an essential virulent factor and likely protective antigen. This study evaluated several synthetic schemes for preparation of conjugates of V. cholerae O139 capsular polysaccharide (CPS) with chicken serum albumin as the carrier protein (CSA) using 1-ethyl-3(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) or 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) as activating agents. Four conjugates described here as representative of many experiments were synthesized in 2 steps: 1) preparation of adipic acid hydrazide derivative of CPS (CPS(AH)) or of CSA (CSA(AH)), and 2) binding of CPS(AH) to CSA or of CPS to CSA(AH). Although all conjugates induced CPS antibodies, the conjugate prepared by EDC-mediated binding of CPS and CSA(AH) (EDC:CPS-CSA(AH)) was statistically significantly less immunogenic than the other three conjugates. Representative sera from mice injected with these three conjugates contained antibodies that mediated the lysis of V. cholerae O139 inoculum. Evaluation of the different synthetic schemes and reaction conditions in relation to the immunogenicity of the resultant conjugates provided the basis for the preparation of a V. cholerae O139 conjugate vaccine with a medically useful carrier protein such as diphtheria toxin mutant.",M2
11119564,"Differential interleukin-8 response of intestinal epithelial cell line to reactogenic and nonreactogenic candidate vaccine strains of Vibrio cholerae.In this study, we analyzed whether attachment of Vibrio cholerae vaccine strains to human intestinal epithelial cells can induce an interleukin-8 (IL-8) response. The IL-8 transcripts were detected by PCR amplification of reverse-transcribed mRNA, and the gene product secretion was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Infection of monolayers of the undifferentiated HT29-18N2 cell line with reactogenic (JBK70 and 81) and nonreactogenic (CVD103HgR and 638) vaccine strains of V. cholerae resulted in markedly higher IL-8 expression by epithelial cells exposed to reactogenic strains than by cells exposed to the nonreactogenic strains. Additionally, epithelial cells produced IL-8 transcripts following stimulation with <e>cholera</e> vaccine strains in a concentration-dependent manner. These results represent a new insight into the inflammatory component of reactogenicity and could be used as a predictive marker of vaccine reactogenicity prior to human testing.",M2
11115709,"Preparation and preclinical evaluation of experimental group B streptococcus type III polysaccharide-<e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit conjugate vaccine for intranasal immunization.Streptococcus group B (GBS) is usually carried asymptomatically in the vaginal tract of women and can be transferred to the newborn during parturition. Serum antibodies to the capsular polysaccharide (CPS) can prevent invasive diseases, whereas immunity acting at the mucosal surface may be more important to inhibit the mucosal colonization of GBS and thus the risk of infection for the newborn. We prepared different GBS type III CPS-protein conjugate vaccines and evaluated their systemic and mucosal immunogenicity in mice. GBS type III CPS was conjugated to tetanus toxoid (TT) or recombinant cholera toxin B subunit (rCTB) either directly or to rCTB indirectly via TT. The conjugation was performed by different methods: (1) CPS was coupled to TT with 1-ethyl-3 (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-carbodiimide (EDAC), using adipic acid dihydrazide (ADH) as a spacer; (2) CPS was conjugated with rCTB using reductive amination; or, (3) N-succinimidyl 3-(2-pyridyldithio) propionate (SPDP) was used to bind rCTB to the TT of the CPS-TT conjugate. Mice were immunized with these conjugates or purified CPS by subcutaneous (s.c.) and intranasal (i. n.) routes. Antibodies to GBS III in serum, lungs and vagina were measured with ELISA. All of the CPS-protein conjugates were superior to unconjugated CPS in eliciting CPS-specific immune responses in serum and mucosal tissue extracts. The conjugates, when administrated s.c., induced only IgG responses in serum, lung and vagina, while i.n. vaccination also elicited IgA responses in the lungs and vagina. The CPS-TT conjugate administrated i.n. induced a strong serum IgG, but only a weak mucosal IgA response, while the CPS-rCTB conjugate elicited high IgG as well as IgA antibodies in the lungs after i.n. immunization. GBS III CPS-TT conjugated with rCTB produced a strong systemic and local anti-CPSIII response after i.n. administration. Co-administration of CT as adjuvant enhanced the anti-CPS systemic and mucosal immune responses further after i.n. administration with the CPS conjugates. These findings indicate that: (i) i.n. immunization with GBS CPS-protein conjugates was more effective than s.c immunization for stimulating serum as well as mucosal immune responses; (ii) rCTB as a carrier protein for GBS III CPS could markedly improve the mucosal immune response; and (iii) the experimental GBS type III CPS conjugates containing rCTB should be investigated as mucosal vaccine to prevent GBS infection in humans.",M2
11045998,"Cutting edge: the mucosal adjuvant <e>cholera</e> toxin redirects vaccine proteins into olfactory tissues.We tested the notion that the mucosal adjuvant cholera toxin (CT) could target, in addition to nasal-associated lymphoreticular tissues, the olfactory nerves/epithelium (ON/E) and olfactory bulbs (OBs) when given intranasally. Radiolabeled CT ((125)I-CT) or CT-B subunit ((125)I-CT-B), when given intranasally to mice, entered the ON/E and OB and persisted for 6 days; however, neither molecule was present in nasal-associated lymphoreticular tissues beyond 24 h. This uptake into olfactory regions was monosialoganglioside (GM1) dependent. Intranasal vaccination with (125)I-tetanus toxoid together with unlabeled CT as adjuvant resulted in uptake into the ON/E but not the OB, whereas (125)I-tetanus toxoid alone did not penetrate into the CNS. We conclude that GM1-binding molecules like CT target the ON/E and are retrograde transported to the OB and may promote uptake of vaccine proteins into olfactory neurons. This raises concerns about the role of GM1-binding molecules that target neuronal tissues in mucosal immunity.",M2

In this work we describe the construction of 638T, a thymidine auxotrophic version of improved environmental biosafety. In so doing, the thyA gene from V. cholerae was cloned, sequenced, mutated in vitro, and used to replace the wild-type allele. Except for its dependence on thymidine for growth in minimal medium, 638T is essentially indistinguishable from 638 in the rate of growth and morphology in complete medium. The two strains showed equivalent phenotypes with regard to motility, expression of the celA marker, colonization capacity in the infant mouse cholera model, and immunogenicity in the adult rabbit cholera model. However, the ability of this new strain to survive environmental starvation was limited with respect to that of 638. Taken together, these results suggest that this live, attenuated, but nonproliferative strain is a new, promising cholera vaccine candidate.",M2

The Ogawa lipopolysaccharide phenotype is expressed by many epidemic strains, and motility defects reduce the risk of reactive diarrhea in vaccine recipients. We therefore converted a motile Inaba(+) vaccine candidate, Peru-2, to a nonmotile Ogawa(+) phenotype using a mariner-based transposon carrying rfbT, the gene required for expression of the Ogawa phenotype. Analysis of 22 nonmotile Peru-2 mutants showed that two were Ogawa(+), and both of these strains had insertions in the flgE gene. It was possible to convert these strains to antibiotic sensitivity by introducing a recombinase that acts on sites flanking the antibiotic marker on the transposon. The resulting strains are competent for colonization in infant mice and may therefore be suitable as vaccine candidates for use either independently or in a combination with strains of different biotypes and serotypes.",M2

Children with ascariasis were randomized to receive either 2 sequential doses of 400 mg of albendazole or placebo. After the second dose, CVD 103-HgR was given, and serum vibriocidal antibody levels were measured before and 10 days after vaccination. Postvaccination rates of seroconversion were greater in the treatment group that received albendazole (P=.06). Significantly greater rates of seroconversion and geometric mean titer were observed in the albendazole group in subjects with non-O ABO blood groups. A significant association was observed between vibriocidal seroconversion rates and treatment group, suggesting that A. lumbricoides infections impair the immune response to oral cholera vaccine, particularly in subjects of non-O blood groups.",M2

This strain is derived from the wild-type O1 strain Inaba 569B by deletion of a fragment internal to the ctxA gene encoding the A1 subunit of cholera toxin and by replacement of an internal fragment of the hlyA gene with a fragment carrying the mer operon mediating mercury resistance. In this study we describe a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) system for the detection of wild-type Vibrio cholerae and the identification of the vaccine strain for the quality control of production batches. A multiplex PCR system that targets the intact ctxA gene of the wild-type strain and simultaneously the integration site of the mer operon in the hlyA gene (hlyA::mer) of the vaccine strain CVD103-HgR was developed. To evaluate the detection limit of the system, vaccine suspensions were artificially contaminated with wild-type V. cholerae 569B cells and tested by PCR. The detection limit of the system was statistically evaluated and found to be at 11625 wild-type cells per vaccine sachet (95% confidence limit).

10948122,"Vibrio cholerae O139 conjugate vaccines: synthesis and immunogenicity of V. cholerae O139 capsular polysaccharide conjugates with recombinant diphtheria toxin mutant in mice.Epidemiologic and experimental data provide evidence that a critical level of serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies to the surface polysaccharide of Vibrio cholerae O1 (lipopolysaccharide) and of Vibrio cholerae O139 (capsular polysaccharide [CPS]) is associated with immunity to the homologous pathogen. The immunogenicity of polysaccharides, especially in infants, may be enhanced by their covalent attachment to proteins (conjugates). Two synthetic schemes, involving 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) and 1-cyano-4-dimethylaminopyridinium tetrafluoroborate (CDAP) as activating agents, were adapted to prepare four conjugates of V. cholerae O139 CPS with the recombinant diphtheria toxin mutant, CRMH21G. Adipic acid dihydrazide was used as a linker. When injected subcutaneously into young outbred mice by a clinically relevant dose and schedule, these conjugates elicited serum CPS antibodies of the IgG and IgM classes with vibriocidal activity to strains of capsulated V. cholerae O139. Treatment of these sera with 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) reduced, but did not eliminate, their vibriocidal activity. These results indicate that the conjugates elicited IgG with vibriocidal activity. Conjugates also elicited high levels of serum diphtheria toxin IgG. Convalescent sera from 20 <e>cholera</e> patients infected with V. cholerae O139 had vibriocidal titers ranging from 100 to 3,200: absorption with the CPS reduced the vibriocidal titer of all sera to &lt; or =50. Treatment with 2-ME reduced the titers of 17 of 20 patients to &lt; or =50. These data show that, like infection with V. cholerae O1, infection with V. cholerae O139 induces vibriocidal antibodies specific to the surface polysaccharide of this bacterium (CPS) that are mostly of IgM class. Based on these data, clinical trials with the V. cholerae O139 CPS conjugates with recombinant diphtheria toxin are planned.",M2

It was confirmed that the serum, as well as the purified IgG and IgA from the volunteers had a protective effect in both of the animal models used, although the purified antibodies needed the presence of complement to be protective. These results emphasize the expectations about the protective potential of the candidate in challenge studies in humans to be conducted very soon.",M2

V. cholerae strain KM68, serogroup O1, has been found capable of the production of antigen O1, serovar Ogawa, protein OmpU at a sufficiently high level and the hyperproduction of cholera toxin and TCP, and thus suitable for use in the manufacture of cholera bivalent vaccine as the source of these antigens. Specially selected alysogenic noncapsular strain KM137 of serogroup O139, characterized by a high and stable level of the biosynthesis of this somatic antigen when grown in both laboratory and production conditions, may serve as the produces of antigen O139.",M2

A more pronounced serum vibriocidal antibody response was generated after primary immunization compared to reimmunization 2.5 or 3.5 yr later. The seroconversion rate (&gt; or =4-fold rise over baseline) was 81% subsequent to primary immunization versus 57% (p=0.018) and 65% (p=0.639) upon reimmunization at 2.5 and 3.5 yr, respectively. A similar trend was observed for serum anti-S. typhi lipopolysaccharide (LPS) antibodies. After primary immunization, 48% of subjects manifested a significant rise in coproantibody levels to V. cholerae LPS while 60% did so for <e>cholera</e> toxin (CT). Upon reimmunization, the response rate for LPS ranged from 38% at 2.5 yr to 56% at 3.5 yr (p&gt;0.05), while that for CT varied from 31% (p=0. 007) to 50% (p=0.541) at 2.5 and 3.5 yr, respectively.

10781859,"Induction of innate immunity by nasal influenza vaccine administered in combination with an adjuvant (<e>cholera</e> toxin).Inactivated influenza vaccine was administered intranasally to BALB/c mice together with an adjuvant (cholera toxin B subunit [CTB] supplemented with a trace amount of the whole toxin, CTB*) and its ability to induce innate immunity and confer protection against influenza was examined. Nasal wash virus titres 3 days after inoculation of homologous viruses were measured as an index of the ability of the vaccine to confer protection in mice immunized with either CTB*-combined vaccine or CTB* alone 1-21 days previously. The results were as follows. (1) Partial but significant reduction of the nasal-wash virus titres (prevention) was detected beginning 3 days after the vaccination, that is, 2 days earlier than the appearance of both virus-specific antibody-forming cells (AFCs) in the nasal-associated lymphoid tissue (NALT) and virus-specific IgA antibody responses in the nasal washes of mice immunized with the CTB*-combined vaccine. (2) The protection, detected on day 3 and peaking on day 5 but lost by day 21, was also conferred in mice immunized with CTB* alone. (3) The non-specific prevention was detected at doses of more than 0.3 microg of CTB*/mouse. (4) The nonspecific protection beginning 3 days after the immunization involved the enhanced expression of cytokine mRNAs (IL-15 and IL-18), considered responsible for natural killer (NK) cell activation, by the non-T cell populations in the NALT. (5) Normal NALT cells, when cultured in vitro with CTB*, secreted IL-1beta within a few hours in culture. These results demonstrate that the CTB*-combined vaccine, when given intranasally into mice, can confer nonspecific protection against influenza beginning 3 days after the vaccination and that CTB* also possessed this ability to confer protection non-specifically and temporarily by inducing the secretion of IL-1beta, one of the most important cytokines that initiates both innate and adaptive immunity, and also NK cell activity.",M2
10781858,"Safety and immunogenicity of an oral, inactivated enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli plus <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit vaccine in Bangladeshi adults and children.We have compared the B cell responses evoked in Bangladeshi, adults (n=11, median age 25 years) and children (n=21, median age 4.5 years), 7 days after intake of each of two doses of an oral, inactivated enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) vaccine composed of formalin-killed ETEC strains expressing the colonization factors, CFA/I, CFA/II and CFA/IV together with 1 mg of recombinant cholera toxin B-subunit (rCTB). The vaccine was well tolerated and only gave rise to negligible side effects. Peak antibody-secreting cell (ASC) response of the IgA isotype were seen 7 days after the first dose of the vaccine. The ASC responses to the different colonization factors (CFs) increased from a 29- to 46-fold (responder frequency 90-100%) in the adults and 13- to 24-fold (responder frequency 67-90%) in the children. The IgA-ASC response to rCTB also peaked after the first dose in the adults (426-fold, responder frequency 100%) and the children (46-fold, responder frequency 95%). Increased IgA antibody levels against CFA/I as well as IgA and IgG antibody levels to rCTB were seen in plasma after immunisation. About 86% of the children and 80% of the adults responded with faecal antibodies to rCTB, whereas about 67% of both groups responded to CFA/I. These results show that a single dose of the ETEC vaccine may elicit significant mucosal immune responses in both children and adults residing in an ETEC-endemic country such as Bangladesh.",M2
10732430,"The impact of new technologies on vaccines.Vast changes are taking place in vaccinology consequent to the introduction of new technologies. Amongst the vaccines included in the Expanded Programme of Immunization (EPI), the pertussis vaccine has been replaced by acellular purified fractions devoid of side-effects. Non-pathogenic but immunogenic mutants of tetanus and diptheria toxins are likely to replace the toxoids. An effective vaccine against hepatitis B prepared by recombinant technology is in large-scale use. Conjugated vaccines against Haemophilus influenzae b, S. pneumococcus and meningococcus are now available, as also vaccines against mumps, rubella and measles. Combination vaccines have been devised to limit the number of injections. Vaccine delivery systems have been developed to deliver multiple doses of the vaccine at a single contact point. A genetically-engineered oral vaccine for typhoid imparts better and longer duration of immunity. Oral vaccines for <e>cholera</e> and other enteric infections are under clinical trials. The nose as a route for immunization is showing promise for mucosal immunity and for anti-inflammatory experimental vaccines against multiple sclerosis and insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The range of vaccines has expanded to include pathogens resident in the body such as Helicobacter pylori (duodenal ulcer), S. mutans (dental caries), and human papilloma virus (carcinoma of the cervix). An important progress is the recognition that DNA alone can constitute the vaccines, inducing both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses. A large number of DNA vaccines have been made and shown interesting results in experimental animals. Live recombinant vaccines against rabies and rinderpest have proven to be highly effective for controlling these infections in the field, and those for AIDS are under clinical trial. Potent adjuvants have added to the efficacy of the vaccines. New technologies have emerged to 'humanize' mouse monoclonals by genetic engineering and express these efficiently in plants. These recombinant antibodies are opening out an era of highly specific and safe therapeutic interventions. Human recombinant antibodies would be invaluable for treating patients with terminal tetanus and rabies. Antibodies are already in use for treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis and allergies. An advantage of preformed antibodies directed at a defined target and given in adequate amounts is the certainty of efficacy in every recipient, in contrast to vaccines, where the quality and quantum of immune response varies from individual to individual.",M2

The conjugate obtained from direct, single-point attachment of the linker-equipped hapten to chicken serum albumin (CSA) contained seven hapten residues/CSA. A neoglycoconjugate containing the carbohydrate antigen in the form of clusters was obtained using, as a hapten subcarrier, an oligopeptide containing 16 amino groups. It was treated with a limited amount of hapten, to give a hapten-carrying subcarrier (HCS).

10515838,"Effect of small bowel bacterial overgrowth on the immunogenicity of single-dose live oral <e>cholera</e> vaccine CVD 103-HgR.Several live oral vaccines (polio, bovine rotavirus, CVD 103-HgR cholera) are less immunogenic in developing than in industrialized countries. It was hypothesized that proximal small bowel bacterial overgrowth (common in children in less developed countries but rare in industrialized settings) diminishes the vibriocidal antibody response to CVD 103-HgR. In total, 202 fasting Santiago schoolchildren aged 5-9 years had lactulose breath H2 tests to detect proximal small bowel bacteria 1 day before ingesting CVD 103-HgR. Florid small bowel overgrowth was observed in 10 (5.6%) of 178 analyzable children. In children with florid overgrowth, vibriocidal seroconversion differed little from other children (60% vs. 67%), but the geometric mean titer was lower (160 vs. 368; P=.25). By logistic regression, increased peak breath H2 at small bowel time points was associated with diminished seroconversion (P=.04), as was the interaction of H2 value and weight (children &gt;25 kg had lower seroconversion rates among subjects with heaviest overgrowth).",M2
10377160,"Mucosal and systemic immune responses in humans after primary and booster immunizations with orally administered invasive and noninvasive live attenuated bacteria.The mucosal and systemic immune responses after primary and booster immunizations with two attenuated live oral vaccine strains derived from a noninvasive (Vibrio cholerae) and an invasive (Salmonella typhi) enteric pathogen were comparatively evaluated. Vaccination with S. typhi Ty21a elicited antibody-secreting cell (ASC) responses specific for S. typhi O9, 12 lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as significant increases in levels of immunoglobulin G (IgG) and IgA antibodies to the same antigen in serum. A strong systemic CD4(+) T-helper type 1 cell-mediated immune (CMI) response was also induced. In contrast to results with Ty21a, no evidence of a CMI response was obtained after primary immunization with V. cholerae CVD 103-HgR in spite of the good immunogenicity of the vaccine. Volunteers who received a single dose of CVD 103-HgR primarily developed an IgM ASC response against whole vaccine cells and purified V. cholerae Inaba LPS, and seroconversion of serum vibriocidal antibodies occurred in four of five subjects. Serum IgG anti-<e>cholera</e> toxin antibody titers were of lower magnitude. For both live vaccines, the volunteers still presented significant local immunity 14 months after primary immunization, as revealed by the elevated baseline antibody titers at the time of the booster immunization and the lower ASC, serum IgG, and vibriocidal antibody responses after the booster immunization. These results suggest that local immunity may interfere with colonization of the gut by both vaccine strains at least up to 14 months after basis immunization. Interestingly, despite a low secondary ASC response, Ty21a was able to boost both humoral (anti-LPS systemic IgG and IgA) and CMI responses. Evidence of a CMI response was also observed for one of three volunteers given a cholera vaccine booster dose. The direct comparison of results with two attenuated live oral vaccine strains in human volunteers clearly showed that the capacity of the vaccine strain to colonize specific body compartments conditions the pattern of vaccine-induced immune responses.",M2

The main approach for developing live recombinant vaccines has been to disarm known pathogenic strains of cholera toxin leaving intact antigens involved in protection. These recombinant vaccine candidates do not cause severe diarrhea, but they are too reactogenic for wide scale usage. We describe here a test capable of determining the diarrheagenic potential of attenuated V. cholerae strains. The functional test consists in the simultaneous recording of net water movement, electrical potential difference and short-circuit current across the human intestine ex vivo. We found that human tissues incubated with supernatants from the attenuated 638, 413 and 251a V. cholerae strains caused no changes in the ion conductances and water absorption in ileal and colon tissues allowing them to be assayed in volunteers.",M2

Mice immunized intranasally or subcutaneously with nTT together with rCTB showed a high level of TT-specific serum IgG antibody response and no or a slight level of TT-specific serum IgE antibody response. On the other hand, in mice vaccinated intranasally or subcutaneously with aTT alone, higher levels of TT-specific IgG and IgE antibodies were induced in comparison with intranasal or subcutaneous inoculation of nTT together with rCTB. These results suggest that intranasal or subcutaneous co-administration of rCTB with nTT is better than intranasal or subcutaneous administration of aTT to avoid IgE-mediated allergic reactions.",M2

10338495,"Antibody responses in the lower respiratory tract and male urogenital tract in humans after nasal and oral vaccination with <e>cholera</e> toxin B subunit.Nasal vaccine delivery is superior to oral delivery in inducing specific immunoglobulin A (IgA) and IgG antibody responses in the upper respiratory tract. Although an antibody response in the nasal passages is important in protecting against primary colonization with lung pathogens, antibodies in the lungs are usually required as well. We immunized 15 male volunteers twice nasally or orally with cholera toxin B subunit (CTB) and determined the specific antibody levels in serum, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, and urine before and 2 weeks after immunization. Nasal immunization induced fivefold increases in the levels of specific IgA antibodies in BAL fluid of most volunteers, whereas there were no significant specific IgA responses after oral immunization. The specific IgG antibody level increased eightfold in BAL fluid in the nasally vaccinated subjects, and the major part of IgG had most probably been transferred from serum. Since the specific IgG response in serum was lower in the individuals vaccinated orally, the IgG response in BAL fluid in this group was also lower and not significant. In conclusion, nasal immunization is also preferable to the oral route when vaccinating against lower respiratory tract infections, and a systemic immune response is considerably more important in the lower than in the upper respiratory tract. Moreover, both nasal and oral immunizations were able to stimulate 6- to 10-fold specific IgA and IgG responses in urine in about half of the individuals, which indicates that distant mucosal vaccination might be used to prevent adhesion of pathogens to the urogenital tract.",M2

From crop improvement to vaccine antigen and antibody production, plants are attractive bioreactors for production of recombinant proteins, as their eukaryotic nature often permits appropriate post-translational modification of recombinant proteins to retain native biological activity. The autotrophic growth of plants requires only soil minerals, water, nitrogen, sunlight energy and carbon dioxide for the synthesis of constituent proteins. Furthermore, production of biologically active proteins in food plants provides the advantage of direct delivery through consumption of edible transformed plant tissues. The production of cholera toxin B subunit in potato plants and applications for prevention of infectious and autoimmune disease are explained in this contribution.",M2
