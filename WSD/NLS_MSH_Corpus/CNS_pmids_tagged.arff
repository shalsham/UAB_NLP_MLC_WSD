19955965,"The role of the <e>CNS</e> in achieving and maintaining Magnet status.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to describe the role of clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) in achieving and maintaining Magnet designation. BACKGROUND: Anecdotal evidence indicates that CNSs are effective in helping hospitals achieve Magnet designation. However, there is no empirical evidence to support these statements. METHODS: Using an anonymous descriptive survey design, surveys were sent to chief nursing officers from Magnet facilities. Information collected included facility descriptions, presence and employment patterns of CNSs, and CNS importance in relation to the Forces of Magnetism. RESULTS: Clinical nurse specialists were employed in 87% of the facilities. Of those, 88% indicated that CNSs were important in achieving Magnet status, and 92% indicated that CNSs were important in maintaining Magnet status. The Force of Magnetism related to consultation and resources was perceived as most influenced by CNSs. CONCLUSION: Most Magnet hospitals employed CNSs. They were perceived as important in achieving and maintaining Magnet status.",M1
19805006,"A census of the advanced and specialist cancer nursing workforce in England, Northern Ireland and Wales.INTRODUCTION: At present no detailed data on the specialist cancer nursing workforce across different cancer types and populations is routinely collected in England, Wales or Northern Ireland. This has implications for workforce planning and the future provision of cancer services. METHOD: In an attempt to establish a baseline of the workforce a census was taken. Data was collected via an Excel spreadsheet by Cancer Network Nurse Directors and Lead Nurses across England and Northern Ireland and a lead nurse in Wales. Scotland, Palliative Care and Chemotherapy posts were excluded at levels other than Consultant as these are collected via other mechanisms. RESULTS &amp; CONCLUSIONS: The census recorded 2309.4 specialist and advanced practice posts in England (89% response rate), 204 posts in Wales (66% response rate) and 43.4 posts in Northern Ireland (100% response rate). There is a variation in terms of distribution of specialist nurses across the Networks both in number and in cancer type. 1800 adult <e>CNS</e> posts were recorded in England and 1 in 5 of these were breast cancer posts. The range of job titles is very wide with 17 different titles being used. In England the extent of support for posts from Macmillan Cancer Support was considerable. Around a third (31%) of all adult cancer specialist posts in England are supported by Macmillan Cancer Support (n=671.2) 607.2 of these are CNS posts equating to 34% of all CNS posts in England. 34% of all NI CNS posts and 32.5% in Wales.",M1
19710575,"Understanding clinical nurse specialist regulation by the boards of nursing.The nursing profession and regulatory policy makers have struggled with the best and most consistent way to regulate advanced practice registered nurses in the role of clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>). Inconsistent scopes of practice, varying regulatory requirements, unavailability of certification examinations, and unclear educational preparation have been barriers to CNSs maximizing their clinical potential. Historical issues, the current nursing regulatory model in the United States, 4 domains of Boards of Nursing function, and the implications for future CNS regulation and the need for individual CNS engagement in public policy formation based on the 2008 Consensus Model are discussed.",M1
19710572,"Advance directives: the clinical nurse specialist as a change agent.The purpose of this article is to describe the impact the clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) has on the advance directive process within the cardiac surgery patient population. As a change agent, the CNS needs to be able to increase the number of advance directives obtained and increase the provision of dignified, self-directed, quality patient care. With requirements from The Joint Commission and the Patient Self-determination Act, the change in process must take place to ensure that healthcare professionals are doing all they can do to carry out a patient's wishes. The 6-Source Influencer Model is applied to a case study to illustrate the role of the CNS as a change agent. Following this model, the CNS can facilitate lasting institutional change in the advance directive process. Based on the example, it is possible that a CNS can act as a change agent for other patient populations within the healthcare setting.",M1
19710571,"Outcomes of a clinical nurse specialist-initiated wound care education program: using the promoting action on research implementation in health services framework.Consistent with the sphere of clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) practice related to advancing nursing practice and patient outcomes, a CNS task force of 20 of the 60 CNSs in our large teaching hospital was convened to plan, implement and evaluate a comprehensive wound care education program. The purpose of the program was to ensure the 24-7 hospital-wide availability of nurses with evidenced-based wound care knowledge and skills. The facilitative environment, in which the program was developed and operates, is analyzed using the Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services framework. Outcomes of the CNS task force include (1) designation of unit-based CNS as the first line resources for wound care at the unit level, (2) education of almost 10% of the 3,800 nurses at Massachusetts General Hospital as staff nurse resources, and (3) a shift in the nature of CNS wound care consultations from prescription to validation of the staff nurse-initiated wound care plan.",M1
19538704,"National validation of the NACNS clinical nurse specialist core competencies.PURPOSE: To validate the 75 core National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists' (NACNS) clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) competencies among practicing CNSs. Specific aims were to (a) determine the extent to which 75 core CNS competencies were used in current CNS practice, (b) determine the importance of those competencies to practicing CNSs, and (c) identify gaps between CNS core competencies and role expectations in current practice. DESIGN: A survey design was used with both paper-and-pencil and online instruments. The survey included 150 items and three open-ended questions. Methods: A convenience sampling method was used, which targeted practicing CNSs. FINDINGS: Respondents (N=505) were practicing CNSs who entered the field as RNs between 1956 and 2006. The survey had a high degree of internal consistency reliability (0.967%) between the subscales. The 75 NACNS core competencies were found to be useful and important for CNSs. A few gaps were identified between CNS core competencies and CNS role expectations in current practice. CONCLUSIONS: No one method for validating competencies will be satisfactory for all situations; however, the processes and methods used in this study were well suited to accomplish the goal of validating CNS core competencies. The process described here may be instructive to leaders of other national and international professional organizations interested in developing and evaluating competencies. Core competencies are useful and important to currently practicing CNSs. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The CNS role is growing internationally. Core CNS competencies can be a framework for CNS role development, education, and practice. As described here, a competency validation survey is one way to assure that CNSs are meeting healthcare needs.",M1
19395891,"The clinical nurse specialist and essential genomic competencies: charting the course.Forging new frontiers is one description for the completion of the Human Genome Project (HGP) in 2003. This project produced a human DNA blueprint that is revolutionalizing society, changing healthcare, and producing new practice standards. With the genome map, scientists are identifying DNA variations that transform traditional models of health promotion, disease prevention, disease classification, treatment, and symptom management. The HGP is shifting emphasis from traditional genetics to an expanded genomic message. Nursing has responded to the HGP completion by establishing genomic nursing competencies. In 2005, the American Nurses Association (ANA), along with 48 nursing organizations, including the National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (NACNS), endorsed minimum essential genetic/genomic nursing competencies for all registered nurses, regardless of education or specialty area. How does the clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) explore the HGP frontier and integrate essential genomic nursing competencies into practice? This article discusses the HGP, the development of essential genetic/genomic nursing competencies, and the genomic role of the advanced practice CNS. A 1-day genomics program is described as a pilot project for integrating competencies in practice and education.",M1
19321512,"Do OA patients gain additional benefit from care from a clinical nurse specialist?--a randomized clinical trial.OBJECTIVES: To assess whether OA patients attending a clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) clinic gain 'additional benefit' compared with those attending a traditional junior hospital doctor (JHD) clinic. METHODS: A total of 100 patients with OA attending rheumatology clinics at a UK teaching hospital were randomly allocated to a CNS or JHD clinic and seen at 0, 16, 32 and 48 weeks. The study assessed (i) non-inferiority of the CNS with respect to clinical outcomes (pain, morning stiffness, self-efficacy, physical function and psychological status) and (ii) superiority of the CNS in terms of patient knowledge and satisfaction. RESULTS: Average pain at follow-up was lower in the CNS group: unadjusted mean difference for the JHD group minus the CNS group was 5.3 (95% CI -4.6, 15.2); adjusted was 1.6 (95% CI -5.7, 8.9). The corresponding effect size estimates were 0.20 (95% CI -0.17, 0.57) and 0.06 (95% CI -0.21, 0.33), respectively. There were similar outcomes in morning stiffness, physical function and self-efficacy. Patient knowledge and satisfaction were statistically significant at the 5% level attaining moderate to large effect sizes in favour of the CNS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings demonstrate that the clinical outcome of CNS care is not inferior to that of JHD care, and patients attending CNS gain additional benefit in that they are better informed about their disease and significantly more satisfied with care than are their counterparts.",M1
19104282,"Organizational strategies to recruit clinical nurse specialists.There is strong evidence of the value of the clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) role in the acute care environment. Individual hospitals may encounter barriers in recruiting qualified CNSs. The authors discuss one organization's journey to increase recruitment of CNSs through the implementation of a service-line-specific role and a formal staff development program.

19017243,"Nurse prescribing as an aspect of future role expansion: the views of Irish clinical nurse specialists.AIM: Nurses and midwives are expanding the scope of their professional practice, assuming additional responsibilities including the management and prescribing of medications. The aim of the study was to discover the attitudes of clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNSs</e>) in Ireland to nurse prescribing and to examine perceived barriers to engaging in this aspect of future role expansion. BACKGROUND: The expansion of the nursing role in relation to nurse prescribing is an ongoing process and is subject to incremental iterations of legislation and professional policy. Nurse prescribing as an expanded role function has become a reality in many countries. Ireland has addressed the matter in a formal and systematic way through legislation. METHOD: A questionnaire was administered to a sample of 283 CNSs practising in a variety of care settings in Ireland. Attitudes were measured using Likert-type attitudinal scales, designed specifically for the study. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Findings indicate that the majority of clinical nurse specialists were positively disposed toward nurse prescribing as a future role expansion. The fear of litigation was identified as the most significant barrier to nurse prescribing. The majority of respondents equated nurse prescribing with increased autonomy and holistic care. The findings indicate that there is a need for further examination of the educational requirements of the CNS in relation to nurse prescribing. The legislative implications for nurse prescribing and fear of legal consequences need to be considered prior to any implementation of nurse prescribing. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING MANAGEMENT: While senior clinicians are willing to embrace future role expansion in the area of nurse prescribing, their Nurse Managers should recognize that facilitation of nurse prescribing needs to address the legal and educational requirements for such activity. Failure to address these requirements can represent a barrier to role expansion. This paper offers new understandings on the views of senior clinicians concerning nurse prescribing at a time of ongoing professional policy iteration and practice change in the area.",M1
18955847,"Translating social justice into clinical nurse specialist practice.Translating social justice into clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) practice involves not only facilitating equitable access to healthcare resources but also changing the definition of health from individual centric to population based. Clinical nurse specialists working within hospitals or healthcare systems generally have not explored the ethical conflicts between demand and available healthcare resources. Application of social justice to CNS practice requires microallocation decisions in direct patient care and macroallocation decisions in the distribution of all societal goods that alleviate health disparities. This article reviews the meaning, history, and current basis for the application of the principle of social justice to CNS practice.",M1
18820554,"Society of Trauma Nurses position statement on the role of the clinical nurse specialist in trauma.The clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) is included in the collective term advanced practice nurse. Preparation of the CNS involves completion of a graduate program with a clinical focus, specialty certification, and state-defined requirements for licensure.The trauma CNS demonstrates advanced clinical knowledge based on an in-depth understanding of the pathophysiology of trauma combined with extensive practical experience observing human responses to injury. The trauma CNS assumes the traditional subroles as expert practitioner, educator, consultant, and researcher with the proportion of time spent in each subrole based on the needs of the trauma program. The CNS's ability to minimize variances in care and prevent adverse outcomes directly support performance improvement. The Society of Trauma Nurses recognizes and supports the utilization of CNSs in trauma programs.",M1
18562991,"Impact of a clinical nurse specialist on the treatment of chronic hepatitis C.Hepatitis C virus is a common cause of liver disease and a major health problem worldwide. Modern treatment strategies can be successful in up to 50% of cases, with patients treated in specialist and more general hospital settings. Guidelines issued by the Department of Health and the then National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence made it obligatory for a clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) to be involved with assessing and treating patients with chronic hepatitis C. The aim of this retrospective case study was to assess the impact on referral, assessment and treatment of patients with chronic hepatitis C before and after the introduction of a CNS to Salisbury District Hospital. There was a significant improvement in patient follow-up and intention to treat, with a doubling in treatment rates. This was achieved by improving clinic attendance after the patient's initial outpatient assessment, allowing improved biopsy rates and subsequent selection for antiviral therapy. However, over half the cases with chronic hepatitis C identified in primary care each year were not referred to secondary care for assessment.",M1
18438164,"Developing an empirical base for clinical nurse specialist education.This article reports on the design of a clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) education program using National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (NACNS) CNS competencies to guide CNS program clinical competency expectations and curriculum outcomes. The purpose is to contribute to the development of an empirical base for education and credentialing of CNSs. The NACNS CNS core competencies and practice competencies in all 3 spheres of influence guided the creation of clinical competency grids for this university's practicum courses. This project describes the development, testing, and application of these clinical competency grids that link the program's CNS clinical courses with the NACNS CNS competencies. These documents guide identification, tracking, measurement, and evaluation of the competencies throughout the clinical practice portion of the CNS program. This ongoing project will continue to provide data necessary to the benchmarking of CNS practice competencies, which is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of direct practice performance and the currency of graduate nursing education.",M1
18408425,"[Nursing certification system in cancer nursing]The Japanese Nursing Association (JNA) started an advanced nursing certification system and gave the first certification to certified nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) in cancer nursing in 1996. CNS is recognized for excellent nursing practice in a specific area, and for demonstrating six roles: excellent nursing practice, consultation, ethical coordination, education, coordination, and research activities. To receive CNS certification need nurse (or public health nurse or nurse midwife) qualification, master's degree, at least five-years clinical experience, and after that to pass a JNA certification examination. Certified nurse (CN) demonstrates three roles in high level of nursing practice by using matured nursing skills and knowledge, leadership, and consultation in a specific nursing area. CN need nurse qualification, at least fiveyears clinical experience, completing educational program at least 6 months, and passing a JNA certification examination. Both of CNS and CN requier certification renewal every five years. The number of people who get certification of CNS's in cancer nursing become 104, and of CN in cancer nursing area become 942 (chemotherapy 204, palliative care 420, cancer pain 267, breast cancer 51) in 2007. CNS's in cancer nursing activities are not understood broaden, because they have various work positions and activities, and are very few in Japan. But they are considered to be a change agent in cancer health care system. Also they will expand their activity setting. There is a prospect that CNS in cancer nursing will increase in number with nursing graduate school increasing. It shows that we will face some problems, for example educational contents or methods, certification system and so on.",M1
18399368,"The evolving role of the community nurse specialist in palliative care.The community clinical nurse specialist in palliative care role has evolved in an uncoordinated manner resulting in a variety of grades of nurse with differing role expectations. In general the <e>CNS</e> role consists of a clinical, educational, strategic and managerial remit. The reality of working with such a diverse role creates tension and conflict for the CNS between personal, organization and practical expectations. Despite this the community palliative care CNS is central to the future development of palliative care services in the community generating a culture of sharing knowledge and expertise. This will however require further investigation into the impact these demands will have on the individual.",M1
18211337,"Using guidelines to support secondment: a personal experience.BACKGROUND: Secondment is recognized as a method of staff development and can offer both individuals and organizations structure and flexibility in relation to service development. AIM: This article describes the experience of a clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) seconded 3 days a week for 18 months to a Macmillan Education Unit, as an associate lecturer (the host organization). Different types of secondment are discussed, mapping this experience to Partnership Information Network guidelines. EVALUATION: A 360 degrees evaluation process involving all key stakeholders was carried out, and highlighted positive aspects. CONCLUSION: Secondment is recommended as a valuable and safe method of staff development, increasing knowledge and skills, raising motivation and aiding retention, provided guidelines are adhered to and strategies are in place to mitigate risks.",M1
18171394,"A study of a training scheme for Macmillan nurses in Northern Ireland.AIM: To evaluate a one year training scheme for Macmillan Nurses. BACKGROUND: The role of the clinical nurse specialist has evolved and expanded greatly over the past few years so that it now encompasses components far beyond the traditional nursing remit of direct clinical practice. While several studies have looked at the barriers and facilitators to this process for clinical nurse specialists in particular, none has looked at the benefits of a structured training scheme which involves both a theoretical and clinical component. METHODS: Tape recorded, semi-structured interviews were undertaken with a purposive sample of trainees who undertook the scheme, their practice-based facilitators and another person(s) involved in the trainee's support. ANALYSIS: Tapes were transcribed verbatim and each transcript anonymized to prevent identification of participants. Data were analysed thematically using the main headings of expectations, experience and impact and the structured prompts from the aide-memoir within these headings. RESULTS: Results showed that the majority of respondents felt the scheme had been successful with one of the main achievements being that trainees were perceived to be adequately prepared to take on the role of a <e>CNS</e> on completion of the scheme. While the Role Development Programme was thought to provide a good academic structure for the scheme some participants thought that more theory on symptom control and communication skills and a placement in a specialist palliative care centre should also be included. CONCLUSION: The Macmillan Trainee Scheme has succeeded in its objectives to facilitate the transition from generalist to specialist nursing. It should be extended to include an induction and consolidation period and more theoretical input on communication skills and symptom control. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: With these improvements, the scheme could be used as a standard model for training specialist practitioners and a means to address the current issues of workforce planning.",M1
18078461,"Colorectal MDTs: the team's perspective.OBJECTIVE: Multidisciplinary teams (MDTs) are an integral part of the National Cancer Plan. However, there is surprisingly little empirical research on how these are perceived by colorectal surgeons (CRSs) and colorectal clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNSs</e>). The purpose of this study therefore was to obtain the views of a national cohort of CRSs and CNSs regarding various important aspects of MDT functioning and role of CNS in current setting. METHOD: Two hundred and fifty-three CRSs and 177 CNSs, identified from the Association of Coloproctologists of Great Britain and Ireland, responded to an ad hoc postal questionnaire. RESULTS: 96.5% of respondents considered that MDTs improved the overall quality of care of colorectal cancer patients, and 78.6% thought MDTs were good for their morale. Eighty per cent considered that they improved training. Seventy-three per cent of surgeons and nurses thought that MDTs were cost effective, and 89% did not consider them to be a passing fad. However, more than half (50.4%) of the CRSs and 35.2% of the CNSs stated that their job plan did not contain adequate time to attend MDT meetings. Compared with CRSs, CNSs were significantly more likely to have positive views regarding the MDT (P &lt; 0.005). CONCLUSION: CNSs and CRSs consider that colorectal MDTs have very beneficial effects on patient care, training and morale. However, many surgeons and nurse specialists consider that attendance at MDTs is not taken into account adequately in terms of their job plans, and this issue needs to be addressed.",M1
18073710,"Interprofessional working: communication, collaboration... perspiration!Palliative care is rarely delivered by one provider; for most patients their care will be managed by community and one or more hospital teams at the least. This can be problematic for patients, their family and friends, and health professionals. Evidence suggests that, in general, providers work in isolation from each other. Although formal processes are in place for transfer of information between the sectors on discharge between acute and community sectors, there is a de facto lack of communication and therefore a lack of appreciation of the working practices within each environment. This resulting lack of collaboration between teams can lead to disruptive care that detracts from the holistic philosophy purported to be the basis of supportive and palliative care (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) 2004; Department of Health (DH) 2000). In October 2005, 20% of a clinical nurse specialist's (<e>CNS</e>) full-time post was dedicated to working between the palliative care teams of Central Manchester and Manchester Children's NHS Trust (CMMC) and Central Manchester PCT (CMPCT). The aim was to improve communication and dialogue to promote more effective integrated working between the two sites and develop effective interprofessional working. This article will evaluate the impact of this new post, after 18 months, on collaboration between the teams, their practices and their patients. Finally, it will offer recommendations for future development.",M1
18050983,"The role of the clinical nurse specialist in promoting evidence-based practice and effecting positive patient outcomes.Clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNSs</e>) are vital members of the healthcare delivery leadership team. The knowledge and expertise of the CNS is germane to the quality of care a patient receives. More than 50 CNSs practice at Massachusetts General Hospital (the state's first Magnet hospital), where they share their clinical skills, mentor staff through difficult situations, identify learning needs, and implement innovative approaches to patient care. This article presents a brief history of the CNS role and describes how the CNS role is operationalized at Massachusetts General Hospital and its impact on unit-based and organizational outcomes. In addition, several programs and interventions identified by the CNSs in response to results of the Staff Perception of the Professional Practice Environment Survey are discussed. How the CNS influences the professional development of staff and potential implications for the future role of the CNS are described. An exemplar is included depicting a typical work day of a CNS on an acute adult medical unit.",M1
18042131,"A qualitative analysis of how advanced practice nurses use clinical decision support systems.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to generate a grounded theory that will reflect the experiences of advanced practice nurses (APNs) working as critical care nurse practitioners (NPs) and clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNS</e>) with computer-based decision-making systems. DATA SOURCES: A study design using grounded theory qualitative research methods and convenience sampling was employed in this study. Twenty-three APNs (13 CNS and 10 NPs) were recruited from 16 critical care units located in six large urban medical centers in the U.S. Midwest. Single-structured in-depth interviews with open-ended audio-taped questions were conducted with each APN. Through this process, APNs defined what they consider to be relevant themes and patterns of clinical decision system use in their critical care practices, and they identified the interrelatedness of the conceptual categories that emerged from the results. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative analysis method of qualitative research. CONCLUSIONS: APN participants were predominantly female, white/non-Hispanic, had a history of access to the clinical decision system used in their critical care settings for an average of 14 months, and had attended a formal training program to learn how to use clinical decision systems.  Forecasting decision outcomes,  which was defined as the voluntary process employed to forecast the outcomes of patient care decisions in critical care prior to actual decision making, was the core variable describing system use that emerged from the responses. This variable consisted of four user constructs or components: (a) users' perceptions of their initial system learning experience, (b) users' sense of how well they understand how system technology works, (c) users' understanding of how system inferences are created or derived, and (d) users' relative trust of system-derived data. Each of these categories was further described through the grounded theory research process, and the relationships between the categories were identified. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The findings of this study suggest that the main reason critical care APNs choose to integrate clinical decision systems into their practices is to provide an objective, scientifically derived, technology-based backup for human forecasting of the outcomes of patient care decisions prior to their actual decision making. Implications for nursing, health care, and technology research are presented.",M1
18023615,"Meeting the ongoing needs of survivors of rarer cancer.With more treatment options for people with cancer long-term survivorship is increasing. Physical and psycho-social needs have been identified in survivors of common cancers but very little has been written about the needs of patients with rarer cancers. Patients treated for rarer cancer are discharged to the primary health care team (PHCT), yet little is known about the assessment, management and support of these patients. Thirty-nine semi-structured interviews were conducted with (1) survivors of and (2) people living with rarer cancer (i.e. &lt;5% of cancer burden). Participants were asked about physical and psycho-social needs and service provision. Data were analysed thematically using Atlas ti. Contrary to expectation, disease-free survivors of rarer cancer were indistinguishable from those living with disease in their ability to cope, and range of symptoms and needs. Participants with a clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) reported that they were well supported on their return home and their needs were met. Participants without a CNS were referred to the PHCT who were unsure how to assess or support them. These participants felt abandoned. There is a need for the rehabilitation of patients with rarer cancer to strengthen individual coping mechanisms, and family and social support. Although there are resource and training implications, this is a potential role for the PHCT, district nursing in particular, and may lead to more focused and targeted provision of services.",M1
18000443,"Developing clinical nurse specialist practice competencies.BACKGROUND: In 1998, the National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialist (NACNS) developed the first ever core competencies for clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) practice. PURPOSE: This article describes the method used to develop, validate, and revise CNS core practice competencies. METHODS: The stepwise method of identifying core CNS competencies included content analysis of CNS position/job descriptions, extensive literature review, development by role experts, first-tier corroboration, second-tier corroboration encompassing stakeholder review, final review/editing, approval by the board of directors, and dissemination. DISCUSSION: The process used by professional organizations to develop competencies and standards varies; however, it should be transparent and consist of adequate review and validation for accuracy and applicability by members of the representative group for whom the standards and competencies apply. CONCLUSIONS: The stepwise method used by the National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialist generated valid CNS core competencies and may be instructive to professional organizations interested in developing competencies and standards.",M1
17804947,"[Educational issues and strategies to improve APN education]PURPOSE: This study was aimed at exploring the current status of graduate programs for an advanced practice nurse(APN) to recommend future directions of APN education. METHODS: A total of 142 students enrolled in seven APN specialty programs, 67 professors who were involved in APN education, and nine nurse administrators participated in the study. Data was collected by questionnaires and focus group interviews. RESULTS: The current definition of APN was found not to be specific enough to represent expected roles of APN in regards to knowledge, attitudes, roles, and skills. Standard curricula employed regardless of the area of APN specialty, lack of qualified clinical practice settings, as well as prepared instructors were found to be problematic. CONCLUSION: The following needs to be addressed: 1. redefining of APN roles, 2. tailoring specialty areas of APN, 3. consolidating educational programs, and 4. ensuring APN role models and faculty. Suggesting a <e>CNS</e> role in Korean APN, areas of APN should be rearranged to clarify their roles and educational programs need to be further developed to meet the expectations and quality of APNs. It is necessary to ensure APN's employment in the health care system by laws and policies to perform advanced nursing roles.",M1
17577175,"A patient and carer survey in a community clinical nurse specialist service.The community clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) team provides specialist palliative care to clients with cancer and non-malignant, life-limiting diseases in clients' homes, community hospitals, and residential and nursing homes. CNSs are based in health centres, community hospitals (geographically spread around the county) or at the local hospice. There has been no systematic review of patient and carer levels of satisfaction since the conception of the CNS service in 1984. Accredited as a nursing development unit (Flint and Wright, 2001) by Leeds University, the team has been encouraged to obtain service users' views. National guidelines in the UK (National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), 2004) also recommend that systems be put in place to enable clients to make their voices heard in a variety of ways. The principle aim was to identify the level of patient and carer satisfaction and to highlight aspects of care that warranted alteration or improvement. The CNS team were also keen to identify the aspects of their role most helpful to patients and carers, enabling CNSs to spend their time in a way that is most beneficial to clients.",M1
17553109,"Clinical nurse specialists' use of evidence in practice: a pilot study.BACKGROUND: The interest in finding ways to bridge the gap between nursing research and implementation of findings into practice has been increasing. Clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNSs</e>) may be a bridge between frontline nurses and current developments in practice. While several researchers have studied the use of evidence by nurses in general, no known studies have been focused specifically on the use of evidence by CNSs. PURPOSE: The purpose of this pilot study was to develop an understanding of the sources, nature, and application of evidence used by CNSs in practice and to investigate the feasibility of conducting a qualitative study focused on the CNS role in relation to evidence use in practice. METHODS: This pilot study is a descriptive exploratory design in the qualitative paradigm. Seven CNSs from a large Western Canadian health region were interviewed. Interview transcripts were reviewed for recurrent themes about sources of evidence, evidence use, and barriers and facilitators to evidence use. FINDINGS: CNSs access and use evidence from a variety of sources. All CNSs indicated that research literature was a primary source of evidence and research was used in decision-making. Peers and experience were also important sources of evidence. CNSs used the Internet extensively to consult research databases, online sources of evidence, and to contact peers about current practice. CNSs also gathered evidence from frontline nurses, healthcare team members, and families before decision-making. The choice of evidence often depended upon the type of question they were attempting to answer. Barriers cited by CNSs support previous research and included lack of time, resources, and receptivity at clinical and organizational levels. Facilitators included peers, organizational support, and advanced education. DISCUSSION: CNSs in Canada have advanced education and clinical expertise and many are employed in roles that permeate organizational management and clinical nursing care. It is suggested that qualitative research in naturalized settings that investigates the role of CNSs in relation to the dissemination of evidence in nursing practice needs attention.",M1
17495549,"Tool development for evaluation of clinical nurse specialist competencies in graduate students: a pilot study.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was psychometric testing of the tool, Self Evaluation of <e>CNS</e> Competency Development. METHODS: The tool was developed using the NACNS competencies, with some concepts added to reflect graduate program objectives. The student sample was 33 students who provided informed consent and completed the tool. The preceptor sample was 6 preceptors who clinically supervised 6 students. RESULTS: As expected, independent samples t tests with matched pairs of 6 students and preceptors showed that there were no mean differences in 9 of the 12 categories within the 3 spheres of influence. Using the contrasted groups approach, discriminant function analysis showed that 91.7% of beginning and ending students were correctly classified. Cronbach alpha was estimated as .96. CONCLUSION: Results show partial support for criterion-related validity and construct validity. Tool reliability is satisfactory. Further testing with larger samples of students and clinical nurse specialists is recommended.",M1

This paper presents the findings of an in-depth case study of a stoma coloproctology nurse specialist employed in one health board area in Northern Ireland. This case study was part of a larger study exploring innovative nursing and midwifery roles in Northern Ireland. BACKGROUND: Specialist nursing roles have evolved and developed in response to changing health care needs, patient expectations, changes in professional regulation and government initiatives. DESIGN: A case study approach was adopted. METHOD: Semi-structured interviews with the post holder (PH), her line manager and the human resource manager were undertaken. Non-participant observation of the PH's practice was also carried out. Analysis was undertaken on secondary data such as job specification, annual reports and other documentation relating to the post. RESULTS: Findings illustrate the PH's function and the impact of the role on patient care. Examples of innovative practices relating to providing care, support and guidance for patients and their families were identified; however, limitations to her role were also identified. CONCLUSIONS: The PH provides an invaluable service to patients, demonstrating a positive impact on care. However, the findings suggest the importance of establishing clear role boundaries, which may lead to professional growth and practice development. RELEVANCE TO CLINICAL PRACTICE: Although this study provides a valuable insight into the role of a Stoma Coloproctology Nurse Specialist a number of challenges exist, as the <e>CNS</e> role requires policy and appropriate educational preparation to practice at an advanced level. Further research investigating the development of the CNS role in the clinical setting and its relationship to members of the multi-professional team would be beneficial.",M1

17213739,"A qualitative evaluation of a family nursing intervention.Congestive heart failure is a major source of anxiety for both patients and their family. This article presents the results of a qualitative case study aimed at evaluating family nursing interventions from the perspective of the family members and a clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>). A CNS applied a family nursing intervention program with 4 couples. Data were obtained through semistructured interviews preintervention and postintervention for the couples and postintervention for the CNS. The transcripts of the interviews were submitted for content analysis. For the couples, results show both spouses subject to a high level of suffering, which can be alleviated through a family nursing meeting that allows them to obtain a better understanding of each other's experience. For the CNS, family interventions were considered a privilege since they helped relieve suffering and her own feelings of powerlessness. These results have the potential to improve family nursing interventions and enhance CNS practice.",M1
17213738,"Perceived readiness for hospital discharge in adult medical-surgical patients.PURPOSE: The purpose of the study was to identify predictors and outcomes of adult medical-surgical patients' perceptions of their readiness for hospital discharge. DESIGN: A correlational, prospective, longitudinal design with path analyses was used to explore relationships among transition theory-related variables. SETTING: Midwestern tertiary medical center. SAMPLE: 147 adult medical-surgical patients. METHODS: Predictor variables included patient characteristics, hospitalization factors, and nursing practices that were measured prior to hospital discharge using a study enrollment form, the Quality of Discharge Teaching Scale, and the Care Coordination Scale. Discharge readiness was measured using the Readiness for Hospital Discharge Scale administered within 4 hours prior to discharge. Outcomes were measured 3 weeks postdischarge with the Post-Discharge Coping Difficulty Scale and self-reported utilization of health services. FINDINGS: Living alone, discharge teaching (amount of content received and nurses' skill in teaching delivery), and care coordination explained 51% of readiness for discharge score variance. Patient age and discharge readiness explained 16% of variance in postdischarge coping difficulty. Greater readiness for discharge was predictive of fewer readmissions. CONCLUSIONS: Quality of the delivery of discharge teaching was the strongest predictor of discharge readiness. Study results provided support for Meleis' transitions theory as a useful model for conceptualizing and investigating the discharge transition. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: The study results have implications for the <e>CNS</e> role in patient and staff education, system building for the postdischarge transition, and measurement of clinical care outcomes.",M1
17181851,"Telephonic management of rectal bleeding in young adults: a prospective randomized controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: The majority of young adults referred with rectal bleeding to a colorectal specialist clinic have a very low risk of serious disease such as cancer, and a high chance of gaining symptom relief by simple dietary changes. To determine whether young low-risk patients with rectal bleeding can be managed with a structured telephonic interview and dietary advice, rather than an outpatient visit. METHOD: A single-blinded, prospective, randomized controlled trial was performed in two stages. Patients under 40 years with rectal bleeding only were offered inclusion. Part-I trial: Patients were interviewed on telephone by the colorectal nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) and randomized to receive dietary advice (Advice Group) or not (Control Group). All patients were seen in clinic 6 weeks later by a doctor 'blinded' to their trial status. Part-II trial: Patients were interviewed on telephone by the CNS and again randomized to an Advice Group or a Control Group. The Control Group were seen in clinic 6 weeks later. The Advice Group were telephoned again 6 weeks later, and if their bleeding had stopped, were not brought to clinic. All patients were tracked for a year after the study to ensure no adverse diagnoses came to light. RESULTS: Part-I trial: 63 of 89 eligible patients were contactable and none refused the study. Seventy per cent of the Advice Group compared with 33% (P = 0.001) of the Control Group had symptomatic improvement when seen in clinic. Approximately 30% of each group required further treatment. Part-II trial: 54 of 94 eligible patients were contactable. However a further nine declined to enter the trial; 90% of patients in the Advice Group had improved at 6 weeks as judged by telephone interview compared with 56% of patients in the Control Group (P = 0.024) who were seen in clinic. The 90% of patients who improved in the Advice Group did not need to come to clinic to be seen. In both parts of the trial, the CNS identified a small number of patients with urgent symptoms at interview and brought them to clinic. The majority had anal fissures or haemorrhoids although in Part-II, one patient had ulcerative colitis and one had colorectal cancer. CONCLUSION: Telephonic consultation is an effective way of identifying those patients with urgent symptoms among a cohort of young adults referred to the hospital with rectal bleeding. Telephonic dietary advice leads to resolution of rectal bleeding in the majority of patients without urgent symptoms.",M1

17095396,"Advanced practice nursing in radiation oncology.OBJECTIVES: To discuss the roles of advance practice nurses in radiation oncology. DATA SOURCES: Published articles and textbooks, personal communications, and authors' experience. CONCLUSION: Radiation oncology advance practice nurses (NP and <e>CNS</e>) are becoming essential members of the multidisciplinary team, with distinct roles and responsibilities. Providing direct patient care, involvement in specialized procedures, and conducting initial and/or follow-up visits allows advance practitioners to become more involved with patients undergoing radiation therapy. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: As more combined modalities are being offered to patients undergoing oncology treatments and the complexity of patients are becoming more difficult, advance practice nurses can add value to the workload, quality patient care, and make a difference in patient's lives.",M1
16996428,"The patient's experience of a nurse-led nipple tattoo service: a successful program in Warwickshire.INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Although once the preserve of tattoo artists, units within the UK have increasingly begun making use of the Clinical Nurse Specialist (<e>CNS</e>) to perform areola tattooing. Bringing the technique within the Breast Unit enhances continuity of care and makes use of skills that can be provided by the CNS. Our CNS is involved with both the patients' oncological management and the areola tattoo service. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The CNS-led service was investigated and patients' experiences of nipple tattooing were assessed. We present the results of a postal questionnaire and a prospective clinical audit of the procedure. RESULTS: Forty tattoos were done over a 2-year period with one self-limiting complication. Patient satisfaction was high both with the outcome and the experience of the procedure. Fading of the tattoo is a consistent finding frequently requiring further shading. CONCLUSION: Overall the patient's experience of a nurse lead 'in-house' tattoo service has been highly satisfactory and this is reflected by their high confidence rating and ease of access to the nurse. We believe that the role of the CNS in oncological treatment and reconstructions helps integrate the multidisciplinary experience for the patient.",M1
16926738,"Exploring the role of community palliative care nurse specialists as educators.In the UK the clinical nurse specialist role (<e>CNS</e>) has evolved in an uncoordinated manner resulting in a broad job remit, with clinical, managerial, research and educational elements. CNSs working in specialist palliative care are expected to contribute to the delivery of education but many have received no formal training to support them in this aspect of their role. There has been limited research exploring the role the community palliative care CNS in providing education, making this study timely. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the role of the community palliative care CNS as educator. METHOD: Hermeneutic phenomenology, using semi-structured interviews with a convenience sample of eight community palliative care CNSs was the approach used. Formal ethical approval was obtained and all participants provided written informed consent. Colaizzi's framework for analysis provided a structured and transparent approach to data analysis. A summary of the findings were verified by the participants to enhance the credibility of interpretation presented here. RESULTS: Data analysis identified three main themes; conflict of expectations, credibility as a teacher and making the education role work. This study highlighted a team approach may address the conflict of expectations between the role specifications and practice reality. CONCLUSION: The CNS has a role in education. However for some CNSs, providing informal education rather than formal education may be appropriate. If the community palliative care CNS provides formal education, they require the knowledge and skills to deliver it effectively. The role of the CNS in palliative care education in the community should respond to personal, professional and local needs.",M1
16849931,"Development of an alcohol withdrawal protocol: <e>CNS</e> collaborative exemplar.PURPOSE: The purpose of this process improvement project was to develop an Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome (AWS) management protocol for acute care. SIGNIFICANCE: The prevalence of alcohol abuse in our society presents challenges for health professionals, and few nurses have received formal education on the identification and treatment of AWS, which has frequently resulted in ineffective, nonstandardized care. However, nurses practicing in medical-surgical, emergency, trauma, and critical care settings must be astute in the assessment and management of AWS. DESIGN/BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Following an analysis of existing management protocols, a behavioral health clinical nurse specialist was asked to lead a work team composed of physicians, pharmacists, and nurses to develop a new evidence-based alcohol withdrawal protocol for acute care. METHODS/DESCRIPTION: By implementing a standardized assessment tool and treatment protocol, clinical nurse specialists empowered nursing staff with strategies to prevent the serious medical complications associated with AWS. FINDINGS/OUTCOMES: The development and integration of a safe and effective treatment protocol to manage AWS was facilitated by collaborative, evidence-based decision making. CONCLUSION: Clinical experience and specialty expertise were integrated by clinical nurse specialists skilled in group dynamics, problem-solving, and the implementation of change. Improving care of patients in AWS is an exemplar for clinical nurse specialist roles as change agent and patient advocate.",M1
16849261,"Perceptions of barriers to psychiatric-mental health <e>CNS</e> practice.This descriptive study of practice barriers compared the perceptions of 67 psychiatric/mental health clinical nurse specialists (PMH-CNSs) with those of 767 nurse practitioners (NPs) in a single state. In addition, it contrasted the barriers identified by the rural and urban PMH-CNS study participants (n=14 and 53, respectively). Though all participants found the practice climate moderately restrictive on a 5-point Likert scale (1=very restrictive to 5=not restrictive), the PMH-CNSs found the practice environment significantly more restrictive than the NPs (3.13 versus 3.61, p&lt;.001). Lack of public knowledge of their advanced practice role was the top-ranking practice barrier for both NPs and PMH-CNSs (60% and 44%, respectively). Lack of understanding of their role was the next highest in rank (PMH-CNSs at 49%; NPs at 39%). CMH-CNSs noted resistance from physicians and/or psychologists as their third-highest barrier (42%); the NPs did not rank this barrier in their top five. Rural PMH-CNSs perceived a lack of a peer network as a considerable barrier (57%); however, urban PMH-CNSs did not rank this in their top barriers, indicating that rural professional isolation needs to be addressed. These findings indicate that efforts to educate the public and other professionals about advanced practice nursing roles and issues must be a priority, and other barriers such as salary and isolation continue to hamper the role success of PMH-CNSs.",M1
16705287,"A <e>CNS</e>-facilitated ICD support group: a clinical project evaluation.PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to describe and evaluate a clinical nurse specialist (CNS)-facilitated support group for recipients of implantable cardioverter defibrillator. Specific evaluation aims were as follows: (1) How do demographic and clinical factors differ between those who attended the support group and those who did not? (2) Is there a difference in the quality of life index (QLI) of individuals with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator who attended the CNS-facilitated support group and those who did not? (3) What demographic and clinical factors are related to QLI? DESIGN AND METHOD: Clinical project theory-based objectives were described. Implementation of the project was evaluated by retrospective survey of all implantable cardioverter defibrillator recipients during a 10-year time frame using the Ferrans and Powers' Quality of Life Index: Cardiac Version and demographic questionnaire. Attendance sheets defined who attended so comparisons could be made. EVALUATION RESULTS: One hundred and twelve surveys were returned (34% return rate). A positive relationship between CNS visit during hospitalization, number of and value of supports, years of education, and ejection fraction was noted with attendance at the support group. No between-group differences on total QLI, or on any subscales, were found. Comorbidity was the only clinical factor correlated with QLI. CONCLUSION: CNS-facilitated support groups can be offered as an additional support. Evaluation design issues limited the measuring outcomes of existing interventions. Future prospective studies are recommended to determine the affect of the support group on quality of life.",M1

16684194,"Matching a graduate curriculum in public/community health nursing to practice competencies: the Rush University experience.An evidence-based approach to Public/Community Health Nursing (P/CHN) requires that P/CHN educators prepare practitioners with the relevant skills, attitudes, and knowledge. Such education should be competency-based and have measurable outcomes to demonstrate student preparation. In 2003, the Quad Council competencies were developed to be applied at two levels of public health nursing practice: the staff nurse/generalist role and the manager/specialist/consultant role. This paper describes a process for evaluation and revision of a graduate curriculum to prepare Advanced Practice Clinical Nurse Specialists (<e>CNS</e>) in P/CHN, to ensure that the educational program addresses and develops knowledge and proficiency in all relevant competencies. This paper documents the process of integrating the competencies throughout the P/CHN graduate curriculum at varying levels, guiding students to achieve proficiency in each competency by the end of the program. Measurement of achievement in these competencies will be discussed, and examples provided. Advanced Practice Public Health Nurses educated via this competency-based approach will be prepared to sit for national certification as a CNS in Public/Community Health, and to assume leadership roles in public health nursing.",M1
16609281,"Achieving clinical nurse specialist competencies and outcomes through interdisciplinary education.Without formal education, many healthcare professionals fail to develop interdisciplinary team skills; however, when students are socialized to interdisciplinary practice through academic clinical learning experiences, effective collaboration skills can be developed. Increasingly, educational environments are challenged to include clinical experiences for students that teach and model interdisciplinary collaboration. PURPOSE: The purpose of this quality improvement initiative was to create an interdisciplinary educational experience for clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) students and postgraduate physicians. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT: The interdisciplinary learning experience, supported by an educational grant, provided an interdisciplinary cohort of learners an opportunity to engage in a clinically focused learning experience. The interdisciplinary cohort consisted of CNS students and physicians in various stages of postgraduate training. The clinical experience selected was a quality improvement initiative in which the students were introduced to the concepts and tools of quality improvement. During this 1-month clinical experience, students applied the new skills by implementing a quality improvement project focusing on medication reconciliation in the outpatient setting. The CNS core competencies and outcomes were used to shape the experience for the CNS students. OUTCOME: The CNS students exhibited 5 of the 7 essential characteristics of the CNS (leadership, collaboration, consultation skills, ethical conduct, and professional attributes) while demonstrating competencies and fulfilling performance expectations. During this learning experience, the CNS students focused on competencies and outcomes in the organizational sphere of influence. Multiple facilitating factors and barriers were identified. CONCLUSION: This interdisciplinary clinical experience in a quality improvement initiative provided valuable opportunities for CNS students to develop essential CNS characteristics and to explore practice competencies in the area of systems. IMPLICATIONS: Interdisciplinary clinical experiences offer students opportunities to develop needed collaboration and communication skills. Educators should create interdisciplinary educational experiences for students to better prepare them for their roles in a clinical setting.",M1

BACKGROUND/RATIONALE: Clinical nurse specialists design, implement, and evaluate research to develop specific prevention and intervention strategies for populations. Much of this research is conducted in the tertiary setting although many of the interventions are carried out in the community setting. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT: A sample of rural women (N = 578) participated in a community-based survey to determine characteristics which influence safer sex behaviors. OUTCOME: Results of the survey suggest that age, education, and relationship status influence safer sex behaviors. Women in the community tended to believe that safer sex behaviors were linked to pregnancy prevention and lacked understanding about the importance of safer sex behaviors to prevent sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS. INTERPRETATION/CONCLUSION: The findings of this study can inform CNSs about sex behaviors among women in a selected community, translating community-based research into evidence-based, patient-centered care. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICE: Results from community-based research can be used to develop educational and prevention programs, and interventions for specialty populations.",M1

16502964,"Nursing skill mix and nursing time: the roles of registered nurses and clinical nurse specialists.OBJECTIVE: The roles of clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNS</e>) and registered nurses, while similar, should also be quite different, with the CNS functioning as an advanced practice nurse. Differences in roles can be partially explained and understood by examining the use of their time. Adjustments to skill mix usually involve using more plentiful but less-skilled workers, and there is a growing body of overseas research in this field. In contrast, little research has examined and compared the use of nursing time for the RN and CNS role, particularly in an Australian context. Comparing work activities enables employers to begin to answer the question: Are skilled nursing personnel being used effectively and efficiently? DESIGN: A work-sampling study conducted over eight weeks. Data were analysed descriptively using SPSS, v.9. SETTING: Six wards in a large private not-for-profit hospital. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: To determine whether there is a differentiation in the roles of CNS and RN by examining the percentage of time spent in 25 specific activities. RESULTS: In some activities it is not possible to distinguish differences in the amount of time spent by RNs and CNSs. In other activities such as clerical, meetings and administration, CNSs are spending more time than anticipated. Consideration needs to be given to employing clerical staff to relieve the CNS of these non-clinical aspects. CONCLUSION: The study extends the understanding of the roles of registered nurses and clinical nurse specialists and provides a basis on which to begin to understand similarities and differences in their roles.",M1
16496732,"The effects of master's degree education on the role choices, role flexibility, and practice settings of clinical nurse specialists and nurse practitioners.Master's degree education that explores advanced practice nursing (APN) roles in multiple settings may increase APN roles and practice viability in ever-changing health care environments. This descriptive, comparative study investigated differences in role choices, role flexibility, and practice settings among master's prepared clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNSs</e>) and nurse practitioners (NPs) educated in specialized and combined programs using multivariate analysis of variance. Role theory delineates activities in specific societal roles that are recognized as activities practiced always, sometimes, or never by all, some, or none of its members. Role specialization is determined by the amount and frequency that activities are performed by others in similar roles. Significant differences were found between groups on actual and preferred percentage of time spent in APN roles. The CNS group spent more time in acute care and mental health settings, and the NP and Combined groups spent more time in clinic and primary care settings.",M1
16481072,"The self-reported learning style preferences of female Macmillan clinical nurse specialists.Individuals typically adopt and prefer one or two learning styles and therefore, by default, remaining learning styles are underutilised. Insight into learning style preferences confers interpersonal benefits to both learners and teachers. Enlightened learners and teachers can identify their dominant learning styles and potentially strengthen underutilised ones. Findings from a retrospective study commissioned by Macmillan Cancer Relief that investigated learning style preferences of 137 female Macmillan Clinical Nurse Specialists (<e>CNSs</e>) showed that the majority (73.7%) displayed a strong-very strong preference for one or two learning styles. Mean scores across four learning styles were highest for the reflector learning style (mu=14.85+/-3.16) followed by theorist (mu=12.2+/-2.87), pragmatist (mu=11.5 (2.85) and activist (mu=7.95+/-3.11).

16294057,"Spheres of clinical nurse specialist practice influence evidence-based care for patients with atrial fibrillation.PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to review atrial fibrillation (AF) and its consequences, to present sources of published evidence-based guidelines for management of AF, and to highlight multifaceted clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) interventions that promote positive outcomes for patients with AF. RATIONALE: The number of people with AF is expected to increase from 2.3 million to more than 5 million in the next 50 years. AF is associated with increased mortality, morbidity, healthcare expenditures, and decreased quality of life. Recognition of the growing number of AF cases and adverse consequences of AF led to development of evidence-based guidelines for AF management. Although nurses in diverse settings are accountable for providing evidence-based care for patients with AF, the guidelines have not been widely disseminated to nurses. DESCRIPTION: This discussion includes a review of the adverse consequences of AF and a summary of management of recently detected AF with a focus on recommendations for nursing activities/interventions that are supported by evidence-based guidelines. Multifaceted strategies directed toward nurses and nursing practice, patients/clients, and organizations/systems that are linked to published CNS competencies and outcomes are highlighted. OUTCOMES: CNS influence in all 3 spheres of CNS practice promotes positive outcomes that include improved patient/client functioning and self-management, reduced complications of treatment, decreased fragmentation of care, advancement of professional nursing practice, adherence to regulatory standards, and development of patient care processes that are supported by published guidelines.

16194647,"Effect of a nurse team coordinator on outcomes for hospitalized medicine patients.PURPOSE: Several randomized trials have found that discharge planning improves outcomes for hospitalized patients. We do not know if adding a clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) to physician teams in hospitals that already have discharge planning services makes a difference. METHODS: In 2 teaching hospitals, patients were randomly assigned to regular hospital care or care with a clinical nurse specialist. The clinical nurse specialist facilitated hospital care by retrieving preadmission information, arranging in-hospital consultations and investigations, organizing postdischarge follow-up visits, and checking up on patients postdischarge with a telephone call. In-hospital outcomes included mortality and length of stay. Postdischarge outcomes included time to readmission or death, patient satisfaction, and the risk of adverse event. Adverse events were poor outcomes due to medical care rather than the natural history of disease. RESULTS: A total of 620 sequential patients were randomized (CNS n = 307, control n = 313), of which 361 were followed after discharge from hospital (CNS n = 175, control n = 186). The groups were similar for the probability of in-hospital death (CNS 9.3% vs control 9.7%) or being discharged to the community (58.0% vs 60.0%). The groups did not differ for postdischarge outcomes including readmission or death (21.6% vs 15.6%; P = 0.16) or risk of adverse event (23.6% vs 22.8%). Mean [SD] patient ratings of overall quality of care on a scale of 10 was higher in the clinical nurse specialist group (8.2 [2.2] vs 7.6 [2.4]; P = 0.052). CONCLUSION: The addition of a clinical nurse specialist to a medical team improved patient satisfaction but did not impact hospital efficiency or patient safety.",M1

16079361,"Clinical nurse specialist and evidence-based practice: managing anthracycline extravasation.The clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) is a clinical expert and client advocate in a specialized area of nursing practice, who directs efforts toward the improvement of nursing care. The CNS role is essential in closing the therapeutic gap between the development of science knowledge and its implementation in daily patient care situations. An essential step in developing evidence-based interventions is rating the quality of the evidence. An example of the CNS's role in improving care can be found in a response to an anthracycline extravasation. The clinical standard for extravasation was amended to incorporate new evidence-based guidelines that included prevention of extravasation and a new assessment method and intervention. When an extravasation is suspected with an anthracycline agent, a Wood's lamp (ultraviolet lamp) is shined on the area of interest, in a dark room. The anthracycline extravasation area, if present, will illuminate in the lamp's light. In addition to the standard interventions of topical DMSO applications, current literature also suggests an intravenous infusion of dexrazoxane (Zinecard) as an effective antidote to prevent tissue damage.",M1

15985097,"Reaching for the stars: career advancement and the registered nurse.Clinical nursing has long struggled to secure the place of primacy it deserves in the profession's hierarchy of importance and worth. It is ironic that, even at the beginning of the 21st century, a clinical nurse is generally not as well-recognized, rewarded or remunerated as a colleague working in nursing management, education or research. Until the profession recognizes and takes serious action to remedy this situation, the crisis of recruitment and retention in nursing currently ravaging the globe is likely to continue. In this paper, I present a discursive account of an exciting initiative by a leading private, acute-care hospital which addresses this very problem. A new ladder for clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNSs</e>) introduces a rigorous and systematic approach to the appointment of three classifications of CNS, each requiring evidence of successively higher levels of competency, and which are accompanied by fiscal reward and stronger peer recognition.",M1
15924030,"Differentiating between a consultant nurse and a clinical nurse specialist.With the introduction of nurse consultants, and regulation of the use of the designation 'specialist nurse', experienced practitioners such as clinical nurse specialists have seen their position eroded. Nurse consultants are a new NHS-employment category, and are expected to be at the top rank of the profession both in status and in salary. However, this article argues that nurses at various levels have the same core functions, and that these do not differ for nurse consultants. Distinguishing between practitioners that might have the same job description could be better done by measuring outcomes. More care needs to be taken over the use of words such as 'expert', which is used differently in different contexts, and it is suggested that competencies be developed by which to measure the effects of expertise. Although nurse consultant appointments are often driven by various political directives and they are employed to meet local and national priorities, difficult issues need to be faced. First, if nurse consultant jobs are the top of the clinical career ladder, will clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNSs</e>) need to accept a lower rung on it? Further, perhaps the title CNS should become obsolete or be regulated? Can CNSs claim parity of pay using the 'Agenda for Change' framework?",M1

15897771,"FAMISHED for support: recovering elders after cardiac events.BACKGROUND: Heart disease causes disproportionately heavy burdens on unpartnered elders (widowed, divorced, never married) who have limited social resources to contend with recovery demands and complications resulting from acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) surgery. Research suggests that the availability of social support improves recovery after AMI and CABG, yet functional support expressly designed to modify health and stimulate recovery remains unspecified. Advanced practice nurses (APNs) in the clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) role who provide social support to recovering elders may be able to improve health outcomes for this vulnerable group. AIMS: The investigators' aims are to (1) quantify the duration and frequency of nurse contact with unpartnered elders recovering from cardiac events and (2) describe the functional support provided by the CNS to the unpartnered recovering elder. METHODS: Forty narrative accounts comprising 670 entries by interventional CNS APNs were examined using thematic analytic techniques. RESULTS: Over a 14-week period, CNS APNs contacted recovering elders 16 times, with a total of 4.5 hours spent per elder, or 13 minutes per phone call and 80 minutes per home visit. Analysis of 670 entries demonstrated functional and emotional support that was captured in the acronym, FAMISHED. CONCLUSIONS: Functional and emotional support from the CNS may enhance self-efficacy for recovery from cardiac events for unpartnered elders.",M1

15784481,"The introduction of a nutrition clinical nurse specialist results in a reduction in the rate of catheter sepsis.BACKGROUND: Catheter-related sepsis remains the major confounding factor in the long-term delivery of TPN. Previous studies have shown that the introduction of clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNS</e>) can lead to a reduction in sepsis from TPN catheters. This retrospective study aimed to determine the impact of a nutrition CNS on the rate of catheter-related sepsis. Furthermore, the cost of providing such a service was examined to see if it was offset from the savings obtained from reducing venous access infection. METHODS: Prior to the employment of a nutrition CNS, the total number of septic catheter complications were retrospectively collected over a 12-month period. Following appointment of the CNS, all patients requiring TPN were prospectively studied for signs of catheter-related sepsis and the data collected over a 4-year period. RESULTS: The overall sepsis rate (cumulative percentage) fell significantly in the 4-year period after the nutrition CNS was appointed, from 52% to 2.3%. The reduction in venous catheter access was accompanied by a decrease in cost related to wastage of TPN and insertion of new Hickman lines. CONCLUSION: The role of the CNS is primarily to improve the quality of care provided, but also to provide cost effectiveness. We have demonstrated that in addition to reducing infection rate of central venous catheters; the cost of employing a nutrition CNS is almost completely covered by the savings resulting from the reduction in wasted central venous catheters, TPN and operating time.",M1

This article describes the critical care technical skills training mechanisms and use of a High-Fidelity Human Simulation (HFHS) Laboratory in the ACNP and CNS programs at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing. The mechanisms for teaching invasive procedures are reviewed including an abbreviated course syllabus and documentation tools. The use of HFHS is discussed as a measure to provide students with technical and cognitive preparation to manage critical incidents. The HFHS Laboratory, scenario development and implementation, and the debriefing process are discussed. Critical care technical skills training and the use of simulation in the curriculum have had a favorable response from students and preceptors at the University of Pittsburgh School of Nursing, and have enhanced faculty's ability to prepare APNs.",M1
15709339,"How five advanced practice nurses in nephrology spend their time.The purpose of this paper is to report the results of a descriptive study undertaken to examine the scope of practice of five Masters-prepared nephrology nurse practitioner/clinical nurse specialists (NP/<e>CNS</e>) in a mid-size university teaching hospital program. Four of the NP/CNSs practised in three acute care sites, and one in the regional dialysis program. Impetus for the study came from two sources. First, a sixth person practising in the role was retiring and was not to be replaced. Second, the current three-site model for acute care was being transformed into a two-site model, thus creating opportunities to reduce variability in practice among the NP/CNSs. The study examined the activities of the NP/CNS role through the completion of a time documentation tool (TDT) by five nurse practitioners on each of 10 consecutive days of practice. The TDT was adapted from Ackerman's Model of Advanced Practice (1996). The model outlines five domains of practice for advanced practice nurses (APN): direct comprehensive care, support of systems, research, education, and publication and professional leadership. The NP/CNSs spent an average of 9.21 hours at work daily with a range of 8.6 to 10.3 hours. The TDT captured an average of 8.6 hours of working time with a range of 7.3 to 9.9 hours. An average of 72% of time was spent in clinical practice (range 64-83%). An average of 16% (range 11-20%) of time was spent in support of systems. Research (average 4%, range 3-7%), education (average 6%, range 3-16%), and publication and professional leadership (average 2%, range 0-6%) figured less prominently. The major activities performed within the clinical practice domain and the support of systems domain showed less variability across sites than was anticipated. The results of the study have helped the NP/CNSs and their management colleagues analyze and adapt the role to changing clinical requirements and economic realities.",M1
15684896,"The practice of certified community health <e>CNSs</e>.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: This study explored the practice of clinical nurse specialists (CNSs) certified in Community Health nursing in the United States and described demographic and employment characteristics and perspectives about professional practice. METHODS: The survey method was used. Of the 209 Community Health CNSs certified by American Nurses Credentialing Center (ANCC) invited to complete the investigator-designed mail questionnaire, 111 (53%) returned a completed questionnaire. The questionnaire contained 27 items about employment, income, years in practice, certification, career satisfaction, and educational preparation, and asked participants to indicate the fit between the Community Health CNS role and the traditional CNS subroles model described by the American Nurses Association (ANA) (The Role of the Clinical Nurse Specialist, 1986) and the updated National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (NACNS) CNS practice model (Statement on Clinical Nurse Specialist Practice and Education, 1998). Content validity was established by Community Health CNS reviewer feedback. ANALYSIS: Quantifiable data were tallied and analyzed using standard spreadsheet computer software. Qualitative data were summarized for content themes. FINDINGS: The majority of participants were white, middle-aged females who reported being satisfied with their careers as Community Health CNSs. Most indicated that they were respected by colleagues, that they had been adequately prepared by their education, and that their current work made good use of their education and expertise. When asked to identify, by percentage of effort, the fit between their job responsibilities and the traditional subroles model of practice, the mean of reported fit was as follows: educator, 35%; administrator/leader, 22%; clinician, 21%; consultant, 14%; and researcher, 8%. The fit between job responsibilities and the spheres of influence in the NACNS model of practice was reported to average 39% for patient/client, 35% for organization/network, and 25% for nurses/ nursing practice. CONCLUSIONS: Community Health CNS is a viable specialty practice with long-term career options. The subrole functions-described by ANA-of clinician, educator, administrator/leader, consultant, and to a lesser extent researcher apply to the role. The more intergraded updated model offered by NACNS also fits Community Health CNS practice with more emphasis on patient/client and organization/ network spheres than on nurses/nursing practice sphere. IMPLICATIONS: Schools of nursing should continue to offer the Community Health CNS programs and incorporate both the traditional functions and newer practice model into their curricula, with a greater emphasis on diversity of students to help ensure a more diverse CNS population. Further research is needed to explore the outcomes of Community Health CNS practice and the factors that contribute to role satisfaction.",M1

15541060,"Clinical nurse specialist care managers' time commitments in a disease-management program for bipolar disorder.OBJECTIVES: As part of a cost-effectiveness analysis for Department of Veterans Affairs Cooperative Studies Program #430, 'Reducing the Efficacy-Effectiveness Gap in Bipolar Disorder,' we conducted a time and motion study to quantify the time psychiatric clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) care managers spent providing care for patients. METHODS: Clinical nurse specialist care managers completed activity logs in which they recorded time spent implementing the Bipolar Disorders Program (BDP) during a 1-week period in spring, summer, fall and winter over a 1-year period when caseloads were at steady state. Mean service time was estimated by use of univariate analysis of means and by multivariable regression analysis. RESULTS: On average CNS care managers spent 40% of their clinical time in activities that typically are reimbursed (e.g. clinic visits) and spent the remaining 60% of their time in activities that are typically unreimbursed. Total clinic time increased as the number of visits per day increased; however, this increase got smaller with each additional visit per day. CONCLUSIONS: As with other chronic illness management programs, CNS care managers expend a substantial portion of their clinical effort for the BDP in activities that are typically unreimbursed. Their activities have a fixed component per day as well as a component that systematically varies with the number of visits per day. These findings should be considered when costing out and disseminating psychiatric and other medical chronic illness management programs.",M1

Inadequate codes prevent decision makers from having essential health-related information at their fingertips. ABC codes improve business processes and health industry efficiencies in the same manner that universal product codes (UPCs/bar codes) improved the retail operations and the retail industry. The codes are essential to research, management, and commerce. In healthcare, the combination of ABC codes with older medical and dental code sets allows many essential business processes (such as forecasting, practice management, insurance billing, claims processing, and third-party reimbursement) to be fully automated. The codes also help digitize information to simplify data collection, analysis, and reporting. This improves the quality of data and accelerates the speed with which conclusions can be drawn from those data about what works in US healthcare and why. By offering CNSs more complete, accurate, and precise information on best practices, ABC codes help ensure that CNSs and others can generate better outcomes in addressing health-related challenges faced by patients/clients, nurses, and nursing practices, and the nation's health-promoting organizations and systems.",M1

DESIGN: This descriptive study used the survey method with a convenient sample. SETTING: Potential subjects received the research study packet at the address designated by them for membership mailings sent from the National Association of Clinical Nurse Specialists (NACNS). SAMPLE: The population of interest was practicing CNSs. The accessible population was NACNS members drawn from the 2002 mailing list organized by zip code. Every third mailing label was skipped. The remaining list members (N = 950) received a study packet. There was a 14.42% response rate with 137 respondents. Eighty-two percent held a master's degree in nursing. METHODS: A 46 item multiple-choice examination was developed based upon a content map established after a review of the available Medicare-related literature and consultation with Medicare advanced practice nurse providers. Content validity was established. Survey packets with the instrument, Scantron answer key, informational letter, and demographic profile were sent to potential subjects. Returned responses were keyed for correct answers. Relationships between demographic variables, raw score, and self-reported Medicare expertise were analyzed. Qualitative data elicited on the demographic form were thematically analyzed. FINDINGS: The examination had a.67 coefficient. Correlation of examination raw score to self-reported Medicare content expertise was 0.982 (P =.000). One third of the examination questions were incorrectly answered by 30% or more of respondents. Percentage correct scores ranged from 60.9 to 95.7 (M = 62.7%; SD = 10.46). Respondents offered 40 comments. Eleven comments related to a self-recognized Medicare knowledge deficit. Four responses highlighted that graduate studies had not provided them with the knowledge necessary for understanding reimbursement issues. Ten respondents expressed an interest in locating some type of educational resource addressing the Medicare system, reimbursement processes, and opportunities. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that NACNS members have Medicare program knowledge deficits. Respondents recognize their deficiencies and are interested in obtaining more information about Medicare but are uncertain as to available resources or networking opportunities that might support them in this process. Graduate nursing programs may need to evaluate the amount of information provided within curriculums specific to insurance reimbursement and Medicare structures and processes. Study limitations include the low response rate and indeterminate sample representativeness. IMPLICATIONS FOR PRACTICE: Educators should examine CNS curriculums to ensure the adequacy of Medicare program information. Continuing education programs and conference workshops addressing Medicare information should be offered to CNSs interested in increasing their expertise or exploring provider opportunities. There may be entrepreneurial opportunities available to CNSs interested in developing an expertise in Medicare programs. Future research studies should quantify potential benefits to Medicare beneficiaries when CNSs participate as providers.",M1

15164668,"The effectiveness of a <e>CNS</e>-led community-based COPD screening and intervention program.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a screening program in identifying undiagnosed individuals with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). THEORETICAL RATIONALE: Underdiagnosis of COPD is common. Symptoms do not usually become apparent until the disease is advanced. Consequently, by the time a diagnosis of COPD is made, based on symptoms, the individual has often lost up to 50% or more of their original lung capacity. Early diagnosis and intervention has been demonstrated to have an impact in slowing the progression of the disease. The study was based on the premise that when individuals become self-aware of their risk factors related to disease, they are more likely to change their behaviors. The Transtheoretical Model describes how individuals move through various stages of change and how they can be helped in transitioning from one stage to another. DESCRIPTION OF THE PROJECT: Subjects (n = 243) were recruited via letter, newspaper, and physician referral. The screening program consisted of (1) pulmonary function testing using a handheld spirometry device, (2) education about the test results and COPD, and (3) smoking cessation counseling. Current smokers and those found to have obstruction were contacted at 8 to 12 weeks after screening. OUTCOME: Results indicated that 209 (86%) of participants were at risk for developing COPD as evidenced by current or past smoking status. Mild to moderate stage obstructive disease was found in 55 subjects (23%). Of 61 subjects contacted after the screening, 29 smokers (47%) indicated they had stopped smoking, were in the process of quitting, or were seriously considering quitting. CONCLUSIONS: Results support the use of a community-screening program to identify and help modify risk factors for COPD. IMPLICATIONS FOR NURSING PRACTICES: This project provides an example of how a clinical nurse specialist (CNS) can exercise all the spheres of CNS influence: the patient/client sphere, the nursing personnel sphere, and the organization sphere. In addition, the COPD screening project demonstrated how a CNS can successfully lead and direct a community initiative and influence others in changing behavior to enhance their state of health.",M1

Establishing clarity about the nursing focused and medical focused definitions of advanced practice can greatly assist in developing and implementing appropriate levels of regulation for the CNS role and scope of practice. It has been my experience that state boards of nursing want to do their very best in helping to protect the public while not creating insurmountable problems that essentially put APRNs such as CNSs out of work and raise restraint of trade issues. Currently, in some states, there is real economic harm being experienced by CNSs because they cannot get jobs as CNSs when they have been practicing within the domains of the RN license for 10 or more years. I believe the inappropriate regulation of CNSs in some states is occurring because CNSs did not have an organization to represent them at national policy tables until 1995. Therefore, we weren't  at the table  in the early development of recognition strategies for APRNs to help state boards and other policy making groups understand how the CNS practice and role is different from other APRN roles. We must help state boards of nursing clarify the level of regulation needed for both the CNS without and the CNS with prescriptive authority.

A literature review of economic studies of clinical nurse specialists (<e>CNSs</e>) was undertaken to assess how the measurement of economic outcomes has been tackled in the literature to date. The initial search found 400 studies. Abstracts from all the studies were reviewed but only 17 studies met the basic criteria for inclusion, reporting primary cost and outcomes data, and clearly specifying the role of a CNS. All of the studies but one focused on direct patient care rather than other CNS roles and were undertaken alongside effectiveness studies. The economic evaluations considered only a narrow range of costs, but a wide range of outcomes. Specific nursing outcomes were only reported in a minority of studies. None of the studies reported cost-effectiveness ratios. However, CNS interventions were reported to be both less costly and more effective than alternative forms of care, negating the need for further cost-effectiveness analysis. Overall, the papers were not of good quality, reducing the validity of the findings. Robust economic evaluations of the CNS role need to be undertaken. These should involve nursing researchers and practitioners so that evaluations reflect the complex and multidimensional nature of CNS care and meet the required standard of evidence to influence practice.",M1

A major component of their work focuses on the delivery of emotional care and support to patients and their families. AIM: This paper critically examines the literature on emotional care and support for patients with advanced cancer requiring palliative care. The aim is to increase understanding of how CNSs and patients interact and work together to produce emotionally supportive relationships. METHODS: A literature search was performed using the CINAHL, MEDLINE and ASSIA CD-ROM databases and combinations of the key words: 'emotional support', 'emotional care', 'end of life', 'palliative', 'terminal illness', 'advanced cancer', 'Clinical Nurse Specialist', 'emotional labour'. Additional relevant articles were identified from the reference lists of papers identified by the literature search. FINDINGS: The literature revealed a lack of clarity about the terms used to describe emotional care and support. However, at the same time, there is a taken for granted assumption that a shared understanding of these terms exists. Developing supportive nurse-patient relationships involves a complex process, one that consists of getting to 'know the patient' through the effective use of communication skills, in a variety of health care contexts. The costs of engaging in 'emotion work' are highlighted. CONCLUSIONS: Existing research fails to recognize that emotional care and support as a concept is not a fixed, stable entity learnt through experience and socialization, but is moulded by the process of social interaction and by specific contexts and theoretical perspectives.

12906341,"Integrating clinical nurse specialists into the treatment of primary care patients with depression.OBJECTIVE: To examine the effectiveness of integrating generalist and specialist care for veterans with depression. METHOD: We conducted a randomized trial of patients screening positive for depression at two Veterans Affairs Medical Center general medicine clinic firms. Control firm physicians were notified prior to the encounter when eligible patients had PRIME-MD depression diagnoses. In the intervention firm, a mental health clinical nurse specialist (<e>CNS</e>) was to: design a treatment plan; implement that plan with the primary care physician; and monitor patients via telephone or visits at two weeks, one month and two months. Primary outcomes (depressive symptoms, patient satisfaction with health care) were collected at 3 and 12 months. RESULTS: Of 268 randomized patients, 246 (92%) and 222 (83%) completed 3- and 12-month follow-up interviews. There were no between-group differences in depressive symptoms or satisfaction at 3 or 12 months. The intervention group had greater chart documentation of depression at baseline (63% versus 33%, p = 0.003) and a higher referral rate to mental health services at 3 months (27% versus 9%, p = 0.019). There was no difference in the rate of new prescriptions for, or adequate dosing of, anti-depressant medications. In 40% of patients, CNSs disagreed with the PRIME-MD depression diagnosis, and their rates of watchful waiting were correspondingly high. CONCLUSIONS: Implementing an integrated care model did not occur as intended. Experienced CNSs often did not see the need for treatment in many primary care patients identified by the PRIME-MD. Integrating integrated care models in actual practice may prove challenging.",M1
20577213,"Subcapsular sinus macrophages prevent <e>CNS</e> invasion on peripheral infection with a neurotropic virus.Lymph nodes (LNs) capture microorganisms that breach the body's external barriers and enter draining lymphatics, limiting the systemic spread of pathogens. Recent work has shown that CD11b(+)CD169(+) macrophages, which populate the subcapsular sinus (SCS) of LNs, are critical for the clearance of viruses from the lymph and for initiating antiviral humoral immune responses. Here we show, using vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV), a relative of rabies virus transmitted by insect bites, that SCS macrophages perform a third vital function: they prevent lymph-borne neurotropic viruses from infecting the central nervous system (CNS). On local depletion of LN macrophages, about 60% of mice developed ascending paralysis and died 7-10 days after subcutaneous infection with a small dose of VSV, whereas macrophage-sufficient animals remained asymptomatic and cleared the virus. VSV gained access to the nervous system through peripheral nerves in macrophage-depleted LNs. In contrast, within macrophage-sufficient LNs VSV replicated preferentially in SCS macrophages but not in adjacent nerves. Removal of SCS macrophages did not compromise adaptive immune responses against VSV, but decreased type I interferon (IFN-I) production within infected LNs. VSV-infected macrophages recruited IFN-I-producing plasmacytoid dendritic cells to the SCS and in addition were a major source of IFN-I themselves. Experiments in bone marrow chimaeric mice revealed that IFN-I must act on both haematopoietic and stromal compartments, including the intranodal nerves, to prevent lethal infection with VSV. These results identify SCS macrophages as crucial gatekeepers to the CNS that prevent fatal viral invasion of the nervous system on peripheral infection.",M2
20488789,"Meningeal mast cells affect early T cell central nervous system infiltration and blood-brain barrier integrity through TNF: a role for neutrophil recruitment?Mast cells contribute to the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, a rodent model of the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis. Yet their site and mode of action is unknown. In both diseases, myelin-specific T cells are initially activated in peripheral lymphoid organs. However, for disease to occur, these cells must enter the immunologically privileged <e>CNS</e> through a breach in the relatively impermeable blood-brain barrier. In this study, we demonstrate that a dense population of resident mast cells in the meninges, structures surrounding the brain and spinal cord, regulate basal CNS barrier function, facilitating initial T cell CNS entry. Through the expression of TNF, mast cells recruit an early wave of neutrophils to the CNS. We propose that neutrophils in turn promote the blood-brain barrier breach and together with T cells lead to further inflammatory cell influx and myelin damage. These findings provide specific targets for intervention in multiple sclerosis as well as other immune-mediated CNS diseases.",M2
20445073,"Sialyltransferase regulates nervous system function in Drosophila.In vertebrates, sialylated glycans participate in a wide range of biological processes and affect the development and function of the nervous system. While the complexity of glycosylation and the functional redundancy among sialyltransferases provide obstacles for revealing biological roles of sialylation in mammals, Drosophila possesses a sole vertebrate-type sialyltransferase, Drosophila sialyltransferase (DSiaT), with significant homology to its mammalian counterparts, suggesting that Drosophila could be a suitable model to investigate the function of sialylation. To explore this possibility and investigate the role of sialylation in Drosophila, we inactivated DSiaT in vivo by gene targeting and analyzed phenotypes of DSiaT mutants using a combination of behavioral, immunolabeling, electrophysiological, and pharmacological approaches. Our experiments demonstrated that DSiaT expression is restricted to a subset of <e>CNS</e> neurons throughout development. We found that DSiaT mutations result in significantly decreased life span, locomotor abnormalities, temperature-sensitive paralysis, and defects of neuromuscular junctions. Our results indicate that DSiaT regulates neuronal excitability and affects the function of a voltage-gated sodium channel. Finally, we showed that sialyltransferase activity is required for DSiaT function in vivo, which suggests that DSiaT mutant phenotypes result from a defect in sialylation of N-glycans. This work provided the first evidence that sialylation has an important biological function in protostomes, while also revealing a novel, nervous system-specific function of alpha2,6-sialylation. Thus, our data shed light on one of the most ancient functions of sialic acids in metazoan organisms and suggest a possibility that this function is evolutionarily conserved between flies and mammals.",M2

However, inflammation of the distinct anatomical sites (i.e., meninges, cerebrospinal fluid, and parenchyma) associated with the CNS can also be deleterious. Therefore, control of lymphocyte entry and migration within the brain is vital to regulate protective and pathological responses. In this review, several recent advances are highlighted that provide new insights into the processes that regulate leukocyte access to, and movement within, the brain.",M2

Efficiency of a method is shown in positive effects on mental sphere of a person, causing decrease in level of uneasiness and improvement of subjective self-assessment, in influence on cognitive and autonomic functions.

20427655,"<e>CNS</e>/PNS boundary transgression by central glia in the absence of Schwann cells or Krox20/Egr2 function.CNS/PNS interfaces constitute cell boundaries, because they delimit territories with different neuronal and glial contents. Despite their potential interest in regenerative medicine, the mechanisms restricting oligodendrocytes and astrocytes to the CNS and Schwann cells to the PNS in mammals are not known. To investigate the involvement of peripheral glia and myelin in the maintenance of the CNS/PNS boundary, we have first made use of different mouse mutants. We show that depletion of Schwann cells and boundary cap cells or inactivation of Krox20/Egr2, a master regulatory gene for myelination in Schwann cells, results in transgression of the CNS/PNS boundary by astrocytes and oligodendrocytes and in myelination of nerve root axons by oligodendrocytes. In contrast, such migration does not occur with the Trembler(J) mutation, which prevents PNS myelination without affecting Krox20 expression. Altogether, these data suggest that maintenance of the CNS/PNS boundary requires a Krox20 function separable from myelination control. Finally, we have analyzed a human patient affected by a congenital amyelinating neuropathy, associated with the absence of the KROX20 protein in Schwann cells. In this case, the nerve roots were also invaded by oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This indicates that transgression of the CNS/PNS boundary by central glia can occur in pathological situations in humans and suggests that the underlying mechanisms are common with the mouse.",M2
20426846,"Human intronic enhancers control distinct sub-domains of Gli3 expression during mouse <e>CNS</e> and limb development.BACKGROUND: The zinc-finger transcription factor GLI3 is an important mediator of Sonic hedgehog signaling and crucial for patterning of many aspects of the vertebrate body plan. In vertebrates, the mechanism of SHH signal transduction and its action on target genes by means of activating or repressing forms of GLI3 have been studied most extensively during limb development and the specification of the central nervous system. From these studies it has emerged, that Gli3 expression must be subject to a tight spatiotemporal regulation. However, the genetic mechanisms and the cis-acting elements controlling the expression of Gli3 remained largely unknown. RESULTS: Here, we demonstrate in chicken and mouse transgenic embryos that human GLI3-intronic conserved non-coding sequence elements (CNEs) autonomously control individual aspects of Gli3 expression. Their combined action shows many aspects of a Gli3-specific pattern of transcriptional activity. In the mouse limb bud, different CNEs enhance Gli3-specific expression in evolutionary ancient stylopod and zeugopod versus modern skeletal structures of the autopod. Limb bud specificity is also found in chicken but had not been detected in zebrafish embryos. Three of these elements govern central nervous system specific gene expression during mouse embryogenesis, each targeting a subset of endogenous Gli3 transcription sites. Even though fish, birds, and mammals share an ancient repertoire of gene regulatory elements within Gli3, the functions of individual enhancers from this catalog have diverged significantly. During evolution, ancient broad-range regulatory elements within Gli3 attained higher specificity, critical for patterning of more specialized structures, by abolishing the potential for redundant expression control. CONCLUSION: These results not only demonstrate the high level of complexity in the genetic mechanisms controlling Gli3 expression, but also reveal the evolutionary significance of cis-acting regulatory networks of early developmental regulators in vertebrates.",M2
20424322,"Folate regulation of axonal regeneration in the rodent central nervous system through DNA methylation.The folate pathway plays a crucial role in the regeneration and repair of the adult <e>CNS</e> after injury. Here, we have shown in rodents that such repair occurs at least in part through DNA methylation. In animals with combined spinal cord and sciatic nerve injury, folate-mediated CNS axon regeneration was found to depend on injury-related induction of the high-affinity folate receptor 1 (Folr1). The activity of folate was dependent on its activation by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (Dhfr) and a functional methylation cycle. The effect of folate on the regeneration of afferent spinal neurons was biphasic and dose dependent and correlated closely over its dose range with global and gene-specific DNA methylation and with expression of both the folate receptor Folr1 and the de novo DNA methyltransferases. These data implicate an epigenetic mechanism in CNS repair. Folic acid and possibly other nontoxic dietary methyl donors may therefore be useful in clinical interventions to promote brain and spinal cord healing. If indeed the benefit of folate is mediated by epigenetic mechanisms that promote endogenous axonal regeneration, this provides possible avenues for new pharmacologic approaches to treating CNS injuries.",M2
20418780,"Mechanisms of axonal spheroid formation in central nervous system Wallerian degeneration.Wallerian degeneration of the <e>CNS</e> is accompanied by axonal dystrophy or swelling. To understand the mechanisms by which swellings arise, we studied their spatiotemporal dynamics, ultrastructure, composition, and the conditions that affect their formation in vivo and ex vivo. In contrast to peripheral nerve axons, lesioned optic nerve (ON) axons in vivo developed focal swellings asynchronously within 6 hours, long before there is any axon fragmentation. Axons in ON, spinal cord dorsal column, and corpus callosum all showed marked gradients with more swellings in proximal regions of their distal stumps early after lesion. Time-lapse imaging of a validated ex vivo system showed that multiple focal swellings arise after around 1 hour close to the injury site, followed by anterograde wave-like progression on continuous ON axon stumps. Swellings were largely stable but occasionally seemed to fuse with neighboring swellings. Their ultrastructural appearances resembled disease-associated spheroids. Although accumulation of axonal markers suggested transport deficits, large accumulations of mitochondria were not observed. Early swelling formation was decreased in Wld gene-expressing rodents and by removing extracellular calcium. Several pharmacologic agents that inhibit axon loss in vitro and/or in vivo also prevented early formation of axonal spheroids in acute ON explants. Because axonal swellings are hallmarks of many neurodegenerative conditions, these data suggest that they are a manifestation of Wallerian-like degeneration in some cases. Thus, Wallerian-like degeneration may be a more common component mechanism in CNS diseases than previously thought.",M2
20410111,"Defective cAMP generation underlies the sensitivity of <e>CNS</e> neurons to neurofibromatosis-1 heterozygosity.Individuals with the neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) inherited cancer syndrome exhibit neuronal dysfunction that predominantly affects the CNS. In this report, we demonstrate a unique vulnerability of CNS neurons, but not peripheral nervous system (PNS) neurons, to reduced Nf1 gene expression. Unlike dorsal root ganglion neurons, Nf1 heterozygous (Nf1+/-) hippocampal and retinal ganglion cell (RGC) neurons have decreased growth cone areas and neurite lengths, and increased apoptosis compared to their wild-type counterparts. These abnormal Nf1+/- CNS neuronal phenotypes do not reflect Ras pathway hyperactivation, but rather result from impaired neurofibromin-mediated cAMP generation. In this regard, elevating cAMP levels with forskolin or rolipram treatment, but not MEK (MAP kinase kinase) or PI3-K (phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase) inhibition, reverses these abnormalities to wild-type levels in vitro. In addition, Nf1+/- CNS, but not PNS, neurons exhibit increased apoptosis in response to excitotoxic or oxidative stress in vitro. Since children with NF1-associated optic gliomas often develop visual loss and Nf1 genetically engineered mice with optic glioma exhibit RGC neuronal apoptosis in vivo, we further demonstrate that RGC apoptosis resulting from optic glioma in Nf1 genetically engineered mice is attenuated by rolipram treatment in vivo. Similar to optic glioma-induced RGC apoptosis, the increased RGC neuronal death in Nf1+/- mice after optic nerve crush injury is also attenuated by rolipram treatment in vivo. Together, these findings establish a distinctive role for neurofibromin in CNS neurons with respect to vulnerability to injury, define a CNS-specific neurofibromin intracellular signaling pathway responsible for neuronal survival, and lay the foundation for future neuroprotective glioma treatment approaches.",M2
20405577,"Signaling, delivery and age as emerging issues in the benefit/risk ratio outcome of tPA For treatment of <e>CNS</e> ischemic disorders.Stroke is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality. While tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA) remains the only FDA-approved treatment for ischemic stroke, clinical use of tPA has been constrained to roughly 3% of eligible patients because of the danger of intracranial hemorrhage and a narrow 3 h time window for safe administration. Basic science studies indicate that tPA enhances excitotoxic neuronal cell death. In this review, the beneficial and deleterious effects of tPA in ischemic brain are discussed along with emphasis on development of new approaches toward treatment of patients with acute ischemic stroke. In particular, roles of tPA-induced signaling and a novel delivery system for tPA administration based on tPA coupling to carrier red blood cells will be considered as therapeutic modalities for increasing tPA benefit/risk ratio. The concept of the neurovascular unit will be discussed in the context of dynamic relationships between tPA-induced changes in cerebral hemodynamics and histopathologic outcome of CNS ischemia. Additionally, the role of age will be considered since thrombolytic therapy is being increasingly used in the pediatric population, but there are few basic science studies of CNS injury in pediatric animals.",M2
20404145,"Esophageal cancer-related gene 4 is a secreted inducer of cell senescence expressed by aged <e>CNS</e> precursor cells.Mammalian aging is thought to be partially caused by the diminished capacity of stem/precursor cells to undergo self-renewing divisions. Although many cell-cycle regulators are involved in this process, it is unknown to what extent cell senescence, first identified as irreversible growth arrest in vitro, contributes to the aging process. Here, using a serum-induced mouse oligodendrocyte precursor cell (mOPC) senescence model, we identified esophageal cancer-related gene 4 (Ecrg4) as a senescence inducer with implications for the senescence-like state of postmitotic cells in the aging brain. Although mOPCs could proliferate indefinitely when cultured using the appropriate medium (OPC medium), they became senescent in the presence of serum and maintained their senescent phenotype even when the serum was subsequently replaced by OPC medium. We show that Ecrg4 was up-regulated in the senescent OPCs, its overexpression in OPCs induced senescence by accelerating the proteasome-dependent degradation of cyclins D1 and D3, and that its knockdown by a specific short hairpin RNA prevented these phenotypes. We also show that senescent OPCs secreted Ecrg4 and that recombinant Ecrg4 induced OPC senescence in culture. Moreover, increased Ecrg4 expression was observed in the OPCs and neural precursor cells in the aged mouse brain; this was accompanied by the expression of senescence-associated beta-galactosidase activity, indicating the cells' entrance into senescence. These results suggest that Ecrg4 is a factor linking neural-cell senescence and aging.",M2
20383168,"Expression of a dominant-negative Rho-kinase promotes neurite outgrowth in a microenvironment mimicking injured central nervous system.AIM: To investigate whether lentiviral vector (LV)-mediated expression of a dominant negative mutant Rho-kinase (DNROCK) could inhibit activation of the Rho/ROCK signaling pathway and promote neurite outgrowth in a hostile microenvironment mimicking the injured central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) in vitro. METHODS: Lentiviral stock was produced using the three-plasmid system by transfecting HEK293 cells. Myelin prepared from rat brain was purified by two rounds of discontinuous density gradient centrifugation and osmotic disintegration. Differentiated PC12 cells and dissociated adult rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons were transduced with either LV/DNROCK or LV/green fluorescent protein (GFP) and seeded on solubilized myelin proteins. The effect of DNROCK on growth cone morphology was tested by rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin staining. Expression of DNROCK was determined by immunoblotting. The length of the longest neurite, the percentage of neurite-bearing neurons, or the total process outgrowth for all transduced neurons were measured by using the Scion image analysis program. RESULTS: Transduction of DNROCK inhibited serum-induced stress fiber formation in NIH 3T3 cells and induced enlargement of cell bodies and decreased the phosphorylation levels of MYPT1 in HeLa cells. LV/DNROCK blocked myelin-induced increase in ROCK translocation from cytosol to membrane in LV/GFP-treated PC12 cells. DNROCK promotes neurite outgrowth of differentiated PC12 cells and DRG neurons on myelin protein. LV/DNROCK-transduced PC12 cells had longer neurites than LV/GFP-transduced cells (39.18+/-2.19 microm vs 29.32+/-1.7 microm, P&lt;0.01) on myelin-coated coverslips. Furthermore, a significantly higher percentage of LV/DNROCK-transduced cells had extended neurites than LV/GFP-transduced cells (63.75%+/-8.03% vs 16.3%+/-3.70%, P&lt;0.01). LV/DNROCK-transduced DRG neurons had longer neurite length (325.22+/-10.8 microm vs 202.47+/-9.3 microm, P&lt;0.01) and more primary neurites per cell than those in LV/GFP-transduced cells plated on myelin and laminin (7.8+/-1.25 vs 4.84+/-1.45, P&lt;0.01) or on laminin alone (5.2+/-1.88). LV/DNROCK-transduced cells had significantly larger growth cones (33.12+/-1.06 microm(2)) than LV/GFP-pretreated cells (23.72+/-1.22 microm(2)). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that blocking the RhoA/ROCK signaling pathway by expression of DNROCK is effective in facilitating neurite outgrowth in a microenvironment mimicking injury of central nervous system.",M2
20378049,"Influence of Escherichia coli shiga toxin on the mammalian central nervous system.In severe cases of the infectious disease by Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), patients display renal dysfunction known as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) failure. Among those severe symptoms, patients with CNS dysfunction with HUS have a greater chance of getting severe sequelae and mortality than with HUS alone. Autopsy of the CNS shows mostly edema and hypoxic-ischemic changes, often with microhemorrhages. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of brains of patients confirms hemorrhagic component involvement. This suggests the weakening of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) during the disease. Also, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) analysis shows the weakening of the blood-CSF barrier. Although evidence of vascular involvement in CNS exists, the typical observation of microthrombosis in renal pathology is often absent in CNS. Importantly, there are people who develop CNS symptoms before the onset of HUS. This suggests direct involvement of Shiga toxin (Stx) in CNS disease which is in addition to renal involvement. The advantages of animal models are that Stx receptor expression in normal CNS tissue can be determined, and changes in histopathology, hematology, and serum and CSF contents can be analyzed at several different time points, which allow investigation of the nature of the disease. Importantly, in animal models with either STEC oral inoculation or purified Stx injection, paralysis of extremities is commonly observed. This shows the central role of Stx in CNS dysfunction in this disease. It is anticipated that precise mechanisms of Stx influence in the CNS will be delineated, and this information will lead to effective therapeutics in the near future.",M2
20368281,"Cutting edge: critical role for PYCARD/ASC in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease in which self-reactive T cells attack oligodendrocytes that myelinate axons in the <e>CNS</e>. Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis, is dependent on caspase-1; however, the role of Nod-like receptors upstream of caspase-1 is unknown. Danger- and pathogen-associated molecular patterns activate Nod-like receptor 3, which activates caspase-1 through the adaptor protein, apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing CARD (ASC). We report that the progression of EAE is dependent on ASC and caspase-1 but not Nod-like receptor 3. ASC(-/-) mice were even more protected from the progression of EAE than were caspase-1(-/-) mice, suggesting that an inflammasome-independent function of ASC contributes to the progression of EAE. We found that CD4(+) T cells deficient in ASC exhibited impaired survival; accordingly, ASC(-/-) mice had fewer myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein-specific T cells in the draining lymph nodes and CNS.",M2
20358345,"Hepatic 11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase 1 involvement in alterations of glucose metabolism produced by acidotic stress in rat.11 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (HSDs) enzymes regulate the activity of glucocorticoids in target organs. HSD1, one of the two existing isoforms, locates mainly in <e>CNS</e>, liver and adipose tissue. HSD1 is involved in the pathogenesis of diseases such as obesity, insulin resistance, arterial hypertension and the Metabolic Syndrome. The stress produced by HCl overload triggers metabolic acidosis and increases liver HSD1 activity associated with increased phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, a regulatory enzyme of gluconeogenesis that is activated by glucocorticoids, with increased glycaemia and glycogen breakdown. The aim of this study was to analyze whether the metabolic modifications triggered by HCl stress are due to increased liver HSD1 activity. Glycyrrhetinic acid, a potent HDS inhibitor, was administered subcutaneously (20 mg/ml) to stressed and unstressed four months old maleSprague Dawley rats to investigate changes in liver HSD1, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PECPK) and glycogen phosphorylase activities and plasma glucose levels. It was observed that all these parameters increased in stressed animals, but that treatment with glycyrrhetinic acid significantly reduced their levels. In conclusion, our results demonstrate the involvement of HSD1 in stress induced carbohydrate disturbances and could contribute to the impact of HSD1 inhibitors on carbohydrate metabolism and its relevance in the study of Metabolic Syndrome Disorder and non insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus.",M2
20354147,"In situ fluorescence imaging of myelination.We describe a novel fluorescent dye, 3-(4-aminophenyl)-2H-chromen-2-one (termed case myelin compound or CMC), that can be used for in situ fluorescent imaging of myelin in the vertebrate nervous system. When administered via intravenous injection into the tail vein, CMC selectively stained large bundles of myelinated fibers in both the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) and the peripheral nervous system (PNS). In the CNS, CMC readily entered the brain and selectively localized in myelinated regions such as the corpus callosum and cerebellum. CMC also selectively stained myelinated nerves in the PNS. The staining patterns of CMC in a hypermyelinated mouse model were consistent with immunohistochemical staining. Similar to immunohistochemical staining, CMC selectively bound to myelin sheaths present in the white matter tracts. Unlike CMC, conventional antibody staining for myelin basic protein also stained oligodendrocyte cytoplasm in the striatum as well as granule layers in the cerebellum. In vivo application of CMC was also demonstrated by fluorescence imaging of myelinated nerves in the PNS.",M2
20351248,"Protein folding at the membrane interface, the structure of Nogo-66 requires interactions with a phosphocholine surface.Repair of damage to the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) is inhibited by the presence of myelin proteins that prevent axonal regrowth. Consequently, growth inhibitors and their common receptor have been identified as targets in the treatment of injury to the CNS. Here we describe the structure of the extracellular domain of the neurite outgrowth inhibitor (Nogo) in a membrane-like environment. Isoforms of Nogo are expressed with a common C terminus containing two transmembrane (TM) helices. The ectodomain between the two TM helices, Nogo-66, is active in preventing axonal growth [GrandPre T, Nakamura F, Vartanian T, Strittmatter SM (2000) Nature 403:439-444]. We studied the structure of Nogo-66 alone and in the presence of 1,2-dimyristoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphocholine (DMPC) vesicles and dodecylphosphocholine (DPC) micelles as membrane mimetics. We find that Nogo-66 is largely disordered when free in solution. However, when bound to a phosphocholine surface Nogo-66 adopts a unique, stable fold, even in the absence of TM anchors. Using paramagnetic probes and protein-DPC nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), we define portions of the growth inhibitor likely to be accessible on the cell surface. With these data we predict that residues (28-58) are available to bind the Nogo receptor, which is entirely consistent with functional assays. Moreover, the conformations and relative positions of side chains recognized by the receptor are now defined and provide a foundation for antagonist design.",M2

Reparative changes in neurons and synapses after total sleep deprivation lasting 12-24 h were accompanied by increases in all types of behavioral reactions.

20332793,"Protective autoimmunity functions by intracranial immunosurveillance to support the mind: The missing link between health and disease.Circulating immune cells support hippocampal neurogenesis, spatial memory, expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor, and resilience to stress. Nevertheless, considering the immune privileged status of the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>), such cells were assumed to be excluded from the healthy brain. It is evident, however, that the CNS is continuously surveyed by leukocytes, though their function is still a mystery. Coupling this routine leukocyte trafficking with the function attributed to circulating T cells in brain plasticity led us to propose here that CNS immunosurveillance is an integral part of the functioning brain. Anatomical restriction of selected self-recognizing leukocytes to the brain's borders and fluids (cerebrospinal fluid) not only supports the brain's activity, but also controls the potential aggressiveness of such cells. Accordingly, the brain's 'privilege' is its acquisition of a private peripheral immunological niche under its own control, which supports brain function. Immune malfunction may comprise a missing link between a healthy and diseased mind.",M2
20308537,"MIPs are ancestral ligands for the sex peptide receptor.Upon mating, females of many animal species undergo dramatic changes in their behavior. In Drosophila melanogaster, postmating behaviors are triggered by sex peptide (SP), which is produced in the male seminal fluid and transferred to female during copulation. SP modulates female behaviors via sex peptide receptor (SPR) located in a small subset of internal sensory neurons that innervate the female uterus and project to the <e>CNS</e>. Although required for postmating responses only in these female sensory neurons, SPR is expressed broadly in the CNS of both sexes. Moreover, SPR is also encoded in the genomes of insects that lack obvious SP orthologs. These observations suggest that SPR may have additional ligands and functions. Here, we identify myoinhibitory peptides (MIPs) as a second family of SPR ligands that is conserved across a wide range of invertebrate species. MIPs are potent agonists for Drosophila, Aedes, and Aplysia SPRs in vitro, yet are unable to trigger postmating responses in vivo. In contrast to SP, MIPs are not produced in male reproductive organs, and are not required for postmating behaviors in Drosophila females. We conclude that MIPs are evolutionarily conserved ligands for SPR, which are likely to mediate functions other than the regulation of female reproductive behaviors.",M2
20236042,"The development of cannabinoid CBII receptor agonists for the treatment of central neuropathies.Two cannabinoids receptors have been characterised in mammals; cannabinoid receptor type 1 (CBI) which is ubiquitous in the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>), and cannabinoid receptor type 2 (CBII) that is expressed mainly in immune cells. Cannabinoids have been used in the treatment of nausea and emesis, anorexia and cachexia, tremor and pain associated with multiple sclerosis. These treatments are limited by the psychoactive side-effects of CBI activation. Recently CBII has been described within the CNS, both in microglia and neuronal progenitor cells (NPCs), but with few exceptions, not by neurons within the CNS. This has suggested that CBII agonists could have potential to treat various conditions without psycho-activity. This article reviews the potential for CBII agonists as treatments for neurological conditions, with a focus on microglia and NPCs as drug targets. We first discuss the role of microglia in the healthy brain, and then the role of microglia in chronic neuroinflammatory disorders, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, as well as in neuroinflammation following acute brain injury such as stroke and global hypoxia. As activation of CBII receptor on microglia results in suppression of the proliferation and activation of microglia, there is potential for the anti-inflammatory properties of CBII agonist to treat neuropathologies that involve heightened microglia activity. In addition, activating CBII receptors may result in an increase in proliferation and affect migration of NPCs. Therefore, it is possible that CBII agonists may assist in the treatment of neuropathologies by increasing neurogenesis. In the second part of the article, we review the state of development of CBII selective drugs with an emphasis on critical aspects of CBII agonist structural activity relationship (SAR).",M2
20231929,"Central nervous system anomalies diagnosed antenatally and post-delivery management.OBJECTIVE: To find out the prevalence of the central nervous system anomalies (<e>CNS</e>) and the outcome after surgical correction of operable defects.

RESULTS: Ninety CNS anomalies were diagnosed antenatally, and 86 were confirmed postnatally. Forty-one (47.7%) were neural tube defects (NTDs) (24 were spina bifida associated with hydrocephalus, 3 encephalocele, 14 anencephaly), 36 (41.9%) were hydrocephalus, 4 (4.65%) holoprosencephaly, 3 (3.4%) microcephaly, and 2 (2.32%) with brain cysts. Of the 41 cases that were operated, 6 (14.6%) died, 26 (63.4%) survived with severe neurological sequelae, 6 (14.6%) lost follow-up, and 3 (7.3%) did well for the period of follow-up. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of CNS anomalies is comparable to worldwide prevalence. The NTDs are important component of these anomalies, and implementation of strategies to decrease the rate of these anomalies would be beneficial to prevent them as they carry a high rate of handicap and suffering, even after surgical correction.",M2
20231694,"IL-17RC is required for IL-17A- and IL-17F-dependent signaling and the pathogenesis of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.It has been suggested that IL-17RC forms a complex with IL-17RA to mediate the functions of IL-17A and IL-17F homodimers as well as IL-17A/F heterodimers. It is still unclear whether IL-17RC is absolutely required for the signaling of IL-17 cytokines in vivo. By using Il-17rc-deficient mice, we show that IL-17RC is essential for the signaling of IL-17A, IL-17F, and IL-17A/F both in vitro and in vivo. IL-17RC does not preassociate with IL-17RA on the cell surface; rather IL-17A can induce the formation of an IL-17RC and IL-17RA complex. This process is not dependent on the intracellular similar expression to fibroblast growth factor genes and IL-17Rs (SEFIR) domain of IL-17RC, but the SEFIR is essential in IL-17A signal transduction. Finally, Il-17rc(-/-) mice develop much milder disease in an experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis model, supporting an essential role for IL-17RC in mediating immune-mediated <e>CNS</e> inflammation.",M2
20227773,"Differential expression of aquaporin-4 isoforms localizes with neuromyelitis optica disease activity.Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is a devastating neuroinflammatory disorder that specifically targets the spinal cord and optic nerves. Aquaporin-4 (AQP4) is the target of the NMO-IgG biomarker. AQP4 is expressed as two isoforms: M1 and M23, which have different functions in the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>). We characterized the expression pattern of these AQP4 isoform mRNAs in humans and found a pattern of AQP4 expression that correlates with NMO disease localization. The ratio of M1:M23 mRNA is highest in the optic nerve and spinal cord, followed by brainstem, then the cerebral and cerebellar cortices.",M2
20227314,"Current concepts in the pathogenesis of urea cycle disorders.The common feature of urea cycle diseases (UCD) is a defect in ammonium elimination in liver, leading to hyperammonemia. This excess of circulating ammonium eventually reaches the central nervous system, where the main toxic effects of ammonium occur. These are reversible or irreversible, depending on the age of onset as well as the duration and the level of ammonium exposure. The brain is much more susceptible to the deleterious effects of ammonium during development than in adulthood, and surviving UCD patients may develop cortical and basal ganglia hypodensities, cortical atrophy, white matter atrophy or hypomyelination and ventricular dilatation. While for a long time, the mechanisms leading to these irreversible effects of ammonium exposure on the brain remained poorly understood, these last few years have brought new data showing in particular that ammonium exposure alters several amino acid pathways and neurotransmitter systems, cerebral energy, nitric oxide synthesis, axonal and dendritic growth, signal transduction pathways, as well as K(+) and water channels. All these effects of ammonium on <e>CNS</e> may eventually lead to energy deficit, oxidative stress and cell death. Recent work also proposed neuroprotective strategies, such as the use of NMDA receptor antagonists, nitric oxide inhibitors, creatine and acetyl-l-carnitine, to counteract the toxic effects of ammonium. Better understanding the pathophysiology of ammonium toxicity to the brain under UCD will allow the development of new strategies for neuroprotection.",M2
20223197,"Dicer1 and miR-219 Are required for normal oligodendrocyte differentiation and myelination.To investigate the role of microRNAs in regulating oligodendrocyte (OL) differentiation and myelination, we utilized transgenic mice in which microRNA processing was disrupted in OL precursor cells (OPCs) and OLs by targeted deletion of Dicer1. We found that inhibition of OPC-OL miRNA processing disrupts normal <e>CNS</e> myelination and that OPCs lacking mature miRNAs fail to differentiate normally in vitro. We identified three miRNAs (miR-219, miR-138, and miR-338) that are induced 10-100x during OL differentiation; the most strongly induced of these, miR-219, is necessary and sufficient to promote OL differentiation, and partially rescues OL differentiation defects caused by total miRNA loss. miR-219 directly represses the expression of PDGFRalpha, Sox6, FoxJ3, and ZFP238 proteins, all of which normally help to promote OPC proliferation. Together, these findings show that miR-219 plays a critical role in coupling differentiation to proliferation arrest in the OL lineage, enabling the rapid transition from proliferating OPCs to myelinating OLs.",M2
20221252,"Limited trafficking of a neurotropic virus through inefficient retrograde axonal transport and the type I interferon response.Poliovirus is an enteric virus that rarely invades the human central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>). To identify barriers limiting poliovirus spread from the periphery to CNS, we monitored trafficking of 10 marked viruses. After oral inoculation of susceptible mice, poliovirus was present in peripheral neurons, including vagus and sciatic nerves. To model viral trafficking in peripheral neurons, we intramuscularly injected mice with poliovirus, which follows a muscle-sciatic nerve-spinal cord-brain route. Only 20% of the poliovirus population successfully moved from muscle to brain, and three barriers limiting viral trafficking were identified. First, using light-sensitive viruses, we found limited viral replication in peripheral neurons. Second, retrograde axonal transport of poliovirus in peripheral neurons was inefficient; however, the efficiency was increased upon muscle damage, which also increased the transport efficiency of a non-viral neural tracer, wheat germ agglutinin. Third, using susceptible interferon (IFN) alpha/beta receptor knockout mice, we demonstrated that the IFN response limited viral movement from the periphery to the brain. Surprisingly, the retrograde axonal transport barrier was equivalent in strength to the IFN barrier. Illustrating the importance of barriers created by the IFN response and inefficient axonal transport, IFN alpha/beta receptor knockout mice with muscle damage permitted 80% of the viral population to access the brain, and succumbed to disease three times faster than mice with intact barriers. These results suggest that multiple separate barriers limit poliovirus trafficking from peripheral neurons to the CNS, possibly explaining the rare incidence of paralytic poliomyelitis. This study identifies inefficient axonal transport as a substantial barrier to poliovirus trafficking in peripheral neurons, which may limit CNS access for other viruses.",M2
20217565,"Direct application of siRNA for in vivo pain research.Pain is the new burden of the twenty-first century, raising enormous socio-economic costs to developed and underdeveloped countries. Chronic pain is a central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) pathology, affecting a large proportion of the population. Morphine and its derivatives are still the golden clinical standards for treating pain although they induce severe side effects. To this day, we still have poor understanding of nociceptive pain and its underlying complex mechanisms; furthermore, novelty in clinical analgesics is lacking.RNA interference technologies are promising both for pain research and treatment. This genetic approach will likely provide new insights into pain mechanisms and eventually offer nonpharmacological therapeutic approaches. In vivo research is thus crucial to reach this goal. Preclinical studies on rodents are necessary to validate small interfering RNA (siRNA) candidates and to target precise physiological pain modulators. Aiming treatment at the CNS is delicate work, and here we will describe how to perform adequate pain research using siRNA, including siRNA preparation and injection, animal behavioral models, and CNS tissue collection.",M2
20217359,"Rapid increase to double breathing rate appears during REM sleep in synchrony with REM - a higher <e>CNS</e> control of breathing? -.Breathing rate (BR) during rapid eye movement (REM) sleep is known to fluctuate largely, while increases in BR during REM sleep reported were small. In our mice experiments, we found that mice exhibit a rapid increase in instantaneous BR (RIBR) of &gt;2 fold during natural sleep with accompanying atonia, laying their sides down. The RIBR was further found in a sleeping mouse attached with EEG electrodes when the EEG amplitude and delta wave power were lower. Therefore, it is likely that mice show RIBRs during REM sleep. Interestingly, similar RIBRs accompanied by atonia and REM burst during REM sleep were also found in humans by standard polysomnographic studies in 11 healthy volunteers (age: 22.3 +/- 2.8) with BR measurement by nasal/oral airflow sensors and chest/abdomen belt sensors. All subjects underwent RIBR of doubled BR at least once a night. As SpO(2) before RIBRs was a level not effective to be a respiratory stimulant (96.7 +/- 1.6 %, n = 63), the RIBR seems to be controlled by higher central nervous system rather than autonomic nervous system control on response to central and peripheral chemical sensors. In fact, tachypnea with suppressed amplitude during RIBR resulted in a slight fall in SpO(2) (96.4 +/- 1.7 %, p = 0.0007). In the present study, RIBRs accompanied by atonia and REM were not necessarily consistent in change in rate and/or amplitude, therefore, these various pattern of RIBRs may be potential indices of dreams with various emotional contents. Analysis of instantaneous BR, thus, may be a helpful tool for understanding the neural control of breathing during REM sleep.",M2
20209620,"Central nervous system prophylaxis in adults with acute lymphoblastic leukemia: current and emerging therapies.Central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) recurrence continues to be a significant complication in the treatment of adult patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Preventing CNS recurrence has been a therapeutic challenge and has not been addressed critically in many clinical trials. Adult studies modeled on childhood ALL studies have used multiple treatment modalities, including radiation therapy, systemic therapy, intrathecal therapy, and combinations thereof. Cranial irradiation is effective but is offset by substantial toxicity, including neurologic sequelae. Systemic chemotherapy, especially with cytarabine (AraC) and methotrexate, has demonstrated promise in decreasing CNS recurrence, but therapeutic levels of drugs in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are not maintained. Intrathecal chemotherapy with or without high-dose systemic therapy is the most common approach to CNS prophylaxis. Liposomal AraC recently has become available and confers prolonged levels of free AraC in the CSF, a critical requirement for CNS prophylactic therapy. This review discusses the various modalities used for CNS prophylaxis in patients with ALL and the emerging trends, with specific emphasis on the outcome in terms of event-free survival and toxicity.",M2
20209433,"Retinoid signalling is required for information transfer from mesoderm to neuroectoderm during gastrulation.The hindbrain region of the vertebrate central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) presents a complex regionalisation. It consists of 7-8 distinct morphological segments called rhombomeres, each with a unique identity provided by combinations of transcription factors. One class of signalling molecules, retinoids, have been shown to be crucial for hindbrain patterning through direct trans-activation of Hox genes in the neuroectoderm. However, how this morphogen acts is not yet fully understood. Here, we show that the retinoid receptor antagonist AGN193109 causes a posterior hindbrain defect in Xenopus, comparable to that seen in other vertebrates. We show that this defect arises during gastrulation. Blocking endogenous retinoid activity during gastrulation causes downregulation of the most 3' Hox genes (paralogues 1-5) in gastrula neuroectoderm, but their initial activation in gastrula non-organiser mesoderm is unaffected. Similar results were obtained in avian embryos: Vitamin A-deficient quail embryos have defective expression of 3 Hox genes (i.e. Hoxb1, Hoxb4 ) in the neural tube, but their early expression in the primitive streak and emerging paraxial and lateral mesoderm is not affected. In Xenopus, depletion of retinoids from mesoderm by targeted injection of mRNAs for the retinoic acid catabolising enzyme xCYP26 and the cellular retinoic acid binding protein xCRABP blocks 3 Hox gene expression in the overlying neuroectoderm. We propose that the gastrula non-organiser mesoderm and its later derivative, the paraxial mesoderm, is the source of a retinoid, which acts as a transforming (caudalising) signal for the future posterior hindbrain.",M2
20199790,"Redundancy in the immune system restricts the spread of HSV-1 in the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) of C57BL/6 mice.Resistance to lethal encephalitis in mice infected with HSV-1 via the oral mucosa is mouse strain dependent. In susceptible BALB/c, HSV-1 spreads throughout the CNS but in resistant BL/6 mice, virus is restricted to the brainstem. To examine the contribution of cellular immunity in restricting viral spread, we used a combination of antibody depleted and KO mice. Individually, NK/NKT, iNKT, CD4(+), CD8(+), and gammadelta T-cells do not restrict HSV-1 spread. In contrast, virus spreads throughout the CNS of BL/6 CL I KO mice and BL/6 mice treated with either anti-asialoGM1 Ab or both anti-CD8 and anti-NK1.1 mAbs. The results highlight the importance of redundancy in the immune system in restricting viral spread in the CNS, argue for a role of NK/NKT and CD8(+) T-cells in mediating the restriction, and provide a hierarchical order of the individual elements in controlling virus in BL/6 mice infected with HSV-1 via the oral mucosa.",M2

To identify local cells undergoing mitosis in response to such lesions, we examined the time course of phospho-histone H3 (PH3) and myelin basic protein (MBP) expression by immunohistochemistry. After lysolecithin injection into the corpus callosum of virgin female mice, the number of dividing cells peaked about 48 h after injection and declined gradually to baseline by day 7; in pregnant mice, this initial peak was unchanged, but a new delayed peak on day 4 was induced. Colocalization data using PH3 and NG2 proteoglycan, or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and oligodendrocyte transcription factor 1 (Olig1), suggested that about 75% of the proliferating cells on day 2, and about 40% of the cells on day 4, were likely of oligodendrocyte lineage; these differential percentages were of the same magnitude in both virgin and pregnant animals. Notably, the heightened proliferative response to focal lysolecithin injection during pregnancy was specific to gestational stage (early, but not late) and to lesion location (in the corpus callosum of the periventricular forebrain, but not in the caudal cerebellar peduncle of the hindbrain).",M2
20188706,"Anti-aquaporin-4 antibody induces astrocytic cytotoxicity in the absence of <e>CNS</e> antigen-specific T cells.Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an inflammatory demyelinating disease of the central nervous system (CNS). Anti-aquaporin-4 antibody (AQP4-Ab) is a highly specific serum autoantibody that is detected in patients with NMO. Several lines of evidence indicate that AQP4-Ab not only serves as a disease marker but also plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of NMO. Although the pathogenicity of AQP4-Ab in vivo has recently been demonstrated, the presence of CNS antigen-specific T cells is recognized as a prerequisite for the antibody to exert pathogenic effects. Thus, it remains unclear whether AQP4-Ab is the primary cause of the disease or a disease-modifying factor in NMO. Here we report that pre-treatment with complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) alone is sufficient for AQP4-Ab to induce astrocytic damage in vivo. Our results show the primary pathogenic role of AQP4-Ab in the absence of CNS antigen-specific T cells, and suggest that danger signals provided by nonspecific inflammation can be a trigger for those who harbor the autoantibody to develop NMO.",M2
20181608,"Bral1: its role in diffusion barrier formation and conduction velocity in the <e>CNS</e>.At the nodes of Ranvier, excitable axon membranes are exposed directly to the extracellular fluid. Cations are accumulated and depleted in the local extracellular nodal region during action potential propagation, but the impact of the extranodal micromilieu on signal propagation still remains unclear. Brain-specific hyaluronan-binding link protein, Bral1, colocalizes and forms complexes with negatively charged extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, such as versican V2 and brevican, at the nodes of Ranvier in the myelinated white matter. The link protein family, including Bral1, appears to be the linchpin of these hyaluronan-bound ECM complexes. Here we report that the hyaluronan-associated ECM no longer shows a nodal pattern and that CNS nerve conduction is markedly decreased in Bral1-deficient mice even though there were no differences between wild-type and mutant mice in the clustering or transition of ion channels at the nodes or in the tissue morphology around the nodes of Ranvier. However, changes in the extracellular space diffusion parameters, measured by the real-time iontophoretic method and diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), suggest a reduction in the diffusion hindrances in the white matter of mutant mice. These findings provide a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the accumulation of cations due to diffusion barriers around the nodes during saltatory conduction, which further implies the importance of the Bral1-based extramilieu for neuronal conductivity.",M2

Cells obtained using this technology, which allows the ethical issues and immunological rejection associated with embryonic stem (ES) cells to be avoided, might be a clinically useful source for cell replacement therapics. Here we demonstrate that murine iPS cells formed neurospheres that produced electrophysiologically functional neurons, astrocytes, and oligodendrocytes. Secondary neurospheres (SNSs) generated from various mouse iPS cell showed their neural differentiation capacity and teratoma formation after transplantation into the brain of immunodeficient NOD/SCID mice. We found that origin (source of somatic cells) of the iPS cells are the crucial determinant for the potential tumorigenicity of iPS-derived neural stem/progenitor cclls and that their tumorigenicity results from the persistent presence of undifferentiated cells within the SNSs. Furthermore, transplantation of non-tumorigenic Nanog-iPS-derived SNSs into mouse spinal cord injury (SCI) model promoted locomotor function recovery. Surprisingly, SNSs derived from c-Myc minus iPS cells generated without drug selection showed robust tumorigenesis, in spite of their potential to contribute adult chimeric mice without tumor formation.",M2
20171210,"Long-term culture and differentiation of <e>CNS</e> precursors derived from anterior human neural rosettes following exposure to ventralizing factors.In this study we demonstrated that neural rosettes derived from human ES cells can give rise either to neural crest precursors, following expansion in presence of bFGF and EGF, or to dopaminergic precursors after exposure to ventralizing factors Shh and FGF8. Both regionalised precursors are capable of extensive proliferation and differentiation towards the corresponding terminally differentiated cell types. In particular, peripheral neurons, cartilage, bone, smooth muscle cells and also pigmented cells were obtained from neural crest precursors while tyrosine hydroxylase and Nurr1 positive dopaminergic neurons were derived from FGF8 and Shh primed rosette cells. Gene expression and immunocytochemistry analyses confirmed the expression of dorsal and neural crest genes such as Sox10, Slug, p75, FoxD3, Pax7 in neural precursors from bFGF-EGF exposed rosettes. By contrast, priming of rosettes with FGF8 and Shh induced the expression of dopaminergic markers Engrailed1, Pax2, Pitx3, floor plate marker FoxA2 and radial glia markers Blbp and Glast, the latter in agreement with the origin of dopaminergic precursors from floor plate radial glia. Moreover, in vivo transplant of proliferating Shh/FGF8 primed precursors in parkinsonian rats demonstrated engraftment and terminal dopaminergic differentiation. In conclusion, we demonstrated the derivation of long-term self-renewing precursors of selected regional identity as potential cell reservoirs for cell therapy applications, such as CNS degenerative diseases, or for the development of toxicological tests.",M2

Using a flow cytometric technique, we examined phenotypic characteristics of CNS T-cells following disease initiation and the role of T-cell activation in CNS invasion and retention. Host T-cell activation increased cell recruitment and EAE severity. CNS antigen specific T-cells were required to induce T-cell retention within the CNS. Once retention was initiated, CNS T-cells were retained regardless of specificity. This study characterizes mechanisms involved in CNS accumulation of T-cells during EAE pathogenesis.",M2

Previous research has shown that chronic restraint stress (RS) during early TMEV infection exacerbates behavioral signs of the disease. The present data suggest that RS-induced increases in CNS inflammation, demyelination, and axonal degeneration may underlie this exacerbation. In addition, we report that males exhibit greater CNS inflammation and higher numbers of demyelinating lesions while females show greater susceptibility to RS-induced exacerbation. These findings indicate that RS during early TMEV infection increases CNS lesion formation during the late phase and suggest that the effects of RS are sex-dependent.",M2
20164039,"Assessment of ghrelin, GHS-R, GH, and neurohormones in human fetal pituitary glands and central nervous system: an immunohistochemical study.The aim of this work was evaluation of expression of ghrelin and GHS-R1a receptor in somatotrops and in neuronal cells of brain tissue in the process of human fetal ontogenesis. Relations were also looked for between GHRH and SS in the pituitary and in the <e>CNS</e> neurones of the studied fetuses. The study was based on 8 pituitaries and 8 brains from fetuses in different periods of intrauterine life. The immunocytochemical technique was used. The presence of ghrelin, GHS-R was shown in the glandular part of the pituitary and CNS during the whole period of intrauterine life. Neurohormones in the stalk of the pituitary were found in fetuses from the 32nd week of pregnancy whereas in the CNS neurones these hormones could be detected throughout the whole period of intrauterine life. The results obtained suggest that stimulation of GH secretion by ghrelin is independent of the feedback concentration and these two hormones act like signals of metabolic balance. GH release by ghrelin in fetal life is independent of somatostatin. The hypothalamic-pituitary axis which regulates pulsatile GH release from the pituitary matures functionally in the third trimester of pregnancy independent of the previous anatomical differentiation.",M2
20155818,"Genetic ablation of steroid receptor coactivator-3 promotes PPAR-beta-mediated alternative activation of microglia in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.Steroid receptor coactivator-3 (SRC-3) has been demonstrated to regulate lipid metabolism by inhibiting adipocyte differentiation. In this study, the potential role of SRC-3 in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), which characterized by inflammatory demyelination in central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>), was examined by analyzing disease progression in SRC-3-deficient (SRC-3(-/-)) mice. We found that SRC-3 deficiency significantly attenuated the disease severity of EAE along with decreased inflammatory infiltration and demyelination. However, these effects are not caused by inhibition of peripheral T cell response, but by upregulated expression of peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR)-beta in CNS, which induced an alternative activation state of microglia in SRC-3(-/-) mice. These alternatively activated microglia inhibited CNS inflammation through inhibition of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines, such as TNF-alpha, IFN-gamma, CCL2, CCL3, CCL5, and CXCL10, as well as upregulation of anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10 and opsonins, such as C1qa and C1qb. Moreover, microglia alternative activation promoted myelin regeneration through increased accumulation of oligodendrocyte precursors in white matter and elevated expression of myelin genes in the spinal cords of SRC-3(-/-) mice. Our results build up a link between lipid metabolic regulation and immune functions, and the modulation of the expression of SRC-3 or PPAR-beta may hopefully has therapeutic modality in MS and possibly other neurodegenerative diseases.",M2

This syndrome often occurs in the context of an underlying opportunistic infection and develops after an interval of weeks to months after the initiation of HAART. Occasionally, IRIS may occur in the brain without any opportunistic infection, which presents as a T cell-mediated encephalitis.

20144763,"Distinct protein domains and expression patterns confer divergent axon guidance functions for Drosophila Robo receptors.The orthogonal array of axon pathways in the Drosophila <e>CNS</e> is constructed in part under the control of three Robo family axon guidance receptors: Robo1, Robo2 and Robo3. Each of these receptors is responsible for a distinct set of guidance decisions. To determine the molecular basis for these functional specializations, we used homologous recombination to create a series of 9  robo swap  alleles: expressing each of the three Robo receptors from each of the three robo loci. We demonstrate that the lateral positioning of longitudinal axon pathways relies primarily on differences in gene regulation, not distinct combinations of Robo proteins as previously thought. In contrast, specific features of the Robo1 and Robo2 proteins contribute to their distinct functions in commissure formation. These specializations allow Robo1 to prevent crossing and Robo2 to promote crossing. These data demonstrate how diversification of expression and structure within a single family of guidance receptors can shape complex patterns of neuronal wiring.",M2

In this review, we highlight molecular mechanisms controlling OPC differentiation during development and the implication of these mechanisms on adult OPCs for remyelination.

Adaptive-transfer experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis is a major experimental tool for investigation ofT cell function in multiple sclerosis development. Activated myelin basic protein specific T cells are able to invade and inflame the central nervous system which is followed by axonal injury and paralysis on the third day after injection. In the prodromal phase of EAE encephalitic T cells migrate through different organs which alter their phenotype before invading the <e>CNS</e>. We compared migratory patterns of encephalitic T cells after intravenous and intraperitoneal injection to elucidate which organs may play an important role in the formation of  migratory  phenotype.

20133787,"Analysis of the cellular mechanism underlying inhibition of EAE after treatment with anti-NKG2A F(ab')2.Autoimmune encephalomyelitis may be ameliorated experimentally by enhancing NK cell-mediated elimination of activated autoreactive T cells through a mutation that interrupts the interaction between Qa-1(b) and CD94/NKG2A. Here we evaluate the ability of an anti-NKG2A F(ab')(2) Ab to enhance elimination of autoreactive T cells and reduce experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Anti-NKG2A F(ab')(2) treatment diminishes progression of both myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG)-induced EAE in intact C57BL/6 mice and after adoptive transfer of disease-causing T cells. Analyses of the underlying mechanism revealed that administration of anti-NKG2A F(ab')(2) Ab reduces CD4(+) T recall responses to MOG and skews the proportion of IL-17- and IFNgamma-producing CD4(+) T cells toward the protective IL-4- and IL-10-secreting CD4(+) T cell subpopulations. CD94/NKG2A-dependent inhibition of inflammatory damage to spinal cord is associated with decreased infiltration of T cells and reduced microglia activation in the central nervous system. Because anti-NKG2A F(ab')(2) treatment had no detectable effect on the numbers or activity of T and B lymphocytes and NK cells in peripheral lymphoid tissues, this anti-NKG2A-based approach may represent a safe and effective therapy for this <e>CNS</e> disorder.",M2

Recovery from these injuries is variable and involves in part an orchestrated angiogenesis and neurogenesis in the neurogenic zones (neurovascular niches) of the CNS. In this focused review the roles of HIF-1alpha mediated responses to hypoxia in CNS neurovascular niches is discussed. Using in vivo and in vitro murine models of sublethal hypoxia we mimicked the variable responses observed in the human population and correlated differences in baseline and hypoxia-induced induction of HIF-1alpha and several downstream signaling components including BDNF, VEGF, SDF-1, TrkB, Nrp-1, CXCR4 and NO with differences in survival as well as endothelial cell and neural stem cell survival and proliferation, providing insight into this important and timely problem and suggesting that optimization of expression levels of some or all of these signaling components may have the potential of maximizing recovery following CNS injury.",M2
20103844,"Intrinsic regenerative mechanisms of central nervous system neurons.Injuries to the adult central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>), such as spinal cord injury and brain contusion, can cause permanent functional deficits if axonal connections are broken. Spontaneous functional recovery rarely occurs. It has been widely accepted that the extracellular environment of the CNS inhibits neuronal regeneration. However, it should be noted that another reason for injured neurons failing to regenerate is their weak intrinsic ability to do so. The regeneration of injured neurons is a process involving many intracellular phenomena, including cytoskeletal changes, gene and protein expression, and changes in the responsiveness to extracellular cues. The capacity of injured neurons to regenerate is modulated to some extent by changes in the expression of intracellular signaling molecules such as glycogen synthase kinase-3beta and cyclic adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate. Knowledge of these effects has guided the development of animal models for regenerative therapies of CNS injury. Enhancing the intrinsic regenerative machinery of injured axons in the adult CNS is a potentially powerful strategy for treating patients with a CNS injury.",M2
20097271,"Pigmented creatine deposits in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis central nervous system tissues identified by synchrotron Fourier Transform Infrared microspectroscopy and X-ray fluorescence spectromicroscopy.Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is an untreatable, neurodegenerative disease of motor neurons characterized by progressive muscle atrophy, limb paralysis, dysarthria, dysphagia, dyspnae and finally death. Large motor neurons in ventral horns of spinal cord and motor nuclei in brainstem, large pyramidal neurons of motor cortex and/or large myelinated axons of corticospinal tracts are affected. In recent synchrotron Fourier Transform Infrared microspectroscopy (sFTIR) studies of ALS <e>CNS</e> autopsy tissue, we discovered a small deposit of crystalline creatine, which has a crucial role in energy metabolism. We have now examined unfixed, snap frozen, post-autopsy tissue sections of motor cortex, brain stem, spinal cord, hippocampus and substantia nigra from six ALS and three non-degenerated cases with FTIR and micro-X-ray fluorescence (XRF). Heterogeneous pigmented deposits were discovered in spinal cord, brain stem and motor neuron cortex of two ALS cases. The FTIR signature of creatine has been identified in these deposits and in numerous large, non-pigmented deposits in four of the ALS cases. Comparable pigmentation and creatine deposits were not found in controls or in ALS hippocampus and substantia nigra. Ca, K, Fe, Cu and Zn, as determined by XRF, were not correlated with the pigmented deposits; however, there was a higher incidence of hot spots (Ca, Zn, Fe and Cu) in the ALS cases. The identity of the pigmented deposits remains unknown, although the absence of Fe argues against both erythrocytes and neuromelanin. We conclude that elevated creatine deposits may be indicators of dysfunctional oxidative processes in some ALS cases.",M2
20096362,"Norepinephrine does not alter NPY and POMC mRNA expression in neonatal chicks.Norepinephrine (NE), synthesized in both the central and peripheral nervous system, is involved in food intake regulation of both mammals and chickens. Neuropeptide Y (NPY), a potent orexigenic peptide, is colocalized with NE neurons in the central and peripheral nervous system, suggesting an interaction. Proopiomelanocortin (POMC) is the precursor of alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone, a potent anorexigenic peptide synthesized in the hypothalamus. In this study, two experiments were conducted to examine the effect of intracerebroventricular (ICV) injection of NE on appetite mediators in neonatal chicks (Gallus gallus). Experiment 1 was done to confirm the effect of centrally administered NE (0, 25, 50, and 100 microg) on food intake following a 3h fast, and to determine the change in NPY mRNA expression in the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>). In Experiment 2, chicks fed ad libitum were treated ICV with NE (50 microg) to determine if changes occurred in brain NPY and POMC mRNA levels. In Experiment 1, the ICV injection of NE dose-dependently reduced food intake, but there was no change in NPY mRNA expression in the CNS. In Experiment 2, there was no significant change in NPY and POMC mRNA expression between the control and NE-treated group, indicating that ICV injection of NE may not be associated with changes in NPY or POMC gene expression.",M2
20096132,"Diagnostic reliability of magnetic resonance imaging for central nervous system syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus: a prospective cohort study.BACKGROUND: Previous studies of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) as a diagnostic tool for central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) syndromes in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) contained several limitations such as study design, number of enrolled patients, and definition of CNS syndromes. We overcame these problems and statistically evaluated the diagnostic values of abnormal MRI signals and their chronological changes in CNS syndromes of SLE. METHODS: We prospectively studied 191 patients with SLE, comparing those with (n = 57) and without (n = 134) CNS syndrome. CNS syndromes were characterized using the American College of Rheumatology case definitions. RESULTS: Any abnormal MRI signals were more frequently observed in subjects in the CNS group (n = 25) than in the non-CNS group (n = 32) [relative risk (RR), 1.7; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.1-2.7; p = 0.016] and the positive and negative predictive values for the diagnosis of CNS syndrome were 42% and 76%, respectively. Large abnormal MRI signals (ø &gt;or= 10 mm) were seen only in the CNS group (n = 7; RR, 3.7; CI, 2.9-4.7; p = 0.0002), whereas small abnormal MRI signals (ø &lt; 10 mm) were seen in both groups with no statistical difference. Large signals always paralleled clinical outcome (p = 0.029), whereas small signals did not (p = 1.000). CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal MRI signals, which showed statistical associations with CNS syndrome, had insufficient diagnostic values. A large MRI signal was, however, useful as a diagnostic and surrogate marker for CNS syndrome of SLE, although it was less common.",M2
20095947,"A limited innate immune response is induced by a replication-defective herpes simplex virus vector following delivery to the murine central nervous system.Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1)-based vectors readily transduce neurons and have a large payload capacity, making them particularly amenable to gene therapy applications within the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>). Because aspects of the host responses to HSV-1 vectors in the CNS are largely unknown, we compared the host response of a nonreplicating HSV-1 vector to that of a replication-competent HSV-1 virus using microarray analysis. In parallel, HSV-1 gene expression was tracked using HSV-specific oligonucleotide-based arrays in order to correlate viral gene expression with observed changes in host response. Microarray analysis was performed following stereotactic injection into the right hippocampal formation of mice with either a replication-competent HSV-1 or a nonreplicating recombinant of HSV-1, lacking the ICP4 gene (ICP4-). Genes that demonstrated a significant change (P &lt; .001) in expression in response to the replicating HSV-1 outnumbered those that changed in response to mock or nonreplicating vector by approximately 3-fold. Pathway analysis revealed that both the replicating and nonreplicating vectors induced robust antigen presentation but only mild interferon, chemokine, and cytokine signaling responses. The ICP4- vector was restricted in several of the Toll-like receptor-signaling pathways, indicating reduced stimulation of the innate immune response. These array analyses suggest that although the nonreplicating vector induces detectable activation of immune response pathways, the number and magnitude of the induced response is dramatically restricted compared to the replicating vector, and with the exception of antigen presentation, host gene expression induced by the nonreplicating vector largely resembles mock infection.",M2
20091776,"Dissimilar and similar functional properties of complement receptor-3 in microglia and macrophages in combating yeast pathogens by phagocytosis.Central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) microglia (MG) and peripheral tissue macrophages (MO) remove pathogens by phagocytosis. Zymosan, a model yeast pathogen, is a beta-glucan rich particle that readily activates the complement system and then becomes C3bi-opsonized (op). Complement receptor-3 (CR3) has initially been implicated in mediating the phagocytosis of both C3bi-op and non-opsonized (nop) zymosan by MO through C3bi and beta-glucan binding sites, respectively. Later, the role of CR3 as a phagocytic beta-glucan receptor has been questioned and the supremacy of beta-glucan receptor Dectin-1 advocated. We compare here between primary mouse CNS MG and peripheral tissue MO with respect to CR3 and Dectin-1 mediated phagocytosis of C3bi-op and nop zymosan. We report that MG and MO display similar as well as dissimilar functional properties in this respect. Although CR3 and Dectin-1 function both as beta-glucan/non-opsonic receptors in MG during nop zymosan phagocytosis, Dectin-1, but not CR3, does so in MO. CR3 functions also as a C3bi/opsonic receptor in MG and MO during C3bi-op zymosan phagocytosis, leading to phagocytosis which is more efficient than that of nop zymosan. Dectin-1 contributes, albeit less than CR3, to phagocytosis of C3bi-op zymosan in MG and further less in MO, suggesting that C3bi-opsonization does not block all beta-glucan sites on zymosan from binding Dectin-1 on phagocytes. Thus, altogether CR3 and Dectin-1 contribute both to phagocytosis of nop and C3bi-op zymosan in MG, whereas MO switch from CR3-independent/Dectin-1-dependent phagocytosis of nop zymosan to phagocytosis of C3bi-op zymosan where CR3 dominates over Dectin-1.",M2
20089923,"The type I interferon-alpha mediates a more severe neurological disease in the absence of the canonical signaling molecule interferon regulatory factor 9.Type I interferons (IFN) are crucial in host defense but also are implicated as causative factors for neurological disease. Interferon regulatory factor (IRF9) is involved in type I IFN-regulated gene expression where it associates with STAT1:STAT2 heterodimers to form the transcriptional complex ISGF3. The role of IRF9 in cellular responses to type I IFN is poorly defined in vivo and hence was examined here. While transgenic mice (termed GIFN) with chronic production of low levels of IFN-alpha in the <e>CNS</e> were relatively unaffected, the same animals lacking IRF9 [GIFNxIRF9 knock-out (KO)] had cataracts, became moribund, and died prematurely. The brain of GIFNxIRF9 KO mice showed calcification with pronounced inflammation and neurodegeneration whereas inflammation and retinal degeneration affected the eyes. In addition, IFN-gamma-like gene expression in the CNS in association with IFN-gamma mRNA and increased phosphotyrosine-STAT1 suggested a role for IFN-gamma. However, GIFNxIRF9 KO mice deficient for IFN-gamma signaling developed an even more severe and accelerated disease, indicating that IFN-gamma was protective. In IRF9-deficient cultured mixed glial cells, IFN-alpha induced prolonged activation of STAT1 and STAT2 and induced the expression of IFN-gamma-like genes. We conclude that (1) type I IFN signaling and cellular responses can occur in vivo in the absence of IRF9, (2) IRF9 protects against the pathophysiological actions of type I IFN in the CNS, and (3) STAT1 and possibly STAT2 participate in alternative IRF9-independent signaling pathways activated by IFN-alpha in glial cells resulting in enhanced IFN-gamma-like responses.",M2
20087368,"Absence of the alpha v beta 3 integrin dictates the time-course of angiogenesis in the hypoxic central nervous system: accelerated endothelial proliferation correlates with compensatory increases in alpha 5 beta 1 integrin expression.Cerebral angiogenesis is an important adaptive response to hypoxia. As the alpha v beta 3 integrin is induced on angiogenic vessels in the ischemic central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>), and the suggested angiogenic role for this integrin in other systems, it is important to determine whether the alpha v beta 3 integrin is an important mediator of cerebral angiogenesis. alpha v beta 3 integrin expression was examined in a model of cerebral hypoxia, in which mice were subject to hypoxia (8% O(2)) for 0, 4, 7, or 14 days. Immunofluorescence and western blot analysis revealed that in the hypoxic CNS, alpha v beta 3 integrin was strongly induced on angiogenic brain endothelial cells (BEC), along with its ligand vitronectin. In the hypoxia model, beta 3 integrin-null mice showed no obvious defect in cerebral angiogenesis. However, early in the angiogenic process, BEC in these mice showed an increased mitotic index that correlated closely with increased alpha 5 integrin expression. In vitro experiments confirmed alpha 5 integrin upregulation on beta 3 integrin-null BEC, which also correlated with increased BEC proliferation on fibronectin. These studies confirm hypoxic induction of alpha v beta 3 integrin on angiogenic vessels, but suggest distinct roles for the BEC integrins alpha v beta 3 and alpha 5 beta 1 in cerebral angiogenesis, with alpha v beta 3 having a nonessential role, and alpha 5 beta 1 promoting BEC proliferation.",M2
20085633,"Expression profiling of prospero in the Drosophila larval chemosensory organ: Between growth and outgrowth.BACKGROUND: The antenno-maxilary complex (AMC) forms the chemosensory system of the Drosophila larva and is involved in gustatory and olfactory perception. We have previously shown that a mutant allele of the homeodomain transcription factor Prospero (prosVoila1, V1), presents several developmental defects including abnormal growth and altered taste responses. In addition, many neural tracts connecting the AMC to the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) were affected. Our earlier reports on larval AMC did not argue in favour of a role of pros in cell fate decision, but strongly suggested that pros could be involved in the control of other aspect of neuronal development. In order to identify these functions, we used microarray analysis of larval AMC and CNS tissue isolated from the wild type, and three other previously characterised prospero alleles, including the V1 mutant, considered as a null allele for the AMC. RESULTS: A total of 17 samples were first analysed with hierarchical clustering. To determine those genes affected by loss of pros function, we calculated a discriminating score reflecting the differential expression between V1 mutant and other pros alleles. We identified a total of 64 genes in the AMC. Additional manual annotation using all the computed information on the attributed role of these genes in the Drosophila larvae nervous system, enabled us to identify one functional category of potential Prospero target genes known to be involved in neurite outgrowth, synaptic transmission and more specifically in neuronal connectivity remodelling. The second category of genes found to be differentially expressed between the null mutant AMC and the other alleles concerned the development of the sensory organs and more particularly the larval olfactory system. Surprisingly, a third category emerged from our analyses and suggests an association of pros with the genes that regulate autophagy, growth and insulin pathways. Interestingly, EGFR and Notch pathways were represented in all of these three functional categories. We now propose that Pros could perform all of these different functions through the modulation of these two antagonistic and synergic pathways. CONCLUSIONS: The current data contribute to the clarification of the prospero function in the larval AMC and show that pros regulates different function in larvae as compared to those controlled by this gene in embryos. In the future, the possible mechanism by which Pros could achieve its function in the AMC will be explored in detail.",M2
20084551,"Spatiotemporal patterns of dexamethasone-induced Ras protein 1 expression in the central nervous system of rats with experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.Dexamethasone-induced Ras protein 1 (Dexras 1), a brain-enriched member of Ras subfamily of guanosine triphosphatases, as a novel physiologic nitric oxide (NO) effector, anchor neuronal nitric oxide synthase (nNOS) that could form a ternary complex with carboxy-terminal PDZ ligand of nNOS (CAPON) and nNOS, to specific targets to enhance NO signaling. The present study was to explore the expression pattern of Dexras 1 in the development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model for multiple sclerosis. Western blot and immunochemistry analysis showed that the gene and protein expression of Dexras 1 in the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) of rats increased significantly during the process of EAE compared with control groups (p &lt; 0.01) and maintain a high level in the remission period. The protein expressions of nNOS and CAPON in hippocampus were approximately paralleled Dexras 1. Immunofluorescence revealed that both neurons and glial cells expressed the Dexras 1 in EAE CNS. Importantly, the damaged CNS in EAE-affected rats showed the codistribution between Dexras 1 and caspase 3, indicating the role of Dexras 1 played in the apoptotic process in EAE. Furthermore, colocalizations of Dexras 1 were observed in neurons and glial cells in CNS with nNOS or CAPON, supporting the ternary complex in this model. Thus, these findings suggest the postulation that Dexras 1 might participate into CNS neuronal cell death and demyelination in the whole process of EAE through regulating the NO signaling by binding to nNOS and CAPON.",M2
20080941,"ZFP191 is required by oligodendrocytes for <e>CNS</e> myelination.The controlling factors that prompt mature oligodendrocytes to myelinate axons are largely undetermined. In this study, we used a forward genetics approach to identify a mutant mouse strain characterized by the absence of CNS myelin despite the presence of abundant numbers of late-stage, process-extending oligodendrocytes. Through linkage mapping and complementation testing, we identified the mutation as a single nucleotide insertion in the gene encoding zinc finger protein 191 (Zfp191), which is a widely expressed, nuclear-localized protein that belongs to a family whose members contain both DNA-binding zinc finger domains and protein-protein-interacting SCAN domains. Zfp191 mutants express an array of myelin-related genes at significantly reduced levels, and our in vitro and in vivo data indicate that mutant ZFP191 acts in a cell-autonomous fashion to disrupt oligodendrocyte function. Therefore, this study demonstrates that ZFP191 is required for the myelinating function of differentiated oligodendrocytes.",M2
20079625,"Regulating neural proliferation in the Drosophila <e>CNS</e>.Neural stem and progenitor cells generate the central nervous system (CNS) in organisms as diverse as insects and mammals. In Drosophila, multipotent asymmetrically dividing progenitors called neuroblasts produce neurons and glia throughout the developing CNS. Nevertheless, the time-windows of mitotic activity, the division modes, the termination mechanisms and the lineage sizes of individual neuroblasts all vary considerably from region-to-region. Recent studies shed light on some of the mechanisms underlying this neuroblast diversity and, in particular, how proliferation is boosted in two brain regions. In the central brain, some specialised neuroblasts generate intermediate neural progenitors that can each divide multiple times, thus increasing overall lineage size. In the optic lobe, an alternative expansion strategy involves symmetrically dividing neuroepithelial cells generating large numbers of asymmetrically dividing neuroblasts. Evidence is also emerging for a cell-intrinsic timer that alters the properties of each neuroblast with increasing developmental age. The core mechanism corresponds to a series of transcription factors that coordinates temporal changes in neuronal/glial identity with transitions in neuroblast cell-cycle speed, entry into quiescence and, ultimately, with termination.",M2
20078688,"Phytocannabinoids, <e>CNS</e> cells and development: a dead issue?ISSUES: Marijuana and hashish consist of at least 66 distinctive plant-derived (phyto-) cannabinoid compounds, with tetrahydrocannabinoids proving the most effective phytocannabinoid psychotropically. Despite the known pharmacological effects of phytocannabinoids, their role in controlling the cell survival/death decision in cells of the CNS continues to be unravelled. APPROACH: In this review, we examine the influence of phytocannabinoids on neural cell fate, with particular emphasis on how the time of marijuana exposure (neonatal vs. pubertal vs. adult) might influence the neurotoxic activities of phytocannabinoid compounds. KEY FINDINGS: Evidence in the literature indicates that exposure to phytocannabinoids during the prenatal period, in addition to the adolescent period, can alter the temporally ordered sequence of events that occur during neurotransmitter development, in addition to negatively impacting neural cell survival and maturation. Regarding the effect of marijuana consumption on brain composition in adults the evidence is contradictory. IMPLICATIONS: Exposure to marijuana during pregnancy might impact negatively on brain structure in the first years of postnatal life. Furthermore, early-onset (before age 17) marijuana use might also have damaging effects on brain composition. CONCLUSION: The neonatal and immature CNS is more susceptible to phytocannabinoid damage. In the adult CNS the data are conflicting and the continued development of methods to assess whether marijuana consumption results in brain atrophy or morphometric changes will determine if structural changes are occurring.",M2
20078558,"Delineating the impact of neuroantigen vs genetic diversity on MP4-induced EAE of C57BL/6 and B6.129 mice.MBP-PLP fusion protein (MP4)-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) is a model for multiple sclerosis (MS) that encompasses both a time-dependent attack on central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) regions and a B cell component, mirroring important features of human multiple sclerosis. Comparing C57BL/6 with B6.129 mice immunized with MP4, we point out similarities regarding these hallmarks and thus propose that they are largely dependent on the nature of the MP4 antigen itself, while differences between the two strains suggest that additional fine-tuning is brought about by the genetic repertoire of the animal. Overall, our data imply that (i) the interplay between both the antigenic trigger and genetic variables can define the outcome of MP4-induced autoimmune encephalomyelitis in C57BL/6 and B6.129 mice and (ii) that MP4 is not only a strong neuroantigen when it comes to reproducing the dynamics in effector mechanisms as is typical of the disease but also a promising agent for studying interindividual heterogeneity derived from genetic diversity in EAE/MS.",M2
20075001,"Rhythmic muscular activation pattern for fast figure-eight movement.OBJECTIVE: To address the question of how the <e>CNS</e> generates muscle activation patterns for complex gestures, we have chosen to study a figure-eight movement. We hypothesized that the well defined rhythmic aspect of this figure will provide further insights into the temporal features of multi-muscular commands. METHODS: Subjects performed, as fast as possible, figure-eights initiated in the center of the figure with 4 different initial directions and 2 positions of the shoulder. We extracted the temporal modulation of the EMG patterns by calculating conjugate cross-correlation functions. RESULTS: (1) The muscular command was tuned with respect to the rotational direction of the figure-eight, (2) two sets of synergistic muscles acted in a reciprocal mode, and (3) these reciprocal commands presented an invariant temporal correlation with the spatial component of the velocity having the highest frequency. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that the rhythmic features of certain drawing movements favor the partitioning of the muscles into synergistic groups acting in a reciprocal mode. The inclusion of an individual muscle in one group or the other takes into account the expected number of changes of direction in the movement as a whole. SIGNIFICANCE: Muscular temporal synergies may depend on the rhythmic features of the trajectory.",M2
20071578,"Predominant clonal accumulation of CD8+ T cells with moderate avidity in the central nervous systems of Theiler's virus-infected C57BL/6 mice.Induction of antigen-specific CD8(+) T cells bearing a high-avidity T-cell receptor (TCR) is thought to be an important factor in antiviral and antitumor immune responses. However, the relationship between TCR diversity and functional avidity of epitope-specific CD8(+) T cells accumulating in the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) during viral infection is unknown. Hence, analysis of T-cell diversity at the clonal level is important to understand the fate and function of virus-specific CD8(+) T cells. In this study, we examined the Vbeta diversity and avidity of CD8(+) T cells specific to the predominant epitope (VP2(121-130)) of Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus. We found that Vbeta6(+) CD8(+) T cells, associated with epitope specificity, predominantly expanded in the CNS during viral infection. Further investigations of antigen-specific Vbeta6(+) CD8(+) T cells by CDR3 spectratyping and sequencing indicated that distinct T-cell clonotypes are preferentially increased in the CNS compared to the periphery. Among the epitope-specific Vbeta6(+) CD8(+) T cells, MGX-Jbeta1.1 motif-bearing cells, which could be found at a high precursor frequency in naïve mice, were expanded in the CNS and tightly associated with gamma interferon production. These T cells displayed moderate avidity for the cognate epitope rather than the high avidity normally observed in memory/effector T cells. Therefore, our findings provide new insights into the CD8(+) T-cell repertoire during immune responses to viral infection in the CNS.",M2
20070864,"Both synthesis and reuptake are critical for replenishing the releasable serotonin pool in Drosophila.The two main sources of serotonin available for release are expected to be newly synthesized serotonin and serotonin recycled after reuptake by the serotonin transporter. However, their relative importance for maintaining release and the time course of regulation are unknown. We studied serotonin signaling in the ventral nerve cord of the larval Drosophila <e>CNS</e>. Fast-scan cyclic voltammetry at implanted microelectrodes was used to detect serotonin elicited by channelrhodopsin2-mediated depolarization. The effects of reuptake were probed by incubating in cocaine, which is selective for the serotonin transporter in Drosophila. p-chlorophenylalanine, an inhibitor of tryptophan hydroxylase2, was used to investigate the effects of synthesis. Stimulations were repeated at various intervals to assess the time course of recovery of the releasable pool. Reuptake is important for the rapid replenishment of the releasable pool, on the 1 min time scale. Synthesis is critical to the longer-term replenishment (10 min) of the releasable pool, especially when reuptake is also inhibited. Concurrent synthesis and reuptake inhibition decreased both serotonin tissue content measured by immunohistochemistry (by 50%) and the initial amount of evoked serotonin (by 65%). Decreases in evoked serotonin are rescued by inhibiting action potential propagation with tetrodotoxin, implicating endogenous activity in the depletion. These results show synthesis is necessary to replenish part of the releasable serotonin pool that is depleted after reuptake inhibition, suggesting that regulation of synthesis may modulate the effects of serotonin reuptake inhibitors.",M2
20070497,"An update on steroid responsive meningitis-arteritis.Steroid responsive meningitis-arteriitis (SRMA) is an immunemediated disorder commonly recognised in dogs in small animal practice. Two different forms of SRMA may occur. The typical, acute form of SRMA is characterised by cervical rigidity, pain, pyrexia and a polymorphonuclear pleocytosis of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). In a less common, chronic form of SRMA, additional neurological deficits consistent with a spinal cord or a multi-focal neurological disorder may be present, often accompanied by a mononuclear CSF pleocytosis. The prognosis for young dogs in the acute stage of SRMA is relatively good with early and aggressive anti-inflammatory or immunosuppressive therapy. In more protracted, relapsing cases of SRMA the prognosis is guarded, and therapy requires more aggressive, long term immunosuppression. The complete etiopathogenesis of SRMA is unknown; however, an aberrant immune response directed against the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) is most likely. Neutrophilic pleocytosis in SRMA seems to be facilitated by chemotactic factors in the CSF and upregulation of integrins and metalloproteinases that disrupt the blood brain barrier. Upregulation of IgA, induced by a Th2 immune response, also plays a central role in the pathogenesis of SRMA.",M2
20061941,"Mechanism of action of oral fingolimod (FTY720) in multiple sclerosis.Fingolimod (FTY720) is a first-in-class orally bioavailable compound that has shown efficacy in advanced clinical trials for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS). In vivo, fingolimod is phosphorylated to form fingolimod-phosphate, which resembles naturally occurring sphingosine 1-phosphate (S1P), an extracellular lipid mediator whose major effects are mediated by cognate G protein-coupled receptors. There are at least 5 S1P receptor subtypes, known as S1P subtypes 1-5 (S1P1-5), 4 of which bind fingolimod-phosphate. These receptors are expressed on a wide range of cells that are involved in many biological processes relevant to MS. S1P1 plays a key role in the immune system, regulating lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues into the circulation. Fingolimod-phosphate initially activates lymphocyte S1P1 via high-affinity receptor binding yet subsequently induces S1P1 down-regulation that prevents lymphocyte egress from lymphoid tissues, thereby reducing autoaggressive lymphocyte infiltration into the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>). S1P receptors are also expressed by many CNS cell types and have been shown to influence cell proliferation, morphology, and migration. Fingolimod crosses the blood-brain barrier and may therefore have direct CNS effects, distinguishing it from immunologically targeted MS therapies. Prophylactic administration of fingolimod to animals with experimental autoimmune encephalitis (EAE), a model of MS, completely prevents development of EAE features, whereas therapeutic administration significantly reduces clinical severity of EAE. Therapeutic efficacy observed in animal studies has been substantiated in phase 2 and 3 trials involving patients with relapsing or relapsing-remitting MS.",M2
20059771,"Glutamate, aspartate and nucleotide transporters in the SLC17 family form four main phylogenetic clusters: evolution and tissue expression.BACKGROUND: The SLC17 family of transporters transports the amino acids: glutamate and aspartate, and, as shown recently, also nucleotides. Vesicular glutamate transporters are found in distinct species, such as C. elegans, but the evolutionary origin of most of the genes in this family has been obscure. RESULTS: Our phylogenetic analysis shows that the SLC17 family consists of four main phylogenetic clades which were all present before the divergence of the insect lineage. One of these clades has not been previously described and it is not found in vertebrates. The clade containing Slc17a9 had the most restricted evolutionary history with only one member in most species. We detected expression of Slc17a1-17a4 only in the peripheral tissues but not in the <e>CNS</e>, while Slc17a5- Slc17a9 are highly expressed in both the CNS and periphery. CONCLUSIONS: The in situ hybridization studies on vesicular nucleotide transporter revealed high expression throughout the cerebral cortex, certain areas in the hippocampus and in specific nuclei of the hypothalamus and thalamus. Some of the regions with high expression, such as the medial habenula and the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, are important sites for purinergic neurotransmission. Noteworthy, other areas relying on purine-mediated signaling, such as the molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and the periaqueductal gray, lack or have a very low expression of Slc17a9, suggesting that there could be another nucleotide transporter in these regions.",M2
20052547,"A new case of GABA transaminase deficiency facilitated by proton MR spectroscopy.BACKGROUND: Deficiency of 4-aminobutyrate aminotransferase (GABA-T) is a rare disorder of GABA catabolism, with only a single sibship reported. We report on a third case, a Japanese female infant with severe psychomotor retardation and recurrent episodic lethargy with intractable seizures, with the diagnosis facilitated by proton magnetic resonance (MR) spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS). METHODS: Neuroimaging was performed at the first episode of lethargy. For (1)H-MRS, locations were placed in the semioval center and the basal ganglia. Quantification of metabolite concentrations were derived using the LCModel. We confirmed the diagnosis subsequently by enzyme and molecular studies, which involved direct DNA sequence analysis and the development of a novel multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification test. RESULTS: (1)H-MRS analysis revealed an elevated GABA concentration in the basal ganglia (2.9 mmol/l). Based on the results of quantitative (1)H-MRS and clinical findings, GABA-T deficiency was suspected and confirmed in cultured lymphoblasts. Molecular studies of the GABA-T gene revealed compound heterozygosity for a deletion of one exon and a missense mutation, 275G&gt;A, which was not detected in 210 control chromosomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that excessive prenatal GABA exposure in the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) was responsible for the clinical manifestations of GABA transaminase deficiency. Our findings suggest the dual nature of GABA as an excitatory molecule early in life, followed by a functional switch to an inhibitory species later in development. Furthermore, quantitative (1)H-MRS appears to be a useful, noninvasive tool for detecting inborn errors of GABA metabolism in the CNS.",M2
20048136,"Translational neuroimaging of the <e>CNS</e>: novel pathways to drug development.Scientists engaged in drug discovery and development face many critical issues along the road to identifying the best drug candidates to bring forward for testing in patients. In neuroscience, these challenges can involve particularly demanding questions regarding target engagement, the predict ability of endpoints in animal models, new disease model validation, CNS penetration, and the identification of pharmacodynamic markers. For neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, clinical trials of novel drugs that may modify the course of disease, rather than targeting specific symptoms, add extra layers of complexity. Major studies designed to track the course of a disease increasingly depend on noninvasive, translational imaging. In this brief review, we highlight examples of the new wave of neuroimaging studies that engender useful biomarkers of disease for translational research.",M2
20038226,"Central nervous system involvement at presentation in childhood acute lymphoblastic leukemia: management experience and lessons.This study was designed to analyze the spectrum of central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) disease at diagnosis, traumatic lumbar puncture (TLP), role of cranial irradiation, prognostic parameters, and survival outcome in patients with CNS involvement amongst 747 patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia managed at our center. Twenty-five and six patients had CNS disease and TLP, respectively. Patients with CNS involvement had significantly higher mean presenting leukocyte count (p = 0.021) and incidence of hyperleukocytosis (p = 0.01) compared to those without it. The outcome was poor with three patients in continuous complete-remission, nine relapsers, eight deaths, and eight therapy defaulters. Three patients did not opt for therapy. CNS involvement was significantly associated with inferior survival by log-rank (p = 0.03) analysis but not by Cox-multivariate (p = 0.145) analysis. CNS involvement is a high-risk indicator. Poor outcome in our cohort indicates the need for the revaluation of our treatment protocols with the inclusion of risk-stratified systemic therapy, categorization of CNS involvement into CNS1/CNS2/CNS3, and appropriate use of intrathecal therapy.",M2
20036922,"<e>CNS</e> fatigue provoked by prolonged exercise in the heat.Exercise-induced hyperthermia is associated with central fatigue as indicated by an impaired ability to sustain maximal motor activation during prolonged voluntary efforts. Therefore, exercise in hot environments challenges not only to the cardiorespiratory and locomotive systems but also to the brain. However, exercise with superimposed hyperthermia is not only a challenge to the brain it also provides an excellent model for studying factors of importance for central fatigue. Excessive heat storage within the brain appears to be the primary cause for the central fatigue during exercise in the heat, but pharmacological manipulations provide evidence for involvement of the dopaminergic system and other monoamines. Thus, enhanced dopaminergic activity may counteract hyperthermia mediated central fatigue and improve performance in the heat, while noradrenaline re-uptake inhibition appears to aggravate central fatigue and degrade exercise performance. Hyperthermia mediated central fatigue may include other cerebral perturbations such as reduced perfusion of the brain, accumulation of ammonia or depletion of neuronal energy stores, but further research is needed to elucidate their possible contributions.",M2
20036831,"Leukocyte transmigration across the blood-brain barrier: perspectives on neuroAIDS.Leukocyte trafficking serves a critical function in central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) immune surveillance. However, in many disease states leukocyte entry into the CNS is increased, which can disrupt the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and propagate neuroinflammation. These pathologic processes result in BBB permeability, glial activation, and neuronal compromise, all of which contribute to CNS damage. The resulting neuronal injury and loss are characteristic of many neuroinflammatory conditions including Alzheimer disease, multiple sclerosis, HIV-1 encephalopathy, sepsis, ischemia and reperfusion, and CNS tumors. HIV-1 encephalopathy is unique among these processes in that viral activity exacerbates CNS immune dysregulation and promotes chronic neuroinflammation and neurodegeneration. Thus, a significant number of HIV-1-infected persons exhibit neurocognitive and/or motor impairment. This review discusses the mechanisms that regulate leukocyte recruitment into the CNS and how HIV-1 infection dysregulates this process and contributes to neuropathology. Experimental BBB models to study leukocyte transmigration and the potential of targeting this transmigration across the BBB as a therapeutic strategy are also discussed.",M2
20035048,"<e>CNS</e> elevation of vascular and not mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecules in patients with multiple sclerosis.The mucosal addressin cell adhesion molecule (MAdCAM) and vascular cell adhesion molecule (VCAM) appear to play roles in the recruitment of leukocytes to specialized endothelium lining the gastrointestinal tract. The purpose of this study was to clarify the role of MAdCAM and VCAM in the central nervous system by comparing protein expression in patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and control subjects by immunohistochemistry. Specific antibodies to human VCAM and MAdCAM were used to confirm expression in control and MS nervous system specimens by immunohistochemistry. VCAM immunoreactivity was detected in endothelial cells, perivascular tissue, and in some cases, leukocytes within the meninges, gray, and white matter, of both controls and MS patients. VCAM immunoreactivity was maximal in a patient with acute active plaques, but of lower intensity and reduced distribution in controls and those with chronic active or inactive MS plaques. In contrast, MAdCAM immunoreactivity could not be detected in brain tissue from unaffected or MS patients. Taken together, these data support a role of VCAM, but not MAdCAM in the development of MS.",M2
20033986,"Antibodies to native myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein in children with inflammatory demyelinating central nervous system disease.OBJECTIVE: Myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG) is a candidate target antigen in demyelinating diseases of the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>). Although MOG is encephalitogenic in different animal models, the relevance of this antigen in human autoimmune diseases of the CNS is still controversial. METHODS: We investigated the occurrence and biological activity of antibodies to native MOG (nMOG) in 47 children during a first episode of CNS demyelination (acute disseminated encephalomyelitis [ADEM], n = 19 and clinical isolated syndrome [CIS], n = 28) by a cell-based bioassay. RESULTS: High serum immunoglobulin G (IgG) titers to nMOG were detected in 40% of children with CIS/ADEM but 0% of the control children affected by other neurological diseases, healthy children, or adults with inflammatory demyelinating diseases, respectively. By contrast, IgM antibodies to nMOG occurred in only 3 children affected by ADEM. Children with high anti-nMOG IgG titer were significantly younger than those with low IgG titer. Anti-nMOG IgG titers did not differ between the ADEM and CIS group, and did not predict conversion from CIS to MS during a mean 2-year follow-up. However, intrathecal IgG anti-MOG antibody synthesis was only seen in CIS children. IgG antibodies to nMOG not only bound to the extracellular domain of nMOG, but also induced natural killer cell-mediated killing of nMOG-expressing cells in vitro. INTERPRETATION: Overall, these findings suggest nMOG as a major target of the humoral immune response in a subgroup of children affected by inflammatory demyelinating diseases of the CNS. Children may provide valuable insight into the earliest immune mechanisms of CNS demyelination.",M2
20028334,"Immune cell entry to central nervous system--current understanding and prospective therapeutic targets.Under normal physiological conditions there is minimal entry of immune cells into the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) for the purpose of immune surveillance. During inflammation, however, extensive infiltration of immune cells can lead to the induction of CNS autoimmune disease, for example multiple sclerosis (MS) and its animal model experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). The barriers that regulate cellular entry are the blood-brain barrier (BBB) within the CNS parenchyma, and the blood-cerebrospinal fluid (blood-CSF) barrier within the choroid plexus. Understanding how these barriers function to allow the passage of leukocytes from the periphery into the CNS for normal immune surveillance, and under inflammatory conditions, is vital for the development of novel therapeutics targeting immune cell migration in CNS diseases. Contributions from selectins, chemokines, integrins and matrix metalloproteinases allow the migration of leukocytes across the BBB and into the CNS parenchyma. In EAE and MS, the strict maintenance of this process is lost and a large influx of cells is seen. This review focuses on the role of these homing molecules, chemokines and enzymes in the entry of leukocytes into the CNS during inflammatory conditions. It concludes with a model of immune cell entry of the CNS, summarising the current knowledge in this area. Targeting specific molecules to prevent infiltration of inflammatory cells into the CNS could allow disease inhibition without compromising beneficial immune surveillance.",M2

20021485,"Central nervous system congenital anomalies: a prospective neurosurgical observational study from Nigeria.This is a prospective observational study on the profile of central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) anomalies in a neurosurgical unit in Ikeja, Nigeria. All cases of CNS anomalies seen by the authors in 1 year, January to December 2005, were analyzed. Descriptive variables include some demographics of the patients and their parents; profiles of CNS anomalies, cranial or spinal, neural tube defects (NTD) or others; presence of associated anomalies; and rate of surgical correction of these anomalies. Sixty-one cases were recorded, approximately 64% of our total pediatric neurosurgical output. Forty-one cases were males, 20 females, with a male to female ratio of approximately 2 to 1. The age at presentation ranged from 2 days to 60 months (mean 5.6 months) and the majority of the parents were young (the mean ages of the fathers and mothers were 35 years and 28 years, respectively), and low income earners (70%). The cases comprised cranial (61%) and spinal (39%) anomalies, or 54% of NTD versus others. The cranial lesions were mainly congenital primary hydrocephalus in 44% of cases, encephalocele in 28%, and microcephaly in 17%. The spinal lesions were spinal dysraphism in more than 90%; all in the lumbosacral region. Seventy percent of the NTD had associated cranial or other system anomalies, mainly secondary hydrocephalus in 65%. The surgical correction rate of all of these cases was 38%. NTD were significantly more likely to present early, be associated with other anomalies and undergo surgical correction in this series (P &lt; 0.001). CNS congenital anomalies are under-reported in Nigeria and other developing countries. A call is made for the establishment of nationwide efforts to fully clarify the epidemiology of this silent epidemic.",M2

20021335,"Advances in the immune pathogenesis and treatment of multiple sclerosis.Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a disorder of the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>). It is characterized by episodic and progressive neurological dysfunction resulting from inflammatory and autoimmune reactions, myelin loss, conduction block, oligodendrocyte pathology, gliosis, and axonal loss in CNS. Recent years have witnessed advances in better understanding the immune pathogenesis of MS, prompted by animal models, human pathological observations and MRI studies. There have been significant changes in the therapeutic regimens in MS, with an emphasis on preventative treatment of an ongoing disease process. Agents in use and in the research pipeline have mechanisms that act on various anti-inflammatory and immunomodulatory properties, including blocking leukocyte migration into CNS and targeting chemoattraction. In addition, recent studies on the neurodegenerative components of MS have directed therapeutic trials to neuroprotection and neurorestoration. In this paper, we summarize the current understanding of the mechanisms of approved pharmacological agents and review the putative mechanisms and status of some important agents in clinical phase two or three trials in MS.",M2

20019816,"Coordinated regulation of SIV replication and immune responses in the <e>CNS</e>.Central nervous system (CNS) invasion during acute-stage HIV-infection has been demonstrated in a small number of individuals, but there is no evidence of neurological impairment at this stage and virus infection in brain appears to be controlled until late-stage disease. Using our reproducible SIV macaque model to examine the earliest stages of infection in the CNS, we identified immune responses that differentially regulate inflammation and virus replication in the brain compared to the peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. SIV replication in brain macrophages and in brain of SIV-infected macaques was detected at 4 days post-inoculation (p.i.). This was accompanied by upregulation of innate immune responses, including IFNbeta, IFNbeta-induced gene MxA mRNA, and TNFalpha. Additionally, IL-10, the chemokine CCL2, and activation markers in macrophages, endothelial cells, and astrocytes were all increased in the brain at four days p.i. We observed synchronous control of virus replication, cytokine mRNA levels and inflammatory markers (MHC Class II, CD68 and GFAP) by 14 days p.i.; however, control failure was followed by development of CNS lesions in the brain. SIV infection was accompanied by induction of the dominant-negative isoform of C/EBPbeta, which regulates SIV, CCL2, and IL6 transcription, as well as inflammatory responses in macrophages and astrocytes. This synchronous response in the CNS is in part due to the effect of the C/EBPbeta on virus replication and cytokine expression in macrophage-lineage cells in contrast to CD4+ lymphocytes in peripheral blood and lymphoid tissues. Thus, we have identified a crucial period in the brain when virus replication and inflammation are controlled. As in HIV-infected individuals, though, this control is not sustained in the brain. Our results suggest that intervention with antiretroviral drugs or anti-inflammatory therapeutics with CNS penetration would sustain early control. These studies further suggest that interventions should target HIV-infected individuals with increased CCL2 levels or HIV RNA in the CNS.",M2
20017662,"Various drug delivery approaches to the central nervous system.IMPORTANCE OF THE FIELD: The presence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB), an insurmountable obstacle, in particular, and other barriers in brain and periphery contribute to hindrance of the successful diagnosis and treatment of a myriad of central nervous system pathologies.

AREAS COVERED IN THIS REVIEW: Various approaches for drug delivery to the CNS with their beneficial and non-beneficial aspects, supported by an extensive literature survey published recently, up to August 2009. WHAT THE READER WILL GAIN: The reader will have the privilege of gaining an understanding of previous as well as recent approaches to breaching the CNS barriers. TAKE HOME MESSAGE: Among the various strategies discussed, the potential for efficacious CNS drug targeting in future lies either with the non-invasively administered multifunctional nanosystems or these nanosystems without characterstics such as long systemic circulating capability and avoiding reticuloendothelial system scavenging system of the body, endogenous transporters and efflux inhibitors administered by convection-enhanced delivery.",M2
20015984,"Compartmentalization and clonal amplification of HIV-1 variants in the cerebrospinal fluid during primary infection.Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1)-associated dementia (HAD) is a severe neurological disease that affects a subset of HIV-1-infected individuals. Increased compartmentalization has been reported between blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) HIV-1 populations in subjects with HAD, but it is still not known when compartmentalization arises during the course of infection. To assess HIV-1 genetic compartmentalization early during infection, we compared HIV-1 populations in the peripheral blood and CSF in 11 primary infection subjects, with analysis of longitudinal samples over the first 18 months for a subset of subjects. We used heteroduplex tracking assays targeting the variable regions of env and single-genome amplification and sequence analysis of the full-length env gene to identify CSF-compartmentalized variants and to examine viral genotypes within the compartmentalized populations. For most subjects, HIV-1 populations were equilibrated between the blood and CSF compartments. However, compartmentalized HIV-1 populations were detected in the CSF of three primary infection subjects, and longitudinal analysis of one subject revealed that compartmentalization during primary HIV-1 infection was resolved. Clonal amplification of specific HIV-1 variants was identified in the CSF population of one primary infection subject. Our data show that compartmentalization can occur in the central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) of subjects in primary HIV-1 infection in part through persistence of the putative transmitted parental variant or via viral genetic adaptation to the CNS environment. The presence of distinct HIV-1 populations in the CSF indicates that independent HIV-1 replication can occur in the CNS, even early after HIV-1 transmission.",M2
20015957,"Specific saposin C deficiency: <e>CNS</e> impairment and acid beta-glucosidase effects in the mouse.Saposins A, B, C and D are derived from a common precursor, prosaposin (psap). The few patients with saposin C deficiency develop a Gaucher disease-like central nervous system (CNS) phenotype attributed to diminished glucosylceramide (GC) cleavage activity by acid beta-glucosidase (GCase). The in vivo effects of saposin C were examined by creating mice with selective absence of saposin C (C-/-) using a knock-in point mutation (cysteine-to-proline) in exon 11 of the psap gene. In C-/- mice, prosaposin and saposins A, B and D proteins were present at near wild-type levels, but the saposin C protein was absent. By 1 year, the C-/- mice exhibited weakness of the hind limbs and progressive ataxia. Decreased neuromotor activity and impaired hippocampal long-term potentiation were evident. Foamy storage cells were observed in dorsal root ganglion and there was progressive loss of cerebellar Purkinje cells and atrophy of cerebellar granule cells. Ultrastructural analyses revealed inclusions in axonal processes in the spinal cord, sciatic nerve and brain, but no excess of multivesicular bodies. Activated microglial cells and astrocytes were present in thalamus, brain stem, cerebellum and spinal cord, indicating regional pro-inflammatory responses. No storage cells were found in visceral organs of these mice. The absence of saposin C led to moderate increases in GC and lactosylceramide (LacCer) and their deacylated analogues. These results support the view that saposin C has multiple roles in glycosphingolipid (GSL) catabolism as well as a prominent function in CNS and axonal integrity independent of its role as an optimizer/stabilizer of GCase.",M2
20013955,"Adipokinetic hormone (Pyrap-AKH) enhances the effect of a pyrethroid insecticide against the firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus.BACKGROUND: Adipokinetic hormones (AKHs) are insect neuropetides controlling stress situations including those elicited by insecticide treatment. The effect of Pyrap-AKH on the mortality of the firebug Pyrrhocoris apterus (L.) treated with the insecticide permethrin (Ambush 25 EC) was studied. RESULTS: Coinjection of 50 ng permethrin with 80 pmol Pyrap-AKH induced a significant 2.3-fold increase in bug mortality compared with the insecticide alone. The results were confirmed by topical coapplication of both agents (400 ng and 80 pmol respectively). Injections of 50 and 100 ng permethrin elicited a significant increase in the AKH level in <e>CNS</e> and the haemolymph. The results indicate an involvement of AKH in stress response to permethrin. The enhanced effect of insecticide by AKH treatments probably results from the stimulatory role in bug metabolism: carbon dioxide production was increased 3.5- and 2.5-fold respectively 1 and 3 h after permethrin treatment, and 4.3- and 3.4-fold after the permethrin plus AKH cotreatment, compared with the control. CONCLUSION: The elevation of metabolism could intensify the permethrin action by its faster penetration into tissues and by stimulation of biochemically active cells, and could be a reason for enhanced action of permethrin after its cotreatment with Pyrap-AKH.",M2
20012125,"Does sumatriptan cross the blood-brain barrier in animals and man?Sumatriptan, a relatively hydrophilic triptan, based on several animal studies has been regarded to be unable to cross the blood-brain barrier (BBB). In more recent animal studies there are strong indications that sumatriptan to some extent can cross the BBB. The <e>CNS</e> adverse events of sumatriptan in migraine patients and normal volunteers also indicate a more general effect of sumatriptan on CNS indicating that the drug can cross the BBB in man. It has been discussed whether a defect in the BBB during migraine attacks could be responsible for a possible central effect of sumatriptan in migraine. This review suggests that there is no need for a breakdown in the BBB to occur in order to explain a possible central CNS effect of sumatriptan.",M2
20012068,"Astrocytes: biology and pathology.Astrocytes are specialized glial cells that outnumber neurons by over fivefold. They contiguously tile the entire central nervous system (<e>CNS</e>) and exert many essential complex functions in the healthy CNS. Astrocytes respond to all forms of CNS insults through a process referred to as reactive astrogliosis, which has become a pathological hallmark of CNS structural lesions. Substantial progress has been made recently in determining functions and mechanisms of reactive astrogliosis and in identifying roles of astrocytes in CNS disorders and pathologies. A vast molecular arsenal at the disposal of reactive astrocytes is being defined. Transgenic mouse models are dissecting specific aspects of reactive astrocytosis and glial scar formation in vivo. Astrocyte involvement in specific clinicopathological entities is being defined. It is now clear that reactive astrogliosis is not a simple all-or-none phenomenon but is a finely gradated continuum of changes that occur in context-dependent manners regulated by specific signaling events. These changes range from reversible alterations in gene expression and cell hypertrophy with preservation of cellular domains and tissue structure, to long-lasting scar formation with rearrangement of tissue structure. Increasing evidence points towards the potential of reactive astrogliosis to play either primary or contributing roles in CNS disorders via loss of normal astrocyte functions or gain of abnormal effects. This article reviews (1) astrocyte functions in healthy CNS, (2) mechanisms and functions of reactive astrogliosis and glial scar formation, and (3) ways in which reactive astrocytes may cause or contribute to specific CNS disorders and lesions.",M2
20010950,"Emerging roles of Wnts in the adult nervous system.The roles of the Wnt signalling pathway in several developmental processes, including synaptic differentiation, are well characterized. The expression of Wnt ligands and Wnt signalling components in the mature mammalian <e>CNS</e> suggests that this pathway might also play a part in synaptic maintenance and function. In fact, Wnts have a crucial role in synaptic physiology, as they modulate the synaptic vesicle cycle, the trafficking of neurotransmitter receptors and the interaction of these receptors with scaffold proteins in postsynaptic regions. In addition, Wnts participate in adult neurogenesis and protect excitatory synaptic terminals from amyloid-beta oligomer toxicity. Here, the latest insights into the function of Wnt signalling in the adult nervous system and therapeutic opportunities for neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are discussed.",M2
20010807,"Secreted semaphorins control spine distribution and morphogenesis in the postnatal <e>CNS</e>.The majority of excitatory synapses in the mammalian CNS (central nervous system) are formed on dendritic spines, and spine morphology and distribution are critical for synaptic transmission, synaptic integration and plasticity. Here, we show that a secreted semaphorin, Sema3F, is a negative regulator of spine development and synaptic structure. Mice with null mutations in genes encoding Sema3F, and its holoreceptor components neuropilin-2 (Npn-2, also known as Nrp2) and plexin A3 (PlexA3, also known as Plxna3), exhibit increased dentate gyrus (DG) granule cell (GC) and cortical layer V pyramidal neuron spine number and size, and also aberrant spine distribution. Moreover, Sema3F promotes loss of spines and excitatory synapses in dissociated neurons in vitro, and in Npn-2(-/-) brain slices cortical layer V and DG GCs exhibit increased mEPSC (miniature excitatory postsynaptic current) frequency. In contrast, a distinct Sema3A-Npn-1/PlexA4 signalling cascade controls basal dendritic arborization in layer V cortical neurons, but does not influence spine morphogenesis or distribution. These disparate effects of secreted semaphorins are reflected in the restricted dendritic localization of Npn-2 to apical dendrites and of Npn-1 (also known as Nrp1) to all dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Therefore, Sema3F signalling controls spine distribution along select dendritic processes, and distinct secreted semaphorin signalling events orchestrate CNS connectivity through the differential control of spine morphogenesis, synapse formation, and the elaboration of dendritic morphology.",M2
20010506,"Cell signalling in <e>CNS</e> and immune system in depression and during antidepressant treatment: focus on glial and natural killer cells.CNS, endocrine and immune systems share the same molecules: neurotransmitters, cytokines and hormones to communicate within and among each other. Depression is associated with abnormalities in the noradrenergic, serotonergic and dopaminergic neurotransmitter systems and reductions in the level of their precursors and metabolic turnover. Most of these signalling molecules use trimeric G-proteins as a transduction system to transfer extracellular signal into cellular response. Altered levels or function of signalling proteins, especially alpha subunits of trimeric G-proteins, were found in post-mortem brain tissue and leukocytes of subject suffering from major depression. There is a considerable evidence that inflammatory response and immune system changes are the part of depression. Components of cellular immune system natural killer cells, important effectors of immune surveillance, are sensitive to stress response, and their functions are compromised in depressive subjects. Many lines of evidence also point to the loss of both neuronal and glial plasticity and neurotrophic factor support under chronic stress or in depression. There is an increasing knowledge of the role of astrocytic cells in neuroplastic processes and neurotransmitter metabolism. Alterations in the glial populations are observed in major depressive subjects. Antidepressant treatment is modulating glial signalization cascades, increasing production of neurotrophic molecules, supporting neuroplasticity processes, and also modulating functions of natural killers. At the level of membrane signalling, antidepressants show a direct influence upon G alpha subunit levels in both immune system and CNS. These findings support the view that antidepressants influence activity of natural killer and astrocytic populations, and this could be of importance in the depression etiopathogenesis and/or treatment.",M2
20007573,"Neuronal I kappa B kinase beta protects mice from autoimmune encephalomyelitis by mediating neuroprotective and immunosuppressive effects in the central nervous system.Some aspects of <e>CNS</e>-directed autoimmunity in multiple sclerosis are modeled in mice by immunization with myelin Ags where tissue damage is driven by myelin-reactive Th1 and Th17 effector lymphocytes. Whether the CNS plays an active role in controlling such autoimmune diseases is unknown. We used mice in which IkappaB kinase beta was deleted from Ca(2+)/calmodulin-dependent kinase IIalpha-expressing neurons (nIKKbetaKO) to investigate the contribution of neuronal NF-kappaB to the development of myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein 35-55-induced experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis. We show that nIKKbetaKO mice developed a severe, nonresolving disease with increased axon loss compared with controls and this was associated with significantly reduced CNS production of neuroprotective factors (vascular endothelial growth factor, CSF1-R, and FLIP) and increased production of proinflammatory cytokines (IL-6, TNF, IL-12, IL-17, and CD30L) and chemokines. The isolation of CNS-infiltrating monocytes revealed greater numbers of CD4(+) T cells, reduced numbers of NK1.1(+) cells, and a selective accumulation of Th1 cells in nIKKbetaKO CNS from early in the disease. Our results show that neurons play an important role in determining the quality and outcome of CNS immune responses, specifically that neuronal IkappaB kinase beta is required for neuroprotection, suppression of inflammation, limitation of Th1 lymphocyte accumulation, and enhancement of NK cell recruitment in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis-affected CNS and stress the importance of neuroprotective strategies for the treatment of multiple sclerosis.",M2

20003332,"Methylprednisolone inhibits IFN-gamma and IL-17 expression and production by cells infiltrating central nervous system in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis.BACKGROUND: Glucocorticoids have been shown to be effective in the treatment of autoimmune diseases of the <e>CNS</e> such as multiple sclerosis and its animal model, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). However, the mechanisms and the site of glucocorticoids' actions are still not completely defined. The aim of this study was to investigate the in vivo effect of the synthetic glucocorticoid methylprednisolone (MP) on the expression and production of proinflammatory cytokines interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-17 by cells infiltrating CNS tissue. METHODS: Experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis was induced in Dark Agouti (DA) rats by immunization with rat spinal cord homogenate mixed with adjuvants. Commencing on the day when the first EAE signs appeared, DA rats were injected daily for 3 days with MP and/or RU486, an antagonist of glucocorticoid receptor. Cytokine production and gene expression in CNS-infiltrating cells and lymph node cells were measured using ELISA and real time PCR, respectively. RESULTS: Treatment of rats with MP ameliorated EAE, and the animals recovered without relapses. Further, MP inhibited IFN-gamma and IL-17 expression and production in cells isolated from the CNS of DA rats with EAE after the last injection of MP. The observed effect of MP in vivo treatment was not mediated through depletion of CD4+ T cells among CNS infiltrating cells, or through induction of their apoptosis within the CNS. Finally, the glucocorticoid receptor-antagonist RU486 prevented the inhibitory effect of MP on IFN-gamma and IL-17 production both in vitro and in vivo, thus indicating that the observed effects of MP were mediated through glucocorticoid receptor-dependent mechanisms. CONCLUSION: Taken together, these results demonstrate that amelioration of EAE by exogenous glucocorticoids might be, at least partly, ascribed to the limitation of effector cell functions in the target tissue.",M2
20001397,"Evolution of the human <e>CNS</e> cholineric system: has this resulted in the emergence of psychiatric disease?The aim of the present study was to review the available literature on the evolutionary processes that have led to the development of the human central nervous system (CNS) cholinergic system and to test the hypothesis that such processes may have contributed to the emergence of psychiatric diseases. First, it is clear that the molecular components that have come together to form the cholinergic system in the human CNS initially had functions that were not involved in neurotransmission. Indeed, components of the cholinergic system of the human CNS may be present in nearly all forms of life and may have existed since life began. Significantly, components of the human CNS cholinergic system had begun to interact with each other millions of years ago, long before the appearance of any nervous system. Moreover, there are data to suggest that changes in the mammalian CNS cholinergic system can involve involved gene and environment interactions. Evidence is available to support the notion that the changes in functioning of the human CNS cholinergic system in individuals with psychiatric disorders may have resulted from both Darwinian and Lamarckian concepts of evolution.",M2

IgM antibodies that bind to surface antigens on oligodendrocytes enhanced remyelination in animal models of multiple sclerosis. IgM antibodies that bind to neurons stimulate neurite outgrowth and prevent neuron apoptosis. The neuron-binding IgM antibodies may have utility in CNS axon- or neuron-damaging diseases, such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, stroke, spinal cord injury, or secondary progressive multiple sclerosis. Recombinant remyelination-promoting IgM antibodies have been generated for formal toxicology studies and, after Food and Drug Administration approval, a phase 1 clinical trial. Natural autoreactive monoclonal antibodies directed against CNS cells represent novel therapeutic molecules to induce repair of the nervous system.",M2
20008293,"CD8 T cell-initiated vascular endothelial growth factor expression promotes central nervous system vascular permeability under neuroinflammatory conditions.Dysregulation of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) is a hallmark feature of numerous neurologic disorders as diverse as multiple sclerosis, stroke, epilepsy, viral hemorrhagic fevers, cerebral malaria, and acute hemorrhagic leukoencephalitis. CD8 T cells are one immune cell type that have been implicated in promoting vascular permeability in these conditions. Our laboratory has created a murine model of CD8 T cell-mediated <e>CNS</e> vascular permeability using a variation of the Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus system traditionally used to study multiple sclerosis. Previously, we demonstrated that CD8 T cells have the capacity to initiate astrocyte activation, cerebral endothelial cell tight junction protein alterations and CNS vascular permeability through a perforin-dependent process. To address the downstream mechanism by which CD8 T cells promote BBB dysregulation, in this study, we assess the role of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression in this model. We demonstrate that neuronal expression of VEGF is significantly upregulated prior to, and coinciding with, CNS vascular permeability. Phosphorylation of fetal liver kinase-1 is significantly increased early in this process indicating activation of this receptor. Specific inhibition of neuropilin-1 significantly reduced CNS vascular permeability and fetal liver kinase-1 activation, and preserved levels of the cerebral endothelial cell tight junction protein occludin. Our data demonstrate that CD8 T cells initiate neuronal expression of VEGF in the CNS under neuroinflammatory conditions, and that VEGF may be a viable therapeutic target in neurologic disease characterized by inflammation-induced BBB disruption.",M2
