19933352,"Iron sources used by the nonpathogenic lactic acid bacterium Lactobacillus sakei as revealed by electron energy loss spectroscopy and secondary-ion mass spectrometry.Lactobacillus sakei is a lactic acid bacterium naturally found on meat. Although it is generally acknowledged that lactic acid bacteria are rare species in the microbial world which do not have iron requirements, the genome sequence of L. sakei 23K has revealed quite complete genetic equipment dedicated to transport and use of this metal. Here, we aimed to investigate which iron sources could be used by this species as well as their role in the bacterium's physiology. Therefore, we developed a microscopy approach based on electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) analysis and nano-scale secondary-ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) in order to analyze the iron content of L. sakei cells. This revealed that L. sakei can use iron sources found in its natural ecosystem, myoglobin, hemoglobin, hematin, and transferrin, to ensure long-term survival during stationary phase. This study reveals that analytical image methods (EELS and SIMS) are powerful complementary tools for investigation of metal utilization by bacteria.",M1
19589997,"Dynamics of chemical bonding mapped by energy-resolved 4D electron microscopy.Chemical bonding dynamics are fundamental to the understanding of properties and behavior of materials and molecules. Here, we demonstrate the potential of time-resolved, femtosecond electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) for mapping electronic structural changes in the course of nuclear motions. For graphite, it is found that changes of milli-electron volts in the energy range of up to 50 electron volts reveal the compression and expansion of layers on the subpicometer scale (for surface and bulk atoms). These nonequilibrium structural features are correlated with the direction of change from sp2 [two-dimensional (2D) graphene] to sp3 (3D-diamond) electronic hybridization, and the results are compared with theoretical charge-density calculations. The reported femtosecond time resolution of four-dimensional (4D) electron microscopy represents an advance of 10 orders of magnitude over that of conventional EELS methods.",M1
19284893,"A transmission electron microscopy study of Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles in silica aerogel matrix using HREM, EDX, and <e>EELS</e>.Magnetic nanocomposite materials consisting of 5.5 wt% Fe-Co alloy nanoparticles in a silica aerogel matrix, with compositions Fe(x)Co(1-x) of x = 0.50 and 0.67, have been synthesized by the sol-gel method. The high-resolution transmission electron microscopy images show nanoparticles consisting of single crystal grains of body-centered cubic Fe-Co alloy, with typical crystal grain diameters of approximately 4 and 7 nm for Fe(0.5)Co(0.5) and Fe(0.67)Co(0.33) samples, respectively. The energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) spectra summed over areas of the samples gave compositions Fe(x)C(o1-x) with x = 0.48 +/- 0.06 and 0.68 +/- 0.05. The EDX spectra obtained with the 1.5 nm probe positioned at the centers of approximately 20 nanoparticles gave slightly lower concentrations of Fe, with means of x = 0.43 +/- 0.01 and x = 0.64 +/- 0.02, respectively. The Fe(0.5)Co(0.50) sample was studied using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), and EELS spectra summed over whole nanoparticles gave x = 0.47 +/- 0.06. The EELS spectra from analysis profiles of nanoparticles show a distribution of Fe and Co that is homogeneous, i.e., x = 0.5, within a precision of at best +/-0.05 in x and +/-0.4 nm in position. The present microscopy results have not shown the presence of a thin layer of iron oxide, but this might be at the limit of detectability of the methods.",M1
19157888,"Focused ion beam milling and ultramicrotomy of mineralised ivory dentine for analytical transmission electron microscopy.The use of focused ion beam (FIB) milling for preparation of sections of mineralised ivory dentine for transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is investigated. Ivory dentine is essentially composed of fibrillar type-I collagen and apatite crystals. The aim of this project is to gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between the organic and inorganic components of ivory dentine using analytical TEM, in order to utilise these analytical techniques in the context of common skeletal diseases such as osteoporosis and arthritis. TEM sections were prepared in both single and dual beam FIB instruments, using two standard lift-out techniques, in situ and ex situ. The FIB sections were systematically compared with sections prepared by ultramicrotomy, the traditional preparation route in biological systems, in terms of structural and chemical differences. A clear advantage of FIB milling over ultramicrotomy is that dehydration, embedding and section flotation can be eliminated, so that partial mineral loss due to dissolution is avoided. The characteristic banding of collagen fibrils was clearly seen in FIB milled sections without the need for any chemical staining, as is commonly employed in ultramicrotomy. The FIB milling technique was able to produce high-quality TEM sections of ivory dentine, which are suitable for further investigation using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) and energy-filtering TEM (EFTEM) to probe the collagen/apatite interface.",M1
18638188,"Application of elemental microanalysis to elucidate the role of spherites in the digestive gland of the helicid snail Chilostoma lefeburiana.In this case study we present an application of different analytical electron microscopic methods in biology, to elucidate their usefulness in such investigations. Using analytical electron microscopy, spherites in the digestive gland cells of the helicid snail Chilostoma lefeburiana were examined at three stages: just before the non-feeding period of over-wintering in November, in the middle of over-wintering in February and at its end in March. A detailed characterization of changes in the elemental composition of the spherites was characterized by a combination of transmission electron microscopy (TEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDXS), electron energy-loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) and energy filtering TEM (EFTEM). During over-wintering, the spherites passed the following changes. Before over-wintering in November, they consisted of striking concentric layers of electron-dense and electron-lucent zones, while in February and March they showed clear empty zones between materials of different electron density. In November spherites, C, O, Ca, P, Cl, Fe, Si, Na, K, Mg and S were detected, whereas in February ones C, O, N, Cl, Si and S were found and only C, O, N, Si and Cl were detected in March spherites. It is suggested that the elements missing in February and March were used in different physiological processes during over-wintering, like (1) the maintenance of the appropriate elemental composition of the internal environment, (2) accumulation of non-toxic waste materials that cannot be metabolized and (3) avoiding potential intoxication by contamination with toxic metals.",M1
18454473,"Thickness measurements with electron energy loss spectroscopy.Measurements of thickness using electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) are revised. Absolute thickness values can be quickly and accurately determined with the Kramers-Kronig sum method. The EELS data analysis is even much easier with the log-ratio method, however, absolute calibration of this method requires knowledge of the mean free path of inelastic electron scattering lambda. The latter has been measured here in a wide range of solids and a scaling law lambda approximately rho(-0.3) versus mass density rho has been revealed. EELS measurements critically depend on the excitation and collection angles. This dependence has been studied experimentally and theoretically and an efficient model has been formulated.",M1
18322296,"The development and characteristics of a high-speed <e>EELS</e> mapping system for a dedicated STEM.A new EELS (electron energy loss spectroscopy) real-time elemental mapping system has been developed for a dedicated scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM). The previous two-window-based jump-ratio system has been improved by a three-window-based system. It is shown here that the three-window imaging method has less artificial intensity in elemental maps than the two-window-based method. Using the new three-window system, the dependence of spatial resolution on the energy window width was studied experimentally and also compared with TEM-based EELS. Here it is shown experimentally that the spatial resolution of STEM-based EELS is independent of the energy window width in a range from 10 eV to 60 eV.",M1
18166483,"Development of electron energy-loss spectroscopy for nanoscience.Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) has been well established in providing the composition and chemical bonding information of materials, particularly for light elements. Its potential for structural determination has long been known but has yet to be fully explored. With the convergence of rapid development in computing power and improvement in the efficiency of the material specific electronic structure simulation, plus the recent breakthrough in the development of C(s)-corrected electron microscopy, the reconstruction of the local three dimensional structure of nanomaterial using EELS in conjunction with advanced structural imaging and diffraction techniques is becoming increasingly feasible. In this paper, we will review from our own examples the progress in EELS instrumentation, methods and simulation to illustrate the progress that has been made. They include the density-function-theory-based ab initio spectroscopic simulation for standard-less fingerprint applications for metastable polymorph identification, magic angle electron energy-loss spectroscopy as well as recent results from the dual-detectors EELS system which allows the energy instability of the spectrometer to be analyzed in real-time and eventually compensated on-line.",M1
18155913,"Local crystal anisotropy obtained in the small probe geometry.A brief review of the scattering mechanisms of spatially resolved <e>EELS</e> is given. This discussion shows that the sensitivity of EELS to scattering angle and to the symmetry or parity of a specimen excitation is closely related to spatial resolution. In the past, large probe, angle resolved experiments have been used to show that EELS can be used to obtain specimen anisotropy. It is pointed out here that under certain conditions, a small probe experiment can also be used for this purpose. This suggestion is illustrated with an analysis of EXELFS scattering in graphite in the small probe geometry.",M1
18096395,"Dose-limited spectroscopic imaging of soft materials by low-loss <e>EELS</e> in the scanning transmission electron microscope.Spectroscopic imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) using spatially resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) provides one of the few ways to quantitatively measure the real-space nanoscale morphology of soft materials such as polymers and biological tissue. This paper describes the basic principles of this technique and outlines some of the important attributes that define the achievable spatial resolution. Many soft materials can be differentiated from each other as well as from solvents based on their EELS fingerprints. Applying a multiple least squares (MLS) fitting algorithm using such spectral fingerprints to analyze spatially resolved spectrum datasets enables the quantitative mapping of the different components in a specimen. However, in contrast to TEM studies of many inorganic materials where the spatial resolution is limited principally by the spherical aberration of the objective lens, the spatial resolution associated with the imaging of radiation-sensitive soft materials is limited by the total electron dose to which they can be exposed before suffering irrevocable chemical or structural damage. The Rose criterion provides a simple guide to enhance the so-called dose-limited spatial resolution relevant to soft-materials imaging. By using the low-loss portion of an EELS spectrum where the inelastic scattering cross-sections are highest together with improvements in data-collection efficiency and post-acquisition data processing, the dose-limited resolution in spectrum images of solvated polymers has moved into the sub 10nm regime. This resolution is sufficient to solve important applications-oriented problems associated with hetero interfaces, nanoscale mixing, and nanophase separation.",M1
18082411,"High-resolution Z-contrast imaging and <e>EELS</e> study of functional oxide materials.Functional complex-oxide materials show a wide variety of properties and behaviors that cannot be found in any other class of materials, including high-temperature superconductivity and colossal magneto resistance. Consequently, this group of oxide materials has become the focus of many experimental as well as theoretical studies, aiming at understanding the fundamental mechanisms and properties that govern these complex structures. Here, we will review our high-resolution Z-contrast imaging and electron energy-loss studies of two complex-oxide materials systems, more specifically low-angle tilt grain-boundaries in YBa(2)Cu(3)O(7) (YBCO), and the spin-state transition in LaCoO(3). It will be shown that the O K-edge pre-peak can be used to quantify the hole-concentration in the vicinity of the dislocation core in YBCO, as well as to determine the Co(3+) spin-state in LaCoO(3).",M1
18042390,"Comparison of the electronic structure of a thermoelectric skutterudite before and after adding rattlers: an electron energy loss study.Skutterudites, with rattler atoms introduced in voids in the crystal unit cell, are promising thermoelectric materials. We modify the binary skutterudite with atomic content Co(8)P(24) in the cubic crystal unit cell by adding La as rattlers in all available voids and replacing Co by Fe to maintain charge balance, resulting in La(2)Fe(8)P(24). The intention is to leave the electronic structure unaltered while decreasing the thermal conductivity due to the presence of the rattlers. We compare the electronic structure of these two compounds by studying the L-edges of P and of the transition elements Co and Fe using electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>). Our studies of the transition metal white lines show that the 3d electron count is similar for Co and Fe in these compounds. As elemental Fe has one electron less than Co, this supports the notion that each La atom donates three electrons. The L-edges of P in these two skutterudites are quite similar, signalling only minor differences in electronic structure. This is in reasonable agreement with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, and with our multiple scattering FEFF calculations of the near edge structure. However, our experimental plasmon energies and dielectric functions deviate considerably from predictions based on DFT calculations.",M1
18037305,"Quantitative electron energy-loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) analyses of lead zirconate titanate.Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) analyses have been performed on a sol-gel deposited lead zirconate titanate film, showing that EELS can be used for heavy as well as light element analysis. The elemental distributions within the sol-gel layers are profiled using the Pb N(6,7)-edges, Zr M-edges, Ti L-edges and O K-edge. A multiple linear least squares fitting procedure was used to extract the Zr signal which overlaps with the Pb signal. Excellent qualitative information has been obtained on the distribution of the four elements. The non-uniform and complementary distributions of Ti and Zr within each sol-gel deposited layer are observed. The metal:oxygen elemental ratios are quantified using experimental standards of PbTiO(3), PbZrO(3), ZrO(2) and TiO(2) to provide relevant cross-section ratios. The quantitative results obtained for Ti/O and Pb/O are very good but the Zr/O results are less accurate. Methods of further improving the results are discussed.",M1
17936361,"Sub-cellular localization of manganese in the basal ganglia of normal and manganese-treated rats An electron spectroscopy imaging and electron energy-loss spectroscopy study.We have studied at the ultrastructural level the presence of manganese (Mn) in rat basal ganglia, which are target regions of the brain for Mn toxicity. The rats underwent a moderate level of Mn exposure induced per os for 13 weeks. Mn was detected by means of electron spectroscopy imaging (ESI) and electron energy-loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) analyses on perfusion fixed samples embedded in resin. While no significant contamination by exogenous Mn occurred during the processing procedures, less than 50% of endogenous Mn was lost during fixation and dehydration of the brain samples. The residual Mn ions in the samples appeared as discrete particles, localized in selected sub-cellular organelles in a cell, suggesting that no significant translocation had occurred in the surrounding area. In control rats, the Mn sub-cellular localization and relative content were the same in neurons and astrocytes of rat striatum and globus pallidus: the Mn level was highest in the heterochromatin and in the nucleolus, intermediate in the cytoplasm, and lowest in the mitochondria (p&lt;0.001). After chronic Mn treatment, while no ultrastructural damage was detected in the neurons and glial cells, the largest rate of Mn increase was noted in the mitochondria of astrocytes (+700%), an intermediate rate in the mitochondria of neurons (+200%), and the lowest rate in the nuclei (+100%) of neurons and astrocytes; the Mn level in the cytoplasm appeared unchanged. EELS analysis detected the specific spectra of Mn L(2,3) (peak at DeltaE = 665 eV) in such organelles, confirming the findings of ESI. Although a consistent loss of Mn occurred during the processing of tissue samples, ESI and EELS can be useful methods for localization of endogenous Mn in embedded tissues. The high rate of Mn sequestration in the mitochondria of astrocytes in vivo may partly explain the outstanding capacity of astrocytes to accumulate Mn, and their early dysfunction in Mn neurotoxicity. The high level of Mn in the heterochromatin and nucleoli of neurons and astrocytes in basal conditions and its further increase after Mn overload should provide insight into new avenues of investigating the role of Mn in the normal brain and a baseline for future Mn toxicity studies.",M1
17656763,"Electron energy-loss spectroscopy as a tool for elemental analysis in biological specimens.A transmission electron microscope (TEM) accessory, the energy filter, enables the establishment of a method for elemental microanalysis, the electron energy-loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>). In conventional TEM, unscattered, elastic, and inelastic scattered electrons contribute to image information. Energy-filtering TEM (EFTEM) allows elemental analysis at the ultrastructural level by using selected inelastic scattered electrons. EELS is an excellent method for elemental microanalysis and nanoanalysis with good sensitivity and accuracy. However, it is a complex method whose potential is seldom completely exploited, especially for biological specimens. In addition to spectral analysis, parallel-EELS, we present two different imaging techniques in this chapter, namely electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) and image-EELS. We aim to introduce these techniques in this chapter with the elemental microanalysis of titanium. Ultrafine, 22-nm titanium dioxide particles are used in an inhalation study in rats to investigate the distribution of nanoparticles in lung tissue.",M1
17481348,"Electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) of iron Fischer-Tropsch catalysts.Electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), and transmission electron microscopy have been used to study iron catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. When silica-containing iron oxide precursors are activated in flowing CO, the iron phase segregates into iron carbide crystallites, leaving behind some unreduced iron oxide in an amorphous state coexisting with the silica binder. The iron carbide crystallites are found covered by characteristic amorphous carbonaceous surface layers. These amorphous species are difficult to analyze by traditional catalyst characterization techniques, which lack spatial resolution. Even a surface-sensitive technique such as XPS shows only broad carbon or iron peaks in these catalysts. As we show in this work, EELS allows us to distinguish three different carbonaceous species: reactive amorphous carbon, graphitic carbon, and carbidic carbon in the bulk of the iron carbide particles. The carbidic carbon K edge shows an intense  pi*  peak with an edge shift of about 1 eV to higher energy loss compared to that of the pi* of amorphous carbon film or graphitic carbon. EELS analysis of the oxygen K edge allows us to distinguish the amorphous unreduced iron phase from the silica binder, indicating these are two separate phases. These results shed light onto the complex phase transformations that accompany the activation of iron catalysts for Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.",M1
17450797,"Synthesis of carbon-nitrogen nanostructures by hot isostatic pressure apparatus and their field emission properties.Carbon-nitrogen (CN) nanofibers were synthesized in argon-nitrogen gas mixture at 75 MPa by high isostatic pressure (HIP) apparatus using a graphite resistive heater. The CN nanofibers were grown in random with the diameter of about 200 nm and the length over 5 microm. The structures obtained can be divided bamboo-like, spring-like, and bead necklace-like CN nanofibers. The nitrogen content of up to 8.4% was found in CN nanofibers by <e>EELS</e> analysis. Field emission results showed that the density of field emitters and the field enhancement factors changed by surface treatments and that CN nanofibers contained glass frit. The screen-printed CN nanofiber had a turn-on field of 2 V/microm.",M1
17279511,"New developments in electron energy loss spectroscopy.In the electron microscope, spectroscopic signals such as the characteristic X-rays or the energy loss of the incident beam can provide an analysis of the local composition or electronic structure. Recent improvements in the energy resolution and sensitivity of electron spectrometers have improved the quality of spectra that can be obtained. Concurrently, the calculations used to simulate and interpret spectra have made major advances. These developments will be briefly reviewed. In recent years, the focus of analytical electron microscopy has moved away from single spectrum acquisition to mapping and imaging. In particular, the use of spectrum imaging (SI), where a full spectrum is acquired and stored at each pixel in the image is becoming widespread. A challenge for the application of spectrum imaging is the processing of such large datasets in order to extract the significant information. When we go beyond the mapping of composition and look to map bonding and electronic structure this becomes both more important and more difficult. Approaches to processing spectrum imaging data sets acquired using electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) will be explored in this paper.",M1
17163552,"Structural characterization of modern and fossilized charcoal produced in natural fires as determined by using electron energy loss spectroscopy.Charcoal produced in natural fires is widespread, but surprisingly little is known about its structure and stability. TEM and electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) were used to characterize the organized graphite-like microcrystallites and amorphous nonorganized phases of modern charcoal that had been produced in natural fires. In addition, a semiordered structure was identified in two modern charcoal samples. Fossilized charcoal contains fewer graphite-like microcrystallites than modern samples. EELS spectra confirmed that the dominant structure in fossilized charcoal is amorphous carbon. EELS measurements also revealed that only the nonorganized phase contains oxygen, which indicates that the degradation of the fossilized charcoal structure occurs mainly through oxidation processes. The few graphite-like microcrystallites found in fossilized charcoal were composed of onion-like structures that are probably less prone to oxidation owing to their rounded structures.",M1
16800688,"Selective protein adsorption on a phase-separated solvent-cast polymer blend.Polymer-based biomedical devices are growing increasingly sophisticated as compositions evolve toward copolymers and blends in order to satisfy complex design criteria. Such polymers afford opportunities for both micro- and macrophase separation at nano- and micro-length scales and raise questions concerning the role of heterogeneous surface morphology on protein adsorption. Adsorbed protein layers play a critical role in mediating the interaction of cells with polymer surfaces, and both understanding and controlling protein adsorption is assuming greater significance in the development of surfaces with enhanced physiological compatibility. Here we study the short-time adsorption of ferritin, a model protein highly resistant to denaturation and easily imaged in the transmission electron microscope (TEM), onto a phase-separated homopolymer blend of polycaprolactone (PCL) and a polycarbonate derived from desaminotyrosyl-tyrosine dodecyl ester (PDTD). At physiological pH, ferritin selectively adsorbs onto the PDTD phase at a surface density approximately three times greater than that on the PCL phase. By decreasing the pH below ferritin's isoelectric point so its average charge becomes positive, the selective adsorption disappears and the surface density of adsorbed ferritin becomes independent of the phase separation. We attribute the selectivity to the electrostatic repulsion between ferritin and hydrolytically charged PCL, both of which will have a net negative charge at physiological pH. To perform these experiments, we solvent-cast ultrathin polymer films onto dissolvable salt substrates, and we characterize the morphology by TEM imaging and quantitative spatially resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>). We find that the film morphology depends strongly on such processing-related variables as the solvent evaporation rate and the nature of the surface in contact with the polymer film during casting. The adsorption of ferritin depends on whether the film is phase-separated as well as to which surface of the film the protein solution is exposed, and these findings suggest that seemingly small variations in polymer processing that influence both the bulk and surface morphology can have a profound effect on the short-time protein adsorption.",M1
16704252,"Diffuse polymer interfaces in lobed nanoemulsions preserved in aqueous media.Using valence electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) in the cryo-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), we found that the polymer-polymer interface in two-phase nanocolloids of polydimethyl siloxane (PDMS) and copolymer (methyl acrylate (MA)-methyl methacrylate (MMA)-vinyl acetate (VA)) preserved in water was diffuse despite the fact that equilibrium thermodynamics indicates it should only be on the order of a few nanometers. The diffuse interface is a result of the kinetic trapping of the copolymer within the PDMS phase, and this finding suggests new nonequilibrium pathways to control interfaces during the synthesis of multicomponent polymeric nanostructures.",M1
16376553,"Analysis of element accumulation in cell wall attached and intracellular particles of snow algae by <e>EELS</e> and ESI.Snow algae frequently occur in alpine and polar permanent snow ecosystems and have developed adaptations to their harsh environment, where extreme temperature regimes high irradiation and low nutrient levels prevail. They live in a unique microhabitat, namely the liquid water between snow crystals. The predominant form appears as 'red snow' and in polar environment also 'green snow' frequently occurs. Light microscopy showed that most cells are densely covered by non-biotic particles of so far unknown composition. As snow normally contains very low amounts of nutrients, introduced mainly airborne like dust and precipitation, the inorganic particles at the surface of the snow algae may be important for their survival. By using electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) and electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI), we investigated element distribution in ultrathin sections of snow algae from different polar (Svalbard, 5 m a.s.l., 79 degrees N and maritime Antarctic, King George Island, 10 m a.s.l., 62 degrees S) and alpine habitats (2400-3100 m a.s.l. Tyrol) for the present study. It turned out that the main elements of the cell wall attached particles are Si, Al, Fe and O independently from the origin of the snow algae. Interestingly, the same elements were also found in vacuolar compartments inside the cells. These vacuoles contain electron dense granules or crystals and are frequently found to be connected to the cortical cytoplasm. This finding suggests an uptake mechanism of the respective elements by pinocytosis. Co-transport of toxic aluminium together with silicon may be unavoidable as the inorganic nutrient uptake of the snow algae is limited to the thin water layer between the ice crystals. However, formation of insoluble aluminium silicates may serve as detoxification mechanism.",M1
16309839,"Probing the population of the spin-orbit split levels in the actinide 5f states.Spin-orbit interaction in the 5f states is believed to strongly influence exotic behaviors observed in actinide metals and compounds. Understanding these interactions and how they relate to the actinide series is of considerable importance. To address this issue, the branching ratio of the white-line peaks of the N4,5 edge for the light actinide metals, alpha-Th, alpha-U, and alpha-Pu were recorded using electron energy-loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) in a transmission electron microscope (TEM) and synchrotron-radiation-based X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS). Using the spin-orbit sum rule and the branching ratios from both experimental spectra and many-electron atomic spectral calculations, accurate values of the spin-orbit interaction, and thus the relative occupation of the j = 5/2 and 7/2 levels, are determined for the actinide 5f states. Results show that the spin-orbit sum rule works very well with both EELS and XAS spectra, needing little or no correction. This is important, since the high spatial resolution of a TEM can be used to overcome the problems of single-crystal growth often encountered with actinide metals, allowing acquisition of EELS spectra, and subsequent spin-orbit analysis, from nm-sized regions. The relative occupation numbers obtained by our method have been compared with recent theoretical results and they show a good agreement in their trend.",M1
16112165,"Coagulation of humic substances and dissolved organic matter with a ferric salt: an electron energy loss spectroscopy investigation.Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) and energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) was used to investigate the coagulation of natural organic matter with a ferric salt. Jar-test experiments were first conducted with a reconstituted water containing either synthetic or natural extracts of humic substances, and then with a raw water from Moselle River (France). The characterization of the freeze-dried coagulated sediment by EELS in the 250-450 eV range, showed that Fe-coagulant species predominantly associate with the carboxylic groups of organic matter, and that this interaction is accompanied by a release of previously complexed calcium ions. The variation of Fe/C elemental ratio with iron concentration provides insightful information into the coagulation mechanism of humic substances. At acid pH, Fe/C remains close to 3 over the whole range of iron concentrations investigated, while a much lower atomic ratio is expected from the value of optimal coagulant dosage. This suggests that a charge neutralization/complexation mechanism is responsible for the removal of humic colloids, the aggregates being formed with both iron-coagulated and proton-neutralized organic compounds. At pH 8, the decrease in Fe/C around optimal coagulant concentration is interpreted as a bridging of stretched humic macromolecules by Fe-hydrolyzed species. Aggregation would then result from a competition between reconformation of humic chains around coagulant species and collision of destabilized humic material. EELS also enabled a fingerpriting of natural organic substances contained in the iron-coagulated surface water, N/C elemental analyses revealing that humic colloids are removed prior to proteinic compounds.",M1
15803635,"Calcium gradients in the fish inner ear sensory epithelium and otolithic membrane visualized by energy filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM).Inner ear otolith formation in fish is supposed to be performed by the molecular release of proteinacious precursor material from the sensory epithelia, followed by an undirected and diffuse precipitation of calcium carbonate (which is mainly responsible for the functionally important weight of otoliths). The pathway of calcium into the endolymph, however, still remains obscure. Therefore, the presence of calcium within the utricle of larval cichlid fish Oreochromis mossambicus was analyzed by means of energy filtering transmission electron microscopy (EFTEM). Electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) and electron energy loss spectra (<e>EELS</e>) revealed discrete calcium precipitations, which were especially numerous in the proximal endolymph as compared to the distal endolymph. A decreasing proximo-distal gradient was also present within the proximal endolymph between the sensory epithelium and the otolith. Further calcium particles covered the peripheral proteinacious layer of the otolith. They were especially pronounced at the proximal surface of the otolith. Other calcium precipitates were found to be accumulated at the macular junctions. These results strongly suggest that the apical region of the macular epithelium is involved in the release of calcium and that calcium supply of the otoliths takes place in the proximal endolymph.",M1
15685998,"Analysis of environmental particles by atomic force microscopy, scanning and transmission electron microscopy.Due to their large specific surface and their abundance, micro and nano particles play an important role in the transport of micropollutants in the environment. Natural particles are usually composed of a mixture of inorganic amorphous or crystalline material (mainly FeOOH, Fe(x)Oy, Mn(x)Oy and clays) and organic material (humics and polysaccharides). They all tend to occur as very small particles (1-1,000 nm in diameter). Most natural amorphous particles are unstable and tend to transform with time towards more crystalline forms, either by aging or possibly, by dissolution and re-crystallization. Such transformations affect the fate of sorbed micropollutants and the scavenging properties are therefore changed. As these entities are sensitive to dehydration (aggregation, changes in the morphology), it is highly important to observe their morphology in their natural environment and understand their composition at the scale of the individual particles. Also for the understanding and optimization of water treatment technologies, the knowledge of the occurrence and behavior of nano-particles is of high importance. Some of the possible particle analysis methods are presented: aggregation processes, biomineralization, bacterial adhesion, biofilms in freshwaters, ferrihydrite as heavy metals remover from storm water. These examples demonstrate the capabilities and focus of the microscopes. Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) allows to analyze the particles in their own environment, meaning in air or in the water. Thus, native aspects of particles can be observed. As well, forces of interactions between particles or between particles and other surfaces such as membranes will be highly valuable data. Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and for higher lateral resolution, Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) allow measurement of the morphology and composition. Especially, TEM coupled with Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (TEM-<e>EELS</e>) is a powerful technique for elemental analysis. Finally, general guidelines for the effective use of microscopic techniques are provided.",M1
15639350,"Some effects of electron channeling on electron energy loss spectroscopy.As an electron beam (of order 100 keV) travels through a crystalline solid it can be channeled down a zone axis of the crystal to form a channeling peak centered on the atomic columns. The channeling peak can be similar in size to the outer atomic orbitals. Electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) measures the losses that the electron experiences as it passes through the solid yielding information about the unoccupied density of states in the solid. The interaction matrix element for this process typically produces dipole selection rules for small angle scattering. In this paper, a theoretical calculation of the EELS cross section in the presence of strong channeling is performed for the silicon L23 edge. The presence of channeling is found to alter both the intensity and selection rules for this EELS signal as a function of depth in the solid.

15634133,"The triplet state of cytosine and its derivatives: electron impact and quantum chemical study.The excitation of the lowest electronic states and vibrational excitation of cytosine (C) have been studied using electron energy loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>, 0-100 eV) with angular analysis. The singlet states have been found to be in good agreement with UV-VIS absorption results on sublimed films, slightly blueshifted by about 0.1 eV. The EEL spectra recorded at residual energy below 2 eV show clear shoulders at energy losses of 3.50 and 4.25 eV (+/-0.1 eV). They are assigned to the lowest triplet electronic states of cytosine. Energies and molecular structures of the lowest-lying triplet state of C and its methylated and halogenated 5-X-C, 6-X-C, and 5-X, 6-X-C substituted derivatives (X=CH3, F, Cl, and Br) have been studied using quantum chemical calculations with both molecular orbital and density functional methods, in conjunction with the 6-311++G(d,p), 6-311++G(3df,2p), and aug-cc-pVTZ basis sets. The triplet-singlet energy gap obtained using coupled-cluster theory [CCSD(T)] and density functional theory (DFT) methods agrees well with those derived from EELS study. The first C's vertical triplet state is located at 3.6 eV, in good agreement with experiment. The weak band observed at 4.25 eV is tentatively assigned to the second C's vertical triplet excitation. For the substituted cytosines considered, the vertical triplet state is consistently centered at 3.0-3.2 eV above the corresponding singlet ground state but about 1.0 eV below the first excited singlet state. Geometrical relaxation involving out-of-plane distortions of hydrogen atoms leads to a stabilization of 0.6-1.0 eV in favor of the equilibrium triplet. The lowest-lying adiabatic triplet states are located at 2.3-3.0 eV. Halogen substitution at both C(5) and C(6) positions tends to reduce the triplet-singlet separations whereas methylation tends to enlarge it. The vibrational modes of triplet cytosine and the ionization energies of substituted derivatives were also evaluated.",M1

15464806,"Use of analytical microscopy to analyze the speciation of copper and chromium ions onto a low-cost biomaterial.In this paper, we present our study of the speciation of copper and hexavalent chromium sorbed onto a lignocellulosic substrate, using analytical microscopy. The lignocellulosic substrate constitutes a low-cost biomaterial that can be used in wastewater treatment. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) coupled with energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS) was used to determine the speciation of the two metal ions on the constitutive moieties of the lignocellulosic substrate. The use of a staining agent sensitive to carbon unsaturation allowed us to differentiate between the microstructures rich in lignin entities and those rich in cellulose entities. The EDX analysis showed that metal ions are preferentially sorbed onto microstructures rich in lignin moieties. The energy electron loss spectroscopy (<e>EELS</e>) was used to determine the oxidation states of chromium in association with lignocellulosic moieties. We showed that the sorption process of hexavalent chromium requires the reduction of Cr(VI) into Cr(III) and the probable oxidation of lignin moieties.",M1
20357024,"Diversified cardiovascular actions of six homologous natriuretic peptides (ANP, BNP, VNP, CNP1, CNP3, and CNP4) in conscious <e>eels</e>.The natriuretic peptide (NP) family consists of seven paralogs [atrial NP (ANP), brain NP (BNP), ventricular NP (VNP), and C-type NP 1-4 (CNP1-4)] in teleosts, but relative biological activity of the seven NPs has not been comprehensively examined using homologous peptides. In this study, we newly identified CNP3 and CNP4 in eels to use homologous peptides, but the CNP2 gene may have been silenced in this species. The CNP4 gene was expressed exclusively in the brain as CNP1, but the CNP3 gene, from which cardiac ANP, BNP, and VNP were generated by tandem duplication, was most abundantly expressed in the pituitary, suggesting its local action. All NPs induced hypotension dose dependently after intra-arterial injection with a potency order of ANP &gt; VNP &gt; BNP &gt; CNP4 &gt; CNP1 = CNP3. The degree of hypotension was similar at the ventral and dorsal aorta, indicating similar actions on the branchial and systemic circulation. The hypotension induced by cardiac NPs was longer lasting than CNPs, probably because of the difference in preferential receptors. Among cardiac NPs, the hypotensive effect of VNP lasted much longer than those of ANP and BNP, even though VNP disappeared from the blood more quickly than ANP. To analyze the unique effect of VNP, we examined possible involvement of the autonomic nervous system using ANP, VNP, and CNP3. Beta-adrenergic blockade diminished hypotensive effects of all three NPs, but alpha-adrenergic and cholinergic blockade enhanced only the effect of VNP, suggesting a specific mechanism for the VNP action. The NP-induced tachycardia was diminished by all blockers examined. Furthermore, the cardiovascular action of VNP was not impaired by a blocker of NP receptor, HS-142-1. Taken together, the homologous NPs exhibit diverse cardiovascular actions in eels partially through the autonomic nervous system, and the unique VNP action may be mediated by a novel receptor that has not been identified in teleosts.",M2
20302623,"Swimming suppresses hepatic vitellogenesis in European female silver <e>eels</e> as shown by expression of the estrogen receptor 1, vitellogenin1 and vitellogenin2 in the liver.BACKGROUND: When European silver eels (Anguilla anguilla) venture into the Atlantic Ocean for their 6,000 km semelparous spawning run to the Sargasso Sea, they are still in a prepubertal stage. Further sexual development appears to be blocked by dopaminergic inhibition of hypothalamus and pituitary activity. Recently, we found that swimming for several weeks in freshwater stimulated the incorporation of fat droplets in the oocytes. So, it was hypothesized that long term swimming in seawater would release the inhibition further and would also stimulate the production of vitellogenin by the liver. METHODS: For this study a swim-flume was constructed to allow simulated migration of migratory female silver eels for 3 months (1,420 km) in natural seawater at 20 degrees C. Primers were designed for polymerase chain reactions to measure the mRNA expression of estrogen receptor 1 (esr1), vitellogenin1 (vtg1) and vitellogenin2 (vtg2) genes in the liver of European female silver eels. RESULTS: In comparison to resting eels, swimming eels showed a diminished expression of esr1, vtg1 and vtg2 in the liver. They also had lower plasma calcium (Ca; indicative of vitellogenin) levels in their blood. This showed that vitellogenesis is more strongly suppressed in swimming than in resting eels. However, when eels were subsequently stimulated by 3 weekly carp pituitary extract injections, the expression of the same genes and plasma levels of Ca strongly increased in both groups to similar levels, thus equalizing the initial differences between resting and swimming. CONCLUSIONS: It is concluded that vitellogenesis remains suppressed during resting and even more during swimming. The fact that swimming stimulates fat deposition in the oocytes but suppresses vitellogenesis indicates that these events are separated in nature and occur sequentially. Swimming-suppressed vitellogenesis may imply that in nature eels undergo vitellogenesis and final maturation near or at the spawning grounds.",M2

In the present work, the stomachs of 64 conger <e>eels</e>, Conger conger, collected during 1999 and 2000, were examined for the presence of parasites. Four fish were infected with L3 stages of the nematode Anisakis simplex s.l.

20038666,"Olfactory sensitivity to bile fluid and bile salts in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla), goldfish (Carassius auratus) and Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) suggests a 'broad range' sensitivity not confined to those produced by conspecifics alone.Teleosts have high olfactory sensitivity to bile salts. To assess whether this phenomenon is involved in intra-specific chemical communication alone, or is part of a more ;broad range' sensitivity to bile salts produced by heterospecifics, we investigated possible differences in the odour of bile between the sexes and among different species - the eel (Anguilla anguilla), goldfish (Carassius auratus) and Mozambique tilapia (Oreochromis mossambicus) - using the electro-olfactogram (EOG). We also identified the main bile constituents by liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry. There were marked differences in olfactory response of the eel to thin-layer chromatography fractions of bile from both sexes, and mature and immature conspecifics. Smaller differences were seen in the potency of fractions of bile from male and female goldfish and tilapia. <e>Eels</e>, goldfish and tilapia demonstrated similar olfactory sensitivity to bile from a range of different species, with no apparent correlation between the olfactory potency of bile and a phylogenetic closeness and/or similarity of diet of the donor to the receiver. The three species were able to detect odorants in thin-layer chromatography fractions of heterospecific bile even in the absence of activity in conspecific bile. Eels, goldfish and tilapia responded to both sulphated C(27) bile salts (5beta-scymnol-sulphate and 5alpha-cyprinol sulphate) and to taurine-conjugated C(24) bile salts (taurochenodeoxycholic acid, taurolithocholic acid and taurocholic acid), irrespective of whether these bile salts were present in conspecific bile. Together, these results suggest that teleosts have a broad-range olfactory sensitivity to bile salts, with potential roles in both intra-specific chemical communication and in inter-specific interactions.",M2
20025774,"Developmental dynamics of cone photoreceptors in the eel.BACKGROUND: Many fish alter their expressed visual pigments during development. The number of retinal opsins expressed and their type is normally related to the environment in which they live. <e>Eels</e> are known to change the expression of their rod opsins as they mature, but might they also change the expression of their cone opsins? RESULTS: The Rh2 and Sws2 opsin sequences from the European Eel were isolated, sequenced and expressed in vitro for an accurate measurement of their lambdamax values. In situ hybridisation revealed that glass eels express only rh2 opsin in their cone photoreceptors, while larger yellow eels continue to express rh2 opsin in the majority of their cones, but also have &lt;5% of cones which express sws2 opsin. Silver eels showed the same expression pattern as the larger yellow eels. This observation was confirmed by qPCR (quantitative polymerase chain reaction). CONCLUSIONS: Larger yellow and silver European eels express two different cone opsins, rh2 and sws2. This work demonstrates that only the Rh2 cone opsin is present in younger fish (smaller yellow and glass), the sws2 opsin being expressed additionally only by older fish and only in &lt;5% of cone cells.",M2
20016040,"Complete genome sequence and taxonomic position of anguillid herpesvirus 1.Eel herpesvirus or anguillid herpesvirus 1 (AngHV1) frequently causes disease in freshwater <e>eels</e>. The complete genome sequence of AngHV1 and its taxonomic position within the family Alloherpesviridae were determined. Shotgun sequencing revealed a 249 kbp genome including an 11 kbp terminal direct repeat that contains 7 of the 136 predicted protein-coding open reading frames. Twelve of these genes are conserved among other members of the family Alloherpesviridae and another 28 genes have clear homologues in cyprinid herpesvirus 3. Phylogenetic analyses based on amino acid sequences of five conserved genes, including the ATPase subunit of the terminase, confirm the position of AngHV1 within the family Alloherpesviridae, where it is most closely related to the cyprinid herpesviruses. Our analyses support a recent proposal to subdivide the family Alloherpesviridae into two sister clades, one containing AngHV1 and the cyprinid herpesviruses and the other containing Ictalurid herpesvirus 1 and the ranid herpesviruses.",M2

The quinolone resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of gyrA and parC genes were sequenced in these resistant strains, as well as in 8 quinolone-sensitive Aeromonas used as controls. All quinolone-resistant Aeromonas carried point mutations in the gyrA QRDR at codon 83, respectively giving rise to substitutions Ser(83)--&gt;Ile (32 strains) or Ser(83)--&gt;Val (1 strain). Almost half of these isolates (48%) carried additional point mutations in the gyrA QRDR at codon 92 and/or in the parC QRDR at codon 80 corresponding to substitutions Leu(92)--&gt;Met and Ser(80)--&gt;Ile. In all cases, MICs of quinolones were determined in the presence and absence of the efflux pump inhibitor phenylalanine-arginine beta-naphthylamide (PAbetaN). Addition of PAbetaN had no effect on the levels of resistance observed in these isolates. In conclusion, the mechanism of quinolone resistance in the Aeromonas isolates studied was related to mutations in QRDR regions of gyrA and parC genes, with little obvious involvement of pumps inhibited by PAbetaN.",M2

19453744,"Vibrio vulnificus produces quorum sensing signals of the AHL-class.Vibrio vulnificus is an aquatic pathogenic bacterium that can cause vibriosis in humans and fish. The species is subdivided into three biotypes with the fish-virulent strains belonging to biotype 2. The quorum sensing (QS) phenomenon mediated by furanosyl borate diester or autoinducer 2 (AI-2) has been described in human strains of biotype 1, and here we show that the luxS gene which encodes AI-2 is present in all strains of V. vulnificus regardless of origin, biotype or serovar. In this study, we also demonstrate that V. vulnificus produces QS signals of the acylated homoserine lactone (AHL) class (AI-1). AHLs were detected in strains of biotype 1 and 2 from water, fish and human wound infections but not in strains isolated from human septicaemic cases. The AHL compound was identified as N-butanoyl-homoserine-lactone (C(4)-HL) by both reporter strains and by HPLC-high-resolution MS. C(4)-HL was detected when AHL-positive strains were grown in low-nutrient medium [modified sea water yeast extract (MSWYE)] but not in rich media (tryptic soy broth or brain-heart infusion) and its production was enhanced when blood factors were added to MSWYE. C(4)-HL was detected in vivo, in <e>eels</e> infected with AHL-positive biotype 2 strains. No known AHL-related gene was detected by PCR or Southern blot suggesting that AHL-related genes in V. vulnificus are different from those found in other Gram-negative bacteria.",M2
19417764,"Panmixia in European eel revisited: no genetic difference between maturing adults from southern and northern Europe.Previous studies of genetic structure in the European eel have resulted in seemingly conflicting results, ranging from no detectable heterogeneity to small but statistically significant differences and isolation by distance patterns among <e>eels</e> sampled across the continental range. Differences with respect to sampling design and choice of molecular markers, combined with a lack of power estimates, complicate comparisons of existing results. In this study we have used six microsatellite markers and, for the first time, compared maturing silver eels of known age from southern and northern Europe (Italy and Baltic Sea). In comparison with previous studies, our data may give a better representation of potential spawning stocks because eels were sampled when having begun their migration toward the presumed spawning area in the Sargasso Sea. Despite large sample sizes (404 and 806 individuals) we could not observe any signs of genetic differentiation (average F(ST)=-0.00003, P=0.61), and a power analysis showed that the true level of heterogeneity (if existing) must be exceedingly small to have remained undetected (say, F(ST) &lt;0.0004). A tendency for slightly increased genetic differences between cohorts over time could be seen, but the amount of temporal change was minor and not statistically significant. Our findings reiterate the notion that previous reports of continental genetic differentiation in the European eel may be largely explained by uncontrolled temporal variation between juvenile glass eel samples.",M2
19302349,"Natural selection influences AFLP intraspecific genetic variability and introgression patterns in Atlantic <e>eels</e>.Investigating patterns of genetic variation in hybridizing species provides an opportunity to understand the impact of natural selection on intraspecific genetic variability and interspecific gene exchange. The Atlantic eels Anguilla rostrata and A. anguilla each occupy a large heterogeneous habitat upon which natural selection could differentially shape genetic variation. They also produce viable hybrids only found in Iceland. However, the possible footprint of natural selection on patterns of genetic variation within species and introgressive hybridization in Icelandic eels has never been assessed. We revisited amplified fragment length polymorphism data collected previously using population genomics and admixture analyses to test if (i) genetic variation could be influenced by non-neutral mechanisms at both the intra- and interspecific levels, and if (ii) selection could shape the spatio-temporal distribution of Icelandic hybrids. We first found candidate loci for directional selection within both species. Spatial distributions of allelic frequencies displayed by some of these loci were possibly related with the geographical patterns of life-history traits in A. rostrata, and could have been shaped by natural selection associated with an environmental gradient along European coasts in A. anguilla. Second, we identified outlier loci at the interspecific level. Non-neutral introgression was strongly suggested for some of these loci. We detected a locus at which typical A. rostrata allele hardly crossed the species genetic barrier, whereas three other loci showed accelerated patterns of introgression into A. anguilla in Iceland. Moreover, the level of introgression at these three loci increased from the glass eel to the yellow eel stage, supporting the hypothesis that differential survival of admixed genotypes partly explains the spatio-temporal pattern of hybrid abundance previously documented in Iceland.",M2
19223398,"Cortisol mobilizes mineral stores from vertebral skeleton in the European eel: an ancestral origin for glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis?Endogenous excess cortisol and glucocorticoid (GC) therapy are a major cause of secondary osteoporosis in humans. Intense bone resorption can also be observed in other vertebrates such as migratory teleost fish at the time of reproductive migration and during fasting when large amounts of calcium and phosphate are required. Using a primitive teleost, the European eel, as a model, we investigated whether cortisol could play an ancestral role in the induction of vertebral skeleton demineralization. Different histological and histomorphometric methods were performed on vertebral samples of control and cortisol-treated <e>eels</e>. We demonstrated that cortisol induced a significant bone demineralization of eel vertebrae, as shown by significant decreases of the mineral ratio measured by incineration, and the degree of mineralization measured by quantitative microradiography of vertebral sections. Histology and image analysis of ultrathin microradiographs showed the induction by cortisol of different mechanisms of bone resorption, including periosteocytic osteolysis and osteoclastic resorption. Specificity of cortisol action was investigated by comparison with the effects of sex steroids. Whereas, testosterone had no effect, estradiol induced vertebral skeleton demineralization, an effect related to the stimulated synthesis of vitellogenin (Vg), an oviparous specific phospho-calcio-lipoprotein. By contrast, the cortisol demineralization effect was not related to any stimulation of Vg. This study demonstrates GC-induced bone demineralization in an adult non-mammalian vertebrate, which undergoes natural bone resorption during its life cycle. Our data suggest that the stimulatory action of cortisol on bone loss may represent an ancestral and conserved endocrine regulation in vertebrates.",M2
19053846,"Ecomorphology of the moray bite: relationship between dietary extremes and morphological diversity.The pharyngeal jaws of moray <e>eels</e> function exclusively to transport prey from the oral jaws into the esophagus. This functional innovation in the moray pharyngeal jaw system occurred through the loss of some ancestral functions that presumably included prey processing. Therefore, the oral jaws of morays are used to capture and process prey. Dietary accounts suggest that morays can be categorized as either piscivorous or durophagous in feeding habits. These extreme feeding specializations that select for conflicting biomechanical demands on the oral jaws should result in two discrete clusters of cranial form and diet in morphospace. When functional characters underlying the oral jaws were examined for 10 muraenid species, piscivorous and durophagous morays occupied distinct areas of morphospace. Piscivores exhibited longer jaws, narrower heads, and long recurved teeth, while durophagous morays exhibited shorter jaws, greater dentary depths, and short blunt teeth. Durophagous morays process prey in their oral jaws, and their jaw-opening and jaw-closing ratios, along with their enlarged adductors, revealed jaws modified for force transmission. Pharyngeal jaw characters also separated moray species into different areas of morphospace. For example, Gymnomuraena zebra, a molluscivore, had more teeth on its pharyngobranchials than all other morays, and these teeth were long and thin compared with those of piscivores. The overall patterns of morphological variation corresponded well with moray dietary breadth. In addition, the range of jaw-opening and jaw-closing ratios revealed that for a clade of obligate carnivores, morays exhibit diverse biting behaviors.",M2
18974275,"Two distinct dopamine D2 receptor genes in the European eel: molecular characterization, tissue-specific transcription, and regulation by sex steroids.Two full-length cDNA encoding putative dopamine D2-like receptors were cloned from the brain of female European eel. The deduced protein sequences, termed D2A- and D2B-R, exhibit closer phylogenetic relationships to vertebrate D2 receptors compared with D3 and D4 or D1 receptors. The two protein sequences share 100% identity within the transmembrane domains containing the highly conserved amino acids involved in dopamine binding. Accordingly, an apparent single population of sites on eel brain membranes bound [(3)H]spiperone, a D2-R-specific antagonist, with a K(d) of 0.2 +/- 0.04 nM. However, D2A- and D2B-R significantly differ within the amino terminus and the third intracellular loop. As analyzed by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization, both receptor transcripts were found, with different relative abundance, in the majority of brain areas and in the pituitary, whereas in the retina, olfactory epithelium, spinal cord, and adipose tissue, only D2A-R gene was expressed. Because sex steroid hormones recently have been shown to regulate eel brain dopamine systems, we analyzed the effect of steroids on the amount of D2-R transcripts by quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization. In <e>eels</e> treated with testosterone, the gene expression of the D2B-R, but not D2A-R, was increased in a region-dependent manner. The effect of testosterone on D2B-R transcript levels was mimicked by dihydrotestosterone, a nonaromatizable androgen, whereas estradiol had no stimulatory action, evidencing an androgen receptor-dependent mechanism. Although functionality of the two receptors awaits determination of D2-R proteins, we hypothesize that differences in the tissue expression pattern and hormonal regulation of eel D2A- and D2B-R gene expression could represent selective forces that have contributed to the conservation of the duplicated D2-R.",M2

During this migration they have to cope with many environmental factor changes, one of them being hydrostatic pressure. We focus on the effects of hydrostatic pressure on swimming energetics: does the pressure exposure modify swimming efficiency? By using a specially designed Blazka type swimming tunnel able to work under pressure, we have measured oxygen consumption of migrating male silver eels at different swimming speeds (from 0.2 to 1.0 BL/s) first at atmospheric pressure then at 101 ATA hydrostatic pressure. The results show that pressure increases the energetic swimming efficiency by decreasing oxygen consumption for a given swimming speed. Such a pressure effect could represent a remarkable adaptation enabling eels to spare their energy stores and swim for a long time.",M2
18930131,"Microbial and histopathological study of the vibriosis caused by Vibrio vulnificus serovar E in <e>eels</e>: the metalloprotease Vvp is not an essential lesional factor.Vibrio vulnificus biotype 2 serovar E (Bt2-serE) is a zoonotic pathogen that causes a haemorrhagic septicaemia in eels, called warm water vibriosis. The main objective of the present work was to study the onset of the eel vibriosis from the microbiological and histopathological viewpoint, as well as to ascertain the role of the protease Vvp as a lesional factor by comparing the histopathological lesions caused by the wild strain and its vvp deficient derivative. The wild-type strain was observed to attach to the gills, where it multiplied following saturation dynamics, subsequently invading the blood stream and reaching the internal organs. Here it reached population sizes that are notably lower than those associated with other fish septicaemia. Parallel to bacterial growth, there was a notable decrease in haematocrit values and haemoglobin concentration in blood as well as extensive haemorrhages in all the analysed organs. The main histopathological lesions were detected in the head kidney in the form of extensive necrosis affecting the haematopoietic tissue. Very few bacteria were visualized in the different organs, most of which were close to blood cells and capillary vessels, which is compatible with the results obtained in the microbiological study. The same lesions were produced when extracellular products (ECPs) were injected instead of bacteria or when the vvp-defective mutant or its ECPs were injected. The overall results suggest that the pathology caused by V. vulnificus in the eel is not caused by massive bacterial growth in the blood and internal organs but, rather, by the effect of potent toxic factors other than the metalloprotease, which have yet to be determined.",M2

The main changes concern hydrostatic pressure and temperature that are important environmental and physiological factors when considering life in the deep sea. We focus on the consequences of pressure (from 0.1 to 12.1MPa by 1MPa steps) and temperature (9, 15, 22 degrees C) shifts on the oxygen consumption (MO(2)) at the whole animal level. Because of their morphological differences, we are also interested in males and females to evaluate the best conditions for migration. Firstly, whatever temperature, males present higher aerobic capacities than females at atmospheric pressure. Secondly, an increase in temperature increases the pressure effects in males (synergy) but decreases them in females (opposite effects). We raise the hypothesis that two different migration strategies could be used in the water column in order to reach the breeding area: males could tend to privilege pressure and cold waters (deep water) and females, on the other hand, could opt for warmer temperature surface waters.",M2
18717620,"Ammonia sensitivity of the glass eel (Anguilla anguilla L.): salinity dependence and the role of branchial sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase.Eel aquaculture is capture based and thus dependent on the fishery for juvenile glass <e>eels</e>. This fishery typically takes place in estuaries where salinity varies and ammonia levels can be elevated. Also, during capture and transport glass eels are kept at high densities and ammonia from endogenous production can increase to toxic levels. Ammonia is known to have detrimental effects on fish growth and survival. In the present study, the salinity dependence of ammonia sensitivity in glass eels acclimated to either seawater or freshwater was determined, and the possible role of branchial sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ -ATPase) was investigated. Freshwater-acclimated glass eels were found to be more sensitive to ammonia with a lethal concentration to 50% of the test organisms (LC50) value for 96 h of 3.30 mM for total ammonia nitrogen (TAN) and 117 microM for un-ionized ammonia (UIA), versus values of 4.95 mM and 138 microM, respectively, for seawater-acclimated animals. Freshwater glass eels also had significantly lower body TAN levels than seawater-acclimated glass eels, although body accumulation profiles during exposure were similar. The higher branchial Na+/K+ -ATPase activities in seawater glass eels might explain this difference in sensitivity; however, activities decreased significantly with increasing ammonia levels. There was also no salinity dependence of net ammonia flux rates (0.388 micromol of TAN/g/h). Holding glass eels at high densities characteristic of transport conditions resulted in elevated ammonia concentrations to approximately 3 mM, which coincidently approaches to the freshwater LC50 value and may therefore contribute to mortality.",M2
18605594,"How cadmium could compromise the completion of the European eel's reproductive migration.The European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) is severely threatened with extinction. Surprisingly, even though their unusual life cycle makes them particularly vulnerable to pollution, the possible contribution of contamination remains especially poorly known. Here we have investigated the possible effect of cadmium (Cd), a widespread nonessential metal, on eel reproductive capacities. Both control and Cd precontaminated female silver <e>eels</e> were experimentally matured and forced to swim in metal-free conditions to mimic their reproductive migration. Cd pre-exposure was found to strongly stimulate the pituitary-gonad-liver axis of maturing female silver eels leading to early and enhanced vitellogenesis. This was followed by a strong phenomenon of oocyte atresia and eel mortality. These phenomena occurred before oocytes could reach full maturation and were associated with a large entry of both vitellogenin and Cd into the ovaries. Indeed, a redistribution of previously stored cadmium, even from the low Cd levels of control eels, was observed during sexual maturation. Atresia and mortality phenomena were also associated with an overexpression of the pituitary gene encoding the growth hormone, a marker of physiological stress and energy reserves exhaustion. Significantly, these devastating effects of Cd were observed in organisms that presented liver and kidney Cd concentrations still below those observed in eels from Cd contaminated hydrosystems. Our research shows how common levels of cadmium contamination could disrupt endocrine pathways implicated in gonad maturation and subsequently impair reproductive capacity of eel future genitors.",M2

MG and its metabolite leucomalachite green (LMG) were detected with total concentrations up to 0.765 microg kg(-1) fresh weight in the tissues of 25 out of 45 eels caught from different lakes, a river and a canal in Berlin, Germany. In all cases, the occurrence of the residues could directly be linked to the presence of discharges by municipal STPs into the receiving surface waters. MG is a multiple-use compound that is also used to color materials. Thus, it appears to be reasonable that the residues of MG found in the eel samples originate from such uses, e.g. by wash off from clothes or paper towels colored with MG. Additional loads from legal uses of MG as veterinary drug for the treatment of ornamental fish (private aquaria) are possible. The results obtained from this study are the first proof of background contaminations of a veterinary drug found in samples of fish not intentionally treated with such agents. MG and LMG are regarded as potential genotoxic carcinogens making it impossible to establish a tolerable daily intake. A margin of exposure (MOE) approach was applied to evaluate the human health risk associated with the consumption of the eels investigated in this study. With a MOE of 3.4 million the chronic risk was classified as being very low. Nevertheless, due to their potential to act as genotoxic carcinogens, any oral exposure to residues of MG and LMG should be avoided. According to European Union law, zero tolerance applies to all residues of MG and LMG found in food for human consumption as MG is not registered for use as veterinary drug.",M2
18515727,"The cloning of eel osmotic stress transcription factor and the regulation of its expression in primary gill cell culture.In the present study, we aimed to clone an osmotic stress transcriptional factor (Ostf) from gill cells of Japanese <e>eels</e>. In addition, we measured its expression in Percoll-gradient-isolated gill chloride (CC) and pavement (PVC) cells and determined the regulation of its expression in primary gill cell culture. Using degenerative primers and RACE techniques, we cloned a cDNA of 615bp, encompassing the coding sequence of Ostf (204 amino acids). The cloned Ostf1 DNA sequence shared 84% DNA homology with the Ostf1 of tilapia. In general, the basal Ostf expression level was found to be significantly higher in CCs than in PVCs. In the direct transfer of fish from freshwater to seawater, a significant but transient induction of Ostf mRNA in CCs and PVCs was measured after 6h of acclimation. Compared with gill CCs, the level of induction measured at PVCs was lower. In the seawater-to-freshwater transfer, no significant change in Ostf transcript levels was detected in either CCs or PVCs. To decipher the regulatory mechanism of Ostf expression, we conducted experiments using primary gill cell culture to specifically address the involvement of two putative osmosensors (i.e. intracellular ion strength/macromolecular crowding and cytoskeleton) in the regulation of Ostf expression. Hypertonic treatment using impermeable solutes (i.e. NaCl, 500 mOsmol l(-1)) induced Ostf mRNA expression in 6h, but no noticeable effect was measured using permeable solute (i.e. urea, 500 mOsmol l(-1)). The induction was transcriptionally regulated and was abolished by the addition of organic osmolytes (i.e. betaine, inositol or taurine) into the culture media. Addition of colchicine (an inhibitor of microtubule polymerization) to hypertonic (with added NaCl, 500 mOsmol l(-1)) cells reduced Ostf mRNA expression, suggesting that an increase in intracellular ionic strength and the integrity of the cytoskeleton are involved in the activation of Ostf mRNA expression in the cells. Collectively, the results of this study reveal, for the first time, the differential expression of Ostf in isolated CCs and PVCs. The resulting knowledge can shed light on how Ostf participates in hyperosmotic adaptation in fish gills.",M2
18445127,"Melatonin activates brain dopaminergic systems in the eel with an inhibitory impact on reproductive function.In the eel, a deficit in gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and a strong dopaminergic (DA) inhibition are responsible for the blockade of gonad development if silver <e>eels</e> are prevented from their reproductive migration. Environmental factors that eels encounter during their oceanic reproductive migration are thought to play an important role in the stimulation of eel pubertal development. We investigated the potential role of melatonin, a known mediator of the effects of external factors on reproductive function in vertebrates. We demonstrated that a long-term melatonin treatment increased brain tyrosine hydroxylase (TH, the rate limiting enzyme of DA synthesis) mRNA expression in a region-dependent way. Melatonin stimulated the dopaminergic system of the preoptic area, which is involved in the inhibitory control of gonadotrophin [luteinising hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)] synthesis and release. Moreover, we showed that the increased TH expression appeared to be consistent with melatonin binding site distribution as shown by 2[(125)I]-melatonin labelling studies. On the other hand, melatonin had no effects on the two eel native forms of GnRH (mGnRH and cGnRH-II) mRNA expression. Concerning the pituitary-gonad axis, we showed that melatonin treatment decreased both gonadotrophin beta-subunit (LHbeta, FSHbeta) mRNA expression and reduced sexual steroid (11-ketotestosterone, oestradiol) plasma levels. This indicates that melatonin treatment had a negative effect on eel reproductive function. To our knowledge, the results of the present study provide the first evidence that melatonin enhances TH expression in specific brain regions in a non-mammalian species. By this mechanism melatonin could represent one pathway by which environmental factors could modulate reproductive function in the eel.",M2
18321400,"Eel visual pigments revisited: the fate of retinal cones during metamorphosis.During their complex life history, anguilliform <e>eels</e> go through a major metamorphosis when developing from a fresh water yellow eel into a deep-sea silver eel. In addition to major changes in body morphology, the visual system also adapts from a fresh water teleost duplex retina with rods and cones, to a specialized deep-sea retina containing only rods. The history of the rods is well documented with an initial switch from a porphyropsin to a rhodopsin (P523(2) to P501(1)) and then a total change in gene expression with the down regulation of a  freshwater  opsin and its concomitant replacement by the expression of a typical  deep-sea  opsin (P501(1) to P482(1)). Yellow eels possess only two spectral classes of single cones, one sensitive in the green presumably expressing an RH2 opsin gene and the second sensitive in the blue expressing an SWS2 opsin gene. In immature glass eels, entering into rivers from the sea, the cones contain mixtures of rhodopsins and porphyropsins, whereas the fully freshwater yellow eels have cone pigments that are almost pure porphyropsins with peak sensitivities at about 540-545 nm and 435-440 nm, respectively. However, during the early stages of metamorphosis, the pigments switch to rhodopsins with the maximum sensitivity of the  green -sensitive cone shifting to about 525 nm, somewhat paralleling, but preceding the change in rods. During metamorphosis, the cones are almost completely lost.",M2
18302969,"A field survey of metal binding to metallothionein and other cytosolic ligands in liver of <e>eels</e> using an on-line isotope dilution method in combination with size exclusion (SE) high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to Inductively Coupled Plasma time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (ICP-TOFMS).The effect of metal exposure on the accumulation and cytosolic speciation of metals in livers of wild populations of European eel with special emphasis on metallothioneins (MT) was studied. Four sampling sites in Flanders showing different degrees of heavy metal contamination were selected for this purpose. An on-line isotope dilution method in combination with size exclusion (SE) high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled to Inductively Coupled Plasma time-of-flight Mass Spectrometry (ICP-TOFMS) was used to study the cytosolic speciation of the metals. The distribution of the metals Cd, Cu, Ni, Pb and Zn among cytosolic fractions displayed strong differences. The cytosolic concentration of Cd, Ni and Pb increased proportionally with the total liver levels. However, the cytosolic concentrations of Cu and Zn only increased above a certain liver tissue threshold level. Cd, Cu and Zn, but not Pb and Ni, were largely associated with the MT pool in correspondence with the environmental exposure and liver tissue concentrations. Most of the Pb and Ni and a considerable fraction of Cu and Zn, but not Cd, were associated to High Molecular Weight (HMW) fractions. The relative importance of the Cu and Zn in the HMW fraction decreased with increasing contamination levels while the MT pool became progressively more important. The close relationship between the cytosolic metal load and the total MT levels or the metals bound on the MT pool indicates that the metals, rather than other stress factors, are the major factor determining MT induction.",M2
18236632,"The effects of five different glycans on innate immune responses by phagocytes of hybrid tilapia and Japanese <e>eels</e> Anguilla japonica.The aim of this study was to evaluate the immune responses in hybrid tilapia (Nile tilapia Oreochromis niloticus x Mozambique tilapia O. mossambicus) and Japanese eels Anguilla japonica after treatment with five glycans: barley, krestin, MacroGard, scleroglucan, and zymosan. The effects of the glycans on the innate immune responses of the fish were investigated using the phagocytic index (PI), lysozyme activity, complement opsonization, and activation assay. The results of the lysozyme assay demonstrated that the lysozyme activities increased after treatment with glycans. Moreover, based on the PI, treatment with each of the five glycans resulted in increased phagocytic activities in anterior kidney and peripheral blood phagocytes in both tilapia and Japanese eels. The opsonic effect of complement on phagocytosis in tilapia and Japanese eels were investigated using baker's yeast, which served as the activator in the classical complement pathway (CCP) and in the alternative complement pathway (ACP). Tilapia and Japanese eel sera that were treated with glycans greatly enhanced phagocytosis. The classical pathway--hemolytic complement titer (CH50) of Japanese eels treated with glycans was slightly increased in vitro and in vivo. While glycan treatment enhanced the CCP of both species in vitro and in vivo, the alternative pathway-hemolytic complement titer (ACH50) was only increased in vitro and in vivo in glycan-treated tilapia. Thus, it follows that the ACP must have been activated in tilapia treated with glycans. However, in Japanese eels, the ACH50 of the ACP activation assay was undetected in vitro or in vivo due to possible unknown factors in the Japanese eel serum that caused lysis of the rabbit red blood cells. Our study investigated the effects of glycans used to enhance phagocytosis and activate both of the complement pathways involved in stimulating the innate immune responses of Japanese eels and tilapia.",M2
18227162,"Vibrio vulnificus biotype 2 serovar E gne but not galE is essential for lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and virulence.This work aimed to establish the role of gne (encoding UDP-GalNAc 4-epimerase activity) and galE (encoding UDP-Gal-4-epimerase activity) in the biosynthesis of surface polysaccharides, as well as in the virulence for <e>eels</e> and humans of the zoonotic serovar of Vibrio vulnificus biotype 2, serovar E. DNA sequence data revealed that gne and galE are quite homologous within this species (&gt; or =90% homology). Mutation in gne of strain CECT4999 increased the surface hydrophobicity, produced deep alterations in the outer membrane architecture, and resulted in noticeable increases in the sensitivity to microcidal peptides (MP), to eel and human sera, and to phagocytosis/opsonophagocytosis. Furthermore, significant attenuation of virulence for eels and mice was observed. By contrast, mutation in galE did not alter the cellular surface, did not increase the sensitivity to MP, serum, or phagocytosis, and did not affect the virulence for fish and mice. The change in the attenuated-virulence phenotype produced by a mutation in gne was correlated with the loss of the O-antigen lipopolysaccharide (LPS), while the capsule was maintained. Complementation of a gne-deficient mutant restored the LPS structure together with the whole virulence phenotype. In conclusion, gne, but not galE, is essential for LPS biosynthesis and virulence in the zoonotic serovar of V. vulnificus biotype 2.",M2
18196573,"Functional morphology of the pharyngeal jaw apparatus in moray <e>eels</e>.Moray eels (Muraenidae) are a relatively large group of anguilliform fishes that are notable for their crevice-dwelling lifestyle and renowned for their ability to consume large prey. Morays apprehend their prey by biting and then transport prey by extreme protraction and retraction of their pharyngeal jaw apparatus. Here, we present a detailed interpretation of the mechanisms of pharyngeal jaw transport based on work with Muraena retifera. We also review what is known of the moray pharyngeal jaw apparatus from the literature and provide comparative data on the pharyngeal jaw elements and kinematics for other moray species to determine whether interspecific differences in morphology and behavior are present. Rather than comprising broad upper and lower processing tooth plates, the pharyngeal jaws of muraenine and uropterygiine morays, are long and thin and possess large, recurved teeth. Compared with the muraenines, the pharyngobranchials of the uropterygiines do not possess a horn-shaped process and their connection to the fourth epibranchial is dorsal rather than medial. In addition, the lower tooth plates do not exhibit a lateral groove that serves as a site of muscle attachment for the pharyngocleitheralis and the ventral rather than the lateral side of the lower tooth plate attaches to the fourth ceratobranchial. In all morays, the muscles positioned for protraction and retraction of the pharyngeal apparatus have undergone elongation, while maintaining the generalized attachment sites on the bones of the skull and axial skeleton. Uropterygiines lack a dorsal retractor muscle and we presume that retraction of the pharyngeal jaws is achieved by the pharyngocleitheralis and the esophagus. The fifth branchial adductor is greatly hypertrophied in all species examined, suggesting that morays can strongly adduct the pharyngeal jaws during prey transport. The kinematics of biting behavior during prey capture and transport resulted in similar magnitudes of cranial movements although the timing of kinematic events was significantly different and the duration of transport was twice as long as prey capture. We speculate that morays have evolved this alternative prey transport strategy as a means of overcoming gape constraints, while hunting in the confines of coral reefs.",M2
18156267,"A common virulence plasmid in biotype 2 Vibrio vulnificus and its dissemination aided by a conjugal plasmid.Strains of Vibrio vulnificus, a marine bacterial species pathogenic for humans and <e>eels</e>, are divided into three biotypes, and those virulent for eels are classified as biotype 2. All biotype 2 strains possess one or more plasmids, which have been shown to harbor the biotype 2-specific DNA sequences. In this study we determined the DNA sequences of three biotype 2 plasmids: pR99 (68.4 kbp) in strain CECT4999 and pC4602-1 (56.6 kb) and pC4602-2 (66.9 kb) in strain CECT4602. Plasmid pC4602-2 showed 92% sequence identity with pR99. Curing of pR99 from strain CECT4999 resulted in loss of resistance to eel serum and virulence for eels but had no effect on the virulence for mice, an animal model, and resistance to human serum. Plasmids pC4602-2 and pR99 could be transferred to the plasmid-cured strain by conjugation in the presence of pC4602-1, which was self-transmissible, and acquisition of pC4602-2 restored the virulence of the cured strain for eels. Therefore, both pR99 and pC4602-2 were virulence plasmids for eels but not mice. A gene in pR99, which encoded a novel protein and had an equivalent in pC4602-2, was further shown to be essential, but not sufficient, for the resistance to eel serum and virulence for eels. There was evidence showing that pC4602-2 may form a cointegrate with pC4602-1. An investigation of six other biotype 2 strains for the presence of various plasmid markers revealed that they all harbored the virulence plasmid and four of them possessed the conjugal plasmid in addition.",M2
17981865,"Area postrema, a brain circumventricular organ, is the site of antidipsogenic action of circulating atrial natriuretic peptide in <e>eels</e>.Accumulating evidence indicates that circulating atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) potently reduces excess drinking to ameliorate hypernatremia in seawater (SW) eels. However, the cerebral mechanism underlying the antidipsogenic effect is largely unknown. To localize the ANP target site in the brain, we examined the distribution of ANP receptors (NPR-A) in eel brain immunohistochemically using an antiserum specific for eel NPR-A. The immunoreactive NPR-A was localized in the capillaries of various brain regions. In addition, immunoreactive neurons were observed mostly in the medulla oblongata, including the reticular formation, glossopharyngeal-vagal motor complex, commissural nucleus of Cajal, and area postrema (AP). Trypan Blue, which binds serum albumin and does not cross the blood-brain barrier, was injected peripherally and stained the neurons in the AP but not other NPR-A immunopositive neurons. These histological data indicate that circulating ANP acts on the AP, which was further confirmed by physiological experiments. To this end, the AP in SW eels was topically destroyed by electric cauterization or were by chemical lesion of its neurons by kainic acid, and ANP (100 pmol kg(-1)) was then injected into the circulation. Both heat-coagulative and chemical lesions to the AP greatly reduced an antidipsogenic effect of ANP, but the ANP effect was retained in sham-operated eels and in those with lesions outside the AP. These results strongly suggest that the AP, a circumventricular organ without a blood-brain barrier, serves as a functional window of access for the circulating ANP to inhibit drinking in eels.",M2
17950736,"Relationships between locomotor behavior, morphometric characters and thyroid hormone levels give evidence of stage-dependent mechanisms in European eel upstream migration.In order to decipher movements during freshwater eel colonization, we experimentally characterized individual locomotor behavior of two eel life history stages: elvers and yellow <e>eels</e>. A ramp located at the flume tank upstream side required a specific locomotor behavior to be ascended. Placing individually tagged eels in the middle of the tank three times successively tested behavioral consistency. Eels climbing the ramp on each trial were classified as  upstream climbers  whereas eels settling in the tank middle were classified as  inactive . Both stages exhibited these two opposite consistent behaviors. However, elvers were predominantly  upstream climbers  (58.1%) whereas yellow eels were predominantly  inactive  (79.6%). We measured morphometric characters and thyroid hormones to determine if upstream activity was related to body condition and thyroid status. Elver upstream climbers had higher body condition as well as higher thyroxine (T(4)) and triiodothyronine (T(3)) levels compared with inactive elvers. Yellow eel upstream climbers had lower body length as well as higher T(3) and (T(3):T(4)) ratio compared with inactive yellow eels. This indicated that the physiological release factors for eel upstream migration may be stage dependent. For elvers, high thyroid gland activity, together with high body condition, may be the physiological release factors for migration. In contrast, for yellow eels, physiological stress may be the release factor with an increase in T(4) deiodination activity in the smallest eels. Our study revealed inter-stage and intra-stage locomotor behavior plasticity and suggested stage-dependent opposite impacts of physiological condition on eel upstream migration.",M2
17900770,"Bioaccumulation of polychlorinated biphenyls in the eel (Anguilla anguilla) at the Camargue Nature Reserve - France.Fish consumption is a potential source of human exposure to pollutants. Here, we study residue levels of PCBs in the eel, Anguilla anguilla, from the Nature Camargue Reserve in southern France. Chromatographic analysis (GC-ECD) found seventy identifiable congeners, among which, 10 are considered as dioxin-like PCBs, such as the non-ortho PCB 81 and the mono-ortho chlorobiphenyls PCB105, 114, 118, 123, 156, 157, 167, 170, 180. Toxic Equivalents (TEQ, WHO 2005 TEF-Toxic Equivalent Factors) varied among sites with a maximum in <e>eels</e> from Mornès (29.6pgg(-1) dry weight). Indicator PCBs (28, 52, 101, 118, 138, 153 and 180) were 22% and 29% of the total PCBs in livers and muscles respectively. Greater homogeneous bioaccumulation in muscle than that in liver suggests an increase risk for humans due to fish consumption.",M2
17805293,"Raptorial jaws in the throat help moray <e>eels</e> swallow large prey.Most bony fishes rely on suction mechanisms to capture and transport prey. Once captured, prey are carried by water movement inside the oral cavity to a second set of jaws in the throat, the pharyngeal jaws, which manipulate the prey and assist in swallowing. Moray eels display much less effective suction-feeding abilities. Given this reduction in a feeding mechanism that is widespread and highly conserved in aquatic vertebrates, it is not known how moray eels swallow large fish and cephalopods. Here we show that the moray eel (Muraena retifera) overcomes reduced suction capacity by launching raptorial pharyngeal jaws out of its throat and into its oral cavity, where the jaws grasp the struggling prey animal and transport it back to the throat and into the oesophagus. This is the first described case of a vertebrate using a second set of jaws to both restrain and transport prey, and is the only alternative to the hydraulic prey transport reported in teleost fishes. The extreme mobility of the moray pharyngeal jaws is made possible by elongation of the muscles that control the jaws, coupled with reduction of adjacent gill-arch structures. The discovery that pharyngeal jaws can reach up from behind the skull to grasp prey in the oral jaws reveals a major innovation that may have contributed to the success of moray eels as apex predators hunting within the complex matrix of coral reefs. This alternative prey transport mode is mechanically similar to the ratcheting mechanisms used in snakes--a group of terrestrial vertebrates that share striking morphological, behavioural and ecological convergence with moray eels.",M2
17666525,"Transcriptomic approach to the study of osmoregulation in the European eel Anguilla anguilla.In euryhaline teleosts, osmoregulation is a fundamental and dynamic process that is essential for the maintenance of ion and water balance, especially when fish migrate between fresh water (FW) and sea water (SW) environments. The European eel has proved to be an excellent model species to study the molecular and physiological adaptations associated with this osmoregulatory plasticity. The life cycle of the European eel includes two migratory periods, the second being the migration of FW <e>eels</e> back to the Sargasso Sea for reproduction. Various anatomical and physiological changes allow the successful transition to SW. The aim of this study was to use a microarray approach to screen the osmoregulatory tissues of the eel for changes in gene expression following acclimation to SW. Tissues were sampled from fish at selected intervals over a 5-mo period following FW/SW transfer, and RNA was isolated. Suppressive subtractive hybridization was used for enrichment of differentially expressed genes. Microarrays comprising 6,144 cDNAs from brain, gill, intestine, and kidney libraries were hybridized with appropriate targets and analyzed; 229 differentially expressed clones with unique sequences were identified. These clones represented the sequences for 95 known genes, with the remaining sequences (59%) being unknown. The results of the microarray analysis were validated by quantification of 28 differentially expressed genes by Northern blotting. A number of the differentially expressed genes were already known to be involved in osmoregulation, but the functional roles of many others, not normally associated with ion or water transport, remain to be characterized.",M2

A case study from the Rhine River system.In 2003, the parasite fauna of 197 European <e>eels</e> Anguilla anguilla, captured at three different locations (Laufenburg, Karlsruhe and Beneeden Leeuwen) in the River Rhine, was analysed. The eels harboured a total of 18 species, among them the protozoa (Myxidium giardi, Myxobolus kotlani and Trypanosoma granulosum), acanthocephalans (Acanthocephalus anguillae, Acanthocephalus lucii, Echinorhynchus truttae, Pomphorhynchus laevis), nematodes (Paraquimperia tenerrima, Pseudocapillaria tomentosa, Camallanus lacustris, Raphidascaris acus, Spinitectus inermis and Anguillicola crassus), cestodes (Bothriocephalus claviceps and Proteocephalus macrocephalus) and monogeneans (Pseudodactylogyrus sp.). The parasite fauna at the different locations is discussed with respect to the crustacean fauna present at these locations. The investigation shows that changes in the composition of the crustacean fauna, due to the anthropogenic breakdown of a biogeographic barrier, are reflected in the composition of the intestinal eel parasite fauna.",M2
17561018,"The intestinal guanylin system and seawater adaptation in <e>eels</e>.Guanylin and uroguanylin are principal intestinal hormones secreted into the lumen to regulate ion and water absorption via a specific receptor, guanylyl cyclase-C (GC-C). As the intestine is an essential organ for seawater (SW) adaptation in teleost fishes, the intestinal guanylin system may play a critical role in SW adaptation. Molecular biological studies identified multiple guanylins (guanylin, uroguanylin and renoguanylin) and their receptors (GC-C1 and GC-C2) in eels. The relative potency of the three ligands on cGMP production in transiently expressed receptors was uroguanylin &gt; guanylin &gt;or= renoguanylin for CG-C1 and guanylin &gt;or= renoguanylin &gt; uroguanylin for GC-C2. Eel guanylin and GC-C genes are expressed exclusively in the intestine and kidney, and the level of expression is greater in SW eels than in freshwater (FW) eels except for renoguanylin. Physiological studies using Ussing chambers showed that the middle and posterior intestine are major sites of action of guanylins, where they act on the mucosal side to decrease short circuit current (I(sc)) in a dose-dependent manner. The ID(50) of guanylins for transport inhibition was 50-fold greater than that of atrial natriuretic peptide that acts from the serosal side as an endocrine hormone. However, only guanylins reversed I(sc) to levels below zero. Pharmacological analyses using various blockers showed that among transporters and channels localized on the intestinal cells of SW teleost fish, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator Cl(-) channel (CFTR) on the apical membrane is the major target of guanylins. Collectively, guanylins are synthesized locally in the intestine and secreted into the lumen to act on the GC-Cs in the apical membrane of eel intestinal cells. Then, intracellular cGMP production after ligand-receptor interaction activates CFTR and probably induces Cl(-) and/or HCO3- secretion into the lumen as suggested in mammals. The physiological significance of the anion secretion induced by the luminal guanylin/GC-C system on SW adaptation may rival or exceed that of the serosally derived natriuretic peptides in the euryhaline eel.",M2
17451986,"Does a 5500-km swim trial stimulate early sexual maturation in the European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.)?The catadromous European eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) undertakes a 6000-km spawning migration from its freshwater habitats to the Sargasso Sea. In large Blazka swim tunnels of 127 l, the physiological effect of such a prolonged swimming performance on sexual maturation in adult female <e>eels</e> was investigated. Two groups of eels were placed in swim tunnels for 173 days, one group was able to swim at 0.5 body lengths/second (Swim group) covering a distance of c. 5500-km over the experimental period, and one group kept in static (End Control group). A control group was sampled at the start of the experiment in order to determine the initial stage of reproductive development (Initial Control group). At the end of the swim trial, the maturation parameters 11-ketotestosterone, pituitary levels of LH and plasma levels of estradiol were higher (although not significantly) in the Swim compared to the End Control group. In addition, no significant differences were observed in most measured morphometric and reproductive parameters, including eye-index, gonadosomatic index, hepatosomatic index, and plasma levels of vitellogenin, cortisol and melanophore-stimulating hormone (MSH). Also, pituitary levels of both MSH, and adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) were unaffected. In contrast, the oocyte diameter was found to be significantly higher in the Swim compared to the End Control group. Based on these observations we conclude that a period of prolonged swimming might be a physiological stimulus necessary for the onset of maturation in the European eel.",M2
17418843,"Development of real-time RT-PCR assays for eel gonadotropins and their application to the comparison of in vivo and in vitro effects of sex steroids.Gonadotropins, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), are key factors in the brain-pituitary-gonad axis and understanding their regulation remains essential for future management of eel reproduction. In this regard, we developed quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qrtRT-PCR) assays for the expression of European eel LHbeta, FSHbeta and GPalpha subunits, using the Light Cycler system. The qrtRT-PCR was adapted to permit detection of the three gonadotropin subunit mRNAs in individual pituitaries and in dispersed pituitary cells. The validated assays were applied to investigate the effects of sex steroids (estrogens and androgens) on gonadotropin subunit expression, in vivo in steroid-injected <e>eels</e>, and in vitro by steroid treatments of primary cultures of eel pituitary cells. In vivo, a stimulation of LHbeta mRNA was observed after estradiol (E2) treatments, while testosterone (T) or the non-aromatizable androgen dihydrotestosterone (DHT) had no effect. Concerning FSHbeta expression, slight but non-significant decreases were observed after both E2 and androgen treatments. Different results were obtained in vitro: E2 induced an increase in FSHbeta mRNA levels but had no effect on LHbeta expression. In contrast, androgens (T and DHT) stimulated LHbeta expression while no significant variation was observed on FSHbeta mRNA levels following androgen treatment. Concerning the GPalpha mRNA, no significant effect of sexual steroids was observed in vivo or in vitro. This demonstrated specific direct actions of steroids on gonadotropin subunit expression. The differences observed between in vivo and in vitro experiments may be explained by the involvement of cerebral control, including GnRH and dopamine neurons, and their specific regulation by sex steroids. The data indicate that sex steroid feedbacks on gonadotropins are exerted via multiple pathways, indirectly at the brain level and directly on pituitary gonadotrope cells.",M2
17234619,"Biting releases constraints on moray eel feeding kinematics.We present an analysis of prey capture functional morphology in <e>eels</e> by comparing two species of moray eels, Muraena retifera and Echidna nebulosa (Family Muraenidae), to the American eel Anguilla rostrata (Family Anguillidae). The skulls of both moray species exhibited extreme reductions of several prominent components of the suction-feeding mechanism, including the hyoid bar, the sternohyoideus muscle and the pectoral girdle. Associated with these anatomical modifications, morays showed no evidence of using suction during prey capture. From 59 video sequences of morays feeding on pieces of cut squid we saw no hyoid depression and no movement of prey toward the mouth aperture during the strike, a widely used indicator of suction-induced water flow. This was in contrast to A. rostrata, which exhibited a robust hyoid, sternohyoideus muscle and pectoral girdle, and used suction to draw prey into its mouth. Average prey capture time in morays, about 500 ms, was roughly 10 times longer than in A. rostrata, and morays frequently reversed the direction of jaw and head rotation in the midst of the strike. We tested whether the absence of suction feeding reduces temporal constraints on feeding kinematics, permitting greater variance in traits that characterize timing and the extent of motion in the neurocranium, by comparing moray eel species with A. rostrata, two Centrarchids and a cichlid. Kinematic variance was roughly 5 times higher in morays than the suction-feeding species. Prey capture by suction demands a rapid, highly coordinated series of cranial movements and the loss of this mechanism appears to have permitted slower, more variable prey capture kinematics in morays. The alternative prey capture strategy in morays, biting, may be tied to their success as predators in the confined spaces of reef crevices where they hunt for cephalopods, crustaceans and fish.",M2
17233719,"First description of nonmotile Vibrio vulnificus strains virulent for <e>eels</e>.Nonmotile Vibrio vulnificus strains were isolated as pure cultures from body ulcers and internal organs of wild diseased European eels caught in a Mediterranean freshwater coastal lagoon. All 54 V. vulnificus isolates were nonmotile, indole-, ornithine decarboxilase-, mannitol- and cellobiose-positive, developed the opaque variant in culture, belonged to the O-antigenic serovar A and were highly virulent for eels by both intraperitoneal injection and immersion challenges. The nonmotile phenotype found in our V. vulnificus isolates was stable: nonmotile cells were always recovered from experimentally infected eels; no variation in the immobility of the V. vulnificus cells was observed for repeated subculture by daily passages on solid media, at different temperatures or incubation times and with or without magnesium sulfate. Many of the fla genes of Vibrio were present in the genome of the nonmotile strains (flaCDE and flaFBA for flagellins and flaH for the distal capping protein), although we observed by transmission electron microscopy that these V. vulnificus strains always lacked the polar flagellum. This is the first report on the existence of nonmotile wild-type V. vulnificus strains.",M2
17147471,"Interspecific communicative and coordinated hunting between groupers and giant moray <e>eels</e> in the Red Sea.Intraspecific group hunting has received considerable attention because of the close links between cooperative behaviour and its cognitive demands. Accordingly, comparisons between species have focused on behaviours that can potentially distinguish between the different levels of cognitive complexity involved, such as  intentional  communication between partners in order to initiate a joint hunt, the adoption of different roles during a joint hunt (whether consistently or alternately), and the level of food sharing following a successful hunt. Here we report field observations from the Red Sea on the highly coordinated and communicative interspecific hunting between the grouper, Plectropomus pessuliferus, and the giant moray eel, Gymnothorax javanicus. We provide evidence of the following: (1) associations are nonrandom, (2) groupers signal to moray eels in order to initiate joint searching and recruit moray eels to prey hiding places, (3) signalling is dependent on grouper hunger level, and (4) both partners benefit from the association. The benefits of joint hunting appear to be due to complementary hunting skills, reflecting the evolved strategies of each species, rather than individual role specialisation during joint hunts. In addition, the partner species that catches a prey item swallows it whole immediately, making aggressive monopolisation of a carcass impossible. We propose that the potential for monopolisation of carcasses by one partner species represents the main constraint on the evolution of interspecific cooperative hunting for most potentially suitable predator combinations.",M2

Study of the morphology of this hitherto insufficiently known nematode species, including its first SEM examination, enabled a detailed redescription of H. longissimum. Present taxonomic problems in the subfamily Proleptinae Schulz, 1927 are discussed, where a new delimitation of Proleptus Dujardin, 1845, Heliconema Travassos, 1919 and Paraleptus Wu, 1927 is proposed based on the cephalic dentation. H. minnanensis [sic] Damin &amp; Heqing, 2001 is transferred to Paraleptus Wu, 1927 as P. minnanensis (Damin &amp; Heqing, 2001) n. comb. and Paraleptus chiloscyllii Yin &amp; Zhang, 1983 transferred by Damin &amp; Heqing (2001) to Heliconema, is retained in Paraleptus. H. ahiri Karve, 1941 is considered a junior synonym of H. longissimum (Ortlepp, 1923). The present finding of H. longissimum in Pisodonophis boro represents the first host record and the first record of this nematode from Thailand.",M2
17070612,"A real-time PCR assay for the rapid determination of 16S rRNA genotype in Vibrio vulnificus.In a terminal restriction fragment polymorphism (T-RFLP) study, we recently reported a significant association between the type B 16S rRNA gene and clinical strains of Vibrio vulnificus associated with the consumption of raw oysters. In the present study we describe a real-time PCR assay for the rapid determination of the 16S rRNA type of V. vulnificus isolates. This assay was used to reexamine the 16S rRNA gene type in the strains studied previously by T-RFLP and additional isolates from selected sources. Analyses revealed that 15 of the strains (10 environmental and 5 clinical) previously found to be 16S rRNA type A actually appear to possess both the type A and B genes. The presence of both alleles was confirmed by cloning and sequencing both gene types from one strain. To our knowledge, this is the first report of 16S rRNA sequence heterogeneity within individual strains of V. vulnificus. The findings confirm the T-RFLP data that 16S rRNA type may be a useful marker for determining the clinical significance of V. vulnificus in disease in humans and cultured <e>eels</e>. The real-time PCR assay is much more rapid and less resource-intensive than T-RFLP, and should facilitate further study of the occurrence and distribution of the 16S rRNA genotypes of V. vulnificus. These studies should provide more definitive estimates of the risks associated with this organism and may lead to a better understanding of its virulence mechanism(s).",M2
16917727,"PCB levels in European eel (Anguilla anguilla) from two coastal lagoons of the Mediterranean.<e>Eels</e> are exposed to pollutants due to their unusual life cycle and are vulnerable to contamination associated with sediment due to their diet, feeding habits and territoriality. Since the 1980s, a decline in American and European eel populations has been recorded. The causes of this decline still are unknown but pollution from domestic and industrial effluents is known to be involved. Since little data is available on PCB contamination in eels from Italian waters, PCBs were measured in muscle of Anguilla anguilla captured in 2001 in two brackish ecosystems of the Mediterranean: the lagoons of Orbetello and Santa Giusta (Italy). PCBs were higher in samples from Orbetello lagoon than in those detected from Santa Giusta lagoon (P &lt; 0.05). Congener and isomer analyses indicated Aroclor 1260 as a likely source of PCBs in the Orbetello and Santa Giusta samples. Only the toxic equivalents (TEQs) of mono-ortho PCBs were calculated.",M2
16869529,"A comparative study of reactive oxygen species in red muscle: pressure effects.In ectotherms as well as in endotherms, the mitochondrial respiratory chain is the major source of reactive oxygen species (ROS) including the highly reactive, hydroxyl radical (OH*). It is known that the different steps involved in ROS production and the antioxidant systems are comparable in ectotherms and endotherms. But regulatory mechanisms in ROS production are less known especially in fish submitted to environmental changes. Firstly, we performed a ROS muscle metabolism interspecies study, using trout and <e>eels</e> as ectotherms and rats as endotherms, measuring OH* production, superoxide dismutase and catalase activities and in parallel oxygen consumption (MO2). Secondly, we studied the effects of an environmental factor (hydrostatic pressure) on ROS metabolism in both fish species. The results show that, at atmospheric pressure, fish have a higher OH*/MO2 ratio than rats which exhibit a higher superoxide dismutase activity. In fish exposed to hydrostatic pressure, this ratio is reversed so that for the same MO2 value, fish produce less OH* under hydrostatic pressure than at atmospheric pressure.",M2
16869528,"Does hydrostatic pressure have an effect on reactive oxygen species in the eel?<e>Eels</e> are submitted to hydrostatic pressure (HP) during their spawning migration (about 6000 Km). Before migration, they change from the yellow to the silver stage (silvering process). The effects of HP in relation to the silvering process have been studied on aerobic metabolism and more precisely on reactive oxygen species (ROS) metabolism. HP acclimatization of yellow eels improves oxidative phosphorylation together with supposed concomitant changes in electron leak and ROS production. Therefore hydroxyl radical (OH*) production, superoxyde dismutase and catalase activities, malondialdehyde content and in parallel oxygen consumption were measured in the red muscle of long-term pressure exposed and control group yellow and silver eels. At atmospheric pressure, yellow eels exhibited significantly higher oxygen consumption and OH* production than silver eels; and significantly lower malondialdehyde content. This could be due to the increase in membrane fluidity induced by the silvering process. Long-term HP exposure decreases yellow eel oxygen consumption which becomes similar to that of the silver stage. In parallel there is a decrease in OH* production and concomitantly antioxidant enzyme activities follow the same tendency. Thus the respiratory chain improvement in pressure acclimatized yellow eels is accompanied by a ROS production decrease which could mean an electron leak decrease.",M2
16869527,"Hydrostatic pressure effects on eel mitochondrial functioning and membrane fluidity.Aerobic metabolism which is required for long swimming activities during the eel's spawning migration at depth, is a potential target for pressure effects due to its components located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (respiratory chain and oxidative phosphorylation). Previous studies have evidenced that <e>eels</e> are able to acclimatize to pressure through membrane fluidity adjustment. However these studies were performed on the premigratory stage (yellow stage), which never encounters high pressure. Metamorphosis (silvering) seems to preadapt eels (at the silver stage) to most of the environmental changes they will encounter during migration. Is it also true for pressure resistance? This study shows that yellow eels exhibit a higher pressure sensitivity than silver eels (compression effects). The acclimatization period (21 days at 10.1 MPa) cancels the differences in pressure sensitivity and in aerobic metabolism observed at 0.1 MPa between the two stages. The mechanisms, which take place in yellow eels during acclimatization to high pressure, appear to be already present in silver eels before pressure exposure. Indeed at 0.1 MPa, silver eels exhibit higher membrane fluidity and proportions of membrane polyunsaturated fatty acids. Metamorphosis, by improving membrane fluidity, seems to allow silver eels to cope with hydrostatic pressure without spending energy in acclimatization processes.",M2
16793006,"Characterization of ion channel and transporter mRNA expressions in isolated gill chloride and pavement cells of seawater acclimating <e>eels</e>.Ion channels and transporters (i.e. cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator (CFTR), inward rectifier potassium channel (eKir), Na/K-ATPase, Na/K/Cl2 co-transporter (NKCC), aquaporin-3 (AQP-3), and Na/H exchanger-1 (NHE-1)) are known to be expressed in gill epithelia of teleost fish. Owing to the anatomical complexity of gill structures, their temporal expression profile in seawater acclimating gill pavement (PVCs) and chloride cells (CCs) are limited. In this study, we isolated the gill PVCs and CCs from seawater acclimating Japanese eels to address the issue. In the gill epithelia of freshwater adapted eels, CCs expressed the highest mRNA and/or protein levels of Na/K-ATPase, NKCC, and eKir as demonstrated by real-time PCR and/or immunohistochemical staining. AQP-3 mRNA was highly expressed in freshwater PVCs and its protein was in general expressed in all gill cells. The NHE-1 transcripts were expressed in similar levels in both PVCs and CCs. CFTR mRNA transcript was almost undetectable in all the freshwater gill cell samples. Seawater acclimation induced the transcript and/or protein levels of Na/K-ATPase, NKCC, CFTR, and eKir in CCs. The upregulation and the coexpression of these transporters in CCs suggested their cohort function in mediating Na+, K+, and Cl- transport. The expression of CFTR was found to be tightly regulated as its expression was restricted only in  seawater CCs . AQP-3 transcript and protein levels in PVCs reduced significantly during the acclimation. Interestingly immunocytochemical (ICC) staining of seawater gill epithelia revealed that AQP-3 immunoreactivities were mainly localized in seawater CCs. In the acclimation, there was no significant reduction of NHE-1 mRNA in both PVCs and CCs, however its protein level dropped significantly in the seawater condition. The present study is the first to demonstrate the activation of the mRNA transcripts for the ion channels and transporters in isolated gill CCs during seawater acclimation. The activating mechanism is found to be confined primarily in CCs. These results indicated that in addition to the increase in size and number of CCs, the molecular remodeling and the functional plasticity of CCs were essential in the ion transport process during seawater acclimation.",M2
16768858,"How parasitism and pollution affect the physiological homeostasis of aquatic hosts.Parasitism poses a serious threat to hosts under certain circumstances, while the well-being of organisms is also negatively affected by environmental pollution. Little information is available on the simultaneous effects of parasites and pollutants on the physiological homeostasis of organisms. The present paper demonstrates that parasites: (i) may influence the metabolism of pollutants in infected hosts, (ii) interact with pollution in synergistic or antagonistic ways, and (iii) may induce physiological reactions in hosts which were thought to be pollutant-induced. Experimental studies on the uptake and accumulation of metals by fish reveal that fish infected with acanthocephalans have lower metal levels than uninfected hosts; e.g. Pomphorhynchus laevis reduces lead levels in fish bile, thereby diminishing or impeding the hepatic intestinal cycling of lead, which may reduce the quantity of metals available for fish. Alterations in pollutant uptake and accumulation in different intermediate and final hosts due to parasites are thus very important in the field of ecotoxicology. In addition to such alterations, there is a close interaction between the effects of pollutants and parasites which seems to be mediated at least partly by the endocrine system, which itself is closely related to the immune system in fish. Laboratory studies on <e>eels</e> experimentally infected with the swimbladder nematode Anguillicola crassus reveal that toxic chemicals such as polychlorinated biphenyls produce immunosuppressive effects which facilitate parasite infection. Similarly, an increase in serum cortisol concentration in eels due to chemical exposure and infection is correlated with decreasing levels of anti-A. crassus antibodies. Furthermore, parasites are able to elicit physiological changes which are attributed to chemicals with endocrine disrupting activity, e.g. the cestode Ligula intestinalis is known to suppress gonad development in roach. The most thoroughly documented examples of endocrine disruption in wild fish are in roach, and it is conceivable that this disruption is not only due to chemical activity but also to parasites such as L. intestinalis or species of the phylum Microspora.",M2
16768855,"Hosts and parasites as aliens.Over the past decades, various free-living animals (hosts) and their parasites have invaded recipient areas in which they had not previously occurred, thus gaining the status of aliens or exotics. In general this happened to a low extent for hundreds of years. With variable frequency, invasions have been followed by the dispersal and establishment of non-indigenous species, whether host or parasite. In the literature thus far, colonizations by both hosts and parasites have not been treated and reviewed together, although both are usually interwoven in various ways. As to those factors permitting invasive success and colonization strength, various hypotheses have been put forward depending on the scientific background of respective authors and on the conspicuousness of certain invasions. Researchers who have tried to analyse characteristic developmental patterns, the speed of dispersal or the degree of genetic divergence in populations of alien species have come to different conclusions. Among parasitologists, the applied aspects of parasite invasions, such as the negative effects on economically important hosts, have long been at the centre of interest. In this contribution, invasions by hosts as well as parasites are considered comparatively, revealing many similarities and a few differences. Two helminths, the liver fluke, Fasciola hepatica, of cattle and sheep and the swimbladder nematode, Anguillicola crassus, of <e>eels</e> are shown to be useful as model parasites for the study of animal invasions and environmental global change. Introductions of F. hepatica have been associated with imports of cattle or other grazing animals. In various target areas, susceptible lymnaeid snails serving as intermediate hosts were either naturally present and/or were introduced from the donor continent of the parasite (Europe) and/or from other regions which were not within the original range of the parasite, partly reflecting progressive stages of a global biota change. In several introduced areas, F. hepatica co-occurs with native or exotic populations of the congeneric F. gigantica, with thus far unknown implications. Over the fluke's extended range, in addition to domestic stock animals, wild native or naturalized mammals can also serve as final hosts. Indigenous and displaced populations of F. hepatica, however, have not yet been studied comparatively from an evolutionary perspective. A. crassus, from the Far East, has invaded three continents, without the previous naturalization of its natural host Anguilla japonica, by switching to the respective indigenous eel species. Local entomostrac crustaceans serve as susceptible intermediate hosts. The novel final hosts turned out to be naive in respect to the introduced nematode with far reaching consequences for the parasite's morphology (size), abundance and pathogenicity. Comparative infection experiments with Japanese and European eels yielded many differences in the hosts' immune defence, mirroring coevolution versus an abrupt host switch associated with the introduction of the helminth. In other associations of native hosts and invasive parasites, the elevated pathogenicity of the parasite seems to result from other deficiencies such as a lack of anti-parasitic behaviour of the naïve host compared to the donor host which displays distinct behavioural patterns, keeping the abundance of the parasite low. From the small amount of available literature, it can be concluded that the adaptation of certain populations of the novel host to the alien parasite takes several decades to a century or more. Summarizing all we know about hosts and parasites as aliens, tentative patterns and principles can be figured out, but individual case studies teach us that generalizations should be avoided.",M2
16762351,"Identification of eel ghrelin in plasma and stomach by radioimmunoassay and histochemistry.The structure of ghrelin has been determined in the Japanese eel, Anguilla japonica. In this study, we identified immunoreactive ghrelin in extracts from plasma and stomach of the eel by radioimmunoassay (RIA) using an antiserum against octanoylated rat ghrelin [1-11]. Using the antiserum, we examined localization of ghrelin-immunopositive cells in the eel stomach. Detection of ghrelin mRNA-expressing cells was also attempted in the eel stomach using a cRNA probe specific for the eel ghrelin gene. Furthermore, we examined ghrelin expression patterns in plasma and stomach after transfer of freshwater (FW) <e>eels</e> to seawater (SW). Multiple types of immunoreactive ghrelin were detected using RIA. These were octanoylated eel ghrelin and other ghrelins that may have different fatty acid modifications, suggesting that this RIA can detect acylated ghrelin of eels as seen previously in the case of rat. Ghrelin-immunopositive cells were observed in the mucosal layer of the stomach, especially in the neck of the fundic gland. Ghrelin mRNA-expressing cells showed similar distribution and characteristics to the immunopositive cells. Plasma ghrelin levels in FW eels starved for one week before experimentation were approximately 40 fmol/ml. Plasma ghrelin levels in control-transferred FW eels did not change for 7 days, but significantly increased on day 14. Plasma ghrelin levels transiently increased fivefold 6h after SW transfer and then declined to the FW level by 24h after transfer. Ghrelin content and ghrelin mRNA levels in the stomach did not change after SW transfer, except for a transient decrease in ghrelin content seen 24h after transfer. The present results suggest that ghrelin may participate in osmoregulation in eels.",M2
16753218,"Yeast-binding C-type lectin with opsonic activity from conger eel (Conger myriaster) skin mucus.A mannose-specific lectin with agglutination activity against a yeast, Saccharomyces serevisiae, was purified from conger eel (Conger myriaster) skin mucus. The lectin, named conCL-s, has a tetrameric structure consisting of two non-covalently associated dimers whose constituent monomers with a molecular mass of about 16,000 Da are linked by a disulphide bond. conCL-s is composed of 173 amino acid residues including a 24-residue signal peptide, and belongs to the C-type lectin family, which is typically characterized by binding to sugar in a Ca2+-dependent manner. Nevertheless, conCL-s showed Ca2+-independent activity in its yeast-binding. The gene expression of the lectin was widely detected in external and internal mucosal tissues, i.e., skin, gills, tongue, buccal cavity wall and esophagus. In these tissues, mRNA of conCL-s was exclusively distributed in club cells, which are one of the major components of the epidermis and mucosal epithelium in Anguilliforme species. conCL-s showed agglutination activity to a bacterium, Escherichia coli. Furthermore, attachment of the lectin to microspheres significantly enhanced their phagocytosis in conger eel macrophages. These findings suggest that conCL-s acts as an opsonin and plays an important role in the innate immunity on the body surface in conger <e>eels</e>.",M2
16753163,"Identification of two functional guanylin receptors in eel: multiple hormone-receptor system for osmoregulation in fish intestine and kidney.Guanylyl cyclase C (GC-C) is a single transmembrane receptor for a family of intestinal hormones, guanylins. In the eel, we previously identified three guanylins, whose gene expression was enhanced in the intestine after transfer from fresh water to seawater. However, only limited information is available about the structure and function of their receptor(s). In the present study, we cloned full-length cDNAs encoding two isoforms of GC-C, named GC-C1 and GC-C2, from eel intestine. The predicted GC-C proteins consisted of extracellular ligand-binding domain, membrane-spanning domain, kinase-like domain and cyclase catalytic domain, in which GC-C-specific sequences were largely conserved. Phylogenetic analyses showed that the cloned membrane GCs are grouped with the GC-C of other vertebrates but not with GC-A and GC-B. However, eel GC-Cs appear to have undergone unique structural evolution compared with other GC-Cs. The three eel guanylins (guanylin, uroguanylin and renoguanylin), but not eel atrial natriuretic peptide, stimulated cGMP production dose-dependently in COS cells expressing either of the cloned cDNAs, providing functional support for assignment as eel guanylin receptors. The potency order for cGMP production was uroguanylin &gt; guanylin &gt; or = renoguanylin for GC-C1; guanylin &gt; or = renoguanylin &gt; uroguanylin for GC-C2. The distinctive ligand selectivity was consistent with the low homology (53%) of the extracellular domain of the two GC-Cs compared with that observed for other domains (74-90%). Both GC-C genes were expressed in the alimentary tract (esophagus, stomach and intestine) and kidney, and their expression was higher in the intestine of seawater-adapted <e>eels</e> than that of freshwater eels just as observed with the guanylin genes. However, the expression of the receptor genes was unchanged for 24h after transfer of eels from fresh water to seawater or vice versa, showing slower response of the receptors to salinity changes than their ligands. Collectively, the multiple guanylin-GC-C system may be involved as a paracrine factor in seawater adaptation at the intestine and kidney of the eel.",M2
16679776,"Endocrine evidence that silvering, a secondary metamorphosis in the eel, is a pubertal rather than a metamorphic event.Silvering (transition from yellow to silver eel) has been traditionally considered as a metamorphosis in view of the numerous morphological, physiological and behavioral changes preparing the eel for the oceanic migration. However, some changes, such as increases in gonad weight and steroidogenesis, suggest that silvering could also be considered as a pubertal event. In order to assess which endocrine axis may be involved in the induction of silvering, we compared the profiles of pituitary and peripheral hormones during the transition from yellow to silver female <e>eels</e>. A strong activation of the gonadotropic axis was shown during silvering. Follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) mRNA levels increased during the early stages of silvering, followed by a later increase in luteinizing hormone (protein and mRNA) levels. In addition, plasma levels of sexual steroids (estradiol, E2; testosterone, T, and 11-ketotestosterone) and of vitellogenin significantly increased. In contrast, thyrotropin mRNA levels did not change and no or weak variations in plasma thyroid hormones were observed, indicating no or moderate change of the thyrotropic axis during silvering. Similarly, the somatotropic axis was not activated, as shown by pituitary growth hormone expression (protein and mRNA) and plasma levels. In addition, we studied the effects of chronic treatments of female yellow eels with thyroid hormone (thyroxine, T4) and sex steroids (T and E2) on biometrical parameters characteristics of silvering. T induced an increase in eye size and a reduction of digestive tract, whereas T4 and E2 had no effect. These hormonal profiles and experimental data lead to the conclusion that eel silvering should be considered as an onset of puberty rather than a 'genuine' metamorphosis.",M2
16677318,"Vibrio vulnificus serovar A: an emerging pathogen in European anguilliculture.The spread of the emerging pathogen Vibrio vulnificus biotype 2 serovar A in Danish anguilliculture is reported. Serovar A was originally isolated in a Spanish eel farm in 2000 and occurred in Denmark in the summer of 2004, affecting <e>eels</e> of 5-10 g body weight cultured in fresh water. The Danish eels showed clinical signs different from those reported for Spanish eels, such as severe haemorrhages in the head and gill region with necrosis of the soft tissues. Danish isolates were biochemically and serologically identical to Spanish serovar A strains and also highly virulent for eels by both intraperitoneal injection and immersion challenges. Vaccination with Vulnivaccine, a vaccine against V. vulnificus serovar E, cross-protected eels against serovar A.

16614067,"Vailulu'u Seamount, Samoa: Life and death on an active submarine volcano.Submersible exploration of the Samoan hotspot revealed a new, 300-m-tall, volcanic cone, named Nafanua, in the summit crater of Vailulu'u seamount. Nafanua grew from the 1,000-m-deep crater floor in &lt;4 years and could reach the sea surface within decades. Vents fill Vailulu'u crater with a thick suspension of particulates and apparently toxic fluids that mix with seawater entering from the crater breaches. Low-temperature vents form Fe oxide chimneys in many locations and up to 1-m-thick layers of hydrothermal Fe floc on Nafanua. High-temperature (81 degrees C) hydrothermal vents in the northern moat (945-m water depth) produce acidic fluids (pH 2.7) with rising droplets of (probably) liquid CO(2). The Nafanua summit vent area is inhabited by a thriving population of <e>eels</e> (Dysommina rugosa) that feed on midwater shrimp probably concentrated by anticyclonic currents at the volcano summit and rim. The moat and crater floor around the new volcano are littered with dead metazoans that apparently died from exposure to hydrothermal emissions. Acid-tolerant polychaetes (Polynoidae) live in this environment, apparently feeding on bacteria from decaying fish carcasses. Vailulu'u is an unpredictable and very active underwater volcano presenting a potential long-term volcanic hazard. Although eels thrive in hydrothermal vents at the summit of Nafanua, venting elsewhere in the crater causes mass mortality. Paradoxically, the same anticyclonic currents that deliver food to the eels may also concentrate a wide variety of nektonic animals in a death trap of toxic hydrothermal fluids.",M2
16595151,"Effects of hCG as spermiation inducer on European eel semen quality.Fish sperm quality has traditionally been estimated by subjective evaluation of motility and sperm concentration. Alternative methods for evaluation of sperm quality have been developed in the last decade and enable estimation of spermatozoa head morphometry, membrane integrity and mitochondrial function. Weekly injections of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) induced spermiation in farmed male European <e>eels</e>. The milt volume increased from the 5th to 12th weeks. Sperm concentration significantly increased from the 5th week, reaching the highest values at the 8th week, while best motility results were registered at the 9th week of treatment. Coinciding with these intervals, the percentage of dead spermatozoa determined with Hoechst staining showed a reduction in the 8th to 11th weeks of treatment, while the percentage of mitochondrial functionality determined by JC-1 staining did not show a similar pattern. The automatic sperm morphology analysis (ASMA) of the spermatozoa head length, width, area and perimeter showed a significant growth from the 5th to 8th weeks. However, the analysis of isolated descriptive parameters may be difficult to understand because there is a variability in these parameters for each week, making knowledge of the growth kinetic complex. The global size of the spermatozoa head was calculated by applying principal component analysis (PCA), because this method establishes new components that make the interpretation of results easier, allowing a whole interpretation of the changes in the cell morphology. PC1 defines the global head size and shows a significant increase between the 5th and 8th weeks of treatment, showing shorter changes until 12th week. PC2 shows a significant increase in the spermatozoa width from the 5th to 7th weeks. Considering the results of the variations in the principal components defining European eel spermatozoa morphometry, it may be concluded that hCG maturative treatment produced thick cells during the first weeks of spermiation, and subsequent samplings showed an increase in cell width and length. These changes in sperm morphometry coincide with the highest sperm quality assessed as sperm motility and concentration, as well as with the best results obtained in previous studies reporting the best sperm quality between weeks 8 and 10 of hCG treatment. These results support the use of ASMA and Hoechst staining techniques as alternative methods for the evaluation of fish sperm quality.",M2

Here we pinpoint a spawning location for Japanese eels after genetically identifying newly hatched larvae that we collected from the site. The restricted size of this spawning area ensures that the eel larvae enter a particular current that transports them to the freshwater areas in east Asia where they mature, and it also prevents them from being carried southwards away from their species range by a different local current.",M2
16457918,"Low levels of persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in New Zealand <e>eels</e> reflect isolation from atmospheric sources.Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and organic pesticides (i.e., DDTs) were measured in long finned eels (Anguilla dieffenbachii) in 17 streams on the west coast of South Island, New Zealand. Very low levels of PCBs and low levels of ppDDE were found. The concentrations of PCBs and ppDDE were not correlated within sites indicating that different processes determined the levels of the two pollutants in New Zealand eels. The PCBs probably originate from atmospheric transport, ppDDE levels are determined by land use and are higher in agriculture areas. The low contamination level of these aquatic systems seems to be a function of a low input from both long and short-range transport as well as few local point sources. No correlation could be found between lipid content and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) concentration (as shown in previous studies) in the eels which could be explained by low and irregular intake of the pollutants.",M2
16440794,"[Residues of total mercury and methyl mercury in eel products]Fifty-two samples of broiled <e>eels</e> and broiled eel liver were analyzed for total mercury (total Hg) and methyl mercury. The mean concentrations of total Hg in broiled eels and broiled eel liver were 0.21 ppm and 0.10 ppm, respectively. Meanwhile, the mean concentrations of methyl mercury in broiled eels and broiled eel liver were 0.085 ppm and 0.039 ppm, respectively. The rate of methyl mercury to total Hg mainly ranged from 60 to 80% in broiled eels and from 35 to 65% in broiled eel liver. The total Hg concentrations of 2 samples of broiled eels and one sample of broiled eel liver exceeded the provisional regulation limit (0.4 ppm) of total Hg in fish in Japan. In these samples, the rates of methyl mercury to total Hg were lower than 20%. The muscles and the skin of broiled eels were measured separately. The ratios of skin to muscle concentration of total Hg and methyl mercury were mainly in the range from 1/10 to 1/4. The mean intakes of total Hg from broiled eels and broiled eel liver per individual were 24.6 microg and 3.1 microg, respectively.

16413804,"Effects of high-pressure acclimatization on silver eel (Anguilla anguilla, L.) slow muscle contraction.As the spawning migration of the eel is supposed to correspond to a long swimming activity at depth, patterns of slow red muscle contraction have been investigated in European silver eel (Anguilla anguilla L.) exposed for 3 weeks to 10.1 MPa hydrostatic pressure. The results show that pressure-acclimated <e>eels</e> (male and female) show a three-fold decrease in maximum isometric stress of twitch and tetanic contractions while time to peak force, time from peak force to 90% relaxation and ratio of twitch tension to tetanic tension remain unchanged. The observed modifications in slow red muscle mechanical properties do not impede the spawning migration of the eel and are possibly partially compensated by an improvement in the efficiency of oxidative phosphorylation. Effects of changes in membrane fluidity are also discussed.",M2
16358704,"[Determination of oxolinic acid residues in baked and fresh <e>eels</e> by high performance liquid chromatography without derivatization]A method for rapid determination of oxolinic acid residues in baked eels and fresh eels by high performance liquid chromatography without derivatization was studied. The samples were triturated, and extracted with methylene dichloride. The extracted solutions were evaporated to dryness, and then was dissolved by using the mobil phase. The solutions were cleaned-up by partition with n-hexane before analysis. The components were analysed on a Nova-Pak C18 column (150 mm x 3.9 mm i.d., 5 microm), with methanol-diluted phosphoric acid (pH 2.5) (40:60, V/V) as the mobile phose at a flow rate of 0.8 mL/min and detected by a fluorescence detector at the excitation wavelength (lambdaex) 254 nm and the emission wavelength (lambdaem) 375 nm. The detection limit was 0.01 mg/kg (S/N = 3). The recoveries were over 80 %, and the relative standard deviations (RSDs) were less than 3.8%.",M2
16243325,"Integrative approach to osmoregulatory action of atrial natriuretic peptide in seawater <e>eels</e>.Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) reduces plasma Na+ concentration and promotes seawater (SW) adaptation in SW eels. However, little is known about the mechanisms for the hyponatremic effect of ANP. In order to evaluate the role of ANP in the whole-body Na+ homeostasis of marine teleost, we reviewed previous in vivo experiments using exogenously administered ANP and present additional experiments to assess the role of endogenous ANP in Na+ homeostasis in conscious SW eels. The Na+ influx and efflux rate across the body surfaces including the gills measured with isotopic 22Na were not altered by the hyponatremic dose (5 pmol kg-1 min-1) of ANP infusion in SW eels. ANP infusion also had no effect on renal Na+ excretion in SW eels. In contrast, ANP strongly inhibited drinking, and the inhibition was quantitatively correlated with the hyponatremic effect of ANP. Further, intestinal absorption of Na+ was inhibited by ANP as examined in situ using intestinal sac in conscious SW eels. The combined inhibitory actions of ANP on drinking and intestinal absorption were sufficient to explain the decrease in plasma Na+ concentration. In addition, removal of endogenous circulating ANP by immunoneutralization increased plasma Na+ concentration with a concomitant increase in drinking rate in SW eels. These results strongly suggest that endogenous ANP is involved in the hyponatremic regulation through actions on drinking, and probably on intestine, in SW eels.",M2
16188355,"Selective supercritical fluid extraction to identify aged sediment-bound PCBs available for uptake by eel.A naturally contaminated sediment was partially extracted with selective supercritical fluid extraction (SFE) to remove a fraction of supposedly bioavailable PCBs from the matrix. <e>Eels</e> (Anguilla anguilla) were cultured in systems with untreated and pre-extracted sediment, respectively, and it was shown that the SFE treatment selectively removed bioavailable PCBs from the sediment, since relative biota-to-sediment accumulation factors (BSAFs) for the eight studied PCB congeners were much lower in the pre-extracted than in the untreated system at the end of the study. Relative BSAF values decreased with about the same relative amount for all eight congeners, independent of the degree of chlorination and the initial concentration in the sediment. The results demonstrate the ability of SFE to selectively remove sediment-bound PCBs that are available for uptake by the eels, thus demonstrating the feasibility of using selective SFE to estimate bioavailability of PCBs in sediments.",M2
16185761,"Morphometry characterisation of European eel spermatozoa with computer-assisted spermatozoa analysis and scanning electron microscopy.The aim of the present study was to characterise European eel spermatozoa morphometrically, as a basis for future studies on the morphological effects of methods for sperm cryopreservation and sperm quality. This characterisation was carried out measuring several spermatozoa morphology parameters (head length, width, area and perimeter) by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), in comparison with measurements developed in European eel spermatozoa with computer-assisted morphology analysis (ASMA). Spermatozoa head morphology showed differences in width (1.15+/-0.01 microm versus 1.12+/-0.01 microm), perimeter (14.68+/-0.13 microm versus 13.72+/-0.19 microm) and area (5.36+/-0.06 microm2 versus 1.12+/-0.01 microm2) for ASMA and SEM, respectively. When head length was evaluated, significant differences were found, being higher for SEM methodology (5.09+/-0.04 microm versus 4.29+/-0.03 microm). The curved and elongated spermatozoa head in <e>eels</e> means a problem for the ASMA system (Sperm Class Analyser), Morfo Version 1.1, Imagesp, Barcelona, Spain), causing an error in the length measurements. However, similar results were obtained by both techniques when spermatozoa head length was considered as the greater length between two points within the object (4.29+/-0.03 microm versus 4.31+/-0.04 microm for ASMA and SEM, respectively). In conclusion, this is one of the first applications of ASMA in fish and the first in this species, and confirms this system as a useful tool with wide applications in future fish spermatozoa studies. Width, perimeter and area could be used as parameters for the spermatozoa morphology evaluation, whereas the length requires a new programming of the Imagesp software.",M2
16168415,"Changes in localization of cytochrome P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc) in Japanese eel testis and ovary during gonadal development.In this study, we generated and characterized a polyclonal antiserum against eel P450 cholesterol side-chain cleavage (P450scc) using a recombinant protein as the antigen. We examined the localization and abundance of P450scc by immunohistochemistry in Japanese eel testes and ovaries during artificially induced gonadal development. P450scc mRNA localization was also examined by in situ hybridization. In male <e>eels</e>, testicular development was induced by a single injection of human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG). In females, ovarian development was induced by weekly injections of salmon pituitary homogenate (SPH). Before HCG injection, the testis contained germ cells that were primarily type A spermatogonia. Additionally, several clusters of immunoreactive cells for P450scc were localized in the interstitial Leydig cells, but no P450scc mRNA signals were detected. This suggests that P450scc is either a relatively stable protein or it is produced by a mRNA that is present at too low a level to detect. Shortly after a single injection of HCG, expression of P450scc mRNA was stimulated and the number of immunoreactive clusters and their staining intensity were both increased. P450scc mRNA fell to an undetectable level 3 days after hormonal stimulation. Although the P450scc protein also decreased at the same time as the mRNA, it remained at a detectable level throughout this period. P450scc mRNA, but not the P450scc protein, was also detected in the spermatids and spermatozoa. The biological significance of P450scc mRNA expression at this stage is unknown. Prior to experimentation, the ovary contained oocytes that were developed to the oil-droplet stage, with several clusters of immunoreactive cells localized in the thecal layer and ovigerous lamella epithelium. Expression of P450scc mRNA was also stimulated by SPH injections in the ovary. In contrast to the testis, P450scc mRNA was continuously detected in the thecal cell layer throughout artificially induced maturation, possibly due to a repeated stimulus by the SPH injection every week. Clusters of immunoreactive cells in the thecal cell layer increased in number as ovarian development progressed. This increase in P450scc mRNA and protein may explain, at least in part, the increase in serum steroid hormones in female eels. The P450scc antiserum clearly immunostained interrenal steroidogenic cells in the head kidney of not only eel but also goldfish, indicating that this antibody could also be used in other teleost species.",M2
16154923,"Modeling of the migration of the European glass eel.The characteristics of glass eel migration at the mouth of river Bojana have been investigated by seasonal field studies from February to April 1998. Samples were collected by two fyke nets, one on each riverside, for 12 hours each night. A total of about 3,300 individuals were caught. In this work we present the results obtained from three successive migration waves in 1998. The data obtained on the number of <e>eels</e> caught during one migration wave, as a function of time, had two components: a bell-shaped curve, lasting 7-14 days, over which an impulse (sudden burst in the number of caught eels, during 1-2 days) was observed. We propose a mathematical model for total number of captured eels within one migration wave. Impulse components were observed during the first and second migration waves. After their removal, the remaining experimental data of the three migration waves were fitted with normal distribution functions. A decrease in the values of fitting parameters as a function of time (migration wave number) was obtained. Our data indicate multiple causes for the observed migration waves.",M2

The majority of L-horizontal cells (68 explored) had both rod and cone inputs, an uncommon phenomenon among teleosts. Pronounced color-opponent properties, often taken as pointing to the capacity of color vision, were identified in one amacrine cell, apparently of the  blue/yellow  (or  blue/green ) type. Microspectrophotometric measurements revealed two different spectral classes of cones with absorption maxima at about 525 and 434 nm. The existence of green-sensitive and blue-sensitive cone units was thus revealed by both electrophysiological and microspectrophotometric techniques.",M2
15965298,"The cytotoxin-hemolysin genes of human and eel pathogenic Vibrio vulnificus strains: comparison of nucleotide sequences and application to the genetic grouping.Vibrio vulnificus can be divided into two groups on the basis of pathogenesis. Group 1 is pathogenic only to humans, whereas group 2 is pathogenic to <e>eels</e> and occasionally to humans. Although both groups produce a 50-kDa cytotoxin-hemolysin (V. vulnificus hemolysin; VVH), the toxins are different. In the present study, the nucleotide sequence of the toxin gene (vvhA ) of strain CDC B3547 (a group 2 strain) was determined, and the deduced amino acid sequence was compared to that of strain L-180 (a group 1 strain). The nucleotide sequence of vvhA of strain CDC B3547 was about 96% identical with that of strain L-180, which results in a difference of 3 amino acid residues in the C-terminal lectin domain of VVH. Nevertheless, two primer sets for polymerase chain reaction could be designed to differentiate the toxin gene of each strain. When 27 V. vulnificus clinical isolates were tested, group 1 strains (9 strains) were shown to react only to the primers designed for vvhA of strain L-180; whereas, the gene of group 2 strains (18 strains) could be amplified with the primers for vvhA of strain CDC B3547. These findings may lead to development of a novel genetic grouping system related to the virulence potential or to the host range.",M2
15907873,"Pharmacokinetics of ciprofloxacin in <e>eels</e> by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection.The plasma kinetics of ciprofloxacin (CF) were investigated in the eels after administration by oral gavage and bath treatment. Plasma concentrations of CF were determined by high-performance liquid chromatography with fluorescence detection. The mean concentration time data after oral gavage of a single dose (10.0 mg/kg CF) and after bath treatment by exposure (10 microg/ml CF) to medicated water for 48 h were both best fitted by a one-compartment model. After oral gavage in eels, the half-time of absorption (T1/2Ka) was 0.10 h, the half-time of elimination (T1/2Ke) was 51.87 h, and the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) was 0.4552 microg/ml at Tmax 0.88 h.

15891071,"Effect of cortisol on aquaporin expression in the esophagus of the European eel, Anguilla anguilla.Long-term cortisol infusion into freshwater (FW)-adapted <e>eels</e> induced a significant increase in aquaporin-1 (AQP1) mRNA expression within the esophageal epithelium of migratory  silver  eels, but not in nonmigratory, immature  yellow  eels. Cortisol treatment had no significant effect on the mRNA abundance of a second aquaporin-1 isoform, termed AQP1dup, which exhibited a highly variable expression profile among individual members of all fish groups. These results suggest that cortisol, at plasma concentrations similar to that found during FW/seawater (SW) acclimation, induces upregulation in AQP1 expression and thus increases esophageal water permeability during the migration of eels to the SW environment.",M2

15887080,"High swimming and metabolic activity in the deep-sea eel Synaphobranchus kaupii revealed by integrated in situ and in vitro measurements.Several complementary studies were undertaken on a single species of deep-sea fish (the eel Synaphobranchus kaupii) within a small temporal and spatial range. In situ experiments on swimming and foraging behaviour, muscle performance, and metabolic rate were performed in the Porcupine Seabight, northeast Atlantic, alongside measurements of temperature and current regime. Deep-water trawling was used to collect <e>eels</e> for studies of animal distribution and for anatomical and biochemical analyses, including white muscle citrate synthase (CS), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), and pyruvate kinase (PK) activities. Synaphobranchus kaupii demonstrated whole-animal swimming speeds similar to those of other active deep-sea fish such as Antimora rostrata. Metabolic rates were an order of magnitude higher (31.6 mL kg(-1) h(-1)) than those recorded in other deep-sea scavenging fish. Activities of CS, LDH, MDH, and PK were higher than expected, and all scaled negatively with body mass, indicating a general decrease in muscle energy supply with fish growth. Despite this apparent constraint, observed in situ burst or routine swimming performances scaled in a similar fashion to other studied species. The higher-than-expected metabolic rates and activity levels, and the unusual scaling relationships of both aerobic and anaerobic metabolism enzymes in white muscle, probably reflect the changes in habitat and feeding ecology experienced during ontogeny in this bathyal species.",M2

Our model is based on the biological details of eels behaviour and constitutes a virtual laboratory, useful to test different hypotheses about eels migration.",M2
15802556,"Roles of Slc13a1 and Slc26a1 sulfate transporters of eel kidney in sulfate homeostasis and osmoregulation in freshwater.Sulfate is required for proper cell growth and development of all organisms. We have shown that the renal sulfate transport system has dual roles in euryhaline eel, namely, maintenance of sulfate homeostasis and osmoregulation of body fluids. To clarify the physiological roles of sulfate transporters in teleost fish, we cloned orthologs of the mammalian renal sulfate transporters Slc13a1 (NaSi-1) and Slc26a1 (Sat-1) from eel (Anguilla japonica) and assessed their functional characteristics, tissue localization, and regulated expression. Full-length cDNAs coding for ajSlc13a1 and ajSlc26a1 were isolated from a freshwater eel kidney cDNA library. Functional expression in Xenopus oocytes revealed the expected sulfate transport characteristics; furthermore, both transporters were inhibited by mercuric chloride. Northern blot analysis, in situ hybridization, and immunohistochemistry demonstrated robust apical and basolateral expression of ajSlc13a1 and ajSlc26a1, respectively, within the proximal tubule of freshwater eel kidney. Expression was dramatically reduced after the transfer of <e>eels</e> from freshwater to seawater; the circulating sulfate concentration in eels was in turn markedly elevated in freshwater compared with seawater conditions (19 mM vs. 1 mM). The reabsorption of sulfate via the apical ajSlc13a1 and basolateral ajSlc26a1 transporters may thus contribute to freshwater osmoregulation in euryhaline eels, via the regulation of circulating sulfate concentration.",M2
15792628,"Hematology patterns of migrating European <e>eels</e> and the role of EVEX virus.We show that European eels infected with the rhabdovirus EVEX (Eel Virus European X) virus, developed hemorrhage and anemia during simulated migration in large swim tunnels, and died after 1000-1500 km. In contrast, virus-negative animals swam 5500 km, the estimated distance to the spawning ground of the European eel in the Sargasso Sea. Virus-positive eels showed a decline in hematocrit, which was related to the swim distance. Virus-negative eels showed a slightly increased hematocrit. Observed changes in plasma lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), total protein and aspartate aminotransferase (AAT) are indicative of a serious viral infection. Based on these observations, we conclude that eel virus infections may adversely affect the spawning migration of eels, and could be a contributing factor to the worldwide decline of eel.",M2
15736222,"Cloning of cDNAs and the differential expression of A-type cyclins and Dmc1 during spermatogenesis in the Japanese eel, a teleost fish.We cloned A-type cyclins (cyclins A1 and A2) and Dmc1 cDNAs from the eel testis. Cyclin A1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the livers, ovaries, and testes of the <e>eels</e>. In contrast to cyclin A1 mRNA, a very high expression of cyclin A2 mRNA was observed in the brains, livers, kidneys, spleens, ovaries, and testes of the eels. Dmc1 mRNA was predominantly expressed in the testes and ovaries; expression in the brain was also detected. In the eel testis, a few type-A spermatogonia incorporating 5-bromo-2'-deoxyuridine (BrdU) were seen before the initiation of spermatogenesis by hormonal induction. On day 1 after hormonal induction, the number of BrdU-labeled spermatogonia increased remarkably, and after 3 and 6 days, many labeled type-B spermatogonia were also observed. The expression of cyclin A2 increased 1 day after the induction of spermatogenesis and reached a plateau after 6 days, when many type-B spermatogonia with high proliferative activity were found. In contrast, the expression of cyclin A1 mRNA was detected after 9 days, coincident with the first appearance of spermatocytes. Cyclin A1 mRNA was localized in germ cells of all stages, from primary spermatocytes to round spermatids, whereas cyclin A2 mRNA was specifically localized in spermatogonia, secondary spermatocytes, round spermatids, and testicular somatic cells, including Sertoli cells. Dmc1 was localized only in the earlier stages of primary spermatocytes; before this stage, cyclin A1 mRNA was not detectable. Overall, cyclin A2, Dmc1, and cyclin A1 are expressed in spermatogenic cells sequentially before and during meiosis in the eel testis.",M2

15705539,"Is the silvering process similar to the effects of pressure acclimatization on yellow <e>eels</e>?To reproduce eels need to migrate over 6000 km and at pressure but before this migration they metamorphose into silver eels (silvering). The question raised in this study is to determine whether and how the silvering process contributes to pressure resistance. As migration represents a long swimming activity mainly performed with slow muscles, the red muscle energetics of pressure exposed silver eels was studied. By comparing these results to what has already been shown in yellow eels, we point out that the effects of the silvering process on pressure resistance are similar to the effects of pressure acclimatization in yellow eels. As previously shown, success of pressure acclimatization depends on membrane fluidity, but we raise the hypothesis that the high-pressure resistance of silver eels is due to more fluid membranes.",M2
15689060,"Gnathostoma infection in fish caught for local consumption in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand I. Prevalence and fish species.Between August 2000 and August 2001, 12,216 fish of 73 species were purchased from several local markets in Nakhon Nayok Province, Thailand, and examined for the presence of Gnathostoma larvae. Almost all species were fresh-water fish that had grown naturally, rather than raised commercially. Eight species were found to be infected with gnathostome larvae. The overall prevalence was 5.1% (626/12,216) and a total of 5,969 larvae was recovered. The highest rate of infection (30.1 %) was found in Monopterus albus (swamp eel). The rates in the remaining infected fish were as follows: Anabas testudineus (climbing perch) 7.7%, Channa striata (striped snake-head fish) 7.4%, Clarius macrocephalus (Gunther's walking catfish) 6.7%, Channa micropeltes (giant snake-head fish) 5.1%, Channa lucius (blotched snake-head fish) 4.0%, Clarius batrachus (Batrachian walking catfish) 1.4%, and Ompok krattensis (butter sheatfish) 0.6%. The mean number of larvae/fish was highest in swamp <e>eels</e> (10.0 larvae/eel), and the maximum number of 698 larvae was recovered from one eel.

The average number of cephalic hooklets of the larvae from rows 1 to 4 were 41.8+/-0.5 (range, 40-43), 43.6+/-0.6 (range, 42-45), 46.1+/-0.9 (range, 44-48) and 49.3+/-0.7 (range, 48-51), respectively.",M2
15650119,"Regulation of expression of two aquaporin homologs in the intestine of the European eel: effects of seawater acclimation and cortisol treatment.Complementary DNAs encoding homologs of the mammalian aquaglyceroporins (termed AQPe) and aquaporin-1 isoforms (termed AQP1) were isolated from the European eel. The AQP amino acid sequences share 35-54% identity with other known human AQPs. Although AQPe mRNA expression was approximately equivalent along the entire length of the gut, AQP1 expression was the highest in the posterior/rectal segment. Seawater (SW) acclimation increased AQP1 mRNA abundance by 5- and 17-fold in the anterior, 14- and 23-fold in the mid-, and 9- and 7-fold in the posterior/rectal gut regions of yellow and silver <e>eels</e>, respectively. SW acclimation had an effect on AQPe mRNA expression only in the midintestine of silver eels, where a small but significant 1.7-fold increase in abundance was measured. Western blots using an eel AQP1-specific antibody identified the presence of a major immunoreactive 28-kDa protein, primarily within the posterior/rectal segment. A 3-wk SW transfer induced an increase in AQP1 protein abundance in all intestinal segments, with the posterior/rectal region still expressing protein levels approximately 40- and 8-fold higher than the anterior and midsegments, respectively. Strong AQP1 immunofluorescence was detected within the vascular endothelium in both freshwater (FW)- and SW-acclimated eels and in the epithelial apical brush border in the posterior/rectal gut regions of SW-acclimated eels. Cortisol infusion into FW eels had no effect on intestinal AQPe mRNA expression but induced increases in AQP1 mRNA and protein levels. These results provide evidence for the presence of a SW-induced and steroid-regulated AQP water channel pathway within the intestine of the European eel.",M2
15574896,"Protocol for specific isolation of virulent strains of Vibrio vulnificus serovar E (biotype 2) from environmental samples.The eel pathogen Vibrio vulnificus biotype 2 comprises at least three serovars, with serovar E being the only one involved in both epizootics of eel vibriosis and sporadic cases of human infections. The virulent strains of this serovar (VSE) have only been recovered from clinical (mainly eel tissue) sources. The main objective of this work was to design and validate a new protocol for VSE-specific isolation from environmental samples. The key element of the new protocol is the broth used for the first step (saline eel serum broth [SEB]), which contains eel serum as a nutritive and selective component. This approach takes advantage of the ability of VSE cells to grow in eel serum and thus to separate themselves from the pool of competitors. The growth yield in SEB after 8 h of incubation was 1,000 times higher for VSE strains than for their putative competitors (including biotype 1 strains of the species). The selective and differential agar Vibrio vulnificus medium (VVM) was selected from five selective media for the second step because it gave the highest plating efficiency not only for the VSE group but also for other V. vulnificus groups, including biotype 3. The entire protocol was validated by field studies, with alkaline peptone water plus VVM as a control. V. vulnificus was isolated by both protocols, but serovar E was only recovered by the new method described here. All selected serovar E isolates were identified as VSE since they were virulent for both <e>eels</e> and iron-overloaded mice and resisted the bactericidal action of eel and iron-overloaded human sera. In conclusion, this new protocol is a suitable method for the isolation of VSE strains from environmental samples and is recommended for epidemiological studies of the pathogenic serovar E.",M2

Overall prevalence of the parasite was 86% and the mean abundance was 53 worms per fish. Despite the presence of large numbers of worms in the trout very few females (2%) attained full reproductive maturity. This suggests that trout is an accidental host. A sample of yellow <e>eels</e>, Anguilla anguilla was examined at a different time from the same lake. The prevalence of A. clavula was 97% and the average abundance was 8 worms per fish.

Outer membrane fractions of these strains contained a predominant 53- to 54-kDa protein which was glycine extractable under low-pH (pH 2.8) conditions and was identified as the surface array protein. The S-layer proteins of the O:14 and O:81 A. hydrophila strains seemed to be primarily different from those previously purified from strains A. hydrophila TF7 and Aeromonas salmonicida A450 on the basis of colony hybridizations with both the structural genes vapA and ahsA.

15366851,"Applying DNA techniques to the identification of the species of dressed toasted eel products.To differentiate the species of processed eel products, the gene identification of four fresh eel species was first established and the species of eel products collected from markets were investigated. Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) and sequence analysis were used to determine the genetic variation in a 362-nucleotide region of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene in four fresh <e>eels</e> including Anguilla japonica, Anguilla anguilla, Anguilla rostrata, and Muraenesox cinereus. It was found that each eel species had a unique genotype, which was no different among fresh, frozen, and sterilized meats. The restriction enzyme HinfI could differentiate the species of A. japonica and A. rostrata but could not differentiate A. anguilla and M. cinereus. Another restriction enzyme, Sau96 I, was valuable in the differentiation of M. cinereus from the other three species of Anguilla. By applying PCR and restriction enzymes, the species of 12 commercial eel products were identified as A. japonica (9 samples), A. anguilla (2), and A. rostrata (1). This indicated that the sequence and restriction enzyme cutting site analyses were very usable to authenticate species of different processed eel products.",M2
15284080,"FHL5, a novel actin-binding protein, is highly expressed in eel gill pillar cells and responds to wall tension.Supporting evidence for the contractile nature of fish branchial pillar cells was provided by demonstrating the presence of actin fibers and a novel four-and-a-half LIM (FHL) protein in which expression is specific for contractile tissues and sensitive to the tension applied to the pillar cell. When eel gill sections were stained with rhodamine-phalloidin, a selective fluorescent probe for fibrous actin, a strong bundle-like staining was observed around collagen columns in pillar cells, suggesting the presence of abundant actin fibers. A cDNA clone encoding a novel member of the actin-binding FHL family, FHL5, was isolated from a subtracted cDNA library of eel gill. Northern analysis revealed that FHL5 mRNA is highly expressed only in gills, heart, and skeletal muscle. In gills, FHL5 was found to be confined to pillar cells by immunohistochemistry. Confocal fluorescence microscopy showed that FHL5 is present in both cytosol and nucleus; within the cytosol, a large portion of FHL5 is colocalized with the phalloidin-positive actin bundles. Furthermore, transfection of myogenic C2C12 cells with FHL5 cDNA demonstrated, in addition to its interaction with actin stress fibers, a nuclear shuttling activity of FHL5. The mRNA and protein levels were found to be elevated on 1) transfer of <e>eels</e> from seawater to freshwater, 2) volume expansion by infusion of isotonic dextran-saline, and 3) constriction of gill vasculature by bolus injection of endothelin-1. These results suggest contractile nature of pillar cells and a role of FHL5 in maintaining the integrity and regulating the dynamics of pillar cells.",M2
15229141,"Dopamine inhibits luteinizing hormone synthesis and release in the juvenile European eel: a neuroendocrine lock for the onset of puberty.In various adult teleost fishes, LH ovulatory peak is under a dual neurohormonal control that is stimulatory by GnRH and inhibitory by dopamine (DA). We investigated whether DA could also be involved in the inhibitory control of LH at earlier steps of gametogenesis by studying the model of the European eel, Anguilla anguilla, which remains at a prepubertal stage until the oceanic reproductive migration. According to a protocol previously developed in the striped bass, <e>eels</e> received sustained treatments with GnRH agonist (GnRHa), DA-receptor antagonist (pimozide), and testosterone (T) either alone or in combination. Only the triple treatment with T, GnRHa, and pimozide could trigger dramatic increases in LH synthesis and release as well as in plasma vitellogenin levels and a stimulation of ovarian vitellogenesis. Thus, in the prepubertal eel, removal of DA inhibition is required for triggering GnRH-stimulated LH synthesis and release as well as ovarian development. To locate the anatomical support for DA inhibition, the distribution of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the brain and pituitary was studied by immunocytochemistry. Numerous TH-immunoreactive cell bodies were observed in the preoptic anteroventral nucleus, with a dense tract of immunoreactive fibers reaching the pituitary proximal pars distalis, where the gonadotrophs are located. This pathway corresponds to that mediating the inhibition of LH and ovulation in adult teleosts. To our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a pivotal role for DA in the control of LH and puberty in a juvenile teleost. These data support the view that DA inhibition on LH secretion is an ancient evolutionary component in the neuroendocrine regulation of reproduction that may have been partially maintained throughout vertebrate evolution.",M2

14755171,"A taxonomic study of species of Bothriocephalus Rudolphi, 1808 (Cestoda: Pseudophyllidea) from <e>eels</e> in Japan: morphological and molecular evidence for the occurrence of B. claviceps (Goeze, 1782) and confirmation of the validity of B. Japonicus Yamaguti, 1934.A taxonomic study of specimens of Bothriocephalus from eels ( Anguilla spp.) in Japan has demonstrated the occurrence of two species, B. claviceps (Goeze, 1782) and B. japonicus Yamaguti, 1934. The former species is a parasite of eels ( A. anguilla and A. rostrata ) in the Holarctic Region and was recently reported from A. marmorata in Japan. The conspecificity of tapeworms newly found in an eel ( A. ? japonica ) from Lake Biwa, central Japan, with B. claviceps has been confirmed by the great similarity of their ITS-2 gene sequences (similarity 95.3% and 95.2%). However, the sequences of worms identified as B. claviceps from A. marmorata differed considerably from those of B. claviceps from two populations of A. anguilla from Europe and the above-mentioned one from Japan (similarity 66.3%, 67.1% and 65.1 %, respectively), thus indicating that the former cestodes may have been misidentified. This assumption was confirmed by morphological evaluation of a voucher specimen from A. marmorata. The morphology of this cestode, as well as those from A. japonica from two localities in Japan (Lakes Biwa and Suwa), indicates their conspecificity with B. japonicus. The validity of this taxon has been confirmed on the basis of a re-examination of the type-specimens. The two taxa, B. japonicus and B. claviceps, differ from each other in the shape and length of the scolex (619-730 microm in B. japonicus versus 1,180-2,100 microm in B. claviceps ), the relative position of the cirro-vaginal and uterine pores (opposite each other in relation to the median line of the body in B. japonicus versus tandem or slightly offset along the median line in the latter species), and the size of the eggs (41-52 x 28-35 microm in B. japonicus versus 50-70 x 31-43 microm in B. claviceps ).",M2
14710926,"Determination of VOCs in yellow eel from various inland water bodies in Flanders (Belgium).Twenty freshwater <e>eels</e> caught in Flanders (Belgium) were analysed by GC-MS for a total of 52 VOCs. The most prominent VOCs are the BTEX and a number of chlorinated compounds such as chloroform and tetrachloroethene. The observed concentrations which, typically, were in the low ng/g wet weight range, could be linked to the major emission sources and the present study gives new evidence that combustion of fossil fuels is a major source of BTEX in the environment. The concentration levels in eels seem to be a reflection of the actual concentrations in their environment. For eels from the same location similar patterns and concentrations were observed, and the concentrations agree with what can be expected from those of the water column. Generally speaking, the observed concentrations do not seem to pose a threat for organisms. More definite statements will, however, require a larger dataset. The study suggests that the yellow eel can possibly be used as a biomonitor or sentinel organism for VOCs.",M2

14662289,"Water metabolism in the eel acclimated to sea water: from mouth to intestine.<e>Eels</e> seem to be a suitable model system for analysing regulatory mechanisms of drinking behavior in vertebrates, since most dipsogens and antidipsogens in mammals influence the drinking rate in the seawater eels similarly. The drinking behavior in fishes consists of swallowing alone, since they live in water and water is constantly held in the mouth for respiration. Therefore, contraction of the upper esophageal sphincter (UES) muscle limits the drinking rate in fishes. The UES of the eel was innervated by the glossopharyngeal-vagal motor complex (GVC) in the medulla oblongata (MO). The GVC neurons were immunoreactive to an antibody raised against choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), an acetylcholine (ACh) synthesizing enzyme, indicating that the eel UES muscle is controlled cholinergically by the GVC. The neuronal activity of the GVC was inhibited by adrenaline or dopamine, suggesting catecholaminergic innervation to the GVC. The AP and the commissural nucleus of Cajal (NCC) in the MO projected to the GVC and were immunoreactive to an antibody raised against tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), rate limiting enzyme to produce catecholamines from tyrosine. Therefore, it is likely that activation in the AP or the NCC may inhibit the GVC and thus relaxes the UES muscle, which allows for water to enter into the esophagus. During passing through the esophagus, the imbibed sea water (SW) was desalted to approximately 1/2 SW, which was further diluted in the stomach and arrived at the intestine as approximately 1/3 SW, almost isotonic to the plasma. Finally, from the diluted SW, the eel intestine absorbed water following the Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransport (NKCC2) system. The NaCl and water absorption across the intestine was regulated by various factors, especially by peptides such as atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and somatostatin (SS-25 II). During desalination in the esophagus, however, excess salt enters into the blood circulation, which is liable to raise the plasma osmolarity. However, the eel heart was constricted powerfully by the hyperosmolarity, suggesting that the hyperosmolarity enhances the stroke volume to the gill, where excess salt was extruded powerfully via Na(+)-K(+)-2Cl(-) cotransport (NKCC1) system.",M2
14643697,"Safety of azamethiphos in eel, seabass and trout.The safety of azamethiphos (AZA), an organophosphorous insecticide and the active ingredient of Salmosan, was evaluated in the European eel, seabass and rainbow trout. Fish were bathed in 0.1 ppm AZA for a period of 60, 120 or 240 min. After termination of each treatment fish were transferred to clean aquaria and randomly sampled over 21 days. Compared to controls, brain acetylcholinesterase (AChE) was inhibited up to 44, 56 and 62% in <e>eels</e>, seabass and trout, respectively, with the inhibition being significant for up to 4 days in eels and seabass and 7 days in trout. As result of the AChE depression, fish displayed motor hyperactivity and erratic jumping at the onset of treatment. Mortality was observed only in trout following exposure for 240 min. A variable correlation observed among species between the level of exposure, the reduced activity of brain AChE and the signs of toxicity suggest that brain AChE should be considered as an indicator of exposure rather than as an index of toxicity of AZA. The present data indicate that at the therapeutic dosage of 0.1 ppm AZA for 1h can be safely used in eels, seabass and trout. The extended treatment times up to 240 min were equally safe for eels and seabass but not for trout.",M2

14526469,"Isolation of Vibrio vulnificus and atypical Vibrio from surface water of the Baltic Sea in Germany.From 1995 to 1997 several defined species like V. alginolyticus, V. anguillarum, V. cholerae (non O1 and non O139), V. mimicus, V. parahaemolyticus and V. vulnificus were isolated during a survey to determine the presence of V. vulnificus in the brackish water of the Baltic Sea in Germany. Moreover atypical Vibrio isolates were detected. Four isolates belonging to a group of atypical Vibrio and possibly representing a new species in the genus Vibrio were characterized in detail. All four strains were isolated from surface costal waters. Based on 16S rDNA sequence analysis they showed the highest relatedness to the species V. navarrensis and V. vulnificus. The strains did not harbor the species specific hemolysin gene vvhA from V. vulnificus as shown by PCR and hybridization experiments. Moreover, they differed in at least two biochemical parameters tested from the hitherto described Vibrio species. All these strains induced hemolysis on washed blood agar dishes and showed phase variations on Luria Bertani agar dishes. Because of the similarity to the eel pathogen V. vulnificus, we infected <e>eels</e> with one of the four atypical strains (CH-291), but no pathogenicity for eels could be detected. Furthermore, Vero cell tests with supernatants of bacterial cultures did not reveal secreted Vero cell cytotoxic compounds. This indicates a nonpathogenic nature of these strains.",M2
14519100,"Interrenal steroid 21-hydroxylase in <e>eels</e>: primary structure, progesterone-specific activity and enhanced expression by ACTH.Cytochrome P450 21-hydroxylase (P450c21) is a key enzyme for corticosteroidogenesis. To understand the regulatory mechanisms of cortisol production in fish, we have cloned a cDNA encoding P450c21, for the first time in non-mammalian vertebrates, from the head kidney of the eel (Anguilla japonica). The overall similarity of the deduced P450c21 sequence was modest (41-44% amino acid identity) between the eel and mammals. However, the functional domains for steroid-binding, heme-binding and proton-transfer sites were well conserved (74-100% identity). The eel P450c21 mRNA was expressed abundantly in the anterior quarter of the head kidney, but was undetectable in the remaining three-quarters or in other tissues including the gill, heart, liver, intestine, kidney, immature gonad and skeletal muscle. Functional expression of the cDNA clone in non-steroidogenic COS-1 cells produced a protein with high 21-hydroxylase activity to convert progesterone to 11-deoxycortisterone but not 17alpha-hydroxyprogesterone to 11-deoxycortisol, although the latter is a preferred substrate for mammalian P450c21. To examine whether 21-hydroxylated progesterone is actually 17alpha-hydroxylated in the eel interrenal, 11-deoxycorticosterone and (3)H-corticosterone were respectively incubated with the interrenal-containing anterior quarter of the head kidney. The separation of the steroids produced by two HPLC systems revealed that cortisol was produced from both substrates, showing the 17alpha-hydroxylation of 11-deoxycorticosterone and corticosterone in the eel interrenal. ACTH infused at 3 pmol/kg per min for 5 h consistently increased plasma cortisol levels and interrenal P450c21 mRNA levels in seawater eels. These results showed that the interrenal-specific eel P450c21 cloned in this study is involved in cortisol production through conversion of progesterone to 11-deoxycorticosterone in the interrenal-containing anterior quarter of eel head kidney. Furthermore, ACTH stimulates cortisol production in part through enhanced P450c21 expression in the eel interrenal.",M2
13130026,"Taxonomic study of sucrose-positive Aeromonas jandaei-like isolates from faeces, water and <e>eels</e>: emendation of A. jandaei Carnahan et al. 1992.Fourteen sucrose-positive Aeromonas jandaei-like isolates from fresh water and reared European eels were subjected to a polyphasic study to determine their taxonomic position. Numerical taxonomy was used to analyse phenotypic data obtained for these isolates and 43 type and reference strains representative of recognized Aeromonas species. The A. jandaei cluster (phenon 1) was defined at 81.6 % similarity (S(J)); this included the A. jandaei-like isolates, the sucrose-positive strain Aeromonas veronii biogroup sobria CECT 4910 and nearly all A. jandaei reference strains used in the study. Four other reference strains of A. veronii biogroup sobria and the type strain of Aeromonas ichthiosmia were peripheral to the A. jandaei cluster. The supra-group 'A. jandaei-A.veronii biogroup sobria-A. ichthiosmia' was linked at 80.7 % similarity (S(J)) and was clearly segregated from the phenotypic core of the A. veronii biogroup sobria species, which was related to the reference strain Popoff 224 (CECT 4835). DNA relatedness between strains grouped in the A. jandaei cluster (phenon 1) and A. jandaei CECT 4228(T) ranged from 70 to 100 %, but was below 50 % when DNAs from A. veronii biogroup sobria CECT 4835, A. veronii biogroup veronii CECT 4257(T) and A. ichthiosmia CECT 4486(T) were used. In addition, DNA relatedness between peripheral A. veronii biogroup sobria strains and the species A. jandaei (CECT 4228(T)), A. veronii (CECT 4257(T), CECT 4835) and A. ichthiosmia (CECT 4486(T)) was always below 54 %, as it was between the species A. ichthiosmia (CECT 4486(T)) and A. veronii (CECT 4257(T), CECT 4835). Emendation of A. jandaei is proposed; this taxon now includes sucrose-positive clinical and environmental strains as well as environmental isolates that are pathogenic for fish and humans. Other new traits for this species are the ability to grow at 4-42 degrees C, acid production from glycerol but not from lactose, D-melibiose or D-raffinose, the use of D-gluconate, L-glutamate or L-proline but not L-lactate, L-alanine, L-arabinose or L-arginine, hydrolytic activity against casein, elastin, starch and lecithin and the inability to lyse arbutin. The DNA G+C content of A. jandaei is also reported for the first time; it ranges from 58.1 to 61.1 mol%. On the other hand, the DNA relatedness data support the classification of peripheral reference strains of A. veronii biogroup sobria outside this taxon, indicating that biogroup sobria requires further revision.",M2
