20044879,"Chiral effects in adrenocorticolytic action of o,p'-<e>DDD</e> (mitotane) in human adrenal cells.Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare malignant disease with poor prognosis. The main pharmacological choice, o,p'-DDD (mitotane), produces severe adverse effects. Since o,p'-DDD is a chiral molecule and stereoisomers frequently possess different pharmacokinetic and/or pharmacodynamic properties, we isolated the two o,p'-DDD enantiomers, (R)-(+)-o,p'-DDD and (S)-(-)-o,p'-DDD, and determined their absolute structures. The effects of each enantiomer on cell viability and on cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) secretion in the human adrenocortical cell line H295R were assessed. We also assayed the o,p'-DDD racemate and the m,p'- and p,p'-isomers. The results show small but statistically significant differences in activity of the o,p'-DDD enantiomers for all parameters tested. The three DDD isomers were equally potent in decreasing cell viability, but p,p'-DDD affected hormone secretion slightly less than the o,p'- and m,p'-isomers. The small chiral differences in direct effects on target cells alone do not warrant single enantiomer administration, but might reach importance in conjunction with possible stereochemical effects on pharmacokinetic processes in vivo.",M1
19394667,"Interindividual differences in o,p'-<e>DDD</e> enantiomer kinetics examined in GÃ¶ttingen minipigs.Five minipigs were given a single oral dose of a racemic mixture of o,p'-DDD (30 mg kg(-1)b.w., EF=0.49). Blood plasma and subcutaneous adipose tissue were collected for analysis, at different time-points over 180 d. At the end of the experiment also liver, kidney and brain tissue were collected. Low concentrations of o,p'-DDD still remained after 180 d in plasma (mean 0.5+/-0.3 ng g(-1)f.w.) and in adipose tissue (mean 40+/-40 ng g(-1)f.w.). The mean concentrations in liver and kidney were 500+/-300 pg g(-1)f.w. and 90+/-50 pg g(-1)f.w., respectively. The enantiomers of o,p'-DDD were isolated by HPLC and the absolute configuration of the enantiomers were determined by X-ray crystallography and polarimetry as R-(+)-o,p'-DDD and S-(-)-o,p'-DDD. The enantiomer fractions (EFs) of o,p'-DDD were determined in plasma, adipose tissue and kidney using GC/ECD equipped with a chiral column. The EFs of o,p'-DDD in the individual minipigs showed large variability, ranging from 0.2 to 0.6 after 24h in plasma and from 0.2 to 0.7 after 90 d in adipose tissue. Hence in two of the minipigs, the S-(-)-o,p'-DDD enantiomer was dominating while the other enantiomer, R-(+)-o,p'-DDD was dominating in three minipigs. We propose that a yet not identified factor related to polymorphism, regulating the metabolism and/or elimination of the enantiomeric o,p'-DDD, is responsible for the differences in enantiomeric retention of the compound in the minipigs.",M1
18509009,"Mitotane increases the radiotherapy inhibitory effect and induces G2-arrest in combined treatment on both H295R and SW13 adrenocortical cell lines.Mitotane, 1,1-dichloro-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) is an agent with adrenotoxic effect, which is able to block cortisol synthesis. This drug and radiotherapy are used also in adrenal cancer treatment even if their biological action in this neoplasia remains unknown. We investigated the effects of o,p'-DDD and ionizing radiations (IR) on cell growth inhibition and cell cycle perturbation in H295R and SW13 adrenocortical cancer cells. Both cell lines were irradiated at a 6 Gy dose and were treated with o,p'-DDD 10(-5) M separately and with IR/o,p'-DDD in combination. This combination treatment induced an irreversible inhibition of cell growth in both adrenocortical cancer cells. Cell cycle analysis showed that IR alone and IR/o,p'-DDD in combination induced the cell accumulation in the G2 phase. At 120 h after IR, the cells were able to recover the IR-induced G2 block while cells treated with IR/o,p'-DDD were still arrested in G2 phase. In order to study the molecular mechanism involved in the G2 irreversible arrest, we have considered the H295R cell line showing the highest inhibition of cell proliferation associated with a noteworthy G2 arrest. In these cells, cyclin B1 and Cdk2 proteins were examined by western blot and Cdk2 kinase activity measured by assay kit. The H295R cells treated with IR/o,p'-DDD shared an increase in cyclin B1 amount as the coimmunoprecipitation of Cdc2-cyclin B1 complex. The kinase activity also shows an increase in the treated cells with combination therapy. Moreover, in these cells, sequence analysis of p53 revealed a large deletion of exons 8 and 9. The same irreversible block on G2 phase, induced by IR/o,p'-DDD treatment, happened in H295R cells with restored wild-type p53 suggesting that this mechanism is not mediated by p53 pathway.",M1
18310271,"Modulation of proteomic profile in H295R adrenocortical cell line induced by mitotane.Mitotane, 1,1-dichloro-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chloro-phenyl) ethane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>), is a compound that represents the effective agent in the treatment of the adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), able to block cortisol synthesis. In this type of cancer, the biological mechanism induced by this treatment remains still unknown. In this study, we have already shown a greater impairment in the first steps of the steroidogenesis and recognized a little effect on cell cycle. We also evaluated the variation of proteomic profile of the H295R ACC cell line, either in total cell extract or in mitochondria-enriched fraction after treatment with mitotane. In total cell extracts, triose phosphate isomerase, alpha-enolase, D-3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase, peroxiredoxin II and VI, heat shock protein 27, prohibitin, histidine triad nucleotide-binding protein, and profilin-1 showed a different expression. In the mitochondrial fraction, the following proteins appeared to be down regulated: aldolase A, peroxiredoxin I, heterogenous nuclear ribonucleoprotein A2/B1, tubulin-beta isoform II, heat shock cognate 71 kDa protein, and nucleotide diphosphate kinase, whereas adrenodoxin reductase, cathepsin D, and heat shock 70 kDa protein 1A were positively up-regulated. This study represents the first proteomic study on the mitotane effects on ACC. It permits to identify some protein classes affected by the drug involved in energetic metabolism, stress response, cytoskeleton structure, and tumorigenesis.",M1
18030749,"Effect of o,p'-<e>DDD</e> and Li+ on apoptotic DNA fragmentation in conventionally normal and tumour tissues of human adrenal cortex.The actions of 1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane (o,p'-DDD), potassium and lithium ions upon apoptotic processes in conventionally normal and tumour tissues of human adrenal cortex were studied. There was no effect of K+ on the apoptosis in tumour tissue. o,p'-DDD--the specific drug for conservative therapy of adrenocortical cancer--enhanced the apoptotic DNA fragmentation in all tested tissues. The conclusion was made that apoptosis may be involved in curative effect of o,p'-DDD in adrenal cortex. Lithium ions, which are used in clinic as antidepressant, inhibited the apoptosis in conventionally normal tissue and in most tumours. On the other hand, lithium enhanced the DNA fragmentation in the postoperative tissue of patients with Cushing disease. The possible mechanisms mediating lithium effects on the adrenal cortex are discussed.",M1
17649795,"Cortisol as a possible marker of metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma: a case report with 3-year follow-up.BACKGROUND: Adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC) is a rare tumour, sometimes causing glucocorticoid hypersecretion. Treatment guidelines have not been established, but are currently under investigation. CASE REPORT: A 55-year-old Caucasian woman presented with adrenal Cushing's disease. Histological examination after a left adrenalectomy revealed a benign tumour. Postoperatively, elevated serum cortisol levels normalized. Hypercortisolism occurred again two years later. Diagnostic work-up revealed hepatic metastatic lesions of an ACC which were treated by right hemihepatectomy. Initial histological diagnosis was revised according to the increased proliferative changes. Postoperatively, cortisol declined to normal levels. Treatment with mitotane (o, p'-<e>DDD</e>) as a cytostatic agent was not tolerated. One year later, the patient was diagnosed with a solitary osseous metastasis at the left side of the sacrum because of back pain. Following curettage and stabilization, radiotherapy of this region with 37.5 Gy was performed, improving slightly elevated cortisol levels and neurological symptoms. CONCLUSION: Careful clinical and radiographic follow-up of patients with ACC are important. In this case of oligometastasizing ACC, serum cortisol values correlated with the clinical course. An aggressive multimodal treatment, including repeated surgical approach with consolidating radiotherapy in cases of incomplete resection, might be indicated to provide symptom control and possible long-term survival in oligometastatic disease of ACC.",M1
17542193,"Medical management of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism: mitotane versus trilostane.Pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism is a common endocrine disorder in dogs in the United States. Once a diagnosis is established, a decision must be made whether or not to pursue treatment, and if so, which medication to use. Historically, mitotane (Lysodren, o,p'-<e>DDD</e>, Bristol-Myers Squibb, New York) has been the most commonly used treatment for medical management. Its use is complicated and comes with many potential side effects, making many practitioners wary of its use. Recently, trilostane has been proven to be an effective treatment of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism and is approved for use in other countries. Treatment with trilostane is somewhat simpler and the incidence of side effects seems to be less when compared with mitotane therapy. Either treatment can be a safe and effective method of treatment for pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism when the practitioner and client are well educated regarding their use and an appropriate monitoring protocol is used.",M1
17487473,"Comparative CYP-dependent binding of the adrenocortical toxicants 3-methylsulfonyl-DDE and o,p'-<e>DDD</e> in Y-1 adrenal cells.The environmental pollutant 3-MeSO(2)-DDE [2-(3-methylsulfonyl-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethene] is an adrenocortical toxicant in mice, specifically in the glucocorticoid-producing zona fasciculata, due to a cytochrome P450 11B1 (CYP11B1)-catalysed bioactivation and formation of covalently bound protein adducts. o,p'-DDD [2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane] is toxic and inhibits steroidogenesis in the human adrenal cortex after bioactivation by unidentified CYPs, but does not exert any toxic effects on the mouse adrenal. As a step towards determining in vitro/in vivo relationships for the CYP-catalysed binding and toxicity of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE and o,p'-DDD, we have investigated the irreversible protein binding of these two toxicants in the murine adrenocortical cell line Y-1. The irreversible binding of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE previously demonstrated in vivo was successfully reproduced and could be inhibited by the CYP-inhibitors etomidate, ketoconazole and metyrapone. Surprisingly, o,p'-DDD reached similar levels of binding as 3-MeSO(2)-DDE. The binding of o,p'-DDD was sensitive to etomidate and ketoconazole, but not to metyrapone. Moreover, GSH depletion increased the binding of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE, but not of o,p'-DDD, indicating an important role of GSH conjugation in the detoxification of the 3-MeSO(2)-DDE-derived reactive metabolite. In addition, the specificity of CYP11B1 in activating 3-MeSO(2)-DDE was investigated using structurally analogous compounds. None of the analogues produced histopathological lesions in the mouse adrenal in vivo following a single i.p. injection of 100 mg/kg body weight, but two of the compounds were able to decrease the irreversible binding of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE to Y-1 cells. These results indicate that the bioactivation of 3-MeSO(2)-DDE by CYP11B1 is highly structure-dependent. In conclusion, both 3-MeSO(2)-DDE and o,p'-DDD bind irreversibly to Y-1 cells despite differences in binding and adrenotoxicity in mice in vivo. This reveals a notable in vitro/in vivo discrepancy, the contributing factors of which remain unexplained. We consider the Y-1 cell line as appropriate for studies of the cellular mechanisms behind the adrenocortical toxicity of these substances.",M1
17431626,"Pharmacokinetics of the adrenocorticolytic compounds 3-methylsulphonyl-DDE and o,p'-<e>DDD</e> (mitotane) in Minipigs.The pharmacokinetics of the adrenocorticolytic drug candidate 3-Methylsulphonyl-DDE (3-MeSO2-DDE) and the anticancer drug o,p'-DDD (mitotane) were studied in GÃ¶ttingen minipigs. The animals were given 3-MeSO2-DDE or o,p'-DDD as single oral doses (30 mg/kg). Concentrations in plasma and subcutaneous fat were measured by gas chromatography at different time points during 180 days. Maximal plasma concentrations appeared within 24 h for both compounds, but were about 2 times higher for 3-MeSO2DDE. o,p'-DDD plasma concentrations declined rapidly to low levels during 4 days. 3-MeSO2-DDE also decreased rapidly, but remained at high concentrations throughout the study. In fat, 3-MeSO2-DDE reached about 25-fold higher levels than o,p'-DDD at 30 days, and both substances were eliminated slowly from this tissue. 3-MeSO2-DDE liver concentrations were about 18-fold higher than those in plasma at 180 days. In contrast, o,p'-DDD liver and plasma levels were about equal at 180 days. o,p'-DDD had roughly 45 times larger CL/F than 3-MeSO2-DDE, confirming that the elimination of this compound was more rapid. Both compounds were characterised by their localisation and retention in fat tissue, and the individual size of the fat stores clearly determined the plasma concentrations. It is concluded that although 3-MeSO2-DDE is an interesting candidate for therapeutic use due to its potential characteristics to specifically target adrenocortical tumour cells the slow elimination of the compound might make it challenging to design appropriate dosage regimes.",M1
16551731,"Mitotane has an estrogenic effect on sex hormone-binding globulin and corticosteroid-binding globulin in humans.CONTEXT: Side effects of mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) have suggested estrogenic effects. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to explore o,p'-DDD potential estrogenic effect on SHBG and corticosteroid-binding globulin (CBG). DESIGN: Human hepatoma cell lines (HepG2), lacking estrogen receptor (ER)-alpha, and Hep89, stably transfected by ERalpha, were used. Setting: The study was conducted at an academic research laboratory and medical center. PATIENTS AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS: The study included 10 male patients with recurrent adrenal carcinoma, receiving mitotane (4-6.5 g daily) for more than 6 months. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The main outcome measures were SHBG/CBG mRNA levels measured by real-time PCR, culture medium SHBG/CBG concentrations measured by specific immunoassays, and transient transfection experiments with human SHBG proximal promoter reporter constructs. RESULTS: Increased serum SHBG and CBG concentrations, which exceeded normal male limits, were observed in most mitotane-treated patients. In the HepG2 cell line, 17beta-estradiol (E2) or o,p'-DDD treatment had no effect on mRNA or SHBG/CBG concentrations. In contrast, in the Hep89 cell line, E2 increased concentrations of SHBG (r = 0.44, P &lt; 0.0001) and CBG (r = 0.585, P &lt; 0.0001) secreted into culture media in a dose-dependent manner. o,p'-DDD significantly increased SHBG (150% vs. control, P &lt; 0.05) and CBG (184% vs. control, P &lt; 0.05) production by Hep89 cells, at a concentration of 2 x 10(-5) m. Transient transfection experiments in Hep89 cells showed that E2 or o,p'-DDD treatment did not increase the transcriptional activity of the minimal proximal promoter of human SHBG gene. CONCLUSIONS: Mitotane increased SHBG/CBG gene expression and liver production by mechanisms requiring the presence of ERalpha.",M1
16471038,"Clinical role of determination of plasma mitotane and its metabolites levels in patients with adrenal cancer: results of a long-term follow-up.Our study aimed at evaluation of the relations between the plasma levels of mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) and its metabolites, o,p'-DDA and o,p'-DDE, and the efficacy of Mitotane therapy during a long-term follow-up. Eighteen patients, aged 11 to 70 years, were included to the study. Metastatic or regional stage was diagnosed in 15 patients, while localized disease in three patients. Mitotane has been administered in daily doses of 3.0 to 10.0 g in metastatic and regional stages, and 1.5 to 4.0 g in the localized disease, simultaneously with hydrocortisone, prednisolone and fludrocortisone. Mitotane and its metabolites were determined by a high-pressure liquid chromatographic method. The plasma o,p'-DDD level exceeding 44 _M/L, considered as curative one, was reached in nine cases. The o,p'-DDA/o,p'-DDD ratio rose significantly mainly in the first 1-3 months of therapy. The o,p'-DDE levels rose slowly, reaching higher values in long-term therapy, over 12 months of mitotane administration. In the group of patients with regional or metastatic stage, both the o,p'-DDE levels and the o,p'-DDE/o,p'-DDD ratios were higher in the survivors than in non-survivors. The results of our study suggest that the plasma concentrations of o,p'-DDE were more closely related to clinical improvement or remission than the o,p'-DDD levels.",M1
15520502,"Effect of single and repeated in vitro exposure of ovarian follicles to o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT and their metabolites.The aim of the presented study was to compare the effect of o,p'-DDT [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(p,p'-chlorophenyl)-ethylene] and p,p'-DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane] and their metabolites DDE and <e>DDD</e> on estradiol secretion by ovarian follicles, the target organs of environmental estrogens. Theca interna (Tc) and granulosa cells (Gc) were collected from medium size porcine follicles and cultured as a monolayer. The cells were initially cultured for 24 h to allow attachment to the plates and then media were changed for the new ones and o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDT and their metabolites: o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDD were added at doses of 4, 40, 400 ng and 4 microg/ml medium to investigate dose-dependent effects. Media were collected after 24 h and frozen for estradiol content determination. When the effect of single and repeated exposure was investigated, the lowest dose of 4 ng/ml and the highest one of 4 microg/ml were chosen on the basis of the results of Experiment 1. o,p'-DDT exerted antiestrogenic action at all doses used while its metabolites and p,p'-DDT and its metabolites decreased estradiol secretion only when present in the medium at a dose of 4 ng/ml. The highest doses caused the increase in estradiol secretion. Parent o,p'-DDT and its metabolites showed antiestrogenic action after single exposure to 4 ng/ml while parent p,p'-DDT and its metabolites caused estrogenic action. All investigated compounds, except o,p'-DDT, increased estradiol secretion after single exposure to the dose of 4 microg/ml. Repeated exposure resulted in a massive antiestrogenic action of all investigated chemicals. In conclusion, our study points to time-dependent effect of DDT and its metabolites on ovarian follicles with the strongest estrogenic properties observed after single exposure and antiestrogenic action caused by repeated exposure. Given the duration of folliculogenesis, one can imagine many different potential mechanisms by which DDT could influence steroidogenesis.",M1
15045937,"[Diagnosis and treatment for adrenocortical carcinoma]Adrenocortical carcinomas frequently hypersecrete multiple adrenocortical steroids and their precursors. CT scan and MRI usually demonstrate necrotic lesions or areas of calcification in this uncommon tumor. Therapy in patients with adrenocortical carcinoma is less satisfactory.

Up to the present, mitotane (o, p'-<e>DDD</e>) treatment combined with chemotherapy has been the only palliative measure for patients with nonresectable or extensively recurrent tumors.",M1
12902190,"The organochlorine o,p'-<e>DDD</e> disrupts the adrenal steroidogenic signaling pathway in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).The mechanisms of action of o,p'-DDD on adrenal steroidogenesis were investigated in vitro in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss). Acute exposures to o,p'-DDD inhibited ACTH-stimulated cortisol secretion while cell viability decreased significantly only at the highest concentration tested (200 microM o,p'-DDD). Stimulation of cortisol secretion with a cAMP analogue (dibutyryl-cAMP) was inhibited at a higher concentration than that needed to inhibit ACTH-stimulated cortisol synthesis in cells exposed to o,p'-DDD. Forskolin-stimulated cortisol secretion and cAMP production, and NaF-stimulated cAMP production were inhibited in a concentration-dependent manner by o,p'-DDD. In contrast, basal cortisol secretion was stimulated while basal cAMP production was unaffected by o,p'-DDD. Pregnenolone-stimulated cortisol secretion was enhanced by o,p'-DDD at a physiologically relevant pregnenolone concentration, while o,p'-DDD inhibited cortisol secretion when a pharmacological concentration of pregnenolone was used. Our results suggest that the cAMP generation step is a target in o,p'-DDD-mediated disruption of ACTH-stimulated adrenal steroidogenesis in rainbow trout but that other downstream targets such as steroidogenic enzymes responsible for cortisol synthesis might also be affected.",M1
12547339,"Irreversible binding of o,p'-<e>DDD</e> in interrenal cells of Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua).Precision-cut tissue slices of the anterior kidney from Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) were prepared with a Krumdieck tissue slicer and exposed to 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chloro-(14C)phenyl)-1,1-dichlorethane (o,p(')-[14C]DDD) in vitro. Microautoradiography revealed irreversible o,p(')-DDD-derived binding confined to the glucocorticoid producing interrenal cells (adrenocortical analogues). This cell-selective binding was confirmed by means of autoradiography at different levels of resolution on Atlantic cod administered o,p(')-[14C]DDD intragastrically. The results provide evidence for a site-specific metabolic activation and irreversible binding of o,p(')-DDD in the interrenal cells, which, in turn, may modify glucocorticoid homeostasis.",M1
12515675,"In ovo exposure to o,p -DDE affects sexual development but not sexual differentiation in Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes).Despite being banned in many countries, dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>) continue to be found in fish tissues at concentrations of concern. Like o,p -DDT, o,p -DDE is estrogenic and is believed to exert its effects through binding to the estrogen receptor. The limited toxicologic data for o,p -DDE suggest that it decreases fecundity and fertility of fishes. We conducted an egg injection study using the d-rR strain of medaka and environmentally relevant concentrations of o,p -DDE to examine its effects on sexual differentiation and development. The gonads of exposed fish showed no evidence of sex reversal or intersex. However, other gonad abnormalities occurred in exposed individuals. Females exhibited few vitellogenic oocytes and increased atresia. Male testes appeared morphologically normal but were very small. Gonadosomatic index values for both sexes were lower for exposed fish. Our observations of abnormal female and very small male gonads after in ovo o,p -DDE exposure may be indicative of effects on early endocrine processes important for normal ovarian and testicular development.",M1
12463264,"Investigation of the role of aldosterone in hypertension associated with spontaneous pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism in dogs.The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of aldosterone as an initiating and/or perpetuating factor in hypertension associated with pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism (PDH) in dogs. Thirteen dogs with PDH and 11 healthy control dogs were used. In all dogs, arterial blood pressure and plasma sodium, potassium, basal aldosterone, post-ACTH aldosterone, basal cortisol and post-ACTH cortisol concentrations were measured. The tests were repeated 10 days and three months after the beginning of o,p'-<e>DDD</e> treatment in PDH dogs. In untreated PDH dogs, plasma aldosterone was significantly decreased, whereas cortisol, sodium and arterial blood pressure were significantly increased compared to healthy dogs. Hypertension remained in most treated PDH dogs despite normalisation of cortisol and persistently low aldosterone levels. These results did not demonstrate that aldosterone is involved in the development and perpetuation of hypertension in PDH. However, glucocorticoids seemed to play a major role as an initiating and perpetuating factor in PDH in dogs.",M1

The effects of o,p'-DDD on the cortisol stress response were investigated in rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, in a dose-response study in vivo. A dose-dependent decrease in plasma cortisol levels was observed on days 7 and 14 after a single i.p. injection of o,p'-DDD. Treatment with o,p'-DDD had no effect on weight gain, hematocrit, and gonado- or hepatosomatic index but decreased liver glycogen reserves.

Autoradiography was used to examine CYP11B1-catalyzed binding of MeSO(2)-[(14)C]DDE and the adrenocorticolytic drug 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichlorethane; (o,p'-[(14)C]DDD, Mitotane, Lysodren) in human adrenal tissue slice culture. Both compounds gave rise to a selective binding in the one sample of normal adrenal zona fasciculata/reticularis, leaving zona glomerulosa and the adrenal medulla devoid of binding. Addition of the CYP11B1 selective inhibitor metyrapone (50 microM) reduced MeSO(2)-[(14)C]DDE binding below the detection limit, whereas o,p'-[(14)C]DDD binding was reduced only by 42%. Selective binding of MeSO(2)-[(14)C]DDE and o,p'-[(14)C]DDD was also observed in an aldosterone-producing adrenocortical carcinoma and in a nonfunctional adrenocortical hyperplasia. Exposure of slices from the normal adrenal cortex to MeSO(2)-DDE (25 microM) resulted in an increased accumulation of 11-deoxycorticosterone, 11-deoxycortisol and androstenedione in the medium, and exposure to o,p'-DDD (25 microM) did not alter the steroid secretion pattern. No histological changes were found in either MeSO(2)-DDE- or o,p'-DDD-exposed slices, compared with nonexposed slices. We suggest that MeSO(2)-DDE might act as a potent adrenocorticolytic agent in humans. Further studies are needed to establish the usefulness of MeSO(2)-DDE as a possible alternative for the treatment of adrenocortical hypersecretion and tumor growth.",M1
11522375,"Primary culture system of adrenocortical cells from dogs to evaluate direct effects of chemicals on steroidogenesis.The present study was conducted to confirm the usefulness of a primary culture system of adrenocortical cells from dogs for detecting the direct effects of the chemicals on adrenal cortex. Corticosteroid levels in the culture supernatant were measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) following 24-h incubation with the chemicals. Ketoconazole, miconazole, metyrapone, aminoglutethimide, and 1-(o-chlorophenyl)-1-(p-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane (o,p-<e>DDD</e>), which were known to inhibit cortisol production were evaluated in this system. Both viable cells and corticosteroid levels were decreased by o,p-DDD treatment. Other chemicals showed various inhibition patterns of corticosteroid levels as follows without affecting cell viability. Ketoconazole decreased total corticosteroids level by mainly due to the decreases in cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol levels. Miconazole decreased cortisol and 11-deoxycortisol levels, however, slightly increased corticosterone level. Metyrapone decreased cortisol and corticosterone levels as 11-deoxycortisol and 11-deoxycorticosterone levels were increased. Aminoglutethimide decreased total corticosteroids level by mainly decreasing cortisol, corticosterone and 11-deoxycortisol levels. These results suggested that determination of the pattern of corticosteroid levels by HPLC in this system well reflected the mode of their action on steroidogenesis. Thus, we conclude this simple system was useful to determine the direct effects of chemicals on steroidogenesis in the adrenal cortex.",M1

The first patient received mitotane as monotherapy after relapse (in doses ranging from 3 to 6 g/day initially and 1 g/day thereafter, for 13 yr). The second patient presented with metastatic disease and underwent radical surgical excision of the adrenal. Mitotane was administered initially at 2.5 g/day, and the dose was gradually lowered over 8 yr to 1 g/day, without interruption. Both patients tolerated the medication well, regardless of the daily dosage, with complaints limited to epigastric pain and nausea, while their disease has been kept under control for 14 and 16 yr, respectively. The blockade of steroid synthesis with mitotane resulted in hypercholesterolemia in both patients and in premature menopause in the second patient; however, these abnormalities were taken care of with the appropriate therapy. The excellent follow-up of these patients suggests that even in hopeless cases with metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma, mitotane should be administered for very long periods of time as it can be well-tolerated and may be beneficial in the long run.",M1

Therapeutic management by monitoring o,p'-DDD blood levels]BACKGROUND: o,p'-DDD (1-dichloro-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)-ethane), which leads to a cytotoxic necrosis of the adrenal glands, currently is therapy of choice for metastasized adrenocortical carcinomas. Clinical experience is still poor, but most studies demonstrate an increment of survival time in patients treated with o,p'-DDD after incomplete surgery. The therapeutic range is close and therefore dosage is difficult, mainly based on clinical signs. Methods for routine determination of o,p'-DDD are not yet broadly available. PATIENTS AND METHOD: We developed a method for the determination of o,p'-DDD and report our experience with the monitoring of serum levels of o,p'-DDD in our patients. Nine patients have been included, eight patients with metastasized adrenocortical carcinoma were treated with o,p'-DDD. RESULTS: At time of evaluation six of eight patients had deceased, 27.9 +/- 25.1 months after recurrence of the disease. Time of survival for all patients was 28.2 +/- 22.0 months since diagnosis of recurrence. In three patients the target dose of 9-10 g/d could not be reached due to the clinical situation. The serum levels of these patients were low (6.3 +/- 4.2 micrograms/ml). Mean survival time was significantly longer for those patients who reached serum levels above 14 micrograms/ml in comparison to those who failed to reach such high levels (41.3 +/- 16.2 vs 6.3 +/- 3.6 months, p &lt; 0.01). The dose which was necessary to reach high levels was individually different. All patients developed adrenocortical insufficiency. Other side effects were fatigue (seven patients), gastrointestinal problems and elevated liver enzymes (six patients each), changes in blood count (five patients) and central nervous disorder (four patients). All patients developing intolerable side effects had very high serum levels of o,p'-DDD (&gt; 20 micrograms/ml). CONCLUSIONS: Our data confirm that the efficacy of a therapy with o,p'-DDD as well as the risk to develop intolerable side effects depend on the serum levels of o,p'-DDD. Monitoring of o,p'-DDD therapy by measuring serum levels of o,p'-DDD helps to adapt this therapy individually, avoiding serious side effects as well as to realize antitherapeutical resistance. Determination of o,p'-DDD serum levels helps to decide over intensification or cessation of therapy.",M1
11489305,"Influence of o'p-<e>DDD</e> on the physiological response to stress in Arctic charr (Salvelinus alpinus).Various toxicants have previously been held responsible for an impaired capacity of fish from polluted environments to elevate their cortisol levels in response to stress. In the present study we investigated the responses to stress in o'p-DDD [2-(chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorphenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane] exposed (given a single, oral dose of 75 mg o'p-DDD/kg fish) and unexposed Arctic charr. After o'p-DDD administration fish were left undisturbed and without being fed for 28 days, when they were subjected to an acute handling stress. At 1, 3, 7 and 23 h following stress, primary (ACTH and cortisol secretion) and secondary (plasma Cl levels and energy mobilisation) components of the stress response were monitored. As the nutritional state of wild fish may influence this potential biomarker response, the fish had been subjected to a restricted feed ration prior to o'p-DDD administration in order to obtain marked within-group variations in condition factor. No effects of o'p-DDD were observed on post-stress hormone secretion (i.e. peak post-stress plasma ACTH and cortisol levels), nor on plasma chloride levels. However, other results obtained provided evidence for a metabolic depression by o'p-DDD, witnessed by consistently lower plasma glucose levels before and after stress in these contaminated fish. This may be related to the finding that during the 30-day period between o'p-DDD administration and stress treatment, toxicant treated fish lost less weight in comparison to their sham-treated counterparts. Nutritional state did not appear to influence the performance of the charr in the present experiment, as correlations between the parameters measured and condition factor or lipid contents on an individual basis in all cases turned out non significant. Overall, the results contrast with those of previous in vivo and in vitro studies on fish, which concluded that comparable headkidney o'p-DDD levels impaired interrenal steroidogenesis. Although we conclude that the effects of o'p-DDD on Arctic charr metabolism were not associated with the stress response, we propose that they may well interfere with the animals' ability to cope with stress in the long term, or may compromise other physiological processes, such as smoltification. Finally, the high level of integration of components involved in the stress response complicates the identification of single stress-sensitive indices as biomarkers applicable in environmental monitoring programmes.",M1
11042008,"Pharmacological adrenalectomy with mitotane.The potential of mitotane (ortho, para'-<e>DDD</e>, commonly used to treat adrenal carcinomas in humans and dogs) was investigated as an alternative to surgical adrenalectomy in birds, salamanders, and lizards. House sparrows (Passer domesticus) were injected twice daily with vehicle or one of two doses of mitotane (225 or 450 mg/kg), and basal and stress-induced levels of corticosterone (CORT) were measured 3 and 5 days after injections. Mitotane reduced basal CORT levels to nondetectable and abolished stress-induced CORT increases by the 3rd day of treatment. In another study, a single injection of mitotane was effective in lowering endogenous CORT levels 36 h later, but levels had apparently recovered by 10 days after the injection. Mitotane did not effect testicular weights and had no detectable effect on testosterone levels. In contrast to its effects on house sparrows, mitotane did not lower endogenous CORT levels in either tiger salamanders (Ambystoma tigrinum) or tree lizards (Urosaurus ornatus), even at doses much higher than those used in house sparrows.",M1
11004720,"Conventional and novel strategies in the treatment of adrenocortical cancer.Adrenocortical carcinoma is a highly malignant neoplasm with an incidence of two per million people per year. Several treatment strategies have resulted in temporary or partial tumor regression but very few cases have attained long survival. Surgical resection of the primary tumor and metastases is most effective. Several chemotherapeutic protocols have been employed with variable success. Mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) is an adrenalytic drug effective in inducing a tumor response in 33% of patients treated. Mitotane requires metabolic transformation for therapeutic action. Tumors may vary in their ability to metabolize mitotane and the ability of tumors to transform mitotane may predict the clinical response to the drug. Preliminary data show a possible correlation between metabolic activity of neoplastic adrenocortical tissue and response to mitotane. We have attempted to develop mitotane analogs with enhanced adrenalytic effect. Compared to mitotane, a di-chloro compound, the bromo-chloro and di-bromo analogs appear to have a greater effect. Future approaches to the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma are likely to be based on blocking or reversing the biological mechanisms of tumorigenesis. Angiogenic and chemotactic mechanisms may play a role in adrenal tumor growth and inhibition of these mechanisms may result in inhibition of tumor growth. New mitotane analogs with greater adrenalytic potential could be a promising approach to developing more effective and selective therapies for adrenal cancer. Alternative approaches should attempt to suppress tumor growth by means of compounds with anti-angiogenic and anti-chemotactic activity.",M1
11004719,"Clinical results of the use of mitotane for adrenocortical carcinoma.Mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) acts mainly as an inhibitor of intramitochondrial pregnenolone and cortisol synthesis. Its adrenolytic effect depends on metabolic activation due to conversion to o,p'-DDA and o,p'-DDE. The drug has been used for 40 years in the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma, mainly its regional and metastatic stage, as an adjuvant to surgical resection of the tumor. In the medical literature there are controversial opinions about its efficacy for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. In our experience, mitotane administered immediately after surgery appeared to be much more efficient than when administered later. We have administered this drug in all cases of microscopically confirmed adrenocortical carcinoma, irrespectively of stage at the time of surgery, for fear of a false too optimistic classification. In our series of 82 patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, 59 patients have been treated with mitotane, 32 of them immediately after surgery, and 27 with a delay of 2 to 24 months. Today there are 18 survivors in the group of patients treated with mitotane soon after the operation and only 6 survivors in the group receiving mitotane with a delay. All patients were simultaneously given replacement therapy. Undesired effects of mitotane administration included increased aminotransferase and alkaline phosphatase activity, decreased white cell, platelet or red cell number, and myasthenia. Furthermore, we used mitotane with good results in Cushing's syndrome of non-malignant origin as pre-treatment before surgery or in long-term treatment for patients with poor tolerance of other adrenal inhibitors.",M1
10730906,"Changes in neoplastic cell features and sensitivity to mitotane during mitotane-induced remission in a patient with recurrent, metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma.A 58-year-old man had adrenocortical carcinoma in the right adrenal gland. The tumour secreted excessive cortisol and dehydroepiandrosterone-sulphate (DHEA-S), and had invaded the right hepatic lobe and vena cava. Eleven months after surgical tumour resection, the serum DHEA-S levels again increased. Local tumour recurrence and a metastasis was found in the lung. Eleven months after surgery chemotherapy with mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) was initiated. Twelve weeks of mitotane reduced serum DHEA-S levels and caused these tumours to disappear. The patient was then treated with low-dose mitotane (1.5-2.0 g/day) for 2 years. Serum levels of mitotane remained at less than 10 microg/ml. Although such low serum levels of mitotane and delayed initiation of mitotane after surgery have been proposed to weaken the antineoplastic effect of mitotane, the patient had a remission for 2 years. However, there was then local re-recurrence with an increase in serum DHEA-S and death 4 months later. The histological features of neoplastic cells were quite different comparing tumour resected at surgery and tumour at autopsy. The latter had more frequent mitotic nuclei. This tumour was initially sensitive to mitotane, but later became insensitive.",M1
10580743,"Growth stimulation of a rat pituitary cell line MtT/E-2 by environmental estrogens in vitro and in vivo.Endocrine disruptors are a diverse group of chemicals that alter the functions of the endocrine system. A large proportion of endocrine disruptors have estrogenic effects, thus are called environmental estrogens. In the present study, an estrogen (E2) responsive rat pituitary cell line, MtT/E-2, was employed to examine 1) the potency of several endocrine disruptors including bisphenol A (BPA), o,p'-<e>DDD</e>, methoxychlor, 1,2,3,4,5,6-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) and dibromoacetic acid (DBAA) in terms of E2 responsive pituitary cell growth; 2) whether BPA has estrogenic action in vivo causing the growth of MtT/E-2 cells grafted in rats. Binding assays showed the test chemicals were able to compete with 3H-E2 binding to the estrogen receptor (ER). The compounds also stimulated growth of MtT/E-2 cells at rates corresponding to their ER binding affinity. Their transcription activation of an (ERE)3-SV40-luciferase reporter in MtT/E-2 cells was comparable to their stimulation of cell growth, with the exception of HCH which showed little induction of cell growth but strong stimulation in ERE dependent transcription activation. MtT/E-2 cells were inoculated into ovariectomized female F344 rats treated with E2 or BPA. The first tumors were noted at day 22 in the E2 treated group, at day 25 in the highest dose of BPA group and at day 41 in the control group. These results suggest 1) that the growth assay with MtT/E-2 cells provides simple and sensitive test for detection of estrogenic activity of environmental chemicals; 2) that BPA has estrogenic potency to stimulate E2 responsive cell growth in vivo as well as in vitro.",M1

10329503,"Effects of in vitro exposures to cadmium, mercury, zinc, and 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane on steroidogenesis by dispersed interrenal cells of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).Numerous environmental xenobiotics can act as endocrine disrupters in wildlife species. Fish chronically exposed to pollutants exhibit a deficiency in the synthesis of cortisol, a glucocorticosteroid hormone secreted by interrenal steroidogenic cells in response to ACTH by a mechanism mediated by cAMP. The capacity of a series of heavy metals (CdCl2, ZnCl2, HgCl2, and CH3HgCl) and 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) to disrupt cortisol secretion was determined in dispersed interrenal cells of rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss) exposed in vitro to the toxicant, by measuring cortisol secretion stimulated with ACTH or dibutiryl-cAMP (dbcAMP) and by assessing cell viability. The effect of cadmium in presence of zinc on the interrenal cells was also determined. The median lethal concentration (LC50, dose that kills 50% of the cells), median effective concentration (EC50, dose that inhibits cortisol secretion by 50%), and LC50/EC50 ratio were determined for each chemical to compare its endocrine toxicity and to test the specificity of the toxicants to act as endocrine disrupters. HgCl2 had the lowest EC50 and LC50; it was the most toxic of the chemicals tested. The LC50/EC50 ratio was the highest for ZnCl2 and CdCl2, indicating that these toxicants had the most specific endocrine toxicity. The mechanism of toxicity of heavy metals on cortisol-secreting cells involves a site situated downstream from the step generating cAMP, while o,p'-DDD seemed to impair a step located between adenyl cyclase activation and the ACTH binding. No evidence for a protector effect of zinc against cadmium toxicity was found.",M1

10098537,"Pesticides interfere with the nongenomic action of a progestogen on meiotic maturation by binding to its plasma membrane receptor on fish oocytes.Although many environmental contaminants disrupt endocrine function by binding to nuclear steroid receptors, it is not known whether they are capable of binding to steroid membrane receptors and interfering with nongenomic actions of steroids. The binding of several organochlorine pesticides to the plasma membrane receptor for the maturation-inducing steroid, 17,20beta,21-trihydroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (20beta-S), in the ovaries of spotted seatrout (Cynoscion nebulosus) was investigated in in vitro competition assays. Kepone and o,p'-<e>DDD</e> were competitive inhibitors of 20beta-S binding and caused concentration-dependent displacement of [3H]-20beta-S from its receptor site over the range of 10(-4) to 10(-6) or 10(-7) M, whereas several other pesticides had lower affinities for the receptor. Interference with the nongenomic actions of 20beta-S on final meiotic maturation of spotted seatrout oocytes (final oocyte maturation, FOM) was examined in an in vitro bioassay. A concentration-dependent inhibition of FOM in response to 20beta-S was observed after 5 min and 12 h exposure to the same range of Kepone and o,p'-DDD concentrations (10(-4) to 10(-6) or 10(-7) M). The close correspondence between competitive binding of the two pesticides to the 20beta-S membrane receptor and their inhibition of 20beta-S induced FOM suggests a mechanism of endocrine disruption mediated by binding to a steroid membrane receptor and antagonism of a nongenomic steroid action.",M1
10036216,"Phenobarbital induction of CYP2B1/2 in primary hepatocytes: endocrine regulation and evidence for a single pathway for multiple inducers.Phenobarbital (PB) and many structurally unrelated chemicals induce the protein and mRNA of P450 cytochromes CYP2B1, CYP2B2, CYP3A1, and specific phase II enzymes to a greater extent in Fischer 344 (F344) than in Wistar Furth (WF) female rats. This sex- and strain-dependent polymorphism can be partly attributed to suppressive effects of thyroid hormone (TH) on WF but not F344 females. We show here that this strain difference was largely retained in primary hepatocyte cultures and could be resolved into two components; (1) Expression of PB-inducible genes-WF hepatocytes had inherently lower basal and PB-induced levels of CYP2B1/2B2 protein and mRNA and UDPGT mRNA; and (2) TH sensitivity-in WF hepatocytes, PB induction, but not basal expression, of CYP2B1/2B2 was three- to fivefold more susceptible to inhibition by TH when the hormone was added to the medium. This second component explains the selective effect of in vivo treatment with methimazole, which lowers circulating TH and partially improves PB induction in WF female rats. Following transfection of a reporter construct containing a PB-responsive unit (PBRU), the plasmid was activated by PB to similar extents in hepatocytes from both rat strains. TH treatment did not inhibit PB-mediated induction of the plasmid in either cell type. Thus, neither of the components determining the strain polymorphism are linked to trans-activating factors contributing to this PBRU activity. The PB-like inducers, 2,2',4,4',5, 5'-hexachlorobiphenyl (HCB) and 1,1-dichloro-2, 2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (o,p-<e>DDD</e>), proportionally induced the CYP2B1/2B2 and UDPGT genes and activated the plasmid (HCB = PB &gt; DDD). CYP2B1/2B2 expression following induction by PB and HCB was subject to identical patterns of inhibition by okadaic acid, cAMP, and GH. Together, these data suggest that PB-like inducers utilize the same polymorphic pathway to affect the same PBRU-activating factors.",M1

On the third day, glucocorticoid and mineralocorticoid supplementation was begun for the induced adrenocortical insufficiency. The first followup examination after completion of the 25-day course and the subsequent twice-yearly follow-up examinations included physical examination and measurements of plasma concentrations of sodium and potassium to optimise substitution therapy. In 19 dogs the full course of 25 days treatment could not be completed. Of the 110 dogs which received the full course of treatment, the administration had to be stopped temporarily in 32 because of side-effects, such as anorexia and vomiting. The actual dose of o,p'-DDD administered was not significantly different in the dogs with and without these side-effects. Clinical remission occurred in 111 dogs (86 per cent), of which 43 (39 per cent) had a relapse. The estimated one-year disease-free fraction was 77 per cent (95 per cent confidence interval [CI]: 67 to 85 per cent). The estimated one-year survival fraction was 80 per cent (95 per cent CI: 71 to 87 per cent), the two-year survival was 69 per cent (95 per cent CI: 59 to 78 per cent), and the three-year survival was 61 per cent (95 per cent CI: 49 to 71 per cent). The bodyweight and age of the dog, and vomiting occurring during the period of treatment, were positively correlated with the length of the disease-free period, whereas weakness during the treatment and resistance to dexamethasone suppression of the urinary corticoid/creatinine ratios at the start of the treatment were associated with a relatively short survival time.",M1

Boys and girls were affected equally. The disease was revealed by virilization (61%) or by a palpable mass (39%) with a 0.1-5.5 year delay from initial symptoms. At initial examination, we found that 76% of children were virilized. Ninety-four percent of the tested tumors secreted androgens, which were associated with glucocorticoids in 36%. Adrenal tumors in children were smaller than in adults. Half of them measured less than 10 cm. There were recurrences in 40% of children. The survival rate at 5 years was 49%, 70% if resection was microscopically complete and 7% if not (P &lt; 0.001).

In the fourth patient, two lung metastasis were successfully removed after 48 months of follow-up. The patient is doing well and is disease free 6 months later. Though our series is too small to draw final conclusions, we suggest that low doses of mitotane, which are well tolerated, might offer prolonged disease-free survival in adrenocortical carcinoma.

ANIMALS: 15 dogs with PDH. PROCEDURE: All 15 dogs were given an induction dose of mitotane (o,p'-DDD: 35 to 50 mg/kg of body weight/d) for 3 to 14 days. During the induction period, free-catch morning urine samples were collected for determination of UCCR, followed by ACTH stimulation testing, every other day. Treatment response was divided into 3 categories: well-controlled PDH (post-ACTH serum cortisol concentration &gt; or = 28 nmol/L but &lt; or = 138 nmol/L), deficient cortisol secretion (post-ACTH serum cortisol concentration &lt; 28 nmol/L), and excess cortisol secretion (post-ACTH serum cortisol concentration &gt; 138 nmol/L). RESULTS: The linear relation between UCCR and post-ACTH serum cortisol concentration was significant (P &lt; 0.001); however, the prediction intervals surrounding the line were too broad to be clinically useful. The UCCR overlapped among the 3 categories of treatment response. Nevertheless, dogs with PDH receiving mitotane induction treatment and with UCCR &gt; 79 x 10(-6) were always classified as having excess cortisol secretion. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: The UCCR failed to predict post-ACTH cortisol concentration during mitotane induction treatment sufficiently close to be a clinically reliable indicator of treatment control.

The question arises whether, after unsatisfactory treatment with various adrenostatic drugs, mitotane (o,p'-DDD), used against adrenal cortical cancer, is efficacious and free of significant side effects when used long-term. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The results of long-term administration of mitotane to six patients, including one pregnant woman, were analysed retrospectively. After a moderate initial dosage of 3.0 g daily a maintenance dose of minimally 0.5 g per week was given or the treatment temporarily interrupted. The concentration of urinary free cortisol served as the main criterion of efficaciousness, together with the clinical course. The plasma concentrations of cortisol, aldosterone and ACTH were also determined, as well as routine clinicochemical parameters. RESULTS: Cortisol excretion became normal in all patients between the 2nd and 10th treatment month, falling from 919 +/- 621.3 nmol daily in the six months before treatment to 162 +/- 93.0 nmol daily in the third six-month treatment period (mean +/- standard deviation). Normal cortisol excretion and regression of symptoms was noted, dose-dependent, as long as the 12th year after start of treatment. Adrenocortical insufficiency occurred in one patient and at times required hormone substitution, followed by lasting remission without special treatment. Significant side effects were not observed other than a reversible increase in gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. CONCLUSION: Mitotane proved to be an efficacious drug which in exceptional cases can be used without significant side effects in low dosage for the long-term treatment of hypothalamic-pituitary Cushing disease.",M1

9118466,"Adrenal proteins bound by a reactive intermediate of mitotane.PURPOSE: Mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>), is the only adrenolytic agent available for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma. Previous studies have shown that mitotane covalently binds to adrenal proteins following its metabolism in adrenocortical tissue to a reactive acyl chloride intermediate. It was the objective of this study to compare the electrophoresis separation patterns of such adducts following activation of mitotane by various adrenocortical sources. METHODS: With the use of a 125I-labeled analog of mitotane, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-iodophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane, gel electrophoresis patterns were obtained for homogenates from bovine, canine and human adrenocortical preparations as well as from a human adrenal preparation. Western immunoblotting analysis was used to test the resulting patterns for adducts of cytochrome P-450scc and adrenodoxin. RESULTS: The electrophoresis separations were similar for all preparations, with bands at apparent molecular weights of 49.5 and 11.5 kDa being the most pronounced. Radiolabeling of the proteins of a human adrenal cancer cell line NCI H-295 was weak, but a band at 11.5 kDa was detected. Western immunoblotting analyses indicated that the band at 49.5 kDa corresponded in molecular weight to that of adrenal cytochrome P-450scc, but the band at 11.5 kDa did not correspond to adrenodoxin. CONCLUSIONS: The similarity of the results with canine and bovine adrenal preparations to that of human material offers useful systems for studying mitotane and its analogs. This should aid in understanding the mechanism of action of mitotane and in the design of compounds for the treatment of adrenocortical carcinoma.",M1

The limit of detection was 0.25 mumol/L and the standard curve was linear in the 1-100 mumol/L range. The method has been evaluated using samples obtained from an adolescent girl who had metastatic adrenocortical carcinoma. Data from this single patient may suggest that systemic absorption of mitotane is adequate, and toxicity possibly decreased, when mitotane is administered by the rectal route.",M1

In support of a study to develop mitotane analogs as more effective therapeutic agents and as a basis for understanding the toxicity of related compounds in the adrenals, the biotransformations of o,p'-DDD in adrenocortical homogenate preparations have been studied and compared with those of its m,p'- and p,p'-isomers. Aliphatic oxidation to the corresponding acetic acid derivative, o,p'-, m,p'- or p,p'-DDA, was the major transformation for all the preparations. In the comparisons of the DDD isomers, the order of both DDA formation and apparent covalent binding was o,p'- &gt; m,p'- &gt; p,p'-DDD. There was also evidence for alpha-hydroxylation at the benzylic carbon with subsequent loss of water to form ethylene derivatives. This was a minor pathway for o,p'-DDD, but was the major pathway for the other two isomers. Thus, while the total yields of metabolites of o,p'- and m,p'-DDD were similar and at least twice that of the p,p'-isomer, their distribution of metabolites differed significantly. The effects of the three isomers on cell growth and cortisol production with the human adrenocortical carcinoma cell line, NCI H-295, followed the same order as their DDA formation and tissue binding. It is proposed that hydroxylation by the adrenal cortex at the beta-carbon leads to an adrenalytic effect, whereas hydroxylation at the alpha-carbon would represent an alternate deactivation pathway.",M1

In support of a program to develop agents superior to mitotane, it is the purpose of this study to explore the relationship of the metabolism of mitotane to its binding to adrenal cortex tissue from several sources. The objective was to detect the mitotane moiety responsible for its covalent binding in various test systems. Studies were conducted with an 125l-labeled analog of mitotane, 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-iodophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane, prior to a comparison to results with lower specific activity [14C]mitotane. With dog adrenal cortical whole homogenates, the majority of covalent binding was to proteins with an additional one-sixth of the total bound radioactivity associated with a phospholipid fraction. No radioactivity was associated with DNA. The rank order of species in regard to metabolism and protein binding was bovine &gt; dog &gt; rat adrenal homogenates &gt; human normal adrenal or tumor homogenates. The percentage of radioactivity recovered from the hydrolysates of those fractions was uniformly high. In addition, the only metabolite present in the hydrolysates corresponded to 1-(2-chlorophenyl)-1-(4-iodophenyl)acetic acid from the iodo analog of o,p'-DDD and the corresponding o,p'-dichlorodiphenylacetic acid (o,p'-DDA) from o,p'-DDD. Our results are consistent with an acyl chloride being the reactive intermediate formed from the dichloromethyl moiety of mitotane, which leads to both DDA metabolite formation and binding to adrenal cortical bionucleophiles.",M1

The mitochondrial bioactivation was twice as high as the microsomal, thus the study was focused on the mitochondria. The irreversible binding was time and protein dependent with apparent Km and Vmax values of 1.4 microM and 275 pmol/mg protein/h. As a comparison the activation of 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (o,p'-DDD), a well-known adrenolytic compound in humans, was studied. The irreversible binding of both these DDT metabolites was inhibited by metyrapone, indicating the involvement of cytochrome P-450. Addition of reduced glutathione (GSH) to the incubation medium decreased the irreversible binding of MeSO2-DDE significantly whereas the binding of o,p'-DDD was only slightly affected. The above findings suggest that MeSO2-DDE may be toxic to the human adrenal gland, although further study is necessary to assess this potential.",M1

The effect of o,p-DDD on GSH level and activity of glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase which maintain the level of reduced glutathione was analyzed in the adrenal and liver tissue of rats. This species is resistant to adrenocorticolytic action of o,p-DDD. It was shown that feeding of rats weighting 200-240 g with oil solution of o,p-DDD (75 mg daily) for 3 days causes the decrease in activity of glutathione-S-transferase and content of oxidazed glutathione in the adrenals with simultaneous increase of the content of reduced glutathione. The glutathione-S-transferase and glutathione reductase activity in the liver rises under the effect of o,p-DDD, the decrease of the GSH level being observed.

8242539,"Adrenal cortical carcinoma. Epidemiology and treatment with mitotane and a review of the literature.BACKGROUND: Adrenal cortical carcinoma is rare; the authors have treated only eight patients with the disease at Good Samaritan Regional Medical Center since 1974. No exhaustive collection of cases of this cancer has been done since 1952. METHODS: The authors retrospectively reviewed the medical records of their eight patients with adrenal cortical carcinoma. They also searched the English literature from 1952 to 1992 for reports of patients with the disease. They treated each report as a series if two or more previously unreported patients were reported. They paid special attention to patients for whom stage of disease was noted at diagnosis, treatment with mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) was used, and the outcome was reported. RESULTS: Five were male and three were female patients. Five had nonfunctional tumors. None were pediatric. The authors found 1891 cases in the English literature. Adrenal cortical carcinomas are more common in women (58.6%) than in men (41.4%). The age distribution of tumors is bimodal, with peaks in the first and fifth decades. Tumors in children are more commonly functional (83.5% in female patients, 85.6% in male patients), although nonfunctional tumors are more common in older patients (84.7%). Most (68%) of these tumors are diagnosed late in disease when surgery is no longer curative. Only 35% of patients treated with mitotane had a clinical response. CONCLUSIONS: Adrenal cortical carcinomas are diagnosed most often in children because of functionality and older men because of mass effect. Most tumors are discovered too late for curative resection. Treatment of metastatic disease with mitotane has limited success.",M1

DESIGN: Open study. SETTING: Departments of Surgery, Pathology, Endocrinology, and Clinical Chemistry, Sahlgren Hospital, GÃ¶teborg, Sweden. SUBJECTS: 10 consecutive patients, two with recurrent and eight with primary adrenocortical carcinoma. INTERVENTIONS: All patients were treated surgically. Two required preoperative embolisation of the tumour vessels to facilitate excision of particularly large tumours, and eight were given adjuvant treatment with mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>). RESULTS: At a median follow up of 1.5 years (range 3 months, to 21 years) 6 patients were alive with no radiological or biochemical signs of disease; 2 were alive, but with signs of recurrence (at 3 months and 6 years, respectively); and two had died of their disease (at 4 and 8 months, respectively). For the past two years all patients have had their urinary steroid profiles monitored by gas chromatography and mass spectrometry to detect recurrence of the tumour at the earliest possible stage. CONCLUSION: Operation is the treatment of choice for patients with adrenocortical carcinoma, particularly stages I-III. The role of mitotane as adjuvant treatment can be evaluated only in multicentre studies.",M1

Their hormonal response was monitored by measurements of the urinary corticoid/creatinine ratio. In one dog, two courses of 10 days treatment with o,p'-DDD were ineffective, whereas in the other dog the urinary corticoids decreased to very low levels after only six days of treatment, and corticosteroid supplementation had to be started. Two other dogs received o,p'-DDD according to a protocol used for the treatment of pituitary-dependent hyperadrenocorticism which aims at the complete destruction of the adrenal cortices, with substitution for the induced hyperadrenocorticism. Both dogs made a good recovery and their urinary corticoid/creatinine ratio decreased to within the reference range.

It changed from a biochemically functioning, low-grade malignant tumour into a non-functioning malignancy with pronounced mitotic activity, accompanied by an ovarian carcinosarcoma 1 yr before death. Quality of life was reasonable for many years despite chemotherapy, consisting of a total of almost 10 kg of o,p'-DDD administered over a period of 8 yr, and the subsequent side effects (e.g. low T4; increased bleeding time). A reduced mineralocorticoid activity, induced by o,p'-DDD, was reversed after discontinuation of o,p'-DDD treatment.

Three (30%) of the tumors were nonfunctioning. The remaining seven (70%) were functioning, six of them occurring in women. Common presenting features were hormonal excess, distant metastases, weight loss, and abdominal pain. The primary tumor was resected in all patients, only two of whom had disease confined to the adrenal gland. Tumor diameter ranged from 9 to 21 cm (mean 15.7 cm). Inferior vena caval or right atrial extension of tumor thrombus was present in two patients. Excluding two deaths from postoperative complications, seven patients died of their disease after a mean survival of 25 months (range 2 to 84 months). Of seven patients who received o,p'-<e>DDD</e> treatment for metastatic or recurrent tumor, three (43%) had an objective response. In two patients, tumor regression was complete and was associated with prolonged survival.

The second patient had complete regression of pulmonary and liver metastases confirmed at laparotomy and thoracotomy and remains free of disease at 78 months. None of the five patients treated with various combinations of cytotoxic chemotherapy had an observable response, and no measurable effect was seen in a single patient following abdominal radiotherapy. It is concluded that resection for local recurrence may prolong survival and that significant and lasting tumor regression is possible with o,p'-DDD administration.

1675220,"Mitotane enhances cytotoxicity of chemotherapy in cell lines expressing a multidrug resistance gene (mdr-1/P-glycoprotein) which is also expressed by adrenocortical carcinomas.P-Glycoprotein (Pgp), product of the mdr-1 gene, is a 130- to 180-kDa plasma membrane phosphoglycoprotein which mediates multidrug resistance in cell culture by increasing efflux of the natural product chemotherapeutic agents. High levels of expression of mdr-1/Pgp are found in both the normal adrenal and adrenocortical cancers. By RNA in situ hybridization the expression in adrenocortical cancer is shown to be widely distributed. The present study demonstrates that decreased drug accumulation mediated by mdr-1/Pgp can be overcome by clinically achievable concentrations of mitotane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>). The increase in drug accumulation with the addition of mitotane is due at least in part to a decrease in drug efflux and results in an increase in cytotoxicity when agents of the natural product class are used. This effect is observed in cells with a broad range of mdr-1/Pgp expression, including levels comparable to those found in most adrenocortical cancers. Similar increases in drug accumulation can be demonstrated in an unselected adrenocortical cancer cell line that expresses mdr-1/Pgp. The finding that multidrug resistance mediated by mdr-1/Pgp can be reversed by mitotane provides a rational basis for exploring the use of mitotane in combination with natural product chemotherapeutic agents in adrenocortical cancer.",M1

During the induction period, 194 of the dogs also were given daily maintenance dosages of a glucocorticoid. Fifty of the dogs exhibited one or more adverse effects during initial induction, including weakness, vomiting, anorexia, diarrhea, and ataxia. After completion of the induction period, repeat ACTH stimulation testing revealed significant decreases in mean serum cortisol concentrations when compared with initial values. Twenty-five dogs, however, still responded to exogenous ACTH with serum cortisol concentrations above normal resting range, necessitating daily treatment for an additional 5 to 55 days. In contrast, 70 of the 200 dogs had low post-ACTH serum cortisol concentrations after the induction period. These subnormal serum cortisol concentrations generally increased spontaneously to within normal resting range 2 to 6 weeks after cessation of mitotane. In 184 dogs, mitotane was continued at an initial mean maintenance dosage of 49 mg/kg administered weekly in two to three divided doses. Of these dogs, 107 had one or more relapses of hyperadrenocorticism during treatment.

This paper reports the results of much lower doses of o,p'-DDD (0.5-2 g per day) in two patients with Cushing's disease over periods of 8 and 5 years, respectively, under concomitant monitoring of the plasma levels of the parent drug and its major metabolite, o,p'-DDE. It became apparent that o,p'-DDD and o,p'-DDE have a strong tendency to accumulate in the body due to their high lipophilicity. As a consequence, changes in dose regimens had long lag times before they were reflected in plasma levels and once an increase or decrease had started one had to be careful not to cause overshoot. Steady state plasma levels of o,p'-DDD between 5-10 micrograms/ml appeared sufficient to induce and to maintain remission of the disease, which was accompanied with normal cortisol levels in plasma and urine. DDD-levels below 5 micrograms/ml for several weeks may lead to relapses, whereas DDD-levels over 10 micrograms/ml gave rise to side effects. On the other hand, o,p'-DDE seemed inactive at levels up to 4 micrograms/ml in plasma.",M1

A fraction of mixed unidentified lung cells was also able to bind o,p'-DDD while no binding was observed in alveolar macrophages. The activation of o,p'-DDD was shown to be mediated by cytochrome P-450 in both lung microsomes and isolated lung cells. In vivo, the binding was preferentially localized in the lung alveolar and bronchiolar regions.

Of these patients 49 (72 per cent) have been seen during the last 25 years. A total of 40 patients (48.8 per cent) presented with a hormonally functional tumor and 42 (51.2 per cent) had a nonfunctional tumor. Forty patients (48.8 per cent) presented with localized disease, 12 (14.6 per cent) with regional disease and 30 (36.6 per cent) with distant metastases. Complete surgical removal of all gross tumor was achieved in 49 patients. Over-all 3 and 5-year patient survival rates in this series were 37.5 and 25.1 per cent, respectively. Survival was significantly improved (43.9 per cent at 5 years, p equals 0.0001) in patients with localized disease that was completely removed surgically; postoperative adjuvant therapy with op'-<e>DDD</e> was of no benefit in these patients. Survival in patients with metastatic disease was poor and was not improved by treatment with op'-DDD, cytotoxic chemotherapy or radiation therapy.",M1
2736677,"In vitro macromolecular binding of 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (o,p'-<e>DDD</e>) in the mouse lung and liver.The activation and covalent binding of 14C-labelled 2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)-1,1-dichloroethane (o,p'-DDD) in mouse lung and liver S-9 preparations were examined in vitro. These results showed an oxidative cytochrome P-450 mediated transformation of o,p'-DDD to metabolite(s) that bind covalently to proteins, phospholipids and to added naked DNA in both lung and liver. The apparent Km-values for the covalent binding of o,p'-DDD to protein were 0.25 microM and 3.30 microM in lung and liver, respectively. Addition of glutathione to the incubation medium decreased the binding of o,p'-DDD more efficiently in the liver than in the lung. Thus, the selective lung binding of o,p'-DDD previously observed in vivo seems to result from an in situ activation. The tissue selectivity in vivo is suggested to be due to the low apparent Km in the lung favouring bioactivation at low, ecotoxicologically relevant doses, as well as to a less pronounced protection by glutathione in the lung.",M1

Biopsy of adipose tissue in this patient showed it to be the storage site of considerable quantities of o,p'-DDD. Serum levels of o,p'-DDD determined in this patient initially four months after withdrawal of treatment and in another similar case three months after withdrawal were about 20 times higher than those found in untreated patients and reached control values only about 20 months later. Repeated evaluation of plasma and urinary free cortisol failed to reveal any correlation with the serum levels of o,p'-DDD, suggesting that the drug blood values cannot be used as a reliable indicator of the therapeutic effect on the adrenal gland. The histopathological examination of the embryo, aged about 42 days, revealed a dysmorphogenic event in the cortical primordia characterized by pycnotic sympathoblasts. It is suggested that such a toxic effect of o,p'-DDD on the embryonic cortical cells may act indirectly, affecting the viability of the migrating sympathoblasts.",M1

The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC) was measured by radioimmunoassay immediately before and 1 hour after adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) administration (0.5 IU/kg, intravenously [IV]). PACs increased significantly when ACTH was administered to normal dogs. Dogs with PDH had a lower baseline PAC, but their PAC increased to levels similar to that of normal dogs after ACTH administration. In dogs with PDH controlled by o,p'-DDD therapy, the response to ACTH was significantly less than that of normal dogs or dogs with untreated PDH. Dogs with iatrogenic hyperadrenocorticism had a lower baseline and post-ACTH PAC than normal dogs. Dogs with hypoadrenocorticism had a normal basal PAC, but showed no significant increase in PAC following ACTH administration. These findings suggest that PACs are significantly altered in a variety of adrenal diseases, and that the ACTH stimulation test may be useful when evaluating aldosterone secretion in adrenopathic disorders.

However, the effects of o,p'-DDD on gonadal steroidogenesis are still unknown. In the present study, the effects of o,p'-DDD on Plasma cortisol, pregnenolone, 17 alpha-hydroxypregnenolone (17-OH-pregnenolone), progesterone, 17 alpha-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OH-progesterone), 11-deoxycorticosterone (DOC), corticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), delta 4-androstenedione (androstenedione), estradiol, and LH and FSH were investigated in 3 patients with Cushing's disease before and after the administration of o,p'-DDD. The results are presented here. In Case 1 (18 yr old female) who had had secondary amenorrhea for 2 years, the plasma levels of cortisol, pregnenolone, 17-OH-pregnenolone, DHEA, androstenedione, testosterone, estradiol and corticosterone were elevated. The basal levels of plasma LH and FSH and the responses of both gonadotropins were lower than those of women with eumenorrhea. The plasma levels of progesterone, DHEA and testosterone decreased to normal 2 months after the beginning of the administration of o,p'-DDD. She restored menstrual cycles ranging from 40 to 50 days 3 months after the administration of o,p'-DDD, but with anovulatory bleeding. She showed a biphasic body temperature pattern with plasma progesterone and estradiol levels indicating corpus luteum formation 11 months after the start of the treatment, when plasma cortisol as well as progesterone and androgen were reduced to normal. The basal levels of FSH and LH and responses of these gonadotropins were slightly improved at that time. The plasma levels of cortisol, DHEA and androstenedione were high in Case 2 (38 yr old male) and Case 3 (45 yr old male), whereas plasma testosterone level was normal in Case 2 and low in Case 3. The plasma levels of these 3 steroids were normalized 28 days after the beginning of the o,p'-DDD administration.

Eleven months later, Cushing's syndrome recurred. His CT scan showed a left adrenal gland that was enlarged and a normal-sized right adrenal gland. However, the NP-59 image showed increased uptake by both glands. Venous effluent was sampled from each adrenal vein. The plasma cortisol level from the left gland was 1392 ng/ml, and that from the right gland was 667 ng/ml. The latter value was not significantly different from the values obtained at peripheral sites (517-744 ng/ml). In the course of recovery from o,p' DDD damage, the ability of the adrenal gland to take up NP-59 may be restored before the return of its biosynthetic and secretory functions. Serial NP-59 adrenal images can anticipate the recurrence of Cushing's syndrome after adrenolytic therapy, thereby permitting early retreatment.",M1

When plasma (0.1 ml) adsorbed to and dried on a filter paper was heated with 5% hydrogen chloride in methanol (1 ml) in a boiling water bath, o,p'-DDD and its metabolites were liberated from the serum protein and were able to be easily extracted with benzene. The recovery rate was raised compared with conventional methods. In addition, this procedure also carried out the simultaneous methylation of o,p'-DDA, one of the metabolites. Mass numbers of 199, 210, 235 and 246 were selected from the mass spectra of o,p'-DDD and its related substances, and they were monitored. Identification was performed on the basis of the retention time and the mass peak intensity ratio. Quantitative determination was performed using the internal standard technique.

Both patients developed hypoadrenalism while on o,p'-DDD and apparently adequate dexamethasone replacement therapy. The hypoadrenalism was overcome by increasing steroid replacement therapy. Dexamethasone levels were measured in the serum by radioimmunoassay and shown to be lowered by o,p'-DDD therapy. A study of the absorption and disappearance of dexamethasone from the circulation in response to a (1 mg oral dose indicated that the steroid was absorbed normally but was cleared more rapidly from the circulation of these two patients than from normal controls. This may be due to a change in the type of metabolites excreted. It is suggested that many of the reported side-effects of o,p'-DDD may be due to hypoadrenalism and may be controlled by greatly increasing the steroid replacement dose. The adequacy of corticosteroid replacement therapy may best be assessed by monitoring the levels of ACTH.",M1

The drug was given by mouth at 50 mg kg-1 and plasma o,p'-DDD concentrations were determined by gas-liquid chromatography. First, six normal dogs were given the drug three times at intervals of one week in a Latin square pattern. Systemic drug availability was found to be very poor from intact tablets in fasted dogs, better with pure drug dissolved in maize oil given by stomach tube, and best with ground tablets mixed in oil poured on dog food. Then six normal dogs and five with PDH were given one dose of o,p'-DDD as intact tablets in dog food. Systemic drug availability was good in the normal animals and, for unknown reasons, better in dogs with PDH. The half-time of elimination was shorter in dogs with PDH than in normal ones. There was evidence of a gradual rise in plasma o,p'-DDD concentrations in seven dogs with PDH treated with 25 mg kg-1 every 12 hours for 14 or 20 days. The interaction between food and o,p'-DDD probably contributes to the variation in clinical response of dogs treated with the drug.

Ultrastructural and toxicity studies were conducted with male Hartley outbred guinea pigs given 300 mg/kg/day ip for 14 days. Profound mitochondrial damage in the guinea pig adrenal cortex, an index of Lysodren's action as a cancer chemotherapeutic, reversible necrosis of the zona fasciculata and zona reticularis with swelling, disrupted cristae, and organelles destroyed in the mitochondria from these areas. Yet guinea pigs given Mitometh tolerated the drug better than those given an equivalent amount of Lysodren. In general the animals treated with Mitometh showed less alopecia, diarrhea, and weakness. The only deaths recorded in our study were in the Lysodren group. In addition po administration of these two drugs to male Sprague-Dawley rats and male Hartley guinea pigs for 4 days allowed for a direct comparison of urinary metabolites. Metabolites were identified from urine extracts by computerized mass spectrometry interfaced with capillary gas chromatography. Both compounds were shown to undergo dehydrohalogenation and side-chain cleavage to a limited extent; however, only Lysodren afforded side-chain oxidation metabolites. In fact, the dominant metabolite from Lysodren biotransformation was the corresponding carboxylic acid o,p'-DDA (III). On the other hand, Mitometh resisted side-chain oxidative metabolism and was less toxic than Lysodren. Therefore, when given to guinea pigs and rats, Mitometh had Lysodren-like biologic activity, did not undergo rapid inactivation, and was less toxic than Lysodren. Mitometh represents a potential alternative to Lysodren which should be investigated further for its possible use in the treatment of adrenal cortical carcinoma and Cushing's syndrome.",M1

It has a remarkable specificity for the adrenal cortex and can produce necrosis of that organ; consequently, it has been used as a therapeutic agent for adrenocortical carcinoma. Because of the similarity between adrenocortical and testicular tissue, mitotane could be expected to cause testicular damage; however, there is sparse support for this in the literature. We recently studied a patient who developed impotency due to primary testicular failure at the time that he was treated with mitotane. A testicular biopsy, performed about four months after the drug was discontinued, showed normal appearing Leydig cells and atrophy of the seminiferous tubules with the picture of a maturation arrest. In the four and one half years since he last received mitotane, the patient's libido has slowly improved and his plasma testosterone, gonadotropins and LH response to gonadotropin-releasing hormone have become essentially normal.

A 52-year-old woman, who had a huge adrenocortical carcinoma and pulmonary metastasis, was treated by a low-dose administration of o, p'-DDD, which reduced the tumor size. The excretion of urinary 17-OHCS was decreased, whereas plasma cortisol was not decreased but rather increased. This was considered to be caused that o, p'-DDD functioned as a cytotoxic factor which did not improve the states of hyperkalemia, hyperglycemia and hypertension.

Exhaustive extraction of lung tissue showed that a large fraction of the radioactivity was covalently bound to protein. Covalent binding in liver was 20-30 times lower and represented a smaller fraction of the total radioactivity present in this tissue. Formation of a cytochrome P-450 catalysed reactive metabolite in lung and liver was indicated by a decreased covalent binding in these tissues in mice pretreated with metyrapone. Both beta-naphthoflavone (beta NF) and phenobarbital (PB) pretreatment decreased binding of o,p'-DDD in lung tissue, while binding in the liver was induced by PB but remained unaffected by beta NF. Pretreatment with high doses of o,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDT gave a significantly decreased binding of o,p'-[14C]DDD in lung, whereas binding in liver remained unchanged. Conjugation with glutathione does not appear to be a major inactivation pathway for the reactive lung metabolite, since a high dose of o,p'-DDD did not deplete non-protein thiols (NPSH) in lung tissue. Pretreatment with o,p'-DDD decreased the N-demethylation of [dimethyl-14C]aminopyrine in both lung and liver in a dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the drug-metabolizing enzyme system may be a target for o,p'-DDD in vivo.",M1

The reaction required NADPH and was inhibited by dioxygen and carbon monoxide, which shows that the reaction is catalyzed by cytochromes P-450. Moreover, when the reaction was studied in the presence of deuterium oxide, no deuterium was incorporated into the DDD, which suggests that a one-electron reduction of DDT to the 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethyl radical followed by hydrogen atom abstraction accounts for the formation of DDD. The microsomal reduction of DDT to DDD was stimulated markedly by several thiols, including glutathione. The stimulatory effect of thiols was concentration dependent and was not due to conservation of cytochrome P-450, because nonthiol antioxidants failed to stimulate the reaction. The mechanism of the stimulation is not understood, but thiols do not promote the formation of DDD by preventing the alkylation of microsomal lipids and, thereby, stimulating the formation of a reduced alkane. Finally, these results show that soluble, low-molecular weight compounds may enhance the activity of membrane-bound enzymes.",M1

Biochemical investigations cannot absolutely distinguish pituitary from ectopic sources of ACTH and therefore body CT scanning and percatheter venous sampling are essential diagnostic investigations. Tumour localization may result in resection and complete cure, although even small tumours may have a malignant potential.

Before o,p'-DDD treatment, plasma cortisol, urinary 17OHCS, and urinary free cortisol were elevated in all patients. These parameters correlated well with each other in ectopic ACTH-syndrome and Cushing's disease. However, in adrenal cancer, urinary 17OHCS did not correlate with either plasma cortisol or urinary free cortisol, while the latter two parameters did. During o,p'-DDD, urinary 17OHCS rapidly declined in a patient with ectopic ACTH syndrome and a patient with Cushing's disease before plasma cortisol or urinary free cortisol decreases. Consequently the positive correlations of urinary 17OHCS with the other parameters were lost. In a case of adrenal cancer, urinary 17OHCS again did not correlate with plasma cortisol or urinary free cortisol. In these conditions, plasma cortisol and urinary free cortisol still significantly correlated. The present results demonstrated the limit of urinary 17OHCS as the index of the cortisol secretion rate both in some cases of adrenal cancer and in patients taking o,p'-DDD.

The inhibitory effect of this drug on the adrenal steroid biosynthesis has been described by many authors, but there are very few reports about the sites of action of this drug on adrenal steroid synthesis. This paper presents in vitro studies on adrenal steroidogenesis and hepatic steroid metabolism. The effects of o,p'-DDD on adrenal 3 beta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase (3 beta-HSD), 11 beta-hydroxylase (11 beta-OHlase) and 18-hydroxylase (18-OHlase) were examined in vitro using mitochondrial and microsomal fractions prepared by standard centrifugation procedures from the homogenate of bovine adrenal cortices. The concentrations of o,p'-DDD inducing 50% inhibition of 3 beta-HSD, 11 beta-OHlase and 18-OHlase were 8 X 10(-6) M, 1 X 10(-5) M and 3 X 10(-6) M, respectively. This study clearly demonstrates the marked inhibitory effects of o,p'-DDD on 3 beta-HSD in vitro, which was not described previously. The inhibitory effects of o,p'-DDD on these 3 enzymes were diminished by an addition of 0.05 approximately 0.5 mM of cofactor (NADPH or NAD). The results indicate that o,p'-DDD may reduce NADPH or NAD utilization, resulting in the inhibition of steroidogenesis. The effects of o,p'-DDD on hepatic 5 beta-reductase were examined in vitro using rat liver homogenate. O,p'-DDD inhibits 5 beta-reductase, resulting in the decrease of conversion of cortisol to dihydrocortisol and tetrahydrocortisol at the concentration of 10(-3) M.",M1

20390871,"Accumulation of environmental estrogens in adipose tissue of breast cancer patients.Although the estrogenic properties of numerous chloroorganic pesticides have been widely recognized, population studies do not give clear results indicating the link between the exposure to these compounds and breast cancer development. Because of the weak affinity of these pesticides to estrogen receptors, they probably act by affecting the expression of CYP genes encoding cytochromes P450 engaged in the metabolism of environmental as well as natural estrogens. To examine the possible correlation between environmental estrogen levels in adipose tissue and breast cancer stage, grade, receptor status and onset of the disease, adipose tissue was isolated from 54 breast cancer patients and 23 healthy individuals. Clinical characteristics were obtained from the medical records, while the information concerning exposure to environmental estrogens where obtained from questionnaires. The environmental estrogens were identified and quantified by GC-chromatography. The data was analyzed with the use of Student t-test and Spearman correlation. The levels of most environmental estrogens did not differ between the patients and the controls, except the beta-HCH (beta-hexachlorocyclohexane) level, which was higher in the patients than in the healthy individuals. Significantly higher levels of DDE (1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethene) and DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenol)ethane) (P &lt; 0.05) were observed in the patients with late onset of the disease which was probably due to the time of exposure. Moreover, in the patients exposed to environmental estrogens, significantly higher concentrations of <e>DDD</e> (1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-2,2-dichloroethane) were found (P &lt; 0.05). We also evidenced that estrogen-independent cancer was more frequent in the patients exposed to numerous risk factors in which higher levels of HCB (hexachlorobenzene), gamma-HCH (gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane), DDD and DDT in adipose tissue were detected. Breast cancer development is probably related to the accumulation of DDT and its derivatives, but the effect appears only in older patients. We postulate that environmental estrogens acting together with other risk factors might influence the progress and exacerbate the prognosis of breast cancer.",M2

Their presence may be attributed to adulteration of pesticides which are not banned and also atmospheric deposition.",M2
19943656,"Triple domain in situ sorption modeling of organochlorine pesticides, polychlorobiphenyls, polyaromatic hydrocarbons, polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins, and polychlorinated dibenzofurans in aquatic sediments.Here we analyze the potential of black carbon (BC) and oil-inclusive models to explain in situ sorption of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (<e>DDD</e>), organochlorine pesticides (OCP), polychlorobiphenyls (PCB), polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins (PCDD), and polychlorinated dibenzofurans (PCDF) to harbor sediments. Such models are important to understand bioavailability and mobility limitations of these chemicals in the aquatic environment. Separate BC- or oil-inclusive models have been described before. However, it is unclear whether oil could dominate in situ sorption in sediments that also contain BC, and whether the relative importance of phases would differ for different compounds. A BC- and oil-inclusive model was evaluated against chemical data and measured sediment characteristics. Parameter uncertainty was assessed using Monte Carlo simulations. Fitted model parameters were consistent with literature data and were satisfactory from a statistical as well as a chemical perspective. Sorption to oil was strong, proportional to octanol-water partitioning (Log K(ow)) and of similar magnitude for OCP, PCB, PCDD, and PCDF. For PAH a single oil sorption coefficient was found. Oil dominated sorption only for PCBs, at oil levels above 50-250 mg oil/kg sediment. BC dominated sorption of most other compounds, especially high molecular PAHs, PCDD, and PCDFs.",M2
19846197,"Anaerobic biodegradation of organochlorine pesticides in contaminated soil - significance of temperature and availability.Anaerobic biodegradation of the pesticides: gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane, methoxychlor, o,p'- and p,p'-DDT in field polluted soil was tested at 12, 22 and 30 degrees C, using methanogenic granular sludge as inoculum. The contaminants were removed quite effectively at all temperatures and their removal rates increased 1.2-1.7 times with the increase in temperature. In most cases pesticide concentrations after an initial substantial decline remained almost constant until the end of experiment. These residual concentrations were also temperature dependent and they were 1.4-8.2 times higher at 12 degrees C than at 30 degrees C. DDT was degraded via <e>DDD</e> and accumulation of this metabolite was lower (19-64%) than the corresponding amount of removed DDT, especially at higher temperatures. Further transformation of DDD was confirmed by formation of p,p'-dichlorobenzophenone. Additional experiment demonstrated that removal was limited to readily desorbing fractions of pesticides, while their desorption-resistant fractions persisted in the soil. However, DDD metabolite was only partially removed despite its good desorbability.",M2
19709715,"Occurrence and distribution of organochlorine pesticides (OCPs) in surface sediments of the Bohai Sea, China.Fifty-five surface sediment samples covering virtually the entire Bohai Sea (Bohai) were analyzed for organochlorine pesticides (OCPs), in order to provide the extensive information of recent occurrence levels, distribution, possible sources and potential biological risk of these compounds in this area. Concentrations of total dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) and hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) in Bohai ranged widely from 0.24 to 5.67ngg(-1) (mean 1.36+/-0.93ngg(-1)) and 0.16 to 3.17ngg(-1) (mean 0.83+/-0.57ngg(-1)), respectively. High concentrations of DDTs were observed in the coastal areas especially at the isolated sites neighboring the harbor or port regions. The recent DDT inputs could be mainly attributed to the agricultural activity (e.g. dicofol), wastewater of chemical plants and the usage of antifouling paint. The distribution pattern of HCHs was different from that of DDTs due to their different physical-chemical properties and amounts of production and usage in the past. (DDE+<e>DDD</e>)/DDT ratios indicated that the degradation of the parent DDT occurred significantly. The contributions of previous and current inputs of pesticides in the coastal areas were distinguished by means of principal component analysis, suggesting that the recent usage of DDT and technical chlordane could serve as important fresh input sources for OCPs. DDTs and chlordanes are the two-main species of OCPs with more ecotoxicological concern in Bohai.",M2

The overall pattern of accumulation of OCPs was observed as sigmaHCH&gt; sigmaDDT&gt; sigmaEndosulfan&gt;Aldrin. The occurrence of alphaHCH was found to be frequent in all the samples. The leaf and root samples showed better uptake of organochlorine pesticides whereas lower concentration levels of OCPs was observed in case of sediment samples. The mean concentration of OCPs was observed highest in case of root samples. This study indicated towards the capability of A. marina in bioaccumulation of the OCPs. The present data will serve as the baseline against which future study of OCPs uptake in the mangrove plant species may be assessed.",M2
19487035,"Biokinetics and biotransformation of DDTs in the marine green mussels Perna viridis.The biokinetics of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites, p,p'-dichlorodiphenydichloroethylene (DDE) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>), in the green-lipped mussel Perna viridis were characterized in this study. We exposed the mussels to DDT in aqueous or dietary sources and then compared and evaluated the absorption, accumulation, distribution and elimination of DDT and its metabolites (DDD and DDE) in the mussels. In addition, a dynamic model was employed to quantify the depuration kinetics of each DDT compound in various organs of the mussels. The potential biotransformation pathway in the mussels after dietary exposure to DDT was also analyzed. Differing accumulation and elimination patterns of each DDT compound (DDT, DDD and DDE) in various organs were observed. Most of the DDT was confined to the hepatopancreas following either aqueous or dietary exposure, although the biological fate and biokinetics of DDT were differed significantly between routes of exposure. In addition, the elimination of dietary DDT was markedly slower than that following aqueous uptake. The biotransformation of DDT to DDE was rare in the mussels, suggesting that any DDE in the mussels came primarily from the ambient environment instead of through biotransformation process. Nevertheless, DDE may be retained in the mussels because of its exceptionally low elimination rate. In contrast, DDT was biotransformed to DDD in the mussels following dietary uptake, and this biotransformation may facilitate DDT elimination from the mussels.",M2
19168270,"Occurrence, source diagnosis, and biological effect assessment of DDT and its metabolites in various environmental compartments of the Pearl River Delta, South China: a review.This review summarizes and analyzes available data in the literature (mostly after 2000) on the occurrence of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its main metabolites, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>) and chlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), in the environment of the Pearl River Delta (PRD), South China. Generally, the concentration levels of the sum of DDT, DDD, and DDE, designated as DDTs thereafter, have not significantly declined since 1983. However, the composition of DDTs residues has changed with time. DDTs in soil, freshwater sediment and freshwater fish species were mainly residues from chronological use. There is evidence that new point sources, such as dicofol and anti-fouling paint, may have contributed DDTs to various environmental compartments. Risk assessment against existing criteria indicated that the levels of DDTs in water and some fish species may pose adverse effects to humans or wildlife, and those in sediment/soil may also cause negative impacts to the eco-environment of the PRD.",M2
19117651,"Detection of DDT and its metabolites in two estuaries of South China using a SPME-based device: first report of p,p'-DDMU in water column.A solid-phase microextration-based sampling method was employed to determine the concentrations of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and its metabolites, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (<e>DDD</e>), 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene (DDE) and 1-chloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethene (DDMU), in two estuarine bays, Daya Bay and Hailing Bay, of South China. Six DDT components including p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-DDMU were detected in Hailing Bay, while only p,p'-DDD was found in Daya Bay. p,p'-DDD was the most abundant DDT component in both bays, sharply different from the previous finding in the water column of the Palos Verdes Shelf, California, USA that p,p'-DDE was prevalent. In addition, the occurrence of p,p'-DDMU (with a range of 0.047-0.21 ng/L in Hailing Bay) has not been reported around the globe, and its presence in our study region appeared to stem from dehydrochlorination of p,p'-DDD, favored under aerobic conditions, but further investigations are clearly needed to confirm the mechanism for generation of DDMU in estuarine environments.",M2
18704726,"Tiered aquatic ecological risk assessment of organochlorine pesticides and their mixture in Jiangsu reach of Huaihe River, China.A tiered approach consisting of several probabilistic options was used to refine aquatic ecological risk assessment (ERA) of individuals and mixture of various Organochlorine Pesticides (OCPs) detected in Jiangsu reach of Huaihe River, China. The tiered approach ranged from determined Hazard Quotient (HQ) to Joint Probability Curve and Monte Carlo simulation based HQ-distribution. The results from all levels of ERA methods in the tiered framework are consistent with each other. The results show that Endrin, o,p'-Dichloro-Diphenyl-Trichloroethane (DDT), alpha-Endosulfan and beta-Endosulfan posed clear ecological risk; p,p'-DDT, p,p'-<e>DDD</e>, Aldrin, Heptachlorepoxide and Methoxychlor posed potential risk; while Hexachlorocyclohexanes, Heptachlor, Dieldrin and Hexachlorobenzene posed negligible risk. Further, based on the concept of total equivalent concentration, combined ecological risk caused by the mixture of all detected OCPs was calculated, and it proved to be significantly higher than the risk caused by any individual OCP. Despite inevitable uncertainties in current ERA, a comprehensive tiered approach can help to get a more credible result of risks of individuals and mixture of hazardous pollutants and screen the major risk pollutants contributing to the combined ecological risk.",M2
18665984,"Placental transfer of DDT in mother-infant pairs from Northern Thailand.The present study objective was to investigate ratios and correlation coefficients between dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) compounds in cord and maternal sera of mother-infant pairs from northern Thailand. The study site was located in Chiang Dao District of Chiang Mai Province which was an agricultural and former malaria endemic area. DDT compounds were analyzed in 88 cord and maternal serum samples using gas chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD). p,p'-DDE (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene) was the major component and detected in every cord and maternal serum samples with geometric means of 1,255 and 1,793 n g(-1) lipids, respectively. p,p'-DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) was detected at 89.8 and 100% of cord and maternal serum samples, respectively. The second and third highest levels detected were p,p'-<e>DDD</e> (1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane) and p,p'-DDT, respectively. The ratios between cord and maternal sera for p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDD that were less than 1 had high correlation coefficients (ratio = 0.70, r = 0.82 for p,p'-DDE, ratio = 0.62, r = 0.66 for p,p'-DDT, and ratio = 0.79, r = 0.78 for p,p'-DDD). The high correlation coefficients indicate that cord serum levels of DDT compounds could be accurately estimated from maternal serum levels. It can be concluded that cord serum levels of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, and p,p'-DDD were approximately 70%, 62%, and 79% of maternal serum levels, respectively. Furthermore, our findings can be applied in public health to monitor and evaluate risk among infants from high DDT exposure area.",M2
18663399,"DDT, DDE and <e>DDD</e> in human milk from South Africa.Human breast milk samples (n=30) were collected from mothers within the age range of 19-40 years from Thohoyandou area, South Africa. DDT and its metabolites were extracted from the milk samples using diethyl ether. The crude extracts were subjected to column chromatography. The eluates were then evaporated on a stream of nitrogen up to 0.5 mL. One microliter of the cleaned extracts were injected into GC-ECD for selected organochlorine compounds. The sum total of DDT and its metabolites from each village ranged from not detectable for DMS, GNN and THN to 1,930 ng g(-1) fat wt for BDL while SigmaDDE ranged from 1.32 ng g(-1) fat wt for GNN to 2,570 ng g(-1) fat wt for TKD. SigmaDDD ranged from not detectable for GNN to 4,060 ng g(-1) fat wt for MNN. SigmaDDE was the most predominant followed by SigmaDDD and finally SigmaDDT. This was an indication of breakdown of the parent compound, DDT. Some villages namely, Lufule and Budeli, and Maniini and Makhuvha exhibited similar DDT occurrence of 89% in their areas. Other villages, DMS, TLM, and MND and TKD showed a similarity percentage of 82% while others showed similarities of 75% for GNN and MTT, 69% and 65% for MPG and THN respectively. A significant cluster of DDT and its metabolites between the infants' weight range of 2.5-3.9 kg/body wt was observed. Increase in lipid content was followed by a decrease in the sum DDT in the older mothers (27-30). The estimated daily intake varied from 260 to 4,696 ng/g, nd-10,551 ng/g and nd-4,237 ng/g for DDE, DDD and DDT respectively. These values are significantly (p&lt;0.05) higher than the FAO/WHO acceptable daily intake (ADI) of 20 ng/g. The SigmaDDT was found to decrease with increasing age of the mothers. The observed high levels of DDE compared to DDT indicated chronic exposure of the mothers to DDT, which is metabolised to DDE and retained in the body.",M2

A glasshouse study was undertaken to assess the uptake of weathered SigmaDDT {sum of the p, p'- and o, p-isomers of DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2- bis( p-chlorophenyl)ethane], DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2- bis( p-chlorophenyl)ethylene] and <e>DDD</e>[1,1-dichloro-2,2- bis( p-chlorophenyl)ethane]}, arsenic (As), cadmium (Cd), copper (Cu), and lead (Pb) residues by lettuce ( Lactuca sativa) and radish ( Raphanus sativus) from field-aged New Zealand horticultural soils. Concentrations of SigmaDDT, DDT, DDE, Cd, Cu, and Pb in lettuce increased with increasing soil concentrations. In radish, similar relationships were observed for SigmaDDT, DDE, and Cu. The bioaccumulation factors were less than 1 with the exception of Cd and decreased with increasing soil concentrations. Lettuce Cd concentrations for plants grown on four out of 10 assayed soils were equivalent to or exceeded the New Zealand food standard for leafy vegetables of 0.1 mg kg (-1) fresh weight. Concentrations of As, Pb, and SigmaDDT did not exceed available food standards. Overall, these results demonstrate that aged residues of SigmaDDT, As, Cd, Cu, and Pb in horticultural soils have remained phytoavailable. To be protective of human health, site-specific risk assessments and soil guideline derivations for residential settings with vegetable gardens need to consider the produce consumption pathway.",M2

In this study, eleven plants including eight maize (Zea mays) cultivars and three forage species (alfalfa, ryegrass and teosinte) widely cultivated in China were grown in the soils spiked with DDTs to investigate their potential for removal of DDT from the contaminated soils. The plants varied largely in their ability to accumulate and translocate DDTs, with the bioconcentration factor (BCF; DDT concentration ratio of the plant tissues to the soils) ranging from 0.014 to 0.25 and the translocation factor (TF; DDT concentration ratio of the shoots to the roots) varying from 0.35 (Zea mays cv Chaotian-23) to 0.76 (Zea mays spp. mexicana). The amount of DDT phytoextraction ranged from 3.89mug (ryegrass) to 27.0mug (teosinte) and accounted for &lt;0.1% of the total initial DDTs spiked in the soils. After 70d, the removal rates reached 47.1-70.3% of the total initial DDTs spiked in the soils with plants while that was only 15.4% in the soils without plant. Moreover, the higher removal rates of DDTs occurred at the first 20d of experiment, and then the removal rate decreased with time. The highest amount of DDTs phytoextracted was observed in teosinte, followed by Zea mays spp. mexicana, but the highest removal rate of DDTs was found in maize (Zea mays cv Jinhai-6). Even though phytoextraction is not the main removal process for DDTs, the plant species especially Zea mays cv Jinhai-6 showed high potential for removing DDTs from the contaminated soils.",M2
18384238,"Uptake, elimination, and biotransformation of aqueous and dietary DDT in marine fish.To understand the biokinetics and potential risks of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) and p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>), in fish, we exposed the black sea breams (Acanthopagrus schlegeli) to aqueous and dietary DDTs and then evaluated the bioaccumulation, distribution, biotransformation, and elimination of DDTs under controlled laboratory conditions. The fish rapidly accumulated DDTs from both routes of exposure, particularly the gills and viscera. Elimination of DDTs following aqueous or dietary uptake was slow, and biotranslocation of DDTs was significant during the exposure period but negligible during the depuration period. The biotransformation process was more significant following dietary exposure. During depuration, DDE was the major biotransformed product in the sea breams' carcasses while DDD was the major product in the gills and viscera. However, DDD had a significantly higher elimination rate than DDE and, subsequently, the fish retained more DDE in the body. Intraspecies variability in the elimination and biotransformation processes in fish was observed. We demonstrated that the route of exposure significantly affected the fate and biokinetics of DDTs in fish. The application of a dynamic model provided a tool for quantifying the elimination and biotransformation of DDT in fish. The present study provided insights into the bioaccumulation and biotransformation pathways of DDT in fish that could have important ecotoxicological implications.",M2

Results show that DDE/<e>DDD</e> is slightly increased, and only about 20 ng x g(-1) DDMU or DDMS could be found in ryegrass soil at the end of the experiment. However, the DDD, DDMS and DDMU are formed very rapidly in rice soil. By the 84th day of the experiment of rice planting, DDT residue is 70-80 ng x g(-1), about 2% of the concentration added at the first of the experiment, meanwhile, concentrations of DDD, DDMS and DDMU are increased to the highest level. Concentration of DDMS and DDMU is detected at 28 and 115 ng x g(-1) respectively. On the other hand, above phenomena are not observed in the aged DDT of soils, which implies that submerging could increase degradation of DDT added newly to DDD and DDMS/DDMU, but not for the aged DDT of soils.",M2
18160094,"Residues of 18 organochlorine pesticides in 30 traditional Chinese medicines.We analyzed 30 different traditional Chinese medicines (TCMs) to determine levels of contamination with organochlorine pesticides (OCPs). We tested for 18 pesticides: benzene hexachloride (BHC, including alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, gamma-BHC, delta-BHC), heptachlor, heptachlor epoxide, tecnazene, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), hexachlorobenzene, aldrin, methyl pentachlorophenyl sulphide (MPCPS), alpha-endosulfan, trans-chlorodane, cis-chlorodane, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-<e>DDD</e>, and p,p'-DDT. The sample extracts were analyzed by GC-ECD. A total of 280 samples of 30 different TCMs were analyzed. Our results showed that 75.8% of samples contained at least one of the above pesticides. The pesticides detected were tecnazene, hexachlorobenzene, PCNB, heptachlor, aldrin, alpha-BHC, beta-BHC, gamma-BHC, delta-BHC, p,p'-DDE, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD p,p'-DDT. More than 50% of samples contained alpha-BHC (55.8%) and PCNB (55.8%); hexachlorobenzene was detected in 40.9% of samples, tecnazene in 19.5%, gamma-BHC in 16.7% and p,p'-DDE in 16.0%. Less than 10% of samples contained beta-BHC, delta-BHC, heptachlor, aldrin, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDD. None of the 280 samples contained heptachlor epoxide, MPCPS, alpha-endosulfan, trans-chlorodane, or cis-chlorodane. Concentrations of OCPs in four samples exceeded the maximum allowable residue limits (MRLs) specified in the PRC Pharmacopoeia 2005. The results indicate that the most common contaminants among the 280 samples were alpha-BHC, PCNB, hexachlorobenzene, and tecnazene. Our results suggest that contamination of TCMs with OCPs is widespread. The MRLs for other OCPs commonly found in TCMs (e.g. hexachlorobenzene and tecnazene) should be set as quickly as possible, and the MRLs of OCPs in other TCMs should be established.",M2
18092878,"Residues of DDTs and their spatial distribution characteristics in soils from the Yangtze River Delta, China.Organochlorine pesticides were used extensively in the Yangtze River Delta, China. However, knowledge about their residual levels and environmental fates in soils of this area is limited. This paper presents the residue isomers and spatial pattern of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) in soils across 17 main cities in the Yangtze River Delta. Forty-three soil surface (0-15 cm) samples were collected during a field campaign conducted in October 2003 in the Delta. Six DDT isomers (1-[2-chlorophenyl]-1-[4-chlorophenyl]-2,2-dichloroethane [o,p'-<e>DDD</e>], 1-[2-chlorophenyl]-1-[4-chlorophenyl]-2,2-dichloroethylene [o,p-'DDE], 1,1,1-trichloro-2-[p-chlorophenyl]-2-[o-chlorophenyl]ethane [o,p'-DDT], p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane [p,p'-DDD], p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene [p,p'-DDE], p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane [p,p'-DDT]) were detected using gas chromatography. The results show that p,p'-DDE was the dominant isomer in the soil samples. The levels of DDT are generally low in soils of this area and are comparable to DDT levels in other cities in China and in soils from developed countries such as the United States and Germany. The isomer ratios of o,p'-DDT to p,p'-DDT and DDT to (DDD + DDE) were employed to identify the source of DDT. The computed ratios implied that the source of DDT might be related to the application of dicofol, an acaricide manufactured from technical DDTs and mainly used on cotton fields to treat mites.",M2
18092858,"Organochlorine pesticides in the surface water and sediments of the Pearl River Estuary, South China.Samples of surface water, suspended particulate matter (SPM), and surface sediment, collected from the Pear River Estuary, Guangdong Province, China in July of 2002 and April of 2003, were analyzed for hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) and dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethanes (DDTs) using gas chromatography with electron capture detection. The levels of total HCHs in water varied from 213 to 3,116 pg/L, although in sediments they ranged from 181 to 1,388 pg/g dry weight. The levels of DDTs were in the range of 228 to 3,284 pg/L in water and 57 to 2,244 pg/g dry weight in sediments, respectively. The observed spatial and temporal variability of concentrations of the target compounds in water body could be attributed to the differences of SPM contents in water body and organic carbon contents in SPM between the two sampling periods. Seven of the 10 water samples collected in July of 2002 had the ratio of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane/(dichlorobischlorophenylethane + dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene) (DDT/[<e>DDD</e> + DDE]) higher than one, indicating that there were likely fresh inputs of DDT to the Pearl River Estuary. The significant positive correlations between the organochlorine pesticide concentrations and organic carbon contents in SPM and sediments indicated that organic matter played an important role in controlling the distributions of these pollutants in the marine environment. Varied correlations between the partition coefficients of pollutants and total organic carbon, salinity, and total SPM contents have been observed, which indicated the influences of these factors on controlling the transport and fate of pollutants in the marine environment.",M2
17854959,"Bioavailable DDT residues in sediments: laboratory assessment of ageing effects using semi-permeable membrane devices.We describe the reduction in bioavailability of DDT in contaminated soil after it was incubated as sediment for 365 d. Bioavailability was assessed using semi-permeable membranes. Contaminated soils from three cattle dip sites, one spiked paired uncontaminated site, and one spiked OECD standard soil were studied. Sandy soil with residues of 1880 mg/kg summation operator DDT incurred since 1962, initially had 4.6% of summation operator DDT available, reducing to 0.6% following 365 d. Clay soil (1108 mg summation operator DDT/kg) had 4.1% initially available, reducing to 0.3% after 365 d. Freshly spiked soils had a greater amount of DDT initially available (10.9%), but this reduced to 1.5% by the end of the incubation. Of the DDT congeners, both o,p'-<e>DDD</e> and p,p'-DDD were most bioavailable in the soils, but also had the most significant decrease following incubation.",M2
17497638,"Ultrastructural effects of DDT, <e>DDD</e>, and DDE on neural cells of the chicken embryo model.Human exposure to environmental compounds with estrogenic activity and the potential effects on human health is the subject of ongoing scientific debates. Their potential effects raise concern regarding neurological development after prenatal exposure. Central to this debate is the pesticide 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT). Although it has apparent low acute toxicity in mammals, DDT has a long residual persistence and laboratory research has indicated that it acts on the CNS by interfering with Na(+)/K(+) pump mechanism of the neuronal membranes, causing disruption in Ca(2+) homeostasis. Potentially this may lead to both apoptosis and necrosis. The present study investigates the effects of DDT and two of its metabolites DDD and DDE on the ultramorphology of neural cells, using a previously published chicken embryo model. Results indicate cellular swelling, budding, and increased membrane permeability for all three chemicals, accompanied by karyolysis in the DDE group (typical features of oncosis). These results support the finding of other researchers as well as the concerns of the WHO that DDT and its metabolites may cause neurotoxicity after prenatal exposure.",M2
17489278,"Complete dechlorination of DDE/<e>DDD</e> using magnesium/palladium system.Kinetic studies on the dechlorination of 1,1-dichloro-2,2 bis (4,-chlorophenyl) ethane (DDD) and 1,1,dichloro-2,2 bis (4,-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDE) in 0.05% biosurfactant revealed that the reaction follows second-order kinetics. The rate of reaction was dependent on the presence of acid, initial concentrations of the target compound, and zerovalent magnesium/tetravalent palladium. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analyses of DDE dechlorination revealed the formation of a completely dechlorinated hydrocarbon skeleton, with diphenylethane as the end product, thereby implying the removal of all four chlorine atoms of DDE. In the case of DDD, we identified two partially dechlorinated intermediates [namely, 1,1-dichloro-2, 2 bis (phenyl) ethane and 1, chloro-2, 2 bis (phenyl) ethane] and diphenylethane as the end product. On the basis of products formed from DDD dehalogenation, we propose the removal of aryl chlorine atoms as a first step. Our investigation reveals that biosurfactant may be an attractive solubilizing agent for DDT and its residues. The magnesium/palladium system is a promising option because of its high reactivity and ability to achieve complete dechlorination of DDE and DDD.",M2
17395245,"Organochlorine pesticides and metabolites in young leaves of Mangifera indica from sites near a point source in Coast region, Tanzania.Young leaves of Mangifera indica (mango tree) from nine sites were used as bioindicators of local atmospheric contamination by organochlorine pesticides and metabolites from a point source, an old storage site at Vikuge farm in Tanzania. Sample extracts were analysed by GC-ECD and GC-MS. The concentrations ranged 2.7-649 ng g(-1)p,p'-DDT, below detection limit (bdl)-290 ng g(-1) o,p'-DDT, 0.4-13 ng g(-1) p,p'-DDE, bdl to 4 ng g(-1) o,p'-DDE, 1-231 ng g(-1) p,p'-<e>DDD</e> and 0.5-55 ng g(-1) o,p'-DDD. The concentrations of other compounds were up to 3.9 ng g(-1) pentachloroanisole, 1.3 ng g(-1) alpha-HCH, 12 ng g(-1) beta-HCH and 2 ng g(-1) gamma-HCH, on fresh weight basis. The compounds p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'DDD and o,p'-DDD were found in 100% of the samples, while pentachloroanisole, o,p'-DDT and o,p'-DDE were detected in 78%, 56% and 67% of the samples, respectively. The low DDE/DDT ratios (0.01-0.20) in all samples indicate recent input of significantly non-degraded DDT from the point source. The low alpha-/gamma-HCH ratios (&lt;0.3-0.7) in most samples indicate recent input of lindane (99% gamma-HCH). The slightly high alpha-/gamma-HCH ratios in some samples might be due to photochemical or bacterial transformation of gamma-HCH to alpha-HCH, or could reflect input of technical HCH. The very strong positive correlations in the concentrations of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDE and o,p'-DDD (r=0.91-0.98, n=18, p&lt;0.01) indicate that they have a common source. The results suggest that young mango leaves are suitable bioindicators of recent inputs of organochlorine contaminants from a point source.",M2
17346719,"Investigation of the feasibility of TiO(2) nanotubes for the enrichment of DDT and its metabolites at trace levels in environmental water samples.TiO(2) nanotubes, novel nanomaterials synthesized from hydrothermal treatment, were investigated for being used as a new solid-phase extraction adsorbent with o,p'-DDT, [1,1,1-trichloro-2-(o-chlorophenyl)-2-(p-chlorophenyl)ethane, p,p'-DDT, [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane] and its principle metabolites p,p'-<e>DDD</e>, [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane] and p,p'-DDE [1,1-(2,2-dichloro-ethanylidene)-bis(4-chlorobenzene)] as the target analytes. Several factors such as eluant and its volume, the sample pH, sample volume and the flow rate of samples, were optimized. The effect of humic acid, which is often present in natural water system, was also investigated. Under the optimal conditions, lower detection limits of 0.0031, 0.0037, 0.0053 and 0.0025 ng mL(-1) for p,p'-DDD, p,p'-DDT, o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDE, respectively, were obtained. The proposed method was successfully applied to the analysis of the target compounds in several environmental water samples. Good recoveries over the range of 81.2-115% were obtained. These results indicated that titanium nanotubes had enormous potential in environmental field as a novel SPE adsorbent material.",M2
17292453,"Spatial and temporal variations and possible sources of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites in rivers in Tianjin, China.Water, suspended solid (SS) and sediment samples were collected from nine water courses in Tianjin, China and analyzed for dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites (DDXs, including o,p'-,p,p'-DDT, <e>DDD</e> and DDE). The average DDX concentrations in water, SS and sediment were 59+/-30 ng l(-1), 2690+/-1940 ng g(-1)dry wt. and 340+/-930 ng g(-1)dry wt., respectively. Due to the termination of the extensive agricultural application and industrial manufacture, DDXs in river sediment decreased by one order of magnitude since 1970's and low DDT fractions in these sediments were observed. Still, DDXs in the sediments near the outlets of the major manufacturers remained relatively high attributed to the historic input. DDXs in sediment were also positively correlated with organic matter content. Spatial distributions of DDXs in SS and water was different from that in sediment. For SS, a negative correlation between DDX concentration and SS content indicated a dilution effect in many rivers. Dissolved organic carbon content was the major factor affecting DDX concentrations in water phase. Wastewater discharged from dicofol manufacturers and likely illegal agricultural application were the primary reasons causing high DDT (DDE+DDD) ratios in SS and water.",M2
17287003,"Bioavailability to grains of rice of aged and fresh <e>DDD</e> and DDE in soils.DDT had been widely used around the world before 1980s and is still under production and use for non-agricultural purposes in China. Because of their special physicochemical properties, p,p'-DDT and its main metabolites, p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE, accumulated and persisted in the environment, presenting potential menace on biota. A green-house study was conducted to determine the bioavailability of p,p'-DDD and p,p'-DDE to grains of rice and the influences of traditional Chinese farming practices on their bioaccumulation. Paddy rice and dry rice were grown in submerged paddy soils and non-submerged upland soils, respectively. Two types of soil, Hydragric Anthrosols (An) and Hydragric Acrisols (Ac), were employed. Bioaccumulation factors (BAFs) of DDE ranged from 0.67 for rice grown in non-submerged An to 0.84 in submerged An in the control group, whilst BAFs were all below 0.04 in experimental groups. BAFs of DDD varied from 1.39 for submerged An to 2.26 for submerged Ac in original soils. In contrast, BAFs were between 0.05 for non-submerged Ac and 0.08 for submerged An in DDD-contaminated soils. Flooding seemed to have two contradictory effects on the DDE/DDD accumulation by rice: on one hand, it made the pollutants more mobile and bioavailable; while on the other hand, it enhanced the degradation and binding of POPs. Adding rice straw to the soils protected DDE from being taken up yet promoted DDD accumulation by rice. Furthermore, the distinct inorganic component of the soils might also play an important role in the environmental activities of POPs.",M2
17049464,"Florida seagrass habitat evaluation: a comparative survey for chemical quality.Contaminant concentrations were determined for media associated with 13 Florida seagrass beds. Concentrations of 10 trace metals were more commonly detected in surface water, sediment and two seagrass species than PAHs, pesticides and PCBs. Concentrations of copper and arsenic in surface water exceeded Florida aquatic life criteria more frequently than other trace elements. Total organic carbon, mercury, chromium, zinc, total chlordane, total PAHs, total PCBs, <e>DDD</e> and DDE were significantly greater in seagrass-rooted sediments than adjacent non-vegetated sediments. Total DDT, DDD, DDE, total chlordane, arsenic, copper and nickel exceeded proposed sediment quality guidelines at six of 13 grass beds. Pesticides, PAHs, and PCBs were below detection in seagrass tissues. Mercury, cadmium, nickel, lead and silver were detected in 50% or more of the tissues for Thalassia testudinum (turtle grass) and Halodule wrightii (shoal grass). Spatial, interspecific and tissue differences were usually an order of magnitude or less.",M2
17045374,"Adsorption and absorption of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and metabolites (<e>DDD</e> and DDE) by rice roots.A three-step sequential extraction procedure was applied to measure the concentrations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) on rice root surface and in root tissues collected from two sites in Tianjin. Bulk and rhizosphere soils were also analyzed. The measured DDXs in the rhizosphere soils were significantly higher than those in the bulk soils. On average, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, and p,p'-DDE in the soil accounted for 38%, 47% and 15% of the total. For total DDXs, approximately one third remained on the outer surface of the roots. The partition of DDXs between rhizosphere soil and root surface depend on contaminant affinity to soil organic matter, soil organic matter content and root specific area. A case specific equation was developed to quantitatively describe the partition of DDXs between soil and root surface.",M2
16996073,"Dechlorination of DDT, <e>DDD</e> and DDE in soil (slurry) phase using magnesium/palladium system.Mg0/Pd4+ was able to dechlorinate &gt;99% of extractable DDT (initial concentration of 10 mg DDT kg(-1) of soil) and &gt;90% of extractable DDT (initial concentration of 50 mg DDT kg(-1) of soil) in soil slurry. Mg0/Pd4+ was also found to be effective in dechlorinating of 50 mg kg(-1) DDD and DDE, in soil aged for varying time periods. GC-MS analyses revealed the formation of 1,1-diphenylethane as an end product from DDT, DDE and DDD. To the best of our knowledge this is the first report describing the application Mg0/Pd4+ system for remediation of DDT, DDD and DDE contaminated soil. We conclude that reductive dechlorination reaction catalyzed by Mg0/Pd4+ may be a promising system to remediate soil contaminated with DDT and its dechlorinated products such as DDD and DDE.",M2
16904735,"DDE-induced apoptosis in children exposed to the DDT metabolite.In a preliminary study in children we found a weak positive association between the frequency of apoptosis and the exposure to DDT and DDE (a DDT metabolite). In order to verify this information, more studies were needed with an increased number of children. Thus, the aim of the present work was to see if DDT and its metabolites were able to induce apoptosis of PBMC in exposed children. We performed a study in children living in three communities located in southern Mexico. During the year 2003, we studied a total of 61 healthy children; and during the year 2004, 57 children from the same communities were assessed. Apoptosis frequencies in PBMC in these children ranged from 0.10% to 8.30% during 2003 and from 0.12% to 16.20% during 2004, and although we detected exposure to DDT, <e>DDD</e> and DDE, significant association with apoptosis frequencies was found only with DDE blood levels (p=0.010 and 0.040 for 2003 and 2004 respectively). DNA damage and oxidative DNA damage were also studied in 2004 using the comet assay. The association between exposure to DDT or DDE and DNA damage was significant (p=0.004 and p=0.005 respectively), but the association between DDT or DDE and oxidative DNA damage and that of oxidative damage and apoptosis were not significant. Taking into account that DDE is the most persistent metabolite, it would be important to assess the effects of this DDE-induced apoptosis of PBCM in children living in areas where DDT was sprayed.",M2
16830528,"Temporal bioavailability of organochlorine pesticides and PCBs.Because PCBs and organochlorine pesticides continue to be of global concern, studies that address information gaps, such as factors and influences of spatial and temporal effects on contaminant bioavailability, are valuable. The present study focused on the spatial and temporal distribution of bioavailable organochlorine pesticides and PCBs in surface waters of a contaminated harbor. Passive sampling devices were intensively deployed adjacent to various land uses on the Willamette River, OR, including Portland Harbor and McCormick and Baxter Superfund sites, during summer and fall, extreme conditions, 2001-2004. An increase of bioavailable sigmaDDTs (sum of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-<e>DDD</e>, and p,p'-DDE) concentrations was strongly affected bythe local historic production of DDTs and temporal changes in river conditions. The increase of bioavailable p,p'-DDD and high DDD/DDE ratios observed during summer indicates conditions favoring anaerobic reductive processes. In contrast to sigmaDDTs, the bioavailable concentrations and daily loads of dieldrin and PCBs increased during fall, especially during episodic rainstorms. On the basis of the PCB congener profiles, PCB inputs from urban runoff /sewer overflows were considered likely current sources of bioavailable PCB into the Harbor. The exceedence of the U.S. national and Oregon water quality criteria was a function of the temporal variability of each bioavailable contaminant. This illustrates the impacts associated with temporal changes of bioavailable organochlorine distributions in surface waters and the significance of considering realistic temporal, bioavailability, and site-specific conditions in risk assessment and water quality management.",M2
16797570,"Using multi-walled carbon nanotubes as solid phase extraction adsorbents to determine dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane and its metabolites at trace level in water samples by high performance liquid chromatography with UV detection.Carbon nanotubes (CNTs) are a kind of new carbon-based nano-materials which have drawn great attention in many application fields. The potential of multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNTs) as solid-phase extraction (SPE) adsorbents for the preconcentration of environmental pollutants has been investigated in recent years. The goal of this work was to investigate the feasibility of MWNTs used as SPE adsorbents to enrich dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and its metabolites including 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(4'-chlorophenyl)ethane (<e>DDD</e>) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis-(4'-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDE) at trace level which are typical persistent organic pollutants in environment. Parameters that maybe influence the extraction efficiency such as the eluent volume, sample flow rate, sample pH and the sample volume were optimized in detail. The experimental results showed the excellent linear relationship between peak area and the concentration of DDT and its metabolites over the range of 0.2-60 microg L(-1), and the precisions (RSD) were 2.3-2.5% under the optimal conditions. The detection limits of proposed method could reach 4-13 ng L(-1) based on the ratio of chromatographic signal to base line noise (S/N = 3). Satisfied results were achieved when the proposed method was applied to determine the four target compounds in realworld water samples with spiked recoveries over the range of 89.7-115.5%. All these facts indicated that MWCNTs as SPE packing materials coupled to HPLC was an excellent alternative for the routine analysis of DDT and its metabolites at trace level in environment.",M2
16758288,"Use of the p,p'-<e>DDD</e>: p,p'-DDE concentration ratio to trace contaminant migration from a hazardous waste site.For approximately 50 years, beginning in the 1920s, hazardous wastes were disposed in an 11-hectare area of the Marine Corps Base (MCB) Quantico, Virginia, USA known as the Old Landfill. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and DDT compounds were the primary contaminants of concern. These contaminants migrated into the sediments of a 78-hectare area of the Potomac River, the Quantico Embayment. Fish tissue contamination resulted in the MCB posting signs along the embayment shoreline warning fishermen to avoid consumption. In this paper, we interpret total PCB (t-PCBs) and total DDT (t-DDT, sum of six DDT, DDD, and DDE isomers) data from monitoring studies. We use the ratio of p,p'-DDD to p,p'-DDE concentrations as a tracer to distinguish site-related from regional contamination. The median DDD/DDE ratio in Quantico Embayment sediments (3.5) was significantly higher than the median ratio (0.71) in sediments from nearby Powells Creek, used as a reference area. In general, t-PCBs and t-DDT concentrations were significantly higher in killifish (Fundulus diaphanus) and carp (Cyprinus carpio) from the Quantico Embayment compared with Powells Creek. For both species, Quantico Embayment fish had mean or median DDD/DDE ratios greater than one. Median ratios were significantly higher in Quantico Embayment (4.6) than Powells Creek (0.28) whole body carp. In contrast, t-PCBs and t-DDT in channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) fillets were similar in Quantico Embayment and Powells Creek collections, with median ratios of 0.34 and 0.26, respectively. Differences between species may be attributable to movement (carp and killifish being more localized) and feeding patterns (carp ingesting sediment while feeding). We recommend that environmental scientists use this ratio when investigating sites with DDT contamination.",M2
16678884,"Abiotic transformation of DDT in aqueous solutions.Significant concentrations of chlorinated pesticides such as 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) and its two main transformation products, 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (<e>DDD</e>) and 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE) are still present in soil and sediment systems more than 30 years after DDT use was banned in the United States. DDT enters waterways via the runoff from industrial point sources, agricultural lands and atmospheric deposition. We evaluated zero-valent iron (Fe(0)), ferrous sulfide (FeS), as well as combining them with hydrogen peroxide (H(2)O(2)) as viable treatment technologies for degrading DDT in an aqueous solution. Treatment of DDT with Fe(0) and FeS resulted in approximately 88% and 56% transformation of DDT within 150h, respectively. DDE production was insignificant in all systems. The DDT removal was slower with FeS than with Fe(0), but the amounts of DDD and DDE produced did not exceed baseline. Treatment with a 1:1 mixture of Fe(0)-FeS removed about 95% of the added mass of DDT within 4days and generated significant amounts of DDD and minor amounts of DDMU. When small amounts of H(2)O(2) were introduced halfway through the Fe(0) and FeS treatment times, the mass of DDT decreased by 87% and 96%, respectively, within 2days. Our results demonstrate that mixtures of Fe(0)-FeS in combination with H(2)O(2) can be used for rapid and efficient removal of DDT from aqueous solutions.",M2
16616295,"Organic contaminant loads into the Western Mediterranean Sea: estimate of Ebro River inputs.Annual input estimates for several organic contaminants from the Ebro River into the Northwestern Mediterranean Sea were carried out on the basis of monthly sampling from November 2002 to October 2003. Some organochlorine compounds (DDT and its degradation products, <e>DDD</e> and DDE, PCBs (9 congeners), HCB and gamma-HCH) were selected due to their reported occurrence in the river. Furthermore, some polar pesticides used in the Ebro Delta were also determined (atrazine, simazine, diazinon, fenitrothion and molinate). Concentrations ranged from 0.4 to 19.5 ng l(-1) for the organochlorine compounds (sum of particulate and dissolved phases) and from not detected (ND) to 170 ng l(-1) for the more polar pesticides, which were only found in the dissolved phase. The sum of PCB congeners (mean 8.9 ng l(-1)) showed the highest concentrations among the organochlorine compounds and atrazine (mean 82 ng l(-1)) among the polar pesticides. Based on the contaminant concentrations and on hydrological data, contaminant discharges into the sea were estimated amounting in total to 167 and 1,258 kg year(-1) of organochlorine compounds and polar pesticides, respectively. Furthermore, it was observed that PCBs, DDTs and HCB inputs were basically influenced by spate periods due to an increase in suspended particulate matter associated to runoff and sediment resuspension. Whereas for more water soluble contaminants, such as the agrochemicals, their seasonal use had a higher incidence in contaminant fluxes. Bulk chemical parameters such as SPM, DOC, POC, %OC, %ON and C/N ratio provided additional information on the organic matter sources. This provides a better understanding of the temporal variability of the contaminant concentrations.",M2
16570602,"Uptake by cucurbitaceae of soil-Bome contaminants depends upon plant genotype and pollutant properties.Three Cucurbitaceae, Cucurbita pepo L. subsp. pepo (cv. Black Beauty, true zucchini), Cucurbita pepo L. intersubspecific cross (cv. Zephyr, summer squash), and Cucumis sativis (cv. Marketmore, cucumber), were grown in rhizotrons containing soil contaminated with three classes of highly weathered, hydrophobic organic contaminants: (1) technical chlordane, (2) dichlorodiphenylethanes (DDT and <e>DDD</e>) and -ethene (DDE), (3) polyaromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), and heavy metal residues. Movement of the contaminants through the soil/plant system was studied by comparing contaminant concentration in the bulk soil, the rhizosphere soil pore water, the xylem sap, and aerial tissue. This permitted, for the first time, calculation of bioconcentration factors (BCFs) based on concentration in the xylem sap versus that in the rhizosphere soil pore water. The bioconcentration factors so determined for the sum of five chlordane residues (two enantiomers of trans-chlordane, TC; two enantiomers of cis-chlordane, CC; and achiral trans-nonachlor, TN) were 36, 40, and 23 for Black Beauty, Zephyr, and Marketmore, respectively. In addition, the xylem sap of each cultivar had a consistent enantioselective profile for some of the chiral chlordane components. For the sum of dichlorodiphenylethanes and -ethene, comparable BCF values were 19, 4, and 0.8, respectively. In the case of PAHs, different BCF patterns among the cultivars were noted for three- versus four-ring compounds. Similarly, movement of heavy metals was cultivar-dependent, with cadmium BCF values 9.5, 3.5, and 0.6for Black Beauty, Zephyr, and Marketmore, respectively; the analogous BCFs for zinc were 9, 11, and 2. Thus, passage from ex planta to in planta regions of the soil/plant system is dependent not only on properties of the plant, but also on those of the pollutant. Such data will provide insight into transport mechanisms of highly hydrophobic organic contaminants, as well as heavy metal contaminants, in the soil/plant system.",M2
16504356,"Organochlorine contaminants in complete clutches of Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) eggs from Belize.Seven complete clutches of Morelet's crocodile (Crocodylus moreletii) eggs were collected in northern Belize and examined for organochlorine (OC) pesticide residues.

Concentrations of individual OCs ranged from 4 ppb (ng chemical/g egg wet weight) to greater than 500 ppb. A statistical evaluation of p,p-DDE levels in three complete clutches was used to derive the minimum number of eggs needed from a clutch to precisely determine the mean p,p-DDE concentration representative of that clutch. Sample sizes of 8 (80% confidence level) and 11 (90% confidence level) were determined to yield an accurate estimate of contaminant levels in a full clutch of eggs. The statistically recommended sample size of 11 eggs (at 90% confidence level) was successfully tested on the four additional clutches.",M2
16492389,"The association between organochlorine and thyroid hormone levels in cord serum: a study from northern Thailand.It is now known that many organochlorines (OCs) act as endocrine disruptors, causing harmful effects on wildlife and humans. Several field and laboratory animal studies have reported that OCs cause adverse effects on thyroid hormone status. However, data regarding their effects on thyroid hormone status in humans are inconclusive. Because a developing fetus is especially sensitive to hormonal disruption by exposure to OCs, the adverse health effects on infants are of concern. The present study aimed to investigate the association between OC levels in maternal and cord serum, and the association between OC and thyroid hormone levels in cord serum. The study was performed with 39 mother-infant pairs from Mae Rim District of Chiang Mai Province, northern Thailand, who had normal delivery and full term gestation. Maternal blood was collected for measuring OCs and total lipids. Umbilical cord blood was collected for measuring OCs, total lipids, and thyroid hormones, including total thyroxine (TT(4)), free thyroxine (FT(4)), and thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH). 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (p,p'-DDE) had the highest level in all serum samples with a geometric mean of 1,191 ng/g lipids in maternal serum and 742 ng/g lipids in cord serum. The second highest level was that for 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-DDT), followed by 1,1-dichloro-2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-<e>DDD</e>). Levels of p,p'-DDE, p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDD, and dieldrin in maternal serum were positively associated with levels in cord serum (r = 0.86, 0.77, 0.66, and 0.60, respectively; P&lt;0.001). The important findings were that cord serum TT(4) levels were negatively associated with cord serum levels of p,p'-DDE (r = -0.37, P = 0.024), p,p'-DDT.3 (r = -0.33, P = 0.048), and 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-chlorophenyl)-2-(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (o,p'-DDE) (r = -0.76, P = 0.019). These results therefore suggest that exposure to DDT and its metabolites during fetal development may cause some effects on thyroid hormonal status in infants.",M2
16398123,"A field assessment of long-term laboratory sediment toxicity tests with the amphipod Hyalella azteca.Response of the amphipod Hyalella azteca exposed to contaminated sediments for 10 to 42 d in laboratory toxicity tests was compared to responses observed in controlled three-month invertebrate colonization exposures conducted in a pond. Sediments evaluated included a sediment spiked with dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>) or dilutions of a field sediment collected from the Grand Calumet River (GCR) in Indiana (USA) (contaminated with organic compounds and metals). Consistent effects were observed at the highest exposure concentrations (400 microg DDD/goc [DDD concentrations normalized to grams of organic carbon (goc) in sediment] or 4% GCR sediment) on survival, length, and reproduction of amphipods in the laboratory and on abundance of invertebrates colonizing sediments in the field. Effect concentrations for DDD observed for 10-d length and 42-d reproduction of amphipods (e.g., chronic value [ChV] of 66 microg DDD/goc and 25% inhibition concentration [IC25] of 68 microg DDD/ goc for reproduction) were similar to the lowest effect concentrations for DDD measured on invertebrates colonizing sediment the field. Effect concentrations for GCR sediment on 28-d survival and length and 42-d reproduction and length of amphipods (i.e., ChVs of 0.20-0.66% GCR sediment) provided more conservative effect concentrations compared to 10-d survival or length of amphipods in the laboratory or the response of invertebrates colonizing sediment in the field (e.g., ChVs of 2.2% GCR sediment). Results of this study indicate that use of chronic laboratory toxicity tests with H. azteca and benthic colonization studies should be used to provide conservative estimates of impacts on benthic communities exposed to contaminated sediments. Bioaccumulation of DDD by oligochaetes colonizing the DDD-spiked sediment was similar to results of laboratory sediment tests previously conducted with the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegates, confirming that laboratory exposures can be used to estimate bioaccumulation by oligochaetes exposed in the field.",M2

16194665,"Environmental pathways of exposure to DDT for children living in a malarious area of Chiapas, Mexico.Considering that DDT was used for control of malaria vectors in Mexico, and taking into account that the information regarding children in areas exposed to DDT is scarce, we started a research program for the assessment of health effects in children living in DDT sprayed areas. In this first report, we present information about pathways of exposure in two communities with a different history of exposure to DDT. Environmental pathways such as outdoor soils, indoor soils and household dust were assessed comparing a community highly exposed to DDT (HEC) and a community less exposed to DDT (LEC). Also in these communities, a cross-sectional study of 60 children (30 in each community) aged 6--12 years was conducted. Tests included a questionnaire and the measurement of whole blood DDT and DDE. Results show that in children living in the HEC, DDT and DDE mean blood levels were higher (15.9+/-8.2 and 58.2+/-29.2 microg/L) than in the LEC (1.9+/-3.6 and 9.2+/-5.7 microg/L) (P&lt;0.01). Concentrations of DDT, DDE and <e>DDD</e> in indoor soil were higher in the HEC (10.3+/-10; 4.9+/-5.8; and 4.4+/-9.1mg/kg) than in the LEC (0.3+/-0.3; 0.04+/-0.06; and 0.03+/-0.04 mg/kg) (P&lt;0.001). Similar results were obtained for outdoor soils; in the HEC, levels for DDT, DDE and DDD were 3.1+/-3.0; 1.0+/-0.8; and 0.3+/-0.2mg/kg; whereas levels in the LEC were 0.16+/-0.2; 0.02+/-0.03; and 0.02+/-0.03 mg/kg (P&lt;0.001). High concentrations of DDT, DDE, and DDD were obtained in samples of indoor dust collected from the walls in the HEC (17.5+/-10.0; 5.5+/-6.2; and 9.8+/-16.8 mg/kg); levels in the LEC were lower (0.6+/-0.9; 0.07+/-0.1; and 0.05+/-0.07 mg/kg) (P&lt;0.001).

Analytical methodology included n-hexane extraction, clean-up with 2% deactivated Florisil, and quantification with gas chromatography-electron capture detection (GC-ECD). The highest mean concentrations were found for p,p'-DDT in sardine and mackerel at levels of 30.1 and 109.9 microg kg(-1), respectively, and for p,p'-DDD in horse mackerel at 51.9 microg kg(-1). Three species had higher levels for S-DDT than S-HCH. The estimated daily intake of organochlorine pesticides in the three species showed that in sardine, the highest EDIs were found for aldrin, at 1.8 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1), which represents 1.8% of the acceptable daily intake (ADI), and for ss-HCH, at 4.0 ng kg(-1) bw day(-1), representing 0.4% of ADI.

Cells isolated from healthy individuals were incubated for different intervals of time (0-24 h) and in the presence of increasing concentrations of p'p-DDT, p'p-DDE, or p'p-<e>DDD</e> (0-80 microg/ml). The induction of oxidative stress was then determined by flow cytometry, using the compound 2',7'-dichlorofluorescein diacetate. The control level of ROS was 4.46+/-0.96 IFM, for DDT- and DDD-treated cells we obtained a 19.0-fold increment, whereas for DDE, the increment was 25-fold. ROS induction by DDT and DDE was observed after 1 h of incubation, while for DDD such levels began to be detected at 3 h of incubation; a maximum effect on the ROS production for the three compounds was found at 6 h of treatment. A significant level of ROS was induced by DDT, DDE, and DDD only at 60 and 80 microg/ml. Finally, to find an association between generation of ROS and apoptosis induction, cells incubated with DDT, DDE, and DDD were evaluated for apoptosis induction and generation of oxidative stress. Our results show that an increase in ROS was accompanied by apoptosis of PBMC in vitro. Moreover, N-acetyl-L-cysteine significantly inhibits the apoptosis induction.",M2
15779165,"[Mango leaves (Manguifera indica, Anacardiacea) used as biomarker of pollution by pp'Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (pp'DDT)]Dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), organochlorine pesticide, byanother way cumulative pesticide is banned in mostdeveloped countries. Whatever, it is still used in many countries in the Third World. This work consist to check whether this chemical compound is still used in Senegal. The biomarker of pollution by this pesticide for this research was mango leaves (mango tree is widespread in Senegal) open to accumulate halogenated hydrocarbons. Leaves sample were taken in many sites in the centerline of Dakar-ThiÃ¨s (Senegal), then analysed by gas chromatography. The results allowed to note the presence of DDT and its metabolites [(dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethylen (DDE), (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>)] in most of samples. The comparison of DDT content in relation to those of the principal metabolite allowed to make the difference according to sample sites, an old contamination of an utilisation more or less recent of this pesticide. From those results, we can conclude that DDT, typical pesticide by its big persistence is still used in some spherical zones in this country, in particular in farming gardening zones.",M2
15655797,"Benzene-assisted atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization: a new liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry approach to the analysis of selected hydrophobic compounds.Charge-exchange reactions involving benzene have been successfully exploited to increase the sensitivity of atmospheric-pressure chemical ionization mass spectrometry (APCI-MS) towards hydrophobic compounds of significant environmental relevance which are not detectable with the ordinary APCI techniques. Among them, good sensitivity have been found for (a) highly chlorinated biphenyl derivatives such as dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE); (b) cyclopentadienes such as Aldrin and its epoxy derivatives Dieldrin and Endrin; and (c) dibenzofurans and dibenzo-para-dioxins such as 2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzofuran (2,3,7,8-TCDF) and 2,3,7,8-tetrachloro-dibenzo-para-dioxin (2,3,7,8-TCDD). The reactant benzene molecules were introduced into the source either through the nebulizer gas or by direct post-column addition of neat liquid, whereas the targeted compounds were analyzed using a high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) RP-18 column using methanol/water solutions as mobile phase. By using benzene as post-column reagent, positive ion mode detection was proven to be significantly enhanced as compared with APCI measurements carried out without benzene assistance.",M2
15051369,"DDT and metabolites residues in the southern bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii bassanii) of south-eastern Australia.The southern bent-wing bat (Miniopterus schreibersii bassanii) is an insectivorous, obligate cave dwelling species found in south-eastern South Australia and western Victoria, Australia. In recent times, the finger of blame for an apparent population decline at Bat Cave, Naracoorte (one of only two known maternity roosts for this species, the other being Starlight Cave, Warrnambool) has been pointed at pesticide use in the region, following the finding of organochlorine and organophosphate insecticide residues in bat guano. This study sampled juvenile southern bent-wing bats from Bat Cave and Starlight Cave, and determined DDT, <e>DDD</e> and DDE concentrations in liver, pectoral muscle, brain and back-depot fat tissues. DDT was detected in only three tissue samples (highest concentration, 126 microg kg(-1) (wet weight) in back-depot fat), DDD was detected only in brain tissue (highest concentration, 115 microg kg(-1) (wet weight)), but DDE was detected in most tissues (highest concentration, 24,200 microg kg(-1) (wet weight) in back-depot fat). A minimum DDE body burden was estimated for each bat, and then for each sex at each site, from the data from all tissues sampled. The DDE body burdens estimated were highest in male bats from Starlight Cave (114 microg kg(-1)), then females from Starlight Cave (54.5 microg kg(-1)), and males from Bat Cave (53.2 microg kg(-1)). Female bats at Bat Cave contained the lowest estimated body burden (24.2 microg kg(-1)). Comparisons of DDE concentrations between the sexes showed that contamination was not statistically different within each maternity site. The different chemical concentrations observed in the Bat Cave and Starlight Cave bats is suggestive of different feeding locations, and perhaps an emerging population split, further threatening a species already at risk as a result of landscape scale changes to land use across their range.",M2

Percentage recoveries of the OCPs from spiked river water ranged from 71.03 +/- 8.15% (dieldrin) to 101.25 +/- 2.17% (alpha-BHC). The levels of OCPs ranged from 5.5 ng/L (2,4-DDD) to 160 ng/L (HCB) in the water samples. Some endocrine disrupting OCPs such as DDT, DDE, heptachlor, endosulfan and chlordane were detected.",M2
14746344,"A comparative study on the reliablility of toxicokinetic parameters for predicting hepatotoxicity of DDT in rats receiving a single or repeated administration.A comparative study on the reliability of toxicokinetic parameters for predicting hepatotoxicity was conducted in male F344 rats receiving a single (106 mg/kg by gavage) or 7-day repeated (1000 ppm in feed, 97 mg/kg/day) administration of p,p'-DDT. DDT was selected as the test substance because it is known as a hepatotoxic agent and its metabolic pathway is well documented. Concentrations of DDT and its metabolites (DDE and <e>DDD</e>) in the plasma, brain, and liver were measured at various time intervals during the study and the results were compared with the area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in relation to hepatotoxic response. Increases in the absolute and relative (ratio to body weight) liver weights were observed as a typical toxic response after a single or repeated exposure to DDT. The coefficient (R2) of correlation between the increases in the relative liver weight and the concentrations or AUC of DDT and its metabolites in the plasma and liver was estimated. The values of R2 between the relative liver weight and AUC of DDT or the total DDT (T-DDT) in the plasma and liver were found to be more consistent and higher than those with their concentrations in the repeated dose study. In addition, the R2 values in correlation with their AUCs after a single exposure were lower than those in the repeated dose study. These results indicate that the AUC of DDT or T-DDT in the plasma and liver would be more reliable than their concentrations for predicting hepatotoxicity caused by DDT, especially in the repeated dose study.",M2
14643285,"DDT induces apoptosis in human mononuclear cells in vitro and is associated with increased apoptosis in exposed children.The aim of the present work was to investigate whether DDT and its metabolites are able to induce apoptosis of human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) both in vitro and in vivo. Cells isolated from healthy individuals were incubated in the presence of increasing concentrations of p'p-DDT, p'p-DDE, or p'p-<e>DDD</e> (0-150 microg/mL) for different intervals. Apoptosis was then determined by flow cytometry (DNA cell content analysis) and fluorescence microscopy (Hoechst staining). A significant level of apoptosis was induced by DDT, DDD, and DDE at 80 microg/mL compared to controls, reaching a maximum effect at 100 microg/mL. We began to detect apoptosis at 12h, with a maximum effect at 24h of incubation. These results were confirmed using the TUNEL assay in cells treated with the three compounds tested as well as with o'p-DDT at 100 microg/mL and 24h of incubation. Our data demonstrate that DDT and its metabolites are able to induce apoptosis of human PBMC in vitro. Therefore, we performed a preliminary study in children exposed to this insecticide. When compared to a control population, the exposed children had higher levels of DDT, DDD, and DDE in blood and also had a higher frequency of apoptosis. In the exposed children, a weak positive association was found between the frequency of apoptosis and the exposure to DDT and DDE. Our results showed that more studies are needed in people exposed to DDT, as apoptosis may cause serious public health effects such as immunosuppression.",M2
14643282,"DDT induces DNA damage in blood cells. Studies in vitro and in women chronically exposed to this insecticide.In this study, DDT-induced DNA damage on blood cells was analyzed both in vitro and in vivo. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) were isolated from healthy donors and incubated in the presence of three different concentrations (40, 80, and 100 microg/mL) of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-<e>DDD</e> at three different treatment times (24, 48, and 72 h). Then, DNA damage was assessed by the single-cell electrophoresis assay (comet assay) as well as by flow cytometry detection of hypodiploid cells (DNA content assay). All compounds induced significant DNA damage as shown by the comet assay. Accordingly, cells exposed to DDT, DDE, and DDD showed a significant increase in the percentage of hypodiploid cells compared with untreated PBMC. In agreement with the in vitro data, a significant correlation between blood levels of DDT, DDD, and DDE and DNA damage (comet assay) was found in women with different amounts of environmental exposure. This association remained significant after controlling for nutritional status, smoking habits, alcohol ingestion, and reported exposure to other pesticides. Although the precise biological importance remains to be explained, our results strongly suggest that DDT and its metabolites are able to induce DNA damage in PBMC both in vitro and in vivo.",M2
12738282,"Seasonal change of persistent organic pollutant concentrations in air at Niigata area, Japan.The concentrations of persistent organic pollutants (POPs), such as HCB, alpha-, beta-, gamma- and delta-HCH, trans- and cis-chlordane (t-CHL, c-CHL), DDE, <e>DDD</e> and DDT, in ambient air have been measured at five sampling points in Niigata area, Japan (Niigata, Maki, Tsubame, Jouzo and Yahiko) during the period from September 1999 to November 2001. HCB, alpha-HCH, t-CHL and c-CHL showed higher concentrations than the other chemicals in all locations. All the POPs except t-CHL and c-CHL collected at urban sites of the Niigata Plain was almost the same in their concentration levels. Higher concentrations of t-CHL and c-CHL in residential areas should be attributed to the past usage of the chemical as a termiticide. At Yahiko (remote site), most of the POPs showed lower concentrations than those measured at the other sampling sites, although alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH were comparable with the concentrations found at the other sampling sites. All POPs except alpha-HCH and gamma-HCH tend to decrease 41-80% in their concentrations from 2000 to 2001. The lower POPs concentrations in winter and the higher POPs concentrations in summer at every sampling point can be partly explained by temperature differences. Applying the equation of the logarithm of the POP partial pressure in air versus reciprocal temperature (lnPa=m/T+b) to our data, linear relations were observed. HCB gave a poor linearity and the smallest slope, while beta-HCH, t-CHL and c-CHL gave good linearities and large slopes in the equation. The results suggest that HCB level is influenced by not only the emission from terrestrial sources but the global-scale background pollution. A peculiar observation is that beta-HCH concentration measured in our study showed large temperature dependence, indicating there could be a source of contamination in the surrounding areas.",M2
12713932,"Influence of arsenic co-contamination on DDT breakdown and microbial activity.The impacts of arsenic co-contamination on the natural breakdown of 1,1,l1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) in soil are investigated in a study of 12 former cattle dip sites located in northeastern NSW, Australia. This study examines the relationship between the intrinsic breakdown of DDT to 1,1 -dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (<e>DDD</e>) and 1,l-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethylene (DDE), and the impacts of arsenic co-contamination on this breakdown. Between-site analysis demonstrated that arsenic at 2000 mg/kg gave a 50% reduction in the concentration of DDD compared to background arsenic of 5 mg/kg.Within-site analysis also showed the ratio of DDT:DDD increased in soils as arsenic concentrations increased. This within-site trend was also apparent with the DDT:DDE ratio, suggesting inhibition of DDT breakdown by arsenic co-contamination. Microbial activity was inhibited as residues of total DDTs and arsenic increased. Hence arsenic co-contamination and high concentrations of DDT in soil may result in an increased persistence of DDT in the environment studied.",M2
12696651,"Associations of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) 4.4 and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) 4.4 blood levels with plasma IL-4.DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) reportedly induces cancer in animals, mimics estrogen activity, induces antiandrogen effects, and impairs Natural Killer (NK) cells and T lymphocyte responses. In this study, the authors attempted to determine associations of DDT, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>) blood levels with several immune parameters in patients occupationally exposed to insecticides. The study subjects were 49 patients who worked as farmers or farmhands in the former German Democratic Republic and who had been occupationally exposed to insecticides for at least 6 mo; 80% of them had been exposed for more than 20 yr. Blood levels of DDT, DDE, DDD, 2,3,4,5,6-pentachlorophenol (PCP), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), hexachlorobenzene (HCB), and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexanes (HCHs) were determined, and blood lymphocyte subpopulations, in vitro responses to mitogens or pooled allogeneic stimulator cells, plasma neopterin, and cytokine and soluble cytokine receptor levels were studied. The majority of patients were contaminated with more than 1 chemical--most commonly DDE, PCBs, and HCB. Linear-regression analysis showed that interleukin-4 (IL-4) plasma levels were associated with plasma levels of DDT 4.4 (p = .0001) and DDE 4.4 (p = .001). The data in this study suggest that PCBs, PCP, HCB, HCHs, DDE, and DDD suppress TH1 cytokines, such as IL-2 and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), and induce TH2 cytokines, such as IL-4. The authors hypothesized that clinical symptoms, such as the frequent infections reported by many patients, could be a consequence of these immunological abnormalities.",M2
12685724,"Uptake and depuration of nonionic organic contaminants from sediment by the oligochaete, Lumbriculus variegatus.Uptake of sediment-associated contaminants by the oligochaete Lumbriculus variegatus was evaluated after 1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 56 d of exposure to a field-collected sediment contaminated with DDT and its metabolites, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>) and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), or to a field-collected sediment contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Depuration of contaminants by oligochaetes in a control sediment or in water was also evaluated over a 7-d period after 28 d of exposure to the field-collected sediments. Accumulation of PAHs with a log octanol-water partitioning coefficient (log Kow) &lt;5.6 typically reached a peak at day 3, followed by a lower plateau between days 7 and 56 of the sediment exposure. Similarly, 4,4'-DDT exhibited a peak in accumulation at day 14 followed by a decline at days 28 and 56. In contrast, accumulation of PAHs with a log Kow &gt;5.6 or DDD and DDE typically exhibited a steady increase from day 1 to about day 14 or 28, followed by a plateau. Therefore, exposures conducted for a minimum of 14 to 28 d better reflected steady-state concentrations for DDT and its metabolites and for PAHs. Depuration rates for DDT and its metabolites and high-Kow PAHs were much higher in organisms held in clean sediment relative to both water-only depuration and model predictions. This suggests that depuration in clean sediment may artificially accelerate depuration of hydrophobic compounds. Comparisons between laboratory-exposed L. variegatus and oligochaetes collected in the field from these sediments indicate that results of laboratory tests can be extrapolated to the field with a reasonable degree of certainty.",M2

Analyses were carried out by gas chromatography mass spectroscopy detection. DDT was extracted from aqueous solutions using five different commercial coatings. The fibers were then exposed to UV light emitted by a low-pressure mercury lamp. After 30 min of irradiation, the degradation of DDT only occurred in polydimethylsiloxane fibers. The on-fiber degradation kinetics of p,p'-DDT was studied from 2 to 60 min. A large number of photoproducts were generated and their kinetic behavior was studied. In order to clarify the possible photoreaction pathways for DDT, individual water solutions containing p,p'-DDD or p.p'-DDE were prepared and photo-SPME was performed for each compound at different irradiation times. On the basis of the photoproducts identified, some photodegradation pathways are proposed. Finally, aqueous photodegradation studies followed by SPME were performed and compared to the photo-SPME. This work will show the enormous potential of photo-SPME to perform photodegradation studies.",M2
12460804,"DDT and its metabolites alter gene expression in human uterine cell lines through estrogen receptor-independent mechanisms.Endocrine-disrupting organochlorines, such as the pesticide dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), bind to and activate estrogen receptors (ERs), thereby eliciting estrogen-like effects. Although ERs function predominantly through activation of transcription via estrogen-responsive elements, both ERs, alpha and ss, can interact with various transcription factors such as activator protein-1 (AP-1). Additionally, estrogens may regulate early signaling events, suggesting that the biological effects of environmental estrogens may not be mediated through classic ER (alpha and ss) activity alone. We hypothesized that known environmental estrogens, such as DDT and its metabolites, activate AP-1-mediated gene transactivation through both ER-dependent and ER-independent means. Using two Ishikawa human endometrial adenocarcinoma cell line variants that we confirmed to be estrogen responsive [Ishikawa(+)] and estrogen unresponsive [Ishikawa(-)], we generated stably transfected AP-1 luciferase cell lines to identify the role of an estrogen-responsive mechanism in AP-1-mediated gene expression by various stimuli. Our results demonstrate that DDT and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>) were the most potent activators of AP-1 activity; 2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl) acetic acid failed to activate. Although stimulated in both Ishikawa(+) and Ishikawa(-) cells by DDT and its congeners, AP-1 activation was more pronounced in the estrogen-unresponsive Ishikawa(-) cells. In addition, DDT, DDD, and dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE) could also stimulate AP-1 activity in the estrogen-unresponsive human embryonic kidney 293 cells using a different promoter context. Thus, our data demonstrate that DDT and its metabolites activate the AP-1 transcription factor independent of ER (alpha or ss) status.",M2
11695593,"First report on chlorinated pesticide deposition in a sediment core from a small lake in central Chile.This paper presents a first report on chlorinated pesticide deposition analyzed through sedimentary records in a small mesotrophic lake (Chica de San Pedro) in central Chile. The sediment core was sliced and dated using 210Pb, 137Cs and pollen analyses. Organochlorine pesticides were analyzed by gas chromatography with electron capture detection (GC-ECD). From these results, pesticide deposition over the last 50 years was estimated. No pesticides were detected below the 1940 slice of the core. Concentrations were in the range 0.640-1.4 ng/g d.w. for total DDTs, 0.046-0.362 ng/g d.w. for lindane and 0.015-0.310 ng/g d.w. for alpha-hexachlorohexane. Highest concentrations of pp'DDT were found in 1993-1996 and higher concentrations of pp'-DDE and pp'-<e>DDD</e> were found in the seventies (1972-1978). Total organic carbon (TOC) normalized data were used for statistical analysis. Although significant correlation was observed between concentrations of DDE and DDD, no correlation was found for DDT, suggesting that it had a different source. Factorial analysis grouped DDE together with DDD, while DDT was grouped together with gamma- and alpha-HCH. Total DDT fluxes were highest during the 1970s, while those for HCHs have been increasing in the 1990s. In Chile, organochlorine compounds were banned in 1985, and the historical deposition patterns seem to indicate that such measures have been effective. On the other hand, results point out a relatively new occurrence of pp'-DDT in the watershed, but the source remains unknown.",M2

Sediment samples used for the study contained a variety of organic chemicals such as organochlorine pesticides, polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Total cytochrome P-450 and EROD activity were measured in fish liver. Haematological and histological analyses were also carried out. Hepatic P-450 content in treated fish increased from 43 to 240%, and EROD activity from 85 to 160% compared to controls. Extracts from two sampling sites inhibited EROD activity. There were positive significant correlations between P-450 content and the levels of PCBs 44 and 128. EROD activity correlated to HCB, op'-DDE, pp'-DDE, pp'-<e>DDD</e>, mirex and PCB 18 concentrations. Blood examination showed cell degeneration and binucleated leukocytes with abnormal chromatin. Extract treatment also resulted in foci of hyperplasia on the basement of gill lamellae, hypertrophy and oedema in gills and liver necrosis. Control fish showed no abnormalities. The results demonstrate that sediments from BahÃ­a of Chetumal have the potential to cause histopathological, haematological and biochemical alterations in fish. The administration of sediment extracts to fish may serve as a useful test to screen the toxicity of sediments from different areas.",M2
11411851,"Anaerobic biodegradation of DDT residues (DDT, <e>DDD</e>, and DDE) in estuarine sediment.The potential for anaerobic biodegradation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bischlorophenylethane (DDT), 1,1-dichloro-2,2,-bischlorophenylethane (DDD), and dichlorodiphenylchloroethylene (DDE) in anoxic sediment slurries collected from the Keelung River was investigated in this study. o,p'- and p,p'-DDT were dechlorinated to o,p'- and p,p'-DDD, respectively, and then transformed to other compound(s). 1-Chloro-2,2-bis (p-chlorophenyl) ethylene (DDMU) and trace amount of dichlorobenzophenone (DBP) were detected in sediment slurries amended with p,p'-DDT or p,p'-DDD. DDMU was also detected in sediment slurries amended with p,p'-DDE. The relative transformation rates for both o,p'- and p,p'-isomers of DDT, DDD, and DDE were DDT&gt;DDD&gt;DDE. Re-addition of DDT, DDD, or DDE to the sediment slurries after initial removal enhanced the respective dechlorination rates. The transformation rates of the p,p'-isomers of both DDT and DDD were faster than those of the respective o,p'-isomers. p,p'-DDT dechlorination in the p,p'-DDT-adapted sediment slurries were inhibited by the addition of molybdate, or molybdate plus sulfate, but not inhibited by the addition of sulfate. Addition of bromoethane-sulfonic acid (BESA) slightly inhibited p,p'-DDT dechlorination. Non-adapted sediment slurries lost the ability to dechlorinate pentachlorophenol during adaptation to p,p'-DDT. p,p'-DDD was the major transformation product of p, p'-DDT in 3,4,4',5-tetrachlorobiphenyl-adapted sediment slurries, which suggested that the microbial community in the 3,4,4',5-CB-adapted sediment was unable to remove chlorine from the aromatic rings of p,p'-DDT.",M2
11345458,"Toxicity and bioaccumulation of DDT in freshwater amphipods in exposures to spiked sediments.The amphipods Hyalella azteca and Diporeia spp. were exposed to sediments dosed with dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), and the toxicity and toxicokinetics were determined. The toxicity was evaluated with the equilibrium partitioning (EqP) and critical body residue approaches. The DDT in the sediments degraded during the equilibration period prior to organism exposure. Thus, the toxicity using EqP pore-water toxic units (TUs) was evaluated for DDT and its degradation product, dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane (<e>DDD</e>), as the ratio of the predicted interstitial water concentration divided by the water-only LC50 values. The sum of TUs (sum(TU)) was assumed to best represent the toxicity of the mixture. For H. azteca, the 10-d LC50 was 0.98 and 0.33 sum(TU) for two experiments. For Diporeia spp., no toxicity was found in the first experiment with up to 3 sum(TU) predicted in the interstitial water. However, in the second experiment, the 28-d LC50 was 0.67 sum(TU). These data suggest that the EqP approach approximately predicts the toxicity for the combination of DDT and DDD in sediment, provided a toxic unit approach is employed. The critical body residue approach also used TUs because DDT is biotransformed by H. azteca and because of the dual exposure to DDT and DDD. Because biotransformation was only determined in the second experiment, the critical body residue approach could only be evaluated for that case. The TUs were calculated as the ratio of the concentration in the live amphipods divided by the respective LR50 (residue concentration required to produce 50% mortality) values. The LR50 was 1.1 sum(TU) for H. azteca for the 10-d exposure and 0.53 for Diporeia spp. after a 28-d exposure. Thus, this approach was also quite successful in predicting the toxicity. The accumulation and loss rates for H. azteca were much greater than for Diporeia spp. Thus, 10-d exposures represent steady-state conditions for H. azteca, while even at 28-d, the Diporeia spp. are not at steady state.",M2

However, none of the communities could grow on pentachlorophenol. Pure cultures were isolated from microbial communities using phenanthrene and pyrene as the sole carbon and energy source. Isolates were also obtained using DDT, DOH, DBH and PCPA when peptone was supplemented to the medium. Strain AJR39,504, isolated using DDT and peptone, could not be positively identified on the basis of substrate utilization tests. However, it most closely resembled Stenotrophomonas maltophilia (0.424 similarity) using the Microlog 3 database software. Isolate AJR39, 504 could also grow on polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, chlorinated- and nitro-aromatic compounds.

10931107,"A case of adrenocortical carcinoma associated with recurrence after laparoscopic surgery.Laparoscopic adrenalectomy has become increasingly popular because of its minimally invasive nature, but guidelines for selection of cases suitable for this surgical procedure have not been established. We report a 52-year-old woman with adrenocortical carcinoma, manifesting as Cushing's syndrome, treated with laparoscopic adrenalectomy. The tumour was removed in toto and had been histologically diagnosed as adrenocortical adenoma. However, the patient developed intra-abdominal peritoneal dissemination of carcinoma 15 months after surgery. Review of the histopathological findings of the resected adrenocortical tumour revealed that the neoplasm met five out of nine histological criteria for adrenocortical malignancy, and was diagnosed as adrenocortical carcinoma. Histopathological examination of the tumour was also consistent with adrenocortical carcinoma. The patient responded extremely well to chemotherapy, including carboplatin, etoposide and o,p'-<e>DDD</e> (1,1-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethane), and a subsequent CT (computed tomography) scan 12 months after the start of chemotherapy demonstrated no evidence of disease. However, the patient developed neurological impairment, including dysarthria, as a side-effect of o, p'-DDD. The patient died of aspiration pneumonia due to a decreased pharyngeal reflex.

These concerns have been augmented by the realization that human exposure occurs not just to single chemical agents, but typically to mixtures of chemicals that could exhibit estrogenic activity qualitatively and/or quantitatively different from that of individual components. To address these concerns, we have evaluated the ability of six organochlorine pesticides (4, 4'-DDT, 4,4'-<e>DDD</e>, 4,4'-DDE, aldrin, dieldrin, or endrin, all classified high priority by ATSDR) to modulate transcriptional activation of an estrogen-responsive reporter gene in transfected HeLa cells. In these assays, HeLa cells cotransfected with an expression vector encoding estrogen receptor and an estrogen-responsive chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) reporter plasmid were exposed to these pesticides individually and in defined combinations. While estradiol consistently elicited 10- to 23-fold dose-dependent inductions in these assays, the six organochlorine pesticides showed no detectable dose-related response when tested individually. When tested in binary combinations, the pesticide mixtures showed no additional estrogenicity. Thus, the pesticides tested, singly or as mixtures, showed virtually no evidence of estrogenicity.",M2

10808614,"[DDT and related pesticides in maternal milk and other tissues of healthy women at term pregnancy]Ten healthy patients with term pregnancy resolved by abdominal via. During the surgical procedure samples of umbilical chord serum and maternal adipose tissue, were taken. In all the samples, together with the maternal milk collected the day 10 of puerperium, the concentrations of the following organochlorine pesticides, were measured up: (PCC); beta-BHC; gamma-BHC; heptachloride; aldrin; dieldrin, DDE, <e>DDD</e>, DDT and methoxychloride. The identification and quantification of pesticides was done by the comparison with standards certified by NIST (National Institute of Standard Technology). The general characteristics of the participants were: primigestas of 24.1 years aged, married and of a low socioeconomical level. As to the neonates, of 39 weeks of gestational age, female sex; 3,311 g of corporal weight and size of 51.1 cm. In all the analyzed samples at least one of the organochlorine pesticides was present. The results of correlation analysis between DDT concentration, present in the maternal serum with those identified in the adipose tissue and serum from the umbilical chord were highly significant: a = 0.97 and 0.87, respectively. In the maternal milk the highest concentrations of total DDT, were found, average of 2053 ng/g lipidic base, which is 2.8 times more of daily accepted intake. Likewise, DDT concentration in maternal serum kept exponential relation, growing with age (a = 0.99).",M2
10448570,"Studies on degradation of 14C-DDT in the marine environment.Degradation of 14C-DDT was studied in a marine ecosystem for 60 days and in marine sediments under moist and flooded conditions using a continuous flow system for a period of 130 days. 14C-DDT residues were recovered in sediments of the marine ecosystem at uniform level of 60-65% of the applied 14C-activity throughout the incubation period. <e>DDD</e> was a major metabolite in sediments while DDMU was a major metabolite in clams. Clams brought about substantial degradation of DDT. However, 14C-residues recovered form clams are not suggestive of significant bioaccumulation. In the continuous flow experiment, under both moist and flooded conditions, DDT underwent degradation and about 22% of the applied 14C-activity was recovered as volatiles under both conditions. In sediments, extractable 14C-residues accounted for about 30 and 19% under moist and flooded conditions, respectively. DDT was the major compound in extractable residues as identified by TLC-autoradiographic procedures. More bound residues were formed under flooded than under moist conditions.",M2

The reduction appears to proceed in two steps. The first step is reduction of a flavin such as FAD, FMN or riboflavin by NADPH or NADH, either enzymatically or nonenzymatically. The second step is nonenzymatic reductive dechlorination of DDT by the reduced flavin, catalyzed by the heme group of hemoglobin.",M2
9601932,"Chlororganic pesticides and polychlorinated biphenyls in breast tissue of women with benign and malignant breast disease.Persistent chlorinated hydrocarbons assimilated through the diet may, as a result of their carcinogenic, immunotoxic, and, at least in regard to certain of these substances, estrogenic properties, play a role in the etiology of human breast cancer. As a consequence, increased concentrations of these ubiquitous environmental contaminants may be found in breast tissue of women suffering from malignant breast disease. To examine this possibility, surgically removed breast tissue samples from 65 women in Hesse, Germany were examined by capillary gas chromatography for p, p'-dichloro(diphenyl)trichloroethane (p,p'-DDT), p, p'-dichloro(diphenyl)-dichloroethane (p,p'-<e>DDD</e>), p, p'-dichloro(diphenyl)dichloroethene (p,p'-DDE), hexachlorobenzine (HCB), alpha-, beta-, and gamma-hexachlorocyclohexane (HCH) as well as the polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) no. 28, 31, 49, 52, 101, 105, 118, 138, 153, 156, 170, and 180. Of the 65 patients, 45 were diagnosed with breast cancer. The control group of 20 women suffered from benign breast disease such as mastopathy. After statistical adjustment for age differences, higher concentrations of p,p'-DDT, p, p'-DDE, HCB as well as PCB-congeners no. 118, 138, 153, and 180 were detected in tissue from women with breast cancer than in tissue from control persons. These differences were weakly significant for p, p'-DDE (p = 0.017), for PCB 118 (p = 0.042) and for PCB no. 153 barely not significant (p = 0.083). On an average, a 62% higher concentration of p,p'-DDE was found in cancer tissue (cancer patients: 805 microg/kg fat; controls: 496 microg/kg fat) and 25% higher concentration of PCB no. 118 (81 microg/kg fat; 65 microg/kg fat). The concentrations of beta-HCH, PCB no. 156 and 170 were lower (not significant) in cancer tissue than in tissue from women with benign disease. PCB-congeners no. 105 and 149 as well as gamma-HCH could only be detected in individual tissue samples; congeners no. 28, 31, 49, 52, and 101 as well as alpha-HCH and p,p'-DDD were not detected in any of the samples. To rule out the possibility that the concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons measured were influenced by the surgical procedure, 20 samples of tissue that were at a distance (minimum 1 cm and maximum 3 cm) from the tumor, tissue that was in direct proximity to the tumor (no more than 5 mm from the tumor), and tumor tissue itself (center of tumor) were separately prepared and analyzed. The average concentrations of chlorinated hydrocarbons varied to differing degrees and only minimally in tumor and surrounding breast tissue, indicating that the surgical procedure did not influence the results.",M2

DDD burdens in serum ranged from &lt;0.006 microM (limit of detection) in control rats to 1.1 microM in the rats fed DDD at 2,000 ppm. The corresponding liver burdens in these animals ranged from &lt;0.006 micromol/kg liver (controls) to 11 micromol/kg liver in rats fed DDD at 2,000 ppm. Levels of DDE in serum or liver were undetectable (&lt;0. 006 microM in serum; &lt;0.006 micromol/kg liver) in rats fed control diet or diet containing 8.51 or 25.5 ppm DDD. The liver and serum burdens of DDE increased with dietary DDD concentration, reaching a maximum of 0.53 microM in serum and 4.7 micromol/kg liver in rats fed 2,000 ppm DDD. As a percentage of total DDD equivalents detected in liver or serum, the DDE burdens increased to a maximum of 36% and 31% in the serum and liver, respectively, of rats fed 689 ppm DDD. The possibility that the DDE might have been generated artifactually in the diet prior to administration to the rats was ruled out by analysis with capillary gas chromatography of the diet containing 2, 000 ppm DDD. The identification of DDE as a metabolite in liver extracts of rats fed 2,000 ppm DDD was confirmed with GC-MS. The results confirmed the presence of DDE as a metabolite of DDD.",M2

Laboratory experiments with DDE-containing marine sediments showed that DDE is dechlorinated to DDMU in both methanogenic and sulfidogenic microcosms and that DDD is dehydrochlorinated to DDMU three orders of magnitude more slowly. Thus, DDD does not appear to be an important precursor of the DDMU found in these sediments.

9537282,"Comparative pharmacodynamics of CYP2B induction by DDT, DDE, and <e>DDD</e> in male rat liver and cultured rat hepatocytes.In this study the pharmacodynamics were characterized of rat hepatic cytochrome P-450 2B (CYP2B) induction by the pesticide DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane] and its metabolites DDE [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethylene], which is bioretained, and DDD [1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane], which is metabolized further and therefore less prone to bioaccumulate. DDT, DDE, and DDD were each found to be pure phenobarbital-type cytochrome P-450 inducers in the male F344/NCr rat, causing induction of hepatic CYP2B and CYP3A, but not CYP1A. The ED50 values for CYP2B induction (benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation) by DDT, DDE, and DDD were, respectively, 103, 88, and &gt; or = 620 ppm in diet (14 d of exposure). The efficacies (Emax values) for induction of benzyloxyresorufin O-dealkylation by DDT, DDE, and DDD were 24-, 22-, and &gt; or = 1-fold, respectively, compared to control values. The potencies of the three congeners for CYP2B induction appeared also to be similar, with EC50 values (based on total serum DDT equivalents) of 1.5, 1.8, and &gt; or = 0.51 microM, respectively. The EC50 values based on DDT equivalents in hepatic tissue were 15, 16, and &gt; or = 5.9 micromol/kg liver tissue, respectively. In primary cultures of adult rat hepatocytes, DDT, DDE, and DDD each displayed ability to induce total cellular RNA coding for CYP2B (ED50 values of 0.98, 0.83, and &gt; or = 2.7 microM, respectively). These results suggest that DDT, DDE, and DDD each possess a high degree of intrinsic CYP2B-inducing ability for rat liver, despite marked differences in bioretention among the congeners.",M2
8948080,"Phenobarbital-type P-450 inducers protect rats against metaldehyde toxicity.The mechanism of metaldehyde toxicity is unclear.

8930550,"Identification of environmental chemicals with estrogenic activity using a combination of in vitro assays.Environmental chemicals that function as estrogens have been suggested to be associated with an increase in disease and dysfunctions in animals and humans. To characterize chemicals that may act as estrogens in humans, we have compared three in vitro assays which measure aspects of human estrogen receptor (hER)-mediated estrogenicity. Chemicals were first tested for estrogen-associated transcriptional activity in the yeast estrogen screen (YES). This was created by expressing hER and two estrogen response elements linked to the lacZ gene in yeast. Second, chemicals that were tested in YES were then assayed for direct interaction with hER in a competition binding assay. Third, chemicals were tested in the estrogen-responsive MCF-7 human breast cancer cell line transiently transfected with a plasmid containing two estrogen response elements linked to the luciferase gene. Together, these assays have identified two metabolites of DDT, o,p'-<e>DDD</e> and p,p'-DDD, that have estrogenic activity. Interestingly, previous studies had reported that the DDD metabolites were nonestrogenic in whole animal models. Alachlor, the most frequently used herbicide in the United States, cis-nonachlor, and trans-nonachlor displayed weak estrogenic activity in the combined assays. The antifungal agent benomyl had no estrogenic activity. We propose that a combination of in vitro assays can be used in conjunction with whole animal models for a more complete characterization of chemicals with estrogenic activity.",M2
8653379,"Organochlorine compounds in blubber, liver and brain in neonatal grey seal pups.The present study focuses on the distribution and accumulation of persistent organochlorine compounds in different tissues and organs of grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) pups. Thus, levels of drins (aldrin, dieldrin, endrin), chlordanes (heptachlor, heptachlorepoxide, oxychlordane, transnonachlor), DDTs (p,p'-DDE, o,p'-<e>DDD</e>, p,p'-DDD, o,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDT) and 22 PCB congeners were determined in samples of brain, fat, and liver of 0-10 days old grey seal pups from the species' main breeding site in Norway. Whereas 10 different compounds were detected in the blubber, 8 compounds were detected in the liver. The concentrations of the two major classes of OCs (PCBs and DDTs) in liver were both about 75% of that in blubber. In cerebral tissue, only two PCB congeners were detected, and sigma PCB was only about 1% of that measured in the blubber. The distribution pattern of PCB-congeners in liver and brain differed significantly from that in blood and blubber tissue, indicating that the physico-chemical properties of the individual congeners and the lipid composition of the tissue are decisive for the tissue-specific pattern of congener distribution. A significant increase of the sigma DDT/sigma PCB-ratio as a function of blubber thickness indicates that DDT compounds are more readily accumulated in older pups.",M2

This was accomplished by establishing a daily intake level of DDT for the population of greatest concern, and comparing this level to a tolerable daily intake. The most sensitive and highly exposed group was determined to be breastfeeding infants. Infant daily intakes of DDT, based on estimated mother's DDT-breast milk levels, were compared to a recommended tolerable daily intake.

7482534,"Dde chlorinated insecticide 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (p,p'-<e>DDD</e>) increases intracellular calcium in rat myometrial smooth muscle cells.A previous report from this laboratory showed that two DDT isomers, o,p'-DDT and p,p'-DDD, increased the frequency of spontaneous oscillatory contractions to a similar extent in isolated rat uterine segments. Because regulation of intracellular calcium is fundamental for the development of oscillatory contractions, the present study examined the effects of p,p'-DDD on intracellular free calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i) in individual rat myometrial smooth muscle cells loaded with the fluorescent Ca2+ indicator fura 2. In the presence of extracellular calcium, 50 and 100 microM p,p'-DDD significantly increased peak [Ca2+]i 586 and 921%, respectively, over basal [Ca2+]i. No significant effect was observed with 10 microM p,p'-DDD. In the absence of extracellular calcium, the response to 100 microM p,p'-DDD was significantly attenuated, with cells averaging a 108% increase in peak [Ca2+]i over basal levels, presumably through Ca2+ release from intracellular stores. Nifedipine and cadmium chloride, blockers of voltage-dependent calcium channels, inhibited 100 microM p,p'-DDD-stimulated increases in [Ca2+]i such that peak [Ca2+]i was increased 250% and 259%, respectively. Because of the prominent inhibition observed with the voltage-dependent calcium channel blockers, the effect of p,p'-DDD on membrane depolarization was examined using a cationic fluorescent indicator of membrane potential, [diS-C2(5)]. A concentration of 50 microM p,p'-DDD depolarized the cells by 35% of maximum during treatment with p,p'-DDD. The data demonstrate that p,p'-DDD increased [Ca2+]i in rat myometrial smooth muscle cells in a concentration-related manner, and that this increase was largely dependent on influx of extracellular calcium through dihydropyridine-sensitive, voltage-dependent calcium channels. The data further show that p,p'-DDD depolarized the plasma membrane, providing a possible mechanism for activation of voltage-dependent calcium channels. Additionally, another calcium source, perhaps an intracellular pool, contributes significantly less to the rise of [Ca2+]i. Whether p,p'-DDD initiates the calcium response by direct actions on the plasma membrane or by other means remains to be determined.",M2
7587937,"Oxidation at C-1 controls the cytotoxicity of 1,1-dichloro-2,2- bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane by rabbit and human lung cells.Isolated rabbit Clara cells and a transformed human bronchial epithelial cell line, BEAS-2B, were used to investigate the mechanism of cytotoxicity of 1,1-dichloro-2,2-bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane (<e>DDD</e>), a persistent insecticide and stable metabolite of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2- bis(p-chlorophenyl)ethane. Both BEAS-2B cells and rabbit Clara cells were highly susceptible to DDD toxicity and were partially protected by 1-aminobenzotriazole, a suicide substrate inhibitor of cytochrome P450 enzymes. DDD (0.05 mM) killed 47 +/- 1.8% of rabbit Clara cells and 42 +/- 7.9% of BEAS-2B cells after 3 hr and 84 +/- 3.0% of rabbit Clara cells and 80 +/- 14% of BEAS-2B cells after 6 hr. Consequently, DDD is the most potent Clara cell toxicant recognized to date. The cytotoxicity of DDD to these cells was decreased by deuterium substitution at the C-1 position. Rabbit Clara cells and pulmonary microsomes incubated with 14C-DDD produced the fully oxidized acetic acid metabolite 2,2'-bis(p- chlorophenyl)acetic acid (DDA), but DDA was not formed by Clara cells when DDD was coincubated with 1-aminobenzotriazole. These results support the hypothesis that the cytotoxicity of DDD to susceptible subpopulations of rabbit and human lung cells is, at least in part, caused by cytochrome P450-mediated oxidation of DDD at C-1. A required step for the production of the cytotoxic intermediate is proposed to be the formation of a highly reactive acyl halide intermediate that is readily hydrolyzed to a stable, nontoxic metabolite, DDA.",M2
7867138,"Malaria control and longitudinal changes in levels of DDT and its metabolites in human serum from KwaZulu.Blood samples were obtained on four occasions over a 12-month period from individuals living in KwaZulu, South Africa, who had been exposed to DDT (1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane) as a consequence of its use in their homes to control transmission of malaria. The longitudinal changes in serum DDT and its major metabolities, DDE and <e>DDD</e>, were determined. No additional risk was considered to have been presented by the increases that occurred following application of the pesticide. There were significant increases in DDT, DDE and sigma DDT (DDT + its metabolites) for the age group &gt; or = 21 years, but for the age group 3-20 years a reduction in serum levels occurred over 12 months. Two concurrent processes probably govern the increase and decrease in serum levels, and the relative contributions of each interchange as the individual becomes older. The results suggest that children in KwaZulu experience conditions that differ from those of their parents, as well as from those that affect children in developed countries. In consequence, it is desirable that risk assessments of vector control chemicals consider all sectors of a population.The indoor application of DDT is successfully used to interrupt the transmission of malaria parasites in many developing countries.  In South Africa, it is employed in the northern and eastern Transvaal and northern KwaZulu, where malaria is endemic.  DDT was applied biannually to all homesteads in these areas over the period 1957-77, with regular applications made annually thereafter between January and March.  The stable, lipophilic properties of DDT, however, enable the insecticide to accumulate in biological systems.  This study was designed to determine longitudinal changes in levels of DDT and its metabolites in the serum of a population protected against malaria by DDT, and to examine differences in the rates of change of serum levels of DDT and DDE between younger and older age groups.  Blood samples were collected on four occasions over a 12-month period from 71 individuals living in KwaZulu, South Africa, who had been exposed to DDT during malaria control interventions.  29 were 21 years old or older, while the remainder were 3-20 years old.  Researchers determined the longitudinal changes in serum DDT and its major metabolites, DDE and DDD.  There were significant increases in DDT, DDE, and DDT and its metabolites for people aged 21 years and older, but for the age group 3-20 years, a reduction in serum levels occurred over the 12-month period.  Two concurrent processes probably govern the increase and decrease in serum levels, and the relative contributions of each interchange as an individual ages.  These results suggest that children in KwaZulu experience conditions which differ from those of their parents, as well as from those which affect children in developed countries.  A need therefore exists to assess the risk presented by vector control chemicals in all sectors of a given population.",M2
1448445,"Bioactivation of halogenated hydrocarbons by rabbit pulmonary cells.1,1-Dichloro-2,2-bis (4'-chlorophenyl)ethane (<e>DDD</e>), 1,2-dibromoethane (DBE) and trichloroethylene are three halogenated hydrocarbons that selectively bind to pulmonary epithelial cells and that may be pneumotoxic. The susceptibility of pulmonary cells and the mechanisms of cytotoxicity of these compounds were evaluated using enriched subpopulations of isolated rabbit lung cells incubated with DDD, DBE, and trichloroethylene. These chlorinated and brominated hydrocarbons were studied to evaluate their ability to induce selective pneumotoxicity by their bioactivation in three cell types, i.e. Clara cells, alveolar type II cells, and alveolar macrophages. Evidence of cytochrome P-450 bioactivation was assessed by utilizing the suicide inhibitor, 1-aminobenzotriazole (ABT) to ameliorate cytotoxicity. DDD, DBE and trichloroethylene were cytotoxic to Clara cells, type II cells and alveolar macrophages and the order of cell susceptibility to DDD was Clara &gt; type II &gt; macrophages. DBE and trichloroethylene were nonselectively cytotoxic. ABT reduced the cytotoxic effects of DDD and DBE in Clara cells. These studies indicated that all three compounds were toxic to isolated lung cells and that bioactivation of DDD and DBE in rabbit Clara cells to a cytotoxic intermediate was mediated, at least in part, by cytochrome P-450 oxidation.",M2
2051491,"Malaria control and levels of DDT in serum of two populations in Kwazulu.Concentrations of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-<e>DDD</e> were determined in serum of members of households of two different areas of KwaZulu. Annual intradomiciliary application of DDT is used for the interruption of malaria transmission in one area (the exposed group) while the other served as the control. Demographic differences between the two groups resulted in significantly more females in the control group. The two groups were comparable with respect to age. Serum from household members living in DDT-treated dwellings had significantly higher (p less than .005) levels of sigma DDT and metabolites (mean sigma DDT 140.9 micrograms/l) than those from the control area (mean sigma DDT 6.04 micrograms/l). Percentage DDT was also significantly higher (p less than .05) in the exposed group (28.9%) than the control group (8.3%). sigma DDT for the 3-10 yr age interval (168.6 micrograms/l) was significantly higher (p less than .05) than the 20-29 (60.5 micrograms/l) and 30-39 (84.2 micrograms/l) yr age intervals. There seemed to be two groups with regard to accumulation and elimination. The age group 3-29 appeared to be eliminating DDT, most likely accumulated from contaminated breast milk, faster than they accumulated it. From around 29 yr of age accumulation predominated as the levels increased with age. Regression analysis suggested pharmacokinetic differences for DDE and DDT between the two groups. Liver function parameters between the two groups only differed significantly for gamma-glutamyl transferase (gamma GT) (p less than .005), but the influence of difference in alcohol consumption, which was significantly higher in the exposed group (p less than .0001), offered a better explanation. Those of the exposed group that consumed alcohol had a significantly higher (p less than .05) mean gamma GT level (41.5 IU/l) than those that did not (20.2 IU/l), but were not significantly different for sigma DDT (p greater than .05). The safety of DDT used in malaria control for subjects aged 3 and older was confirmed by the levels of DDT in serum when compared with other studies, which showed lack of any negative effects associated with these levels in adults, and an apparently normal liver function in the exposed and control groups.",M2
2213927,"Factors affecting levels of DDT and metabolites in human breast milk from Kwazulu.Concentrations of p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE, and p,p'-<e>DDD</e> have been determined in breast milk of mothers residing in two different areas of KwaZulu. Annual intradomiciliary application of DDT was used for the interruption of malaria transmission in one area, while the other served as the control. Milk from mothers living in DDT-treated dwellings had significantly higher mean levels of DDT and metabolites (mean sigma DDT 15.83 mg kg-1 in milk fat) than those from the control area (0.69 mg kg-1). The highest recorded sigma DDT value was 59.3 mg kg-1 (milk fat). Primiparous mothers from the malarious area had significantly more sigma DDT and metabolites (sigma DDT 24.82 mg kg-1) than multiparous mothers from the same area (mean 12.21 mg kg-1). Parity was the best predictor of DDT in breast milk of the exposed group. The percentage DDT and the sigma DDT increased significantly with an increase in parity. The same, but not significant, trend was also found for the control group. It was hypothesized that the increase in percentage DDT that occurred with higher parities was due to the uptake of DDT and elimination via milk. This process was faster than the uptake and endogenous formation of DDE. Designing predictive models using multiple regression was not very successful.

2073714,"Levels of DDT and metabolites in breast milk from Kwa-Zulu mothers after DDT application for malaria control.Concentrations of DDT, DDE and <e>DDD</e> were determined in the breast milk of Kwa-Zulu mothers residing in two different areas--with and without annual intra-domiciliary applications of DDT for the interruption of malaria transmission (exposed and control groups, respectively). While no significant change in levels with time was found in the control group, both DDT and DDE in breast milk of the exposed group increased after DDT application and this continued for three more months, after which it did not decrease appreciably. Percentage DDT increased from 42.57% (sigma DDT = 12.21 mg/kg milk fat) before spraying to 50.87% (sigma DDT = 13.79 mg/kg milk fat) following DDT application. At 6 and 9 months after the application it was 45.85% (sigma DDT = 19.49 mg/kg milk fat) and 43.27% (sigma DDT = 18.34 mg/kg milk fat), respectively. These results suggest a risk to the health of the infants in the exposed group.",M2
2587511,"Covalent binding of four <e>DDD</e> isomers in the mouse lung: lack of structure specificity.Previous studies have shown that o,p'-DDD is activated and covalently bound in the mouse lung. In order to examine the structure dependency of the selective lung binding, the 14C-labelled DDD isomers p,p'-DDD, m,p'-DDD and o,m'-DDD were injected intravenously into female C57B1 mice and covalent binding was measured. Autoradiography of solvent-extracted tape-sections showed that all isomers were selectively and covalently bound in the lung alveolar region. As determined by exhaustive extraction of homogenized tissue, maximal binding was observed 4 hr after injection, although the lung/liver concentration ratio increased for 12 days. Covalent protein binding was also observed in vitro, implying that the activation of DDD to a reactive metabolite takes place in the target organ. Since the aryl-chlorine substitution pattern did not change the selective lung binding, bioactivation of DDD may take place at the ethane side-chain.",M2

The major metabolites of DDT were DDD, DDE, DDMU, 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4'-chlorophenyl) ethane, 1,1,1-trichloro-2-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4'-hydroxyphenyl) ethane, and 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl) ethane. Conversely, DDD was mainly degraded into DDE, 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4'-chlorophenyl) ethane and 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4'-hydroxyphenyl) ethane. Finally, DDE was transformed into DDMU, 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4'-chlorophenyl) ethylene, 1,1-dichloro-2-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4'hydroxyphenyl) ethylene and 1-chloro-2-(2-hydroxy-4-chlorophenyl)-2-(4'-chlorophenyl) ethylene. The phenolic metabolites exhibited [M - TMSCl]+., [M - HCl - TMSCl]+. and/or [M - HCl - TMSCl - Me]+ fragment ions which reflect the presence of an ortho hydroxyl group in these molecules. Other mass spectral features used to determine their structure are presented and a metabolic scheme accounting for their formation is proposed.",M2
3674869,"Biodegradation of DDT [1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane] by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium.Extensive biodegradation of 1,1,1-trichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (DDT) by the white rot fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium was demonstrated by disappearance and mineralization of [14C]DDT in nutrient nitrogen-deficient cultures. Mass balance studies demonstrated the formation of polar and water-soluble metabolites during degradation. Hexane-extractable metabolites identified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry included 1,1,-dichloro-2,2-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethane (<e>DDD</e>), 2,2,2-trichloro-1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol (dicofol), 2,2-dichloro-1,1-bis(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol (FW-152), and 4,4'-dichlorobenzophenone (DBP). DDD was the first metabolite observed; it appeared after 3 days of incubation and disappeared from culture upon continued incubation. This, as well as the fact that [14C]dicofol was mineralized, demonstrates that intermediates formed during DDT degradation are also metabolized. These results demonstrate that the pathway for DDT degradation in P. chrysosporium is clearly different from the major pathway proposed for microbial or environmental degradation of DDT. Like P. chrysosporium ME-446 and BKM-F-1767, the white rot fungi Pleurotus ostreatus, Phellinus weirii, and Polyporus versicolor also mineralized DDT.",M2

The rate of excretion of radioactivity was greater in the rat than in the quail for all compounds except DDMU. Skin and fat were major sites of residual radioactivity in both species, the compound administered and DDE accounting for most of the radioactivity except in the case of DDMU. The four radiolabelled compounds were all present in significant quantities in excreta of both species in unchanged forms. The metabolic patterns for DDT and DDD were similar in rat and quail, except that the rat formed 2,2-di(4-chlorophenyl)ethanol (DDOH) from DDT while the quail did not. Rat and quail metabolized DDE and DDMU differently. Ring-hydroxylated derivatives of DDE were formed only in the rat and analogous metabolites of DDMU were produced only by quail. Both species produced di(4-chlorophenyl)acetic acid as a metabolite of all four compounds administered, although the formation was generally less and slower in quail than rat. Comparative metabolism of DDMU with the other compounds indicated that this compound is not a metabolic intermediate in the metabolism of DDT in either rat or quail.",M2

6149241,"Effect of temperature on the inhibition of rat brain synaptosomal ATPases by DDT and its structural analogs.In vitro effects of DDT and its isomers or metabolites were studied on Na+-K+-ATPase and oligomycin-sensitive (OS) Mg++-ATPase activities at 17, 27 and 37 degrees C in rat brain synaptosomes. Dicofol and methoxychlor were found to be more effective inhibitors of Na+-K+-ATPase and OS Mg++-ATPase than DDT, <e>DDD</e> and DDE. Inhibition of OS Mg++-ATPase by the compounds tested (except DDE) was found to be greater at 17 degrees C than at higher temperatures (17 greater than 27 greater than 37 degrees C), suggesting a negative temperature correlation trend Na+-K+-ATPase was less sensitive to these compounds when compared with OS Mg++-ATPase and the inhibition was greater at higher temperatures (37 greater than 27 greater than 17 degrees C), suggesting a positive temperature correlation trend. Other DDT isomers and metabolites showed variable effects on Na+-K+-ATPase and OS Mg++-ATPases. DDD, but not DDE, inhibited both enzyme activities and the inhibition was independent of temperature. No significant differences were observed in the inhibitory potencies of the various DDT, DDD or DDE ring substitutes studied. The present data indicate that DDT, dicofol and methoxychlor were more effective inhibitors of OS Mg++-ATPase than Na+-K+-ATPase and that the inhibition of the former enzyme had a negative temperature dependence, a feature which parallels toxicity results in insects.",M2

Minced fish samples are emulsified with disodium hydrogen orthophosphate and trisodium citrate, ground with sodium sulfate, and eluted from a chromatographic column prepacked with alumina and silicic acid. The fats and fatty acids are solubilized and easily extracted from the tissues and retained by the column, while p,p'-DDT and its metabolites are quantitatively eluted with 40 mL n-hexane. The eluate is directly applied to a gas chromatographic column. Average recoveries of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites added to fish in vitro are 81%. The average coefficient of variation for recoveries of p,p'-DDT and its metabolites is less than 6.5% and the detection limit is 0.001 micrograms/g for p,p'-DDE, thus making this method very suitable for residue analysis.",M2
