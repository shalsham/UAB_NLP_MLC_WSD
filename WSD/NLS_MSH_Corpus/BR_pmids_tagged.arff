20066953,"Mass mortality associated with a frog virus 3-like Ranavirus infection in farmed tadpoles Rana catesbeiana from Brazil.Ranaviruses (Iridoviridae) are increasingly associated with mortality events in amphibians, fish, and reptiles. They have been recently associated with mass mortality events in Brazilian farmed tadpoles of the American bullfrog Rana catesbeiana Shaw, 1802. The objectives of the present study were to further characterize the virus isolated from sick R. catesbeiana tadpoles and confirm the etiology in these outbreaks. Sick tadpoles were collected in 3 farms located in Goiás State, Brazil, from 2003 to 2005 and processed for virus isolation and characterization, microbiology, histopathology, and parasitology. The phylogenetic relationships of Rana catesbeiana ranavirus (RCV-<e>BR</e>) with other genus members was investigated by PCR with primers specific for the major capsid protein gene (MCP) and the RNA polymerase DNA-dependent gene (Pol II). Sequence analysis and multiple alignments for MCP products showed &gt;99% amino acid identity with other ranaviruses, while Pol II products showed 100% identity. Further diagnostics of the pathology including histology and transmission electron microscopy confirmed the viral etiology of these mass deaths. As far as we know, this is the first report of a ranaviral infection affecting aquatic organisms in Brazil. Additionally, our results suggest that American bullfrogs may have served as a vector of transmission of this virus, which highlights the potential threat of amphibian translocation in the world distribution of pathogens.",M1
19936460,"Vaccination against the influenza virus and mortality due to cardiovascular diseases in the city of Sao Paulo.BACKGROUND: The effect of vaccination against the influenza virus on the mortality due to cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To analyze the mortality by CVD before and after the start of the vaccination against the Influenza virus in the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil. METHODS: We analyzed the mortality due to ischemic heart diseases (IHD), cerebrovascular diseases (CbVD) and external causes (EC) in the population of the metropolitan region of the city of Sao Paulo, Brazil, aged &gt; or = 60 years, before and after the start of the vaccination program against Influenza. The population estimates and mortality data were obtained, respectively, from the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics (IBGE; www.ibge.gov.<e>br</e>) and from the Brazilian Ministry of Health (www.datasus.gov.br) for the period between 1980 and 2006. The risk of death was adjusted by the direct method, using the 1960 world standard population. RESULTS: The comparisons between the inclinations of the regression lines were similar for CbVD (p = 0.931) and EC (p = 0.941); however, for IHD (p = 0.022), a significant decrease was observed in the regression line of the post-vaccination period, when compared to the pre-vaccination period. A change in the tendency towards mortality after 1996 was significant only for the IHD (p = 0.022), remaining unaltered for the CbVD (p = 0.931) and EC (p = 0.941). CONCLUSION: The vaccination against the Influenza virus was associated with a significant decrease in the mortality due to IHD.",M1
19848087,"Molecular characterization of Brazilian infectious bursal disease virus isolated from 1997 to 2005.This retrospective study concerned 41 infectious bursal disease virus (IBDV) isolates obtained from Brazilian broiler and layers flocks by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. Twenty-five of them were identified as very virulent (vv) by restriction enzyme analysis and by further nucleotide and phylogenetic analysis. All of them had the typical amino acid residues, and all clustered in a phylogenetic tree with the vvIBDV strains. Four amino acid substitutions, at positions D213N, G254D, S317R, and D323E, were common to 3 vv isolates, <e>Br</e>/03/DB, Br/03/CK, and Br/04/CR, and differed from other vv isolates and strains. These isolates came from the same locale, but were collected in different years, indicating that the vvIBDVs circulating on Brazilian farms are undergoing slight but continuous exchanges.",M1
19820814,"Portuguese-language version of the Epworth sleepiness scale: validation for use in Brazil.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to develop a Portuguese-language version of the Epworth sleepiness scale (ESS) for use in Brazil. METHODS: The steps involved in creating the ESS in Brazilian Portuguese (ESS-<e>BR</e>) were as follows: translation; back-translation; comparison (by a committee) between the translation and the back-translation; and testing in bilingual individuals. The ESS-BR was applied to a group of patients who were submitted to overnight polysomnography in order to identify obstructive sleep apnea-hypopnea syndrome (OSAHS), insomnia and primary snoring. A control group was composed of subjects with a history of normal sleep habits, without reported snoring. RESULTS: A total of 114 patients and 21 controls were included. The 8-item scores of the ESS-BR had an overall reliability coefficient of 0.83. The study group was composed of 59 patients with OSAHS, 34 patients with primary snoring and 21 patients with insomnia. One-way ANOVA demonstrated significant differences in ESS-BR scores among the four diagnostic groups (p &lt; 0.001). Post-hoc tests between groups showed that the ESS-BR scores of the patients with insomnia did not differ from those of the controls (p &gt; 0.05). The ESS-BR scores were significantly higher for OSAHS patients and for primary snorers than for controls (p &lt; 0.05). In addition, the scores for OSAHS patients were significantly higher than were those for primary snorers (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study demonstrate that the ESS-BR is a valid and reliable instrument for the assessment of daytime sleepiness, equivalent to its original version when applied to individuals who speak Brazilian Portuguese.",M1

We interviewed 150 relatives of patients randomly selected in four mental health care services in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. Subjects were interviewed with the Family Burden Interview Schedule (FBIS-<e>BR</e>) and a standardized socio-demographic questionnaire. Variables were grouped into thematic categories and separately analyzed to determine the relative importance of predictive factors. The results showed that subjective burden is influenced by objective burden and by factors related to the patient's clinical condition, the caregiver's and patient's living and health conditions and financial status, and increased demand for information on mental illness. Subjective burden was less when the caregiver practiced leisure and religious activities, publicly admitted to being the caregiver of a psychiatric patient, and had positive feelings toward the patient. The findings highlight the need to include family follow-up in the community model for psychiatric care.",M1
19721970,"Pharmaceutical services evaluation in Brazil: broadening the results of a WHO methodology.The objective of this paper is to explore and analyze the results of the Diagnosis of the Pharmaceutical Situation in Brazil (DiagAF-<e>Br</e>) from a regional perspective. The study made use of an exploratory approach of multiple cases based on the DiagAF-Br data collected in five Brazilian states. A descriptive analysis of selected indicators was performed in each of the Brazilian states in three pharmaceutical dimensions: access, quality, and rational use of medicines. The mainly results concerning the percentage of completed prescriptions varied from 1.1% in the State of Goiás to 98.6% in Espírito Santo; the percentage of patients who know how to take their medicines varied from 60.4% in Sergipe to 93.3% in Rio Grande do Sul. Educational level showed to be an important predictor of knowledge on how to use medicines, especially relevant when prescription is completed. The average number of prescribed medicines, approximately 2.1, did not show any difference between the visited sites. Different levels of management capacity and services organization were identified, suggesting the need for more adequate strategies to improve access, quality and mainly rational use of medicines in Brazil.",M1
19708026,"Mutagenicity of blue rayon extracts of fish bile as a biomarker in a field study.Blue rayon (<e>BR</e>) in combination with the Salmonella/microsome assay was used to evaluate the mutagenicity of fish bile samples. Specimens of Mugil curema from two sites were collected over a 1-year period. Piaçaguera channel contains high concentrations of total polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and other contaminants, while Bertioga channel was considered the reference sites in this study. Bile was extracted with BR and tested with TA98, TA100, and YG1041 strains with and without S9 in dose response experiments. PAH metabolite equivalents were analyzed using reverse-phase high performance liquid chromatography /fluorescence. Higher mutagenic responses were observed for the contaminated site; YG1041 with S9 was the most sensitive strain/condition. Mutagenicity ranged from 3,900 to 14,000 rev./mg at the contaminated site and from 1,200 to 2,500 rev./mg of BR at the reference site. The responses of YG1041 were much higher in comparison with the TA98 indicating the presence of polycyclic compounds from the aromatic amine class that cause frameshift mutation. TA100 showed a positive mutagenic response that was enhanced following S9 treatment at both sites suggesting the presence of polycyclic compounds that require metabolic activation. benzo(a)pyrene, naphthalene, and phenanthrene metabolite equivalents were also higher in the bile of fish collected at the contaminated site. It was not possible to correlate the PAH metabolite quantities with the mutagenic potency. Thus, a combination of the Salmonella/microsome assay with YG1041 with S9 from BR bile extract seems to be an acceptable biomarker for monitoring the exposure of fish to mutagenic polycyclic compounds.",M1
19701711,"Complete genome analysis of a rabies virus isolate from Brazilian wild fox.The complete genome sequence of wild-type rabies virus (RABV) isolated from a wild Brazilian hoary fox (Dusicyon sp.), the <e>BR</e>-Pfx1 isolate, was determined and compared with fixed RABV strains. The genome structure and organization of the BR-Pfx1 isolate were composed of 11,924 nt and included the five standard genes of rhabdoviruses. Sequences of mRNA start and stop signals for transcription were highly conserved among all structural protein genes of the BR-Pfx1 isolate. All amino acid residues in the glycoprotein (G) gene associated with pathogenicity were retained in the BR-Pfx1 isolate, while unique amino acid substitutions were found in antigenic region I of the nucleoprotein gene and III of G. These results suggest that although the standard genome structure and organization of the RABV isolate are common between the BR-Pfx1 isolate and fixed RABV strains, the unique amino acid substitutions in functional sites of the BR-Pfx1 isolate may result in different biological characteristics from fixed RABV strains.",M1
19669062,"User satisfaction with psychosocial healthcare services, Southern Brazil.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate user satisfaction with psychosocial healthcare services. METHODS: Qualitative and quantitative study conducted in psychosocial healthcare services in the states of Paraná, Santa Catarina and Rio Grande do Sul, Southern Brazil, in 2006. The study combined quantitative and qualitative methods. Quantitative epidemiological data from a cross-sectional study including 1,162 users of 30 psychosocial healthcare services was used. The instrument used to evaluate users' satisfaction was the Brazilian version of the WHO Users' Satisfaction Scale (SATIS-<e>BR</e>), a 1 to 5-point scale. Qualitative data was collected from five case studies using a fourth generation approach. Information was obtained from field observations and interviews (between ten and 13 users in each field, totaling 57 users) and presented to users in validation and negotiation workshops. RESULTS: The SATIS-BR scale showed that users positively evaluated all items, overall mean 4.4 (SD=0.4). Communication and relationship with psychosocial healthcare services staff had mean 4.5 (SD=0.5), and access to information through staff had mean 4.8. Satisfaction with care service was the lowest, mean 4.1, and general service infrastructure had mean 3.9. The qualitative study revealed that, according to users, the quality of treatment provided was good and the outcome was satisfactory. Their new status, better access to services, ending of their physical and social isolation, response to their demands and helping them reorganize their lives - all contributed to users' satisfaction. CONCLUSIONS: The complementary results of both study approaches showed that users are satisfied with care provided at the psychosocial healthcare services studied.",M1
19660430,"Leishmania sp. isolated from human cases of cutaneous leishmaniasis in Brazil characterized as Leishmania major-like.The identification and characterization of Leishmania are relevant to diagnosis, treatment, eco-epidemiology studies, prophylactic measures and control of the disease. Two strains of Leishmania (MHOM/<e>BR</e>/1971/BH49 and MHOM/BR/1971/BH121), isolated from human cutaneous leishmaniasis, were studied using biological and molecular characteristics, in comparison with WHO reference strains. These studies are important because both strains were incorporated in a vaccine against American cutaneous leishmaniasis, and one of these strains has been used to prepare specific and sensitive antigen for serodiagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis in Brazil. Studies were made on the growth rates of promastigotes in Grace's insect medium, infectivity to C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice, electrophoresic mobility patterns of isoenzymes, random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), simple sequence repeat-anchored PCR amplification (SSR-PCR) and DNA fingerprinting profiles, infectivity to murine macrophages and cellular immune response. Infections of mice and macrophages were significantly different among the strains studied. Attempts to infect mice with culture promastigotes were unsuccessful with BH121, but BH49 infected BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. Isoenzyme electrophoretic mobility patterns, RAPD and SSR-PCR using DNA amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with nine arbitrary primers, as well as DNA fingerprinting studies with a biotin-labeled 33.15 fingerprinting probe showed similar profiles to those of the Leishmania major WHO reference strain.",M1
19623441,"Reliability of the Brazilian version of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination Revised CAMCOG-R.The study' goal was to evaluate the reliability of the Cambridge Cognitive Examination Revised-Brazilian version (<e>Br</e>-CAMCOG-R), a neuropsychological battery measuring the global cognitive function. It was applied on 123 elders and retested at a mean interval of 30.7 days; 60 were evaluated by two raters at the same time. The intraclass coefficient for the set of items and for the subscales varied from 0.93 to 0.98. In the retests the agreement was nearly perfect for the set of items. There was no expressive range in the stability of the instrument for sex, age, schooling, or for the presence of dementia. The Cronbach' alpha of the set of items of the test was high (0.89). The Br-CAMCOG-R has obtained a high level of stability with time, agreement among raters, and optimum internal consistency; it can be useful for epidemiological studies and in specialized clinics to evaluate cognitive functions in elders.",M1
19578566,"[Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE): cross-cultural adaptation for use in Brazil]This article presents the results of the translation and cross-cultural adaptation of the Informant Questionnaire on Cognitive Decline in the Elderly (IQCODE) and the test-retest reliability of a version to be used in Brazil. An instrument review committee analyzed the conceptual and item equivalence. In order to analyze semantic equivalences, three translations and three back-translations were performed; a summary version was devised and pre-tested, and a test version elaborated. The Cronbach's +/- coefficient and intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) were used to measure the internal consistency and test-retest reliability, respectively. Of the 169 informants assessed, 97 were retested. A Cronbach's +/- of 0.94 and an ICC of 0.92 were found. The reliability levels lead to the conclusion that the IQCODE-<e>BR</e> version is easy to comprehend. Satisfactory equivalence to the original version was observed.",M1
19452078,"Lack of drug preparations for use in children in Brazil.OBJECTIVE: To identify drugs which are not suited for pediatric use in Brazil. METHODS: A descriptive study involving the development of a national list of unlicensed and off-label medications for pediatric use (problem drugs in pediatrics, PDP) through a literature review, a comparison among sources of the Brazilian pharmaceutical industry, and a survey with pediatricians. Drugs coded at the Anatomic Therapeutic Chemical (ATC) Classification System were analyzed regarding licensing status in Brazil and recommendations/indications in pediatrics, based on the following reference sources: the list of licensed drugs of the Brazilian National Health Surveillance Agency (2005), the Brazilian Dictionary of Pharmaceutical Specialties (2005-2007) and the website www.bulas.med.<e>br</e>. RESULTS: Our literature search returned 126 PDP, but 24 drugs were excluded due to absence of national reference. To compose the final list, 24 other drugs referred by pediatricians were added. Of the 126 PDP, 23 drugs were not licensed in the country for use in children; and of the 103 licensed drugs, 24 presented age-related restrictions for pediatric use. The pharmaceutical list included 42 therapeutic groups and 68 subgroups. The groups containing larger numbers of PDP were: antibiotics for systemic use (15), antiepileptics (8), antiasthmatics (7), and analgesics (7). The most frequent problems were: inappropriate dosage (35), unlicensed for pediatric use (28), age-related restrictions (23). CONCLUSIONS: The lack of pediatric drug formulations in Brazil shows a profile similar to that observed in other countries, which involves a wide range of clinically important products. This study brings a contribution to the evaluation of the needs and priorities that support the development of suitable medicines for the pediatric patient.",M1
19238213,"Ecological adaptation of wild peach palm, its in situ conservation and deforestation-mediated extinction in southern Brazilian Amazonia.BACKGROUND: The Arc of Fire across southern Amazonia seasonally attracts worldwide attention as forests are cut and burned for agricultural expansion. These forests contain numerous wild relatives of native South American crops, such as peach palm. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Our prospecting expeditions examined critical areas for wild peach palm in the Arc of Fire in Mato Grosso, Pará, Maranhão and Tocantins, as well as areas not previously examined in Amazonas and Amapá states. Recent digitization of the RADAM Brasil project permitted comparison among RADAM's parataxonomists' observations, previous botanical collections and our prospecting. Mapping on soils and vegetation types enabled us to hypothesize a set of ecological preferences. Wild peach palm is best adapted to Ultisols (Acrisols) in open forests across the Arc of Fire and westward into the more humid western Amazonia. Populations are generally small (fewer than 10 plants) on slopes above watercourses. In northern Mato Grosso and southern Pará soybean fields and pastures now occupy numerous areas where RADAM identified wild peach palm. The controversial <e>BR</e>-163 Highway is already eroding wild peach palm as deforestation expands. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Many of these populations are now isolated by increasing forest fragmentation, which will lead to decreased reproduction via inbreeding depression and eventual extinction even without complete deforestation. Federal conservation areas are less numerous in the Arc of Fire than in other parts of Brazilian Amazonia, although there are indigenous lands; these conservation areas contain viable populations of wild peach palm and require better protection than they are currently receiving. Ex situ conservation of these populations is not viable given the relative lack of importance of domesticated peach palm and the difficulty of maintaining even economically interesting genetic resources.",M1
19211294,"Psychometric properties of the Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale--Brazilian version.Parkinson's Disease Sleep Scale (PDSS) is a specific scale for the assessment of sleep disturbances in subjects with Parkinson's Disease (PD). This cross-sectional study set out to validate the PDSS in a Brazilian Portuguese Version (PDSS-<e>BR</e>). Ninety-five patients with PD participated in the study; their PD symptoms were evaluated by Unified Parkinson's Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS sections I-IV) and Hoehn and Yahr scale. Patients completed Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and PDSS-BR. PDSS-BR internal consistency was satisfactory (Cronbach's alpha: 0.82; all PDSS-BR items were significantly and positively associated with total score). Test-retest reliability for total PDSS-BR score was 0.94. PDSS-BR score was highly correlated with sleep PSQI scale (r(s) = -0.63; p &lt; 0.0001) and moderately with ESS (r(s) = -0.32; p &lt; 0.001) and UPDRS sections I (r(s) = -0.38; p &lt; 0.0001) and II (r(s) = -0.36; p &lt; 0.0001) and BDI (r(s) = -0.55; p &lt; 0.0001). Depressive symptoms, as determined by the BDI, were associated with significantly worse quality of nocturnal sleep, as measured by the PDSS-BR. The psychometric attributes of the PDSS-BR were satisfactory and consistent with those of previous studies. In summary, PDSS-BR can be useful for clinical and research purposes in Brazil.",M1
19052907,"Heat tolerance in Brazilian sheep: physiological and blood parameters.Thirty Santa Ines adult, non-lactating, non-pregnant ewes, ten with a brown coat, ten black coated and ten white coated, as well as ten Bergamasca and ten of mixed breed were used to evaluate the effect of climate on physiological and blood parameters in sheep. Two sample collections were taken (6 AM: and 2 PM: ) on six days. Sweating rate (SR), heart (HR) and breathing rates (<e>BR</e>), complete hemogram, rectal (RT) and skin temperatures (ST) were measured. Variance analyses were carried out using SAS(R). In general, there were significant differences between animals due to skin type, time and day of collection. White coated animals showed lower HR, BR and RT, with afternoon parameters higher than morning. Correlations between HR, BR, RT, SR and ST were medium and positive. Correlations between physiological and blood traits were in general negative and medium. Packed Cell Volume (PCV), total plasma proteins, red blood cell count and hemoglobin concentration had high positive correlations between each other. The first two autovectors explained 49% of variation between traits. White coated Santa Ines animals were shown to be better adapted to climatic conditions in Central Brazil and wool sheep more affected by heat.",M1
18925317,"Brazilian version of the foot health status questionnaire (FHSQ-<e>BR</e>): cross-cultural adaptation and evaluation of measurement properties.OBJECTIVE: To conduct a cross-cultural adaptation of the Foot Health Status Questionnaire into Brazilian-Portuguese and to assess its measurement properties. INTRODUCTION: This instrument is an outcome measure with 10 domains with scores ranging from 0-100, worst to best, respectively. The translated instrument will improve the examinations and foot care of rheumatoid arthritis patients. METHODS: The questions were translated, back-translated, evaluated by a multidisciplinary committee and pre-tested (n = 40 rheumatoid arthritis subjects). The new version was submitted to a field test (n = 65) to evaluate measurement properties such as test-retest reliability, internal consistency and construct validity. The Health Assessment Questionnaire, Numeric Rating Scale for foot pain and Sharp/van der Heijde scores for foot X-rays were used to test the construct validity. RESULTS: The cross-cultural adaptation was completed with minor wording adaptations from the original instrument. The evaluation of measurement properties showed high reliability with low variation coefficients between interviews. The alpha-Cronbach coefficients varied from 0.468 to 0.855, while correlation to the Health Assessment Questionnaire and Numeric Rating Scale was statistically significant for five out of eight domains. DISCUSSION: Intra- and inter-observer correlations showed high reliability. Internal consistency coefficients were high for all domains, revealing higher values for less subjective domains. As for construct validity, each domain revealed correlations with a specific group of parameters according to what the domains intended to measure. CONCLUSION: The FHSQ was cross-culturally adapted, generating a reliable, consistent, and valid instrument that is useful for evaluating foot health in patients with rheumatoid arthritis.",M1
18923798,"Childhood autism: translation and validation of the Childhood Autism Rating Scale for use in Brazil.OBJECTIVE: To translate the Childhood Autism Rating Scale into Brazilian Portuguese and to determine the initial psychometric properties of the resulting version (CARS-<e>BR</e>). METHODS: The methodology used to produce an adequate version included translation, backtranslation and evaluation of semantic equivalence. In order to determine its psychometric properties (internal consistency, validity and reliability), the CARS-BR was administered to 60 consecutive patients with autism, aged between 3 and 17 years and seen at a university hospital. RESULTS: Internal consistency was high, with a Cronbach's alpha of 0.82. Convergent validity, in comparison with the Autistic Traits Assessment Scale, exhibited a Pearson's correlation coefficient of r = 0.89. When correlated with the Global Assessment of Functioning Scale in order to evaluate discriminant validity, the CARS-BR exhibited a Pearson's coefficient of r = -0.75. Test-retest reliability exhibited a kappa coefficient of 0.90. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that the CARS-BR is a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating autism severity in Brazil.",M1

A total of 258 truck drivers were assessed and the variables studied were: body mass index, waist circumference, blood pressure, triglycerides, total and fraction cholesterol, glycemia and C reactive protein. Cardiovascular disease risk was evaluated by Framingham's risk score whereas the Metabolic Syndrome based on the First Brazilian Guideline for Diagnosis and Treatment of the Metabolic Syndrome. The significance level adopted was p&lt; 0.05 and univariate and multivariate analysis were applied. The average age was of 37.5+/-10.1. According to the anthropometric data, it was observed body mass index &gt; or =25 kg/m(2) in 82%, waist circumference &gt; or =94 cm in 58%, total cholesterol &gt;240 mg/dL in 9%, LDL-c &gt;160 mg/dL in 10%; HDL-c &lt;40 mg/dL in 20%, triglycerides &gt;200mg/dL in 22%, glycemia &gt;110 mg/dL in 7%, and C reactive protein &gt;0.5 mg/dL in 19%. Hypertension prevalence was 37%, 9% were identified at the highest/medium Framingham's risk score and 24% showed Metabolic Syndrome. The logistical regression analysis indicated independent association of the Metabolic Syndrome for the following variables (OD odds ratio, CI confidence interval at 95%): body mass index (OR = 1.4007 CI 95% 1.192-1.661), use to check cholesterol (OR = 0.1020 CI 0.017-0.589) and Framingham's risk score (OR = 26.389 CI 2.520-276.374). As a conclusion, it was observed a quite expressive prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors as well as Metabolic Syndrome in truck drivers.",M1
18813496,"[Healthcare practices in Nursing and Communication: a review of the literature]Changes in nurse healthcare practices, especially for projects such as Brazil's Family Health Program, prompted us to study the related communication processes. A review of the literature from January 1994 through to December 2004 examined 26 papers in Brazilian and international periodicals, four dissertations, three theses and four books in the BIREME data-bases (LILACS and SCIELO-<e>Br</e>). Using 'Communication', 'Family Health Program' and 'Nursing' as key words, 373 mentions were found for 'Communication' and 'Nursing', twelve mentions for 'Family Health Program' and 'Communication' (LILACS); eighteen mentions for 'Communication' and 'Nursing'; and no mentions for 'Family Health Program' and 'Communication' (SCIELO-Br). In order to analyze these findings, the publications located through this search were grouped under four trends in the links between Communication and Nursing practices: Communication within the Family Health Program teams; Communication in professional Nursing practice; Communication as a leadership tool for Nurses; and Communication in Nursing education. This study showed that although the most usual communication model for healthcare practices is still unilinear, there is already a clear trend towards more dialogue, which poses a challenge for nursing practices in the Family Health Program.",M1
18791045,"Cancer prevention campaigns and Internet access: promoting health or disease?BACKGROUND: The Internet has become the most popular source of reference on health-related issues. However, little has been invested in studies that use it as a tool to evaluate health-related cultural events as cancer prevention campaigns. AIMS: To correlate audience patterns on the web pages of a Brazilian Ministry of Health (MOH) cancer institute (http://www.inca.gov.<e>br</e>) with government campaigns in this area. METHODS: 24 consecutive months of observational study of a cancer site sponsored by the MOH, using a commercial software package to analyse electronic records (log files) of all visitors' movements. Variables observed included number of visits, time spent on each visit and the monthly return rate at six selected pages (three relating to cancer as a disease and three to prevention measures). RESULTS: The audience was observed to grow gradually over the 2 years, with peaks in the periods around the campaigns. The topics of most interest were concentrated in pages on cancer diagnostic and treatment technology. Pages on preventive measures were less visited during the campaigns, and their audience varied little over the 24 months. CONCLUSION: A historical analysis of log files for reference sites revealed interesting patterns that may be helpful for planning and evaluating institutional campaigns. Practical implications: in view of the results of this study, the website was improved to offer better information on preferred topics and to include more links with prevention-related pages. Log file assessment after health campaigns could provide useful input to planning.",M1
18764991,"[Risk behaviors for sexually transmitted diseases among truck drivers in Brazil]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the frequency of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) and associated risk factors based on self-reporting by long-haul truck drivers in Brazil. METHOD: From October 2005-October 2006, 641 long-haul truck drivers that travel federal highway <e>BR</e>-153, traversing the country from south to north, were interviewed. A structured interview was used to collect sociodemographic data. The truck drivers also completed a self-administered questionnaire on risk behaviors and STD history. The data were adjusted and analyzed using logistic regression. RESULTS: Of 641 drivers interviewed, 620 (96.7%) provided answers on STD history. Of these, 35.6% (95% confidence interval (CI) = 31.9-39.6) reported past or current STD. Being 30 years of age or older was statistically associated with having a history of STD. In addition, truck drivers who reported using amphetamines (odds ratio (OR) = 1.7; 95%CI = 1.1-2.6), having been incarcerated (OR = 2.2; 95%CI = 1.2-4.2), and sexual relations with sex professionals (OR = 1.9; 95%CI = 1.3-2.8) had increased odds for having a history of STD. CONCLUSION: These results confirm that Brazilian truck drivers are highly vulnerable to STD and show the importance of prevention programs targeting this specific group, one that is constantly on the move and may efficiently disseminate STD.",M1

METHODS: Analysis of the list of generic medications issued by   Diário Oficial da União  on July/12/2004 and of the page of the National Agency for Sanitary Surveillance (ANVISA) - www.anvisa.gov.<e>br</e>, using the Beers-Fick criteria. RESULTS: From the list of 299 products 20 (6.7% of the total) included in the Beers-Fick criteria were analyzed, mainly in the categories of anxiolytics, platelet antiaggregants, antiallergics, anti-angina and vasodilators, antiarrythmics, antidepressants, antispasmodics, anti-hypertensive's, non steroid antinflammatories, antiulceratives and cardiac glycosides. These criteria do not include drugs such as cough suppressants, cinnarizine, diltiazem, piracetam, quinolones, xanthines, creams, ointments and ophthalmic solutions which are also present in the list of generic medication. CONCLUSION: The Beers-Fick criteria may prevent use of drugs potentially inappropriate for the elderly, however, it should be stressed that these criteria are not complete for Brazilian generic medications.",M1
18617336,"Identification of unreported putative new bovine papillomavirus types in Brazilian cattle herds.The amplification by degenerate primers FAP59/FAP64 and sequencing allowed the detection of 15 putative new BPV types in cutaneous warts as well as in healthy skin. Four of these isolates were recently recognized as new BPV types (BPV-7, -8, -9, and -10) after determination of their complete genome sequences. In Brazil, investigations involving the definition of BPV types present in skin warts are still rare. The aim of the current study was to identify the BPV types associated with cutaneous papillomatosis observed in Brazilian cattle herds. Twenty-two cutaneous papilloma specimens were submitted to PCR assay employing the FAP primer pair. All PCR products with approximately 480 bp were submitted to direct sequencing. Cloning was performed for the amplicons which prior analysis revealed as putative new BPV types. From 16 cutaneous lesions, BPV-1, -2, and -6 were identified in two, six, and eight papilloma specimens, respectively. In addition, four putative new BPV types were identified in other six skin warts, and then designated as BPV/<e>BR</e>-UEL2 to -5. The detection of the BPV-1, -2, and -6 types in skin wart specimens supports the existence of these BPV types throughout the Brazilian cattle herd. In addition, the identification of four putative new BPV types is the first report of the presence of different BPV types in the American continent.",M1
18579102,"Development of a Trypanosoma cruzi (TcI) isolate in the digestive tract of an unfamiliar vector, Triatoma brasiliensis (Hemiptera, Reduviidae).Triatoma brasiliensis is an important vector of Trypanosoma cruzi, commonly found in semi-arid areas of north-eastern Brazil. T. cruzi (TcI) is a widely distributed genotype in all biomes of Brazil. To evaluate selective pressures exerted by a vector species on the development of TcI derived from a different biome (Atlantic Rainforest), T. brasiliensis larvae were infected with the MDID/<e>BR</e>/1994/C48 isolate. Parasite densities of T. cruzi were determined in three regions of the gut at 3, 5 and 10 days after feeding. Percentages of the different stages of the flagellate were identified in Giemsa stained smears. The TcI isolate possessed always significantly higher densities in the rectum than in the small intestine. Epimastigotes reached their highest percentage at 3 days after feeding in the small intestine and trypomastigotes at 10 days after feeding in the rectal wall. Additionally, high metacyclogenesis rates in the T. brasiliensis gut showed competence of this TcI strain to complete its life cycle in this unfamiliar vector species.",M1
18480237,"Genetic and antigenic diversities of major immunoreactive proteins in globally distributed Ehrlichia canis strains.The extent of knowledge regarding the diversity of globally distributed Ehrlichia canis strains has been limited to information gained from a few evolutionarily conserved genes. In this study, E. canis strains from the United States (strain Jake [US]), Brazil (strain São Paulo [<e>BR</e>]), and Israel (strain 611 [IS] and Ranana [IS-R]) were used to examine the antigenic and genetic diversities of four well-characterized major immunoreactive protein genes/proteins. gp36 and gp200 were the most divergent genes, and nucleotide substitutions in the gp36 tandem repeat region of the IS strain, but not the IS-R strain, resulted in two amino acid differences (S--&gt;P and P--&gt;T) in each nine-amino-acid repeat (epitope-containing region). DNA sequences of gp19 and gp140 were completely conserved in the US and BR strains, but differences were found in the Israeli strains, including two fewer tandem repeats in gp140 and a single amino acid substitution in gp19 from the IS strain. E. canis whole-cell lysates from each isolate were examined by Western immunoblotting using sera from naturally infected dogs from each country, and four major immunoreactive proteins (gp19, gp36, gp140, and gp200) were identified in each strain using protein-specific antisera. The US and BR strains exhibited highly conserved immunoreactive protein profiles, while some differences were identified in the IS strain. Sera from naturally infected Israeli dogs confirmed gene sequencing information, which demonstrated two distinct E. canis strains, defined by the gp36 gene. Conversely, gp19 was strongly reactive and present in all E. canis isolates. gp140 and gp200 were also present in all strains, although gp140 in the IS strain had two fewer tandem repeats and exhibited a smaller mass.",M1

The causative role and prognostic significance of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) association in patients with HL is controversial. Our aim was to perform a comparative study of EBV association in 2 Latin American pediatric HL series, and to correlate it with patient's survival. Epstein-Barr encoded RNAs in situ hybridization and latent membrane protein 1 immunohistochemistry were performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded HL biopsies from 176 pediatric patients from 2 public institutions from Argentina and Southeast Brazil. Mixed cellularity subtype was prevalent in Argentine HL (Arg HL) (52%) and nodular sclerosis subtype in Brazilian HL (<e>BR</e> HL) (83%). EBV expression was detected in 52% of cases, namely 54% Arg HL and 48% Br HL. EBV was significantly associated with mixed cellularity subtype in both populations. In Arg HL, EBV positivity was significantly higher in patients&lt;or=10 years (P=0.0011). Event-free survival did not attain statistical significance neither in Arg HL (P=0.5317), nor in Br HL (P=0.8321). Our results do not support EBV association stated for pediatric HL in developing countries. Correlation of younger age with EBV infection only in Argentine patients might be related to a different age background. In our pediatric series, EBV status cannot be used as prognostic factor.",M1
18327450,"[Work in mental health: a job satisfaction and work impact study]Knowledge of job satisfaction and work impact among psychiatric staff is highly useful for policymakers and mental health professionals. Since there are few studies on this issue in Brazil, a cross-sectional study was carried out among mental health professionals. Data were collected for 133 professionals from 4 mental health services in Rio de Janeiro, using SATIS-<e>BR</e> and IMPACTO-BR scales and a socio-demographic questionnaire. Statistical associations were analyzed using the Mann-Whitney, Kruskal-Wallis, and chi-square tests and multiple linear regression. SPSS 10.1 for Windows was used for statistical analyses. Mean satisfaction was 3.30 and mean work impact was 2.08 (on a scale from 1 to 5). 62.4% of subjects reported moderate satisfaction. Mental health workers with less schooling showed higher satisfaction. Work impact was not associated with any explanatory variable. The results for job satisfaction were similar to those of other studies. Work impact was very low. Unlike studies from the United States and Europe, there were no differences between the community-based and in-hospital staff.",M1
19450094,"Cost-minimisation analysis of erlotinib in the second-line treatment of non-small-cell lung cancer: a Brazilian perspective.OBJECTIVE: A cost-minimisation and budget impact analysis of erlotinib versus docetaxel or pemetrexed as second-line treatment for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Costs and budgetary impacts were estimated from the perspective of a Brazilian private healthcare payer, based on results of the <e>BR</e>.21 study of erlotinib and pivotal trials of docetaxel and pemetrexed. A 126-day timeframe was evaluated, based on the progression-free survival determined for erlotinib in BR.21. A Delphi panel identified local practices and associated costs in Brazil. Other costs accounted for included medical payments, pre- and post-chemotherapy medication and drug administration costs. Multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed, but given the short time frame used, discounting was not applied. RESULTS: Total costs were R$26,825 for erlotinib, R$42,284 for docetaxel and R$79,841 for pemetrexed. Cost savings with erlotinib were attributable to lower acquisition costs (R$26,795 vs. R$40,217 for docetaxel and R$78,911 for pemetrexed) and lower costs for the management of side effects. Sensitivity analyses confirmed the robustness of the results. The budget impact analysis showed savings with erlotinib in the first year, ranging from R$3 million to R$28 million. CONCLUSION: Erlotinib is cost-saving over established chemotherapy in the second-line treatment of advanced NSCLC under the Brazilian private healthcare system.",M1

17979536,"A hard tick relapsing fever group spirochete in a Brazilian Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus.Tick-borne diseases usually comprise a complex epidemiological and ecological network connecting the vector, pathogen, and a group of host species. Symptoms associated with Lyme disease have been reported in Brazil, but no Borrelia sp. has been definitively related to these events. Here we have identified a B. lonestari/B. theileri-related spirochete DNA in the cattle tick Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) microplus from Brazil. Four hundred R. microplus and 80 Amblyomma cajennense ticks were screened, and only 1 horse-fed R. microplus was infected. A Borrelia sp. 16S rDNA sequence was amplified by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the total tick DNA with 99% similarity to B. theileri and B. lonestari. Partial flaB sequence was also obtained, demonstrating 96% similarity to the B. lonestari flagellin gene, and the resultant putative amino acid sequence demonstrated 97% identity to B. lonestari flagellin. Moreover, partial glpQ sequence demonstrated 92% similarity to the B. lonestari gene, with a putative amino acid sequence 90% identical to the B. lonestari glycerophosphodiester phosphodiesterase. Phylogenetic analyses clearly include this Brazilian Borrelia sp., denoted  Borrelia,  sp-<e>BR</e> in a group of spirochetes aligned with B. theileri and B. lonestari. Thus, hard tick relapsing fever group spirochetes represent a clade of widespread bacteria and herein we describe the first molecular identification of a Borrelia sp. in South America.",M1

17669566,"Atmospheric pollutants monitoring by analysis of epiphytic lichens.The Canoparmelia texana epiphytic lichenized fungi was used to monitor atmospheric pollution in the São Paulo metropolitan region, SP, Brazil. The cluster analysis applied to the element concentration values confirmed the site groups of different levels of pollution due to industrial and vehicular emissions. In the distribution maps of element concentrations, higher concentrations of Ba and Mn were observed in the vicinity of industries and of a petrochemical complex. The highest concentration of Co found in lichens from the São Miguel Paulista site is due to the emissions from a metallurgical processing plant that produces this element. For <e>Br</e> and Zn, the highest concentrations could be associated both to vehicular and industrial emissions. Exploratory analyses revealed that the accumulation of toxic elements in C. texana may be of use in evaluating the human risk of cardiopulmonary mortality due to prolonged exposure to ambient levels of air pollution.",M1
17653456,"HIV genotyping among female sex workers in the State of Santa Catarina.The objective of this study was to investigate the frequency of HIV infection among female sex workers in the port area of Imbituba (State of Santa Catarina), and to identify the viral subtype and its susceptibility to antiretroviral medications. Ninety women were interviewed between December 2003 and February 2004. Six (6.7%) were HIV-positive. Genotyping for HIV, performed on four samples, detected subtype C in three of them, which is predominant in Africa and Asia, and subtype B in one of them, which is prevalent in Brazil, USA and Europe. The results suggest that the Port of Imbituba may be one of the gateways for HIV-1 subtype C to enter Brazil, and for its dissemination to the rest of the country and the Mercosul area, along the highway <e>BR</e>-101. This points towards the need for preventive work to reduce the introduction and dissemination of HIV subtype C in Brazil.",M1
17573656,"Homology of polytene elements between Drosophila and Zaprionus determined by in situ hybridization in Zaprionus indianus.The drosophilid Zaprionus indianus due to its economical importance as an insect pest in Brazil deserves more investigation into its genetics. Its mitotic karyotype and a line-drawing map of its polytene chromosomes are already available. This paper presents a photomap of Z. indianus polytene chromosomes, which was used as the reference map for identification of sections marked by in situ hybridization with gene probes. Hybridization signals for Hsp70 and Hsr-omega were detected, respectively, in sections 34B and 32C of chromosome V of Z. indianus, which indicates its homology to the chromosomal arm 3R of Drosophila melanogaster and, therefore, to Muller's element E. The main signal for Hsp83 gene probe hybridization was in section 17C of Z. indianus chromosome III, suggesting its homology to arm 3L of D. melanogaster and to element D of Muller. The Ubi probe hybridized in sections 10C of chromosome II and 17A of chromosome III. Probably the 17A is the polyubiquitin locus, with homology to arm 3L of D. melanogaster and to the mullerian D element, as suggested also by Hsp83 gene location. The <e>Br</e>-C gene was mapped in section 1D, near the tip of the X chromosome, indicating its homology to the X chromosome of D. melanogaster and to mullerian element A. The Dpp gene probe hybridized mainly in the section 32A of chromosome V and, at lower frequencies to other sections, although no signal was observed as expected in the correspondent mullerian B element. This result led to the suggestion of a rearrangement including the Dpp locus in Z. indianus, the secondary signals possibly pointing to related genes of the TGF-beta family. In conclusion, the results indicate that chromosomes X, III, V of Z. indianus are respectively correspondents to elements A, D, and E of Muller. At least chromosome V of Z. indianus seems to share synteny with the 3R arm of D. melanogaster, as indicated by the relative positions of Hsp70 and Hsr-omega, although the Dpp gene indicates a disruption of synteny in its distal region.",M1
17435929,"Family Burden Interview Scale for relatives of psychiatric patients (FBIS-<e>BR</e>): reliability study of the Brazilian version.OBJECTIVE: Psychiatric deinstitutionalization resulted in greater involvement of families in daily care of patients. Family caregivers burden has been described by international researches. In Brazil very few studies investigated family burden with validated scales, perhaps due to the restrict availability of scales to measure this construct. The present study examined the reliability of the Brazilian version of the Family Burden Interview Schedule. METHOD: Scale reliability was assessed through its internal consistency and temporal stability. A sample of 243 family caregivers of psychiatric patients attending public outpatient services were interviewed with the scale. Socio-demographic data were collected with a standardized form. A sub-sample of 42 relatives participated in a re-test, after 3 weeks, for assessment of the scale temporal stability. RESULTS: Cronbach alpha coefficients ranged from 0.58 to 0.90 for global and domains scores. Pearson correlation coefficients and intra-class correlation coefficients for test and retest ranged from 0.54 to 0.90. DISCUSSION: Results for internal consistency were similar to the original scale. Four subscales presented alpha coefficients superior to the original ones. The temporal stability cannot be compared because this analysis was not performed for the original scale. CONCLUSION: The Brazilian version of the scale had good psychometric properties of temporal stability and internal consistency.",M1
17377730,"Brazil's Cuiabá- Santarém (<e>BR</e>-163) Highway: the environmental cost of paving a soybean corridor through the Amazon.Brazil's Cuiabá-Santarém (BR-163) Highway provides a valuable example of ways in which decision-making procedures for infrastructure projects in tropical forest areas need to be reformulated in order to guarantee that environmental concerns are properly weighed. BR-163, which is slated to be paved as an export corridor for soybeans via the Amazon River, traverses an area that is largely outside of Brazilian government control. A climate of generalized lawlessness and impunity prevails, and matters related to environment and to land tenure are especially unregulated. Deforestation and illegal logging have accelerated in anticipation of highway paving. Paving would further speed forest loss in the area, as well as stimulate migration of land thieves (grileiros) to other frontiers. An argument is made that the highway should not be reconstructed and paved until after a state of law has been established and it has been independently certified that sufficient governance prevails to secure protected areas and enforce environmental legislation. A waiting period is needed after this is achieved before proceeding with the highway paving. Above all, the logical sequence of steps must be followed, whereby environmental costs are assessed, reported, and weighed prior to making de facto decisions on implementation of infrastructure projects. Deviation from this logical sequence is a common occurrence in many parts of the world, especially in tropical areas.",M1
17180637,"Cross-cultural adaptation of the Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) to Brazilian Portuguese language.The Behçet's Disease Current Activity Form (BDCAF) is a clinical instrument used to assess the activity of Behçet's disease (BD), which was originally developed in English. The aim of the present study was to perform a cross-cultural adaptation of the BDCAF to Brazilian Portuguese language and to evaluate its reliability in a population of Brazilian patients with BD. Brazilian Portuguese version of the BDCAF, named <e>BR</e>-BDCAF, was obtained according to established guidelines. Forty Brazilian patients with BD diagnosed according to the International Study Group for Behçet's Disease criteria were assessed by two rheumatologists in independent sessions and submitted to the BR-BDCAF. Inter- and intraobserver agreement were then evaluated by kappa scores (values higher than 0.6 indicated good agreement). Good inter- and intraobserver agreements were achieved for the most common manifestations of BD: kappa scores higher than 0.6 were obtained for oral and genital ulcerations, skin lesions, and articular and general complaints. Moderate interobserver agreement was obtained for ocular activity (kappa 0.483) and fair interobserver agreement was obtained for gastrointestinal (kappa 0.322), major vessel (kappa 0.281), and central nervous system activity (kappa 0.304). BR-BDCAF was found to be a reliable instrument for the classic mucocutaneous and articular manifestations of BD and for general complaints, but complementary assessment is needed to evaluate specific visceral involvement for disease activity.",M1
17141437,"Immunological and allergenic responses induced by latex fractions of Calotropis procera (Ait.) R.<e>Br</e>.Immunological and allergenic responses against the latex of Calotropis procera were investigated in mice by oral and subcutaneous routes. The latex was fractionated according to water solubility and molecular size of its components. The fractions were named as non-dialyzable latex (NDL) corresponding to the major latex proteins, dialyzable latex (DL) corresponding to low molecular size substances and rubber latex (RL) which was highly insoluble in water. Anti-sera against these fractions were assayed for total IgG and IgA titration by ELISA and IgE and IgG(1) were quantified by passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) in rats and mice, respectively. None of the fractions induced antibodies level increases when mice received latex fractions by oral route and thus, did not develop allergy. Nonetheless, anti-sera of mice sensitized with NDL and RL by subcutaneous route displayed considerable immunological response while DL did not. IgG level augmented consistently against NDL and RL while IgA response was detected only to NDL. NDL and RL induced very strong PCA reactions suggesting that both fractions would contain latex substances involved in allergy. Furthermore, protein analysis of NDL and RL suggests that RL still retain residual proteins abundantly found in NDL that could explain its similar allergenic effect. No IgG(1) reaction was detected in any of the anti-sera tested. According to the results, the proteins of latex of Calotropis procera can provoke allergy by subcutaneous route. The NDL has previously shown to display anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities by intraperitoneal injection. It should be relevant to determine whether NDL could induce such activities when assayed by oral route since it was ineffective to induce allergy by this way.",M1

(2000). http://www.planalto.gov.<e>br</e>/ccivil_03/Leis/L10167.htm]. Nevertheless, not enough surveys have been carried out to measure the impact of the prohibition. The objective of the present survey was to compare the use of tobacco by primary and secondary school students in 1997 and 2004, that is, before and after the ban on tobacco advertising in Brazil. Two surveys were conducted (in 1997 and 2004) using the same methodology, with a target population of primary (from the fifth grade on) and secondary public schools in ten different Brazilian capitals. The sampling was done by conglomerates, stratified, and obtained in two stages. In total, 15,501 students were surveyed in 1997, and 21,712 in 2004. The questionnaire was adapted from an instrument developed by WHO, anonymous, self-administered, and applied collectively in the classroom. In a comparison of the two surveys (1997 and 2004) tobacco lifetime use (used any psychotropic drug at least once in their life) decreased significantly in seven out of ten capitals surveyed. The 11-12 year old age group experienced the largest decrease in tobacco lifetime use. There was a decrease in lifetime use for males in nine capitals, and in eight capitals for females. A decrease was also observed in heavy tobacco use also in eight capitals. In conclusion there was a significant decrease in tobacco consumption among the surveyed students, suggesting that the decrease is related to changes in public policy in Brazil over the surveyed period.",M1

Some 451 individuals were studied, among whom 17 cases of American tegumentary leishmaniasis (ATL) were diagnosed (six women and 11 men). Age varied from one to 64 years. Eleven patients had from one to three lesions. As for reservoirs, three opossums were captured. No hemoflagellates were found in the blood tests. Lutzomyia umbratilis was the predominant vector species captured. Many ATL patients were engaged in activities that exposed them to Leishmania vectors. Some patients may have been infected in the household and peridomiciliary environments. The epidemiological profile of ATL in this community is similar that of other foci in the region.

16990982,"<e>BR</e>-319: Brazil's Manaus-Porto Velho highway and the potential impact of linking the arc of deforestation to central amazonia.Brazil's BR-319 Highway linked Manaus, in the state of Amazonas, to Porto Velho, Rondônia, until it became impassable in 1988. Now it is proposed for reconstruction and paving, which would facilitate migration from the  Arc of Deforestation  in the southern part of the Amazon region to new frontiers farther north. The purpose of the highway, which is to facilitate transport to São Paulo of products from factories in the Manaus Free Trade Zone, would be better served by sending the containers by ship to the port of Santos. The lack of a land connection to Manaus currently represents a significant barrier to migration to central and northern Amazonia. Discourse regarding the highway systematically overestimates the highway's benefits and underestimates its impacts. A variety of changes would be needed prior to paving the highway if these potential impacts are to be attenuated. These include zoning, reserve creation, and increased governance in various forms, including deforestation licensing and control programs. More fundamental changes are also needed, especially the abandonment of the long-standing tradition in Brazil of granting squatters' rights to those who invade public land. Organizing Amazonian occupation in such a way that road construction and improvement cease to lead to explosive and uncontrolled deforestation should be a prerequisite for approval of the BR-319 and other road projects for which major impacts are expected. These projects could provide the impetus that is needed to achieve the transition away from appropriation of public land by both small squatters and by grileiros (large-scale illegal claimants). A delay in reconstructing the highway is advisable until appropriate changes can be effected.",M1

16870494,"Blue rayon-anchored technique/Salmonella microsome microsuspension assay as a tool to monitor for genotoxic polycyclic compounds in Santos estuary.The most important harbor of Brazil is located in Santos Estuary. In the 1970s, this area was one of the major examples of coastal degradation and although the quality of the environment has improved, the sediment is still contaminated with polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and mutagenic activity. Because of sediment dredging and consequently contaminants resuspension, it is useful to have reliable methods to monitor the water quality. Considering that blue rayon (<e>BR</e>) has been successfully used in evaluation of mutagenicity and PAHs content the objective of this work was to verify the applicability and adapt the methodology to monitor the water for mutagenic activity using the BR associated with the Salmonella assay. Analysis of three sites with different levels of contamination was performed using a modification of the BR hanging method denominated in this work BR anchored technique. The microsuspension protocol of the Salmonella/microsome assay was employed with the strain YG1041. The water from the site 1 the most contaminated and under influence of the steel mill discharge presented the highest potency reaching 36,000 revertants/g of BR with S9. Sites 2 and 3 showed less mutagenicity than site 1 with values approximately 1000 revertants/g of BR. We conclude that the BR anchored technique associated with Salmonella assay using YG1041 is a reliable alternative to monitor estuarine waters, especially in regions where sediment resuspension or acute pollution episodes can occur.",M1
16778699,"Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the Neck Disability Index and Neck Pain and Disability Scale.STUDY DESIGN: This study's design was a cross-cultural validation of the Neck Disability Index and Neck Pain and Disability Scale. OBJECTIVES: This study's objective was to translate, culturally adapt, and validate a Brazilian Portuguese version of the Neck Disability Index (NDI-<e>BR</e>) and the Neck Pain and Disability Scale (NPDS-BR). SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Although several valid measures exist for measurement of neck pain and functional impairment, these measures have yet been validated in Brazilian Portuguese. Successful linguistic and cultural translation may allow appropriate cross-cultural comparison for clinical and laboratory research analysis. METHODS: The NDI-BR and NPAD-BR were culturally and linguistically translated from English into Brazilian Portuguese. The translated version of the instrument was administered to 203 patients at a midsize hospital in southern Brazil. Psychometric evaluation included factor analysis, internal reliability measures, test-retest reliability at 1 and 7 days, and criterion validity comparison with the Brazilian version of the SF-36. RESULTS: Factor analyses demonstrated a single-factor subscale for the NDI-BR and three subscales for the NPDS-BR. An item analysis showed a high degree of internal consistency for the NDI-BR (r = 0.74) and the three subscales of the NPDS-BR (subscale 1, r = 0.89; subscale 2, r = 0.81; subscale 3, r = 0.72). Test-retest reliability was also acceptable at for the NDI-BR (0.98 at baseline and 0.48 at 7 days) and subset one (0.96 at baseline and 0.91 at 7 days), subset 2 (0.96 at baseline and 0.62 at 7 days), and subset 3 (0.52 at baseline and 0.45 at 7 days) of the NPDS-BR. Construct validity was established during comparison of the Brazilian version of the SF-36. Only items associated with physical role, bodily pain, and emotional role failed significant correlation.

From August to September 2002, solid waste samples from southern Belo Horizonte, capital of the State of Minas Gerais, were collected and sent to the solid waste treatment and disposal site at <e>BR</e>-040 for segregation and quantification. Sharps (objects that can cause cuts or puncture wounds) made up 0.02+/-0.02% of the collected waste, while non-sharps accounted for 5.47+/-1.11%. In the sharps category, the majority were razor blades (0.01+/-0.01%), while among non-sharps the most frequent components were toilet paper (3.00+/-0.90%), diapers (2.21+/-1.08%), and sanitary napkins (0.22+/-0.12%). Household infectious waste was twice the total amount of waste (infectious + common) from healthcare units. The study was discussed in light of the health hazards and safety aspects for formal and informal waste collectors.",M1
16410953,"Patterns of antennal sensilla of Panstrongylus megistus from three Brazilian states.The objective of the present study was to analyze and describe the phenotype of the antennal sensilla of Panstrongylus megistus, one of the epidemiologically most important species of triatomines in Brazil. Specimens from the Brazilian states of Goiás (GO), Minas Gerais (MG), and Rio Grande do Sul (RS) were compared, based on studies of four types of sensilla on three antennal segments: thick-walled trichoid (TK), thin-walled trichoid (TH), bristles (<e>BR</e>), and basiconica (BA). Discriminant analysis allowed the separation of the RS specimens from those of GO and MG. Multivariate discriminant analysis demonstrated that the sensilla of males differed from those of females, the variables with greatest weight being the BA of all three segments and the TK of flagellum 1. The basiconica sensilla were significantly more abundant in females, on all three segments. Antennal sensilla patterns also demonstrated significant differences among P. megistus specimens.",M1
15805208,"Cross-cultural adaptation and validation of the Brazilian Portuguese version of the short musculoskeletal function assessment questionnaire: the SMFA-<e>BR</e>.BACKGROUND: This study was designed to translate, culturally adapt, and validate a Brazilian Portuguese version of the Short Musculoskeletal Function Assessment Questionnaire (SMFA-BR). METHODS: The SMFA was translated from English into Brazilian Portuguese. Translations were synthesized, translated back into English, and then submitted to a committee of clinical, psychometric, and language experts. The questionnaire was then administered to 220 trauma patients at a midsize hospital in southern Brazil. Test-retest reliability was examined at one and seven days. Scale reliability and validity were assessed, and factor structure was analyzed. RESULTS: Patients with only one region of dysfunction reported less dysfunction than did patients with two or three regions of dysfunction. Both the SMFA-BR dysfunction and the SMFA-BR bother scores had significant correlations with all Brazilian Short Form-36 (SF-36) subscales except for bodily pain. Test-retest reliabilities, as determined by intraclass correlation analyses, were 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.97, 1.00) at one day (n = 10) and 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.96, 1.00) at seven days (n = 17) for the dysfunction index and 0.99 (95% confidence interval, 0.98, 1.00) at one day (n = 10) and 0.97 (95% confidence interval, 0.97, 1.00) at seven days (n = 17) for the bother index. Cronbach alpha reliabilities were 0.95 (95% confidence interval, 0.93, 0.97) and 0.91 (95% confidence interval, 0.89, 0.94) for the dysfunction and bother indices, respectively. Minimal ceiling and floor effects were observed for the bother subscale only. Exploratory factor analysis yielded a three-factor structure: upper-extremity dysfunction, lower-extremity dysfunction, and bother. CONCLUSIONS: A reliable and valid Brazilian Portuguese version of the SMFA was developed. It will facilitate the examination of functional performance within a large patient population as well as allow cross-cultural comparisons.",M1

Species were differentiated according to the morphology of the macroconidia, microconidia and their arrangement in chains or false heads, the size and type of conidiophore, and the presence or absence of chlamydospores. The species were identified as F. semitectum, F. equiseti, F. oxysporum, F. solani, F. anthophilum, F. sporotrichioides, F. moniliforme, and Fusarium sp. Among the species, F. semitectum was the most frequently detected. None of these species were pathogenic when inoculated in susceptible cowpea cultivar (<e>BR</e> 17-Gurgueia). But, an isolate of F. oxysporum f. sp. tracheiphilum used as a standard of comparison for pathogenicity (control) induced symptoms of yellowing, vascular wilting, and death of a susceptible cowpea cultivar under the same environmental conditions.",M1
15721877,"Diesel emissions significantly influence composition and mutagenicity of ambient particles: a case study in São Paulo, Brazil.In 2003, a bus strike paralyzed the fleet of buses in Sao Paulo, Brazil during 3 days, from 6 to 8 of April, the complete interruption of services being achieved on the 7th. We evaluated the effect of the absence of this source of pollution on the composition, mutagenicity, and toxicity of the fine particulate material collected during this period. Particles were sampled in glass fiber filters on days 7 and 15 of April of 2003 (strike and nonstrike days, respectively), using a high-volume sampler. Trace element determinations (As, <e>Br</e>, Co, Cl, Fe, La, Mn, Sb, Sc, and Th) of particulate material samples were carried out by neutron activation analysis. Sulfur determination was done by X-ray fluorescence analysis. The ratio between nonstrike/strike concentrations of hydrocarbons associated with automotive emissions (benzene, toluene, ethyl-benzene, and xylenes; BTEX) was determined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Mutagenesis of testing solutions was determined by means of the Tradescantia micronucleus assay in early tetrads of Tradescantia pallida. The inhibition of mitosis of the cells of the primary meristema of the root tips of Allium cepa was used as an index of the toxicity. Fine particle trace element contents were lower during the strike. The concentrations of sulfur and BTEX were 50% and 39.3% lower, respectively, on the strike day. A significant (P=0.038) reduction of micronuclei induced by fine particles sampled during the strike was observed. No effect of the strike on toxicity was detected. These results indicate that a program aiming to reduce emissions of the bus fleet in our town may impact positively the air quality by reducing the mutagenic potential of ambient particles.",M1
14986716,"Solid waste disposal in urban areas and health--the case of Belo Horizonte, Brazil.The presence of sanitary or controlled landfill in urban areas and its implications for the health of the population that lives in its bordering area has been little investigated. The presence of these deposits, with design or operational problems, can end up providing a likely location for the proliferation of diverse vectors and favouring uncontrolled emissions, which may affect health, both for the people that work and live in these places and those that live nearby. This paper describes a study carried out in the city of Belo Horizonte, Brazil, with the objective of associating the presence of the <e>BR</e> 040 sanitary landfill, located in the urban environment, and the health of the neighbouring population. There were 475 possibilities of occurrences studied, covering 19 different combinations for association between the exposure factor and the groupings of researched diseases (respiratory diseases, diarrhoea and skin diseases). However, of this total only 33 results were shown to be significant in showing the existence of an association. For these results, the variable exposures identified as a risk factor showed an odds ratio ranging between 1.20 and 13.75. Although without an evidenced relationship, respiratory diseases appeared as a relevant outcome in the study, as they were present in 23 of the 33 studied combinations in which the results were significant.",M1
12740080,"Comparison of body mass index values proposed by Cole et al. (2000) and Must et al.

(<e>Br</e>. Med. J. 2000; 320: 1) and Must et al. (Am. J. Clin. Nutr. 1991; 53: 839 &amp; 54: 773) with weight-for-height index in the nutritional evaluation of children. DESIGN: Criterion standards for diagnostic tests. SETTING:: North-east and south-east Brazil. SUBJECTS: Two thousand nine hundred and twenty children studied in Life Pattern Research performed by the Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics in 1997. Main outcome measures are the sensitivity, specificity and agreement of BMI values proposed by Must et al. (1991) and Cole et al. (2000). RESULTS: Sensitivity of values proposed by both authors was around 90%. Specificity was almost 100% considering weight-for-height index as the gold standard. The agreement of both values with weight-for-height index, based on kappa results, was good and in pre-school children it was excellent. CONCLUSIONS: Values proposed by Cole et al. (2000) and Must et al. (1991) should be used carefully to screen obesity in childhood but can be used to  diagnose  overweight children with a very low chance of having false-positive results. Although the values proposed by both authors performed similarly, use of Cole et al.'s values should be encouraged. The latter cover children from 2 to 6 years old; their values are presented for six-month age intervals; they are based on a larger sample from six different countries; and they are related to the definition of adult obesity.",M1

The full nucleotide sequences of three DEN-1 virus isolated from DEN fever (DF) and DEN hemorrhagic fever patients in northeastern Brazil in 1997 (<e>BR</e>/97) and one from a DF patient in the south of Brazil in 2001 (BR/01) were compared to that of the reference strain BR/90 obtained in the city of Rio de Janeiro in 1990. Sequence analysis showed that the structural proteins were remarkably conserved between all isolates. A total of 27 amino acid changes occurred throughout the non-structural proteins. Among them, nine amino acid substitutions were specific of BR/97 and BR/01 isolates, indicating that in situ evolution of these strains had occurred. Within the BR/97 and BR/01 samples, some amino acid substitutions have been previously identified in DEN-1 virus strains sequenced so far, suggesting that recombination events might have occurred.",M1

The parasite from patients was characterized as Leishmania (V.) braziliensis. The aim of this study is to contribute to the sand fly ecology of Central-West Brazil. Captures were carried out monthly using CDC light traps. Twenty-six species of sand fly were characterized; among which Lutzomyia (Lutzomyia) spathotrichia, L. runoides and L. (Psychodopygus) llanosmartinsi were recorded in the State of Mato Grosso for the first time. L. (Nyssomyia) whitmani, L. (N.) antunesi, L. (L.) spathotrichia, L. (P.) c. carrerai, L. (P.) complexa, L. (P.) lainsoni and L. (N.) umbratilis constituted 92.4% of the local fauna, among which L. (N.) whitmani and L.

12033821,"Linalool from Lippia alba: study of the reproducibility of the essential oil profile and the enantiomeric purity.A new chemotype of the aromatic Verbenaceae species Lippia alba Mill. N. E. <e>Br</e>. from southeastern Brazil has recently been shown to have a high content of linalool in the leaf essential oil. Vegetative propagation of this chemotype was conducted at six different locations in Brazil, and the variation of the content and the optical purity of linalool in the oils were verified. Yields (0.6-0.9%, hydrodistillation), chemical composition, linalool content, and optical purity of the oils from all the plants were compared, using GC-FID, GC-MS, chiral chromatography, and retention index calculation. No plant exceeded the matrix in linalool content (46.5 to 90.7%), and the chemical profile of the oils was the same for all the samples. Purification of linalool to a content close to 100% was effected by vacuum distillation of the crude oil. Chiral analysis showed exclusively the presence of S-linalool in all the crude oils and in the distilled samples.",M1
11526639,"Progression of acral bone resorption in multibacillary leprosy.Although leprosy became a curable disease after implementation of the Global Strategy for the Elimination of Leprosy (WHO), mutilations and deformities are still commonplace in endemic countries. Hence, it remains important to evaluate the prevalence rate and the risk factors of acral bone resorption in the multidrug therapy (MDT) era. A cohort of 105 newly-diagnosed adult multibacillary leprosy patients admitted for treatment between 1990-1992 was surveyed until 1999. Progression of bone resorption (<e>BR</e>) in cured leprosy patients was observed up to 8 years after release from MDT. Twenty three percent of the patients were found to have acral resorption. BR was found to be associated with male sex, grade of disability at diagnosis with other deformities and with the occurrence of four or more lepra reactions. Patient surveillance after release from MDT continues to be a necessary procedure in individuals with disabilities and recurrent or persistent reactions.",M1
10890356,"HIV disease progression and V3 serotypes in Brazil: is B different from B-<e>Br</e>?HIV-1 serotype B-Br (GWGR) is rare in the United States but predominates in Brazil. Differences in prognosis for patients infected with serotype B-Br or serotype B (GPGR) have not been addressed previously. In this prospective cohort study, we compared the rate of disease progression between patients infected with the HIV-1 V3 serotype B or B-Br in Brazil. Progression to AIDS or death was studied by the Kaplan-Meier and Cox proportional hazard methods. Among 445 HIV-infected patients who were tested with a specific enzyme immune assay, 204 (46%) had serotype B-Br infection and 127 (28%) had serotype B infection. Both groups were similar with regard to baseline CD4+ cell count, serum HIV RNA viral load, initial clinical stage, and the proportions who were treated with antiretroviral drugs. Patients with serotype B infection were significantly younger (p = 0.005) and tended to report homosexual behavior more frequently (p = 0.08). Mean follow-up was 30 +/- 13.5 months. During the study period, 41 (32%) patients infected with serotype B and 44 (22%) infected with serotype B-Br developed AIDS (p = 0.03). In a regression model adjusted for age and risk factor for HIV infection, progression to AIDS was faster in patients infected with serotype B (hazard ratio [HR] 1.59; 95% CI, 1.03-2.43; p = 0.03). A similar trend was observed in a model that considered AIDS or death as the outcome (HR, 1.43; 95% CI, 0.95-2.0; p = 0.09). These results suggest that patients infected with closely related HIV-1 serotypes may differ in the rate of progression to AIDS and indicate that serotype should be taken into account in HIV vaccine studies in Brazil.",M1
10643912,"Characterization of Leishmania sp. strains isolated from autochthonous cases of human cutaneous leishmaniasis in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil.Four Leishmania sp. samples were isolated from autochthonous human cases of American cutaneous leishmaniasis (ACL) in Santa Catarina State, southern Brazil. These strains were characterized using indirect immunofluorescence with a panel of Leishmania-specific monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and by PCR amplification and hybridization assay of the mini-exon gene with group specific probes. The results obtained with the MAbs were in agreement with the genetic marker. Two isolates (MHOM/<e>BR</e>/89/JSC89-H1 and MHOM/BR/89/JSC89-H2) were identified as L.

9686193,"Human_leishmaniasis/cytokines.bahia.<e>br</e>.The cell-mediated immune response is critical in the resistance to and recovery from leishmaniasis. Cytokines are central elements in mounting an immune response and have received a great deal of attention in both human and experimental leishmaniasis. IFN-gamma is responsible for macrophage activation leading to leishmanicidal mechanisms. Understanding the balance of cytokines that lead to enhanced production of or synergize with IFN-gamma, and those cytokines that counterbalance its effects is fundamental for developing rational immunotherapeutic or immunoprophylactic approaches to leishmaniasis. Here we focus on the cytokine balance in human leishmaniasis, particularly IL-10 as an IFN-gamma opposing cytokine, and IL-12 as an IFN-gamma inducer. The effects of these cytokines were evaluated in terms of several parameters of the human immune response. IL-10 reduced lymphocyte proliferation, IFN-gamma production and cytotoxic activity of responsive human peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Neutralization of IL-10 led to partial restoration of lymphoproliferation, IFN-gamma production and cytotoxic activity in unresponsive visceral leishmaniasis patients. IL-12 also restored the responses of peripheral blood mononuclear cells from visceral leishmaniasis patients. The responses obtained with IL-12 are higher than those obtained with anti-IL-10, even when anti-IL-10 is combined with anti-IL-4.",M1

Sera were screened using two enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs): the ELISA-EM (ELISA HTLV-I/II, EMBRABIO, <e>BR</e>), which contains HTLV-I and HTLV-II lysates, and the ELISA-DB [ELISA HTLV-I/II, Diagnostic Biotechnology (DB), Singapore], which contains HTLV-I lysate, and HTLV-I and HTLV-II recombinant env proteins (MTA-1 and K55, respectively). Serum samples showing two positive and/or borderline results were confirmed by Western blot (WB 2.3, DB), which discriminates HTLV-I from HTLV-II. WB analyses disclosed 22 cases (4.0%) of HTLV-I and 34 (6.1%) of HTLV-II seroreactivity; 24 sera had indeterminate antibody profile (4.3%) and 2 specimens showed reactivity to both MTA-1 and K55 env proteins. Using stringent WB criteria and analyzing the population according to risk factors, the prevalence rates of HTLV-I and HTLV-II infections were 11.2% and 16.8% in i.v. drug users, 3.4% and 5.5% in heterosexual individuals, and 1.4% and 2.2% in homosexual/bisexual men, respectively. A comparison of ELISA and WB results disclosed that both ELISAs were highly sensitive in detecting HTLV-I antibodies, whereas the ELISA-DB showed 82% sensitivity and the ELISA-EM 100% sensitivity in detecting HTLV-II antibodies. PCR analyses conducted on 37 representative cells samples confirmed the presence of HTLV proviral DNA in the majority of concordant serological cases, except in one, which was HTLV-I infected and seroreacted with K55 protein of HTLV-II. Indeed, after PCR, one case of HTLV-I infection and HTLV-II coinfection, and 30% of WB-seroindeterminate or inconclusive cases infected with HTLV-II could be detected. Our data stress high prevalences of both HTLV-I and HTLV-II infections in HIV-1 coinfected i.v. drug users from São Paulo, and suggests that ELISA kits containing only K55 protein as the HTLV-II-specific antigen, may not have the appropriate sensitivity for the detection of HTLV-II infection in this geographic region, pointing out the need of improved screening tests to be used in Brazil.",M1
9495371,"Presence of allele alphaLELY in an Amazonian Indian population.Allele alphaLELY is a low-expression allele of the erythroid spectrin alpha-chain that is characterized by a C --&gt; G mutation at position alpha1857 in exon 40 and a C --&gt; T (nt -12) mutation in intron 45. This second mutation is probably responsible for the partial skipping of exon 46. This exon is essential for the nucleation of the alpha-chains by the beta-chains during erythropoeisis. Although allele alphaLELY remains asymptomatic in both heterozygotes and homozygotes, it enhances the expression of deleterious alpha-alleles that occur and, as such, has clinical importance. In this study, the frequency of allele alphaLELY was estimated in two ethnically different Brazilian populations: a random sample of blood donors from Campinas, a city located in São Paulo State, in the southeastern region of Brazil, and a sample of Parakanã Indians (Tupi tribe), a very isolated population with a high degree of inbreeding. The frequency of allele alphaLELY in the blood donor's sample (n = 54) was 24.1% whereas in the indigenous sample (n = 41), it was 15.9%. These frequencies were not significantly different at the 5% level (chi2 = 1.931). Similarly, when the frequencies of our samples were compared with those of the four ethnic groups studied by Maréchal et al. [<e>Br</e> J Haematol 90:553-556, 1995], no significant differences were found at the 5% level (chi2 = 6.686). These results suggest that allele alphaLELY is a very ancient allele since it occurs with a relatively uniform and high frequency in all human ethnic groups studied so far. These findings confirm the importance of allele alphaLELY in influencing the expression of deleterious alpha-spectrin alleles. To our knowledge, these are the first data concerning allele alphaLELY in native Americans.",M1

Several populations with different socio-economic living conditions and inhabiting in different regions of Brazil were studied in order to estimate and to detect the variability of the mineral and toxic element content among Brazilian populational groups. The data obtained showed a significant difference between the contents of these elements in the diets from the regions studied. The general conclusions from the data obtained in this study were: 1) regarding the daily amounts of essential elements (Ca, Cl, Co, Fe, Mn, Na, K, Fe, Se and Zn), the Santa Catarina 2 diet showed the closest values when compared to the recommended values of RDA (Recommended Dietary Allowance) and/or WHO (World Health Organization). The Santa Catarina 1(low income groups) showed the lowest when compared to the same values. 2) The intake of toxic elements (As, Br, Cd, Hg, Sb) among the diets does not seem to be a major problem when compared to PTWI (Provisional Tolerable Weekly Intake, WHO), except for Hg intakes in regions near gold mining activities, like Manaus and Mato Grosso, where the values found were near the upper limit set by WHO.",M1

In 0.3, 8.6 and 8.0% of the horses, dogs and capybaras, respectively, infection was detected using standard parasitological methods. A seroprevalence of 4.1, 2.3, 7.1 and 22.0% was found in horses, cattle, dogs and capybaras, respectively, using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay for the detection of T.evansi antigen (Ag-ELISA), whereas 9.6, 4.2, 18.6 and 14.0% of the animals investigated were reactive in a T.evansi antibody (Ab-) ELISA. Positive ELISA results ('high responders') were identified using computer-assisted mixture analysis (C.A.MAN). Agglutinating antibodies were detected by the T.evansi card agglutination test for trypanosomiasis (CATT/T.evansi) in 14.6%, 1.3%, 15.7% and 22.0% of the horses, cattle, dogs and capybaras, respectively. A moderate but significant (kappa test; p &lt; 0.05) agreement beyond chance level was observed between Ab-ELISA and CATT results but generally not between antibody and antigen detection tests. Therefore, in an attempt to maximize the information yield of the three serodiagnostic tests, their results were numerically scored (negative = 0, intermediate = 1, positive = 2) and added up to a total score (TS) which was considered indicative for infection when TS &gt; or = 4 (results of the Ag-ELISA received double weight). Estimates of seroprevalence according to TS were 13.2, 4.7, 30.0 and 24.0% for horses, cattle, dogs and capybaras, respectively. Identical isoenzyme profiles, known as zymodeme 58 (T.evansi MCAN/<e>BR</e>/86/H), were found in all T.evansi stocks isolated in the study area (six from dogs, one from a horse and one from a capybara). From the results of this study it can be inferred that Mal de Cadeiras is endemic in Pantanal de Poconé. Although clinical and parasitological findings support the possible role of the capybara as a reservoir host of T.evansi, dogs and cattle--due to their close contact with horses--should rather be regarded as efficient reservoir hosts for Mal de Cadeiras in the study area.",M1

The reduction of PbO(2) by bromide can be expressed as PbO(2)(s) + 2Br(-) + 4H(+) --&gt; Pb(2+) + <e>Br</e>(2) + 2H(2)O. The reaction kinetics was found to be proportional to the concentration of PbO(2)(s), and the reaction orders were 1.08 and 1.77 with respect to bromide and proton concentration, respectively. The observed kinetic data can be explained by the following reaction mechanism: adsorption of bromide on the PbO(2)(s) surface to form a precursor surface complex identical with Pb(IV)Br, and two separate one-electron transfers from adsorbed Br(-) to structural Pb(IV), followed by the release of Pb(2+) and Br(2) into water. The adsorption of bromide ion on the PbO(2) surface and the first one-electron transfer reaction were found to be important in regulating the overall rate of the reaction. It is expected that a similar reaction scheme can be applied to other reductive ions.",M2
20408537,"Oxidation and stabilization of elemental mercury from coal-fired flue gas by sulfur monobromide.Sulfur monobromide (S(2)<e>Br</e>(2)) was employed as a task-specific oxidant to capture and stabilize elemental mercury from coal-fired flue gas. Its performances on the removal of Hg(0) were investigated with respect to the gas-phase reaction and particle-involved reactions. It was found that the gas-phase reaction between Hg(0) and S(2)Br(2) was rapid, and the determined second-rate constant was about 1.2(+/-0.2) x 10(-17)cm(3) molecules(-1) s(-1) at 373 K, which was about 30 times higher than that with sulfur monochloride. The pilot tests showed that the presence of fly ash in flue gas can accelerate the removal of Hg(0) significantly. It was predicted that about 90% of Hg(0) removal efficiency can be obtained with 0.6 ppmv S(2)Br(2) and 30 g/m(3) fly ash in flue gas, and the unburned carbon in fly ash played an important role for Hg(0) removal. The fates of S(2)Br(2) and mercury in the process were evaluated, and the product analysis and leaching tests indicated that mercuric sulfide was the main product of the converted Hg(0) by the direct reaction and consequent series reactions, which is more stable and less toxic than other mercury species. Also, the surplus S(2)Br(2) in flue gas could be captured and neutralized effectively by the alkali components in fly ash or FGD liquor, and its hydrolysis products (elemental sulfur and sulfide) were also helpful to the stabilization of mercury. The result indicated that S(2)Br(2) is a promising oxidant for elemental mercury (Hg(0)) oxidation and stabilization for mercury emission control.",M2
20408436,"[Halogenizing stress and its biomarkers]Discussed in this review are endogenous mechanisms of formation of reactive halogen-containing compounds (AH) in human body. Primary AH (HOCl and HOBr) are produced through oxidation of Cl- and <e>Br</e>- respectively by hydrogen peroxide catalyzed by myeloperoxidase or oesinophilic peroxidase. Interaction of HOCl and HOBr with functional groups of biologically important molecules give rise to secondary AH. A non-specific reaction of the organism to AH when their synthesis exceeds neutralization or elimination is referred to as halogenizing stress. Reactions of primary and secondary AH with biologically significant molecules (amino acids, proteins, lipids, nucleotides, carbohydrates, vitamins, etc.) are considered and relation of halogenizing stress to oxidative, carbonyl and nitrifying stresses is discussed. Special attention is given to methods for regulation and alleviation of halogenizing stress, detection of its biomarkers, role of AH in the development of certain socially significant diseases (cardiovascular, neurodegenerative, oncological, respiratory, etc.).",M2
20384288,"Hydration properties of the bromide aqua ion: the interplay of first principle and classical molecular dynamics, and X-ray absorption spectroscopy.The hydration properties of the bromide aqua ion have been investigated using state of the art density functional theory (DFT) based molecular dynamics with dispersion-corrected atom-centered pseudopotentials for water and classical molecular dynamics simulations. The reliability of the theoretical results has been assessed by comparing the attained structural results with the extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) experimental data. The EXAFS technique is mainly sensitive to short distances around the bromine atom, and it is a direct probe of the local solvation structure. The comparison shows that the DFT simulation delivers a good description of the EXAFS experimental signal, while classical simulation performs poorly. The main reason behind this is the neglect of polarization effects in the classical ion-water interaction potentials. By taking advantage of the reliable information on the <e>Br</e>(-) local hydration structure it has been possible to highlight the contribution of hydrogen atoms to the EXAFS spectra of halide aqueous systems.",M2
20331299,"Electric conductivities of 1:1 electrolytes in high-temperature ethanol along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve. I. NaBr, KBr, and CsBr.The molar electric conductivities Lambda of NaBr, KBr, and CsBr were measured in liquid ethanol at temperatures from 60 to 220 degrees C along the liquid-vapor coexistence curve. The limiting molar electrolyte conductivities Lambda(o) and the molar association constants K(A) were determined by the analysis of the concentration dependence of Lambda. The friction coefficients zeta for the Na(+), K(+), Cs(+), and <e>Br</e>(-) ions were estimated from Lambda(o) by an assumption that the cationic transference number of KBr is independent of temperature and density. The density dependences of zeta thus obtained together with literature values at higher densities (lower temperatures) were examined. zeta increases with decreasing density at densities above 2.0rho(c), where rho(c)=0.276 g cm(-3) is the critical density. At lower densities, the density dependences of zeta depend on ion. The relative contribution of the nonviscous effect in zeta was estimated by Deltazeta/zeta, where Deltazeta was the difference between zeta and the Stokes friction coefficient. At densities above 2.7rho(c), Deltazeta/zeta slightly decreases with decreasing density except for the Cs(+) ion. At densities below 2.7rho(c), Deltazeta/zeta increases with decreasing density and the density dependence is larger for larger ion. The results at densities above 2.2rho(c) were well explained by the Hubbard-Onsager (HO) dielectric friction theory [J. Hubbard, J. Chem. Phys. 68, 1649 (1978)] based on the sphere-in-continuum model. Below 2.2rho(c), however, experimental Deltazeta/zeta tends to be larger than the prediction of the HO theory. The lower limit density of the validity range of the HO theory is slightly higher in ethanol than in methanol.",M2
20133642,"Structure and structural transition of chiral domains in oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) assembly investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy.OPV3-CHO molecules are employed to prepare assembly on highly oriented pyrolytic graphite, and the so-prepared assembly is investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy. In the assembly chiral domains are observed with various structures such as linear and windmill. The chiral structural formation, stability, transition, and possible unification are intensively studied. After thermal annealing, linear structure was the only structure. To achieve a unified assembly with a single structure, an efficient method is proposed by coadsorption of OPV3-CHO with selected molecules. For example, an assembly with side-by-side helix structure is formed by a simple coadsorption of OPV3-CHO with alkyl bromide (C(n)H(2n+1)<e>Br</e>, n = 15-18). The experiments by cocrystallization of OPV3-CHO/C(n)H(2n+1)X (X = Cl, Br, and I) show the important role of halogen bonding in formation of the uniform structure. The results are significant in understanding the intermolecular noncovalent interactions that dominate the surface structure and chirality.",M2
20095700,"Molecular dynamics simulations of nonpolarizable inorganic salt solution interfaces: NaCl, NaBr, and NaI in transferable intermolecular potential 4-point with charge dependent polarizability (TIP4P-QDP) water.We present molecular dynamics simulations of the liquid-vapor interface of 1M salt solutions of nonpolarizable NaCl, NaBr, and NaI in polarizable transferable intermolecular potential 4-point with charge dependent polarizability water [B. A. Bauer et al., J. Chem. Theory Comput. 5, 359 (2009)]; this water model accommodates increased solvent polarizability (relative to the condensed phase) in the interfacial and vapor regions. We employ fixed-charge ion models developed in conjunction with the TIP4P-QDP water model to reproduce ab initio ion-water binding energies and ion-water distances for isolated ion-water pairs. The transferability of these ion models to the condensed phase was validated with hydration free energies computed using thermodynamic integration (TI) and appropriate energy corrections. Density profiles of Cl(-), <e>Br</e>(-), and I(-) exhibit charge layering in the interfacial region; anions and cation interfacial probabilities show marked localization, with the anions penetrating further toward the vapor than the cations. Importantly, in none of the cases studied do anions favor the outermost regions of the interface; there is always an aqueous region between the anions and vapor phase. Observed interfacial charge layering is independent of the strength of anion-cation interactions as manifest in anion-cation contact ion pair peaks and solvent separated ion pair peaks; by artificially modulating the strength of anion-cation interactions (independent of their interactions with solvent), we find little dependence on charge layering particularly for the larger iodide anion. The present results reiterate the widely held view of the importance of solvent and ion polarizability in mediating specific anion surface segregation effects. Moreover, due to the higher parametrized polarizability of the TIP4P-QDP condensed phase {1.31 A(3) for TIP4P-QDP versus 1.1 A(3) (TIP4P-FQ) and 0.87 A(3) (POL3) [Ponder and Case, Adv. Protein Chem. 66, 27 (2003)]} based on ab initio calculations of the condensed-phase polarizability reduction in liquid water, the present simulations highlight the role of water polarizability in inducing water molecular dipole moments parallel to the interface normal (and within the interfacial region) so as to favorably oppose the macrodipole generated by the separation of anion and cation charge. Since the TIP4P-QDP water polarizability approaches that of the experimental vapor phase value for water, the present results suggest a fundamental role of solvent polarizability in accommodating the large spatial dipole generated by the separation of ion charges. The present results draw further attention to the question of what exact value of condensed phase water polarizability to incorporate in classical polarizable water force fields.",M2
20085261,"Solid-state (79/81)<e>Br</e> NMR and gauge-including projector-augmented wave study of structure, symmetry, and hydration state in alkaline earth metal bromides.Bromine-79/81 solid-state NMR (SSNMR) spectroscopy is established as a tool to characterize the local structure and symmetry about bromide ions in inorganic systems. Benchmark experimental (79/81)Br SSNMR data are acquired for CaBr(2), SrBr(2), BaBr(2), MgBr(2).6H(2)O, SrBr(2).6H(2)O, BaBr(2).2H(2)O, and CaBr(2).xH(2)O using the Solomon echo and/or QCPMG pulse sequences in magnetic fields of 11.75 and 21.1 T. Analytical line-shape analysis provides (79/81)Br electric field gradient (EFG) tensor parameters (including (79)Br quadrupolar coupling constants, C(Q)((79)Br), of up to 75.1(5) MHz in CaBr(2)), chemical shift tensor parameters (including the largest reported anisotropy), and the relative orientation of the tensor principal axis systems. These data are interpreted in terms of structure and symmetry. Our results indicate that ionic bromide systems should be generally accessible to characterization by (79/81)Br SSNMR despite sizable quadrupolar interactions. The resolving capabilities of (79/81)Br SSNMR spectroscopy are illustrated, using samples which possess up to four magnetically inequivalent sites, and through a rare example of (79)Br magic-angle spinning NMR for a Br in a noncubic lattice. Bromine-79/81 SSNMR spectroscopy is demonstrated to be sensitive to the presence of hydrates (i.e., pseudopolymorphism), via drastic changes in C(Q) and delta(iso). The changes are diagnostic to an extent that the composition of the mixture CaBr(2).xH(2)O is determined for the first time. This technique should therefore be applicable to characterize other unknown mixtures or polymorphs. Important instances where (79)Br nuclear quadrupole resonance data were found to be deficient are noted and corrected. GIPAW DFT computations are shown to be generally in very good agreement with the experimental (79/81)Br SSNMR observations. Finally, it is demonstrated that the origin of the EFG at the Br nuclei cannot be described quantitatively using a point charge model, even after including Sternheimer antishielding effects.",M2
20078170,"Quasichemical and structural analysis of polarizable anion hydration.Quasichemical theory is utilized to analyze the relative roles of solute polarization and size in determining the structure and thermodynamics of bulk anion hydration for the Hofmeister series Cl(-), <e>Br</e>(-), and I(-). Excellent agreement with experiment is obtained for whole salt hydration free energies using the polarizable AMOEBA force field. The total hydration free energies display a stronger dependence on ion size than on polarizability. The quasichemical approach exactly partitions the solvation free energy into inner-shell, outer-shell packing, and outer-shell long-ranged contributions by means of a hard-sphere condition. The inner-shell contribution becomes slightly more favorable with increasing ion polarizability, indicating electrostriction of the nearby waters. Small conditioning radii, even well inside the first maximum of the ion-water(oxygen) radial distribution function, result in Gaussian behavior for the long-ranged contribution that dominates the ion hydration free energy. This in turn allows for a mean-field treatment of the long-ranged contribution, leading to a natural division into first-order electrostatic, induction, and van der Waals terms. The induction piece exhibits the strongest ion polarizability dependence, while the larger-magnitude first-order electrostatic piece yields an opposing but weaker polarizability dependence. The van der Waals piece is small and positive, and it displays a small ion specificity. The sum of the inner-shell, packing, and long-ranged van der Waals contributions exhibits little variation along the anion series for the chosen conditioning radii, targeting electrostatic effects (influenced by ion size) as the largest determinant of specificity. In addition, a structural analysis is performed to examine the solvation anisotropy around the anions. As opposed to the hydration free energies, the solvation anisotropy depends more on ion polarizability than on ion size: increased polarizability leads to increased anisotropy. The water dipole moments near the ion are similar in magnitude to bulk water, while the ion dipole moments are found to be significantly larger than those observed in quantum mechanical studies. Possible impacts of the observed over-polarization of the ions on simulated anion surface segregation are discussed.",M2
20028060,"Bromine chloride as an oxidant to improve elemental mercury removal from coal-fired flue gas.The equilibria and kinetics of the reaction between bromine (<e>Br</e>(2)) and chlorine (Cl(2)) to form bromine chloride (BrCl) at various temperatures were determined. BrCl was employed to oxidize elemental mercury (Hg(0)) under simulated flue gas conditions. The removal of Hg(0) from the gas phase by a homogeneous gas-phase oxidation reaction and the heterogeneous reactions involving flyash were investigated. The second-order gas phase rate constant was determined to be 2.3(+/-0.2) x 10(-17) cm(3).molecules(-1).s(-1) at 373K. The reaction of Hg(0)/BrCl was significantly accelerated in the presence of flyash, and the estimated Hg(0) removal efficiency in the presence of 0.6 ppmv BrCl and 20 g/m(3) flyash was up to 90%. Unexpectedly, the major product was found to be HgCl(2), rather than HgBr(2), indicating that bromine in part acted as the accelerant in Hg(0) oxidation in BrCl/Br(2)/Cl(2) system by facilitating the formation of intermediates. As a result, bromine consumption is much less than if only bromine gas is utilized alone. These results were helpful not only for understanding the mechanism of Hg(0) removal in coal-fired flue gas but also in any atmosphere in which bromine and chlorine species coexist.",M2

19939405,"Effect of Hofmeister anions on micellization and micellar growth of the surfactant cetylpyridinium chloride.Controlling the morphological characteristics of micellar solutions is important for surfactant performance and for achieving desired properties. In this work we study how monovalent anions of the lyotropic series affect micellization, micellar transitions, and micellar growth of the cationic surfactant N-cetyl pyridinium chloride (CPyCl), with the aim of achieving a tool to methodically tune these self-assembly characteristics. For the first time, a set of ions of the Hofmeister series were studied by combining indirect (surface tension, conductivity, optical absorption, viscosity, dynamic light scattering) and direct-imaging cryogenic-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM). Following recent literature on anionic surfactants, we considered the pyridinium headgroup as a chaotropic cation, interacting with cosmotrope and chaotrope anions (Cl(-), <e>Br</e>(-), NO(3)(-), ClO(3)(-)). We show that the micelles' structure is strongly influenced by both the nature and concentration of added anions and their location in the lyotropic series, but the lyotropic number by itself cannot explain all the effects measured. Especially interesting was the relatively small effect of the chlorate ion on the CMC, but its large effect on micellar transition and growth. We further test the influence of a hydrotrope on the first and second CMC and micellar growth, and compare it with the data obtained with the inorganic salts.",M2

Complex 1a was further transformed by treatment with Cu(OTf)(2) into [Cu(8)(mu-X)(6)(OTf)(2)(mu-dpmppm)(2)] (2) in which two TfO anions attached to both end of the Cu(8) ladder. When complexes 1 were dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (dmso) in the presence of 2 equiv. of dpmppm, the octacopper(I) ladder was unzipped to result in the linear tetranuclear copper(I) complex, [Cu(4)X(mu-X)(3)(mu-dpmppm)(2)(dmso)] (X = Cl (3a), Br (3b), I (3c)). Similar treatment of dpmppm with 2 equiv. of CuX in the presence of coordinative solvents, N,N'-dimethylformamide (dmf) and pyridine (py), yielded the symmetrical tetracopper(I) complexes, [Cu(4)(mu-Cl)(3)(mu-dpmppm)(2)(dmf)(2)][CuCl(2)] (4) and [Cu(4)(mu-I)(3)(mu-dpmppm)(2)(py)(2)]I (5).

19853419,"Complex methyl groups dynamics in [(CH3)4P]3Sb2Br9 (PBA) from low to high temperatures by proton spin-lattice relaxation and narrowing of proton NMR spectrum.Molecular dynamics of a polycrystalline sample of [(CH(3))(4)P](3)Sb(2)<e>Br</e>(9) (PBA) has been studied on the basis of the T(1) (24.7 MHz) relaxation time measurement, the proton second moment of NMR and the earlier published T(1) (90 MHz) relaxation times. The study was performed in a wide range of temperatures (30-337 K). The tunnel splitting omega(T) of the methyl groups was estimated as of low frequency (from kHz to few MHz). The proton spin pairs of the methyl group are known to perform a complex internal motion being a resultant of four components. Three of them involve mass transportation over and through the potential barrier and are characterized by the correlation times tau(3) and tau(T)of the jumps over the barrier and tunnel jumps in the threefold potential of the methyl group and tau(iso) the correlation time of isotropic rotation of the whole TMP cation. For tau(3) and tau(iso) the Arrhenius temperature dependence was assumed, while for tau(T)--the Schrödinger one. The fourth motion causes fluctuations of the tunnel splitting frequency, omega(T), and it is related to the lifetime of the methyl spin at the energy level. The correlation function for this fourth motion (tau(omega) correlation time) has been proposed by Müller-Warmuth et al. In this paper a formula for the correlation function and spectral density of the complex motion made of the above-mentioned four components was derived and used in interpretation of the T(1) relaxation time. The second moment of proton NMR line at temperatures below 50K is four times lower than its value for the rigid structure. The three components of the internal motion characterized by tau(T), tau(H), and tau(iso) were proved to reduce the second moment of the NMR line. The tunnel jumps of the methyl group reduce M(2) at almost 0K, the classical jumps over the barrier reduce M(2) in the vicinity of 50K, while the isotropic motion near 150K. Results of the study on the dynamics of CH(3) groups of TMP cation based on the second moment measurements were correlated with those based on T(1) time measurements.",M2
19809145,"Estimation of lateral water flow and bromide transport in a subsurface seepage irrigation system.Subsurface seepage irrigation is a common method used by growers in the Tri-County Agricultural Area (TCAA), Florida, USA, owing to its cost-effectiveness and low maintenance requirements. This study investigated the lateral flow of the perched water and the lateral transport of bromide (<e>Br</e>-) in this irrigation system in the TCAA and estimated the potential discharge of Br- into the drainage canals at the edges of the field, using the Visual MODFLOW/ MT3DMS models in conjunction with field experiments. Simulations showed that the perched water flowed from the northeast to the southwest of the field. Migration of the Br- plume from the source areas toward the canals was very slow and varied depending on the selection of the outer Br- concentration contour levels. However, the lateral transport of Br- from the perched water into the canals occurred after about 61 days. The simulations further revealed that the rate of perched water Br- discharge into the canals averaged 8.6 g day(-1) during a 30-day discharge period (from 61 to 91 days). This rate is very important for estimating Br- discharge into the canals and could also provide useful information for evaluating dissolved nutrient discharge into canals from the subsurface seepage irrigation system.",M2

Dairy shed effluent (DSE) spiked with Br was applied to the lysimeters, which contained fine sandy loam layers. This application was followed by fortnightly spray or flood water irrigation. Soil water contents were measured at four soil depths over 171 days, and leachate was collected from the bottom. The post-DSE period simulations yielded a generally decreased saturated water content compared to the pre-DSE period, and an increased saturated hydraulic conductivity and air-entry index, suggesting that changes in soil hydraulic properties (e.g. via changes in structure) can be induced by irrigation and seasonal effects. The single-porosity flow model was successful in simulating water flow under natural climatic conditions and spray irrigation. However, for lysimeters under flood irrigation, when the effect of preferential flow paths becomes more significant, the good agreement between predicted and observed water contents could only be achieved by using a dual-porosity flow model. Results derived from a mobile-immobile transport model suggest that compared to Br, bacteria were transported through a narrower pore-network with less mass exchange between mobile and immobile water zones. Our study suggests that soils with higher topsoil clay content and soils under flood irrigation are at a high risk of bacteria leaching through preferential flow paths. Irrigation management strategies must minimize the effect of preferential flow to reduce bacterial leaching from land applications of effluent.",M2

Mechanisms of toxicity of 1-BP are not fully understood, but it may be a neurological and reproductive toxicant. Sparse exposure information prompted this study using 1-BP air sampling and urinary metabolites. Mercapturic acid conjugates are excreted in urine from 1-BP metabolism involving debromination. Research objectives were to evaluate the utility of urinary N-acetyl-S-(n-propyl)-L-cysteine (AcPrCys) for assessing exposure to 1-BP and compare it to urinary bromide [<e>Br</e>((-))] previously reported for these workers. Forty-eight-hour urine specimens were obtained from 30 workers at two factories where 1-BP spray adhesives were used to construct polyurethane foam seat cushions. Urine specimens were also obtained from 21 unexposed control subjects. All the workers' urine was collected into composite samples representing three time intervals: at work, after work but before bedtime, and upon awakening. Time-weighted average (TWA) geometric mean breathing zone concentrations were 92.4 and 10.5 p.p.m. for spraying and non-spraying jobs, respectively. Urinary AcPrCys showed the same trend as TWA exposures to 1-BP: higher levels were observed for sprayers. Associations of AcPrCys concentrations, adjusted for creatinine, with 1-BP TWA exposure were statistically significant for both sprayers (P &lt; 0.05) and non-sprayers (P &lt; 0.01). Spearman correlation coefficients for AcPrCys and Br((-)) analyses determined from the same urine specimens were highly correlated (P &lt; 0.0001). This study confirms that urinary AcPrCys is an important 1-BP metabolite and an effective biomarker for highly exposed foam cushion workers.",M2
19691326,"Mechanism of the selective sulfide oxidation promoted by HNO(3)/FeBr(3).The oxidation of aryl methyl sulfides containing electron withdrawing and electron donating groups (p-NO(2), p-CHO, p-NCS, p-<e>Br</e>, H, p-CH(3), p-OCH(3)) was carried out in homogeneous solution in acetonitrile in the presence of catalytic amounts of HNO(3) and FeBr(3). The FeBr(3) is required for the reaction to proceed for compounds with strongly electron withdrawing groups (p-NO(2) and p-CHO) but is not necessary in the case of all the other compounds, although in the latter cases the yield decreases considerably. The rate of the reaction was measured as a function of substrate, FeBr(3) and HNO(3) concentration. From the experimental data a mechanism is suggested where there are two reaction pathways, one involving the formation of a ternary complex between the substrate, FeBr(3) and NO(3)(-) and one involving a complex formed between the sulfide and the HNO(3). From these complexes HNO(2) is generated, which then combines with HNO(3) to yield N(2)O(4), initiating a catalytic cycle where the sulfide is oxidized and O(2) from the air is stoichiometrically consumed.",M2

In the solid-state structures of these compounds, interesting supramolecular assemblies are observed. In 1, an unusual staircase-like architecture of the tape of edge-shared planar water hexamer is of importance, where the chloride ions are at the two edges of the tape. In 2, the polymeric nature of the water-bromide assembly is of interest, where discrete open-cube water octamers are doubly bridged by bromide ions. Semiempirical and DFT calculations confirm that the nature of the anion indeed affects the topology of the water-halide assemblies.

19390149,"Structure of a fatty-acid-binding protein from Bacillus subtilis determined by sulfur-SAD phasing using in-house chromium radiation.Sulfur single-wavelength anomalous dispersion (S-SAD) and halide-soaking methods are increasingly being used for ab initio phasing. With the introduction of in-house Cr X-ray sources, these methods benefit from the enhanced anomalous scattering of S and halide atoms, respectively. Here, these methods were combined to determine the crystal structure of BsDegV, a DegV protein-family member from Bacillus subtilis. The protein was cocrystallized with bromide and low-redundancy data were collected to 2.5 A resolution using Cr Kalpha radiation. 17 heavy-atom sites (ten sulfurs and seven bromides) were located using standard methods. The anomalous scattering of some of the BsDegV S atoms and <e>Br</e> atoms was weak, thus neither sulfurs nor bromides could be used alone for structure determination using the collected data. When all 17 heavy-atom sites were used for SAD phasing, an easily interpretable electron-density map was obtained after density modification. The model of BsDegV was built automatically and a palmitate was found tightly bound in the active site. Sequence alignment and comparisons with other known DegV structures provided further insight into the specificity of fatty-acid selection and recognition within this protein family.",M2

By (1)H and (13)C NMR analysis, all the crude complexes consisted of a pair of stereoisomers. Sterically more demanding ligand L4 induced a higher ratio (80:20) than L1-3 (about 56:44). Stereochemically pure complexes could be obtained by recrystallization in CH(2)Cl(2). X-ray crystallographic analysis of single crystals from purified complexes showed a single-stranded helical structure with a bridging ligand wrapped around two distorted octahedral rhenium metals, both of which possessed one bromide ligand and three carbonyl ligands in a fac coordination. The helical core is established by extensive noncovalent electrostatic interactions and chiral information is transmitted from the ligand to the helix through these interactions. Solution behavior was studied by CD spectroscopy, and the strong Cotton effect confirms the integrity of the helical structure in solution. The diastereoselectivity of helicates is proposed to be induced by steric interaction between the bromine atom and the substituent of the bridging ligand.",M2
19345975,"Effect of bromide on the formation of disinfection by-products during wastewater chlorination.The effect of bromide ion on the formation and speciation of trihalomethanes (THMs) and haloacetic acids (HAAs) during the chlorination of biologically treated wastewaters was investigated. The experimental results showed that the formation of total THMs and total HAAs during chlorine disinfection increased with increasing bromide levels in wastewater. The formation of CHBr(3) increased nearly linearly with increasing bromide ion levels, while CHCl(2)<e>Br</e> and CHClBr(2) increased with increasing bromide concentration from 0 to 3.2 mg L(-1) and thereafter remained constant or slightly decreased. Increasing initial bromide levels up to 12.8mgL(-1) resulted in sharp decrease of the concentration of CHCl(3) and chloro- HAAs. The mixed bromochloro- HAAs and bromo-only species replaced chloro- HAAs as the dominated species of HAA with increasing bromide levels. The distribution of monohalogenated, dihalogenated and trihalogenated species of HAAs in chlorinated wastewater at high concentration of bromide (&gt;2 mg L(-1)) is different from that of drinking/natural water. The values of the bromine incorporation factors, n (Br) and n' (Br), increased with increasing bromide concentration and remained constant or slightly decreased with increasing contact time under the studied range of bromide ion concentrations during chlorination. Moreover, the bromine incorporation into THMs was higher than that of HAAs with bromide levels ranging from 1.0 to 12.8 mg L(-1), indicating the dissimilar formation mechanisms of THMs and HAAs involving bromide.",M2

19238983,"Transformation of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol during water chlorination: effects of bromide on kinetics, products, and transformation pathways.Kinetics, products, and pathways of 17alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE2) transformation during chlorination of water with and without bromide (<e>Br</e>(-)) were studied to evaluate the effect of chlorination on the fate of steroid estrogens. Br(-) can be important for the fate of EE2 during chlorination because of a rapid conversion of Br(-) to bromine by chlorine and a approximately 1000 times higher reactivity of bromine than chlorine toward EE2. Experimental data and model calculations for EE2 chlorination show that 4-chloro EE2 and 2,4-dichloro EE2 are the major initial transformation products in absence of Br(-). With increasing concentration of Br(-), the bromo-analogous of the chloro EE2s becomes significant as additional initial transformation products. Those initial transformation products of EE2 are generally quickly further transformed to products with a destroyed phenolic moiety. Transformation of EE2 during chlorination becomes considerably faster at Br(-) concentrations higher than 0.25 microM (20 microg L(-1)). However, in presence of model dissolved organic matter such as glycine or phenol, the accelerating effect of Br(-) diminishes due to a more rapid consumption of bromine than chlorine by these compounds. A kinetic model was developed which allows to predict EE2 transformation during chlorination of natural waters and wastewaters in presence of Br(-) and low concentrations of ammonia (&lt;10 microM). It could be demonstrated in these systems that bromine produced from Br(-) is mainly responsible for EE2 transformation.",M2

The cause of this is the residual dipolar coupling between carbon atoms and quadrupolar halogen nuclides (chlorine-35/37, bromine-79/81 or iodine-127), an effect inversely proportional to the magnetic field strength which declines in importance markedly at 21.1 T as compared to lower fields. In favorable cases, the fine structure observed can be used for spectral assignment, e.g. for Cl-substituted aromatics where the substituted carbon as well as the ortho-carbons show distinct doublets.

The data for the ion-protein systems were treated according to the Klotz equation, and the number of binding sites and the binding constants were determined. It is shown that the binding sites of F(-) on OVA molecule are more than those of Br(-) and I(-), and that the binding sites of F(-), Br(-) and I(-) on OVA molecule decreases with increasing temperature. At the same time, our studies indicate that the binding constants for the interactions of F(-), Br(-) and I(-) with OVA show a same trend: They decrease as temperature increases. These were reasonably interpreted with the structural and thermodynamic factors. The thermodynamic functions (DeltaG(), DeltaH(), DeltaS()) at different temperatures were calculated with thermodynamic equations, and the enthalpy change for the interactions were also determined by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) at 298.15 K, which indicate that the interactions of F(-), Br(-) and I(-) with OVA are mainly electrostatic interaction.

18930418,"Measurement of sample temperatures under magic-angle spinning from the chemical shift and spin-lattice relaxation rate of 79Br in KBr powder.Accurate determination of sample temperatures in solid state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) with magic-angle spinning (MAS) can be problematic, particularly because frictional heating and heating by radio-frequency irradiation can make the internal sample temperature significantly different from the temperature outside the MAS rotor. This paper demonstrates the use of (79)<e>Br</e> chemical shifts and spin-lattice relaxation rates in KBr powder as temperature-dependent parameters for the determination of internal sample temperatures. Advantages of this method include high signal-to-noise, proximity of the (79)Br NMR frequency to that of (13)C, applicability from 20 K to 320 K or higher, and simultaneity with adjustment of the MAS axis direction. We show that spin-lattice relaxation in KBr is driven by a quadrupolar mechanism.

The larger T(m) of DODAC (49 degrees C) relative to DODAB (45 degrees C) has been attributed to the differing affinity and binding specificity of the counterions to the vesicle interfaces. In this communication it is reported differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), conductimetry and dynamic light scattering (DLS) data for mixtures of DODAB and DODAC in water at 1.0mM total surfactant concentration and varying surfactant concentration, to investigate the effect of counterion on the pre-, main- and post-transition temperatures (T(s), T(m) and T(p)), and the data compared to the neat surfactants in water. Accordingly, T(m) increases sigmoidally from 45.8 to 48.9 degrees C when DODAC molar fraction (x(DODAC)) is varied from 0 to 1. Neat DODAB exhibits in addition to T(m), T(s) and T(p) that are inhibited by DODAC. The main peak width DeltaT(1/2) does not depend on the surfactant molar fraction but the melting enthalpy change DeltaH is smaller for DODAB-rich dispersions due to the stronger affinity of Br(-). The conductivity and the apparent hydrodynamic diameter as well do not vary much with x(DODAB), indicating that the surface charge density is similar for DODAB and DODAC, evidencing the role of the counterion binding specificity and affinity on the properties of DODAX vesicles.",M2
18767772,"Perturbation of second and farther hydration shells of alkali cations and bromide in concentrated aqueous protein as a water-shortage medium.The Gibbs free energies of transfer of selected ions from water to concentrated aqueous ovalbumin and albumin (DeltaW(W') G degrees j) have been determined by ion-transfer voltammetry. Negative values for the tetrabutylammonium ion suggest its direct binding to ovalbumin. In contrast, for alkali cations and bromide, the DeltaW(W') G degrees j values are positive and increase with increasing ovalbumin concentration. Positive values are confirmed for concentrated aqueous albumin and poly(styrenesulfonate) as well. The largest value (ca. 10 kJ mol(-1)) is found for the transfer of K(+) from water to 30 wt % ovalbumin. To reveal the solvation structure of these ions in ovalbumin solutions, X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) measurements have been performed at the K, Rb, and <e>Br</e> K-edges. Interestingly, the spectra obtained in 30 wt % ovalbumin solutions are identical to those for the corresponding hydrated ions. This strongly suggests that the first coordination shell structures of these ions are not affected by a large concentration of ovalbumin. The detected positive free energy of transfer is slightly lower than the hydrogen bonding energy of a water molecule and should thus come from the perturbation of the second and farther hydration shells of the ions under a water-shortage condition caused by a high concentration of ovalbumin.",M2

The homogeneous reaction of CHF3 with CH4 was also studied to assist in understanding the chemistries involved. Compared to the gas phase reaction, the addition of CaBr2 as a reactant increases the conversion of CHF3 and CH4 significantly at low temperatures while to a lesser extent at higher temperatures. In the absence of CaBr2, besides the target product, CH2=CF2, a large amount of C2F4 forms. On addition of CaBr2, the rate of formation of C2F4 drops dramatically to near zero, while the rate of formation of CH2=CF2 increases considerably at temperatures below 880 degrees C. Experimental and theoretical studies suggest that CHF3 strongly interacts with CaBr2, resulting in the fluorination of CaBr2 to CaF2, the release of active <e>Br</e> species results in the selective formation of CBrF3.

Influence of pH and the presence of Cl(-) and <e>Br</e>(-) on trihalomethane formation potential.Upon chlorination carbohydrates can give trihalomethanes (THMs). In the present work, we have studied the influence of pH, chloride or bromide concentration on the formation of THMs from carbohydrates. We have observed that THMs are not formed at acidic pH, while basic pH values only increase slightly the THM content, although the consumption of chlorine increases up to 100% with respect to pH 8. The presence of chloride in ppm increases the THM formation from carbohydrates without influence of the chlorine consumption. In the same manner, the presence of bromide ions in ppb also increases remarkably the THMs formed upon chlorination of saccharides. Even more, we have observed that at bromide concentrations below 100ppb, complete incorporation of bromide in THMs occurs. Overall, the results obtained show that saccharides widely present in natural waters can give rise to significant THM concentrations in the disinfection process by chlorine.",M2

Identification of the sources of groundwater contamination in urbanized areas is problematic, but will become important in areas of rapid population growth and development. The isotopic composition of NO3 (delta15N(NO3) and delta18O NO3), NH4 (delta15N(NH4)), groundwater (delta2H(wt) and delta18O(wt)) and chloride/bromide ratios were used to determine the source of nitrate contamination in drinking water wells in a housing development that was built on the site of a dairy farm in the North Carolina Piedmont, U.S. The delta15N(NO3) and delta18O NO3 compositions imply that elevated nitrate levels at this site in drinking well water are the result of waste contamination, and that denitrification has not significantly attenuated the groundwater nitrate concentrations. delta15N(NO3) and delta18O(NO3) compositions in groundwater could not differentiate between septic effluent and animal waste contamination. Chloride/ bromide ratios in the most contaminated drinking water wells were similar to ratios found in animal waste application fields, and were higher than Cl/<e>Br</e> ratios observed in septic drain fields in the area. delta18O(wt) was depleted near the site of a buried waste lagoon without an accompanying shift in delta2H(wt) suggesting water oxygen exchange with CO2. This water-CO2 exchange resulted from the reduction of buried lagoon organic matter, and oxidation of the released gases in aerobic soils. delta18O(wt) is not depleted in the contaminated drinking water wells, indicating that the buried dairy lagoon is not a source of waste contamination. The isotope and Cl/Br ratios indicate that nitrate contamination in these drinking wells are not from septic systems, but are the result of animal waste leached from pastures into groundwater during 35 years of dairy operations which did not violate any existing regulations. Statutes need to be enacted to protect the health of the homeowners that require well water to be tested prior to the sale of homes built on urbanized farmland.",M2
18653264,"Rapid immobilisation and leaching of wet-deposited nitrate in upland organic soils.Nitrate (NO3-) is often observed in surface waters draining terrestrial ecosystems that remain strongly nitrogen (N) limited. It has been suggested that this occurs due to hydrological bypassing of soil or vegetation N retention, particularly during high flows. To test this hypothesis, artificial rain events were applied to 12 replicate soil blocks on a Welsh podzolic acid grassland hillslope, labelled with 15N-enriched NO3- and a conservative bromide (<e>Br</e>-) tracer. On average, 31% of tracer-labelled water was recovered within 4 h, mostly as mineral horizon lateral flow, indicating rapid vertical water transfer through the organic horizon via preferential flowpaths. However, on average only 6% of 15N-labelled NO3- was recovered. Around 80% of added NO3- was thus rapidly immobilised, probably by microbial communities present on the surfaces of preferential flowpaths. Transitory exceedance of microbial N-uptake capacity during periods of high water and N flux may therefore provide a mechanism for NO3- leaching.",M2
18597456,"Low-frequency mode activity of heme: femtosecond coherence spectroscopy of iron porphine halides and nitrophorin.The low-frequency mode activity of metalloporphyrins has been studied for iron porphine-halides (Fe(P)(X), X = Cl, <e>Br</e>) and nitrophorin 4 (NP4) using femtosecond coherence spectroscopy (FCS) in combination with polarized resonance Raman spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT). It is confirmed that the mode symmetry selection rules for FCS are the same as for Raman scattering and that both Franck-Condon and Jahn-Teller mode activities are observed for Fe(P)(X) under Soret resonance conditions. The DFT-calculated low-frequency (20-400 cm (-1)) modes, and their frequency shifts upon halide substitution, are in good agreement with experimental Raman and coherence data, so that mode assignments can be made. The doming mode is located at approximately 80 cm (-1) for Fe(P)(Cl) and at approximately 60 cm (-1) for Fe(P)(Br). NP4 is also studied with coherence techniques, and the NO-bound species of ferric and ferrous NP4 display a mode at approximately 30-40 cm (-1) that is associated with transient heme doming motion following NO photolysis. The coherence spectra of three ferric derivatives of NP4 with different degrees of heme ruffling distortion are also investigated. We find a mode at approximately 60 cm (-1) whose relative intensity in the coherence spectra depends quadratically on the magnitude of the ruffling distortion. To quantitatively account for this correlation, a new  distortion-induced  Raman enhancement mechanism is presented. This mechanism is unique to low-frequency  soft modes  of the molecular framework that can be distorted by environmental forces. These results demonstrate the potential of FCS as a sensitive probe of dynamic and functionally important nonplanar heme vibrational excitations that are induced by the protein environmental forces or by the chemical reactions in the aqueous phase.",M2
18597422,"Kinetics and mechanisms of the oxidation of iodide and bromide in aqueous solutions by a trans-dioxoruthenium(VI) complex.The kinetics and mechanisms of the oxidation of I (-) and <e>Br</e> (-) by trans-[Ru (VI)(N 2O 2)(O) 2] (2+) have been investigated in aqueous solutions. The reactions have the following stoichiometry: trans-[Ru (VI)(N 2O 2)(O) 2] (2+) + 3X (-) + 2H (+) --&gt; trans-[Ru (IV)(N 2O 2)(O)(OH 2)] (2+) + X 3 (-) (X = Br, I). In the oxidation of I (-) the I 3 (-)is produced in two distinct phases. The first phase produces 45% of I 3 (-) with the rate law d[I 3 (-)]/dt = ( k a + k b[H (+)])[Ru (VI)][I (-)]. The remaining I 3 (-) is produced in the second phase which is much slower, and it follows first-order kinetics but the rate constant is independent of [I (-)], [H (+)], and ionic strength. In the proposed mechanism the first phase involves formation of a charge-transfer complex between Ru (VI) and I (-), which then undergoes a parallel acid-catalyzed oxygen atom transfer to produce [Ru (IV)(N 2O 2)(O)(OHI)] (2+), and a one electron transfer to give [Ru (V)(N 2O 2)(O)(OH)] (2+) and I (*). [Ru (V)(N 2O 2)(O)(OH)] (2+) is a stronger oxidant than [Ru (VI)(N 2O 2)(O) 2] (2+) and will rapidly oxidize another I (-) to I (*). In the second phase the [Ru (IV)(N 2O 2)(O)(OHI)] (2+) undergoes rate-limiting aquation to produce HOI which reacts rapidly with I (-) to produce I 2. In the oxidation of Br (-) the rate law is -d[Ru (VI)]/d t = {( k a2 + k b2[H (+)]) + ( k a3 + k b3[H (+)]) [Br (-)]}[Ru (VI)][Br (-)]. At 298.0 K and I = 0.1 M, k a2 = (2.03 +/- 0.03) x 10 (-2) M (-1) s (-1), k b2 = (1.50 +/- 0.07) x 10 (-1) M (-2) s (-1), k a3 = (7.22 +/- 2.19) x 10 (-1) M (-2) s (-1) and k b3 = (4.85 +/- 0.04) x 10 (2) M (-3) s (-1). The proposed mechanism involves initial oxygen atom transfer from trans-[Ru (VI)(N 2O 2)(O) 2] (2+) to Br (-) to give trans-[Ru (IV)(N 2O 2)(O)(OBr)] (+), which then undergoes parallel aquation and oxidation of Br (-), and both reactions are acid-catalyzed.",M2
18584877,"DNA interaction studies and evaluation of biological activity of homo- and hetero-trihalide mononuclear Cu(II) Schiff base complexes. Quantitative structure-activity relationships.A new series of mixed-ligand mono- or hetero-trihalide Cu(II) complexes of the type [Cu(dienXX)Y(YZ(2))], where dienXX=Schiff dibase of diethylenetriamine with 2-thiophene-carboxaldehyde (dienSS), 2-furaldehyde (dienOO) or 2-pyrrole-2-carboxaldehyde (dienNN), Y=Cl, <e>Br</e> and Z=Br, I was synthesized by the reaction of the precursors of the type [Cu(dienXX)Y]Y with iodine or bromine in 1:1 molar ratio. The distorted square pyramidal configuration of the new homo- and hetero-trihalide Cu(II) mononuclear complexes was identified by C, H, N, Cu analysis, spectroscopic methods (IR, UV-visible), molar conductivity and magnetic measurements. The basal plane consists of three nitrogen atoms of the Schiff base and one halogen (terminal) atom while another axially located trihalogen moiety occupies the fifth side of the square pyramid as a YZ(2) entity, adopting an almost linear configuration. The equilibrium geometry of these complexes was further corroborated by theoretical studies at the B3LYP/DGDZVP level. A series of quantum chemical descriptors (e.g. SOMO (singly occupied molecular orbital) LUMO (lowest occupied molecular orbital), SOMO and LUMO energies, SOMO-LUMO gap, dipole moment, polarizability, molar volume, etc.) have been utilized in order to deduce quantitative structure-activity relationships (QSARs). The effect of the new compounds on the single stranded (ss), double stranded (ds) and pDNA led either to the formation of a DNA-complex cationic adduct, or to its degradation, evidenced by DNA electrophoretic mobility and DNA interaction spectroscopic titration studies. Moreover, the antimicrobial activity of Cu(II) complexes against Gram(+) and Gram(-) bacteria can be attributed to the synergistic action of the dissociation species, namely the cationic [Cu(dienXX)Y](+) and anionic [YZ(2)](-) ones. Finally, de Novo linear regression analysis correlating the bioactivity of these complexes with their structural substituents has been carried out, leading to some interesting qualitative observations/conclusions.",M2
18574968,"Bromate ion formation in dark chlorination and ultraviolet/chlorination processes for bromide-containing water.Bormate (BrO3(-)) is a carcinogenic chemical produced in ozonation or chlorination of bromide-containing water. Although its formation in seawater with or without sunlight has been previously investigated, the formation of bromate in dilute solutions, particularly raw water for water treatment plant, is unknown. In this article, the results of bench scale tests to measure the formation rates of bromate formation in dilute solutions, including de-ionized water and raw water from Yangtze River, were presented in dark chlorination and ultraviolet (UV)/chlorination processes. And the effects of initial pH, initial concentration of NaOCl, and UV light intensity on bromate formation in UV/chlorination of the diluted solutions were investigated. Detectable bromate was formed in dark chlorination of the two water samples with a relatively slow production rate. Under routine disinfecting conditions, the amount of formed bromate is not likely to exceed the national standards (10 microg/L). UV irradiation enhanced the decay of free chlorine, and, simultaneously, 6.6%--32% of <e>Br</e> was oxidized to BrO3(-). And the formation of bromate exhibited three stages: rapid stage, slow stage and plateau. Under the experimental conditions (pH = 4.41--11.07, Ccl2 = 1.23--4.50 mg/L), low pH and high chlorine concentration favored the generation of bromate. High light intensity promoted the production rate of bromate, but decreased its total generation amount due to acceleration of chlorine decomposition.",M2
18516076,"Analysis of the mechanism by which melatonin inhibits human eosinophil peroxidase.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO) catalyses the formation of oxidants implicated in the pathogenesis of various respiratory diseases including allergy and asthma. Mechanisms for inhibiting EPO, once released, are poorly understood. The aim of this work is to determine the mechanisms by which melatonin, a hormone produced in the brain by the pineal gland, inhibits the catalytic activity of EPO. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We utilized H2O2-selective electrode and direct rapid kinetic measurements to determine the pathways by which melatonin inhibits human EPO. KEY RESULTS: In the presence of plasma levels of bromide (<e>Br</e>-), melatonin inactivates EPO at two different points in the classic peroxidase cycle. First, it binds to EPO and forms an inactive complex, melatonin-EPO-Br, which restricts access of H2O2 to the catalytic site of the oxidation enzyme. Second, melatonin competes with Br- and switches the reaction from a two electron (2e-) to a one electron (1e-) pathway allowing the enzyme to function with catalase-like activity. Melatonin is a bulky molecule and binds to the entrance of the EPO haem pocket (regulatory sites). Furthermore, Br- seems to enhance the affinity of this binding. In the absence of Br-, melatonin accelerated formation of EPO Compound II and its decay by serving as a 1e- substrate for EPO Compounds I and II. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The interplay between EPO and melatonin may have a broader implication in the function of several biological systems. This dual regulation by melatonin is unique and represents a new mechanism for melatonin to control EPO and its downstream inflammatory pathways.",M2
18423990,"Investigation of the role of electrolytes and non-electrolytes on the cloud point and dye solubilization in antidepressant drug imipramine hydrochloride solutions.Antidepressant drug imipramine hydrochloride (IMP) is amphiphilic which shows surfactant-like behavior in aqueous solutions. We have studied the effect of adding electrolytes and non-electrolytes on the micellar behavior of IMP by making cloud point (CP) and dye solubilization measurements. The CP of a 100mM IMP solution (prepared in 10mM sodium phosphate (SP) buffer) was found to decrease with increasing pH, both in the absence as well as presence of added salts. Increase in pH increased the visible absorbance of Sudan III dye solubilized in the drug micelles, implying micellar growth. Addition of increasing amounts of salts to 100mM IMP solutions (at pH 6.7) caused continuous increase in CP due to micellar growth. On the basis of these studies, the binding-effect orders of counter- and co-ions have been deduced, respectively, as: <e>Br</e>(-)&gt;Cl(-)&gt;F(-) and Li(+)&lt;Na(+)&lt;K(+)&lt;NH(4)(+). The trend of increasing CP with addition of increasing amounts of quaternary salts (tetramethylammonium bromide, TMeAB; tetraethylammonium bromide, TEtAB; tetra-n-propylammonium bromide, TPrAB; tetra-n-butylammonium bromide, TBuAB; tetra-n-pentylammonium bromide, TPeAB) to 100mM IMP solutions (at pH 6.7) was found to be dependent upon the alkyl chain length of the particular salt. Ureas caused CP depression, which was found to be dependent upon the number of methyl groups present in the molecule. Contrary to this, thioureas increased the CP slightly, but the presence of methyl group(s) had effect similar to that of alkylureas. The visible absorbance due to solubilized dye increased/decreased with addition of electrolytes/ureas. The overall behavior has been discussed in terms of electrostatic interactions, micellar growth, and mixed micelle formation.",M2

18378800,"Chloride homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae: high affinity influx, V-ATPase-dependent sequestration, and identification of a candidate Cl- sensor.Chloride homeostasis in Saccharomyces cerevisiae has been characterized with the goal of identifying new Cl- transport and regulatory pathways. Steady-state cellular Cl- contents ( approximately 0.2 mEq/liter cell water) differ by less than threefold in yeast grown in media containing 0.003-5 mM Cl-. Therefore, yeast have a potent mechanism for maintaining constant cellular Cl- over a wide range of extracellular Cl-. The cell water:medium [Cl-] ratio is &gt;20 in media containing 0.01 mM Cl- and results in part from sequestration of Cl- in organelles, as shown by the effect of deleting genes involved in vacuolar acidification. Organellar sequestration cannot account entirely for the Cl- accumulation, however, because the cell water:medium [Cl-] ratio in low Cl- medium is approximately 10 at extracellular pH 4.0 even in vma1 yeast, which lack the vacuolar H(+)-ATPase. Cellular Cl- accumulation is ATP dependent in both wild type and vma1 strains. The initial (36)Cl- influx is a saturable function of extracellular [(36)Cl-] with K(1/2) of 0.02 mM at pH 4.0 and &gt;0.2 mM at pH 7, indicating the presence of a high affinity Cl- transporter in the plasma membrane. The transporter can exchange (36)Cl- for either Cl- or <e>Br</e>- far more rapidly than SO4=, phosphate, formate, HCO3-, or NO3-. High affinity Cl- influx is not affected by deletion of any of several genes for possible Cl- transporters. The high affinity Cl- transporter is activated over a period of approximately 45 min after shifting cells from high-Cl- to low-Cl- media. Deletion of ORF YHL008c (formate-nitrite transporter family) strongly reduces the rate of activation of the flux. Therefore, Yhl008cp may be part of a Cl(-)-sensing mechanism that activates the high affinity transporter in a low Cl- medium. This is the first example of a biological system that can regulate cellular Cl- at concentrations far below 1 mM.",M2
18371800,"Simultaneous determination of bromide and nitrate in contaminated waters by ion chromatography using amperometry and absorbance detectors.This study describes a new ion chromatography method using a low-capacity anion exchange column with amperometric and absorbance detection for rapid and simultaneous determination of <e>Br</e>(-) and NO(3)(-) in contaminated waters where one of these ions is present in excess compared to other. The use of two detectors overcomes the problem of baseline separation for Br(-) and NO(3)(-) for accurate quantification, which was commonly encountered when using a low-capacity anion exchange column and suppressed conductivity detection mode. The method achieved accurate quantification of these two ions without requirement of baseline separation. The accuracy of 2.8% for NO(3)(-) was determined using a quality control sample obtained from UN GEMS/Water PE Study No. 6. The detection limits for Br(-) and NO(3)(-) were 20 and 6 microg l(-1) (25 microl sample), respectively.

From our observed Raman intensities of those phonon modes studied here, we extract the values of the critical exponent for the order parameter in these crystalline systems. The exponent values indicate that the Raman intensities show a logarithmic divergence at higher pressures in NH(4)Cl, whereas they predict a lambda-type phase transition at zero pressure in NH(4)Br.",M2
18345871,"A fully relativistic method for calculation of nuclear magnetic shielding tensors with a restricted magnetically balanced basis in the framework of the matrix Dirac-Kohn-Sham equation.A new relativistic four-component density functional approach for calculations of NMR shielding tensors has been developed and implemented. It is founded on the matrix formulation of the Dirac-Kohn-Sham (DKS) method. Initially, unperturbed equations are solved with the use of a restricted kinetically balanced basis set for the small component. The second-order coupled perturbed DKS method is then based on the use of restricted magnetically balanced basis sets for the small component. Benchmark relativistic calculations have been carried out for the (1)H and heavy-atom nuclear shielding tensors of the HX series (X=F,Cl,<e>Br</e>,I), where spin-orbit effects are known to be very pronounced. The restricted magnetically balanced basis set allows us to avoid additional approximations and/or strong basis set dependence which arises in some related approaches. The method provides an attractive alternative to existing approximate two-component methods with transformed Hamiltonians for relativistic calculations of chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants of heavy-atom systems. In particular, no picture-change effects arise in property calculations.",M2
18332136,"Biosynthetic exchange of bromide for chloride and strontium for calcium in the photosystem II oxygen-evolving enzymes.The active site for water oxidation in photosystem II goes through five sequential oxidation states (S(0) to S(4)) before O(2) is evolved. It consists of a Mn(4)Ca cluster close to a redox-active tyrosine residue (Tyr(Z)). Cl(-) is also required for enzyme activity. To study the role of Ca(2+) and Cl(-) in PSII, these ions were biosynthetically substituted by Sr(2+) and <e>Br</e>(-), respectively, in the thermophilic cyanobacterium Thermosynechococcus elongatus. Irrespective of the combination of the non-native ions used (Ca/Br, Sr/Cl, Sr/Br), the enzyme could be isolated in a state that was fully intact but kinetically limited. The electron transfer steps affected by the exchanges were identified and then investigated by using time-resolved UV-visible absorption spectroscopy, time-resolved O(2) polarography, and thermoluminescence spectroscopy. The effect of the Ca(2+)/Sr(2+) and Cl(-)/Br(-) exchanges was additive, and the magnitude of the effect varied in the following order: Ca/Cl &lt; Ca/Br &lt; Sr/Cl &lt; Sr/Br. In all cases, the rate of O(2) release was similar to that of the S(3)Tyr(Z)(.) to S(0)Tyr(Z) transition, with the slowest kinetics (i.e. the Sr/Br enzyme) being approximately 6-7 slower than in the native Ca/Cl enzyme. This slowdown in the kinetics was reflected in a decrease in the free energy level of the S(3) state as manifest by thermoluminescence. These observations indicate that Cl(-) is involved in the water oxidation mechanism. The possibility that Cl(-) is close to the active site is discussed in terms of recent structural models.",M2

The results showed impalpable changes of the H2O-NaOCl-<e>Br</e>(-) system was observed in dark, whereas in UV/chlorination processes free chlorine was continuously reduced and a considerable ratio (6.6 - 32 percent) of bromide was oxidized to bromate. The chlorine decomposition followed pseudo-first order rate equation when the reaction conditions, including pH, temperature and UV light intensity, was nearly fixed. Within the light intensity range of 610 - 1 896 microW/cm2 and temperature range of 12.2 - 36.1 degrees C the pseudo-first order rate constants had a linear relationship with temperature and light intensity, respectively. Bromate formation could be divided totally into three stages: quick-form stage, slow-form stage and plateau stage. In slow-form stage the production of bromate had a good linear relationship with the amount of decayed chlorine, of which the regression coefficients were higher than 0.96 in most cases. Under the conditions in these experiments (pH 4.41 - 11.07, DO 1.5 - 9 mg/L, Cl2 1.23 - 4.50 mg/L), production of bromate was favored under the circumstance with low pH value, low DO value and high chlorine concentration. Both increasing temperature and increasing light intensity improved the creation of bromate, as well as reduced the duration of bromate forming process because of the acceleration of chlorine decomposition.",M2

From these formulas and by considering the suitable impurity-induced local lattice relaxation, the SH parameters of CsCdX(3):Ni(2+) (X=Cl, Br) crystals are calculated. The results are in reasonable agreement with the experimental values. The sign of Q(CT) (Q=Deltag( parallel), Deltag( perpendicular) or D, where the g-shift Deltag(i)=g(i)-g(e), g(e) approximately 2.0023 is the free-electron value) due to CT mechanism is the same as that of the corresponding Q(CF) due to CF mechanism. The relative importance of CT mechanism (characterized by Q(CT)/Q(CF)) increases with the increasing atomic number of ligand X. So, for 3d(n) ion clusters in crystals with heavy element ligand ion (e.g., Br(-)), the reasonable explanations of SH parameters should contain the contributions from both CF and CT mechanisms.",M2
18243537,"Effect of bromide ion on isolated fractions of dissolved organic matter in secondary effluent during chlorination.The role of bromide ion in the trihalomethane (THM) formation and structure of dissolved organic matter (DOM) during chlorination of the secondary effluent taken from the Wenchang Wastewater Treatment Plant (Harbin, China) was investigated. DOM was fractionated using XAD resins into five fractions: hydrophobic acid (HPO-A), hydrophobic neutral (HPO-N), transphilic acid (TPI-A), transphilic neutral (TPI-N) and hydrophilic fraction (HPI). The patterns of individual THM species with increased bromide concentrations were similar for all DOM fractions. The THM speciation as well as halogen fraction for these five fractions followed similar trends with the <e>Br</e>(-)/Cl(2) ratio. Chlorination resulted in decreased ultraviolet (UV) absorbance across wavelengths from 250 to 280 nm for DOM fractions whether bromide ions existed or not, and bromide addition led to lower differential UV absorbance values. Fourier-transform infrared (FT-IR) results indicated that chlorination, whether bromide ions existed or not, resulted in the near elimination of aromatic CH and amide peaks, increased CO absorption intensity and occurrence of CO and CCl peaks for HPO-A, HPO-N, TPI-A and TPI-N. Furthermore, bromide addition in chlorination led to the occurrence of CBr peak for all four fractions.",M2
18206899,"The ionic liquid 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide as novel extracting system for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons contained in sediments using focused microwave-assisted extraction.A method to extract PAHs from sediments is carried out using aqueous solutions containing aggregates of the ionic liquid (IL) 1-hexadecyl-3-methylimidazolium bromide (HDMIm-<e>Br</e>) as the extracting medium. Focused microwave-assisted extraction has been used to accelerate the extraction step, followed by HPLC with fluorescence detection without clean-up steps to remove the IL prior to injection. The method has been applied to certified reference sediment BCR-535 and marine sediments from Tenerife (Canary Islands) with successful results. The optimized method gave average absolute recoveries of 91.1% for six of the seven PAHs studied, with relative standard deviations lower than 10.4%. The overall method is characterized for presenting low extraction times (6min), low amounts of the sediment (0.1g), low amounts of IL (45mM), and low volumes of aqueous extractant solution (9mL). The use of small amounts of both IL and aqueous extractant solution allows the method to be considered environmental-friendly.",M2
18075069,"Watershed sources of disinfection byproduct precursors in the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers, California.High levels of dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and bromide (<e>Br</e>) in the Sacramento and San Joaquin River waterways are of concern because DOC and Br are organic and inorganic precursors, respectively, of carcinogenic and mutagenic disinfection byproducts (DBPs). The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers are the two major rivers supplying water to the San Francisco Bay Delta, but sources and loads of DBP precursors into the Delta are still uncertain. The major objectives of this study were to evaluate both the quantity (DOC and Br fluxes) and the quality (reactivity in forming DBPs) of DBP precursors from the Sacramento and San Joaquin watersheds. Water samples were collected every 2 weeks at up to 35 locations along the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers and selected tributaries and analyzed for DOC (4 years), Br (1 year), and ultraviolet absorbance at 254 nm (1 year). Selected water samples were also tested for THM formation potential. Estimated fluxes for the Sacramento River were 39 000 +/- 12 000 Mg DOC year(-1) and 59 Mg of Br year(-1) as compared to 9000 +/- 5000 Mg of DOC year(-1) and 1302 Mg of Br year(-1) for the San Joaquin River. The THM formation potential was higher in the San Joaquin River (441 +/- 49 microg L(-1)) than the Sacramento River (176 +/- 20 microg L(-1)) because of higher concentrations of both organic (DOC = 3.62 +/- 0.14 vs 1.92 +/- 0.09 mg L(-1)) and inorganic DBP (Br = 0.80 +/- 0.07 vs &lt; 0.03 +/- 0.01 mg L(-1)) precursors. The Sacramento River's greater DOC load despite lower DOC concentrations is due to its discharge being about 5 times greater than the San Joaquin River (50 x 10(9) vs 10 x 10(9) L day(-1)). The DOC concentration was significantly correlated with several land-cover types, including agriculture; however, no relationship was found between DOC quality and land-cover at the watershed scale.",M2
18064536,"Survey on fluoride, bromide and chloride contents in public drinking water supplies in Sicily (Italy).Six hundred and sixty-seven water samples were collected from public drinking water supplies in Sicily and analysed for electric conductivity and for their Cl(-), <e>Br</e>(-) and F(-) contents. The samples were, as far as possible, collected evenly over the entire territory with an average sampling density of about one sample for every 7,600 inhabitants. The contents of Cl(-) and Br(-), ranging between 5.53 and 1,302 mg/l and between &lt;0.025 and 4.76 mg/l respectively, correlated well with the electric conductivity, a parameter used as a proxy for water salinity. The highest values were found both along the NW and SE coasts, which we attributed to seawater contamination, and in the central part of Sicily, which we attributed to evaporitic rock dissolution. The fluoride concentrations ranged from 0.023 to 3.28 mg/l, while the highest values (only three exceeding the maximum admissible concentration of 1.5 mg/l) generally correlated either with the presence in the area of crystalline (volcanic or metamorphic) or evaporitic rocks or with contamination from hydrothermal activity. Apart from these limited cases of exceeding F(-) levels, the waters of public drinking water supplies in Sicily can be considered safe for human consumption for the analysed parameters. Some limited concern could arise from the intake of bromide-rich waters (about 3% exceeding 1 mg/l) because of the potential formation of dangerous disinfection by-products.",M2
18058964,"Facile synthesis of gold nanoparticles with narrow size distribution by using AuCl or AuBr as the precursor.Gold(I) halides, including AuCl and AuBr, were employed for the first time as precursors in the synthesis of Au nanoparticles. The synthesis was accomplished by dissolving Au(I) halides in chloroform in the presence of alkylamines, followed by decomposition at 60 degrees C. The relative low stability of the Au(I) halides and there derivatives eliminated the need for a reducing agent, which is usually required for Au(III)-based precursors to generate Au nanoparticles. Controlled growth of Au nanoparticles with a narrow size distribution was achieved when AuCl and oleylamine were used for the synthesis. FTIR and mass spectra revealed that a complex, [AuCl(oleylamine)], was formed through coordination between oleylamine and AuCl. Thermolysis of the complex in chloroform led to the formation of dioleylamine and Au nanoparticles. When oleylamine was replaced with octadecylamine, much larger nanoparticles were obtained due to the lower stability of [AuCl(octadecylamine)] complex relative to [AuCl(oleylamine)]. Au nanoparticles can also be prepared from AuBr through thermolysis of the [AuBr(oleylamine)] complex. Due to the oxidative etching effect caused by <e>Br</e>(-), the nanoparticles obtained from AuBr exhibited an aspect ratio of 1.28, in contrast to 1.0 for the particles made from AuCl. Compared to the existing methods for preparing Au nanoparticles through the reduction of Au(III) compounds, this new approach based on Au(I) halides offers great flexibility in terms of size control.",M2

Cluster structures, binding energies, and vibrational properties were predicted at the MP2 level with basis sets of aug-cc-pvtz and aug-cc-pvdz quality. Vibrational self consistent field (VSCF) calculations were employed to correct the predicted harmonic vibrational frequencies of the dimer complexes for anharmonicity. The major finding of this work is that the clusters all feature  solvated anion  structural motifs, with an anion bound to perturbed, yet intact, H2S ligands. The binding energies of the H2S ligands to the anion decrease with larger cluster size, and this is reflected in blue shifted vibrational stretching frequencies.",M2

This compound displayed a strong antiferromagnetic interaction between spins located on Ni III species (J=(2350+/-500) K) that result from the strong covalency of the Ni--<e>Br</e> bond and the spin-Peierls transition below 150 K. This was shown by the results of magnetic susceptibility and 81Br nuclear quadrupole resonance spectroscopy analysis. We succeeded in the electrostatic carrier doping of a single crystalline sample by using a field-effect transistor device. This compound also showed n-type semiconductor behavior, which can be reasonably rationalized by the existence of a small amount of Ni II impurities.",M2
17993146,"Bromide oxidation and formation of dihaloacetic acids in chloraminated water.A comprehensive reaction model was developed that incorporates the effect of bromide on monochloramine loss and formation of bromine and chlorine containing dihaloacetic acids (DHAAs) in the presence of natural organic matter (NOM). Reaction pathways accounted for the oxidation of bromide to active bromine (<e>Br</e>(l)) species, catalyzed monochloramine autodecomposition, NOM oxidation, and halogen incorporation into DHAAs. The reaction scheme incorporates a simplified reaction pathway describing the formation and termination of Br(l). In the absence of NOM, the model adequately predicted bromide catalyzed monochloramine autodecomposition. The Br(l) reaction rate coefficients are 4 orders of magnitude greater than HOCl for the same NOM sources under chloramination conditions. Surprisingly, the rate of NOM oxidation by Br(l) was faster than bromide catalyzed monochloramine autodecomposition by Br(l) so that the latter reactions could largely be ignored in the presence of NOM. Incorporation of bromine and chlorine into DHAAs was proportional to the amount of NOM oxidized by each halogen and modeled using simple bromine (alpha(Br)) and chlorine (alpha(Cl)) incorporation coefficients. Both coefficients were found to be independent of each other and alpha(Br) was one-half the value of alpha(Cl). This indicates that chlorine incorporates itself into DHAA precursors more effectivelythan bromine. Model predictions compared well with DHAA measurements in the presence of increasing bromide concentrations and is attributable to the increased rate of NOM oxidation, which is rate limited by the oxidation of bromide ion in chloraminated systems.",M2
17957309,"Multiphoton dissociation dynamics of BrCl and the BrCl+ cation.Ion imaging methods have enabled identification of three mechanisms by which (79)<e>Br</e>(+) and (35)Cl(+) fragment ions are formed following one-color multiphoton excitation of BrCl molecules in the wavelength range 324.6 &gt; lambda &gt; 311.7 nm. Two-photon excitation within this range populates selected vibrational levels (v'= 0-5) of the [X (2)Pi(1/2)]5ssigma Rydberg state. Absorption of a third photon results in branching between (i) photoionization (i.e. removal of the Rydberg electron-a traditional 2 + 1 REMPI process) and (ii)pi*&lt;--pi excitation within the core, resulting in formation of one or more super-excited states with Omega= 1 and configuration [A (2)Pi(1/2)]5ssigma. The fate of the latter states involves a further branching. They can autoionize (yielding BrCl(+)(X (2)Pi) ions in a wider range of v(+) states than formed by direct 2 + 1 REMPI). Further, one-photon absorption by the parent ions resulting from direct ionization or autoionization leads to formation of Br(+) and (energy permitting) Cl(+) fragment ions. Alternatively, the super-excited molecules can fragment to neutral atoms, one of which is in a Rydberg state. Complementary ab initio calculations lead to the conclusion that the observed [Cl**[(3)P(J)]4s + Br/Br*] products result from direct dissociation of the photo-prepared super-excited states, whereas [Br**[(3)P(J)]5p + Cl/Cl*] product formation involves interaction between the [A (2)Pi(1/2)]5ssigma and [X (2)Pi(1/2)]5psigma Rydberg potentials at extended Br-Cl bond lengths.

17868772,"Effects of pollutants on laccase activities of Marasmius quercophilus, a white-rot fungus isolated from a Mediterranean schlerophyllous litter.Marasmius quercophilus is a white-rot fungus involved in carbon recycling in Mediterranean ecosystems because of its laccase production. Here we described the effect of metal ions and halide salts, on laccase activity in order to point out the action of such environmental pollutants on this enzyme of major importance. Furthermore we tested organic solvent effects on laccase reaction since reaction mixture including solvent can be used in the transformation of xenobiotics. In the case of metal ions, we found that chloride ions were responsible for inhibition while CuSO(4) and MnSO(4) enhanced laccase activity. When halides were tested, we showed the following degree of inhibition: F(-)&gt;Cl(-)&gt;<e>Br</e>(-). Furthermore we found that I(-) was oxidized by laccase with I(2) as the product of the reaction. With ABTS, 50% of the laccase activity remains for solvent concentration ranging from 40% to 60% depending on the solvent used while with syringaldazine solvent concentration ranged from 50% to 70%. The organic solvent effects observed were probably a result of enzyme denaturation and of both enhancement of oxidised product solubilisation and of substrate solubilisation (for syringaldazine). These results show that laccase from M. quercophilus is not rapidly inhibited by certain environmental pollutants which sustains its role in carbon turnover under pertubation. However the strong effect of chloride ion on laccase activity should be further investigated with in situ studies since this could drastically influence carbon recycling in litters from Mediterranean littoral locations.",M2
17850959,"Bromide ion removal from contaminated water by calcined and uncalcined MgAl-CO3 layered double hydroxides.A fundamental investigation on the uptake of bromide ion from contaminated water by calcined and uncalcined MgAl-CO3 layered double hydroxides (LDHs) were conducted in batch mode. The uptake capacity of calcined LDHs (CLDH) is higher than that of uncalcined LDHs, due to their different mechanisms which are confirmed by powder X-ray diffraction, FT-IR spectroscopy and TG-MS measurements. The former mechanism is based on the reconstruction of CLDH to <e>Br</e>-LDHs, whilst the latter is related to the surface adsorption. It has been found that the LDHs calcined at 500 degrees C with Mg/Al molar ratio of 4 represents the highest capacity to remove bromide ion from aqueous solution. The equilibrium isotherms of uptake of bromide by CLDH were well fitted by the Langmuir equation, and thermodynamic parameters such as Delta G0, Delta H0 and Delta S0 were calculated from Langmuir constants. The negative value of Delta H0 confirms the exothermic nature of adsorption. Three kinetics models were used to fit the kinetics experimental data, and it was found that the pseudo-second order kinetics model could be used to describe the uptake process appropriately. The value of Ea was calculated to be 79.9 kJ/mol, which suggests that the process of uptake bromide is controlled by the reaction rate of bromide with the CLDH rather than diffusion.",M2
17825916,"Modeling the haloperoxidases: reversible oxygen atom transfer between bromide ion and an oxo-Mn(V) porphyrin.The manganese meso-dimethylimidazolium porphyrin complex Mn(III)[TDMImP] reacted with HOBr/OBr(-) to generate the corresponding oxo-Mn(V)[TDMImP] species. The rate of this process accelerated with increasing pH. A forward rate constant, k(for), of 1.65x10(6)M(-1)s(-1) was determined at pH 8. Under these conditions, the oxo-Mn(V) species is short-lived and is transformed into the corresponding oxo-Mn(IV) complex. A first-order rate constant, k(obs), of 0.66 s(-1) was found for this reduction process at pH 8. The mechanism of this reduction process, which was dependent on bromide ion, appeared to proceed via an intermediate Mn(III)-O-<e>Br</e> complex. Thus, both a fast, reversible Mn(III)-O-Br bond heterolysis and a slower homolytic pathway occur in parallel in this system. The reverse oxidation reaction between oxo-Mn(V)[TDMImP] and bromide was investigated as a function of pH. The rate of this oxo-transfer reaction (k(rev)=1.4x10(3)M(-1)s(-1) at pH 8) markedly accelerated as the pH was lowered. The observed first-order dependence of the rate on [H(+)] indicates that the reactive species responsible for bromide oxidation is a protonated oxo-hydroxo complex and the stable species present in solution at high pH is dioxo-Mn(V)[TDMImP], [O=Mn(V)=O](-). The oxo-Mn(V) species retains nearly all of the oxidative driving force of the hypohalite. The equilibrium constant K(equi)=k(for)/k(rev) for the reversible process was determined at three different pH values (K(equi)=1.15x10(3) at pH 8) allowing the measurement of the redox potentials E of oxo-Mn(V)/Mn(III) (E=1.01 V at pH 8). The redox potential for this couple was extrapolated over the entire pH scale using the Nernst relationship and compared to those of the manganese 2- and 4-meso-N-methylpyridinium porphyrin couples oxo-Mn(V)[2-TMPyP]/Mn(III)[2-TMPyP], oxo-Mn(V)[4-TMPyP]/Mn(III)[4-TMPyP], OBr(-)/Br(-) and H(2)O(2)/H(2)O.

17674733,"[Effects of bromide and ferric ions on formation of tri-halomethanes during disinfection of drinking water by chlorine]Effects of bromide and ferric ions on the formation and distribution of tri-halomethanes (THMs) have been investigated. As disinfection by-product (DBP) model precursors of natural water, humic acid solutions were used and a series of experiments were conducted. The results showed that bromide in this reaction system not only contributed to the increase of brominated species, but also the total tri-halomethanes. When the concentration of <e>Br</e>(-) was 1.0 mg/L, the total amount of produced THMs reached to 270% of that without bromide ions. In the presence of bromide, ferric ions decreased the production of THMs at pH 6, but increased the production of THMs at pH 8, especially for the amount of tri-bromomethanes. When the concentration of Fe3+ was 5 mg/L, the amount of produced tri-bromomethanes had an increment of 54% (from 51.7 microg/L to 79.4 microg/L), and the total amount of THMs increased from 113.49 microg/L to 162.09 microg/L. Bromide ions had a significant effect on carcinogenicity risk in disinfection of drinking water by chlorine, and the co-existence of ferric ion and bromide in alkalescent environment can result in the biggest challenge on carcinogenicity risk. Under the condition of 0.2 mg/L Br(-), 5 mg/L Fe3+ and pH 6, the carcinogenicity risk increased 2.5 times than that without Br(-) and Fe3+, and much higher increment of 5.1 times appeared when pH was 8.",M2
17658214,"Effects of coexisting anions on removal of bromide in drinking water by coagulation.Bromo-DBPs (disinfection by-products) are generated by bromide and disinfectant in drinking water disinfection, which have adverse effects on human health. In this study, effects of coexisting anions on removal of bromide by aluminium coagulation were investigated. It was observed that bromide was removed of 62.1-87.0% in raw water, while the removal efficiency of bromide was achieved 82.8-99.2% in deionized water through the combination of <e>Br</e>- with Al(III) in various pathways. The coexisting anions in raw water significantly affected the removal of bromide. Removal efficiency decreased by 11.5, 21.2, 14.6, 8.0 and 40.8% with the addition of HCO3-, SO4(2-), Cl-, NO3- and H2PO4-, respectively, for their affinities with Al(III) or accelerating the formation of Al(OH)3(am).

17604010,"Influence of chloride on modification of unsaturated phosphatidylcholines by the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/bromide system.The leukocyte enzyme myeloperoxidase (MPO) is capable of catalyzing the oxidation of chloride and bromide ions, at physiological concentrations of these substrates, by hydrogen peroxide, generating hypochlorous acid (HOCl) and hypobromous acid (HOBr), respectively. Our previous results showed that the hypohalous acids formed react with double bonds in phosphatidylcholines (PCs) to produce chloro- and bromohydrins. Lysophosphatidylcholine (lyso-PC) is additionally formed in PCs with two or more double bonds. This study was conducted to determine the effect physiological chloride concentration (140 mM) has on the formation of bromohydrins and lyso-PC from unsaturated PC upon treatment with the myeloperoxidase/hydrogen peroxide/bromide (MPO/H2O2/<e>Br</e>-) system using physiological bromide concentrations (20-100 microM). The composition of reaction products was analyzed by matrix-assisted laser desorption and ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS). With monounsaturated PC, we demonstrated that the rate and extent of mono-bromohydrin formation were higher in the samples with 140 mM chloride compared to those with no added chloride. Moreover, mono-bromohydrin came to be the major product and no mono-chlorohydrin was observed already at 60 microM bromide. We attributed these effects to the involvement of HOBr arising from the reaction of MPO-derived HOCl with bromide rather than to the exchange of bromide with chlorine atoms of chlorohydrins or direct formation of HOBr by MPO. The presence of chloride shifted the pH optimum for mono-bromohydrin formation (pH 5.0) toward neutral values, and a significant yield of mono-bromohydrin was detected at physiological pH values (7.0-7.4). For polyunsaturated PC, chloride enhanced also lyso-PC production, the effect being pronounced at bromide concentrations below 40 microM. The results indicate that at physiological levels of chloride and bromide, chloride promotes MPO-mediated formation of bromohydrins and lyso-PC in unsaturated phospholipids.",M2
17531165,"The characterization of the sol-gel encapsulated curcumin as a possible sensor for small biologically important molecules.Curcumin, a known phytochemical antioxidant was found to be useful as a potential sensor for some small biologically important molecules. Hydrogen peroxide, the sodium salt of nitrite (NO2-), hydroxide (OH-), bromide (<e>Br</e>-) and iodide (I-) were observed to quench the fluorescence of sol-gel encapsulated curcumin, which emits radiation at 530 nm when excited at 420 nm. The observed bimolecular quenching constant which is related to the Stern-Volmer quenching constant, KSV, for the species studied in this work was determined by a modified Stern-Volmer relation for molecular surface accessibility, was observed to be specific for each of these anions and correlates quite well with their half-wave potentials, E1/2. The extent of permeability of these molecules through the pores of the sol-gel matrix was determined and they, also, correlated with these molecules' charge densities and sizes. In all the species, the reaction was quite exergonic and the free energy change, DeltaGoET, obtained in each case, suggest an outer-sphere, long range electron transfer mechanism. These observations open up the possible use of curcumin as a sensor for probing and characterizing some relevant bio-molecules in biological systems.",M2
17489612,"Alkaline degradation of the organophosphorus pesticide fenitrothion as mediated by cationic C12, C14, C16, and C18 surfactants.The effect of varying surfactant chain length (C12, C14, C16, C18) on the alkaline hydrolysis of the organophosphorus pesticide fenitrothion was determined for the following series of inert counterion cationic surfactants: dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (DTABr), tetradecyltrimethylammonium bromide (TTABr), hexadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTABr), and octadecyltrimethylammonium bromide (OTABr). Plots of kobs versus [surfactant] at constant [KOH] showed saturation behavior at low total [<e>Br</e>-], and (constrained) S-shaped curvature was observed at high total [Br-]. kobs values increased with increasing surfactant chain length but decreased with added KBr. For systems exhibiting saturation behavior, further analysis of the results using the PPIE treatment as modified to account for HO-/Br- exchange allowed the evaluation of substrate binding constants, KS, and micellar rate constants, k2m. The binding constants increased with chain length (hydrophobicity), but ionic strength had no effect on KS. Meanwhile, because of the increased KS values as the surfactant chain length increased, the rate enhancements observed for fenitrothion degradation correspondingly increased. However, rate enhancements decreased with ionic strength because reactive counterions could not compete against the bromide anion for micellar binding sites. Low k2m/k2w ratios revealed that the observed rate enhancements were due to the so-called concentration effect rather than true catalysis. Finally, where the PPIE model failed (displaying S-shaped curvature), our results support the intervention of sphere-to-rod transitions that are favored at high ionic strength (&gt;0.01 M Br-) and lower temperatures as the cause of the S-shaped curvature.",M2

Six protonation constants were determined, and the protonation sequence was established by NMR. The location of the fifth proton on the phen nitrogen was confirmed by X-ray determinations of the crystal structures of the receptor as bromide and chloride salts. The two compounds have the general molecular formula {(H5[26]phen2N4O2)Xn(H2O)(5-n)}X(n-1) x mH2O, where X = Cl, n = 3, and m = 6 or X = <e>Br</e>, n = 4, and m = 5.5.

The corresponding Ka values for cis-N2CP 3-Cu and NCP 1-Cu were about 1/10 and 1/2, respectively, of those of 2-Cu. With the help of density functional theory (DFT) calculations and complementary affinity measurements of a series of trisubstituted N-confused porphyrins, the efficient anion binding of NCPs was attributed to strong hydrogen bonding at the highly polarized NH moieties owing to the electron-deficient C6F5 groups at meso positions as well as the ideally oriented dipole moments and large molecular polarizability. The orientation and magnitude of the dipole moments in NCPs were suggested to be important factors in the differentiation of the affinity for anions.",M2
17241724,"Halide salts accelerate degradation of high explosives by zerovalent iron.Zerovalent iron (Fe(0), ZVI) has drawn great interest as an inexpensive and effective material to promote the degradation of environmental contaminants. A focus of ZVI research is to increase degradation kinetics and overcome passivation for long-term remediation. Halide ions promote corrosion, which can increase and sustain ZVI reactivity. Adding chloride or bromide salts with Fe(0) (1% w/v) greatly enhanced TNT, RDX, and HMX degradation rates in aqueous solution. Adding Cl or <e>Br</e> salts after 24h also restored ZVI reactivity, resulting in complete degradation within 8h. These observations may be attributed to removal of the passivating oxide layer and pitting corrosion of the iron. While the relative increase in degradation rate by Cl(-) and Br(-) was similar, TNT degraded faster than RDX and HMX. HMX was most difficult to remove using ZVI alone but ZVI remained effective after five HMX reseeding cycles when Br(-) was present in solution.",M2
17228918,"Development of cation/anion  interaction  scales for ionic liquids through ESI-MS measurements.Electrospray ionization mass spectrometry applied to ionic liquids allowed the study of loosely bonded supramolecules, originating from these organic salts. Based on the observation that ionic liquids formed cationic [C(q+1)X(q)](+) and anionic [C(q)X(q+1)](-) supramolecular aggregates, we have investigated mixed networks, formed by different cations coordinated to a selected anion or by different anions bonded to a given cation, i.e., [C1...X...C2](+) and [X1...C...X2](-), with the aim to build a scale of the cation-anion interaction strength. The qualitative order of intrinsic bond strength to <e>Br</e>- was found to be the following: [emim](+) &gt; [bmim](+) &gt; [mor1,2](+) &gt; [hmim]+ &gt; [omim](+) &gt; [mor1,4](+) &gt; [bupy](+) &gt; [bpyrr](+) &gt; [picol](+) &gt; [bm(2)im](+) &gt; [TBA](+). Similarly, the interaction energies to 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium (bmim) species envisaged two classes of anions: species tightly coordinated to the cationic moiety that include CF3COO(-), Br(-), N(CN)2(-), and BF4(-) and anions loosely interacting with the alkylimidazolium species such as OTf(-), PF6(-), and Tf2N(-).",M2
17291121,"Controlled binding of a L-cysteinato cobalt(III) octahedron to a cadmium(II) center.The binding ability of a chiral L-cysteinato cobalt(III) complex, [Co(L-cys-N,S)(en)2]+ (l-H2cys = L-cysteine, en = ethylenediamine), toward a cadmium(II) center, together with the construction of S-bridged CoIIICdII structures that are controlled by anions and pH, is reported. The reaction of Lambda(L)-[Co(L-Hcys-N,S)(en)2](ClO4)2 having a pendent COOH group with CdCl2 in a 1:1 ratio in water, followed by the addition of NaCl, gave an S-bridged CoIIICdII dinuclear complex, Lambda(L)-[CdCl4{Co(L-Hcys-N,S)(en)2}] (1Cl), in which a cadmium(II) ion is weakly coordinated by a thiolato group from a Lambda(L)-[Co(L-Hcys-N,S)(en)2]2+ unit, besides four Cl- anions. The corresponding 1:1 reaction with CdBr2 and NaBr yielded an S-bridged CoIIICdIICoIII trinuclear complex composed of an S-bridged CoIIICdIICoIII trinuclear cation and a [CdBr4]2- anion, (Lambda(L))2-[CdBr3{Co(L-Hcys-N,S)(en)2}{Co(L-cys-N,S)(en)2} ][CdBr4] (2), while a CoIIICdII dinuclear complex analogous to 1Cl, Lambda(L)-[CdBr4{Co(L-Hcys-N,S)(en)2}] (1Br), was obtained by the addition of HBr instead of NaBr. In the CoIIICdIICoIII cation of 2, a CdII center is very weakly coordinated by two thiolato groups from Lambda(L)-[Co(L-Hcys-N,S)(en)2]2+ and Lambda(L)-[Co(L-cys-N,S)(en)2]+ units, besides three <e>Br</e>- anions, with the trinuclear structure being sustained by an intramolecular COOH...OOC hydrogen bond. On the other hand, no S-bridged structure was obtained by the corresponding 1:1 reaction with CdI2 and NaI, giving only a mononuclear CoIII species with a [CdI4]2- counteranion, Lambda(L)-[Co(L-Hcys-N,S)(en)2][CdI4] (3). When Lambda(L)-[Co(L-cys-N,S)(en)2]ClO4 having a deprotonated pendent COO- group was reacted with CdCl2 in a 1:1 ratio in water, followed by the addition of NaCl, a one-dimensional (CoIIICdII)n polymeric complex, (Lambda(L))n-[CdCl3{Co(L-cys-N,S)(en)2}]n (4Cl), in which Lambda(L)-[Co(L-cys-N,S)(en)2]+ units are alternately linked by [CdCl3]- moieties through thiolato and carboxylate groups, was constructed. An analogous (CoIIICdII)n polymeric structure having [Cd(NCS-N)3]- moieties, (Lambda(L))n-[Cd(NCS-N)3{Co(L-cys-N,S)(en)2}]n (4NCS), was also produced by the use of Cd(ClO4)2 and NaSCN.",M2

The optimized geometries, frequencies, and minimum energy path are all obtained at the MP2/6-31+G(d,p) level, and energetic information is further refined by the G3(MP2) (single-point) theory. The rate constants for every reaction channels, Br + CH(3)SCH(3) --&gt; CH(3)SCH(2) + HBr (R1), Br + CH(3)SCH(3) --&gt; CH(3)SBr + CH(3) (R2), and Br + CH(3)SCH(3) --&gt;CH(3)S + CH(3)Br (R3), are calculated by canonical variational transition state theory with small-curvature tunneling correction over the temperature range 200-3000 K. The total rate constants are in good agreement with the available experimental data, and the two-parameter expression k(T) = 2.68 x 10(-12) exp(-1235.24/T) cm(3)/(molecule s) over the temperature range 200-3000 K is given. Our calculations indicate that hydrogen abstraction channel is the major channel due to the smallest barrier height among three channels considered, and the other two channels to yield CH(3)SBr + CH(3) and CH(3)S + CH(3)Br are minor channels over the whole temperature range.",M2
17059227,"Bromide does not bind to the Mn4Ca complex in its S1 state in Cl(-)-depleted and <e>Br</e>(-)-reconstituted oxygen-evolving photosystem II: evidence from X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Br K-edge.Chloride is an important cofactor in photosynthetic water oxidation. It can be replaced by bromide with retention of the oxygen-evolving activity of photosystem II (PSII). Binding of bromide to the Mn(4)Ca complex of PSII in its dark-stable S(1) state was studied by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) at the Br K-edge in Cl(-)-depleted and Br(-)-substituted PSII membrane particles from spinach. The XAS spectra exclude the presence of metal ions in the first and second coordination spheres of Br(-). EXAFS analysis provided tentative evidence of at least one metal ion, which may be manganese or calcium, at a distance of approximately 5 A to Br(-). The native Cl(-) ion may bind at a similar distance. Accordingly, water oxidation may not require binding of a halide directly to the metal ions of the Mn complex in its S(1) state.",M2
17008085,"Metals, non-metals and PCB in electrical and electronic waste--actual levels in Switzerland.The chemical composition of waste of small electrical and electronic equipment (s-WEEE), a rapidly growing waste stream, was determined for selected metals (Cu, Sb, Hg etc.) and non-metals (Cl, <e>Br</e>, P) and PCBs. During a 3-day experiment, all output products and the s-WEEE input mass flows in a WEEE recycling plant were measured. Only output products were sampled and analyzed. Material balances were established, applying substance flow analysis (SFA). Transfer coefficients for the selected substances were also determined. The results demonstrate the capability of SFA to determine the composition of the highly heterogeneous WEEE for most substances with rather low uncertainty (2 sigma +/- 30%). The results confirm the growing importance of s-WEEE regarding secondary resource metals and potential toxic substances. Nowadays, the thirty times smaller s-WEEE turns over larger flows for many substances, compared to municipal solid waste. Transfer coefficient results serve to evaluate the separation efficiency of the recycling process and confirm--with the exception of PCB and Hg--the limitation of hand-sorting and mechanical processing to separate pollutants (Cd, Pb, etc.) out of reusable fractions. Regularly applied SFA would serve to assess the efficacy of legislative, organizational and technical measures on the WEEE.",M2
17209551,"The potential role of nitric oxide in substrate switching in eosinophil peroxidase.Eosinophil recruitment and enhanced nitric oxide (NO) production are characteristic features of asthma and other airway diseases. Eosinophil peroxidase (EPO), a highly cationic hemoprotein secreted by activation of eosinophils, is believed to play a central role in host defense against invading pathogens. The enzyme uses hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and bromide (<e>Br</e>-), a preferred cosubstrate of EPO, to generate the cytotoxic oxidant hypobromous acid. The aim of this work was to determine whether NO can compete with plasma levels of Br- and steer the enzyme reaction from a 2e- oxidation to a 1e- oxidation pathway. Rapid kinetic measurements were utilized to measure the rate of EPO compounds I and II formation, duration, and decay at 412 and 432 nm, respectively, at 10 degrees C. An EPO-Fe(III) solution supplemented with increasing Br- concentrations was rapidly mixed with fixed amounts of H2O2 in the absence and in the presence of increasing NO concentrations. In the absence of NO, EPO-Fe(III) primarily converted to compound I and, upon H2O2 exhaustion, it decayed rapidly to the ferric form. NO caused a significant increase in the accumulation of EPO compound II, along with a proportional increase in its rate of formation and duration as determined by the time elapsed during catalysis. The time courses for these events have been incorporated into a comprehensive kinetic model. Computer simulations carried out supported the involvement of a conformational intermediate in the EPO compound II complex decay. Collectively, our results demonstrated that NO displays the potential capacity to promote substrate switching by modulating substrate selectivity of EPO.",M2
17123249,"Assessment of the use of plasma and serum chloride concentrations as indirect predictors of serum bromide concentrations in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy.BACKGROUND: Bromide (<e>BR</e>) administration causes pseudohyperchloremia when plasma or serum chloride (Cl-) concentrations are determined with commonly available automated analytical assays. In humans receiving BR, it has been previously demonstrated that the plasma Cl- concentration is a useful indirect estimator of the measured BR concentration. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to determine if the magnitude of pseudohyperchloremia seen in epileptic dogs treated with BR could be used as a predictor of the measured serum BR concentration. METHODS: Plasma and serum Cl- concentrations, analyzed by ion-specific electrode (ISE) and colorimetric techniques, and serum BR concentrations, determined using the gold-trichloride assay, were simultaneously determined in 88 blood samples from dogs with idiopathic epilepsy that were treated with BR. RESULTS: For all methods used to quantify Cl- concentrations, there were significant (P &lt; .0001) linear relationships between BR and Cl- concentrations. Linear relationships between BR and Cl- concentrations were significantly different (P &lt; .0001) between blood samples from dogs obtained during routine therapeutic monitoring and those obtained during emergency hospital admissions. Calculated 95% prediction intervals for future values of BR using measured Cl- concentrations contained considerable error. Plasma Cl- values determined with ISE generally provided the best prediction of serum BR concentrations. Agreement between the measured BR and Cl- using all Cl- assay techniques was moderate, but was statistically significant only when Cl- was assayed in plasma using one ISE method. CONCLUSIONS: The pseudohyperchloremia observed in epileptic dogs receiving BR is an inadequate indirect estimator for the measured BR concentration, although in certain clinical situations identified through construction of a clinical decision tree, the measured Cl- value can be used to guide general therapeutic decisions regarding alterations in BR therapy. Optimal tailoring of BR therapy in dogs with idiopathic epilepsy should be based on results of therapeutic monitoring of BR concentrations.",M2
17361403,"Halogen bonding and the design of new materials: organic bromides, chlorides and perhaps even fluorides as donors.In some halides RX, the halogen X has a region of positive electrostatic potential on its outermost portion, centered around the extension of the R-X bond. The electrostatic attraction between this positive region and a lone pair of a Lewis base is termed halogen bonding. The existence and magnitudes of such positive potentials on some covalently bonded halogens, and the characteristic directionality of the interaction, can be explained in terms of the degree of sp hybridization and polarizability of X and the electronegativity of R. Halogen bonding increases in strength in the order Cl &lt; <e>Br</e> &lt; I; fluorine is frequently said to not form halogen bonds, although a notable result of the present study is computational evidence that it does have the capability of doing so, if R is sufficiently electron withdrawing. An increasingly important application of halogen bonding is in the design of new materials (e.g., crystal engineering). In this paper, we present the calculated energies of a series of halogen-bonding interactions that could be the basis for forming linear chains, of types X----X----X---- or X----Y----X----Y----. We focus upon chlorides and bromides, and nitrogen bases. The B3PW91/6-311G(3df,2p) and MP2/6-311++G(3df,2p) procedures were used. We show how the computed electrostatic potentials (B3PW91/6-31G**) can provide guidance in selecting appropriate halide/base pairs.",M2
17332263,"Depth distribution of sulfonamide antibiotics in pore water of an undisturbed loamy grassland soil.Despite the concern raised by the detections of veterinary antibiotics like sulfonamides (SA) in the environment, their fate in soils is still not sufficiently understood. In a previous article, we demonstrated that manure may substantially influence losses of SA via runoff from soils. Here, we report on the effect of manure on SA availability in soil pore water. Three sulfonamides (sulfadimidine, sulfadiazine, sulfathiazole) and two tracers (bromide and Brilliant Blue) were either applied in manure or as aqueous solution on grassland plots. After 1 and 3 d contact time, the plots were irrigated with deionized water. One day after irrigation, soil cores were taken and profiles of pore water concentrations were determined. The median SA concentrations of the top layer on manured plots varied between 40 and 60 microg L(-1) and between 10 and 30 microg L(-1) on the controls. For the conservative tracer <e>Br</e> the mass recovery was about 60 to 75% and much lower for the SA (2 to 14%). Apparent distribution coefficients K(d,app) of the SA in the topsoil ranged between 3 and 15 L kg(-1) on the manured plots and between 30 to 35 kg L(-1) on the controls. Below the top layer, the concentration distribution showed a pattern typical for preferential flow. Locally, SA concentrations down to 30- to 50-cm depth were as high as in the top 5 cm with little effect of the two application matrices. In the topmost layer, the data indicate that 10 to 25% of sulfadimidine were transformed to its acetyl-metabolite.",M2
