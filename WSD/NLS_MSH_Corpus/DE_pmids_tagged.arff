18522108,"Validation of reactive model assumptions with isotope data: application to the Dover case.This paper presents a new approach to compare simulations from reactive transport models. We show that where several compounds follow a reaction chain and can be degraded under different redox conditions, two models with significantly different parameters can lead to similar species distributions. The studied case is the aquifer contamination at Dover, <e>DE</e> U.S., where well characterized plumes of PCE, TCE, cDCE, and VC have been simulated both with RT3D and by a semianalytical procedure proposed here. In order to validate the models, we use isotope data of PCE and TCE that where also measured on that site. A simple calculation, validated against a geochemical model, allows us to simulate the spatial distribution of the isotopic ratio. Despite the similar spatial distribution of contaminant concentrations, simulated isotopic ratios are completely different. Field data correspond to a very localized degradation of PCE and TCE compounds. The presence of a small degradation zone has important consequences on the future evolution of the plume and on the potential remediation techniques.",M1
18260519,"Comparison of light traps, gravid traps, and resting boxes for West Nile virus surveillance.West Nile virus surveillance was conducted at five sites in New Castle County, <e>DE</e>, and one site in Salem County, NJ, from June through September, 2004, using dry ice-baited Centers for Disease Control miniature light traps, infusion-baited gravid traps, and resting boxes. All trap types were simultaneously placed at each site every two weeks and run overnight. Collected mosquitoes were identified to species, pooled, and analyzed for virus using a real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction test. In total, 47,972 mosquitoes in 29 species or species groups were analyzed. Light traps collected 60,201 mosquitoes in 28 species or species groups. Gravid traps collected 3,195 mosquitoes in 19 species or species groups. Resting boxes collected 99 mosquitoes in nine species or species groups. In total, 1,500 mosquito pools were tested for WNV resulting in ten positive pools. All positive pools consisted of Culex pipiens, Culex restuans, or Culex salinarius. Seven positive pools were from gravid traps and three were from light traps despite testing almost 14 times as many pools from light traps. The overall infection rate from gravid traps was nearly 33 times greater than the infection rate from light traps, 2.29 and 0.07 infected mosquitoes per 1,000, respectively. The results demonstrate the advantage of using gravid traps for West Nile virus surveillance over light traps or resting boxes.",M1
18069452,"A method of assessing air toxics concentrations in urban areas using mobile platform measurements.The objective of this paper is to demonstrate an approach to characterize the spatial variability in ambient air concentrations using mobile platform measurements. This approach may be useful for air toxics assessments in Environmental Justice applications, epidemiological studies, and environmental health risk assessments. In this study, we developed and applied a method to characterize air toxics concentrations in urban areas using results of the recently conducted field study in Wilmington, <e>DE</e>. Mobile measurements were collected over a 4- x 4-km area of downtown Wilmington for three components: formaldehyde (representative of volatile organic compounds and also photochemically reactive pollutants), aerosol size distribution (representing fine particulate matter), and water-soluble hexavalent chromium (representative of toxic metals). These measurements were,used to construct spatial and temporal distributions of air toxics in the area that show a very strong temporal variability, both diurnally and seasonally. An analysis of spatial variability indicates that all pollutants varied significantly by location, which suggests potential impact of local sources. From the comparison with measurements at the central monitoring site, we conclude that formaldehyde and fine particulates show a positive correlation with temperature, which could also be the reason that photochemically generated formaldehyde and fine particulates over the study area correlate well with the fine particulate matter measured at the central site.",M1

16933503,"Breastfeeding continuation factors in a cohort of Delaware mothers.PURPOSE: To determine whether maternal age, race, or income, is the primary determinant of breastfeeding continuation rates. METHODS: Using the Delaware modified-PRAMS 2000 <e>de</e>-identified data set, multivariate modeling of age, income, race, weight, health status, and other breastfeeding continuation factors were analyzed. RESULTS: Breastfeeding continuation at 12 weeks of age was predicted by maternal age independent of race or income. Mothers greater than the mean age were 86% more likely to continue to breastfeed than younger mothers (OR 1.861 95% CI 1.234-2.805). Maternal BMI &gt; or = 26, nipple soreness, and breastfeeding difficulty were associated with lower breastfeeding continuation. DISCUSSION: Maternal age, not race or income, are driving factors in breastfeeding continuation. Physiologic variables, such as maternal obesity, breastfeeding difficulty, and nipple soreness have an adverse influence on duration of breastfeeding. Investment into processes that lengthen breastfeeding duration among mothers, especially younger mothers, who chose to initiate breastfeeding, may have individual and community benefits.",M1
16704062,"Effects of sediment-bound zinc contamination on early life stages of the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus L.) in the Christina watershed, Delaware, U.S.A.During the last century, the Christina River, the major estuarine river system in New Castle County (<e>DE</e>, USA), has received loadings of organic and inorganic chemicals, primarily from manufacturing facilities. Among the most abundant chemicals is zinc, which has accumulated in sediments at concentrations as high as 5,440 mg/kg. We studied the possible effects of zinc on early life stages of the mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus), a resident species in the river and watershed. We conducted three different types of exposures. The first was a 96-h median lethal concentration (LC50) test with larvae exposed to waterborne zinc. The second was a larval exposure with zinc-spiked sediments (obtained from the relatively uncontaminated Magothy River in Anne Arundel County, MD, USA). The third was an embryo-larval exposure with Christina River sediments having a gradient of zinc concentrations. The average 96-h LC50 with newly hatched yolk sac larvae was 970 lig/L. In the larval tests, the average 7- and 21-d LC50s were 1154 and 1012 mg/kg, respectively. In the embryo-larval test, no significant difference was found in survival at concentrations between 38.8 and 1098 mg/kg. However, significant reductions were observed in condition factor at concentrations of 582, 799, and 1098 mg/kg. We calculated an average no-observed-effects concentration of 579 mg/kg and an average lowest-observed-effects concentration of 849 mg/kg for larval survival. Based on these results, we suggest that zinc in the Christina River may be affecting early life stages of the mummichog.",M1

15749541,"Atmospheric nitrogen inputs to the Delaware Inland Bays: the role of ammonia.A previous assessment of nitrogen loading to the Delaware Inland Bays indicates that atmospheric deposition provides 15-25% of the total, annual N input to these estuaries. A large and increasing fraction of the atmospheric wet flux is NH(4)(+), which for most aquatic organisms represents the most readily assimilated form of this nutrient. Particularly noteworthy is a 60% increase in the precipitation NH(4)(+) concentration at Lewes, <e>DE</e> over the past 20 years, which parallels the increase in poultry production on the Delmarva Peninsula over this period (currently standing at nearly 585 million birds annually). To further examine the relationship between local NH(3) emissions and deposition, biweekly-integrated gaseous NH(3) concentrations were determined using Ogawa passive samplers deployed at 13 sampling sites throughout the Inland Bays watershed over a one-year period. Annual mean concentrations at the 13 sites ranged from &lt;0.5 microg NH(3)m(-3) to &gt;6 microg NH(3)m(-3), with a mean of 1.6+/-1.0 microg NH(3)m(-3). At most sites, highest NH(3) concentrations were evident during spring and summer, when fertilizer application and poultry house ventilation rates are greatest, and seasonally elevated temperatures induce increased rates of microbial activity and volatilization from soils and animal wastes. The observed north-to-south concentration gradient across the watershed is consistent with the spatial distribution of poultry houses, as revealed by a GIS analysis of aerial photographs. Based on the average measured NH(3) concentration and published NH(3) deposition rates to water surfaces (5-8 mm s(-1)), the direct atmospheric deposition of gaseous NH(3) to the Inland Bays is 3.0-4.8 kg ha(-1)yr(-1). This input, not accounted for in previous assessments of atmospheric loading to the Inland Bays, would effectively double the estimated direct dry deposition rate, and is on par with the NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+) wet fluxes. A second component of this study examined spatial differences in NO(3)(-) and NH(4)(+) wet deposition within the Inland Bays watershed. In a pilot study, precipitation composition at the Lewes NADP-AIRMoN site (DE 02) was compared with that at a satellite site established at Riverdale on the Indian River Estuary, approximately 21 km southwest. While the volume-weighted mean precipitation NO(3)(-) concentrations did not differ significantly between sites, the NH(4)(+) concentration observed at Riverdale (26.3 micromoles L(-1)) was 73% greater than at Lewes (15.2 micromoles L(-1)). More recently, a NADP site was established at Trap Pond, DE (DE 99), which was intentionally located within the region of intense poultry production. A comparison of the initial two years (6/2001-5/2003) of precipitation chemistry data from Trap Pond with other nearby NADP-AIRMoN sites (Lewes and Smith Island) reveals fairly homogeneous NO(3)(-) wet deposition, but significant spatial differences ( approximately 60%) in the NH(4)(+) wet flux. Overall, these results suggest that local emissions and below-cloud scavenging provide a significant contribution to regional atmospheric N deposition.",M1
15625982,"Percent free PSA as an additional measure in a prostate cancer screen.OBJECTIVE: To assess the ability of the ratio of free prostate specific antigen to total prostate specific antigen (% fPSA) to aid in selection of subjects who would require follow-up studies. DESIGN: Retrospective, nonrandomized analysis measuring total prostate specific antigen (tPSA) and free prostate specific antigen (fPSA) in serum from men enrolled in a community-based prostate cancer screening offered by the Cancer Outreach Program (COP), Christiana Care Health Systems (CCHS), Wilmington, <e>DE</e>. PARTICIPANTS Informed consent was obtained from 172 of the 231 eligible participants. Complete laboratory and follow-up data, excluding ethnic origin, was gathered from 157 participants; therefore, theoretical participation was 75% (172/231) while realized participation rate was 68% (157/231). Criteria for inclusion in this study included ambulatory men of age 40 and older with serum total PSA (tPSA) level &gt;1.9 ng/mL and/or an enlarged or abnormal prostate by digital rectal examination (DRE). Subjects with a history of prostate cancer or prostatitis were excluded. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Laboratory tests to determine tPSA and fPSA were performed on serum samples obtained from consenting participants. Percent fPSA was calculated. Results of clinical findings with respect to each participant's DRE were recorded as normal, suggestive of a benign condition, such as benign prostate hyperplasia, or suspicious for prostate cancer. When available, transurethral ultrasound (TRUS) results and biopsy results were also noted. Each participant's results were evaluated and given one of the following diagnoses: Normal prostate (N), Benign Prostate Hyperplasia (BPH), or Prostate Cancer (PCa). RESULTS: Prevalence of cancer 3/157 = 0.0191; of BPH = 0.688; of N = 0.293. Median values for tPSA for each of these groups were as follows: N, 2.9 ng/mL; BPH, 3.0 ng/mL; and PCa, 6.3 ng/mL; (p = 0.079). Median values for fPSA were as follows: N, 0.6 ng/ mL; BPH, 0.5 ng/mL; PCa, 0.5 ng/mL; (p = 0.51). Median values for % fPSA were as follows: N, 19%; BPH, 17%; and PCa, 9%; (p = 0.01). Medians were found to differ for % fPSA measurements, but not for tPSA or fPSA values. DRE screening results of 110 subjects were reported as not normal indicating either an enlarged (n = 97) or abnormal prostate gland (n = 13). Nine subjects had normal DRE results with serum tPSA level above 4.0 ng/mL. Using the combination of DRE and tPSA &gt; 4.0 ng/mL as criteria for the recommendation of follow-up studies, 119 of the participants would have been advised to seek additional testing. CONCLUSION: Using these two routine criteria, 119 (119/157; 76%) subjects would be candidates for follow-up procedures, such as transurethral ultrasound (TRUS) and/or sextant prostate biopsy. By adding % fPSA results of &lt; 10% fPSA to tPSA results &gt; 4.0 mg/mL as criteria for follow-up studies, specificity can be improved threefold with sensitivity unchanged. If an abnormal DRE suggestive of malignancy was included as part of the criteria, sensitivity of the diagnostic scheme would reach 100%. Using the triple diagnostic parameters of tPSA &gt; 4.0 ng/mL, the ratio of free prostate specific antigen to total prostate specific antigen &lt;10%, and an abnormal prostate DRE, 16 participants would be recommended for follow-up studies (16/157; 10%). This would eliminate 103 subjects from unnecessary and expensive testing.",M1
14602617,"Diversity and abundance of uncultured cytophaga-like bacteria in the Delaware estuary.The Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group is known to be abundant in aquatic ecosystems and to have a potentially unique role in the utilization of organic material. However, relatively little is known about the diversity and abundance of uncultured members of this bacterial group, in part because they are underrepresented in clone libraries of 16S rRNA genes. To circumvent a suspected bias in PCR, a primer set was designed to amplify 16S rRNA genes from the Cytophaga-Flavobacterium group and was used to construct a library of these genes from the Delaware Estuary. This library had several novel Cytophaga-like 16S rRNA genes, of which about 40% could be grouped together into two clusters (<e>DE</e> clusters 1 and 2) defined by sequences initially observed only in the Delaware library; the other 16S rRNA genes were classified into an additional four clades containing sequences from other environments. An oligonucleotide probe was designed for the cluster with the most clones (DE cluster 2) and was used in fluorescence in situ hybridization assays. Bacteria in DE cluster 2 accounted for about 10% of the total prokaryotic abundance in the Delaware Estuary and in a depth profile of the Chukchi Sea (Arctic Ocean). The presence of DE cluster 2 in the Arctic Ocean was confirmed by results from 16S rRNA clone libraries. The contribution of this cluster to the total bacterial biomass is probably larger than is indicated by the abundance of its members, because the average cell volume of bacteria in DE cluster 2 was larger than those of other bacteria and prokaryotes in the Delaware Estuary and Chukchi Sea. DE cluster 2 may be one of the more abundant bacterial groups in the Delaware Estuary and possibly other marine environments.",M1

12143993,"Natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents at Area 6, Dover Air Force Base: groundwater biogeochemistry.Monitored natural attenuation (MNA) has recently emerged as a viable groundwater remediation technology in the United States. Area 6 at Dover Air Force Base (Dover, <e>DE</e>) was chosen as a test site to examine the potential for MNA of tetrachloroethene (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) in groundwater and aquifer sediments. A  lines of evidence  approach was used to document the occurrence of natural attenuation. Chlorinated hydrocarbon and biogeochemical data were used to develop a site-specific conceptual model where both anaerobic and aerobic biological processes are responsible for the destruction of PCE, TCE, and daughter metabolites. An examination of groundwater biogeochemical data showed a region of depleted dissolved oxygen with elevated dissolved methane and hydrogen concentrations. Reductive dechlorination likely dominated in the anaerobic portion of the aquifer where PCE and TCE levels were observed to decrease with a simultaneous increase in cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE), vinyl chloride (VC), ethene, and dissolved chloride. Near the anaerobic/ aerobic interface, concentrations of cis-DCE and VC decreased to below detection limits, presumably due to aerobic biotransformation processes. Therefore, the contaminant and daughter product plumes present at the site appear to have been naturally atteuated by a combination of active anaerobic and aerobic biotransformation processes.",M1
12143992,"Natural attenuation of chlorinated solvents at Area 6, Dover Air Force Base: characterization of microbial community structure.A polyphasic approach based on cultivation and direct recovery of 16S rRNA gene sequences was utilized for microbial characterization of an aquifer contaminated with chlorinated ethenes. This work was conducted in order to support the evaluation of natural attenuation of chlorinated ethenes in groundwater at Area 6 at Dover Air Force Base (Dover, <e>DE</e>). Results from these studies demonstrated the aquifer contained relatively low biomass (e.g. direct microscopic counts of &lt; 10(7) bacteria/g of sediment) comprised of a physiologically diverse group of microorganisms including iron reducers, acetogens, sulfate reducers, denitrifiers, aerobic and anaerobic heterotrophs. Laboratory microcosms prepared with authentic sediment and groundwater provided direct microbiological evidence that the mineralization of vinyl chloride and cis-dichloroethene as well as each step in the complete reductive dechlorination of tetracloroethene to ethene can occur in the Area 6 aquifer. Enrichment cultures capable of the oxidative degradation of cis-1,2-dichloroethene (cis-DCE) and vinyl chloride (VC) were obtained from groundwater across the aquifer demonstrating the possible importance of direct, non-cometabolic oxidation of cis-DCE and VC in natural attenuation. Culture-independent analyses based upon recovery of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed the presence of anaerobic organisms distributed primarily between two major bacterial divisions: the delta subdivision of the Proteobacteria and low-G + C gram positive. Recovery of sequences affiliated with phylogenetic groups containing known anaerobic-halorespiring organisms such as Desulfitobacterium, Dehalobacter, and certain groups of iron reducers provided qualitative support for a role of reductive dechlorination processes in the aquifer. This molecular data is suggestive of a functional linkage between the microbiology of the site and the apparent natural attenuation process. The presence and distribution of microorganisms were found to be consistent with a microbially driven attenuation of chlorinated ethenes within the aquifer and in accord with a conceptual model of aquifer geochemistry which suggest that both reductive and oxidative mechanisms are involved in heterogeneous, spatially distributed processes across the aquifer.",M1

11347596,"Stable carbon isotope evidence for intrinsic bioremediation of tetrachloroethene and trichloroethene at area 6, Dover Air Force Base.Area 6 at Dover Air Force Base (Dover, <e>DE</e>) has been the location of an in-depth study by the RTDF (Remediation Technologies Development Forum Bioremediation of Chlorinated Solvents Action Team) to evaluate the effectiveness of natural attenuation of chlorinated ethene contamination in groundwater. Compound-specific stable carbon isotope measurements for dissolved PCE and TCE in wells distributed throughout the anaerobic portion of the plume confirm that stable carbon isotope values are isotopically enriched in 13C consistent with the effects of intrinsic biodegradation. During anaerobic microbial reductive dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons, the light (12C) versus heavy isotope (13C) bonds are preferentially degraded, resulting in isotopic enrichment of the residual contaminant in 13C. To our knowledge, this study is the first to provide definitive evidence for reductive dechlorination of chlorinated hydrocarbons at a field site based on the delta13C values of the primary contaminants spilled at the site, PCE and TCE. For TCE, downgradient wells show delta13C values as enriched as -18.0/1000 as compared to delta13C values for TCE in the source zone of -25.0 to -26.0/1000. The most enriched delta13C value on the site was observed at well 236, which also contains the highest concentrations of cis-DCE, VC, and ethene, the daughter products of reductive dechlorination. Stable carbon isotope signatures are used to quantify the relative extent of biodegradation between zones of the contaminant plume. On the basis of this approach, it is estimated that TCE in downgradient well 236 is more than 40% biodegraded relative to TCE in the proposed source area.",M1

Six 170 x 170-m plots were established; 3 were sprayed on 4 occasions at a rate of 1.5 fl oz/acre (0.054 kg active ingredient/ha) and 3 were controls. On each plot, marsh fiddler crab (Uca pugnax) populations were monitored by repeatedly counting the number of burrow holes in 2 counting areas marked out along tidal guts. One half of each counting area was covered with bird netting to evaluate sublethal toxic effects, which, if present, could result in increased susceptibility to bird predation. A statistically significant linear association was established between the number of holes and the number of crabs. No significant differences were found in the numbers of holes (or crabs) in the sprayed vs. control plots and in the covered vs. uncovered sections. However, survival of juvenile crabs in in situ bioassays was significantly reduced (16% lower) by the spraying. Median acetylcholinesterase activity in claw muscle of red-jointed fiddler crabs (Uca minax) collected 2 days after an operational spray with Abate 4E was significantly reduced (28% lower) compared to unsprayed crabs. In view of the toxicity to juvenile crabs and the cholinesterase inhibition, we recommend continued monitoring and research for nontarget impacts of Abate 4E on fiddler crabs to establish whether the reported level of cholinesterase inhibition results in acute or chronic toxicity.",M1

The DE var serotype was found to be antigenically unrelated by virus-neutralization (VN) test to nine reference IBV serotypes from North America. Additional VN tests indicated that the DE var isolates (DE/072/92, DE/121/ 92, DE/152/92, and DE/174/92) from broilers were fully or partially neutralized by monospecific antisera prepared against themselves and against two IBV field isolates (DE/492/90 and DE/903/90) recovered from a Delmarva commercial layer flock experiencing egg production losses in 1990. Antigenic relatedness values determined by VN indicated layer isolate DE/492/90 was more closely related to the broiler DE var isolates than was layer isolate DE/903/90. Cross-challenge tests performed in specific-pathogen-free chickens also demonstrated the antigenic similarity of the broiler (DE/072/92 and DE/174/92) and the layer isolates (DE/492/90 and DE/903/90), with heterologous strain protection values ranging from 55% to 100%. Protection values of DE var isolates vs. Massachusetts 41 and Arkansas DPI were considerably lower (0-60%). The S-1 gene of the US/DE/072/92 isolate of the DE var serotype was amplified by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, cloned, and sequenced. The DE var S-1 gene sequence was compared with the S-1 gene sequences of IBV serotypes from North America, Europe, and Australia. A dendrogram based on this analysis supported the conclusion that the DE var serotype is highly novel among IBV. A high degree of similarity (&gt; 88%) was observed between the S-1 genes of the DE var broiler isolates (DE/072/92 and DE/174/92) and layer isolates (DE/492/90 and DE/903/90). These data, taken with the VN and cross-challenge results, establish a genetic as well as an antigenic link between the isolates from layers and broilers and indicate the DE var serotype was responsible for both infectious bronchitis outbreaks.",M1
11362860,"Court dismisses patients' claims against dentist with AIDS.Dentist Raymond P. Owens of Wilmington, <e>DE</e>, was diagnosed with HIV in March 1989 and continued to treat patients up until the time of his death in March 1991. The Delaware Division of Public Health then issued a general alert to Dr. Owens' patients, asking them to seek HIV-antibody tests. None of the 630 patients who complied with the alert tested positive. However, 38 patients filed a suit against the dentist and his estate, alleging negligence, battery, and fraudulent misrepresentation. The State Superior Court granted summary judgement for the dentist's estate, and the plaintiffs appealed. The State Supreme Court noted that none of the patients contracted HIV or alleged that they were exposed to any of Dr. Owens' lesions. Owens consistently wore latex gloves and followed superior sterilization procedures. The patients, the Court stated, relied on public misconception about AIDS to bolster a claim that their fears were reasonable. Justice Joseph T. Walsh wrote for the majority in this case, stating that the plaintiffs hypothesized as to the possible exposure without offering substantiating evidence to that effect. Because Dr. Owens had performed the dental procedures that the patients agreed to, his estate could not be sued for battery. The plaintiffs were allowed to seek recovery based on a claim that Dr. Owens had lied to them about his illness. However, the Court ruled that any damages should be limited to economic relief. With the exception of the case of Florida dentist Dr. David Acer, no instances of HIV transmission from infected dentist to patient have been documented by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).",M1

RESULTS: Sixty-nine samples were HCoV-NL63 positive, 35 were with high loads, and of these 25 were single HCoV-NL63 infections. Based on the number of children with high HCoV-NL63 infection and no additional infection, the overall annual incidence in outpatients was 7 per 1000 children per year (95% confidence interval (CI) 3-13 per 1000 children per year), which can be extrapolated to an absolute number of 16,929 visits to the physician due to an HCoV-NL63 infection in Germany per year. The estimated hospitalization rate is 22 per 100,000 children (95% CI: 7-49 per 100,000 children per year). This number reflects 522 HCoV-NL63 children in Germany per year. A large year-to-year difference in HCoV-NL63 infection frequency was observed. Combining these data with those of other studies in Western Europe revealed that HCoV-NL63 infections follow a 2-year inter-epidemic period with peaks of infection in the winters of 2000/2001, 2002/2003 and 2004/2005 (p&lt;0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: HCoV-NL63 infection in children below 3 years of age often requires a visit to the physician in an outpatient clinic, especially during peak-years, but hospitalizations are relatively infrequent.",M2
20183750,"[Parental enquiries before frequenting the outpatient paediatric orthopaedic consultation--focus Internet]PURPOSE: Every day several million people are seeking for answers to medical problems via the internet. In particular parents, whose children are affected by systemic diseases, orthopaedic defective positions, anomalies or deformities, use the internet to increase their knowledge. Concerning this situation there is a lack of studies in the current literature. METHODS: We investigated parental preparation to the outpatient paediatric orthopaedic consultation at our University Hospital with respect to internet enquiries or further sources of information using a standardised questionnaire. We assessed age and educational background of the parents, local hardware equipment and general habits of internet use. In particular, we retrieved parental use of search machines (e.g., Google.<e>de</e>, Yahoo.de), general medical websites (e.g., netdoktor.de) and websites from self-help groups (e.g., klumpfusskinder.de). RESULTS: In total, 288 out of 300 questionnaires (96%) were evaluated. More than half of the parents (57%) were over 35 years of age and 78% were women. 82% of the study population had access to the internet at home and 70% used the internet regularly. More than 80% obtained information about the orthopaedic diseases of their child beforehand. Age and educational background of the parents were not significantly correlated with the extent of enquiries (p &gt; 0.05). 90% of the parents, using the internet as source of information, frequented internet search machines; approximately one third used general medical websites. In particular in clubfeet we observed a highly significant (p &lt; 0.001) tendency of parents to frequent websites from self-help groups. 60% of the study population assessed the internet information as useful; 92% will frequent the internet as source of information again. One third of the respondents is going to discuss the obtained internet information with the physician. CONCLUSIONS: The internet is an important source of information for parents in the field of paediatric orthopaedics. Treating physicians will be increasingly confronted with the results of parental internet enquiries.",M2

20150450,"Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of intensified versus standard dosing of mycophenolate sodium in renal transplant patients.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Adequate early mycophenolic acid (MPA) exposure is an important determinant for effective rejection prophylaxis. This pharmacokinetic study investigated whether an intensified dosing regimen of enteric-coated mycophenolate sodium (EC-MPS) could achieve higher mycophenolic acid (MPA) exposure early after transplantation versus a standard dosing regimen. DESIGN, SETTING, PARTICIPANTS, &amp; MEASUREMENTS: <e>De</e> novo kidney transplant recipients (n = 75) who were treated with basiliximab induction and cyclosporine were randomly assigned to receive EC-MPS as either standard dosing (1440 mg/d; n = 37) or intensified dosing (days 0 through 14: 2880 mg/d; days 15 through 42: 2160 mg/d; followed by 1440 mg/d; n = 38). Full 12-hour pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profiles were taken at six time points during the first 3 months. Exploratory analysis of inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase (IMPDH) activity was also performed for better understanding of the pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship between MPA exposure and IMPDH activity in the early posttransplantation period. Preliminary efficacy parameters, safety, and tolerability were assessed. RESULTS: Exposure to MPA was significantly higher on days 3 and 10 after transplantation in the intensified versus standard EC-MPS group, with 52.9 versus 22.2% (P &lt; 0.05) of patients reaching MPA exposure &gt;40 mg/h per L in the first week. The intensified regimen resulted in significantly lower IMPDH activity on day 3 after transplantation, and the overall safety was comparable for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: These pharmacokinetic and safety data support further research on the hypothesis that early adequate MPA exposure could improve clinical outcome.",M2
20101381,"[Assessing the health target  Reduce tobacco consumption ]The consortium gesundheitsziele.<e>de</e> has defined health targets and actions to reduce tobacco consumption of the general population. Five primary fields of action were defined: (1) tax increase, (2) ban of advertisements, (3) protection against second-hand smoking, (SHS) (4) support of smoking cessation, and (5) actions to avoid taking up smoking. The achievements in recent years are described by means of epidemiological studies and other specific data. (1) Tax increases led to a significant rise of cigarette prices. (2) A complete ban of advertisements has not yet been achieved. The tobacco industry shifted expenditures to fields where advertising is still allowed. (3) Many actions to foster protection against SHS could be implemented. Public awareness has been raised, the acceptance of smoking bans has grown, and exposure to SHS has been reduced. (4) Demand and supply of smoking cessation interventions have been enhanced. (5) Actions to avoid taking up smoking seem to be successful as the rate of smokers among young people has decreased, the number of never-smokers has increased, and a more critical attitude of non-smokers towards smoking could be observed. It is recommended that the above actions be continued because the capabilities of the structural, mass media, and behavioral interventions have not been fully exhausted.",M2

19962696,"Student nurses' <e>de</e>-escalation of patient aggression: a pretest-posttest intervention study.BACKGROUND: Experts recommend staff training to prevent and manage aggressive situations involving patients or their relatives. However, in many countries this subject is not covered in pre-registration nursing education. In addition, the evidence regarding its impact on practical placements remains weak. OBJECTIVE: This study examines the influence of an aggression management training programme for nursing students on their performance in de-escalating aggressive patients. DESIGN: Pretest-posttest within-and-between-groups design. SETTING: A School of Nursing in Germany. PARTICIPANTS: Convenience sample out of six classes of nursing students at differing educational levels (10th to 28th month of nursing education, n=78, mean age=22). METHODS: In a cross-sectional and longitudinal two groups before and after design nursing students encountered two scenarios (A or B) with simulation patients. After completing the training, each student was confronted with the unknown other scenario. De-escalation experts from three German-speaking countries evaluated 156 video scenes using the De-escalating Aggressive Behaviour Scale (DABS), not knowing whether the videos had been recorded before or after the training. Mean values and statistical significance tests were computed to compare the results. RESULTS: The performance levels of students who had been trained rose significantly from 2.74 to 3.65 as measured by the DABS on a 5-point Likert scale (Wilcoxon test p&lt;.001). The trained students managed scenario A significantly better than the untrained students (untrained 2.50, trained 3.70; Mann-Whitney-U-test p&lt;.001,). Similar results were found for scenario B (untrained 3.01, trained 3.61; Mann-Whitney-U-test p&lt;.001). No significant differences were found in the pretest results irrespective the students' age or duration of previous nursing education. CONCLUSIONS: Aggression management training is able to improve nursing students' performance in de-escalating aggressive behaviour. A maturation-effect on the de-escalating performance due to general nursing education or age is unlikely.",M2

The baseline clinical and angiographic characteristics and follow-up events for 1 year were recorded for all enrolled patients. In addition, a health economics assessment was performed at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months after initial stent placement. The composite of death, myocardial infarction, and stroke, defined as major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events, and target vessel revascularization were used as the primary objectives. From October 2005 to October 2006, 6,384 patients were enrolled (sirolimus-eluting stents, n = 2,137; paclitaxel-eluting stents, n = 2,740; bare metal stents, n = 485) at 98 Deutsches Drug-Eluting Stent Register sites. With similar baseline clinical and descriptive morphology of coronary artery disease between both drug-eluting stent groups, no differences were present at 1 year of follow-up in the rates of overall mortality (3.8% vs 4.1%), target vessel revascularization (10.4% vs 10.4%), overall stent thrombosis (3.6% vs 3.8%), and major adverse cardiac and cerebrovascular events (8.1% vs 8.0%). Compared with the bare metal stent group, patients treated with drug-eluting stents had significantly lower rates of myocardial infarction (3.2% vs 6.0%; p &lt;0.01), stroke (1.2% vs 2.7%; p &lt;0.05), and target vessel revascularization (10.4% vs 14.9%; p &lt;0.01) without any difference in the stent thrombosis rate (3.7% vs 4.3%; p = 0.57) or mortality rate (4.0% vs 5.2%; p = 0.21).

19891046,"Low toxicity regimens in renal transplantation: a country subset analysis of the Symphony study.Regional transplant practices may affect clinical outcomes within multinational studies. This study evaluated whether the overall results from the Symphony study can be generalized to the participating countries. <e>De</e> novo adult renal transplant recipients (n = 1645) were randomized to receive standard-dose cyclosporine, or daclizumab induction plus low-dose cyclosporine, low-dose tacrolimus,or low-dose sirolimus, all in addition to mycophenolate mofetil and steroids. Data for the highest patient-recruiting countries, Spain (n = 275),Germany (n = 316) and Turkey (n = 258), were compared. Patient transplant characteristics were different among the country subsets; only deceased donors in Spain, more expanded criteria donors in Germany, and mainly living donors in Turkey. Efficacy results for the three countries were consistent with that of the overall study - renal function and biopsy-proven acute rejection (BPAR)rates were superior with low-dose tacrolimus. Turkey had higher mean calculated glomerular filtration rate across all treatment groups (60.6-72.2 ml/min)compared with that of Spain (51.1-57.5 ml/min) and Germany (51.3-62.9 ml/min). Spain and Turkey had lower BPAR rates across the four treatment groups compared with the overall study; Germany had much higher rates(21.0-54.2%). These findings confirm the general applicability of the Symphony study results and highlight the importance of inclusion of patients from different geographic origins in randomized clinical trials.",M2

The radium economy, episteme of risk and the emergence of tracer technique in national socialism]Following the traces of radioactive material is--as scholars have recently shown--a valuable historical approach in order to evaluate the material 'factor' of science in action. Even though the origins of materials like radium and artificial isotopes are quite different, their circulation is interconnected. A material pathway can be drawn from the radium industry to the scientific rise of artificial isotopes as indicator substances in the 1930s, continuing to the building of networks by German scientists working for the war efforts. Also, this pathway reveals the role of radiation protection in establishing that material culture. Finally, the dynamics of material traces and institutional linkages is shown by the tracer work of biophysicists and radiation biologists working at the Genetic Department of the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute for Brain Research in Berlin and at the Institut <e>de</e> Chimie Nucléaire at Paris, which at that time was occupied by German troops.",M2

METHODS: A multi-site, prospective study was conducted with 318 HTx candidates (18% female, 82% male; 53 +/- 11 years of age) newly listed at 17 hospitals in Germany and Austria. Baseline demographic and psychosocial characteristics were assessed by questionnaires. Indicators of disease severity (Heart Failure Survival Score, creatinine, cardiac index) and 12-month outcomes (death, high-urgency HTx, elective HTx, <e>de</e>-listing due to deterioration or improvement) were provided by Eurotransplant. RESULTS: By 12 months, 33 patients died, 83 received an urgent HTx, 30 underwent an elective HTx, and 9 were de-listed due to clinical deterioration and 17 due to improvement. All measures of disease severity predicted outcomes. Controlling for disease severity, the number of social contacts contributed significantly to outcomes, favoring those who improved. Comparing socially isolated patients (&lt;4 social contacts/month) who also had depression scores in the clinical range (high psychosocial risk group; n = 37) to those with &gt;10 social contacts/month without depression (low psychosocial risk group; n = 47) revealed significant differences in the distribution of outcome frequencies (chi-square = 11.2, df = 4, p &lt; 0.04). The high psychosocial risk group was more likely to have died/deteriorated and less likely to have improved than the low psychosocial risk group. CONCLUSIONS: Regardless of disease severity, socially isolated HTx candidates who are also depressed may be at increased risk for clinical deterioration and mortality, indicating a need for psychosocial intervention.",M2

Due to the low response rates and relevant side effects of current chemotherapy regimens, several attempts have been made to improve chemotherapy in recent years. In a retrospective survey the current state of the art of chemotherapy for penile carcinoma in Germany was analysed. METHODS: The study took the form of a retrospective survey among all urological departments in Germany. The questionnaire contained seven questions concerning indications and modalities for chemotherapy of penile carcinoma in addition to general questions. RESULTS: Out of 280 departments 129 (46%) returned an answered questionnaire. Chemotherapy was reported to be carried out by 91 of the answering departments and overall 18 different chemotherapy regimens were used. The regimens cisplatin/methotrexate/bleomycin, vinblastin/methotrexate/bleomycin and cisplatin/5FU were the most frequently reported. Chemotherapy was carried out on average 2.3 times per year per department. The majority of the departments reported response rates under 30%. Finally 101 of the answering departments confirmed the necessity of new chemotherapy regimens. CONCLUSIONS: The current state of the art for chemotherapy of penile carcinoma showed a very large variation in Germany. The response rates were disappointing. A nationwide study with new chemotherapy approaches is urgently needed (information under www.uni-rostock.<e>de</e>/peniskarzinom).",M2

A group of experts was given the task of developing an evaluation strategy, defining success indicators, and examining the availability of data sources for evaluation. With regard to the health target  Increasing health competence, strengthening patient sovereignty , the evaluation is focusing on what effect the corresponding targets and measures are having on users and how they are perceived (summative evaluation), i.e., primarily on measuring outcomes at the population level. An examination of available studies and surveys shows that to date little is known about the expectations and assessments of health-service users.

Furthermore, we depict sociodemographic and clinical baseline characteristics and an estimation of the coverage and representativity as to the composition of persons living with HIV/AIDS (PLWHA) in Germany. METHODS: The KompNet cohort is an open, retrospective and prospective, multicenter, disease-specific and nationwide cohort study that started gathering data in June 2004. Semi-annually, follow up visits of the patients are documented, covering clinical and sociodemographic data. At enrolment and three years afterwards, an EDTA-sample is taken; a serum-sample is taken at every follow up visit. RESULTS: As of 14.9.2008, a total of 15,541 patients were enrolled by 44 documenting sites. In September 2007, the cohort size was reduced to 10 outpatient clinics and fifteen private practitioners, covering a total of 9,410 patients. The documentation of these patients comprises 24,117 years of follow up-time since enrolment (mean: 2.6 years), 62,862 person years inclusive data documented retrospectively on course of HIV-infection and combined antiretroviral therapy (cART, mean: 6.7 years). 1,008 patients (10.7%) were lost to follow up and 175 (1.9%) died since enrolment. 84.9% of patients were men. Main risks of transmission were sex between men (MSM: 62.9%), heterosexual contacts (18.4%), intravenous drug use (IVDU: 7.0%) and origin from a high prevalence country (HPL: 5.2%). Mean age was 45 years. CONCLUSION: The KompNet cohort covers about a quarter of all patients being under treatment in Germany. The composition of the cohort represents well the most important risks of transmission in Germany. The cohort contains a high proportion of patients being older than 49 years (28.1%). On basis of its comprehensive database and its biomaterials banks, the KompNet cohort serves as an important instrument to monitor and analyse the effects of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) in Germany, interdigidating basis, clinical and psychosocial research in view to translational research.",M2

The results of such trials represent the most solid rationale for therapeutic recommendations in the S3 guideline of medical societies (http://www.leitlinie.<e>de</e>). The performance of studies according to good clinical practice (GCP) guidelines (Guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonization on Good Clinical Practice) is extremely demanding. The findings can shake long established principles and practices to the core. For more than 20 years now, the management of femoral shaft fractures in critically injured patients has been controversially discussed. There are two different concepts competing against each other: Early total care (ETC) aiming at definitive care by immediate femoral nailing and damage control orthopedics (DCO), where nailing is performed at a later time point after initial retention by the use of external fixation. In order to answer this still unresolved question, the Damage Control Study is currently under way involving 25 trauma centers throughout Germany. This study is funded by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (DFG, German Research Association), it is endorsed by the board of Deutschen Gesellschaft für Unfallchirurgie (DGU, German Society for Casualty Surgery) and it is embedded in a joint program of the DFG and the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) to support clinical studies in Germany. Moreover, the study is supported by the ChirNet Site at Witten/Herdecke-Köln (http://www.chir-net.de). Without a doubt, this RCT is one of the most important studies carried out in the field of care for the critically injured patient, because the results will have a profound influence on the future management of femoral shaft fractures in multiple trauma patients and because successful completion of this study will underline the high scientific competence and skills claimed by German trauma surgeons. At the same time, ironically, the success of this study is endangered by the dilemma of an as yet insufficient recruitment of suitable patients to be enrolled into the trial. In this article possible explanations for this problem will be discussed based on a case report and the specific challenges in performing RCTs that scrutinize questions in the field of surgery will be analyzed.",M2

METHODS AND RESULTS: Therefore, the three-year clinical outcome of the paclitaxel-eluting Corofiex Please stent in patients with <e>de</e>-novo coronary lesions was evaluated in the single-arm PECOPS I pilot study. The clinical data of 123/125 (98.4%) of all patients included were available 3.05 +/- 0.12 years following stent deployment. In the intention-to-treat analysis the incidence of cardiac death was 9/123 (7.3%), of myocardial infarction 4/123 (3.3%), and of in-segment target lesion revascularization 14/123 (11.4%). Target lesion revascularizations tended (p = 0.30) to occur less frequently (9/96 (16.6%)) in those patients in whom the stent length was longer than the lesion (4.80 +/- 2.71 mm) compared to 5/27 (18.5%) in those patients in whom the stent was shorter than the lesion (-3.0 +/- 2.43 mm). Stent thromboses occurred in 2/123 (1.6%) patients during the first 6 months, one of which two days after premature discontinuation of clopidogrel. The total 3-year MACE rate was 22/123 (17.9%).

19479294,"Occurrence of benzotriazoles in the rivers Main, Hengstbach, and Hegbach (Germany).BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: Benzotriazoles (BT) as 1H-benzotriazole (1H-BT), 5-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (5Me-BT), and 4-methyl-1H-benzotriazole (4Me-BT) are frequently used as corrosion inhibitors in dish washer detergents, aircraft <e>de</e>-icing/anti-icing fluids (ADAF), automotive antifreeze formulations, brake fluids, fluids for industrial cooling systems, metal-cutting fluids, and in solid cooling lubricants. Discharge of treated municipal waste water and controlled over-runs of combined waste water sewers are potential point sources for BT in rivers. The aim of this monitoring study was to yield an overview on exposure concentrations and loads of BT in the German rivers Main, Hengstbach, and Hegbach. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Concentrations of 1H-BT, 5Me-BT, and 4Me-BT were determined in grab samples collected from different sampling points in the rivers Main, Hengstbach, and Hegbach at four different sampling times. Main and Hengstbach rivers were sampled close to Frankfurt International Airport. Both rivers receive domestic waste water effluents. BT were extracted from 2.5 L of river water by solid phase extraction using Bond Elut ppl cartridges (200 mg/3 mL). The extracts were analyzed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry in full scan mode. Mass flows of BT were calculated by concentrations multiplied by mean daily river flow rates. Median concentrations and mass flows were compared for different rivers. Mass flows were also compared for selected sampling points at different sampling times. RESULTS: 1H-BT, 5Me-BT, and 4Me-BT were detected in Main and Hengstbach rivers. 1H-BT and 5Me-BT were also detected in Hegbach River. Concentrations ranged from 38 to 1,474 ng/L for 1H-BT, from 25 to 281 ng/L for 5Me-BT, and from 25 to 952 ng/L for 4Me-BT. Median concentrations of 1H-BT, 5Me-BT, and 4Me-BT were lower in Main than in Hengstbach River. Much higher median mass flows of all BT were calculated for Main than for Hengstbach River. At sampling points P9 (Main) and P5 (Hengstbach) concentrations of 4Me-BT and 5Me-BT increased from March 29, 2008 to May 1, 2008 to June 22, 2008 whereas daily mean river flow rate decreased simultaneously. However, concentration of 1H-BT in Main and Hengstbach River increased from March 29, 2008 to May 1, 2008 and decreased again on June 22, 2008. In the Main River, lowest and highest mass flows for all BT were calculated on June 22, 2008 and May 1, 2008, respectively. In the Hengstbach River lowest and highest mass flows for 1H-BT and 4Me-BT were also calculated on June 22, 2008 and May 1, 2008, respectively. However, mass flows of 5Me-BT in Hengstbach River were rather similar at all three sampling times. In all grab samples, 1H-BT was more abundant than 5Me-BT and 4Me-BT in Main and Hengstbach River, except on June 22, 2008. Ratios of 1H-BT/(5Me-BT + 4Me-BT) determined on March 15, 2008, March 29, 2008, and May 1, 2008 varied between 1.6 and 9.0 with a median value of 1.9 (n = 9) whereas on June 22, 2008 the ratios varied between 0.4 and 0.7 with a median value of 0.6 (n = 5). DISCUSSION: Due to the absence of waste water effluents in the Hegbach River, other input sources as controlled over-runs of combined waste water sewers and/or atmospheric deposition of BT must be regarded as possible input sources. Exfiltration of ground water containing BT to Hegbach River must be also regarded, especially when considering the high polarity of BT. Median concentrations of BT in Main River were much lower than in Hengstbach River due to dilution. However, median mass flows were higher in the Main River than in the Hengstbach River. Higher mass flows could be attributed to higher source strengths and/or numerous emissions sources in the Main River. Mass flows determined on June 22, 2008 in Main and Hengstbach rivers probably reflect emissions of BT only from dishwasher detergents since de-icing operations were unlikely at that time. Emissions of BT from dish washer detergents are rather constant without any seasonal variations. Assuming the absence of additional input sources and constant in-stream removal processes, mass flows calculated for all other sampling times must be nearly similar to mass flows for June 22, 2009 as it was only observed for 5Me-BT in Hengstbach River. The higher mass flows for 1H-BT and 4Me-BT in March and May in both rivers could be an indication for temporal variations of emission pattern and/or of in-stream removal processes. 1H-BT/(4Me-BT + 5Me-BT) ratios above one in March and May and below one in June could be also an indication for temporal variations of input and/or removal processes. CONCLUSIONS: 1H-BT, 5Me-BT, and 4Me-BT used as corrosion inhibitors in many applications were detected in the rivers Main, Hengstbach, and Hegbach with relative high temporal and spatial concentration variations. Dilution is a dominant factor that influences exposure concentrations of BT in the studied rivers. We conclude that, especially in smaller rivers (as Hengstbach River), the hydrological situation has to be regarded when predicting exposure concentrations of BT. Characteristic emission strength and in-stream removal processes must be known to relate loads of BT in river water to different sources. The ratio of 1H-BT/(4Me-BT + 5Me-BT) could be possibly used for source apportionment. RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: Time series analyses of BT in composite river water samples collected at two river sites of the Hengstbach/Schwarzbach catchment area, without any waste water effluents in between, are recommended to study in-stream removal of BT. In addition, exposure modeling is recommended of BT, regarding all input sources and in-stream removal processes to predict exposure concentrations of BT in rivers. In order to calibrate and validate the model, additional monitoring data are required.",M2

Results of the health care research study LIVE-<e>DE</e> (long-acting insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin in Germany)]BACKGROUND: Economic aspects and patient-reported outcomes play an increasing role in the choice of therapeutic options. The aim of the LIVE-DE study (Long-acting insulin glargine versus NPH insulin cost evaluation in Germany[DE]) was to assess expenditures incurred in the care of diabetic patients, as well treatment satisfaction of patients with type 2 diabetes treated with insulin glargine (GLAR) or NPH insulin (NPH). PATIENTS AND METHODS: A retrospective, non-interventional, cross-sectional study was undertaken in Germany of 1,602 insulin-treated patients (982 on GLAR, 620 on NPH), enrolled from 199 randomly selected general practitioner or internal medicine specialist practices. Total cost of diabetes care (insulins, oral antidiabetic drugs, glucagon use, consumables for insulin administration and blood glucose self-monitoring devices) were calculated from total recorded expenditures, for a period of six months, from the perspective of statutory health insurance. Cost data were obtained from publicly available sources, based on the prices in the year 2007. Patient treatment satisfaction was assessed using previously validated questionnaires (SF-12, PAID, DTSQ, ITEQ). RESULTS: Physicians prescribed GLAR more often than NPH combined with oral antidiabetic drugs (43 % vs 16%), whereas NPH was more often used in an intensified insulin regimen compared to GLAR (79 % vs 49%). The mean total costs per patient over six months were lower in GLAR than NPH treated patients (658258 vs 685242 Euros [EUR]; p&lt;0.001). The higher drug costs for basal insulin in the GLAR group (19497 vs 11674 EUR) were counterbalanced by lower costs for bolus insulin (96133 vs 158133 EUR), test strips (287137 vs 321142 EUR) and needles (4031 vs 4640 EUR). Only in the NPH group was glucagon use documented (in four patients). Patients treated with GLAR reported significantly higher treatment satisfaction. After adjustment of empirical results (by analysis of covariance), mean total costs of diabetes were higher in GLAR patients (+73.1 EUR; p&lt;0.001). But treatment satisfaction remained significantly higher with GLAR. CONCLUSION: Based on the comparison of total diabetes treatment costs under real-life conditions between glargine and NPH insulin based treatment regimens, these results indicate that the choice of a given treatment should be determined by medical advantages and patients' preferences. Because of a lower injection rate and a higher patient treatment satisfaction, the use of glargine as first-line therapeutic approach is justified in order to achieve target glycemic control in insulin dependent type 2 diabetics.",M2

19358085,"[At home in a home? Did <e>de</e>-hospitalisation mean de-institutionalisation?]OBJECTIVES: In the last decades, long-time patients were systematically discharged from psychiatric hospitals in order to integrate this disadvantaged population into the community. This procedures where adequately evaluated and are regarded to be completed in the western world today. However, few evidence has been presented regarding the further course of integration following discharge from mental hospitals: was integration into community really successful or were patients permanently placed in sheltered housing staffed 24 hours 7 days a week. This review focuses on the question whether papers describing large de-institutionalisation projects mention the level of institutional support in the years following discharge from hospital. Furthermore we tried to find out which parameters are dealt with when describing successful community integration. METHODS:  Pubmed  was searched for studies on de-institutionalisation projects published between 1997 and 2007. RESULTS: The discharge from the mental hospital wards was in all studies described as successful, positive effects like an increased quality of life were found. However, studies describing the years following discharge mentioned that patients continuously stayed in sheltered housing with care offered 24 hours a day. CONCLUSION: Reviewing the available data about the level of support regarding accommodation of former long time patients, the danger of  trans-institutionalisation  has to be pointed out. Evidence is lacking concerning support models tailored to the individual needs of the patients. Similarly, possible side effects of long-term stays in sheltered housing staffed 24 hours a day have not yet been established. Therefore, we see a need for further evaluation of different models of supported housing for former long-term hospitalised patients, as well as for new chronic mentally ill patients.",M2
19252804,"Lack of increase of cerebrovascular events during German World Cup soccer games in 2006.An association of passively watching a soccer game with an incidence of cardiovascular events was previously reported. With access to the stroke database of the Federal State of Hesse, Germany, we examined whether the incidence of cerebrovascular events was elevated during the Federation Internationale <e>de</e> Football Association (FIFA) World Cup in Germany from 9 June to 9 July 2006 on days of matches involving the German team and whether particular characteristics were noted in stroke patients on these days. We analyzed a prospective stroke registry and calculated incidence ratios for the 7 days of matches played by the German team as compared with the control period ranging from May 2006 to July 2006 using a Poisson regression with a log link to model the number of cerebrovascular events per day for all patients and for subgroups of patients, grouped according to sex, severity of stroke, type of stroke and risk factors. About 2,918 patients with ischemic stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage were included. The regression model did not disclose a higher incidence of cerebrovascular events on days of matches played by the German team. Onset admission time on these days was significantly reduced. In contrast to recent observations regarding cardiac events, we found no effect of passively watching soccer games on incidence of stroke or intracerebral hemorrhage, probably because of the different underlying pathophysiologies of stroke and cardiac events. Onset admission time was slightly reduced on days when a German match was played, probably since more strokes occurred under observation of potential support persons, reflecting the tendency of German people to gather to watch matches played by the national team.",M2
19228079,"Effect-directed analysis of sediment-associated algal toxicants at selected hot spots in the river Elbe basin with a special focus on bioaccessibility.Benthic algae are the dominant primary producers in many rivers and may be at risk of being affected by sediment-associated toxicants. Toxicity as well as bioaccessibility should be considered for the identification of major toxicants affecting benthic algae. Thus, effect-directed analysis (EDA) combining biotesting, fractionation, and chemical analysis was combined with both exhaustive and bioaccessibility-directed extraction to identify the major toxicants in sediments at three industrial sites in the Elbe River basin (Bitterfeld, Most, and Prelouc). Exhaustive accelerated solvent extraction was used together with bioaccessibility-directed extraction with TENAX in aqueous suspension. Growth inhibition of the green alga Scenedesmus vacuolatus identified polycyclic aromatic compounds as important algal toxicants at all three sites, while in Bitterfeld and Prelouc additional toxicants, such as N-phenyl-2-naphthylamine and 7H-benzo[<e>de</e>]anthracen-7-one, played an important role. Confirmation of the identified compounds was based on the index of confirmation quality (ICQ) comparing the effect of an artificial mixture to that of the original sample. The results suggest a successful confirmation of identified toxicants for most fractions with ICQ values between 0.5 and 2. The bioaccessibility of toxicants decreased in the order Prelouc &gt; Bitterfeld &gt; Most as determined by the investigation of TENAX samples. Similar total concentrations of toxicants in Prelouc and Most sediment result in bioaccessible concentrations in Prelouc that exceed those in Most by a factor of 10 to 20. The extraction with TENAX with a subsequent EDA proved to be a powerful tool for prioritizing contaminants and contaminated sites with respect to the hazard of sediment-associated toxicants to green algae.",M2
19199957,"The German Mouse Clinic: a platform for systemic phenotype analysis of mouse models.The German Mouse Clinic (GMC) is a large scale phenotyping center where mouse mutant lines are analyzed in a standardized and comprehensive way. The result is an almost complete picture of the phenotype of a mouse mutant line--a systemic view. At the GMC, expert scientists from various fields of mouse research work in close cooperation with clinicians side by side at one location. The phenotype screens comprise the following areas: allergy, behavior, clinical chemistry, cardiovascular analyses, dysmorphology, bone and cartilage, energy metabolism, eye and vision, host-pathogen interactions, immunology, lung function, molecular phenotyping, neurology, nociception, steroid metabolism, and pathology. The German Mouse Clinic is an open access platform that offers a collaboration-based phenotyping to the scientific community (www.mouseclinic.<e>de</e>). More than 80 mutant lines have been analyzed in a primary screen for 320 parameters, and for 95% of the mutant lines we have found new or additional phenotypes that were not associated with the mouse line before. Our data contributed to the association of mutant mouse lines to the corresponding human disease. In addition, the systemic phenotype analysis accounts for pleiotropic gene functions and refines previous phenotypic characterizations. This is an important basis for the analysis of underlying disease mechanisms. We are currently setting up a platform that will include environmental challenge tests to decipher genome-environmental interactions in the areas nutrition, exercise, air, stress and infection with different standardized experiments. This will help us to identify genetic predispositions as susceptibility factors for environmental influences.",M2
19189155,"[Health-related self-help of immigrants in Germany. Chances, barriers, potential]Migrants in Germany participate in health-related self-help groups nearly as frequently as native-born Germans--as long as they have good German language skills and are widely integrated into the main society. However, the situation is different for those migrants who are not or only slightly integrated. Mother-tongue self-help groups of ethnic minorities would offer good chances for health-related self-management and coping; however, these groups are rare. This can partly be explained by the lack of knowledge of many migrants about support possibilities for self-help groups, also because the term  self-help  has no equivalent in many languages. On the other hand, there are many barriers for self-help activities: false shame attributed to certain health problems, fear of <e>de</e>-anonymization in ethnic communities, different concepts of health and illness, a lack of judging the potential of one's own competencies and self-efficacy, and particularly illiteracy. This article describes the relevance of self-help among migrants with special regard to self-organized migrant networks and outlines the current state of discussion within the self-help stakeholders. Finally, potential multipliers, networking examples and qualification measures for promotion of health-related self-help among migrants are presented.",M2

19175869,"Lack of <e>de</e> novo hepatitis C virus infections and absence of nosocomial transmissions of GB virus C in a large cohort of German haemodialysis patients.To determine the prevalence and incidence of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections among haemodialysis patients, a large prospective multicentre trial was conducted in the German Federal State of North Rhine-Westphalia. Sera obtained from the recruited patients in two separate sampling rounds run 1 year apart were analysed for both anti-HCV antibodies and HCV RNA. HCV RNA positive samples were also genotyped by direct sequencing of an HCV core fragment. In the first and second rounds, 150 (5.2%) of 2909 and 114 (5.4%) of 2100 patients were anti-HCV positive, respectively, and 4% of individuals were viraemic. Evaluation of potential risk factors in a case-control study indicated that the factors 'foreign country of birth', 'blood transfusions given before 1991' and 'duration of treatment on haemodialysis' were associated with the risk of HCV infection. Among the 2100 patients of whom 'paired' serum samples from both rounds were available for testing, not a single 'de novo' HCV infection could be recorded. The fact that in a subset of about 20% of these patients no nosocomial GB virus C (GBV-C) transmission occurred during the observational period suggests that the lack of HCV seroconversions was not only attributable to the isolation of HCV-infected patients but also to the strict adherence to so-called universal hygienic precautions for infection control maintained in the participating dialysis centres.",M2

Patterns of outpatient smoking cessation counselling and treatment]A qualified and comprehensive supply of outpatient smoking cessation counselling and treatment is essential to help smokers quit. In order to assess the status quo, structure and regional differences of the smoking cessation services available in Germany, a complete market survey was conducted in 2007. Descriptive results on the structure and characteristics of smoking cessation services show that there are distinct regional differences, especially in the New Laender, where the supply is insufficient. Overall, about a quarter of the providers of smoking cessation services lack specialised additional skills required for smoking cessation counselling, treatment or therapy of addicts. Especially medical practitioners more often lack such additional skills compared to other occupational groups. The smoking cessation services generally used the programs  Rauchfrei in 10 Schritten  and  Das Rauchfrei Programm , and the method of cognitive behavioural therapy.

20509446,"[L'image <e>de</e> la posture--l'image du mouvement: on the relationship between orthopaedic and neurological forms of representation in 19th century clinical photography]The question of how medicine represents and documents malfunctions and deviances of human posture and movement is intrinsically linked to the problem of how those occurrences, which can be seen as the end result of medical treatment and manipulations, could be identified and classified. In fact, the relation of posture and movement is reciprocally interconnected: The  normality  of either state cannot be established or clinically reproduced without knowledge of the other. Both conditions of posture and movement serve as reference points for each other and help to distinguish between the dynamics of physiology and illness over the course of time. It is therefore understandable that orthopaedic surgeons and neurologists in particular, with a deeper interest in orthopaedic applications, were crucially involved in the collection of special cases of posture and movement disorders from their clinical experience. Not simply for didactic purposes, but likewise for the benefit of documenting their own treatment success, they strove to accurately depict severe cases of posture and movement disorders with the new visualization technique of photography. Clinical photography's allegedly  realistic capacity of representation  predestined the new method for capturing long-term processes of illness and therapy in collections of serial images. However, the very early clinical photographs of the 19th century had their origins rather in areas of psychiatric and neurological uses, and it was not until much later that clinical photography made its way into the surgical and orthopaedic fields of medicine. This article scrutinizes some of the intricate relations, which can be found in the neurological and orthopaedic representations of posture and movement as depicted in early clinical photography.",M2
20509445,"[Albert Schweitzer's MD thesis on Criticism of the medical pathographies on Jesus]The prominent philosopher, theologian, physician, musicologist and organ soloist Albert Schweitzer (14. 1. 1875-4. 9. 1965) submitted his MD thesis Kritik der von medizinischer Seite veröffentlichten Pathographien uber Jesus (Criticism of the medical pathographies on Jesus) in 1913. Very soon he published this work under the title Die psychiatrische Beurteilung Jesu. Darstellung und Kritik (The psychiatric evaluation of Jesus. Description and criticism) in order to reach a broader audience. Schweitzer's explicit motive for selecting this topic was to influence the theological debate by means of a M. D. thesis on psychiatric pathographies on Jesus. He was confronted with a lot of reproaches. These reproaches contended that his theological opinions had been supporting tendencies to describe Jesus as a mentally ill person or a religious fanatic. In addition, some authors of pathographies on Jesus (<e>De</e> Loosten, Binet-Sanglé, Hirsch, Rasmussen) characterized Jesus as mentally ill, suffering from paranoia. Schweitzer intended to reject the reproaches considering himself and the postulates of the authors of the pathographies. Schweitzer combined in a transdisciplinary way theological, psychiatric and psychopathological arguments. He did this in a very convincing way. Although Schweitzer did not deal with a central or explicit psychiatric question, he implicitly postulated transdisciplinary approaches for proper retrospective pathographies on historic persons. At the age of thirty, Schweitzer decided to finish his academic career and to begin studies in medicine as a preparation for work as a physician in Africa. This decision provoked much lack of understanding in his personal environment. Therefore it may be possible that a very personal motive contributed to the selection of the topic of the MD thesis. Among psychiatric authorities, Albert Schweitzer's interest in the criticisms of psychiatric pathographies and his transdisciplinary approach to this topic encountered rather criticism from a positivistic point of view than understanding. As a reaction to this, Schweitzer postulated some fundamental positions regarding the cultural or social responsibility of science and regarding the interdisciplinary cooperation within the universitas litterarum. These positions precede the way Albert Schweitzer is reconsidered as author in cultural studies and ethicist. The fact that this happened immediately before the beginning of the WWI may show his farsightedness.",M2

Within a few years, many countries had started to use mass radiography.

When Germany attacked Norway in April 1940, the Chief Tuberculosis Inspector Otto Galtung (1904 - 81), was making plans for a nation-wide screening programme with mass radiography. He was fired by the Nazis who continued his work and started screening in 1943. The first mass radiography in Norway was carried out in Bergen in September 1940. Almost 11 000 pupils and teachers from all schools in Bergen were examined under the management of Holfelder, then an SS-Standartenführer (colonel) and radiologist in the occupation force.

18987905,"Procedures and methods of benefit assessments for medicines in Germany.The Federal Joint Committee (FJC; Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA) defines the health-care elements that are to be reimbursed by sickness funds. To define a directive, the FJC can commission benefit assessments, which provide an overview of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and benefits of an intervention. This paper describes the operational implementation of the legal requirements with regard to the benefit assessments of medicines. Such benefit assessments are sometimes referred to as  isolated benefit assessments,  to distinguish them from benefit assessments as part of a full economic evaluation.The FJC has the freedom to commission these assessments from any agency; however, to date the majority have commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Nevertheless, the content of this paper applies integrally to any institute commissioned for such assessments. In this report, 'the institute' is used when the text refers to any of these institutes.The legal framework for benefit assessments is laid out in the German Social Code Book version V ( http://www.sozialgesetzbuch.<e>de</e> ), Sects. 35b ( section 1), 139a ( section 4-6) and Sect. 139b ( section 3). It is specified that: The institute must guarantee high transparency. The institute must provide appropriate participation of relevant parties for the commission-related development of assessments, and opportunity for comment on all important segments of the assessment procedure. The institute has to report on the progress and results of the work at regular intervals. The institute is held to giving the commission to external experts. Based on the legal framework, the institute must guarantee a high procedural transparency. Transparency of the whole process should be achieved, which is evidenced by clear reporting of procedures and criteria in all phases undertaken in the benefit assessment. The most important means of enhancing transparency are: 1. To implement a scoping process to support the development of the research question. 2. To separate the work of the external experts performing the evidence assessment from that of the institute formulating recommendations. Therefore, the preliminary report as produced by external experts needs to be public, and published separately from any subsequent amendments or (draft-)reports made by the institute, which includes the institute's recommendations. 3. To implement open peer review by publishing both the comments of the reviewers and their names. Based on the legal framework, the institute must provide for adequate participation of relevant parties. These include organisations representing the interests of patients; experts of medical, pharmaceutical and health economic science and practice; the professional organisations of pharmacists and pharmaceutical companies; and experts on alternative therapies. Patients and health care professionals bring in new insights with respect to research priorities, treatment and outcomes.The relevant parties should be identified and contacted whenever the global scope of the assessment has been drafted. Subsequently, the relevant parties should be involved in defining the research question, developing the protocol and commenting on the preliminary report. To implement the involvement of relevant parties in defining the research question a scoping process is suggested. For the other phases, written comments followed by an oral discussion should be used. Finally, the relevant parties should have the right to appeal the final decision on judicial grounds. None of these steps mean that the institute would lose any part of its scientific independence.From the relevant sections of the legal framework with respect to the assessment methods, it can be concluded that: 1. The institute must ensure that the assessment is made in accordance with internationally recognised standards of evidence-based medicine (EBM). 2. The assessment is conducted in comparison with other medicines and treatment forms under consideration of the additional therapeutic benefit for the patients. 3. The minimum criteria for assessing patient benefit are improvements in the state of health, shortening the duration of illness, extension of the duration of life, reduction of side effects and improvements in quality of life. EBM refers to the application of the best available evidence to answer a research question, which can inform questions about the care of patients. The optimal design, even for effectiveness questions, is not always the randomised, controlled trial (RCT) but depends on the research question and the outcomes of interest. To increase transparency for each question, the levels of evidence examined should be made explicit. There is no empirical evidence to support the use of cutoff points with respect to the number of studies before making recommendations. To get the best available evidence for the research question(s), all relevant evidence should be considered for each question, and the best available evidence should be used to answer the question. Separate levels of evidence may have to be used for each outcome.There are many ways in which bias can be introduced in systematic reviews. Some types of bias can be prevented, other types can only be reported and, for some, the influence of the bias can be investigated. Reviews must show that potential sources of bias have been dealt with adequately.Methods used by other agencies that perform benefit assessments are useful to interpret the term 'international standards' to which the institute must comply. The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE) is a good example in this respect. NICE shows that it is possible to have transparent procedures for benefit assessments but that this requires detailed documentation. NICE has implemented an open procedure with respect to the comments of reviewers, which makes the procedure transparent. Although the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG) in Germany invites comments on their protocol and preliminary report by posting them on their website, and comments are made public, the individual comments are not evaluated openly, and therefore it remains uncertain whether or not they lead to changes in the reports. The participation of relevant parties in the assessment process as implemented by NICE guarantees a process that is transparent to all relevant parties.Transparency of the whole process is assured by clear reporting of procedures and criteria in all phases undertaken in the benefit assessment. In a scoping process, a draft scope is commented on first in writing and subsequently in the form of a scoping workshop. In this way, all relevant aspects can be heard and included in the final scope. The protocol is then developed, followed by evidence assessment. The methods used should be completely reported to show readers that the assessment has been performed with scientific rigour and that bias has been prevented where possible. All relevant parties should have the opportunity to comment on the draft protocol and the draft preliminary report. Each comment should be evaluated as to whether or not it will lead to changes, and both the comments and the evaluation should be made public to ensure transparency of this process. The same procedure should be used for the peer-review phase. Based on the final report of the evidence assessment, the institute forms recommendations and the FJC appraises the evidence.During the writing of the final report, a separation between the evidence assessment and the evidence-appraisal phase should be implemented. Ideally, this separation should be legally enforced to prevent any confusion about conflict of interests.Such a process guarantees a feasible combination of the legal requirements for transparency and involvement of relevant parties with international standards of EBM to ensure that the benefit assessments of medicines in Germany are performed according to the highest standards.",M2
19034813,"[Procedures and methods of benefit assessments for medicines in Germany]The Federal Joint Committee (FJC; Gemeinsamer Bundesausschuss, G-BA) defines the health-care elements that are to be reimbursed by sickness funds. To define a directive, the FJC can commission benefit assessments, which provide an overview of the scientific evidence regarding the efficacy and benefits of an intervention. This paper describes the operational implementation of the legal requirements with regard to the benefit assessments of medicines. Such benefit assessments are sometimes referred to as  isolated benefit assessments,  to distinguish them from benefit assessments as part of a full economic evaluation. The FJC has the freedom to commission these assessments from any agency; however, to date the majority have commissioned the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). Nevertheless, the content of this paper applies integrally to any institute commissioned for such assessments. In this report,  the institute ' is used when the text refers to any of these institutes. The legal framework for benefit assessments is laid out in the German Social Code Book version V (http://www. sozialgesetzbuch.<e>de</e>), Sects. 35b ( section sign 1), 139a ( section sign 4-6) and Sect. 139b ( section sign 3). It is specified that: The institute must guarantee high transparency. The institute must provide appropriate participation of relevant parties for the commission-related development of assessments, and opportunity for comment on all important segments of the assessment procedure. The institute has to report on the progress and results of the work at regular intervals. The institute is held to giving the commission to external experts. Based on the legal framework, the institute must guarantee a high procedural transparency. Transparency of the whole process should be achieved, which is evidenced by clear reporting of procedures and criteria in all phases undertaken in the benefit assessment. The most important means of enhancing transparency are: 1. To implement a scoping process to support the development of the research question. 2. To separate the work of the external experts performing the evidence assessment from that of the institute formulating recommendations. Therefore, the preliminary report as produced by external experts needs to be public, and published separately from any subsequent amendments or (draft-)reports made by the institute, which includes the institute's recommendations. 3. To implement open peer review by publishing both the comments of the reviewers and their names. Based on the legal framework, the institute must provide for adequate participation of relevant parties. These include organisations representing the interests of patients; experts of medical, pharmaceutical and health economic science and practice; the professional organisations of pharmacists and pharmaceutical companies; and experts on alternative therapies. Patients and health care professionals bring in new insights with respect to research priorities, treatment and outcomes. The relevant parties should be identified and contacted whenever the global scope of the assessment has been drafted.

18963722,"Health literacy and patient information: developing the methodology for a national evidence-based health website.OBJECTIVE: To define evidence-based health information and the conceptual framework and methodology of Germany's national health information website. METHODS: Description of the political and methodological processes in the development of the website Gesundheitsinformation.<e>de</e>/Informed Health Online developed by the Institute of Quality and Efficiency in Health Care (IQWiG). RESULTS: Autonomy, empowerment and health literacy were useful theoretical concepts to guide the definition of evidence-based health information and the objectives and methodologies used for developing this website. These choices had direct practical consequences for the patient information. CONCLUSION: Evidence-based patient information involves the use of evidence and systematic methodologies in several facets of information provision. These include a process of information development that minimises bias, evidence as the information basis for the content, and the use of evidence-based communication techniques. To be empowering and support patient autonomy, information should be patient-centred and non-directive. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: Health websites are communication interventions which can have very different objectives and methods. A conceptual framework can help guide these choices and provide a basis for subsequent evaluation.",M2
18842397,"Mesenchymal stem cells as a potential pool for cartilage tissue engineering.Osteoarthritis (OA) resulting from trauma, degenerative or age-related disease presents a major clinical challenge due to the limited repair capacity of articular cartilage. This poor self-repair capacity of osteochondral defects has resulted in the development of a wide variety of new treatment approaches. Although the use of chondrocytes in applications of cartilage tissue engineering is still prevalent, concerns associated with donor-site morbidity, cell <e>de</e>-differentiation and the limited lifespan of these cells have brought the use of mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) to the forefront of such applications. Therefore, in the last two decades MSCs have come into the focus of connective tissue engineering and regenerative medicine and have become increasingly sought after as an alternative cell source for improving well-established methods of osteochondrotic cartilage defect repair such as the Autologous Chondrocyte Transplantation method, but are also being tested as an ideal cell source in combination with newly developed implantable scaffolds or as a target/carrier cell in other new concepts of regenerative medicine. However, up to now, although in animal models MSCs have already shown significant potential for cartilage repair and novel approaches using MSCs as an alternative cell source to patient-derived chondrocytes are being tested, much more research is needed before feasible clinical application of MSCs becomes reality.",M2
18831949,"Prioritisation of infectious diseases in public health--call for comments.In order to allocate rationally resources for research and surveillance of infectious diseases at the level of the German public health institute (RKI), we prioritised pathogens by public health criteria. After screening the relevant literature we developed a standardised methodology including a three-tiered scoring system for selected pathogens. The pathogens were rated in four categories containing a total of 12 criteria: burden of disease including incidence, severity, mortality; epidemiologic dynamic including outbreak potential, trend, emerging potential; information need including evidence on risk factors/groups, validity of epidemiologic information, evidence for pathogenesis; international duties and public attention; health gain opportunity including preventability, treatability. For each criterion a numerical score of +1, 0 or -1 was given and each criterion received a weight by which the numerical score of each criterion was to be multiplied. The total weighted scores ranged from +22.7 (influenza) to - 64.4 (cholera) with the median being -22.9 (rubella). Relevant changes were observed between weighted and unweighted scores. The chosen approach proved to be feasible and the result plausible. However, in order to further improve the methodology we invite experts to give feedback on the methodology via a structured web-based questionnaire at www.rki.<e>de</e>/EN &gt; Prevention of infection &gt; Infectious Disease Surveillance &gt; Pathogen prioritization.

18831138,"The dynamics of Wertbestimmung.The procedure of Wertbestimmung played a vital role in the implementation of serum therapy and the standardization of mass-produced pharmaceuticals. In fin-<e>de</e>-siècle Germany, a legal framework was put in place to guarantee serum quality and safety and to minimize any associated public health risks. Because the sera were biological remedies, it was difficult to produce them in uniform quality and the procedure of Wertbestimmung, i.e. determining the potency of the serum based on an objective and comparable value, was extremely complex. Various agents such as bacteria cultures, serum hosts, or test animals had to be regulated. In the years after 1895, numerous efforts to stabilize the procedures of Wertbestimmung were undertaken by serum producers and members of the state-run survey institute responsible for overseeing serum production. Despite efforts to stabilize the framework and to generate a reliable reference system, the framework's environment and agents were in constant flux: new producers entered the market and procedures were expanded to include other biologicals as well. The article describes the dynamics involved in the sustained efforts to maintain a stable framework in the face of constant alterations between 1895 and the 1920s.",M2

Here, we investigated the prognostic impact of MYC aberrations analyzed by interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization in 177 patients with <e>de</e> novo DLBCL treated within the two prospective, randomized trials non-Hodgkin's lymphoma NHL-B1 and NHL-B2. MYC aberrations were detected in 14 DLBCL (7.9%). In a univariate analysis compared with MYC-negative DLBCL, MYC-positive cases showed a significantly shorter overall survival (OS) (P=0.047) and relevantly, though not significantly, shorter event-free survival (EFS) (P=0.062). In a Cox model adjusted for the international prognostic index, the presence of a MYC gene rearrangement was the strongest statistically independent predictor of OS (relative risk 3.4, P=0.004) and EFS (relative risk 2.5, P=0.015), and this also held true when the cell-of-origin signature detected by immunohistochemistry was included in the model.",M2
18713535,"[A dimensional diagnostic approach using the  Assessment of DSM-IV Personality Disorders (ADP-IV)  Questionnaire]OBJECTIVES: The ADP-IV is a self-assessment instrument of personality disorders providing categorical as well as dimensional diagnoses. The German translation of the Dutch original has already shown sufficient reliability as well as a rather weak convergent validity of categorical diagnoses. This study investigates the validity of the dimensional assessment of personality disorders. METHODS: Four hundred patients and a community sample of 385 subjects completed the ADP-IV. A SCID-II interview and an expert consensus rating were also performed in 210 patients. Norms for patients and the community sample were calculated by using z-transformation. Receiver operator curves (ROC) were employed for the determination of cut-offs for categorical diagnoses on the basis of the dimensional scores. RESULTS: The ROC analyses resulted in negative predictive values of 99 % for the five most frequent personality disorders in the sample; in contrast, positive predictive values were low. CONCLUSIONS: The instrument is well suited for screening purposes, allowing for a reliable exclusion of personality disorders. For diagnosing personality disorders, however, clinical interviewing remains necessary. Norms and a dimensional personality disorder profile provide hints concerning the presence of pathological personality traits with respect to the reference group. The ADP-IV represents the only German-language questionnaire for the assessment of DSM-IV personality disorders which has been sufficiently validated.

18658022,"Transplantation of <e>de</e> novo scaffold-free cartilage implants into sheep knee chondral defects.BACKGROUND: New cell-based treatments for articular cartilage repair are needed. As the optimal scaffold for cartilage repair has yet to be developed, scaffold-free cartilage implants may remove the complications caused by suboptimal scaffolds. HYPOTHESIS: The implantation of a scaffold-free, autologous de novo cartilage implant into standardized full-thickness cartilage defects of femoral condyles in sheep leads to a qualitatively better regenerative tissue than does periosteal flap alone or no treatment. STUDY DESIGN: Controlled laboratory study. METHODS: Chondral defects 4 mm in diameter (1 per sheep) were created in the center of 1 medial femoral condyle of 48 sheep. Twelve defects were allowed to heal spontaneously, 16 defects were covered with periosteal flaps alone, and 20 defects were filled with autologous de novo cartilage graft and overlaid with a periosteal flap. Differences were assessed macroscopically using the International Cartilage Repair Society score and microscopically using the International Cartilage Repair Society histological score and Mankin score at 26 and 52 weeks. RESULTS: The results of the International Cartilage Repair Society Cartilage repair assessment showed that the transplant group was better than was the untreated control at both time periods but not significantly different than was the periosteal flap group. Implanted groups demonstrated a marked improvement in grade of defect filling, cartilage stability, cell distribution, and matrix assessments in each method of assessment. In the transplant group, 2 defects were filled with hyaline cartilage, 5 with mixed hyaline and fibrocartilage, and 2 with fibrocartilage alone. CONCLUSION: Chondral defects treated with de novo cartilage transplantation show qualitatively better microscopic and macroscopic regeneration than do those treated with periosteal flaps alone. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results of the current study show that third-generation autologous chondrocyte transplantation is a promising development in the field of biologic cartilage regeneration. Future studies should compare this technique with the original Brittberg technique.",M2

The aim was to characterize similarities and differences in the prevalence and formation of CAT in these separately bred color variants of English Cocker Spaniels. MATERIALS: The study was based on the veterinary records for presumed inherited eye diseases of 1232 English Cocker Spaniels which were provided by the German panel of the European Eye Scheme for diagnosis of inherited eye diseases in animals (DOK, &lt;http://www.dok-vet.<e>de</e>&gt;). Data included information on 615 single-colored and 617 multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. RESULTS: CAT was diagnosed in 92 (14.96%) of the single-colored and 34 (5.51%) of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels. The pedigree of the single-colored English Cocker Spaniels included 40 ophthalmologically examined dogs with 18 unaffected and 22 affected dogs. The pedigree of the multicolored English Cocker Spaniels contained 16 ophthalmologically examined dogs with 11 unaffected and five affected dogs. CONCLUSIONS: In both color variants of the English Cocker Spaniels different forms of primary CAT with respect to location within the lens occurred among close relatives. Appearance of CAT was very heterogeneous without obvious sex differences. The sample pedigrees do not support the assumption of familial segregation of specific forms of primary CAT in English Cocker Spaniels.",M2
18611292,"The His452Tyr variant of the gene encoding the 5-HT2A receptor is specifically associated with consolidation of episodic memory in humans.Basic research has shown that serotonin plays an important role in memory formation.

A study by <e>de</e> Quervain and colleagues found a highly significant association of the functional 5-HT2A receptor variant His452Tyr (rs6314) with long-term memory. We replicated this finding in a cohort of 133 adults (mean age 43.5 yr). Carriers of the Tyr allele showed poorer verbal delayed recall and recognition, while immediate recall and additional measures of attentional and executive function were not affected by the His452Tyr genotype.

18573484,"Gender differences in help-seeking behavior on two internet forums for individuals with self-reported depression.BACKGROUND: The published literature reflects differences between the sexes in the help-seeking behavior of individuals with depression. Professional mental health services reach men to a lesser extent than women. Internet forums are considered an option to better reach males specifically. OBJECTIVE: We investigated gender differences in the active use of the Internet to access English- and German-language information on depression. METHODS: Analysis differentiated contributors' sex for 200 threads (clusters of responses related to one person seeking advice) followed on 2 Internet forums, www.defeatdepression.org, originating from the United Kingdom, and www.verrueckt.<e>de</e>, originating from Germany. From the qualifying date of January 3, 2007, the investigated threads retrospectively reached 149 days. Using 2 variables,  sex ratio of regular Internet users  and  epidemiologically expected sex ratio,  we calculated a hypothetical value for the female-to-male (F:M) ratio of requests for help of 1.23 for the United Kingdom and 1.16 for Germany. Then we compared the actual versus the estimated gender distributions with a 2-sided chi 2 test. RESULTS: We included 89 queries from www.defeatdepression.org and 97 queries from www.verrueckt.de. On the English-language forum, 46 (52%) of the queries were from women and 43 (48%) from men. On the German-language forum, 67 (69%) of the queries were from women and 30 (31%) from men. The German forum had a significantly higher F:M ratio of contributors compared with the English forum (2.23 vs 1.07, respectively; chi 2 = 5.885; P = 0.015). The actual F:M ratio of contributors for the English forum was similar to the expected calculation (1.07 actual vs 1.23 expected; chi 2 = 0.230; P = 0.652), but was significantly lower than the actual versus the expected F:M ratio of contributors for the German forum (2.23 actual vs 1.16 expected; chi 2 = 4.891; P = 0.027). CONCLUSION: Possible reasons for the German Internet forum having a higher F:M ratio of contributors compared with the English Internet forum are the differences in presentation style, language, and cultural context between the 2 Web sites.",M2

Results of the Stroke Angel initiative within the BMBF project PerCoMed]BACKGROUND: Telemedical networks that apply innovative mobile information technologies (IT) are an innovative approach to improve stroke care in community settings. Within the German Stroke Angel initiative and the research project PerCoMed (Pervasive Computing in Medical Care, funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research, http://www.percomed.<e>de</e>) the effects of such a solution were assessed by an interdisciplinary research approach. The main goal of the team of researchers and practitioners was to provide clear evidence of improvements in intersectional processes of the stroke chain survival, namely in the acute stroke processes between prehospital rescue services and hospital stroke units. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Between October 2005 and October 2007 the paramedical staff of five rescue service transporters in a rural area of northern Bavaria was included in a network with the stroke unit of the Neurological Clinic Bad Neustadt. Telemedical support by the Stroke Angel computing system - a software running on a personal digital assistant (PDA) to transmit patient data from the rescue team to the hospital during patient transporting time - was established. As procedural guidance, the Stroke Angel system suggests a predefined path through the necessary emergency procedures according to the structure of the mandatory protocol and the implemented Los Angeles Prehospital Stroke Screen (LAPSS). RESULTS: In the empirical study the authors obtained a complete data set of 226 consecutively admitted patients for analysis in Bad Neustadt and LAPSS data of 217 patients from a second scenario in Düsseldorf. Medical, economic and technical analyses were applied. The technological robustness of the Stroke Angel system could be proven and information entered was transmitted fully and correctly. Concerning medical research questions, for both scenario locations LAPSS with a sensitivity of 68.3% and a specificity of 85.1% has to be deemed insufficient. Hence, alternative algorithms will have to be used in the next steps of evaluation. The system significantly influenced the clinical process of acute stroke management more than the preclinical ones (door-to-CT: 32 min. before and 16 min. at the end of the project). Lysis treatment rose from 6.12% (2005) to 11.17% (2007) of patients with acute stroke. CONCLUSIONS: From the set of perspectives taken, the study illustrates that mobile computing technologies offer new and innovative approaches to improve intersectional acute stroke care. It also teaches the participants that interdisciplinary research can significantly deepen the understanding of such technologies and projects, which can lead to better decision making concerning solution implementation, management and improvements. The approach will be brought into daily practice in Bad Neustadt/Saale within the next months.",M2

18376042,"The Danubian Biobank project.The Danubian Biobank Consortium (www.danubianbiobank.<e>de</e>) was initiated in 2005 as a network of Danube Universities and associated partner universities between Ulm and Budapest, with a major focus on case/control studies of aging disorders like vascular and metabolic diseases, Type2-diabetes, and neurodegenerative diseases. Beyond case/control studies some centers also directly participate in longitudinal population based studies and population isolate studies or provide enabling technologies for these studies. The mission of the Danubian Biobank Consortium is to directly integrate biobanking into local and regional healthcare along the Danube through E-health portal structures and IT-based strategies. Biobanking as an integral part of the workflow of the healthcare process is considered as key element to generate qualified long term patient databases and health records. The major objective of the project is to generate a common central encrypted patient and sample information database to facilitate international research interactions, combined with local and regional biobanking facilities under common Good Practice (GP) and Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) conditions to move existing healthcare systems towards personalized healthcare. This process will be driven by local E-health portal implementation to network healthcare providers, industry, insurance companies, medical research and public healthcare in a Private Public Partnership (PPP) model to cover jointly the expenses. All information including patient recruitment, blood withdrawal and storage place of the samples will be saved in phase I as standardized processing procedures (SPP) to implement a central IT-based databank in phase II, which can be used in encrypted form for scientific project planning and investigations. In the local E-health portals the actionable health information will be also accessible for direct medical care for the authorized practitioner. In addition to local centers three regional DNA, plasma, and tissue banks in Regensburg, Vienna, and Budapest store samples and encrypted patient data for scientific purposes.",M2

18344033,"Prognostic impact of contrast-enhanced CMR early after acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) in a regional STEMI network: results of the  Herzinfarktverbund Essen .BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: In acute ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), rapid restoration of epicardial coronary blood flow and myocardial perfusion limits infarct size and improves survival. Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is superior to systemic fibrinolysis when instantly performed by experienced operators. The  Herzinfarktverbund Essen  (HIVE) is an urban STEMI network supporting direct patient transfer for primary PCI to four PCI centers covering a city area of 600,000 inhabitants. Integrated health care is an optional part of the HIVE allowing for reimbursement of medical innovations such as the evaluation of infarct size and the presence and extent of microvascular obstruction by contrast-enhanced cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR). The aim of this study was to assess the prognostic impact of contrast-enhanced CMR in the patient cohort of a regional STEMI network. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Within the 1st year (09/2004 to 08/2005) of the HIVE registry, 489 patients with acute myocardial infarction were treated in the four primary PCI centers. In one of the centers, including 143 patients, early CMR imaging using a standardized MR protocol for infarct quantification was performed whenever possible. Patients with hemodynamic instability, emergency coronary artery bypass grafting, resuscitation or death prior to CMR, claustrophobia, and other general contraindications to MRI had to be excluded, leaving 67 patients (54 male; mean age 61 +/- 12 years) for final evaluation. CMR was performed 4.5 +/- 2.5 days after admission on a 1.5-T MR scanner (Sonata, Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany) including steady-state free precession (SSFP) cine imaging for left ventricular function and single-shot inversion-recovery SSFP imaging for delayed enhancement (<e>DE</e>) and no-reflow (NR) evaluation following injection of 0.2 mmol/kg body weight gadodiamide (Omniscan, GE Healthcare Buchler, Munich, Germany). NR and DE volumes were calculated from single-shot short-axis stacks taken within the 1st minute following gadodiamide infusion by manual planimetry and summation of disks. 1-year follow-up data (telephone interview) for major adverse cardiac events (MACE: cardiac death, myocardial infarction, and rehospitalization for congestive heart failure, angina pectoris, or revascularization) were available for all patients. RESULTS: DE as a measure of infarct size was 9% +/- 7% (range 0-33%) of left ventricular mass (LVM), and mean volume of microvascular obstruction was 2% +/- 3% (range 0-17%). Microvascular obstruction was present in 61% of patients. 16 MACE (one cardiac death, one myocardial infarction, and 14 rehospitalizations for congestive heart failure or unstable angina pectoris with PCI in six cases) occurred within the follow-up period of 430 +/- 63 days. Patients with MACE had larger infarcts (14% +/- 10% vs. 8% +/- 6% DE), lower left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF 44% +/- 17% vs. 48% +/- 14%) and larger NR (3% +/- 5% vs. 2% +/- 3%). Using a stepwise logistic regression model, only NR &gt; 0.5% of LVM was independently related to outcome (odds ratio = 3.9, confidence interval 1.1-13.9). CONCLUSION: NR as a correlate of microvascular obstruction remains independently related to prognosis in patients with acute myocardial infarction treated by PCI.",M2
18322772,"[RheumaCheck: development and evaluation of a German language screening instrument for rheumatic diseases]OBJECTIVE: Early diagnosis of inflammatory rheumatic diseases is important for patients' prognosis and outcome. The mean time delay of 1 to 5 years in Germany between the initial symptoms and the first rheumatologist contact should be reduced. Efficiency of patient questionnaires for the identification of inflammatory rheumatic diseases has been demonstrated in other countries. The aim of our study was to develop a patient questionnaire in German identifying inflammatory rheumatic diseases with a high sensitivity and specificity as well as a high positive predictive value. PATIENTS AND METHODS: The RheumaCheck questionnaire was developed by adoption of the FDA-approved Connective Tissue Disease Screening Questionnaire. 1448 patients (195 controls, 437 patients suspicious for and 816 patients with known inflammatory rheumatic diseases) recruited by rheumatologists and general practitioners answered the questionnaire that additionally assessed comorbidities and sociodemographic data. A predictive algorithm was calculated. RESULTS: Mean age of the complete group (73.1% female) was 52.5 +/- 15.1 years. 53.1% had no comorbidity. Application of the algorithm yields a high sensitivity (77.6%) and specificity (79.9%). The area under the ROC curve was 0.85 (p &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Being aware of a possible high rate of false true results RheumaCheck is a simple, efficient instrument easily filled out by patients. It can identify the group of patients that needs further investigation, care and assessment by a rheumatologist leading to earlier diagnosis and therapy.

18317669,"Treatment of in-stent restenosis with sirolimus-eluting-stents: results from the prospective German Cypher stent registry.AIMS: Drug-eluting stents have been reported to effectively reduce in-stent restenosis (ISR). However, the effectiveness and safety have yet been investigated only in small trials or case series. The aim of this prospective large scale registry was to show that treatment of ISR with sirolimus eluting stents (SES) is safe, effective and feasible in daily routine. METHODS AND RESULTS: The German Cypher registry prospectively enrolled 6,555 patients undergoing implantation with SES for various indications, including 1,533 patients treated for ISR. Follow-up data (median 6.6 months) of this cohort was available for 1,531 patients (99.8%). Of these patients 75.8% were male. Of these patients 36.5% (n = 552) presented with acute coronary syndromes. In total, 1,932 SES were used with successful implantation in 98.9%. MI during hospitalization was observed in 0.7% (n = 11) while in-hospital mortality was only 0.1% (n = 2). MACE-rate at follow-up was 13.8% (n = 211) including a mortality of 1.3% (n = 20) and MI in 1.9% (n = 29). Total revascularization procedures including CABG (1.7%) were necessary in 12.3% (n = 186). Target vessel revascularization (TVR) rate was 9.3% (n = 139) and thus similar to patients with <e>de</e> novo lesions (8.1%, P = 0.69). Ten patients (0.65%) suffered from subacute stent thrombosis Vs. 0.24% observed in patients with de novo lesions (P = 0.03).

18309513,"Current concepts in transplant surgery: liver transplantation today.INTRODUCTION: The discipline of liver transplantation (LTx) has been developed over the past decades, and LTx is now considered the gold standard for the treatment of patients with end-stage liver diseases and early liver tumors in cirrhotic livers. This procedure is now performed routinely in many transplant centers, and it has provided an enormous technical innovation to the field of hepatobiliary surgery. Allocation decision of liver organs is based on medical need and timing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Mayo Model for End Stage Liver Disease based on patient-specific criteria was developed and applied to prioritize patients on the waiting list. From the donor aspects of LTx, sources of organ, excluding xenotransplantation, can be brain-dead donors, living donors, and non-heart-beating donors. Today, the majority of livers are procured from cadaveric donors. In addition to the conventional LTx, other types are living-donor LTx, reuse of grafts as domino transplantation, ex situ as well as in situ split LTx, and reduced-size LTx. The transplantation procedure consists of several steps including donor selection and management, liver procurement and preservation, back-table preparation, recipient operation with liver implantation, postoperative care, immunosuppression, and follow-up. RESULTS: The postoperative complications are divided into surgical, non-surgical, and multifactorial complications. Surgical complications account about 34% of morbidities after LTx and are mainly categorized to vascular and biliary complications. The main medical ones are non-surgical bleeding and infections. The multifactorial complications include primary non- or poor function and small-for-size syndrome. The pretransplant outcome predictors of LTx can be divided into donor, recipient, operative, and postoperative factors. CONCLUSION: LTx is now considered a safe and standardized procedure with a substantially improved graft and patient survival and acceptable morbidity rates. However, the new problems, including recurrence of hepatitis C or hepatocellular carcinoma, chronic biliary complications, opportunistic infections, and development of <e>de</e>-novo malignancies are the major problems affecting the long-term outcome of transplanted patients.",M2
18292983,"[Joint logbook of the GeSRU, DGU, and BDU for  Urological Continuing Education : a milestone for urological continuing education in Germany]Since the new Regulation on Continuing Education took effect, documentation of continuing education is obligatory. At the beginning of 2007, the German Society of Residents in Urology (GeSRU) together with the German Society of Urology (DGU) represented by Professor J. Fichtner initiated a project group with the goal of enhancing the transparency of urological continuing education, modernizing it, and implementing the new possibilities afforded by the new regulation on a nationwide level. Towards realizing this project, which was joined by the Federation of German Urologists (BDU) and the Working Group of Hospital Chiefs of Staff, a joint logbook was designed. In contrast to previously obtainable logbooks, the joint logbook offers, in addition to straightforward documentation of continuing education, a definitive, clear interview guide based on objective data analysis. It provides training in agreeing on sensible objectives, it contains a model curriculum in which continuing education can be systematically yet flexibly structured, and beyond the requirements needed for obtaining qualification as a specialist includes those entitling the physician to bill health insurance providers for urological services rendered as a private practitioner. The joint logbook is accepted as an all-in-one continuing education unit record by the medical associations, health insurance providers, and the European Board of Urology. It takes the form of a dual concept and is available in hard copy as a loose-leaf binder and in a constantly updated online version (http://www.germanresidents-urolog.<e>de</e>).",M2

18277079,"A promoter polymorphism of the alpha 8 integrin gene and the progression of autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease.BACKGROUND/AIMS: Dysregulation of integrins is a feature of tissue remodeling in autosomal-dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). The alpha 8 beta 1 integrin (alpha8beta1) affects kidney development and the susceptibility to renal injury in mice. We investigated whether the -414 T/C polymorphism in the promoter region of the alpha 8 integrin chain gene (ITGA8) is associated with the progression of renal disease in ADPKD. METHODS: Genotyping for the -414 T/C polymorphism was performed by allelic separation using RT-PCR in 294 patients with ADPKD. Alpha 8 integrin expression was detected by RT-PCR and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: 41% of the study population reached end stage renal disease at a mean age of 51 +/- 12 years. The frequency of the -414 C allele was 0.194 in ADPKD. C allele carriers (CC and TC genotypes) were compared with patients homozygous for the T allele (TT genotype). Kaplan-Meier analysis revealed that end-stage renal failure occurred at a significantly younger age in TT homozygotes (median age, 47 years; 95% CI, 46-49 years) than in C allele carriers (median age, 51 years; 95% CI, 49-53 years; p = 0.046 by the log-rank test). When parameters of ADPKD patients were compared between genotype by analysis of variance, only age at onset of end-stage renal failure was significantly different (p = 0.026) whereas age at onset of hypertension, body surface area, 24-hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure did not differ. In kidneys of ADPKD, expression of alpha 8 integrin is increased and found <e>de</e> novo in cystic epithelia. CONCLUSION: A polymorphism of the ITGA8 promoter modifies the progression of renal failure in ADPKD.",M2
18234752,"Cardiovascular events during World Cup soccer.BACKGROUND: The Fédération Internationale <e>de</e> Football Association (FIFA) World Cup, held in Germany from June 9 to July 9, 2006, provided an opportunity to examine the relation between emotional stress and the incidence of cardiovascular events. METHODS: Cardiovascular events occurring in patients in the greater Munich area were prospectively assessed by emergency physicians during the World Cup. We compared those events with events that occurred during the control period: May 1 to June 8 and July 10 to July 31, 2006, and May 1 to July 31 in 2003 and 2005. RESULTS: Acute cardiovascular events were assessed in 4279 patients. On days of matches involving the German team, the incidence of cardiac emergencies was 2.66 times that during the control period (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.33 to 3.04; P&lt;0.001); for men, the incidence was 3.26 times that during the control period (95% CI, 2.78 to 3.84; P&lt;0.001), and for women, it was 1.82 times that during the control period (95% CI, 1.44 to 2.31; P&lt;0.001). Among patients with coronary events on days when the German team played, the proportion with known coronary heart disease was 47.0%, as compared with 29.1% of patients with events during the control period. On those days, the highest average incidence of events was observed during the first 2 hours after the beginning of each match. A subanalysis of serious events during that period, as compared with the control period, showed an increase in the incidence of myocardial infarction with ST-segment elevation by a factor of 2.49 (95% CI, 1.47 to 4.23), of myocardial infarction without ST-segment elevation or unstable angina by a factor of 2.61 (95% CI, 2.22 to 3.08), and of cardiac arrhythmia causing major symptoms by a factor of 3.07 (95% CI, 2.32 to 4.06) (P&lt;0.001 for all comparisons). CONCLUSIONS: Viewing a stressful soccer match more than doubles the risk of an acute cardiovascular event. In view of this excess risk, particularly in men with known coronary heart disease, preventive measures are urgently needed.",M2

Against this background the adoption of new diagnostic and therapeutic guidelines for the LRI management and of RSV-cases in particular is studied. METHODS: 1054 children aged zero to 36 months hospitalized with LRI were prospectively included in the surveillance studies  Parainfluenzavirus (PIV) and Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections in Germany [PRI.<e>de</e>] 1999-2001  and the  pediatric infectious diseases network on acute respiratory tract infections  [PID-ARI.net] for the time period of October 2002 until June 2005. The nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPA) of these children had been analysed for RSV, PIV 1,2,3 and influenzavirus (IV)-A, -B. In 2003/2004 the national guideline on how to diagnose and treat RSV-disease (bronchiolitis) changed. Data on LRI cases severity and especially those regarding the clinical management of RSV-infections were compared to see differences following the release of the guideline. RESULTS: 84% of the children were between zero and 24 months old. 34% of the NPA specimens were positive for RSV, 7.7% for PIV 1,2,3 and 4.7% for IV-A, -B. Epidemiological findings did not differ substantially between the two studies. Clinical management of RSV-LRI, especially drug use, did not change except for the lower rate of x-ray examination (p&lt;0.01). CONCLUSION: The spectrum of causing agents in LRI of children remained quite stable over of six years.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Of 2,317 outpatient surgeons who received a questionnaire by mail, 419 responded. The return rate was 18.1%. The questionnaire collected data on the operative procedures and methods of anesthesia from 2004 and the analgesics, which were applied in the immediate postoperative period and at home. Methods and contents of quality control were registered. RESULTS: The respondents indicated that the person responsible for the pain therapy was the surgeon in 74% of the practices, the anesthesiologist in 16%, and both in 10%. The drugs used in the practice were: novaminsulfone (34%), NSAIDs (28%), and opioids (36%). The drugs used for at-home care were: NSAIDs (58%), opioids (43%), novaminsulfone (32%), and mixed analgesics (28%). No analgesics were given by 6%, and 21% prescribed a supplementary antiemetic. Routine pain measurement was performed with pain scales in only 11% of the practices; among the certified practices, 48% performed pain measurement for quality control.

This enables creation of a maximally flexible and thin device (0.0029 inches) while still maintaining the requisite strength and radiopacity for effective implantation. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this multi-center, single-arm prospective clinical trial was to assess the safety and performance of the TriMaxx stent for the treatment of single <e>de</e> novo coronary artery lesions. METHODS: One hundred patients with ischemic coronary occlusive disease because of single de novo obstructive lesions of native coronary arteries were treated with 3 x 15 or 3 x 18 mm TriMaxx stents in four hospitals in Brazil and Germany between May of 2004 and September of 2005. An independent core laboratory analyzed the quantitative coronary angiography (QCA) results immediately after stent implantation, and after six months. RESULTS: The lesion, procedure, and device-deployment success rates were 100, 99, and 100%, respectively. Eighty-eight patients underwent follow-up angiography at 6 +/- 1 months. After six months, 13 (13%) of patients had sustained major adverse cardiac events, including 9.0% that required target lesion revascularization (TLR). The follow-up angiographic studies revealed a binary in-stent restenosis rate of 25% with in-stent late lumen loss of 0.94 +/- 0.57 mm. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that the TriMaxx stent can be safely deployed for the treatment of single de novo coronary occlusive lesions with six-month clinical and angiographic results rates comparable to historical results using other bare metal stents.",M2

Previously, this had been analyzed only in substudies of larger trials or in clinical investigations enrolling a small number of patients. BACKGROUND: Drug-eluting stents are highly effective in reducing the rate of in-stent restenosis. METHODS: Two hundred patients with diabetes and <e>de</e> novo coronary artery lesions were enrolled in 16 centers: 98 were randomly assigned to sirolimus-eluting stents (SES) and 102 received bare-metal stents (BMS). The primary end point was in-segment late luminal loss. Major adverse cardiac events (MACE) rate was analyzed at 30 days and 8 and 12 months. RESULTS: The extent of in-segment late luminal loss in the SES group was 0.18 mm compared with 0.74 mm in the BMS group. In-segment restenosis was identified on follow-up angiography in 8.8% of the patients in SES and in 42.1% in BMS (p &lt; 0.0001). Target lesion revascularization was performed in 5.3% of the patients in SES and in 21.1% of the patients in BMS (p = 0.002).

There was no subacute stent thrombosis in the SES group up to 1 year. The MACE rate was not significantly different at 30 days. At 12 months, MACE rate was 14.7% in SES versus 35.8% in BMS. CONCLUSIONS: The SES is safe and highly effective in patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary artery disease and associated with a significant decrease in the extent of late luminal loss.",M2
17938252,"Rituximab in relapsed lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma: long-term results of a phase 2 trial by the German Hodgkin Lymphoma Study Group (GHSG).Because nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma (NLPHL) express CD20, rituximab may be used as a nonmutagenic treatment option to avoid late toxicities in this rather indolent entity. Between 1999 and 2004, the German Hodgkin Study Group (GHSG) investigated the activity of rituximab (375 mg/m(2) in 4 doses) in a phase 2 trial in 21 relapsed or refractory NLPHL patients. The initial diagnosis of NLPHL was confirmed in 15 of the 21 enrolled patients by reference pathology. The remaining cases were reclassified as Hodgkin lymphoma transformed to T-cell rich B-cell lymphoma (TCRBCL; n = 2) or CD20(+) classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL; n = 4). In NLPHL patients the overall response rate was 94%, including 8 complete remission (CR) and 6 partial remission (PR). With a median follow-up of 63 months (range, 3-84), the median time to progression was 33 months, with the median overall survival (OS) not reached. Thus, rituximab is highly effective in relapsed and refractory NLPHL. This study is registered at http://www.klinisches-studienzentrum.<e>de</e>/trial/285.",M2
17934959,"Concentration of oxygenated polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons and oxygen free radical formation from urban particulate matter.PM2.5 filter samples were collected in summer 2005 at an urban background site in Augsburg, Germany. They were analyzed for polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and their oxygenated derivatives (O-PAH) using gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Oxygen free radical formation (reactive oxygen substances, ROS) was measured by electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy after addition of spin trapping agent directly on the same filters. The concentrations of ambient, high-boiling PAH and O-PAH were highly correlated to ROS formation, even better than to particulate mass or number concentration. Correlations were most pronounced for some polycyclic aromatic monoketones (e.g., benz[<e>de</e>]anthracene-7-one), which are not yet reported in literature to be redox cycling active. The association found between ESR measurements and the presence of specific semivolatile organic compounds suggests an important influence of wood burning in PM2.5-associated ROS formation. These results indicate that further research on the relationship between radical formation and presence of specific O-PAH and semivolatile organic compounds (SVOC) are likely to provide a better understanding of the relationship between the source-dependent chemical composition of PM and the toxicological risks associated with PM exposure.",M2
17932898,"Randomized, double-blind, multicenter study of the polymer-based 17-beta estradiol-eluting stent for treatment of native coronary artery lesions: six-month results of the ETHOS I trial.OBJECTIVES: The ETHOS I trial was the first in-human experience evaluating the safety and efficacy of two different release formulations of the 17-beta estradiol-eluting R-Stent versus uncoated control stents for the treatment of patients with single <e>de</e> novo native coronary lesions. BACKGROUND: Estrogens were reported to inhibit neointimal proliferation and to accelerate endothelial regeneration after coronary angioplasty and thus could be an ideal compound to deliver on a stent for the purpose of reducing in-stent restenosis. METHODS: Ninety-five patients were randomized to receive a slow-release (n = 32) or the moderate release (n = 31) formulations or the bare metal stent (n = 32). The primary end point was the 6-month percent in-stent volume obstruction by intravascular ultrasound (IVUS). RESULTS: Diabetes was present in 29.5% of patients; the mean reference vessel diameter was 2.90 mm; and the mean lesion length was 13.5 mm. Primary endpoint, 6-month percent in-stent volume obstruction by IVUS, did not differ significantly between the 3 groups (31% +/- 14%, 33% +/- 11%, and 31% +/- 14%, P = 0.83). Secondary endpoints also did not differ significantly between the groups including 6-month rates of in-lesion binary angiographic restenosis (13.3%, 14.3%, and 12.5%, P = 0.98), in-stent late loss (0.82 +/- 0.49 mm, 0.86 +/- 0.53 mm, and 0.84 +/- 0.46 mm, P = 0.97), target lesion revascularization (12.5%, 6.9%, and 6.5%, P = 0.64), and major adverse cardiac events (18.8%, 10.3%, and 6.5%, P = 0.31). CONCLUSIONS: In this first-in-man randomized trial, the 17-beta estradiol-eluting R-Stent, in either slow- or moderate-release formulations, was well-tolerated, but showed no benefit for treatment of coronary lesions when compared to controls.",M2
17931691,"Aquatic hyphomycete communities as potential bioindicators for assessing anthropogenic stress.With a profound knowledge of how physico-chemical parameters affect these communities, microbial communities could be used as indicators for environmental changes and for risk assessment studies. We studied aquatic hyphomycete communities in rivers and aquifers from sites shaped by intense mining activities (namely the  Mansfeld region ) and chemical industry (cities of Halle and Bitterfeld) in Central Germany. Environmental stress factors such as high concentrations of heavy metals, sulphate, and nitrate as well as low concentrations of oxygen significantly reduced the diversity and biomass of hyphomycetes in the investigated samples. Redundancy analysis (RDA) indicates that variations in water chemistry cause a significant proportion of the change in fungal community structure (86.2%). Fungi were negatively correlated with high metal and nutrient concentrations. RDA also showed a strong influence of organic matter on individual species, with Anguillospora longissima (Sacc. et Syd.), Clavatospora longibrachiata (Ingold), Clavariopsis aquatica (<e>De</e> Wild), Flagellospora curvula (Ingold), Heliscus lugdunensis (Sacc. et Thérry), Tumularia aquatica (Ingold) and Lemonniera aquatica (De Wild) being most sensitive. We propose that aquatic hyphomycete communities can be used as sensitive and integrative indicators for freshwater quality.",M2
17768686,"[A short questionnaire for assessing the social climate on forensic psychiatric wards]OBJECTIVE: To examine statistical properties and the validity of a ward climate questionnaire for forensic psychiatric institutions. The 15 item instrument comprises three climate dimensions: Patients' Cohesion and Social Support, Safety (vs. threat by aggression and violence) and Therapeutic Hold. METHOD: On 46 wards in 17 forensic hospitals in Germany, patients and staff filled in the climate questionnaire and further scales, among them the  Ward Atmosphere Scale  and a  Good Milieu Index . Problem events (e. g. wilful damage of property, drug relapse) were listed on each ward over a period of three weeks. RESULTS: 333 staff and 327 patients participated in the study. For both groups, factor analysis of item-intercorrelation generates clear 3-factor-solutions. Item-total correlation and the scales' internal consistencies (Cronbach's alpha = 0.73 - 0.87) are respectable. Correlation analysis evinces many substantial interrelations with other variables. Staff's climate assessments correlate much stronger with patients' climate assessments than with staff's job satisfaction. CONCLUSION: The climate questionnaire is an economic and valid instrument for assessing three meaningful aspects of the ward atmosphere in forensic psychiatry. An English version of the questionnaire--termed Essen Climate Evaluation Schema (EssenCES)--can be downloaded from the internet homepage of the Institute of Forensic Psychiatry Essen ( www.forensik-essen.<e>de</e> ).",M2
17692957,"Adam Christian Thebesius, a historical perspective.The Silesian physician Adam Christian Thebesius (1686-1732) was one of the most renowned scientists studying the coronary circulation and its pathologies in the eighteenth century. His groundbreaking work opened the field of coronary microcirculation for generations of scientists to come. In 1708, Thebesius published his anatomical thesis,  Disputatio medica inauguralis <e>de</e> circulo sanguinis in corde , describing the cardiac veins that emptied into chambers of the heart, the vasa cordis minima. He documented the small veins with their valves connecting the chambers of the heart with the coronary vessels.

17691113,"Intratumoral homogeneity of MGMT promoter hypermethylation as demonstrated in serial stereotactic specimens from anaplastic astrocytomas and glioblastomas.Hypermethylation of the DNA repair gene O(6)-methyl-guanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) has been linked to prolonged survival in glioblastoma patients treated with alkylating agents. It was aimed to analyze prospectively whether the MGMT status of malignant gliomas could be determined from small-sized stereotactic biopsies (maximum volume: 1 mm(3)). Special attention was directed towards the intratumoral distribution of the MGMT promoter methylation, the MGMT protein expression and potential correlations between both. Twenty-five adult patients were included (20 patients with primary World Health Organisation (WHO) Grade III or IV malignant gliomas, 5 patients with secondary malignant gliomas). About 2-4 biopsy specimens per tumor were collected from different sites within the tumor. Promoter methylation of the MGMT gene was assessed by methylation-specific PCR (MSP) and sodium bisulfite sequencing in each of the collected specimens (overall number of specimens: 69). Both methods were validated for application in small-sized tissue samples (1 mm(3)). The MGMT protein expression was analyzed by immunohistochemistry. The overall MGMT promoter methylation rate was 30% in the <e>de</e> novo group and 80% in the tumor progression group. The success rates of MSP and sequencing were 100% and 80%, respectively. Sequence analysis and MSP exhibited 100% concordant findings. No differences in MGMT promoter methylation were detected between the different samples of each individual tumor in 24 of 25 patients. One false negative result was obtained due to the contamination of the biopsy specimen by necrotic tissue. Tissue samples taken from different sites of each individual tumor (13 tumors investigated) exhibited equal or highly similar MGMT protein expression. No correlation between MGMT protein expression and MGMT promoter methylation was observed. The MGMT promoter methylation status of malignant gliomas can be reliably determined from small-sized stereotactic biopsies. The methylation profile, as defined by MSP and sodium bisulfite sequencing, constitutes a homogeneous marker throughout malignant gliomas. The lack of correlation between MGMT status and MGMT protein expression needs further evaluation.",M2

Opium and opiates in nineteenth and twentieth century literature]One cannot have an idea of this multifaceted theme without its medical and cultural-historical background. After a history of several thousand years as a remedy and consumer good, around 1800 this poppy drug was in the focus of public attention due to Brownianism, at first as an often self-prescribed unspecific remedy against physical and mental pain. Many representatives of the early Romanticism knew it from personal experience. However, it was the publication of Thomas <e>de</e> Quincey's Confessions of an English Opium-Eater (1821/1822) which made it a subject of international debate in accordance with the programmatic statements of writers of that epoque and corresponding to the antibourgeois attitude of these men.

17587460,"ProMEX: a mass spectral reference database for proteins and protein phosphorylation sites.BACKGROUND: In the last decade, techniques were established for the large scale genome-wide analysis of proteins, RNA, and metabolites, and database solutions have been developed to manage the generated data sets. The Golm Metabolome Database for metabolite data (GMD) represents one such effort to make these data broadly available and to interconnect the different molecular levels of a biological system 1. As data interpretation in the light of already existing data becomes increasingly important, these initiatives are an essential part of current and future systems biology. RESULTS: A mass spectral library consisting of experimentally derived tryptic peptide product ion spectra was generated based on liquid chromatography coupled to ion trap mass spectrometry (LC-IT-MS). Protein samples derived from Arabidopsis thaliana, Chlamydomonas reinhardii, Medicago truncatula, and Sinorhizobium meliloti were analysed. With currently 4,557 manually validated spectra associated with 4,226 unique peptides from 1,367 proteins, the database serves as a continuously growing reference data set and can be used for protein identification and quantification in uncharacterized biological samples. For peptide identification, several algorithms were implemented based on a recently published study for peptide mass fingerprinting 2 and tested for false positive and negative rates. An algorithm which considers intensity distribution for match correlation scores was found to yield best results. For proof of concept, an LC-IT-MS analysis of a tryptic leaf protein digest was converted to mzData format and searched against the mass spectral library. The utility of the mass spectral library was also tested for the identification of phosphorylated tryptic peptides. We included in vivo phosphorylation sites of Arabidopsis thaliana proteins and the identification performance was found to be improved compared to genome-based search algorithms. Protein identification by ProMEX is linked to other levels of biological organization such as metabolite, pathway, and transcript data. The database is further connected to annotation and classification services via BioMoby. CONCLUSION: The ProMEX protein/peptide database represents a mass spectral reference library with the capability of matching unknown samples for protein identification. The database allows text searches based on metadata such as experimental information of the samples, mass spectrometric instrument parameters or unique protein identifier like AGI codes. ProMEX integrates proteomics data with other levels of molecular organization including metabolite, pathway, and transcript information and may thus become a useful resource for plant systems biology studies. The ProMEX mass spectral library is available at http://promex.mpimp-golm.mpg.<e>de</e>/.",M2
17554546,"An assessment of the incidence of fistula-in-ano in four countries of the European Union.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: In spite of its long history, fistula-in-ano is generally considered to be relatively uncommon. Nevertheless, no comprehensive analysis of its incidence in developed countries is available. Our goal was to determine the actual incidence of fistula-in-ano based on the study of incidence in four countries of the European Union (EU). MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a search of hospital inpatient databases in five different countries. We obtained valid data from four European countries, namely, England (UK; Hospital Episodes Statistics), Germany (German hospitals' databases), Italy (Scheda di Dimissione Ospedaliera), and Spain (Conjunto Mínimo Básico <e>de</e> Datos by Insalud-Spanish National Health Institute). RESULTS: The incidence of fistula-in-ano varied among the different populations in the EU. In the four countries examined, it ranged from 1.04 per 10,000/year in Spain to 2.32 per 10,000/year in Italy. A statistical comparison of rates from the different countries studied gives a confidence interval from 1.20 up to 2.80. The population that we studied represents almost 51% of the total population of the EU. CONCLUSION: This study attempts to determine the actual incidence of fistula-in-ano in the European Community, which was previously uncertain despite its major negative effects on quality of life and the high cost of treatment. Our findings indicate that the incidence of fistula-in-ano in the four countries of the EU studied is significantly higher than that in the only previously published report of the incidence of fistula-in-ano in Europe. Nevertheless, our findings confirm the general perception that fistula-in-ano is a relatively uncommon disease.",M2
17534566,"The Sirolimus-eluting coronary stent in daily routine practice in Germany: trends in indications over the years. Results from the prospective multi-centre German Cypher Stent Registry.BACKGROUND: Drugeluting coronary stents (<e>DES</e>) are increasingly used during percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). Due to limited budgets in Germany, no special reimbursement has been given for their use and therefore they were mainly used in selected patients. METHODS: In order to determine the change in indications in patients treated with a Sirolimus-eluting stent (SES) in daily clinical practice between 2002 and 2005, we analysed data from a prospective multi-centre DES registry, the German Cypher Stent Registry. RESULTS: From April 2002 until September 2005, 11 507 patients at 132 hospitals, who received at least one SES during their PCI, were included. Between 2002 and 2005, the median age of patients increased from 63 years to 66 years (p for trend &lt;0.0001), whereas the prevalence of prior coronary bypass surgery (p&lt;0.0001) and prior PCI (p&lt;0.001) significantly decreased. Initial presentation of patients was stable over time, with a small increase of patients treated for non-ST elevation myocardial infarction (p=0.05). We found a significant increase in the treatment of complex stenoses (p&lt;0.0001) as well as an increase in the proportion of chronic total occlusions (p&lt;0.01). There was a steady increase in the proportion of patients treated for de novo lesions (p&lt;0.0001), which was accompanied by a relative decrease in the proportion of patients treated for in-stent restenosis (p&lt;0.0001). Concerning interventional characteristics a significant increase in the length of SES implanted per lesion, the numbers of SES implanted per lesion as well as an increase of the proportion of patients treated for more than one stenosis during one intervention could be observed (all p&lt;0.0001). There was a significant decrease in the use of glycoprotein II b/IIIa antagonists during the PCI (2002: 26.5 to 14.2% in 2005, p&lt;0.0001). MACE rates until hospital discharge did not change significantly over time. CONCLUSIONS: Between 2002 and 2005 there were two trends in the use of SES: a) a significant increase in the use of SES for de novo lesions and b) a significant trend to use SES for longer lesions, smaller arteries, more complex lesions and more SES per lesion. In summary these findings indicate that still SES are mainly used in patients with lesions that are at high risk for restenosis.",M2
