20503597,"Effect of plant molluscicides on selected enzymes related to energy metabolism in Biomphalaria arabica snails molluscan hosts to <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in Saudi Arabia.Schistosomiasis is one of the most important human parasitic diseases. One of the possible methods for the control is through the molluscan intermediate host of the parasite. Biomphalaria arabica, molluscan hosts to Schistosoma mansoni in Saudi Arabia were treated with sublethal concentrations (LC25) of dry powdered leaves Solanum nigrum. Effect of plant on ectonucleotidases (NTPdases) (ADPase &amp; ATPase), sodium/potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase) and creatine kinase (CK) was traced. The plant molluscicide was potent in inhibiting the four investigated enzymes giving a percentage inhibition range between 45-55%. The effect of the inhibited enzymes on the compatibility of the snail hosts to schistosome parasite was discussed. In conclusion, the use of sublethal concentration of S. nigrum to disturb the biochemical profile of the snail hosts could be a promising and safe strategy to control the disease.",M1
20464131,"The effects of the experimental infection from a focus of transmission of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in a population of Biomphalaria tenagophila (D'Orbigny, 1835) in the region of  Vale do Ribeira de Iguape , Brazil.To observe the effects of the parasitic infection on the biology of B. tenagophila, field and laboratory populations of this mollusk from Itariri, in Vale do Ribeira, Brazil, were experimentally infected. Each mollusk received 10 miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni (SJ lineage) and was observed throughout the parasite's development. The biological variables were compared according to the criteria  group  and  infectious phase . The main damage caused by the parasitic infection manifested itself in reproduction, longevity and lesions on the shell of the mollusks in the patent phase. An infection rate of 58.8% was observed. Microanatomical study of the mollusk's digestive gland and ovotestis revealed the presence of evolving larval forms and cercariae. It was concluded that the effects of the parasitic infection on both populations were moderate, despite the low survival rate of the infected mollusks, the damage did not prevent either reproduction or the elimination of cercariae, which continued for a long time.",M1
20440060,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> soluble egg antigens enhance HCV replication in mammalian cells.BACKGROUND: This work demonstrates successful propagation of HCV in HepG2 and human blood cells as well as viral shedding into their culture media. The influence of Schistosoma mansoni crude soluble egg antigens (SEA) on the rate of viral propagation in both mammalian cells was also monitored. METHODOLOGY: HepG2 cells were inoculated with HCV viremic human sera and some wells were exposed to HCV infection in presence of SEA. Cells were harvested for RT-PCR and Western blotting analysis. HepG2 media was collected for HCV ELISA. Blood samples from HCV-infected humans were cultured in the presence and absence of SEA. Media were collected at different time points post culturing and subjected to HCV ELISA. RESULTS: The ELISA concentration of HCV antigens were generally higher in media of infected HepG2 cells compared to media of control cells at all time intervals post infection. Western blots showed reactivity to immunogenic peptides of different molecular weights in lysate of infected HepG2 cells that were not evidenced in uninfected cells. In presence of SEA, RT-PCR results revealed earlier detection of viral RNA in infected HepG2 cells compared to in absence of such bilharzial antigen. Also, ELISA results revealed higher levels of detected HCV antigens in media of both infected HepG2 and blood cells cocultured with S. mansoni SEA compared to that of cultured infected cells in absence of the parasite antigens. CONCLUSION: HepG2 cells as well as whole blood cultures maintain HCV replication. Furthermore, SEA has the potential to enhance HCV propagation.",M1
20170964,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> worm glycolipids induce an inflammatory phenotype in human dendritic cells by cooperation of TLR4 and DC-SIGN.In schistosomiasis, a major human parasitic disease caused by helminths, different life-stages of the parasite contribute to the developing host immune response. To increase our understanding of the mechanisms that play a role in shaping the host immune responses, we have investigated the effects of schistosome glycoconjugates on the phenotype of dendritic cells (DCs), which form a crucial link between the innate and the adaptive immunity. We show here that Schistosoma mansoni worm glycolipids induce DC activation as indicated by upregulation of the maturation markers CD80, CD86 and MHC-II, as well as the production of the cytokines interleukin-12 p40 (IL-12 p40), IL-10, IL-1beta, IL-6, IL-8 and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha). Co-culture of glycolipid-primed DCs with na√Øve T cells results in skewing of the T cell response towards a Th1 profile. Remarkably, the DC activation is dependent on fucosylated glycan moieties of the glycolipids. On the DCs, the C-type lectin DC-SIGN and TLR4 are both critically involved in the induced activation, as was demonstrated by using monoclonal antibodies that block interaction of these receptors with the glycolipids. Furthermore, whereas the worm glycolipids were not able to activate HEK 293 cells expressing TLR4, they did show TLR4 activation after introduction of DC-SIGN in the HEK 293-TLR4 cells. Our data provide evidence for a novel function of DC-SIGN as an essential co-receptor for TLR4-induced activation of human DCs. This mechanism of TLR4 activation by worm glycolipids may contribute to eliciting Th1 immune responses in schistosome infection.",M1
20169182,"The Syk kinase SmTK4 of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> is involved in the regulation of spermatogenesis and oogenesis.The signal transduction protein SmTK4 from Schistosoma mansoni belongs to the family of Syk kinases. In vertebrates, Syk kinases are known to play specialized roles in signaling pathways in cells of the hematopoietic system. Although Syk kinases were identified in some invertebrates, their role in this group of animals has not yet been elucidated. Since SmTK4 is the first Syk kinase from a parasitic helminth, shown to be predominantly expressed in the testes and ovary of adult worms, we investigated its function. To unravel signaling cascades in which SmTK4 is involved, yeast two-/three-hybrid library screenings were performed with either the tandem SH2-domain, or with the linker region including the tyrosine kinase domain of SmTK4. Besides the Src kinase SmTK3 we identified a new Src kinase (SmTK6) acting upstream of SmTK4 and a MAPK-activating protein, as well as mapmodulin acting downstream. Their identities and colocalization studies pointed to a role of SmTK4 in a signaling cascade regulating the proliferation and/or differentiation of cells in the gonads of schistosomes. To confirm this decisive role we performed biochemical and molecular approaches to knock down SmTK4 combined with a novel protocol for confocal laser scanning microscopy for morphological analyses. Using the Syk kinase-specific inhibitor Piceatannol or by RNAi treatment of adult schistosomes in vitro, corresponding phenotypes were detected in the testes and ovary. In the Xenopus oocyte system it was finally confirmed that Piceatannol suppressed the activity of the catalytic kinase domain of SmTK4. Our findings demonstrate a pivotal role of SmTK4 in gametogenesis, a new function for Syk kinases in eukaryotes.",M1
20163751,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>: signal transduction processes during the development of the reproductive organs.Among the topics of considerable interest concerning our understanding of the unusual biology of schistosomes is the sexual maturation of the female. The identification of genes coding for signal transduction proteins controlling essential steps of the pairing-dependent differentiation of the reproductive organs, vitellarium and ovary will help to substantiate our knowledge about this unique parasite. Furthermore, such signalling proteins could be potential targets to interfere with the development of this parasite to combat schistosomiasis since its pathology is caused by the eggs. This review summarises first post-genomic steps to elucidate the function of gonad-specific signalling molecules which were identified by homology-based cloning strategies, by in silico identification or by yeast two-hybrid interaction analyses, using a combination of novel techniques. These include the in vitro culture of adult schistosomes, their treatment with chemical inhibitors to block enzyme activity, the use of RNAi to silence gene function post-transcriptionally, and confocal laser scanning microscopy to study the morphological consequences of these experimental approaches. Finally, we propose a first model of protein networks that are active in the ovary regulating mitogenic activity and differentiation. Some of these molecules are also active in the testes of males, probably fulfilling similar roles as in the ovary.",M1
20161728,"Transcriptional changes in <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> during early schistosomula development and in the presence of erythrocytes.BACKGROUND: Schistosomes cause more mortality and morbidity than any other human helminth, but control primarily relies on a single drug that kills adult worms. The newly transformed schistosomulum stage is susceptible to the immune response and is a target for vaccine development and rational drug design. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: To identify genes which are up-regulated during the maturation of Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula in vitro, we cultured newly transformed parasites for 3 h or 5 days with and without erythrocytes and compared their transcriptional profiles using cDNA microarrays. The most apparent changes were in the up-regulation of genes between 3 h and 5 day schistosomula involved in blood feeding, tegument and cytoskeletal development, cell adhesion, and stress responses. The most highly up-regulated genes included a tegument tetraspanin Sm-tsp-3 (1,600-fold up-regulation), a protein kinase, a novel serine protease and serine protease inhibitor, and intestinal proteases belonging to distinct mechanistic classes. The inclusion of erythrocytes in the culture medium resulted in a general but less pronounced increase in transcriptional activity, with the highest up-regulation of genes involved in iron metabolism, proteolysis, and transport of fatty acids and sugars. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified the genes that are up-regulated during the first 5 days of schistosomula development in vitro. Using a combination of gene silencing techniques and murine protection studies, some of these highly up-regulated transcripts can be targeted for future development of new vaccines and drugs.",M1
20158148,"Schistosomicidal evaluation of Zanthoxylum naranjillo and its isolated compounds against <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> adult worms.Chemical investigation of the EtOAc fraction (EF) obtained from the ethanolic extract of Zanthoxylum naranjillo (Rutaceae) leaves (EE) by preparative HPLC resulted in the isolation of protocatechuic acid (1), gallic acid (2), p-hydroxybenzoic acid (3), and 5-O-caffeoylshikimic acid (4). This is the first time that the presence of compounds 1-4 in Z. naranjillo has been reported. Compounds 1-4, the EE, and EF were tested in vitro against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. The results showed that the S. mansoni daily egg production decreased by 29.8%, 13.5%, 28.4%, 17.7%, 16.3%, and 6.4%, respectively. Compounds 1 and 3 were also able to separate adult worm pairs into male and female. This activity may be correlated with the reduction in egg production, since 1 and 3 showed better inhibitory properties compared with 2 and 4.",M1
20149792,"Imatinib has a fatal impact on morphology, pairing stability and survival of adult <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in vitro.Schistosomes cause bilharzia (schistosomiasis), one of the most prevalent parasitic diseases for human and animals worldwide. Praziquantel (PZQ) is the only widely used drug for treatment and control of this parasitemia. Since a vaccine is not yet available, and in light of emerging resistance against PZQ, the search for alternatives has high priority. Here we present that Imatinib, a compound used in human cancer therapy (Gleevec; STI-571), significantly affected schistosome morphology and physiology in vitro. Besides its negative effect on gonad development and pairing stability, Imatinib led to pathological alterations of the gastrodermis, which finally caused the death of the parasite.",M1
20135718,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> proteins attenuate gastrointestinal motility disturbances during experimental colitis in mice.AIM: To investigate the therapeutic effect of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) soluble worm proteins on gastrointestinal motility disturbances during experimental colitis in mice. METHODS: Colitis was induced by intrarectal injection of trinitrobenzene sulphate (TNBS) and 6 h later, mice were treated ip with S. mansoni proteins. Experiments were performed 5 d after TNBS injection. Inflammation was quantified using validated inflammation parameters. Gastric emptying and geometric center were measured to assess in vivo gastrointestinal motility. Peristaltic activity of distal colonic segments was studied in vitro using a modified Trendelenburg set-up. Cytokine profiles of T-lymphocytes isolated from the colon were determined by real time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Intracolonic injection of TNBS caused severe colitis. Treatment with S. mansoni proteins significantly ameliorated colonic inflammation after 5 d. TNBS did not affect gastric emptying but significantly decreased the geometric center and impaired colonic peristaltic activity 5 d after the induction of colitis. Treatment with S. mansoni proteins ameliorated these in vivo and in vitro motility disturbances. In addition, TNBS injection caused a downregulation of effector T cell cytokines after 5 d, whereas a S. mansoni protein effect was no longer observed at this time point. CONCLUSION: Treatment with S. mansoni proteins attenuated intestinal inflammation and ameliorated motility disturbances during murine experimental colitis.",M1
20129792,"Structural basis for selective inhibition of purine nucleoside phosphorylase from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>: kinetic and structural studies.Selectivity plays a crucial role in the design of enzyme inhibitors as novel antiparasitic agents, particularly in cases where the target enzyme is also present in the human host. Purine nucleoside phosphorylase from Schistosoma mansoni (SmPNP) is an attractive target for the discovery of potential antischistosomal agents. In the present work, kinetic studies were carried out in order to determine the inhibitory potency, mode of action and enzyme selectivity of a series of inhibitors of SmPNP. In addition, crystallographic studies provided important structural insights for rational inhibitor design, revealing consistent structural differences in the binding mode of the inhibitors in the active sites of the SmPNP and human PNP (HsPNP) structures. The molecular information gathered in this work should be useful for future medicinal chemistry efforts in the design of new inhibitors of SmPNP having increased affinity and selectivity.",M1
20126309,"Electroporation facilitates introduction of reporter transgenes and virions into schistosome eggs.BACKGROUND: The schistosome egg represents an attractive developmental stage at which to target transgenes because of the high ratio of germ to somatic cells, because the transgene might be propagated and amplified by infecting snails with the miracidia hatched from treated eggs, and because eggs can be readily obtained from experimentally infected rodents. METHODS/FINDINGS: We investigated the utility of square wave electroporation to deliver transgenes and other macromolecules including fluorescent (Cy3) short interference (si) RNA molecules, messenger RNAs, and virions into eggs of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>. First, eggs were incubated in Cy3-labeled siRNA with and without square wave electroporation. Cy3-signals were detected by fluorescence microscopy in eggs and miracidia hatched from treated eggs. Second, electroporation was employed to introduce mRNA encoding firefly luciferase into eggs. Luciferase activity was detected three hours later, whereas luciferase was not evident in eggs soaked in the mRNA. Third, schistosome eggs were exposed to Moloney murine leukemia virus virions (MLV) pseudotyped with vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG). Proviral transgenes were detected by PCR in genomic DNA from miracidia hatched from virion-exposed eggs, indicating the presence of transgenes in larval schistosomes that had been either soaked or electroporated. However, quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis determined that electroporation of virions resulted in 2-3 times as many copies of provirus in these schistosomes compared to soaking alone. In addition, relative qPCR indicated a copy number for the proviral luciferase transgene of approximately 20 copies for 100 copies of a representative single copy endogenous gene (encoding cathepsin D). CONCLUSIONS: Square wave electroporation facilitates introduction of transgenes into the schistosome egg. Electroporation was more effective for the transduction of eggs with pseudotyped MLV than simply soaking the eggs in virions. These findings underscore the potential of targeting the schistosome egg for germ line transgenesis.",M1
20096907,"Development of a new assay for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis, using cercarial antigens.We have developed a new ELISA for detection of anti-schistosome antibodies using an extract from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> cercariae. We evaluated the new assay on serum samples sent to the Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Department of Clinical Parasitology, London, UK, by comparing it with our routinely used S. mansoni soluble egg antigen (SEA) assay. We also evaluated the new assay for cross-reactivity with a number of helminth and other infections. We demonstrate that the cercarial antigen assay is equivalent to the SEA assay for serodiagnosis of schistosomiasis in a non-endemic setting. The cercarial antigen preparation is more easily produced than SEA, and for this reason this assay may be preferred for routine clinical use and may be amenable to scaling up. Further assessment is needed before it can be recommended for use in an endemic area, as chronic disease and co-infection with other helminths are likely to be under-represented in our sample set.",M1
20067790,"Effect of amphotericin B on the infection success of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in Biomphalaria glabrata.In the present study, we examined the effect of amphotericin B on larval stages (miracidia and primary sporocyst) of the helminth Schistosoma mansoni, the causative agent of human schistosomiasis. Amphotericin B (AmB) is a polyene macrolide that disturbs the function of the cell membrane; it is widely used as prophylactic antimycotic agent in in vitro culture. We show for the first time that S. mansoni miracidia infectivity is considerably reduced after AmB treatment. Moreover we demonstrate that AmB does not affect the development, growth, viability, and behavior of miracidia and primary sporocysts. Our data indicate that AmB effects on S. mansoni sporocyst prevalence are linked to the oxidative properties of AmB. These may alter the capacity of sporocysts to respond to the oxidative stress generated by the snail immune defence system.",M1
20065004,"Activity of artemether and mefloquine against juvenile and adult <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in athymic and immunocompetent NMRI mice.Immune effector mechanisms can enhance the activity of antischistosomal drugs. We examined the in vivo effect of single oral doses of the antimalarials artemether (400 mg/kg) and mefloquine (200 mg/kg), recently described to have promising antischistosomal properties, against juvenile and adult Schistosoma mansoni in T cell-deficient and in comparably infected age- and sex-matched immunologically intact control mice. Artemether and mefloquine are equally effective in athymic and immunocompetent mice. Artemether treatment resulted in total and female worm burden reductions ranging between 71.1% and 85.3%, whereas mefloquine achieved total and female worm burden reductions of 80.4-97.8%. In conclusion, artemether and mefloquine act T-cell independently and no synergistic interaction with the immune response was involved.",M1
20060828,"The identification of inhibitors of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> miracidial transformation by incorporating a medium-throughput small-molecule screen.In Schistosoma mansoni, the miracidium-to-primary sporocyst transformation process is associated with many physiological, morphological, transcriptional and biochemical changes. In the present study, we use a medium-throughput small-molecule screen to identify chemical compounds inhibiting or delaying the in vitro transformation of miracidia to the sporocyst stage. The Sigma-Aldrich Library of Pharmacologically Active Compounds (LOPAC) contains 1280 well-characterized chemical compounds with various modes of action including enzyme inhibitors, antibiotics, cell-cycle regulators, apoptosis inducers and GPCR ligands. We identified 47 compounds that greatly reduce or delay this transformation process during a primary screen of live miracidia. The majority of compounds inhibiting larval transformation were from dopaminergic, serotonergic, ion channel and phosphorylation classes. Specifically, we found that dopamine D2-type antagonists, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, voltage-gated calcium channel antagonists and a PKC activator significantly reduced in vitro miracidial transformation rates. Many of the targets of these compounds regulate adenylyl cyclase activity, with the inhibition or activation of these targets resulting in increased cAMP levels in miracidia and concomitant blocking/delaying of larval transformation.",M1
20057051,"Adenosine binding to low-molecular-weight purine nucleoside phosphorylase: the structural basis for recognition based on its complex with the enzyme from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Schistosomes are unable to synthesize purines de novo and depend exclusively on the salvage pathway for their purine requirements. It has been suggested that blockage of this pathway could lead to parasite death. The enzyme purine nucleoside phosphorylase (PNP) is one of its key components and molecules designed to inhibit the low-molecular-weight (LMW) PNPs, which include both the human and schistosome enzymes, are typically analogues of the natural substrates inosine and guanosine. Here, it is shown that adenosine both binds to Schistosoma mansoni PNP and behaves as a weak micromolar inhibitor of inosine phosphorolysis. Furthermore, the first crystal structures of complexes of an LMW PNP with adenosine and adenine are reported, together with those with inosine and hypoxanthine. These are used to propose a structural explanation for the selective binding of adenosine to some LMW PNPs but not to others. The results indicate that transition-state analogues based on adenosine or other 6-amino nucleosides should not be discounted as potential starting points for alternative inhibitors.",M1
20025653,"Low genetic diversity in a snail intermediate host (Biomphalaria pfeifferi Krass, 1848) and schistosomiasis transmission in the Senegal River Basin.Population genetic perturbations of intermediate hosts, often a consequence of human pressure on environmental resources, can precipitate unexpectedly severe disease outbreaks. Such disturbances are set to become increasingly common following range changes concomitant with climate shifts, dwindling natural resources and major infrastructure changes such as hydroprojects. Construction of the Diama dam in the Senegal River Basin (SRB) reduced river salinity, enabling the freshwater snail intermediate host Biomphalaria pfeifferi to rapidly expand its distribution. A serious public health problem ensued, with an epidemic of intestinal schistosomiasis occurring in the previously schistosome-free Richard-Toll region within 2 years. The current study aimed to assess the population variability of B. pfeifferi in the SRB, and speculate upon its subsequent impact on host-parasite interactions following such engineered ecological change. Genetic variation at nine polymorphic microsatellite loci revealed little population differentiation in SRB snails compared with those from natural habitats in Zimbabwe, where <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> transmission is much lower. 'Open' SRB habitats are associated with greater water contact, smaller population sizes and less genetic diversity, with sites downstream of Richard-Toll showing greater inter- and intrapopulation variation, concomitant with less frequent human contact. These observations may be explained by rapid expansion into pristine habitat selecting for high fecundity genotypes at the expense of schistosome resistance, presenting S. mansoni with genetically homogenous highly fecund susceptible populations around the focal point, promoting development of a highly compatible host-parasite relationship. Longitudinal study of such systems may prove important in predicting public health risks engendered by future environmental engineering projects.",M1
20018191,"Bursts of transposition from non-long terminal repeat retrotransposon families of the RTE clade in <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.The genus Schistosoma is composed of blood flukes that infect vertebrates, from which three species are major causative agents of human schistosomiasis, a tropical disease that affects more than 200 million people. Current models of the recent evolution of Schistosoma indicate multiple events of migration and speciation from an Asian ancestral species. Transposable elements are important drivers of genome evolution and have been hypothesised to have an important role in speciation. In this work, we describe a comprehensive inventory of Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum retrotransposons, based on their recently published genomic data. We find a considerable difference in retrotransposon representation between the two species (22% and 13%, respectively). A large part of this difference can be attributed to higher representation of two previously described families of S. mansoni retrotransposons (SR2 and Perere-3/SR3), compared with the representation of their closest relative families in S. japonicum. A more detailed analysis suggests that these two S. mansoni families were the subject of recent bursts of transposition that were not paralleled by their S. japonicum counterparts. We hypothesise that these bursts could be a consequence of the evolutionary pressure resulting from migration of Schistosoma from Asia to Africa and their establishment in this new environment, helping both speciation and adaptation.",M1
20007528,"Pronounced phenotype in activated regulatory T cells during a chronic helminth infection.Although several markers have been associated with the characterization of regulatory T cells (Tregs) and their function, no studies have investigated the dynamics of their phenotype during infection. Since the necessity of Tregs to control immunopathology has been demonstrated, we used the chronic helminth infection model <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> to address the impact on the Treg gene repertoire. Before gene expression profiling, we first studied the localization and Ag-specific suppressive nature of classically defined Tregs during infection. The presence of Foxp3+ cells was predominantly found in the periphery of granulomas and isolated CD4+CD25(hi)Foxp3+ Tregs from infected mice and blocked IFN-gamma and IL-10 cytokine secretion from infected CD4+CD25- effector T cells. Furthermore, the gene expression patterns of Tregs and effector T cells showed that 474 genes were significantly regulated during schistosomiasis. After k-means clustering, we identified genes exclusively regulated in all four populations, including Foxp3, CD103, GITR, OX40, and CTLA-4--classic Treg markers. During infection, however, several nonclassical genes were upregulated solely within the Treg population, such as Slpi, Gzmb, Mt1, Fabp5, Nfil3, Socs2, Gpr177, and Klrg1. Using RT-PCR, we confirmed aspects of the microarray data and also showed that the expression profile of Tregs from S. mansoni-infected mice is simultaneously unique and comparable with Tregs derived from other infections.",M1

One mollusk or a sample of a snail conditioning water (SCW) was placed in one of the chambers, randomly selected, and the remaining of the apparatus was filled with chlorine-free water. Ten miracidia were placed in the centre of the channel and their behaviour was observed for 15 minutes. Ten replicates were made for each treatment (snail or SCW), using different specimens of mollusks or different samples of SCW. Mollusks infected with A. costaricensis attracted significantly less S. mansoni miracidia than non-infected B. glabrata. In addition, miracidia were also significantly more attracted to SCW from mollusks infected with A. costaricensis.",M1
19965814,"Pulmonary vascular remodeling correlates with lung eggs and cytokines in murine schistosomiasis.RATIONALE: Schistosomiasis is considered to be the most common worldwide cause of pulmonary hypertension. At present there is no well-characterized animal model to study the pathobiology of this important condition. OBJECTIVES: To develop a mouse model of schistosomiasis, characterize the extent of pulmonary vascular remodeling, and determine the potential role of inflammatory cytokines. METHODS: Mice (C57/Bl6) were infected transcutaneously with a high dose (approximately 75-100 cercariae) or a low dose (approximately 30 cercariae) of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>, and the development of lung and liver pathology was studied in the subacute (high-dose) and chronic (low-dose) settings. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In the subacute setting, mice showed few eggs in the lungs and no evidence of pulmonary vascular remodeling. In contrast, chronically infected animals had a much greater lung egg burden and developed marked pulmonary vascular remodeling accompanied by perivascular inflammation from 12 weeks onwards. In addition, we observed the presence of plexiform-like lesions in these mice. Lung egg burden correlated with both liver egg burden and right ventricular (RV) index in the chronic group, although significant RV hypertrophy was lacking. Plasma Th1 and Th2 cytokines increased with time in the chronic group and correlated with the degree of pulmonary vascular remodeling. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence for extensive pulmonary vascular remodeling, despite the absence of RV hypertrophy, in a mouse model of schistosomiasis, including the formation of plexiform-like lesions. Inflammatory cytokines and lung egg burden may contribute to vascular lesion formation.",M1
19962194,"Differential transcriptomic responses of Biomphalaria glabrata (Gastropoda, Mollusca) to bacteria and metazoan parasites, <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and Echinostoma paraensei (Digenea, Platyhelminthes).A 70-mer-oligonucleotide-based microarray (1152 features) that emphasizes stress and immune responses factors was constructed to study transcriptomic responses of the snail Biomphalaria glabrata to different immune challenges. In addition to sequences with relevant putative ID and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation, the array features non-immune factors and unknown B. glabrata ESTs for functional gene discovery. The transcription profiles of B. glabrata (3 biological replicates, each a pool of 5 snails) were recorded at 12h post-wounding, exposure to Gram negative or Gram positive bacteria (Escherichia coli and Micrococcus luteus, respectively), or infection with compatible trematode parasites (Schistosoma mansoni or Echinostoma paraensei, 20 miracidia/snail), relative to controls, using universal reference RNA. The data were subjected to Significance Analysis for Microarrays (SAM), with a false positive rate (FPR) &lt;or=10%. Wounding yielded a modest differential expression profile (27 up/21 down) with affected features mostly dissimilar from other treatments. Partially overlapping, yet distinct expression profiles were recorded from snails challenged with E. coli (83 up/20 down) or M. luteus (120 up/42 down), mostly showing up-regulation of defense and stress-related features. Significantly altered expression of selected immune features indicates that B. glabrata detects and responds differently to compatible trematodes. Echinostoma paraensei infection was associated mostly with down-regulation of many (immune-) transcripts (42 up/68 down), whereas S. mansoni exposure yielded a preponderance of up-regulated features (140 up/23 down), with only few known immune genes affected. These observations may reflect the divergent strategies developed by trematodes during their evolution as specialized pathogens of snails to negate host defense responses. Clearly, the immune defenses of B. glabrata distinguish and respond differently to various immune challenges.",M1
19930563,"Role of lysophosphatidic acid receptor LPA2 in the development of allergic airway inflammation in a murine model of asthma.BACKGROUND: Lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) plays a critical role in airway inflammation through G protein-coupled LPA receptors (LPA1-3). We have demonstrated that LPA induced cytokine and lipid mediator release in human bronchial epithelial cells. Here we provide evidence for the role of LPA and LPA receptors in Th2-dominant airway inflammation. METHODS: Wild type, LPA1 heterozygous knockout mice (LPA1+/-), and LPA2 heterozygous knockout mice (LPA2+/-) were sensitized with inactivated <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> eggs and local antigenic challenge with Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg Ag (SEA) in the lungs. Bronchoalveolar larvage (BAL) fluids and lung tissues were collected for analysis of inflammatory responses. Further, tracheal epithelial cells were isolated and challenged with LPA. RESULTS: BAL fluids from Schistosoma mansoni egg-sensitized and challenged wild type mice (4 days of challenge) showed increase of LPA level (approximately 2.8 fold), compared to control mice. LPA2+/- mice, but not LPA1+/- mice, exposed to Schistosoma mansoni egg revealed significantly reduced cell numbers and eosinophils in BAL fluids, compared to challenged wild type mice. Both LPA2+/- and LPA1+/- mice showed decreases in bronchial goblet cells. LPA2+/- mice, but not LPA1+/- mice showed the decreases in prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and LPA levels in BAL fluids after SEA challenge. The PGE2 production by LPA was reduced in isolated tracheal epithelial cells from LPA2+/- mice. These results suggest that LPA and LPA receptors are involved in Schistosoma mansoni egg-mediated inflammation and further studies are proposed to understand the role of LPA and LPA receptors in the inflammatory process.",M1
19917288,"A comparative proteomic study of the undeveloped and developed <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> egg and its contents: the miracidium, hatch fluid and secretions.The schistosome egg is the key agent responsible both for transmission of the parasite from human to molluscan host, and is the primary cause of pathogenesis in schistosomiasis. Characterisation of its proteome is a crucial step in understanding the egg's interactions with the mammalian host. We devised a scheme to isolate undeveloped eggs from mature schistosome eggs by Percoll gradient and then fractionate the mature egg into miracidial, hatch fluid and secreted protein preparations. The soluble proteins contained within the five preparations were separated by two-dimensional electrophoresis and their spot patterns compared by image analysis. Large numbers of representative spots were then excised and subjected to tandem mass spectrometry to obtain identities. In this way, the principal components of each sub-proteome were established. Chaperones were the most abundant category, with heat shock protein 70 (HSP70) dominant in the undeveloped egg and Schistosoma mansoni protein 40 (Smp-40) in the miracidium. Cytoskeletal proteins were expressed at similar levels in the undeveloped egg and miracidium, with tubulins the most abundant. The proteins of energy metabolism reflected the change from anaerobic to aerobic metabolism as the miracidium developed. None of the above categories was abundant in the hatch fluid but this peri-miracidial compartment was highly enriched for defence proteins such as thioredoxin. Hatch fluid also contained several host proteins and schistosome proteins of unknown function, highlighting its distinct nature and potentially its role. The egg secretions could not be compared with the other preparations due to their unique composition featuring the previously characterised IL-4-inducing principal of S. mansoni eggs (IPSE), Omega-1, egg secreted protein 15 (ESP15), a micro-exon gene 2 (MEG-2) protein and two members of the recently described MEG-3 family. This last preparation contains the subset of egg proteins that probably enables eggs to escape from host tissues and may also initiate granuloma formation, emphasising the need to establish fully the roles of its components in schistosome biology.",M1
19914302,"Biolistic transformation of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>: Studies with modified reporter-gene constructs containing regulatory regions of protease genes.Biolistics of the flatworm parasite Schistosoma mansoni facilitates the accurate spatial expression of transgenes under the control of gene-specific promoter elements. To improve transgene expression, either in the number of positive worms and/or an increased transgene signal per worm, we tested plasmid constructs incorporating 5' and 3' gene-specific genomic fragments, and parts of the open reading frame for two S. mansoni proteases, cathepsins F and D (SmCF and SmCD). GFP-expression was gut-localized, a novel finding for SmCD and consistent with previous data for SmCF. The mCherry fluorescent protein can also operate as a reporter. Though certain constructs imparted stronger and better distributed signals per positive worm, the low yields throughout (1-5% positive per experiment) precluded further quantifications of improvement. Electroporation of the same constructs was also weakly efficient (1-10% positives per experiment). However, reporter signals were found in tissues other than the gut, which may represent dysregulated transcription.",M1
19898869,"In vitro schistosomicidal effects of some phloroglucinol derivatives from Dryopteris species against <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> adult worms.The rhizomes of Dryopteris species have popularly been used as vermifuge in flatworm infections. The aim of this work was to evaluate the in vitro schistosomicidal activity of some phloroglucinol compounds, obtained from the rhizomes of Dryopteris species, against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. All worm pairs were dead after 24 h of incubation with aspidin 25 to 100 microM (1), flavaspidic acid 50 and 100 microM (2), methylene-bis-aspidinol 100 microM (3), and desaspidin 25 to 100 microM (4). Worms incubated with 1 (25 to 100 microM) and 2 (50 to 100 microM) showed decrease motor activity with tegumental alterations, while 3 (100 microM) and 4 (10 to 100 microM) showed decrease motor activity without tegumental alterations. Desaspidinol (5) and filicinic acid (6), at the tested concentrations (10 to 100 microM), did not show activity against adult worms of S. mansoni. Praziquantel (10 microM), used as positive control, caused death of the parasites and tegumental alterations without separation of worms. In the groups treated with 100 microM of compounds 1-4, the viability of the adult worms was similar to the positive control group, in which the worms were dead. Also, both the egg productions and the development of eggs produced by the adult worms were inhibited by the incubation with compounds 1-4 (10 and 100 microM) in comparison with the negative control (RPMI 1640 medium). It is suggested that the in vitro schistosomicidal effects of phloroglucinols derivatives 1, 2, 3, and 4 may be related to the inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation pathway in S. mansoni. The present results confirmed the traditional indications of rhizomes from Dryopteris species, which possess phloroglucinol compounds, in the treatment of tapeworm infections.",M1

Structure-activity relationships (SARs) were determined for a set of 41 aza-peptide Michael acceptors and eight aza-peptide epoxides. Both enzymes prefer disubstituted amides to monosubstituted amides in the P1' position, and potency increased as we increased the hydrophobicity of the inhibitor in this position. Extending the inhibitor to P5 resulted in increased potency, especially against IrAE, and both enzymes prefer small over large hydrophobic residues at P2. Aza-peptide Michael acceptor inhibitors are more potent than aza-peptide epoxide inhibitors, and for some of these compounds, second-order inhibiton rate constants are the fastest yet discovered. Given the central functions of these enzymes in both parasites, the data presented here may facilitate the eventual design of selective antiparasitic drugs.",M1
19825105,"Schistosomiasis and liver fibrosis.<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection invariably results in liver fibrosis of the host. This fibrosis may be represented by small focal areas of chronic inflammation and excess extracellular matrix deposited in periovular granulomas, distributed in variable numbers at the periphery of the portal vein system. This is the outcome of 90% of the infected population in endemic areas. Conversely, a minority of infected individuals develop extensive disease with numerous granulomas along the entire extension of the portal spaces. This latter situation is mainly dependent on special hemodynamic changes created by a heavy worm load, with the subsequent production of numerous eggs and represents a severe form of a peculiar chronic hepatopathy. Thus, host-parasite interactions in schistosomiasis help us to understand a number of important features of liver fibrosis: its initiation and regulation, the significance of accompanying vascular changes, the dynamics of fibrosis formation and regression with antiparasitic treatment; host genetic and immunological contributions, and the pathophysiology of portal hypertension.",M1

The specimens were collected in 15 localities in 12 municipalities of the southern region of the state of Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil. The following species were found and identified: Biomphalaria tenagophila guaibensis, Biomphalaria oligoza and Biomphalaria peregrina.

19815034,"Identification of immediate response genes dominantly expressed in juvenile resistant and susceptible Biomphalaria glabrata snails upon exposure to <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Resistance or susceptibility of the snail host Biomphalaria glabrata to Schistosoma mansoni is determined by the genetics of both the snail and parasite. Although Mendelian genetics governs adult resistance to infection, juvenile resistance and susceptibility are complex traits. In this study, suppression subtractive hybridization was used to construct forward and reverse cDNA libraries to identify genes involved in the immediate response of juvenile resistant (BS-90), non-susceptible (LAC2) snails, and susceptible (NMRI) snails after early exposure to S. mansoni. Expressed Sequence Tags (ESTs) were generated from the repertoire of enriched transcripts. In resistant snails, several ESTs corresponded to transcripts involved in immune regulation/defense response. While no defense related transcripts were found among juvenile susceptible snail ESTs, we detected transcripts involved in negative regulation of biological process/morphogenesis/proliferation. Differential gene expression and temporal regulation of representative transcripts were compared among snails pre- and post-exposure to either normal or attenuated miracidia using quantitative real time RT-PCR. Results showed that several transcripts, such as fibrinolytic C terminal domain, cytidine deaminase, macrophage expressed gene 1, protein kinase C receptor, anti-microbial peptide; theromacin and Fas remained up-regulated regardless of whether or not snails were exposed to normal or attenuated miracidia. While ESTs related to C-type lectin and low-density lipoprotein receptor were induced only by exposure to normal miracidia. By comparing changes in gene expression between resistant and susceptible juvenile snails responding either to normal or attenuated parasites, we can conclude that the transcription of genes associated with the intra-dermal penetration process of the snail host by invading miracidia may need to be taken into account when assessing differential gene expression between resistant and susceptible strains of B.glabrata in relation to S. mansoni exposure.",M1
19814823,"Homology-based annotation of non-coding RNAs in the genomes of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and Schistosoma japonicum.BACKGROUND: Schistosomes are trematode parasites of the phylum Platyhelminthes. They are considered the most important of the human helminth parasites in terms of morbidity and mortality. Draft genome sequences are now available for Schistosoma mansoni and Schistosoma japonicum. Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) plays a crucial role in gene expression regulation, cellular function and defense, homeostasis, and pathogenesis. The genome-wide annotation of ncRNAs is a non-trivial task unless well-annotated genomes of closely related species are already available. RESULTS: A homology search for structured ncRNA in the genome of S. mansoni resulted in 23 types of ncRNAs with conserved primary and secondary structure. Among these, we identified rRNA, snRNA, SL RNA, SRP, tRNAs and RNase P, and also possibly MRP and 7SK RNAs. In addition, we confirmed five miRNAs that have recently been reported in S. japonicum and found two additional homologs of known miRNAs. The tRNA complement of S. mansoni is comparable to that of the free-living planarian Schmidtea mediterranea, although for some amino acids differences of more than a factor of two are observed: Leu, Ser, and His are overrepresented, while Cys, Meth, and Ile are underrepresented in S. mansoni. On the other hand, the number of tRNAs in the genome of S. japonicum is reduced by more than a factor of four. Both schistosomes have a complete set of minor spliceosomal snRNAs. Several ncRNAs that are expected to exist in the S. mansoni genome were not found, among them the telomerase RNA, vault RNAs, and Y RNAs. CONCLUSION: The ncRNA sequences and structures presented here represent the most complete dataset of ncRNA from any lophotrochozoan reported so far. This data set provides an important reference for further analysis of the genomes of schistosomes and indeed eukaryotic genomes at large.",M1
19797157,"Toll-like receptor 9 activation is a key mechanism for the maintenance of chronic lung inflammation.RATIONALE: Accumulating evidence supports the hypothesis that the continuous host response to a persistent challenge can polarize the cytokine environment toward a Th2 cytokine phenotype, but the mechanisms responsible for this skewing are not clear. OBJECTIVES: We investigated the role of Toll-like receptor 9 (TLR9) in a Th2-driven pulmonary granulomatous response initiated via the embolization of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> eggs to the lungs of mice. METHODS: Mice were intravenously injected with S. mansoni eggs. Histological and flow cytometric analysis, cytokine measurement, adoptive transfer of bone marrow (BM)-derived dendritic cells (DCs), and in vitro T-cell treatments with antigen-presenting cells were examined. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: In comparison to wild-type mice, TLR9(-/-) mice showed increased pulmonary granuloma size, augmented collagen deposition, increased Th2 cytokine phenotype, and impaired accumulation of DCs. BM-derived DCs, but not macrophages, recovered from animals with developed Th2-type lung granulomas promoted the production of type 2 cytokines from CD4(+) T cells. BM-derived DCs from TLR9(-/-) mice induced impaired Th1 cytokine and enhanced Th2 cytokine production by T cells, compared with DCs from WT mice. Macrophages from TLR9(-/-) mice expressed a significantly higher alternatively activated (M2) phenotype characterized by increased  found in inflammatory zone-1  (FIZZ1) and arginase-1 expression. The adoptive transfer of BM-derived DCs from syngeneic WT mice into TLR9(-/-) mice restored the granuloma phenotype seen in WT mice. CONCLUSIONS: These studies suggest that TLR9 plays an important mechanistic role in the maintenance of the pulmonary granulomatous response.",M1
19765348,"Culture for genetic manipulation of developmental stages of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Genomes of the major human helminth parasites, and indeed many others of agricultural significance, are now the research focus of intensive genome sequencing and annotation. A draft genome sequence of the filarial parasite Brugia malayi was reported in 2007 and draft genomes of two of the human schistosomes, Schistosoma japonicum and S. mansoni reported in 2009. These genome data provide the basis for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in schistosome nutrition and metabolism, host-dependent development and maturation, immune evasion and invertebrate evolution. In addition, new potential vaccine candidates and drug targets will likely be predicted. However, testing these predictions is often not straightforward with schistosomes because of the difficulty and expense in maintenance of the developmental cycle. To facilitate this goal, several developmental stages can be maintained in vitro for shorter or longer intervals of time, and these are amenable to manipulation. Our research interests focus on experimental studies of schistosome gene functions, and more recently have focused on development of transgenesis and RNA interference with the longer term aim of heritable gene manipulation. Here we review methods to isolate and culture developmental stages of Schistosoma mansoni, including eggs, sporocysts, schistosomules and adults, in particular as these procedures relate to approaches for gene manipulation. We also discuss recent advances in genetic manipulation of schistosomes including the deployment of square wave electroporation to introduce reporter genes into cultured schistosomes.",M1
19765323,"Susceptibility to praziquantel of male and female cercariae of praziquantel-resistant and susceptible isolates of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Praziquantel (PZQ) is now widely used for the treatment of human schistosomiasis. However, in recent years, there has been a growing concern about the resistance of Schistosoma to PZQ. The mechanisms of PZQ action against Schistosoma and resistance of Schistosoma to PZQ are poorly understood. Here, we report differential susceptibilities to PZQ between male and female cercariae in the PZQ-susceptible and PZQ-resistant isolates of Schistosoma mansoni, using tail loss as a measurement of PZQ action. The miracidia were collected by hatching eggs collected from faeces of infected mice. Single-sex cercaria lines were made by infecting a single Biomphalaria glabrata snail with a single miracidium. The sex of each single-sex cercaria line was identified by a direct W1-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique. Single-sex cercariae of two isolates were exposed to four different concentrations of PZQ, respectively. The tail shedding of cercariae was observed under a dissecting microscope for five time points up to 100 min after adding PZQ. The results showed that male cercariae have higher tail-shedding rates than that of female cercariae when PZQ-susceptible isolates of S. mansoni are exposed to the same concentration of PZQ. But this phenomenon was not observed in the PZQ-resistant isolates. This sexual differential resistance phenomenon of S. mansoni suggests that resistance to PZQ is induced by decreasing the PZQ susceptibility of male worms. The experiment described here may also be useful for developing tests to detect PZQ resistance in the field.",M1

METHODOLOGY: The schistosomal antigens used were cercarial antigen preparation (CAP), soluble worm antigen preparation (SWAP), and soluble egg antigen (SEA). Four groups each of 3 mice received 2 intraperotineal immunizations with the above-mentioned antigens at a two-week interval. The dose of the ECA was 20 microg/100 microl PBS/mouse and that of any of the used schistosomal antigens was 50 microg/100 microl PBS/mouse. IgM and IgG reactivities and cross-reactivities were tested in individual immunized mice sera (IMS) against the above-mentioned antigens by ELISA and Western blotting. The changes in the B, CD4+ and CD8+ -T cells' counts post immunization were recorded. RESULTS: Priming with ECA caused significant increases in IgM (P&lt;0.05) against CAP and SWAP, while both priming and boosting with ECA caused a significant elevation in the IgG only against SWAP. Priming and boosting with ECA or schistosomal antigens caused significant increases in IgM against ECA. Priming with ECA or SWAP caused significant elevation in IgG against ECA. In Western blotting, ECA-IMS recognized 16, 33, 38 and 94 kDa ECA peptides that cross-reacted with CAP-IMS. ECA peptides at 30 and 38 kDa cross-reacted among ECA, SWAP and SEA-IMS. CAP peptides at 40, 71, 85 and 97 kDa cross-reacted with ECA-IMS. A 59 kDa SWAP peptide cross-reacted with ECA. SEA peptides at approximately 55, 96 and 101 kDa cross-reacted with ECA-IMS. Immunization with ECA, CAP, SWAP or SEA caused significant increases in mesentric lymph nodes (MLN)-CD4+, CD8+ -T cells and MLN-B cells. For thymocytes, CD4+ -T cells significantly increased upon immunization with ECA and SWAP while CD8+-T cells significantly increased upon immunization with SWAP. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to include E. coli antigens as controls while establishing schistosomal antigens-based diagnostic tests to ensure the specificity of the detected immune responses. Characterization of the cross-reactive ECA antigens with protective potential against S. mansoni infection remains a future research objective.",M1
19756746,"Molecular cloning, sequencing, and expression analysis of presenilin cDNA from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Presenilins (PS) are integral membrane proteins involved, among other functions, in regulated intramembrane proteolysis. In this study, we report the identification and characterization of a complementary DNA from Schistosoma mansoni exhibiting a significant homology to human and nonvertebrate presinilins. S. mansoni contained a 1,485 bp open reading frame encoding a predicted protein of 494 amino acids. Alignment of predicted amino acid sequence of S. mansoni with PS (SmPS) from other species revealed up to 40% similarity shared among the investigated organisms. In addition, phylogenetic analyses demonstrated SmPS being closely related to its orthologues found in Schistosoma japonicum and Caenorhabditis elegans. Expression analysis of SmPS using quantitative real-time PCR revealed that the transcript is up-regulated in the egg stage. We hypothesize that the high level of SmPS in the S. mansoni embryo correlates to an important role during cellular signaling associated to larval development. To our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to investigate the existence and abundance of PS from a helminth parasite.",M1
19746159,"The formin-homology protein SmDia interacts with the Src kinase SmTK and the GTPase SmRho1 in the gonads of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis (bilharzia) is a parasitic disease of worldwide significance affecting human and animals. As schistosome eggs are responsible for pathogenesis, the understanding of processes controlling gonad development might open new perspectives for intervention. The Src-like tyrosine-kinase SmTK3 of Schistosoma mansoni is expressed in the gonads, and its pharmacological inhibition reduces mitogenic activity and egg production in paired females in vitro. Since Src kinases are important signal transduction proteins it is of interest to unravel the signaling cascades SmTK3 is involved in to understand its cellular role in the gonads. METHODOLOGY AND RESULTS: Towards this end we established and screened a yeast two-hybrid (Y2H) cDNA library of adult S. mansoni with a bait construct encoding the SH3 (src homology) domain and unique site of SmTK3. Among the binding partners found was a diaphanous homolog (SmDia), which was characterized further. SmDia is a single-copy gene transcribed throughout development with a bias towards male transcription. Its deduced amino acid sequence reveals all diaphanous-characteristic functional domains. Binding studies with truncated SmDia clones identified SmTK3 interaction sites demonstrating that maximal binding efficiency depends on the N-terminal part of the FH1 (formin homology) domain and the inter-domain region of SmDia located upstream of FH1 in combination with the unique site and the SH3 domain of SmTK3, respectively. SmDia also directly interacted with the GTPase SmRho1 of S. mansoni. In situ hybridization experiments finally demonstrated that SmDia, SmRho1, and SmTK3 are transcribed in the gonads of both genders. CONCLUSION: These data provide first evidence for the existence of two cooperating pathways involving Rho and Src that bridge at SmDia probably organizing cytoskeletal events in the reproductive organs of a parasite, and beyond that in gonads of eukaryotes. Furthermore, the FH1 and inter domain region of SmDia have been discovered as binding sites for the SH3 and unique site domains of SmTK3, respectively.",M1
19726755,"Modulation of a <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> multidrug transporter by the antischistosomal drug praziquantel.P-glycoprotein (Pgp) is an ATP-dependent efflux pump involved in transport of xenobiotics from cells that, when overexpressed, can mediate multidrug resistance in mammalian cells. Pgp may be a candidate target for new anthelmintics, as it plays critical roles in normal cell physiology, in removal of drugs from cells, and potentially in the development of drug resistance. Schistosomes are parasitic flatworms that cause schistosomiasis, which affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide. Here, we express SMDR2, a Pgp homologue from Schistosoma mansoni (Platyhelminthes), in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells and use fluorescence-based assays to examine the functional and pharmacological properties of this transporter. Membrane vesicles from stably transfected CHO cells expressing recombinant SMDR2 show significant increases in rhodamine transport and ATP hydrolysis compared with those from control cells or cells transfected with empty vector. SMDR2-mediated transport is inhibited by the Pgp modulators verapamil (IC(50)=12.1 muM) and nifedipine, and also by praziquantel, the current drug of choice against schisotosomiasis (IC(50)=17.4 muM). Efflux measurements of a fluorescent analog of praziquantel indicate that it is also a substrate for SMDR2. The interaction of praziquantel with SMDR2 may offer new strategies for potentiating the action of praziquantel and possibly overcoming drug resistance.",M1
19710012,"Inhibition of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> thioredoxin-glutathione reductase by auranofin: structural and kinetic aspects.Schistosomiasis is a parasitic disease affecting over 200 million people currently treated with one drug, praziquantel. A possible drug target is the seleno-protein thioredoxin-glutathione reductase (TGR), a key enzyme in the pathway of the parasite for detoxification of reactive oxygen species. The enzyme is a unique fusion of a glutaredoxin domain with a thioredoxin reductase domain, which contains a selenocysteine (Sec) as the penultimate amino acid. Auranofin (AF), a gold-containing compound already in clinical use as an anti-arthritic drug, has been shown to inhibit TGR and to substantially reduce worm burden in mice. Using x-ray crystallography we solved (at 2.5 A resolution) the structure of wild type TGR incubated with AF. The electron density maps show that the actual inhibitor is gold, released from AF. Gold is bound at three different sites not directly involving the C-terminal Sec residue; however, because the C terminus in the electron density maps is disordered, we cannot exclude the possibility that gold may also bind to Sec. To investigate the possible role of Sec in the inactivation kinetics, we tested the effect of AF on a model enzyme of the same superfamily, i.e. the naturally Sec-lacking glutathione reductase, and on truncated TGR. We demonstrate that the role of selenium in the onset of inhibition by AF is catalytic and can be mimicked by an external source of selenium (benzeneselenol). Therefore, we propose that Sec mediates the transfer of gold from its ligands in AF to the redox-active Cys couples of TGR.",M1
19660454,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection of juvenile Biomphalaria glabrata induces a differential stress response between resistant and susceptible snails.Schistosomes develop successfully in susceptible snails but are encapsulated and killed in resistant ones. Mechanism(s) shaping these outcomes involves the parasites ability to evade the snail's defenses. RNA analysis from resistant (BS-90), non-susceptible (LAC2) and susceptible (NMRI) juvenile Biomphalaria glabrata to Schistosoma mansoni revealed that stress-related genes, heat shock protein 70 (Hsp 70) and reverse transcriptase (RT), were dramatically co-induced early in susceptible snails, but not in resistant/non-susceptible ones. These transcripts were, however, down regulated upon exposure to irradiated parasites although penetration behavior of irradiated vs. normal parasites were the same, indicating that Hsp 70 and RT regulation was elicited by infection and not injury. Understanding molecular events involved in stress response transcriptional regulation of Hsp 70 in juvenile snails could pave a way towards the identification of genes involved in schistosome/snail interactions.",M1

However, the specific molecules that prime the development of Th2 responses have not been identified. We report that omega-1, a glycoprotein which is secreted from S. mansoni eggs and present in SEA, is capable of conditioning human monocyte-derived dendritic cells in vitro to drive T helper 2 (Th2) polarization with similar characteristics as whole SEA. Furthermore, using IL-4 dual reporter mice, we show that both natural and recombinant omega-1 alone are sufficient to generate Th2 responses in vivo, even in the absence of IL-4R signaling. Finally, omega-1-depleted SEA displays an impaired capacity for Th2 priming in vitro, but not in vivo, suggesting the existence of additional factors within SEA that can compensate for the omega-1-mediated effects. Collectively, we identify omega-1, a single component of SEA, as a potent inducer of Th2 responses.",M1
19635859,"The major component in schistosome eggs responsible for conditioning dendritic cells for Th2 polarization is a T2 ribonuclease (omega-1).<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> eggs contain factors that trigger potent Th2 responses in vivo and condition mouse dendritic cells (DCs) to promote Th2 lymphocyte differentiation. Using an in vitro bystander polarization assay as the readout, we purified and identified the major Th2-inducing component from soluble egg extract (SEA) as the secreted T2 ribonuclease, omega-1. The Th2-promoting activity of omega-1 was found to be sensitive to ribonuclease inhibition and did not require MyD88/TRIF signaling in DCs. In common with unfractioned SEA, the purified native protein suppresses lipopolysaccharide-induced DC activation, but unlike SEA, it fails to trigger interleukin 4 production from basophils. Importantly, omega-1-exposed DCs displayed pronounced cytoskeletal changes and exhibited decreased antigen-dependent conjugate formation with CD4(+) T cells. Based on this evidence, we hypothesize that S. mansoni omega-1 acts by limiting the interaction of DCs with CD4(+) T lymphocytes, thereby lowering the strength of the activation signal delivered.",M1

This digenean is one of two paramphistomid species in the family Zygocotylidae. Z. lunata has an almost global distribution being found in the wild in numerous waterfowl and various species of ruminants. It infects planorbid snails in the genera Helisoma and Biomphalaria. Because it may involve concurrent infections with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in species of Biomphalaria snails, there is an interest in Z. lunata as a potential control agent against S. mansoni. Z. lunata may have some impact as a pathogen of birds in wildlife diseases, but its real assessment in this role is not fully understood. The cercariae of this paramphistomid when released from snails encyst on a substratum such as vegetation or the shells of aquatic invertebrates in the wild or in the laboratory on the glass or plastic of a container holding the snails. Most studies on the intra-molluscan parasitic stages are based on work from snails collected in the wild and experimental studies using laboratory-reared snails are sparse. Numerous experimental mammalian and avian hosts can be infected with the metacercarial cysts of this digenean, but quantitative experimental studies on the adult stages of this parasite using known numbers of cysts and well-defined strains of vertebrate hosts are sparse. Likewise, some studies on the immunology and pathology of this trematode have been done, but for the most part they are fragmentary and do not provide quantitative information on these topics.

19566921,"Genomic linkage map of the human blood fluke <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.BACKGROUND: Schistosoma mansoni is a blood fluke that infects approximately 90 million people. The complete life cycle of this parasite can be maintained in the laboratory, making this one of the few experimentally tractable human helminth infections, and a rich literature reveals heritable variation in important biomedical traits such as virulence, host-specificity, transmission and drug resistance. However, there is a current lack of tools needed to study S. mansoni's molecular, quantitative, and population genetics. Our goal was to construct a genetic linkage map for S. mansoni, and thus provide a new resource that will help stimulate research on this neglected pathogen. RESULTS: We genotyped grandparents, parents and 88 progeny to construct a 5.6 cM linkage map containing 243 microsatellites positioned on 203 of the largest scaffolds in the genome sequence. The map allows 70% of the estimated 300 Mb genome to be ordered on chromosomes, and highlights where scaffolds have been incorrectly assembled. The markers fall into eight main linkage groups, consistent with seven pairs of autosomes and one pair of sex chromosomes, and we were able to anchor linkage groups to chromosomes using fluorescent in situ hybridization. The genome measures 1,228.6 cM. Marker segregation reveals higher female recombination, confirms ZW inheritance patterns, and identifies recombination hotspots and regions of segregation distortion. CONCLUSIONS: The genetic linkage map presented here is the first for S. mansoni and the first for a species in the phylum Platyhelminthes. The map provides the critical tool necessary for quantitative genetic analysis, aids genome assembly, and furnishes a framework for comparative flatworm genomics and field-based molecular epidemiological studies.",M1
19549517,"Two allelic isoforms of the serotonin transporter from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> display electrogenic transport and high selectivity for serotonin.The human blood fluke Schistosoma mansoni is the primary cause of schistosomiasis, a debilitating disease that affects 200 million individuals in over 70 countries. The biogenic amine serotonin is essential for the survival of the parasite and serotonergic proteins are potential novel drug targets for treating schistosomiasis. Here we characterize two novel serotonin transporter gene transcripts, SmSERT-A and SmSERT-B, from S.mansoni. Southern blot analysis shows that the two mRNAs are the products of different alleles of a single SmSERT gene locus. The two SmSERT forms differ in three amino acid positions near the N-terminus of the protein. Both SmSERTs are expressed in the adult form and in the sporocyst form (infected snails) of the parasite, but are absent from all other stages of the parasite's complex life cycle. Heterologous expression of the two cDNAs in mammalian cells resulted in saturable, sodium-dependent serotonin transport activity with an apparent affinity for serotonin comparable to that of the human serotonin transporter. Although the two SmSERTs are pharmacologically indistinguishable from each other, efflux experiments reveal notably higher substrate selectivity for serotonin compared with their mammalian counterparts. Several well-established substrates for human SERT including (+/-)MDMA, S-(+)amphetamine, RU 24969, and m-CPP are not transported by SmSERTs, underscoring the higher selectivity of the schistosomal isoforms. Voltage-clamp recordings of SmSERT substrate-elicited currents confirm the substrate selectivity observed in efflux experiments and suggest that it may be possible to exploit the electrogenic nature of SmSERT to screen for compounds that target the parasite in vivo.",M1
19545592,"Investigation of a dopamine receptor in <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>: functional studies and immunolocalization.A dopamine receptor (SmD2) was cloned from adult Schistosoma mansoni. The receptor has the classical heptahelical topology of class A (rhodopsin-like) G protein-coupled receptors (GPCR) and shares sequence homology with D2-like receptors from other species. The full length SmD2 cDNA was expressed in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and mammalian HEK293 cells. Functional assays in both expression systems revealed that SmD2 was responsive to dopamine in a dose-dependent manner, whereas other structurally related amines had no effect. Activation of SmD2 in mammalian cells caused an elevation in intracellular cAMP but not calcium, suggesting that the receptor coupled to Gs and the stimulation of adenylate cyclase. Pharmacological studies showed that the S. mansoni dopamine receptor was inhibited by apomorphine, a classical dopamine agonist, as well as known dopaminergic antagonists, including chlorpromazine, spiperone and haloperidol. SmD2 immunoreactivity was detected in membrane protein fractions of S. mansoni cercaria, in vitro transformed schistosomula and adult parasites, using a specific peptide antibody. When tested by confocal immunofluorescence, SmD2 was detected in the subtegumental somatic musculature and acetabulum of all larval stages tested. In the adults, SmD2 was enriched in the somatic muscles and, to a lesser extent, the muscular lining of the caecum. The results suggest that SmD2 is an important component of the neuromuscular system in schistosomes.",M1
19545530,"Developmental expression analysis and immunolocalization of a biogenic amine receptor in <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.A Schistosoma mansoni G-protein coupled receptor (SmGPCR) was previously cloned and shown to be activated by the biogenic amine, histamine. Here we report a first investigation of the receptor's subunit organization, tissue distribution and expression levels in different stages of the parasite. A polyclonal antibody was produced in rabbits against the recombinant third intracellular loop (il3) of SmGPCR. Western blot studies of the native receptor and recombinant protein expressed in HEK293 cells showed that SmGPCR exists both as a monomer (65 kDa) and an apparent dimer of approximately 130 kDa These species were verified by immunoprecipitation of SmGPCR from S. mansoni extracts, using antibody that was covalently attached to agarose beads. Further investigation determined that the SmGPCR dimer was resistant to treatment with various detergents, 4 M urea and 0.1 M DTT but could be made to dissociate at acidic pH, suggesting the dimer is non-covalent in nature. Confocal immunofluorescence studies revealed significant SmGPCR immunoreactivity in sporocysts, schistosomula and adult worms but not miracidia. SmGPCR was found to be most widely expressed in the schistosomula, particularly the tegument, the subtegumental musculature and the acetabulum. In the adult stage we detected SmGPCR immunofluorescence mainly in the tubercles of male worms and, to a lesser extent, the body wall musculature. Localization in sporocysts was mainly confined to the tegument and cells within parenchymal matrices. A real-time quantitative reverse-transcription PCR analysis revealed that SmGPCR is upregulated at the mRNA level in the parasitic stages compared to the free-living miracidium and cercariae, and it is particularly elevated during early sporocyst and schistosomula development. The results identify SmGPCR as an important parasite receptor with potential functions in muscle and the tegument of S. mansoni.",M1
19543747,"Penetration of cercariae into the living human skin: <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> vs. Trichobilharzia szidati.We studied the skin invasion of Schistosoma mansoni cercariae by placing gamma-irradiated and nonirradiated cercariae onto the living human skin and timing the behavior of 53 individuals. The skin invasion of S. mansoni was less efficient compared to the bird schistosome Trichobilharzia szidati. S. mansoni cercariae crept longer on the skin after attachment until they started penetration movements (median of 43 s [range of 15 s-6.58 min]; T. szidati, median of 8 s [range of 0-80 s]). Subsequent to this longer exploratory phase, 74% penetrated into wrinkles (T. szidati 84%), 22% into the smooth skin surface (T. szidati 0%), and 4% into hair follicles (T. szidati 16%). The S. mansoni cercariae needed, on average, 6.58 min (range of 1.57-13.13 min) for full entry, while T. szidati needed 4.0 min (range of 1.38-13.34 min); the fastest S. mansoni cercaria entered the skin within 94 s, while T. szidati entered within 83 s. Sixty percent of the S. mansoni cercariae had the tails still attached when the bodies disappeared in the skin whereas all T. szidati cercariae shed their tails within 0-105 s after the onset of penetration movements. The faster invasion of T. szidati may result from the more sophisticated host-finding mechanisms of this species. Regarding S. mansoni, cercarial dermatitis, as immediate skin response, developed after a sensitization period of 19 days.",M1
19539649,"IL-12 and TNF-alpha production by dendritic cells stimulated with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> schistosomula tegument is TLR4- and MyD88-dependent.Schistosoma mansoni schistosomula are the most susceptible parasite life stage to host immune system attack. Complex host-parasite interactions take place on Schistosoma tegument, which is a unique double membrane structure involved in nutrition and immune evasion. Herein, we have demonstrated that schistosomula tegument (Smteg) activates Dendritic cells to produce IL-12p40, TNF-alpha and also to up-regulate the co-stimulatory molecules CD40 and CD86. Moreover, using DCs derived from MyD88-, TLR2-, TLR4- and TLR9-deficient mice we have shown that the ability of Smteg to activate DCs to produce IL-12 and TNF-alpha involves TLR4/Smteg interaction and MyD88 signaling pathway. Finally, our findings lead us to conclude that TLR4 is a key receptor involved in Smteg induction of pro-inflammatory cytokines.",M1
19538992,"Histone deacetylase inhibitors induce apoptosis, histone hyperacetylation and up-regulation of gene transcription in <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.In order to explore the conservation/divergence of transcriptional regulation in the platyhelminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni, we are studying the structures and functions of transcriptional mediators and in particular histone-modifying enzymes. Reversible histone acetylation changes chromatin structure and modulates gene transcription. The removal of acetyl residues from histones and other proteins is catalyzed by histone deacetylases (HDACs) that are under increasing study as therapeutic targets, both in cancer and parasitic diseases. In order to determine the extent and importance of histone acetylation in S. mansoni, we tested the effects of three histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) on both larval and adult worms in culture. Trichostatin A (TSA), valproic acid (VPA) and suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) inhibited global HDAC activity at all life-cycle stages. TSA and VPA, but not SAHA, caused mortality of schistosomula and adults, with TSA showing the most rapid effect. Moreover, TSA caused an increase in apoptosis in schistosomula shown by the TUNEL assay and an increase in caspase 3/7 activity. Both TSA and VPA were shown to cause an increase in general levels of protein acetylation in schistosomes; more particularly of histone 4 whereas histone 3 acetylation was less affected. In the case of TSA treatment this histone hyperacetylation was correlated with the increased expression of caspases 3 and 7 transcripts. Finally, quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation showed that the proximal promoter region of the S. mansoni caspase 7 gene was hyperacetylated on histone H4 after TSA treatment.",M1
19526726,"Cross-reactivity of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>-Fasciola gigantica influenced by saponins.The aim of the present work was to investigate the Schistosoma mansoni and Fasciola gigantica cross-reactivity between adult worms and egg homogenates of the parasites. Immunoprophylactic effects of crude Schistosoma mansoni worms and egg antigens mixed with or without saponins extracted from Atriplex nummularia were studied followed by challenge with 80 cercariae of Schistosoma mansoni. Our results showed that post 1st immunization with schistosome egg antigens (SEA) there was a significant change (P approximately 0.05) in the IgM levels against Fasciola egg homogenate (FgEH) without saponins. Post 2nd immunization with SEA mixed with saponins the levels of IgM increased significantly (P approximately 0.05) against Fasciola worm homogenate (FgWH) as compared with a non-immunized group. Post 2nd immunization the level of IgG was significantly elevated (P approximately 0.05) by SEA mixed with saponins against FgWH. Post 2nd immunizations with SEA mixed with saponins showed a significant change (P approximately 0.05) in IgG levels against FgEH. These results clearly demonstrated that there is a cross-reactivity between Schistosoma mansoni eggs and Fasciola gigantica worms and eggs.

19523440,"Translationally controlled tumor protein is a novel heat shock protein with chaperone-like activity.Translationally controlled tumor protein (TCTP) is often designated as a stress-related protein because of its highly regulated expression in stress conditions. Following a thermal shock, TCTP expression is highly upregulated in a variety of cells. However, at present it is not known whether this upregulation has any cell protective function similar to other heat shock proteins. In this study human TCTP (HuTCTP) and a TCTP homolog (SmTCTP) from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> were evaluated for heat shock protein-like function and molecular chaperone activity. Our results show that similar to other molecular chaperones, both human and parasite TCTPs can bind to a variety of denatured proteins and protect them from the harmful effects of thermal shock. An important observation was the ability of both HuTCTP and SmTCTP to bind to native protein and protect them from thermal denaturation. Over expression of TCTP in bacterial cells protected them from heat shock-induced death. These findings suggest that TCTP may belong to a novel small molecular weight heat shock protein.",M1
19488406,"SmCL3, a gastrodermal cysteine protease of the human blood fluke <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.BACKGROUND: Blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma are platyhelminth parasites that infect 200 million people worldwide. Digestion of nutrients from the host bloodstream is essential for parasite development and reproduction. A network of proteolytic enzymes (proteases) facilitates hydrolysis of host hemoglobin and serum proteins. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We identified a new cathepsin L termed SmCL3 using PCR strategies based on S. mansoni EST sequence data. An ortholog is present in Schistosoma japonicum. SmCL3 was heterologously expressed as an active enzyme in the yeast, Pichia pastoris. Recombinant SmCL3 has a broad pH activity range against peptidyl substrates and is inhibited by Clan CA protease inhibitors. Consistent with a function in degrading host proteins, SmCL3 hydrolyzes serum albumin and hemoglobin, is localized to the adult gastrodermis, and is expressed mainly in those life stages infecting the mammalian host. The predominant form of SmCL3 in the parasite exists as a zymogen, which is unusual for proteases. This zymogen includes an unusually long prodomain with alpha helical secondary structure motifs. The striking specificity of SmCL3 for amino acids with large aromatic side chains (Trp and Tyr) at the P2 substrate position, as determined with positional scanning-synthetic combinatorial library, is consistent with a molecular model that shows a large and deep S2 pocket. A sequence similarity network (SSN) view clusters SmCL3 and other cathepsins L in accordance with previous large-scale phylogenetic analyses that identify six super kingdoms. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: SmCL3 is a gut-associated cathepsin L that may contribute to the network of proteases involved in degrading host blood proteins as nutrients. Furthermore, this enzyme exhibits some unusual sequence and biophysical features that may result in additional functions. The visualization of network inter-relationships among cathepsins L suggests that these enzymes are suitable 'marker sequences' for inclusion in future phylogenetic analyses.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Methylene chloride and methanol extracts of 32 plant species were screened for in vitro anthelmintic activity against three species of worms, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, the digeneans Paramphistomum epiclitum and <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> (cercariae). Cytotoxicity of the extracts was evaluated against two cancer cell lines: human amelanotic melanoma (C32) and human cervical carcinoma (HeLa) by the SRB assay. Anthelmintic and anticancer activities were evaluated by the inhibiting concentration at 50% death (IC(50)) and the selectivity index (SI) relative to human fibroblasts. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: None of the extracts were active against Paramphistomum epiclitum. Plumbagin, a pure compound from Plumbago indica, had the strongest activity against Caenorhabditis elegans. The methylene chloride extract of Piper chaba fruits had the strongest activity against schistosome cercariae. Strong cytotoxicity was shown by the methylene chloride extract of Michelia champaca bark and the methanol extract of Curcuma longa rhizome against C32 and HeLa, respectively. These extracts had higher SI (&gt;100) than positive controls in relation to either the worms or the cell lines. The methanol extract of Bouea burmanica had a slightly lower activity towards C32 cells than did Michelia champaca but had a much higher SI (&gt;27,000).

19463860,"RNA interference targeting leucine aminopeptidase blocks hatching of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> eggs.Schistosoma mansoni leucine aminopeptidase (LAP) is thought to play a central role in hatching of the miracidium from the schistosome egg. We identified two discrete LAPs genes in the S. mansoni genome, and their orthologs in S. japonicum. The similarities in sequence and exon/intron structure of the two genes, LAP1 and LAP2, suggest that they arose by gene duplication and that this occurred before separation of the mansoni and japonicum lineages. The SmLAP1 and SmLAP2 genes have different expression patterns in diverse stages of the cycle; whereas both are equally expressed in the blood dwelling stages (schistosomules and adult), SmLAP2 expression was higher in free living larval (miracidia) and in parasitic intra-snail (sporocysts) stages. We investigated the role of each enzyme in hatching of schistosome eggs and the early stages of schistosome development by RNA interference (RNAi). Using RNAi, we observed marked and specific reduction of mRNAs, along with a loss of exopeptidase activity in soluble parasite extracts against the diagnostic substrate l-leucine-7-amido-4-methylcoumarin hydroxide. Strikingly, knockdown of either SmLAP1 or SmLAP2, or both together, was accompanied by &gt;or=80% inhibition of hatching of schistosome eggs showing that both enzymes are important to the escape of miracidia from the egg. The methods employed here refine the utility of RNAi for functional genomics studies in helminth parasites and confirm these can be used to identify potential drug targets, in this case schistosome aminopeptidases.",M1
19428677,"Efficient genotyping of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> miracidia following whole genome amplification.Small parasites and larval stages pose a problem for molecular analyses because limited amounts of DNA template are available. Isothermal methods for faithfully copying DNA have the potential to revolutionize studies of such organisms. We evaluated the fidelity of multiple displacement amplification (MDA) for amplifying DNA extracted from a single miracidium of Schistosoma mansoni. To do this we genotyped DNA extracted from 28 F1 miracidia following MDA using 56 microsatellite markers. Because these miracidia were obtained from a cross between a male and female worm of known genotypes, we were able to predict the alleles present in the progeny and quantify the genotyping error rate. We found just 8/1568 genotypes deviated from Mendelian expectations. Furthermore, because 1 of these resulted from a genuine mutation, the error rate due to MDA is 7/1568 (0.45%). We conclude that many hundreds of microsatellites or other genetic markers can be accurately genotyped from a single miracidium using this method, greatly expanding the scope of population genetic, epidemiological and evolutionary studies on this parasite.",M1
19428676,"Quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (Q-ChIP) applied to <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.The life-cycle of the platyhelminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni is characterized by marked morphological changes between the various stages that are the result of a complex developmental program. In order to study the role of epigenetic mechanisms in regulating this program, and more particularly the role of changes in histone modifications in the control of the transcription of key genes, we have adapted the technique of quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (Q-ChIP) to larval stages and adult worms. We have used the classical method involving formaldehyde-induced cross-linking of DNA-associated proteins, followed by ultrasonication to fragment the DNA before immunoprecipitation and have established a protocol for use with schistosomes. We show, using antibodies directed against acetylated histone H4, that the technique is applicable to the parasite and allows the quantification and comparison of the levels of modified histone at gene promoters at different life-cycle stages.",M1
19428675,"Native chromatin immunoprecipitation (N-ChIP) and ChIP-Seq of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>: Critical experimental parameters.Histone modifications are important epigenetic marks that influence chromatin structure and consequently play a role in the control of eukaryotic transcription. Several histone modifying enzymes have been characterized in Schistosoma mansoni and it has been suggested that the regulation of gene transcription in schistosomes may require the action of these enzymes. However, the influence of chromatin structure on gene transcription in schistosomes has never been investigated. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) is the technique of choice to study the relationship between histone modifications and gene expression. Although this technique has been widely used with cultured cells from model organisms and with many unicellular organisms, it remains challenging to apply this technique to non-conventional organisms that undergo complex life cycles. In this work, we describe a native ChIP procedure that is applicable to all the stages of the S. mansoni life cycle and does not require expensive equipment. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analysed on a whole-genome scale using massively parallel sequencing (ChIP-Sequencing or ChIP-Seq). We show that ChIP-Seq and conventional quantitative PCR deliver comparable results for a life-cycle regulated locus, smRHO, that encodes a guanine-protein coupled receptor. This is the first time that the ChIP-Seq procedure has been applied to a parasite. This technique opens new ways for analyzing epigenetic mechanisms in S. mansoni at a whole-genome scale and on the level of individual loci.",M1
19428670,"Characterization of phosphodiesterase-5 as a surface protein in the tegument of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Schistosoma mansoni is a major causative agent of schistosomiasis, an important parasitic disease that constitutes a severe health problem in developing countries. Even though an effective treatment exists, it does not prevent re-infection and the development of an effective vaccine still remains the most desirable means of control for this disease. In this work we describe the cloning and characterization of a S. mansoni nucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphosdiesterase type 5 (SmNPP-5), previously identified in the tegument by proteomic studies. In silico analysis predicts an N-terminal signal peptide, three N-glycosylation sites and a C-terminal transmembrane domain similar to that described for mammalian isoforms. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot analyses determined that SmNPP-5 is significantly upregulated in the transition from free-living cercaria to schistosomulum and adult worm parasitic stages; additionally, the native protein was demonstrated to be N-glycosylated. Immunolocalization experiments and tegument surface membrane preparations confirm the protein as a tegument surface protein. Furthermore, the ectolocalization of this enzyme was corroborated through the hydrolysis of the phosphodiesterase specific substrate (rho-Nph-5'-TMP) by living adult and 21-day-old worms. Interestingly, pre-incubation of adult and 21-day-old worms with anti-rSmNPP-5 antibody was able to reduce by 50-60% the enzyme activity. These results suggest that SmNPP-5 is closely associated with the new tegument surface generation after cercarial penetration, and being located at the host-parasite interface, is a potential target for immune intervention.",M1
19428656,"Characterization and binding affinities of SmLANP: a new <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> member of the ANP32 family of regulatory proteins.Members of the leucine-rich repeat protein family are involved in diverse functions including protein phosphatase 2-inhibition, cell cycle regulation, gene regulation and signalling pathways. A novel Schistosoma mansoni gene, called SmLANP, presenting homology to various genes coding for proteins that belong to the super family of leucine-rich repeat proteins, was characterized here. SmLANP was 1184bp in length as determined from cDNA and genomic sequences and encoded a 296 amino acid open reading frame that spanning from 6 to 894bp. The predicted amino acid sequence had a calculated molecular weight of 32kDa. Analysis of the predicted sequence indicated the presence of 3 leucine-rich domains (LRR) located in the N-terminal region and an aspartic acid rich region in the C-terminal end. SmLANP transcript is expressed in all stages of the S. mansoni life cycle analyzed, exhibiting the highest expression level in males. The SmLANP protein was expressed in a GST expression system and antibodies raised in mice against the recombinant protein. By immunolocalization assay, using adult worms, it was shown that the protein is mainly present in the cell nucleus through the whole body and strongly expressed along the tegument cell body nuclei of adult worms. As members of this family are usually involved in protein-protein interaction, a yeast two hybrid assay was conducted to identify putative binding partners for SmLANP. Thirty-six possible partners were identified, and a protein ATP synthase subunit alpha was confirmed by pull down assays, as a binding partner of the SmLANP protein.",M1

In this study we have collected evidence on the mode of inheritance of the partial insensitivity exhibited by the PZQ-selected schistosomes. A single male and a single female worm of the two strains, assorted in the four possible combinations, were introduced into the mesenteric veins of mice and the eggs produced by each pair were used as the source of the F(1) progeny. PZQ sensitivity was assessed using both in vivo and in vitro methods. In the first approach, the PZQ ED(50) was determined by infecting mice with cercariae of the strains to be tested, treating at seven weeks with different drug doses and counting the number of surviving worms three weeks later. For the in vitro approach, adult schistosomes kept in culture were exposed overnight to different PZQ concentrations and their survival was monitored during the subsequent 7 days. Results from both approaches lead to the conclusion that hybrid schistosomes of the F(1) generation have a drug sensitivity intermediate between those of the two parental strains and are thus suggestive of a pattern of partial dominance for the trait under study.",M1

In all collection sites, only this species was found and 183 (20.13%) harbored trematode infections. In these collections, four morphologically distinguishable types of cercariae were identified by confocal microscopy. Xiphidiocercaria (Cercaria lutzi) was the most common type of cercaria recovered, contributing 76.5% of all infections. Schistosoma mansoni cercariae were recovered and comprised the total of 13.11%. Strigea cercaria (Cercaria caratinguensis) and Brevifurcate pharyngeate Clinostomatoide cercaria (Cercaria ocellifera) contributed 8.33% and 2.22% of all infections, respectively. Double infections (S. mansoni and C. lutzi) were found in twelve snails, contributing 6.55% of all infections. In all sites studied, small vertebrates were found in snail habitats and it was observed human contact with the water.

19375430,"Effects of UVB on interactions between <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and Biomphalaria glabrata.Ultraviolet B (UVB, 280-315nm) radiation is detrimental to both of larvae of the digenetic trematode Schistosoma mansoni and its snail intermediate host, Biomphalaria glabrata. We explored effects of UVB on three aspects of the interaction between host and parasite: survival of infected snails, innate susceptibility and resistance of snails to infection, and acquired resistance induced by irradiated miracidia. Snails infected for 1 week showed significantly lower survival than uninfected snails following irradiation with a range of UVB intensities. In contrast to known immunomodulatory effects in vertebrates, an effect of UVB on susceptibility or resistance of snails to infection could not be conclusively demonstrated. Finally, exposure of susceptible snails to UVB-irradiated miracidia failed to induce resistance to a subsequent challenge with nonirradiated miracidia, a result similar to that reported previously with ionizing radiation.",M1
19374857,"The effects of 3-methylclonazepam on <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> musculature are not mediated by benzodiazepine receptors.Schistosomiasis is one of the most prevalent infectious diseases worldwide and classified as a neglected disease for which there is an urgent need for searching new drug candidates. According to TDR/WHO, existing leads with proven schistosomicidal activity, like meclonazepam, might be the objects of further exploration. Here, we decided to investigate if the benzodiazepine binding sites that we recently characterized in adult Schistosoma mansoni could represent the molecular target of meclonazepam for its effect on worm motility and morphological appearance. The EC(50) of meclonazepam for its contracturant effect is 10-20 times lower than its IC(50) for binding to the worm benzodiazepine binding sites. On the contrary, benzodiazepines like flunitrazepam and diazepam have affinities at least 50 times higher than meclonazepam for these binding sites but did not induce contraction of the worms. We also confirmed the existence of a great similarity between the appearance, kinetics, Emax and external calcium dependency of the contractile effect of praziquantel and meclonazepam. Based on computer-aided molecular modeling calculations, we verified that a certain structural similarity exists between the active enantiomers of both drugs. We further proposed the hypothesis of common pharmacophoric elements including amide and imine subunits and the asymmetric carbons of S-(+)-meclozepam and R-(-)-praziquantel. As a whole, the present data indicate that the contracturant effect of meclonazepam is not a result of its binding to the worm benzodiazepine binding sites but that it shares some basic transduction pathway with praziquantel, even if not through identical molecular targets or binding sites.",M1
19364765,"The role of tegumental aquaporin from the human parasitic worm, <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>, in osmoregulation and drug uptake.Schistosomes are parasitic platyhelminths that constitute an important public health problem globally. Infection is characterized by the presence of adult worms within the vasculature of their hosts, where they can reside for many years. The worms are covered by an unusual dual lipid bilayer through which they import nutrients. How the parasites import other vital molecules, such as water, is not known. Recent proteomic analysis of the schistosome tegumental membranes revealed the presence of an aquaporin homologue at the host-interactive surface whose cDNA we have cloned and characterized. The cDNA encodes a predicted 304-aa protein (SmAQP) that is found largely in the parasite tegument by immunolocalization and is most highly expressed in the intravascular life stages. Treatment of parasites with short interfering RNAs targeting the SmAQP gene results in potent (&gt;90%) suppression. These suppressed parasites resist swelling when placed in hypotonic medium, unlike their control counterparts, which rapidly double in volume. In addition, SmAQP-suppressed parasites, unlike controls, resist shrinkage when incubated in hyperosmotic solution. While suppressed parasites exhibit lower viability in culture relative to controls and exhibit a stunted appearance following prolonged suppression, they are nonetheless more resistant to killing by the drug potassium antimonyl tartrate (PAT). This is likely because SmAQP acts as a conduit for this drug, as is the case for aquaporins in other systems. These experiments reveal a heretofore unrecognized role of the schistosome tegument in controlling water and drug movement into the parasites and highlight the importance of the tegument in parasite osmoregulation and drug uptake.",M1

Brazil) was studied comparatively, in terms of their respective susceptibilities to infection by Schistosoma mansoni of the same origin, through observation of the elimination of cercariae for a three-month period and the calculation of mortality and infection rates, in control and in infected snails. The number of amoebocytes, granulocytes and hyalinocytes in the circulating hemolymph during different periods of infection was analyzed. The evolution of the infection in the tissues was observed by means of histological cross-sections. The melanic variant showed greater susceptibility to infection and a higher mortality rate. The albino variant showed a higher number of circulating amoebocytes, both granulocytes and hyalinocytes. A higher number of degenerated sporocysts were seen in the histological cross-sections of the albino variant. The results suggest that the melanic variant of B. glabrata was more susceptible to infection by S. mansoni than was the albino variant.",M1
19346298,"Imaging schistosomes in vivo.Schistosomes are intravascular, parasitic helminths that cause a chronic, often debilitating disease afflicting over 200 million people in over 70 countries. Here we describe novel imaging methods that, for the first time, permit visualization of live schistosomes within their living hosts. The technology centers on fluorescent agent uptake and activation in the parasite's gut, and subsequent detection and signal quantitation using fluorescence molecular tomography (FMT). There is a strong positive correlation between the signal detected and parasite number. <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> parasites of both sexes recovered from infected experimental animals exhibit vivid fluorescence throughout their intestines. Likewise, the remaining important human schistosome parasites, S. japonicum and S. hematobium, also exhibit gut fluorescence when recovered from infected animals. Imaging has been used to efficiently document the decline in parasite numbers in infected mice treated with the antischistosome drug praziquantel. This technology will provide a unique opportunity both to help rapidly identify much-needed, novel antischistosome therapies and to gain direct visual insight into the intravascular lives of the major schistosome parasites of humans.",M1
19340911,"Schistosomal appendicitis: incidence in Japan and a case report.Schistosomal appendicitis is very rare in developed countries like the USA, Europe, and Japan. The author reviewed 311 pathologic archival specimens of vermiform appendix over the past 10 years. One case of schistosomal appendicitis was recognized. Therefore, the incidence of this disease was 0.32% in all appendices surgically resected in our hospital. The patient was a 41-year-old woman presenting with lower abdominal pain. She was a sailor traveling to many countries including endemic areas. Physical examination, laboratory data, and imaging modalities suggested an acute appendicitis, and appendectomy was performed under the diagnosis of ordinary appendicitis. Histologically, numerous schistosomal eggs were present in the vasculatures throughout the appendiceal walls. Some of the eggs were calcified. Stromal foreign body reaction was also recognized. The appendicitis was phlegmonous consisting of severe infiltrations of neutrophils and eosinophils. Acute serositis was also noted. Examination of feces revealed numerous eggs of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>. Clinicians should be aware of schistosomal appendicitis.",M1
19291704,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> egg antigens induce Treg that participate in diabetes prevention in NOD mice.Schistosoma mansoni soluble egg antigens (SEA) profoundly regulate the infected host's immune system. We previously showed that SEA prevents type 1 diabetes in NOD mice and that splenocytes from SEA-treated mice have reduced ability to transfer diabetes to NOD.scid recipients. To further characterize the mechanism of diabetes prevention we examined the cell types involved and showed that CD25(+) T-cell depletion of splenocytes from SEA-treated donors restored their ability to transfer diabetes. Furthermore, SEA treatment increased the number and proportional representation of Foxp3(+) T cells in the pancreas of NOD mice. We have used in vitro systems to analyze the effect of SEA on the development of NOD Foxp3(+) T cells. We find that SEA can induce Foxp3 expression in na√Øve T cells in a TGF-beta-dependent manner. Foxp3 induction requires the presence of DC, which we also show are modified by SEA to upregulate C-type lectins, IL-10 and IL-2. Our studies show that SEA can have a direct effect on CD4(+) T cells increasing expression of TGF-beta, integrin beta8 and galectins. These effects of SEA on DC and T cells may act in synergy to induce Foxp3(+) Treg in the NOD mouse.",M1
19281639,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> TOR is a tetraspanning orphan receptor on the parasite surface.SUMMARY: A trispanning orphan receptor (TOR) has been described in Schistosoma haematobium and S. mansoni. Here we report the complete molecular organization of the S. mansoni TOR gene, also known as SmCRIT (complement C2 receptor inhibitor trispanning). The SmTOR gene consists of 4 exons and 3 introns as shown by cloning the single exons from S. mansoni genomic DNA and the corresponding cDNA from the larval stage (cercaria) and the adult worm. The SmTOR ORF consists of 1260 bp and is longer than previously reported, with a fourth trans-membrane domain (proposed new name: Tetraspanning Orphan Receptor) and with, however, an unchanged C2-binding domain on the extracellular domain 1 (ed1). This domain differs in S. japonicum. A protein at the approximate expected molecular weight (55 kDa) was detected in adult worm extracts with polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies, and was found to be expressed on the tegumental surface of cercariae.",M1

We performed a genome-wide expression analysis of the S. mansoni miracidia and developing sporocyst using Long Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (LongSAGE). Five cDNA libraries were constructed from miracidia and in vitro cultured 6- and 20-day-old sporocysts maintained in sporocyst medium (SM) or in SM conditioned by previous cultivation with cells of the B. glabrata embryonic (Bge) cell line. We generated 21 440 SAGE tags and mapped 13 381 to the S. mansoni gene predictions (v4.0e) either by estimating theoretical 3' UTR lengths or using existing 3' EST sequence data. Overall, 432 transcripts were found to be differentially expressed amongst all 5 libraries. In total, 172 tags were differentially expressed between miracidia and 6-day conditioned sporocysts and 152 were differentially expressed between miracidia and 6-day unconditioned sporocysts. In addition, 53 and 45 tags, respectively, were differentially expressed in 6-day and 20-day cultured sporocysts, due to the effects of exposure to Bge cell-conditioned medium.",M1
19250641,"Phosphatidylinositol-and related-kinases: a genome-wide survey of classes and subtypes in the <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> genome for designing subtype-specific inhibitors.Phosphatidylinositol kinases (PIK) are at the heart of one of the major pathways of intracellular signal transduction. The signals made by PIK influence a wide variety of cellular functions, including cell growth, differentiation and survival, glucose metabolism and cytoskeletal organization. Wortmannin strongly binds in vitro to all PIK subtypes and it is therefore an effective antiproliferative agent. This study is the first report on a survey made by similarity searches against Schistosoma mansoni genome available to date for phosphatidylinositol- and related-kinases (SmPIKs). We classified the SmPIKs according to five models (1-5). SmPIK sequences were retrieved from GeneDB (http://www.genedb.org) by means of a combinatorial approach which uses terms defined in genome annotation associated with PFAM (Protein Families) domains, BLAST analysis and COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins). This approach detects the kinase (catalytic) domain structure and also the recently described FAT and FATC motifs.",M1
19193240,"Combined TLR2 and TLR4 ligation in the context of bacterial or helminth extracts in human monocyte derived dendritic cells: molecular correlates for Th1/Th2 polarization.BACKGROUND: Recognition of pathogens by dendritic cells (DCs) through interaction with pattern recognition receptors, including Toll like receptors (TLR), is crucial for the initiation of appropriate polarized T helper (Th) cell responses. Yet, the characteristics and differences in molecular profiles of DCs with different T cell polarizing capacities are still poorly defined. To address this issue, the molecular profile of human monocyte derived DCs was characterized after exposure to TLR4 ligand LPS in combination with the Th1 promoting bacterial extracts from Listeria monocytogenes and Escherichia coli or the Th2 promoting helminth derived phospholipids from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and Ascaris lumbricoides, all with TLR2 activating capacity. RESULTS: With regard to the signalling pathways activated upon exposure to LPS and the TLR2 activating compounds, we find that the ratio of activated Mitogen Activated Protein Kinases (MAPK) p-ERK/p-p38 is lower in DCs stimulated with the bacterial products compared to DCs stimulated with the helminth products, which correlates with the Th1 and Th2 polarizing capacity of these compounds. Furthermore, analysis of the mRNA expression levels of a set of 25 carefully selected genes potentially involved in modulation of T cell polarization revealed that the mRNA expression of notch ligand delta-4 and transcription factor c-fos are differentially regulated and show a strong correlation with Th1 and Th2 polarization, respectively. CONCLUSION: This study shows that combined TLR2 and TLR4 activation in the context of different antigen sources can induce very distinct molecular profiles in DCs and suggests that the Th1/Th2 polarizing capacity of compounds can be predicted with the molecular signature they induce in DCs.",M1
19160037,"Hox genes in the parasitic platyhelminthes Mesocestoides corti, Echinococcus multilocularis, and <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>: evidence for a reduced Hox complement.Little is known about the Hox gene complement in parasitic platyhelminthes (Neodermata). With the aim of identifying Hox genes in this group we performed two independent strategies: we performed a PCR survey with degenerate primers directed to the Hox homeobox in the cestode Mesocestoides corti, and we searched genomic assemblies of Echinococcus multilocularis and Schistosoma mansoni. We identified two Hox genes in M. corti, seven in E. multilocularis, and nine in S. mansoni (including five previously reported). The affinities of these sequences, and other previously reported Hox sequences from flatworms, were determined according to phylogenetic analysis, presence of characteristic parapeptide sequences, and unusual intron positions. Our results suggest that the last common ancestor of triclads and neodermatans had a Hox gene complement of at least seven genes, and that this was probably derived by gene loss from a larger ancestral Hox complement in lophotrochozoans.",M1
19126270,"Flow cytometry analysis of the circulating haemocytes from Biomphalaria glabrata and Biomphalaria tenagophila following <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection.Aiming to further characterize the haemocyte subsets in Biomphalaria snails, we have performed a detailed flow cytometric analysis of whole haemolymph cellular components using a multiparametric dual colour labelling procedure. Ethidium bromide/acridine orange fluorescence features were used to first select viable haemocytes followed by flow cytometric morphometric analysis based on the laser scatter properties (forward scatter-FSC and side scatter-SSC). Our findings demonstrated that B. glabrata (BG-BH, highly susceptible to S. mansoni) and 2 strains of B. tenagophila (BT-CF, moderately susceptible and BT-Taim, resistant to S. mansoni) have 3 major circulating haemocyte subsets, referred to as small, medium and large haemocytes. The frequency of small haemocytes was higher in BG-BH, while medium haemocytes were the most abundant cell-type in both B. tenagophila strains. Schistosoma mansoni infection resulted in early reduction of large and medium circulating haemocytes followed by an increase of small haemocytes. Although parasite infection induced haemocyte alterations in all Biomphalaria strains, the response was particularly intense in BT-Taim, the parasite-resistant snail. Interestingly, the trematode infection induces changes in haemocytes with less granular rather than in those with more granular profile. The results indicated that, in B. tenagophila of Taim strain, circulating haemocytes, especially the medium and high subset with less granular profile, are very reactive cells upon S. mansoni infection, suggesting that this cell subset would participate in the early parasite destruction observed in this snail strain.",M1
19125172,"Mefloquine--an aminoalcohol with promising antischistosomal properties in mice.BACKGROUND: The treatment and control of schistosomiasis, an often neglected tropical disease that exacerbates poverty, depends on a single drug, praziquantel. The large-scale use of praziquantel might select for drug-resistant parasites, hence there is a need to develop new antischistosomal compounds. Here, we report that the antimalarial drug mefloquine possesses promising antischistosomal properties in mice. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: A single dose of mefloquine (200 or 400 mg/kg) administered orally to mice infected with adult <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> or adult S. japonicum resulted in high or complete total and female worm burden reductions (72.3%-100%). Importantly, high worm burden reductions were also observed for young developing stages of S. mansoni and S. japonicum harbored in the mouse. Both mefloquine erythro-enantiomers resulted in high and comparable total and female worm burden reductions when given to mice with either a sub-patent or patent S. mansoni infection. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Our findings hold promise for the development of a novel antischistosomal drug based on an aminoalcohol functionality. Further in vitro and in vivo studies have been launched to elucidate the possible mechanism of action and to study the effect of mefloquine on S. haematobium and other trematodes. It will be interesting to investigate whether mefloquine, which is widely and effectively used for the treatment of malaria, has an impact on schistosomiasis in areas where both malaria and schistosomiasis co-exist.",M1
19124604,"The <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> protein Sm16/SmSLP/SmSPO-1 assembles into a nine-subunit oligomer with potential To inhibit Toll-like receptor signaling.The Sm16/SmSLP/SmSPO-1 (Sm16) protein is secreted by the parasite Schistosoma mansoni during skin penetration and has been ascribed immunosuppressive activities. Here we describe the strategy behind the design of a modified Sm16 protein with a decreased aggregation propensity, thus facilitating the expression and purification of an Sm16 protein that is soluble in physiological buffers. The Stokes radii and sedimentation coefficients of recombinant and native proteins indicate that Sm16 is an approximately nine-subunit oligomer. Analysis of truncated Sm16 derivatives showed that both oligomerization and binding to the plasma membrane of human cells depend on multiple C-terminal regions. For analysis of immunomodulatory activities, Sm16 was expressed in Pichia pastoris to facilitate the preparation of a pyrogen/endotoxin-free purified protein. Recombinant Sm16 was found to have no effect on T-lymphocyte activation, cell proliferation, or the basal level of cytokine production by whole human blood or monocytic cells. However, Sm16 exerts potent inhibition of the cytokine response to the Toll-like receptor (TLR) ligands lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and poly(I:C) while being less efficient at inhibiting the response to the TLR ligand peptidoglycan or a synthetic lipopeptide. Since Sm16 specifically inhibits the degradation of the IRAK1 signaling protein in LPS-stimulated monocytes, our findings indicate that inhibition is exerted proximal to the TLR complex.",M1
19104008,"Praziquantel affects the regulatory myosin light chain of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Praziquantel (PZQ) is the drug of choice for schistosomiasis and probably is the only highly effective drug currently available for treating schistosomiasis-infected individuals. The mode of action of PZQ involves increasing the calcium uptake of the parasite, resulting in tegumental damage and death of the parasite. Despite its remarkable function, the target of PZQ has not been identified yet. To begin to understand where PZQ acts, in this study we expressed the cDNA library of Schistosoma mansoni on the surface of T7 bacteriophages and screened this library with labeled PZQ. This procedure identified a clone that strongly bound to PZQ. Subsequent DNA analysis of inserts showed that the clone coded for regulatory myosin light chain protein. The gene was then cloned, and recombinant S. mansoni myosin light chain (SmMLC) was expressed. Immunoblot analysis using antibodies raised to recombinant SmMLC (rSmMLC) showed that SmMLC is abundantly expressed in schistosomula and adult stages compared to the amount in cercarial stages. In vitro analyses also confirmed that PZQ strongly binds to rSmMLC. Further, peptide mapping studies showed that PZQ binds to amino acids 46 to 76 of SmMLC. Immunoprecipitation analysis confirmed that SmMLC is phosphorylated in vivo upon exposure to PZQ. Interestingly, significant levels of anti-SmMLC antibodies were present in vaccinated mice compared to the amount in infected mice, suggesting that SmMLC may be a potential target for protective immunity in schistosomiasis. These findings suggest that PZQ affects SmMLC function, and this may have a role in PZQ action.",M1
19100294,"Towards an understanding of the mechanism of action of praziquantel.Although praziquantel (PZQ) has been used to treat schistosomiasis for over 20 years its mechanism of action remains unknown. We have developed an assay based on the transcriptional response of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> PR-1 to heat shock to confirm that while 6-week post-infection (p.i.) schistosomes are sensitive to PZQ, 4-week p.i. schistosomes are not. Further, we have used this assay to demonstrate that in mice this sensitivity develops between days 37 and 40 p.i. When PZQ is linked to the fluorophore BODIPY to aid microscopic visualization, it appears to enter the cells of intact 4 and 6-week p.i. schistosomes as well as mammalian NIH 3T3 cells with ease suggesting that the differential effects of PZQ is not based on cell exclusion. A transcriptomal analysis of gene expression between 4 and 6 weeks p.i. revealed 607 up-regulated candidate genes whose products are potential PZQ targets. A comparison of this gene list with that of genes expressed by PZQ sensitive miracidia reduced this target list to 247 genes, including a number involved in aerobic metabolism and cytosolic calcium regulation. Finally, we also report the effect of an in vitro sub-lethal exposure of PZQ on the transcriptome of S. mansoni PR-1. Annotation of genes differentially regulated by PZQ exposure suggests that schistosomes may undergo a transcriptomic response similar to that observed during oxidative stress.",M1
19096877,"In vitro schistosomicidal activity of curcumin against <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> adult worms.The in vitro schistosomicidal activity of curcumin (doses ranging from 5 to 100 microM) was carried out against Schistosoma mansoni adult worms. Curcumin (at 50 and 100 microM) caused death of all worms. When tested at the doses of 5 and 20 microM, it decreased the worm viability in comparison with negative (Roswell Memorial Park Institute (RPMI) 1640 medium alone or RPMI 1640 medium with 10% dimethyl sulfoxide) and positive (heat-killed worms at 56 degrees C or praziquantel 10 microM) control groups. All pairs of coupled adult worms were separated into individual male and female by the action of curcumin at the doses of 20 to 100 microM. When tested at 5 and 10 microM, curcumin reduced egg production by 50% in comparison with the positive control group.

19095013,"Proteomic analysis of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> proteins released during in vitro miracidium-to-sporocyst transformation.Free-living miracidia of Schistosoma mansoni, upon penetration of the their snail intermediate host, undergo dramatic morphological and physiological changes as they transform to the parasitic sporocyst stage. During this transformation process, developing larvae release a diverse array of proteins, herein referred to as larval transformation proteins (LTPs), some of which are postulated to serve a parasite protective function. In the present study, nanoLC-tandem MS analysis was performed on all proteins represented in entire 1-dimensional SDS-PAGE-separated samples in order to gain a more comprehensive picture of the protein constituents associated with miracidium-to-sporocyst transformation and thus, their potential role in influencing establishment of intramolluscan infections. Of 127 proteins with sufficient peptide/sequence information, specific identifications were made for 99, while 28 represented unknown or hypothetical proteins. Nineteen percent of identified proteins possessed signal peptides constituting a cohort of classical secretory proteins, while 22% were identified as putative nonclassically secreted leaderless proteins based on SecretomeP analysis. Proteins comprising these groups consisted mainly of proteases/protease inhibitors, small HSPs, redox/antioxidant enzymes, ion-binding proteins including those with anti-oxidant Fe-binding activities (ferritins, heme-binding protein), and venom allergen-like (VAL) proteins. A polyclonal antibody generated against whole LTPs recognized proteins primarily associated with the cilia, ciliated epidermal plates and intercellular ridges of miracidia and the tegument of fully transformed sporocysts, identifying these structures as sources of a subset of LTPs. Thus lysis of plates and/or leakage during formation of the sporocyst syncytium likely represent significant contributors to the overall LTP makeup, especially identified nonsecretory proteins. However, as plate release/degradation and tegument formation are part of the normal developmental process, all LTPs regardless of tissue origin, would be expected at the parasite-host interface upon infection. This study significantly expands the repertoire of LTPs associated with larval transformation and identifies several, e.g., those involved in stress responses, proteolysis/inhibition, antioxidant and detoxication, and immune modulation, that may play a parasite protective role during this crucial period of transition.",M1
19094990,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>: developmental arrest of miracidia treated with histone deacetylase inhibitors.In the present study, we examined the effect of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors trichostatin A (TSA), valproic acid (VA) and sodium-butyrate on the metamorphosis of larvae of the human blood-fluke Schistosoma mansoni from the free-swimming miracidia into the intramolluskal sporocyst. We show that HDAC inhibitors block transformation in concentration dependant manner. TSA reversibly blocks this developmental process: only 13+/-11% of TSA treated miracidia transform into sporocysts in-vitro, compared to 92+/-3% in the mock-treated control. Other enzyme inhibitors such as cycloheximide or hydroxyurea had no effect on metamorphosis. For treatment of up to 4 h, the effect of TSA was completely reversible. Our data indicates that HDAC activity is necessary for the transformation of S. mansoni miracidia during infection of the snail host.",M1

19081261,"Ultrastructural and cytochemical aspects of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> cercaria.An alternative to identify the critical processes necessary to the parasite establishment of the host is to focus on the evolutionary stage responsible for the primary invasion, i.e. the infection structure. The objective of this study was to ultrastructurally characterize Schistosoma mansoni cercariae, using cytochemical techniques. In order to identify basic proteins, techniques such as ethanolic phosphotungstic acid (EPTA) and ammoniacal silver staining were used. Calcium sites location was achieved using the Hepler technique and to evidence anionic groups, we used cationic ferritin particles and enzyme treatment with trypsin Vibrio cholerae, chondroitinase and neuraminidase. The EPTA technique highlighted the presence of basic tegument proteins, nucleus and nucleolus from subtegumental cells, inclusion bodies and preacetabular glands. After using ammoniacal silver, we observed a strong staining in all infective larvae, particularly in the nuclei of muscle cells, circular muscle tissue and preacetabular glands. Calcium site locations were shown to be uniform, thereby limiting the inner spaces of the larvae, especially muscle cells. Samples treated with cationized ferritin particles presented strong staining at the cuticular level. Neuraminidase treatment did not alter the stained shape of such particles on the trematode surface. However, trypsin or chondroitinase treatment resulted in absence of staining on the larval surface. This information on the biochemical composition of the infecting S. mansoni larvae provides data for a better understanding of the biology of this parasite and background on the intriguing parasite-host relationship.",M1
19070522,"Comparative modeling of thioredoxin glutathione reductase from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>: a multifunctional target for antischistosomal therapy.Schistosoma mansoni, a trematode parasite, which causes schistosomiasis and affects more than 200 million people worldwide, lives in an aerobic environment and therefore needs an effective redox mechanism for surviving reactive oxygen species from its host. Although, the host has two different redox systems: glutaredoxin and thioredoxin, the parasite has only one unique multifunctional enzyme, thioredoxin glutathione reductase (TGR) involving a fusion of two proteins, glutaredoxin (Grx) and thioredoxin reductase (TR), for performing all the redox activities. This dependence of S. mansoni on a single protein, TGR, for its protection from oxidative stress, makes it a promising drug target. Here, we describe a suitably validated, homology model for S. mansoni TGR (SmTGR), developed using both TR and Grx templates, functionally complete in the dimeric form with cofactors NADP(H) and FAD. Comparative analysis of substrate and inhibitor binding pockets of our model with crystal structures of parent TR as well as with that of glutathione reductase (GR), which is an essential component of the Grx system, appears to provide greater insight into the functioning of TGR. This also augments recent observations reported on the basis of X-ray structure data on SmTGR monomer lacking the C-terminal selenocysteine tail.",M1
19056448,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> ex vivo lung-stage larvae excretory-secretory antigens as vaccine candidates against schistosomiasis.Schistosoma mansoni lung-stage larvae are known to be the major target of innate and acquired immunity to schistosomiasis. Lung schistosomula cytosolic or surface membrane antigens are hidden, entirely inaccessible to the host immune system, and hence are not particularly important as vaccine candidates. Conversely, excretory-secretory (E-S) products released from intact, viable, elongated, and contractile schistosomula are ideal potential vaccines, as such molecules can readily play a central role in the induction of local primary and memory immune response effectors that would directly target, surround, and pursue the larvae while negotiating the lung capillaries. Therefore, 6-day-old ex vivo larvae were isolated from mouse or hamster lung cells and used for generation of E-S products, which were shown to elicit strong immune responses and significant (P&lt;0.05) protection against challenge infection in BALB/c mice. Proteomic analysis of E-S molecules following 10x concentration and sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis identified peptides related to innumerable host and about 15 S. mansoni-specific proteins. Selected S. mansoni-specific E-S peptides prepared in a multiple antigen peptide (MAP) or recombinant form were shown to stimulate considerable specific antibody response and peripheral blood mononuclear cell expression of mRNA for several cytokines in immunized C57BL/6 and BALB/c mice. However, highly significant (P&lt;0.05 to &lt;0.005) reduction in challenge infection worm burden and egg load was recorded only when the immunization conditions in test mice provided the S. mansoni antigen-specific T helper (Th) type response milieu favorable for each immunogen. That was polarized Th1 for S. mansoni aldolase and thioredoxin peroxidase 1 MAPs, polarized Th2 for recombinant 14-3-3-like protein, mixed Th1/Th17 for calpain MAP, and mixed Th1/Th2 for recombinant p18 protein. The findings together indicated that the immune responses issue is as critical as the nature and source of the antigen for the development of vaccine against schistosomiasis.",M1
19023900,"Therapeutic potential of helminth soluble proteins in TNBS-induced colitis in mice.BACKGROUND: The hygiene hypothesis suggests an inverse relationship between the incidence of parasitic infections and chronic inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD). We investigated the therapeutic potential of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and Ancylostoma caninum soluble proteins on experimental colitis in mice. METHODS: Colitis was induced by intrarectal administration of 10 mg trinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (TNBS) in 30% ethanol. Six hours after TNBS injection, mice were treated intraperitoneally with helminth proteins. Three days later, colonic inflammation was scored based on 5 inflammatory parameters: clinical disease activity, macroscopic and microscopic inflammation score, extent of inflammation, and myeloperoxidase (MPO) activity. To determine immunological pathways induced by S. mansoni proteins we measured cytokine profiles of T-lymphocytes from colon, mesenteric lymph nodes (MLN), and spleen by real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). RESULTS: Control mice showed no signs of inflammation, whereas all inflammatory parameters were significantly increased in mice with colitis. Treatment of mice with colitis with S. mansoni or A. caninum proteins decreased the macroscopic inflammation score, extent of inflammation, and MPO activity. Immunologically, induction of colitis significantly increased expression of IFN-gamma mRNA in the inflamed colon. Treatment with S. mansoni proteins caused a decrease of proinflammatory cytokines (IFN-gamma, IL-17) in colon and MLN, whereas the production of regulatory cytokines (IL-10, TGF-beta) increased significantly in colon tissue. CONCLUSIONS: Treatment with proteins of S. mansoni and A. caninum ameliorated TNBS-induced colitis in mice. S. mansoni proteins increased mRNA expression of regulatory cytokines while suppressing expression of proinflammatory cytokines. Therefore, we suggest a therapeutic potential for helminth proteins in the treatment of IBD.",M1
19019093,"Selective induction of the Notch ligand Jagged-1 in macrophages by soluble egg antigen from <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> involves ERK signalling.Soluble egg antigen (SEA) from the helminth Schistosoma mansoni promotes T helper type 2 (Th2) responses by modulating antigen-presenting cell function. The Jagged/Notch pathway has recently been implicated in driving Th2 development. We show here that SEA rapidly up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of the Notch ligand Jagged-1 in both murine bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs) and human monocyte-derived macrophages (HMDMs). Another potential Th2-promoting factor, interleukin (IL)-33, was not transcriptionally induced by SEA in BMMs. Up-regulation of Jagged-1 mRNA by SEA was also apparent in conventional dendritic cells (DCs), although the effect was less striking than in BMMs. Conversely, SEA-pulsed DCs, but not BMMs, promoted IL-4 production upon T-cell activation, suggesting that Jagged-1 induction alone is insufficient for instructing Th2 development. A comparison of the responses initiated in BMMs by SEA and the bacterial endotoxin lipopolysaccharide (LPS) revealed common activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase-1/2 (ERK-1/2) and p38 phosphorylation, as well as induction of Jagged-1 mRNA. However, only LPS triggered IkappaB degradation, phosphorylation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (Jnk) and signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (Stat1) Tyr701, and IL-33 and IL-12p40 mRNA up-regulation. Inducible gene expression was modified by the presence of the macrophage growth factor colony-stimulating factor (CSF)-1, which inhibited Jagged-1 induction by SEA and LPS, but enhanced LPS-induced IL-12p40 expression. Unlike LPS, SEA robustly activated signalling in HEK293 cells expressing either Toll-like receptor 2 (TLR2) or TLR4/MD2. Pharmacological inhibition of the ERK-1/2 pathway impaired SEA- and LPS-inducible Jagged-1 expression in BMMs. Taken together, our data suggest that Jagged-1 is an ERK-dependent target of TLR signalling that has a macrophage-specific function in the response to SEA.",M1

In these ways, TLR-activated DCs are able to activate naive Th cells and initiate Th1 and Th17 responses, and TLR ligands thus serve as adjuvants for these types of responses. In contrast, products from helminth parasites generally do not activate DCs and act as adjuvants for Th2 response induction. We have explored the underlying basis for this form of adjuvanticity. We show that exposure of DCs to soluble Ags from the eggs of the helminth parasite <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> (schistosome egg Ag (SEA)) leads to the induction of proteolysis of internalized Ag. This occurs in the absence of significant induction of costimulatory molecule expression or production of proinflammatory cytokines. SEA-induced Ag processing occurs independently of MyD88 or Toll/IL-1 receptor domain containing adaptor inducing IFN-beta (Trif), but is significantly attenuated by inhibition of p38, but not ERK, signaling. In DCs exposed to SEA, ligation of CD40 provides a necessary second signal that stimulates costimulatory molecule expression, allowing DCs to mature into capable APCs. Collectively, the data demonstrate the existence of a MyD88/Trif-independent, p38-dependent pathway of Ag processing in DCs, which is uncoupled from conventional DC maturation and is associated with induction of Th2-type immune responses.",M1
19007911,"Preliminary analysis of miRNA pathway in <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.RNA silencing refers to a series of nuclear and cytoplasmatic processes involved in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression or post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS), either by sequence-specific mRNA degradation or by translational arrest. The best characterized small RNAs are microRNAs (miRNAs), which predominantly perform gene silencing through post-transcriptional mechanisms. In this work we used bioinformatic approaches to identify the parasitic trematode Schistosoma mansoni sequences that are similar to enzymes involved in the post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by miRNA pathway. We used amino acid sequences of well-known proteins involved in the miRNA pathway against S. mansoni genome and transcriptome databases identifying a total of 13 putative proteins in the parasite. In addition, the transcript levels of SmDicer1 and SmAgo2/3/4 were identified by qRT-PCR using cercariae, adult worms, eggs and in vitro cultivated schistosomula. Our results showed that the SmDicer1 and SmAgo2/3/4 are differentially expressed during schistosomula development, suggesting that the miRNA pathway is regulated at the transcript level and therefore may control gene expression during the life cycle of S. mansoni.",M1
19002242,"Controlled chaos of polymorphic mucins in a metazoan parasite (<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>) interacting with its invertebrate host (Biomphalaria glabrata).Invertebrates were long thought to possess only a simple, effective and hence non-adaptive defence system against microbial and parasitic attacks. However, recent studies have shown that invertebrate immunity also relies on immune receptors that diversify (e.g. in echinoderms, insects and mollusks (Biomphalaria glabrata)). Apparently, individual or population-based polymorphism-generating mechanisms exists that permit the survival of invertebrate species exposed to parasites. Consequently, the generally accepted arms race hypothesis predicts that molecular diversity and polymorphism also exist in parasites of invertebrates. We investigated the diversity and polymorphism of parasite molecules (Schistosoma mansoni Polymorphic Mucins, SmPoMucs) that are key factors for the compatibility of schistosomes interacting with their host, the mollusc Biomphalaria glabrata. We have elucidated the complex cascade of mechanisms acting both at the genomic level and during expression that confer polymorphism to SmPoMuc. We show that SmPoMuc is coded by a multi-gene family whose members frequently recombine. We show that these genes are transcribed in an individual-specific manner, and that for each gene, multiple splice variants exist. Finally, we reveal the impact of this polymorphism on the SmPoMuc glycosylation status. Our data support the view that S. mansoni has evolved a complex hierarchical system that efficiently generates a high degree of polymorphism-a  controlled chaos -based on a relatively low number of genes. This contrasts with protozoan parasites that generate antigenic variation from large sets of genes such as Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei and Plasmodium falciparum. Our data support the view that the interaction between parasites and their invertebrate hosts are far more complex than previously thought. While most studies in this matter have focused on invertebrate host diversification, we clearly show that diversifying mechanisms also exist on the parasite side of the interaction. Our findings shed new light on how and why invertebrate immunity develops.",M1
18977200,"The class I histone deacetylases of the platyhelminth parasite <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Histone deacetylases (HDAC) form a conserved enzyme family that control gene expression via the removal of acetyl residues from histones and other proteins and are under increasing investigation as therapeutic targets, notably in cancer and parasitic diseases. To investigate the conservation of these enzymes in the platyhelminth parasite Schistosoma mansoni, we cloned and characterized three class I HDACs, orthologues of mammalian HDAC1, 3 and 8, and confirmed their identities by phylogenetic analysis. The identification of an HDAC8 orthologue showed that it is not vertebrate-specific as previously thought and insertions in its catalytic domain suggest specific enzymatic properties. SmHDAC1, 3, and 8 mRNAs are expressed at all schistosome life-cycle stages. SmHDAC1 repressed transcriptional activity in a mammalian cell line and this activity was dependent on its catalytic activity since transcription was partially restored by treatment with trichostatin A and a catalytic site mutant failed to repress transcription.",M1
18973421,"In vitro mitotic responses of the amebocyte-producing organ of Biomphalaria glabrata to extracts of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Amebocyte-producing organs (APOs) of Biomphalaria glabrata were maintained in nonnutritive saline with, or without, extracts of miracidia and adults of Schistosoma mansoni, and examined histologically. The hematopoietic cells remained viable and showed measurable mitotic activity for up to 6 days, with little evidence of tissue death. APOs accumulated fluid and became swollen by as soon as 24 hr, but no cell exomigration was observed. Parasite extracts elicited an increase in the number of dividing cells in the APO, suggesting that the extract may directly stimulate a response from the hematopoietic cells by providing either nutrients or mitogenic growth factors.",M1
20409287,"Spatial co-distribution of neglected tropical diseases in the east African great lakes region: revisiting the justification for integrated control.OBJECTIVE: To determine spatial patterns of co-endemicity of schistosomiasis mansoni and the soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and hookworm in the Great Lakes region of East Africa, to help plan integrated neglected tropical disease programmes in this region. METHOD: Parasitological surveys were conducted in Uganda, Tanzania, Kenya and Burundi in 28 213 children in 404 schools. Bayesian geostatistical models were used to interpolate prevalence of these infections across the study area. Interpolated prevalence maps were overlaid to determine areas of co-endemicity. RESULTS: In the Great Lakes region, prevalence was 18.1% for <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>, 50.0% for hookworm, 6.8% for A. lumbricoides and 6.8% for T. trichiura. Hookworm infection was ubiquitous, whereas S. mansoni, A. lumbricoides and T. trichiura were highly focal. Most areas were endemic (prevalence &gt;or=10%) or hyperendemic (prevalence &gt;or=50%) for one or more STHs, whereas endemic areas for schistosomiasis mansoni were restricted to foci adjacent large perennial water bodies. CONCLUSION: Because of the ubiquity of hookworm, treatment programmes are required for STH throughout the region but efficient schistosomiasis control should only be targeted at limited high-risk areas. Therefore, integration of schistosomiasis with STH control is only indicated in limited foci in East Africa.",M2
20402673,"Homing of transplanted bone marrow cells in livers of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>-infected mice.The efficiency of differentiation of bone marrow cells (BMCs) into hepatocytes in vivo and its importance in physiopathological processes is still debated. Murine schistosomiasis was used as a liver injury model and unfractionated male mice BMCs were transplanted through intrahepatic injection into non-irradiated Schistosoma mansoni-infected female mice on their 16th week post-infection. Two weeks after bone marrow transplantation, mice were sacrificed on a weekly basis until 10 weeks. Tracing of male donor-derived cells in female recipient mice livers was carried out by the detection of Y chromosome expression by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) and also of chromodomain Y-linked (CDYL) protein by indirect immunofluorescence (IF). Their transformation into hepatocytes was studied by double labelling indirect IF using antibodies directed against CDYL and mouse albumin. Histopathological and electron microscopic examinations revealed the presence of small hepatocyte-like cells in the periportal tracts and in between the hepatocytes facing the sinusoids. Donor-derived cells showing Y chromosome by FISH and expressing CDYL protein by IF were recovered in the infected transplanted livers. The initial number of these cells increased with increased post-transplantation time. Cells were mainly localized in the periphery of schistosoma granuloma. Few donor-derived cells appeared within the hepatic parenchymal tissue and showed positivity for albumin secretion by double labelling with IF. We suggest that transplanted bone marrow stem cells can repopulate the Schistosoma-infected liver of immunocompetent mice. Their differentiation is a complex event controlled by many factors and needs to be further characterized extensively. The extent and type of liver injury and the number of transplanted cells are important variables in the process of stem cell engraftment and differentiation into functioning hepatic cells that still need to be defined.",M2
20384867,"Ageing down-modulates liver inflammatory immune responses to schistosome infection in mice.Ageing is associated with several alterations in the immune system. Our aim in this study was to compare the development of immunity to <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection in young versus aged C57Bl/6 mice using the liver as the main organ to evaluate pathological alterations and immune responses. In the acute phase, young mice had large liver granulomas with fibrosis and inflammatory cells. Chronic phase in young animals was associated with immunomodulation of granulomas that became reduced in size and cellular infiltrate. On the other hand, aged animals presented granulomas of smaller sizes already in the acute phase. Chronic infection in these mice was followed by no alteration in any of the inflammatory parameters in the liver. In concert with this finding, there was an increase in activated CD4+ T, CD19+ B and NK liver cells in young mice after infection whereas old mice had already higher frequencies of activated B, NK and CD4+ T liver cells and infection does not change these frequencies. After infection, liver production of inflammatory and regulatory cytokines such as IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 increased in young but not in old mice that had high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 regardless of their infection status. Our data suggest that the unspecific activation status of the immune system in aged mice impairs inflammatory as well as regulatory immune responses to S. mansoni infection in the liver, where major pathological alterations and immunity are at stage. This poor immune reactivity may have a beneficial impact on disease development.",M2
20363433,"Small-bowel lesions caused by portal hypertension of schistosomal origin: a capsule endoscopy pilot study.BACKGROUND: Schistosomiasis is a highly prevalent disease. It can evolve to its hepatosplenic form in up to 10% of the cases. The small-bowel lesions developed during the hepatosplenic stage of the disease have not been described in vivo. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to describe, for the first time, in a pilot study, the endoscopic aspects of the lesions in the small bowel of patients with portal hypertension due to schistosomiasis, using the PillCam SB, and to determine the usefulness of the method for the diagnosis of esophageal varices. DESIGN: Case series. SETTING: Tertiary-care medical center. PATIENTS: Nine nonrandomized patients with hepatosplenic schistosomiasis and esophageal varices without previous GI bleeding were selected based on findings from the PillCam SB. Patients using medications that could alter the coagulation, with history of abdominal surgery, who were undergoing treatment of the portal hypertension other than beta-blocker, and with symptoms suggesting bowel obstruction were excluded. The findings were interpreted by a single endoscopist. RESULTS: Capsule endoscopy was able to diagnose esophageal varices in all 9 patients. All of the patients presented angioectasias and venectasias in the small bowel. Small-bowel varices were present in 22.2% of the patients; edema and erosions were found in 66.7% and 88.9%, respectively. Lesions of so-called  scarred mucosa  were found in 55.5% of the patients. LIMITATIONS: Small number of patients; case series. CONCLUSION: The PillCam SB was effective, giving a significant contribution to the description of the esophageal varices and small-bowel lesions of the patients with portal hypertension caused by <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.",M2
20360135,"IL-4R{alpha}-responsive smooth muscle cells increase intestinal hypercontractility and contribute to resistance during acute Schistosomiasis.Interleukin-(IL)-4 and IL-13 signal through heterodimeric receptors containing a common IL-4 receptor-alpha (IL-4Ralpha) subunit, which is important for protection against helminth infections, including schistosomiasis. Previous studies demonstrated important roles for IL-4Ralpha-responsive hematopoietic cells, including T cells and macrophages in schistosomiasis. In this study, we examined the role of IL-4Ralpha responsiveness by nonhematopoietic smooth muscle cells during experimental acute murine schistosomiasis. Comparative <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection studies with smooth muscle cell-specific IL-4Ralpha-deficient (SM-MHC(cre)IL-4Ralpha(-/flox)) mice, heterozygous control (IL-4Ralpha(-/flox)) mice, and global IL-4Ralpha-deficient (IL-4Ralpha(-/-)) mice were conducted. S. mansoni-infected SM-MHC(cre)IL-4Ralpha(-/flox) mice showed increased weight loss and earlier mortalities compared with IL-4Ralpha(-/flox) mice, despite comparable T(H)2/type 2 immune responses. In contrast to highly susceptible IL-4Ralpha-deficient mice, increased susceptibility in SM-MHC(cre)IL-4Ralpha(-/flox) mice was not accompanied by intestinal tissue damage and subsequent sepsis. However, both susceptible mutant mouse strains failed to efficiently expel eggs, demonstrated by egg reduction in the feces compared with control mice. Reduced egg expulsion was accompanied by impaired IL-4/IL-13-mediated hypercontractile intestinal responses, which was present in the more resistant control mice. Together, we conclude that IL-4Ralpha responsiveness by smooth muscle cells and subsequent IL-4- and IL-13-mediated hypercontractility are required for host protection during acute schistosomiasis to efficiently expel S. mansoni eggs and to prevent premature mortality.",M2
20220096,"Redundant and pathogenic roles for IL-22 in mycobacterial, protozoan, and helminth infections.IL-22 is a member of the IL-10 cytokine family and signals through a heterodimeric receptor composed of the common IL-10R2 subunit and the IL-22R subunit. IL-10 and IL-22 both activate the STAT3 signaling pathway; however, in contrast to IL-10, relatively little is known about IL-22 in the host response to infection. In this study, using IL-22(-/-) mice, neutralizing Abs to IL-22, or both, we show that IL-22 is dispensable for the development of immunity to the opportunistic pathogens Toxoplasma gondii and Mycobacterium avium when administered via the i.p. or i.v. route, respectively. IL-22 also played little to no role in aerosol infections with Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in granuloma formation and hepatic fibrosis following chronic percutaneous infections with the helminth parasite <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>. A marked pathogenic role for IL-22 was, however, identified in toxoplasmosis when infections were established by the natural oral route. Anti-IL-22 Ab-treated mice developed significantly less intestinal pathology than control Ab-treated mice even though both groups displayed similar parasite burdens. The decreased gut pathology was associated with reduced IL-17A, IL-17F, TNF-alpha, and IFN-gamma expression. In contrast to the prior observations of IL-22 protective effects in the gut, these distinct findings with oral T. gondii infection demonstrate that IL-22 also has the potential to contribute to pathogenic inflammation in the intestine. The IL-22 pathway has emerged as a possible target for control of inflammation in certain autoimmune diseases. Our findings suggest that few if any infectious complications would be expected with the suppression of IL-22 signaling.",M2
20181883,"Matrix metalloproteinase 12-deficiency augments extracellular matrix degrading metalloproteinases and attenuates IL-13-dependent fibrosis.Infection with the parasitic helminth <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> causes significant liver fibrosis and extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling. Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are important regulators of the ECM by regulating cellular inflammation, extracellular matrix deposition, and tissue reorganization. MMP12 is a macrophage-secreted elastase that is highly induced in the liver and lung in response to S. mansoni eggs, confirmed by both DNA microarray and real-time PCR analysis. However, the function of MMP12 in chronic helminth-induced inflammation and fibrosis is unclear. In this study, we reveal that MMP12 acts as a potent inducer of inflammation and fibrosis after infection with the helminth parasite S. mansoni. Surprisingly, the reduction in liver and lung fibrosis in MMP12-deficient mice was not associated with significant changes in cytokine, chemokine, TGF-beta1, or tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinase expression. Instead, we observed marked increases in MMP2 and MMP13 expression, suggesting that Mmp12 was promoting fibrosis by limiting the expression of specific ECM-degrading MMPs. Interestingly, like MMP12, MMP13 expression was highly dependent on IL-13 and type II-IL-4 receptor signaling. However, in contrast to MMP12, expression of MMP13 was significantly suppressed by the endogenous IL-13 decoy receptor, IL-13Ralpha2. In the absence of MMP12, expression of IL-13Ralpha2 was significantly reduced, providing a possible explanation for the increased IL-13-driven MMP13 activity and reduced fibrosis. As such, these data suggest important counter-regulatory roles between MMP12 and ECM-degrading enzymes like MMP2, MMP9, and MMP13 in Th2 cytokine-driven fibrosis.",M2
20051114,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection reduces the incidence of murine cerebral malaria.BACKGROUND: Plasmodium and Schistosoma are two of the most common parasites in tropical areas. Deregulation of the immune response to Plasmodium falciparum, characterized by a Th1 response, leads to cerebral malaria (CM), while a Th2 response accompanies chronic schistosomiasis. METHODS: The development of CM was examined in mice with concomitant Schistosoma mansoni and Plasmodium berghei ANKA infections. The effect of S. mansoni egg antigen injection on disease development and survival was also determined. Cytokine serum levels were estimated using ELISA. Statistical analysis was performed using t-test. RESULTS: The results demonstrate that concomitant S. mansoni and P. berghei ANKA infection leads to a reduction in CM. This effect is dependent on infection schedule and infecting cercariae number, and is correlated with a Th2 response. Schistosomal egg antigen injection delays the death of Plasmodium-infected mice, indicating immune involvement. CONCLUSIONS: This research supports previous claims of a protective effect of helminth infection on CM development. The presence of multiple parasitic infections in patients from endemic areas should therefore be carefully noted in clinical trials, and in the development of standard treatment protocols for malaria. Defined helminth antigens may be considered for alleviation of immunopathological symptoms.",M2
19933830,"Differential patterns of liver proteins in experimental murine hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> eggs produced by adult worms in the mesenteric vasculature become trapped in the liver, where they induce granulomatous lesions and strong immune responses. Infected individuals suffer from intestinal schistosomiasis (INT) in 90% of cases, whereas the remaining 10% present with severe hepatosplenic schistosomiasis (HS). The CBA/J mouse model mimics human disease, with 20% of infected mice developing hypersplenomegaly syndrome (HSS) that resembles HS and 80% developing moderate splenomegaly syndrome (MSS) similar to INT. We studied differential patterns of protein expression in livers of 20-week-infected CBA/J mice with MSS or HSS to understand the molecular changes that underlie these two disease forms. Using differential in-gel electrophoresis to identify differentially expressed protein spots, we found 80 protein spots significantly changed with infection and 35 changes specific to severe disease. In particular, the abundances of prohibitin 2, transferrin isoforms, and major urinary protein isoforms were significantly altered in HSS mice. Furthermore, annexin 5, glutathione S-transferase pi class, and S. mansoni phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase expression levels changed significantly with schistosome infection. Additionally, levels of major urinary protein decreased and levels of transferrin increased significantly in the sera of HSS mice compared to levels in sera of MSS or control mice, and these differences correlated to the degree of splenomegaly. These findings indicate that the liver protein abundances differ between MSS and HSS mice and may be used for the development of diagnostic markers for the early detection of hepatosplenic schistosomiasis.",M2
19908189,"Intestinal schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis in Ugandan schoolchildren: a rapid mapping assessment.Even with a national control programme in place, intestinal schistosomiasis continues to be a major public health problem in school-aged children and other community members in Uganda. This is especially the case in the environments around the Great Lakes, where disease transmission is high, such as Lake Victoria. Moreover, in the most remote areas, some schools might periodically miss large-scale drug administrations owing to inaccessibility. To provide contemporary monitoring and surveillance data, 27 schools along the lakeshore were surveyed with a rapid assessment protocol to determine both prevalence and intensity of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and soil-transmitted helminth infections. In total, 25 (92.6%) of schools were positive for S. mansoni, with an average prevalence across the surveyed children of 42% and average infection intensity of 634 eggs per gram of faeces. Mean prevalence of Trichuris trichiura, Ascaris lumbricoides and hookworm was 12.9%, 9.3% and 2.4%, respectively. Results from questionnaire data revealed a high level of itinerancy among the children, and a total of 38.2% reported to have never received treatment for schistosomiasis, despite 96% living in districts targeted by the national control programme. A birthplace outside of Uganda was a significant predictor for increased risk of schistosomiasis infection (odds ratio (OR) = 9.6), and being resident at a school for less than a year was significantly associated with absence of praziquantel treatment (OR = 0.3). Univariate regression analysis showed a trend of increasing schistosomiasis towards the eastern region of Uganda, while semivariograms of infection prevalence demonstrated a range of spatial autocorrelation of ~78 km. Soil-transmitted helminth infections were more common in the Western region. Our results emphasise how social and demographic variables such as migration may affect epidemiological trends and confound the impact of existing treatment regimes.",M2
19861614,"Geographic distribution and prevalence of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths among schoolchildren in Mozambique.Schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminths (STHs) are most prevalent in developing countries. In Mozambique, the first and only national survey of the distribution and prevalence of schistosomiasis and STHs was conducted in 1952 and 1957. Only occasional surveys in restricted areas have been conducted since the 1950s. The objective of our survey was to update information on the geographic distribution and prevalence of schistosomiasis and STHs in this country. During August 2005-June 2007, the Schistosomiasis and STH Laboratory of National Institutes of Health of the Ministry of Health undertook an epidemiologic survey among schoolchildren. A total of 83,331 persons attending primary schools were sampled. The mean age was 11.36 years (range: 7-22 years). Stool and urine samples were collected and examined by using Kato-Katz and filtration and Ritchie and Willis techniques. Results indicate a widespread occurrence of Schistosoma haematobium (overall prevalence = 47.0%) and STHs (prevalence = 53.5%). Prevalence varied dramatically across the country, with the highest prevalence in districts in northern provinces (Cabo Delgado, Niassa, Nampula, and Zambezia) and in certain provincial capital cities. Districts in the southern region of the country were less affected. <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> was less common, with prevalence of 1%. We conclude that schistosomiasis and STHs are widely distributed in Mozambique and confirm the need for a national helminth control program.",M2
19845954,"Analysis of regulatory protease sequences identified through bioinformatic data mining of the <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> genome.BACKGROUND: New chemotherapeutic agents against Schistosoma mansoni, an etiological agent of human schistosomiasis, are a priority due to the emerging drug resistance and the inability of current drug treatments to prevent reinfection. Proteases have been under scrutiny as targets of immunological or chemotherapeutic anti-Schistosoma agents because of their vital role in many stages of the parasitic life cycle. Function has been established for only a handful of identified S. mansoni proteases, and the vast majority of these are the digestive proteases; very few of the conserved classes of regulatory proteases have been identified from Schistosoma species, despite their vital role in numerous cellular processes. To that end, we identified protease protein coding genes from the S. mansoni genome project and EST library. RESULTS: We identified 255 protease sequences from five catalytic classes using predicted proteins of the S. mansoni genome. The vast majority of these show significant similarity to proteins in KEGG and the Conserved Domain Database. Proteases include calpains, caspases, cytosolic and mitochondrial signal peptidases, proteases that interact with ubiquitin and ubiquitin-like molecules, and proteases that perform regulated intramembrane proteolysis. Comparative analysis of classes of important regulatory proteases find conserved active site domains, and where appropriate, signal peptides and transmembrane helices. Phylogenetic analysis provides support for inferring functional divergence among regulatory aspartic, cysteine, and serine proteases. CONCLUSION: Numerous proteases are identified for the first time in S. mansoni. We characterized important regulatory proteases and focus analysis on these proteases to complement the growing knowledge base of digestive proteases. This work provides a foundation for expanding knowledge of proteases in Schistosoma species and examining their diverse function and potential as targets for new chemotherapies.",M2
19818465,"Health implications of chronic hepatosplenomegaly in Kenyan school-aged children chronically exposed to malarial infections and <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.Hepatosplenomegaly among school-aged children in sub-Saharan Africa is highly prevalent. Two of the more common aetiological agents of hepatosplenomegaly, namely chronic exposure to malaria and Schistosoma mansoni infection, can result in similar clinical presentation, with the liver and spleen being chronically enlarged and of a firm consistency. Where co-endemic, the two parasites are thought to synergistically exacerbate hepatosplenomegaly. Here, two potential health consequences, i.e. dilation of the portal vein (indicative of increased portal pressure) and stunting of growth, were investigated in a study area where children were chronically exposed to malaria throughout while S. mansoni transmission was geographically restricted. Hepatosplenomegaly was associated with increased portal vein diameters, with enlargement of the spleen rather than the liver being more closely associated with dilation. Dilation of the portal vein was exacerbated by S. mansoni infection in an intensity-dependent manner. The prevalence of growth stunting was not associated with either relative exposure rates to malarial infection or with S. mansoni infection status but was significantly associated with hepatosplenomegaly. Children who presented with hepatosplenomegaly had the lowest height-for-age Z-scores. This study shows that hepatosplenomegaly associated with chronic exposure to malaria and schistosomiasis is not a benign symptom amongst school-aged children but has potential long-term health consequences.",M2
19781518,"Slight activation of nuclear factor kappa-B is associated with increased hepatic stellate cell apoptosis in human schistosomal fibrosis.To investigate the relationship between NF-kappaB activation and hepatic stellate cell (HSC) apoptosis in hepatosplenic schistosomiasis, hepatic biopsies from patients with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>-induced periportal fibrosis, hepatitis C virus-induced cirrhosis, and normal liver were submitted to alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) and NF-kappaB p65 immunohistochemistry, as well as to NF-kappaB Southwestern histochemistry and TUNEL assay. The numbers of alpha-SMA-positive cells and NF-kappaB- and NF-kappaB p65-positive HSC nuclei were reduced in schistosomal fibrosis relative to liver cirrhosis. In addition, increased HSC NF-kappaB p65 and TUNEL labeling was observed in schistosomiasis when compared to cirrhosis.These results suggest a possible relationship between the slight activation of the NF-kappaB complex and the increase of apoptotic HSC number in schistosome-induced fibrosis, taking place to a reduced HSC number in schistosomiasis in relation to liver cirrhosis. Therefore, the NF-kappaB pathway may constitute an important down-regulatory mechanism in the pathogenesis of human schistosomiasis mansoni, although further studies are needed to refine the understanding of this process.",M2
19738986,"Effect of praziquantel administration on hepatic stereology of mice infected with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and fed a low-protein diet.A study was undertaken to investigate the effect of administering praziquantel (PZQ), focusing on the liver stereological findings of malnourished mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni. Thirty female Swiss Webster mice (age: 21 days; weight: 8-14 g) were fed either a low-protein diet (8%) or standard chow (22% protein) for 15 days. Five mice in each group were infected with 50 cercariae each of the BH strain (Brazil). PZQ therapy (80 mg/kg body weight, per day) was started on the 50th day of infection and consisted of daily administration for 5 days. Volume density (hepatocytes, sinusoids and hepatic fibrosis) was determined by stereology using a light microscope. Body weight gain and total serum albumin levels were always lower in undernourished mice. Our stereological study demonstrated that treatment increased both volume density of hepatocytes in mice fed standard chow (47.56%, treated group and 12.06%, control) and low-protein chow (30.98%, treated group and 21.44%, control), and hepatic sinusoids [standard chow (12.52%, treated group and 9.06%, control), low-protein chow (14.42%, treated group and 8.46%, control)], while hepatic fibrosis was reduced [standard chow (39.92%, treated group and 78.88%, control) and low-protein chow (54.60%, treated group and 70.10%, control)]. On the other hand, mice fed low-protein chow decreased density volume of hepatocytes and hepatic fibrosis. In conclusion, our findings indicate that treatment with PZQ ameliorates hepatic schistosomiasis pathology even in mice fed a low-protein diet.",M2
19722085,"High fat diet has a prominent effect upon the course of chronic schistosomiasis mansoni in mice.This study investigated whether a long-term high-fat diet has an effect on the outcome of chronic murine schistosomiasis mansoni compared to a standard diet. Swiss Webster female mice (3 weeks old) were fed each diet for up to six months and were then infected with 50 <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> cercariae. Their nutritional status was assessed by monitoring total serum cholesterol and body mass. Infected mice were examined 6-17 weeks post infection to estimate the number of eggs in faeces. Mice were euthanised the next day. Total serum cholesterol was lower in infected mice in comparison to uninfected controls (p = 0.0055). In contrast, body mass (p = 0.003), liver volume (p = 0.0405), spleen volume (p = 0.0124), lung volume (p = 0.0033) and faecal (p = 0.0064) and tissue egg density (p = 0.0002) were significantly higher for infected mice fed a high-fat diet. From these findings, it is suggested that a high-fat diet has a prominent effect on the course of chronic schistosomiasis mansoni in mice.",M2

Developing schistosomula elicited increase in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) mRNA expression and/or plasma levels of IL-4, IL-17, and interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), cytokines known to antagonize each other, resulting in impaired Th1/Th2, and Th17 immune responses and parasite evasion. Mice treated with TGF-beta showed elevated PBMC mRNA expression of IL-6, IL-17, TGF-beta, and TNF-alpha mRNA and increased IL-23 and IL-17 or TGF-beta plasma levels, associated with significantly (P&lt;0.02-&lt;0.0001) lower S. mansoni adult worm burden compared to controls in both mouse strains, thus suggesting that TGF-beta led to heightened Th17 responses that mediated resistance to the infection. Mice treated with antibody to TGF-beta showed increase in PBMC mRNA expression and plasma levels of IL-4, IL-12p70, and IFN-gamma, and significantly (P&lt;0.02 and &lt;0.0001) reduced worm burden and liver worm egg counts than untreated mice, indicating that Th1/Th2 immune responses were potentiated, resulting in significant innate resistance to schistosomiasis. The implications of these observations for schistosome immune evasion and vaccination were discussed.",M2
19686417,"Propranolol reduces variceal pressure and wall tension in schistosomiasis presinusoidal portal hypertension.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Although prophylaxis with beta-blockers has been shown to decrease variceal pressure and wall tension in cirrhotic patients, this has not been demonstrated in non-cirrhotic portal hypertension caused by <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection. METHODS: Thirteen patients without history of previous gastrointestinal bleeding were included. All of them had high-risk esophageal varices at endoscopy. An endoscopic gauge and a high-frequency endoscopic ultrasonography miniprobe were used to assess transmural variceal pressure and wall tension before and after achieving beta-blockade with propranolol. RESULTS: Baseline variceal pressure decreased from 13.3 +/- 3.5 to 8.2 +/- 2.0 mmHg (P &lt; 0.0001) and wall tension from 500.2 +/- 279.8 to 274.0 +/- 108.3 mg.mm(-1). The overall effect of propranolol on decreasing variceal pressure and wall tension expressed in percentage change in relation to baseline values was 35.7 +/- 18.4% and 35.9 +/- 26.7%, respectively (P = 0.9993). CONCLUSION: Propranolol significantly reduced variceal pressure and wall tension in schistosomiasis.",M2
19675160,"Genetic control of severe egg-induced immunopathology and IL-17 production in murine schistosomiasis.Infection with the trematode parasite <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> results in a distinct heterogeneity of disease severity, both in humans and in an experimental mouse model. Severe disease is characterized by pronounced hepatic egg-induced granulomatous inflammation in a proinflammatory cytokine environment, whereas mild disease corresponds with reduced hepatic inflammation in a Th2 skewed cytokine environment. This marked heterogeneity indicates that genetic differences play a significant role in disease development, yet little is known about the genetic basis of dissimilar immunopathology. To investigate the role of genetic susceptibility in murine schistosomiasis, quantitative trait loci analysis was performed on F(2) progeny derived from SJL/J and C57BL/6 mice, which develop severe and mild pathology, respectively. In this study, we show that severe liver pathology in F(2) mice 7 wk after infection significantly correlated with an increase in the production of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-17, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha by schistosome egg Ag-stimulated mesenteric lymph node cells. Quantitative trait loci analysis identified several genetic intervals controlling immunopathology as well as IL-17 and IFN-gamma production. Egg granuloma size exhibited significant linkage to two loci, D4Mit203 and D17Mit82, both of which were inherited in a BL/6 dominant manner. Furthermore, a significant reduction of hepatic granulomatous inflammation and IL-17 production in interval-specific congenic mice demonstrated that the two identified genetic loci have a decisive effect on the development of immunopathology in murine schistosomiasis.",M2

19646208,"Relative imbalance between T regulatory cells and activated T cells in mice with differential morbidity in chronic <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infections.Chronic (20-week) Schistosoma mansoni infections of CBA/J male mice present as two distinct forms of morbidity. Most mice develop moderate splenomegaly syndrome (MSS) resembling the intestinal form of chronic human schistosomiasis mansoni, while approximately 20% of mice develop hypersplenomegaly syndrome (HSS), more consistent with the severe hepatosplenic form of chronic human schistosomiasis mansoni. Here, we report the relative proportions of natural T regulatory cells (Treg) and activated CD4(+) T cells (Tact) for both splenic and granulomatous cell populations of MSS and HSS mice. Proportions of both Treg and Tact are greater in HSS than MSS mice. However, the ratios of Treg to Tact in both splenic and granulomatous cell populations from MSS mice are significantly higher than those of HSS mice. For both HSS and MSS mice, in vitro proliferation of their CD3(+) splenic cells induced by soluble egg antigens is inversely correlated with the ratio of Treg to Tact. Also, spleen or granuloma cells from MSS mice produced higher mean levels of IFN-gamma than those from HSS mice. Differential IFN-gamma productive capacities dictated by Treg : Tact ratios may contribute to the development of differential morbidities in this model of chronic experimental schistosomiasis mansoni.",M2

19555400,"Interleukin-10 promoter polymorphisms in hepatitis C patients with and without <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> co-infection.BACKGROUND/AIM: Interleukin (IL-10) plays a major role in chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) disease pathogenesis, in particular in Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) co-infected patients. Given that interindividual variations in IL-10 production are influenced by functional polymorphisms in the IL-10 gene promoter, we determined the frequencies of common (-1082, -819 and -592) IL-10 promoter polymorphisms in chronic HCV patients with and without S. mansoni co-infection and healthy controls, and investigated their association with the degree of histological activity index (HAI) and response to interferon-ribavirin therapy. METHODS: Genomic DNA from 99 patients and 62 healthy controls, born in the same geographical hyperendemic area, was studied by the polymerase chain reaction, followed by restriction enzyme digestion. Sera were assessed for S. mansoni antibodies. RESULTS: The frequencies of IL-10 polymorphisms at positions -1082, -819 and -592 from the transcription start site were comparable between HCV patients and controls, as well as between HCV mono-infected and either S. mansoni co-infected patients or controls. The grade of inflammation and the stage of fibrosis showed no association with IL-10 polymorphisms. The frequencies of S. mansoni co-infection and IL-10 genotypes/haplotypes were insignificantly different between non-responders and responders to combination therapy. No effect of other factors like age, gender, HAI group scores and serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels was observed on response to therapy in our patients. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that common IL-10 (-1082, -819 and -592) genotypes/haplotypes do not influence the degree of HAI and response to combination therapy or susceptibility to HCV infection with and without S. mansoni co-infection.",M2
19547860,"Pseudotumoral presentation of chronic pulmonary schistosomiasis without pulmonary hypertension.Schistosomiasis is a disease that, in Brazil, is caused by <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and is transmitted by snails of the genus Biomphalaria. This species occurs in Africa, the Antilles and South America. The parasite, developing to the adult stage in the vascular system of the host, migrates to the mesenteric veins. Each female lays approximately 400 eggs per day, and these travel from the submucosa to the intestinal lumen. There have been reported cases in which S. mansoni eggs were identified in the lungs of patients with no evidence of liver fibrosis. We report a case with this atypical presentation of the disease. The patient presented nonpleuritic chest pain, significant weight loss and dry cough. A CT scan revealed an irregular tumor in the left lower lobe. However, a lung biopsy revealed non-viable S. mansoni eggs. The patient presented no clinical signs of pulmonary or portal hypertension; nor was either identified through diagnostic tests.",M2

19414799,"Regulation of helminth-induced Th2 responses by thymic stromal lymphopoietin.Thymic stromal lymphopoietin was recently identified as a master switch for the development of allergen-driven Th2 responses. However, the role of thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP) in the development of helminth-induced Th2 responses is unclear. Here, using TSLPR(-/-) mice, we show that while TSLPR signaling participates in the development of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> egg-induced CD4(+) Th2 responses, it plays only a transient role in the development of Th2-dependent pathology in the lung, liver, and intestine. Studies conducted in a pulmonary granuloma model showed that while a reduction in IL-4/IL-13-dependent granulomatous inflammation and tissue eosinophilia was observed in TSLPR(-/-) mice undergoing a primary response, lesion formation was not affected during a secondary granulomatous response, even though IL-5 and IL-13 were modestly reduced in the knockout mice. To evaluate the importance of TSLPR signaling in the development of a chronic Th2-dependent response, TSLPR(-/-) mice were also infected with S. mansoni cercariae. Here, the only significant difference noted in TSLPR(-/-) mice was a modest decrease in liver fibrosis in acutely infected animals. The transient decrease in fibrosis was associated with increased production of the antifibrotic cytokine IFN-gamma and decreased production of the profibrotic cytokine IL-13. Although the altered cytokine response persisted in chronically infected TSLPR(-/-) mice, it failed to reduce granuloma formation or fibrosis, confirming that TSLPR signaling plays a limited role in the development of chronic Th2-dependent pathology. Collectively, these findings suggest that while TSLPR signaling serves a key role in allergen-driven Th2 responses, it exerts minor regulatory activity during this chronic helminth infection.",M2
19413209,"Effect of seasonal rainfall and other environmental changes, on snail density and infection rates with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> fifteen years after the last snails' study in Kigungu, Entebbe, Uganda.BACKGROUND: The last study on snail population density in relation to rainfall pattern in Kigungu canoe landing and recreational sites on Lake Victoria shore was earlier carried out about fifteen years ago. This study also reviewed the influence of other environmental factors on the snails' infection rate. OBJECTIVE: To reassess the density dynamic of Biomphalaria (B) choanomphala and Biomphalaria (B) pfeifferi, which act as the intermediate host for S. mansoni and Bulinus (B) globosus, and Bulinus (B) tropicus, which act as intermediate host for S. haematobium. DESIGN: Retrospective study. SETTING: Busy canoe landing sites along Lake Victoria in Kigungu fishing village were selected for the snail sampling. RESULTS: Nine thousand one hundred and ninety four B. choanomphala were collected over the study period. The numbers of B. choanomphala collected in each yearwas 4742 (51.6%) and 4452 (48.4%) in 2004 and 2005 respectively. Of the 4742 B. Choanomphala collected in 2004, 82 (1.7%) shed human cercariae and 329 (6.7%) shed non-human cercariae. Whereas in 2005, out of 4452 B. choanomphala collected 302 (6.85%) shed non-human cercariae and 82 (1.8%) shed human cercariae. Similarly, 4173 B. pfeifferi were also collected in the same period. Out of which 2224 (53.3%) were collected in 2004 and 1949 (46.7%) in 2005. For B. pfeifferi, 42 (1.9%) out of 2224 snails collected in 2004 shed human cercariae and 246 (11.1%) shed non-human cercariae. While in 2005, 33 out of 1949 snails (1.7%) shed human cercariae and 159 (8.2%) shed non-human cercariae. Other snails of medical importance collected included 292 B. globosus and 3094 B. tropicus. None of the Bulinus spp. collected shed any human cercariae but 37 (2.1%) and 30 (2.3%) B. tropicus shed non-human cercariae in 2004 and 2005 respectively. In 2004 and 2005, the area received, 1729mm and 1959mm of rainfall respectively, The mean rainfall during the year was 144.05 mm and 163.3 mm in 2004 and 2005 respectively. There was a negative correlation between rainfalls and snail density dynamic. CONCLUSION: We have found in this study that in spite of the bush clearing of the papyrus swamps which originally was the major habitats for B. choanomphala, B. pfeifferi and the Bulinus spp the intermediate host for schistosome at all canoe landing sites at Kigungu, these snails are still present. Moreover, that their population density dynamic and infection rate are inversely proportional to the rainfall pattern.",M2
19366621,"Plasmodium yoelii: adverse outcome of non-lethal P. yoelii malaria during co-infection with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in BALB/c mouse model.Plasmodium yoelii and Schistosoma mansoni co-infections were studied in female BALB/c mice aged 4-6 weeks to determine the effect of time and stage of concomitant infections on malaria disease outcome. Patent S. mansoni infection in BALB/c mice increased malaria peak parasitemia and caused death from an otherwise non-lethal, self-resolving P. yoelii malaria infection. Exacerbation of malaria parasitemia occurred during both pre-patent and patent S. mansoni infection resulting in a delay of 4-8 days in malaria parasite resolution in co-infected mice. Praziquantel administered to mice with patent schistosome infection protected from fatal outcome during co-infection. However, this treatment did not completely clear the worm infestation, nor did it reduce the peak malaria parasitemia reached, which was nonetheless resolved completely. Hepatosplenomegaly was more marked in schistosome and malaria co-infected mice compared to either infection separately. The results suggest a complex relationship between schistosome co-infection and malaria disease outcome in which the timing of malaria infection in relation to schistosome acquisition is critical to disease outcome and pathology.",M2
19222824,"Impact of intense, longitudinal retreatment with praziquantel on cure rates of schistosomiasis mansoni in a cohort of occupationally exposed adults in western Kenya.OBJECTIVE: To investigate trends in the efficacy of praziquantel (PZQ) suggestive of the emergence of drug resistance against <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection after 12.5 years of intense, repeated use in a small geographic area along the shores of Lake Victoria. METHODS: As part of a longitudinal study, 178 men occupationally exposed to schistosomes were repeatedly tested for S. mansoni infection at 4- to 6-week intervals and treated with PZQ at each reinfection. We compared cure rates by year of study and examined factors associated with cure failure in a multivariate logistic regression model. RESULTS: Overall, the cure rate after a single dose of PZQ was 66%, ranging annually from 36% to 82%. In multivariate analysis, failure to cure after 1 PZQ dose was significantly associated with high intensity of infection and having fewer previous exposures to dying worms. Even after adjustment for these factors, treatments administered in 2006 were significantly more likely to result in cure failures than treatments administered in 2004, the year in which PZQ efficacy was highest. While cure rates varied over the course of 12 years, there was no consistent downward trend towards decreased efficacy over time. In years for which malacological data were available, periods of low PZQ efficacy coincide with high rates of S. mansoni infection in nearby snail populations. CONCLUSION: We did not find a pattern of cure failures consistent with development of clinical resistance to PZQ in our intensely treated cohort.",M2
19212127,"Neuroimmunoendocrine modulation in the host by helminth parasites: a novel form of host-parasite coevolution?Helminth parasites have evolved diverse molecular mechanisms that facilitate their establishment, growth and reproduction inside an immunologically hostile environment. Thus, the physiological interactions during the course of the immune response to helminths are complex. Infection induces antigen-specific recognition by the immune system, which is consequently charged with the responsibility of marshalling the appropriate effector responses necessary to destroy the parasite, or at the very least inhibit its progression. Obviously, the immune system should accomplish this task while minimizing collateral damage to the host. As our understanding of the neuroendocrine system grows, it has become increasingly clear that this complex network of neurotransmitters, hormones, and cytokines plays an important role in mediating immunity. Helminths present an especially complex relationship between pathogen and these physiological systems, with hormonally dependent host factors such as sex and age correlated with parasite success. On top of the effect that this particular type of parasites may have on the invaded host, recent experimental evidence suggests that helminth parasites not only actively evade immune response, but are also able to exploit the hormonal microenvironment within their host to favor their establishment, growth and reproduction. This complex strategy of host-parasite relationship is much better exemplified by two helminth parasites: the trematode <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and the cestode Taenia crassiceps that respond to adrenal steroids and sexual steroids, respectively. Understanding how the host endocrine system can under certain circumstances favor the establishment of a parasitic infection opens interesting perspectives into the host-parasite relationship field.",M2
19149778,"Altered antibody responses in mannose-binding lectin-A deficient mice do not affect Trichuris muris or <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infections.Parasitic helminths possess surface glycoconjugates that are recognized by the serum collectin molecule, mannose-binding lectin (MBL). Once bound, MBL triggers the lectin pathway of complement. Mice have two MBL, MBL-A and MBL-C. We previously showed that MBL-A deficient (MBL-A(-/-)) mice have enhanced survival of Brugia malayi microfilariae and abrogated microfilariae-specific IgM responses. In this study we show that MBL-A deficiency does not alter immunity to either Trichuris muris or Schistosoma mansoni. However, anti-nematode IgM levels were significantly lower in T. muris infected MBL-A(-/-) than wild-type mice. Interestingly nematode-specific IgG1 and IgG2a levels were higher in MBL-A(-/-) mice. Although, larval schistosomes are surrounded by a complement-sensitive membranous tegument, neither adult worm development, egg output, egg granuloma size nor cellular composition was affected in MBL-A(-/-) mice. In contrast to anti-nematode IgM responses, anti-schistosome IgM (and also IgG1 and IgG2b) responses were unaltered from wild-type mice. Anti-schistosome IgG2a was elevated, while IgG3 was significantly lowered, in MBL-A(-/-) mice. These results suggest that MBL-A is not a necessary component for immunity to either T. muris or S. mansoni helminths, however, MBL-A appears to be necessary for the development of specific IgM responses to nematode antigens.",M2
19149774,"Hepatosplenomegaly associated with chronic malaria exposure: evidence for a pro-inflammatory mechanism exacerbated by schistosomiasis.In sub-Saharan Africa, chronic hepatosplenomegaly, with palpable firm/hard organ consistency, is common, particularly among school-aged children. This morbidity can be caused by long-term exposure to malaria, or by <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>, and it is exacerbated when these two occur together. Although immunological mechanisms probably underlie the pathogenic process, these mechanisms have not been identified, nor is it known whether the two parasites augment the same mechanisms or induce unrelated processes that nonetheless have additive or synergistic effects. Kenyan primary schoolchildren, living in a malaria/schistosomiasis co-transmission area, participated in cross-sectional parasitological and clinical studies in which circulating immune modulator levels were also measured. Plasma IL-12p70, sTNF-RII, IL-10 and IL-13 levels correlated with relative exposure to malaria, and with hepatosplenomegaly. Soluble-TNF-RII and IL-10 were higher in children infected with S. mansoni. Hepatosplenomegaly caused by chronic exposure to malaria was clearly associated with increased circulating levels of pro-inflammatory mediators, with higher levels of regulatory modulators, and with tissue repair cytokines, perhaps being required to control the inflammatory response. The higher levels of regulatory modulators amongst S. mansoni infected children, compared to those without detectable S. mansoni and malarial infections, but exposed to malaria, suggest that S. mansoni infection may augment the underlying inflammatory reaction.",M2
19088181,"Macrophage migration inhibitory factor is critical to interleukin-5-driven eosinophilopoiesis and tissue eosinophilia triggered by <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection.Macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF) participates in the pathogenesis of inflammatory diseases, including asthma, in which it enhances airway hypersensitivity and tissue eosinophilia. Herein, we investigated the role of MIF in eosinophilopoiesis and tissue eosinophilia using Schistosoma mansoni infection. MIF-deficient (Mif(-/-)) mice had similar numbers of adult worms, eggs, and granulomas compared to wild-type mice, but the size of granulomas was strikingly reduced due to smaller numbers of eosinophils. MIF did not affect the acquired response to infection, as Mif(-/-) mice produced normal amounts of Th2 cytokines and IgE. Nevertheless, recombinant MIF (rMIF) behaved as a chemoattractant for eosinophils, what could partially explain the reduced eosinophilia in infected Mif(-/-) mice. Moreover, the percentage of eosinophils was reduced in bone marrows of Mif(-/-) mice chronically infected with S. mansoni compared to wild type. Mif(-/-) had impaired eosinophilopoiesis in response to interleukin (IL)-5 and addition of rMIF to bone marrow cultures from IL-5 transgenic mice enhanced the generation of eosinophils. In the absence of MIF, eosinophil precursors were unable to survive the IL-5-supplemented cell culture, and were ingested by macrophages. Treatment with pancaspase inhibitor z-VAD or rMIF promoted the survival of eosinophil progenitors. Together, these results indicate that MIF participates in IL-5-driven maturation of eosinophils and in tissue eosinophilia associated with S. mansoni infection.",M2
19073189,"Spatial heterogeneity of parasite co-infection: Determinants and geostatistical prediction at regional scales.Multiple parasite infections are widespread in the developing world and understanding their geographical distribution is important for spatial targeting of differing intervention packages. We investigated the spatial epidemiology of mono- and co-infection with helminth parasites in East Africa and developed a geostatistical model to predict infection risk. The data used for the analysis were taken from standardised school surveys of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and hookworm (Ancylostoma duodenale/Necator americanus) carried out between 1999 and 2005 in East Africa. Prevalence of mono- and co-infection was modelled using satellite-derived environmental and demographic variables as potential predictors. A Bayesian multi-nominal geostatistical model was developed for each infection category for producing maps of predicted co-infection risk. We show that heterogeneities in co-infection with S. mansoni and hookworm are influenced primarily by the distribution of S. mansoni, rather than the distribution of hookworm, and that temperature, elevation and distance to large water bodies are reliable predictors of the spatial large-scale distribution of co-infection. On the basis of these results, we developed a validated geostatistical model of the distribution of co-infection at a scale that is relevant for planning regional disease control efforts that simultaneously target multiple parasite species.",M2
19070583,"Sequential analysis of helminth egg output in human stool samples following albendazole and praziquantel administration.Large-scale administration of anthelminthic drugs currently is the most widely used intervention for controlling morbidity due to schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis. An important issue is drug efficacy monitoring. However, the optimal time points post-treatment for assessing the efficacy of praziquantel against <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and albendazole against hookworm infections are not known. Forty-nine schoolchildren infected with S. mansoni and 52 infected with hookworm were treated with a single oral dose of praziquantel (40 mg/kg) and albendazole (400 mg), respectively. Stool samples were collected on 19 occasions over a 44-day post-treatment follow-up period, and two Kato-Katz thick smears per sample were examined at each time point. Both the mean egg counts and observed cure rates varied depending on the time point post-treatment. The highest reduction in the geometric mean egg counts (&gt;97%) and the highest observed cure rate (&gt;97%) of S. mansoni infections were found 15-20 days after praziquantel administration. Among the hookworm-infected children, egg counts decreased rapidly within the first week after albendazole administration (&gt;95%), whereas infection rates showed high and heterogeneous (45.0-71.2%) levels at later time points. Both praziquantel and albendazole were highly efficacious in reducing the overall egg burden of S. mansoni and hookworm, respectively. We suggest that 15-20 days post-treatment is the most appropriate time point for efficacy evaluation of praziquantel against S. mansoni. Although no clear conclusion can be drawn for the optimal timing of efficacy evaluation of albendazole against hookworm, a 2-3-week time frame seems a reasonable compromise. This is justified on logistical grounds (i.e. collection of stool samples only once) and growing emphasis on integrating the control of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis, including drug efficacy monitoring.",M2
18983246,"Effect of praziquantel treatment during pregnancy on cytokine responses to schistosome antigens: results of a randomized, placebo-controlled trial.BACKGROUND: Praziquantel treatment of schistosomiasis boosts antischistosome responses, with type 2 helper T cell bias that may contribute to immunologically mediated killing and to protection against reinfection. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy was recommended in 2002, but the immunological effects of the treatment had not been investigated. METHODS: A cohort of 387 <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>-infected women were recruited from a larger trial of deworming during pregnancy. Women were randomized to receive either praziquantel or placebo during pregnancy. Six weeks after delivery, all women received praziquantel. Cytokine responses to S. mansoni worm and egg antigens were measured in whole blood culture before and 6 weeks after each treatment. RESULTS: Schistosome-specific cytokine responses were suppressed during pregnancy. Praziquantel treatment during pregnancy caused significant boosts in interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin (IL)-2, IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, and IL-10 responses to schistosome worm antigen and in IFN-gamma, IL-5, and IL-13 responses to schistosome egg antigen, but these boosts were not as substantial as those seen for women treated after delivery. CONCLUSION: Pregnancy suppresses a potentially beneficial boost in cytokine responses associated with praziquantel treatment. Further studies are needed on the long-term effects that treatment of schistosomiasis during pregnancy have on morbidity and resistance to reinfection among treated women and their offspring.",M2
18949215,"Two-year impact of single praziquantel treatment on infection in the national control programme on schistosomiasis in Burkina Faso.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact on schistosomiasis of biennial treatment with praziquantel (PZQ) among school-age children in Burkina Faso, the first country that achieved full national coverage with treatment of more than 90% of the school-age population. METHODS: A cohort of 1727 schoolchildren (6-14 years old) was monitored at yearly intervals through a longitudinal survey. Additional groups of schoolchildren were monitored in cross-sectional surveys. Parasitological examinations for Schistosoma haematobium and <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> were performed, and prevalence and intensity of infection before and after treatment were analysed. FINDINGS: Data from the longitudinal cohort show that a single round of PZQ treatment significantly reduced prevalence of S. haematobium infection by 87% (from 59.6% to 7.7%) and intensity of infection by 92.8% (from 94.2 to 6.8 eggs/10 ml of urine) 2 years post-treatment. The impact on infection was also confirmed by a cross-sectional survey 2 years post-treatment. Importantly, the proportion of school-age children with heavy S. haematobium infection decreased from around 25% before treatment to around 2-3% 2 years post-treatment. Cross-sectional comparison of S. haematobium infection in 7-year-old children in their first year at school, who received treatment through community-based drug delivery, also showed significant reduction in both prevalence (65.9%) and intensity of S. haematobium infection (78.4%) 2 years after single treatment. A significant reduction in S. mansoni infection was also achieved. CONCLUSION: Significant and sustained reduction in S. haematobium infection was achieved by biennial treatment in school-age children in Burkina Faso. This may provide a cost-effective treatment strategy for similar national schistosomiasis control programmes in sub-Saharan Africa.",M2
18835272,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection reduces severity of collagen-induced arthritis via down-regulation of pro-inflammatory mediators.Various experimental and epidemiological studies have demonstrated that helminth infections affect outcomes of allergic or autoimmune disorders. Here, we examined the effects of Schistosoma mansoni infection on mouse collagen-induced arthritis, one of the most widely used animal models for rheumatoid arthritis. Male DBA/1 mice were infected with S. mansoni 2 weeks prior to being immunized with type II collagen (IIC). Cytokine mRNA expression in mouse paws, cytokine production by ConA-stimulated spleen cells, and anti-IIC antibodies were evaluated in addition to the severity of arthritis. S. mansoni infection significantly reduced the severity of arthritis. Anti-IIC IgG and IgG2a levels were lower in infected than uninfected mice. With regard to cytokine producing potentials in the infected mice, the down-regulation of Th1 (IFNgamma) and pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNFalpha and IL-17A), and up-regulation of Th2 (IL-4) and an anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10) were observed.In addition, real-time PCR revealed that the augmentation of pro-inflammatory mediators such as IL-1 beta, IL-6 and receptor activator of NFkappaB ligand in inflamed paws was abrogated by S. mansoni infection [corrected]. In conclusion, schistosome infection reduced the severity of autoimmune arthritis via systemic and local suppression of pro-inflammatory mediators, suggesting the potential of parasite-derived materials as therapeutic agents against rheumatoid arthritis.",M2
18722335,"Wild and domesticated animals as reservoirs of Schistosomiasis mansoni in Brazil.Natural infection with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in wild vertebrates and domesticated animals in Brazil is described in this review from an epidemiological viewpoint. Some species of wild rodents are small-sized animals, with a short expectation of life, a limited territory, and present high infection rates under natural conditions. A successful maintenance of the parasite's life cycle under artificial conditions can be achieved with Biomphalaria glabrata. On the other hand, despite showing low natural infection rates, cattle are very susceptible to infection under experimental conditions (using calves of Holstein lineage, cross-bred with the Gir lineage). Due to their large size (just one calf may harbor a number of worms higher than a whole colony of aquatic rodents) and their longevity, cattle are a potential reservoir for the maintenance and dissemination of the disease. There is thus a need of new studies to gain a better understanding about the actual role of these animals in the epidemiology of S. mansoni.",M2
18710859,"Coinfection with the intestinal nematode Heligmosomoides polygyrus markedly reduces hepatic egg-induced immunopathology and proinflammatory cytokines in mouse models of severe schistosomiasis.Infection with the trematode helminth <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> results in a parasite egg-induced, CD4 T-cell-mediated, hepatointestinal granulomatous and fibrosing inflammation that varies greatly in severity, with a higher frequency of milder forms typically occurring in regions where the disease is endemic. One possible explanation for this is that in these regions the degree of inflammation is lessened by widespread concurrent infection with gastrointestinal nematodes. We tested this hypothesis by establishing a murine coinfection model in which mice were infected with the intestinal nematode parasite Heligmosomoides polygyrus prior to infection with S. mansoni. In CBA mice that naturally display a severe form of schistosomiasis, preinfection with H. polygyrus resulted in a marked reduction in schistosome egg-induced hepatic immunopathology, which was associated with significant decreases in the levels of interleukin-17 (IL-17), gamma interferon, tumor necrosis factor alpha, IL-23, IL-6, and IL-1beta and with increases in the levels of IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, and transforming growth factor beta in mesenteric lymph node cells, purified CD4 T cells, and isolated liver granuloma cells. There also were increases in liver Ym1 and forkhead box P3 transcription factor expression. In another model of high-pathology schistosomiasis induced in C57BL/6 mice by immunization with schistosome egg antigens in complete Freund's adjuvant, coinfection with the nematodes also resulted in a marked inhibition of hepatic immunopathology accompanied by similar shifts in cytokine production. These findings demonstrate that intestinal nematodes prevent Th1- and Th17-cell-mediated inflammation by promoting a strong Th2-polarized environment associated with increases in the levels of alternatively activated macrophages and T regulatory cells, which result in significant amelioration of schistosome-induced immunopathology.",M2
18689269,"Impact of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> co-infection on serum profile of interferon-gamma, interleukin-4 and interleukin-10 in patients with chronic hepatitis C virus infection.T cell immunoregulatory cytokines may play a crucial role in the host response to hepatitis C virus infection. While T-helper type 1 (Th1) cytokines are required for host antiviral immune responses, T-helper type 2 (Th2) cytokines can inhibit the development of these effector mechanisms. The aim of this study was to investigate the serum levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 and their roles in the pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection. Also, to explore the influence of Schistosoma mansoni co-infection on that profile of cytokines. Serum levels of IFN- gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 were measured by ELISA in 15 healthy control subjects (group 1), 18 patients with chronic HCV infection (group II) and 17 patients with chronic HCV co-infected with S. mansoni (group III). Routine liver function tests were performed for all groups. All patients had positive HCV RNA by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and elevated alanine amino transferase (ALT) levels for more than 6 months. Diagnosis of S. mansoni infection was based on detection of the parasite in the stools and/or rectal snips and seropositivity for schistosomal antibodies by ELISA. Hematoxylin and eosin stained liver biopsy sections were available and were examined for 25 patients (12 of group II and 13 of group III). There was no statistical difference in serum IFN- gamma levels between patients with chronic HCV infection and healthy controls. IL-4 and IL-10 serum levels were significantly elevated in chronic HCV patients compared to controls (P &lt; 0.05). Chronic HCV patients co-infected with S. mansoni had significantly lower IFN-gamma and significantly higher IL-4 and IL-10 serum levels compared to the other groups (P &lt; 0.05). Serum levels of IL-4 and IL-10 did not correlate to each others in both groups of patients (r = 0.29, P &gt; 0.05 for group II, r = 0.30, P &gt; 0.05 for group III). Patients co-infected with HCV and S. mansoni had necro-inflammatory scores significantly higher in comparison to patients infected with HCV alone (P &lt; 0.05). Serum levels of IFN-gamma, IL-4 and IL-10 did not correlate with the different laboratory parameters, histological activity index or HCV-RNA viral load for all patients population (P &gt; 0.05 for all comparisons). In Conclusions, Th1/Th2 cytokines imbalance is probably involved in the pathogenesis of chronic HCV infection. S. mansoni co-infection induces more alteration in the cytokine milieu, along with more-severe liver disease.",M2
18640114,"Experimental schistosomal hepatitis: protective effect of coenzyme-Q10 against the state of oxidative stress.<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> (S. mansoni) eggs trapped in the host liver elicit a chain of oxidative processes that may be, at least in part, responsible for the pathology and progression of fibrosis associated with schistosomal hepatitis. This study was designed to assess the protective effect of the antioxidant coenzyme-Q10 (Co-Q10) against experimental S. mansoni-induced oxidative stress in the liver, and its potential role as an adjuvant to praziquantel (PZQ) therapy. The oxidative stress and overall liver function were improved under Co-Q10 therapy as evidenced by significant reduction in oxidative stress markers and preservation of antioxidant factors. Liver fibrosis was also reduced with a positive impact on liver function. Moreover, addition of Co-Q10 to PZQ therapy caused: significant reduction of liver egg load, significant improvement of the redox status, and lastly decreased liver fibrosis.",M2
18621051,"Relationships between anaemia and parasitic infections in Kenyan schoolchildren: a Bayesian hierarchical modelling approach.Anaemia is multi-factorial in origin and disentangling its aetiology remains problematic, with surprisingly few studies investigating the relative contribution of different parasitic infections to anaemia amongst schoolchildren. We report cross-sectional data on haemoglobin, malaria parasitaemia, helminth infection and undernutrition among 1523 schoolchildren enrolled in classes 5 and 6 (aged 10-21 years) in 30 primary schools in western Kenya. Bayesian hierarchical modelling was used to investigate putative relationships. Children infected with Plasmodium falciparum or with a heavy <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection, stunted children and girls were found to have lower haemoglobin concentrations. Children heavily infected with S. mansoni were also more likely to be anaemic compared with uninfected children. This study further highlights the importance of malaria and intestinal schistosomiasis as contributors to reduced haemoglobin levels among schoolchildren and helps guide the implementation of integrated school health programmes in areas of differing parasite transmission.",M2
18598664,"Transmission control of schistosomiasis mansoni by introduction of a resistant strain of Biomphalaria tenagophila in areas where transmission is maintained by this species.Biomphalaria tenagophila Taim lineage has proved to be consistently resistant to <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>. Several published works have shown that this resistance is due to the innate defence system of that strain, and in cross-breedings with susceptible strains the Taim lineage presents dominant character. These findings led to the hypothesis that, introducing this strain in areas where transmission of schistosomiasis is maintained by this species, the introduced lineage would perform cross-breeding with the local snails, thus generating offsprings resistant to the parasites. The perspectives of the proposed approach, as well as some preliminary results and problems related to the first introduction without a previous use of molluscicide are discussed.",M2

Groups of five target and five competitor snails were raised together in experimental aquaria and same number in separate aquaria as controls. Shell size, number of eggs and mortality rate were recorded for twelve consecutive weeks. The stocking density for C. gariepinus was one fish per aquarium. Fish were provided with adequate or inadequate supplementary food and fifteen B. pfeifferi were added to each aquarium. The snails and their eggs were counted daily. Significant differences in shell growth and fecundity were noted between B. pfeifferi and M. tuberculata. Physa acuta was noted to be voracious in food consumption. Snail consumption was faster by fish provided with inadequate supplementary food. Based on the present findings, it is suggested that the two competitor snails and African catfish could be used as biological control agents against B. pfeifferi. Nevertheless, the susceptibility of the competitor snails to other trematodes in Ethiopia must first be ruled out before introducing these snails into new habitats. Follow-up field observation and rigorous laboratory studies remain areas for further research.",M2
18582842,"Immuno-epidemiology of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infections in endemic populations co-infected with soil-transmitted helminths: present knowledge, challenges, and the need for further studies.This article reviews studies on epidemiological and immunological interactions between Schistosoma mansoni and soil-transmitted helminths (STH) in co-infected patients from endemic areas. In Brazil, co-infections with schistosomes and intestinal nematodes, such as Ascaris lumbricoides, Trichuris trichiura and the hookworms, are still common, especially in poor rural areas. Important factors in the co-occurrence of different helminth species are favorable environmental conditions supporting intermediate hosts and the survival of larval stages outside the human host, widespread poverty, and low levels of hygiene and sanitation. The few existing epidemiological surveys on helminth co-infections in humans indicate positive associations between schistosomes and STH, which means high prevalences of mixed infections, as well as higher intensities of infection in co-infected patients. However, these positive interactions appear to depend on the number of different helminth species present and on the intensity of infection in each individual. For the humoral immune response in co-infected patients, much cross-reactivity in antibody responses against antigenic preparations from schistosomes and STH is observed. Data on cellular immune responses in multiply infected patients are still scarce and additive effects on the cellular reactivity and the down-modulation of cytokines are proposed.",M2
18579103,"Potential immunomodulatory effects of plant lectins in <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection.Lectins are sugar-binding glycoproteins that can stimulate, in a non-antigen-specific fashion, lymphocytes, leading to proliferation and cytokine production. Some lectins are utilized as in vitro mitogenic lymphocyte stimulators and their use as immunomodulators against infectious diseases has been evaluated experimentally. In the experimental murine model, the immune response to schistosomiasis is Th1-like during the initial stage of infection, with a shift towards a Th2-like response after oviposition. We report the response of schistosomiasis patients' (n=37) peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) to stimulation by lectins, including newly isolated lectins from Brazilian flora, and by Schistosomamansoni soluble egg antigens (SEA). Cytokine production upon lectin stimulation ex vivo was assessed in PBMC supernatants, collected at 24 and 72 h, by sandwich ELISA to IL-5, IL-10, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. In PBMC from infected patients all but one of the lectins induced a Th2-like cytokine response, characterized by elevated IL-5 production that was higher than that induced by SEA stimulation alone. Our results show that the Th2 environment present during schistosomiasis is not affected and that it may be further stimulated by the presence of lectins.",M2
18545839,"[Distribution of eosinophils at different stages of hepatic granuloma evolution in mice infected with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>]In the present study, the distribution of eosinophils at different stages of the formation of hepatic granuloma in mice infected with Schistosoma mansoni was evaluated. From the results obtained, we suggest a new classification for the evolution of hepatic granuloma in mice, constructed from the phases described by other authors. In each phase, there is a different pattern of eosinophil distribution. In the exudative-necrotic phase, the eosinophils are concentrated in the periphery and center of the granuloma, and are scarce in the necrotic area; in the productive phase, the eosinophils are dispersed throughout the granuloma; and in the cure due to fibrosis phase, the eosinophils are concentrated in the periphery and center of the granuloma. Eosinophils were found in direct contact with the eggs at all stages of evolution of the granuloma. It was concluded that the dynamics of eosinophils have an important role in forming the granulomatous reaction of the host and in resolving the inflammatory process caused by the parasite egg, as well as adding new data regarding hepatic granuloma classification.",M2
18519730,"Effect of chemotherapy with praziquantel on the production of cytokines and morbidity associated with schistosomiasis mansoni.The objective of the present study was to test the hypothesis that treatment of schistosomiasis mansoni with praziquantel can alter significantly the immune response of patients and generate a reversal of the level of fibrosis. Peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were collected from, and abdominal ultrasound examinations conducted on, volunteers infected with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and living in an area where the disease is endemic, both prior to and one year after treatment with praziquantel. Subjects were classified into groups according to the level of pathology (i.e., absent, incipient, moderate, or severe fibrosis). PBMCs were stimulated with schistosome soluble egg antigens (SEA), and the levels of production of the cytokines gamma interferon (IFN-gamma), tumor necrosis factor alpha, transforming growth factor beta, and interleukin-4 (IL-4), IL-10, and IL-13 were determined. The chemotherapy was effective in reducing morbidity, particularly for individuals presenting with severe fibrosis. When levels of cytokine production in posttreatment PBMC cultures stimulated by SEA were categorized as low or high, significant differences in the distribution of IL-13 levels between groups presenting with or not presenting with fibrosis were established. Comparison of pre- and posttreatment SEA-induced cytokine levels in individuals who had experienced no change in the grade of fibrosis following chemotherapy revealed that the level of IFN-gamma decreased in subjects with fibrosis whereas that of IL-10 decreased in individuals with and without fibrosis. The data suggest that chemotherapy is effective in reducing the morbidity of the disease and that the level of IL-13 may be a useful indicator of the persistence of fibrosis following treatment.",M2

Our objective was to identify the clinical forms of schistosomiasis among 109 patients in whom the disease had been diagnosed through direct fecal analysis and who had been medicated with oxamniquine at the time of the Plan for the Intensification of Schistosomiasis Control Actions (1998-2000). These patients were submitted to an abdominal ultrasonography and fecal analysis by Kato-Katz method, four years, on average, after the end of the Plan. Five patients, whose abdominal ultrasound images were compatible with either peripheral or central periportal fibrosis and portal hypertension, were identified. None of the 109 patients presented <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> eggs at fecal analysis. Ultrasonography is a sensitive, noninvasive diagnostic method that allows a better identification of the extent of liver involvement in schistosomiasis cases.",M2
18425222,"Duplex sonography study in schistosomiasis portal hypertension: characterization of patients with and without a history of variceal bleeding.BACKGROUND: Presinusoidal portal hypertension with frequent episodes of upper gastrointestinal variceal bleeding are hallmarks of hepatosplenic Mansons schistosomiasis; a clinical form that affects about 5% of Brazilians who are infected by <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>. AIMS: To evaluate duplex sonography findings in patients with hepatosplenic Mansons schistosomiasis with and without upper gastrointestinal variceal hemorrhage. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was performed whereby 27 consecutive patients with hepatosplenic Mansons schistosomiasis were divided into two groups: group I (six men and six women; mean age 48.7 years) with a past history of bleeding and group II (four men and eight women; mean age 44.7 years) without a past history of upper gastrointestinal bleeding, underwent duplex sonography examination. All patients underwent the same upper gastrointestinal endoscopy and laboratory examinations. Those with signs of mixed chronic liver disease or portal vein thrombosis (three cases) were excluded. RESULTS: Group I showed significantly higher mean portal vein flow velocity than group II (26.36 cm/s vs 17.15 cm/sec). Although, as a whole it was not significant in all forms of collateral vessels (83% vs 100%), there was a significantly higher frequency of splenorenal collateral circulation type in group II compared with group I (17% vs 67%). The congestion index of the portal vein was significantly lower in group I than in group II (0.057 cm vs 0.073 cm/sec). CONCLUSION: Our duplex sonography findings in hepatosplenic Mansons schistosomiasis support the idea that schistosomotic portal hypertension is strongly influenced by overflow status, and that collateral circulation seems to play an important role in hemodynamic behavior.",M2
18354220,"IL-4R alpha expression by bone marrow-derived cells is necessary and sufficient for host protection against acute schistosomiasis.IL 4 receptor alpha (IL-4Ralpha) expression by non-bone marrow (BM)-derived cells is required to protect hosts against several parasitic helminth species. In contrast, we demonstrate that IL-4Ralpha expression by BM-derived cells is both necessary and sufficient to prevent <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>-infected mice from developing severe inflammation directed against parasite ova, whereas IL-4Ralpha expression by non-BM-derived cells is neither necessary nor sufficient. Chimeras that express IL-4Ralpha only on non-BM-derived cells still produce Th2 cytokines, but overproduce IL-12p40, TNF, and IFN-gamma, fail to generate alternatively activated macrophages, and develop endotoxemia and severe hepatic and intestinal pathology. In contrast, chimeras that express IL-4Ralpha only on BM-derived cells have extended survival, even though the granulomas that they develop around parasite eggs are small and devoid of collagen. These observations identify distinct roles for IL-4/IL-13 responsive cell lineages during schistosomiasis: IL-4Ralpha-mediated signaling in non-BM-derived cells regulates granuloma size and fibrosis, whereas signaling in BM-derived cells suppresses parasite egg-driven inflammation within the liver and intestine.",M2

AC polysaccharides (AC-PS) are reported to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-hepatitis B virus, and anticancer activities. In this study, we tested the in vivo effect of AC-PS on immune function by evaluating cytokine expression; on immunomodulation, by evaluating spleen cells; and on Schistosoma mansoni infection in mice. The induction of high levels of interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) mRNA was detected in BALB/c mice after 2, 4, and 6 weeks of oral AC-PS administration. After 6 weeks of oral AC-PS administration to the BALB/c mice, the number of splenic dendritic cells, macrophages, and the surface expression of CD8 alpha+ and major histocompatibility class II I-A/I-E on dendritic cells increased. The CD4+/CD8+ ratio and number of B cells among splenocytes were also augmented. By using a disease model of parasitic infection, we found that AC-PS treatment inhibited S. mansoni infection in BALB/c mice. AC-PS appears to modulate the immune system of mice and has potential for preventing S. mansoni infection.",M2

18207118,"Genetic epidemiology of human schistosomiasis in Brazil.Human schistosomiasis presents the classic, complex disease phenotype, with marked variation in the intensity of infection, the immune response to infection, and the development of schistosome-related pathology. Determining the role of host genetics in schistosomiasis is complicated by the numerous parasite and environmental factors involved in transmission. However, as a result of the increased availability of sequence data, novel statistical methods, and new methods of study design, the last decade has seen significant advances in identifying the role of host genetics in schistosome infection around the world. Many of these advances have taken place in Brazil. Epidemiological studies in Brazil have shown that the intensity of infection (worm burden) is a heritable phenotype (41%). Human genome scans have identified a locus responsible for controlling <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection intensity on chromosome 5q31-q33. There is also evidence for genetic control of pathology due to S. mansoni, with linkage reported to a region containing the gene for the interferon-gamma receptor 1 subunit. Numerous association studies have also provided evidence for major histocompatibility complex control of pathology in schistosomiasis. Recent candidate gene studies suggest a role of other immune response genes in controlling helminth infection and pathology. We chronicle the many advances made in understanding the role of host genetics in S. mansoni infection that have taken place in Brazil by phenotype studied: infection intensity, immune response, and disease development. Results from Brazilian studies are compared with studies of S. mansoni and other schistosome species elsewhere in the world.",M2
18202444,"Current status of vaccines for schistosomiasis.Schistosomiasis, caused by trematode blood flukes of the genus Schistosoma, is recognized as the most important human helminth infection in terms of morbidity and mortality. Infection follows direct contact with freshwater harboring free-swimming larval (cercaria) forms of the parasite. Despite the existence of the highly effective antischistosome drug praziquantel (PZQ), schistosomiasis is spreading into new areas, and although it is the cornerstone of current control programs, PZQ chemotherapy does have limitations. In particular, mass treatment does not prevent reinfection. Furthermore, there is increasing concern about the development of parasite resistance to PZQ. Consequently, vaccine strategies represent an essential component for the future control of schistosomiasis as an adjunct to chemotherapy. An improved understanding of the immune response to schistosome infection, both in animal models and in humans, suggests that development of a vaccine may be possible. This review considers aspects of antischistosome protective immunity that are important in the context of vaccine development. The current status in the development of vaccines against the African (<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and S. haematobium) and Asian (S. japonicum) schistosomes is then discussed, as are new approaches that may improve the efficacy of available vaccines and aid in the identification of new targets for immune attack.",M2

The present work aimed at assessment of in vitro spontaneous and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced apoptosis in mononuclear cells isolated from patients with hepatosplenic form of S. mansoni infections. Cell death data were correlated to the degree of lymphoproliferative responses to PHA as well as to the serum anti-schistosomal antibody titers. A markedly significant increase in PHA-induced apoptosis in lymphocytes isolated from S. mansoni-infected patients was seen when compared to the corresponding healthy controls. However, a slight difference was recorded between the two studied groups regarding the spontaneous apoptosis. This was accompanied with a significant impairment of in vitro PHA-induced lymphoproliferation of T cells from S. mansoni patients. Data of the present study supports the hypothesis that activation-induced cell death (AICD) is a potentially contributing factor in T helper (Th) cell regulation during chronic stages of schistosomiasis, which represents a critically determinant factor in the host-parasite interaction and might influence the destiny of parasitic infections either towards establishment of chronic infection or towards host death.",M2

Extract of A. camphorate is reported to possess anti-inflammatory, antihepatitis B virus and anticancer activities. In this study, we tested the in vivo effects of polysaccharides derived from A. camphorata (AC-PS) on immune function by detection of cytokine expression and evaluation of the immune phenotype in a T1/T2 doubly transgenic mouse model. The protective effect of AC-PS in mice was tested by infection with Schistosoma mansoni. The induction of large amounts of IFN-gamma, IL-2 and TNF-alpha mRNA were detected after 2 and 4 weeks of oral AC-PS administration in BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice. In transgenic mice, 3 to 6 weeks of oral AC-PS administration increased the proportion of CD4(+) T cells and B cells within the spleen. More specifically, there was an increase of Th1 CD4(+) T cells and Be1 cells among spleen cells as observed by detection the of Type1/Type2 marker molecules. By using a disease model of parasitic infection, we found that AC-PS treatment inhibited infection with S. mansoni in BALB/C and C57BL/6 mice.

We evaluated the standardized ultrasound methodology proposed by the World Health Organization for detecting periportal fibrosis and portal hypertension, among patients from an endemic area in Venezuela, and the impact of praziquantel treatment 3-5 years later. After chemotherapy, complete reversal of periportal lesions was observed in 28.2% of the cases and progression of the disease in 5.1%. Improvement in the hepatic disease started with a reduction in the periportal thickening followed by a decrease in the size of the left hepatic lobe, spleen and mesenteric and spleen veins.

METHODS: Male CD-1 Swiss albino mice were infected with Schistosoma mansoni and treated with praziquantel (PZQ) 6 weeks post-infection (PI) (500 mg/kg/day x2) and/or ART in double dose (each of 400 mg/kg) 4 and 6 weeks PI. Parasitological parameters, liver functions and histopathological changes including T-lymphocyte profile and apoptotic changes were assessed. RESULTS: Eight weeks PI, although the reduction in worm burden in mice treated with ART plus PZQ was comparable to that in PZQ-treated mice, yet there was complete absence of eggs and typical granulomas. The ratio of T-helper/cytotoxic cells was in favor of T-helper in infected control and in mice treated with both drugs. This ratio was 0.9:1 and 0.7:1 in PZQ and ART-treated groups, respectively, with moderate apoptotic changes in the latter. All biochemical parameters expressing liver function were improved with all treatment regimens. CONCLUSIONS: Administration of ART in addition to PZQ resulted in absence of eggs and typical granulomas with less apoptotic changes than in ART-treated mice. Improved liver functions with higher apoptosis in ART-treated mice may suggest enhanced necrotic cell death/regenerative changes.",M2

Annual treatment with praziquantel and albendazole was given to schoolchildren in endemic areas and to adults in selected communities where local prevalence of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in schoolchildren was high. METHODS: The impact of the treatment program was monitored through cohorts of schoolchildren and adults. Their infection status with S. mansoni and STH was determined by parasitological examinations at baseline and at annual follow-ups. The prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni and STH before and after treatment were analyzed. RESULTS: Two rounds of treatment significantly reduced the prevalence of S. mansoni infection in schoolchildren across three regions in the country from 33.4-49.3% to 9.7-29.6%, and intensity of infection from 105.7-386.8 eggs per gram of faeces (epg) to 11.6-84.1 epg. The prevalence of hookworm infection was reduced from 41.2-57.9% to 5.5-16.1%, and intensity of infection from 186.9-416.8 epg to 3.7-36.9 epg. The proportion of children with heavy S. mansoni infection was significantly reduced from 15% (95% CI 13.4-16.8%) to 2.3% (95% CI 1.6-3.0%). In adults, significant reduction in the prevalence and intensity of S. mansoni and hookworm infections was also observed. More importantly, the prevalence and intensity of both S. mansoni and hookworm infections in the cohorts of newly-recruited 6-year-olds who had never previously received treatment decreased significantly over 2 years: 34.9% (95% CI 31.9-37.8%) to 22.6% (95% CI 19.9-25.2%) and 171.1 epg (95% CI 141.5-200.7) to 72.0 epg (95% CI 50.9-93.1) for S. mansoni; and 48.4% (95% CI 45.4-51.5) to 15.9% (95% CI 13.6-18.2) and 232.7 epg (95% CI 188.4-276.9) to 51.4 epg (95% CI 33.4-69.5) for hookworms, suggesting a general decline in environmental transmission levels. CONCLUSION: Annual anthelminthic treatment delivered to schoolchildren and to adults at high risk in Uganda can significantly reduce the prevalence and intensity of infection for schistosomiasis and STH, and potentially also significantly reduce levels of environmental transmission of infection.",M2
17707955,"The Schistosoma bovis Sb14-3-3zeta recombinant protein cross-protects against <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> in BALB/c mice.Current control programs against schistosomiasis could be reinforced through the use of an effective vaccine. Schistosome 14-3-3 proteins have been proposed as candidates for vaccine against the respective infections, and were seen to elicit high protection levels against Schistosoma bovis in a previous work done by our group. We have therefore investigated the protective capacity of the 14-3-3 protein from S. bovis - Sb14zeta - against Schistosoma mansoni in mice. In addition, we have addressed the influence of the co-administration of three different immunomodulators with the 14-3-3 polypeptide. Protection was high when the Sb14zeta protein was combined in two independent experiments with the AA2829 and PAL immunomodulatory molecules as regards both the reduction of worm numbers (mean: 64.8%) and egg loads in liver (mean: 73.9%) or intestine (mean: 71.5%). In contrast, the degree of protection achieved with the Sb14zeta-CpG vaccine was very low (14.9% reduction in worm numbers, and 46.6% and 32% reduction in liver and intestinal egg loads). The immune responses observed in the vaccinated animals showed that the production of IFNgamma and the absence of IL-4, accompanied by a strong humoral response, are insufficient to elicit protection against S. mansoni.",M2
17689595,"Protective effect of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection on allergic airway inflammation depends on the intensity and chronicity of infection.BACKGROUND: Population studies have suggested that chronic and intense helminth infections, in contrast to acute and mild helminth infections, might suppress allergic airway inflammation. OBJECTIVE: We sought to address the question of how the chronicity and intensity of helminth infections affect allergic airway inflammation in a well-defined experimental model. METHODS: C57/Bl6 mice were infected with Schistosoma mansoni, followed by sensitization and challenge with ovalbumin (OVA), and different stages and intensities of infection were studied. To this end, mice were analyzed at 8, 12, or 16 weeks, representing the acute, intermediate, or chronic phases of infection, respectively. RESULTS: Lung lavage eosinophilia, peribronchial inflammation, and OVA-induced airway hyperresponsiveness were increased during acute infection but significantly decreased when infection progressed into chronicity. Decreases in lung lavage eosinophilia were parasite density-dependent. Similar levels of OVA-specific IgE were found during all phases of infection, whereas both OVA-specific and parasite-specific T(H)2 cytokine levels were significantly reduced during chronic infection. Inhibition of airway inflammation could be transferred to OVA-sensitized recipient mice by B cells and CD4(+) T cells from spleens of chronically, but not acutely, infected mice. This suppression was IL-10-dependent. CONCLUSION: During chronic, but not acute, helminth infections, suppressive mechanisms are induced that regulate immune reactions to inhaled allergens. These data confirm human epidemiologic observations in a well-controlled animal model. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Characterization of chronic helminth infection-induced regulatory mechanisms will help in the development of future therapeutics to treat or prevent allergic disease.",M2
17606217,"Detection of schistosomiasis cases in low-transmission areas based on coprologic and serologic criteria The Venezuelan experience.Low and very-low intensities of infection hinder the diagnosis of schistosomiasis. Therefore, new parameters should be established in order to more accurately identify active cases and true infection prevalence, for the adequate implementation of a control program. After the survey and analysis of the epidemiological characteristics of five Venezuelan communities, we propose three criteria for the definition of a  schistosomiasis case , based on different diagnostic methods: stool examination, ELISA-soluble egg antigen with sodium metaperiodate (SMP-ELISA), alkaline phosphatase immunoassay (APIA) and the circumoval precipitin test (COPT). Briefly, criterion I: persons with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> eggs in stools; criterion II: persons without eggs in stools, with positive COPT, without previous antischistosome chemotherapy in the last year; and criterion III: persons without eggs in stools, with negative COPT, with two positive immunoenzymatic tests (SMP-ELISA and APIA), and with no previous chemotherapy. The incorporation of serological tests to epidemiologic surveillance in areas of low-transmission tries to compensate the underestimation of prevalence based only on parasitological diagnosis.",M2
17604523,"Substitution of malachite green with nigrosin-eosin yellow stain in the Kato-Katz method: microscopical appearance of the helminth eggs.BACKGROUND: The Kato-Katz thick smear technique is the standard technique recommended by the World Health Organisation for the quantitative diagnosis of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and other intestinal helminth infections. The major problem of the technique is that a few hours after the preparation of slides hookworm eggs over clear and disappear due glycerin. OBJECTIVE: To illustrate clear visibility of different helminth eggs microscopically in Odongo-Aginya method, substitution of malachite green with 7.5% nigrosin in 10% formalin and 5% eosin in 10% formalin. METHOD: Measured, strained stool specimen was stained with mixture of nigrosin/eosin and covered with cellophane cover slips. The prepared slide was examined immediately microscopically. RESULT: Slides prepared with Odongo-Aginya method can be examined immediately or later without compromising the visibility of parasite eggs and larvae. Hookworm eggs remain visible for a long time. CONCLUSION: The present publication shows microscopic appearance of the helminth eggs using the Odongo-Aginya modification.",M2
17550469,"Microgeographical and tribal variations in water contact and <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> exposure within a Ugandan fishing community.OBJECTIVE: To explore patterns of water contact and Schistosoma mansoni exposure by age, sex, tribe and space within a single village. METHODS: For 10 months, we systematically observed water contacts made by the 800 inhabitants of a small Ugandan fishing village. In order to estimate cercarial exposure, times spent in water were weighted by snail infection levels, time of day and degree of immersion. RESULTS: There were marked differences in water contact patterns between the two main tribes, which inhabited geographically distinct ends of the village resulting in geographically distinct spatial patterns of water contact. The distributions of the intermediate hosts, Biomphalaria sudanica and Biomphalaria stanleyi, also appeared to differ over small distances. This led to quite different exposure patterns between the two tribes, particularly amongst females. CONCLUSIONS: Schistosoma mansoni exposure can vary markedly within a single village. Such non-homogenous patterns of exposure are likely to have wider implications for schistosomiasis control programmes and research studies.",M2
17550468,"Risk factors for <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and hookworm in urban farming communities in western C√¥te d'Ivoire.OBJECTIVES: To identify risk factors for Schistosoma mansoni and hookworm infections in urban farming communities, and to investigate small-scale spatial patterns of infection prevalence. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was carried out in 113 farming households (586 individuals) and 21 non-farming households (130 individuals) from six agricultural zones in the town of Man, western C√¥te d'Ivoire. Heads of households were interviewed on common agricultural activities, land and water use, education attainment, socioeconomic status and sanitation facilities. Household members provided stool specimens that were processed by the Kato-Katz technique and a formol-ether concentration method and diagnosed for S. mansoni, hookworms and other soil-transmitted helminths and intestinal protozoa. Bayesian statistics were employed for spatial analyses. RESULTS: The prevalences of S. mansoni and hookworm in farming households were 51.4% and 24.7%, respectively. Risk factors for a S. mansoni infection comprised living in close proximity to the K√¥ River, water contact with irrigation wells and ponds and low education attainment. Living in zones of smallholder irrigated rice plots or large rice perimeters, using water from domestic wells, and low socioeconomic status were risk factors for a hookworm infection. We found significant spatial heterogeneity between agricultural zones, with the highest infection prevalences of S. mansoni and hookworm in the zone where there was a large rice perimeter. CONCLUSIONS: In this urban setting, both S. mansoni and hookworm infections were related to specific agricultural activities. Health education and active participation of urban farmers for the control of schistosomiasis and soil-transmitted helminthiasis is recommended.",M2
17488922,"Bayesian spatial risk prediction of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection in western C√¥te d'Ivoire using a remotely-sensed digital elevation model.An important epidemiologic feature of schistosomiasis is the focal distribution of the disease. Thus, the identification of high-risk communities is an essential first step for targeting interventions in an efficient and cost-effective manner. We used a remotely-sensed digital elevation model (DEM), derived hydrologic features (i.e., stream order, and catchment area), and fitted Bayesian geostatistical models to assess associations between environmental factors and infection with Schistosoma mansoni among more than 4,000 school children from the region of Man in western C√¥te d'Ivoire. At the unit of the school, we found significant correlations between the infection prevalence of S. mansoni and stream order of the nearest river, water catchment area, and altitude. In conclusion, the use of a freely available 90 m high-resolution DEM, geographic information system applications, and Bayesian spatial modeling facilitates risk prediction for S. mansoni, and is a powerful approach for risk profiling of other neglected tropical diseases that are pervasive in the developing world.",M2
17464427,"Activity of liver microsomal enzymes during the chronic phase of murine schistosomiasis.The effects of schistosomiasis on microsomal enzymes were studied on post-infection day 90 when accumulated damage and fibrosis are most intense but granulomatous reaction around the eggs harbored in the liver is smaller than during the earlier phases. Swiss Webster (SW) and DBA/2 mice of either sex (N = 12 per sex per group) were infected with 100 <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> cercariae on postnatal day 10 and killed on post-infection day 90. Cytochrome P-450 (CYP) concentration and alkoxyresorufin-O-dealkylases (EROD, MROD, BROD, and PROD), p-nitrophenol-hydroxylase (PNPH), coumarin-7-hydroxylase (COH), and UDP-glucuronosyltransferase (UGT) activities were measured in hepatic microsomes. Age-matched mice of the same sex and strain were used as controls. In S. mansoni-infected mice, CYP1A- and 2B-mediated activities (control = 100%) were reduced in SW (EROD: male (M) 36%, female (F) 38%; MROD: M 38%, F 39%; BROD: M 46%, F 19%; PROD: M 50%, F 28%) and DBA/2 mice (EROD: M 64%, F 58%; MROD: M 60%; BROD: F 49%; PROD: M 73%) while PNPH (CYP2E1) was decreased in SW (M 31%, F 38%) but not in DBA/2 mice. COH did not differ between infected and control DBA/2 and UGT, a phase-2 enzyme, was not altered by infection. In conclusion, chronic S. mansoni infection reduced total CYP content and all CYP-mediated activities evaluated in SW mice, including those catalyzed by CYP2E1 (PNPH), CYP1A (EROD, MROD) and 2B (BROD, PROD). In DBA/2 mice, however, CYP2A5- and 2E1-mediated activities remained unchanged while total CYP content and activities mediated by other CYP isoforms were depressed during chronic schistosomiasis.",M2
17430549,"Chronic exposure to schistosome eggs reduces serum cholesterol but has no effect on atherosclerotic lesion development.Previous studies have shown that people infected with schistosomiasis have lower levels of serum cholesterol than uninfected controls. To better understand the impact of this parasitic infection on serum cholesterol levels and on atherosclerotic lesion development induced by hypercholesterolemia, apolipoprotein E (ApoE)-deficient mice were chronically exposed to the eggs of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> over a period of 16 weeks. Total serum cholesterol and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) were reduced in egg-exposed ApoE-deficient mice fed a diet high in cholesterol compared to unexposed controls. However, exposure to eggs had no effect on atherosclerotic lesion size or progression in ApoE-deficient mice. Macrophages isolated from egg-exposed mice had an enhanced ability to take up LDL but not acetylated LDL (acLDL). This study suggests that schistosome eggs alone may alter serum lipid profiles through enhancing LDL uptake by macrophages, but these changes do not ultimately affect atherosclerotic lesion development.",M2
17368699,"Field-based evaluation of a reagent strip test for diagnosis of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> by detecting circulating cathodic antigen in urine before and after chemotherapy.The sensitivity of a reagent strip test for the diagnosis of schistosomiasis by detecting circulating cathodic antigen (CCA) in urine was evaluated under field conditions using 251 stool and urine samples collected from a Schistosoma mansoni-endemic area of Ethiopia. The specificity of the test was evaluated in an area where schistosomiasis is not endemic. Stool samples were examined microscopically using duplicate Kato slides and formol-ether concentration methods. The effectiveness of the test in monitoring efficacy was also evaluated following chemotherapy. The results revealed that detection of CCA in urine using the one-step reagent strip test was superior to the stool examination methods (P&lt;0.05) in indicating the prevalence of the disease. Assuming the combination of parasitological test results as the gold standard, the sensitivity and specificity of the test were 82.1% and 75.9%, respectively. The results of egg counts suggested the potential use of urine CCA in indicating the intensity of infection as an alternative to parasitological methods. The sensitivity and specificity of the test were 75% and 73.7%, respectively, following chemotherapy. Diagnosis of S. mansoni infection in urine using reagent strips would provide information on the prevalence of the disease, although further study is needed to improve its sensitivity and specificity.",M2
17354130,"Chronic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis mansoni: magnetic resonance imaging and magnetic resonance angiography findings.PURPOSE: To evaluate the hepatosplenic manifestations and the portal venous system in patients with chronic infection by <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A cross-sectional observational study was performed in 28 patients with chronic hepatosplenic schistosomiasis submitted to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and magnetic resonance angiography (MRA) of the abdomen. Images were interpreted independently by two radiologists to determine the reproducibility of image interpretation and who evaluated the presence of morphological alterations in the liver and spleen, such as hepatosplenomegaly, hepatic fissure widening, periportal fibrosis, and the presence of siderotic nodules. Interobserver and intra-observer agreement were measured with the kappa and intraclass correlation tests. Evaluation of venous collateral pathways and portal and splenic veins was done in consensus by both examiners. RESULTS: Observers identified enlargement of the left lobe (78.5-92.8%) and caudate-to-right-lobe ratio (78.5-92.8%), irregularity of hepatic contours (89.2-96.4%), fissure widening (89.2-100%), and splenic siderotic nodules (84.2%). Splenomegaly, heterogeneity of hepatic parenchyma, peripheral hepatic vessels, and periportal fibrosis were observed in 100% of patients. MRI findings presented almost perfect interobserver (kappa = 0.65-1) and intra-observer (kappa = 0.73-1 for observer 1, and kappa = 0.65-1 for observer 2) agreement for the variables analyzed. MRA showed the presence of collateral pathways in the majority of patients (71.4%) along with widening of portal and splenic veins. CONCLUSION: Using MRI, hepatosplenic alterations in schistosomiasis are characterized by heterogeneity of hepatic parenchyma, presence of peripheral perihepatic vessels, periportal fibrosis, splenomegaly, siderotic nodules, and the presence of venous collateral pathways.",M2
17353366,"IL-31-IL-31R interactions negatively regulate type 2 inflammation in the lung.Interleukin (IL) 31Ralpha (glycoprotein 130-like monocyte receptor and glycoprotein 130-like receptor) heterodimerizes with oncostatin M receptor beta to bind IL-31, a cytokine expressed preferentially by CD4(+) T helper type 2 (Th2) cells. However, the functions of IL-31-IL-31R signaling in immune regulation remain unknown. Here, we identify a novel role for IL-31R in limiting type 2 inflammation in the lung. After intravenous injection of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> eggs, IL-31Ralpha(-/-) mice developed severe pulmonary inflammation, characterized by an increase in the area of granulomatous inflammation, increased numbers of resistin-like molecule alpha(+) cells, and enhanced collagen deposition compared to WT counterparts. In vitro, macrophages generated from IL-31Ralpha(-/-) mice promoted enhanced ovalbumin-specific CD4(+) T cell proliferation and purified naive CD4(+) T cells from IL-31Ralpha(-/-) mice exhibited enhanced proliferation and expression of Th2 cytokines, identifying a T cell- and macrophage-intrinsic regulatory function for IL-31R signaling. In contrast, the generation of CD4(+) T cell-mediated Th1 responses were normal in IL-31Ralpha(-/-) mice, suggesting that the regulatory role of IL-31R signaling is limited to type 2 responses. Together, these data implicate IL-31R signaling as a novel negative regulatory pathway that specifically limits type 2 inflammation.",M2
17348744,"The effect of vaccinating S. mansoni-infected BALB/c mice either before or after treatment.In <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> endemic areas, there are people with ongoing S. mansoni infection, others have been infected and treated while others have never been infected. What would happen if these different groups of people were vaccinated against S. mansoni? BALB / c mice were divided into five groups: Infected-Treated-Vaccinated; Infected-Vaccinated-Treated; Vaccinated-Treated Control; Challenge Control and Untreated Challenge Control. Vaccination (500 20krad irradiated S. mansoni cercariae), Treatment (praziquantel), Infection and Challenge (150 S. mansoni cercariae) were carried out at specified times. Proliferation assay, Enzyme linked immunosorbent assay, gross pathology, histopathology and perfusion were performed. High protection levels were obtained in mice treated after vaccination: Vaccinated-Treated control, 96.5 %; Infected-Vaccinated-Treated, 68.9 %; and Infected-Treated-Vaccinated, 41 %. A good correlation was obtained between proliferative responses and protective levels, implying cellular involvement in protection. Although all protected animals had high IgG levels, there was no strong correlation between the two. Specificity rather than amounts of IgG, seem more important in protection. Praziquantel seemed to boost protective immunity when administered after vaccination. Granuloma development and modulation in the two test groups was similar. It seems better to vaccinate infected patients before treatment, the ideal situation being vaccinating people who have not encountered S. mansoni.",M2
17348743,"Influence of age of mice on the susceptibility to murine schistosomiasis infection.Intensity of human schistosomiasis infection increases with age, a peak being attained at early puberty. Hormones could be involved in the age-related changes in susceptibility to schistosomiasis. Male BALB / c mice were infected with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> either before or after puberty and worm numbers, cellular immune responses, hormonal levels and pathology analysed. Pre-puberty infected mice had a significantly higher number of adult worms (p &lt; 0.05), more severe granulomas, higher mortality rate and higher proliferative responses as compared to post-puberty infected mice. Levels of the hormones were lower in the pre-puberty infected mice as compared to the post-puberty group early in the infection. Plasma levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormones decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.05) in infected mice when compared to controls. Susceptibility to S. mansoni in male BALB / c mice seems to be influenced by levels of testosterone and luteinizing hormone at infection. Albeit, an infection with S. mansoni seems to lower the hormonal levels.",M2
17313515,"Associations between specific antibody responses and resistance to reinfection in a Senegalese population recently exposed to <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>.We examined associations between schistosome-specific antibody responses and reinfection in Senegalese individuals recently exposed to Schistosoma mansoni. The effects of treatment, age, intensity of infection and duration of exposure on schistosome-specific antibody responses were also investigated by comparing immune responses in individuals exposed for less than 3 years with responses in people exposed for more than 8 years. All individuals were bled before treatment as well as 6 and 12 weeks after. We used a statistical model that included interaction terms between time, age, infection intensity and duration of exposure. The overall patterns of most specific antibody responses by age were similar to those previously published for S. mansoni, Schistosoma japonicum and Schistosoma haematobium infections in different endemic areas. In general, a boost in specific antibody responses against adult worm antigen (SWA) was observed at 6 weeks after treatment whereas the majority of isotype responses against egg antigen (SEA) were not affected by treatment. Our analysis showed that the effect of treatment on schistosome-specific antibody responses is influenced by age, infection intensity and duration of exposure. We found no evidence that treatment matures the specific antibody response of children recently infected with S. mansoni. Our results indicate that the build-up of potentially protective immunoglobulin E (IgE) responses was associated with duration of exposure, or, in other words, experience of infection. Interestingly, in recently exposed individuals there was a significant association between IgA responses to SWA and resistance to reinfection. Resistance to reinfection and production of IgA-SWA was associated with adulthood independently of exposure patterns, suggesting that susceptibility to S. mansoni and the development of protective immune responses is age-dependent.",M2

A total of 410 subjects in Um Zukra village were tested for HCV antibodies, 2.2% were reactive. The prevalence was highest in those between 11 and 20 years old with equal prevalence among males and females. No correlation was found between HCV infection and S. mansoni infection or parenteral antischistosomal therapy.

The objective of this study was to evaluate the capacity of some S. mansoni antigens to stimulate IL-10 production in vitro by cells of asthmatic infected individuals. Peripheral bloods mononuclear cells were stimulated with the S. mansoni recombinant antigens Sm22.6, Sm14, P24, and PIII antigen. IL-10 was measured in the supernatants of cultures. As the recombinant antigens were cloned in Escherichia coli, we blocked contaminant endotoxin with polymyxin B added to the cultures. We demonstrated that all antigens used drove high production of IL-10 in S. mansoni infected individuals (n = 13, 408 +/- 514 and 401 +/- 383 pg/ml, 484 +/- 245 pg/ml, 579 +/- 468 pg/ml, respectively). In asthmatics infected with S. mansoni (n = 21) rP24 induced higher levels of IL-10 (565 +/- 377 pg/ml) when compared to PIII, rSm14 and rSm22.6 (184 +/- 209 pg/ml; 292 +/- 243 pg/ml; 156 +/- 247 pg/ml, respectively). Conclusion: the S. mansoni antigens evaluated in this study stimulated IL-10 production by cells from infected individuals and therefore they have the potential to be used as a modulator of the inflammatory response in asthma.",M2

The absence of earlier reviews regarding specific strains of the Amazon region prompted research, which the main objective was to describe histopathological lesions in different phases of schistosomiasis in a murine model using PC (Par√°) and LILA (Maranh√£o) S. mansoni strains. One hundred and eighty young female albino swiss mice (Mus musculus) were used and were randomly divided into five groups (PC-01, PC-02, LILA-01, LILA-02, and controls), according to the number of cercariae injected and the strain adopted. Animals were sacrificed in predetermined periods (35, 56, 112, 156, and 180 days) in an attempt to follow the evolution of the disease in the histological sections of their tissues at different phases of infection. Our findings were compatible with the data already described by others authors using different strains of S. mansoni, making it possible to identify some peculiarities, which are discussed in this work. In conclusion, the strains of parasite used did not modify the histopathological findings in the tissues of infected mice in any significant way when compared with the results of other studies using different strains.",M2
17308745,"Low transmission areas of schistosomiasis in Venezuela: consequences on the diagnosis, treatment, and control.Schistosomiasis low transmission areas as Venezuela, can be defined as those where the vector exists, the prevalence of active cases is under 25%, individuals with mild intensity of infection predominate and are mostly asymptomatic. These areas are the consequence of effective control programs, however,  silent  epidemiological places are difficult to trace, avoiding the opportune diagnosis and treatment of infected persons. Clinic and abdominal ultrasound have not shown to discriminate infected from uninfected persons in areas where besides <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>, intestinal parasites are the rule. Under these conditions, serology remains as a very valuable diagnostic tool, since it gives a closer approximation to the true prevalence. In this sense, circumoval precipitin test, ELISA-SEA with sodium metaperiodate, and alkaline phosphatase immunoassay joined to coprology allow the identification of the  schistosomiasis cases . In relation to public health, schistosomiasis has been underestimated by the sanitary authorities and the investment on its control is being transferred to other diseases of major social and political relevance neglecting sanitary efforts and allowing growth of snail population. Some strategies of diagnosis and control should be done before schistosomiasis reemergence occurs in low transmission areas.",M2

The study population included 8370 individuals inhabiting four villages and their satellites and representing high and low S. mansoni endemicity communities in Kafr EI-Sheikh governorate. A parasitological survey was conducted for three successive years (1991-1992 and 1993). Each time infected received praziquantel (PZQ) chemotherapy. In 1997, a fourth parasitological survey was done. During the period from 1994-1996 only routine diagnosis and treatment of schistosomiasis offered by the Ministry of Health and Population (MOHP) was going on. Study results revealed a decrease in S. mansoni prevalence and intensity of infection in the first three years. The drop was marked after the first year. In 1997, after the cessation of active case finding and treatment by the project team, an upward trend was observed for both prevalence and geometric mean egg count (GMEC) especially for the high prevalence villages. However, all indices were kept at significant low levels as compared to base-line values in 1991.",M2
17217031,"The effect of dimethylnitrosamine on the activities of renal prenolsulfotransferase and arylsulfatases A and B in Schistosona mansoni infected mice.The activities of renal phenolsulfotransferase and arylsulfatases A and B were estimated in 400 male Swiss albino mice classified into four groups: Normal controls, <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infected group, Dimethylnitrosamine (DMN) treated group and infected treated group. The activity levels of the studied enzymes were significantly increased in all groups when compared with the control group, also the statistical analyses showed a high significant increase of the three enzymes levels in the infected treated group; when compared separately with treated or infected groups. It was concluded, therefore, that schistosomal infection is implicated in the development of kidney cancer which may arise from the pattern of hepatic mixed-function oxidase induction characterized for schistosomiasis and its temporal relationship with the procarcinogenic initiating events. Furthermore, the striking significant increase in the enzymatic activity levels of the acid hydrolases arylsulfatases due to the lesion of both cytotoxic effects of dimethylnitrosamine as well as pathological change of schistosomiasis which may play an active role in the initiation of the malignant process by detoxifying endogenous sulfated aromatic metabolites.",M2
17216977,"Current status of S. mansoni infection in El-Prince village, Alexandria Governorate.The present work was implemented to determine the current status of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection in  El-Prince  village, near Alexandria, which was studied before as a control village between 1985 and 1990. Stool examination was performed on 571 of the inhabitants by Kato thick smear technique and intensity of infection was determined. Prevalence was found to be 15.4% with a percentage decrease of 53% from the 1990 survey. The geometric mean egg count (GMEC) ranged from 19.05 eggs/gram of stools in children aged five years or less to 81.86 in the oldest group greater than 50 years of age and averaged 42.26. Age stratified prevalence of infection peaked at 31.4% in the (20 to 25)-year-old age group. High prevalence of 23.6% was also observed in the age group from 36 to 50 years. Infection in males was higher than females (17.8% vs.13.5%). However the difference was not statistically significant (chi2 = 2.2, P = 0.0086). Risk factors significantly associated with the infection were an age more than 5 years, male gender, males with water contact activities and having done a previous laboratory analysis for schistosomiasis. The community category of the village changed from high prevalence in 1990 to moderate prevalence in 2002. Most of the infected individuals (85%) had light intensity of infection (less than 99 eggs /g stools). Active screening and treatment programs should be maintained in the area. More control measures should be directed towards older people who should be included in evaluation of control programs.",M2
17216955,"<e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection and cognitive functions of primary school children, in Kafr El Sheikh, Egypt.There is growing concern that parasitic infection may detrimentally affect children's mental function. In this study our main objective was to investigate the effects of schistosoma mansoni infection on cognitive functions of school children aged 9-12 years in Kafr El Sheikh Governorate. Out of 2601 children screened parasitologically, 60.7% were S. mansoni positive. Children recruited for the case-control study were 40 with light S. mansoni infection (&lt;100 epg), 40 with heavy infection (&gt;400 epg) and 40 parasite-free served as control. All children were subjected to the Arabic Version of Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC) and the Verbal Fluency Test. Though, the general IQ scores of infected children were insignificantly lower than their controls, yet they recorded a significantly lower performance IQ as well as, poorer performance on comprehension, vocabulary and picture completion subtests. Implications for preventive measures will be discussed.",M2
17180592,"Myeloradiculitis: a rare event in schistosoma infection.Schistosomiasis a parasitic disease caused by trematodes is widely distributed in (sub-)tropical countries. Depending on the species the infection manifests clinically as gastrointestinal (preferentially <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> and S. japonicum) or urinary (preferentially S. haematobium) disorders. Here we present an uncommon case of myeloradiculitis leading to bladder palsy and sensory loss at the lower limbs.",M2
17153713,"Effect of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection on physiological gastrointestinal transit and contractility.The work aimed to study the effect of Schistosoma mansoni (S. mansoni) on gastrointestinal transit and contractility of the colonic muscles of two subgroups of experimental mice, infected by 50 &amp; 200 cercaria/mouse respevtively, at 8th &amp; 12th week postinfection (PI). In addition, the histopathologic changes in the colon, and the immunological changes of the host were studied at different durations. At 8th weeks PI, in both subgroups, gastrointestinal transit was statistically significant decreased, in concurrent with statistically significant increase in the colonic muscle contractility compared to the controls. The colon was inflamed as shown by mucosal inflammatory infiltrates, with large size and number of schistosomal granulomas. The serum antigen was absent, while the serum antibody was detectable at low titre. At 12th weeks PI, there was a more statistically significant decrease in gastro-intestinal transit, and increase in the colonic muscle contractility. The colon was still inflamed, but the granulomas were reduced in size and in number, with increase in the fibrocytes density. These alterations coincided with absence of serum antigen and increase in the antibody titre. All changes were more pronounced in the 2nd group of mice (200 ceraria/mouse) than the 1st one (50 cercaria/mouse). So, intestinal schistosomiasis is associated with great structural, functional and immunological changes, related to the time course and the infection intensity which may be involved in the pathogenesis and clinical manifestations of the disease.",M2

16989687,"Differential expression of collagen, MMP, TIMP and fibrogenic-cytokine genes in the granulomatous colon of <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>-infected mice.Schistosomiasis mansoni is a major helminthic disease of the tropics characterised by chronic hepatic and intestinal granulomatous inflammation and fibrosis. The fibrotic response is regulated by the amount of collagen deposited in the tissues and the degradation of that collagen by matrix metalloproteinases (MMP). In the murine model of the disease, although hepatic granuloma formation and the ensuing fibrosis have been thoroughly examined, there is a dearth of information on the intestinal fibrotic process. The expression of fibrosis-related genes in the colons of chronically infected mice has therefore been investigated. Compared with that seen in uninfected mice, the expression of the genes coding for collagen of types I, III and IV was upregulated. Similarly, the messages for MMP-2, MMP-3 and MMP-8 were elevated, indicating the potential for collagen degradation. The genes for two tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMP), TIMP-1 and TIMP-4, were, however, expressed at higher levels than those coding for the MMP. As a corollary, expression of the genes coding for three fibrogenic cytokines, transforming growth factor-beta, tumour necrosis factor and interleukin-4, was elevated. These data indicate that an imbalance in MMP:TIMP expression and enhanced levels of the messages for fibrogenic cytokines underlie the mechanism(s) of the colonic fibrosis seen in mice chronically infected with Schistosoma mansoni.",M2
16903891,"Large scale evaluation of WHO's ultrasonographic staging system of schistosomal periportal fibrosis in Ethiopia.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the recent WHO's ultrasonographic diagnostic staging system of schistosomal periportal thickening/fibrosis and to assess intra/inter-observer variation associated with its use. METHODS: Local standard of portal branch wall thickness (PBWT) for height was established using 150 healthy subjects. Intra and inter-observer variation in image pattern identification and PBWT measurements were assessed in 94 and 35 subjects, respectively, with differing stages of periportal thickening fibrosis. WHO's diagnostic criteria were evaluated in 2,451 community members (1,277 males, 1,174 females; mean age 18.8 years) with an overall <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> prevalence estimate of 65.9%. RESULTS: There were no significant inter/intra-observer variations in image pattern identification and PBWT measurements. Based on Ethiopian PBWT-for-height standard, 128/2,451 (5.2%) had insipient, 46/2,451 (1.9%) had possible/probable and 112/2451 (4.6%) had definite/advanced periportal thickening/fibrosis. Comparable figures were obtained using the Senegalese PBWT-for-height standard and there was good agreement between Ethiopian and Senegalese healthy control-based diagnostic criteria in classifying the 286 subjects into stages of periportal thickening/fibrosis (kappa = 0.87, P &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: With further improvement, the WHO's ultrasonographic diagnostic criteria can be used in health institutions and community surveys. Image pattern based assessment is simple and more reproducible than PBWT based assessment of periportal thickening/fibrosis. The latter is, however, more useful in clarifying the status of an individual with doubtful image pattern, and in monitoring post-treatment outcome of periportal thickening/fibrosis. Considering the comparability of PBWT-for-height standards, setting one international standard of PBWT-for-height is more practical than developing local standards for each endemic area.",M2
16890257,"Human fascioliasis infection: gender differences within school-age children from endemic areas of the Nile Delta, Egypt.Several studies have reported a higher prevalence of infection for human fascioliasis among girls than among boys. To investigate this aspect further a sufficiently large data set was assembled comprising of 21,477 subjects with 932 positive cases. Subjects were primary school children covered by a control programme implemented by the Egyptian Ministry of Health and Population in the Nile Delta from 1988 to 2002. Stool analyses were performed by the Kato-Katz thick smear technique for a quantitative diagnosis on the intensity of infection. Both prevalence and intensity of infection, indirectly measured as mean number of eggs per gram of faeces, were significantly higher among girls than boys. The higher level of infection in girls was consistent across different years and in different survey areas. Co-infection with <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> was present and associated with fascioliasis, but schistosomiasis was significantly more prevalent among boys. In Egypt rural girls are often involved in household and farm work and are exposed more than boys to infected foci. The lower school attendance for girls in rural areas appears to be an important factor increasing risk of infection. The precise mode of transmission and behavioural risk factors for human infection need to be investigated further to identify those related to gender.",M2
16872044,"Excretory-secretory product of fasciola hepatica worm protects against <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection in mice.The objective of this study was to evaluate the protective immunity of excretory-secretory products of Fasciola hepatica (FhES) worm against S.mansoni infection in mice. Evaluation of FhES antigen was through measuring worm burden, ova count, granuloma size and frequency as well as the histopathological picture of the liver. The study was extended to determine the level of free radical scavengers; lipid peroxide, glutathione (GSH), vitamin C, vitamin E, catalase and superoxide dismutase (SOD). Liver function enzymes such as aspartate aminotransferase (AST), alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were also taken into consideration. Four groups of eight mice each were selected for this study. Group 1 served as control group. Group 2: normal healthy mice vaccinated with FhES product. Group 3: S.mansoni infected mice for 2 months and group 4: infected mice pre-vaccinated with FhES antigen. Vaccination schedule comprised of a single subcutaneous injection of FhES antigen emulsified with Freund's complete adjuvant in a dose 0.5 mg protein/mouse, followed by intraperitoneal injections of the same antigen without adjuvant in 3 doses/week for 3 successive weeks. The total antigen inoculation was 5 mg protein/mouse. The present results revealed a drastic change in all the measured parameters after S.mansoni infection and a noticeable improved level after vaccination with FhES antigen. It can be concluded that FhES antigen succeeded to protect mice against schistosomiasis by a significant reduction in worm burden, ova count, granuloma size and number, improvement in the histopathological architecture of the liver as well as amelioration in the antioxidant levels under investigation.",M2
17101652,"Differential liver protein expression during schistosomiasis.The arrival of eggs in the liver during <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e> infection initiates a protective granulomatous response; however, as the infection progresses, this response results in chronic liver fibrosis. To better understand the impact of schistosomiasis on liver function, we used a proteomic approach to identify proteins whose expression was significantly altered in schistosome-infected mice 8 weeks postinfection. Identification of differentially expressed proteins by mass fingerprinting revealed that schistosome infection markedly reduced the abundance of proteins associated with several normal liver functions (i.e., citric acid cycle, fatty acid cycle, and urea cycle), while proteins associated with stress responses, acute phase reactants, and structural components were all significantly more abundant. The expression patterns of several immunity-related proteins (peroxiredoxin 1, arginase 1, and galectin 1) suggested that different protein forms are associated with schistosome infection. These findings indicate that acute schistosomiasis has a significant impact on specific liver functions and, moreover, that the alterations in specific protein isoforms and upregulation of unique proteins may be valuable as new markers of disease.",M2
17049461,"Noradrenaline-induced contraction of mice aorta is enhanced in schistosomiasis.Schistosomiasis, an intravascular parasitic disease caused by <e>Schistosoma mansoni</e>, is related to alterations of murine vascular reactivity in the mesenteric bed, characterized by an impairment of the l-arginine/NO pathway and an increased potency of 5-hydroxytryptamine. The current study was performed to test the hypothesis that a similar alteration of reactivity also occurs in the aorta and to identify the mechanism behind such an increase. We found that aorta from mice infected with male S. mansoni exhibited an enhanced contraction in response to noradrenaline and 100 mM KCl. The inhibition of nitric oxide synthase increased aortic maximal contraction in response to noradrenaline in both groups, but the effect was less pronounced in infected mice than in control mice. Endothelium-dependent relaxation induced by acetylcholine was also smaller in infected mice compared to control mice, while endothelial-independent relaxation induced by sodium nitroprusside and forskolin was similar in both groups. The inhibition of voltage-dependent L-type Ca(2+) channels reduced the maximal contraction in response to noradrenaline more effectively in infected than in control mice. Conversely the inhibition of K(ATP) channels had a smaller effect in the infected group. As a conclusion, our data indicate that schistosomiasis also alters murine vascular reactivity outside the mesenteric bed, due to a partial impairment of NO signaling, a reduced contribution of K(ATP) channels and an increased Ca(2+) influx through L-type Ca(2+) channels.",M2
