19685104,"Locomotor evolution of Mesopithecus (Primates: Colobinae) from Greece: evidence from selected astragalar characters.This paper reports our investigations into functional aspects of the <e>astragalus</e> of four samples of the genus Mesopithecus from Greece. More particularly, it aims to infer substrate preferences of M. delsoni/pentelicus from the Middle Turolian site of Perivolaki (central Greece), M. pentelicus from the late Middle Turolian site of Pikermi (southern Greece), and M. cf. pentelicus and M. cf. monspessulanus from the Late Turolian site of Dytiko (northern Greece). For these purposes, selected astragalar functional features, such as trochlea wedging, proximal facet curvature, and head rotation were expressed as linear measurements on both fossil and selected extant colobines. The size-adjusted measurements were used for univariate comparisons as well as a multivariate principal components analysis. Both approaches revealed that the selected characters were able to discriminate between extant arboreal and semiterrestrial colobines, but all fossil forms presented mosaic morphology. Thus, the oldest representative, M. delsoni/pentelicus was reconstructed as mainly semiterrestrial. On the other hand, the astragalus of M. pentelicus appeared to reflect semiterrestrial habits with a moderate adaptation to arboreality. Similar habitus reconstruction was allocated to the more recent M. cf. pentelicus, whereas the sympatric and synchronous M. cf. monspessulanus showed semiterrestrial adaptations with a slight preference of terrestrial substrates. The results mainly conform to paleoenvironmental reconstructions of the fossiliferous localities and denote that Mesopithecus was mainly a semiterrestrial radiation throughout its evolutionary history, with differential rates of use between arboreal and terrestrial substrates. These adaptations could have promoted the dispersal of the genus throughout Eurasia during the latest Miocene and Early Pliocene.",M1
16421891,"Evolution and homology of the <e>astragalus</e> in early amniotes: new fossils, new perspectives.The reorganization of the ankle in basal amniotes has long been considered a key innovation allowing the evolution of more terrestrial and cursorial behavior. Understanding how this key innovation arose is a complex problem that largely concerns the homologizing of the amniote astragalus with the various ossifications in the anamniote tarsus. Over the last century, several hypotheses have been advanced homologizing the amniote astragalus with the many ossifications in the ankle of amphibian-grade tetrapods. There is an emerging consensus that the amniote astragalus is a complex structure emerging via the co-ossification of several originally separate elements, but the identities of these elements remain unclear. Here we present new fossil evidence bearing on this contentious question. A poorly ossified, juvenile astragalus of the large captorhinid Moradisaurus grandis shows clear evidence of four ossification centers, rather than of three centers or one center as posited in previous models of astragalus homology. Comparative material of the captorhinid Captorhinikos chozaensis is also interpretable as demonstrating four ossification centers. A new, four-center model for the homology of the amniote astragalus is advanced, and is discussed in the context of the phylogeny of the Captorhinidae in an attempt to identify the developmental transitions responsible for the observed pattern of ossification within this clade. Lastly, the broader implications for amniote phylogeny are discussed, concluding that the neomorphic pattern of astragalus ossification seen in all extant reptiles (including turtles) arose within the clade Diapsida.",M1

12025102,"Our experience in the treatment of fractures of the <e>astragalus</e>.The authors evaluate the results of a series of cases treated by surgery for fractures of the astragalus at the IInd Orthopaedic Division of the University of Pisa between 1978 and 1998. Treatment consisted in reduction and stabilization of the fractures by percutaneous route or by anterolateral approach. Prognosis for fractures of the neck worsens as the Hawkins radiographic classification of degrees increases. Based on the Hawkins clinical evaluation form, excellent and good results were obtained in 56% of cases. Radiographic evaluation confirmed the effectiveness of the Hawkins sign for the prediction of necrosis of the body; this necrosis occurred in 37.5% of cases; arthrosis of the astragalus developed in about half of the patients, which was, however, not always associated with stiffness of this joint. A stiff astragalus was the most fastidious complication, after necrosis of the astragalar body.",M1
11782110,"Astragalar morphology of late Eocene anthropoids from the Fayum Depression (Egypt) and the origin of catarrhine primates.The phylogenetic relationships of the late Eocene anthropoids Catopithecus browni and Proteopithecus sylviae are currently a matter of debate, with opinion divided as to whether these taxa are stem or crown anthropoids. The phylogenetic position of Catopithecus is of particular interest, for, unlike the highly generalized genus Proteopithecus, this taxon shares apomorphic dental and postcranial features with more derived undoubted catarrhines that appear in the same region 1-2 Ma later. If these apomorphies are homologous and Catopithecus is a stem catarrhine, the unique combination of plesiomorphic and apomorphic features preserved in this anthropoid would have important implications for our understanding of the crown anthropoid morphotype and the pattern of morphological character transformations that occurred during the early phases of stem catarrhine evolution.Well-preserved astragali referrable to Proteopithecus, Catopithecus, and the undoubted early Oligocene stem catarrhine Aegyptopithecus have provided additional morphological evidence that allows us to further evaluate competing hypotheses of interrelationships among Eocene-Oligocene Afro-Arabian anthropoids. Qualitative observations and multivariate morphometric analyses reveal that the astragalar morphology of Proteopithecus is very similar to that of early Oligocene parapithecids and living and extinct small-bodied platyrrhines, and strengthens the hypothesis that the morphological pattern shared by these taxa is primitive within crown Anthropoidea. In contrast, Catopithecus departs markedly from the predicted crown anthropoid astragalar morphotype and shares a number of apomorphic features (e.g., deep cotylar fossa, laterally projecting fibular facet, trochlear asymmetry, mediolaterally wide astragalar head) with Aegyptopithecus and Miocene-Recent catarrhines. The evidence from the <e>astragalus</e> complements other independent data from the dentition, humerus and femur of Catopithecus that support this taxon's stem catarrhine status, and we continue to maintain that oligopithecines are stem catarrhines that constitute the sister group of a clade containing propliopithecines and Miocene-Recent catarrhines.",M1

1887665,"Toward the locomotion of two contemporaneous Adapis species.The morphological differences between the limb bones of two Adapis species from two localities in Southern France are analyzed for their functional significance. The study focuses on the distal humerus, proximal femur, <e>astragalus</e> and calcaneum. The Escamps species Adapis aff. betillei shows more extreme flexion at the elbow, lateral mobility at the hip, and more rotation at the calcaneocuboid joint than in the other species. The species from Rosières 2 A. cf. parisiensis shows increased emphasis on parasagittal movements, restrictions of lateral mobility in the hindlimb, enhanced capacity for rapid flexion and powerful extension of the thigh, and powerful rapid foot extension. The Rosières species probably engaged in more frequent branch walking and running, and the Escamps species probably included more climbing in its locomotor repertoire. In the general Adapis genus morphology, the large tuber calcanei, short astragalus, and the presence of a calcaneal  pressure facet  are similarities shared with living cercopithecids. Along with other characters, these suggest that horizontal running was possibly an important means of locomotion in the Adapis and adapine morphotypes, and may even indicate a degree of terrestraility. Contrary to the most common view, the euprimate morphotype was probably not a specialized leaper.",M1

Of the foot bones only intra-articular fractures of the <e>astragalus</e> should be corrected because of its key position and the involvement of three joints. In double and triple arthrodesis, the axes and lengths of the medial and lateral columns should be corrected to prevent arthritis at the higher or lower joint level.

The arthrodeses were all carried out using the same technique of osteotomy of the lateral malleolus and fixation with a Charnley compression device. The main indication for fusion was post-traumatic arthritis. The number of complications, most of them benign, was not negligible and amounted to 42 per cent, including superficial infections, skin necroses and lesions of the posterior tibial nerve. Revision operations were needed in 17.5 per cent of cases during the year after operation, most of them for malposition. The clinical results were satisfactory in three-quarters of the cases and poor in one-quarter. Radiological changes in the joints distal to the fusion were relatively marked in the subtaloid joint and slightly less in the midtarsal joint. Theses changes are a source of concern for the future because of their pre-arthritic appearance and their progressive nature. Adaptive hypermobility of the midtarsal joint was seen in only one-third of the cases. The changes were greater when the hindfoot was in equinus, a position which was often aimed for in this series. The author advises internal fixation with screws and discusses the future potential for arthroplasty.",M1

20209962,"[Antioxidant activity of different extracts from <e>Astragalus</e> mongholicus]OBJECTIVE: To study the antioxidant activities of different extracts from Astragalus mongholicus. METHOD: The antioxidant activities of the total flavanoids (TFA), the total saponins (TSA) and the total polysaccharides (TPA) from A. mongholicus were measured by means of biochemiluminescence. The concentrations of these samples varied from 1.25 x 10(-3) g x L(-1) to 25 x10(-3) g x L(-1). RESULT: All the extracts showed antioxidant activities of scavenging 3 different free radicals with obvious concentration-scavenging capacity relationship. The antioxidant activity of TFA was the strongest among them. The IC50 of scavenging superoxide anion radicals of TFA (55.48% TFA, 0.59% TFA and 0.36% TFA) were 0.654 2, 4.654 4 and 6.055 2 g x L(-1), the IC50 of scavenging hydroxyl anion were 0.060 5, 0.254 4 and 0.493 0 g x L(-1), and the IC50 of scavenging hydrogen peroxide were 0.010 4, 0.156 0 and 0.224 0 g x L(-1), respectively. CONCLUSION: The extracts are more sensitive to hydrogen peroxide and hydroxyl anion than to superoxide anion radicals. TFA of A. mongholicus Bunge is the main component responsible for antioxidant activity, while TSA and TPA have weaker antioxidant activity. The antioxidant activity of TFA increases with the rise of its purity. On the contrary, the antioxidant activity of TSA and TPA decreases with the rise of their purity.",M2

On 14, 28 and 42 days after the first vaccination, the serum IL-2 concentration was determined by Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA). The results showed that at most time points, the lymphocyte proliferation, antibody titers and IL-2 concentrations of 5 medicine-administrating groups were significantly higher than that of corresponding NM group. At some time points, the lymphocyte proliferation, antibody titers and IL-2 concentrations in high and medium doses of AP-OM groups were significantly or numberly higher than those in AP group and OM group. It indicated that AP-OM could significantly improve the immune efficacy of Newcastle disease vaccine, astragalus polysaccharide and oxymatrine possessed synergistical immunoenhancement.",M2
20129766,"Effect of purified saponin mixture from <e>Astragalus</e> corniculatus on enzyme- and non-enzyme-induced lipid peroxidation in liver microsomes from spontaneously hypertensive rats and normotensive rats.The aim of the following study was to evaluate the effect of a purified saponin mixture (PSM), isolated from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb. (Fabaceae), on enzyme-induced and non-enzyme-induced lipid peroxidation (LPO), in liver microsomes from spontaneously hypertensive rats (SHRs) - strain Okamoto Aoki, as compared to normotensive Wistar rats (NTRs). The enzyme-induced lipid peroxidation was performed by incubating rat liver microsomes with carbonetetrachloride (CCl(4)) in the presence of NADPH. In nonenzyme-induced LPO, the microsomes were incubated with a solution of iron sulphate and ascorbinic acid (Fe(2+)/AA). The effect of PSM (196.5 microg/ml) was assessed at 20 minutes' incubation time. MDA, a product of LPO, was measured spectrophotometrically. The results of our study showed that the initial MDA quantity in SHRs was significantly higher, than in NTRs. The incubation of the microsomes from both strains with PSM (196.5 microg/ml), resulted in significant reduction of MDA level, by 25% in SHRs. In NTRs, the formation of MDA was unchanged. In enzyme-induced LPO model, PSM significantly decreased the formation of MDA, by 55% in NTRs and by 35% in SHRs, compared to the respective control groups. In the model of non-enzyme induced LPO, PSM significantly decreased the formation of MDA by 95% in NTRs and practically restored it to the control level. The MDA quantity in SHR's microsomes was reduced by 25%. According to the results of this experiment we could conclude that PSM, isolated from Astragalus corniculatus, shows antioxidant activity both in SHRs and NTRs and the effect in NTRs is more pronounced.",M2

The highest PAL activity (2.71 U microg protein(-1) min(-1)) was measured at 36 hr after addition of yeast extract and increasing of total phenolics accompanied with 221 microg g(-1) value as fresh weight (FW). Total phenolic content reached maximum value, 343.86 microg g(-1) FW, at 48 hr while control's value was 162 microg g(-1) FW. Maximum PAL activity and total phenolic content were 2.88 and 2.12 times higher than the controls of A. chrysochlorus cells, respectively. Our results indicate that there is a positive correlation between induced PAL activity and accumulation of total phenolics. It is considered that early defense response given to environmental stressors such as biotic and abiotic factors by upregulation of phenolic branch of secondary metabolism occurs in A. chrysochlorus with addition of yeast extract.",M2
20069894,"[Culture-filtrate producing condition and biological activity of Fusarium solani]OBJECTIVE: To study the culture-filtrate producing condition of Fusarium Solani isolated from <e>Astragalus</e> root and explore the mechanism Astragalus root rot disease caused by, in order to find theoretical support for screening resistant germ plasma via mycotoxin. METHOD: The method of germinating seeds in petri dish with filter paper and inhibition method for embryo growth were used to study the biological activity and the specialty of cultural filtrate of 10 F. solani isolates. RESULT: The toxin produced by F. solani had strong inhibition effect in the different nutrient media, at different temperatures and under different light conditions. With extension of culturing time, embryo inhibition rate went up gradually with the strongest inhibition at the 12th day and the inhibition ratio between 92.0% -52.0%. The toxin produced at 5 degrees C to 35 degrees C inhibited embryo germination of Astragalus differently with the strongest at 25 degrees C, and next to it at 20,30 degrees C. The impact of light on bioactive substances of the toxin was not statistically distinctive, but the 24-hour darkness was benefit to toxin production. PSC had a stronger inhibition rate than the other nutrient media, next to it was PDB. After autoclaving, the toxin still kept toxic to embryo of Astragalus, which indicated that the toxin was tolerant to high temperatures. CONCLUSION: The toxin produced by F. solani at different growing condition had strong biological activity, was tolerant to high temperature. The best condition for F. solani to produce toxin was that it was cultured in PSC liquid medium, in dark, at 25 degrees C for 12 d. The toxin produced by isolate HQM40 was non-host specific toxin.",M2

All cotyledon node was precultured in medium for 3 days and infected with Agrobacterium (A600 0.3) for 10 min and then cocultured for 2 days. The aFGF gene was confirmed to transform into genome of Astragalus. CONCLUSION: A high-frequency regeneration system of Astragalus and an aFGF transformation system were established.",M2
19960563,"Inhibitory effect of emodin and <e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharide on the replication of HBV.AIM: To evaluate the anti-viral effect of emodin plus Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) in hepatitis B virus (HBV) transgenic mice. METHODS: Sixty HBV transgenic mice (HBV TGM) whose weight varied between 18 and 24 g were randomly divided into 3 groups, with 20 mice in each group. Group A was the normal control, where the mice were treated with physiological saline; group B was the positive control where the mice were treated with lamivudine solution (100 mL/kg per day). Group C was the experimental group where the mice were treated with physiological saline containing emodin and APS (57.59 mg/kg per day and 287.95 mg/kg per day, respectively). The mice were treated daily for 3 wk. After 1 wk recovery time, the mice were sacrificed and serum as well as liver tissues were collected for ELISA and histological examination. RESULTS: After 21 d treatment, HBV DNA levels in group B and group C significantly declined when compared with group A (P &lt; 0.05). However, a significant increase in HBV DNA content was observed in group B, whereas this phenomenon was not observed in group C. A reduction in the contents of HBsAg, HBeAg and HBcAg in the mice from group B and C was observed when compared with group A. CONCLUSION: Emodin and APS have a weak but persistent inhibitory effect on HBV replication in vivo, which may function as a supplementary modality in the treatment of hepatitis B infection.",M2
19796139,"Horizontal gene transfer and recombination shape mesorhizobial populations in the gene center of the host plants <e>Astragalus</e> luteolus and Astragalus ernestii in Sichuan, China.Thirty-three rhizobial strains isolated from the root nodules of Astragalus luteolus and Astragalus ernestii growing on the west plateau at two different altitudes in Sichuan province, China, were characterized by amplified rDNA restriction analysis (ARDRA), amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP), and by sequencing of rrs, glnA, glnII and nifH. The ARDRA analysis revealed considerable genomic diversity. In AFLP analysis, 20 of 33 Astragalus rhizobia formed three distinct clades, with others dispersed into different groups with the reference strains. Phylogenetic analysis of the rrs gene of six representative strains showed that the isolates were members of the genus Mesorhizobium. Three of the isolates formed a sister clade to Mesorhizobium loti and Mesorhizobium ciceri, whereas the other three formed a sister clade to a clade harboring the species Mesorhizobium huakuii, Mesorhizobium plurifarum, Mesorhizobium septentrionale and Mesorhizobium amorphae, indicating the existence of two new species. Phylogenetic analysis of glnA and glnII confirmed the rrs phylogenies for four strains, but the trees were incongruent. The nifH sequences of the strains formed a monophyletic clade and were typical of those of mesorhizobia forming symbioses with inverted repeat lacking clade legume species. The incongruent phylogenies of the genes studied suggest that horizontal gene transfer and recombination shape mesorhizobial populations in the gene center of the host plants.",M2
19723248,"Phylogenetic origin of Phyllolobium with a further implication for diversification of <e>Astragalus</e> in China.Astragalus is a species-rich genus occurring in the western arid habitats in China and its diversification and infrageneric relationships in this region remain unclear. In the present study, based on molecular data, we aim to (i) test whether Phyllolobium (previously treated as a subgenus Pogonophace in Astragalus) should be warranted; and (ii) date the origin of Phyllolobium and probable diversification of Astragalus sensu stricto (s.s.). We sequenced five species from Phyllolobium first and collected all related sequences from the genus, Astragalus s.s and their close relatives (Oxytropis and Caragana etc.). Our phylogenetic analyses suggested that all species of Phyllolobium comprise a monophyletic sister-group to genera of the subtribe Coluteinae. Molecular dating suggested that Phyllolobium and Astragalus s.s. originated around 8 and 10 million years ago. These two estimates are highly consistent with the intense uplifts of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau inferred from geological evidence. In addition, one section of Pogonophace (Sect. Robusti) was estimated to originate 2.5 million years ago and this section with a tendency for dry habitats seems to be evidence of Asian intensified aridity resulting from the intense uplift of the Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau.",M2
19711774,"Severe asthma with markedly increased asbestos of 2 types &amp; TXB2, and markedly reduced acetylcholine, DHEA &amp; drug uptake in parts of upper lungs, &amp; similar abnormalities at respiratory &amp; cardiac center of medulla oblongata: complete elimination of this asthma within 15 days using one optimal dose of <e>astragalus</e> &amp; application of strong red light &amp; EMF neutralizer on respiratory centers of abnormal medulla oblongata.When the window of an Asbestos-contaminated room from a broken ceiling was opened wide, A 73 year-old male physician of Oriental origin, who was sitting in the next room, suddenly developed a severe asthma attack, which did not stop by the use of a hand-held Albuterol inhaler. Temporary relief was obtained only by using a Compressor-Nebulizer (Inspiration 626 with Albuterol Sulfate Inhalation Solution 0.083%). During the attack, abnormal areas were discovered at the upper lobes of both lungs, where Thromboxane B2 (TXB2) was markedly increased to 500 ng (BDORT units) (the rest of the lung had about 2.5 ng), 2 types of Asbestos (Chrysotile and Crocidolite) were abnormally increased to 0.120-0.135 mg, (BDORT units) Acetylcholine was markedly reduced to 0.5 ng (the rest of the lung was low, about 100 ng), DHEA was extremely reduced to 1 ng (the rest of the lung had about 52 ng), and telomere was less than 1 yg (= 10(-24) g). Bacterial &amp; viral infections were also present in these abnormal areas, but no antibiotics entered the abnormal parts of the lungs. Therefore, one optimal dose of Astragalus was given once, which resulted in a rapid continuous excretion of large amounts of the above 2 types of Asbestos &amp; TXB2 in urine &amp; sputum, and Asthma symptoms reduced slightly in severity. Additional acupuncture &amp; shiatsu given on all the known acupuncture points for lung disease only created slight, temporary improvement. Then, the respiratory &amp; cardiac center of the Medulla Oblongata was found to have similar abnormalities as the lungs. Therefore, 100 mW output of Light Emitting Diode of red spectra (650 nm center spectrum) was projected on the abnormal area of the medulla oblongata on the back of the head. This resulted drug uptake of on and off and significantly reduced difficulty of breathing. Additional application of the EMF Neutralizer on the abnormal area of the Medulla Oblongata for 3 hours resulted in continuous drug uptake and complete disappearance of asthma. As a result of one optimal dose of Astragalus, the remaining Asbestos in the lungs &amp; medulla oblongata was completely excreted in the urine and Sputum in 2 weeks. Then, even when the patient entered the Asbestos-contaminated room and slept there every day without opening the window, no asthma attack occurred even as late as 5 months later.",M2
19681610,"Astragalosides isolated from the root of <e>astragalus</e> radix inhibit the formation of advanced glycation end products.Because advanced glycation end product (AGE) inhibitors such as pyridoxamine significantly inhibit the development of retinopathy and neuropathy in the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat, treatment with AGE inhibitors is believed to be a potential strategy for the prevention of lifestyle-related diseases such as diabetic complications. A crude extract of Astragali Radix (AR; roots of Astragalus membranaceus ) inhibits the formation of N(epsilon)-(carboxymethyl)lysine (CML) and pentosidine during the incubation of bovine serum albumin with ribose. In the present study, compounds were isolated from AR that prevented CML and pentosidine formation. Astragalosides significantly inhibited the formation of both CML and pentosidine, and astragaloside V had the strongest inhibitory effect among all if the isolated compounds. These data suggest that AR and astragalosides may be a potentially useful strategy for the prevention of clinical diabetic complications by inhibiting AGEs.",M2
19664469,"Discrimination of different genera <e>Astragalus</e> samples via quantitative symmetry analysis of two-dimensional hetero correlation spectra.It has been proved to be a very useful method to distinguish similar samples by two-dimensional correlation spectroscopy when they are hardly distinguished by the conventional one-dimensional spectroscopy. To acquire the quantitative description of the differences between samples, the similarity of the series dynamic spectra, which reflects the similarity of the samples themselves if obtained under the same perturbation condition, is evaluated by the symmetry of hetero 2DCOS map. Two parameters, the Euclidian distance and correlation coefficient between the upper left and lower right triangular parts of a hetero 2DCOS map, are introduced for the quantitative measure of the symmetry, which in turn characterizes the similarity of the responses of samples to a given perturbation. The above method is used to discriminate one genus of Astragalus from the others to ensure the medicinal efficacy and safety of the herb. Hypothesis tests show that the inter-distances between samples from different genera are significantly larger than the intra-ones within the same genera, while the inter-correlation coefficients are smaller than the intra-ones. The excellent result of the identification for all samples carried out by a t-test based on the distances indicates that this method provides an efficient technique for the quantitative evaluation of similarity between samples.",M2
19653348,"<e>Astragalus</e> mongholicus polysaccharide inhibits lipopolysaccharide-induced production of TNF-alpha and interleukin-8.AIM: To explore the effect of Astragalus mongholicus polysaccharide (APS) on gene expression and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) transcriptional activity in intestinal epithelial cells (IEC). METHODS: IEC were divided into control group, lipopolysaccharide (LPS) group, LPS+ 50 microg/mL APS group, LPS+ 100 microg/mL APS group, LPS+ 200 microg/mL APS group, and LPS+ 500 microg/mL APS group. Levels of mRNAs in LPS-induced inflammatory factors, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha and interleukin (IL)-8, were measured by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. MAPK protein level was measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: The levels of TNF-alpha and IL-8 mRNAs were significantly higher in IEC with LPS-induced damage than in control cells. APS significantly abrogated the LPS-induced expression of the TNF-alpha and IL-8 genes. APS did not block the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase or c Jun amino-terminal kinase, but inhibited the activation of p38, suggesting that APS inhibits LPS-induced production of TNF-alpha and IL-8 mRNAs, possibly by suppressing the p38 signaling pathway. CONCLUSION: APS-modulated bacterial product-mediated p38 signaling represents an attractive strategy for prevention and treatment of intestinal inflammation.",M2
19653192,"Protective effect of <e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharides on ATP binding cassette transporter A1 in THP-1 derived foam cells exposed to tumor necrosis factor-alpha.Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), the main extract from the traditional Chinese medicinal herb Astragalus membranaceus, has been reported to benefit the treatment of immune-inflammatory diseases and metabolic disorders. In atherosclerotic plaques, proinflammatory cytokines exert adverse effects on lipids thereby aggravating atherosclerosis. Recent evidence shows that tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) can down-regulate the expression of ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1), which plays a vital role in reverse cholesterol transport and determines the process of atherosclerosis. In the present study, the effects of APS on ABCA1 expression, cholesterol effluent rate and total cholesterol content of THP-1 derived foam cells exposed to TNF-alpha were investigated. Compared with the foam cells exposed to TNF-alpha, ABCA1 expression was promoted in the presence of APS. Consequently the cholesterol effluent rate increased and the total cholesterol content decreased significantly. TNF-alpha could enhance the activity of nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in the foam cells. This effect could be attenuated by APS. These findings suggest that APS could protect ABCA1 against the lesion of TNF-alpha in THP-1 derived foam cells, which may contribute to its antiatherosclerotic properties.",M2
19578991,"Anti-convulsant effect and mechanism of <e>Astragalus</e> mongholicus extract in vitro and in vivo: protection against oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction.Astragalus mongholicus (AM) is a traditional medicinal herb used as a neuroprotective agent for its anxiolytic, antidepressant, antiamnestic, and antiaggresive effects. However, the mechanisms underlying its anti-convulsant properties are not well studied. In the present study, we examined the anticonvulsant effects on pentylenetetrazol (PTZ)-induced seizures in mice and the possible mechanisms of protection against oxidative damage and mitochondrial dysfunction in vitro. The behavioral studies showed that the root extract of AM had powerful anticonvulsant effects against seizures induced by PTZ and the biochemical studies showed that root extract of AM inhibited PTZ-induced increase in lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation and reactive oxygen species, and enhanced mitochondrial function. Electron spin resonance spectroscopy studies demonstrated that the extracts from the root and aerial parts of AM possess potent effects on scavenging hydroxyl and lipid free radicals. We found that AM extract significantly protected malondialdehyde-induced oxidative damage by ameliorating activities of the mitochondrial complexes I, II, malate dehydrogenase and mitochondrial membrane potential. These data suggest that the anti-convulsant effects of AM extract may be mediated by its protective actions against oxidative damage and amelioration of mitochondrial dysfunction.",M2

19545150,"Quantitative PCR method to measure the fungal endophyte in locoweeds.A fungal endophyte ( Undifilum oxytropis ) has been implicated in the synthesis of swainsonine in Oxytropis and <e>Astragalus</e> species, commonly known as locoweeds. A quantitative PCR method has been developed to measure the amount of endophyte in Oxytropis and Astragalus species. The limit of quantitation was estimated to be 0.2 pg of endophyte/ng of total DNA. This method of analysis was used to quantify the amount of endophyte in 10 plants each of Oxytropis sericea (white point locoweed), Astragalus mollissimus (wooly locoweed), and Astragalus lentiginosus (spotted locoweed). A significant amount of individual plant variability was observed in endophyte content among individuals in all three species. In one O. sericea and one A. lentiginosus plant swainsonine concentrations were near or below the limit of detection. These plants also had the lowest amounts of endophyte when compared to the other specimens. This method will be a useful tool in further investigating the role the endophyte plays in swainsonine production in various locoweed species.",M2
19524131,"<e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharides decreased the expression of PTP1B through relieving ER stress induced activation of ATF6 in a rat model of type 2 diabetes.Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) was considered as a potential therapeutic target of type 2 diabetes (T2DM) because of its negative regulation of insulin signaling. It located on the cytosolic surface of endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and played an essential role in the ER stress signaling. Activating transcription factor 6 (ATF6) was an ER stress regulated transmembrane transcription factor that activated the transcription of ER molecular chaperones. We hypothesized that the expression of PTP1B may be regulated by ATF6 when ER stress happened. Our previous studies showed that Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) increased the insulin sensitivity through decreasing the overexpression of PTP1B in T2DM animal models. In this study, we intended to investigate the possible mechanisms involved in this effect. A rat model of T2DM was established using high fat diet associated with intraperitoneal injection of 25 mg/kg streptozocin; 25 mmol/l D-glucose and 5x10(-7) mol/l insulin were used as in vitro investigations to mimic T2DM-like environment. 4-(2-Aminoethyl) benzenesulfonyl fluoride hydrochloride (AEBSF) and pCI-Flag-ATF6(N)(2-366) plasmid were treated separately on human hepatocyte line HL-7702 to observe the effect of ATF6 on the expression of PTP1B. The results suggested that APS not only restored the glucose homeostasis but also reduced the ER stress in this rat model of T2DM; ATF6 was involved in mediating the expression of PTP1B when ER stress happened; APS decreased the expression of PTP1B at least partly through inhibiting the activation of ATF6.",M2
19494030,"Population genetics of <e>Astragalus</e> bibullatus (Fabaceae) using AFLPs.Astragalus bibullatus (Fabaceae) is an endangered plant species endemic to limestone cedar glades in Tennessee. Data from 134 amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) fragments indicate that populations of this species are genetically very similar, with genetic identity values ranging from 0.976 to 0.991. Approximately 10% of the species' total genetic variation is due to differences among populations (F(ST) = 0.102), and a principle coordinate analysis based on genetic distance among individuals revealed considerable overlap between populations. Averaging across populations, 38.4% of the AFLP markers were polymorphic, and the mean expected heterozygosity was 0.120. These estimates are higher than what has previously been reported for this species based on a survey of allozyme variation. Despite the overall similarity of populations of this species, a model-based clustering approach revealed the presence of 2 (possibly 3) genetically distinct subgroups. The results of this study highlight the utility of DNA-based markers for conservation genetic studies in genetically depauperate species and reveal that detectable levels of genetic substructuring may be present even in relatively undifferentiated species.",M2

METHODS: PC12 cells were damaged by XA/XO. The activities of antioxidant enzymes, MTT, LDH, and GSH assays were used to evaluate the protection of these five isoflavonoids. Contents of Bcl-2 family proteins were determined with flow cytometry. RESULTS: Among the five isoflavonoids including formononetin, ononin, 9, 10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucoside, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside were found to inhibit XA/ XO-induced injury to PC12 cells. Their EC50 values of formononetin and calycosin were 0.05 microg/mL. Moreover, treatment with these three isoflavonoids prevented a decrease in the activities of antioxidant enzymes, superoxide dismutase (SOD) and glutathione peroxidase (GSH-Px), while formononetin and calycosin could prevent a significant deletion of GSH. In addition, only calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside were shown to inhibit XO activity in cell-free system, with an approximate IC50 value of 10 microg/mL and 50 microg/mL. Formononetin and calycosin had no significant influence on Bcl-2 or Bax protein contents. CONCLUSION: Neuroprotection of formononetin, calycosin and calycosin-7-O-glucoside may be mediated by increasing endogenous antioxidants, rather by inhibiting XO activities or by scavenging free radicals.",M2

Hsiao is a widely used traditional Chinese medicine. The present study investigated the potential role of AM on renal fibrosis on a rat model of unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO). We divided 48 Sprague-Dawley rats randomly into 4 groups: sham-operated group (Sham), untreated UUO group, AM-treated (10 g/(kg x d)) UUO group, and losartan-treated (20 mg/(kg x d)) UUO group as positive control. Haematoxylin &amp; eosin (HE) and Masson staining were used to study the dynamic histological changes of the kidneys 7 and 14 d after operation. The expressions of fibronectin (FN), type I collagen (colI), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1), and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) were analyzed by real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR), immunohistochemistry staining, and Western blot. Results show that, similar to losartan, AM alleviated the renal damage and decreased the deposition of FN and colI from UUO by reducing the expressions of TGF-beta1 and alpha-SMA (P&lt;0.05), whereas HGF increased greatly with AM treatment (P&lt;0.05). Our findings reveal that AM could retard the progression of renal fibrosis. The renoprotective effect of AM might be related to inhibition of myofibroblast activation, inducing of HGF and reducing of TGF-beta1 expression.",M2

The present study was carried out to evaluate the effects of these flavonoids from Astragalus complanatus (FAC) on human hepatocarcinoma cell viability and apoptosis and to investigate its mechanisms of action in SMMC-7721 cells. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Cell viability was measured using the MTT assay. To detect apoptotic cells, SMMC-7721 cells treated with FAC were stained with Hoechst 33258 and subjected to agarose gel electrophoresis. Quantitative detection of apoptotic cells was performed by flow cytometry. The effects of FAC on apoptosis and cell cycle regulatory genes and proteins in SMMC-7721 cells were examined using an S series apoptosis and cell cycle gene array and Western blot analysis. RESULTS: The growth of SMMC-7721 and HepG2 cells was inhibited by treatment with FAC. Cell death induced by FAC was characterized by nuclear condensation and DNA fragmentation. Moreover, the cell cycle was arrested in the G0/G1 and S phases in FAC-treated SMMC-7721 cells. A sub-G1 peak with reduced DNA content was also formed. The activity of caspase-3 was significantly increased following FAC treatment. Microarray data indicated that the expression levels of 76 genes were changed in SMMC-7721 cells treated with FAC: 35 genes were up-regulated and 41 were down-regulated. Western blot analysis showed that caspase-3, caspase-8, Bax, P21, and P27 protein levels in SMMC-7721 cells were increased after 48 h of FAC treatment, while cyclinB1, cyclinD1, CDK1, and CDK4 protein levels were decreased. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that FAC may play an important role in tumor growth suppression by inducing apoptosis in human hepatocarcinoma cells via mitochondria-dependent and death receptor-dependent apoptotic pathways.",M2

Antifibrotic activities of Astragalus membranaceus have been extensively proved. AIM OF THE STUDY: To investigate the effects of astragaloside IV on hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and hepatic fibrosis in rats induced by porcine-serum (PS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Liver fibrosis was induced by PS injection (0.5 ml, twice a week) for 12 weeks. Astragaloside IV (2.0, 4.0 mg kg(-1)) was administered intragastrically. Liver samples were subjected to histological and immunohistochemical studies. In vitro effects of astragaloside IV on primary cultured HSCs were detected by incorporation assays. RESULTS: Astragaloside IV delayed the formation of liver fibrosis and decrease the serum levels of hyaluronic acid (HA), procollagen type III (PCIII) and hydroxyproline (Hyp) content in liver. The levels of transforming growth factor-beta(1) (TGF-beta(1)) in serum and expression in liver were significantly decreased by astragaloside IV. Collagen synthesis and proliferation were significantly inhibited by astragaloside IV (1.5, 3.0, 6.0, 12.0 and 24.0 mg L(-1)) in HSCs. CONCLUSION: The results showed that astragaloside IV displays antifibrotic effects in rats induced by PS, the mechanism by which might be associated with its inhibitory effects on collagen synthesis and proliferation in HSCs.",M2
19427771,"Suppressive effects of swainsonine on C6 glioma cell in vitro and in vivo.Swainsonine, an extract from <e>Astragalus</e> membranaceus, is known for its anti-cancer effects and could prevent metastases. In order to investigate the effects and mechanisms of swainsonine in C6 glioma cells, we carry out correlated experiments in vitro and in vivo. After treatment with swainsonine, the effective dose and IC(50) value of swainsonine in the C6 glioma cell were examined using the MTT assay. Cell cycle distribution and apoptotic rates were analyzed using FCM and [Ca(2+)](i) was measured by LSCM. Expressions of p16 and p53 protein were evaluated by immunocytochemical methods. Simultaneously, glioma-bearing rats were administered swainsonine at doses of 2, 4 and 8 mg/kg body wt. The inhibition rate was calculated and pathological sections were observed. The results indicated that the growth of C6 glioma cells is inhibited by swainsonine in vitro, with an IC(50) value within 24h of 0.05 microg/ml. Increases in swainsonine correlate with S phase percentages of 11.3%, 11.6% and 12.4%, respectively. Moreover, the expression of apoptosis inhibiting p53 and p16 protein decreases gradually. Tumor weight in vivo decreased clearly and HE dyeing of tumor tissue showed gray, its texture was soft, with necrosis and hemorrhagic concentrated inward. Swainsonine could inhibit the proliferation of C6 glioma cells in vitro and the growth of C6 glioma in vivo. The mechanisms of swainsonine-induced apoptosis may relate with the expression of apoptosis-related genes and overloading-[Ca(2+)](i)-induced endoplasmic reticulum stress.",M2
19403285,"Antiproliferation and apoptosis of human tumor cell lines by a lectin (AMML) of <e>Astragalus</e> mongholicus.A lectin (AMML) from the roots of Astragalus mongholicus was extracted and purified by affinity chromatographic technique. Human cervical carcinoma cell line (HeLa), human osteoblast-like cell line (MG63) and human leukemia cell line (K562) were used to check the effects of AMML on cell proliferation, apoptosis and cell cycle. Maximum growth inhibition (92%) was observed with HeLa cells, followed by K562 cells (84%) and MG63 (48%) cells. Morphological observation showed that AMML-treated HeLa cells displayed outstanding apoptosis characteristics, such as nuclear fragmentation and appearance of membrane-enclosed apoptotic bodies. The apoptosis of HeLa cells was confirmed by flow cytometry using Annexin V/FITC and propidium iodide (PI) staining technique. For the first time we also report a significant cell cycle arrest at S phase of HeLa cells by AMML. Therefore, the present investigation may lead to the possible therapeutic use of Astragalus mongholicus lectin.",M2
19385185,"[Effect of <e>Astragalus</e> mongholicus on expression of transforming growth factor- beta1 in SD rats with unilateral ureteral occlusion]OBJECTIVE: To study the effect of Astragalus mongholicus (AM) on the expression of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) in SD rats with unilateral ureteral occlusion (UUO) and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying the renoprotective effects of AM. METHOD: Fifty-four Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: sham-operation group, the UUO group and AM treatment group. After administration of AM (10 g kg(-1) d(-1)) for 3, 7 and 14 days, the dynamic histological changes of renal interstitial tissues were observed and renal damage including tubular impairment and interstitial fibrosis were quantified on HE and Masson stained tissue sections. The expression of TGF-beta1 and alpha-smooth muscle actin (alpha-SMA) was measured by immunohistochemistry staining sections. The mRNA of TGF-beta1 and alpha-SMA were reverse transcribed and quantified by real-time PCR. The expression of TGF-beta1 protein were assessed by Western blot. RESULT: Renal damage was exacerbated and the expression of alpha-SMA and TGF-beta1 were all significantly increased in UUO group compared with those of sham-operation group (P&lt;0.05) at each time point. Tubular impairment and interstitial fibrosis were alleviated, and up-regulations of expressions of TGF-beta1 and alpha-SMA were significantly suppressed by AM treatment (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: AM can ameliorate renal interstitial fibrosis induced by UUO in vivo. The mechanisms of its antifibrotic effects might be related with the down-regulation of TGF-beta1 expression and suppression of tubular epithelial myofibroblast transdifferentiation in the progress of renal interstitial fibrosis.",M2
19384947,"A novel anticancer effect of <e>Astragalus</e> saponins: Transcriptional activation of NSAID-activated gene.Astragalus membranaceus has been used to ameliorate the side effects of antineoplastic drugs because of its immunomodulating nature. We had recently demonstrated that total Astragalus saponins (AST) possess anticarcinogenic and proapoptotic properties in human colon cancer cells and tumor xenograft. In this study, we identified NSAID-activated gene (NAG-1) as a potential molecular target of AST. The growth-inhibitory and proapoptotic effects of AST were assessed in a panel of human cancer cell lines. Hoechst 33342 nuclear staining, Annexin V-FITC/propidium iodide staining, Western immunoblotting, real-time PCR, luciferase reporter assay and electrophoretic mobility shift assay were conducted to determine the association of NAG-1 and related transcription factors with AST during its regulation of apoptotic activities. Moreover, the combined proapoptotic and NAG-1 promoting activities of AST and/or inhibitors of the PI3K-Akt pathway were also examined. AST caused overexpression of NAG-1, leading to PARP cleavage and apoptosis. The induction of NAG-1 promoter activity by the drug was associated with increased gene expression, in addition to prior increase in Egr-1 expression and DNA binding activity. AST-induced NAG-1 activation was intensified when PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or Akt inhibitor was co-treated and reversed by NAG-1 siRNA transfection. Nevertheless, the extent of NAG-1 induction could not be altered by the ERK inhibitor PD98059. Our results indicate that NAG-1 is a potential molecular target of AST in its antitumorigenic and proapoptotic actions, which would have additive effects when used along with PI3K-Akt inhibitors. The information obtained could facilitate future development of a novel target-specific chemotherapeutic agent with known molecular pathway.",M2

Inactivation of the bacA gene abolished the ability of M. huakuii 7653R to establish a successful symbiosis with its host plant. Simultaneously, compared with wild-type M. huakuii 7653R, the bacA mutant was more sensitive to cell envelope-disrupting agents (acidic solution, ethanol, SDS, and crystal violet). Mass spectrometry analysis revealed that the very-long-chain fatty acid (27-OHC-28:0 and 29-OHC-30:0) contents of lipid A was reduced in the M. huakuii 7653R bacA mutant. Taken together, our data suggest that the cell envelope was altered in the M. huakuii 7653R bacA mutant, which might deteriorate bacterial adaption to acute environmental changes encountered in host cells and ultimately result in the failure of Mesorhizobium-legume symbiosis.",M2
19309459,"Characterization of selenocysteine methyltransferases from <e>Astragalus</e> species with contrasting selenium accumulation capacity.A group of selenium (Se)-hyperaccumulating species belonging to the genus Astragalus are known for their capacity to accumulate up to 0.6% of their foliar dry weight as Se, with most of this Se being in the form of Se-methylselenocysteine (MeSeCys). Here, we report the isolation and molecular characterization of the gene that encodes a putative selenocysteine methyltransferase (SMT) enzyme from the non-accumulator Astragalus drummondii and biochemically compare it with an authentic SMT enzyme from the Se-hyperaccumulator Astragalus bisulcatus, a related species that lives within the same native habitat. The non-accumulator enzyme (AdSMT) shows a high degree of homology with the accumulator enzyme (AbSMT) but lacks the selenocysteine methyltransferase activity in vitro, explaining why little or no detectable levels of MeSeCys accumulation are observed in the non-accumulator plant. The insertion of mutations on the coding region of the non-accumulator AdSMT enzyme to better resemble enzymes that originate from Se accumulator species results in increased selenocysteine methyltransferase activity, but these mutations were not sufficient to fully gain the activity observed in the AbSMT accumulator enzyme. We demonstrate that SMT is localized predominantly within the chloroplast in Astragalus, the principal site of Se assimilation in plants. By using a site-directed mutagenesis approach, we show that an Ala to Thr amino acid mutation at the predicted active site of AbSMT results in a new enzymatic capacity to methylate homocysteine. The mutated AbSMT enzyme exhibited a sixfold higher capacity to methylate selenocysteine, thereby establishing the evolutionary relationship of SMT and homocysteine methyltransferase enzymes in plants.",M2

The results showed that the colonization and spore density of AM fungi differed significantly with sampling sites and soil depths. The highest colonization rate and spore density of AM fungi were found in 10-30 cm soil layer, and the highest spore density was at Dingbian site. Ningtiaoliang and Tawan sites had the highest vesicular colonization, and Tawan site had the highest total and hyphal colonization. The contents of total glomalin (TG) and easily extractable glomain (EEG) were the highest at Tawan site, being 1.18 mg x g(-1) and 0.65 mg x g(-1), respectively. Soil pH had significant positive effects on the vesicular and arbuscular colonization, spore density, TG, and EEG, and the TG and EEG had significant positive correlations with spore density, soil organic carbon (SOC), and soil available N and P. The proportion of glomalin to SOC was higher in desert soils than in agricultural soils, which implied that glomalin could be one of the main origins of SOC in desert ecosystem. Therefore, glomalin could be a useful index for the evaluation of soil AM fungal activity and soil ecology.",M2
19271241,"Host range evolution is not driven by the optimization of larval performance: the case of Lycaeides melissa (Lepidoptera: Lycaenidae) and the colonization of alfalfa.Herbivorous insects that have recently incorporated novel hosts into their diet provide unique opportunities for understanding factors that promote or constrain the evolution of niche breadth. Lycaeides melissa has colonized both cultivated and feral alfalfa (Medicago sativa) throughout much of North America within the past 200 years. We investigated the quality of the novel host as a resource for juvenile development, and asked if the novel host is a preferred host for oviposition relative to a native host (<e>Astragalus</e> canadensis). Larval-performance and oviposition-preference were examined using L. melissa individuals from a population associated with both M. sativa and A. canadensis, and oviposition-preference was also examined in another population associated exclusively with M. sativa. In addition, we investigated the effects of M. sativa and A. canadensis flowers on both preference and performance. Only one of the hosts, M. sativa, has flowers that are accessible to nectaring butterflies, and we hypothesized that the presence of flowers could affect female behavior. We find that the novel host is a relatively poor larval resource: adults that were reared as larvae on M. sativa were roughly one-third the size of adults that were reared on the native host, A. canadensis. The native host, Astragalus canadensis, is the preferred host in choice experiments involving only foliage. However, when flowers were included in preference assays, the native and novel hosts received similar numbers of eggs. Thus, the presence of flowers on hosts in the field might influence the utilization of a novel and inferior larval resource. These results are consistent with a model in which host shifts are driven by adult behavior that does not directly optimize larval performance.",M2

Astragalus sinicus L. grown in the soil in the presence of four levels of Cd was inoculated individually with Glomus mosseae, Glomus intraradices, or by a mixed inoculum of these two fungi. Histochemical vital stains were used to measure the efficiency and function of the mycorrhizal symbiosis after 7weeks. Nested PCR with ALP-active stained roots was applied to monitor the efficiency AMF in mixed community at the same time. The addition of Cd slightly decreased plant biomass and mycorrhizal colonization, and depressed the activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), especially in G. intraradices. Mycorrhizal colonization significantly improved plant growth regardless of the level of addition of Cd. The plants inoculated with G. mosseae or mixed inoculum immobilized more Cd in the roots, and partitioned less Cd to the shoots at the highest Cd addition level. Root colonization efficiency of G. intraradices was improved in the mixed community and G. mosseae was the dominant colonizer in this community. Based on the higher Cd tolerance of this strain of G. mosseae, it would be preferred for bioremediation in Cd contaminated soil.",M2

In order to determine nutrient requirements, the fungus was cultured on 9 carbon sources, 9 nitrogen sources, and 13 growth media in the dark at 25 degrees C. Growth rates and sporulation capacity were measured after 4 and 12 weeks. All carbon sources supported growth, but only soluble starch, inulin, and dextrose supported sporulation. In general, better growth was obtained on disaccharides and polysaccharides than on monosaccharides. Compared with no growth on NH(4) (+)-N and urea, the fungus grew little on all NO(3) (-)-N, amino-N, and other organic-N such as peptone. There was no sporulation or very sparse conidia on almost all nitrogen sources with supplied dextrose or soluble starch as sole carbon source. The better growth and sporulation on most of the semidefined media than on defined media indicates that some components in plant or animal material may be vital to the fungus. Sporulation was positively correlated with growth rate in N source experiment at 12 weeks and in growth media experiment at 4 and 12 weeks. The fungus favors grow within agar with growth rate less than 1.18 mm day(-1).",M2

It is still unknown if the combined application of probiotics and APS in feed has synergistic effects on immunity and intestinal microbiota. To address this issue, this study was designed to investigate the synergistic effects on immunity and intestinal microbiota in chicks. A total of 240 female Hy-Line chicks were assigned to 4 treatments. Four treatments were fed the same corn-soy meal control diet; however, treatments 2, 3, and 4 were supplemented (per kg of feed) with 220 mg of APS, 4 x 10(10) cfu probiotics, and dual treatment, respectively. Parameters evaluated included serum Newcastle disease antibody titer, peripheral blood acid alpha-naphthyl acetate esterase-positive (ANAE(+)) T-lymphocyte percentage, immune organ relative weights and histological changes, and selected intestinal tract bacteria. Compared with the control, Newcastle disease antibody titer, ANAE(+) T-lymphocyte percentage, immune organ relative weights, histological changes, as well as lactobacilli and Bacillus cereus numbers significantly increased (P &lt;or= 0.05); however, the Escherichia coli numbers in chicks of the treatments decreased (P &lt;or= 0.05).

METHODS: Thirty healthy adult Wistar rats were equally randomized into Group A (sham-operation control), B (torsion/detorsion) and C (torsion/detorsion plus intraperitoneal injection of astragalus). The testicular torsion/detorsion model was established by the Turner method. All the rats were fed under the same condition for 7 days and sacrificed, and the torsional testes were harvested for the detection of germ cell apoptosis, glutathione activity and the level of malonic diethylaldehyde (MDA). RESULTS: The apoptosis indexes (AI) of spermatogenic cells in the torsional testes were (5.82 +/- 1.21), (36.18 +/- 8.40) and (20.39 +/- 3.57) in Group A, B and C, significantly higher in Group B and C than in A (P &lt; 0.05) and in Group B than in C (P &lt; 0.05).

We recently reported that total Astragalus saponins (AST) possess anti-tumor properties in human colon cancer cells and tumor xenografts. Nevertheless, the precise mechanism of action has not been fully elucidated. The present study aimed to unveil the anti-carcinogenic potential of AST in HepG2 human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells and to clarify the signaling pathway. We demonstrated here that AST downregulated expression of the HCC tumor marker alpha-fetoprotein and suppressed HepG2 cell growth by inducing apoptosis. AST also caused caspase activation, poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) cleavage, nuclear chromatin condensation, with downregulation of the anti-apoptotic proteins bcl-2 and bcl-xL and decreased nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB)/DNA-binding activity. Concomitantly, expression of the phosphorylated form of the extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) was prominently increased. Nevertheless, pretreatment of ERK inhibitor PD98059 did not attenuate AST-induced PARP cleavage. Taken together, these results exemplify that AST induced growth inhibition and promoted apoptosis in HepG2 cells through modulation of an ERK-independent NF-kappaB signaling pathway.",M2

18924264,"<e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharides: an effective treatment for diabetes prevention in NOD mice.BACKGROUND: Type 1 diabetes mellitus (DM) is a chronic autoimmune disease that is related to the disequilibrium state of Th1 and Th2 subgroups of helper T lymphocyte (Th) and their cytokines. Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) are bioactive components extracted from one of the traditional Chinese herbs, used to enhance the function of human immune system. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effects of APS on preventing type 1 DM and Th1/Th2-subtype cytokines, we compared the results of administration of APS and normal saline (NS) on non-obese diabetic (NOD) mice. SUBJECTS AND METHODS: APS or NS was administered to 4-week-old mice at a dose of 2.0 g/kg per day for 10 weeks. At 40 weeks, blood glucose, serum C-peptide (C-P) and GAD antibody were measured; pancreas was examined histologically; the intra-islet lymphocyte infiltration and T lymphocyte subsets in the spleen were analysed; the gene expression of IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TGF-beta, Bcl-2, SOD, Fas and iNOS were measured by RT-PCR. RESULTS: The results showed that APS-administered NOD mice had a lower incidence rate of type 1 DM, lower serum C-P level, better histologic findings of pancreatic islets, and a lower D4+/CD8+ ratio of T lymphocytes from the spleen and the infiltrated islets. RT-PCR analysis showed gene expression levels are lower in IL-1 beta, IL-2, IL-6, IL-12, TNF-alpha, INF-gamma, Fas, iNOS, and higher in IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, TGF-beta, Bcl-2, SOD in the pancreatic tissue from APS-administered NOD mice as compared to the NS group.

METHOD: cardiac hypertrophy was induced by clipping the abdominal aorta in rats. Male SD rats were allocated to six groups: sham-operrated (Sham), aortic stenosis (Model), model +As-L (5 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)), model+As-M (10 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)), model+As-H (20 g x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and model + captopril (0.05 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1), a positive control). The drugs were administered orally from the 13 th week after surgery. Rats were examined after 12 week treatment with drugs. The cardiac hypertrophy was evaluated by left ventricular mass index (LVMI, left ventricular weight/ body weight). The calcium content in left ventricular tissue was measured by atomic absorption spectrometry. SERCA2a mRNA and protein expressions in left ventricular tissues were determined by half-quantitative RT-PCR and Western blot normalized to abundance of GAPDH mRNA and protein, respectively. RESULT: The increase of LVMI was dose-dependently lessened by As (P &lt; 0.01, P &lt; 0.001). The effect of As-H was similar to that of Captopril. As markedly attenuated calcium accumulation in myocardial tissure (P &lt; 0.01). RT-PCR and Western blot results demonstrated that SERCA2a gene expressions were downregulated (P &lt; 0.05) significantly in model group compared with sham group. As-H upregulated SERCA2a gene expressions (P &lt; 0.05), whereas Captopril had no effect on that. CONCLUSION: The inhibition of As on left ventricular hypertrophy induced by pressure overload in rats may partly contribute to its attenuation of calcium accumulation and up-regulation of SERCA2a gene expressions in left ventricular tissues.",M2

Control fish (negative control) and fish vaccinated only (positive control) were fed basal diets without supplements of herbs. The respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis, lysozyme activity and circulatory antibody titres in plasma were monitored. Following 5 weeks after feeding, fish were infected with A. hydrophila and mortalities were recorded. The results of this study showed that feeding non-vaccinated and vaccinated carp with combination of Astragalus and Ganoderma stimulated respiratory burst activity, phagocytosis of phagocytic cells in blood and lysozyme and circulatory antibody titres in plasma in vaccinated carp. Fish challenged with A. hydrophila had variable survival. The best survival (60%) was in vaccinated group fed with both herbs, while almost 90% of control fish (negative control) and 60% of fish vaccinated only (positive control) died.",M2

Their structures were established by the extensive use of 1D- and 2D-NMR experiments along with ESIMS and HRMS analysis. The occurrence of the hydroxyl function at position 23 (1-2) and of the ketalic function at C-24 (3) are very unusual findings in the cycloartane class.",M2
18800897,"Immune modulation of macrophage pro-inflammatory response by goldenseal and <e>Astragalus</e> extracts.Goldenseal (Hydrastis canadenisis) is a native American medicinal plant used as an immune stimulant. Astragalus (Astragalus membranaceus) is a widely used herbal product in China, other Asian countries, and the United States as an immune stimulant to be taken on first clinical signs of infection. In this study, the innate effects of goldenseal and Astragalus on pro-inflammatory cytokines produced by cultured macrophages were examined using two different commercial preparations of goldenseal and Astragalus. Both goldenseal and Astragalus were found to exhibit little to no direct effect on stimulation of mouse macrophages (J774A.1 cells), with only Astragalus able to affect production of tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha when used in high concentrations. However, both goldenseal and Astragalus were able to modify responses from lipopolysaccharide-stimulated macrophages, with identified immunomodulatory effects to reduce production of TNF-alpha, interleukin (IL)-6, IL-10, and IL-12 in a dose-dependent manner. The results obtained indicate that both goldenseal and Astragalus exhibit abilities to modulate macrophage responses during stimulation. Therefore, it is hypothesized that their historical use as therapeutic agents may be due to reduction in the pro-inflammatory response that indirectly leads to limiting of clinical symptoms during infection. Both products differ in their immune stimulatory patterns, offering insight into differential use and therapeutic potential of these products to regulate macrophage immune responses and activation events.",M2

18706249,"Protective effects of emodin and <e>astragalus</e> polysaccharides on chronic hepatic injury in rats.BACKGROUND: Chinese medicine plays an important role in hepatoprotective treatment. This study was conducted to investigate the protective effects of emodin and astragalus polysaccharides (APS) in a rat model of chronic hepatic injury. METHODS: Chronic hepatic injury was induced by hypodermic injection of an olive oil solution containing 40% carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) twice a week, in addition to a diet of 79.5% maizena, 20% fat, 0.5% cholesterol, and 10% alcohol in the drinking water ad libitum for 12 weeks. Meanwhile, the rats were exposed to different concentrations of emodin (40 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), APS (200 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)), combination drug (emodin 40 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1) combined with APS 200 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) and colchicine (0.1 mg x kg(-1) x d(-1)) in parallel by oral gavage (once a day for 12 weeks). At the end of 12 weeks, blood serum and liver tissue were taken. Serum was collected to determine the levels of total bilirubin (TBIL), alanine transaminase (ALT), aspartate transaminose (AST), and albumin (ALB). Liver and spleen indexes were assayed, followed by the measurements of the liver associated enzyme superoxide dismutase (SOD) and malondialdehyde (MDA). Histopathological changes were studied using optical microscopy. RESULTS: Splenohepatomegalia was alleviated and serum levels of TBIL and ALT were reduced in the groups treated with emodin and APS when compared to the control group. In addition, the ALB level in the APS and combination groups was higher. Similarly, the SOD activity of liver homogenates was significantly higher in the groups treated with emodin and APS, while administration of the herbal derivatives prevented the elevation in MDA levels. Histological analysis showed that the APS and combination groups significantly ameliorated the hepatic injury. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of emodin and APS demonstrated a synergistic action in reducing ALT and restoring ALB in the serum from a rat model of chronic hepatic injury. Emodin and APS may ameliorate the CCl(4)-induced hepatic injury in rats by elevating antioxidant-enzyme activities and reducing lipid peroxidation.",M2
18686097,"Immunoregulatory and anti-tumor effects of polysaccharopeptide and <e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharides on tumor-bearing mice.The aim of this study was to determine whether polysaccharopeptide (PSP) and Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) can be combined together as a new complex prescription (PSP + APS) for aiding adriamycin (AMD) chemotherapy. Ehrlich's ascites carcinoma (EAC) was used to establish a solid tumor model in Kunming mice. Immunocytochemical and immunohistochemical analysis were employed to detect the immunoregulatory and anti-tumor effects of EAC bearing mice after 30 days of administration with PSP and APS. PSP and PSP + APS could significantly increase the percentage of CD3(+) and CD4(+) T-lymphocytes, the ratio of CD4(+)/CD8(+), and the expression of IL-2/IL-2R in spleen and Bax in tumor tissue, but led to a diminution of Bcl-2 and CDK4 in tumor tissue compared with those of control group. In addition, PSP +APS could restore the immunological effects against AMD-induced immunosuppression, such as the subset of leukomonocyte, the expression of IL-2/IL-2R in the spleen, and the thymus index. These findings suggest that the immunomodulatory and anti-cancer effects of this new formula (PSP+APS) were better than those of PSP alone, and also could resist immunosuppression induced by AMD.",M2

18655554,"[Effect of <e>Astragalus</e> on cytokines in patients undergoing heart valve replacement]OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effect of astragalus (As) on cytokines in patients undergoing heart valve replacement (HVR). METHODS: Thirty patients undergoing HVR were randomized into the As group and the control group. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) was set up routinely and to the As group, As injection (40 mL, 10 mL containing 2 g of crude drug) was added into the prime solution just before CPB. Blood samples were collected at different time points during and after CPB for cytokines determination, including tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin-6 (IL-6), IL-8 and IL-10 by ELISA. RESULTS: All the indexes measured were insignificantly different between groups before skin incision, they began to increase by the end of CPB (P &lt; 0.05), reached the peak 3 h after CPB and then decreased gradually, TNF-alpha returned to the baseline level 24 h after operation. Meanwhile, levels of IL-6, IL-8 and IL-10 decreased obviously but still above the baseline. Comparisons between groups at different time points showed that levels of IL-6 were not different significantly (P &gt; 0.05), those of IL-10 were higher at all time points, and TNF-alpha and IL-8 at 3 h, 6 h and 12 h after CPB were significantly lower in the As group (all P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Astragalus may decrease the inflammation cytokine promoting factors, and increase the level of anti-inflammatory cytokine (IL-10), so it could attenuate the inflammation reaction in patients after HVR.",M2

METHOD: Morphology, habits, isozyme and soluble protein electrophoretograms were compared among the populations. They were categorized by cluster analysis based on those electrophoretograms. Different ability of resistance to powdery mildew was also studied through comparing disease indices among six populations. RESULT: The results showed A. membranaceus var. mongholicus was distinctly different from A. membranaceus. There was a special type in colonies of A. membranaceus, which showed hairy upper epidermis of leaflets and later florescence. CONCLUSION: Astragalus for medicine could be categorized in three types A. membranaceus var. mongholicus, A. membranaceus early florescence type and A. membranaceus late florescence type. Among them A. membranaceus var. mongholicus is most resistant to powdery mildew, while A. membranaceus is easily infected, and the early florescence type is even more easily infected.",M2
18643938,"A nodule-specific plant cysteine proteinase, AsNODF32, is involved in nodule senescence and nitrogen fixation activity of the green manure legume <e>Astragalus</e> sinicus.Asnodf32, encoding a nodule-specific cysteine proteinase in Astragalus sinicus, is probably involved in nodule senescence. To obtain direct evidence of its role in nodule senescence, Agrobacterium rhizogenes-mediated RNA interference was applied to A. sinicus hairy roots. Real-time qRT-PCR was used to estimate the efficiency of suppression. The senescent phenotype of transgenic nodules was examined with paraffin-embedded slides, TUNEL (TdT-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) assay, and transmission electron microscopy, and the bacteroid nitrogen fixation activity was also measured. It was found that silencing of Asnodf32 delayed root nodule and bacteroid senescence. The period of bacteroid active nitrogen fixation was significantly extended. Interestingly, nodules enlarged in length were also observed on Asnodf32-silenced hairy roots. The results reported here indicate that Asnodf32 plays an important role in the regulation of root nodule senescence.",M2

In previous studies, we developed a bioremediation system based on the symbiosis between Astragalus sinicus and the recombinant rhizobium, Mesorhizobium huakuii subsp. rengei B3 developed by overexpressing a synthetic tetrameric metallothionein gene (MTL4) and cDNA encoding the phytochelatin synthase from Arabidopsis thaliana (AtPCS). To promote the transport of metals into the nodules of the rhizobium and the accumulation of metals, the iron-regulated transporter 1 gene from A. thaliana (AtIRT1) was introduced into recombinant strain B3 containing MTL4 or AtPCS in its chromosome. The fused AtIRT1-alkaline phosphatase was expressed in the free-living recombinant rhizobium and the nodule of A. sinicus. The recombinant strain B3 carrying AtIRT1 showed a higher Cd sensitivity and a higher amount of Cd accumulated in free-living culture than the wild-type strain B3. When the recombinant strain B3 established symbiosis with A. sinicus, the introduction of AtIRT1 in the recombinant strain B3 advantaged the accumulation of Cu and As in the nodules of A. sinicus, compared with that of Cd and Zn.",M2

This ORF was inserted between CaMV35S promoter, a Omega fragment of TMV RNA 5'UTR and NOS polyA terminator in the T-DNA region of a binary expression vector pNT (Fig1). The recombinant plasmid, designated as pNT-AtNHX1, was then transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens LBA4404. Mediated by this engineering Agrobacterium, the AtNHX1 gene was transferred into T0 generation transgenic plant strains of A. melilotoides and 103 regenerated plants resistant to Kanamycin (Kan) were obtained. Some factors influencing the transformation efficiency, such as the concentration and infection duration of Agrobacterium, the concentration of Acetosyringone (AS), were optimized to establish a stable Agrobacterium mediated gene transformation protocol of A. melilotoides. PCR analysis, Southern blot and RT-PCR detection of some T0 transgenic plants showed that the AtNHX1 gene was evidently integrated into the genome of transgenic plants and couldl be transcripted properly. Under the same salt stress conditions, the detection of NaCl resistance revealed the difference between the wild-type calli and the transgenic calli that induced from the transgenic plants, i.e, the relative growth rates of the transgenic calli were remarkably higher than that of the wild-type calli. The K+ and Na+ contents and relative conductivity in the leaves of the transgenic plants and wild-type plants were estimated. It suggested that under the stress of different concentration of NaCl, K+/Na+ ratio in the transgenic plant cells were always higher than that in wild-type, however the situation of relative conductivity was on the opposite. From the facts above mentioned, the transformation of AtNHX1 gene not only enhanced the salt tolerance of transgenic A. melilotoides, but also reduced the cell membrane damage induced by salinity.",M2
18629712,"Phytochemical analysis and in vitro cytotoxic activity of volatiles from <e>Astragalus</e> corniculatus.The volatile fractions from Astragalus corniculatus Bieb., cultivated and collected wild, were analyzed at three different phenological phases for the first time. GC/MS analysis showed that the volatile fractions contain hydrocarbons, butyl ethers, acids, alcohols, esters, aldehydes, ketones, terpenes. These fractions were tested for cytotoxic activity in a panel of human tumor cell lines after 48 h, using the MTT-dye reduction assay. Throughout the cytotoxicity evaluation the fraction derived from the flowering phase of wild type plant was found to exert the most prominent cytotoxic activity, which could be ascribed to the high content of hydrocarbons and squalene in particular. Furthermore, the mechanistic elucidation of the mode of action of this volatile fraction in SKW-3 cells revealed that the observed activity is mediated by induction of necrotic type cell death as evidenced by the smear patterns of DNA following a 24 h exposure period.",M2
18622730,"Dietary supplementation with <e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharide enhances ileal digestibilities and serum concentrations of amino acids in early weaned piglets.Two experiments were conducted to evaluate the effects of dietary supplementation with Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) on growth performance, apparent ileal digestibilities (AID) of amino acids (AA), and their serum concentrations in early weaned piglets. In Exp. 1, 60 pigs were weaned at 21 days of age (BW 7.35 +/- 0.23 kg) and allocated to three treatments (20 pigs/treatment), representing supplementing 0.0% (control), 0.02% colistin (antibiotic), or 0.1% APS to a corn- and soybean meal-based diet. Average daily gain (ADG), average daily feed intake (ADFI), and feed/gain ratio (F/G) were measured weekly. Blood samples were obtained from five pigs selected randomly from each treatment for the measurement of serum free AA concentrations on days 7, 14, and 28. In Exp. 2, 12 pigs were weaned at 21 day of age (BW 7.64 +/- 0.71 kg), assigned to three treatment groups as in Exp. 1, and surgically fitted with a simple T-cannula at the terminal ileum. Ileal digesta samples were obtained for the measurement of AID of AA on days 7, 14 and 28. Dietary APS did not affect ADFI, but enhanced (P &lt; 0.05) ADG by 11 and 4.4%, and improved F/G by 5.6 and 8.4%, respectively, compared with the control and antibiotic groups. Addition of APS to the diet increased AID and serum concentrations of most nutritionally essential and non-essential AA (including arginine, proline, glutamate, lysine, methionine, tryptophan, and threonine) on days 14 and 28. Circulating levels of total AA were affected by the age of pigs and treatment x time interaction. Collectively, these findings indicate that APS may ameliorate the digestive and absorptive function and regulate AA metabolism to beneficially increase the entry of dietary AA into the systemic circulation, which provide a mechanism to explain the growth-promoting effect of APS in early weaned piglets.",M2

METHOD: The mice with diabetic nephropathy were fed A. mongholicus and normal saline respectively. cDNA microarray was used to measure gene expression profile in renal tissue after 12 weeks, and the data were analyzed by bioinformatics. RT-PCR was performed to detect the relative levels of some genes which were randomly selected. RESULT: Eighty eight genes were found differently expressed in two chips. Among these genes, 81 genes were found differently expressed in reverse direction change, 7 genes were found differently expressed in same direction change. The genes altered were mainly related to material metabolism, immunity and inflammatory reaction, signal transduction, translation, transcription, et al. The expressions of genes tested by RT-PCR were in accordance with those detected by cDNA microarray.

18583351,"Phenylalanine ammonia lyase functions as a switch directly controlling the accumulation of calycosin and calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside in <e>Astragalus</e> membranaceus var. mongholicus plants.Previously it had been shown that calycosin and calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside (CGs) accumulate in whole plants, mainly in leaves, of Astragalus membranaceus Bge. var. mongholicus (Bge.) Hsiao (A. mongholicus) plants in response to low temperature. In this work, it was demonstrated that the influences of different conditions on CGs biosynthesis, by examining the changes in CGs content, as well as the expression of related genes, including phenylalanine ammonia lyase (PAL1), cinnamic acid 4-hydroxylase (C4H), chalcone synthase (CHS), chalcone reductase (CHR), chalcone isomerase (CHI), isoflavone synthase (IFS), and isoflavone 3'-hydroxylase (I3'H). The seven gene mRNAs accumulated in leaves of A. mongholicus upon exposure to low temperature in a light-dependent manner, though they exhibited different expression patterns. Transcriptions of CHS, CHR, CHI, IFS, and I3'H of the calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside pathway were all up-regulated when plants were transferred from 16 degrees C to 2 degrees C or 25 degrees C or from 2 degrees C (kept for 24 h) to 25 degrees C. However, fluctuations in temperature influenced differently the transcriptions of PAL1 and C4H of the general phenylpropanoid pathway in leaves. Moreover, the amount of PAL1 expression changed sharply up and down, consistent with the variation of the content of CGs. PAL enzyme activity appears to be the limiting factor in determining the CGs levels. The inhibitor of PAL enzyme, L-alpha-aminooxy-beta-phenylpropionic acid, almost entirely shut down CGs accumulation at low temperature. All these results confirmed that PAL1, as a smart gene switch, directly controls the accumulation of CGs in A. mongholicus plants, in a light-dependent manner, during low temperature treatment.",M2

METHODS: Twenty-eight Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly assigned to three groups. The rat model of IgA nephropathy was induced by intragastric administration of bovine serum albumin and injections of LPS and CC14. Six weeks later, the rats with IgAN were randomly treated with oral astragalus (3 g/kg/d, for 6 weeks) or normal saline. Normal control rats which were not subjected to IgAN were treated with normal saline. The number of urinary erythrocytes and urinary protein and B-D-N-Acetyl glucosaminidase (NAG) contents were determined by Pan-automatic biochemistry analyzing meter. Expression of monocyte chemotactic protein-1 (MCP-1) and nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-kappaB) in tubulointerstitial tissues were analyzed by immunohistochemistry. A semiquantitative score was used to evaluate the degree of renal pathologic lesions. RESULTS: The number of urinary erythrocytes (74.02+/-16.58 / microL vs 383.23+/-4.94 /microL) and urinary protein (13.88+/-4.94 vs 59.82+/-14.73 mg/L) and NAG contents (2.84+/-0.31 vs 5.24+/-0.80 U/L) in the astragalus-treated IgAN rats decreased remarkably compared with those in the IgAN rats without astragalus treatment (P&lt;0.01). Expression of the NF-kappaB and MCP-1 in the renal tissues in the IgAN rats without astragalus treatment was significantly higher than that in the astragalus-treated IgAN rats and normal control rats (P&lt;0.01). There were significant differences in the scores of renal pathologic lesions between the IgAN rats with or without astragalus treatment (6.03+/-0.46 vs 10.57+/-1.23; P&lt;0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Astragalus can decrease the number of urinary erythrocytes and urinary protein and NAG contents, and relieves tubulointerstitial lesions, possibly through the down-regulation of NF-kappaB and MCP-1 expression in rats with IgAN.",M2

Brown on angiotensin II-induced portal-vein contraction in hypertensive rats.The objective of the present study was to examine further the underlying mechanism of the antihypertensive effect of the total flavonoid (TF), extracted from the seed of Astragalus complanatus R.Brown. Renovascular hypertension rats (RHR) were established by the two-kidney one clip (2K1C) method. The effect of TF on the contraction of portal vein was studied in an isolated preparation. The response of portal vein to angiotensin II (Ang II) was expressed as a percentage of the 100 mmol/l KCl induced maximum contraction. We took the dose-response curve of portal vein to Ang II (from 10(-9) to 10(-6) mmol/l) as the control and then observed the change of curve after TF and Valsartan (Ang II receptor blocker) administration. Ang II induced a concentration-dependent increase of the contraction amplitude (maximal increase, 46.53+/-5.15% of 100 mmol/l KCl induced contraction at Ang II 10(-6) mmol/l in RHR). The Ang II-induced portal vein contraction was prevented by TF with a concentration related manner (maximal inhibition amplitude from 46.53+/-5.15% to 22.525+/-4.67% of 100 mmol/l KCl contraction at 10(-6)mmol/l Ang II and 3.12 x 10(-1) mg/l TF in RHR). The effect of TF on Ang II-induced portal vein contraction was similar to Valsartan. These results showed that the antihypertensive action of TF was attributed to the dilation of vessels and is related to the blockade of the Ang II receptor.",M2

18298915,"Two isomers of HDTIC isolated from Astragali Radix decrease the expression of p16 in 2BS cells.BACKGROUND: Astragali Radix, the root of <e>Astragalus</e> membranceus (Fish) Bunge Var. mongholicus (Bge), is a crude drug considered as one of the effective traditional Chinese anti-ageing material. The two isomers of 4-hydroxy-5-hydroxymethyl-[1, 3] dioxolan-2, 6'-spirane-5', 6', 7', 8'-tetrahydro-indolizine-3'-carbaldehyde (HDTIC), HDTIC-1 and HDTIC-2, were first extracted from the herb in 2002. We demonstrated previously that 0.1 micromol/L HDTIC-1 or 1.0 micromol/L HDTIC-2 strongly delay replicative senescence of human fetal lung diploid fibroblasts (2BS). In this study, we chose them to investigate their effects on the expression of senescence-associated genes to explore the mechanism of how HDTIC delays replicative senescence. METHODS: The effects of HDTIC-1 and HDTIC-2 on the expression of p16 and p21 were observed in vitro by RT-PCR and Western blot. The anti-oxidative activities of the compounds were also observed by phenotype alteration after treatment with antioxidants. RESULTS: There was an obvious expression of p16 in the control senescent cells. However, in the 2BS cells, after 56 population doublings (PDs) grown from PD28 in 0.1 micromol/L HDTIC-1 or 1.0 micromol/L HDTIC-2, there was a weak mRNA expression of p16 and no protein expression of p16 was observed. The expression level of p21 increased with cell ageing. Moreover, there was no difference between the expression level of p21 in the control cells and that in the same PD cells cultured with HDTIC compounds. The results also showed that 2BS cells exposed to 100 micromol/L H2O2 for 5 minutes return to their non-senescent phenotype and continue to be confluent after incubating the damaged cells with HDTIC-1 (1.0 micromol/L ) or HDTIC-2 (10 micromol/L ) for 1 hour. CONCLUSIONS: Expression of p16 by 2BS cells was strongly inhibited by HDTIC compounds, which could contribute to their delayed replicative senescence by the way of p16(INK4a)/Rb/MAPK. The anti-oxidative activities of HDTIC-1 and HDTIC-2, described in this study for the first time, might be indirectly related to their inhibition of p16 expression.",M2

18226482,"<e>Astragalus</e> Membranaceus prevents airway hyperreactivity in mice related to Th2 response inhibition.AIM OF THE STUDY: Asthma is recognized as a common pulmonary disease throughout the world. To date, there has been a growing interest in herbal products in Traditional Chinese Medicine, which is considered to be effective to treat asthma. A Chinese herb Astragalus Membranaceus (AM) was found useful in treating allergic diseases. The purpose of this study is to determine whether this herbal injection could suppress allergic-induced AHR and mucus hypersecretion in allergic mice. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A mouse model of chronic asthma was used to investigate AM injection on the airway lesions in compared with glucocorticoids. The study was conducted on mice sensitized and challenged with ovalbumin and the whole body plethsmography was performed to assess AHR. The bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL), histopathology were examined. RESULTS: We found 28-day AM administration significantly decreased inflammatory infiltration and mucus secretion in the lung tissues of allergic mice. 28-day AM administration enhanced Ova-induced decreased IFN-gamma, and the Ova-induced elevations of IL-5 and IL-13 in BALF were prevented by 28-day injection. We also showed 28-day AM injection markedly suppressed increased AHR in allergic mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate Astragalus Membranaceus has a potential role in treating allergic asthma.",M2
18222669,"Immunorestoration and augmentation of mitogen lymphocyte response in Graffi tumor bearing hamsters by purified saponin mixture from <e>Astragalus</e> corniculatus.Investigations on the effect of purified saponin mixture (PSM) obtained from the aerial parts of Astragalus corniculatus Bieb. (Fabaceae) on mitogen response of the spleen cells in Graffi tumor bearing (GTBH) and healthy hamsters were reported. The saponin mixture in a doses of 50mg/kg b.w. was injected i.p. 4 times starting simultaneously with implantation of tumor cells. Stimulation indices to phytohemagglutinine (PHA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) of lymphocytes in spleens of tumor bearing hamsters (TBH) were significantly decreased during the whole period of the observation. It was established that PSM stimulated the functions of spleen cells in Graffi-TBH, resulting in increased mitogen response to PHA and LPS. The stimulation was better expressed in healthy PSM-treated hamsters. The proliferation response of spleen lymphocytes to PSM was also found. PSM did not change the in vitro proliferation ability of Graffi tumor cells. The results obtained proved the immunostimulating and immunorestorating activity of PSM on the T- and B-spleen cells in healthy and GTBH hamsters, as well as the proliferative response of it to PSM.",M2
18196526,"Determination of nine active components in Radix Hedysari and Radix Astragali using capillary HPLC with diode array detection and MS detection.A capillary HPLC (cHPLC) coupled with diode array detection (DAD) and MS method was developed for the simultaneously qualitative and quantitative determination of nine components, namely vanillic acid, calycosin-7-O-beta-D-glucoside, (6alphaR,11alphaR)-9,10-dimethoxypterocarpan-3-O-beta-D-glucoside, ononin, calycosin, (3R)-2'-hydroxy-3',4'-dimethoxyisoflavan-7-O-beta-D-glucoside, isoliquiritigenin, formononetin, (3R)-8,2'-dihydroxy-7,4'-dimethoxyisoflavan, in Radix Hedysari (Hongqi) and Radix Astragali (Huangqi). Simultaneous separation of these nine compounds was achieved on a Zorbax C18 microcolumn (5 microm, 150 x 0.3 mm). The mobile phase consisted of (A) 0.3% aqueous formic acid and (B) ACN with a gradient elution. The identification of nine compounds in both Hongqi and Huangqi was confirmed by TOF-MS. All calibration curves showed good linearity (R(2) &gt;0.998) within test ranges. This method showed good repeatability for the quantification of these nine components in Hongqi and Huangqi with intra- and inter-day variations of less than 1.89 and 3.13%, respectively. The validated method was successfully applied to quantify nine investigated components in eighteen samples of Hongqi and Huangqi.

18161920,"Inhibitory effect of schisandrin B on gastric cancer cells in vitro.AIM: To investigate the inhibitory effect and possible mechanism of action of schisandrin B in SC-B on gastric cancer cells in vitro. METHODS: SC-B consisted of schisandrin B, aloe-emodin, and <e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharides. Exponentially growing human gastric cancer SGC-7901 cells were divided into six treatment groups: (1) control group (RPMI 1640 medium); (2) negative control group (2% DMSO); (3) positive control group (50 mg/L 5-Fluorouracil, 5-FU); (4) low-dose group (LSC, final concentration of schisandrin B, 25 mg/L); (5) moderate-dose group (MSC, final concentration of schisandrin B, 50 mg/L); (6) high-dose group (HSC, final concentration of schisandrin B, 100 mg/L). Follow-up was done at 12-48 h. An MTT (Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide) assay was used to examine the inhibitory effect of SC-B on gastric cancer cells. The mitosis index was assessed using an inverted microscope. Flow cytometry was used to visualize the cell cycle. An RT-PCR (Reverse transcription-Polymerase chain reaction) -based assay was used to detect mRNA expression for cyclin D1 and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH). RESULTS: The MTT assay showed that the number of living cells in the LSC, MSC and HSC groups was significantly smaller than that in the DMSO-treated group (P &lt; 0.05) at 12-48 h. The inhibitory rate (IR) of the LSC group was 41.15% +/- 3.86%, 59.24% +/- 5.34% and 69.93% +/- 7.81% at 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The IR of the MSC group was 42.82% +/- 4.94%, 62.68% +/- 7.58% and 71.79% +/- 8.12% at 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. The IR of the HSC group was 37.50% +/- 3.21%, 40.34% +/- 2.98% and 61.99% +/- 4.88% at 12, 24 and 48 h, respectively. These results suggested that a moderate dosage had the most obvious inhibitory efficacy at 48 h. Compared to the DMSO group, the mitosis index of the LSC, MSC, HSC groups was greatly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) at all time points. Any dose of SC-B suppressed mitosis within 12-48 h. Compared to the DMSO group, the percentage of cells in the G0/G1 phase of the MSC group was greatly increased, and that of the S + G2M phase was greatly decreased, while the percentage of cell inhibition (PCI) in the MSC group was greatly increased (P &lt; 0.05). This suggested that SC-B could exclusively arrest cells in the G0/G1 phase. Cyclin D1 mRNA expression was lower in the MSC group than that in the DMSO group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: SC-B can inhibit the proliferation and aberrant mitosis of human gastric cancer SCG-7901 cells in vitro. This inhibitory effect may be due to the down-regulation of cyclin D1 mRNA expression, which causes cell cycle arrest of gastric cancer cells.",M2

18060459,"Relationship between the endophyte Embellisia spp. and the toxic alkaloid swainsonine in major locoweed species (<e>Astragalus</e> and Oxytropis).Locoweeds (Astragalus and Oxytropis spp. that contain the toxic alkaloid swainsonine) cause widespread poisoning of livestock on western rangelands. There are 354 species of Astragalus and 22 species of Oxytropis in the US and Canada. Recently, a fungal endophyte, Embellisia spp., was isolated from Astragalus and Oxytropis spp. and shown to produce swainsonine. We conducted a survey of the major locoweeds from areas where locoweed poisoning has occurred to verify the presence of the endophyte and to relate endophyte infection with swainsonine concentrations. Species found to contain the fungal endophyte and produce substantial amounts of swainsonine were A. wootoni, A. pubentissimus, A. mollissimus, A. lentiginosus, and O. sericea. Astragalus species generally had higher concentrations of swainsonine than Oxytropis. Swainsonine was not detected in A. alpinus, A. cibarius, A. coltonii, A. filipes, or O. campestris. The endophyte could not be cultured from A. mollissimus var. thompsonii or A. amphioxys, but was detected by polymerase chain reaction, and only 30% of these samples contained trace levels of swainsonine. Further research is necessary to determine if the endophyte is able to colonize these and other species of Astragalus and Oxytropis and determine environmental influences on its growth and synthesis of swainsonine.",M2

18031609,"<e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharide reduces hepatic endoplasmic reticulum stress and restores glucose homeostasis in a diabetic KKAy mouse model.AIM: To examine the potential effects of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS) on hepatic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress in vivo and in vitro and its link with hypoglycemia activity, thus establishing the mechanism underlying the hypoglycemic action of APS. METHODS: The obese and type 2 diabetic KKAy mouse model, which is the yellow offspring of the KK mice expressed Ay gene (700 mg/kg-1/d-1, 8 weeks) and a high glucose-induced HepG2 cell model (200 microg/mL, 24 h) were treated with APS. The oral glucose tolerance test was measured to reflex insulin sensitivity with the calculated homeostasis model assessment (HOMA-IR) index. XBP1 (XhoI site-binding protein 1) transcription and splicing, an indicator of ER stress, was analyzed by RT-PCR and real-time PCR. The expression and activation of glycogen synthase kinase 3 beta (GSK3beta), an insulin signaling protein, was measured by Western blotting. RESULTS: APS can alleviate ER stress in cultured cells in vivo. The hyperglycemia status, systemic insulin sensitivity, fatty liver disease, and insulin action in the liver of diabetic mice were partly normalized or improved in response to APS administration. CONCLUSION: Our results indicate that APS enables insulin-sensitizing and hypoglycemic activity at least in part by enhancing the adaptive capacity of the ER, which can further promote insulin signal transduction. Thus, APS has promising application in the treatment of type 2 diabetes.",M2
18029798,"Immunopotentiating effects of four Chinese herbal polysaccharides administered at vaccination in chickens.This study was conducted to evaluate the effects of 4 Chinese herbal polysaccharides on the production of serum antibodies and the proliferation of peripheral T lymphocytes, including subpopulations in vaccinated chickens. A total of 450 chickens were randomly assigned to 9 groups at 14 d of age and vaccinated first with live Newcastle disease (ND)-infectious bronchitis virus vaccine, and second with ND-infectious bronchitis oil adjuvant vaccine at 28 d of age. At the same time as the first vaccination, the chickens in groups 1 to 8 were intramuscularly injected with 4 polysaccharides at high and low dosages, respectively, once a day for 3 successive days starting on the day of the first vaccination. Group 9 (control group) was injected in the same manner with saline instead of a polysaccharide. On d 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, 42, and 49 after the first vaccination, the temporal changes in serum ND hemagglutination inhibition antibody titer were determined by the micromethod. On d 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 after the first vaccination, the proliferation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells in response to concanavalin A stimulation as well as the proportions of CD3(+), CD4(+), and CD8(+) peripheral blood mononuclear cells were determined by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide method and flow cytometry, respectively. The results showed that <e>astragalus</e> polysaccharide and isatis root polysaccharide at low dosages, and achyranthes root polysaccharide and Chinese yam polysaccharide at high dosages significantly enhanced the ND antibody titers, concanavalin A-induced proliferation of peripheral blood lymphocytes, and ratio of CD4(+) to CD8(+) (P &lt;0.05).

18024144,"Characterization of a pathogenesis-related class 10 protein (PR-10) from <e>Astragalus</e> mongholicus with ribonuclease activity.A pathogenesis-related (PR) class 10 protein (designated AmPR-10) was first isolated from the Chinese medicinal material Astragalus mongholicus using a combination of affinity chromatography on Zn-chelate Agarose 4B, ion exchange chromatography on QAE Sephadex A-25 and gel filtration on Sephadex G50. The purified AmPR-10 showed a single band with a molecular mass of 17.2kDa in SDS-PAGE. The molecular mass of intact AmPR-10 was determined to be 32.8kDa by gel filtration. Thus, AmPR-10 is a dimeric protein composed of two identical subunits. AmPR-10 was a glycoprotein detected by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining and its neutral carbohydrate content was 13.7%. The carbohydrate was mainly composed of 73.0% (w/w) arabinose, 15.0% (w/w) glucose and 4.8% (w/w) fructose on the basis of high-performance anion exchange chromatography (HPAEC) analysis. Its N-terminal sequence of 15 amino acid residues was determined as GVISFNEETISTVAP, and showed significant sequence homology to some pathogenesis-related (PR) class 10 proteins. This sequence had 80% identity with the PR-10 protein LlPR10.1C from Lupinus luteus (yellow lupine) followed by 73.3% identity with the PR-10 protein PR10.2 from Medicago sativa (alfalfa), suggesting it is a new member of PR-10 proteins. AmPR-10 exhibited ribonuclease (RNase) activity as do some other PR-10 proteins. The optimal pH and temperature for RNase activity were pH 6.0 and 60 degrees C, respectively. The RNase activity was stable within pH 5.0-11.0. It was stable up to 60 degrees C at pH 6.0. The purification and characterization of AmPR-10 in this investigation furnish additional data to the relatively scanty literature pertaining to Astragali radix proteins.",M2
17900838,"Merit of <e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharide in the improvement of early diabetic nephropathy with an effect on mRNA expressions of NF-kappaB and IkappaB in renal cortex of streptozotoxin-induced diabetic rats.AIM OF STUDY: Diabetic nephropathy (DN) is the leading cause of the end-stage failure of kidney, but the efficacy of currently available strategies for the prevention of DN remains poor. An activation of the transcription factor, nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB), has been suggested to be a key step in the pathogenesis of DN. In the present study, we investigated the effect of Astragalus polysaccharide (APS), an aqueous extract from the Astragalus membranaceus roots, on gene expressions of NF-kappaB and an inhibitory protein of nuclear factor-kappaB (IkappaB) in experimental DN induced by streptozotocin in male Sprague-Dawley rats. MATERIALS AND METHOD: Rats with DN were treated with APS (1g/kg p.o.) or benazepril (1.5mg/kg p.o.), an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, using as positive control. The biochemical parameters such as blood glucose, plasma lipid and microalbuminuria were measured. Also, the mRNA level of NF-kappaB or IkappaB in renal cortex was determined using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: Eight weeks after the treatment, symptoms including shineless, bristly hair, polyuria, polydipsia, lethargy, physical inactivity, loss of body weight, kyphosis and decubitus position were ameliorated by APS. The levels of blood glucose, plasma lipid and microalbuminuria were lowered in APS-treated rats compared with control rats. The ratio of kidney weight over body weight was reduced and the renal function was improved after APS treatment. The mRNA level of NF-kappaB in renal cortex was decreased and IkappaB mRNA expression was raised by APS. These results suggest that APS has prophylactic and therapeutic effects on the progress of DN; CONCLUSIONS: therefore, APS is helpful for the prevention and/or treatment of DN at early stage.",M2

The results showed that some of the strains could use phenol as sole carbon source. In order to study the characteristics of phenol degradation, the strain CCNWTB701 isolated from Astragalus chrysopteru was used as well, due to the fact that it was very efficient in phenol degradation. The phenol degradation was around 99.5 and 78.3%, with an initial concentration of 900 and 1000 mg/l phenol in 62 and 66 h, respectively. Kinetic studies indicated that the strain had a high KS (743.1 microM) and an extremely high KSI (10,469 microM) in Haldane's model.

The DAD wavelength was set at 280 nm for the UV detection of flavonoids, while the drift tube temperature was set at 105 degrees C and the nebulizing gas flow rate at 2.7 L/min for ELSD detection of saponins. The method was fully validated with respect to linearity (r2 &gt;0.998), sensitivity, precision, and accuracy (recovery rate between 93.3 and 104.2%). The analytical results of different parts of the medicinal plant Huang-qi revealed that the levels of total flavonoids or saponins in individual parts can vary considerably and the concentration of each compound in different parts is also significantly different. The aerial parts (stems and leaves) contain even higher total contents of flavonoids (although of different kinds) than the commonly used roots of the plants. In addition, the concentration of total flavonoids and saponins in the extract of the fibrous roots was surprisingly highest among all parts of <e>Astragalus</e> species. All of these findings provide clear evidence and scientific support for utilization of different parts of the medicinal plant Huang-qi and also for reduction in waste of plant resources.",M2
17574357,"Effects and mechanisms of extract from Paeonia lactiflora and <e>Astragalus</e> membranaceus on liver fibrosis induced by carbon tetrachloride in rats.Paeonia lactiflora and Astragalus membranaceus are two popular traditional Chinese medicines, commonly used in Chinese herb prescription to treat liver disease. The extract prepared from the roots of Paeonia lactiflora and Astragalus membranaceus (PAE) demonstrated more excellent hepato-protective activity than the single herbs used individually as indicated in our preliminary studies. The present study was carried out to investigate the effects of PAE on liver fibrosis in rats induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl(4)) and to explore its possible mechanisms. Liver fibrosis was induced in male Sprague-Dawley rats by injection with 50% CCl(4) subcutaneously twice a week for 8 weeks. At the same time, PAE (40, 80 and 160 mg/kg) was administered intragastrically. Upon pathological examination, the PAE-treated rats significantly reduced the liver damage and the symptoms of liver fibrosis. Administration of PAE decreased CCl(4)-induced elevation of serum transaminase activities, hyaluronic acid, laminin and procollagen type III levels, and contents of hydroxyproline in liver tissue by approximately 30-60%. It also restored the decrease in SOD and GSH-Px activities and inhibited the formation of lipid peroxidative products during CCl(4) treatment. Moreover, PAE (80, 160 mg/kg, ig) decreased the elevation of TGF-beta1 by 47.7% and 53.1%, respectively. In the primary cultured hepatic stellate cells (HSCs), PAE also significantly decreased [(3)H] thymidine incorporation in cells stimulated with platelet-derived growth factor-B subunit homodimer (PDGF-BB) and suppressed [(3)H] proline incorporation. These results suggested that PAE significantly inhibited the progression of hepatic fibrosis induced by CCl(4), and the inhibitory effect of PAE on hepatic fibrosis might be associated with its ability to scavenge free radicals, decrease the level of TGF-beta1 and inhibit collagen synthesis and proliferation in HSCs.",M2
17565873,"[Effects of <e>Astragalus</e> polysaccharides and Cordyceps sinensis mycelium mixture on the transforming growth factor-beta1 expression in chronic rejection of artery transplantation: experiment with rats]OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of Astragalus polysaccharides (APS) and Cordyceps sinensis (CP) mycelium mixture on the chronic rejection of artery transplantation. METHODS: The abdominal arteries of 180 Wistar rats were isolated and transplanted to 180 SD rats whose with their abdominal arteries resected. The 180 recipient SD rats were randomly divided into blank control group (n = 20), APS group (n = 40, receiving gastric perfusion of APS 1 mg/kg bid), APS + low-dose CP group (n = 40, receiving APS and CP mycelium powder 1.25 g/d), APS + medium-dose CP group (n = 40, receiving APS and CP mycelium powder 2.5 g/d), and APS + high-dose CP group (n = 40, receiving APS and CP mycelium powder 5 g/d). Thirty days later the SD rats were killed with the transplanted abdominal arteries taken out to undergo microscopy. The expression of transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta(1) in the transplanted artery was examined by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: In the control group, overexpression of TGF-beta(1) was observed in the intimal smooth muscle cells, monocytes, arterial endothelial cells, and arteriole, venule, and blood capillary endothelial cells in extima. However, the expression levels of TGF-beta(1) in the APS group and the 3 mixture administration groups were all significantly lower, especially in the medium- and high-dose groups (all P &lt; 0.01). Severe edema of arterial endothelial cells and proliferation of monocytes were observed microscopically in the control group. Under electron microscope, rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi body were abundant in the control group. While in the mixture administration groups these changes were either weakened or absent. CONCLUSION: Astragalus polysaccharides and Cordyceps sinensis mycelium polysaccharides mixture can decrease the expression of TGF-beta(1) and inhibit the synthesis of collagen in the transplanted arteries.",M2
19093431,"Determination and discrimination of intraspecific diversity of <e>Astragalus</e> gossypinus by eco-phytosociological method from west of Iran.Astragalus gossypinus Fischer with wide distribution in Iran belongs to the genus Astragalus (Fabaceae). According to existing references and information, individuals of this species are present in many stations with different ecological conditions. This study carried out for determination and discrimination of intraspecific diversity of Astragalus gossypinus by Eco-phytosociological method from west of Iran. In this method, the principle of data collecting and analyzing based on floristical composition (as floristical markers) of each Endogenous milieu (as the unit of study in Eco-phytosociological method). In this order, application of Endogenous milieu (special station) for data collecting and then their analyzing permit us only determine existence of inter and intraspecific diversity. Then for determinating kind and level of intraspecific diversity (Ecophene, Chemotype, Cytotype, Ecotype ...), can use other studies such as: morphological, anatomical, phytochemical, cytological and etc. In this survey, 29 special stations were studied and 195 species distinguished as companions for Astragalus gossypinus. Then floristic-ecologic data collected from each 29 special stations and analyzed by Anaphyto software (F.C.A, A.H.C, B.O, Marquag methods). Comparison of obtained results on multiple coordinate axes from F.C.A method with results from B.O, Marquag and A.H.C methods led to determination of 7 main groups of Endogenous milieus (special station). Flavonoid analyses were used for determinating kind and level of intraspecific diversity in 7 discriminated groups. Leaves flavonoid components of all collected individuals of Astragalus gossypinus were investigated by TLC method. Obtained data from flavonoid survey analyzed by SPSS and MVSP package with WARD and UPGMA methods. Finally, the results of flavonoid studies confirmed the same 7 groups that identified by floristical composition study and showed intraspecific diversity in chemotype level. So according to these results, we can introduce 7 chemotypes for Astragalus gossypinus from west of Iran. These chemotypes exist in different stations with various ecological conditions.",M2
17492492,"Symptomology and etiology of a new disease, yellow stunt, and root rot of standing milkvetch caused by Embellisia sp. in Northern China.An Embellisia sp. has been established as the cause of a new disease of the herbaceous perennial forage legume, 'standing milkvetch' (<e>Astragalus</e> adsurgens Pall.) in Northern China, which severely reduces plant density and degrades A. adsurgens stands. The disease was common at an experimental location in Gansu Province where it was recognized by the occurrence of stunted plants with reddish-brown stems and yellow and necrotic leaf blades. An Embellisia sp. was isolated from symptomatic stem, leaf blade, petiole, and root tissues at varying frequencies of up to 90%. Single-spore isolates grew very slowly on PCA, PDA, V-8 and, wheat hay decoction agar. Pathogenicity was confirmed by inoculation of seeds, dipping 2-day-old pre-germinated seedlings in inoculum and spraying inoculum on 6-month-old plants. Symptoms on test plants included yellow leaf lesions, brown lesions on stems and petioles, stunted side-shoots with yellow, small, distorted and necrotic leaves, shoot blight, bud death, crown rot, root rot, and plant death. The disease is named as 'yellow stunt and root rot' of A. adsurgens to distinguish it from diseases caused by other known pathogens. Embellisia sp. is also pathogenic to A. sinicus but not to 11 other tested plant species.",M2
17609906,"Clinical study on effect of <e>Astragalus</e> Injection and its immuno-regulation action in treating chronic aplastic anemia.OBJECTIVE: To observe the clinical effect of Astragalus Injection (, AI) and its immuno-regulatory action in treating chronic aplastic anemia (CAA). METHODS: Sixty patients with CAA were randomly assigned to two groups equally, both were treated with Stanozolol three times a day, 2 mg each time through oral intake, but AI was given additionally to the patients in the treated group once a day via intravenous dripping. All were treated for 15 days as one therapeutic course and the whole medication lasted for more than 4 months totally, with follow-up adopted. The clinical efficacy was estimated and the changes of T-lymphocyte subsets in peripheral blood as well as the serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-2 (IL-2) were observed. RESULTS: The total effective rate in the treated group was 83.3% (25/30), which was higher than that in the control group 66.7% (20/30), showing significant difference between them (P&lt;0.05). Levels of hemoglobin, WBC, reticular cell and platelet were elevated in both groups after treatment, but the improvement was significantly better in the treated group than that in the control group with respect to the former three indexes (P&lt;0.05). The level of CD4(+) increased and that of CD8(+) decreased significantly after treatment in the treated group (P&lt;0.05), which showed significant difference as compared with those in the control group (P&lt;0.05). Levels of serum TNF-alpha and IL-2 lowered after treatment in both groups, but significance only showed in the treated group (P&lt;0.05). The degree of proliferation in bone marrow got raised significantly and the percentage of non-hemopoietic cells reduced significantly in the treated group after treatment, also showing significant difference to those in the control group (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: AI could promote the recovery of hemopoietic function, which might be through improving T-lymphocyte subsets and reducing the release of negative regulatory factors such as TNF-alpha and IL-2 to alleviate the inhibition on hemopoietic function.",M2
17593820,"[Effect of <e>Astragalus</e> mongholicus on inducing differentiations of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells into neurocyte-like cells]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the differentiations of rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) into neurocyte-like cells induced by Astragalus mongholicus. METHODS: We isolated the nucleated cells from rat bone marrows through gradient centrifugation, and cultured and purified the MSCs. The non-serum-L-DMEM containing Astragalus mongholicus was used to induce the differentiations of the MSCs into neurcyte-like cells. The morphologic changes of the differentiated cells were observed. The expressions of the nestin, neuron specific enolase (NSE) and glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) were detected by immuncytochemistrical staining. The expressions of the Wnt-1 gene and neurogenin-1 (Ngn-1)gene were detected by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. RESULTS: The subculturing cells were fibroblast-like, with higher reproductive activities than the primary cells. The Astragalus mongholicus induced morphology changes of the MSCs. The immunocytochemistrical staining of Nestin, NSE and GFAP were positive. The MSCs became neuron-like and gliocyte-like cells. The Astragalus mongholicus also enhanced the expression of Wnt-1 gene and Ngn-1 gene. CONCLUSION: The MS(s can be isolated and cultured in vitro. and can differentiate into neurocyte-like and gliocyte-like cells. Wnt-1 gene and Ngn-1 gene play important regulatory roles during the differentiation of the rat bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells to neurocyte-like cells.",M2
