20493817,"Transcriptional control of a plant <e>stem</e> cell niche.Despite the independent evolution of multicellularity in plants and animals, the basic organization of their stem cell niches is remarkably similar. Here, we report the genome-wide regulatory potential of WUSCHEL, the key transcription factor for stem cell maintenance in the shoot apical meristem of the reference plant Arabidopsis thaliana. WUSCHEL acts by directly binding to at least two distinct DNA motifs in more than 100 target promoters and preferentially affects the expression of genes with roles in hormone signaling, metabolism, and development. Striking examples are the direct transcriptional repression of CLAVATA1, which is part of a negative feedback regulation of WUSCHEL, and the immediate regulation of transcriptional repressors of the TOPLESS family, which are involved in auxin signaling. Our results shed light on the complex transcriptional programs required for the maintenance of a dynamic and essential stem cell niche.",M1
20429469,"Photosynthesis and yield reductions from wheat <e>stem</e> sawfly (Hymenoptera: Cephidae): interactions with wheat solidness, water stress, and phosphorus deficiency.The impact of herbivory on plants is variable and influenced by several factors. The current study examined causes of variation in the impact of larval stem mining by the wheat stem sawfly, Cephus cinctus Norton (Hymenoptera: Cephidae), on spring wheat, Triticum aestivum L. We performed greenhouse experiments over 2 yr to (1) study whether biotic (hollow versus solid stemmed host wheat) and abiotic (water, phosphorus stress) factors interact with C. cinctus stem mining to influence degree of mined stem physiological (photosynthesis) and yield (grain weight) reductions; and (2) determine whether whole plant yield compensatory responses occur to offset stem-mining reductions. Flag leaf photosynthetic reduction was not detected 16-20 d after infestation, but were detected at 40-42 d and doubled from water or phosphorus stresses. Main stem grain weight decreased from 10 to 25% from stem mining, largely due to reductions in grain size, with greater reductions under low phosphorus and/or water levels. Phosphorus-deficient plants without water stress were most susceptible to C. cinctus, more than doubling the grain weight reduction due to larval feeding relative to other water and phosphorus treatments. Two solid stemmed varieties with stem mining had less grain weight loss than a hollow stemmed variety, so greater internal mechanical resistance may reduce larval stem mining and plant yield reductions. Our results emphasize the importance of sufficient water and macronutrients for plants grown in regions impacted by C. cinctus. Also, solid stemmed varieties not only reduce wheat lodging from C. cinctus, they may reduce harvested grain losses from infested stems.",M1

20405929,"Chuktabularins E-T, 16-Norphragmalin Limonoids from Chukrasia tabularis var. velutina.Chuktabularins E-T (1-16), 16 new 16-norphragmalin limonoids, together with four known compounds, chuktabularins A-D, were isolated from the <e>stem</e> bark of Chukrasia tabularis var. velutina. These compounds possess a biosynthetically extended propionyl or acetyl group at C-15 and a characteristic ketal moiety between the limonoid skeleton and the acyl substituent at C-15. The structures of these compounds were established on the basis of detailed spectroscopic analysis, and that of 1 was confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray diffraction experiment, representing the first verification of the skeleton of 16-norphragmalin limonoids. Chuktabularins K-O (7-11) were found to be the first 19-acetoxylated 16-norphragmalin limonoids. Variable-temperature (1)H NMR experiments suggested that 7 exists as an equilibrium mixture of conformational isomers in solution. The absolute configuration of 5 was determined by the CD exciton chirality method on its 11,12-di-p-chlorobenzoate (5a), and those of 1-4 and 6-16 were proposed by correlating with 5 spectroscopically and biogenetically.",M1
20403175,"Cell-specific expression of tryptophan decarboxylase and 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase, key genes involved in camptothecin biosynthesis in Camptotheca acuminata Decne (Nyssaceae).BACKGROUND: Camptotheca acuminata is a major natural source of the terpenoid indole alkaloid camptothecin (CPT). At present, little is known about the cellular distribution of the biosynthesis of CPT, which would be useful knowledge for developing new strategies and technologies for improving alkaloid production. RESULTS: The pattern of CPT accumulation was compared with the expression pattern of some genes involved in CPT biosynthesis in C. acuminata [i.e., Ca-TDC1 and Ca-TDC2 (encoding for tryptophan decarboxylase) and Ca-HGO (encoding for 10-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase)]. Both CPT accumulation and gene expression were investigated in plants at different degrees of development and in plantlets subjected to drought-stress. In all organs, CPT accumulation was detected in epidermal idioblasts, in some glandular trichomes, and in groups of idioblast cells localized in parenchyma tissues. Drought-stress caused an increase in CPT accumulation and in the number of glandular trichomes containing CPT, whereas no increase in epidermal or parenchymatous idioblasts was observed. In the leaf, Ca-TDC1 expression was detected in some epidermal cells and in groups of mesophyll cells but not in glandular trichomes; in the <e>stem</e>, it was observed in parenchyma cells of the vascular tissue; in the root, no expression was detected. Ca-TDC2 expression was observed exclusively in leaves of plantlets subjected to drought-stress, in the same sites described for Ca-TDC1. In the leaf, Ca-HGO was detected in all chlorenchyma cells; in the stem, it was observed in the same sites described for Ca-TDC1; in the root, no expression was detected. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that the sites of CPT accumulation are not consistently the same as those in which the studied genes are expressed demonstrates an organ-to-organ and cell-to-cell translocation of CPT or its precursors.",M1

Among different fractions, dichloromethane fraction showed significant antimicrobial activity against Gram-positive, Gram-negative and fungi. The most significant antimicrobial activity was seen against Staphylococcus aureus which reflects it potentiality to be used in skin infections.",M1
20384855,"Autohydrolysis of plant xylans by apoplastic expression of thermophilic bacterial endo-xylanases.The genes encoding the two endo-xylanases XynA and XynB from the thermophilic bacterium Dictyoglomus thermophilum were codon optimized for expression in plants. Both xylanases were designed to be constitutively expressed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter and targeted to the apoplast. Transient expression in tobacco and stable expression in transgenic Arabidopsis showed that both enzymes were expressed in an active form with temperature optima at 85 degrees C. Transgenic Arabidopsis accumulating heterologous endo-xylanases appeared phenotypically normal and were fully fertile. The highest xylanase activity in Arabidopsis was found in dry <e>stems</e> indicating that the enzymes were not degraded during stem senescence. High levels of enzyme activity were maintained in cell-free extracts from dry transgenic stems during incubation at 85 degrees C for 24 h.

20352262,"Sugarcane DIRIGENT and O-methyltransferase promoters confer <e>stem</e>-regulated gene expression in diverse monocots.Transcription profiling analysis identified Saccharum hybrid DIRIGENT (SHDIR16) and Omicron-Methyltransferase (SHOMT), putative defense and fiber biosynthesis-related genes that are highly expressed in the stem of sugarcane, a major sucrose accumulator and biomass producer. Promoters (Pro) of these genes were isolated and fused to the beta-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter gene. Transient and stable transgene expression analyses showed that both Pro( DIR16 ):GUS and Pro( OMT ):GUS retain the expression characteristics of their respective endogenous genes in sugarcane and function in orthologous monocot species, including rice, maize and sorghum. Furthermore, both promoters conferred stem-regulated expression, which was further enhanced in the stem and induced in the leaf and root by salicylic acid, jasmonic acid and methyl jasmonate, key regulators of biotic and abiotic stresses. Pro( DIR16 ) and Pro( OMT ) will enable functional gene analysis in monocots, and will facilitate engineering monocots for improved carbon metabolism, enhanced stress tolerance and bioenergy production.",M1
20339142,"Changes of xylem sap ionic content and <e>stem</e> hydraulics in response to irradiance in Laurus nobilis.This study reports experimental evidence for light-mediated changes of stem hydraulic conductance (K(stem)) in field-grown laurel plants. Field measurements based on the evaporative flux method revealed that sun-exposed branches had 60% higher K(stem) with respect to shade-exposed branches. Xylem sap potassium concentration was approximately 3 mM as recorded in shaded branches and up to 12 mM in illuminated ones. Such a difference in [K(+)] proved to induce significant increase in xylem hydraulic conductance of excised twigs when artificially perfused with various solutions, as a likely consequence of the interaction of cations with the pectic matrix of pit membranes (the so-called 'ionic effect'). We propose that this mechanism provides plants with a large potential for fine regulation of water flow towards different parts of the canopy exposed to different environmental conditions with the result of optimizing light and water utilization.",M1

20222410,"[Absorption and distribution of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in Chrysanthemum morifolium]OBJECTIVE: To study Chrysanthemum morifolium dry matter accumulation and absorption characteristics of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium at different growth stages. METHOD: Through the field experiment and the sampling analysis, the absorbing capacity of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium as well as the growth of plant at different growth stages in Ch. morifolium were analyzed. RESULT: The dry matter accumulation reached 70.4% of the total accumulation within 60-150 days after transplantation. Dry matter mainly distributed in leaf within 60 days after transplantation, the distribution ratio in the <e>stem</e> was higher than that in leaf within 60-150 days after transplantation, the highest distribution ratio was the flower, and the second was the root within 150-210 days after transplantation. The accumulative capacity of N, P and K by Ch. morifolium was lower within 45 days after transplantation, which only accounted for 16.14%, 13.39% and 10.19% of total absorptive capacity, respectively. But it increased rapidly within 45-150 days after transplantation, which accounted for 71.86%, 63.81% and 62.94% respectively. The nitrogen accumulation was slower, while the accumulation of phosphorus and potassium was increased rapidly, within 150-210 days after transplantation. The distribution ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was different within different organs in different growth stages. The distribution ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was mainly distributed in stem and leaf, within 150 days after transplantation, then transferring to the flower and root, the transferring efficiency was N &gt; P &gt; K. CONCLUSION: the absorption capacity of K was the highest, followed by N and P. The N : P205 : K2O ratio was 1 : 0.88 : 1.58. Correlation analysis showed that dry matter accumulation and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium accumulation correlated positively. For producing 1g dry matter, Ch. morifolium needed to absorb 5.198 1 mg N, 4.329 5 mg P205 and 7.138 5 mg K20 from soil and fertilizer.",M1
20219660,"Composition, standardization and chemical profiling of Banisteriopsis caapi, a plant for the treatment of neurodegenerative disorders relevant to Parkinson's disease.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Banisteriopsis caapi, a woody vine from the Amazonian basin, is popularly known as an ingredient of a sacred drink ayahuasca, widely used throughout the Amazon as a medicinal tea for healing and spiritual exploration. The usefulness of Banisteriopsis caapi has been established for alleviating symptoms of neurological disorders including Parkinson's disease. AIM OF THE STUDY: Primary objective of this study was to develop the process for preparing standardized extracts of Banisteriopsis caapi to achieve high potency for inhibition of human monoamine oxidases (MAO) and antioxidant properties. The aqueous extracts prepared from different parts of the plant collected from different geographical locations and seasons were analyzed by HPLC for principal bioactive markers. The extracts were simultaneously tested in vitro for inhibition of human MAOs and antioxidant activity for analysis of correlation between phytochemical composition of the extracts and bioactivities. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Reversed-phase HPLC with photodiode array detection was employed to profile the alkaloidal and non-alkaloidal components of the aqueous extract of Banisteriopsis caapi. The Banisteriopsis caapi extracts and standardized compositions were tested in vitro for inhibition of recombinant preparations of human MAO-A and MAO-B. In vitro cell-based assays were employed for evaluation of antioxidant property and mammalian cell cytotoxicity of these preparations. RESULTS: Among the different aerial parts, leaves, <e>stems</e>/large branches and stem bark of Banisteriopsis caapi, HPLC analysis revealed that most of the dominant chemical and bioactive markers (1, 2, 5, 7-9) were present in high concentrations in dried bark of large branch. A library of HPLC chromatograms has also been generated as a tool for fingerprinting and authentication of the studied Banisteriopsis caapi species. The correlation between potency of MAO inhibition and antioxidant activity with the content of the main active constituents of the aqueous Banisteriopsis caapi extracts and standardized compositions was established. Phytochemical analysis of regular/commercial Banisteriopsis caapi dried stems, obtained from different sources, showed a similar qualitative HPLC profile, but relatively low content of dominant markers 1, 2, 7, and 9, which led to decreased MAO inhibitory and antioxidant potency compared to Banisteriopsis caapi Da Vine. CONCLUSION: The ethnopharmacological use of bark of matured stem/large branch of Banisteriopsis caapi as well as whole matured stem is supported by the results obtained in this investigation. Among various constituents of Banisteriopsis caapi, harmine (7), harmaline (6) and tetrahydroharmine (5) are responsible for MAO-A inhibition, while two major proanthocyanidines, epicatechin (8) and procyanidine B2 (9) produce antioxidant effects. The compounds 1-9 can serve as reliable markers for identification and standardization of Banisteriopsis caapi aerial parts, collected in different seasons and/or from different geographical regions.",M1
20209920,"[Effects of Scutellaria baicalensis <e>stem</e>-leaf total flavonoid on proliferation of vassel smooth muscle cells stimulated by high triglyceride blood serum]OBJECTIVE: To determine the effects and related mechanism of Scutellaria baicalensis stem-leaf total flavonoid (SSTF) on vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) proliferation induced by high triglyceride blood serum (HTG). METHOD: VSMCs isolated from rat aorta were cultured in vitro and proliferation was stimulated by HTG, SSTF was added to influence the proliferation of VSMCs. The proliferation and cell cycle of VSMCs were determined by MTT assay and flow cytometry, respectively. CO released into the culture media was quantitated by measuring carbon monoxide hemoglobin (COHb). The protein expressions of HO-1 and extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK/p-ERK) were detected by Western blot analysis. RESULT: 500 mg x L(-1) SSTF could obviously suppress the cell multiplication by HTG's induction, remarkably increase the production of COHb in VSMCs, obviously suppresse the mitotic cycle progress of VSMCs (P &lt; 0.05, P &lt; 0.01), in the time and dosage dependence. Furthermore, 500 mg x L(-1) SSTF remarkably declined the ERK/p-ERK protein expression (P &lt; 0.01), but did not have the influence on the HO-1 protein's expression. CONCLUSION: SSTF inhibited the proliferation of VSMCs directly by blocking cell cycle progression, and the ERK signal transduction way possibly participated in the cytoprotection of SSTF.",M1
20207480,"Biosorption studies on powder of <e>stem</e> of Acacia nilotica: Removal of arsenic from surface water.In present study a biomass derived from the stem of Acacia nilotica has been investigated to remove As ions from surface water samples of different origins (lake, canal and river). The effects of various parameters viz. pH, biosorbent dosage, contact time and temperature on the biosorption processes were systematically studied. Experimental data were modeled by Langmuir, Freundlich and Dubinin-Radushkevich (D-R) isotherms. It was observed that As biosorption best fitted to the Langmuir and Freundlich isotherms. The mean sorption energy (E) calculated from D-R model, indicated physico-chemical biosorption. Study of thermodynamic parameters revealed the endothermic, spontaneous and feasible nature of biosorption process. The pseudo-second-order rate equation described better the kinetics of As biosorption with good correlation coefficients than pseudo-first-order equation. The biomass of A. nilotica was found to be effective for the removal of As with 95% sorption efficiency at a concentration of &lt;200 microg/L of As solution, and thus uptake capacity is 50.8 mg As/g of biomass. The A. nilotica biomass could be used as a low-cost biosorbent for As ion removal.",M1
20199690,"Genome-wide transcriptome analysis of the transition from primary to secondary <e>stem</e> development in Populus trichocarpa.BACKGROUND: With its genome sequence and other experimental attributes, Populus trichocarpa has become the model species for genomic studies of wood development. Wood is derived from secondary growth of tree stems, and begins with the development of a ring of vascular cambium in the young developing stem. The terminal region of the developing shoot provides a steep developmental gradient from primary to secondary growth that facilitates identification of genes that play specialized functions during each of these phases of growth. RESULTS: Using a genomic microarray representing the majority of the transcriptome, we profiled gene expression in stem segments that spanned primary to secondary growth. We found 3,016 genes that were differentially expressed during stem development (Q-value &lt;/= 0.05; &gt;2-fold expression variation), and 15% of these genes encode proteins with no significant identities to known genes. We identified all gene family members putatively involved in secondary growth for carbohydrate active enzymes, tubulins, actins, actin depolymerizing factors, fasciclin-like AGPs, and vascular development-associated transcription factors. Almost 70% of expressed transcription factors were upregulated during the transition to secondary growth. The primary shoot elongation region of the stem contained specific carbohydrate active enzyme and expansin family members that are likely to function in primary cell wall synthesis and modification. Genes involved in plant defense and protective functions were also dominant in the primary growth region. CONCLUSION: Our results describe the global patterns of gene expression that occur during the transition from primary to secondary stem growth. We were able to identify three major patterns of gene expression and over-represented gene ontology categories during stem development. The new regulatory factors and cell wall biogenesis genes that we identified provide candidate genes for further functional characterization, as well as new tools for molecular breeding and biotechnology aimed at improvement of tree growth rate, crown form, and wood quality.",M1

20158616,"Moving water well: comparing hydraulic efficiency in twigs and trunks of coniferous, ring-porous, and diffuse-porous saplings from temperate and tropical forests.*Coniferous, diffuse-porous and ring-porous trees vary in their xylem anatomy, but the functional consequences of these differences are not well understood from the scale of the conduit to the individual. *Hydraulic and anatomical measurements were made on branches and trunks from 16 species from temperate and tropical areas, representing all three wood types. Scaling of <e>stem</e> conductivity (K(h)) with stem diameter was used to model the hydraulic conductance of the stem network. *Ring-porous trees showed the steepest increase in K(h) with stem size. Temperate diffuse-porous trees were at the opposite extreme, and conifers and tropical diffuse-porous species were intermediate. Scaling of K(h) was influenced by differences in the allometry of conduit diameter (taper) and packing (number per wood area) with stem size. *The K(h) trends were mirrored by the modeled stem-network conductances. Ring-porous species had the greatest network conductance and this value increased isometrically with trunk basal area, indicating that conductance per unit sapwood was independent of tree size. Conductances were lowest and most size-dependent in conifers. The results indicate that differences in conduit taper and packing between functional types propagate to the network level and have an important influence on metabolic scaling concepts.",M1

Moreover, the berberine content varied significantly with altitude and edaphic conditions both in root and stem bark samples. The populations growing at low altitude contained significantly more berberine than the ones growing at high altitude. Also the moisture and potassium (K) percentage of the soil significantly influenced the berberine content.",M1
20146840,"Factors affecting <e>stem</e> borer parasitoid species diversity and parasitism in cultivated and natural habitats.The effects of biotic and abiotic factors on stem borer parasitoid diversity, abundance, and parasitism were studied in cultivated and natural habitats in four agroecological zones in Kenya. Comparing habitat types, we found partial support for the  natural enemy  hypothesis, whereby, across all localities, parasitoid diversity was higher in more diverse host plant communities in natural habitats, whereas parasitoid abundance was higher in cultivated habitats. For both habitats, parasitoid richness was mainly influenced by stem borer density and/or its interaction with stem borer richness, whereas parasitoid abundance was mainly affected by stem borer abundance. Parasitoid richness was higher in localities (with bimodal rainfall distribution) with increased spatial and temporal availability of host plants that harbored the borers. Across seasons, parasitoid richness was lower in both cultivated and natural habitats in the driest locality, Mtito Andei. Overall, parasitoid diversity was low in Suam and Mtito Andei, where maize cultivation was practiced on a commercial scale and intense grazing activities persist across seasons, respectively. Across localities, habitats, and seasons, stem borer parasitism was positively correlated with parasitoid richness and abundance. Furthermore, the interaction of rainfall and altitude influenced the presence and absence of parasitoids, and consequently, stem borer parasitism. Parasitism was positively and negatively correlated with temperature in cultivated and natural habitats, respectively. Overall, natural habitats seem to serve as important refugia for sustaining parasitoid diversity, which in turn can affect stem borer parasitism in the cereal cropping system.",M1
20120464,"Chromium (VI) induced phytotoxicity and oxidative stress in pea (Pisum sativum L.): biochemical changes and translocation of essential nutrients.Due to widespread industrial use, chromium (Cr) is considered a hazardous environmental pollutant. It is known to inhibit plant growth and development. The present study provides the evidence of the phytotoxicity of this metal on the pea (Pisum sativum L. cv Azad) plants. The plants of pea (Pisum sativum L.) were grown in refined sand under different concentrations i.e. 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 and 0.4 mM of Cr (VI) in order to study the effect on growth and yield, photosynthetic pigments, relative water content, non-reducing sugar and protein with activity of certain enzymes like catalase, peroxidase, starch phosphorylase and ribonuclease. The analysis of the results showed that photosynthetic pigments (68.68%), relative water contents (62.77%), non-reducing sugar (66.66%) and protein (81.57%) were decrease along with reduction in plant height (52.69%) and leaf area (50.81%) of the pea plants. However, in response to various concentration of Cr exposed plants showed significant induction of reducing and total sugars with enzymes like catalase, starch phosphorylase and ribonuclease. The translocation of Cr in various part of pea plant have been found in order of root&gt; <e>stem</e>&gt; leaves&gt;seeds which ranged between 34.8 to 217.3 mg g(-1) d.wt. (dry weight) in roots, 6.5 to 173.13 mg g(-1) d.wt. in shoot, 4.2 to 74.43 mg g(-1) d.wt. in leaves and 0.94 to 8.64 mg g(-1) d.wt. in seeds, that is also reflected by the transfer factor of Cr from refined sand to tested species.",M1
20107028,"Cell wall-degrading enzymes enlarge the pore size of intervessel pit membranes in healthy and Xylella fastidiosa-infected grapevines.The pit membrane (PM) is a primary cell wall barrier that separates adjacent xylem water conduits, limiting the spread of xylem-localized pathogens and air embolisms from one conduit to the next. This paper provides a characterization of the size of the pores in the PMs of grapevine (Vitis vinifera). The PM porosity (PMP) of <e>stems</e> infected with the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa was compared with the PMP of healthy stems. Stems were infused with pressurized water and flow rates were determined; gold particles of known size were introduced with the water to assist in determining the size of PM pores. The effect of introducing trans-1,2-diaminocyclohexane-N,N,N',N'-tetraacetic acid (CDTA), oligogalacturonides, and polygalacturonic acid into stems on water flux via the xylem was also measured. The possibility that cell wall-degrading enzymes could alter the pore sizes, thus facilitating the ability of X. fastidiosa to cross the PMs, was tested. Two cell wall-degrading enzymes likely to be produced by X. fastidiosa (polygalactuoronase and endo-1,4- beta -glucanase) were infused into stems, and particle passage tests were performed to check for changes in PMP. Scanning electron microscopy of control and enzyme-infused stem segments revealed that the combination of enzymes opened holes in PMs, probably explaining enzyme impacts on PMP and how a small X. fastidiosa population, introduced into grapevines by insect vectors, can multiply and spread throughout the vine and cause Pierce's disease.",M1

Commercial in vitro multiplication of chrysanthemum is often based on <e>stem</e> nodal explants with lateral meristems. This chapter describes a protocol for in vitro propagation from stem nodal explants and by direct organogenesis from pedicel explants producing large number of true-to-type plantlets in 4-8 week on Murashige and Skoog (MS) based media. Also, true mutants with changed flower color are obtained without producing chimeras after gamma-irradiation in mutation breeding.",M1
20099091,"Micropropagation of poinsettia by organogenesis.Poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima) is one of the most popular ornamental pot plants. Conventional propagation is by cuttings, generally focused on a period prior to the most intensive time of sales. Rapid multiplication of elite clones, the production of pathogen-free plants and more rapid introduction of novel cultivars (cvs.) with desirable traits, represent important driving forces in the poinsettia industry. In recent years, different strategies have been adopted to micropropagate poinsettia, which could assist breeders to meet consumer demands. The development of reliable in vitro regeneration procedures is likely to play a crucial role in future production systems. <e>Stem</e> nodal explants cultured on semi-solid MS-based medium supplemented with benzylaminopurine (BAP) and naphthalene acetic acid (NAA) develop shoots from adventitious/axillary buds after 7 weeks of culture. Rooting of in vitro regenerated shoots is achieved in semi-solid MS-based medium containing the auxin indole-3-acetic acid (IAA). Four to six weeks after transfer to root-inducing medium, regenerated plants can be transferred to compost and acclimatized in the glasshouse. Direct shoot regeneration from cultured explants is important to minimize somaclonal variation in regenerated plants.",M1
20095144,"Toxicological and phytochemical studies of Aspidosperma subincanum Mart. <e>stem</e> bark (Guatambu).Aspidosperma subincanum Mart. is widely used in Brazilian folk medicine to treat digestive disorders. In this study, acute and subchronic toxicity and cytotoxicity of stem bark ethanolic extract of Aspidosperma subincanum (EEAs) have been evaluated. In addition, phytochemical analysis was performed. The EEAs had low acute toxicity in mice with LD50 =1129 +/- 154mg/kg p.o. and 397 +/- 15 mg/kg i.p. The LC50 was 1340 +/- 428 microg/mL in the brine shrimp assay. There was no relevance of serious changes in behavioral, hematological and biochemical parameters and no deleterious effect on vital organs of rats that resulted after 30 days daily exposure to 5 and 100 mg/kg of EEAs. Phytochemical analysis of stem bark of A. subincanum revealed the presence of indole alkaloids, saponins, terpenoids, steroids and tannins and resulted in the isolation of oleic acid and guatambuine as major constituents. Using the method of the dose by factor approach, the human safe dose was 210 mg/70 kg/day. The EEAs appears to be safe and non-toxic in low doses in rodents and domestic preparations used by population have relatively security.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Graded concentrations (100, 200, 400, 800, 1600 and 3200 mg/kg) of the crude stem bark ethanolic extract of Azadirachta indica, Hochst ex. A. Dc. (Maliacea) was tested for acute toxicity in 35 out bred Swiss (Wister) adult albino rats of both sexes. Secondly, the in vitro activity in test tubes and in vivo activity of the extract in 30 out bred Swiss (Wister) adult albino rats against Trypanosoma brucei brucei strain NITR/14 (Federe) was evaluated in a graded dose manner. RESULTS: The calculated intra-peritoneal LD(50) of the extract was 870 mg/kg and produced toxicity at high doses (&gt;800 mg/kg). Graded concentrations of the ethanolic extract produced remarkable in vitro activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei within seconds of inoculation. It also suppressed the establishment of parasitaemia at 100mg/kg when administered simultaneously with infection in vivo. Similarly, at 200 and 400mg/kg, the extract administered at the onset of parasitaemia for 4 consecutive days reduced parasitaemia, modulated declined packed volume (PCV) changes by day 48 post-infection in vivo. CONCLUSION: The results confirm that the folkloric medicinal application of the extract of Azadirachta indica (Maliacea) has a pharmacological basis. Further investigation is however, needed to optimize the effectiveness of the extract.",M1
20075638,"Characterization of a phenazine and hexanoyl homoserine lactone producing Pseudomonas aurantiaca strain PB-St2, isolated from sugarcane <e>stem</e>.A novel strain of fluorescent pseudomonad (PB-St2) was isolated from surface-sterilized stems of sugarcane grown in Pakistan. The bacterium was identified as Pseudomonas aurantiaca on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and results from physiological and biochemical characteristics carried out with API50 CH and QTS 24 bacterial identification kits. Assays using substrate specific media for enzymes revealed lipase and protease activities but cellulase, chitinase, or pectinase were not detected. The bacterium was unable to solubilize phosphate or produce indole acetic acid. However, it did produce HCN, siderophores, and homoserine lactones. In dual culture assays on agar, the bacterium showed antifungal activity against an important pathogen of sugarcane in Pakistan, namely Colletotrichum falcatum, as well as for pathogenic isolates of Fusarium oxysporium, F. lateritium but not against F. solani. The antifungal metabolites were identified using thin-layer chromatography, UV-spectra, and MALDI-TOFF spectra and shown to be phenazine-1-carboxylic acid (PCA), 2-hydroxyphenazine (2-OH-PHZ), and N-hexanoyl homoserine lactone (HHL) (assessed using only TLC data). The capacity of this bacterium to produce HCN and 2-OH-PHZ, as well as to inhibit the growth of C. falcatum, has not been previously reported.",M1
20074458,"Effect of phytoncide from trees on human natural killer cell function.We previously reported that the forest environment enhanced human natural killer (NK) cell activity, the number of NK cells, and intracellular anti-cancer proteins in lymphocytes, and that the increased NK activity lasted for more than 7 days after trips to forests both in male and female subjects. To explore the factors in the forest environment that activated human NK cells, in the present study we investigate the effect of essential oils from trees on human immune function in twelve healthy male subjects, age 37-60 years, who stayed at an urban hotel for 3 nights from 7.00 p.m. to 8.00 a.m. Aromatic volatile substances (phytoncides) were produced by vaporizing Chamaecyparis obtusa (hinoki cypress) <e>stem</e> oil with a humidifier in the hotel room during the night stay. Blood samples were taken on the last day and urine samples were analysed every day during the stay. NK activity, the percentages of NK and T cells, and granulysin, perforin, granzyme A/B-expressing lymphocytes in blood, and the concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in urine were measured. Similar control measurements were made before the stay on a normal working day. The concentrations of phytoncides in the hotel room air were measured. Phytoncide exposure significantly increased NK activity and the percentages of NK, perforin, granulysin, and granzyme A/B-expressing cells, and significantly decreased the percentage of T cells, and the concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline in urine. Phytoncides, such as alpha-pinene and beta-pinene, were detected in the hotel room air. These findings indicate that phytoncide exposure and decreased stress hormone levels may partially contribute to increased NK activity.",M1
20067911,"Growth-climate relationships vary with height along the <e>stem</e> in lodgepole pine.This study tests the hypothesis that ring growth in the upper stem portion of trees is affected by climatic conditions differently than rings formed at breast height (1.3 m). A total of 389 trees from a network of 65 lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta Dougl. ex Loud. var. latifolia Engelm.) sites in Alberta were examined using detailed stem analysis in order to examine interannual patterns of basal area increment and volume increment at different positions along the stem. Growth at lower sections of the bole was mainly driven by temperature and moisture conditions in the seasons prior to the growing season in the year of ring formation, while upper stem growth was more related to conditions during the year of growth, i.e., temperature in the early summer, or moisture in late winter to early spring. This translates into increased allocation of wood to the lower stem when prior late summer conditions are cool and wet, prior winters are mild (warm with little snow) and early summer conditions in the year of ring formation are hot and dry.",M1

However, the mechanism of action is unknown and only hypoglycaemic effects of S. birrea extract (SBE) in diabetic rats have been reported to date. Here, we tested aqueous extracts of S. birrea on insulin-secreting INS-1E cells and isolated rat islets. Following 24 h of treatment at 5 microg/ml, the extract markedly potentiated glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Neither basal insulin release nor non-nutrient stimulation was affected. The potentiation of the secretory response at stimulatory glucose appeared after 12 h of treatment. No acute effects were observed and, at the effective concentration, SBE was safe regarding cell integrity and differentiation. The mechanism of action of the SBE was related to glucose metabolism as both ATP generation and glucose oxidation were enhanced following the 24-h treatment. In streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats, SBE administration corrected glycaemia and restored plasma insulin levels after 2 weeks of treatment. These data show direct action of S. birrea on insulin-secreting cells and favour further delineation for use of the plant in the management of diabetes.",M1

20051031,"Glutamate induces series of action potentials and a decrease in circumnutation rate in Helianthus annuus.Reports concerning the function of glutamate (Glu) in the electrical and movement phenomena in plants are scarce. Using the method of extracellular measurement, we recorded electrical potential changes in the <e>stem</e> of 3-week-old Helianthus annuus L. plants after injection of Glu solution. Simultaneously, circumnutation movements of the stem were measured with the use of time-lapse images. Injection of Glu solution at millimolar (200, 50, 5 mM) concentrations in the basal part of the stem evoked a series of action potentials (APs). The APs appeared in the site of injection and in different parts of the stem and were propagated acropetally and/or basipetally along the stem. Glu injection also resulted in a transient, approximately 5-h-long decrease in the stem circumnutation rate. The APs initiated and propagating in the sunflower stem after Glu injection testify the existence of a Glu perception system in vascular plants and suggest its involvement in electrical, long-distance signaling. Our experiments also demonstrated that Glu is a factor affecting circumnutation movements.",M1

Methanolic extracts of stems and leaves of P. alliacea showed 100% mortality on the LIT bioassay. On the other hand, methanolic extracts of leaves and stem on the AIT test showed 26% and 86% of mortality, respectively, egg laying inhibition of 40% and 91%, respectively and hatchability inhibition of 26% and 17%, respectively. Purification of the active stem methanolic extract showed that the activity was present in the n-hexane non-polar fraction. Bioassay-guided purification of the n-hexane fraction produced 10 semi-purified fractions; fraction B had the highest activity against tick larvae (100% mortality). Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry demonstrated that the chemical composition of the active fraction B samples were mainly composed of benzyltrisulfide (BTS) and benzyldisulfide (BDS). These metabolites might be responsible for the acaricidal activity of stem extract of P. alliacea. However, further experiments to evaluate the acaricidal activity of BTS and BDS on larvae and adults of R. (B.) microplus are needed. Our results showed that P. alliacea is a promising biocontrol candidate as acaricide against R. (B.) microplus resistant strains.",M1

Two adsorbents, namely SHC and SSC, were prepared from sunflower plant head and <e>stem</e> waste. The adsorbents were characterized by FT-IR, SEM and EDX. The surface areas of SHC and SSC were 1.17 and 1.28 m(2)g(-1), respectively. The effect of various process parameters namely pH, temperature, initial metal ion concentration, adsorbent dosage and contact time has been studied. The optimum conditions for removal of Cr (VI) were found to be pH=2, contact time=2h, adsorbent dosage=4.0 g/L, concentration=250 mg/L, temperature=25+/-1 degrees C, rpm=180. The percent removal at these optimum conditions was found to be 75.7% and 85.4% for SHC and SSC respectively. The Freundlich, Langmuir and D-R models were applied for mathematical description of adsorption equilibrium. Adsorption data were well described by the Langmuir isotherm with maximum adsorption capacities of 53.76 mg/g and 56.49 mg/g for SHC and SSC, respectively. Overall, the experimental results suggest that SHC and SSC could be used as low cost alternative adsorbents for the treatment of Cr(VI) containing wastewater. A comparison of different kinetic models showed that our data fitted well to the pseudo-second order model.",M1
20036413,"Effects of enhanced UV-B radiation on the distribution of mineral elements in soybean (Glycine max) seedlings.In order to understand the effect of ultraviolet-B (UV-B) radiation on plant, the accumulated amount of dry matter and the distribution of the mineral elements in the different organs of soybean seedlings treated with UV-B radiation were investigated using the inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). The results indicated that the accumulated amount of dry matter in root, <e>stem</e> and leaf of soybean seedlings treated with UV-B radiation during the stress and recovery period was lower than that of the control soybean. Moreover, the content of macroelements in the root, stem and leaf of soybean seedlings during the stress period and recovery period were decreased comparing with that of the control soybean. The change in the contents of microelements depended on the intensity of UV-B radiation, the organs of soybean and the treating period. Finally, the results from the stepwise regression analysis indicated that the content of specific microelements also affected the accumulation of dry matter in the soybean seedlings treated with UV-B radiation comparing with the contents of macroelements in the control soybean. The relationship between the contents of mineral elements and the accumulation of dry matter depended on the intensity of UV-B radiation and the organs of soybean. These results demonstrated that UV-B radiation induced the change in the distribution of mineral elements in root, stem and leaf, leading to the decrease in the accumulation of dry matter and then the inhibition of soybean growth. It was a possible effect mechanism of UV-B radiation on plant.",M1

20022920,"Thermoperiodic growth control by gibberellin does not involve changes in photosynthetic or respiratory capacities in pea.Active gibberellin (GA(1)) is an important mediator of thermoperiodic growth in pea. Plants grown under lower day than night temperature (negative DIF) elongate less and have reduced levels of GA(1) compared with plants grown at higher day than night temperature (positive DIF). By comparing the wild type (WT) and the elongated DELLA mutant la cry(s), this study has examined the effect of impaired GA signalling on thermoperiodic growth, photosynthesis, and respiration in pea. In the WT a negative DIF treatment reduced <e>stem</e> mass ratio and increased both root mass ratio and leaf mass ratio (dry weight of specific tissue related to total plant dry weight). Leaf, root and stem mass ratios of la cry(s) were not affected by DIF. Under negative DIF, specific leaf area (projected leaf area per unit leaf dry mass), biomass, and chlorophyll content of WT and la cry(s) plants were reduced. Young, expanding leaves of plants grown under negative DIF had reduced leaf area-based photosynthetic capacity. However, the highest photosynthetic electron transport rate was found in fully expanded leaves of WT plants grown under negative DIF. Negative DIF increased night respiration and was similar for both genotypes. It is concluded that GA signalling is not a major determinant of leaf area-based photosynthesis or respiration and that reduced dry weight of plants grown under negative DIF is caused by a GA-mediated reduction of photosynthetic stem and leaf tissue, reduced photosynthesis of young, expanding leaves, and reduced growth caused by low temperature in the photoperiod.",M1

METHODS: TEE (750 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) and BF (50 mg kg(-1) d(-1)) were given orally for 10 weeks to weaning female Sprague-Dawley rats and for 12 weeks to adult OVx rats of the same strain, respectively. In studies with OVx rats, sham operated + vehicle, OVx + 17beta-estradiol, and OVx + vehicle groups served as various controls. Bone mineral density (BMD), biomechanical strength, bone histology, formations of osteoprogenitor cells, osteoid formation, and bone turnover/resorption markers were studied. Bioactive marker compounds in TEE and BF were analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography. One-way analysis of variance was used to test significance of effects. RESULTS: In growing rats, both TEE and BF increased BMD, bone strength, and bone formation rate, suggesting higher PB achievement. OVx rats treated with either TEE or BF exhibited increased BMD at various anatomical positions and improved bone strength and trabecular architecture compared with the OVx + vehicle group. Serum osteocalcin and urinary type 1 collagen degradation product levels in OVx rats treated with either TEE or BF were significantly lower than those of the OVx + vehicle group. Neither TEE nor BF exhibited uterine estrogenicity. Analysis of marker compounds revealed significant enrichment of two bioactive markers in BF over TEE. CONCLUSIONS: Derived from U wallichiana, BF at much a lower dose than TEE was effective in PB achievement and prevention of OVx-induced bone loss.",M1
19965970,"Tracing cationic nutrients from xylem into <e>stem</e> tissue of French bean by stable isotope tracers and cryo-secondary ion mass spectrometry.Fluxes of mineral nutrients in the xylem are strongly influenced by interactions with the surrounding stem tissues and are probably regulated by them. Toward a mechanistic understanding of these interactions, we applied stable isotope tracers of magnesium, potassium, and calcium continuously to the transpiration stream of cut bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) shoots to study their radial exchange at the cell and tissue level with stem tissues between pith and phloem. For isotope localization, we combined sample preparation with secondary ion mass spectrometry in a completely cryogenic workflow. After 20 min of application, tracers were readily detectable to various degrees in all tissues. The xylem parenchyma near the vessels exchanged freely with the vessels, its nutrient elements reaching a steady state of strong exchange with elements in the vessels within 20 min, mainly via apoplastic pathways. A slow exchange between vessels and cambium and phloem suggested that they are separated from the xylem, parenchyma, and pith, possibly by an apoplastic barrier to diffusion for nutrients (as for carbohydrates). There was little difference in these distributions when tracers were applied directly to intact xylem via a microcapillary, suggesting that xylem tension had little effect on radial exchange of these nutrients and that their movement was mainly diffusive.",M1
19962213,"Mucilage and polysaccharides in the halophyte plant species Kosteletzkya virginica: localization and composition in relation to salt stress.Mucilage is thought to play a role in salinity tolerance in certain halophytic species by regulating water ascent and ion transport. The localization and composition of mucilage in the halophyte Kosteletzkya virginica was therefore investigated. Plants were grown in a hydroponic system in the presence or absence of 100mM NaCl and regularly harvested for growth parameter assessment and mucilage analysis with the gas liquid chromatography method. NaCl treatment stimulated shoot growth and biomass accumulation, had little effect on shoot and root water content, and reduced leaf water potential (Psi(w)), osmotic potential (Psi(s)) as well as stomatal conductance (g(s)). Mucilage increased in shoot, <e>stems</e> and roots in response to salt stress. Furthermore, changes were also observed in neutral monosaccharide components. Levels of rhamnose and uronic acid increased with salinity. Staining with a 0.5% alcian blue solution revealed the presence of mucopolyssacharides in xylem vessels and salt-induced mucilaginous precipitates on the leaf abaxial surface. Determination of ion concentrations showed that a significant increase of Na(+) and a decrease of K(+) and Ca(2+) simultaneously occurred in tissues and in mucilage under salt stress. Considering the high proportion of rhamnose and uronic acid in stem mucilage, we suggest that the pectic polysaccharide could be involved in Na(+) fixation, though only a minor fraction of accumulated sodium appeared to be firmly bound to mucilage.",M1

19955192,"Carbohydrate uptake from xylem vessels and its distribution among <e>stem</e> tissues and buds in walnut (Juglans regia L.).Bud break pattern is a key determinant of tree architecture. The mechanisms leading to the precedence of certain buds over the others are not yet fully explained, but the availability of soluble sugars may play a significant role, especially those in the xylem sap at the onset of the growing period. Here, we measured carbon availability in the different tissues (bud, xylem and bark). To assess the capacity of buds to use the xylem sap carbohydrates, the fluxes between xylem vessels and parenchyma cells, bark and buds of walnut (Juglans regia cv 'Franquette') were measured during the rest period until bud break. This uptake capacity varies according to the temperature, the sugar and the position on the branch of the fragment studied. Between December and March, in xylem tissues, the active component of sucrose uptake was predominant compared with diffusion (90% of the total uptake), whereas the active component accounted for more moderate amounts in buds (50% of the uptake). The active uptake of hexoses took place belatedly (April) in xylem. The flow rates between xylem vessels and buds increased 1 month before bud break and reached 2000 microg sucrose h(-)(1) g DW(-)(1). Fluxes seemed to depend on bud position on the branch. However, this study strongly suggests that they were mainly dependent on the sink strength of the buds and on the sink competition between bud, xylem parenchyma and bark.",M1

METHOD: The samples were collected in three typical habitats and six different production areas of T. terrestris. The main medicinal ingredients saponins and flavonoids were determined in root, <e>stem</e>, leaf and fruit during the harvest time. RESULT: The two ingredients were abounded in leaf and more than 2.61 times as in other parts of the plant. The results showed that there were no differences between the whole plant and the fruit. CONCLUSION: It should pay more attentions on the collection, preservation and utilization of the leaf of T. terrestris in the harvesting and processing stage. The whole plant for medical use was feasibility based on the content of the ingredients.",M1
19939979,"Relationships between xylem vessel characteristics, calculated axial hydraulic conductance and size-controlling capacity of peach rootstocks.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Previous studies indicate that the size-controlling capacity of peach rootstocks is associated with reductions of scion water potential during mid-day that are caused by the reduced hydraulic conductance of the rootstock. Thus, shoot growth appears to be reduced by decreases in <e>stem</e> water potential. The aim of this study was to investigate the mechanism of reduced hydraulic conductance in size-controlling peach rootstocks. METHODS: Anatomical measurements (diameter and frequency) of xylem vessels were determined in shoots, trunks and roots of three contrasting peach rootstocks grown as trees, each with different size-controlling characteristics: 'Nemaguard' (vigorous), 'P30-135' (intermediate vigour) and 'K146-43' (substantially dwarfing). Based on anatomical measurements, the theoretical axial xylem conductance of each tissue type and rootstock genotype was calculated via the Poiseuille-Hagen law. KEY RESULTS: Larger vessel dimensions were found in the vigorous rootstock ('Nemaguard') than in the most dwarfing one ('K146-43') whereas vessels of 'P30-135' had intermediate dimensions. The density of vessels per xylem area in 'Nemaguard' was also less than in 'P30-135'and 'K146-43'. These characteristics resulted in different estimated hydraulic conductance among rootstocks: 'Nemaguard' had higher theoretical values followed by 'P30-135' and 'K146-43'. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that phenotypic differences in xylem anatomical characteristics of rootstock genotypes appear to influence hydraulic conductance capacity directly, and therefore may be the main determinant of dwarfing in these peach rootstocks.",M1
19934174,"Logging residue removal after thinning in boreal forests: long-term impact on the nutrient status of Norway spruce and Scots pine needles.The aim of this study was to compare how conventional <e>stem</e> harvesting (CH) and whole-tree harvesting (WTH) in the first, and in some cases also in the second, thinning affect the needle nutrient status of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris L.) and Norway spruce (Picea abies (L.) Karst.) stands in Finland. A series of 12 long-term field experiments was studied. The experiments were established during 1978-86. The effects of logging residue removal after thinnings on the needle nutrient concentrations were generally minor and without any overall trends, but there were differences between experiments. Trees tend to maintain their current needle nutrient concentrations at the same level by re-utilizing the nutrients stored in the older tissues and by changing C allocation in the whole tree. Thus, needle analysis should be combined with stem growth data in order to achieve a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of WTH on the nutrient status of trees.",M1
19933494,"Morphology and oxidative physiology of boron-deficient mulberry plants.The aim of the study was to induce B deficiency symptoms and to relate the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and altered cellular redox environment with the effects of B deficiency in mulberry (Morus alba L.) cv. Kanva-2 plants. Study was undertaken on antioxidant responses, malondialdehyde (MDA) content as an indicator of oxidative damage and ratio of dehydroascorbate (DHA) to ascorbic acid (AsA) as an index of cellular redox environment in B-deficient (0.0 microM) and B-supraoptimal (33 microM) mulberry plants. B deficiency symptoms appeared as upward cupping of the young emerging leaves. Later on, B-deficient plants developed lenticels like cracks on major vein, petiole and <e>stem</e>. B-deficient leaves had higher water potential (Psi) and relative water content (RWC), contained a lower concentration of B, less chloroplastic pigments and high tissue Fe, Mn and Zn concentrations compared to the controls. Hydrogen peroxide was accumulated in leaves of B-deficient and B-supraoptimal plants. B-supraoptimal plants also showed an increased DHA/AsA ratio. The activities of superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1.15.1.1), catalase (CAT, EC 1.11.1.6), peroxidase (POD, EC 1.11.1.7) and ascorbate peroxidase (APX, EC 1.11.1.11) were increased in B-deficient leaves. The activities of SOD and POD were decreased in B-supraoptimal plants. The results suggest that B deficiency aggravates oxidative stress through enhanced generation of ROS in mulberry plants.",M1
19925557,"The relationship between <e>stem</e> biomechanics and wood density is modified by rainfall in 32 Australian woody plant species.*Stem mechanical properties are critically linked to foliage deployment and growth strategy, yet variation in stem mechanics across species and habitats is poorly understood. *Here, we compared 32 plant species growing across four sites of contrasting rainfall and soil nutrient availability in Australia. *The modulus of elasticity (MOE) and modulus of rupture (MOR) were tightly correlated with dry sapwood density within sites, but species from low-rainfall environments had higher wood density for a given MOE and MOR compared with species growing in high-rainfall environments. The ratio of MOE to MOR was slightly lower for species at low-rainfall sites, suggesting that wood was stronger for a given elasticity. Most species had thick bark, but the mechanical contribution of bark to stem MOE was small. *Our results suggest that arid-adapted species would need to deploy more dry mass to support stems. Our results also highlight the importance of understanding how the biomechanics-wood density relationship evolves under different environmental conditions to better understand plant growth across diverse habitats.",M1
19924157,"Community shifts of soybean <e>stem</e>-associated bacteria responding to different nodulation phenotypes and N levels.The diversity of stem-associated bacteria of non-nodulated (Nod(-)), wild-type nodulated (Nod(+)) and hypernodulated (Nod(++)) soybeans were evaluated by clone library analyses of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene. Soybeans were dressed with standard nitrogen (SN) fertilization (15 kg N ha(-1)) and heavy nitrogen (HN) fertilization (615 kg N ha(-1)). The relative abundance of Alphaproteobacteria in Nod(+) soybeans (66%) was smaller than that in Nod(-) and Nod(++) soybeans (75-76%) under SN fertilization, whereas that of Gammaproteobacteria showed the opposite pattern (23% in Nod(+) and 12-16% in Nod(-) and Nod(++) soybeans). Principal coordinate analysis showed that the bacterial communities of Nod(-) and Nod(++) soybeans were more similar to each other than to that of Nod(+) soybeans under SN fertilization. HN fertilization increased the relative abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in all nodulation phenotypes (33-57%) and caused drastic shifts of the bacterial community. The clustering analyses identified a subset of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) at the species level in Alpha- and Gammaproteobacteria responding to both the nodulation phenotypes and nitrogen fertilization levels. Meanwhile, the abundance of Betaproteobacteria was relatively constant in all libraries constructed under these environmental conditions. The relative abundances of two OTUs in Alphaproteobacteria (Aurantimonas sp. and Methylobacterium sp.) were especially sensitive to nodulation phenotype and were drastically decreased under HN fertilization. These results suggested that a subpopulation of proteobacteria in soybeans is controlled in a similar manner through both the regulation systems of plant-rhizobia symbiosis and the nitrogen signaling pathway in plants.",M1
19921259,"Antiplasmodial activity and toxicity of crude extracts from alternatives parts of plants widely used for the treatment of malaria in Burkina Faso: contribution for their preservation.In order to prevent the destruction of the ecology and to sustain the flora mainly for medicinal plants, we investigated on alternative parts taken from four plants already known to display antiplasmodial activities and largely used by traditional healers in sub-Saharan Africa. The evaluated parts are bark of trunk for Zanthoxylum zanthoxyloides and leaves for Sarcocephalus latifolius instead of roots, and leaves for Combretum molle and Anogeissus leiocarpus instead of <e>stem</e> bark. The antiplasmodial activity of extracts of these plants was evaluated in vitro using the multi-resistant strain (W2) of Plasmodium falciparum. Antiproliferative activity was also assessed, using K562S human monocyte cell lines, along with calculation of the selectivity index (SI) of each extract. The highest in vitro antiplasmodial activity was found in the alkaloid extract of trunk bark from Z. zanthoxyloides and from the MeOH extract of A. leiocarpus leaves (IC(50) = 1.2 microg/mL and 4.9 microg/mL, respectively) with good selectivity index. Moderate activity was found in the MeOH extract (IC(50) = 5.7 microg/mL) and MeOH/H2O extract (IC(50) = 7.9 microg/mL) of C. molle leaves. Moderate activity was also found in the MeOH/H20 extract (IC(50) = 5.2 microg/mL) and the decoction (IC(50) = 8.2 microg/mL) from leaves of A. leiocarpus. No good activity was found with extracts from roots of S. latifolius. All extracts tested displayed low levels of cytotoxicity against K562S cells. The data generated clearly show that the trunk bark for Z. zanthoxyloides and the leaves for A. leiocarpus and C. molle could be used for the treatment of malaria instead of roots and stem bark.",M1

The present study evaluated the effects of T. arjuna bark extract on myocardial fibrosis and oxidative stress induced by chronic beta-adrenoceptor stimulation. METHODS: Aqueous extract of T. arjuna bark was evaluated at 63, 125 and 250 mg/kg given orally for antifibrotic and antioxidant effects in rats given the selective beta-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline (5 mg/kg s.c.) for 28 days. Captopril (50 mg/kg per day, given orally), an inhibitor of angiotensin-converting enzyme used as a standard cardioprotective drug, was used as a positive control. KEY FINDINGS: Isoprenaline caused fibrosis, increased oxidative stress and cardiac hypertrophy (increased heart weight : body weight ratio and cardiomyocyte diameter). The T. arjuna bark extract and captopril significantly prevented the isoprenaline-induced increase in oxidative stress and decline in endogenous antioxidant level. Both also prevented fibrosis but not the increase in heart weight : body weight ratio. CONCLUSIONS: T. arjuna protects against myocardial changes induced by chronic beta-adrenoceptor stimulation.",M1
19898596,"[Cytotoxic effect of physalis peruviana in cell culture of colorectal and prostate cancer and chronic myeloid leukemia]INTRODUCTION: The plants have been used as drugs for centuries. However, limited research has been done on its great potential as sources of new therapeutic agents. The purpose of this study was to evaluate Physalis peruviana cytotoxic activity on cell lines HT-29, PC-3, K-562 and VERO. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The HT-29 cell lines, PC-3, K-562 and VERO, were exposed to four concentrations of P. peruviana ethanolic leave and <e>stem</e> extracts, also at different concentrations of cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), which were used as positive controls. We found rates of growth within 48 hours, then we determined the inhibitory concentration 50 (IC50) using linear regression analysis and the index of selectivity of each sample. RESULTS: The P. peruviana ethanolic leave and stem extracts showed cytotoxic activity. The IC50 in g/mL in leaves and stems were, 0.35 (r =-0.95 p &lt;0.025) and 0.37 (r =- 0.90 p &lt;0.05 ) for HT-29; 0.87 (r =-0.98 p &lt;0.01) and 1.01 (r =-0.95 p &lt;0.025) for PC-3; 0.02 (r =-0.98 p &lt;0.01) and 0.03 (r =-0.98 p &lt;0.01) for K-562; 4.9 (r =-0.95 p &lt;0.025) and 6.2 (r =-0.98 p &lt;0.01) for VERO. The IC50 for antineoplastic were: for cisplatin: 4.2 (r =-0.96 p &lt;0.025), 10.3 (r =-0.97 p &lt;0.025), 0.15 (r =-0.98 p = 0.01) and 1.1 (r =- 0.98 p = 0.01); for 5-FU: 2.3 (r =-0.97 p &lt;0.025), 17.9 (r =-0.95 p &lt;0.025), 0.15 (r =-0.98 p = 0.01) and 1.1 (r =-0.94 p = 0.05) for HT-29, PC-3, K562 and VERO respectively. The leaves and stems extracts selectivity index were between 5.6 and 245 for tumor cell lines evaluated, by contrast, cisplatin and 5-FU, only showed values between 0.11 and 7.3. CONCLUSIONS: The P. peruviana leaves and steams ethanolic extracts were more cytotoxic than cisplatin and 5 FU, on the lines HT-29, PC-3 and K562. Furthermore the P. peruviana cytotoxic effects were less than cisplatin and 5-FU for VERO control cells lines.",M1

19878459,"Relationships between <e>stem</e> CO(2) efflux, substrate supply, and growth in young loblolly pine trees.*We examined the relationships between stem CO(2) efflux (E(s)), diameter growth, and nonstructural carbohydrate concentration in loblolly pine trees. Carbohydrate supply was altered via stem girdling during rapid stem growth in the spring and after growth had ceased in the autumn. We hypothesized that substrate type and availability control the seasonal variation and temperature sensitivity of E(s). *The E(s) increased and decreased above and below the girdle, respectively, within 24 h of treatment. Seasonal variation in E(s) response to girdling corresponded to changes in stem soluble sugar and starch concentration. Relative to nongirdled trees, E(s) increased 94% above the girdle and decreased 50% below in the autumn compared with a 60% and 20% response at similar positions in the spring. *The sensitivity of E(s) to temperature decreased below the girdle in the autumn and spring and increased above the girdle but only in the autumn. Temperature-corrected E(s) was linearly related to soluble sugar (R(2) = 0.57) and starch (R(2) = 0.62) concentration. *We conclude that carbohydrate supply, primarily recently fixed photosynthate, strongly influences E(s) in Pinus taeda stems. Carbohydrate availability effects on E(s) obviate the utility of applying short-term temperature response functions across seasons.",M1

Somatic cell count (SCC), total bacterial count (TBC), phagocytic activity, and leukocyte lysosomal enzymes like myeloperoxidase and acid phosphatase activity and Interleukin-8 (IL-8) level were evaluated after intramammary infusion of hydro-methanolic extract (stem) of T.cordifolia in diseased cows. The qualitative analysis of the extract revealed the presence of polysaccharide, phenol, alkaloid, and protein. Intramammary infusion of hydro-methanolic extract of T. cordifolia treatment initially enhanced the SCC; thereafter, significant reduction in cell count (P &lt; 0.05) was observed on day 15 of the treatment period, however, reduction in TBC was observed from day 3 onwards. The phagocytic activity of milk polymorphonuclear cells enhanced in the diseased cows treated with the T. cordifolia extract. Similarly, the lysosomal enzyme content of the milk polymorphonuclear cells enhanced significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in diseased cows treated with T. cordifolia. The IL-8 level in milk serum also increased significantly (P &lt; 0.05) in diseased cows treated with the herb extract. The results suggest that the hydro-methanolic extract of T.cordifolia (stem) possesses antibacterial and immunomodulatory properties. In the present study, the biological activity of the Tinospora cordifolia extract at standardized dose against bovine subclinical mastitis is reported for the first time.

19864268,"Size-dependent leaf area ratio in plant twigs: implication for leaf size optimization.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Although many hypotheses have been proposed to explain variation in leaf size, the mechanism underlying the variation remains not fully understood. To help understand leaf size variation, the cost/benefit of twig size was analysed, since, according to Corner's rule, twig size is positively correlated with the size of appendages the twig bears. METHODS: An extensive survey of twig functional traits, including twig (current-year shoots including one <e>stem</e> and few leaves) and leaf size (individual leaf area and mass), was conducted for 234 species from four broadleaved forests. The scaling relationship between twig mass and leaf area was determined using standardized major axis regression and phylogenetic independent comparative analyses. KEY RESULTS: Leaf area was found to scale positively and allometrically with both stem and twig mass (stem mass plus leaf mass) with slopes significantly smaller than 1.0, independent of life form and habitat type. Thus, the leaf area ratio (the ratio of total leaf area to stem or twig mass) decreases with increasing twig size. Moreover, the leaf area ratio correlated negatively with individual leaf mass. The results of phylogenetic independent comparativeanalyses were consistent with the correlations. Based on the above results, a simple model for twig size optimization was constructed, from which it is postulated that large leaf size-twig size may be favoured when leaf photosynthetic capacity is high and/or when leaf life span and/or stem longevity are long. The model's predictions are consistent with leaf size variation among habitats, in which leaf size tends to be small in poor habitats with a low primary productivity. The model also explains large variations in leaf size within habitats for which leaf longevity and stem longevity serve as important determinants. CONCLUSIONS: The diminishing returns in the scaling of total leaf area with twig size can be explained in terms of a very simple model on twig siz",M1

We investigated the effects of inoculating (with stem nodule treatment) and non-inoculating (without stem nodule treatment) Azorhizobium caulinodans on the growth, root nodulation, and N fixation of S. rostrata grown on three different types of soil substrata: Pb/Zn tailings, garden soil amended tailings, and garden soil. The results showed that plant height, stem basal diameter, biomass, chlorophyll content, nitrogen content and N-accumulation per plant were 2.3%-4.9%, 2.2%-7.7%, 27.8%-72.2%, 17.1%-23.5%, 12.3%-34.2%, and 43.1%-131.2%, respectively, higher in treatments with stem nodule than those without stem nodule for the same soil substrate. With respect to soil substrata, all measurements had consistently higher values in tailings than in amended tailings and garden soil, indicating that the poorer the soil condition, the greater the contribution of stem nodule. In contrast, the number and fresh weight of root nodules on plants without stem nodule were 6.9-11.6 times and 5.8-29.0 times higher than those with stem nodule, respectively, especially with respect to the plants grew on Pb/Zn tailings. In general, stem nodulation favored plant growth and nitrogen fixation of S. rostrata, but suppressed root nodulation. With the ability of stem and root nodulation, S. rostrata can be used as a pioneer plant species for remediation of Pb/Zn tailings.",M1

METHODOLOGY: The antimicrobial activities of plant extracts were evaluated against clinically proved beta-lactam-resistant bacteria (Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Enterobacter cloacae, Serratia marcescens, Acinetobacter baumannii, Staphylococcus aureus and Enterococcus sp.) and reference strains of bacteria (Escherichia coli ATCC 35218, Enterobacter aerogenes ATCC 29751, E. aerogenes ATCC 13048, Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 and Enterococcus hirae ATCC 9790) by using disc-diffusion and agar-dilution assays. RESULTS: The crude plant extracts demonstrated broad spectrum activity against all bacteria tested with inhibition zones in the range of 8-30 mm. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) values of different plant extracts against the tested bacteria were found to range from &lt;or= 0.3 to &gt;or= 10 mg ml(-1). The most active plant extracts were from Dortenia picta and Bridelia micrantha (MIC: 1.25-10 mg ml(-1)) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative bacilli and the extracts from B. micrantha, Mallotus oppositifolius, Garcinia lucida, Garcinia. kola, Campylospermum densiflorum (leaves) and C. zenkeri (root) on beta-lactam-resistant Gram-positive cocci (MIC: &lt;or= 0.3-5 mg ml(-1)).

Their structures were determined to be 3''-hydroxy-2',2'-dimethylpyrano[6',5':3,4]-2'',2''-dimethyldihydropyrano[6'',5'':9,10]pterocarpan (1), furano[5',4':3,4]-9-hydroxy-10-prenylpterocarpan (2), and 8-formyl-3,9-dihydroxy-4,10-diprenylpterocarpan (3), based on spectroscopic analyses. All the isolates, with the exception of 3, 6, and 11, strongly inhibited protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) activity in an in vitro assay, with IC(50) values ranging from 1.01+/-0.3 to 18.1+/-0.9 microg/mL. This is the first report showing the potential of prenylated pterocarpans as a class of natural PTP1B inhibitors.",M1

Mill.].Opuntia ficus-indica cladodes represent the green <e>stem</e> of the plant and are generally used as animal feed or disposed of in landfills. The present work investigated the anatomical and chemical composition of Opuntia cladodes, which form the basis of their pharmacological effects. Glucose and galacturonic acid were the main sugars of Opuntia cladodes, whereas high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis showed the presence of mainly kaempherol and isorhamnetin glycosides (glucoside and rhamnoside). The presence of high amounts of calcium oxalate crystals was demonstrated by light microscopy on fresh and lyophilized cladodes. No antimicrobial activity was observed even after enzymatic treatment. O. ficus-indica cladodes may retain material tightly associated with cell-wall components, and this property will have the potential to greatly reduce the bioavailability of bioactive compounds.",M1
19825666,"Xyloglucan for generating tensile stress to bend tree <e>stem</e>.In response to environmental variation, angiosperm trees bend their stems by forming tension wood, which consists of a cellulose-rich G (gelatinous)-layer in the walls of fiber cells and generates abnormal tensile stress in the secondary xylem. We produced transgenic poplar plants overexpressing several endoglycanases to reduce each specific polysaccharide in the cell wall, as the secondary xylem consists of primary and secondary wall layers. When placed horizontally, the basal regions of stems of transgenic poplars overexpressing xyloglucanase alone could not bend upward due to low strain in the tension side of the xylem. In the wild-type plants, xyloglucan was found in the inner surface of G-layers during multiple layering. In situ xyloglucan endotransglucosylase (XET) activity showed that the incorporation of whole xyloglucan, potentially for wall tightening, began at the inner surface layers S1 and S2 and was retained throughout G-layer development, while the incorporation of xyloglucan heptasaccharide (XXXG) for wall loosening occurred in the primary wall of the expanding zone. We propose that the xyloglucan network is reinforced by XET to form a further connection between wall-bound and secreted xyloglucans in order to withstand the tensile stress created within the cellulose G-layer microfibrils.",M1

In higher plants, stem cells found in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and the root apical meristem (RAM) are origins of organogenesis occurring post-embryonically. It is important to understand how the regulation of stem cell fate is coordinated to enable the meristem to constantly generate different types of lateral organs. Much knowledge has accumulated on specific transcription factors controlling SAM and RAM activity. Here, we review recent evidences for a role of chromatin remodeling in the maintenance of stable expression states of transcription factor genes and the control of stem cell activity in Arabidopsis.",M1
19821052,"Identification of genes involved in <e>stem</e> rust resistance from wheat mutant D51 with the cDNA-AFLP technique.Wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) stem rust caused by Puccinia graminis f. sp. tritici is one of the main diseases of wheat worldwide. Wheat mutant line D51, which was derived from the highly susceptible cultivar L6239, shows resistance to the prevailing races 21C3CPH, 21C3CKH, and 21C3CTR of P. graminis f. sp. tritici in China. In this study, we used the cDNA-AFLP technology to identify the genes that are likely involved in the stem rust resistance. EcoRI/MseI selective primers were used to generate approximately 1920 DNA fragments. Seventy five differentially transcribed fragments (3.91%) were identified by comparing the samples of 21C3CPH infected D51 with infected L6239 or uninfected D51. Eleven amplified cDNA fragments were sequenced. Eight showed significant similarity to known genes, including TaLr1 (leaf rust resistance gene), wlm24 (wheat powdery mildew resistance gene), stress response genes and ESTs of environment stress of tall fescue. These identified genes are involved in plant defense response and stem rust resistance and need further research to determine their usefulness in breeding new resistance cultivars.",M1
19820948,"Expression of isopentenyl transferase gene (ipt) in leaf and <e>stem</e> delayed leaf senescence without affecting root growth.A cytokinin biosynthetic gene encoding isopentenyl transferase (ipt) was cloned with its native promoter from Agrobacterium tumefaciens and introduced into tobacco plants. Indolebutyric acid was applied in rooting medium and morphologically normal transgenic tobacco plants were regenerated. Genetic analysis of self-fertilized progeny showed that a single copy of intact ipt gene had been integrated, and T(2) progeny had become homozygous for the transgene. Stable inheritance of the intact ipt gene in T(2) progeny was verified by Southern hybridization. Northern blot hybridization revealed that the expression of this ipt gene was confined in leaves and stems but undetectable in roots of the transgenic plants. Endogenous cytokinin levels in the leaves and stems of the transgenic tobaccos were two to threefold higher than that of control, but in roots, both the transgenic and control tobaccos had similar cytokinin levels. The elevated cytokinin levels in the transgenic tobacco leaves resulted in delayed leaf senescence in terms of chlorophyll content without affecting the net photosynthetic rate. The root growth and morphology of the plant were not affected in the transgenic tobacco.",M1

19808707,"Cloning and expression analysis of 14 lipid transfer protein genes from Tamarix hispida responding to different abiotic stresses.Plant lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) are ubiquitous lipid-binding proteins that are involved in various stress responses. In this study, we cloned 14 unique LTP genes (ThLTP 1-14) from Tamarix hispida Willd. (Tamaricaceae) to investigate their roles under various abiotic stress conditions. The expression profiles of the 14 ThLTPs in response to NaCl, polyethylene glycol (PEG), NaHCO(3), CdCl(2) and abscisic acid (ABA) exposure in root, <e>stem</e> and leaf tissues were investigated using real-time RT-PCR. The results showed that all 14 ThLTPs were expressed in root, stem and leaf tissues under normal growth conditions. However, under normal growth conditions, ThLTP abundance varied in each organ, with expression differences of 9000-fold in leaves, 540-fold in stems and 3700-fold in roots. These results indicated that activity and/or physiological importance of these ThLTPs are quite different. Differential expression of the 14 ThLTPs was observed (&gt; 2-fold) for NaCl, PEG, NaHCO(3) and CdCl(2) in at least one tissue indicating that they were all involved in abiotic stress responses. All ThLTP genes were highly induced (&gt; 2-fold) under ABA treatment in roots, stems and/or leaves, and particularly in roots, suggesting that ABA-dependent signaling pathways regulated ThLTPs. We hypothesize that ThLTP expression constitutes an adaptive response to abiotic stresses in T. hispida and plays an important role in abiotic stress tolerance.",M1

19801848,"Costunolide-induced apoptosis in human leukemia cells: involvement of c-jun N-terminal kinase activation.The authors previously reported that costunolide, an active compound isolated from the <e>stem</e> bark of Magnolia sieboldii, induced apoptosis via reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Bcl-2-dependent mitochondrial permeability transition in human leukemia cells. In the present study, the authors investigated whether mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are involved in the costunolide-induced apoptosis in human promonocytic leukemia U937 cells. Treatment with costunolide resulted in the significant activation of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), but not of extracellular-signal-related kinase (ERK1/2) or p38. In vitro kinase assays showed that JNK activity was low in untreated cells but increased dramatically after 30 min of costunolide treatment. U937 cells co-treated with costunolide and sorbitol, a JNK activator, exhibited higher levels of cell death. In addition, inhibition of the JNK pathway using a dominant-negative mutation of c-jun and JNK inhibitor SP600125, significantly prevented costunolide-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, pretreatment with the antioxidant NAC (N-acetyl-L-cysteine) blocked the costunolide-stimulated activation of JNK while the overexpression of Bcl-2 failed to reverse JNK activation. Pretreatment with SP600125 recovered the costunolide-suppressed Bcl-2 expression. These results indicate that costunolide-induced JNK activation acts downstream of ROS but upstream of Bcl-2, and suggest that ROS-mediated JNK activation plays a key role in costunolide-induced apoptosis. Moreover, the administration of costunolide (intraperitoneally once a day for 7 d) significantly suppressed tumor growth and increased survival in 3LL Lewis lung carcinoma-bearing model.",M1
19787403,"Lavender as a source of novel plant compounds for the development of a natural herbicide.In a previous study, lavender (Lavandula spp.) was found to be highly phytotoxic towards annual ryegrass (Lolium rigidum, ARG), a major weed of winter wheat crops in Australia. This research aimed to further explore this relationship and determine the chemical(s) responsible for the observed effect. In bioassay, it was determined that the <e>stem</e> and leaf extract of L. x intermedia cv. Grosso ranked highest and had the potential to reduce significantly the root growth of several plant species. An extract concentration of 10% almost completely inhibited ARG root growth. When the extract was tested for stability, there was no loss in phytotoxicity after the 256 day trial. Via bioassay-guided fractionation and chromatographic techniques, it was determined that the sub-fraction consisting of coumarin and 7-methoxycoumarin was most phytotoxic towards ARG. Chemoassays of 18 structural analogues of coumarin showed that coumarin itself was the most phytotoxic and largely responsible for the observed phytotoxicity of the extract. Soil trials were conducted using pure coumarin and the lavender extract, and in both instances, shoot length and weight were significantly reduced by post-emergence application at all concentrations evaluated.",M1
19782675,"A diverse and intricate signalling network regulates <e>stem</e> cell fate in the shoot apical meristem.At the shoot apex of plants is a small region known as the shoot apical meristem (SAM) that maintains a population of undifferentiated (stem) cells whilst providing cells for developing lateral organs and the stem. All aerial structures of the plant develop from the SAM post-embryogenesis, enabling plants to grow in a characteristic modular fashion with great phenotypic and developmental plasticity throughout their lifetime. The maintenance of the stem cell population is intimately balanced with cell recruitment into differentiating tissues through intercellular communication involving a complex signalling network. Recent studies have shown that diverse regulators function in SAM maintenance, many of which converge on the WUSCHEL (WUS) gene. In this review the diverse regulatory modules that function in SAM maintenance are discussed: transcriptional and epigenetic control, hormonal regulation, and the balance with organogenesis. The central role of WUS as an integrator of multiple signals is highlighted; in addition, accessory feedback loops emerge as a feature enabling dynamic regulation of the stem cell niche.",M1
19773338,"Interpretation of <e>stem</e> CO2 efflux measurements.It is known that stem CO2 efflux differs somewhat both temporally and spatially from actual stem respiration, but relations between these two are not fully understood. A physical model of CO2 diffusion and advection by xylem sap flow is developed to interpret the CO2 flux signal from the stem. Model predictions are compared against measured CO2 efflux data from a field-grown 16-m Pinus sylvestris L. tree. The ratio of CO2 efflux to CO2 production is predicted to be much larger in the upper part of the tree than in the lower part as the xylem sap carries the respired CO2 upwards. The model also predicts the temperature dependency of real respiration to be higher than that of the CO2 efflux due to the slowness of diffusion. The relation between stem respiration and CO2 efflux depends strongly on the sap flow rate, radial diffusion resistance and stem geometry and size. The model may be used to scale individual CO2 efflux measurements to evaluate the respiration rate of whole trees and forests.",M1
19771836,"[Study on propagation technology of Acanthopanax trifoliatus by cuttings]OBJECTIVE: In order to obtain substantial clonal plants, we studied the cuttings propagation technology. METHODS: The cutting roots and <e>stems</e> of Acanthopanax trifoliatus were used as plant materials, and different materias, seasons and other conditions for cutting propagation were tested. RESULTS: It showed that the survival rate of stem segments was higher than that of root segments. The test of age of plant materials found that high survival rate could be obtained from semi-lignified stem segments and the segments from the base stem could survive successfully. Autumn was more suitable for plants' survival. Moreover, the rooting rate reached 89.4% by inserting segments with leaves into sand soil after dipping into 1500 mg/L IBA for 10 s, and with plastic membrane and shading net covered. CONCLUSION: The rooting rate can increase significantly by collecting semi-lignified basal stems in autumn, cutting them for leaf cuttings, and inserting them into sand soil after dipping into 1500 mg/L IBA for 10 s.",M1

19767605,"<e>Stem</e> growth habit affects leaf morphology and gas exchange traits in soybean.BACKGROUNDS AND AIMS: The stem growth habit, determinate or indeterminate, of soybean, Glycine max, varieties affects various plant morphological and developmental traits. The objective of this study is to identify the effect of stem growth habit in soybean on the stomatal conductance of single leaves in relation to their leaf morphology in order to better understand the ecological and agronomic significance of this plant trait. METHODS: The stomatal conductance of leaves on the main stem was measured periodically under favourable field conditions to evaluate g(max), defined as the maximum stomatal conductance at full leaf expansion, for four varieties of soybean and their respective determinate or indeterminate near isogenic lines (NILs). Leaf morphological traits including stomatal density, guard cell length and vein density were also measured. KEY RESULTS: The value of g(max) ranged from 0.383 to 0.754 mol H(2)O m(-2) s(-1) across all the genotypes for both years. For the four pairs of varieties, the indeterminate lines exhibited significantly greater g(max), stomatal density, numbers of epidermal cells per unit area and total vein length per unit area than their respective determinate NILs in both years. The guard cell length, leaf mass per area and single leaf size all tended to be greater in the determinate types. The variation of g(max) across genotypes and years was well explained by the product of stomatal density and guard cell length (r = 0.86, P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: The indeterminate stem growth habit resulted in a greater maximum stomatal conductance for soybean than the determinate habit, and this was attributed to the differences in leaf structure. This raises the further hypothesis that the difference in stem growth habit results in different water use characteristics of soybean plants in the field. Stomatal conductance under favourable conditions can be modified by leaf morphological traits.",M1
19765658,"Trichoderma species form endophytic associations within Theobroma cacao trichomes.Trichoderma species are usually considered soil organisms that colonize plant roots, sometimes forming a symbiotic relationship. Recent studies demonstrate that Trichoderma species are also capable of colonizing the above ground tissues of Theobroma cacao (cacao) in what has been characterized as an endophytic relationship. Trichoderma species can be re-isolated from surface sterilized cacao <e>stem</e> tissue, including the bark and xylem, the apical meristem, and to a lesser degree from leaves. SEM analysis of cacao stems colonized by strains of four Trichoderma species (Trichoderma ovalisporum-DIS 70a, Trichoderma hamatum-DIS 219b, Trichoderma koningiopsis-DIS 172ai, or Trichoderma harzianum-DIS 219f) showed a preference for surface colonization of glandular trichomes versus non-glandular trichomes. The Trichoderma strains colonized the glandular trichome tips and formed swellings resembling appresoria. Hyphae were observed emerging from the glandular trichomes on surface sterilized stems from cacao seedlings that had been inoculated with each of the four Trichoderma strains. Fungal hyphae were observed under the microscope emerging from the trichomes as soon as 6h after their isolation from surface sterilized cacao seedling stems. Hyphae were also observed, in some cases, emerging from stalk cells opposite the trichome head. Repeated single trichome/hyphae isolations verified that the emerging hyphae were the Trichoderma strains with which the cacao seedlings had been inoculated. Strains of four Trichoderma species were able to enter glandular trichomes during the colonization of cacao stems where they survived surface sterilization and could be re-isolated. The penetration of cacao trichomes may provide the entry point for Trichoderma species into the cacao stem allowing systemic colonization of this tissue.",M1
19764107,"Beneficiary effect of Tinospora cordifolia against high-fructose diet induced abnormalities in carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in Wistar rats.High intake of dietary fructose has been shown to exert a number of adverse metabolic eff ects in humans and experimental animals. The present study was designed to investigate the eff ect of the aqueous extract of Tinospora cordifolia <e>stem</e> (TCAE) on the adverse eff ects of fructose loading toward carbohydrate and lipid metabolism in rats. Adult male Wistar rats of body weight around 200 g were divided into four groups, two of which were fed with starch diet and the other two with high fructose (66 %) diet. Plant extract of TC (400 mg/kg/day) was administered orally to each group of the starch fed rats and the highfructose fed rats. At the end of 60 days of experimental period, biochemical parameters related to carbohydrate and lipid metabolism were assayed. Hyperglycemia, hyperinsulinemia, hypertriglyceridemia, insulin resistance, and elevated levels of hepatic total lipids, cholesterol, triglycerides, and free fatty acids (p &lt; 0.05) observed in fructose-fed rats were completely prevented with TCAE treatment. Alterations in the activities of enzymes of glucose metabolism (hexokinase, phosphofructokinase, pyruvate kinase, glucose-6-phosphatase, fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase, and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase) and lipid metabolism (fatty acid synthetase, lipoprotein lipase, and malic enzyme) as observed in the high fructose-fed rats were prevented with TCAE administration. In conclusion, our fi ndings indicate improvement of glucose and lipid metabolism in high-fructose fed rats by treatment with Tinospora cordifolia, and suggest that the plant can be used as an adjuvant for the prevention and/or management of insulin resistance and disorders related to it.",M1

Ex Hiern) <e>stem</e> in male rat liver and kidney.The mode of cellular toxicity of aqueous extract of Fadogia agrestis stem in male rats was investigated. Rats were grouped into four: A, B, C and D where A (the control) received orally 1 mL of distilled water; B, C and D (test groups) received orally 18, 50 and 100 mg/kg body weight of the extract, respectively, for 28 days. Infrared spectroscopy indicated the presence of hydroxyl (OH) and primary amine (CONH). Clinical toxicity symptoms such as respiratory distress, epistasis, salivation, hypo- and hyperactivity were not observed at any period of the experiment. No mortality was also recorded. Extract administration significantly reduced (p &lt; .05) the activities of alkaline phosphatase, lactate dehydrogenase and gamma glutamyl transferase in the liver and kidney with corresponding increases in the serum. Serum malondialdehyde also increased significantly in all the extract-treated groups. The liver and kidney body weight ratios of the extract-treated animals compared well (P &gt; .05) with their controls throughout the experimental period. The extract did not cause any swelling, atrophy or hypertrophy of the organs. The other evidence in this study suggests disruption of the ordered lipid bilayer of the plasma membranes of the hepatocytes and nephrons. This might have resulted from peroxidation of the polyunsaturated fatty acids on the membranes of the hepatocytes and nephrons made possible by the functional groups or the product of metabolism of the extract. This may be responsible for the compromise of the integrity of the plasma membranes of the hepatocytes and nephrons.",M1
19754704,"The rise and evolution of the cambial variant in Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae).Cambial variants represent a form of secondary growth that creates great <e>stem</e> anatomical diversity in lianas. Despite the importance of cambial variants, nothing is known about the developmental mechanisms that may have led to the current diversity seen in these stems. Here, a thorough anatomical analysis of all genera along the phylogeny of Bignonieae (Bignoniaceae) was carried out in order to detect when in their ontogeny and phylogeny there were shifts leading to different stem anatomical patterns. We found that all species depart from a common developmental basis, with a continuous, regularly growing cambium. Initial development is then followed by the modification of four equidistant portions of the cambium that reduce the production of xylem and increase the production of phloem, the former with much larger sieve tubes and an extended lifespan. In most species, the formerly continuous cambium becomes disjunct, with cambial portions within phloem wedges and cambial portions between them. Other anatomical modifications such as the formation of multiples of four phloem wedges, multiple-dissected phloem wedges, and included phloem wedges take place thereafter. The fact that each novel trait raised on the ontogenetic trajectory appeared in subsequently more recent ancestors on the phylogeny suggests a recapitulatory history. This recapitulation is, however, caused by the terminal addition of evolutionary novelties rather than a truly heterochronic process. Truly heterochronic processes were only found in shrubby species, which resemble juveniles of their ancestors, as a result of a decelerated phloem formation by the variant cambia. In addition, the modular evolution of phloem and xylem in Bignonieae seems to indicate that stem anatomical modifications in this group occurred at the level of cambial initials.",M1
19754638,"<e>Stem</e>-mediated hydraulic redistribution in large roots on opposing sides of a Douglas-fir tree following localized irrigation.*Increasing evidence about hydraulic redistribution and its ecological consequences is emerging. Hydraulic redistribution results from an interplay between competing plant and soil water potential gradients. In this work, stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution was studied in a 53-year-old Douglas-fir tree during a period of drought. *Sap flux density measurements using the heat field deformation method were performed at four locations: in two large opposing roots and on two sides of the tree stem. Hydraulic redistribution was induced by localized irrigation on one of the measured roots, creating heterogeneous soil water conditions. *Stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution was detected during night-time conditions when water was redistributed from the wet side of the tree to the nonirrigated dry side. In addition to stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution, bidirectional flow in the dry root was observed, indicating radial sectoring in the xylem. *It was observed that, through stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution, Douglas-fir was unable to increase its transpiration despite the fact that sufficient water was available to one part of the root system. This resulted from the strong water potential gradient created by the dry soil in contact with the nonirrigated part of the root system. A mechanism of stem-mediated hydraulic redistribution is proposed and its possible implications are discussed.",M1

The specimen was a metallic replica of the biological structure comprising Pt nanoparticles 2-3 nm in diameter, with a high stability under electron beam radiation. The 3D dataset was processed by an automated deconvolution procedure. The lateral resolution was 1.1 nm, set by pixel size. Particles differing by only 10 nm in vertical position were identified as separate objects with greater than 20% dip in contrast between them. We refer to this value as the axial resolution of the deconvolution or reconstruction, the ability to recognize two objects, which were unresolved in the original dataset. The resolution of the reconstruction is comparable to that achieved by tilt-series transmission electron microscopy. However, the focal-series method does not require mechanical tilting and is therefore much faster. 3D STEM images were also recorded of the Golgi ribbon in conventional thin sections containing 3T3 cells with a comparable axial resolution in the deconvolved dataset.",M2

Wet-STEM images were obtained of fixed E. coli bacteria labeled with gold nanoparticles attached to surface membrane proteins. Mammalian cells (COS7) were incubated with gold-tagged epidermal growth factor and fixed. STEM imaging of these cells resulted in a resolution of 3 nm for the gold nanoparticles. The wet-STEM method has several advantages over conventional imaging techniques. Most important is the capability to image whole fixed cells in a wet environment with nanometer resolution, which can be used, e.g., to map individual protein distributions in/on whole cells. The sample preparation is compatible with that used for fluorescent microscopy on fixed cells for experiments involving nanoparticles.

To demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology, the surface diffusivity is determined from measurements obtained from STEM images acquired during the initial stages of sintering. The measured surface diffusivities are in reasonable agreement with measurements made on the surface of nanoparticles, using other techniques. In addition, the grain boundary mobility is determined from measurements made during the latter stages of sintering.",M2
19941557,"Specimen thickness dependence of hydrogen evolution during cryo-transmission electron microscopy of hydrated soft materials.The evolution of hydrogen from many hydrated cryo-preserved soft materials under electron irradiation in the transmission electron microscope can be observed at doses of the order of 1000 e nm(-2) and above. Such hydrogen causes artefacts in conventional transmission electron microscope or scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) imaging as well as in analyses by electron energy-loss spectroscopy. Here we show that the evolution of hydrogen depends on specimen thickness. Using wedge-shaped specimens of frozen-hydrated Nafion, a perfluorinated ionomer, saturated with the organic solvent DMMP together with both thin and thick sections of frozen-hydrated porcine skin, we show that there is a thickness below which hydrogen evolution is not detected either by bubble observation in transmission electron microscope image mode or by spectroscopic analysis in STEM electron energy-loss spectroscopy mode. We suggest that this effect is due to the diffusion of hydrogen, whose diffusivity remains significant even at liquid nitrogen temperature over the length scales and time scales relevant to transmission electron microscopy analysis of thin specimens. In short, we speculate that sufficient hydrogen can diffuse to the specimen surface in thin sections so that concentrations are too low for bubbling or for spectroscopic detection. Significantly, this finding indicates that higher electron doses can be used during the imaging of radiation-sensitive hydrated soft materials and, consequently, higher spatial resolution can be achieved, if sufficiently thin specimens are used in order to avoid the evolution of hydrogen-based artefacts.",M2

19904938,"Buckyballs meet viral nanoparticles: candidates for biomedicine.Fullerenes such as C(60) show promise as functional components in several emerging technologies. For biomedical applications, C(60) has been used in gene- and drug-delivery vectors, as imaging agents, and as photosensitizers in cancer therapy. A major drawback of C(60) for bioapplications is its insolubility in water. To overcome this limitation, we covalently attached C(60) derivatives to Cowpea mosaic virus and bacteriophage Qbeta virus-like particles, which are examples of naturally occurring viral nanoparticle (VNP) structures that have been shown to be promising candidates for biomedicine. Two different labeling strategies were employed, giving rise to water-soluble, stable VNP-C(60) and VNP-PEG-C(60) conjugates. Samples were characterized using a combination of transmission electron microscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>), gel electrophoresis, size-exclusion chromatography, dynamic light scattering, and Western blotting.  Click  chemistry bioconjugation using a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG)-modified propargyl-O-PEG-C(60) derivative gave rise to high loadings of fullerene on the VNP surface, as indicated by the imaging of individual C(60) units using STEM. The cellular uptake of dye-labeled VNP-PEG-C(60) complexes in a human cancer cell line was found by confocal microscopy to be robust, showing that cell internalization was not inhibited by the attached C(60) units. These results open the door for the development of novel therapeutic devices with potential applications in photoactivated tumor therapy.",M2

The identity and presence of cisplatin on the nanotubes was confirmed using energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. STEM tomography was also used to provide additional insights concerning the nanotube conjugates. Finally, our observations provide a rationale for exploring the use of SWNT bioconjugates to selectively target and kill squamous cancer cells. CONCLUSION: Z-contrast STEM imaging provides a means for direct visualization of heavy metal containing molecules (i.e., cisplatin) attached to surfaces of carbon SWNTs along with distribution and quantitation.",M2

19606856,"Tantalum clusters supported on silica-alumina: influence of support composition and chemistry on cluster structure.Small cationic tantalum clusters were prepared on the surfaces of SiO2, silica-aluminas, and gamma-Al2O3 supports by treating physisorbed pentabenzyltantalum at 523 K for 24 h in flowing H2. The rate of decomposition and the products formed in the decomposition of pentabenzyltantalum are dependent on the support composition. When the support was SiO2, the evolved products were mainly biphenyl and a small amount of toluene, indicating that the Ta-C bond in pentabenzyltantalum was activated. As the alumina content of the support increased, diphenylmethane, benzene, and ethylene were increasingly formed, and these products show that the activation of the C-C bonds linking the C atoms of methyl groups to the aromatic rings of the benzyl ligands was facilitated. Infrared spectra of the surface species and mass spectra of the effluents formed during the treatment show that the composition of the support had significant influence on the decomposition of pentabenzyltantalum, and the chemistry is inferred to be related to the electron-donor properties of the supports. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS) spectra recorded at the Ta LIII edge indicate the formation of clusters with a Ta-Ta first-shell coordination number of approximately 3, and images obtained by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) confirm the presence of such small clusters. X-ray absorption near edge structure (XANES) data indicate that the formal oxidation state of the tantalum in the clusters decreased from approximately 3.0 to approximately 2.6 as the support was changed from SiO2 to silica-aluminas to gamma-Al2O3. The data suggest that the tantalum clusters were anchored to the supports via bridging O atoms. The EXAFS data show that the support composition had little influence on the cluster structure.",M2

They are composed of a cytoplasmic secretion machinery and a base that bridges both bacterial membranes, into which a hollow, external needle is embedded. When isolated, the latter two parts are termed the 'needle complex'. An incomplete understanding of the structure of the needle complex has hampered studies of T3SS function. To estimate the stoichiometry of its components, we measured the mass of its subdomains by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>). We determined subunit symmetries by analysis of top and side views within negatively stained samples in low-dose transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Application of 12-fold symmetry allowed generation of a 21-25-A resolution, three-dimensional reconstruction of the needle complex base, revealing many new features and permitting tentative docking of the crystal structure of EscJ, an inner membrane component.",M2

Unfortunately, their extremely small size limits the feasibility of traditional methods for nanocrystal characterization. This paper reports the first images of their structure, which were obtained using aberration-corrected atomic number contrast scanning transmission electron microscopy (Z-<e>STEM</e>). With subangstrom resolution, Z-STEM is one of the few available methods that can be used to directly image the nanocrystal's structure. The initial images suggest that they are crystalline and approximately four lattice planes in diameter. In addition to the structure, for the first time, the exciton dynamics were measured at different wavelengths of the white-light spectrum using ultrafast fluorescence upconversion spectroscopy. The data suggest that a myriad of trap states are responsible for the broad-spectrum emission. It is hoped that the information presented here will provide a foundation for the future development and improvement of white-light-emitting nanocrystals.",M2

Thickness characterization was done based on measuring the effective cross-section for interaction in our sample-detector configuration using calibration particles. A simplified analytical model, taking account of BF-STEM contrast and effective cross-section for interaction, was utilized for transforming projected two-dimensional BF-STEM images into three-dimensional thickness images.

18977089,"<e>STEM</e> tomography for thick biological specimens.Scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) tomography was applied to biological specimens such as yeast cells, HEK293 cells and primary culture neurons. These cells, which were embedded in a resin, were cut into 1-microm-thick sections. STEM tomography offers several important advantages including: (1) it is effective even for thick specimens, (2) 'dynamic focusing', (3) ease of using an annular dark field (ADF) mode and (4) linear contrasts. It has become evident that STEM tomography offers significant advantages for the observation of thick specimens. By employing STEM tomography, even a 1-microm-thick specimen (which is difficult to observe by conventional transmission electron microscopy (TEM)) was successfully analyzed in three dimensions. The specimen was tilted up to 73 degrees during data acquisition. At a large tilt angle, the specimen thicknesses increase dramatically. In order to observe such thick specimens, we introduced a special small condenser aperture that reduces the collection angle of the STEM probe. The specimen damage caused by the convergent electron beam was expected to be the most serious problem; however, the damage in STEM was actually smaller than that in TEM. In this study, the irradiation damage caused by TEM- and STEM-tomography in biological specimens was quantitatively compared.",M2

A good understanding of the relationship between material thickness and spatial resolution is required, with particular emphasis on the competition between beam divergence (a geometrical effect from the converged STEM probe) and beam spreading (an unavoidable broadening due to plural elastic scattering). We show that beam divergence dominates beam spreading for typical embedding polymers beyond the 100-nm thickness range and that minimization of this effect leads to enhanced spatial resolution. The problems are more pronounced in spherical-aberration-corrected instruments where the depth of field is shorter.",M2
18615562,"Cryo-X-ray analysis-A novel tool to better understand the physicochemical reactions at the bioglass/biological fluid interface.The present study deals with the short-term physicochemical reactions at the interface between bioactive glass particles [55SiO(2)-20CaO-9P(2)O(5)-12Na(2)O-4MgO. mol%] and biological fluid (Dulbecco Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM)). The physicochemical reactions within the interface are characterized by scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM) (<e>STEM</e>) associated with Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDXS). Microanalysis of diffusible ions such as sodium, potassium, or oxygen requires a special care. In the present investigation the cryo-technique was adopted as a suitable tool for the specimen preparation and characterization. Cryosectioning is essential for preserving the native distribution of ions so that meaningful information about the local concentrations can be obtained by elemental microanalysis. The bioglass particles immersed in biological fluid for 24 h revealed five reaction stages: (i) dealkalization of the surface by cationic exchange (Na(+), Ca(2+) with H(+) or H(3)O(+)); (ii) loss of soluble silica in the form of Si(OH)(4) to the solution resulting from the breakdown of Si--O--Si bonds (iii); repolymerization of Si(OH)(4) leading to condensation of SiO(2)); (iv) migration of Ca(2+) and PO(4) (3-) to the surface through the SiO(2)-rich layer to form CaO-P(2)O(5) film; (v) crystallization of the amorphous CaO-P(2)O(5) by incorporating OH-- or CO(3) (2-) anions with the formation of three different surface layers on the bioactive glass periphery. The thickness of each layer is approximately 300 nm and from the inner part to the periphery they consist of Si--OH, which permits the diffusion of Ca(2+) and PO(4) (3-) ions and the formation of the middle Ca--P layer, and finally the outer layer composed of Na--O, which acts as an ion exchange layer between Na(+) ions and H(+) or H(3)O(+) from the solution.",M2

Quantitative analysis of the paired STEM images requires knowledge of the elastic scattering cross sections, which are calculated from the NIST elastic scattering cross section database. The results reveal quantitative information about the distribution of fixative and stain within the biological matrix, and provide a basis for assessing detection limits for heavy-metal clusters used to label intracellular proteins. In sectioned cells that have been stained only with osmium tetroxide, we find an average of 1.2+/-0.1 Os atom per nm(3), corresponding to an atomic ratio of Os:C atoms of approximately 0.02, which indicates that small heavy atom clusters of Undecagold and Nanogold can be detected in lightly stained specimens.",M2
18342743,"Reprint of  On the feasibility of visualizing ultrasmall gold labels in biological specimens by <e>STEM</e> tomography  [J. Struct. Biol. 159 (2007) 507-522].Labeling with heavy atom clusters attached to antibody fragments is an attractive technique for determining the 3D distribution of specific proteins in cells using electron tomography. However, the small size of the labels makes them very difficult to detect by conventional bright-field electron tomography. Here, we evaluate quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) at a beam voltage of 300kV for detecting 11-gold atom clusters (Undecagold) and 1.4nm-diameter nanoparticles (Nanogold) for a variety of specimens and imaging conditions. STEM images as well as tomographic tilt series are simulated by means of the NIST Elastic-Scattering Cross-Section Database for gold clusters embedded in carbon. The simulations indicate that the visibility in 2D of Undecagold clusters in a homogeneous matrix is maximized for low inner collection semi-angles of the STEM annular dark-field detector (15-20mrad). Furthermore, our calculations show that the visibility of Undecagold in 3D reconstructions is significantly higher than in 2D images for an inhomogeneous matrix corresponding to fluctuations in local density. The measurements demonstrate that it is possible to detect Nanogold particles in plastic sections of tissue freeze-substituted in the presence of osmium. STEM tomography has the potential to localize specific proteins in permeabilized cells using antibody fragments tagged with small heavy atom clusters. Our quantitative analysis provides a framework for determining the detection limits and optimal experimental conditions for localizing these small clusters.",M2

It is shown here that the three-window imaging method has less artificial intensity in elemental maps than the two-window-based method. Using the new three-window system, the dependence of spatial resolution on the energy window width was studied experimentally and also compared with TEM-based EELS.

Particle images can be sorted by shape, providing independent histograms of mass to study assembly/disassembly intermediates. STEM is optimized for low-dose imaging and is suitable for accurate measurement of particle masses over the range from about 30 kDa to 1,000 MDa. This article describes the details of the method developed at the Brookhaven National Laboratory STEM facility and illustrates its application to the mass mapping of large globin complexes.",M2

This high-resolution field-mission TEM/STEM is equipped with a Schottky field-emission gun operated at 200 kV, a CEOS probe corrector, and an in-column energy filter. We focus on the performance of the probe corrector and show that the Si [110] dumbbell structure can be routinely resolved in STEM mode with the power spectrum indicating a probe size of approximately 1 A. Ronchigram analysis suggests that the constant phase area is extended from 15 mrad to 35 mrad after corrector tuning.

18096395,"Dose-limited spectroscopic imaging of soft materials by low-loss EELS in the scanning transmission electron microscope.Spectroscopic imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (<e>STEM</e>) using spatially resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) provides one of the few ways to quantitatively measure the real-space nanoscale morphology of soft materials such as polymers and biological tissue. This paper describes the basic principles of this technique and outlines some of the important attributes that define the achievable spatial resolution. Many soft materials can be differentiated from each other as well as from solvents based on their EELS fingerprints. Applying a multiple least squares (MLS) fitting algorithm using such spectral fingerprints to analyze spatially resolved spectrum datasets enables the quantitative mapping of the different components in a specimen. However, in contrast to TEM studies of many inorganic materials where the spatial resolution is limited principally by the spherical aberration of the objective lens, the spatial resolution associated with the imaging of radiation-sensitive soft materials is limited by the total electron dose to which they can be exposed before suffering irrevocable chemical or structural damage. The Rose criterion provides a simple guide to enhance the so-called dose-limited spatial resolution relevant to soft-materials imaging. By using the low-loss portion of an EELS spectrum where the inelastic scattering cross-sections are highest together with improvements in data-collection efficiency and post-acquisition data processing, the dose-limited resolution in spectrum images of solvated polymers has moved into the sub 10nm regime. This resolution is sufficient to solve important applications-oriented problems associated with hetero interfaces, nanoscale mixing, and nanophase separation.",M2

Ca-deficient HA samples were obtained by this method with the characteristic hexagonal apatite structure. Scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) of two HA samples with two different Mn content has shown that their morphology depends on their Mn content. In case of relatively low (0.73%) Mn content (HAMn1), platelet crystals about micron size and needle-like crystals up to 100 nm were observed, while with 1.23% Mn (HAMn2) crystals were smaller, needle-like and with sizes up to 400 nm only. Mn-doped TCP samples were prepared by two methods. In one case it was obtained by direct solid-state reaction with the characteristic rhombohedral structure of beta-TCP and with composition of Ca(2.7)Mn(0.3)(PO(4))(2). TEM pictures of crystals of this sample were tens of micron and submicron size with visible faces. Crystals of beta-TCP obtained by high temperature partial transformation of sample HAMn2 to beta-TCP were found by TEM to be smaller, micron sized, drop-like shaped, sensitive to beam radiation. These results indicate that the morphology of Mn doped beta-tricalcium phosphate samples depends on the method of their preparation. Morphological properties of HA and TCP are discussed and it is suggested that the smaller and less perfect HA crystals with the higher Mn-content as well as the less perfect TCP crystals obtained by transformation of HA to TCP might be of more biocompatible character.",M2

Nevertheless, STEM mass mapping has been implemented in very few laboratories, most of which have employed cold field-emission gun (FEG) electron sources operating at acceleration voltages of 100 kV and lower. Here we show that a 300 kV commercial transmission electron microscope (TEM) equipped with a thermally assisted Shottky FEG can also provide accurate STEM mass measurements. Using the recently published database of elastic-scattering cross sections from the National Institute of Standards and Technology, we show that the measured absolute mass values for tobacco mosaic virus and limpet hemocyanin didecamers agree with the known values to within better than 10%. Applying the established approach, whereby tobacco mosaic virus is added to a specimen as a calibration standard, we find that the measured molecular weight of the hemocyanin assemblies agrees with the known value to within 3%. This accuracy is achievable although only a very small fraction ( approximately 0.002) of the incident probe current of 300 kV electrons is scattered onto the annular dark-field STEM detector. FEG TEMs operating at intermediate voltages (200-400 kV) are becoming common tools for determining the structure of frozen hydrated protein assemblies. The ability to perform mass determination with the same instrument can provide important complementary information about the numbers of subunits comprising the protein assemblies whose structure is being studied.",M2

In its prion form, the HET-s protein of Podospora anserina participates in a fungal self/non-self recognition phenomenon called heterokaryon incompatibility. Like other prion proteins, HET-s has a so-called  prion domain  (its C-terminal region, HET-s-(218-289)) that is responsible for induction and propagation of the prion in vivo and for fibril formation in vitro. Prion fibrils are thought to have amyloid backbones of polymerized prion domains. A relatively detailed model has been proposed for prion domain fibrils of HET-s based on a variety of experimental constraints (Ritter, C., Maddelein, M. L., Siemer, A.

Previous studies of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus and Nitrobacter agilis carboxysomes suggest that the structures are either icosahedral or dodecahedral. To determine the protein shell structure more definitively, purified H. neapolitanus carboxysomes were re-examined by cryo-electron tomography and scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>). Due to the limited tilt angles in the electron microscope, the tomographic reconstructions are distorted. Corrections were made in the 3D orientation searching and averaging of the computationally extracted carboxysomes to minimize the missing data effects.

The STEM mode exhibited the advantage that the induced energy loss and charge build-up in the sample affected the image to a lesser extent than in the TEM or SEM mode. Furthermore, the efficiency of an STEM detector is high, and the total radiation damage can be reduced if thermal damage due to localized heating at a slow scan operation can be overcome. We applied this method for observations of biological samples that were in the form of thin slices, fine fibers and small particles.

Here we applied scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) and limited proteolysis to probe the mass distribution of PHFs and their surface exposure. Tau filaments assembled from the three repeat domain have a mass per length (MPL) of approximately 60 kDa/nm and filaments from full-length tau (htau40DeltaK280 mutant) have approximately 160 kDa/nm, compared with approximately 130 kDa/nm for PHFs from Alzheimer's brain. Polyanionic cofactors such as heparin accelerate assembly but are not incorporated into PHFs. Limited proteolysis combined with N-terminal sequencing and mass spectrometry of fragments reveals a protease-sensitive N-terminal half and semiresistant PHF core starting in the first repeat and reaching to the C-terminus of tau. Continued proteolysis leads to a fragment starting at the end of the first repeat and ending in the fourth repeat. PHFs from tau isoforms with four repeats revealed an additional cleavage site within the middle of the second repeat. Probing the PHFs with antibodies detecting epitopes either over longer stretches in the C-terminal half of tau or in the fourth repeat revealed that they grow in a polar manner.

Poly(2-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate) (PDEAEMA) was covalently grafted onto the surfaces of MWNTs by MWNT-initiated in situ atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) of 2-diethylaminoethyl methacrylate (DEAEMA). The PDEAEMA-grafted MWNTs were quaternized with methyl iodide (CH(3)I), resulting in cationic polyelectrolyte-grafted MWNTs (MWNT-PAmI). Magnetic iron oxide (Fe(3)O(4)) nanoparticles were loaded onto the MWNT surfaces by electrostatic self-assembling between MWNT-PAmI and Fe(3)O(4), affording magnetic nanotubes. The assembled capability of the nanoparticles can be adjusted to some extent by changing the feed ratio of Fe(3)O(4) to MWNT-PAmI. The obtained magnetic nanotubes were characterized with TEM, EDS, <e>STEM</e>, and element mapping analyses. TEM and EDS measurements confirmed the nanostructures and the components of the resulting nanoobjects. The magnetic nanotubes were assembled onto sheep red blood cells in a phosphate buffer solution, forming magnetic cells. The blood cells attached with or without magnetic nanotubes can be selectively manipulated in a magnetic field. These results promise a general and efficient strategy to magnetic nanotubes and the fascinating potential of such magnetic nanoobjects in applications of bionanoscience and technology.",M2
16112807,"Water mapping in hydrated soft materials.We present a method based on spatially resolved electron energy-loss spectroscopy in the cryo-<e>STEM</e> to map the spatial distribution of water in frozen-hydrated polymers. The spatial resolution is limited by the dose constraints imposed by radiation damage, and to stay within these constraints, the use of fine electron-probe sizes comes at the cost of reduced counts in the energy-loss spectra. Thus, at the resolution limit, the detection of isolated water-rich pixels or the identification of minor variations in water content across the specimen is complicated because one must distinguish significant fluctuations from noise. Here we develop a criterion with which to guide such a distinction. We characterize the intrinsic noise associated with spectral measurements under given illumination and acquisition conditions. We then use that noise in combination with scatter diagrams to threshold spectrum images and objectively identify statistically significant compositional fluctuations. We illustrate these ideas using a simulated spectrum dataset for a hypothetical blend of hydrophilic and hydrophobic homopolymers. We show that while a direct inspection of the water map may not allow any meaningful conclusions to be drawn, after applying the thresholding approach we can clearly identify the regions of the specimen that are rich in water. We also experimentally study a model blend system comprised of hydrophilic poly(vinyl pyrrolidone) (PVP) dispersed in a hydrophobic matrix of poly(styrene) (PS). By MLS fitting using damaged and undamaged PVP reference spectra, we determine that the critical dose characteristic of dry PVP is approximately 8000 e/nm2 using 200 keV incident electrons. Irradiating frozen-hydrated PVP gives rise to noticeable hydrogen evolution at doses of approximately 1500 e/nm2. To stay within this constraint we use doses of 400 e/nm2 and a pixel spacing in the spectrum imaging of 100 nm. In order to quantitatively map the water, PVP, and PS compositions, we measure their total inelastic scattering cross-sections. Direct inspection of the composition maps reveals the presence of large water-rich domains of the order of approximately 1 microm and the scatter-diagram thresholding approach identifies small water-rich domains one pixel in size.",M2
16104001,"Characterization of paired helical filaments by scanning transmission electron microscopy.Paired helical filaments (PHFs) are abnormal twisted filaments composed of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. They are found in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders designated as tauopathies. They are a major component of intracellular inclusions known as neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs). The objective of this review is to summarize various structural studies of PHFs in which using scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) has been particularly informative. STEM provides shape and mass per unit length measurements important for studying ultrastructural aspects of filaments. These include quantitative comparisons between dispersed and aggregated populations of PHFs as well as comparative studies of PHFs in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. Other approaches are also discussed if relevant or complementary to studies using STEM, e.g., application of a novel staining reagent, Nanovan. Our understanding of the PHF structure and the development of PHFs into NFTs is presented from a historical perspective. Others goals are to describe the biochemical and ultrastructural complexity of authentic PHFs, to assess similarities between authentic and synthetic PHFs, and to discuss recent advances in PHF modeling.",M2
15990230,"Wet <e>STEM</e>: a new development in environmental SEM for imaging nano-objects included in a liquid phase.Environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) enables wet samples to be observed without potentially damaging sample preparation through the use of partial water vapour pressure in the microscope specimen chamber. However, in the case of latices in colloidal state or microorganisms, samples are not only wet, but made of objects totally submerged in a liquid phase. In this case, under classical ESEM imaging conditions only the top surface of the liquid is imaged, with poor contrast, and possible drifting of objects. The present paper describes experiments using a powerful new Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (STEM) imaging system, that allows transmission observations of wet samples in an ESEM. A special device, designed to observe all sorts of objects submerged in a liquid under annular dark-field imaging conditions, is described. Specific features of the device enable to avoid drifting of floating objects which occurs in the case of a large amount of water, thus allowing slow-scan high-definition imaging of particles with a diameter down to few tens of nm. The large potential applications of this new technique are then illustrated, including the imaging of different nano-objects in water. The particular case of grafted latex particles is discussed, showing that it is possible to observe details on their surface when submerged in water. All the examples demonstrate that images acquired in wet STEM mode show particularly good resolution and contrast, without adding enhancing contrast objects, and without staining.",M2
15774720,"3D reconstruction of the Mu transposase and the Type 1 transpososome: a structural framework for Mu DNA transposition.Mu DNA transposition proceeds through a series of higher-order nucleoprotein complexes called transpososomes. The structural core of the transpososome is a tetramer of the transposase, Mu A, bound to the two transposon ends. High-resolution structural analysis of the intact transposase and the transpososome has not been successful to date. Here we report the structure of Mu A at 16-angstroms and the Type 1 transpososome at 34-angstroms resolution, by 3D reconstruction of images obtained by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) at cryo-temperatures. Electron spectroscopic imaging (ESI) of the DNA-phosphorus was performed in conjunction with the structural investigation to derive the path of the DNA through the transpososome and to define the DNA-binding surface in the transposase. Our model of the transpososome fits well with the accumulated biochemical literature for this intricate transposition system, and lays a structural foundation for biochemical function, including catalysis in trans and the complex circuit of macromolecular interactions underlying Mu DNA transposition.",M2

Irregularly shaped small Ag particles of 1-2 nm dominate the alloy annealed at 140 degrees C for 10 h. These particles are present also within large precipitates (10-50 nm), which are often characterized by their {100} and {110} facets.

Using a FIB microsampling technique, a sample with a thickness of tens of micrometres was extracted from a resin-embedded block sample. The extracted sample was transferred to a FIB-STEM-compatible specimen rotation holder and trimmed by FIB milling for 3D STEM observation. Although the FIB milling was carried out at an operating voltage of 40 KV, the sample was cross sectioned without forming a harmful damage layer on its surface. Cell structures, such as cell wall, cell membrane, mitochondria, peroxisomes, endoplasmic reticulum and vacuoles, were observed clearly in a pillar-shaped sample of 20 microm long, 4 microm wide and 3 microm deep.",M2

The key features of the micropillar fabrication are: first, microsampling to extract a small piece including the structure of interest in an IC chip, and second, an ion-beam with an incident direction of 60 degrees to the pillar's axis that enables the parallel sidewalls of the pillar to be produced with a high aspect ratio. A memory-cell structure (length: 6 microm; width: 300 x 500 nm) was fabricated in the micropillar and observed from various directions with a 3D-STEM.

Translational symmetry allows us to take only partial incident beams in the first Brillouin zone instead of enormous number of partial incident beams in a large convergent disk. Two dimensional point group confines partial incident beams to an irreducible area in addition to factoring a dispersion matrix into noninteracting submatrices on a high symmetry line using the projection operator. The drastic reductions in computing time and memory enable us to readily calculate various BF STEM and HAADF STEM images. The validity and accuracy are demonstrated in comparisons with high resolution experimental BF STEM and HAADF STEM images.",M2
15549698,"Imaging and analysis of nanowires.We used vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) methods to synthesize discrete single-element semiconductor nanowires and multicomposition nanowire heterostructures, and then characterized their structure and composition using high-resolution electron microscopy (HRTEM) and analytical electron microscopy techniques. Imaging nanowires requires the modification of the established HRTEM imaging procedures for bulk material to take into consideration the effects of finite nanowire width and thickness. We show that high-resolution atomic structure images of nanowires less than 6 nm in thickness have lattice  streaking  due to the finite crystal lattice in two dimensions of the nanowire structure. Diffraction pattern analysis of nanowires must also consider the effects of a finite structure producing a large reciprocal space function, and we demonstrate that the classically forbidden 1/3 [422] reflections are present in the [111] zone axis orientation of silicon nanowires due to the finite thickness and lattice plane edge effects that allow incomplete diffracted beam cancellation. If the operating conditions are not carefully considered, we found that HRTEM image delocalization becomes apparent when employing a field emission transmission electron microscope (TEM) to image nanowires and such effects have been shown to produce images of the silicon lattice structure outside of the nanowire itself. We show that pseudo low-dose imaging methods are effective in reducing nanowire structure degradation caused by electron beam irradiation. We also show that scanning TEM (<e>STEM</e>) with energy dispersive X-ray microanalysis (EDS) is critical in the examination of multicomponent nanowire heterostructures.",M2
15332652,"HAADF-<e>STEM</e> imaging with sub-angstrom probes: a full Bloch wave analysis.A full coherent Bloch wave calculation is presented to investigate high-angle annular dark-field image formation for sub-angstrom probes in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). With increasing illumination angle, the contribution of the 1s bound state increases to a maximum at an optimum probe angle, after which we find increasing contributions from high-angle plane wave states around the periphery of the objective aperture. Examination of image contributions from different depths within a crystal shows an oscillatory behavior due to the beating between 1s and non-1s states. The oscillation period reduces with decreasing probe size, while the relative contribution from a specific depth increases. This signifies a changeover from a projection mode of imaging to a depth-slicing mode of imaging. This new mode appears capable of resolving three-dimensional atomic structures in future generation aberration-corrected STEM.",M2
15306078,"First observation of In(x)Ga(1-x)As quantum dots in GaP by spherical-aberration-corrected HRTEM in comparison with ADF-<e>STEM</e> and conventional HRTEM.In(x)Ga(1-x)As quantum dots in GaP(100) crystals prepared by the OMVPE technique are observed along the [011] direction with a newly developed 200-kV spherical aberration(Cs)-corrected HRTEM, a 200-kV annular dark-field (ADF)-STEM, and a 200-kV conventional HRTEM equipped with a thermal field-emission gun. The dots are 6-10 nm in size and strongly strained due to the misfit of about 9% with the GaP substrate and GaP cap layer. All of the cross-sectional high-resolution electron micrographs show dumbbell images of Ga and P atomic columns separated by 0.136 nm in well-oriented and perfect GaP areas, but the interpretable images are limited to those taken with the Cs-corrected HRTEM and ADF-STEM with Fourier filtering of the images. The Cs-corrected HRTEM and ADF-STEM are comparable from the viewpoint of interpretable resolution. A detailed comparison between the Cs-corrected HRTEM images and the simulated ones with electron incidence tilted by 1 degree to 5 degrees from the [011] zone axis gives information on local lattice bending in the dots from the images around 0.1 nm resolution. This becomes one of the useful techniques newly available from electron microscopy with sub-angstrom resolution.",M2

Since then, with advances of computing power, the FFT multislice method has been successfully applied to coherent CBED and HAADF-<e>STEM</e> simulations. However, because the multislice formula is built on some physical approximations and approximations in numerical procedure, there seem to be controversial conclusions in the literature on the multislice method.

15306061,"Off-axis <e>STEM</e> or TEM holography combined with four-dimensional diffraction imaging.Ultrahigh-resolution imaging may be achieved using modifications of the off-axis holography scheme in a scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) instrument equipped with one or more electrostatic biprisms in the illuminating system. The resolution is governed by the diameter of a reference beam, reduced by channeling through a line of atoms in an atomic-focuser crystal. Alternatively, the off-axis holography may be combined with the Rodenburg method in which a four-dimensional data set is obtained by recording a nanodiffraction pattern from each point of the specimen as the incident beams are scanned. An ultrahigh-resolution image is derived by computer processing to give a particular two-dimensional section of this data set. The large amount of data recording and data processing involved with this method may be avoided if the two-dimensional section is derived by recording the hologram while the four beams produced by two perpendicular biprisms are scanned in opposing directions across the specimen by varying the voltages on the biprisms. An equivalent scheme for conventional TEM is also possible. In each case, the complex transmission function of the specimen may be derived and resolutions of about 0.05 nm may be expected.",M2
14750984,"Thin dielectric film thickness determination by advanced transmission electron microscopy.High-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) has been used as the ultimate method of thickness measurement for thin films. The appearance of phase contrast interference patterns in HR-TEM images has long been confused as the appearance of a crystal lattice by nonspecialists. Relatively easy to interpret crystal lattice images are now directly observed with the introduction of annular dark-field detectors for scanning TEM (<e>STEM</e>). With the recent development of reliable lattice image processing software that creates crystal structure images from phase contrast data, HR-TEM can also provide crystal lattice images. The resolution of both methods has been steadily improved reaching now into the sub-Angstrom region. Improvements in electron lens and image analysis software are increasing the spatial resolution of both methods. Optimum resolution for STEM requires that the probe beam be highly localized. In STEM, beam localization is enhanced by selection of the correct aperture. When STEM measurement is done using a highly localized probe beam, HR-TEM and STEM measurement of the thickness of silicon oxynitride films agree within experimental error. In this article, the optimum conditions for HR-TEM and STEM measurement are discussed along with a method for repeatable film thickness determination. The impact of sample thickness is also discussed. The key result in this article is the proposal of a reproducible method for film thickness determination.",M2
12927539,"Linker histone-dependent organization and dynamics of nucleosome entry/exit DNAs.A DNA sequence-dependent nucleosome structural and dynamic polymorphism was recently uncovered through topoisomerase I relaxation of mononucleosomes on two homologous approximately 350-370 bp DNA minicircle series, one originating from pBR322, the other from the 5S nucleosome positioning sequence. Whereas both pBR and 5S nucleosomes had access to the closed, negatively crossed conformation, only the pBR nucleosome had access to the positively crossed conformation. Simulation suggested this discrepancy was the result of a reorientation of entry/exit DNAs, itself proposed to be the consequence of specific DNA untwistings occurring in pBR nucleosome where H2B N-terminal tails pass between the two gyres. The present work investigates the behavior of the same two nucleosomes after binding of linker histone H5, its globular domain, GH5, and engineered H5 C-tail deletion mutants. Nucleosome access to the open uncrossed conformation was suppressed and, more surprisingly, the ability of 5S nucleosome to positively cross was largely restored. This, together with the paradoxical observation of a less extensive crossing in the negative conformation with GH5 than without, favored an asymmetrical location of the globular domain in interaction with the central gyre and only entry (or exit) DNA, and raised the possibility of the domain physical rotation as a mechanism assisting nucleosome fluctuation from one conformation to the other. Moreover, both negative and positive conformations showed a high degree of loop conformational flexibility in the presence of the full-length H5 C-tail, which the simulation suggested to reflect the unique feature of the resulting <e>stem</e> to bring entry/exit DNAs in contact and parallel. The results point to the stem being a fundamental structural motif directing chromatin higher order folding, as well as a major player in its dynamics.",M2
12917441,"Architecture of Ure2p prion filaments: the N-terminal domains form a central core fiber.The [URE3] prion is an inactive, self-propagating, filamentous form of the Ure2 protein, a regulator of nitrogen catabolism in yeast. The N-terminal  prion  domain of Ure2p determines its in vivo prion properties and in vitro amyloid-forming ability. Here we determined the overall structures of Ure2p filaments and related polymers of the prion domain fused to other globular proteins. Protease digestion of 25-nm diameter Ure2p filaments trimmed them to 4-nm filaments, which mass spectrometry showed to be composed of prion domain fragments, primarily residues approximately 1-70. Fusion protein filaments with diameters of 14-25 nm were also reduced to 4-nm filaments by proteolysis. The prion domain transforms from the most to the least protease-sensitive part upon filament formation in each case, implying that it undergoes a conformational change. Intact filaments imaged by cryo-electron microscopy or after vanadate staining by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) revealed a central 4-nm core with attached globular appendages. STEM mass per unit length measurements of unstained filaments yielded 1 monomer per 0.45 nm in each case. These observations strongly support a unifying model whereby subunits in Ure2p filaments, as well as in fusion protein filaments, are connected by interactions between their prion domains, which form a 4-nm amyloid filament backbone, surrounded by the corresponding C-terminal moieties.",M2

12160701,"Three-dimensional localization of ultrasmall immuno-gold labels by HAADF-<e>STEM</e> tomography.The localization of scarce antigens in thin sections of biological material can be accomplished by pre-embedment labeling with ultrasmall immuno-gold labels. Moreover, with this method, labeling is not restricted to the section surface but occurs throughout the section volume. Thus, when combined with electron tomography, antigens can be localized in three dimensions in relation to the 3D (three-dimensional) ultrastructure of the cell. However, for visualization in a transmission electron microscope, these labels need to be enlarged by silver or gold enhancement. The increase in particle size reduces the resolution of the antigen detection and the large particles obscure ultrastructural details in the tomogram. In this paper we show for the first time that these problems can be avoided and that ultrasmall gold labels can be localized in three dimensions without the need for gold or silver enhancement by using HAADF-STEM (high angular annular dark-field-scanning transmission electron microscopy) tomography. This method allowed us to three-dimensionally localize Aurion ultrasmall goat anti-rabbit immuno-gold labels on sections of Epon-embedded, osmium-uranium-lead-stained biological material. Calculations show that a 3D reconstruction obtained from HAADF-STEM projection images can be spatially aligned to one obtained from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) projections with subpixel accuracy. We conclude that it is possible to combine the high-fidelity structural information of TEM tomograms with the ultrasmall label localization ability of HAADF-STEM tomograms.",M2
12008948,"Fibrinogen assembly and crosslinking on a fibrin fragment E template.There is an ongoing controversy concerning whether crosslinked gamma chains in fibrin are oriented  transversely  between fibril strands or  end-to-end  along fibril strands. From the latter viewpoint, Veklich et al. [Proc Natl Acad Sci (USA) 95: 1438, 1998] observed that fibrinogen fibrils that had been assembled on a fibrin fragment E template, cross-linked with factor XIIIa, and then dissociated in acetic acid solution, were aligned end-to-end. This led to the conclusion that crosslinked gamma chains in fibrin under physiological conditions were also aligned end-to-end. To assess its validity we studied the assembly and organization of fibrinogen molecules on a des AB-fibrin fragment E (E-des AB) or a des A-fibrin fragment E (E-des A) template. We evaluated the roles of E polymerization sites E(A) and E(B), and D association sites gammaXL, Da, Db, betaC and alphaC in this process. E(A):Da interactions caused fibrinogen: E  DED  complexes to form, and markedly enhanced the gamma chain crosslinking rates of fibrinogen or des alphaC-fibrinogen. Fibrinogen crosslinking without added fibrin E was slower, and that of des alphaC-fibrinogen was still slower. These events showed that although alphaC domains promote fibrinogen fibril assembly and crosslinking, they contribute little to increasing the E(A):Da-dependent crosslinking rate. Electron microscopic (<e>STEM</e>) images of E-des AB and fibrinogen plus factor XIIIa showed single-, double-, and multistranded fibrils with interstrand DED complexes aligned side-to-side. This alignment was due to betaC:betaC contacts resulting from D subdomain rearrangements initiated by the E(B):Db interactions, and also occurred in mixtures of des alphaC-fibrinogen with E-des AB. In contrast, a mixture of fibrinogen and E-des A plus XIIIa revealed double-stranded fibrils with interstrand DED complexes in a half-staggered arrangement, an alignment that we attribute to crosslinking of gammaXL sites bridging between fibrils strands. These and other features of E-des A-based fibrinogen fibrils, including interstrand gamma chain bridges and early and extensive lateral fibril strand associations concomitant with accelerated gamma chain crosslinking, indicate that crosslinking of fibrin fibril strands takes place preferentially on transversely positioned gamma chains.",M2
11725676,"Distribution of nanofillers from a simplified-step adhesive in acid-conditioned dentin.PURPOSE: This in vitro study examined the interfacial ultrastructure of a nanofilled, simplified-step adhesive (Prime &amp; Bond NT, Dentsply), to determine the distribution of nanofillers within the collagen network of the hybrid layer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-four dentin discs were divided into two groups and bonded using two recommended conditioning techniques: Group I, NRC (Non-Rinse Conditioner), and Group II, Conditioner 36 (colloidal silica thickened 36% phosphoric acid). Following conditioning, a single coat of adhesive was applied and light-cured. Dentin discs were then bonded to form disc-pairs and processed for TEM examination. Demineralized, ultrathin sections were examined stained or unstained. Non-demineralized sections were used for <e>STEM</e>/EDX analysis of elemental distribution across the resin-dentin interface. In addition, four dentin discs were bonded with a generic adhesive (HEMA/TBBO) for TEM examination of stained collagen and proteoglycans. RESULTS: In unstained sections of both groups, nanofillers from the adhesive layer were congested around patent tubular orifices, but were not found within the interfibrillar spaces of the hybrid layer. EDX analysis of silicon (Si) showed predominant distribution within the adhesive layer and tubular orifices. Phosphorus (P) was present within the hybrid layer and adhesive layer in Group II. CONCLUSION: It is hypothesized that a) aggregation of the nanofillers within the adhesive resulted in filler clusters that are too large to infiltrate the interfibrillar spaces of the hybrid layer; and b) retention of ground substance within the demineralized intertubular collagen matrix may also have prevented the infiltration of the nanofillers.",M2
11317707,"Inorganic fibres in the lung tissue of Hungarian and German lung cancer patients.OBJECTIVE: To ascertain the lung burden of asbestos fibres in Hungarian lung cancer patients in comparison with the cumulative asbestos exposure estimated from the occupational history. METHODS: For 25 Hungarian lung cancer patients, lung tissue fibre analysis was performed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) and counting of ferruginous bodies (FBs) by light microscopy. Cumulative asbestos exposure in fibre-years was assessed from a standardised occupational history using the report  fibre years  of the German Berufsgenossenschaften. RESULTS: Median and maximum concentrations of fibres longer 5 microns per gram dry lung tissue (g dry) were 0.03 and 7.38 million fibres/g dry for chrysotile, 0.00 and 0.21 million fibres/g dry for amphibole and 0.22 and 0.62 million fibres/g dry for other mineral fibres (OMFs). The maximum values were observed in one patient for whom a high asbestos exposure was evident in advance from the occupational history. CONCLUSIONS: In comparison with reference values obtained by the same method for German patients with no indication of workplace asbestos exposure, increased concentrations of more than 0.2 million chrysotile fibres/g dry were obtained for six of the 25 Hungarian patients (24%). For one of them, the second highest estimate of a workplace exposure of 60 fibre-years and the highest tissue concentration of 7.38 million chrysotile fibres/g dry substantiate a high probability of a causal relationship to asbestos. A further comparison can be made with the results for 66 German patients treated by surgical lung resection for a disorder other than mesothelioma, mainly lung cancer. For the Hungarian lung cancer patients, similar amounts of chrysotile but distinctly lower amounts of amphibole fibres and distinctly higher amounts of OMFs were observed. A correlation between exposure estimates from occupational history and concentration of fibres in the lung tissue was observed for amphibole (Spearman: R = 0.66, P &lt; 0.001, Pearson: R = 0.50, P = 0.01) and for chrysotile (Pearson: R = 0.48, P = 0.02).",M2

The backbone of these fimbriae is built from a major structural 15.1-kDa protein, FedA. The structure of isolated negatively stained F18 fimbriae imaged by dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) was resolved to approximately 2 nm. Analyzing their helical symmetry showed the axially repeating units to alternate in a  zigzag  manner around the helical axis with an axial rise of 2.2 nm. Two repeating units give rise to the observed 4.3-nm helical repeat, which is practically identical to the pitch of the one-start helix formed. Additionally, an axially repeating pattern with a 27-nm spacing was found on rotary-shadowed fimbriae. Mass-per-length determination of unstained F18 fimbriae by STEM revealed the axially repeating unit to have a molecular mass of 25.4 kDa, indicating that it is a FedA monomer, with the difference in mass arising from the minor subunits, FedE and FedF. The presence of the latter two proteins might cause the observed 27-nm axial pattern.",M2
11162112,"<e>STEM</e> Analysis of Caenorhabditis elegans muscle thick filaments: evidence for microdifferentiated substructures.In the thick filaments of body muscle in Caenorhabditis elegans, myosin A and myosin B isoforms and a subpopulation of paramyosin, a homologue of myosin heavy chain rods, are organized about a tubular core. As determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy, the thick filaments show a continuous decrease in mass-per-length (MPL) from their central zones to their polar regions. This is consistent with previously reported morphological studies and suggests that both their content and structural organization are microdifferentiated as a function of position. The cores are composed of a second distinct subpopulation of paramyosin in association with the alpha, beta, and gamma-filagenins. MPL measurements suggest that cores are formed from seven subfilaments containing four strands of paramyosin molecules, rather than the two originally proposed. The periodic locations of the filagenins within different regions and the presence of a central zone where myosin A is located, implies that the cores are also microdifferentiated with respect to molecular content and structure. This differentiation may result from a novel  induced strain  assembly mechanism based upon the interaction of the filagenins, paramyosin and myosin A. The cores may then serve as  differentiated templates  for the assembly of myosin B and paramyosin in the tapering, microdifferentiated polar regions of the thick filaments.",M2
11006507,"<e>STEM</e>/TEM studies of collagen fibril assembly.Quantitative scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), implemented on a conventional transmission electron microscope with STEM-attachment, has been a primary tool in our laboratory for the quantitative analysis of collagen fibril assembly in vivo and in vitro. Using this technique, a precise measurement of mass per unit length can be made at regular intervals along a fibril to generate an axial mass distribution (AMD). This in turn allows the number of collagen molecules to be calculated for every transverse section of the fibril along its entire length. All fibrils show a near-linear AMD in their tip regions. Only fibrils formed in tissue environments, however, show a characteristic abrupt change in mass slope along their tips. It appears that this tip growth characteristic is common to fibrils from evolutionarily diverse systems including vertebrate tendon and the mutable tissues of the echinoderms. Computer models of collagen fibril assembly have now been developed based on interpretation of the STEM data. Two alternative models have so far been generated for fibril growth by accretion; one is based on diffusion limited aggregation (DLA) and the other based on an interface-limited growth mechanism. Inter-fibrillar fusion can also contribute to the growth of fibrils in vertebrate tissues and STEM data indicates the presence of a tight regulation in this process. These models are fundamental for the hypotheses regarding how cells synthesise and spatially organise an extracellular matrix (ECM), rich in collagen fibrils.",M2

For biochemical characterization, purified 26S proteasomes were resolved by two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis and subunits composing the regulatory complex (RC) were identified by amino acid sequencing and immunoblotting, before corresponding cDNAs were sequenced. 17 subunits from Drosophila RCs were found to have homologues in the yeast and human RCs. An additional subunit, p37A, not yet described in RCs of other organisms, is a member of the ubiquitin COOH-terminal hydrolase family (UCH). Analysis of EM images of 26S proteasomes-UCH-inhibitor complexes allowed for the first time to localize one of the RC's specific functions, deubiquitylating activity. The masses of 26S proteasomes with either one or two attached RCs were determined by scanning transmission EM (<e>STEM</e>), yielding a mass of 894 kD for a single RC. This value is in good agreement with the summed masses of the 18 identified RC subunits (932 kD), indicating that the number of subunits is complete.",M2
10833672,"Electron probe X-ray microanalysis of cultured myogenic C2C12 cells with scanning and scanning transmission electron microscopy.Heterogeneity of the elemental content of myogenic C2C12 cultured cells was studied by electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPXMA) with scanning (SEM EPXMA) and scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e> EPXMA). The best plastic substrate for growing cells was Thermanox. For STEM EPXMA, a Formvar film coated with carbon was found to be suitable substrate. The cells examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy showed great heterogeneity in their elemental content in comparison with the cells examined in the scanning electron microscope despite of an almost identical preparation procedure for EPXMA. Nevertheless the K/Na ratios obtained from both methods of EPXMA were very close (4.1 and 4.3). We conclude that the observed discrepancy in the elemental content obtained by the two methods may be due to differences in instrumentation and this must be taken into account when planning a comparative study.",M2
10798313,"Spermatozoa of the 'primitive type' in Scutigerella (Myriapoda, Symphyla).The myriapod class Symphyla is of interest in that insects generally are assumed to be derived from symphylan-like ancestors. Male Symphyla form spermatophores that are picked up by the female. Both euspematozoa and paraspermatozoa are formed. In spite of the mode of fertilization their euspermatozoa were found to be of a kind that is typical of aquatic animals, so called 'primitive spermatozoa;' these are characterized by a short sperm head with a bilayered acrosome, a midpiece containing a few unmodified mitochondria, and a 9 + 2 flagellum. Scutigerella are unique among terrestrial arthropods in having 'primitive spermatozoa'; and together with horseshoe crabs they are only the second case in Arthropoda. Two further sperm plesiomorphies not found in other myriapods or insects are (1) the presence of a cytoplasmic canal housing the proximal flagellum and (2) the existence of microtubular triplets in centrioles, one of which acts as a basal body. Symphyla and Diplopoda both have a striated structure in the center of the subacrosomal material. The paraspermatozoa lack acrosome and nucleus but have a prominent crystal, a single mitochondrion, and two membrane systems. The structure of Scutigerella euspermatozoa is consistent with Symphyla being close to the <e>stem</e> group of Myriapoda plus Insecta.",M2
10633065,"Variation of cellulose microfibril angles in softwoods and hardwoods-a possible strategy of mechanical optimization.Position-resolved small-angle X-ray scattering was used to investigate the nanostructure of the wood cell wall in two softwood species (Norwegian spruce and Scots pine) and two hardwood species (pedunculate oak and copper beech). The tilt angle of the cellulose fibrils in the wood cell wall versus the longitudinal cell axis (microfibril angle) was systematically studied over a wide range of annual rings in each tree. The measured angles were correlated with the distance from the pith and the results were compared. The microfibril angle was found to decrease from pith to bark in all four trees, but was generally higher in the softwood than in the hardwood. In Norwegian spruce, the microfibril angles were higher in late wood than in early wood; in Scots pine the opposite was observed. In pedunculate oak and copper beech, low angles were found in the major part of the <e>stem</e>, except for the very first annual rings in pedunculate oak. The results are interpreted in terms of mechanical optimization. An attempt was made to give a quantitative estimation for the mechanical constraints imposed on a tree of given dimensions and to establish a model that could explain the general decrease of microfibril angles from pith to bark.",M2

10049805,"Late events in the assembly of 20S proteasomes.Electron microscopy and <e>STEM</e> mass measurements have been used to characterize late intermediates in the assembly pathway of wildtype and mutant Rhodococcus proteasomes. A proteolytically inactive and processing-incompetent mutant, betaK33A, allowed a short-lived late intermediate of the pathway to be captured, the preholoproteasome. In this fully assembled 20S complex the 14 propeptides with an aggregate mass of 100 kDa fill the whole central cavity and most of the two antechambers. It is further shown that in wildtype Rhodococcus proteasomes the propeptides are degraded in a processive manner undergoing multiple cleavages before the products are discharged and the inner cavities are cleared. It appears that the docking of two half-proteasomes, i.e., preholoproteasome formation, is sufficient to trigger autocleavage of the Gly-1/Thr1 bond necessary for active site formation and the subsequent degradation of the propeptides.",M2
9914509,"Investigation of the structure of spinach photosystem II reaction center complex.The photosystem II (PSII) reaction center (RC) complex was isolated from spinach and characterized by gel electrophoresis, gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation. The purified complex contained the PsbA, PsbD, PsbE, PsbF and PsbI subunits. Gel filtration and analytical ultracentrifugation indicated the presence of a homogeneous complex. The mass of the RC complexes was found to be 107 kDa by analytical ultracentrifugation and 132 kDa by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>). The mass obtained showed the isolated complex to exist as a monomer and only one cytochrome b559 (cyt b559) to be associated with the RC complex. Digital images of negatively stained RC complexes were recorded by STEM and analyzed by single-particle averaging. The complex was 9 nm long and 5 nm wide, and exhibited a pronounced quasi-twofold symmetry. This supports the symmetric organization of the PSII complex, with the PsbA and the PsbD proteins in the center and symmetrically arranged PsbB and PsbC proteins at the periphery of the monomeric complex.",M2
9838058,"Assembled tau filaments differ from native paired helical filaments as determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>).Paired helical filaments (PHF) are abnormal, approximately 20-25-nm wide periodically twisted filaments, which accumulate in Alzheimer's disease (AD) brain and other neurodegenerative disorders, including corticobasal degeneration (CBD). PHF are primarily composed of highly phosphorylated tau protein. However, both phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated forms of tau are able to assemble in vitro into filaments similar in the ultrastructural appearance to PHF. In the present study, filaments were assembled in vitro from unmodified recombinant human tau and the physical mass per unit length of filaments and the mass density were determined using scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM). Two general types of filaments were observed. One type was composed of 11.4 nm-wide, 10-75 nm long, frequently twisted and PHF-like filaments, with a mass per unit length (44 kDa/nm) approximately one third of that observed in isolated AD filaments. The other were straight filaments, approximately 6.8-nm wide and 0.2-2 microm long, which often formed parallel clusters of two or more filaments. Triple clusters were 19. 2-nm wide and had a mass per unit length (70 kDa/nm) approximately two thirds of that seen in isolated AD filaments. Despite different morphology, both twisted and straight filaments had mass densities between 0.48-0.55 kDa/nm3. These values are significantly higher than those reported for PHF found either in AD (0.40 kDa/nm3) or CBD (0.33 kDa/nm3). These results suggest that the packing of tau differs in vivo from that observed in vitro and that specific tau isoform content, elongation of tau molecules by phosphorylation or other factors may be required to reproduce pathological assembly. Therefore mass density determinations appear to be an important criterion in comparing various filaments.",M2
9782387,"Scanning transmission electron microscopy study of the molecular mass of amphipol/cytochrome b6f complexes.The composition and mass of complexes between Chlamydomonas reinhardtii cytochrome b6f and low molecular mass amphipathic polymers ('amphipols') have been studied using biochemical analysis and scanning transmission electron microscopy at liquid helium temperature (cryo-<e>STEM</e>). Cytochrome b6f was trapped by amphipols either under its native 14-meric state or as a delipidated, lighter form. A good consistency was observed between the masses of either form calculated from their biochemical composition and those determined by cryo-STEM. These data show that association with amphipols preserved the original original state of the protein in detergent solution. Complexation with amphipols appears to facilitate preparation of the samples and mass determination by cryo-STEM as compared to conventional solubilization with detergents.",M2
9744095,"Photomorphogenic development of the Arabidopsis shy2-1D mutation and its interaction with phytochromes in darkness.We previously reported a photomorphogenic mutation of Arabidopsis thaliana, shy2-1D, as a dominant suppressor of a hy2 mutation. Here, we report that shy2-1D confers various photo-responsive phenotypes in darkness and the dark phenotypes of the mutant are affected by phytochrome deficiency. Dark-grown seedlings of the mutant developed several photomorphogenic characteristics such as short hypocotyls, cotyledon expansion and opening, and partial differentiation of plastids. When grown further in darkness, the mutant plant underwent most of the developmental stages of a light-grown wild-type plant, including development of foliar leaves, an inflorescence <e>stem</e> with cauline leaves, and floral organs. In addition, two light-inducible genes, the nuclear-encoded CAB and the plastid-encoded PSBA genes, were highly expressed in the dark-grown mutant seedlings. Furthermore, reduced gravitropism, a phytochrome-modulated response, was observed in the mutant hypocotyl in darkness. Thus, shy2-1D is one of the most pleiotropic photomorphogenic mutations identified so far. The results indicate that SHY2 may be a key component regulating photomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. Surprisingly, double mutants of the shy2-1D mutant with the phytochrome-deficient mutants hy2, hy3(phyB-1) and fre1-1(phyA-201) showed reduced photomorphogenic response in darkness with a longer hypocotyl, a longer inflorescence stem, and a lower level expression of the CAB gene than the shy2-1D single mutant. These results showed that phytochromes function in darkness in the shy2-1D mutant background. The implications of these results are discussed.",M2
9733646,"Structure of a filamentous phosphoglycoprotein polymer: the secreted acid phosphatase of Leishmania mexicana.The insect stage of the protozoan parasite Leishmania mexicana secretes a filamentous acid phosphatase (secreted acid phosphatase, SAP), a polymeric phosphoglycoprotein. The wild-type (wt) SAP filament is a copolymer composed of two related gene products SAP1 and SAP2, which are identical in the enzymatically active NH2-terminal domain and the COOH-terminal domain, but differ in the length of a highly glycosylated Ser/Thr-rich repeat region (32 amino acids and 383 amino acids, respectively) which is located between these domains. When expressed separately, full length SAP1, SAP2, or the NH2-terminal domain alone, are able to assemble into filaments. The Ser/Thr-rich region is the exclusive target for a novel type of O-glycosylation via phosphoserines. By using glycerol spraying/low-angle rotary metal shadowing and labelling with monoclonal antibodies it is demonstrated that the repetitive region adopts an extended conformation forming side arms which project radially from the filament core and terminate with the COOH-terminal domain. The length of the side arms of SAP1 and SAP2 (20 nm and 90 nm, respectively) corresponds to the predicted length of the Ser/Thr-rich repeat region of SAP1 and SAP2. Mass determination by scanning electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) shows that one morphologically defined globular particle of the filament core is a polypeptide dimer. We propose a model for the filament core, in which the globular NH2-terminal SAP domains form one strand composed of polypeptide dimers or two tightly associated strands of monomers which may twist into a double helix, similar to actin filaments. The highly O-glycosylated side arms project from the filament core conferring an overall bottle-brush-like appearance. The L. mexicana SAP is compared to SAPs secreted by the closely related species L. amazonensis and L. donovani.",M2
9718982,"Visualization of calcium channels involved in transmitter release from neuronal growth cones.Immunocytological localization of omega-agatoxin IVA (omega-aga IVA)-sensitive Ca2+ channels involved in glutamate release from growth cones of cultured rat dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons was studied with field emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The omega-aga IVA-sensitive Ca2+ channels were visualized by labeling with immuno-gold particles (30 nm). FE-SEM and TEM images showed that immuno-gold particles were present in the area of growth cones as well as somata, and generally absent on neurite <e>stem</e> and fibroblasts. TEM images of vertical ultra-thin sections showed that the immuno-gold particles were present on the surface of the plasma membrane. Since the gold particles indicate the immunological presence of omega-aga IVA-sensitive Ca2+ channels, the Ca2+ channels involved in transmitter release are present on growth cones before making synapse formation.",M2
9512501,"Cornified cell envelope assembly: a model based on electron microscopic determinations of thickness and projected density.In stratifying squamous epithelia, the cornified cell envelope (CE), a peripheral layer of crosslinked protein, is assembled sequentially from precursor proteins initially dispersed in the cytoplasm. Its major component is loricrin (37 kDa in mouse), which contributes from approx. 60% to &gt;80% of the protein mass in different tissues. Despite its importance to the mechanical resilience and impenetrability of these tissues, detailed information has not been obtained on CE structure, even on such basic properties as its thickness or uniformity across a given CE or from tissue to tissue. To address this issue, we have studied CEs isolated from three murine epithelia, namely epidermis, forestomach and footpad, by electron microscopy of metal-shadowed specimens and scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) of unstained specimens. The former data reveal that the cytoplasmic surface is smoothly textured whereas the extracellular surface is corrugated, and that the average thickness is 15.3+/-1.2 nm, and strikingly uniform. Measurements of mass-per-unit-area from the STEM images yielded values of approx. 7.0+/-0.8 kDa/nm2, which were remarkably consistent over all three tissues. These data imply that the mature CE has a uniquely defined thickness. To explain its uniformity, we postulate that loricrin forms a molecular monolayer, not a variable number of multiple layers. In this scenario, the packing density is one loricrin monomer per 7 nm2, and loricrin should have an elongated shape, 2.5-3.0 nm wide by approx. 11 nm long. Moreover, we anticipate that any inter-tissue variations in the mechanical properties of CEs should depend more on protein composition and cross-linking pattern than on the thickness of the protein layer deposited.",M2
9571058,"Reconstitution, characterisation and mass analysis of the pentacylindrical allophycocyanin core complex from the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. PCC 7120.The phycobilisome (PBS) of Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 was allowed to dissociate into its constituents and the resulting allophycocyanin (AP) fraction was purified. Its reconstitution yielded a complex which according to negative stain electron microscopy and spectral analysis was identical to the native pentacylindrical PBS core domain. Each cylinder of the central tricylindric unit was comprised of four AP (alphabeta)3 disks. Mass analysis using the scanning transmission electron microscope (<e>STEM</e>) showed the presence of 16 AP trimers in the intact reconstitute, which had a total mass of 1966(+/-66) kDa. Composition analysis indicated an AP trimer distribution of (AP-II):(AP-LCM):(AP-B):(AP-I)=6:2:2:6, i.e. an addition of two AP-I and two AP-II complexes compared to a tricylindrical PBS core domain. Therefore, we suggest that each supplementary half-core cylinder found in pentacylindrical AP core domains is comprised of one AP-I and one AP-II trimer, in agreement with the current model. The structural significance of the 127 kDa core membrane linker polypeptide was further investigated by subjecting the AP core reconstitute to mild chymotryptic degradation. After isolation, the digested complex exhibited a tricylindrical appearance while STEM mass analysis confirmed the presence of only 12 AP complexes. Polypeptide analysis by SDS-PAGE and Edman degradation related the half-cylinder loss to cleavage of the Rep4 domain of the core membrane linker polypeptide. On the basis of these data, a general model for the assembly of the three hemidiscoidal PBS types known to date is discussed.",M2
9514733,"Evaluating atomic models of F-actin with an undecagold-tagged phalloidin derivative.We have prepared an undecagold-tagged phalloidin derivative to determine this mushroom toxin's binding site and orientation within the F-actin filament by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) and 3-D helical reconstruction. Remarkably, when stoichiometrically bound to F-actin, the undecagold moiety of the derivative could be directly visualized by STEM along the two half-staggered long-pitch helical strands of single filaments. Most importantly, the structural data obtained when combined with various biochemical constraints enabled us to critically evaluate two distinct atomic models of the F-actin filament (i.e. the Holmes-Lorenz versus the Schutt-Lindberg model). Taken together, our data are in excellent agreement with the Holmes-Lorenz model.",M2
9468612,"Intermediate filament structure: hard alpha-keratin.Structurally there are four classes of intermediate filaments (IF) with distinct but closely related axial organisations. One of these, hard alpha-keratin IF, has been studied to clarify several apparently exceptional features which include the number of molecules in the IF cross-section and the mode by which the axial organisation of its constituent molecules is stabilised. Using the dark-field mode of the <e>STEM</e> at the Brookhaven National Laboratory (USA) mass measurements were obtained from unstained IF isolated from hair keratin. The data thus obtained show that the number of chains in cross-section is about 30 (+/-3: standard deviation) and is very similar to the numbers determined in previous STEM experiments for the dominant filament type in other classes of IF (about 32). Furthermore, re-analysis of the low-angle equatorial X-ray diffraction pattern reveals, in contrast to earlier work, solutions that are compatible with the number of chains in cross-section indicated by the STEM data. The absence of the head-to-tail overlap between parallel molecules characteristic of most of IF may be compensated in hard alpha-keratin by a network of intermolecular disulfide bonds. It is concluded that native IF of hard alpha-keratin and desmin/vimentin--and probably many other kinds of IF as well--contain about 32 chains in cross-section, and that the axial structures of these various kinds of IF differ in small but significant ways, while generally observing the same basic modes of aggregation.",M2
9346321,"Mass determination, subunit organization and control of oligomerization states of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH).Analytical dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) of freeze-dried unstained specimens of keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH; from Megathura crenulata, a prosobranch gastropod) gave a molecular mass of 400 kDa for the subunit of KLH1 and of 345 kDa for the subunit of KLH2, which confirms our published values from SDS/PAGE. Within the 400-kDa KLH1 subunit we identified, by limited proteolysis, isolation of fragments and N-terminal sequencing, eight distinct 45-60 kDa functional domains (termed 1a through 1h) and determined their sequential arrangement. The KLH1 domains differ biochemically and immunologically from each other and from the previously characterized seven domains of KLH2 (termed 2a through 2g). Our partial amino acid sequences suggest that a domain, equivalent to the C-terminal domain 1h, is missing in KLH2. This deficiency is believed to be genuine and not an artifact of the subunit preparation procedure, since STEM measurements of the native didecamers yielded a mass difference of about 800 kDa between KLH1 and KLH2 (8.3 MDa versus 7.5 MDa), correlating with 20 copies of a functional 1h domain. It was also shown that the KLH1 didecamer can be rapidly split (minutes) into an almost homogeneous population of stable decamers by increasing the pH of the Tris/saline stabilizing buffer (routinely pH 7.4), which contains 5 mM CaCl2 and 5 mM MgCl2, to pH 8.5. Reformation of the didecamers occurred more slowly (days) upon dialysis against the pH 7.4 stabilizing buffer. Addition of 100 mM calcium and 100 mM magnesium ions to the pH 7.4 stabilizing buffer leads to the more rapid (overnight) formation of didecamers together with a significant number of previously unobserved KLH1 multidecamers, which could be structurally distinguished from the established multidecamers of KLH2.",M2
9299322,"The molecular structure of agrobacterium VirE2-single stranded DNA complexes involved in nuclear import.Nuclear import of DNA is a central event in genetic transformation of plant cells by Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Agrobacterium elicits tumors on plant hosts by transporting a single-stranded (ss) copy of the bacterial transferred DNA (T-DNA) from its Ti (tumor-inducing) plasmid into the plant cell nucleus. Presumably, the process of T-DNA nuclear import is mediated by two agrobacterium proteins, VirD2 and VirE2, which are thought to directly associate with the transported T-DNA. Both proteins have been shown to contain functional nuclear localizations signals (NLS). Recently, VirE2 alone has been shown to actively transport ssDNA into the plant cell nucleus. To understand the process of DNA nuclear import, it is important to know the structure of the transport intermediate. To this end, complexes of VirE2 and ssDNA were analyzed by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>). This analysis suggests that VirE2 packages ssDNA into semi-rigid, hollow cylindrical filaments with a telephone cord-like coiled structure. The outer diameter of these complexes is too large to enter the nucleus by diffusion but is within the size exclusion limits of the active nuclear import. Detailed mass analysis of VirE2-ssDNA filaments is presented and a structural model is proposed.",M2
8995227,"Binding of amyloid beta protein to the 20 S proteasome.Neurodegenerative disorders of aging are characterized by the intraneuronal accumulation of ubiquitin conjugates into tangles and inclusions. Ubiquitin conjugates are degraded by cellular particles known as proteasomes. We have previously shown that amyloid beta protein (Abeta) inhibits proteasomal activity and thereby blocks ubiquitin conjugate degradation. In the present studies, we found that Abeta binds the 20 S proteasome and forms a proteasome-Abeta complex. The complex was detected by Western blot with anti-Abeta antibodies. Using a 1.4 nm Nanogold-labeled Abeta, we visualized proteasome-Abeta complexes by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>). Analysis of the side-on oriented proteasome-Abeta complexes revealed a single gold particle, corresponding to one gold-labeled Abeta, in the middle portion of the proteasome. On end-on views of proteasome-Abeta complexes, gold was detected within the area delimited by the proteasome circular projection. Both STEM views are consistent with Abeta localization inside the proteasome along the peptide channel. Direct interaction of Abeta with the inner catalytic compartment of the proteasome may explain the generation of ubiquitin-containing lesions in Alzheimer's disease and other neurodegenerative disorders. In addition, detection of Nanogold-labeled peptide inside the 20 S eukaryotic proteasome suggests that conformational constraints for protein degradation in eukaryotic proteasomes are different from those in archaebacteria proteasomes.",M2
8709154,"Stoichiometry and domainal organization of the long tail-fiber of bacteriophage T4: a hinged viral adhesin.The long-tail fibers (LTFs) form part of bacteriophage T4's apparatus for host cell recognition and infection, being responsible for its initial attachment to susceptible bacteria. The LTF has two parts, each approximately 70 to 75 nm long; gp34 (140 kDa) forms the proximal half-fiber, while the distal half-fiber is composed of gp37 (109 kDa), gp36(23 kDa) and gp35 (30 kDa). LTFs have long been thought to be dimers of gp34, gp37 and gp36, with one copy of gp35. We have used mass mapping by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>), quantitative SDS-PAGE, and computational sequence analysis to study the structures of purified LTFs and half-fibers of both kinds. These data establish that the LTF is, in fact, trimeric, with a stoichiometry of gp34: gp37: gp36: gp35 = 3:3:3:1. Averaged images of stained and unstained molecules resolve the LTF into a linear stack of 17 domains. At the proximal end is a globular domain of approximately 145 kDa that becomes incorporated into the baseplate. It is followed by a rod-like shaft (33 x 4 mm; 151 kDa) which correlates with a cluster of seven quasi repeats, each 34 to 39 residues long. The proximal half-fiber terminates in three globular domains. The distal half-fiber consists of ten globular domains of variable size and spacing, preceding a needle-like end domain (15 x 2.5 nm; 31 kDa). The LTF is rigid apart from hinges between the two most proximal domains, and between the proximal and distal half-fibers. The latter hinge occurs at a site of local non-equivalence (the  kneecap ) at which density, correlated with the presence of gp35, bulges asymmetrically out on one side. Several observations indicate that gp34 participates in the sharing of conserved structural modules among coliphage tail-fiber genes to which gp37 was previously noted to subscribe. Two adjacent globular domains in the proximal half-fiber match a pair of domains in the distal half-fiber, and the rod domain in the proximal half-fiber resembles a similar domain in the T4 short tail-fiber (gp12). Finally, possible structures are considered; combining our data with earlier observations, the most likely conformation for most of the LTF is a three-stranded beta-helix.",M2
8702002,"Ultrastructural instability of paired helical filaments from corticobasal degeneration as examined by scanning transmission electron microscopy.Paired helical filaments (PHFs) accumulate in the brains of subjects affected with Alzheimer's disease (AD) and certain other neurodegenerative disorders, including corticobasal degeneration (CBD). Electron microscope studies have shown that PHFs from CBD differ from those of AD by being wider and having a longer periodicity of the helical twist. Moreover, PHFs from CBD have been shown to be primarily composed of two rather than three highly phosphorylated polypeptides of tau (PHF-tau), with these polypeptides expressing no exons 3 and 10. To further explore the relationship between the heterogeneity of PHF-tau and the appearance of abnormal filaments, the ultrastructure and physical parameters such as mass per unit length and dimensions were compared in filaments from CBD and AD using high resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>). Filament-enriched fractions were isolated as Sarcosyl-insoluble pellets and for STEM studies, samples were freeze-dried without prior fixation or staining. Ultrastructurally, PHFs from CBD were shown to be a heterogeneous population as double- and single-stranded filaments could be identified based on their width and physical mass per unit length expressed in kilodaltons (kd) per nanometer (nm). Less abundant, double-stranded filaments had a maximal width of 29 nm and a mass per unit length of 133 kd/nm, whereas three times more abundant single-stranded filaments were 15 nm wide and bad a mass per unit length of 62 kd/nm. Double-stranded filaments also displayed a distinct axial region of less dense mass, which appeared to divide the PHFs into two protofilament-like strands. Furthermore, these filaments were frequently observed to physically separate along the long axis into two single strands or to break longitudinally. In contrast, PHFs from AD were ultrastructurally stable and uniform both in their width (22 nm) and physical mass per unit length (104 kd/nm). The ultrastructural features indicate that filaments of CBD and AD differ both in stability and packing of tau and that CBD filaments, composed of two distinct protofilaments, are more labile under STEM conditions. As fixed and stained filaments from CBD have been shown to be stable and uniform in size by conventional transmission electron microscopy, STEM studies may be particularly suitable for detecting instability of unstained and unfixed filaments. The results also suggest that molecular heterogeneity and/or post-translational modifications of tau may strongly influence the morphology and stability of abnormal filaments.",M2
8782719,"Hard alpha-keratin intermediate filaments: an alternative interpretation of the low-angle equatorial X-ray diffraction pattern, and the axial disposition of putative disulphide bonds in the intra- and inter-protofilamentous networks.<e>STEM</e> and electron microscopy have indicated that intermediate filaments (IF) may contain protofilaments and protofibrils, possibly with four and eight chains in section, respectively. Two important questions related to this observation but pertaining specifically to the structure of the hard alpha-keratin IF have been addressed in this work. The first relates to the apparently smaller number of chains in section (and hence protofilaments and/or protofibrils) in hard alpha-keratin IF as compared to epidermal keratin, vimentin and neurofilament IF. From the low-angle equatorial X-ray diffraction patterns the observed maxima were interpreted by others as arising from the Fourier transform of a uniformly dense cylinder of diameter 7.45 nm and, by implication, containing about 23 chains in section. Here it is shown that a simple, alternative density distribution for the IF is compatible with both the positions of the observed equatorial diffraction maxima and with 32 chains in section, thus allowing the possibility that IF from diverse sources (hard alpha-keratin, epidermal keratin, vimentin and neurofilaments) have a common number of chains in section and hence the same number of subfilamentous elements. The second point relates to the stabilisation of the protofilaments and/or protofibrils. It has been shown that the relative axial alignment of molecules in hard alpha-keratin IF is similar but not identical to that in both epidermal keratin and vimentin IF. A key difference involves the presence of a small gap (about 1.3-1.4nm) between similarly directed molecules as distinct from the head-to-tail overlap between parallel molecules that appears to be a characteristic of all other IF, and which is believed to have a major role in stabilising these assemblies. In contrast, it was proposed that the hard alpha-keratin IF gains its stability in part through a net work of intermolecular disulphide bonds. Here it is shown that disulphide bonds may exist between spatially-adjacent molecules one, two, three or four apart (and beyond) in the proposed surface lattice structure. This indicates the possibility that subfibrillar structural elements consisting of discrete groupings of disulphide-bonded molecules may be present in hard alpha-keratin IF.",M2
8822749,"A study of Technegas employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, scanning transmission electron microscopy and wet-chemical methods.Scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>), coupled with energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDS), X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) or radionuclear chemical methods, indicates that the active agent in Technegas is either polymeric TcO2[i.e. (TcO2)n] or (TcO2)n bound to a carbon nanoparticle. The particle size observed using STEM is in good agreement with other published results. XPS has also been used to investigate technetium residues remaining on spent crucibles. The chemical form of technetium in this residue is quite different to the form detected in the aerosol particles. We conclude that the small fraction that migrates into the crucible framework upon resistive heating is reduced to either metallic technetium or carbidic forms, with the remaining nuclide evaporating as (TcO2)n with or without carbon before complete reduction can occur.",M2
8621528,"The multi-hemoglobin system of the hydrothermal vent tube worm Riftia pachyptila. I. Reexamination of the number and masses of its constituents.The deep-sea tube worm Riftia pachyptila Jones possesses a well developed circulatory system and a large coelomic compartment, both containing extracellular hemoglobins. Fresh vascular blood is heterogeneous and contains two different hemoglobins (V1 and V2), whereas the coelomic fluid is homogeneous and comprises only one hemoglobin (C1). Their molecular weights have been determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy mass mapping (<e>STEM</e>) and by multi-angle laser light scattering (MALLS). Both methods yielded approximately the same molecular weights with masses significantly higher than the literature data for V1. V1, V2, and C1 had Mr of 3396 +/- 540 x 10(3), 393 +/- 71 x 10(3), and 410 +/- 51 x 10(3) by STEM, and 3503 +/- 13 x 10(3), 433 +/- 8 x 10(3), and 380 +/- 4 x 10(3) by MALLS, respectively. Transmission electron micrographs of V1 are typical of an hexagonal bilayer hemoglobin (HBL Hb). When submitted to dilution or osmotic shock, V1 dissociates into halves and one-twelfth subunits like annelid HBL Hbs. V1 is resistant to urea treatment, indicating that hydrophobic interactions play a small role in its quaternary structure. Conversely, V1 Hb is rather unstable in solution without denaturant, a property which seems to be characteristic of vestimentiferan HBL Hbs and could be explained by an important number of hydrogen bonds.",M2
8708132,"Quantitative analysis of the dentin adhesive interface by Auger spectroscopy.The ultimate success of a dentin adhesive bond is dependent in large part on specific conditions at the interface between the tooth and the adhesive. Most current dentin adhesive systems use some sort of pre-treatment to demineralize the first few microns of the dentin surface, leaving a meshwork of collagen into which the adhesive resin can penetrate, infiltrate, and polymerize. The general hypothesis tested in this experiment was that the penetration and distribution of adhesive resin into the demineralized zone are a function of the conditioner used as a pre-treatment for the adhesive application. Four commercially available adhesive systems were modified to incorporate hydroxyethylthiomethacrylate (HETMA), a sulfur-substituted, traceable analogue of 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), thereby allowing for a qualitative measurement of the amount and distribution of monomer in the treated dentin substrate by energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDS) and a quantitative measurement by Auger electron spectroscopy (AES). The dentin pre-treatments investigated were: (1) 10% citric acid/3% ferric chloride, (2) 10% maleic acid, (3) 2.5% nitric acid, and (4) an alcoholic solution of HEMA with a phosphorus acid ester. These pre-treatments were applied to freshly extracted teeth that had been sectioned to expose the dentin and ground to simulate the smeared layer. After the appropriate pre-treatment was applied, a 10% (v/v) solution of HETMA in acetone was applied to the surface, followed by the corresponding adhesive resin, which was then polymerized. The samples were then processed for observation by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>), AES, and STEM/EDS analysis. The results indicated significant differences in the ability of HETMA to penetrate the dentin surface conditioned by the four pretreatments investigated here. This study also demonstrated that AES and STEM/EDS could be used in a correlative fashion to determine the distribution of HETMA within or adjacent to the treated dentin surface.",M2
8622393,"Excess zinc associated with severe progressive cholestasis in Cree and Ojibwa-Cree children.BACKGROUND: High hepatic copper concentrations have been reported in several liver disorders. We report six Native Canadian children with severe chronic cholestatic liver disease, who had excess hepatic copper and zinc. METHODS: The children, aged 22 months to 8 years, came from northern Ontario, Canada. All were referred for possible liver transplantation because of end-stage liver disease. We examined explanted liver samples (or liver biopsy material in one case) by scanning transmission electronmicroscopic (<e>STEM</e>) X-ray elemental microanalysis and atomic absorption spectrophotometry. Samples from four controls (two with no liver pathology, one with biliary atresia, and one with Wilson's disease) were also analysed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. FINDINGS: The explanted livers showed similar distinctive signs of advanced biliary cirrhosis, and on electronmicroscopy there were dense deposits in enlarged lysosomes and in cytoplasm. Hepatic copper concentrations were many times higher in the five patients with measurements (47.6-56.9 microgram/g dry weight) than in two samples of normal control liver tissue (2.3 and 2.9 microgram/g). Similarly, hepatic zinc concentrations were many times higher in the patients than in controls (104-128 vs 1.9-3.2 microgram/g dry weight). INTERPRETATION: The excess copper may be due to chronic cholestasis but the excess zinc is unexplained. Since three of the patients are related (shared grandparents), a genetic disorder of metal metabolism is possible, but we cannot exclude environmental factors.",M2
8652882,"Thickness measurement of hydrated and dehydrated cryosections by EELS.Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) provides a useful method for determining the thickness of frozen-hydrated and dehydrated cryosections in terms of the inelastic mean free path. Cryosection thickness is an important parameter because plural inelastic scattering limits the sensitivity of elemental microanalysis based on core-loss EELS, and because overlapping structures can affect interpretation of microanalytical data as well as the quality of electron images. The purpose of this work was to establish the minimum practical thickness for cutting cryosections and to explain the measured values for hydrated and dehydrated specimens. Hydrated sections were typically found to be between 1.5-2.5 times thicker than expected from the nominal microtome setting; this difference can be largely explained by compression during cutting. Comparison of micrographs from hydrated and dehydrated cryosections of rapidly-frozen, vitrified liver revealed a lateral shrinkage of approximately 20% on drying. The measured compression and shrinkage factors are consistent with dark-field scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) mass measurements on freeze-dried sections. Freeze-dried cryosections, cut to a nominal thickness of 90 nm and supported on thin Formvar/carbon films, had a relative thickness t/lambda i in the range of 0.5 for cytoplasm to 0.9 for mitochondria when analyzed at 100 keV beam energy. Mass loss of approximately 30% occurring at high electron dose enabled useful core-loss spectra to be recorded even from high-mass compartments such as mitochondria without excessive plural scattering.",M2
7662672,"Scanning transmission electron microscopy and small-angle scattering provide evidence that native Escherichia coli ClpP is a tetradecamer with an axial pore.The Escherichia coli ATP-dependent caseinolytic protease (Clp) is composed of two distinct subunits; protease, ClpP, and ATPase, ClpA. Active ClpP has been overexpressed to approximately 50% of soluble protein in E. coli, and purified to homogeneity. Direct mass determination of individual particles using scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) yields a mean native molecular mass of 305 +/- 9 kDa for the ClpP oligomer, suggesting that it has a tetradecameric structure. Small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) curves were determined for ClpP in solution at concentrations of 1-10 mg/mL. A combination of STEM and SAXS data was used to derive a model for ClpP, comprising a cylindrical oligomer about 100 A in diameter and about 75 A in height with an axial pore about 32-36 A in diameter. The volume of the pore is estimated to be approximately 70,000 A3, similar in size to those found in chaperone proteins, and is large enough to accommodate unfolded polypeptide chains, although most globular folded proteins would be excluded.",M2
7629332,"Scanning transmission electron microscopy/energy-dispersive spectroscopy analysis of the dentin adhesive interface using a labeled 2-hydroxyethylmethacrylate analogue.In an attempt to compare the morphology of the dentin adhesive interface and the wetting and penetration of the adhesive in relation to the dentin surface, we studied four dentin adhesive systems using scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) and energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS). 2-Hydroxyethylmethacrylate (HEMA), a monomer common to many commercial dentin adhesive systems, was altered to produce a thiolated analogue (HETMA). Sulfur, traceable by EDS and STEM, was substituted for the oxygen atom in the backbone of the HEMA molecule. The resulting analogue, with solubility parameters and other wetting and physical properties very similar to those of HEMA, was applied to four sets of tooth specimens, each pre-treated with a different primer or etchant. Three separate pre-treatments--nitric acid, maleic acid, and citric acid/ferric chloride--created a demineralized zone approximately 1 to 3 microns thick at the dentin surface. The HETMA was found to permeate freely into this zone when either of the latter two pre-treatments was used. However, the band of dentin that was demineralized by the nitric acid pre-treatment appeared impermeable to the HETMA. The fourth pre-treatment, an alcohol-based solution including the phosphorus acid ester PENTA and HEMA, modified the smear layer of the tooth slightly and did not appear to demineralize the dentin. HETMA applied to the specimens pre-treated with PENTA and HEMA was clearly in intimate contact with the dentin or modified smear layer; however, it did not penetrate or diffuse into these areas. It did flow into the dentinal tubules, as was also evident with each of the other systems. It was concluded that the acid pre-treatment of the dentin greatly influenced the wetting behavior of the dentin adhesive and thus could substantially affect the resultant bond strength of the dentin adhesive systems.",M2
7731042,"Model structure of the Omp alpha rod, a parallel four-stranded coiled coil from the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima.Omp alpha is an outer-membrane protein that spans the periplasmic space of the hyperthermophilic eubacterium Thermotoga maritima. The molecule contains a globular head with an apparent diameter of 8 nm and a rod-shaped tail of 40 nm length. The sequence of the globular domain is homologous to a conserved region of cell wall-bound proteins and probably attaches Omp alpha to the peptidoglycan. The sequence of the rod domain resembles that of coiled coil proteins and ends in a transmembrane segment that anchors Omp alpha to the outer membrane. We have analysed Omp alpha by scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>) and by statistical sequence analysis methods. The Omp alpha rod is a tetramer with an unusual periodicity of hydrophobic residues close to 3.6 that differs from the 3.5 periodicity of canonical coiled coils. This is due to periodic omissions of three residues in the heptad repeat pattern ( stutters ) whose effect is to locally distort the packing of hydrophobic layers in the core of the coiled coil. Residues in position alpha are shifted to occupy a position halfway between positions alpha and d (x layers) and residues in positions d and e are shifted so that both participate in core packing interactions (da layers). Such distorted layers are frequently found in helical bundles and are characteristic of helices that do not undergo supercoiling. The only homo-oligomeric coiled coil of known structure which contains x and da layers is the three-stranded coiled coil of influenza haemagglutinin. Using geometric constraints derived from this structure, we have built a model for the Omp alpha rod in which the helices have a crossing angle of less than 15 degrees and maintain a residual degree of supercoiling with a pitch of approximately 40 nm. Our analysis of distorted layers in the hydrophobic core of coiled coils and helical bundles shows that stutters must not be viewed as discontinuities but rather as a departure from the canonical  knobs-into-holes  packing that allows helices to interact at a low angle without supercoiling. Although stutters have been considered to weaken helical interactions, their occurrence in a rigid, highly thermostable coiled coil indicates that this may not be generally true. Our analysis also indicates that skips and stutters are two different conventions for describing the same underlying structural feature.",M2
7584828,"The hemocyanin of the Californian black sea hare, Aplysia vaccaria Winkler.The hemocyanin of the Californian black sea hare. Aplysia vaccaria exists in solution largely as a di-decameric protein with a molecular weight of close to 8.0 x 10(6) and a sedimentation coefficient of about 92 S. Light-scattering measurements at pH 8.0, 0.1 M Tris, 0.05 M Mg2+, 0.01 M Ca2+ gave a molecular weight of 8.0 +/- 0.6 x 10(6), and scanning transmission electron microscopic determinations (<e>STEM</e>) gave a slightly higher particle mass of 8.49 +/- 0.41 x 10(6) daltons. Measurements using the STEM method gave a particle mass of 4.27 +/- 0.26 x 10(6) daltons for the dissociated half-molecules or decamers. Light-scattering measurements on the dissociated monomers at pH 11.1 and in 8.0 M urea gave molecular weights of 4.74 x 10(5). Sedimentation measurements in the presence of 0.01 M Mg2+ indicate that the hemocyanin of A. vaccaria is largely in the di-decameric form in the pH region from about 5.0 to 8.0. Above pH 8.0 the hemocyanin di-decamers are found to dissociate to half-molecules or decamers, followed by dissociation to dimers and monomers as the pH is increased above pH 9.0.",M2
7711329,"Shadow images for in-line holography in a <e>STEM</e> instrument.In a dedicated STEM instrument equipped with a field emission gun, shadow images are easily obtained and have many uses. They are very sensitive to misalignment of the instrument and astigmatism, and therefore can be used for rapid and accurate alignment of the microscope. For crystalline materials, the shadow image contains both the bright-field and dark-field images. It is a summation of the transmitted and diffracted beams, and is basically a kind of Gabor's in-line hologram. Under small or medium defocus, shadow images of a thin, well-orientated crystalline specimen take the characteristic form of Ronchigrams, which offer a unique means to calibrate the microscope operation parameters, such as the spherical aberration coefficient Cs and defocus settings of the objective lens, with high accuracy. With the calibrated values of Cs and delta, a transfer function of the objective lens may be generated. In the stage of numerical reconstruction, by adapting this transfer function to the experimentally recorded hologram the lens aberration introduced in forming the hologram may be corrected and an improved resolution may be achieved for electron microscope images.",M2
7520749,"Mapping the lipoyl groups of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex by use of gold cluster labels and scanning transmission electron microscopy.This paper describes the organization of lipoyl moieties within the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) complex from Escherichia coli as studied in the scanning transmission electron microscope (<e>STEM</e>). The PDH complex is a multienzyme complex consisting of E1, pyruvate dehydrogenase, E2, dihydrolipoyl transacetylase, and E3, dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase. The core of the complex is the cubic 24-subunit E2 component, which contains the lipoyl moieties bonded to lipoyl-bearing domains. E1 and E3 are associated along the edges (E1) and on the faces (E3) of the core. The lipoyl moieties were reduced with NADH and alkylated with a p-maleimidobenzoyl undecagold cluster complex. The gold labels were found to be bound very nearly specifically by dihydrolipoyl transacetylase (E2). Undecagold clusters were imaged directly by the STEM and also digitally mapped by radial mass analysis. The mass of the E2E3 subcomplex is about half that of the PDH complex. The PDH complex and GC-PDH are both about 420 A in diameter, as determined by radial mass analysis, and the E2E3 subcomplex and GC-E2E3 are 320 and 350 A, respectively. The outer boundary of the E2E3 subcomplex was clearly shown in STEM micrographs by the undecagold labels in GC-E2E3. Data obtained from radial mass analysis of GC-E2E3 and the unlabeled E2E3 subcomplex also showed that the size of the subcomplex is extended by the lipoyl-bearing domains surrounding the central E2 core. The capabilities of lipoyl moieties to undergo translocation over long distances through structural mobility in the lipoyl-bearing domains was confirmed by the observation that many of the lipoyl groups in E2E3 subcomplexes relax outward into space vacated by the removal of E1 during the preparation of the subcomplex from PDH complex. Radial mass analysis of the PDH complex and GC-PDH indicates that lipoyl groups are distributed over a large region of the PDH complex, extending from the central core to 170-180 A from the center of the complex, with the highest density at about 75 A from the particle centers, near the interface between E2 and the associated components E1 and E3.",M2
8051711,"Structure of phosphorylase kinase. A three-dimensional model derived from stained and unstained electron micrographs.Phosphorylase kinase, the first protein kinase discovered, is a key regulatory enzyme in glycogen metabolism. Although its biochemical properties are well characterized, details of its three-dimensional structure and subunit topology are yet to be elucidated. This study describes four characteristic views of the hexadecameric holoenzyme (alpha 4 beta 4 gamma 4 delta 4) as observed in both negatively stained and unstained electron micrographs. The predominant views are the widely reported  butterfly  with two wing-like lobes connected by thin bridges, and the previously described  chalice , composed of  cup  and  <e>stem</e>  segments. Two additional views, a  cube , similar to the previously reported  tetrad , and a  cross  or  X  are less common, but illustrate the overall geometry of the particle. Based on these images, the first three-dimensional model of the enzyme has been constructed. It is composed of four identical protomers that associate with D2 symmetry to form the two major structural elements (the two lobes). Two protomers in a head to head arrangement make up each symmetrical lobe; to complete the holoenzyme, one lobe is inverted and placed perpendicular to the other. Thus, the overall structure has three 2-fold axes of symmetry, and the arrangement of the four protomers approximates a tetrahedron. Each lobe of the model corresponds to a wing of the butterfly projection. Two projections form the chalice: in the intra-lobe orientation, one lobe forms the cup and the other forms the stem, and in the inter-lobe view, one-half of each lobe contributes to each segment of the image. The cube and cross projections result from 90 degrees rotations from the butterfly orientation. In the cube, the distal portions of each lobe are projected separately. In the cross, one lobe is crossed over and is above the other. This model both accounts for and predicts all of the observed microscopic images.",M2
7880651,"A structure for the signal sequence binding protein SRP54: 3D reconstruction from <e>STEM</e> images of single molecules.The 54-kDa subunit SRP54 of the signal recognition particle in eukaryotic cells is responsible for the recognition of nascent proteins destined for secretion or membrane integration. The three-dimensional structure of this protein was determined using computational techniques applied to images of the molecule obtained via high-resolution, low-dose, scanning transmission electron microscopy at low temperature. The reconstructions at spatial resolutions between 12 and 15 A feature two unequal domains joined by a slender linker. The two-domain structure is in agreement with genetic and biochemical data indicating organization of SRP54 into a larger N-terminal GTP-binding region and a smaller C-terminal peptide-binding region. The structure has similarities to other protein domains with related functions and similar amino acid sequences. The larger domain of the 3D reconstruction is consistent in shape and size with the GTP-binding domains of EF-Tu and p21-RAS, while the smaller domain is compatible in structure with part of the peptide-binding protein calmodulin. The overall shape of SRP54 and the deduced location of critical functional regions of the molecule provide a structural framework for its known biochemical properties in the targeting cycle of the signal recognition particle.",M2
7749612,"The molecular weight and subunit organization of Helisoma trivolvis (Say) hemoglobin: light-scattering and scanning transmission electron microscopic studies.The hemoglobin of the freshwater snail, Helisoma trivolvis has a molecular weight of 1.77(+/- 0.04) x 10(6) Da as determined by light-scattering measurements at 630 nm. Scanning transmission electron microscopic measurements gave nearly the same particle mass of 1.85(+/- 0.24) x 10(6) Da. The molecular weight of the denatured hemoglobin in 6.0 M GdmCl is found to be 3.96 x 10(5) Da, which is close to one-fifth of the mass of the parent hemoglobin. The molecular weight data based on light-scattering and <e>STEM</e> microscopy is consistent with a 10-subunit structure comprising five disulfide-linked dimers, as opposed to a 12-subunit assembly proposed by Ilan et al. (1986), which would necessitate a higher particle mass. Analysis of the molecular weight and the sedimentation data of H. trivolvis hemoglobin, suggests a compact two-layer ring structure of decamers of about 200 A to 250 A diameter, stabilized by disulfide-linkages between the subunits of the two pentameric layers.",M2
8819881,"Target geometry dependence of electron energy loss spectra in scanning transmission electron microscopy (<e>STEM</e>).In the frame of the Self-Energy formalism, we study the interaction between STEM electrons and small particles in the range of the valence electron excitations. We first calculate the energy loss probability for an isolated sphere and study the loss spectrum dependence on the size of the particle and on the relative impact parameter. Then we analyze the loss spectra in more realistic situations: (a) the effect of the coupling between the particle and supporting surface is studied in a simple geometrical model; and (b) we analyze the dependence of the losses on the geometrical shape of the target by considering hemispherical particle. Our results are in a good qualitative (and in simple cases, quantitative too) agreement with several experimental results which show anomalous excitations. We restate the suitability of the dielectric theory to study the surface excitations of these systems.",M2
7897645,"Quantitative water mapping of cryosectioned cells by electron energy-loss spectroscopy.A direct technique based on electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) in the scanning transmission electron microscope (<e>STEM</e>) has been developed to map subcellular distributions of water in frozen-hydrated biological cryosections. Previously, methods for water determination have been indirect in that they have required the cryosections to be dehydrated first. The new approach makes use of spectrum-imaging, where EELS data are collected in parallel at each pixel. Several operations are required to process the spectra including: subtraction of the detector dark current, deconvolution by the detector point-spread function, removal of plural inelastic scattering and correction for the support film. The resulting single scattering distributions are fitted to standard reference spectra at each pixel, and water content can be determined from the fitting coefficients. Although the darkfield or brightfield image from a hydrated cryosection shows minimal structure, the processed EELS image reveals strong contrast due to variations in water content. Reference spectra have been recorded from the major biomolecules (protein, lipid, carbohydrate, nucleic acid) as well as from vitrified water and crystalline ice. It has been found that quantitative results can be obtained for the majority of subcellular compartments by fitting only water and protein reference spectra, and the accuracy of the method for these compartments has been estimated as +/- 3.5%. With the present instrumentation the maximum allowed dose of 2 x 10(3) e/nm2 limits the useful spatial resolution to around 80 nm for +/- 5% precision at a single pixel. By averaging pixel intensities a value of 56.8% with a precision of +/- 2.0% has been determined for the water content of liver mitochondria. The water mapping technique may prove useful for applications to cell physiology and pathophysiology.",M2
