20096828,"<e>Phosphorylase</e>-catalyzed N-formyl-alpha-glucosaminylation of maltooligosaccharides.This paper describes the phosphorylase-catalyzed enzymatic N-formyl-alpha-glucosaminylation of maltooligosaccharides for direct incorporation of 2-deoxy-2-formamido-alpha-D-glucopyranose units into maltooligosaccharides. When the reaction of 2-deoxy-2-formamido-alpha-D-glucopyranose-1-phosphate (GlcNF-1-P) as the glycosyl donor and maltotetraose as a glycosyl acceptor was performed in the presence of phosphorylase, the N-formyl-alpha-D-glucosaminylated pentasaccharide was produced, as confirmed by MALDI-TOF MS. Furthermore, the glucoamylase-catalyzed reaction of the crude products supported that the 2-deoxy-2-formamido-alpha-D-glucopyranoside unit was positioned at the non-reducing end of the pentasaccharide. The pentasaccharide was isolated from the crude products and its structure was further determined by the (1)H NMR analysis. On the other hand, when the phosphorylase-catalyzed reactions of maltotriose and maltopentaose using GlcNF-1-P were conducted, no N-formyl-alpha-glucosaminylation took place in the former system, whereas the latter system gave N-formyl-alpha-D-glucosaminylated oligosaccharides with various degrees of polymerization. These results could be explained by the recognition behavior of phosphorylase toward maltooligosaccharides.",M1
20045390,"Rice endosperm-specific plastidial alpha-glucan <e>phosphorylase</e> is important for synthesis of short-chain malto-oligosaccharides.Previous genetic studies have indicated that the type L alpha-glucan phosphorylase (Pho1) has an essential role during the initiation process of starch biosynthesis during rice seed development. To gain insight into its role in starch metabolism, we characterized the enzymatic properties of the Pho1 recombinant form. Pho1 has significantly higher catalytic efficiency toward both linear and branched alpha-glucans in the synthesis direction than in the degradation direction with equilibrium constants for the various substrates ranging from 13 to 45. Pho1 activity is strongly inhibited by its own reaction product (Pi) in the synthesis reaction (K(i)=0.69 mM) when amylopectin is the primer substrate, but this inhibition is less pronounced (K(i)=14.2 mM) when short alpha-glucan chains are used as primers. Interestingly, even in the presence of Pi alone, Pho1 not only degrades maltohexaose but also extends them to synthesize longer MOSs. Production of a broad spectrum of MOSs (G4-G19) was stimulated by both Pi and Glc1P in an additive fashion. Thus, even under physiological conditions of high Pi/Glc1P, Pho1 extends the chain length of short MOSs which can then be used as subsequent primer by starch synthase activities. As ADP-glucose strongly inhibits Pho1 activity, Pho1 likely operates only during the initial stage and not during maturation phase of starch synthesis.",M1
20028468,"Glucose 1-phosphate is efficiently taken up by potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber parenchyma cells and converted to reserve starch granules.Reserve starch is an important plant product but the actual biosynthetic process is not yet fully understood. Potato (Solanum tuberosum) tuber discs from various transgenic plants were used to analyse the conversion of external sugars or sugar derivatives to starch. By using in vitro assays, a direct glucosyl transfer from glucose 1-phosphate to native starch granules as mediated by recombinant plastidial <e>phosphorylase</e> was analysed. Compared with labelled glucose, glucose 6-phosphate or sucrose, tuber discs converted externally supplied [(14)C]glucose 1-phosphate into starch at a much higher rate. Likewise, tuber discs from transgenic lines with a strongly reduced expression of cytosolic phosphoglucomutase, phosphorylase or transglucosidase converted glucose 1-phosphate to starch with the same or even an increased rate compared with the wild-type. Similar results were obtained with transgenic potato lines possessing a strongly reduced activity of both the cytosolic and the plastidial phosphoglucomutase. Starch labelling was, however, significantly diminished in transgenic lines, with a reduced concentration of the plastidial phosphorylase isozymes. Two distinct paths of reserve starch biosynthesis are proposed that explain, at a biochemical level, the phenotype of several transgenic plant lines.",M1
19850285,"One-pot enzymatic production of beta-D-galactopyranosyl-(1--&gt;3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose (galacto-N-biose) from sucrose and 2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose (N-acetylgalactosamine).Beta-D-Galactopyranosyl-(1--&gt;3)-2-acetamido-2-deoxy-D-galactose (galacto-N-biose, GNB) is an important core structure in functional sugar chains such as T-antigen disaccharide and the core 1 sugar chain in mucin glycoproteins. We successfully developed a one-pot enzymatic production of GNB from sucrose and GalNAc by the concomitant action of four enzymes: sucrose <e>phosphorylase</e>, UDP-glucose-hexose 1-phosphate uridylyltransferase, UDP-glucose 4-epimerase, and galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase in the presence of UDP-glucose and phosphate, by modifying the method of lacto-N-biose I production [Nishimoto, M.; Kitaoka, M., Biosci. Biotechnol. Biochem., 2007, 71, 2101-2104]. The reaction yield of GNB was 88% from GalNAc. GNB was isolated from the reaction mixture by crystallization after yeast treatment to obtain approximately 45 g of GNB in 95% purity from a 280-mL reaction mixture.",M1
19824696,"Kinetic studies of HPr, HPr(H15D), HPr(H15E), and HPr(His approximately P) phosphorylation by the Streptococcus salivarius HPr(Ser) kinase/<e>phosphorylase</e>.HPr is a central protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). In streptococci, HPr can be phosphorylated at His(15) at the expense of PEP by enzyme I (EI) of the PTS, producing HPr(His approximately P). HPr can also be phosphorylated at Ser(46) by the ATP-dependent HPr(Ser) kinase/phosphorylase (HprK/P), producing HPr(Ser-P). Lastly, HPr can be phosphorylated on both residues, producing HPr(Ser-P)(His approximately P) (HPr-P2). We report here a study on the phosphorylation of Streptococcus salivarius HPr, HPr(H15D), HPr(H15E), and HPr(His approximately P) by HprK/P to assess the involvement of HprK/P in the synthesis of HPr-P2 in streptococcal cells. We first developed a spectrophotometric method for measuring HprK/P kinase activity. Using this assay, we found that the K(m) of HprK/P for HPr at pH 7.4 and 37 degrees C was approximately 110 muM, with a specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m)) of 1.7 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1). The specificity constants for HPr(H15D) and HPr(H15E) were approximately 13 times lower. Kinetic studies conducted under conditions where HPr(His approximately P) was stable (i.e., pH 8.6 and 15 degrees C) showed that HPr(His approximately P) was a poorer substrate for HprK/P than HPr(H15D), the k(cat)/K(m) for HPr(H15D) and HPr(His approximately P) being approximately 9 and 26 times lower than that for HPr, respectively. Our results suggested that (i) the inefficiency of the phosphorylation of HPr(His approximately P) by HprK/P results from the presence of a negative charge at position 15 as well as from other structural elements and (ii) the contribution of streptococcal HprK/P to the synthesis of HPr-P2 in vivo is marginal.",M1
19682609," Short-chain  alpha-1,4-glucan <e>phosphorylase</e> having a truncated N-terminal domain: functional expression and characterization of the enzyme from Sulfolobus solfataricus.All known alpha-1,4-glucan phosphorylases (GPs) are active as homodimers and use their N-terminal domains for oligomerisation. Structure-based sequence comparison of a putative phosphorylase from the thermophilic crenarchaeon Sulfolobus solfataricus (SsGP) with the well characterized GP from Escherichia coli reveals that SsGP totally lacks the otherwise conserved regions for building the dimer interface. Because all efforts of producing functional SsGP in E. coli failed, we used heterologous gene expression in the hyperthermophilic archaeon Thermococcus kodakaraensis and isolated, in low amounts, SsGP harboring Strep-Tag II fused to the C-terminal Tyr-465 of the enzyme. The recombinant protein eluted in size exclusion chromatography with an apparent molecular mass of approximately 69 kDa, consistent with neither the mass expected for a monomer (55 kDa) nor that of a homodimer (110 kDa). The biochemical properties of SsGP were similar to those seen for other GPs containing the N-terminal elements for dimerisation, suggesting that the  short-chain  format of SsGP is fully appropriate for phosphorylase catalytic function and stability. However, the substrate specificity of SsGP differed from that reported for GPs from other thermophilic microorganisms.",M1
19637153,"Preparation of glycogen-based polysaccharide materials by <e>phosphorylase</e>-catalyzed chain elongation of glycogen.Facile preparation of glycogen-based polysaccharide gel materials was carried out by phosphorylase-catalyzed chain elongation of glycogen using glucose 1-phosphate (Glc-1-P). The resulting solution after the enzymatic reaction gradually turned into a hydrogel form, which was probably caused by formation of junction zones based on the double helix structure of the elongated amylose chains among the glycogen molecules. Furthermore, lyophilization of the hydrogel resulted in formation of a glycogen-based xerogel. The mechanical properties of the hydrogels and xerogels were affected by the amount of glycogen and the Glc-1-P/glycogen ratio in the feed for the enzymatic reaction. The xerogel was also subjected to film formation and re-hydrogelation with appropriate techniques.",M1
19629712,"Enzymatic production of alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate by lactose phosphorolysis.alpha-D-Galactose 1-phosphate (alphaGal1P) is an important building block for the synthesis of nucleotide sugars that are substrates for glycosyltransferases. We have previously reported the creation of novel lactose <e>phosphorylase</e> enzymes that are useful for the synthesis of alphaGal1P from the cheap and abundant lactose. Here we describe the application of such a lactose phosphorylase in a production system using permeabilized Escherichia coli cells. After purification of the product from the reaction mixture by anion-exchange chromatography and ethanol precipitation, 9.5 grams of highly pure alphaGal1P were obtained from a 1 l reaction volume.",M1
19491100,"Characterization of three beta-galactoside <e>phosphorylases</e> from Clostridium phytofermentans: discovery of d-galactosyl-beta1-&gt;4-l-rhamnose phosphorylase.We characterized three d-galactosyl-beta1--&gt;3-N-acetyl-d-hexosamine phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.211) homologs from Clostridium phytofermentans (Cphy0577, Cphy1920, and Cphy3030 proteins). Cphy0577 and Cphy3030 proteins exhibited similar activity on galacto-N-biose (GNB; d-Gal-beta1--&gt;3-d-GalNAc) and lacto-N-biose I (LNB; d-Gal-beta1--&gt;3-d-GlcNAc), thus indicating that they are d-galactosyl-beta1--&gt;3-N-acetyl-d-hexosamine phosphorylases, subclassified as GNB/LNB phosphorylase. In contrast, Cphy1920 protein phosphorolyzed neither GNB nor LNB. It showed the highest activity with l-rhamnose as the acceptor in the reverse reaction using alpha-d-galactose 1-phosphate as the donor. The reaction product was d-galactosyl-beta1--&gt;4-l-rhamnose. The enzyme also showed activity on l-mannose, l-lyxose, d-glucose, 2-deoxy-d-glucose, and d-galactose in this order. When d-glucose derivatives were used as acceptors, reaction products were beta-1,3-galactosides. Kinetic parameters of phosphorolytic activity on d-galactosyl-beta1--&gt;4-l-rhamnose were k(cat) = 45 s(-1) and K(m) = 7.9 mm, thus indicating that these values are common among other phosphorylases. We propose d-galactosyl-beta1--&gt;4-l-rhamnose phosphorylase as the name for Cphy1920 protein.",M1
19487233,"Creating lactose <e>phosphorylase</e> enzymes by directed evolution of cellobiose phosphorylase.Disaccharide phosphorylases are interesting enzymes for the production of sugar phosphates from cheap starting materials and for the synthesis of novel glycosides. Cellobiose phosphorylase (CP) from Cellulomonas uda was subjected to directed evolution in order to create enzyme variants with significantly increased lactose phosphorylase (LP) activity, useful for the production of alpha-D-galactose 1-phosphate. In a first round, random mutagenesis was performed on part of the CP gene and the resultant library was selected on minimal lactose medium. One clone containing six amino acid mutations was found with increased LP activity compared with the wild-type CP enzyme. The negative and neutral mutations were eliminated by site-directed mutagenesis and the resultant enzyme variant containing two amino acid substitutions (T508A/N667T) showed more LP activity than the parent mutant. Saturation mutagenesis of the beneficial sites and screening for improved mutants allowed us to identify the T508I/N667A mutant which has 7.5 times higher specific activity on lactose than the wild-type. The kinetic parameters of the mutants were determined and showed that the increased LP activity was caused by a higher k(cat) value. This is the first report of an engineered CP with modified substrate specificity.",M1
19256629,"Protein displacements under external forces: An atomistic Langevin dynamics approach.We present a fully atomistic Langevin dynamics approach as a method to simulate biopolymers under external forces. In the harmonic regime, this approach permits the computation of the long-term dynamics using only the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the Hessian matrix of second derivatives. We apply this scheme to identify polymorphs of model proteins by their mechanical response fingerprint, and we relate the averaged dynamics of proteins to their biological functionality, with the ion channel gramicidin A, a <e>phosphorylase</e>, and neuropeptide Y as examples. In an environment akin to dilute solutions, even small proteins show relaxation times up to 50 ns. Atomically resolved Langevin dynamics computations have been performed for the stretched gramicidin A ion channel.",M1
19202084,"Roles of maltodextrin and glycogen <e>phosphorylases</e> in maltose utilization and glycogen metabolism in Corynebacterium glutamicum.Corynebacterium glutamicum transiently accumulates large amounts of glycogen, when cultivated on glucose and other sugars as a source of carbon and energy. Apart from the debranching enzyme GlgX, which is required for the formation of maltodextrins from glycogen, alpha-glucan phosphorylases were assumed to be involved in glycogen degradation, forming alpha-glucose 1-phosphate from glycogen and from maltodextrins. We show here that C. glutamicum in fact possesses two alpha-glucan phosphorylases, which act as a glycogen phosphorylase (GlgP) and as a maltodextrin phosphorylase (MalP). By chromosomal inactivation and subsequent analysis of the mutant, cg1479 was identified as the malP gene. The deletion mutant C. glutamicum DeltamalP completely lacked MalP activity and showed reduced intracellular glycogen degradation, confirming the proposed pathway for glycogen degradation in C. glutamicum via GlgP, GlgX and MalP. Surprisingly, the DeltamalP mutant showed impaired growth, reduced viability and altered cell morphology on maltose and accumulated much higher concentrations of glycogen and maltodextrins than the wild-type during growth on this substrate, suggesting an additional role of MalP in maltose metabolism of C. glutamicum. Further assessment of enzyme activities revealed the presence of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase (MalQ), glucokinase (Glk) and alpha-phosphoglucomutase (alpha-Pgm), and the absence of maltose hydrolase, maltose phosphorylase and beta-Pgm, all three known to be involved in maltose utilization by Gram-positive bacteria. Based on these findings, we conclude that C. glutamicum metabolizes maltose via a pathway involving maltodextrin and glucose formation by MalQ, glucose phosphorylation by Glk and maltodextrin degradation via the reactions of MalP and alpha-Pgm, a pathway hitherto known to be present in Gram-negative rather than in Gram-positive bacteria.",M1
19149172,"[Expression, purification and crystallization of a truncated Saccharomyces cerevisiae diadenosion 5',5'''-P1,P4 -tetraphosphate <e>phosphorylase</e> I]OBJECTIVE: To obtain the crystal of 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate phosphorylase I (Apal) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae for X-ray crystal structure and function analysis. METHODS: We amplified the coding region of an N-terminally truncated version of Saccharomyces cerevisiae diadenosion 5',5'''-P1,P4-tetraphosphate phosphorylase I (Apaldnl6) , and cloned it into the pET28 derived expression vector. After having screened the recombinant plasmids by PCR and confirmed them by DNA sequencing, we transformed a positive recombinant plasmid into the Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) cells for efficient expression. Then the expression and solubility of the recombinant Apaldnl6 protein were analyzed by SDS-PAGE after proper concentration of IPTG induction. Following that, we collected the soluble Apaldnl6 protein and purified it to homogeneity by sequential Ni-NTA affinity chromatography and Superdex 75 gel filtration, and then detected the purity and molecular weight of the desired protein by SDS-PAGE and mass spectrometry . In addition, we screened the crystallization conditions of Apaldnl6 with Hampton Research kits using the hanging drop vapor diffusion method. RESULTS: We efficiently expressed an N-terminally truncated Saccharomyces cerevisiae diadenosion 5',5'''-P1, P4-tetraphosphate phosphorylase I in Escherichia coli BL21(DE3). The recombinant protein was partially soluble and was purified to homogeneity with a single band of approximately 36 kDa after SDS-PAGE. Mass spectrometry analysis further confirmed the purity and intactness of the recombinant protein.Moreover, we obtained the needle crystals of Apaldnl6 by hanging drop vapor diffusion method. CONCLUSION: Escherichia coli BL21(DE3) is an efficient expression system for producing enough quantity of Apaldnl6 protein. The purified recombinant Apaldnl6 protein is suitable for crystallization and further structural investigation.",M1

GLNBP homologues are often found in human pathogenic and commensal bacteria, and their substrate specificities potentially define the nutritional acquisition ability of these microbes in their habitat. We report the crystal structures of GLNBP in five different ligand-binding forms. This is the first three-dimensional structure of glycoside hydrolase (GH) family 112. The GlcNAc- and GalNAc-bound forms provide structural insights into distinct substrate preferences of GLNBP and its homologues from pathogens. The catalytic domain consists of a partially broken TIM barrel fold that is structurally similar to a thermophilic beta-galactosidase, strongly supporting the current classification of GLNBP homologues as one of the GH families. Anion binding induces a large conformational change by rotating a half-unit of the barrel. This is an unusual example of molecular adaptation of a TIM barrel scaffold to substrates.",M1

We report the recombinant production of an alpha-glucan/maltodextrin phosphorylase (PF1535) from a hyperthermophilic archaeon, Pyrococcus furiosus, and the first detailed biochemical characterization of this enzyme from any archaeal source using a mass-spectrometry-based assay. The apparent 98 kDa recombinant enzyme was active over a broad range of temperatures and pH, with optimal activity at 80 degrees C and pH 6.5-7. This archaeal protein retained its complete activity after 24 h at 80 degrees C in Tris-HCl buffer. Unlike other previously reported phosphorylases, the Ni-affinity column purified enzyme showed broad substrate specificity in both the synthesis and degradation of maltooligosaccharides. In the synthetic direction of the enzymatic reaction, the lowest oligosaccharide required for the chain elongation was maltose. In the degradative direction, the archaeal enzyme can produce glucose-1-phosphate from maltotriose or longer maltooligosaccharides including both glycogen and starch. The specific activity of the enzyme at 80 degrees C in the presence of 10 mM maltoheptaose and at 10 mg ml(-1) glycogen concentration was 52 U mg(-1) and 31 U mg(-1), respectively. The apparent Michaelis constant and maximum velocity for inorganic phosphate were 31 +/- 2 mM and 0.60 +/- 0.02 mM min(-1) microg(-1), respectively. An initial velocity study of the enzymatic reaction indicated a sequential bi-bi catalytic mechanism. Unlike the more widely studied mammalian glycogen phosphorylase, the Pyrococcus enzyme is active in the absence of added AMP.",M1
18997850,"Streptococci and lactococci synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).HPr is a protein of the phosphoenolpyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase transport system (PTS). In gram-positive bacteria, HPr can be phosphorylated on Ser-46 by the kinase/<e>phosphorylase</e> HprK/P and on His-15 by phospho-enzyme I (EI~P) of the PTS. In vitro studies with purified HPrs from Bacillus subtilis, Enterococcus faecalis, and Streptococcus salivarius have indicated that the phosphorylation of one residue impedes the phosphorylation of the other. However, a recent study showed that while the rate of Streptococcus salivarius HPr phosphorylation by EI~P is reduced at acidic pH, the phosphorylation of HPr(Ser-P) by EI~P, generating HPr(Ser-P)(His~P), is stimulated. This suggests that HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) synthesis may occur in acidogenic bacteria unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality. Consistent with this hypothesis, significant amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) have been detected in some streptococci. The present study was aimed at determining whether the capacity to synthesize HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) is common to streptococcal species, as well as to lactococci, which are also unable to maintain their intracellular pH near neutrality in response to a decrease in extracellular pH. Our results indicated that unlike Staphylococcus aureus, B. subtilis, and E. faecalis, all the streptococcal and lactococcal species tested were able to synthesize large amounts of HPr(Ser-P)(His~P) during growth. We also showed that Streptococcus salivarius IIABLMan, a protein involved in sugar transport by the PTS, could be efficiently phosphorylated by HPr(Ser-P)(His~P).",M1
18945272,"Ultrastructural differences and histochemical characteristics in swimming muscles between wild and reared Atlantic salmon.AIM: The swimming capacity of wild and reared fish differs. Whether the differences are associated with metabolic, contractile or structural variation in swimming musculature is unknown. In the present study, some aspects of contractile machinery in swimming muscles of wild and reared salmon are compared. METHODS: Several morphological parameters and key enzyme activities were measured using electron microscopy and histochemical methods. RESULTS: The density and size of the mitochondria was significantly higher in the muscle samples from wild fish when compared with the reared ones. Similar variability was also seen in the density of triads. Conversely, the size and density of lipid droplets was significantly lower in the red muscle of wild vs. reared salmon. The densities of two excitation contraction coupling components, dihydropyridine and ryanodine receptor, were considerably higher in swimming muscles of wild salmon than in reared fish. A similar difference was observed in the activities of aerobic enzymes. Moreover, oxygen consumption followed the same pattern, being significantly higher in the samples of wild salmon. <e>Phosphorylase</e> activity was, on the other hand, significantly lower in the muscles of wild fish. CONCLUSIONS: There are significant differences in morphology, Ca(2+)-regulating capacity and enzyme activities in swimming muscles between wild and reared salmon. These results provide evidence that the prerequisites for efficient contraction of the swimming muscles are better met in wild than in reared salmon. Importantly, the results also suggest that the observed variation is a major contributing factor to the difference in the swimming capacity between wild and hatchery-reared salmon.",M1

When the reaction of 2-amino-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucopyranosyl 1-phosphate as the glycosyl donor with maltotetraose as a glycosyl acceptor was performed in the presence of phosphorylase, glucosaminylated oligosaccharides were produced, which were characterized by MALDI-TOF MS measurement after N-acetylation of the crude products. The N-acetylated derivative of the main product in this system was isolated by using HPLC, and its structure was confirmed by MS and (1)H NMR spectra. Furthermore, glucoamylase-catalyzed reaction of the isolated compound provided support that the alpha-glucosamine unit is positioned at the non-reducing end of the oligosaccharide.",M1
18723650,"Identification of lacto-N-Biose I <e>phosphorylase</e> from Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6.A beta-1,3-galactosyl-N-acetylhexosamine phosphorylase (GalGlyNAcP) homolog gene was cloned from Vibrio vulnificus CMCP6. In synthetic reactions, the recombinant enzyme acted only with GlcNAc and GalNAc as acceptors in the presence of alpha-d-galactose-1-phosphate as a donor to form lacto-N-biose I (LNB) (Galbeta1 --&gt; 3GlcNAc) and galacto-N-biose (GNB) (Galbeta1 --&gt; 3GalNAc), respectively. GlcNAc was a much better acceptor than GalNAc. The enzyme also phosphorolysed LNB faster than it phosphorolysed GNB, and the k(cat)/K(m) for LNB was approximately 60 times higher than the k(cat)/K(m) for GNB. This result indicated that the enzyme was remarkably different from GalGlyNAcP from Bifidobacterium longum, which has similar activities with LNB and GNB, and GalGlyNAcP from Clostridium perfringens, which is a GNB-specific enzyme. The enzyme is the first LNB-specific enzyme that has been found and was designated lacto-N-biose I phosphorylase. The discovery of an LNB-specific GalGlyNAcP resulted in recategorization of bifidobacterial GalGlyNAcPs as galacto-N-biose/lacto-N-biose I phosphorylases.",M1
18650322,"Metabolic, enzymatic, and transporter responses in human muscle during three consecutive days of exercise and recovery.This study investigated the responses in substrate- and energy-based properties to repetitive days of prolonged submaximal exercise and recovery. Twelve untrained volunteers (Vo(2)(peak) = 44.8 +/- 2.0 ml.kg(-1).min(-1), mean +/- SE) cycled ( approximately 60 Vo(2)(peak)) on three consecutive days followed by 3 days of recovery. Tissue samples were extracted from the vastus lateralis both pre- and postexercise on day 1 (E1), day 3 (E3), and during recovery (R1, R2, R3) and were analyzed for changes in metabolism, substrate, and enzymatic and transporter responses. For the metabolic properties (mmol/kg(-1) dry wt), exercise on E1 resulted in reductions (P &lt; 0.05) in phosphocreatine (PCr; 80 +/- 1.9 vs. 41.2 +/- 3.0) and increases (P &lt; 0.05) in inosine monophosphate (IMP; 0.13 +/- 0.01 vs. 0.61 +/- 0.2) and lactate (3.1 +/- 0.4 vs. 19.2 +/- 4.3). At E3, both IMP and lactate were lower (P &lt; 0.05) during exercise. For the transporters, the experimental protocol resulted in a decrease (P &lt; 0.05) in glucose transporter-1 (GLUT1; 29% by R1), an increase in GLUT4 (29% by E3), and increases (P &lt; 0.05) for both monocarboxylate transporters (MCT) (for MCT1, 23% by R2 and for MCT4, 18% by R1). Of the mitochondrial and cytosolic enzyme activities examined, cytochrome c oxidase (COX), and hexokinase were both reduced (P &lt; 0.05) by exercise at E1 and in the case of hexokinase and <e>phosphorylase</e> by exercise on E3. With the exception at COX, which was lower (P &lt; 0.05) at R1, no differences in enzyme activities existed at rest between E, E3, and recovery days.

18621947,"Mutation of the plastidial alpha-glucan <e>phosphorylase</e> gene in rice affects the synthesis and structure of starch in the endosperm.Plastidial phosphorylase (Pho1) accounts for approximately 96% of the total phosphorylase activity in developing rice (Oryza sativa) seeds. From mutant stocks induced by N-methyl-N-nitrosourea treatment, we identified plants with mutations in the Pho1 gene that are deficient in Pho1. Strikingly, the size of mature seeds and the starch content in these mutants showed considerable variation, ranging from shrunken to pseudonormal. The loss of Pho1 caused smaller starch granules to accumulate and modified the amylopectin structure. Variation in the morphological and biochemical phenotype of individual seeds was common to all 15 pho1-independent homozygous mutant lines studied, indicating that this phenotype was caused solely by the genetic defect. The phenotype of the pho1 mutation was temperature dependent. While the mutant plants grown at 30 degrees C produced mainly plump seeds at maturity, most of the seeds from plants grown at 20 degrees C were shrunken, with a significant proportion showing severe reduction in starch accumulation. These results strongly suggest that Pho1 plays a crucial role in starch biosynthesis in rice endosperm at low temperatures and that one or more other factors can complement the function of Pho1 at high temperatures.",M1

18468611,"Simple protein purification through affinity adsorption on regenerated amorphous cellulose followed by intein self-cleavage.A simple, low-cost, and scalable protein purification method was developed by using a biodegradable regenerated amorphous cellulose (RAC) with a binding capacity of up to 365 mg protein per gram of RAC.

In order to avoid using costly protease and simplify purification process, a self-cleavage intein was introduced between CBM and target protein. The cleaved target protein can be liberated from the surface of RAC by intein self-cleavage occurring through a pH change from 8.0 to 6.5.

18467871,"Characterization of a bifunctional HPr kinase/<e>phosphorylase</e> from Leuconostoc mesenteroides SY1.The hprK gene encoding bifunctional HPrK/P (kinase/ phosphorylase) was cloned from L. mesenteroides SY1, a strain isolated from kimchi. hprK was transcribed as a monocistronic gene. His-tagged HPrH16A and HPrK/P were produced in E. coli BL21(DE3) using pET26b(+) and purified. HPrK/P phosphorylation assay with purified proteins showed that the kinase activity of HPrK/P increased at slightly acidic pHs. Divalent cations such as Mg2+ and Mn2+ and glycolytic intermediates such as fructose-1, 6-bisphosphate (FBP) and phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) increased the kinase activity of HPrK/P, but inorganic phosphate strongly inhibited it. Kinetic studies for the kinase activity of HPrK/P showed that the apparent Km values were 0.18 and 14.57 microM for ATP and HPr, respectively. The Km value for the phosphorylase activity of HPrK/P was 14.16 microM for P-Ser-HPr (HPr phosphorylated at the serine residue).",M1
18189139,"The swimming performance of brown trout and whitefish: the effects of exercise on Ca2+ handling and oxidative capacity of swimming muscles.The swimming performance of two fish species, the brown trout and whitefish, having initially different swimming strategies, was measured after nine different training programs in order to relate the effects of exercise on Ca(2+) handling and oxidative capacity of swimming muscles. The time to 50% fatigue was measured during the training period, and compared with the density of dihydropyridine (DHP) and ryanodine (Ry) receptors and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) and <e>phosphorylase</e> activity determined by histochemical analysis of the swimming muscles. Overall, both trained brown trout and whitefish had superior swimming performance as compared to control ones. Interestingly, the training programs had different effect on the two species studied since brown trout achieved the highest swimming performance, swimming against the water flow velocity of 2 BL s(-1) while among whitefish the best efficiency was seen after training with lower swimming velocities. Training also induced a significant increase in DHP and Ry receptor density in both species. Generally, in brown trout the most notable increase in the receptor densities was observed in red muscle sections from the fish swimming for 6 weeks against water currents of 1 BL s(-1) (DHPR 176.5 +/- 7.7% and RyR 231.4 +/- 11.8%) and white muscle sections against 2 BL s(-1) (DHPR 129.6 +/- 12.4% and RyR 161.9 +/- 15.5%). In whitefish the most prominent alterations were noted in samples from both muscle types after 6 weeks of training against water current of 1.5 BL s(-1) (DHPR 167.1 +/- 16.9% and RyR 190.4 +/- 19.4%). Finally, after all the training regimens the activity of SDH increased but the phosphorylase activity decreased significantly in both the species. To conclude, our findings demonstrate an improved swimming performance and enhanced Ca(2+) regulation and oxidative capacity after training. Moreover, there seems to be a connection between the swimming performance and receptor levels, especially in white swimming muscles of different fish species, regardless of their initially deviant swimming behaviours. However, depending on the training regimen the divergent swimming behaviours do cause a different response, resulting in the most prominent adaptational changes in the receptor levels of red muscle samples with lower swimming velocities in brown trout and with higher ones in whitefish.",M1
18183385,"Identification of galacto-N-biose <e>phosphorylase</e> from Clostridium perfringens ATCC13124.Lacto-N-biose phosphorylase (LNBP) from bifidobacteria is involved in the metabolism of lacto-N-biose I (Galbeta1--&gt;3GlcNAc, LNB) and galacto-N-biose (Galbeta1--&gt;3GalNAc, GNB). A homologous gene of LNBP (CPF0553 protein) was identified in the genome of Clostridium perfringens ATCC13124, which is a gram-positive anaerobic intestinal bacterium. In the present study, we cloned the gene and compared the substrate specificity of the CPF0553 protein with LNBP from Bifidobacterium longum JCM1217 (LNBPBl). In the presence of alpha-galactose 1-phosphate (Gal 1-P) as a donor, the CPF0553 protein acted only on GlcNAc and GalNAc, and GalNAc was a more effective acceptor than GlcNAc. The reaction product from GlcNAc/GalNAc and Gal 1-P was identified as LNB or GNB. The CPF0553 protein also phosphorolyzed GNB much faster than LNB, which suggests that the protein should be named galacto-N-biose phosphorylase (GNBP). GNBP showed a kcat/Km value for GNB that was approximately 50 times higher than that for LNB, whereas LNBPBl showed similar kcat/Km values for both GNB and LNB. Because C. perfringens possesses a gene coding endo-alpha-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, GNBP may play a role in the intestinal residence by metabolizing GNB that is available as a mucin core sugar.",M1
17921247,"A glycosyltransferase with a length-controlling activity as a mechanism to regulate the size of polysaccharides.Cyclic beta-1,2-glucans (CbetaG) are osmolyte homopolysaccharides with a cyclic beta-1,2-backbone of 17-25 glucose residues present in the periplasmic space of several bacteria. Initiation, elongation, and cyclization, the three distinctive reactions required for building the cyclic structure, are catalyzed by the same protein, the CbetaG synthase. The initiation activity catalyzes the transference of the first glucose from UDP-glucose to a yet-unidentified amino acid residue in the same protein. Elongation proceeds by the successive addition of glucose residues from UDP-glucose to the nonreducing end of the protein-linked beta-1,2-oligosaccharide intermediate. Finally, the protein-linked intermediate is cyclized, and the cyclic glucan is released from the protein. These reactions do not explain, however, the mechanism by which the number of glucose residues in the cyclic structure is controlled. We now report that control of the degree of polymerization (DP) is carried out by a beta-1,2-glucan <e>phosphorylase</e> present at the CbetaG synthase C-terminal domain. This last activity catalyzes the phosphorolysis of the beta-1,2-glucosidic bond at the nonreducing end of the linear protein-linked intermediate, releasing glucose 1-phosphate. The DP is thus regulated by this  length-controlling  phosphorylase activity. To our knowledge, this is the first description of a control of the DP of homopolysaccharides.",M1

17878158,"Structural analysis of the bacterial HPr kinase/<e>phosphorylase</e> V267F mutant gives insights into the allosteric regulation mechanism of this bifunctional enzyme.The HPr kinase/phosphorylase (HPrK/P) is a bifunctional enzyme that controls the phosphorylation state of the phospho-carrier protein HPr, which regulates the utilization of carbon sources in Gram-positive bacteria. It uses ATP or pyrophosphate for the phosphorylation of serine 46 of HPr and inorganic phosphate for the dephosphorylation of Ser(P)-46-HPr via a phosphorolysis reaction. HPrK/P is a hexameric protein kinase of a new type with a catalytic core belonging to the family of nucleotide-binding protein with Walker A motif. It exhibits no structural similarity to eukaryotic protein kinases. So far, HPrK/P structures have shown the enzyme in its phosphorylase conformation. They permitted a detailed characterization of the phosphorolysis mechanism. In the absence of a structure with bound nucleotide, we used the V267F mutant enzyme to assess the kinase conformation. Indeed, the V267F replacement was found to cause an almost entire loss of the phosphorylase activity of Lactobacillus casei HPrK/P. In contrast, the kinase activity remained conserved. To elucidate the structural alterations leading to this drastic change of activity, the x-ray structure of the catalytic domain of L. casei HPrK/P-V267F was determined at 2.6A resolution. A comparison with the structure of the wild type enzyme showed that the mutation induces conformation changes compatible with the switch from phosphorylase to kinase function. Together with nucleotide binding fluorescence measurements, these results allowed us to decipher the cooperative behavior of the protein and to gain new insights into the allosteric regulation mechanism of HPrK/P.",M1
17666166,"Novel starch-related enzymes and carbohydrates.In chloroplasts, both biosynthesis and degradation of starch are strictly regulated but the mechanisms involved are still incompletely understood. Recent studies revealed two novel and regulatory relevant aspects in the biochemistry of starch: the phosphorylation of starch and the starch-related metabolism of cytosolic heteroglycans. Starch phosphorylation occurs by a sequential action of two plastidial enzymes, the glucan, water dikinase (GWD; EC 2.7.9.4) and the phosphoglucan, water dikinase (PWD; EC 2.7.9.5). Both enzymes utilize ATP as dual phosphate donor and transfer the terminal phosphate group to water whereas the beta-phosphate is used for esterification of glucosyl moieties. The metabolism of starch-derived degradation products is closely linked to recently discovered cytosolic heteroglycans that possess, as prominent constituents, arabinose, galactose, glucose and fucose. The pattern of glycosidic linkages is highly complex comprising more than 25 different bonds. During the dark period the size distribution or the amount of the cytosolic heteroglycans increases depending on the plant species. As revealed by in vitro 14C labeling assays, the heteroglycans act as both glucosyl acceptors and donors for two cytosolic glucosyl transferases, the <e>phosphorylase</e> (EC 2.4.1.1) and the transglucosidase (EC 2.4.1.25) and, at least in part, both enzymes utilize the same glucosyl acceptor and donor sites. In mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana L. that are deficient in the cytosolic transglucosidase both the structure and (bio)chemical properties of the heteroglycans are altered.",M1

The phosphorylase activities in P. sibirica and B. scorpii differ significantly both in form and the total activity of this enzyme. Dependence of the phosphorylase reaction rate on substrate concentration is studied.

17650589,"Role of pectin from cucumber (Cucumis sativus) in modulation of protein kinase C activity and regulation of glycogen metabolism in rats.The regulatory role of protein kinase C (PKC) in glycogen metabolism in pectin fed rats was investigated. Administration of pectin (5 g/kg body wt/day) from cucumber (Cucumis sativius L.) led to inhibitory effects on PKC activity in the liver of rats. In the brain and pancreas, PKC activity was significantly higher in pectin-treated rats as compared to the control group. Level of blood glucose was significantly lowered and the level of glycogen in the liver was significantly increased in pectin-administered rats. Glycogen synthase activity was enhanced, while glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> enzyme showed inhibition in pectin-treated rats. Results indicated that pectin administration might have caused an increase in the secretion of the insulin, which, in turn, had a stimulatory effect on the PKC activity in the pancreas.

17579833,"Stimulation of glycogen synthesis and inactivation of <e>phosphorylase</e> in hepatocytes by serotonergic mechanisms, and counter-regulation by atypical antipsychotic drugs.AIMS/HYPOTHESIS: Intraportal infusion of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) or inhibitors of its cellular uptake stimulate hepatic glucose uptake in vivo by either direct or indirect mechanisms. The aims of this study were to determine the direct effects of 5-HT in hepatocytes and to test the hypothesis that atypical antipsychotic drugs that predispose to type 2 diabetes counter-regulate the effects of 5-HT. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Rat hepatocytes were studied in short-term primary culture. RESULTS: Serotonin (5-HT) stimulated glycogen synthesis at nanomolar concentrations but inhibited it at micromolar concentrations. The stimulatory effect was mimicked by alpha-methyl-5-HT, a mixed 5-HT1/5-HT2 receptor agonist, whereas the inhibition was counteracted by a 5-HT2B/2C receptor antagonist. alpha-Methyl-5-HT stimulated glycogen synthesis additively with insulin, but unlike insulin, did not stimulate glucose phosphorylation and glycolysis, nor did it cause Akt (protein kinase B) phosphorylation. Stimulation of glycogen synthesis by alpha-methyl-5-HT correlated with depletion of phosphorylase a. This effect could not be explained by elevated levels of glucose 6-phosphate, which causes inactivation of phosphorylase, but was explained, at least in part, by decreased phosphorylase kinase activity in situ. The antipsychotic drugs clozapine and olanzapine, which bind to 5-HT receptors, counteracted the effect of alpha-methyl-5-HT on phosphorylase inactivation. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: This study provides evidence for both stimulation and inhibition of glycogen synthesis in hepatocytes by serotonergic mechanisms. The former effects are associated with the inactivation of phosphorylase and are counteracted by atypical antipsychotic drugs that cause hepatic insulin resistance. Antagonism of hepatic serotonergic mechanisms may be a component of the hepatic dysregulation caused by antipsychotic drugs that predispose to type 2 diabetes.",M1

17502927,"A novel alpha-glucosidase from the moss Scopelophila cataractae.Scopelophila cataractae is a rare moss that grows on copper-containing soils. S. cataractae protonema was grown on basal MS medium containing copper. A starch-degrading activity was detected in homogenates of the protonema, after successive extraction with phosphate buffer and buffer containing 3 M LiCl. Buffer-soluble extract (BS) and LiCl-soluble extract (LS) readily hydrolyzed amylopectin to liberate only glucose, which shows that alpha-glucosidase (EC 3.2.1.20) in BS and LS hydrolyzed amylopectin. The K(m) value of BS for maltose was 0.427. The K(m) value of BS for malto-oligosaccharide decreased with an increase in the molecular mass of the substrate. The value for maltohexaose was 0.106, which is about four-fold lower than that for maltose. BS was divided into two fractions of alpha-glucosidase (BS-1 and BS-2) by isoelectric focusing. The isoelectric points of these two enzymes were determined to be 4.36 (BS-1) and 5.25 (BS-2) by analytical gel electrofocusing. The two enzymes readily hydrolyzed malto-oligosaccharides. The two enzymes also hydrolyzed amylose, amylopectin and soluble starch at a rate similar to that with maltose. The two enzymes readily hydrolyzed panose to liberate glucose and maltose (1 : 1), and the K(m) value of BS for panose was similar to that for maltotriose, whereas the enzymes hydrolyzed isomaltose only weakly. With regard to substrate specificity, the two enzymes in BS are novel alpha-glucosidases. The two enzymes also hydrolyzed beta-limit dextrin, which has many alpha-1,6-glucosidic linkages near the non-reducing ends, more strongly than maltose, which shows that they do not need a debranching enzyme for starch digestion. The starch-degrading activity of BS was not inhibited by p-chloromercuribenzoic acid or alpha-amylase inhibitor. When amylopectin was treated with BS and LS in phosphate buffer, pH 6.0, glucose, but not glucose-1-phosphate, was detected, showing that the extracts did not contain <e>phosphorylase</e> but did contain an alpha-glucosidase. These results show that alpha-glucosidases should be capable of complete starch digestion by themselves in cells of S. cataractae.",M1
17462988,"Arabidopsis VTC2 encodes a GDP-L-galactose <e>phosphorylase</e>, the last unknown enzyme in the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway to ascorbic acid in plants.The first committed step in the biosynthesis of L-ascorbate from D-glucose in plants requires conversion of GDP-L-galactose to L-galactose 1-phosphate by a previously unidentified enzyme. Here we show that the protein encoded by VTC2, a gene mutated in vitamin C-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana strains, is a member of the GalT/Apa1 branch of the histidine triad protein superfamily that catalyzes the conversion of GDP-L-galactose to L-galactose 1-phosphate in a reaction that consumes inorganic phosphate and produces GDP. In characterizing recombinant VTC2 from A. thaliana as a specific GDP-L-galactose/GDP-D-glucose phosphorylase, we conclude that enzymes catalyzing each of the ten steps of the Smirnoff-Wheeler pathway from glucose to ascorbate have been identified. Finally, we identify VTC2 homologs in plants, invertebrates, and vertebrates, suggesting that a similar reaction is used widely in nature.",M1
17018036,"Plastidial <e>phosphorylase</e> is required for normal starch synthesis in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii.Among the three distinct starch phosphorylase activities detected in Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, two distinct plastidial enzymes (PhoA and PhoB) are documented while a single extraplastidial form (PhoC) displays a higher affinity for glycogen as in vascular plants. The two plastidial phosphorylases are shown to function as homodimers containing two 91-kDa (PhoA) subunits and two 110-kDa (PhoB) subunits. Both lack the typical 80-amino-acid insertion found in the higher plant plastidial forms. PhoB is exquisitely sensitive to inhibition by ADP-glucose and has a low affinity for malto-oligosaccharides. PhoA is more similar to the higher plant plastidial phosphorylases: it is moderately sensitive to ADP-glucose inhibition and has a high affinity for unbranched malto-oligosaccharides. Molecular analysis establishes that STA4 encodes PhoB. Chlamydomonas reinhardtii strains carrying mutations at the STA4 locus display a significant decrease in amounts of starch during storage that correlates with the accumulation of abnormally shaped granules containing a modified amylopectin structure and a high amylose content. The wild-type phenotype could be rescued by reintroduction of the cloned wild-type genomic DNA, thereby demonstrating the involvement of phosphorylase in storage starch synthesis.",M1
16980562,"The role of cytosolic alpha-glucan <e>phosphorylase</e> in maltose metabolism and the comparison of amylomaltase in Arabidopsis and Escherichia coli.Transitory starch of leaves is broken down hydrolytically, making maltose the predominant form of carbon exported from chloroplasts at night. Maltose metabolism in the cytoplasm of Escherichia coli requires amylomaltase (MalQ) and maltodextrin phosphorylase (MalP). Possible orthologs of MalQ and MalP in the cytosol of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) were proposed as disproportionating enzyme (DPE2, At2g40840) and alpha-glucan phosphorylase (AtPHS2, At3g46970). In this article, we measured the activities of recombinant DPE2 and AtPHS2 proteins with various substrates; we show that maltose and a highly branched, soluble heteroglycan (SHG) are excellent substrates for DPE2 and propose that a SHG is the in vivo substrate for DPE2 and AtPHS2. In E. coli, MalQ and MalP preferentially use smaller maltodextrins (G(3)-G(7)) and we suggest that MalQ and DPE2 have similar, but nonidentical, roles in maltose metabolism. To study this, we complemented a MalQ(-) E. coli strain with DPE2 and found that the rescue was not complete. To investigate the role of AtPHS2 in maltose metabolism, we characterized a T-DNA insertion line of the AtPHS2 gene. The nighttime maltose level increased 4 times in the Atphs2-1 mutant. The comparison of maltose metabolism in Arabidopsis with that in E. coli and the comparison of the maltose level in plants lacking DPE2 or AtPHS2 indicate that an alternative route to metabolize the glucan residues in SHG exists. Other plant species also contain SHG, DPE2, and alpha-glucan phosphorylase, so this pathway for maltose metabolism may be widespread among plants.",M1

This paper reports the effects of ethylene and 1-methylcyclopropene (1-MCP) on the degradation of starch and phosphorylase activity and gene expression. The results indicate that phosphorylase activity is induced during ripening and that it is associated with the onset of starch degradation. The regulation of banana phosphorylase activity is mainly dependent on gene expression, and the absence of ethylene perception by 1-MCP had a positive effect. However, this effect can be precluded by increased levels of ethylene, both autocatalytic and exogenous.",M1
16950538,"<e>Phosphorylase</e> coupling as a tool to convert cellobiose into amylose.This work aims to establish the enzymatic process to produce amylose from cellobiose. Incubation of cellobiose with cellobiose phosphorylase and alpha-glucan phosphorylase in the presence of maltotetraose and a catalytic amount of inorganic phosphate at 45 degrees C for 16 h resulted in the production of linear alpha-1,4-glucan with a 19.3% (w/v, against cellobiose weight) yield. The yield was successfully improved (32.4%) when mutarotase and glucose oxidase were added to remove glucose in the reaction mixture. The weight-average molecular weight of the product was precisely controlled from 42 to 720 kDa by changing the initial molar ratio of cellobiose to maltotetraose.

This study used homogeneous recombinant KPI-2 (Lmr2, LMTK2, Cprk, brain-enriched protein kinase) kinase domain and a library of 1,154 peptides on a microarray to analyze substrate specificity. We found that KPI-2 is strictly a Ser/Thr kinase that reacts with Ser either preceded by or followed by Pro residues but unlike other Pro-directed kinases does not strictly require an adjacent Pro residue. The most reactive peptide in the library corresponds to Ser-737 of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator, and the recombinant R domain of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator was a preferred substrate. Furthermore the KPI-2 kinase phosphorylated peptides corresponding to the single site in phosphorylase and purified phosphorylase b, making this only the second known phosphorylase b kinase. Phosphorylase was used as a specific substrate to show that KPI-2 is inhibited in living cells by addition of nerve growth factor or serum.

Four chimeric enzymes had KP activity, and another had TP activity. Chimera V-III showed not TP, but KP activity, although only 125 amino acid residues in 785 residues of chimera V-III were from that of KP. Chimera V-III had 1% of the specific activity of the wild-type KP. Furthermore, the temperature profile and kinetic parameters of chimera V-III were remarkably changed as compared to those of the wild-type KP. The results of the molecular mass of chimera V-III using GPC (76,000 Da) strongly suggested that the chimera V-III protein exists as a monomer in solution, whereas wild-type KP and TP are hexamer and dimer structures, respectively. The result of the substrate specificity for phosphorolysis was that the chimera acted on nigerose, sophorose and laminaribiose, in addition to kojibiose. Furthermore, chimera V-III was also able to act on sophorose and laminaribiose in the absence of inorganic phosphate, and produced two trisaccharides, beta-D-glucosyl-(1--&gt;6)-laminaribiose and laminaritriose, from laminaribiose.",M1

The nucleotide sequence of the hprK/P gene corresponded to an open reading frame of 951 bp that encoded a polypeptide of 316 amino acid residues with a calculated molecular mass of 35,458 Da. The deduced amino acid sequence of the B. stearothermophilus no. 236 HprK/P showed 64.5% identity with the B. subtilis enzyme, allowing us to identify two highly conserved motifs, the nucleotide binding P-loop (Walker motif A) and the HprK/P family signature sequence in the C-terminal half of the protein. Furthermore, complementation experiments showed that the cloned hprK/P gene product was functionally active in the B. subtilis cells. The purified (His)(6)-tagged B. stearothermophilus no. 236 HprK/P migrated on SDS-PAGE gel as a single species with a molecular mass of about 36 kDa, and behaved in gel filtration like a hexameric protein. The recombinant protein catalyzes the pyrophosphate (PPi)-dependent (highest activity at pH 7.0 and 40 degrees C) as well as the ATP-dependent phosphorylation of Ser46 in HPr (maximum activity at pH 8.0 and 45 degrees C). It also catalyzes the inorganic phosphate-dependent dephosphorylation (phosphorolysis) of seryl-phosphorylated HPr, optimally at pH 6.5 and 40 degrees C. BIAcore surface resonance analysis confirmed that a divalent cation, preferentially Mg(2+), was an indispensable cofactor for the three activities of the HprK/P. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP) was observed to stimulate ATP-dependent kinase activity, while inorganic phosophate (Pi) inhibited ATP-dependent kinase activity. Mutations in the Walker motif A simultaneously abolished both types of kinase and phosphorylase activities. On the other hand, the conserved signature residues were confirmed to be involved in the PPi-dependent kinase and phosphorylase reactions.",M1

Use of A. niger-preferred codon usage and lower A+T content in a synthetic gene (GP-syn) resulted in a significant improvement in the level of the GP mRNA and a dramatic increase in the quantity of GP protein produced such that it accounted for approximately 10% of the total soluble protein. We suggest that redesigning the primary DNA sequence encoding a desired protein product can be an extremely effective method for improving heterologous protein production in filamentous fungi.",M1
16257195,"Metabolic capacity of the diaphragm in patients with COPD.Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is associated with an increased load on the diaphragm. Chronic loading on skeletal muscles results in metabolic changes and fiber-type shifts. Therefore, we investigated whether the load on the human diaphragm imposed by COPD altered oxidative enzyme activity, glycogenolytic enzyme activity and mitochondrial energy generating capacity and efficiency. Biopsies of the diaphragm from COPD patients and control subjects were obtained and activities of L(+)3-hydroxyacylCoA-dehydrogenase (HADH, marker for beta-oxidation capacity) and <e>phosphorylase</e> (marker for glycogenolytic capacity) were measured spectrophotometrically. Mitochondrial energy generating capacity was measured by spectrophotometrical and radiochemical methods. Fiber-type distribution was determined electrophoretically. We found that HADH activity was increased with increasing severity of COPD (P=0.05). No change in glycogenolytic enzyme activity was observed. The activity of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes III and IV and oxidation of pyruvate was increased with increasing airflow obstruction. These results suggest that in COPD the diaphragm adapts to a higher workload by increasing the oxidative capacity and mitochondrial function.",M1

The production yields were estimated to be 2.1 g of KP and 4.9 g of TP per liter of medium. Selaginose, non-reducing trisaccharide, was synthesized from trehalose utilizing the recombinant KP and TP from B. subtilis. Selaginose was not hydrolyzed by salivary amylase, artificial gastric juice, pancreatic amylase, or small intestinal enzymes.",M1

16230332,"Analysis of cytosolic heteroglycans from leaves of transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants that under- or overexpress the Pho 2 <e>phosphorylase</e> isozyme.During starch degradation, chloroplasts export neutral sugars into the cytosol where they appear to enter a complex glycan metabolism. Interactions between glycans and glucosyl transferases residing in the cytosol were studied by analyzing transgenic potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants that possess either decreased or elevated levels of the cytosolic (Pho 2) phosphorylase isoform. Water-soluble heteroglycans (SHGs) were isolated from these plants and were characterized. SHG contains, as major constituents, arabinose, rhamnose, galactose and glucose. Non-aqueous fractionation combined with other separation techniques revealed a distinct pool of the SHG that is located in the cytosol. Under in vitro conditions, the cytosolic heteroglycans act as glucosyl acceptor selectively for Pho 2. Acceptor sites were characterized by a specific hydrolytic degradation following the Pho 2-catalyzed glucosyl transfer. The size distribution of the cytosolic SHG increased during the dark period, indicating a distinct metabolic activity related to net starch degradation. Antisense inhibition of Pho 2 resulted in increased glucosyl and rhamnosyl contents of the glycans. Overexpression of Pho 2 decreased the content of both residues. Compared with the wild type, in both types of transgenic plants the size of the cytosolic glycans was increased.",M1
16153100,"Potato <e>phosphorylase</e> catalyzed synthesis of amylose-lipid complexes.On-line size-exclusion chromatography monitoring of potato phosphorylase catalyzed amylose synthesis--starting from alpha-D-glucose-1-P and maltohexaose--revealed rather monodisperse amylose populations. In the presence of lipids, amylose-lipid complexes spontaneously formed and precipitated. They were recovered by centrifugation, freeze-dried, and characterized by wide-angle X-ray diffraction and differential scanning calorimetry. The presence of lipids during amylose synthesis led to lower amylose degrees of polymerization (DP). Lipid chain length defined amylose DP, which increased in the order myristic acid (C14), glyceryl monostearate (GMS), stearic acid (C18), and docosanoic acid (C22). The thermal stability of the complexes increased in the same manner, with the C22 complexes having the highest dissociation temperature. In addition, we hypothesized that these results provide additional evidence for the fringed micellar organization of (semi-enzymically synthesized) amylose-lipid complexes.",M1
16151135,"Cumulative effect of amino acid replacements results in enhanced thermostability of potato type L alpha-glucan <e>phosphorylase</e>.The thermostability of potato type L alpha-glucan phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1) was enhanced by random and site-directed mutagenesis. We obtained three single-residue mutations-Phe39--&gt;Leu (F39L), Asn135--&gt;Ser (N135S), and Thr706--&gt;Ile (T706I)-by random mutagenesis. Although the wild-type enzyme was completely inactivated, these mutant enzymes retained their activity even after heat treatment at 60 degrees C for 2 h. Combinations of these mutations were introduced by site-directed mutagenesis. The simultaneous mutation of two (F39L/N135S, F39L/T706I, and N135S/T706I) or three (F39L/N135S/T706I) residues further increased the thermostability of the enzyme, indicating that the effect of the replacement of the residues was cumulative. The triple-mutant enzyme, F39L/N135S/T706I, retained 50% of its original activity after heat treatment at 65 degrees C for 20 min. Further analysis indicated that enzymes with a F39L or T706I mutation were resistant to possible proteolytic degradation.",M1
16098110,"Identification, subcellular localization and biochemical characterization of water-soluble heteroglycans (SHG) in leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana L.: distinct SHG reside in the cytosol and in the apoplast.Water-soluble heteroglycans (SHG) were isolated from leaves of wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana L. and from two starch-deficient mutants. Major constituents of the SHG are arabinose, galactose, rhamnose, and glucose. SHG was separated into low (&lt;10 kDa; SHG(S)) and high (&gt;10 kDa; SHG(L)) molecular weight compounds. SHG(S) was resolved into approximately 25 distinct oligoglycans by ion exchange chromatography. SHG(L) was further separated into two subfractions, designated as subfraction I and II, by field flow fractionation. For the intracellular localization of the various SHG compounds several approaches were chosen: first, leaf material was subjected to non-aqueous fractionation. The apolar gradient fractions were characterized by monitoring markers and were used as starting material for the SHG isolation. Subfraction I and SHG(S) exhibited a distribution similar to that of cytosolic markers whereas subfraction II cofractionated with crystalline cellulose. Secondly, intact organelles were isolated and used for SHG isolation. Preparations of intact organelles (mitochondria plus peroxisomes) contained no significant amount of any heteroglycan. In isolated intact microsomes a series of oligoglycans was recovered but neither subfraction I nor II. In in vitro assays using glucose 1-phosphate and recombinant cytosolic (Pho 2) <e>phosphorylase</e> both SHG(S) and subfraction I acted as glucosyl acceptor whereas subfraction II was essentially inactive. Rabbit muscle phosphorylase a did not utilize any of the plant glycans indicating a specific Pho 2-glycan interaction. As revealed by in vivo labeling experiments using 14CO2 carbon fluxes into subfraction I and II differed. Furthermore, in leaves the pool size of subfraction I varied during the light-dark regime.",M1
15933016,"Novel putative galactose operon involving lacto-N-biose <e>phosphorylase</e> in Bifidobacterium longum.A lacto-N-biose phosphorylase (LNBP) was purified from the cell extract of Bifidobacterium bifidum. Its N-terminal and internal amino acid sequences were homologous with those of the hypothetical protein of Bifidobacterium longum NCC2705 encoded by the BL1641 gene. The homologous gene of the type strain B. longum JCM1217, lnpA, was expressed in Escherichia coli to confirm that it encoded LNBP. No significant identity was found with any proteins with known function, indicating that LNBP should be classified in a new family. The lnpA gene is located in a novel putative operon for galactose metabolism that does not contain a galactokinase gene. The operon seems to be involved in intestinal colonization by bifidobacteria mediated by metabolism of mucin sugars. In addition, it may also resolve the question of the nature of the bifidus factor in human milk as the lacto-N-biose structure found in milk oligosaccharides.",M1
15907212,"Quantification of the glycogen cascade system: the ultrasensitive responses of liver glycogen synthase and muscle <e>phosphorylase</e> are due to distinctive regulatory designs.BACKGROUND: Signaling pathways include intricate networks of reversible covalent modification cycles. Such multicyclic enzyme cascades amplify the input stimulus, cause integration of multiple signals and exhibit sensitive output responses. Regulation of glycogen synthase and phosphorylase by reversible covalent modification cycles exemplifies signal transduction by enzyme cascades. Although this system for regulating glycogen synthesis and breakdown appears similar in all tissues, subtle differences have been identified. For example, phosphatase-1, a dephosphorylating enzyme of the system, is regulated quite differently in muscle and liver. Do these small differences in regulatory architecture affect the overall performance of the glycogen cascade in a specific tissue? We address this question by analyzing the regulatory structure of the glycogen cascade system in liver and muscle cells at steady state. RESULTS: The glycogen cascade system in liver and muscle cells was analyzed at steady state and the results were compared with literature data. We found that the cascade system exhibits highly sensitive switch-like responses to changes in cyclic AMP concentration and the outputs are surprisingly different in the two tissues. In muscle, glycogen phosphorylase is more sensitive than glycogen synthase to cyclic AMP, while the opposite is observed in liver. Furthermore, when the liver undergoes a transition from starved to fed-state, the futile cycle of simultaneous glycogen synthesis and degradation switches to reciprocal regulation. Under such a transition, different proportions of active glycogen synthase and phosphorylase can coexist due to the varying inhibition of glycogen-synthase phosphatase by active phosphorylase. CONCLUSION: The highly sensitive responses of glycogen synthase in liver and phosphorylase in muscle to primary stimuli can be attributed to distinctive regulatory designs in the glycogen cascade system. The different sensitivities of these two enzymes may exemplify the adaptive strategies employed by liver and muscle cells to meet specific cellular demands.",M1
15880776,"Hyperglycaemic effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine and dopamine in the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium malcolmsonii.The effects of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT; serotonin) and dopamine (DA) on tissue carbohydrate metabolism and haemolymph glucose levels in the freshwater prawn, Macrobrachium malcolmsonii, were investigated. Injection of 5-HT and DA produced hyperglycaemia in a dose-dependent and time-dependent manner, with DA being more effective than 5-HT. Interestingly, 5-HT and DA induced hyperglycaemia only in intact prawns but not in bilaterally eyestalk-ablated individuals. Total carbohydrate (TCHO) and glycogen levels decreased and <e>phosphorylase</e> activity increased in the hepatopancreas and muscle of intact prawns after being injected with 5-HT or DA. However, bilateral eyestalk ablation decreased haemolymph glucose and tissue phosphorylase activity and increased TCHO and glycogen levels of the hepatopancreas and muscle. Injection of 5-HT or DA did not cause significant changes in these variables in eyestalk-ablated prawns. It is hypothesized that 5-HT and DA induce hyperglycaemia in prawns by stimulating the release of crustacean hyperglycaemic hormone (CHH) from the X-organ sinus gland (XO-SG) complex located in the eyestalk.",M1
15808949,"Bioinformatic analyses of bacterial HPr kinase/<e>phosphorylase</e> homologues.HPr kinase/phosphorylases (HprKs) regulate catabolite repression and sugar transport in Gram-positive bacteria by phosphorylating the small phosphotransferase system (PTS) protein HPr on a serine residue. We identified homologues of HprK in currently sequenced genomes and multiply aligned their sequences in order to perform phylogenetic and motif analyses. Seventy-eight homologues from bacteria and one from an archaeon comprise nine phylogenetic clusters. Some homologues come from bacteria whose genomes contain multiple highly divergent paralogues that cluster loosely together. Many of these proteins are truncated or show little or no identifiable similarity outside of the Walker A nucleotide binding domain. HprK homologues were identified in Gram-negative bacteria that appear to lack PTS permeases, suggesting modes of action and substrates that differ from those characterized in Gram-positive bacteria.",M1
15790394,"Glycogen synthesis correlates with androgen-dependent growth arrest in prostate cancer.BACKGROUND: Androgen withdrawal in normal prostate or androgen-dependent prostate cancer is associated with the downregulation of several glycolytic enzymes and with reduced glucose uptake. Although glycogen metabolism is known to regulate the intracellular glucose level its involvement in androgen response has not been studied. METHODS: We investigated the effects of androgen on glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> (GP), glycogen synthase (GS) and on glycogen accumulation in the androgen-receptor (AR) reconstituted PC3 cell line containing either an empty vector (PC3-AR-V) or vector with HPV-E7 (PC3-AR-E7) and the LNCaP cell line. RESULTS: Androgen addition in PC3 cells expressing the AR mimics androgen ablation in androgen-dependent prostate cells. Incubation of PC3-AR-V or PC3-AR-E7 cells with the androgen R1881 induced G1 cell cycle arrest within 24 hours and resulted in a gradual cell number reduction over 5 days thereafter, which was accompanied by a 2 to 5 fold increase in glycogen content. 24 hours after androgen-treatment the level of Glucose-6-P (G-6-P) had increased threefold and after 48 hours the GS and GP activities increased twofold. Under this condition inhibition of glycogenolysis with the selective GP inhibitor CP-91149 enhanced the increase in glycogen content and further reduced the cell number. The androgen-dependent LNCaP cells that endogenously express AR responded to androgen withdrawal with growth arrest and increased glycogen content. CP-91149 further increased glycogen content and caused a reduction of cell number. CONCLUSION: Increased glycogenesis is part of the androgen receptor-mediated cellular response and blockage of glycogenolysis by the GP inhibitor CP-91149 further increased glycogenesis. The combined use of a GP inhibitor with hormone therapy may increase the efficacy of hormone treatment by decreasing the survival of prostate cancer cells and thereby reducing the chance of cancer recurrence.",M1

An aerobic exercise test demonstrated that the concentrations of serum lactate and pyruvate were elevated before corticosteroid therapy but decreased after the therapy. On the other hand, in forearm ischemic exercise tests, the responses of serum lactate and pyruvate were attenuated before corticosteroid therapy but recovered after the therapy. These findings indicate that an inflammatory mechanism interfered with myophosphorylase activity and muscle aerobic function.",M1

KPase produced four transfer products, saccharides 1-4. The structure of a major product, saccharide 4, was 2-O-alpha-d-glucopyranosyl-CTS, cyclo-{--&gt;6)-alpha-d-Glcp-(1--&gt;3)-alpha-d-Glcp-(1--&gt;6)-[alpha-d-Glcp-(1--&gt;2)]-alpha-d-Glcp-(1--&gt;3)-alpha-d-Glcp-(1--&gt;}. The other transfer products, saccharides 1-3, were 2-O-alpha-kojibiosyl-, 2-O-alpha-kojitriosyl-, and 2-O-alpha-kojitetraosyl-CTS, respectively. These results showed that KPase transferred a glucose residue to the C-2 position at the ring glucose residue of CTS. This enzyme also catalyzed the chain-extending reaction of the side chain of 2-O-alpha-d-glycopyranosyl-CTS.",M1
15519414,"Postmetamorphic Xenopus laevis shows decreased plasma triiodothyronine concentrations and <e>phosphorylase</e> activity due to subacute phytosterol exposure.Postmetamorphic South African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) were exposed to a phytosterol mixture (ca. 80% beta-sitosterol and less sitostanol, campesterol, and campestanol) for 14 days at 30 mugl(-1) in a flow-through system. The effects of phytosterols (PS) on the plasma thyroid hormone (T(3) and T(4)), testosterone, leptin-immunoreactive peptide and tissue glycogen concentrations were determined. The following enzyme activities were also analyzed from the liver and muscle: glycogen phosphorylase and lipase, and from the liver only: glucose-6-phosphatase. The plasma T(3) concentration was lower in the PS-exposed female frogs. Both muscle lipase and glycogen phosphorylase activities were also lower in the PS-exposed animals. These results could indicate that the basal metabolic rate and locomotion activity of the frogs were decreased. The effects could not be attributed to the possible estrogenicity of the PS mixture. Further studies will be needed to evaluate the possible significance of these effects.",M1
15388466,"Dual-action mechanism of viramidine functioning as a prodrug and as a catabolic inhibitor for ribavirin.An investigational nucleoside analogue drug, viramidine, has recently emerged as a potentially safer alternative to ribavirin for the treatment of hepatitis C viral infection. We have reported that viramidine mainly functions as a prodrug of ribavirin that is enriched in the liver. This in vitro study further explores viramidine's activity against nucleoside <e>phosphorylase</e>, a host enzyme that is responsible for phosphorolysis of ribavirin in vivo. Our experiments show that viramidine inhibits ribavirin phosphorolysis with a K(i) of 2.5 microM. This result suggests that viramidine may act through a dual-action mechanism by serving as a prodrug of ribavirin and concomitantly as an inhibitor for nucleoside phosphorylase catabolism of ribavirin.",M1
15322104,"The glycogenic action of protein targeting to glycogen in hepatocytes involves multiple mechanisms including <e>phosphorylase</e> inactivation and glycogen synthase translocation.Expression of the glycogen-targeting protein PTG promotes glycogen synthase activation and glycogen storage in various cell types. In this study, we tested the contribution of phosphorylase inactivation to the glycogenic action of PTG in hepatocytes by using a selective inhibitor of phosphorylase (CP-91149) that causes dephosphorylation of phosphorylase a and sequential activation of glycogen synthase. Similar to CP-91194, graded expression of PTG caused a concentration-dependent inactivation of phosphorylase and activation of glycogen synthase. The latter was partially counter-acted by the expression of muscle phosphorylase and was not additive with the activation by CP-91149, indicating that it is in part secondary to the inactivation of phosphorylase. PTG expression caused greater stimulation of glycogen synthesis and translocation of glycogen synthase than CP-91149, and the translocation of synthase could not be explained by accumulation of glycogen, supporting an additional role for glycogen synthase translocation in the glycogenic action of PTG. The effects of PTG expression on glycogen synthase and glycogen synthesis were additive with the effects of glucokinase expression, confirming the complementary roles of depletion of phosphorylase a (a negative modulator) and elevated glucose 6-phosphate (a positive modulator) in potentiating the activation of glycogen synthase. PTG expression mimicked the inactivation of phosphorylase caused by high glucose and counteracted the activation caused by glucagon. The latter suggests a possible additional role for PTG on phosphorylase kinase inactivation.",M1
15272721,"Arsenic toxicity in mice and its possible amelioration.Oral administration of arsenic trioxide (3 and 6 mg/kg body weight/d) for 30 d caused, as compared with vehicle control, dose-dependent significant reductions in body weight, absolute weight, protein, glycogen, as well as, total, dehydro and reduced ascorbic acid contents both in the liver and kidney of arsenic-treated mice. Succinic dehydrogenase (SDH) and <e>phosphorylase</e> only in the liver activities were significantly reduced in a dose-dependent manner. Acid phosphatase activity was significantly decreased in the liver of low dose arsenic-treated animals; however, significant rise in its activity was observed in high dose group. As compared with vehicle control, treatment also caused significant dose-dependent reductions in SDH, alkaline phosphatase and acid phosphatase activities in the kidney of mice. Vitamin E cotreatment as well as, 30 d withdrawal of arsenic trioxide treatment with or without vitamin E caused significant amelioration in arsenic-induced toxicity in mice. Administration of vitamin E during withdrawal of treatment also caused significant amelioration as compared from only withdrawal of the treatment. It is concluded that vitamin E ameliorates arsenic-induced toxicities in the liver and kidney of mice.",M1
15173560,"Plastidial alpha-glucan <e>phosphorylase</e> is not required for starch degradation in Arabidopsis leaves but has a role in the tolerance of abiotic stress.To study the role of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase in starch metabolism in the leaves of Arabidopsis, two independent mutant lines containing T-DNA insertions within the phosphorylase gene were identified. Both insertions eliminate the activity of the plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase. Measurement of other enzymes of starch metabolism reveals only minor changes compared with the wild type. The loss of plastidial alpha-glucan phosphorylase does not cause a significant change in the total accumulation of starch during the day or its remobilization at night. Starch structure and composition are unaltered. However, mutant plants display lesions on their leaves that are not seen on wild-type plants, and mesophyll cells bordering the lesions accumulate high levels of starch. Lesion formation is abolished by growing plants under 100% humidity in still air, but subsequent transfer to circulating air with lower humidity causes extensive wilting in the mutant leaves. Wilted sectors die, causing large lesions that are bordered by starch-accumulating cells. Similar lesions are caused by the application of acute salt stress to mature plants. We conclude that plastidial phosphorylase is not required for the degradation of starch, but that it plays a role in the capacity of the leaf lamina to endure a transient water deficit.",M1
14686439,"High <e>phosphorylase</e> activity is correlated with increased potato minituber formation and starch content during extended clinorotation.The major purpose of these experiments were to investigate growth of potato storage organs and starch synthesis in minitubers at slow horizontal clinorotation (2 rpm), which partly mimics microgravity, and a secondary goal was to study the activity and localization of phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1) in storage parenchyma under these conditions. Miniplants of Solanum tuberosum L. (cv Adreta) were grown in culture for 30 days for both the vertical control and the horizontal clinorotation. During long-term clinorotation, an acceleration of minituber formation, and an increase of amyloplast number and size in storage parenchyma cells, as well as increased starch content, was observed in the minitubers. The differences among cytochemical reaction intensity, activity of phosphorylase, and carbohydrate content in storage parenchyma cells of minitubers grown in a horizontal clinostat were established by electron-cytochemical and biochemical methods. It is shown that high phosphorylase activity is correlated with increased starch content during extended clinorotation. The results demonstrate the increase in carbohydrate metabolism and possible accelerated growth of storage organs under the influence of microgravity, as mimicked by clinorotation; therefore, clinorotation can be used as a basis for future studies on mechanisms of starch synthesis under microgravity.",M1
13678418,"Reaction mechanism of chitobiose <e>phosphorylase</e> from Vibrio proteolyticus: identification of family 36 glycosyltransferase in Vibrio.A family 36 glycosyltransferase gene was cloned from Vibrio proteolyticus. The deduced amino acid sequence showed a high degree of identity with ChBP (chitobiose phosphorylase) from another species, Vibrio furnissii. The recombinant enzyme catalysed the reversible phosphorolysis of (GlcNAc)2 (chitobiose) to form 2-acetamide-2-deoxy-alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate [GlcNAc-1-P] and GlcNAc, but showed no activity on cellobiose, indicating that the enzyme was ChBP, not cellobiose phosphorylase. In the synthetic reaction, the ChBP was active with alpha-D-glucose 1-phosphate as the donor substrate as well as GlcNAc-1-P to produce beta-D-glucosyl-(1--&gt;4)-2-acetamide-2-deoxy-D-glucose with GlcNAc as the acceptor substrate. The enzyme allowed aryl-beta-glycosides of GlcNAc as the acceptor substrate with 10-20% activities of GlcNAc. Kinetic parameters of (GlcNAc)2 in the phosphorolysis and GlcNAc-1-P in the synthetic reaction were determined as follows: phosphorolysis, k(0)=5.5 s(-1), K(m)=2.0 mM; synthetic reaction, k(0)=10 s(-1), K(m)=14 mM, respectively. The mechanism of the phosphorolytic reaction followed a sequential Bi Bi mechanism, as frequently observed with cellobiose phosphorylases. Substrate inhibition by GlcNAc was observed in the synthetic reaction. The enzyme was considered a unique biocatalyst for glycosidation.",M1
13678417,"Glucose 6-phosphate causes translocation of <e>phosphorylase</e> in hepatocytes and inactivates the enzyme synergistically with glucose.The role of glucose 6-P (glucose 6-phosphate) in regulating the activation state of glycogen synthase and its translocation is well documented. In the present study, we investigated the effects of glucose 6-P on the activation state and compartmentation of phosphorylase in hepatocytes. Glucose 6-P levels were modulated in hepatocytes by glucokinase overexpression or inhibition with 5-thioglucose and the effects of AMP were tested using AICAR (5-aminoimidazole-4-carboxamide 1-beta-D-ribofuranoside), which is metabolized to an AMP analogue. Inhibition of glucokinase partially counteracted the effect of glucose both on the inactivation of phosphorylase and on the translocation of phosphorylase a from a soluble to a particulate fraction. The increase in glucose 6-P caused by glucokinase overexpression caused translocation of phosphorylase a to the pellet and had additive effects with glucose on inactivation of phosphorylase. It decreased the glucose concentration that caused half-maximal inactivation from 20 to 11 mM, indicating that it acts synergistically with glucose. AICAR activated phosphorylase and counteracted the effect of glucose 6-P on phosphorylase inactivation. However, it did not counteract translocation of phosphorylase by glucose 6-P. Glucose 6-P and AICAR had opposite effects on the activation state of glycogen synthase, but they had additive effects on translocation of the enzyme to the pellet. There was a direct correlation between the translocation of phosphorylase a and of glycogen synthase to the pellet, suggesting that these enzymes translocate in tandem. In conclusion, glucose 6-P causes both translocation of phosphorylase and inactivation, indicating a more complex role in the regulation of glycogen metabolism than can be explained from regulation of glycogen synthase alone.",M1

Marked alterations were observed in activities of the enzymes involved in starch metabolism. The cellular content of starch in nitrophenol-grown cultures was significantly reduced, whereas the levels of nonreducing and reducing sugars significantly increased. There was a significant increase in the activities of amylase and phosphorylase, and these alterations are probably responsible for the decreased amount of starch in the cultures. Furthermore, significant changes were noticed in activities of the enzymes involved in synthesis of sucrose as well.",M1

In vitro results showed that LMW fucoidan enhanced fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-2-induced [(3)H]thymidine incorporation in cultured rat smooth muscle cells. Intravenous injection in rats of LMW fucoidan significantly increased the stromal-derived factor (SDF)-1 level from 1.2 +/- 0.1 to 6.5 +/- 0.35 ng/ml in plasma. The therapeutic effect of LMW fucoidan (5 mg/kg/day), FGF-2 (1 micro g/kg/day), and LMW fucoidan combined with FGF-2 was assessed 14 days after induction of ischemia by 1) clinical evaluation of claudication, 2) tissue blood flow analysis, 3) histoenzymology of muscle metabolic activity, and 4) quantification of capillary density. Both LMW fucoidan and FGF-2 similarly improved residual muscle blood flow (62.5 +/- 6.5 and 64.5 +/- 4.5%, respectively) compared with the control group (42 +/- 3.5%, p &lt; 0.0001). The combination of FGF-2 and LMW fucoidan showed further significant improvement in tissue blood flow (90.5 +/- 3%, p &lt; 0.0001). These results were confirmed by <e>phosphorylase</e> activity, showing muscle regeneration in rats treated with the combination of FGF-2 and LMW fucoidan. Capillary density count increased from 9.6 +/- 0.7 capillaries/muscle section in untreated ischemic controls to 14.3 +/- 0.9 with LMW fucoidan, 14.5 +/- 0.9 with FGF-2, and 19.1 +/- 0.9 in combination (p &lt; 0.001). Thus, LMW fucoidan potentiates FGF-2 activity, mobilizes SDF-1, and facilitates angiogenesis in a rat model. This natural compound could be of interest as an alternative for conventional treatment in critical ischemia.",M1
12498887,"Insights into trehalose synthesis provided by the structure of the retaining glucosyltransferase OtsA.Trehalose is a nonreducing disaccharide that plays a major role in many organisms, most notably in survival and stress responses. In Mycobacterium tuberculosis, it plays a central role as the carbohydrate core of numerous immunogenic glycolipids including  cord factor  (trehalose 6,6'-dimycolate). The classical pathway for trehalose synthesis involves the condensation of UDP-glucose and glucose-6-phosphate to afford trehalose-6-phosphate, catalyzed by the retaining glycosyltransferase OtsA. The configurations of two anomeric positions are set simultaneously, resulting in the formation of a double glycoside. The three-dimensional structure of the Escherichia coli OtsA, in complex with both UDP and glucose-6-phosphate, reveals the active site at the interface of two beta/alpha/beta domains. The overall structure and the intimate details of the catalytic machinery reveal a striking similarity to glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e>, indicating a strong evolutionary link and suggesting a common catalytic mechanism.",M1

Here the possibility is examined that other monosaccharide transferases, those that catalyze synthesis of starch, glycogen, and the disaccharide sucrose, resemble the phosphorylase-type enzymes in structure. In particular, a clear relationship is shown, for the first time, between mammalian glycogen synthases and the phosphorylase structural group of proteins. Domain architecture and secondary structure are discussed, and the possible role of several conserved amino acids at the active site is explored.",M1
11948974,"Stimulation of trehalose efflux from cockroach (Periplaneta americana) fat body by hypertrehalosemic hormone is dependent on protein kinase C and calmodulin.Protein kinase C and calmodulin play key roles in cockroach fat body during activation of <e>phosphorylase</e> and trehalose efflux by HTH-II. The data support the view that an increase in cytosolic Ca2+ is prerequisite for enhanced activity of protein kinase C and calmodulin. Chelation of Ca2+ (i) with BAPTA blocks HTH-II-induced trehalose efflux from the fat body whereas thapsigargin, which raises [Ca2+]i to the same level as HTH-II, produces only a small, yet significant increase in trehalose efflux. Sphingosine, an inhibitor of protein kinase C, inhibits HTH-II-induced trehalose efflux in a concentration-dependent manner. Trehalose efflux is not activated by the protein kinase C activators OAG or PMA alone but in the presence of thapsigargin both agents increase trehalose efflux to a level comparable to that obtained with HTH-II. Thapsigargin has only a moderate activating effect on phosphorylase but in combination with OAG produces an activation indistinguishable from that provoked by HTH-II. Each of the structurally different calmodulin inhibitors, trifluoperazine, W-7, and calmidazolium, blocks completely the action of HTH-II on trehalose efflux, thus confirming the importance of calmodulin in HTH-II initiated trehalose efflux.",M1
11691630,"Inositol trisphosphate mediates the action of hypertrehalosemic hormone on fat body of the American cockroach, Periplaneta americana.The rate of synthesis of inositol trisphosphate (InsP(3)) in trophocytes derived from disaggregated cockroach (Periplaneta americana) fat body increases following treatment of the cells with hypertrehalosemic hormone I or II (HTH-I, -II) in vitro. Trophocytes preloaded with [3H]inositol display a significant increase in InsP(3) synthesis as early as 15 s after addition of the hormone. When the trophocytes are pre-incubated with LiCl and subsequently incubated with HTH the [3H] content of the InsP(3) fraction is greater than that found with HTH alone. This is taken as evidence that inositol monophosphate phosphatase is part of the mechanism for clearing InsP(3) from the cytosol. In contrast to HTH, octopamine, which is also capable of exerting a hypertrehalosemic effect in the cockroach, does not increase the synthesis of InsP(3). 1-Octadecyl-2-methyl-rac-glycero-3-phosphocholine (ET-18-OCH(3)), a potent and selective inhibitor of phosphatidylinositol phospholipase C, blocks the activation of <e>phosphorylase</e> by HTH-I as well as the hypertrehalosemic effect induced by the hormone.",M1

The diagnosis is established by documentation of elevated glycogen content and reduced <e>phosphorylase</e> activity in biopsied muscle tissue. We report four cases with McArdle disease which were 16, 15, 11 and 5 years old. They were brothers, and they came to the hospital because of pain, cramps and myoglobinuria after exercise or infection; in the first case, a male patient, myoglobinuria caused acute renal failure. Three of them showed reduced phosphorylase activity in biopsied muscle tissue. We discuss the different therapeutic possibilities.",M1
11556793,"Plastidic (Pho1-type) <e>phosphorylase</e> isoforms in potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) plants: expression analysis and immunochemical characterization.Higher plants contain two types of phosphorylase (EC 2.4.1.1). One type is plastidic (Phol) and the other resides in the cytosol (Pho2). For Solanum tuberosum L., two highly homologous Pho1-type sequences (designated as Pho1a and Pho1b, respectively) have been described that occur both in a homodimeric, (Pho1a)2, and a heterodimeric, Pho1a-Pho1b, state [U. Sonnewald et al. (1995) Plant Mol Biol 27:567 576; T. Albrecht et al. (1998) Eur J Biochem 251:981-991]. We present a spatial and temporal analysis of the expression patterns of the Pho1-type phosphorylases in S. tuberosum. Expression was analyzed at transcript, protein and activity levels. The specificity of both the probes and the antibodies used was carefully determined to ensure selectivity of detection. For both the Pho1a and Pho1b probes the degree of cross-hybridization was estimated. Peptide scanning identified the epitopes of the anti-Pho 1a and anti-Pho 1b antibodies. Expression of the two Pho1-type genes was analyzed in various organs of the potato plant. In all organs studied the Pho1a transcript levels exceeded those of Pho1b. Furthermore, leaves of a given developmental stage were sampled during the light period and were analyzed for transcript and protein levels and for various carbohydrate pools as well. The data show that in leaves the Pho1a gene expression closely corresponds to starch accumulation, suggesting that the enzyme fulfils a metabolic function within the process of starch biosynthesis. In tubers, Pho1a is constitutively expressed in the parenchyma cells whereas expression of the Pho1b, gene is restricted to cells in close vicinity of the vascular tissue.",M1
11551121,"Evidence for a hyperglycemic effect of methionine-enkephalin in the prawns Penaeus indicus and Metapenaeus monocerus.The influence of methionine-enkephalin on carbohydrate metabolism of the prawns Penaeus indicus and Metapenaeus monocerus was studied. Injection of the opioid methionine-enkephalin into intact prawns induced significant hyperglycemia in a dose-dependent manner. Total tissue (midgut gland and muscle) carbohydrate and glycogen levels decreased following methionine-enkephalin injection, with a significant activation of <e>phosphorylase</e> in intact prawns, indicating glycogenolysis leading to hyperglycemia. In contrast, injection of methionine-enkephalin into eyestalk-ablated crabs did not affect the levels of hemolymph glucose, total tissue carbohydrates and glycogen, and activity of phosphorylase. These results support an earlier hypothesis for crabs which proposed that methionine-enkephalin acts as a neurotransmitter in crustaceans and stimulates the release of hyperglycemic hormone in inducing hyperglycemia.",M1
11527582,"Combined kinetic mechanism describing activation and inhibition of muscle glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b by adenosine 5'-monophosphate.The kinetic analysis of the glycogen chain growth reaction catalyzed by glycogen phosphorylase b from rabbit skeletal muscle has been carried out over a wide range of concentrations of AMP under the saturation of the enzyme by glycogen. The applicability of 23 different variants of the kinetic model involving the interaction of AMP and glucose 1-phosphate binding sites in the dimeric enzyme molecule is considered. A kinetic model has been proposed which assumes: (i) the independent binding of one molecule of glucose 1-phosphate in the catalytic site on the one hand, and AMP in both allosteric effector sites and both nucleoside inhibitor sites of the dimeric enzyme molecule bound by glycogen on the other hand; (ii) the binding of AMP in one of the allosteric effector sites results in an increase in the affinity of other allosteric effector site to AMP; (iii) the independent binding of AMP to the nucleoside inhibitor sites of the dimeric enzyme molecule; (iv) the exclusive binding of the second molecule of glucose 1-phosphate in the catalytic site of glycogen phosphorylase b containing two molecules of AMP occupying both allosteric effector sites; and (v) the catalytic act occurs exclusively in the complex of the enzyme with glycogen, two molecules of AMP occupying both allosteric effector sites, and two molecules of glucose 1-phosphate occupying both catalytic sites.",M1
11486014,"Antagonistic controls of autophagy and glycogen accumulation by Snf1p, the yeast homolog of AMP-activated protein kinase, and the cyclin-dependent kinase Pho85p.In the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, glycogen is accumulated as a carbohydrate reserve when cells are deprived of nutrients. Yeast mutated in SNF1, a gene encoding a protein kinase required for glucose derepression, has diminished glycogen accumulation and concomitant inactivation of glycogen synthase. Restoration of synthesis in an snf1 strain results only in transient glycogen accumulation, implying the existence of other SNF1-dependent controls of glycogen storage. A genetic screen revealed that two genes involved in autophagy, APG1 and APG13, may be regulated by SNF1. Increased autophagic activity was observed in wild-type cells entering the stationary phase, but this induction was impaired in an snf1 strain. Mutants defective for autophagy were able to synthesize glycogen upon approaching the stationary phase, but were unable to maintain their glycogen stores, because subsequent synthesis was impaired and degradation by <e>phosphorylase</e>, Gph1p, was enhanced. Thus, deletion of GPH1 partially reversed the loss of glycogen accumulation in autophagy mutants. Loss of the vacuolar glucosidase, SGA1, also protected glycogen stores, but only very late in the stationary phase. Gph1p and Sga1p may therefore degrade physically distinct pools of glycogen. Pho85p is a cyclin-dependent protein kinase that antagonizes SNF1 control of glycogen synthesis. Induction of autophagy in pho85 mutants entering the stationary phase was exaggerated compared to the level in wild-type cells, but was blocked in apg1 pho85 mutants. We propose that Snf1p and Pho85p are, respectively, positive and negative regulators of autophagy, probably via Apg1 and/or Apg13. Defective glycogen storage in snf1 cells can be attributed to both defective synthesis upon entry into stationary phase and impaired maintenance of glycogen levels caused by the lack of autophagy.",M1
11469792,"Synthesis and mobilization of glycogen during metamorphosis of the medfly Ceratitis capitata.There are no recent reports focusing on insect glycogen metabolism that take the advances made in mammalian and yeast systems into account. Moreover, little is known about glycogen synthesis and degradation during insect metamorphosis. The biosynthesis and mobilization of insect glycogen were measured during the larva to adult transition in the Medfly, Ceratitis capitata. The glycogen accumulated by larva decreased to reach almost undetectable levels at the beginning of the pupation process. Histological preparations of 40 h muscles and fat body confirmed a low glycogen content, in contrast with high glycogen images in third larva tissues. After 40 h, glycogen was synthesized de novo and accumulates up to adult ecdysis. We obtained the metamorphosis-dependent profiles of <e>phosphorylase</e>, glycogen synthase, and a glycogenin-like protein. This novel insect glycogen initiator protein (the first measured in an arthropod) appeared to be similar to the homologous enzymes from vertebrates and yeast. We have correlated these results with other biochemical events and anatomical landmarks to understand the use of storage carbohydrates during the sequence of metamorphosis events.",M1
11440915,"Lack of hepatic  interregulation  during inhibition of glycogenolysis in a canine model.It has been proposed that the glycogenolytic and gluconeogenic pathways contributing to endogenous glucose production are interrelated. Thus a change in one source of glucose 6-phosphate might be compensated for by an inverse change in the other pathway. We therefore investigated the effects of 1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol (DAB), a potent glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> inhibitor, on glucose production in fasted conscious dogs. When dogs were treated acutely with high glucagon, glucose production rose from 1.93 +/- 0.14 to 3.07 +/- 0.37 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (P &lt; 0.01). When dogs were treated acutely with DAB in addition to high glucagon infusion, the stimulation of the glycogenolytic rate was completely suppressed. Glucose production rose from 1.85 +/- 0.20 to 2.41 +/- 0.17 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (P &lt; 0.05), which was due to the increase in gluconeogenesis from 0.93 +/- 0.09 to 1.54 +/- 0.08 mg x kg(-1) x min(-1) (P &lt; 0.001). In conclusion, infusion of DAB inhibited glycogenolysis; however, the absolute contribution of gluconeogenesis to glucose production was not affected. These results suggest that inhibition of glycogenolysis could be an effective antidiabetic treatment.",M1
11429636,"Altered glycogen synthase and <e>phosphorylase</e> activities in skeletal muscle of tetraplegic patients.Despite marked differences in both the extent of physical activity and in muscle metabolism and structure between tetraplegic and control subjects, the glycogen content in the skeletal muscle of both groups is similar. We determined whether this similarity could be explained by the activities of key enzymes of glycogen metabolism. Muscle biopsies were analysed for glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activities, as well as for metabolites. Glycogen content did not differ significantly between the two groups. Total glycogen synthase activity was reduced by almost 60 % in tetraplegics (P &lt; 0.01), whereas total phosphorylase activity did not differ between groups. GS fractional activity did not differ between groups, whereas phosphorylase fractional activity (-/+ AMP) was significantly higher in the tetraplegics (0.08 +/- 0.01, control; 0.25 +/- 0.02, tetraplegics; P &lt; 0.001). Neither uridine diphosphate (UDP)-glucose nor glucose 6-phosphate (G-6-P) content in muscle differed significantly between groups. These data demonstrate that, in tetraplegics, muscle glycogen content is preserved despite decreases in GS activity and increases in phosphorylase fractional activity. Muscle paralysis has differential effects on the activities of GS and GP. Experimental Physiology (2001) 86.2, 205-209.",M1
11412821,"A new homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for thyroxine using glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b-thyroxine conjugates.BACKGROUND: [corrected] Measurement of serum thyroxine (T(4)) concentration is important for diagnosis of thyroid gland diseases. We developed a practical homogeneous enzyme immunoassay for thyroxine analysis in unextracted sera. METHODS: A thyroxine derivative conjugated to a reactive sulfhydryl group of glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb). Conjugation caused inhibition of enzyme activity and the enzyme conjugate was re-activated upon the binding of a polyclonal anti-T(4) antibody. Antibody-activation was blocked by the presence of free T(4). RESULTS: Conjugation affected the allosteric character of the enzyme and the K(m) for the allosteric activator AMP was increased 28 times, while anti-T(4) antibody partially reversed this effect. The optimum concentration ratio of enzyme conjugate to anti-T(4) antibody was determined, and T(4) was measured with desired sensitivity and accuracy in the range between 10 and 240 microg/l. Furosemide was used to inhibit the interaction of thyroxine with serum T(4)-binding sites. Human serum T(4) values obtained by this method correlated well with those obtained by a radioimmunoassay (y=1.9+1.0x, r=0.97, N=72). CONCLUSIONS: Chemical modification of glycogen phosphorylase b with a T(4) derivative led to the development of a simple homogenous enzyme immunoassay for T(4) analysis with the desired sensitivity and accuracy.",M1
11403654,"Kinetics of denaturation of rabbit skeletal muscle glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b by guanidine hydrochloride.The kinetics of denaturation and aggregation of rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b in the presence of guanidine hydrochloride (GuHCl) have been studied. The curve of inactivation of phosphorylase b in time includes a region of the fast decline in the enzymatic activity, an intermediate plateau, and a part with subsequent decrease in the enzymatic activity. The fact that the shape of the inactivation curves is dependent on the enzyme concentration testifies to the dissociative mechanism of inactivation. The dissociation of phosphorylase b dimers into monomers in the presence of GuHCl is supported by sedimentation data. The rate of phosphorylase b aggregation in the presence of GuHCl rises as the denaturant concentration increases to 1.12 M; at higher concentration of GuHCl, suppression of aggregation occurs. At rather low concentration of the protein (0.25 mg/ml), the terminal phase of aggregation follows the kinetics of a monomolecular reaction (the reaction rate constant is equal to 0.082 min(-1); 1 M GuHCl, 25 degrees C). At higher concentration of phosphorylase b (0.75 mg/ml), aggregation proceeds as a trimolecular reaction.",M1
11391834,"Determination of metabolite and regulatory enzyme levels in Dirofilaria immitis and Ascaris suum: a comparative study.Studies on metabolite levels in Dirofilaria immitis revealed similarities in several metabolites with those of Ascaris suum. The glycogen level in the filariid was however 3-4 times lower than that in A. suum. Levels of three regulatory enzymes were also determined in D. immitis and compared with those in A. suum. The activities of Hexokinase and Phosphofructokinase were similar. However, the levels of Glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b appeared to be much lower in the filariid than in A. suum. The subtle but important differences observed may reflect modifications of the parasite enzymes suggesting salient differences in the regulation of energy production from carbohydrates in the worms. The differences may also represent specialization required for the unique life style of the worms in their different locations in their hosts.",M1
11391645,"Daily variation in the distribution of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> in the suprachiasmatic nucleus of Syrian hamsters.Dynamic changes in astrocytic processes in the Syrian hamster suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) have been reported with maximal process extension in the light phase and maximal process retraction in the dark phase of a daily light:dark cycle. In the present study, we asked whether dynamic changes occur in the distribution of an astrocytic metabolic marker, glycogen phosphorylase (GP), using a histochemical assay to reveal the distribution of both active and total GP, in the hamster SCN. Changes in glial acidic fibrillary protein (GFAP) immunoreactivity also were assessed using a relative optical density measure (ROD). We observed changes in the localization and distribution of GP both in the SCN and in the paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVN) as a function of time of day. In the light phase, there were concentrated, large, dot-like deposits of GP throughout the SCN and PVN on an empty background. In the dark phase, diffuse, small, granular particles were seen throughout both nuclei. Selectively, in the dark-phase SCN, these granular particles formed a rim of intense GP reactivity on the lateral, ventral, posterior, and medial borders. Significantly higher levels of GP reactivity were seen in anterior sections of the medial optic chiasm in the light phase. GFAP-immunoreactive astrocytic processes had higher ROD levels in the dark phase. In conclusion, the astrocytic metabolic marker, GP, exhibits a significant daily variation in localization in both the SCN and the PVN that correlates with dynamic changes in the distribution of astrocytic processes in the SCN. Increased GP activity also occurs in astrocytes among optic fibers subjacent to the SCN during light input.",M1
11385590,"Effects of acute handling stress on whitefish Coregonus lavaretus after prolonged exposure to biologically treated and untreated bleached kraft mill effluent.Exposure of fish to water of impaired quality has been shown to disrupt the function of the hypothalamo-pituitary-interrenal (HPI) axis and alter the interpretation of data from field studies due to the varying effects of handling and delayed sampling on exposed and reference animals. In the present study, juvenile whitefish, Coregonus lavaretus, were exposed for 6 weeks to diluted (4-8%) untreated and biologically treated bleached kraft mill effluent (BKME) and their response to acute handling was investigated. Liver microsomal EROD activity and glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> (GPase) activity, in addition to gill Na+-K+-ATPase activity, and blood hemoglobin and hematocrit levels were increased in whitefish exposed for 6 weeks to untreated BKME, whereas those exposed to treated BKME exhibited increased blood hemoglobin and red blood cell K+ concentrations. Both handling procedures, exposure to a shallow water (10 cm, 5 min) and to an air challenge (10 s air/10 s water/30 s air/10 s water/10 s air), resulted in acute physiological stress, as recorded after 5-, 60-, and 120-min recovery periods. Following air exposure, the levels of plasma cortisol, blood glucose, hemoglobin, and hematocrit as well as the liver GPase activity were increased, and liver glycogen concentration decreased in control fish. These responses were attenuated in fish exposed to untreated or treated BKME. Plasma estradiol and testosterone levels were not affected by the BKME exposures or by the air challenge. Handling also resulted in attenuated EROD induction in fish exposed to untreated BKME. According to the present findings, the sensitivity of some widely used cellular and physiological variables may be improved by time-dependent standardization when interpreting data obtained following delayed sampling.",M1
11384772,"Amphibian glucagon family peptides: potent metabolic regulators in fish hepatocytes.Peptides analogous to glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) have been isolated from amphibian pancreas and intestine, and their amino acid sequences and cDNA structures elucidated. Just like their mammalian counterpart, these peptides are potent insulinotropins in mammalian pancreatic cells. We show here that these peptides also exert strong glycogenolytic actions when applied to dispersed fish hepatocytes. We compared the potencies of three synthetic GLP-1s from Xenopus laevis and two native GLP-1s from Bufo marinus in the activation of glycogenolysis in the hepatocytes of a marine rockfish (Sebastes caurinus) and two freshwater catfish (Ameiurus nebulosus and A. melas), and demonstrated their effectiveness in increasing the degree of phosphorylation of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e>. We also compared the glycogenolytic potency of the peptides with those of human GLP-1 and glucagons from human and B. marinus. Sensitivity to these peptides is species-specific, with the rockfish responding at lower concentrations to GLP-1s and the two catfish reacting better to glucagons. However, the relative potency of the amphibian GLP-1s and glucagons is similar in the three species. Xenopus GLP-1C (xGLP-1C) is consistently more potent than xGLP-1B, while xGLP-1A displays the smallest activation of glycogenolysis. Similarly, Bufo GLP-1(32)-the peptide with the highest amino acid sequence identity to xGLP-1C-always shows a higher potency than Bufo GLP-1(37), which is closely related to xGLP-1B. The relative hierarchy of these glycogenolytic GLP-1s differs from their ranking as insulinotropins in mammalian beta-cells. In the rockfish system, Bufo glucagon-36, a C-terminally extended glucagon, is more potent than the shorter bovine glucagon and Bufo glucagon-29 in the activation of glycogenolysis; when tested in A. nebulosus hepatocytes, bovine and amphibian glucagons are equipotent. Amphibian GLP-1s and glucagons activate glycogenolysis in fish hepatocytes through increased phosphorylation of glycogen phosphorylase, implying involvement of the adenylyl cyclase/protein kinase A system in signal transduction. We conclude that the broad physiological effectiveness of GLP-1 has been retained throughout vertebrate evolution, and that both insulinotropic activity and glycogenolytic actions belong to the repertoire of GLP-1.",M1
11384100,"Frequent p53 mutation in brain (fetal)-type glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> positive foci adjacent to human 'de novo' colorectal carcinomas.'de novo' carcinogenesis has been advocated besides 'adenoma carcinoma sequence' as another dominant pathway leading to colorectal carcinoma. Our recent study has demonstrated that the distribution of brain (fetal)-type glycogen phosphorylase (BGP) positive foci (BGP foci) has a close relationship with the location of 'de novo' carcinoma. The aims of the present study are to investigate genetic alteration in the BGP foci and to characterize them in the 'de novo' carcinogenesis. 17 colorectal carcinomas without any adenoma component expressing both immunoreactive p53 and BGP protein were selected from 96 resected specimens from our previous study. Further investigations to examine the proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA)-labelling index, and the p53 and the codon 12 of K-ras mutation using the polymerase chain reaction-single strand conformation polymorphism were performed in the BGP foci, BGP negative mucosa and carcinoma. The BGP foci were observed sporadically in the transitional mucosa adjacent to the carcinoma in all cases. The PCNA labelling index in the BGP foci was significantly higher than that in the BGP negative mucosa (P&lt; 0.001). p53 mutations were observed in 8 carcinomas, but no K-ras mutation was detected. Interestingly, although none of the overexpressions of p53 protein was detected immunohistochemically in the BGP positive foci, the p53 gene frequently (41.2% of the BGP foci tested) mutated in spite of no K-ras mutation. The present study demonstrates potentially premalignant foci in the colorectal transitional mucosa with frequent p53 gene mutation. It is suggested that BGP foci are promising candidates for the further investigation of 'de novo' colorectal carcinogenesis.",M1
11375325,"Stimulating effects of low-dose fructose on insulin-stimulated hepatic glycogen synthesis in humans.Fructose has been shown to have a catalytic effect on glucokinase activity in vitro; however, its effects on hepatic glycogen metabolism in humans is unknown. To address this question, we used (13)C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to noninvasively assess rates of hepatic glycogen synthesis and glycogenolysis under euglycemic (approximately 5 mmol/l) hyperinsulinemic conditions (approximately 400 pmol/l) with and without a low-dose infusion of fructose (approximately 3.5 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1)). Six healthy overnight-fasted subjects were infused for 4 h with somatostatin (0.1 micromol. kg(-1). min(-1)) and insulin (240 pmol. m(-2). min(-1)). During the initial 120 min, [1-(13)C]glucose was infused to assess glycogen synthase flux followed by an approximately 120-min infusion of unlabeled glucose to assess rates of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> flux. Acetaminophen was given to assess the percent contribution of the direct and indirect (gluconeogenic) pathways of glycogen synthesis by the (13)C enrichment of plasma UDP-glucuronide and C-1 of glucose. In the control studies, the flux through glycogen synthase and glycogen phosphorylase was 0.31 +/- 0.06 and 0.17 +/- 0.04 mmol/l per min, respectively, and the rate of net hepatic glycogen synthesis was 0.14 +/- 0.05 mmol/l per min. In the fructose studies, the glycogen synthase flux increased 2.5-fold to 0.79 +/- 0.16 mmol/l per min (P = 0.018 vs. control), whereas glycogen phosphorylase flux remained unchanged (0.24 +/- 0.06; P = 0.16 vs. control). The infusion of fructose resulted in a threefold increase in rates of net hepatic glycogen synthesis (0.54 +/- 0.12 mmol/l per min; P = 0.008 vs. control) without affecting the pathways of hepatic glycogen synthesis (direct pathway approximately 60% in both groups). We conclude that during euglycemic hyperinsulinemia, a low-dose fructose infusion causes a threefold increase in net hepatic glycogen synthesis exclusively through stimulation of glycogen synthase flux. Because net hepatic glycogen synthesis has been shown to be diminished in patients with poorly controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes, stimulation of hepatic glycogen synthesis by this mechanism may be of potential therapeutic value.",M1
11370734,"Glycogen-forming function of hepatocytes in cirrhotically altered rat liver after treatment with chorionic gonadotropin.Using cytofluorimetric and biochemical studies on serial supravital liver punctate biopsies, effects of chorionic gonadotropin (CG) on recovery of hepatocyte glycogen-forming function in the cirrhotically altered rat liver were analyzed. The biopsies were taken first from rats with experimental cirrhosis produced by their 6-month-long poisoning with the hepatotoxic poison CCl4, then from the same animals in 1, 3, and 6 month after cessation of their poisoning, either on treatment with CG or with no treatment. In smears of isolated hepatocytes, the contents of the total glycogen (TG) and of its labile and stable fractions (LF and SF, respectively) were measured. In liver homogenates, activities of glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase), glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e>, and glycogen synthetase were determined. It was found that the threefold increased TG content in hepatocytes of cirrhotic liver returned to the normal level in 3 months without treatment, while as soon as in 1 month in the case of the treatment with CG. The CG treatment for 3 months resulted in normalization of the glycogen fraction composition that had been changed in cirrhotic liver, whereas without treatment, the glycogen LF/SF ratio remained changed even after 6 months after cessation of the poisoning with CCl4. Activity of G6Pase was fourfold reduced in cirrhosis; in 3 months after the end of poisoning, under effect of CG, the activity increased to the normal level, but somewhat decreased subsequently. In the animals that were not treated with CG, the decrease in the G6Pase activity after the cessation of the CCl4 poisoning was even more marked than in the CG-treated rats. Activities of two other enzymes of glycogen metabolism did not differ statistically significantly from the norm throughout the entire experiment. The data obtained indicate that the use of CG for rehabilitation of the glycogen-forming function of the cirrhotically altered liver is more efficient than other ways of treatment studied previously, such as partial hepatectomy or a high-carbohydrate diet.",M1

Using immobilized flavopiridol, we identified glycogen phosphorylases (GP) from liver and brain as flavopiridol binding proteins from HeLa cell extract. Purified rabbit muscle GP also bound to the flavopiridol affinity column. GP is the rate-limiting enzyme in intracellular glycogen breakdown. Flavopiridol significantly inhibited the AMP-activated GP-b form of the purified rabbit muscle isoenzyme (IC50 of 1 microM at 0.8 mM AMP), but was less inhibitory to the active phosphorylated form of GP, GP-a (IC50 of 2.5 microM). The AMP-bound GP-a form was poorly inhibited by flavopiridol (40% at 10 microM). Increasing concentrations of the allosteric effector AMP resulted in a linear decrease in the GP-inhibitory activity of flavopiridol suggesting interference between flavopiridol and AMP. In contrast the GP inhibitor caffeine had no effect on the relative GP inhibition by flavopiridol, suggesting an additive effect of caffeine. Flavopiridol also inhibited the phosphorylase kinase-catalyzed phosphorylation of GP-b by inhibiting the kinase in vitro. Flavopiridol thus is able to interfere with both activating modifications of GP-b, AMP activation and phosphorylation. In A549 NSCLC cells flavopiridol treatment caused glycogen accumulation despite of an increase in GP activity, suggesting direct GP inhibition in vivo rather than inhibition of GP activation by phosphorylase kinase. These results suggest that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor flavopiridol interferes with glycogen degradation, which may be responsible for flavopiridol's cytotoxicity and explain its resistance in some cell lines.",M1
11361132,"Purification and characterization of the maize amyloplast stromal 112-kDa starch <e>phosphorylase</e>.A plastidic 112-kDa starch phosphorylase (SP) has been identified in the amyloplast stromal fraction of maize. This starch phosphorylase was purified 310-fold from maize endosperm and characterized with respect to its enzymological and kinetic properties. The purification procedure included ammonium sulfate fractionation, Sephacryl 300 HR chromatography, affinity starch adsorption, Q-Sepharose, and Mono Q chromatography. The procedure resulted in a nearly homogeneous enzyme preparation as determined by native and SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Anti-SP antibodies recognized the purified 112-kDa SP enzyme and N-terminal amino acid sequence analysis confirmed that the purified enzyme is the amyloplast stromal 112-kDa SP. Analysis of the purified enzyme by Superose 6 gel filtration chromatography indicated that the native enzyme consisted of two identical subunits. The pH optimum for the enzyme was 6.0 in the synthetic direction and 5.5 in the phosphorolytic direction. SP activity was inhibited by thioreactive agents, diethyl pyrocarbonate, phenylglyoxal, and ADP-glucose. The activation energies for the synthetic and phosphorolytic reactions were 11.1 and 16.9 kcal/mol, respectively, and the enzyme was thermally labile above 50 degrees C. Results of kinetic experiments indicated that the enzyme catalyzes its reaction via a sequential Bi Bi mechanism. The Km value for amylopectin was eight-fold lower than that of glycogen. A kinetic analysis indicated that the phosphorolytic reaction was favored over the synthetic reaction when malto-oligosaccharides (4 to 7 units) were used as substrates. The specificity constants (Vmax/Km) of the enzyme measured in either the synthetic or the phosphorolytic directions increased with increasing chain length.",M1
11361069,"Regulation of E. coli glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> activity by HPr.Bacteria sense continuous changes in their environment and adapt metabolically to effectively compete with other organisms for limiting nutrients. One system which plays an important part in this adaptation response is the phosphoenol-pyruvate:sugar phosphotransferase system (PTS). Many proteins interact with and are regulated by PTS components in bacteria. Here we review the interaction with and allosteric regulation of Escherichia coli glycogen phosphorylase (GP) activity by the histidine phosphocarrier protein HPr, which acts as part of a phosphoryl shuttle between enzyme I and sugar-specific proteins of the PTS. HPr mediates crosstalk between PTS sugar uptake and glycogen breakdown. The evolution of the allosteric regulation of E. coli GP by HPr is compared to that of other phosphorylases.",M1
11341967,"The role of calcium in the activation of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> in the fat body of the fruit beetle, Pachnoda sinuata, by hypertrehalosaemic hormone.The role of calcium in the mediation of the hypertrehalosaemic signal of the endogenous neuropeptide Mem-CC was investigated in vitro and in vivo in the cetoniid beetle Pachnoda sinuata. The presence of Mem-CC increases the influx of extracellular 45Ca(2+) into the fat body as well as the efflux of 45Ca(2+) from pre-loaded fat body into the incubation medium. Extracellular calcium is essential to exert maximal activation of the fat body glycogen phosphorylase by saturating doses of Mem-CC (0.3 nM). This effect of extracellular Ca(2+) is dose-dependent: maximal activation of glycogen phosphorylase by Mem-CC is achieved at calcium concentrations of approximately 1.2 mM and the ED(50) was calculated to be 0.6 mM. Both, thimerosal and thapsigargin caused a stimulation of carbohydrate metabolism in the fat body, suggesting that a release of calcium from the endoplasmic reticulum is involved in this process. However, neither entry of extracellular calcium nor the release from the endoplasmic reticulum are sufficient alone for a full activation of the phosphorylase. The results of the present study suggest that calcium from extracellular as well as from intracellular sources is part of the second messenger system for the transduction of the hypertrehalosaemic signal of Mem-CC in the fat body of P. sinuata.",M1
11340058,"Structural relationships among regulated and unregulated <e>phosphorylases</e>.Species and tissue-specific isozymes of phosphorylase display differences in regulatory properties consistent with their distinct roles in particular organisms and tissues. In this review, we compare crystallographic structures of regulated and unregulated phosphorylases, including maltodextrin phosphorylase (MalP) from Escherichia coli, glycogen phosphorylase from yeast, and mammalian isozymes from muscle and liver tissues. Mutagenesis and functional studies supplement the structural work and provide insights into the structural basis for allosteric control mechanisms. MalP, a simple, unregulated enzyme, is contrasted with the more complicated yeast and mammalian phosphorylases that have evolved regulatory sites onto the basic catalytic architecture. The human liver and muscle isozymes show differences structurally in their means of invoking allosteric activation. Phosphorylation, though common to both the yeast and mammalian enzymes, occurs at different sites and activates the enzymes by surprisingly different mechanisms.",M1
20030590,"<e>Phosphorylase</e> and the origin of reversible protein phosphorylation.This article presents a historical account of the discovery of reversible protein phosphorylation. The process was uncovered in the mid-1950s in a study designed to elucidate the complex hormonal regulation of skeletal muscle glycogen phosphorylase. This enzyme was originally thought to be regulated by AMP now known to serve as an allosteric effector. By contrast, hormonal regulation was found to result from a phosphorylation of the protein triggered by Ca(2+) and ATP which activate phosphorylase kinase; the reverse reaction is catalyzed by a phosphorylase phosphatase. Although that reaction is extremely simple, it came nevertheless as a complete surprise because essentially nothing was known at that time about the structure and function of phosphoproteins. This study led to the establishment of the first hormonal cascade of successive enzymatic reactions, kinases acting on kinases, initiated by cAMP discovered by Earl Sutherland. It also showed how two different physiological processes (carbohydrate metabolism and muscle contraction) could be regulated in concert. The regulation of phosphorylase was so straightforward that it was thought to represent the prototype for these kinds of interconversions. We know today that it was almost the absolute exception.",M2
20029514,"Effect of extracellular osmolality on metabolism in contracting mammalian skeletal muscle in vitro.Extensive research has been conducted on hepatocyte metabolism perturbed under the influence of anisosmotic stress. However, much less is known about the behaviour of skeletal muscle metabolism under similar conditions. After establishing a working model to study anisosmotic stress in resting mammalian skeletal muscle, the current study tested the hypothesis that hyperosmotic (HYPER) stress would lead to increased creatine, lactate, and measured enzyme activity, whereas hypo-osmotic (HYPO) stress would lead to decreased metabolites and enzyme activity vs. iso-osmotic (ISO) stress post contraction. Rat soleus (SOL) and extensor digitorum longus (EDL) were isolated and incubated in an organ bath (95% O2, 5% CO2, pH 7.4, 25 degrees C) altered to targeted osmotic conditions (ISO, 290 osmol.L(-1); HYPO, 180 osmol.L(-1); HYPER, 400 osmol.L(-1)). Muscle samples were flash frozen after 10 min of contraction. Post contraction, muscle water content in the SOL HYPO condition was 18% greater than ISO, and HYPER had approximately 14% less water content than ISO (p &lt; 0.05). In the HYPO condition, EDL had 21% greater water content than ISO, and HYPER had 17% less water content than ISO (p &lt; 0.05). SOL HYPO resulted in higher phosphocreatine and lower lactate and creatine vs. HYPER (p &lt; 0.05) but there were no differences in EDL between HYPO and HYPER. Pyruvate dehydrogenase activity increased in SOL HYPER vs. HYPO, whereas glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> a increased in EDL HYPER vs. HYPO. In conclusion, fibre-type-specific responses exist after contraction such that when SOL muscle is perturbed in HYPER, as compared with HYPO, media, metabolic activity increases. Future work should focus on glucose uptake-regulation during anisosmotic conditions.",M2

Inhibitory effect of FAD.Dynamic light scattering was used to study the interaction of phosphorylase kinase (PhK) and glycogen phosphorylase b (Phb) from rabbit skeletal muscle with glycogen under molecular crowding conditions arising from the presence of 1 M trimethylamine N-oxide and at physiological ionic strength. The mean value of hydrodynamic radius of the initial glycogen particles was 52 nm. Crowding stimulated Phb and PhK combined binding on glycogen particles. Two-stage character of PhK binding to glycogen particles containing adsorbed Phb was found in the presence of the crowding agent. At the initial stage, limited size particles with hydrodynamic radius of approximately 220 nm are formed, whereas the second stage is accompanied by linear growth of hydrodynamic radius. Flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD) selectively inhibited PhK binding at the second stage. The data indicate that in the first stage Phb is involved in PhK binding by glycogen particles containing adsorbed Phb, whereas PhK binding in the second stage does not involve Phb.",M2

Among Caucasians, a large proportion of patients are homozygous for the R50X mutation, but other mutations can affect all the 20 exons of PYGM, making mutation detection laborious. We have developed a high-resolution melting (HRM) assay for mutation detection in PYGM. Twelve McArdle patients were investigated, in whom pre-screening had ruled out homozygosity or compound heterozygosity for the two common G205S and R50X mutations. In total, we identified 16 different variations. Thirteen of these are pathogenic, and three were classified as polymorphisms. Nine variations had not previously been described. One of the novel mutations, c.2430C &gt; T, was initially predicted to result in a silent G810G change, but cDNA analysis demonstrated that the mutation led to abnormal mRNA processing. The HRM protocol reduced the need for direct sequencing by approximately 85%, and is a good approach to search for new mutations in PYGM.",M2

In this study, we developed a highly sensitive and convenient assay for GP activity by analysing its chain-lengthening action on a fluorogenic maltooligosaccharide derivative in a glucose-1-phosphate-rich medium. Characterization of the substrate specificity of GP using pyridylaminated (PA-) maltooligosaccharides of various sizes revealed that a maltotetraosyl (Glc(4)) residue comprising the non-reducing-end of a PA-maltooligosaccharide is indispensable for the chain-lengthening action of GP, and PA-maltohexaose is the most suitable substrate for the purpose of this study. By using a high-performance liquid chromatograph equipped with a fluorescence spectrophotometer, PA-maltoheptaose produced by the chain elongation of PA-maltohexaose could be isolated and quantified at 10 fmol. This method was used to measure the GP activities of crude and purified GP preparations, and was demonstrated to have about 1,000 times greater sensitivity than the spectrophotometric orthophosphate assay.",M2
19155119,"Effect of proline on thermal inactivation, denaturation and aggregation of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b from rabbit skeletal muscle.It has been shown that the relatively low concentrations of proline (0.1 M) have a slight accelerating effect on thermal aggregation of glycogen phosphorylase b (Phb) from rabbit skeletal muscle registered by the accumulaton of the aggregated protein. The suppression of Phb aggregation at high proline concentrations is mainly due to the protective action of proline on the stage of unfolding of the Phb molecule. The enhancement of Phb stability in the presence of the high concentrations of proline was demonstrated by the data on differential scanning calorimetry, analytical ultracentrifugation and thermoinactivation kinetics. The construction of the protein aggregate size versus time plots allowed the acceleration of the stage of Phb aggregation in the presence of high concentrations of proline to be demonstrated. The obtained results are consistent with the predictions of the crowding theory.",M2
19146822,"Inactivation of rabbit muscle glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b by peroxynitrite revisited: does the nitration of Tyr613 in the allosteric inhibition site control enzymatic function?There is increasing evidence that sequence-specific formation of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT) may cause functional changes in target proteins. Recently, the nitration of Tyr residues in glycogen phosphorylase b (Ph-b) was implicated in the age-associated decline of protein function [Sharov et al., Exp. Gerontol. 41 (2006) 407-416]; in another report, the nitration of one specific residue, Tyr613, located in the allosteric inhibition site was hypothesized as a rationale for peroxynitrite inactivation [Dairou et al., J. Mol. Biol. 372 (2007) 1009-1021]. In this study, we have optimized the analysis of in-gel Ph-b digests by high performance liquid chromatography-electro spray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry, in order to achieve a quantitative analysis of nitration of individual Tyr residues at a high coverage of Tyr-containing sequences (92%). Our data do not confirm the role of Tyr613 nitration in the control of enzymatic function. Furthermore, we show here that the enzymatic activity of Ph-b does not directly correlate with the protein nitration levels, and that the modification of Cys and, potentially, other amino acid residues can better rationalize Ph-b inactivation by peroxynitrite.",M2

Oxidation of the beta-D-gluco derivative with H(2)O(2)/Na(2)WO(4) gave the corresponding S-oxide (sulfoxide). DBU-induced elimination of methyl acrylate from the beta-D-gluco and beta-D-galacto configured S,S-dioxides (sulfones) gave O-peracetylated beta-D-glycopyranosyl-1-C-sulfinates which, on treatment with H(2)NOSO(3)H, furnished the corresponding beta-D-glycopyranosyl-1-C-sulfonamides. Radical-mediated bromination of the protected methyl 3-(beta-D-glycopyranosylthio)propanoate S,S-dioxides gave mixtures of 1-C- and 5-C-bromoglycosyl compounds.

Glycogen has also been found in different cell types of the enteric nervous system (ENS), the largest and most complex component of the peripheral nervous system. In the present work we have demonstrated, by application of isozyme-specific antibodies, the presence of isozymes of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), one of the major control sites in glycogen metabolism, in the rat ENS. Immunohistochemistry revealed that isoform BB (brain) is the predominant isozyme expressed in enteric glial cells (EGC) and rare neurons of the myenteric and submucosal plexuses. Isoform MM (muscle) appears in cells which are, according to their location and morphology, probably interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC). In addition, both GP isoforms are expressed in longitudinal and circular intestinal smooth muscle layers. As GP BB is mainly regulated by the cellular AMP level, a special function of glycogen in the energy supply of neural gut functions is suggested.",M2

Western blotting and quantitative reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) experiments revealed that at the protein level, but not at the mRNA level, the content of GP BB is similar in heart and brain. In contrast, GP MM is more abundant in the heart than in the brain. Immunocytochemically GP BB was colocalized with GP MM in cardiomyocytes.

18525011,"Fiber-specific responses of muscle glycogen repletion in fasted rats physically active during recovery from high-intensity physical exertion.Mild physical activity performed immediately after a bout of intense exercise in fasting humans results in net glycogen breakdown in their slow oxidative (SO) muscle fibers and glycogen repletion in their fast twitch (FT) fibers. Because several animal species carry a low proportion of SO fibers, it is unclear whether they can also replenish glycogen in their FT fibers under these conditions. Given that most skeletal muscles in rats are poor in SO fibers (&lt;5%), this issue was examined using groups of 24-h fasted Wistar rats (n=10) that swam for 3 min at high intensity with a 10% weight followed by either a 60-min rest (passive recovery, PR) or a 30-min swim with a 0.5% weight (active recovery, AR) preceding a 30-min rest. The 3-min sprint caused 61-79% glycogen fall across the muscles examined, but not in the soleus (SOL). Glycogen repletion during AR without food was similar to PR in the white gastrocnemius (WG), where glycogen increased by 71%, and less than PR in both the red and mixed gastrocnemius (RG, MG). Glycogen fell by 26% during AR in the SOL. Following AR, glycogen increased by 36%, 87%, and 37% in the SOL, RG, and MG, respectively, and this was accompanied by the sustained activation of glycogen synthase and inhibition of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> in the RG and MG.

The latter accounts for more than 50% of the mutated alleles in most Caucasian patient populations. Mutations resulting in PTC could trigger the degradation of mRNA through a mechanism known as nonsense mediated decay (NMD). To investigate if NMD affects the levels of transcripts containing PYGM mutations, 28 Spanish patients with McArdle disease, harboring 17 different mutations with PTCs in 77% of their alleles, were studied. Transcripts levels of PYGM were measured and sequenced. We assessed that 92% of patients showed NMD. The most frequent mutation (p.R50X) elicited decay in all the genotypes tested.

The hydrodynamic radius of the start aggregates determined from the initial linear parts of the dependences of the hydrodynamic radius (R(h)) on time was found to be 16.7 +/- 1.0 nm. At rather high values of time, the R(h) value for the protein aggregates becomes proportional to t(1/1.8) = t(0.56) suggesting that the aggregation process proceeds in the regime of diffusion-limited cluster-cluster aggregation. In the presence of alpha-crystallin, a protein possessing the chaperone-like activity, the process of protein aggregation switches to the regime of reaction-limited cluster-cluster aggregation as indicated by the exponential dependence of the R(h) value on time. It was shown that the addition of alpha-crystallin raises the rate of thermal inactivation of Phb. These data in combination with the results of the study of interaction of Phb with alpha-crystallin by analytical ultracentrifugation suggest that alpha-crystallin interacts with the intermediates of unfolding of the Phb molecule.",M2

The wealth of data from studies of this enzyme in vitro and the need for a mathematical representation for use in the study of metabolic control systems make this enzyme an ideal subject for a mathematical model. We applied a two-part approach to the analysis of the kinetics of glycogen phosphorylase b (GPb). First, a continuous state model of enzyme-ligand interactions supported the view that two phosphates and four ATP or AMP molecules can bind to the enzyme, a result that agrees with spectroscopic and crystallographic studies. Second, using minimum error estimates from continuous state model fits to published data (that agreed well with reported error), we used a discrete state model of internal molecular events to show that GPb exists in three discrete states (two of which are inactive) and that state transitions are concerted. The results also show that under certain concentrations of substrate and effector, ATP can activate the enzyme, while under other conditions, it can competetively inhibit or noncompetitively inhibit the enzyme. This result is unexpected but is consistent with spectroscopic, crystallographic, and kinetic experiments and can explain several previously unexplained phenomena regarding GPb activity in vivo and in vitro.",M2

17706198,"Evidence for the formation of start aggregates as an initial stage of protein aggregation.The kinetics of thermal aggregation of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase from rabbit skeletal muscles were studied using dynamic light scattering. Use of high concentrations of the enzymes (1-3 mg/ml) provided a simultaneous registration of the native enzyme forms and protein aggregates. It was shown that initially registered aggregates (start aggregates) were large-sized particles. The hydrodynamic radius of the start aggregates was about 100 nm. The intermediate states between the native enzyme forms and start aggregates were not detected. The initial increase in the light scattering intensity is connected with accumulation of the start aggregates, the size of the latter remaining unchanged. From a certain moment in time aggregates of higher order, formed as a result of sticking of the start aggregates, make a major contribution to the enhancement of the light scattering intensity.",M2
17693425,"Glutathione-dependent reduction of arsenate by glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> a reaction coupled to glycogenolysis.Arsenate (As(V)) is reduced in the body to the more toxic arsenite (As(III)). We have shown that two enzymes catalyzing phosphorolytic cleavage of their substrates, namely purine nucleoside phosphorylase and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, can reduce As(V) in presence of an appropriate thiol and their substrates. Another phosphorolytic enzyme that may also reduce As(V) is glycogen phosphorylase (GP). With inorganic phosphate (P(i)), GP catalyzes the breakdown of glycogen to glucose-1-phosphate; however, it also accepts As(V). Testing the hypothesis that GP can reduce As(V), we incubated As(V) with the phosphorylated GPa or the dephosphorylated GPb purified from rabbit muscle and quantified the As(III) formed from As(V) by high-performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry. In the presence of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), glycogen, and glutathione (GSH), both GP forms reduced As(V) at rates increasing with enzyme and As(V) concentrations. The As(V) reductase activity of GPa was 10-fold higher than that of GPb. However, incubating GPb with GP kinase and ATP (that converts GPb to GPa) increased As(V) reduction by phosphorylase up to the rate produced by GPa incubated under the same conditions. High concentration of inorganic sulfate, which activates GPb like phosphorylation, also promoted reduction of As(V) by GPb. As(V) reduction by GPa (like As(V) reduction in rats) required GSH. It also required glycogen (substrate for GP) and was stimulated by AMP (allosteric activator of GP) even at low micromolar concentrations. P(i), substrate for GP competing with As(V), inhibited As(III) formation moderately at physiological concentrations. Glucose-1-phosphate, the product of GP-catalyzed glycogenolysis, also decreased As(V) reduction. Summarizing, GP is the third phosphorolytic enzyme identified capable of reducing As(V) in vitro. For reducing As(V) by GP, GSH and glycogen are indispensable, suggesting that the reduction is linked to glycogenolysis. While its in vivo significance remains to be tested, further characterization of the GP-catalyzed As(V) reduction is presented in the adjoining paper.",M2
17693424,"Glutathione-dependent reduction of arsenate by glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> responsiveness to endogenous and xenobiotic inhibitors.Rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase-a (GPa) reduces arsenate (As(V)) to the more toxic arsenite (As(III)) in a glutathione (GSH)-dependent fashion. To determine whether reduction of As(V) by GPa is countered by compounds known to inhibit GP-catalyzed glycogenolysis, the effects of thiol reagents, endogenous compounds (glucose, ATP, ADP) as well as nonspecific glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors (GPIs; caffeine, quercetin, flavopiridol [FP]), and specific GPIs (1,4-dideoxy-1,4-imino-D-arabinitol [DAB], BAY U6751, CP320626) were tested on reduction of As(V) by rabbit muscle GPa in the presence of glycogen (substrate), AMP (activator), and GSH, and the As(III) formed from As(V) was quantified by high-performance liquid chromatography-hydride generation-atomic fluorescence spectrometry. The As(V)-reducing activity of GPa was moderately sensitive to thiol reagents. Glucose above 5mM and ADP or ATP at physiological levels diminished GPa-catalyzed As(V) reduction. All GPIs inhibited As(V) reduction by GPa in a concentration-dependent fashion; however, their effects were differentially affected by glucose (10mM) or AMP (200microM instead of 25microM), known modulators of the action of some GPIs on the GP-catalyzed glycogenolysis. Inhibition of As(V) reduction by DAB and quercetin was not influenced by glucose or AMP. Glucose that potentiates the inhibitory effects of caffeine, BAY U6751, and CP320626 on the glycogenolytic activity of GPa also enhanced the inhibitory effects of these GPIs on GPa-catalyzed As(V) reduction. AMP at high concentration alleviated the inhibition by BAY U6751 and CP320626 (whose antagonistic effect on GP-catalyzed glycogen breakdown is also AMP sensitive), whereas the inhibition in As(V) reduction by FP or caffeine was little affected by AMP. Thus, GPIs inhibit both the glycogenolytic and As(V)-reducing activities of GP, supporting that the latter is coupled to glycogenolysis. It was also shown that a GPa-rich extract of rat liver contained GSH-dependent As(V)-reducing activity that was inhibited by specific GPIs, suggesting that the liver-type GPa can also catalyze reduction of As(V).",M2
17689562,"Nitration of a critical tyrosine residue in the allosteric inhibitor site of muscle glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> impairs its catalytic activity.Muscle glycogen phosphorylase (GP) is a key enzyme in glucose metabolism, and its impairment can lead to muscle dysfunction. Tyrosine nitration of glycogen phosphorylase occurs during aging and has been suggested to be involved in progressive loss of muscle performance. Here, we show that GP (in its T and R form) is irreversibly impaired by exposure to peroxynitrite, a biological nitrogen species known to nitrate reactive tyrosine residues, and to be involved in physiological and pathological processes. Kinetic and biochemical analysis indicated that irreversible inactivation of GP by peroxynitrite is due to the fast (k(inact)=3 x 10(4) M(-1) s(-1)) nitration of a unique tyrosine residue of the enzyme. Endogenous GP was tyrosine nitrated and irreversibly inactivated in skeletal muscle cells upon exposure to peroxynitrite, with concomitant impairment of glycogen mobilization. Ligand protection assays and mass spectrometry analysis using purified GP suggested that the peroxynitrite-dependent inactivation of the enzyme could be due to the nitration of Tyr613, a key amino acid of the allosteric inhibitor site of the enzyme. Our findings suggest that GP functions may be regulated by tyrosine nitration.",M2
17600143,"FR258900, a potential anti-hyperglycemic drug, binds at the allosteric site of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e>.FR258900 has been discovered as a novel inhibitor of human liver glycogen phosphorylase a and proved to suppress hepatic glycogen breakdown and reduce plasma glucose concentrations in diabetic mice models. To elucidate the mechanism of inhibition, we have determined the crystal structure of the cocrystallized rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b-FR258900 complex and refined it to 2.2 A resolution. The structure demonstrates that the inhibitor binds at the allosteric activator site, where the physiological activator AMP binds. The contacts from FR258900 to glycogen phosphorylase are dominated by nonpolar van der Waals interactions with Gln71, Gln72, Phe196, and Val45' (from the symmetry-related subunit), and also by ionic interactions from the carboxylate groups to the three arginine residues (Arg242, Arg309, and Arg310) that form the allosteric phosphate-recognition subsite. The binding of FR258900 to the protein promotes conformational changes that stabilize an inactive T-state quaternary conformation of the enzyme. The ligand-binding mode is different from those of the potent phenoxy-phthalate and acyl urea inhibitors, previously described, illustrating the broad specificity of the allosteric site.",M2

16879805,"Immunocytochemical analysis of rat vagus nerve by antibodies against glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> isozymes.Glycogen is an endogenous store of glucose equivalents for energy metabolism in many tissues. The brain contains a significant amount of glycogen the role of which as an energy reserve is currently under debate. Apparently little is known concerning a possible role of glycogen in peripheral nerves. We have demonstrated immunocytochemically the presence of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), a key enzyme in glycogen metabolism, in large and small axons of the rat vagus nerve, but not in Schwann cells. Furthermore, the isozyme-specific antibodies applied detected only the presence of the brain isoform BB of GP, but not the muscle isoform MM. This is in agreement with the occurrence of solely the BB isoform in the few brain and spinal cord neurons that contain GP. In contrast, astroglial cells in brain and spinal cord have previously been shown to contain both isoforms. Since GP isozymes are regulated differentially, the expression of isoform BB may provide hints to possible functions of glycogen in the vagus nerve.",M2

The typical clinical presentation is characterized by exercise intolerance with cramps, and recurrent myoglobinuria. To date, 46 mutations in the PYGM gene have been detected in GSD-V patients. We report the mutational spectrum in 68 Italian patients. We identified 30 different mutations in the PYGM gene, including 19 mutations that have not been reported previously.

16731853,"The experimental type 2 diabetes therapy glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> inhibition can impair aerobic muscle function during prolonged contraction.Glycogen phosphorylase inhibition represents a promising strategy to suppress inappropriate hepatic glucose output, while muscle glycogen is a major source of fuel during contraction. Glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors (GPi) currently being investigated for the treatment of type 2 diabetes do not demonstrate hepatic versus muscle glycogen phosphorylase isoform selectivity and may therefore impair patient aerobic exercise capabilities. Skeletal muscle energy metabolism and function are not impaired by GPi during high-intensity contraction in rat skeletal muscle; however, it is unknown whether glycogen phosphorylase inhibitors would impair function during prolonged lower-intensity contraction. Utilizing a novel red cell-perfused rodent gastrocnemius-plantaris-soleus system, muscle was pretreated for 60 min with either 3 micromol/l free drug GPi (n=8) or vehicle control (n=7). During 60 min of aerobic contraction, GPi treatment resulted in approximately 35% greater fatigue. Muscle glycogen phosphorylase a form (P&lt;0.01) and maximal activity (P&lt;0.01) were reduced in the GPi group, and postcontraction glycogen (121.8 +/- 16.1 vs. 168.3 +/- 8.5 mmol/kg dry muscle, P&lt;0.05) was greater. Furthermore, lower muscle lactate efflux and glucose uptake (P&lt;0.01), yet higher muscle Vo(2), support the conclusion that carbohydrate utilization was impaired during contraction. Our data provide new confirmation that muscle glycogen plays an essential role during submaximal contraction. Given the critical role of exercise prescription in the treatment of type 2 diabetes, it will be important to monitor endurance capacity during the clinical evaluation of nonselective GPi. Alternatively, greater effort should be devoted toward the discovery of hepatic-selective GPi, hepatic-specific drug delivery strategies, and/or alternative strategies for controlling excess hepatic glucose production in type 2 diabetes.",M2

Using the extensive structural information available for the two glycogen phosphorylase conformers T (inactive) and R (active) with different ligands, we have applied the Monod-Wyman-Changeux model and analysed the results in the context of the exclusive binding of the inhibitors to the T state, meanwhile the substrate glucose-1-phosphate binds to both, the R and T states.

Ph-b isolated from 34 months old rats showed a statistically significant decrease in specific activity compared to 6 months old animals: 13.8+/-0.7 vs. 20.6+/-0.8 U mg(-1) protein, respectively. Western blot analysis of the purified Ph-b with anti-3-NT antibodies revealed an age-dependent accumulation of 3-nitrotyrosine (3-NT), quantified by reverse-phase HPLC-UV analysis to increase from 0.05+/-0.03 to 0.34+/-0.11 (mol 3-NT/mol Ph-b) for 6 vs. 34 months old rats, respectively. HPLC-nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry revealed the accumulation of 3-NT on Tyr113, Tyr161 and Tyr573. While nitration of Tyr113 was detected for both young and old rats, 3-NT at positions 161 and 573 was identified only for Ph-b isolated from 34 months old rats. The sequence of the rat muscle Ph-b was corrected based on our protein sequence mapping and a custom rat PHS2 sequence containing 17 differently located amino acid residues was used instead of the database sequence. The in vitro reaction of peroxynitrite with Ph-b resulted in the nitration of multiple Tyr residues at positions 51, 52, 113, 155, 185, 203, 262, 280, 404, 473, 731, and 732. Thus, the in vitro nitration conditions only mimic the nitration of a single Tyr residue observed in vivo suggesting alternative pathways controlling the accumulation of 3-NT in vivo.

Anti-chaperone MIF activity found by turbidimetry manifests itself in significantly accelerated protein aggregation and increased limiting value of apparent optical absorption at 360 nm and t --&gt; infinity in the sub-stoichiometric range of MIF concentrations. The aggregation kinetics is shown to have cooperative character. Possible reversibility of aggregation after removal of denaturing conditions was demonstrated using alcohol dehydrogenase aggregation at a temperature close to the physiological level (41.5 degrees C). This reversibility is caused by solubility of aggregates and stabilization of oligomeric structure of the substrate as a result of MIF binding to the partially denatured protein. The data suggest that in spite of distinct anti-chaperone effect, the chaperone-like activity of MIF can be observed in the case of heat stress removal and restoration of the system to normal conditions.",M2
16464598,"Binding of oxalyl derivatives of beta-d-glucopyranosylamine to muscle glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b.Five oxalyl derivatives of beta-d-glucopyranosylamine were synthesized as potential inhibitors of glycogen phosphorylase (GP). The compounds 1-4 were competitive inhibitors of rabbit muscle GPb (with respect to alpha-d-glucose-1-phosphate) with K(i) values of 0.2-1.4 mM, while compound 5 was not effective up to a concentration of 10 mM. In order to elucidate the structural basis of their inhibition, we analysed the structures of compounds 1-4 in complex with GPb at 1.93-1.96 Angstrom resolution. The complex structures reveal that the inhibitors can be accommodated at the catalytic site at approximately the same position as alpha-d-glucose and stabilize the T-state conformation of the 280 s loop by making several favourable contacts to Asp283 and Asn284 of this loop. Comparison with the lead compound N-acetyl-beta-d-glucopyranosylamine (6) shows that the hydrogen bonding interaction of the amide nitrogen with the main-chain carbonyl oxygen of His377 is not present in these complexes. The differences observed in the K(i) values of the four analogues can be interpreted in terms of subtle conformational changes of protein residues and shifts of water molecules in the vicinity of the catalytic site, variations in van der Waals interactions, conformational entropy and desolvation effects.",M2

Almost all flavonoids tested inhibited phosphorylated, active GPa, as well as unphosphorylated, adenosine monophosphate-activated GPb. However, inhibition of GPa was two-to-fourfold stronger than that of GPb. The flavonol quercetin and the anthocyanidins cyanidin and delphinidin turned out to be the most potent inhibitors of GPa, with concentration values where enzymatic activity is 50% of the respective control in the low micromolar range (&lt;5 microM).

16202983,"Glycogen metabolism in rat ependymal primary cultures: regulation by serotonin.Ependymal primary cultures are a model for studying ependymal energy metabolism. Intracellular glycogen is built up in the cultures dependent on culture age and the presence of glucose and glutamate. This energy store is mobilized upon glucose withdrawal, stimulation with isoproterenol, forskolin or serotonin and after uncoupling of oxidative phosphorylation from ATP production. Serotonin regulates ependymal glycogen metabolism predominantly via 5-HT receptor (5-HTR) 7, which elicits an increase in the level of ependymal cyclic AMP. Although the most abundant mRNAs for serotonin receptors are those of 5-HTR 2B and 5-HTR 3A, ependymal cells in primary culture do not respond to serotonin with an increase in their concentration of cytosolic calcium ions. The mRNAs of 5-HTRs 1A, 6, 1B, 5B, 7, 1/2C and 5A are also detectable in order of decreasing abundance. The mRNAs for 5-HTRs 1D, 1F, 3B and 4 are absent from the cultured cells. The ability of serotonin to mobilize ependymal glycogen depends on the culture age and the time allowed for glycogen buildup. During glycogen buildup time, glutamate is consumed by the cells. An increased ability of 5-HT to mobilize ependymal glycogen stores is noticed after the depletion of glutamate from the glycogen buildup medium. In ependymal primary cultures, cilia are colocalized with glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> isozyme BB, while the MM isoform is not expressed. It is known from the literature that an increase in the concentration of cytosolic cAMP in ependymal cells leads to a decrease in ciliary beat frequency.

The X-ray structure of screening hit 1 (IC50 = 2 microM) in a complex with rabbit muscle glycogen phosphorylase b reveals that 1 binds at the AMP site, the main allosteric effector site of the dimeric enzyme. A first cycle of chemical optimization supported by X-ray structural data yielded derivative 21, which inhibited hlGPa with an IC50 of 23 +/- 1 nM, but showed only moderate cellular activity in isolated rat hepatocytes (IC50 = 6.2 microM). Further optimization was guided by (i) a 3D pharmacophore model that was derived from a training set of 24 compounds and revealed the key chemical features for the biological activity and (ii) the 1.9 angstroms crystal structure of 21 in complex with hlGPa. A second set of compounds was synthesized and led to 42 with improved cellular activity (hlGPa IC50 = 53 +/- 1 nM; hepatocyte IC50 = 380 nM).

16157752,"Effect of fuels on exercise capacity in muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency.BACKGROUND: Muscle phosphoglycerate mutase deficiency (PGAMD) is a rare, recessively inherited metabolic myopathy that affects one of the last steps of glycolysis. Clinically, PGAMD resembles muscle <e>phosphorylase</e> deficiency (McArdle disease) and phosphofructokinase deficiency (PFKD). However, it is unknown whether PGAMD is associated with a second-wind phenomenon during exercise, as in McArdle disease, and whether patients with PGAMD, like patients with PFKD and McArdle disease, benefit from supplementation with fuels that bypass the metabolic block. OBJECTIVE: To investigate whether fuels that bypass the metabolic block can improve exercise capacity or whether exercise capacity improves during sustained exercise. DESIGN: Single-blind, placebo-controlled investigation of the effects of glucose, lactate, and intralipid on work capacity in patients with PGAMD. SETTING: National University Hospital, University of Copenhagen, and Neuromuscular Center, Institute for Exercise and Environmental Medicine. Patients Two unrelated men (21 and 26 years old) with PGAMD who since their teens had experienced muscle cramps, muscle pain, and episodes of myoglobinuria provoked by brief vigorous exercise, 4 patients with McArdle disease (mean +/- SD age, 32 +/- 5 years) with 0% residual phosphorylase activity in muscle, and 6 healthy, untrained male volunteers (mean +/- SD age, 23 +/- 1 years) were studied. INTERVENTIONS: Using constant and variable workload protocols on a cycle ergometer, it was investigated whether a spontaneous second wind occurs during exercise in patients with PGAMD, and using a constant workload protocol followed by an incremental load to exhaustion, it was tested whether infusion of lactate, glucose, or intralipid alters the exercise tolerance in PGAMD. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Whether a second wind occurs during exercise and whether fuels that bypass the metabolic block can improve exercise and oxidative capacity. RESULTS: In contrast to patients with McArdle disease, with whom they share many clinical features, in patients with PGAMD, cycle exercise and oxidative capacity are virtually normal, a second wind does not occur, and lipid and lactate supplements do not improve exercise capacity. CONCLUSION: Although the clinical manifestations of PGAMD mimic McArdle disease with respect to the presence of exertional muscle cramps, rhabdomyolysis, and myoglobinuria, this study shows that cycle exercise responses are strikingly different.",M2

Four individuals who had the same genotype for PYGM, showed a wide variability in the presentation of the clinical phenotype, including one patient with a restrictive respiratory pattern, which is unusual in McArdle's disease. Moreover, these patients were studied for the insertion/deletion (I/D) trait in the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) which has been suggested to be a strong modulator of severity in McArdle's disease.

The structures were determined and refined to 2.26 Angstroms resolution and demonstrate that the inhibitors bind at the allosteric activator site, where the physiological activator AMP binds. Acyl ureas induce conformational changes in the vicinity of the allosteric site.

Compound 1 was predicted to interact with positively charged arginines at the AMP allosteric site in the docking model. Characterization of the binding pocket by a grid-based surface calculation of the docking model revealed a large unfilled hydrophobic region near the central phenyl ring, suggesting that compounds with larger hydrophobic groups in this region would improve binding.

15617811,"Effect of osmolytes on the interaction of flavin adenine dinucleotide with muscle glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b.The effect of three osmolytes, trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO), betaine and proline, on the interaction of muscle glycogen phosphorylase b with allosteric inhibitor FAD has been examined. In the absence of osmolyte, the interaction is described by a single intrinsic dissociation constant (17.8 microM) for two equivalent and independent binding sites on the dimeric enzyme. However, the addition of osmolytes gives rise to sigmoidal dependencies of fractional enzyme-site saturation upon free inhibitor concentration. The source of this cooperativity has been shown by difference sedimentation velocity to be an osmolyte-mediated isomerization of phosphorylase b to a smaller dimeric state with decreased affinity for FAD. These results thus have substantiated a previous inference that the tendency for osmolyte-enhanced self-association of dimeric glycogen phosphorylase b in the presence of AMP was being countered by the corresponding effect of molecular crowding on an isomerization of dimer to a smaller, nonassociating state.",M2
15576010,"Alteration of rat hepatic glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase activities by Satureja khuzestanica Jamzad essential oil.PURPOSE: Regarding reported antidiabetic effect of Satureja khuzestanica essential oil (SKEO) and important role of liver on body glucose metabolism by glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis, we were interested to examine effect of SKEO treatment on rat hepatic key enzymes of glycogenolysis and gluconeogenesis in vivo. METHODS: Effective antidiabetic dose of SKEO (1000 ppm) was administered to rats through drinking water for 2 weeks. After 18 hours fasting post treatment under general anesthesia, the liver was removed by transverse abdominal incision and perfused with cold 0.9% saline and kept frozen at -70 degrees C until homogenized. The activities of the key enzymes glycogen phosphorylase (GP) and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPKC) were analyzed in the homogenate. Blood sample was taken by cardiac puncture for glucose assay. RESULTS: SKEO treatment did not affect blood glucose concentrations but decreased hepatic PEPCK activity by 26% (P&lt;0.01) of control and increased hepatic GP by 24% (P&lt;0.01) of control. CONCLUSION: Disturbance of hepatic glucose metabolism is proposed as a mechanism of antidiabetic action of SKEO which could be in relation with antioxidant property of this plant.",M2
15390095,"Glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> isozyme pattern in mammalian retinal Müller (glial) cells and in astrocytes of retina and optic nerve.Müller cells, the radially oriented dominant macroglial cells of the retina, are known to contain abundant glycogen as well as the key enzyme for its degradation, glycogen phosphorylase (GP), but the expressed isozyme pattern is unknown. To elucidate the isoform expression pattern, specific antisera directed against the brain (BB) and muscle (MM) isoforms of GP were applied to retinal sections, isolated Müller cells, and sections of the optic nerve. We show that Müller cells of rat, rabbit, guinea pig, and mouse retina exclusively express the BB isoform. Astrocytes of rat and rabbit optic nerve, as well as retina express only the BB isoform. In contrast, astrocytes in the brain and spinal cord as well as the epithelial cells of the pars caeca and of the ciliary body express both the BB and MM isoform. This result may indicate some differences in the role of glycogen in retinal macroglia and brain astrocytes, reflecting a local specialization of macroglia in the retina proper.",M2

15153119,"Binding of the potential antitumour agent indirubin-5-sulphonate at the inhibitor site of rabbit muscle glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b. Comparison with ligand binding to pCDK2-cyclin A complex.The binding of indirubin-5-sulphonate (E226), a potential anti-tumour agent and a potent inhibitor (IC(50) = 35 nm) of cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) has been studied by kinetic and crystallographic methods. Kinetic analysis revealed that E226 is a moderate inhibitor of GPb (K(i) = 13.8 +/- 0.2 micro m) and GPa (K(i) = 57.8 +/- 7.1 micro m) and acts synergistically with glucose. To explore the molecular basis of E226 binding we have determined the crystal structure of the GPb/E226 complex at 2.3 A resolution. Structure analysis shows clearly that E226 binds at the purine inhibitor site, where caffeine and flavopiridol also bind [Oikonomakos, N.G., Schnier, J.B., Zographos, S.E., Skamnaki, V.T., Tsitsanou, K.E. &amp; Johnson, L.N. (2000) J. Biol. Chem.275, 34566-34573], by intercalating between the two aromatic rings of Phe285 and Tyr613. The mode of binding of E226 to GPb is similar, but not identical, to that of caffeine and flavopiridol. Comparative structural analyses of the GPb-E226, GPb-caffeine and GPb-flavopiridol complex structures reveal the structural basis of the differences in the potencies of the three inhibitors and indicate binding residues in the inhibitor site that can be exploited to obtain more potent inhibitors. Structural comparison of the GPb-E226 complex structure with the active pCDK2-cyclin A-E226 complex structure clearly shows the different binding modes of the ligand to GPb and CDK2; the more extensive interactions of E226 with the active site of CDK2 may explain its higher affinity towards the latter enzyme.",M2
15085341,"Insulin-independent glycogen supercompensation in isolated mouse skeletal muscle: role of <e>phosphorylase</e> inactivation.Glycogen supercompensation (increase in muscle glycogen content above basal) is an established phenomenon induced by unknown mechanisms. It consists of both insulin-dependent and -independent components. Here, we investigate insulin-independent glycogen supercompensation in isolated, intact extensor digitorum longus muscles from mice. Muscles were stimulated electrically, incubated in vitro with 5.5 mM glucose for up to 16 h and then analysed for glycogen, glucose uptake and enzyme activities. Basal glycogen was 84+/-6 micro mol glucosyl units/g dry muscle and was depleted by 80% after 10 min contraction. Glycogen increased after contraction, reaching a peak value of 113+/-9 micro mol glucosyl units/g dry muscle ( P&lt;0.05 vs. basal) by 6 h, and returned to basal values by 16 h (84+/-8). Maximal activities of glycogen synthase, phosphorylase and alpha-glucosidase were not significantly altered by contraction or during the 6-h recovery period. Glycogen synthase fractional activity (0.17/7.2 mM glucose-6-P; inversely related to phosphorylation state of the enzyme) was increased about twofold early after contraction but then decreased and was slightly lower than baseline during the period of supercompensation (4-6 h). Phosphorylase fractional activity (+/-adenosine monophosphate; directly related to phosphorylation state of the enzyme) decreased to 60% of basal after contraction and decreased further during the initial 4 h of recovery to 40% of basal ( P&lt;0.01 vs. basal). After 4 h recovery, glucose uptake was slightly (50%) higher in the stimulated than in the non-stimulated muscle ( P&lt;0.01). Thus, insulin-independent glycogen supercompensation involves inactivation of phosphorylase and hence an inhibition of glycogen breakdown.",M2
14662163,"cDNA microarray analysis of gene expression profiles in human placenta: up-regulation of the transcript encoding muscle subunit of glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> in preeclampsia.OBJECTIVE: Third-trimester human placentas from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies were evaluated for possible changes in gene expression patterns by microarray analysis. METHODS: Placentas from four normal pregnancies and four pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia were studied. In a preliminary effort to identify possible differences between the two groups, complementary DNA (cDNA) probes were prepared from pooled total RNA by reverse transcription in the presence of (33)P-dCTP. After hybridization to human GeneFilter cDNA microarrays (GF211; Research Genetics, Huntsville, AL), 319 positive signals were detected above background out of a possible 4131 human cDNAs spotted on the filters. RESULTS: Ten most highly expressed mRNA species, ten most up-regulated, and ten most down-regulated genes in placentas from both groups of patients were identified for future studies. Of the 319 positive hybridizations, one transcript was clearly elevated in preeclamptic pregnancy. This cDNA encodes the muscle subtype of glycogen phosphorylase (GP-M) and was increased more than 2.8-fold (P &lt;.05) in the preeclamptic placentas. In contrast, cDNA for glycogen synthase (muscle and liver isoforms) was not significantly increased, being near the limits of detection. The preeclampsia-induced increase of placental GP-M mRNA expression (approximately 3.5-fold) was confirmed by northern blot analysis. CONCLUSION: We conclude that microarray analysis can detect trends in mRNA and gene expression in placentas from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies that may be further studied in a more targeted fashion. We found that placental GP-M mRNA level is up-regulated in preeclampsia, which is consistent with previous reports of increased glycogen phosphorylase activity, and we suggest that it may be largely regulated at the level of transcription. Further studies may determine whether such up-regulation might be a response to hypoxia.",M2
14634820,"Muscle- and fibre type-specific expression of glucose transporter 4, glycogen synthase and glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> proteins in human skeletal muscle.The muscle- and fibre type-specific expression of skeletal muscle glucose transporter 4 (GLUT4), glycogen synthase (GS) and glycogen phosphorylase (GP) was investigated in six young male subjects. Single muscle fibres were dissected from vastus lateralis (VL), soleus (SO) and triceps brachii (TB) muscle biopsy samples. On the basis of myosin heavy chain (MHC) expression, fibres were pooled into three groups (MHC I, MHC IIA and MHC IIX) and the GLUT4, GS and GP content of 15-40 pooled fibres determined using SDS-PAGE and immunological detection. In VL, the GLUT4 content in the pooled muscle fibres expressing MHC I was approximately 33% higher ( P&lt;0.05) than in fibres expressing MHC IIA or IIX. There was no difference in GLUT4 content between fibres expressing MHC IIA or IIX, nor were there any differences in GS and GP content between any of the fibre types. In SO, there was no difference in GLUT4, GS and GP between fibres expressing MHC I or IIA. No fibres expressing type IIX were detected. In TB, fibres expressing MHC IIA and IIX had significantly ( P&lt;0.05) more GP (66% and 55 % in MHC IIA and MHCIIX, respectively) than those expressing MHC I, whilst there was no difference in GP between MHC IIA and MHC IIX fibres. The GLUT4 and the GS content was similar in fibres expressing MHC I, IIA and IIX in the TB. Our data directly demonstrate that some proteins, like GLUT4 and GP, are expressed in a fibre type-specific manner in some, but not all, muscles, whilst other proteins, like GS, are not. In human skeletal muscle the GLUT4, GS and GP content thus seems to be related primarily to factors other than the fibre type as defined by the expression of contractile protein. These findings imply that it is not possible to generalize fibre type-dependent protein expression on the basis of biopsies from only one muscle.",M2
14568816,"Muscle glycogenosis and mitochondrial hepatopathy in an infant with mutations in both the myophosphorylase and deoxyguanosine kinase genes.OBJECTIVES: To document 2 apparently incongruous clinical disorders occurring in the same infant: congenital myopathy with myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle disease) and mitochondrial hepatopathy with liver failure and mitochondrial DNA depletion. METHODS: An infant girl born to consanguineous Moroccan parents had severe congenital hypotonia and hepatomegaly, developed liver failure, and died at 5 months of age. We studied muscle and liver biopsy specimens histochemically and biochemically, and we sequenced the whole coding regions of the deoxyguanosine kinase (dGK) and myophosphorylase (PYGM) genes. RESULTS: Muscle biopsy specimens showed subsarcolemmal glycogen accumulation and negative histochemical reaction for <e>phosphorylase</e>. Liver biopsy specimens showed micronodular cirrhosis and massive mitochondrial proliferation. Biochemical analysis showed phosphorylase deficiency in muscle and cytochrome c oxidase deficiency in liver. We identified a novel homozygous missense G-to-A mutation at codon 456 in exon 11 of PYGM, as well as a homozygous 4-base pair GATT duplication (nucleotides 763-766) in exon 6 of dGK, which produces a frame shift and a premature TGA stop codon at nucleotides 766 to 768, resulting in a truncated 255-amino acid protein. Both mutations were absent in 100 healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Our data further expand the genetic heterogeneity in patients with McArdle disease; confirm the strong relationship between mitochondrial DNA depletion syndrome, liver involvement, and dGK mutations; and suggest that genetic  double trouble  should be considered in patients with unusual severe phenotypes.",M2
12930991,"The binding of beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins to glycogen <e>phosphorylase</e> b: kinetic and crystallographic studies.A number of regulatory binding sites of glycogen phosphorylase (GP), such as the catalytic, the inhibitor, and the new allosteric sites are currently under investigation as targets for inhibition of hepatic glycogenolysis under high glucose concentrations; in some cases specific inhibitors are under evaluation in human clinical trials for therapeutic intervention in type 2 diabetes. In an attempt to investigate whether the storage site can be exploited as target for modulating hepatic glucose production, alpha-, beta-, and gamma-cyclodextrins were identified as moderate mixed-type competitive inhibitors of GPb (with respect to glycogen) with K(i) values of 47.1, 14.1, and 7.4 mM, respectively. To elucidate the structural basis of inhibition, we determined the structure of GPb complexed with beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins at 1.94 A and 2.3 A resolution, respectively. The structures of the two complexes reveal that the inhibitors can be accommodated in the glycogen storage site of T-state GPb with very little change of the tertiary structure and provide a basis for understanding their potency and subsite specificity. Structural comparisons of the two complexes with GPb in complex with either maltopentaose (G5) or maltoheptaose (G7) show that beta- and gamma-cyclodextrins bind in a mode analogous to the G5 and G7 binding with only some differences imposed by their cyclic conformations. It appears that the binding energy for stabilization of enzyme complexes derives from hydrogen bonding and van der Waals contacts to protein residues. The binding of alpha-cyclodextrin and octakis (2,3,6-tri-O-methyl)-gamma-cyclodextrin was also investigated, but none of them was bound in the crystal; moreover, the latter did not inhibit the phosphorylase reaction.",M2

CP320626 is also a potent inhibitor of human muscle GPa. In order to elucidate the structural basis of the mechanism of CP320626 inhibition, the structures of T state rabbit muscle GPa (MGPa) in complex with glucose and in complex with both glucose and CP320626 were determined at 2.0 A resolution, and refined to crystallographic R values of 0.179 (R(free)=0.218) and 0.207 (R(free)=0.235), respectively. CP320626 binds at the new allosteric site, some 33 A from the catalytic site, where glucose binds. The binding of CP320626 to MGPa does not promote extensive conformational changes except for small shifts of the side chain atoms of residues R60, V64, and K191. Both CP320626 and glucose promote the less active T state, while structural comparisons of MGPa-glucose-CP320626 complex with LGPa complexed with a related compound (CP403700) and a glucose analogue inhibitor indicate that the residues of the new allosteric site, conserved in the two isozymes, show no significant differences in their positions.",M2

Immunocytochemical double-labelling experiments on frozen sections of rat nervous tissues were performed to investigate the isozyme localization pattern. Astrocytes throughout the brain and spinal cord expressed both isozymes in perfect co-localization. Ependymal cells only expressed the BB isozyme. Most neurones were not immunoreactive. The rare neurones that contained glycogen phosphorylase only expressed the BB isozyme. Nearly all of these neurones formed part of the afferent somatosensory system. These findings stress the general importance of glycogen in neural energy metabolism and indicate a special role for the glycogen phosphorylase BB isozyme in neurones in the somatosensory system.",M2
