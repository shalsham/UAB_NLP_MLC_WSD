20213576,"Methodological evaluation of 2-DE to study root proteomics during nematode infection in cotton and <e>coffee</e> plants.The identification of plant proteins expressed in response to phytopathogens is a remaining challenge to proteome methodology. Proteomic methods, such as electrophoresis and mass spectrometry have been extensively used for protein differential expression studies in several plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and wheat. However, in coffee (Coffea canephora) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), bidimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis has been rarely employed. Moreover, global protein expression in both agricultural plants in response to biotic stress conditions had not been reported until now. In this study, Meloidogyne paranaensis and M. incognita, two devastating phytonematodes for numerous crop cultures, were used to infect resistant genotypes of coffee and cotton plants. The protein expression of infected- and non-infected roots were evaluated by 2-DE following in silico experiments. Additionally, gels were stained with silver nitrate and/or Coomassie brilliant blue in order to obtain an optimized method for proteomic analysis of plant-nematode interaction. The 2-DE analysis revealed an enhanced number of protein spots, as well as differentially expressed proteins, when Coomassie brilliant blue was used. The results obtained here could be extended to other plant species, providing valuable information to root-nematode interactions.",M1
20208063,"Stress metabolism in green <e>coffee</e> beans (Coffea arabica L.): expression of dehydrins and accumulation of GABA during drying.In order to produce tradeable standard green coffee, processed beans must be dried. The drying procedure affects the abundance of relevant aroma substances, e.g. carbohydrates. Using molecular tools, the corresponding metabolic basis is analyzed. A decrease in water potential of the still living coffee seeds induces massive drought stress responses. As a marker for these stress reactions, accumulation of a general stress metabolite, GABA (gamma-aminobutyric acid), and associated gene expression of drought stress-associated dehydrins were monitored. The results of this study indicate that metabolism in drying coffee beans is quite complex since several events trigger accumulation of GABA. The first peak of GABA accumulation during drying is correlated with expression of isocitrate lyase and thus with ongoing germination processes in coffee seeds. Two subsequent peaks of GABA accumulation correspond to maxima of dehydrin gene expression and are thought to be induced directly by drought stress in the embryo and endosperm tissue, respectively. Apart from the significance for understanding basic seed physiology, metabolic changes in coffee seeds during processing provide valuable information for understanding the role and effect of the steps of green coffee processing on the quality of the resulting coffee.",M1
20175515,"Transcriptional profile of genes involved in the biosynthesis of phytate and ferritin in Coffea.The present work aimed to study the control of the biosynthesis of the antinutritional factor phytate and its associated Fe-rich protein family, ferritin, in <e>coffee</e>. Phytate has the ability to chelate Fe, making it unavailable to human absorption. The Coffea genome databases were queried for genes associated with phytate metabolism and ferritin genes. The genetic framework for phytate biosynthesis and its reverse pathway was identified in silico analyses and indicate that Coffea phosphatidyl inositol kinase and monophosphatase families play nonredundant roles in phytate metabolism. The transcriptional profiles of phytate biosynthesis key-genes MYO-INOSITOL(3)P1 SYNTHASE, two genes coding for PHOSPHATIDYL INOSITOL KINASE, and three FERRITIN genes were temporally evaluated by qPCR in coffee seeds from two crop locations, Adamantina-SP and Ouro-Fino-MG, the last one traditionally associated with high-quality coffee beverage grain. A targeted metabolome profile of phytic acid contents throughout three fruit maturation stages in association with the transcriptional analysis was also obtained. Taken together, our data indicate that the investigated local conditions did not cause significant alterations in phytate biosynthesis. Futhermore, the temporal transcriptional profiling revealed that candidate gene expression is regulated independently of phytate accumulation. In contrast, the expression profile of ferritin-unit genes is affected by environmental conditions and genetic background. The roles of the investigated genes are discussed concerning the quality of coffee beverage.",M1
20098931,"[Diversity of Hemiptera Auchenorrhyncha in citrus, <e>coffee</e> and a fragment of native forest of the state of SÃ£o Paulo]The population of Hemiptera Auchenorrhyncha was studied in sweet citrus groves (Citrus sinensis), coffee plantations (Coffea arabica) and a semi-deciduous seasonal forest with shrub physiognomy in Bebedouro, SP, to evaluate the influence of the natural ecosystem on the species composition of the agroecosystems. Monitoring was carried out by using yellow stick cards, which were replaced every 15 days and all Auchenorrhyncha collected were counted and identified. Seven families, 11 subfamilies and 98 species were collected, with Cicadellidae being the most abundant. The native forest presented larger wealth, diversity and equitability of Auchenorrhyncha species, demonstrating to be more stable than the other habitats. The high values of similarities obtained between the agroecosystems and the forest demonstrated that great part of Auchenorrhyncha species occurring in the agricultural habitats was also occurring at the forest, indicating that the last may serve as reservoir of species. The abundance of the taxonomic groups of Auchenorrhyncha collected varied with the evaluated habitats, with Proconiini being the most abundant in the coffee plantation next to the forest, Athysanini, Scaphytopiini, Neocoelidiinae and Coelidiinae in the orange orchard and coffee plantation distant from the forest; Cicadellinae and Agalliinae were not related to any of the habitats. The presence of vector insects and possible vectors of plant diseases in the appraised habitats indicate the need of the implementation of strategies for landscape management.",M1
20036052,"Removal of Malachite Green from aqueous solution using degreased <e>coffee</e> bean.This study reports on the feasibility of employing degreased coffee beans (DCB) as adsorbent for Malachite Green (MG) removal in dyeing wastewater. The iodine value (IV), specific surface area (SSA) and porosity of the raw coffee beans (RCB) used in the study increased after the degreasing process, resulting in significant increase in the adsorption of MG onto DCB. Employing a batch experimental set-up, optimum conditions for complete color removal and adsorption of MG by DCB was studied considering parameters such as effect of degreasing process, adsorbent dosage, initial dye concentration, reaction temperature and pH. Adsorbed amount of MG by DCB increased with increasing DCB dosage and initial MG concentration. The rate of the adsorption reaction followed the pseudo second-order kinetics with the sorption isotherm well fitted to the Freundlich and the Langmuir isotherm models. Thermodynamic studies revealed that the adsorption processes is spontaneous and endothermic in nature. DCB has potentials for application as adsorbent for the removal of MG from dyeing process wastewater.",M1
19949670,"Removal of alpha-Gal epitopes from porcine aortic valve and pericardium using recombinant human alpha galactosidase A.It has been reported that the immune response due to alpha-Gal epitopes is an important factor in tissue valve failure. The elimination of the interaction between the natural anti-Gal antibodies and alpha-gal epitopes on the xenografts is a prerequisite to the success of xenografts in humans. Previously, we reported that the green <e>coffee</e> bean alpha-galactosidase could remove all alpha-Gal epitopes from cell surface of porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue, but it has limitations on cost effectiveness. In this study we wanted to know whether the recently produced recombinant human alpha-galactosidase A has the same effective enzymatic activity as green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase in removing alpha-Gal epitopes from the same tissues. After treating fresh porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue with recombinant alpha-galactosidase A, each sample was stained with Griffonia simplicifolia type I isolectin B4 indirect immunoperoxidase avidin-biotin technique. We then examined whether the alpha-Gal epitopes were reduced or abolished in each consecutive concentration of recombinant alpha-galactosidase A by comparing the degree of the Griffonia simplicifolia isolectin B4 staining. As a result, the recombinant alpha-galactosidase A could remove cell surface alpha-Gals on porcine aortic valve and pericardial tissue as effectively as green coffee bean alpha-galactosidase.",M1
19939498,"Biochemical and molecular characterization of the antioxidative system of Coffea sp. under cold conditions in genotypes with contrasting tolerance.Low positive temperature (chilling) is frequently linked to the promotion of oxidative stress conditions, and is of particular importance in the <e>coffee</e> plant due to its severe impact on growth, development, photosynthesis and production. Nevertheless, some acclimation ability has been reported within the Coffea genus, and is possibly related to oxidative stress control. Using an integrated biochemical and molecular approach, the characterization of the antioxidative system of genotypes with different cold acclimation abilities was performed. Experiments were carried out using 1.5-year-old coffee seedlings of Coffea canephora cv. ApoatÃ£, C. arabica cv. CatuaÃ­, C. dewevrei and 2 hybrids, Icatu (C. arabicaxC. canephora) and PiatÃ£ (C. dewevreixC. arabica) subjected to a gradual cold treatment and a recovery period. Icatu showed the greatest ability to control oxidative stress, as reflected by the enhancement of several antioxidative components (Cu,Zn-SOD and APX activities; ascorbate, alpha-tocopherol and chlorogenic acids (CGAs) contents) and lower reactive oxygen species contents (H(2)O(2) and OH). Gene expression studies show that GRed, DHAR and class III and IV chitinases might also be involved in the cold acclimation ability of Icatu. CatuaÃ­ showed intermediate acclimation ability through the reinforcement of some antioxidative molecules, usually to a lesser extent than that observed in Icatu. On the other hand, C. dewevrei showed the poorest response in terms of antioxidant accumulation, and also showed the greatest increase in OH values. The difference in the triggering of antioxidative traits supports the hypothesis of its importance to cold (and photoinhibition) tolerance in Coffea sp. and could provide a useful probe to identify tolerant genotypes.",M1

19933976,"Medical records documentation of constipation preceding Parkinson disease: A case-control study.OBJECTIVE: Parkinson disease (PD) may affect the autonomic nervous system and may cause constipation; however, few studies have explored constipation preceding the motor onset of PD. We investigated constipation preceding PD using a case-control study design in a population-based sample. METHODS: Using the medical records-linkage system of the Rochester Epidemiology Project, we identified 196 subjects who developed PD in Olmsted County, MN, from 1976 through 1995. Each incident case was matched by age (+/-1 year) and sex to a general population control. We reviewed the complete medical records of cases and controls in the medical records-linkage system to ascertain the occurrence of constipation preceding the onset of PD (or index year). RESULTS: Constipation preceding PD or the index year was more common in cases than in controls (odds ratio [OR] 2.48; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.49 to 4.11; p = 0.0005). This association remained significant after adjusting for smoking and <e>coffee</e> consumption (ever vs never), and after excluding constipation possibly induced by drugs. In addition, the association remained significant in analyses restricted to constipation documented 20 or more years before the onset of motor symptoms of PD. Although the association was stronger in women than in men and in patients with PD with rest tremor compared with patients with PD without rest tremor, these differences were not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that constipation occurring as early as 20 or more years before the onset of motor symptoms is associated with an increased risk of Parkinson disease.",M1
19928990,"Evaluation of kahweol and cafestol in <e>coffee</e> tissues and roasted coffee by a new high-performance liquid chromatography methodology.A reverse phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method was developed for the simultaneous quantification of kahweol and cafestol in tissues of fresh fruits, leaves, and roasted coffee beans. The best resolution was obtained with isocratic elution of acetonitrile/water (55/45% v/v) and UV detection. A single sample preparation method carried out by direct saponification and extraction with organic solvent was standardized for all matrices. Good recovery (average of 99% for kahweol and 94% for cafestol), repeatability, and linearity were obtained. Detection limits of 2.3 and 3.0 mg/100 g were observed for kahweol and cafestol. The HPLC method was effective in quantifying these diterpenes in the different coffee matrices. The endosperm and perisperm of Coffea arabica cv. IAPAR 59 showed elevated amounts of kahweol as compared to the pericarp and leaves. On the other hand, cafestol was detected in all samples except in leaves from Coffea canephora cv. ApoatÄ?.",M1
19908899,"Genotypic and environmental effects on <e>coffee</e> (Coffea arabica L.) bean fatty acid profile: impact on variety and origin chemometric determination.In a previous study, the effectiveness of chlorogenic acids, fatty acids (FA), and elements was compared for the discrimination of Arabica varieties and growing terroirs. Since FA provided the best results, the aim of the present work was to validate their discrimination ability using an extended experimental design, including twice the number of location x variety combinations and 2 years of study. It also aimed at understanding how the environment influences FA composition through correlation analysis using different climatic parameters. Percentages of correct classification of known samples remained very high, independent of the classification criterion. However, cross-validation tests across years indicated that prediction of unknown locations was less efficient than that of unknown genotypes. Environmental temperature during the development of coffee beans had a dramatic influence on their FA composition. Analysis of climate patterns over years enabled us to understand the efficient location discrimination within a single year but only moderate efficiency across years.",M1
19807164,"Kinetic analysis and mechanism on the inhibition of chlorogenic acid and its components against porcine pancreas alpha-amylase isozymes I and II.Chlorogenic acid (5-caffeoylquinic acid, 5-CQA) is a kind of polyphenol and is richly included in green <e>coffee</e> beans. The inhibitory effects of 5-CQA and its components, caffeic acid (CA) and quinic acid (QA), on the two porcine pancreas alpha-amylase (PPA) isozymes, PPA-I and PPA-II, were investigated using p-nitrophenyl-alpha-D-maltoside as substrate at pH 6.9 and 30 degrees C. The inhibition potencies of the respective inhibitors against both PPA isozymes were almost the same and in the order of 5-CQA &gt; CA &gt;&gt; QA. Their IC(50) values were 0.07-0.08 mM, 0.37-0.40 mM, and 25.3-26.5 mM, respectively. The inhibition mechanisms of 5-CQA and CA were investigated by kinetic analyses, and the inhibitor constants K(i) and K(i)' (for the free enzyme and enzyme-substrate complex, respectively) were determined. It was indicated that 5-CQA and CA showed mixed-type inhibition with K(i) &gt; K(i)' against both PPA-I and PPA-II. The binding of PPA-I or PPA-II with 5-CQA or CA was all exothermic and enthalpy-driven. QA is a poor inhibitor, and its inhibitory mode was unique and hardly analyzed by a simple Michaelis-Menten-type interaction between the enzyme and inhibitor. However, it was shown that the inhibitory activity of CA was enhanced 5 times by ester-bond formation with QA in the form of 5-CQA. These results provide us with significant hints for the development of alpha-amylase inhibitors useful for the prevention of diabetes and obesity.",M1
19788737,"MoccaDB - an integrative database for functional, comparative and diversity studies in the Rubiaceae family.BACKGROUND: In the past few years, functional genomics information has been rapidly accumulating on Rubiaceae species and especially on those belonging to the Coffea genus (<e>coffee</e> trees). An increasing number of expressed sequence tag (EST) data and EST- or genomic-derived microsatellite markers have been generated, together with Conserved Ortholog Set (COS) markers. This considerably facilitates comparative genomics or map-based genetic studies through the common use of orthologous loci across different species. Similar genomic information is available for e.g. tomato or potato, members of the Solanaceae family. Since both Rubiaceae and Solanaceae belong to the Euasterids I (lamiids) integration of information on genetic markers would be possible and lead to more efficient analyses and discovery of key loci involved in important traits such as fruit development, quality, and maturation, or adaptation. Our goal was to develop a comprehensive web data source for integrated information on validated orthologous markers in Rubiaceae. DESCRIPTION: MoccaDB is an online MySQL-PHP driven relational database that houses annotated and/or mapped microsatellite markers in Rubiaceae. In its current release, the database stores 638 markers that have been defined on 259 ESTs and 379 genomic sequences. Marker information was retrieved from 11 published works, and completed with original data on 132 microsatellite markers validated in our laboratory. DNA sequences were derived from three Coffea species/hybrids. Microsatellite markers were checked for similarity, in vitro tested for cross-amplification and diversity/polymorphism status in up to 38 Rubiaceae species belonging to the Cinchonoideae and Rubioideae subfamilies. Functional annotation was provided and some markers associated with described metabolic pathways were also integrated. Users can search the database for marker, sequence, map or diversity information through multi-option query forms. The retrieved data can be browsed and downloaded, along with protocols used, using a standard web browser. MoccaDB also integrates bioinformatics tools (CMap viewer and local BLAST) and hyperlinks to related external data sources (NCBI GenBank and PubMed, SOL Genomic Network database). CONCLUSION: We believe that MoccaDB will be extremely useful for all researchers working in the areas of comparative and functional genomics and molecular evolution, in general, and population analysis and association mapping of Rubiaceae and Solanaceae species, in particular.",M1
19775900,"Proteomic evaluation of <e>coffee</e> zygotic embryos in two different stages of seed development.Coffee seed development is accompanied by severe modifications in water soluble proteins, several of these being associated to a specific developmental stage. For this reason, a proteomic approach has been used to describe spatial-temporal proteome modifications in zygotic embryos at different stages of seed development. Embryos from Coffea arabica seeds were harvested in two different developmental stages: stage 1 at 210 days after anthesis and stage 2 at 255 days. Total proteins were extracted and submitted to 2-DE. From these gels, several spots were identified by mass spectrometry including kinases, MYB transcription factor and enzymes involved in metabolic pathways. All proteins identified seem to affect coffee development in different ways, being directly involved in plant growth or used as an intermediate in some metabolic pathway that, indirectly, will influence coffee development. This is the first work using two-dimensional electrophoresis followed by mass spectrometry analyses that evaluates the expression of proteins during coffee zygotic embryos development. Data here reported supply some light over coffee development and could be used in a near future to improve coffee plants' growth and development by molecular strategies.",M1
19747735,"The location of aluminium in protoplasts and suspension cells taken from Coffea arabica L. with different tolerance of Al.Biotechnological advances in <e>coffee</e> research (in vitro manipulation, multiplication, generation and development of transgenic coffee plants with specific traits like high yield and good quality) have contributed to description of the metabolic pathways involved in the response mechanisms to environmental factors like abiotic stress. Coffea arabica L. plants grow in acidic soils, and therefore aluminium (Al) toxicity is a major negative impact on crop productivity. To understand Al toxicity mechanisms in cells via the Al absorption kinetic, we isolated protoplasts from two C. arabica L. suspension cell lines: Al-sensitive (L2) and Al-tolerant (LAMt). Protoplasts of LAMt line exhibited lower Al absorption levels than protoplasts of the L2 line. Use of two fluorescent tracers (morin and calcofluor white) indicated that Al interacts with internal cell structures, such as the plasma membrane and nucleus, with differences in both cell lines. Al-tolerance in the LAMt is probably associated with the cell wall as well as intracellular structures. These data will help to better understand Al toxicity in C. arabica, and Al toxicity mechanisms in plant cells.",M1
19714284,"Semiochemicals used in host location by the <e>coffee</e> berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei.The coffee berry borer, Hypothenemus hampei is a serious pest in many coffee growing countries. Electrophysiological and behavioral responses of H. hampei to volatiles of different phenological stages of coffee, Coffea arabica, fruits were studied in order to identify volatile semiochemicals used in host location. Volatiles were collected from different phenological stages of C. arabica fruit by air entrainment. Electrophysiological recordings were made from insect antennae. Behavioral assays were carried out using a Perspex four-arm olfactometer. Insects spent significantly more time in the region of the olfactometer where ripe and dry fruit volatiles were present compared to control regions. Coupled gas chromatography--electroantennography revealed the presence of six electrophysiologically active compounds in C. arabica volatiles. These were identified by using GC and GC-MS as methylcyclohexane, ethylbenzene, nonane, 1-octen-3-ol, (R)-limonene, and (R)-3-ethyl-4-methylpentanol. In the olfactometer bioassay, H. hampei showed a significant response to 3-ethyl-4-methylpentanol, methylcyclohexane, nonane, ethylbenzene, and a synthetic blend of these four compounds. Attraction to the synthetic blend was comparable to that for the natural sample. The significance of the study is discussed in terms of semiochemical based pest management methods of the coffee berry borer.",M1
19710155,"Trigonelline is a novel phytoestrogen in <e>coffee</e> beans.Drinking coffee has been associated with the development of several endocrine-related cancers. The interpretation of these data has often been limited to the role that caffeine plays. Trigonelline (Trig), a niacin-related compound, is a natural constituent of coffee accounting for approximately 1% dry matter in roasted beans. Studies exploring the effects of this bioactive compound on mammalian cells are limited. The initial purpose of our studies was to determine whether Trig alters the actions of estradiol (E(2)), using proliferation of estrogen-dependent human breast cancer (MCF-7) cells as a model system. When cells were cotreated with suboptimal doses of E(2) (10 pmol/L) and Trig (100 pmol/L), an additive enhancement of MCF-7 growth was observed. In the absence of E(2), Trig stimulated MCF-7 cell proliferation in a dose-responsive manner and significantly enhanced cell growth at concentrations as low as 100 pmol/L. Cotreatment of MCF-7 cells with Trig and ICI 182,780, an estrogen receptor (ER) antagonist, inhibited Trig-induced cell proliferation. Trig treatment also induced activation of estrogen response element reporter assays in MCF-7 cells and increased expression of ER target genes (pS2, progesterone receptor, and cyclin D1) similar to E(2). While our data demonstrate that Trig activates the ER, competitive binding assays showed that Trig does not compete E(2) off of the ER at any concentration. This suggests that Trig is activating the ER through a separate mechanism. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Trig even at low concentrations stimulates MCF-7 cell growth and that this effect is mediated through ER, clearly identifying Trig as a novel phytoestrogen.",M1
19680876,"Fumonisin B2 production by Aspergillus niger in Thai <e>coffee</e> beans.During 2006 and 2007, a total of 64 Thai dried coffee bean samples (Coffea arabica) from two growing sites in Chiangmai Province and 32 Thai dried coffee bean samples (Coffea canephora) from two growing sites in Chumporn Province, Thailand, were collected and assessed for fumonisin contamination by black Aspergilli. No Fusarium species known to produce fumonisin were detected, but black Aspergilli had high incidences on both Arabica and Robusta Thai coffee beans. Liquid chromatography (LC) with high-resolution mass spectrometric (HRMS) detection showed that 67% of Aspergillus niger isolates from coffee beans were capable of producing fumonisins B(2) (FB(2)) and B(4) when grown on Czapek Yeast Agar with 5% NaCl. Small amounts (1-9.7 ng g(-1)) of FB(2) were detected in seven of 12 selected coffee samples after ion-exchange purification and LC-MS/MS detection. Two samples also contained FB(4). This is the first record of freshly isolated A. niger strains producing fumonisins and the first report on the natural occurrence of FB(2) and FB(4) in coffee.",M1
19618060,"[Effects of irrigation, environmental variability and predatory wasp on Leucoptera coffeella (GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), in <e>coffee</e> plants]The population density of the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella (GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville) can be affected by environmental variables in irrigated agroecosystems and the occurrence of predatory wasps such as Vespidae. In here, we aimed to evaluate the effects of environmental variables, drip irrigation depths and predation by wasps on the population density of L. coffeella. The experiment was carried out during 2004 and 2005 in a Coffea arabica plantation cultivated in the county of Jaboticatubas, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The different irrigation depths set through drip were established considering the daily depth required by the IRRIPLUS program, which was equal to 100%, and two other lower (51% and 72%) and higher (124% and 145%) values, having the control without irrigation. In order to evaluate the coffee leaf miner population density and predation, the number of active and preyed mines was determined on the fourth pair of leaves in a group of ten plants. For the study of interactions among the environmental variables, irrigation depths with the mine density of L. coffeella and predatory wasps, the following methods were used: multivariated analysis, simple linear regression and trail. We concluded that higher pluvial precipitation, solar radiation and irrigation depths would reduce population density of the coffee leaf miner. Furthermore, the increase in density of the predatory wasps was dependent on the population level of L. coffeella.",M1
19579294,"Role of roasting conditions in the profile of volatile flavor chemicals formed from <e>coffee</e> beans.The volatile chemicals in dichloromethane extracts from green coffee beans, roasted at 230 degrees C for 12 min (light), at 240 degrees C for 14 min (medium), at 250 degrees C for 17 min (city), or at 250 degrees C for 21 min (French), were analyzed by gas chromatography and gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Among the 52 volatile compounds identified, the major compounds were 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, furfuryl alcohol, and 6-methyl-3,5-dihydroxy-4H-pyran-4-one in light-roasted beans; furfuryl alcohol, 5-hydroxymethylfurfural, and gamma-butyrolactone in medium-roasted beans; furfuryl alcohol, gamma-butyrolactone, and 2-acetylpyrrole in city-raosted beans; and gamma-butyrolactone, furfuryl alcohol, and catechol in French-roasted beans. Furfural derivatives and furanones were yielded in relatively high concentrations under mild roasting conditions and then reduced at higher roasting intensities. More pyridines and pyrroles were formed by high roasting intensities than by mild roasting intensities. Chlorogenic acid degradation products, phenols, and a lactone were produced more by high roasting intensities than by low roasting intensities. The results of the present study suggest that controlling the roasting conditions according to the formation of particular chemicals can prepare a roasted coffee with preferable flavor.",M1

19397954,"Anti-cariogenic effects of polyphenols from plant stimulant beverages (cocoa, <e>coffee</e>, tea).Polyphenols occurring in cocoa, coffee and tea can have a role in the prevention of cariogenic processes, due to their antibacterial action. Cocoa polyphenol pentamers significantly reduce biofilm formation and acid production by Streptococcus mutans and S. sanguinis. In the same way, trigonelline, caffeine and chlorogenic acid occurring in green and roasted coffee interfere with S. mutans adsorption to saliva-coated hydroxyapatite beads. Studies carried out on green, oolong and black tea indicate that tea polyphenols exert an anti-caries effect via an anti-microbial mode-of-action, and galloyl esters of (-)-epicatechin, (-)-epigallocatechin and (-)-gallocatechin show increasing antibacterial activities. The anti-cariogenic effects against alpha-haemolytic streptococci showed by polyphenols from cocoa, coffee, and tea suggest further studies to a possible application of these beverages in the prevention of pathogenesis of dental caries.",M1
19268380,"ITS-based detection and quantification of Aspergillus ochraceus and Aspergillus westerdijkiae in grapes and green <e>coffee</e> beans by real-time quantitative PCR.Aspergillus ochraceus and A. westerdijkiae are considered the most important Ochratoxin A (OTA) producing species included in Aspergillus section Circumdati which contaminate foodstuffs and beverages for human consumption. In this work a real-time quantitative PCR protocol was developed to detect both species using SYBR Green and primers designed on the basis of the multicopy ITS1 region of the rDNA. The assay had high efficiency (94%) and showed no inhibition by host or fungal DNA other than the target species. The lower detection limit of the target DNA was 2.5 pg/reaction. Accuracy of detection and quantification by qPCR were tested with genomic DNA obtained from green coffee beans and grapes artificially contaminated with spore suspensions of known concentrations. Spore concentrations equal or higher than 10(6) spore/ml could be detected by the assay directly without prior incubation of the samples and a positive relationship was observed between incubation time and qPCR values. The assay developed would allow rapid, specific, accurate and sensitive detection and quantification of A. ochraceus and A. westerdijkiae to be directly used in a critical point of the food chain, before harvesting green coffee and grape berries, to predict and control fungal growth and OTA production.",M1
19250168,"Effect of green Coffea arabica L. seed oil on extracellular matrix components and water-channel expression in in vitro and ex vivo human skin models.BACKGROUND: Green Coffea arabica L. seed oil is being widely used in cosmetic formulations, although its effects on human skin cells are not clear and most observations are unpublished. AIMS: In this study, we evaluated the in vitro effects of green <e>coffee</e> (C. arabica L.) oil (GCO) on the synthesis of collagen, elastin, and glycosaminoglycans (GAG) and in the release of transforming growth factor-beta1 (TGF-beta1) and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) by human skin fibroblasts. We also investigated the ability of GCO to increase aquaglycerolporins-3 (AQP-3) mRNA expression in cultured keratinocytes and human skin explants. METHODS: Human fibroblasts were incubated for 48 h with several GCO concentrations (3.12, 6.25, 12.5, 25.0 and 50.0 mg/mL). The levels of growth factors and extracellular matrix compounds in the culture supernatant were measured using commercial kits. To evaluate AQP-3 relative expression, using real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, keratinocytes were incubated for 3-6 h with the GCO optimal concentration of 25.0 mg/mL. Histological sections of human skin were also incubated with GCO (25.0 mg/mL) and immunostained by antiserum against AQP-3. RESULTS: Our results demonstrated that incubation with GCO produces a dose-dependent stimulation in the synthesis of collagen, elastin, and GAG, in addition to increasing the release of the growth factors TGF-beta1 and GM-CSF. GCO also induced the expression of AQP-3 mRNA, which reached levels up to 6.5-fold higher than those of the control cultures. CONCLUSION: The findings presented herein suggest that GCO might improve physiological balance in the skin, thus allowing the formation of new connective tissue, and preventing epidermis dryness by increasing AQP-3 levels. Taking into account the limitations of in vitro studies, it is encouraging in this context to consider CGO as an adjuvant to be used in dermocosmetic formulations. Clinical studies are in progress in our laboratory aiming to further investigate the protective effects of CGO in the skin.",M1
19233365,"Salting-out gradients in centrifugal partition chromatography for the isolation of chlorogenic acids from green <e>coffee</e> beans.In addition to sample solubility constraints, the use of polarity gradients in normal-phase centrifugal partition chromatography (CPC) for the purification of complex mixtures is also limited by the instability of biphasic systems as a consequence of dramatic changes in the settling times along the gradient, leading in many cases to column bleeding when working under maximum efficiency conditions. In this paper an electrostriction approach is proposed as a strategy in reversed-phase CPC to fractionate intermediate polarity extracts in a single run by bringing its components into the  sweet spot  in a controlled fashion through a stepwise reduction of salt concentration in the aqueous mobile phase. The salting-out gradient method was successfully tested with the separation of the major chlorogenic acids (CGAs, hydroxycinnamoylquinic acids) present in green coffee beans (5-caffeoylquinic acid (5-CQA), 5-feruloylquinic acid (5-FQA) and 3,5-dicaffeoylquinic acid (3,5-diCQA)) using ethyl acetate-hexane as the stationary phase and an ionic gradient of LiCl (5.0, 2.5 and 0.1M) as the mobile phase in one case and (NH(4))(2)SO(4)/KNO(3) (3.0 and 1.5M/1.5M) in another. Regioisomers of each chlorogenic acid obtained by base-catalyzed isomerisation were also separated by CPC using isocratic elution. The best resolution for both FQAs and diCQAs was achieved with a chloroform-n-butanol-0.01M pH 2.5 phosphate buffer (84:16:100; v/v) system, while CQAs were best isolated using chloroform-n-butanol-0.01M pH 2.5 phosphate buffer/5.0M LiCl (82:18:100; v/v).",M1
19207685,"Metabolic pathways in tropical dicotyledonous albuminous seeds: Coffea arabica as a case study.* The genomic era facilitates the understanding of how transcriptional networks are interconnected to program seed development and filling. However, to date, little information is available regarding dicot seeds with a transient perisperm and a persistent, copious endosperm. Coffea arabica is the subject of increasing genomic research and is a model for nonorthodox albuminous dicot seeds of tropical origin. * The aim of this study was to reconstruct the metabolic pathways involved in the biosynthesis of the main <e>coffee</e> seed storage compounds, namely cell wall polysaccharides, triacylglycerols, sucrose, and chlorogenic acids. For this purpose, we integrated transcriptomic and metabolite analyses, combining real-time RT-PCR performed on 137 selected genes (of which 79 were uncharacterized in Coffea) and metabolite profiling. * Our map-drawing approach derived from model plants enabled us to propose a rationale for the peculiar traits of the coffee endosperm, such as its unusual fatty acid composition, remarkable accumulation of chlorogenic acid and cell wall polysaccharides. * Comparison with the developmental features of exalbuminous seeds described in the literature revealed that the two seed types share important regulatory mechanisms for reserve biosynthesis, independent of the origin and ploidy level of the storage tissue.",M1
19185116,"Prediction of sensory properties of Brazilian Arabica roasted <e>coffees</e> by headspace solid phase microextraction-gas chromatography and partial least squares.Volatile compounds in fifty-eight Arabica roasted coffee samples from Brazil were analyzed by SPME-GC-FID and SPME-GC-MS, and the results were compared with those from sensory evaluation. The main purpose was to investigate the relationships between the volatile compounds from roasted coffees and certain sensory attributes, including body, flavor, cleanliness and overall quality. Calibration models for each sensory attribute based on chromatographic profiles were developed by using partial least squares (PLS) regression. Discrimination of samples with different overall qualities was done by using partial least squares-discriminant analysis (PLS-DA). The alignment of chromatograms was performed by the correlation optimized warping (COW) algorithm. Selection of peaks for each regression model was performed by applying the ordered predictors selection (OPS) algorithm in order to take into account only significant compounds. The results provided by the calibration models are promising and demonstrate the feasibility of using this methodology in on-line or routine applications to predict the sensory quality of unknown Brazilian Arabica coffee samples. According to the PLS-DA on chromatographic profiles of different quality samples, compounds 3-methypropanal, 2-methylfuran, furfural, furfuryl formate, 5-methyl-2-furancarboxyaldehyde, 4-ethylguaiacol, 3-methylthiophene, 2-furanmethanol acetate, 2-ethyl-3,6-dimethylpyrazine, 1-(2-furanyl)-2-butanone and three others not identified compounds can be considered as possible markers for the coffee beverage overall quality.",M1
19127547,"Liquid chromatography coupled with ultraviolet absorbance detection, electrospray ionization, collision-induced dissociation and tandem mass spectrometry on a triple quadrupole for the on-line characterization of polyphenols and methylxanthines in green <e>coffee</e> beans.Liquid chromatography coupled with a photodiode array detector, electrospray ionization, collision-induced dissociation and tandem mass spectrometry (LC-DAD/ESI-CID-MS/MS) on a triple quadrupole (QqQ) has been used to detect and characterize polyphenols and methylxanthines in green coffee beans: three phenolic acids (caffeic acid, ferulic acid and dimethoxycinnamic acid), three isomeric caffeoylquinic acids (M(r) 354), three feruloylquinic acids (M(r) 368), one p-coumaroylquinic acid (M(r) 338), three dicaffeoylquinic acids (M(r) 516), three feruloyl-caffeoylquinic acids (M(r) 530), four p-coumaroyl-caffeoylquinic acids (M(r) 500), three diferuloylquinic acids (M(r) 544), six dimethoxycinnamoyl-caffeoylquinic acids (M(r) 544), three dimethoxycinnamoyl-feruloylquinic acids (M(r) 558), six cinnamoyl-amino acid conjugates, three cinnamoyl glycosides, and three methylxanthines (caffeine, theobromine and theophylline). Dimethoxycinnamic acid, three isomers of dimethoxycinnamoyl-caffeoylquinic acids and another three of dimethoxycinnamoyl-feruloylquinic acids, as well as the three cinnamoyl glycosides, had not previously been reported in coffee beans. Structures have been assigned on the basis of the complementary information obtained from UV-visible spectra, relative hydrophobicity, scan mode MS spectra, and fragmentation patterns in MS(2) spectra (both in the positive and negative ion modes) obtained using a QqQ at different collision energies. A structure diagnosis scheme is provided for the identification of different isomers of polyphenols and methylxanthines.",M1
19126214,"Identification of suitable internal control genes for expression studies in Coffea arabica under different experimental conditions.BACKGROUND: Quantitative data from gene expression experiments are often normalized by transcription levels of reference or housekeeping genes. An inherent assumption for their use is that the expression of these genes is highly uniform in living organisms during various phases of development, in different cell types and under diverse environmental conditions. To date, the validation of reference genes in plants has received very little attention and suitable reference genes have not been defined for a great number of crop species including Coffea arabica. The aim of the research reported herein was to compare the relative expression of a set of potential reference genes across different types of tissue/organ samples of <e>coffee</e>. We also validated the expression profiles of the selected reference genes at various stages of development and under a specific biotic stress. RESULTS: The expression levels of five frequently used housekeeping genes (reference genes), namely alcohol dehydrogenase (adh), 14-3-3, polyubiquitin (poly), beta-actin (actin) and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh) was assessed by quantitative real-time RT-PCR over a set of five tissue/organ samples (root, stem, leaf, flower, and fruits) of Coffea arabica plants. In addition to these commonly used internal controls, three other genes encoding a cysteine proteinase (cys), a caffeine synthase (ccs) and the 60S ribosomal protein L7 (rpl7) were also tested. Their stability and suitability as reference genes were validated by geNorm, NormFinder and BestKeeper programs. The obtained results revealed significantly variable expression levels of all reference genes analyzed, with the exception of gapdh, which showed no significant changes in expression among the investigated experimental conditions. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that the expression of housekeeping genes is not completely stable in coffee. Based on our results, gapdh, followed by 14-3-3 and rpl7 were found to be homogeneously expressed and are therefore adequate for normalization purposes, showing equivalent transcript levels in different tissue/organ samples. Gapdh is therefore the recommended reference gene for measuring gene expression in Coffea arabica. Its use will enable more accurate and reliable normalization of tissue/organ-specific gene expression studies in this important cherry crop plant.",M1

The development of efficient techniques for the identification of H. vastatrix isolates is imperative, given the continuous development of new races. The transferability of 25 SSR markers developed in the related Uredinales species Puccinia coronata f. sp lolli and Melampsora linii to H. vastatrix was tested.

19016405,"Long-term caffeine consumption reverses tumor-induced suppression of the innate immune response in adult mice.Caffeine (1,3,7-trimethylxanthine), the active principle alkaloid of <e>coffee</e> ( Coffea arabica) and tea ( Camellia sinensis) possesses a restraining effect on tumor-induced suppression of the specific immune response in adult mice. The present study deals with the effect of long-term consumption of caffeine in the development of Ehrlich ascites carcinoma (EAC) cells in adult Swiss female mice, in relation to the innate immune response and tumor growth. Although the consumption of caffeine alone for more than 12 consecutive days did not affect the innate immune response parameters, continuation of its treatment following intraperitoneal EAC cell inoculation not only reduced the IN VIVO tumor growth but also reduced/restored the EAC cell-induced suppression of the innate immune response. These results suggest that caffeine may inhibit IN VIVO tumor growth through reduction of the cancer cell-induced suppression of the innate immune response.

Predatory mite adult females were exposed to residues of fenbutatin oxide or distilled water on leaf discs during a period of 72 h prior experiments. When exposed to distilled water (control treatments), predatory mites significantly preferred undamaged plants over air, O. ilicis-infested plants over undamaged plants, and they did not prefer B. phoenicis-infested plants over undamaged plants. However, predatory mites that had been exposed to residues of fenbutatin oxide were neither attracted towards undamaged plants nor to O. ilicis-infested plants. Thus, fenbutatin oxide affected negatively the olfactory response of I. zuluagai. We conclude that sub-lethal-effect studies should be considered in pesticide selectivity programs since the ability of predatory mites to locate their prey may be negatively affected by non-lethal concentrations of pesticides.",M1
19007232,"Quantitative investigation of trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide in foods, urine, and plasma by means of LC-MS/MS and stable isotope dilution analysis.A straightforward stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) for the quantitative determination of trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide in foods such as <e>coffee</e>, as well as in biological samples by means of LC-MS/MS (MRM) has been developed. The coefficients of variation for their quantitative analysis in a coffee sample were 2.1% for trigonelline, 1.1% for nicotinic acid, and 3.1% for nicotinamide, and recovery experiments showed good results between 98.5 and 104.5%. Application of this SIDA for the quantification of trigonelline, nicotinic acid, and nicotinamide in coffee samples of different roasting degrees revealed a drastic degradation of trigonelline as well as the generation of nicotinic acid accounting for 4-6% of the initial trigonelline content, whereas nicotinamide remained rather constant at a low level. Besides the analysis of coffee samples, the feasibility of the developed SIDA was verified by analysis of other foods including breakfast cereals, rice, liver, and herring, as well as human urine and plasma samples.",M1
19000007,"Effect of shade on Arabica <e>coffee</e> berry disease development: Toward an agroforestry system to reduce disease impact.Coffee berry disease (CBD), caused by Colletotrichum kahawae, is a major constraint for Arabica coffee cultivation in Africa. The disease is specific to green berries and can lead to 60% harvest losses. In Cameroon, mixed cropping systems of coffee with other crops, such as fruit trees, are very widespread agricultural practices. Fruit trees are commonly planted at random on coffee farms, providing a heterogeneous shading pattern for coffee trees growing underneath. Based on a recent study of CBD, it is known that those plants can reduce disease incidence. To assess the specific effect of shade, in situ and in vitro disease development was compared between coffee trees shaded artificially by a net and trees located in full sunlight. In the field, assessments confirmed a reduction in CBD on trees grown under shade compared with those grown in full sunlight. Artificial inoculations in the laboratory showed that shade did not have any effect on the intrinsic susceptibility of coffee berries to CBD. Coffee shading mainly acts on environmental parameters in limiting disease incidence. In addition to reducing yield losses, agroforestry system may also be helpful in reducing chemical control of the disease and in diversifying coffee growers' incomes.",M1
18974947,"Isolation and molecular characterization of Xylella fastidiosa from <e>coffee</e> plants in Costa Rica.Coffee plants exhibiting a range of symptoms including mild to severe curling of leaf margins, chlorosis and deformation of leaves, stunting of plants, shortening of internodes, and dieback of branches have been reported since 1995 in several regions of Costa Rica's Central Valley. The symptoms are referred to by coffee producers in Costa Rica as  crespera  disease and have been associated with the presence of the bacterium Xylella fastidiosa. Coffee plants determined to be infected by the bacterium by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), were used for both transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and for isolation of the bacterium in PW broth or agar. Petioles examined by TEM contained rod-shaped bacteria inside the xylem vessels. The bacteria measured 0.3 to 0.5 microm in width and 1.5 to 3.0 microm in length, and had rippled cell walls 10 to 40 nm in thickness, typical of X. fastidiosa. Small, circular, dome-shaped colonies were observed 7 to 26 days after plating of plant extracts on PW agar. The colonies were comprised of Gram-negative rods of variable length and a characteristic slight longitudinal bending. TEM of the isolated bacteria showed characteristic rippled cell walls, similar to those observed in plant tissue. ELISA and PCR with specific primer pairs 272-l-int/272-2-int and RST31/RST33 confirmed the identity of the isolated bacteria as X. fastidiosa. RFLP analysis of the amplification products revealed diversity within X. fastidiosa strains from Costa Rica and suggest closer genetic proximity to strains from the United States of America than to other coffee or citrus strains from Brazil.",M1
18971953,"Stability across environments of the <e>coffee</e> variety near infrared spectral signature.Previous study on food plants has shown that near infrared (NIR) spectral methods seem effective for authenticating coffee varieties. We confirm that result, but also show that inter-variety differences are not stable from one harvest to the next. We put forward the hypothesis that the spectral signature is affected by environmental factors. The purpose of this study was to find a way of reducing this environmental variance to increase the method's reliability and to enable practical application in breeding. Spectral collections were obtained from ground green coffee samples from multilocation trials. Two harvests of bean samples from 11 homozygous introgressed lines, and the cv 'Caturra' as the control, supplied from three different sites, were compared. For each site, squared Euclidean distances among the 12 varieties were estimated from the NIR spectra. Matrix correlation coefficients were assessed by the Mantel test. We obtained very good stability (high correlations) for inter-variety differences across the sites when using the two harvests data. If only the most heritable zones of the spectrum were used, there was a marked improvement in the efficiency of the method. This improvement was achieved by treating the spectrum as succession of phenotypic variables, each resulting from an environmental and genetic effect. Heritabilities were calculated with confidence intervals. A near infrared spectroscopy signature, acquired over a set of harvests, can therefore effectively characterize a coffee variety. We indicated how this typical signature can be used in breeding to assist in selection.",M1
18959416,"Comparative proteomical analysis of zygotic embryo and endosperm from Coffea arabica seeds.During <e>coffee</e> seed development, proteins are predominantly deposited in cotyledons and in the endosperm. Reserve proteins of the 11S family are the most abundant globulins in coffee seeds, acting as a nitrogen source during roasting and guaranteeing flavor and aroma. The aim of the present study was to compare the protein profiles of endosperm and zygotic embryos of coffee seeds. Proteins were extracted from whole seed as well as from embryo and endosperm, separately. Total proteins were analyzed by two-dimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) followed by identification by mass spectrometry (MS). The most abundant spots observed in the gels of coffee seeds were excised, digested with trypsin, and identified by MS as subunits of the 11S globulin. Spots with identical pI and molecular masses were also observed in the protein profiles of coffee endosperm and embryo, indicating that 11S protein is also highly expressed in those tissues. Peptide sequence coverage of about 20% of the entire 11S globulin was obtained. Three other proteins were identified in the embryo and endosperm 2-DE profiles as a Cupin superfamily protein, an allergenic protein (Pru ar 1), exclusive to the endosperm 2D map, and a hypothetical protein, observed only in the zygotic embryo profile.",M1
18954729,"Succession of bacterial and fungal communities during natural <e>coffee</e> (Coffea arabica) fermentation.Bacteria, yeasts and filamentous fungi were isolated during natural coffee processing. Bacteria were isolated in greater numbers at the beginning of the fermentation, when the moisture of the coffee beans was around 68%. Gram-positive bacteria represented 85.5% of all bacteria isolated, and Bacillus was the predominant genus (51%). Gram-negative species of the genera Serratia, Enterobacter and Acinetobacter were also found. Approximately 22% of 940 randomly chosen isolates of microorganisms were yeasts. Debaryomyces (27%), Pichia (18.9%) and Candida (8.0%) were the most commonly found genera, and these three genera tended to appear more often as the fruit was fermented and dried. Aspergillus was the most abundant genus besides Penicillium, Fusarium and Cladosporium, with 42.6% of the total fungi isolates. The genera and species identified included members known to have pectinase and cellulase activities.

Nevertheless, little is known about populations of its causal agent, Cercospora coffeicola. We evaluated the potential of using nitrogen-nonutilizing (nit) mutants and vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) to characterize the genetic variability of the C. coffeicola population associated with coffee plantings in Minas Gerais state (MG), Brazil. A total of 90 monosporic isolates were obtained from samples collected according to a hierarchical sampling scheme: (i) state geographical regions (Sul, Mata, and TriÃ¢ngulo), and (ii) production systems (conventional and organic). Nit mutants were obtained and 28 VCGs were identified. The 10 largest VCGs included 72.31% of all isolates, whereas each of the remaining 18 VCGs included 1.54% of the isolates. Isolates of the largest VCGs were found in the three regions sampled. Based on the frequencies of VCGs at each sampled level, we estimated the Shannon diversity index, as well as its richness and evenness components. Genetic variability was high at all hierarchical levels, and a high number of VCGs was found in populations of C. coffeicola associated with both conventional and organic coffee plantings.",M1
18826664,"Effect of <e>coffee</e> alkaloids and phenolics on egg-laying by the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera coffeella.The recognized importance of coffee alkaloids and phenolics mediating insect-plant interactions led to the present investigation aiming to test the hypothesis that the phenolics chlorogenic and caffeic acids and the alkaloid caffeine and some of its derivatives present in coffee leaves affect egg-laying by the coffee leaf miner Leucoptera (=Perileucoptera) coffeella (GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville &amp; Perrottet) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), one of the main coffee pests in the Neotropical region. These phytochemicals were, therefore, quantified in leaves from 12 coffee genotypes and their effect on the egg-laying preference by the coffee leaf miner was assessed. Canonical variate analysis and partial canonical correlation provided evidence that increased leaf levels of caffeine favour egg-laying by the coffee leaf miner. An egg-laying preference bioassay was, therefore, carried out to specifically test this hypothesis using increasing caffeine concentrations sprayed on leaves of one of the coffee genotypes with the lowest level of this compound (i.e. Hybrid UFV 557-04 generated from a cross between Coffea racemosa Lour. and C. arabica L.). The results obtained allowed the recognition of a significant concentration-response relationship, providing support for the hypothesis that caffeine stimulates egg-laying by the coffee leaf miner in coffee leaves.",M1
18819720,"Isolation, identification and toxigenic potential of ochratoxin A-producing Aspergillus species from <e>coffee</e> beans grown in two regions of Thailand.In 2006 and 2007, 32 Thai dried coffee bean samples (Coffea arabica) from two growing sites of Chiang Mai Province, and 32 Thai dried coffee bean samples (Coffea canephora var. robusta) from two growing sites of Chumphon Province, Thailand, were collected and assessed for the distribution of fungi with the potential to produce ochratoxin A (OTA). The overall percentage of fungal contamination in coffee was 98% and reduced to 60% after surface disinfection. There were remarkable ecological differences in the composition of ochratoxigenic species present in these two regions. Arabica coffee bean samples from the North had an average of 78% incidence of colonization with Aspergillus of section Circumdati with Aspergillus westerdijkiae and A. melleus as the predominant species. Aspergillus spp. of section Nigri were found in 75% of the samples whereas A. ochraceus was not detected. Robusta coffee beans from the South were 98-100% contaminated with predominantly A. carbonarius and A. niger. A. westerdijkiae was only found in one sample. The diversity of the fungal population was probably correlated with the geographical origin of the coffee, coffee cultivar, and processing method. Representative isolates of section Circumdati (52) and Nigri (82) were examined for their OTA production using HPLC with fluorescence detection. Aspergillus westerdijkiae (42 isolates out of 42), A. steynii (13/13), and A. carbonarius (35/35) in general produced large amounts of OTA, while one isolate of A. sclerotiorum produced intermediate amounts of OTA. 13% of the A. niger isolates produced OTA in intermediate amounts. OTA levels in coffee bean samples were analyzed using the Ridascreen OTA ELISA kits. Of the 64 coffee bean samples analyzed, 98% were contaminated with OTA in levels of &lt;0.6-5.5 microg/kg (Arabica) and 1-27 microg/kg (Robusta). Presence of OTA in representative coffee samples was also confirmed by LC-MS/MS after ion-exchange purification.",M1

Prussian blue method was adapted to 96-well microplates to quantify GA in LAB microcultures. Normalized data of growth and GA consumption were used to characterize strains into four phenotypes. A number of 5 LAB strains showed more than 60% of tolerance to GA at 2 g/l; whereas at 10 g/l GA growth inhibition was detected to a different extent depending on each strain, although GA consumption was observed in seven studied strains (&gt;60%). Lactobacillus plantarum L-08 was selected for further studies based on its capacity to degrade GA at 10 g/l (97%). MRS broth and GA concentrations were varied to study the effect on growth of LAB. Cell density and growth rate were optimized by response surface methodology and kinetic analysis. Maximum growth was attained after 7.5 h of cultivation, with a dilution factor of 1-1/2 and a GA concentration between 0.625 and 2.5 g/l. Results indicated that the main factor affecting LAB growth was GA concentration. The main contribution of this study was to propose a novel adaptation of a methodology to characterize and select LAB strains with detoxifying potential of simple phenolics based on GA consumption and tolerance. In addition, the methodology presented in this study integrated the well-known RSM with an experimental design based on successive dilutions.",M1

The method was then utilized to quantify NAG and NAA in other foodstuffs (fruits, vegetables, meats, grains, milk, <e>coffee</e>, tea, cocoa, and others). Both NAG and NAA were present in all of the materials analyzed. The highest concentration of NAG was found in cocoa powder. The highest concentration of NAA was found in roasted coffee beans.

Volatile components, sampled by headspace solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME), were analyzed by GC x GC-qMS, and separation results were adopted to classify, correlate, and/or compare samples and evaluate processing effects. The high-complexity sample profiles were interpreted through different methods: a group-type characterization, a direct fingerprint comparison, and a template matching to extract useful and consistent information, and advantages and limits of each specific approach were critically evaluated. The group-type analysis, focused on several known botanical and technological markers, enabled sample comparison and characterization based on their quali-quantitative distribution; it is highly reliable, because of the authentic standard confirmation, and extends the comparative procedure to trace and minor components. Fingerprint approaches (i.e., direct fingerprint comparison and template matching), on the other hand, extended sample comparisons and correlations to the whole volatiles offering an increased discrimination potential and improved sensitivity due to the wider analyte pattern considered. This study demonstrates the ability of comprehensive GC to further explore the complexity of roasted samples and emphasizes the advantages of, and the need for, a comprehensive and multidisciplinary approach to interpret the increased level of information provided by GC x GC separation in its full complexity.",M1
18680301,"Roasting effects on formation mechanisms of <e>coffee</e> brew melanoidins.The effect of the roasting degree on coffee brew melanoidin properties and formation mechanisms was studied. Coffee brew fractions differing in molecular weight (Mw) were isolated from green and light-, medium-, and dark-roasted coffee beans. Isolated fractions were characterized for their melanoidin, nitrogen, protein, phenolic groups, chlorogenic acid, quinic acid, caffeic acid, and sugar content. It was found that the melanoidin level in all fractions correlated with both the nitrogen and the protein content. The melanoidin level also correlated with the phenolic groups' level and ester-linked quinic acid level. It was concluded that proteins and chlorogenic acids should be primarily involved in melanoidin formation. Initial roasting, from green to light-roasted beans, especially led to the formation of intermediate Mw (IMw) melanoidins when compared to high Mw (HMw) melanoidins. Indications were found that this IMw melanoidin formation is mainly due to Maillard reactions and chlorogenic acid incorporation reactions between chlorogenic acids, sucrose, and amino acids/protein fragments. Additionally, it was found that prolonged roasting predominantly led to formation melanoidins with a high Mw. Furthermore, arabinogalactans seem to be relatively more involved in melanoidin formation than galactomannans. It was hypothesized that chromophores may be formed or attached through the arabinose moiety of arabinogalactan proteins (AGP). Finally, it could be concluded that galactomannans are continuously incorporated in AGP-melanoidins upon roasting.",M1
18624446,"Determination of acrylamide during roasting of <e>coffee</e>.In this study different Arabica and Robusta coffee beans from different regions of the world were analyzed for acrylamide after roasting in a laboratory roaster. Due to the complex matrix and the comparably low selectivity of the LC-MS at m/ z 72, acrylamide was analyzed after derivatization with 2-mercaptobenzoic acid at m/ z 226. Additionally, the potential precursors of acrylamide (3-aminopropionamide, carbohydrates, and amino acids) were studied. The highest amounts of acrylamide formed in coffee were found during the first minutes of the roasting process [3800 ng/g in Robusta ( Coffea canephora robusta) and 500 ng/g in Arabica ( Coffea arabica)]. When the roasting time was increased, the concentration of acrylamide decreased. It was shown that especially the roasting time and temperature, species of coffee, and amount of precursors in raw material had an influence on acrylamide formation. Robusta coffee contained significantly larger amounts of acrylamide (mean = 708 ng/g) than Arabica coffee (mean = 374 ng/g). Asparagine is the limiting factor for acrylamide formation in coffee. 3-Aminopropionamide formation was observed in a dry model system with mixtures of asparagine with sugars (sucrose, glucose). Thermal decarboxylation and elimination of the alpha-amino group of asparagine at high temperatures (&gt;220 degrees C) led to a measurable but low formation of acrylamide.",M1
18617534,"ABA inhibits embryo cell expansion and early cell division events during <e>coffee</e> (Coffea arabica 'Rubi') seed germination.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Coffee seed germination represents an interplay between the embryo and the surrounding endosperm. A sequence of events in both parts of the seed determines whether germination will be successful or not. Following previous studies, the aim here was to further characterize the morphology of endosperm degradation and embryo growth with respect to morphology and cell cycle, and the influence of abscisic acid on these processes. METHODS: Growth of cells in a fixed region of the axis was quantified from light micrographs. Cell cycle events were measured by flow cytometry and by immunocytochemistry, using antibodies against beta-tubulin. Aspects of the endosperm were visualized by light and scanning electron microscopy. KEY RESULTS: The embryonic axis cells grew initially by isodiametric expansion. This event coincided with reorientation and increase in abundance of microtubules and with accumulation of beta-tubulin. Radicle protrusion was characterized by a shift from isodiametric expansion to elongation of radicle cells and further accumulation of beta-tubulin. Early cell division events started prior to radicle protrusion. Abscisic acid decreased the abundance of microtubules and inhibited the growth of the embryo cells, the reorganization of the microtubules, DNA replication in the embryonic axis, the formation of a protuberance and the completion of germination. The endosperm cap cells had smaller and thinner cell walls than the rest of the endosperm. Cells in the endosperm cap displayed compression followed by loss of cell integrity and the appearance of a protuberance prior to radicle protrusion. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee seed germination is the result of isodiametric growth of the embryo followed by elongation, at the expense of integrity of endosperm cap cells. The cell cycle, including cell division, is initiated prior to radicle protrusion. ABA inhibits expansion of the embryo, and hence subsequent events, including germination.",M1
18588316,"Identification and in vitro cytotoxicity of ochratoxin A degradation products formed during <e>coffee</e> roasting.The mycotoxin ochratoxin A is degraded by up to 90% during coffee roasting. In order to investigate this degradation, model heating experiments with ochratoxin A were carried out, and the reaction products were analyzed by HPLC-DAD and HPLC-MS/MS. Two ochratoxin A degradation products were identified, and their structure and absolute configuration were determined. As degradation reactions, the isomerization to 14-(R)-ochratoxin A and the decarboxylation to 14-decarboxy-ochratoxin A were identified. Subsequently, an analytical method for the determination of these compounds in roasted coffee was developed. Quantification was carried out by HPLC-MS/MS and the use of stable isotope dilution analysis. By using this method for the analysis of 15 coffee samples from the German market, it could be shown that, during coffee roasting, the ochratoxin A diastereomer 14-(R)-ochratoxin A was formed in amounts of up to 25.6% relative to ochratoxin A. The decarboxylation product was formed only in traces. For toxicity evaluations, first preliminary cell culture assays were performed with the two new substances. Both degradation products exhibited higher IC50 values and caused apoptotic effects with higher concentrations than ochratoxin A in cultured human kidney epithelial cells. Thus, these cell culture data suggest that the degradation products are less cytotoxic than ochratoxin A.",M1

Volatile compounds and potent odorants obtained from each headspace aroma of various arabica coffee extracts (3 production countries: Ethiopia, Tanzania, and Guatemala; 3 roasting degrees for each country: L26, L23, and L18) using the sampling method were examined by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and GC/olfactometry (GC/O, CharmAnalysis). The results of principal component analysis (PCA) using the data of GC/O analysis showed that the aroma profile of Ethiopian coffee was discriminately different from those of Tanzanian coffee and Guatemalan coffee. In addition, it was suggested from the factor loading of the PCA that 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone (raspberry ketone; sweet-fruity odor) characterized the aroma profile of freshly brewed Ethiopian coffee. Therefore, the 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone was quantified in the 9 kinds of coffee extracts. Ethiopian coffee extract of the lightly roasted degree (roasting degree: L26) contained the highest amount of this component, while it was only a little over the reported threshold. In the sensory test, the headspace aromas of Tanzanian and Guatemalan coffees in which 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone was added were, respectively, discriminated from not added samples, and  sweet  odor was selected as an odor description that assessors found similarity between the added Tanzanian or Guatemalan coffee aroma and the Ethiopian coffee aroma. It was suggested that 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone made some detectable change on total aroma profile even though the added amount was only near threshold level.",M1

However, only those bored berries which remain in the soil surface before a new yielding period have been recognized as responsible for the damage level Ho achieved by new developing berries. In this paper, we investigated in the plants and in the soil surface, the presence of Coffea canephora cv. Conilon berries bored by H. hampei during the yielding period in Ouro Preto d'Oeste, RondÃ´nia, Brazil. We took samples, weekly, from December 2000 to June 2001. The data were submitted to the Surviving Regression Analysis, based on a censored Weibull model. During the yielding period, berries fall down continuously and, in average, the proportion of H. hampei bored berries was 4 to 20 times higher in the soil (P &lt; 2,3 x 10-18, n = 62,747) than in the plants. Thus, we argue that adding the  soil environment  to the integrated management strategies could point to new technologies for the control of this insect.",M1
18572953,"<e>Coffee</e> roasting and aroma formation: application of different time-temperature conditions.The impact of time-temperature combinations of roasting processes on the kinetics of aroma formation in coffee was investigated. The development of 16 aroma compounds and the physical properties of coffee beans was followed in a commercial horizontal drum roasting process and in laboratory scale fluidizing-bed roasting processes at high temperature-short time and low temperature-long time conditions. All trials were run to an equal roast end point as defined by the lightness of coffee beans. In addition, the effect of excessive roasting on aroma composition was studied. Compared to low temperature-long time roasting, high temperature-short time roasting resulted in considerable differences in the physical properties and kinetics of aroma formation. Excessive roasting generally led to decreasing or stable amounts of volatile substances, except for hexanal, pyridine, and dimethyl trisulfide, whose concentrations continued to increase during over-roasting. When the drum roaster and the fluidizing bed roaster were operated in the so-called temperature profile mode, that is, along the identical development of coffee bean temperature over roasting time, the kinetics of aroma generation were similar in both processes.",M1
18572951,"Roasting and aroma formation: effect of initial moisture content and steam treatment.Initial moisture of green <e>coffee</e> may vary as a function of green coffee processing and storage conditions. The impact of initial moisture and steam treatment on roasting behavior and aroma formation was investigated. Steam treated coffees as well as coffees with initial moisture content of 5.10, 10.04, and 14.70 g water per 100 g wb were roasted. Light and dark roasting trials were carried out using a fluidizing-bed roaster with a batch size of 100 g of green beans. Differences in roast coffee attributes, that is, color, density, and organic roast loss, and odorant concentrations were more marked in light roasted than in dark roasted coffees. The results of roasting steam treated coffee suggest that this step affects roasting behavior primarily by extracting some aroma precursor compounds.",M1
18559179,"Indirect interactions between ant-tended hemipterans, a dominant ant Azteca instabilis (Hymenoptera: Formicidae), and shade trees in a tropical agroecosystem.The occurrence, intensity, and composition of mutualisms are dependent not only on the co-occurrence of mutualists, but also the broader biotic context in which they are embedded. Here, the influence of the specific nest tree identity of the ant Azteca instabilis (F. Smith) on the density of the green <e>coffee</e> scale (Coccus viridis Green) was studied in a coffee agroecosystem in southern Mexico. The hypothesis that an indirect competitive interaction for ant attendance occurs between a scale species (Octolecanium sp. Kondo) in the canopy of the shade tree Inga micheliana Harms and C. viridis, which inhabits coffee bushes (Coffea arabica) beneath the shade trees was tested. Coffee bushes beneath a different shade tree species (Alchornea latifolia Swartz) were used as an indication of C. viridis density in a noncompetitive environment. Results indicate that C. viridis occurs in significantly lower density adjacent to nests in Inga, supporting the hypothesis of indirect competition. Additional experimentation suggests that there is a mutualism between Azteca and Octolecanium and that this interaction may be mediated by a hierarchy in ant attendance of scale insects. Our results show the importance of considering the biotic context of ant-hemipteran mutualisms. In coffee agroecosystems, consideration of shade tree diversity and species composition may be directly applicable to the biological control of insect pests.",M1
18517217,"Effects of <e>coffee</e> bean aroma on the rat brain stressed by sleep deprivation: a selected transcript- and 2D gel-based proteome analysis.The aim of this study was 2-fold: (i) to demonstrate influences of roasted coffee bean aroma on rat brain functions by using the transcriptomics and proteomics approaches and (ii) to evaluate the impact of roasted coffee bean aroma on stress induced by sleep deprivation. The aroma of the roasted coffee beans was administered to four groups of adult male Wistar rats: 1, control group; 2, 24 h sleep deprivation-induced stress group (the stress group); 3, coffee aroma-exposed group without stress (the coffee group); and 4, the stress with coffee aroma group (the stress with coffee group). Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of some known genes responsive to aroma or stress was performed using total RNA from these four groups. A total of 17 selected genes of the coffee were differently expressed over the control. Additionally, the expression levels of 13 genes were different between the stress group and the stress with coffee group: Up-regulation was found for 11 genes, and down-regulation was seen for two genes in the stress with coffee group. We also looked to changes in protein profiles in these four samples using two-dimensional (2D) gel electrophoresis; 25 differently expressed gel spots were detected on 2D gels stained by silver nitrate. Out of these, a total of nine proteins were identified by mass spectrometry. Identified proteins belonged to five functional categories: antioxidant; protein fate; cell rescue, defense, and virulence; cellular communication/signal transduction mechanism; and energy metabolism. Among the differentially expressed genes and proteins between the stress and the stress with coffee group, NGFR, trkC, GIR, thiol-specific antioxidant protein, and heat shock 70 kDa protein 5 are known to have antioxidant or antistress functions. In conclusion, the roasted coffee bean aroma changes the mRNA and protein expression levels of the rat brain, providing for the first time clues to the potential antioxidant or stress relaxation activities of the coffee bean aroma.",M1

Significant differences existed in malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activities (key enzymes in organic acids metabolism) between protein extracts (day 7 of culture cycle) of the L2 (Al-sensitive) and LAMt (Al-tolerant) cells when cell suspensions were treated with 100 microM AlCl(3). HPLC analysis showed that the suspension cells of both lines exudate malate when incubated in a minimal solution but that exudation was not enhanced by treatment with AlCl(3) (100 microM). This is the first study demonstrating that plant Al-tolerance may be associated with down-regulation of malate dehydrogenase and citrate synthase activities.",M1
18481516,"An experimental study of habitat selection by birds in a <e>coffee</e> plantation.Unique components of tropical habitats, such as abundant vascular epiphytes, influence the distribution of species and can contribute to the high diversity of many animal groups in the tropics. However, the role of such features in habitat selection and demography of individual species has not been established. Understanding the mechanisms of habitat selection requires both experimental manipulation of habitat structure and detailed estimation of the behavioral and demographic response of animals, e.g., changes in movement patterns and survival probabilities. Such studies have not been conducted in natural tropical forest, perhaps because of high habitat heterogeneity, high species diversity, and low abundances of potential target species. Agroforestry systems support a less diverse flora, with greater spatial homogeneity which, in turn, harbors lower overall species diversity with greater numerical dominance of common species, than natural forests. Furthermore, agroforestry systems are already extensively managed and lend themselves easily to larger scale habitat manipulations than protected natural forest. Thus, agroforestry systems provide a good model environment for beginning to understand processes underlying habitat selection in tropical forest animals. Here, we use multistate, capture-recapture models to investigate how the experimental removal of epiphytes affected monthly movement and survival probabilities of two resident bird species (Common Bush-Tanager [Chlorospingus ophthalmicus] and Golden-crowned Warbler [Basileuterus culicivorus]) in a Mexican shade coffee plantation. We established two paired plots of epiphyte removal and control. We found that Bush-Tanagers were at least five times more likely to emigrate from plots where epiphytes were removed compared to control plots. Habitat-specific movement patterns were not detected in the warbler. However, unlike the Golden-crowned Warbler, Common Bush-Tanagers depend upon epiphytes for nest sites and (seasonally) for foraging. These dispersal patterns imply that active habitat selection based on the presence or absence of epiphytes occurs in C. ophthalmicus on our study area. Survival rates did not vary with habitat in either species. Interestingly, in both species, survival was higher in the nonbreeding season, when birds were in mixed-species flocks. Movement by Common Bush-Tanagers into areas with epiphytes occurred mostly during the breeding season, when mortality-driven opportunity was greatest.",M1

Detailed studies, focusing on a key mutualism between an ant (Azteca instabilis) and a scale insect (Coccus viridis), conducted in a 45-ha plot in a coffee agroforestry system have provided insights into (1) the quantitative evaluation of spatial pattern of the scale insect Coccus viridis on coffee bushes, (2) the mechanisms for the generation of patterns through the combination of local satellite ant nest formation and regional control from natural enemies, and (3) the consequences of the spatial pattern for the stability of predator-prey (host-parasitoid) systems, for a key coccinelid beetle preying on the scale insects and a phorid fly parasitoid parasitizing the ant.",M1
18447947,"Development of new genomic microsatellite markers from robusta <e>coffee</e> (Coffea canephora Pierre ex A. Froehner) showing broad cross-species transferability and utility in genetic studies.BACKGROUND: Species-specific microsatellite markers are desirable for genetic studies and to harness the potential of MAS-based breeding for genetic improvement. Limited availability of such markers for coffee, one of the most important beverage tree crops, warrants newer efforts to develop additional microsatellite markers that can be effectively deployed in genetic analysis and coffee improvement programs. The present study aimed to develop new coffee-specific SSR markers and validate their utility in analysis of genetic diversity, individualization, linkage mapping, and transferability for use in other related taxa. RESULTS: A small-insert partial genomic library of Coffea canephora, was probed for various SSR motifs following conventional approach of Southern hybridisation. Characterization of repeat positive clones revealed a very high abundance of DNRs (1/15 Kb) over TNRs (1/406 kb). The relative frequencies of different DNRs were found as AT &gt;&gt; AG &gt; AC, whereas among TNRs, AGC was the most abundant repeat. The SSR positive sequences were used to design 58 primer pairs of which 44 pairs could be validated as single locus markers using a panel of arabica and robusta genotypes. The analysis revealed an average of 3.3 and 3.78 alleles and 0.49 and 0.62 PIC per marker for the tested arabicas and robustas, respectively. It also revealed a high cumulative PI over all the markers using both sib-based (10-6 and 10-12 for arabicas and robustas respectively) and unbiased corrected estimates (10-20 and 10-43 for arabicas and robustas respectively). The markers were tested for Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium, linkage dis-equilibrium, and were successfully used to ascertain generic diversity/affinities in the tested germplasm (cultivated as well as species). Nine markers could be mapped on robusta linkage map. Importantly, the markers showed ~92% transferability across related species/genera of coffee. CONCLUSION: The conventional approach of genomic library was successfully employed although with low efficiency to develop a set of 44 new genomic microsatellite markers of coffee. The characterization/validation of new markers demonstrated them to be highly informative, and useful for genetic studies namely, genetic diversity in coffee germplasm, individualization/bar-coding for germplasm protection, linkage mapping, taxonomic studies, and use as conserved orthologous sets across secondary genepool of coffee. Further, the relative frequency and distribution of different SSR motifs in coffee genome indicated coffee genome to be relatively poor in microsatellites compared to other plant species.",M1

18433138,"Modeling the formation of some polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons during the roasting of Arabica <e>coffee</e> samples.Roasting is a critical process in coffee production, as it enables the development of flavor and aroma. At the same time, roasting may lead to the formation of nondesirable compounds, such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). In this study, Arabica green coffee beans from Cuba were roasted under controlled conditions to monitor PAH formation during the roasting process. Roasting was performed in a pilot-spouted bed roaster, with the inlet air temperature varying from 180 to 260 degrees C, for roasting conditions ranging from 5 to 20 min. Several PAHs were determined in both roasted coffee samples and green coffee samples. Different models were tested, with more or less assumptions on the chemical phenomena, with a view to predict the system global behavior. Two kinds of models were used and compared: kinetic models (based on Arrhenius law) and statistical models (neural networks). The numbers of parameters to adjust differed for the tested models, varying from three to nine for the kinetic models and from five to 13 for the neural networks. Interesting results are presented, with satisfactory correlations between experimental and predicted concentrations for some PAHs, such as pyrene, benz[a]anthracene, chrysene, and anthracene.",M1
18420417,"Effects of shade on the development and sugar metabolism of <e>coffee</e> (Coffea arabica L.) fruits.Coffee fruits grown in shade are characterized by larger bean size than those grown under full-sun conditions. The present study assessed the effects of shade on bean characteristics and sugar metabolism by analyzing tissue development, sugar contents, activities of sucrose metabolizing enzymes and expression of sucrose synthase-encoding genes in fruits of coffee (Coffea arabica L.) plants submitted to full-sun (FS) and shade (SH) conditions. Evolution of tissue fresh weights measured in fruits collected regularly from flowering to maturation indicated that this increase is due to greater development of the perisperm tissue in the shade. The effects of light regime on sucrose and reducing sugar (glucose and fructose) contents were studied in fresh and dry coffee beans. Shade led to a significant reduction in sucrose content and to an increase in reducing sugars. In pericarp and perisperm tissues, higher activities of sucrose synthase (EC 2.4.1.13) and sucrose-phosphate synthase (SPS: EC 2.4.1.14) were detected at maturation in the shade compared with full sun. These two enzymes also had higher peaks of activities in developing endosperm under shade than in full sun. It was also noted that shade modified the expression of SUS-encoding genes in coffee beans; CaSUS2 gene transcripts levels were higher in SH than in FS. As no sucrose increase accompanied these changes, this suggests that sucrose metabolism was redirected to other metabolic pathways that need to be identified.",M1

Arabica genotypes generally produce a higher coffee quality than Robusta genotypes. Understanding the genetic basis for sucrose accumulation during coffee grain maturation is an important goal because sucrose is an important coffee flavor precursor. * Nine new Coffea genes encoding sucrose metabolism enzymes have been identified: sucrose phosphate synthase (CcSPS1, CcSPS2), sucrose phosphate phosphatase (CcSP1), cytoplasmic (CaInv3) and cell wall (CcInv4) invertases and four invertase inhibitors (CcInvI1, 2, 3, 4). * Activities and mRNA abundance of the sucrose metabolism enzymes were compared at different developmental stages in Arabica and Robusta grains, characterized by different sucrose contents in mature grain. * It is concluded that Robusta accumulates less sucrose than Arabica for two reasons: Robusta has higher sucrose synthase and acid invertase activities early in grain development - the expression of CcSS1 and CcInv2 appears to be crucial at this stage and Robusta has a lower SPS activity and low CcSPS1 expression at the final stages of grain development and hence has less capacity for sucrose re-synthesis.

18348809,"Behavioral diversity of predatory arboreal ants in <e>coffee</e> agroecosystems.Aspects of predator assemblages that alter predator effects on prey have received extensive recent attention. Among other mechanisms, differences in behavior or resource use within predator trophic levels may enhance predator effects on prey, especially if effects of each predator species differ with environmental conditions. We address whether three common ant species (Azteca instabilis F. Smith, Camponotus textor Forel, and Crematogaster spp.) are functionally unique in coffee agroecosystems, asking if each species differs in (1) cooperative foraging behavior, (2) responses to experimentally introduced herbivores, and (3) responses to pest outbreaks. Furthermore, we examined the behaviors and effects of each ant species under different conditions by varying herbivore species, herbivore size, and herbivore density and carrying out observations in different seasons. Ant species significantly differed in foraging behaviors, in effects on individual herbivores, and in responses to pest outbreaks in terms of both type and time of response to herbivores. The behaviors and effects of each ant species differed in the dry and wet seasons and for different herbivore species and sizes. Although A. instabilis generally removed more larvae and more quickly removed larvae, this was not the case under all conditions. The data presented thus support that common ant species in coffee agroecosystems are behaviorally diverse in their responses to herbivores under different conditions. We discuss the implications of these differences in ant behaviors for enhancement of predatory function in light of both multipredator effects and in terms of the potential importance of predator diversity.",M1
18348805,"Cheating on a mutualism: indirect benefits of ant attendance to a coccidophagous coccinellid.Coccinellids (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae) are generally unable to prey on ant-tended prey. However, particular coccinellid species have morphological, behavioral, or chemical characteristics that render them immune to ant attacks, and some species are even restricted to ant-tending areas. The benefit gained from living in close association with ants can be twofold: (1) gaining access to high-density prey areas and (2) gaining enemy-free space. Here, the myrmecophily of Azya orbigera Mulsant (Coleoptera: Coccinellidae), an important predator of the green <e>coffee</e> scale, Coccus viridis (Green) (Hemiptera: Coccidae), is reported. In this paper, three main questions were studied. (1) Are the waxy filaments of A. orbigera larvae effective as defense against attacks of the mutualistic ant partner of C. viridis, Azteca instabilis F. Smith (Hymenoptera: Formicidae)? (2) Does A. instabilis reduce the rate at which A. orbigera larvae prey on scales? (3) Do A. orbigera larvae gain enemy-free space by living in close association with A. instabilis? Laboratory and field experiments were conducted to answer these questions. We found that, because of the sticky waxy filaments of A. orbigera larvae, A. instabilis is incapable of effectively attacking them and, therefore, the predation rate of A. orbigera on C. viridis does not decrease in the presence of ants. Furthermore, A. instabilis showed aggressive behavior toward A. orbigera's parasitoids, and the presence of ants reduced the parasitism suffered by A. orbigera. This is the first time that this kind of indirect positive effect is reported for an ant and a coccidophagous coccinellid. Furthermore, this indirect positive effect may be key to the persistence of A. orbigera's populations.",M1
18316320,"Agrobacterium rhizogenes-transformed roots of <e>coffee</e> (Coffea arabica): conditions for long-term proliferation, and morphological and molecular characterization.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The aims of this study were to set up proliferation conditions for hairy roots of Coffea arabica regenerated after transformation by Agrobacterium rhizogenes strain A4-RS, and to carry out the morphological and molecular characterization of hairy root clones maintained over the long term. METHODS: Auxin supply, light conditions and sucrose concentration were modified with the aim of establishing efficient root proliferation conditions. The morphological variability among 62 established hairy root clones was phenotyped by scanning the roots and analysing the images using 'whinRHIZO' software procedures. PCR analysis of integration in transformed root cells of rol and aux oncogenes from the T-DNA of the Ri plasmid was used to study the molecular variability among clones. KEY RESULTS: Auxin supply was necessary to obtain and stimulate growth and branching, and IBA applied at 0.5 microm was the most efficient auxin. Significant differences were shown among the 62 clones for total root length and for the percentage of fine roots. These variables were stable across subcultures and could hence be used for efficient characterization of hairy root clones. The majority of hairy root clones (86 %) exhibited non-significant phenotype differences with non-transformed roots. Eight clones were significantly different from the non-transformed controls in that they possessed a low proportion of fine roots. Two other hairy root clones grew significantly faster than the other clones. The PCR analysis revealed a low variability in the integration of rol and aux oncogenes in transformed root cells. The T(R)-DNA was never integrated as aux1 and aux2 genes were not found, although rolB and rolC genes from the T(L)-DNA were always present. CONCLUSIONS: The discovery of low morphological variability among coffee hairy roots together with the identification of morphological variables allowing easy identification of phenotypically altered clones represent two important results. They make hairy roots a possible, and efficient, tool for functional-genomic studies of coffee root genes.",M1

The experimental design included three Colombian locations in full combination with five (one traditional and four introgressed) Arabica varieties and two field replications. Chlorogenic acids, fatty acids, and elements were analyzed in coffee bean samples by HPLC, GC, and ICP-AES, respectively. Principal component analysis and discriminant analysis were carried out to compare the three methods. Although elements provided an excellent classification of the three locations studied, this chemical class was useless for Arabica variety discrimination. Chlorogenic acids gave satisfactory results, but fatty acids clearly offered the best results for the determination of both varieties and environments, with very high percentages of correct classification (79 and 90%, respectively).",M1

Four treatments were applied at the whole-plant level: (i) complete defruiting and maintenance of the full leaf area, (ii) the half crop load and full leaf area, (iii) the full crop load and full leaf area and (iv) the full crop load and half leaf area. Sampling and measurements were performed twice during the phase of dry matter accumulation of fruits. Gas exchange, chlorophyll a fluorescence, carbon isotope labelling and steady-state metabolite measurements were assessed in source leaves. The average rate of net photosynthetic rate (A) and stomatal conductance (g(s)) were larger (&gt; 50%), and carbon isotope composition ratio was lower, in trees with a full crop load and half leaf area than in defruited trees, with individuals of the other two treatments showing intermediate values. However, differences in A seem unlikely to have been caused either by photochemical impairments or a direct end-product-mediated feedback down-regulation of photosynthesis. It is proposed that the decreased A in defruited coffee trees was independent of carbon metabolism and was rather directly related to a lower CO(2) availability coupled to lower g(s).",M1
18248385,"Effects of predatory ants on lower trophic levels across a gradient of <e>coffee</e> management complexity.1. Ants are important predators in agricultural systems, and have complex and often strong effects on lower trophic levels. Agricultural intensification reduces habitat complexity, food web diversity and structure, and affects predator communities. Theory predicts that strong top-down cascades are less likely to occur as habitat and food web complexity decrease. 2. To examine relationships between habitat complexity and predator effects, we excluded ants from coffee plants in coffee agroecosystems varying in vegetation complexity. Specifically, we studied the effects of eliminating ants on arthropod assemblages, herbivory, damage by the coffee berry borer and coffee yields in four sites differing in management intensification. We also sampled ant assemblages in each management type to see whether changes in ant assemblages relate to any observed changes in top-down effects. 3. Removing ants did not change total arthropod densities, herbivory, coffee berry borer damage or coffee yields. Ants did affect densities of some arthropod orders, but did not affect densities of different feeding groups. The effects of ants on lower trophic levels did not change with coffee management intensity. 4. Diversity and activity of ants on experimental plants did not change with coffee intensification, but the ant species composition differed. 5. Although variation in habitat complexity may affect trophic cascades, manipulating predatory ants across a range of coffee agroecosystems varying in management intensity did not result in differing effects on arthropod assemblages, herbivory, coffee berry borer attack or coffee yields. Thus, there is no clear pattern that top-down effects of ants in coffee agroecosystems intensify or dampen with decreased habitat complexity.",M1

In addition, there is a lingering concern that coffee mighty increase the risk of pancreatic cancer although the most recent epidemiological studies showed no overall association between coffee and risk. Here, we examined the association between the drinking of green tea or coffee and the risk of pancreatic cancer in a large population-based cohort study in Japan (JPHC study). In total, 102 137 participants were followed for an average of 11 years through to the end of 2003. A total of 233 incident cases of pancreatic cancer were identified among 1 116 945 person-years of follow-up. Overall, the risk of pancreatic cancer was not associated with either green tea or coffee intake in our population, although a reduced risk was apparent among men who drank at least three cups of coffee per day compared with those who did not drink any or only rarely drank coffee. In conclusion, our findings support the idea that green tea or coffee consumption does not have a substantial impact on pancreatic cancer risk in general.",M1
18076778,"Comparison of five allopatric fruit fly parasitoid populations (Psyttalia species) (Hymenoptera: Braconidae) from <e>coffee</e> fields using morphometric and molecular methods.Morphometric studies of five allopatric parasitoid populations (genus Psyttalia Walker) from coffee plantations in Cameroon (Nkolbisson), Ghana (Tafo) and Kenya (Rurima, Ruiru and Shimba Hills) and one non-coffee population (from Muhaka, Kenya) were compared with individuals of Psyttalia concolor (SzÃ©pligeti), a species released in several biological control programmes in the Mediterranean Region since the 20th Century. Analyses of wing vein measurements showed the second submarginal cell of the fore wing and its adjoining veins had the heaviest principal component weights and served as the main contributing variables in the diagnostic differentiation of the populations. Two populations (Rurima and Ruiru) were found to be the closest to each other and with the strongest phenetic affinity toward P. concolor (and forming one cluster). Populations from Shimba Hills (of unknown identity), Nkolbisson (P. perproximus (Silvestri)) and Tafo formed a second cluster and were separated from P. concolor. Comparison using amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) also showed the Shimba, Nkolbisson and Tafo populations forming a cluster in a dendrogram generated from their genetic distances, with the Shimba and Tafo populations placed as the most closely related species. Based on consistent morphological similarities, morphometric and ecological data coupled with the genetic evidence from AFLP data, the Shimba population is suggested as belonging to the P. perproximus group and, thus, represents a new occurrence record in Kenya. Our results also support earlier conclusion from cross mating data that populations from Rurima and Ruiru belong to the Psyttalia concolor species-group.",M1
18069248,"Biosynthesis of chlorogenic acids in growing and ripening fruits of Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora plants.Chlorogenic acids are major secondary metabolites found in <e>coffee</e> seeds. The accumulation of chlorogenic acids and free quinic acids was studied in Coffea arabica cv. Tall Mokka and Coffea canephora seeds. Growth stages are specified from I to V, corresponding to rapid expansion and pericarp growth (I), endosperm formation (II), mature (green) (III), ripening (pink) (IV), and fully ripened (red) (V) stages. We detected monocaffeoylquinic acids (3CQA, 4CQA and 5CQA), dicaffeoylquinic acids (3,4diCQA, 3,5diCQA and 4,5diCQA) and a monoferuloylquinic acid (5FQA) in whole fruits (stage I), pericarps and seeds. The most abundant chlorogenic acid was 5CQA, which comprised 50-60% of the total of C. arabica and 45-50% of C. canephora seeds. The content of dicaffeoylquinic acid, mainly 3,5-diCQA, was high in C. canephora. A high content of 5FQA was found in seeds of stages III to V, especially in C. canephora. Total chlorogenic acids were accumulated up to 14 mg per fruit in C. arabica and 17 mg in C. canephora, respectively. In contrast, free quinic acid varied from 0.4-2.0 mg (C. arabica) and 0.2-4.0 mg (C. canephora) per fruit during growth. High biosynthetic activity of 5CQA, which was estimated via the incorporation of [U-14C]phenylalanine into chlorogenic acids, was found in young fruits (perisperm and pericarp) in stage I, and in developing seeds (endosperm) in stages II and III. The biosynthetic activity of chlorogenic acids was clearly reduced in ripening and ripe seeds, especially in C canephora. Transcripts of PAL1, C3'H and CCoAMT, three genes related to the chlorogenic acid biosynthesis, were detected in every stagÃ¨ of growth, although the amounts were significantly less in stage V. Of these genes, CCoAMT, a gene for FQA biosynthesis, was expressed more weakly in stage I. The transcript level of CCoAMT was higher in seeds than in pericarp, but the reverse was found in PAL1. The pattern of expression of genes for the CQA and FQA synthesis is roughly related to the estimated biosynthetic activity, and to the accumulation pattern of chlorogenic acids.",M1
18068204,"Caffeine and related purine alkaloids: biosynthesis, catabolism, function and genetic engineering.Details of the recently elucidated biosynthetic pathways of caffeine and related purine alkaloids are reviewed. The main caffeine biosynthetic pathway is a sequence consisting of xanthosine--&gt;7-methylxanthosine--&gt;7-methylxanthine--&gt;theobromine--&gt;caffeine. Genes encoding N-methyltransferases involved in three of these four reactions have been isolated and the molecular structure of N-methyltransferases investigated. Pathways for the catabolism of caffeine have also been studied, although there are currently no reports of enzymatic and genetic studies having been successfully carried out. Metabolism of purine alkaloids in species including Camellia, Coffea, Theobroma and Ilex plants is summarised, and evidence for the involvement of caffeine in chemical defense and allelopathy is discussed. Finally, information is presented on metabolic engineering that has produced <e>coffee</e> seedlings with reduced caffeine content, and transgenic caffeine-producing tobacco plants with enhanced disease resistance.",M1
18059542,"Development of genomic microsatellite markers in Coffea canephora and their transferability to other <e>coffee</e> species.Of the 103 accepted Coffea species, 70% are threatened with extinction but only a few of them have been studied. A set of 40 polymorphic microsatellite markers was developed using a GA/GT-enriched Coffea canephora genomic library. Amplification of these markers was tested in accessions of C. heterocalyx (a Critically Endangered species) and C. pseudozanguebariae (a Vulnerable species) belonging to different African geographical clades. All microsatellites were polymorphic in C. canephora, with a mean allele number per polymorphic locus of more than 3 (at least 9 genotypes were tested). Observed and expected heterozygosities calculated for C. canephora and C. pseudozanguebariae varied from 0.10 to 0.91 and from 0.20 to 0.77, respectively. In total, 38 primer pairs (95%) were amplified in C. heterocalyx and C. pseudozanguebariae, indicating their high level of transferability across the genus Coffea. This large marker set will be useful for more extensive genetic studies of threatened Coffea species.",M1
18031984,"First complete chromosomal organization of a protozoan plant parasite (Phytomonas spp.).Phytomonas spp. are members of the family Trypanosomatidae that parasitize plants and may cause lethal diseases in crops such as <e>Coffee</e> Phloem necrosis, Hartrot in coconut, and Marchitez sorpresiva in oil palm. In this study, the molecular karyotype of 6 isolates from latex plants has been entirely elucidated by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis and DNA hybridization. Twenty-one chromosomal linkage groups constituting heterologous chromosomes and sizing between 0.3 and 3 Mb could be physically defined by the use of 75 DNA markers (sequence-tagged sites and genes). From these data, the genome size can be estimated at 25.5 (+/-2) Mb. The physical linkage groups were consistently conserved in all strains examined. Moreover, the finding of several pairs of different-sized homologous chromosomes strongly suggest diploidy for this organism. The definition of the complete molecular karyotype of Phytomonas represents an essential primary step toward sequencing the genome of this parasite of economical importance.",M1
18026845,"Deciphering transcriptional networks that govern Coffea arabica seed development using combined cDNA array and real-time RT-PCR approaches.Due to its economic importance, Coffea arabica is becoming the subject of increasing genomic research and, in particular, the genes involved in the final chemical composition of the bean and the sensorial quality of the <e>coffee</e> beverage. The aim of the present study was to decipher the transcriptional networks that govern the development of the C. arabica seed, a model for non-orthodox albuminous seeds of tropical origin. For this purpose, we developed a transcriptomic approach combining two techniques: targeted cDNA arrays, containing 266 selected candidate gene sequences, and real-time RT-PCR on a large subset of 111 genes. The combination of the two techniques allowed us to limit detection of false positives and to reveal the advantages of using large real-time RT-PCR screening. Multivariate analysis was conducted on both datasets and results were broadly convergent. First, principle component analysis (PCA) revealed a dramatic re-programming of the transcriptional machinery between early cell division and elongation, storage and maturation phases. Second, hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA) led to the identification of 11 distinct patterns of gene expression during seed development as well as to the detection of genes expressed at specific developmental stages that can be used as functional markers of phenological changes. In addition, this study led to the description of gene expression profiles for quality-related genes, most of them formerly uncharacterised in Coffea. Their involvement in storage compound synthesis and accumulation during endosperm development and final metabolic re-adjustments during maturation is discussed.",M1
18001036,"Isolation, identification, and quantification of roasted <e>coffee</e> antibacterial compounds.Coffee brew is a widely consumed beverage with multiple biological activities due both to naturally occurring components and to the hundreds of chemicals that are formed during the roasting process. Roasted coffee extract possesses antibacterial activity against a wide range of microorganisms, including Staphylococcus aureus and Streptococcus mutans, whereas green coffee extract exhibits no such activity. The naturally occurring coffee compounds, such as chlorogenic acids and caffeine, cannot therefore be responsible for the significant antibacterial activity exerted by coffee beverages against both bacteria. The very low minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) found for standard glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl compounds formed during the roasting process points to these alpha-dicarbonyl compounds as the main agents responsible for the antibacterial activity of brewed coffee against Sa. aureus and St. mutans. However, their low concentrations determined in the beverage account for only 50% of its antibacterial activity. The addition of caffeine, which has weak intrinsic antibacterial activity, to a mixture of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds at the concentrations found in coffee demonstrated that caffeine synergistically enhances the antibacterial activity of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds and that glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl in the presence of caffeine account for the whole antibacterial activity of roasted coffee.",M1
17995637,"Analysis of the headspace volatiles of freshly brewed arabica <e>coffee</e> using solid-phase microextraction.Headspace volatiles of freshly brewed drip coffee were investigated by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) and gas chromatography/olfactometry (GC/O, CharmAnalysis) analyses. For this purpose, a solid-phase microextraction (SPME) sampling method for the headspace volatiles of freshly brewed drip coffee was developed. SPME fiber coated with divinylbenzene (DVB)/carboxen/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) was selected from 6 types, and sampling time was determined at 2 min. The headspace coffee volatiles stayed constant in proportion for the first 2 min to keep the freshness of the brewed coffee aroma. Using this sampling method, the headspace volatiles of freshly brewed drip coffee (Ethiopian arabica coffee, roast degree: L value; 23) were examined by GC/MS and GC/O analyses. From the GC/O results, 1-(3,4-dihydro-2H-pyrrol-2-yl)-ethanone (nutty-roast odor) and 4-(4'-hydroxyphenyl)-2-butanone (raspberry ketone, sweet-fruity odor) were newly detected as components in the aroma of coffee.",M1
17994691,"Release kinetics of volatile organic compounds from roasted and ground <e>coffee</e>: online measurements by PTR-MS and mathematical modeling.The present work shows the possibilities and limitations in modeling release kinetics of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) from roasted and ground coffee by applying physical and empirical models such as the diffusion and Weibull models. The release kinetics of VOCs were measured online by proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS). Compounds were identified by GC-MS, and the contribution of the individual compounds to different mass fragments was elucidated by GC/PTR-MS. Coffee samples roasted to different roasting degrees and ground to different particle sizes were studied under dry and wet stripping conditions. To investigate the accuracy of modeling the VOC release kinetics recorded using PTR-MS, online kinetics were compared with kinetics reconstituted from purge and trap samplings. Results showed that uncertainties in ion intensities due to the presence of isobaric species may prevent the development of a robust mathematical model. Of the 20 identified compounds, 5 were affected to a lower extent as their contribution to specific m/z intensity varied by &lt;15% over the stripping time. The kinetics of these compounds were fitted using physical and statistical models, respectively, the diffusion and Weibull models, which helped to identify the underlying release mechanisms. For dry stripping, the diffusion model allowed a good representation of the release kinetics, whereas for wet stripping conditions, release patterns were very complex and almost specific for each compound analyzed. In the case of prewetted coffee, varying particle size (approximately 400-1200 microm) had no significant effect on the VOC release rate, whereas for dry coffee, the release was faster for smaller particles. The absence of particle size effect in wet coffee was attributed to the increase of opened porosity and compound diffusivity by solubilization and matrix relaxation. To conclude, the accurate modeling of VOC release kinetics from coffee allowed small variations in compound release to be discriminated. Furthermore, it evidenced the different aroma compositions that may be obtained depending on the time when VOCs are recovered.",M1
17942183,"An investigation of carotenoid biosynthesis in Coffea canephora and Coffea arabica.Carotenoids are essential components of the photosynthetic apparatus in a wide range of organisms. They participate in the adaptation of plastids to changing environmental light conditions and prevent photo-oxidative damage of the photosynthetic apparatus by detoxifying reactive oxygen species. We identified eight cDNAs from the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway (PSY, PDS, ZDS, PTOX, LCY-E, CRTR-B, ZEP and VDE) and two cDNA encoding carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase family members (NCED3 and CCD1) in Coffea canephora. We also obtained cDNA encoding several different fibrillin proteins involved in carotenoid sequestration (FIB). Expression of the <e>coffee</e> carotenoid genes was determined in leaf, branch and flower tissues using quantitative RT-PCR. Expression analysis of these genes in leaf tissue from osmotically stressed plants was also carried out. These experiments showed that the transcript levels of PTOX, CRTR-B, NCED3, CCD1 and FIB1 increased under these stress conditions, while LCY-E decreased, indicating that the metabolic flux towards the xanthophyll cycle branch of the carotenoid biosynthetic pathway may be favoured in leaves under drought conditions. Functional analysis of CcCRTR-B using an in vivo method employing Escherichia coli strains engineered to make carotenoids confirmed that the beta-carotene hydroxylase activity of CcCRTR-B generates beta-cryptoxanthin and zeaxanthin from beta-carotene. A similar approach was also used to show that CcCCD1 encoded a functional 9,10(9'10') carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase, and thus that this enzyme is capable of forming one or more apocarotenoids in vivo. Finally, high-performance liquid chromatography analysis of coffee leaves revealed the presence of alpha-carotene and suggests that Coffea arabica may have higher levels of alpha-carotene than C. canephora.",M1

The results indicated that the Association of Official Analytical Chemists (AOAC) official method for the extraction of OTA in green coffee and determination by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) is recommended as an efficient method for the routine analyses of OTA in green and ground roasted coffee beans. This method proved to be an accurate, sensitive, and less-expensive method that employs routine materials and available equipment.

17927199,"Isolation and determination of alpha-dicarbonyl compounds by RP-HPLC-DAD in green and roasted <e>coffee</e>.Glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl formed as Maillard reaction products in heat-treated food were determined in coffee extracts (coffee brews) obtained from green beans and beans with different degrees of roast. The compounds have been reported to be mutagenic in vitro and genotoxic in experimental animals in a number of papers. More recently, alpha-dicarbonyl compounds have been implicated in the glycation process. Our data show that small amounts of glyoxal and methylglyoxal occur naturally in green coffee beans. Their concentrations increase in the early phases of the roasting process and then decline. Conversely, diacetyl is not found in green beans and forms later in the roasting process. Therefore, light and medium roasted coffees had the highest glyoxal and methylglyoxal content, whereas dark roasted coffee contained smaller amounts of glyoxal, methylglyoxal, and diacetyl. For the determination of coffee alpha-dicarbonyl compounds, a reversed-phase high performance liquid chromatography with a diode array detector (RP-HPLC-DAD) method was devised that involved the elimination of interfering compounds, such as chlorogenic acids, by solid phase extraction (SPE) and their derivatization with 1,2-diaminobenzene to give quinoxaline derivatives. Checks of SPE and derivatization conditions to verify recovery and yield, respectively, resulted in rates of 100%. The results of the validation procedure showed that the proposed method is selective, precise, accurate, and sensitive.",M1

In Aspergillus species, ochratoxin synthesis depends on several environmental factors. The aims of this work were to evaluate the effect of water activity (0.995-0.85), temperature (15, 25 and 30 degrees C), incubation time (7, 14 and 21 days) and their interactions on OTA production on peanut, maize kernels, dried grapes and <e>coffee</e> beans meal extract agar medium by eight strains of Aspergillus section Nigri isolated from human food in Argentina. The optimum temperature for OTA production was 25 or 30 degrees C depending on the strains assayed, in most cases the highest OTA levels were achieved after 7 days of incubation, whereas this situation occurred at 15 degrees C after 14 days of incubation for only one strain. The maximum OTA level was obtained at earlier growth states when incubation temperature increased. In general, OTA concentration increased as water activity (a(W)) increased with no significant production at 0.85-0.91 a(W) under all temperature levels tested. Production occurred over a range of temperatures (15-30 degrees C) with optimum production at 30 degrees C depending on a(W) assayed. The knowledge of Aspergillus section Nigri ecophysiology is critical in the development and prediction of the risk models of raw material and final product contamination by these species under fluctuating and interacting environmental parameters.",M1
17918591,"Chemical oxygen demand reduction in <e>coffee</e> wastewater through chemical flocculation and advanced oxidation processes.The removal of the natural organic matter present in coffee processing wastewater through chemical coagulation-flocculation and advanced oxidation processes (AOP) had been studied. The effectiveness of the removal of natural organic matter using commercial flocculants and UV/H2O2, UV/O3 and UV/H2O2/O3 processes was determined under acidic conditions. For each of these processes, different operational conditions were explored to optimize the treatment efficiency of the coffee wastewater. Coffee wastewater is characterized by a high chemical oxygen demand (COD) and low total suspended solids. The outcomes of coffee wastewater treatment using coagulation-flocculation and photodegradation processes were assessed in terms of reduction of COD, color, and turbidity. It was found that a reduction in COD of 67% could be realized when the coffee wastewater was treated by chemical coagulation-flocculation with lime and coagulant T-1. When coffee wastewater was treated by coagulation-flocculation in combination with UV/H2O2, a COD reduction of 86% was achieved, although only after prolonged UV irradiation. Of the three advanced oxidation processes considered, UV/H2O2, UV/O3 and UV/H2O2/O3, we found that the treatment with UV/H2O2/O3 was the most effective, with an efficiency of color, turbidity and further COD removal of 87%, when applied to the flocculated coffee wastewater.",M1

Most isolates of A. westerdijkiae are able to produce large amounts of a mycotoxin called ochratoxin A (OA). OA has been found in food and beverages, such as coffee. A. westerdijkiae is very similar to A. ochraceus, and several isolates previously identified as A. ochraceus are now identified as A. westerdijkiae. By using sequences of the beta-tubulin gene, we analyzed several isolates from Brazilian coffee bean samples, previously identified as A. ochraceus, to compare with those of A. westerdijkiae. In fact, most (84%) were identified as A. westerdijkiae. Since this species consistently produces large amounts of OA, we developed a specific primer-pair for detecting and quantifying it in coffee beans by using real-time PCR. The primers Bt2Aw-F 5'TGATACCTTGGCGCTTGTGACG and Bt2Aw-R 5'CGGAAGCCTAAAAAATGAAGAG provided an amplicon of 347 bp in all A. westerdijkiae isolates, and no cross-reaction was observed using DNA from A. ochraceus.

Three Aspergillus niger, three A. awamori and one A. carbonarius isolates examined showed optimum a(W) level for growth at 0.97 with optimal temperature of 30 degrees C. for most of the isolates and 25 degrees C for only one (A. awamori RCP176). Minimal a(W) for growth was 0.85 at the highest temperature tested. Overall growth was reduced up to 50% at 0.93 a(W). Growth was also to a large extend inhibited at 0.85 a(W) for most isolates even after 21 days of incubation at temperatures lower than 30 degrees C. The analysis of variance of the effect of single (isolate, a(W) and temperature), two- and three-way interaction showed that all factors alone and all interactions were statistically significant (P&lt;0.001) in relation to growth rates and lag phase for A. niger, A. awamori and A. carbonarius isolates.

17893739,"Use of fluorescence in situ hybridization as a tool for introgression analysis and chromosome identification in <e>coffee</e> (Coffea arabica L.).Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was used to study the presence of alien chromatin in interspecific hybrids and one introgressed line (S.288) derived from crosses between the cultivated species Coffea arabica and the diploid relatives C. canephora and C. liberica. In situ hybridization using genomic DNA from C. canephora and C. arabica as probes showed elevated cross hybridization along the hybrid genome, confirming the weak differentiation between parental genomes. According to our genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) data, the observed genomic resemblance between the modern C. canephora genome (C) and the C. canephora-derived subgenome of C. arabica (Ca) appears rather considerable. Poor discrimination between C and Ca chromosomes supports the idea of low structural modifications of both genomes since the C. arabica speciation, at least in the frequency and distribution of repetitive sequences. GISH was also used to identify alien chromatin segments on chromosome spreads of a C. liberica-introgressed line of C. arabica. Further, use of GISH together with BAC-FISH analysis gave us additional valuable information about the physical localization of the C. liberica fragments carrying the SH3 factor involved in resistance to the coffee leaf rust. Overall, our results illustrate that FISH analysis is a complementary tool for molecular cytogenetic studies in coffee, providing rapid localization of either specific chromosomes or alien chromatin in introgressed genotypes derived from diploid species displaying substantial genomic differentiation from C. arabica.",M1

17855380,"Mechanism and control of Solanum lycocarpum seed germination.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Solanaceae seed morphology and physiology have been widely studied but mainly in domesticated crops. The present study aimed to compare the seed morphology and the physiology of germination of Solanum lycocarpum, an important species native to the Brazilian Cerrado, with two species with endospermic seeds, tomato and <e>coffee</e>. METHODS: Morphological parameters of fruits and seeds were determined by microscopy. Germination was monitored for 40 d under different temperature regimes. Endosperm digestion and resistance, with endo-beta-mannanase activity and required force to puncture the endosperm cap as respective markers, were measured during germination in water and in abscisic acid. KEY RESULTS: Fruits of S. lycocarpum contain dormant seeds before natural dispersion. The best germination condition found was a 12-h alternating light/dark and high/low (20/30 degrees C) temperature cycle, which seemed to target properties of the endosperm cap. The endosperm cap contains 7-8 layers of elongated polygonal cells and is predestined to facilitate radicle protrusion. The force required to puncture the endosperm cap decreased in two stages during germination and showed a significant negative correlation with endo-beta-mannanase activity. As a result of the thick endosperm cap, the puncture force was significantly higher in S. lycocarpum than in tomato and coffee. Endo-beta-mannanase activity was detected in the endosperm cap prior to radicle protrusion. Abscisic acid inhibited germination, increase of embryo weight during imbibition, the second stage of weakening of the endosperm cap and of endo-beta-mannanase activity in the endosperm cap. CONCLUSIONS: The germination mechanism of S. lycocarpum bears resemblance to that of tomato and coffee seeds. However, quantitative differences were observed in embryo pressure potential, endo-beta-mannanase activity and endosperm cap resistance that were related to germination rates across the three species.",M1

B. bassiana infections were found during most sampling dates in both years, on all three farms. The B. bassiana infection levels were higher in 2005 than in 2004 with mean prevalence of 12.1% and 2.7%, respectively. No consistent significant differences in infection level between farms were found in any of the years. B. bassiana infection levels fluctuated widely throughout the season, and peaked at 13.5% on farm 3 in 2004 and at 44.0% on farm 1 in 2005. The H. hampei population was significantly higher in 2004 than in 2005, with 6.9% of the berries infested in 2004 and only 0.7% in 2005. In both years, the H. hampei infestation level was significantly higher on farm 2.

17848084,"Lipoxygenase distribution in <e>coffee</e> (Coffea arabica L.) berries.In this paper lipoxygenase (LOX) presence was investigated in coffee berries to determine its involvement in lipid degradative metabolism of plants grown in organic and conventional cultivations. An immunochemical analysis has evidenced a ca. 80 kDa protein, cross-reacting with an anti-LOX antibody, only in the pulp fraction of berries obtained from plants of both cultivations. LOX activity in this fraction could be monitored either as conjugated diene formation or reaction products (determined by HPLC) and was mainly associated with a heavy membrane fraction (HMF, enriched in tonoplast, endoplasmic reticulum, plasma membrane, and mitochondria) and a light membrane fraction (LMF, enriched in plasma membrane and endoplasmic reticulum, with low levels of tonoplast and mitochondria). The LOX activity of LMF from berries of both cultivations showed an optimum at pH 8.0. The HMF exhibited a different activity peak in samples from conventional (pH 8.0) and organic (pH 5.5) cultures, suggesting the presence of different isoenzymes. These findings were also confirmed by variation of the ratio of 9- and 13-hydroperoxides in organic (1:1) and conventional cultivations (1:10), indicating that the organic one was subjected to an oxidative stress in the coffee pulp fraction leading to the expression of an acidic LOX. Such de novo synthesized LOX activity could be responsible for the production of secondary metabolites, which may interfere with the organoleptic profile of coffee.",M1

This knowledge will help in mass rearing, as well as support the development of behavioral control techniques for this insect. The purpose of the study was to determine the periodicity of mating and male capture and describe the mating behavior L. coffeella. In laboratory, we observed the periodicity of mating with virgin couples of different ages, zero to five days after emergence. Male activity was studied in a 0.7 ha coffee plantation, cv. CatuaÃ­, where Delta traps were installed at 0.5 m above ground, using either virgin females or rubber septa lured with the synthetic sex pheromone. The sequence of mating behavior was studied by making visual observations and recorded of pairs placed on individual plastic tubes. Mating occurred between 4h and 6h of photophase, when the highest frequencies involved pairs with ages of one and three days after emergence, with peak of mating occurring in 5th hour of photophase. The young or old pairs showed significantly copulation frequency and the peak of matings advance in 1h. The highest male capture occurred at 12p.m. and 13 p.m. by traps with virgin females or traps with synthetic sex pheromone lures, respectively. L. coffeella is one insect with diurnal mating and the mating behavior was not different from what is know for other Lepidoptera species.",M1
17696359,"Use of near-infrared spectroscopy and feature selection techniques for predicting the caffeine content and roasting color in roasted <e>coffees</e>.Near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS), combined with diverse feature selection techniques and multivariate calibration methods, has been used to develop robust and reliable reduced-spectrum regression models based on a few NIR filter sensors for determining two key parameters for the characterization of roasted coffees, which are extremely relevant from a quality assurance standpoint: roasting color and caffeine content. The application of the stepwise orthogonalization of predictors (an  old  technique recently revisited, known by the acronym SELECT) provided notably improved regression models for the two response variables modeled, with root-mean-square errors of the residuals in external prediction (RMSEP) equal to 3.68 and 1.46% for roasting color and caffeine content of roasted coffee samples, respectively. The improvement achieved by the application of the SELECT-OLS method was particularly remarkable when the very low complexities associated with the final models obtained for predicting both roasting color (only 9 selected wavelengths) and caffeine content (17 significant wavelengths) were taken into account. The simple and reliable calibration models proposed in the present study encourage the possibility of implementing them in online and routine applications to predict quality parameters of unknown coffee samples via their NIR spectra, thanks to the use of a NIR instrument equipped with a proper filter system, which would imply a considerable simplification with regard to the recording and interpretation of the spectra, as well as an important economic saving.",M1
17645824,"Seasonal mortality factors of the <e>coffee</e> leafminer, Leucoptera coffeella.Seasonal population fluctuation of the coffee leafminer, Leucoptera coffeella (GuÃ©rin-MÃ©neville &amp; Perrottet) (Lepidoptera: Lyonetiidae), led to an investigation of its natural mortality factors during the rainy season when the population level is low and during the dry season when population peaks occur. Life-table data were collected from insecticide-free plots within a 3 ha coffee plantation on the upper, medium and lower canopy. Leafminer mortality was similar among the canopy parts but varied in the two seasons studied. During the rainy season, the generational mortality averaged 94.3%, with 50.2, 33.7 and 10.4% occurring during egg, larval and pupal stages, respectively. During the dry season, total mortality was 89%, with 13.2, 61.0 and 14.8% occurring during egg, larval and pupal stages, respectively. Marginal mortality rates during the rainy season were highest for physiological disturbances, rainfall and egg inviability; but, in the dry season, they were highest for predaceous wasps, physiological disturbances and parasitoids. Egg and larval stages accounted for most of the mortality variation in the rainy season, while the combination of larval and pupal mortality better described the generational mortality in the dry season. Variation in mortality during the rainy season was primarily associated with egg inviability, rainfall and parasitoids. In contrast, predatory wasps and physiological disturbances were the main factors associated with mortality variation during the dry season. These results suggest that weather conditions, natural enemies and plant quality attributes are the main determinants of the population dynamics of L. coffeella.",M1
17616133,"Influence of water quench cooling on degassing and aroma stability of roasted <e>coffee</e>.Coffee roasting experiments with air cooling versus water quench cooling were carried out on laboratory scale with a fluidized-bed hot air roasting system (200 g batch size) and on production scale with a rotating bowl roaster (320 kg batch size). Two series of coffees with different water contents resulted, which were stored at 25 degrees C under normal atmospheric conditions. Carbon dioxide desorption was followed and stability of selected aroma compounds was tested with headspace solid-phase microextraction-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (SPME-GC-MS) and stable isotope labeled compounds as internal standards. Degassing is faster in water-quenched coffees with higher moisture content, but pore size distribution in the different coffee samples did not correlate with degassing behavior. Bean firmness, which increases with increasing moisture content, might have an influence on degassing. Air- and water-quenched coffees exhibit similar stability of most aroma compounds despite different degassing behavior. However, evolution of dimethyl trisulfide was different in coffees with increased water content. This suggests higher thiol oxidation rates, a factor that is cited to be related to a faster loss of freshness attributes.",M1
17607463,"Life history of Amblyseius herbicolus (Chant) (Acari: Phytoseiidae) on <e>coffee</e> plants.The predaceous mite Amblyseius herbicolus (Chant) is the second most abundant phytoseiid on coffee plants (Coffea arabica L), after Euseius alatus DeLeon, in Lavras, MG, Brazil, associated to the vector of the coffee ring spot virus, Brevipalpus phoenicis (Geijskes) (Acari: Tenuipalpidae). Its life history was studied taking into account biological aspects, life table, predatory activity and functional and numerical responses in relation to the density of the prey. The adult female has longevity of 38 days when supplied with B. phoenicis. The intrinsic rate of population increase (r m) was 0.150 and the mean generation time (T) 25.3 days. The population doubles every 4.6 days. Thirty mites B. phoenicis /3-cm diameter coffee leaf arenas were separately offered to one specimen of each predator phase. Adult females were more efficient in killing all developmental phases of B. phoenicis, followed by the nymph stages. For the functional and numerical responses studies, from 0.14 to 42.3 immature specimens of the prey /cm(2) of arena were submitted to the predator, the preferred phase for predation. Predation and the oviposition of A. herbicolus increased with increasing prey density, with a positive and highly significant correlation. Regression analysis suggests a functional type II response, with a maximum daily predation near 35 B. phoenicis /cm(2) /one adult female.",M1

20533628,"In vitro assessment of chemical activation efficiency during in-office dental bleaching.PURPOSE: This study compared five types of chemical catalyzing agents added to 35% hydrogen peroxide gel, with regard to their capacity of intensifying in-office dental bleaching results. METHODS: One-hundred and twenty bovine incisors were used, of which the crowns and roots were cut in the incisor-apical direction, to acquire the dimensions of a human central incisor. The specimens were sectioned in the mesiodistal direction by means of two longitudinal cuts, the lingual halves being discarded. The vestibular halves received prophylaxis with a bicarbonate jet, ultrasound cleaning and acid etching on the dentinal portion. Next, the specimens were stored in receptacles containing a 25% instant <e>coffee</e> solution for two weeks. After the darkening period, initial measurement of the shade obtained was taken with the Easy Shade appliance, which allowed it to be quantified by the CIELab method. The samples were divided into six groups, corresponding to the chemical activator used: a) none (CON); b) ferric chloride (CF); c) ferrous sulphate (SF); d) manganese gluconate (GM); e) manganese chloride (CM); f) mulberry root extract (RA). Each group received three 10-minute applications of the gels containing the respective activating agents. Next, a new shade measurement was made. RESULTS: The Analysis of Variance and Tukey tests (alpha = 5%) showed statistically significant differences for the shade perception values (p = 0.002). Groups GM, CM and RA showed significantly higher means than the control group. CONCLUSION: The presence of some chemical activators is capable of resulting in a significant increase in tooth shade variation.",M2
20469646,"Essential region for 3-N methylation in N-methyltransferases involved in caffeine biosynthesis.The caffeine biosynthetic pathway is composed of three methylation steps, and N-methyltransferase catalyzing each step has high substrate specificity. Since the amino acid sequences among <e>coffee</e> 7-methylxanthosine synthase (CmXRS1), theobromine synthase, and caffeine synthase are highly homologous to each other, these substrate specificities seem to be determined in a very restricted region. The analysis of site-directed mutants for CmXRS1 that naturally acts at the initial step, i.e., 7-N methylation of xanthosine, revealed that the activity of 3-N methylation needs a histidine residue at corresponding position 161 in the CmXRS1 sequence.

20453203,"Risk of colon cancer and <e>coffee</e>, tea, and sugar-sweetened soft drink intake: pooled analysis of prospective cohort studies.BACKGROUND: The relationships between coffee, tea, and sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drink consumption and colon cancer risk remain unresolved. METHODS: We investigated prospectively the association between coffee, tea, and sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drink consumption and colon cancer risk in a pooled analysis of primary data from 13 cohort studies. Among 731 441 participants followed for up to 6-20 years, 5604 incident colon cancer case patients were identified. Study-specific relative risks (RRs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were estimated using Cox proportional hazards models and then pooled using a random-effects model. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: Compared with nonconsumers, the pooled multivariable relative risks were 1.07 (95% CI = 0.89 to 1.30, P(trend) = .68) for coffee consumption greater than 1400 g/d (about six 8-oz cups) and 1.28 (95% CI = 1.02 to 1.61, P(trend) = .01) for tea consumption greater than 900 g/d (about four 8-oz cups). For sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drink consumption, the pooled multivariable relative risk comparing consumption greater than 550 g/d (about 18 oz) to nonconsumers was 0.94 (95% CI = 0.66 to 1.32, P(trend) = .91). No statistically significant between-studies heterogeneity was observed for the highest category of each beverage consumed (P &gt; .20). The observed associations did not differ by sex, smoking status, alcohol consumption, body mass index, physical activity, or tumor site (P &gt; .05). CONCLUSIONS: Drinking coffee or sugar-sweetened carbonated soft drinks was not associated with colon cancer risk. However, a modest positive association with higher tea consumption is possible and requires further study.",M2

METHODS: Three resin nanocomposites (Ceram X, Grandio, and Filtek Z350) were light cured for 40 seconds at a light intensity of 1000 mW/cm2. The color of the specimens was measured in %R (reflectance) mode before and after immersing the specimens in four different test solutions [distilled water (DW), <e>coffee</e> (CF), 50% ethanol (50ET) and brewed green tea (GT)] for 7 hours/day over a 3-week period. The color difference (deltaE*) was obtained based on the CIEL*a*b* color coordinate values. RESULTS: The specimens immersed in DW, 50ET and GT showed a slight increase in L* value. However, the samples immersed in CF showed a decrease in the L* value and an increase in the b* value. CF induced a significant color change (deltaE*: 3.1-5.6) in most specimens but the other solutions induced only a slight color change. Overall, coffee caused unacceptable color changes to the resin nanocomposites.",M2

The effect of caffeine intake during pregnancy on fetal growth and development is still unclear. OBJECTIVE: We examined the associations of maternal caffeine intake, on the basis of coffee and tea consumption, with fetal growth characteristics measured in each trimester of pregnancy and the risks of adverse birth outcomes. DESIGN: Associations were studied in 7346 pregnant women participating in a population-based prospective cohort study from early pregnancy onward in the Netherlands (2001-2005). Caffeine intake in the first, second, and third trimesters was on the basis of coffee and tea consumption and was assessed by questionnaires. Fetal growth characteristics were repeatedly measured by ultrasound. Information about birth outcomes was obtained from hospital records. RESULTS: We observed no consistent associations of caffeine intake with fetal head circumference or estimated fetal weight in any trimester. Higher caffeine intake was associated with smaller first-trimester crown-rump length, second- and third-trimester femur length, and birth length (P for trend &lt;0.05). Offspring of mothers who consumed &gt; or =6 caffeine units/d tended to have increased risks of small-for-gestational-age infants at birth. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that caffeine intake of &gt; or =6 units/d during pregnancy is associated with impaired fetal length growth. Caffeine exposure might preferentially adversely affect fetal skeletal growth. Further studies are needed to assess these associations in non-European populations and to assess the postnatal consequences.",M2

Here, we report that coffee and tobacco, but not caffeine or nicotine, are neuroprotective in fly PD models. We further report that decaffeinated coffee and nicotine-free tobacco are as neuroprotective as their caffeine and nicotine-containing counterparts and that the neuroprotective effects of decaffeinated coffee and nicotine-free tobacco are also evident in Drosophila models of Alzheimer's disease and polyglutamine disease. Finally, we report that the neuroprotective effects of decaffeinated coffee and nicotine-free tobacco require the cytoprotective transcription factor Nrf2 and that a known Nrf2 activator in coffee, cafestol, is also able to confer neuroprotection in our fly models of PD. Our findings indicate that coffee and tobacco contain Nrf2-activating compounds that may account for the reduced risk of PD among coffee and tobacco users. These compounds represent attractive candidates for therapeutic intervention in PD and perhaps other neurodegenerative diseases.",M2
20403343,"The <e>coffee</e> diterpene kahweol sensitizes TRAIL-induced apoptosis in renal carcinoma Caki cells through down-regulation of Bcl-2 and c-FLIP.Kahweol, a coffee-specific diterpene, found in the beans of Coffea arabica, has potent anti-carcinogenic, anti-tumor, and anti-inflammatory properties. TRAIL is a potential anti-cancer compound that induces apoptosis in a wide variety of cancer cells, but not in most normal human cell types. In the present study, we show that kahweol sensitizes human renal cancer cells, but not normal human mesangial cells, to TRAIL-mediated apoptosis. Moreover, treatment with a combination of kahweol and TRAIL induces significant apoptosis in various cancer cell types, thus presenting an attractive novel strategy for cancer treatment. Our experiments show that treatment with a combination of kahweol and TRAIL-induced apoptosis, and stimulated of DEVDase activity, DNA fragmentation, and cleavage of PARP, which was prevented by pretreatment with z-VAD, indicative of cell death via a caspase-dependent pathway. Kahweol-induced down-regulation of Bcl-2 and ectopic expression of Bcl-2 led to attenuation of kahweol plus TRAIL-mediated apoptosis, indicative of Bcl-2 involvement in the apoptotic process. In addition, the c-FLIP and caspase signal pathways seem to play a crucial role in apoptosis triggered by the combination of kahweol and TRAIL in Caki cells. Our results collectively demonstrate that down-regulation of Bcl-2 and c-FLIP contributes to the sensitizing effect of kahweol on TRAIL-mediated apoptosis in cancer cells.",M2
20361473,"Gerson regimen.The Gerson regimen, developed by Max Gerson in the 1930s, is promoted as an alternative cancer treatment. It involves consuming fresh, raw fruit and vegetable juices, eliminating salt from the diet, taking supplements such as potassium, vitamin B12, thyroid hormone, pancreatic enzymes, and detoxifying liver with <e>coffee</e> enemas to stimulate metabolism. Gerson therapy is based on the theory that cancer is caused by alteration of cell metabolism by toxic environmental substances and processed food, which changes its sodium and potassium content. It emphasizes increasing potassium intake and minimizing sodium consumption in an effort to correct the electrolyte imbalance, repair tissue, and detoxify the liver. The coffee enemas are believed to cause dilation of bile ducts and excretion of toxic breakdown products by the liver and through the colon wall. None of these theories has been substantiated by scientific research. Despite proponents' claims of recovery rates as high as 70% to 90%, case reviews by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) and the New York County Medical Society found no evidence of usefulness for the Gerson diet. An NCI-sponsored study of Gonzalez therapy, which is similar to the Gerson diet, showed that patients with inoperable pancreatic adenocarcinoma who underwent standard chemotherapy with gemcitabine (Gemzar) survived three times longer and had better quality of life than those who chose enzyme treatment, which included pancreatic enzymes, nutritional supplements, detoxification, and an organic diet.",M2
20358471,"Effect of <e>coffee</e> on chemical hepatocarcinogenesis in rats.The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of daily coffee ingestion on hepatocarcinogenesis in rats submitted to the resistant hepatocyte (RH) model. During lactation, the dams were fed a control or a coffee-supplemented diet. After weaning, male pups followed the same dietary protocol and were submitted to the RH model. The animals were sacrificed at 110 days of life. Removal of the medial and left lateral lobes was used as mitogenic stimulus, and the liver regeneration was estimated. Morphometric analyses of preneoplastic lesions were carried out on liver histological sections submitted to the histochemical procedure of the glucose-6-phosphatase activity. The gamma-glutamyltranspeptidase (GGT) activity was analyzed in the homogenate of regenerated livers. Body weight, mass liver regeneration, and hepatic cell architecture were not affected by coffee ingestion. In the group of animals fed the coffee-supplemented diet, the number of persistent and remodeling nodules was reduced (85.5% and 70.5%, respectively). The hepatic area occupied by the persistent nodules was also reduced (92%).

20358468,"Fluid intake and colorectal cancer risk in the Netherlands Cohort Study.Total fluid intake, specifically water intake, has been suggested to protect against colorectal cancer. We examined the association of total fluid intake with colorectal cancer endpoints and possible effect modification by fiber intake within the Netherlands Cohort Study (N = 120,852). We also investigated intake of specific beverages. After 13.3 yr, 1,443 male and 1,040 female colorectal cancer cases with complete baseline questionnaires were available for case-cohort analyses. Multivariate analyses showed no dose-response relationship of total fluid intake and intake of specific beverages with the risk of overall colorectal, proximal, and distal colon cancer. For rectal cancer risk in men, there was a nonsignificant positive trend for total fluid intake [&gt; 1,500 vs. &lt;/= 1,000 ml/day: HR = 1.50, 95% CI = 0.95-2.37, P trend = 0.08) and a significant positive trend for <e>coffee</e> intake (&gt; 6 vs. &lt;/= 2 cups/day: HR = 1.60, 95% CI = 0.96-2.66, P trend = 0.05).

To address this need, this review summarized the findings of the meta analyses and recent papers on site-specific human cancers among coffee consumers. For hepatocellular and endometrial cancers, there appears to be a strong and consistent protective association; for colorectal cancer, the direction of association is borderline protective. There appears to be no association with breast, pancreatic, kidney, ovarian, prostate, or gastric cancer.

20345478,"Insulin resistance and cancer: epidemiological evidence.Over the last 60 years, Japanese people have experienced a rapid and drastic change in lifestyle, including diet. Suspicions have been raised that so-called 'Westernization', characterized by a high-calorie diet and physical inactivity, is associated with increasing trends in the incidence of cancer of the colon, liver, pancreas, prostate, and breast, as well as type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological evidence from our prospective study, the Japan Public Health Center-based Prospective (JPHC) study, and systematic literature reviews generally support the idea that factors related to diabetes or insulin resistance are associated with an increased risk of colon (mostly in men), liver, and pancreatic cancers. These cancers are inversely associated with physical activity and <e>coffee</e> consumption, which are known to decrease the risk of type 2 diabetes. The suggested mechanism of these effects is that insulin resistance and the resulting chronic hyperinsulinemia and increase in bioavailable insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) stimulate tumor growth. In contrast, associations with diabetes are less clear for cancer of the colon in women, and breast and prostate, which are known to be related to sex hormones. The effect of insulin resistance or body fat on sex-hormone production and bioavailability may modify their carcinogenic effect differently from cancers of the colon in men, and liver and pancreas. In conclusion, there is substantial evidence to show that cancers of the colon, liver, and pancreas are associated with insulin resistance, and that these cancers can be prevented by increasing physical activity, and possibly coffee consumption.",M2

They reviewed medical records for children in the Danish National Birth Cohort identified through national registers as possibly having strabismus. Relative risk estimates were adjusted for year of birth, social class, maternal smoking, maternal age at birth, and maternal coffee and tea consumption. The authors identified 1,321 cases of strabismus in a cohort of 96,842 Danish children born between 1996 and 2003. Maternal smoking was associated with a significantly elevated risk of strabismus in the child, increasing with number of cigarettes smoked per day (&lt;5 cigarettes/day: relative risk (RR) = 0.95, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80, 1.14; 5-&lt;10 cigarettes/day: RR = 1.38, 95% CI: 1.12, 1.70; &gt; or =10 cigarettes/day: RR = 1.90, 95% CI: 1.57, 2.30).

In conclusion, smoking during pregnancy is associated with an increased risk of strabismus in the offspring. Conversely, light alcohol consumption is associated with decreased risk.",M2
20338280,"Girls' early sweetened carbonated beverage intake predicts different patterns of beverage and nutrient intake across childhood and adolescence.BACKGROUND: Information is limited on persistence of early beverage patterns throughout childhood and adolescence and their influence on long-term dietary intake. OBJECTIVE: To describe changes in beverage intake during childhood and assess beverage and nutrient intake from ages 5 to 15 years among girls who were consuming or not consuming sweetened carbonated beverages (soda) at age 5 years. DESIGN/SUBJECTS: Participants were part of a longitudinal study of non-Hispanic white girls and their parents (n=170) assessed biennially from age 5 to 15 years starting fall 1996. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: At each assessment, intakes of beverages (milk, fruit juice, fruit drinks, soda, and tea/<e>coffee</e>), energy, macronutrients, and micronutrients were assessed using three 24-hour recalls. Analyses of longitudinal changes and the interaction between beverage type and age were conducted using a mixed modeling approach. Girls were categorized as either soda consumers or nonconsumers at age 5 years. A mixed modeling approach was used to assess longitudinal differences and patterns of change in beverage and nutrient intake between soda consumption groups. RESULTS: Early differences in soda intake were predictive of later soda and milk intake and of differences in selected nutrients. Relative to girls who were not consuming soda beverages at age 5 years, soda consumers at age 5 years had higher subsequent soda intake, lower milk intake, higher intake of added sugars, lower protein, fiber, vitamin D, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and potassium from ages 5 to 15 years. CONCLUSIONS: Soda consumption at age 5 years predicted patterns of nutrient intake that persisted during childhood and into adolescence. Diets of soda consumers were higher in added sugars and lower in protein, fiber, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium, phosphorous, and potassium. Findings provide a more complex picture regarding the emergence of early beverage patterns and their predictive effects on nutrient intake across childhood and adolescence.",M2

However, the conclusion of its relation with mortality has not yet been reached. In this study, we aimed to investigate the associations between coffee consumption and all-cause and cause-specific mortality in Japan. We included 37,742 participants (18,287 men and 19,455 women) aged 40-64 y without a history of cancer, myocardial infarction, or stroke at baseline in our analysis, based on the Miyagi Cohort Study initiated in 1990. The outcomes were mortality due to all causes, cardiovascular disease (CVD), and cancer. During the 10.3 y of follow-up, 2454 participants died, including 426 due to CVD and 724 due to cancer. In women, the multivariate hazard ratios (HR) (95% CI) for all-cause mortality in participants who drank coffee never, occasionally, 1-2 cups (150-300 mL)/d, and &gt; or =3 cups/d were 1.00, 0.88 (0.73-1.06), 0.82 (0.66-1.02), and 0.75 (0.53-1.05), respectively (P-trend = 0.04). For CVD mortality in women, the multivariate HR (95% CI) were 1.00, 0.56 (0.36-0.86), 0.48 (0.29-0.80), and 0.45 (0.20-1.03), respectively (P-trend = 0.006). Of the specific CVD diseases, there was a strong inverse association between coffee consumption and mortality due to coronary heart disease (CHD) in women (P-trend = 0.02) but not in men. Death due to cancer was not associated with coffee consumption in either men or women, except for colorectal cancer in women.

Study participants aged 4-10 years included 17 children whose parents worked in La Amistad organic coffee plantation and 18 Las Mellizas children whose parents worked in their own small conventional coffee farms. Two spot-urine samples were collected from each participant and analyzed for organophosphorus and pyrethroids pesticide metabolites. We administered the computerized Behavioral Assessment and Research System (BARS), a figure-drawing task, and a long-term memory test to evaluate study participant's cognitive development. Although urinary pesticide metabolite levels did not vary considerably between these two groups of children, we found that Las Mellizas children performed better in BARS and the figure drawing tests than did La Amistad. The results from the linear mixed-effects models suggested that family socioeconomic status (SES) might be a significant contributor to the variation of the outcomes of the neurobehavioral tests. The effect of pesticide exposure, however, as measured in a snapshot fashion, did not play a significant role to the performance of the cognitive development evaluation. Regardless of the study limitations, needed effort should be devoted to the improvement of the SES on the La Amistad families so that their children's cognitive development would not be compromised further. Additionally, future studies should focus on addressing the limitations imposed on the snapshot assessment of pesticide exposure and on conducting cognitive development evaluation so the link between childhood pesticide exposure and their cognitive development can be thoroughly investigated.",M2

Species of Phytoseiidae acari are considered the most important and studied predatory mites. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of the webbing produced by O.ilicis on its predation by females of the phytoseiids Iphiseiodes zuluagai Denmark &amp; Muma, Euseius citrifolius Denmark &amp; Muma and Amblyseius herbicolus (Chant). Four bioassays were conducted, with three treatments and ten replicates. Each replicate consisted of 25 O.ilicis per experimental unit (a leaf disc of Coffea arabica) according to the tested developmental stage, in independent experiments. To spin the web, 15 adult females were put on each experimental unit for 24h; females were then removed, leaving only the web, and predators and prey to be tested were introduced. Predation was assessed after 24h. In the presence of webbing, the consumption of eggs, larvae and nymphs by I.zuluagai and eggs and larvae by E.citrifolius was lower. For A.herbicolus, egg predation was lower, but larval predation did not vary significantly and predation of nymphs and adults was higher in the presence of webbing. Predators as a whole were more efficient consuming larvae regardless of the presence of webbing. Considering the stages of O.ilicis altogether, webbing reduced the predation potential of I.zuluagai and E. citrifolius, but not of A. herbicolus.",M2

In the case of women (total: 345,184 subjects) the protective effect of caffeine is only observed in menopausal women which do not receive estrogen replacement therapy. Studies with models of acute parkinsonism in rodents have shown that caffeine reduces the loss of nigrostriatal dopaminergic neurons induced with the neurotoxins 6-hidroxidopamine and 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine, effect that seems to be mediated through blockade of A(2A) adenosine receptors. Recently, it was shown that male rats treated with moderate doses of caffeine (5 mg/kg/day) during six months, followed by a withdrawal period of at least two weeks, developed a greater resistance to the catalepsy induced with the dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol, which was possibly mediated by an increase of dopaminergic transmission in the corpus striatum. CONCLUSIONS: More studies are needed to demonstrate unequivocally that caffeine prevents the degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in animal models of moderate, chronic, and progressive parkinsonism, since it could lead to the discovery of more effective drugs for the prevention of aging-related degenerative diseases of the central nervous system.",M2
20191874,"[Aflatoxin contamination of food: additional risk factor for chronic liver diseases]Aflatoxins are over all spread toxic metabolites of fungi, able to induce chronic liver damages. AIM: To establish the correlation between the degree of liver disease and risk of chronic intake of aflatoxin contaminated foods. MATERIAL AND METHOD: 123 patients divided in three groups (controls, chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis) completed a food frequency questionaire (FFQ) estimating the intake risk of foods with a high potential of contamination with aflatoxins and alcohol consumption. RESULTS: Frequent intake of high risk foodstuff was declared by 37% of the participants, without any differences between the three groups. Foods with a very high risk of contamination were more frequently consumed in rural areas (predominant maize and oily seeds), while in the urban areas spices and <e>coffee</e> prevailed. In countryside, the feeding risk decreased with the gravity of liver disease, but alcohol consumption was significantly greater. CONCLUSION: FFQ revealed a high risk of ingestion of aflatoxin contaminated foodstuff in general population, greater in rural areas. The risk of aflatoxin intake seems unreleated with the gravity of chronic liver disease.",M2
20181814,"Effects of <e>coffee</e> consumption on subclinical inflammation and other risk factors for type 2 diabetes: a clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Coffee consumption is associated with a decreased risk of type 2 diabetes. Suggested mechanisms underlying the association have included attenuation of subclinical inflammation and a reduction in oxidative stress. OBJECTIVE: The aim was to investigate the effects of daily coffee consumption on biomarkers of coffee intake, subclinical inflammation, oxidative stress, glucose, and lipid metabolism. DESIGN: Habitual coffee drinkers (n = 47) refrained for 1 mo from coffee drinking; in the second month they consumed 4 cups of filtered coffee/d and in the third month 8 cups of filtered coffee/d (150 mL/cup). Blood samples were analyzed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, bead-based multiplex technology, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, or immunonephelometry. RESULTS: Coffee consumption led to an increase in coffee-derived compounds, mainly serum caffeine, chlorogenic acid, and caffeic acid metabolites. Significant changes were also observed for serum concentrations of interleukin-18, 8-isoprostane, and adiponectin (medians: -8%, -16%, and 6%, respectively; consumption of 8 compared with 0 cups coffee/d). Serum concentrations of total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, and apolipoprotein A-I increased significantly by 12%, 7%, and 4%, respectively, whereas the ratios of LDL to HDL cholesterol and of apolipoprotein B to apolipoprotein A-I decreased significantly by 8% and 9%, respectively (8 compared with 0 cups coffee/d). No changes were seen for markers of glucose metabolism in an oral-glucose-tolerance test. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee consumption appears to have beneficial effects on subclinical inflammation and HDL cholesterol, whereas no changes in glucose metabolism were found in our study. Furthermore, many coffee-derived methylxanthines and caffeic acid metabolites appear to be useful as biomarkers of coffee intake.",M2

20147471,"Differential effects of <e>coffee</e> on the risk of type 2 diabetes according to meal consumption in a French cohort of women: the E3N/EPIC cohort study.BACKGROUND: Coffee consumption has been associated with a lower risk of diabetes, but little is known about the mechanisms responsible for this association, especially related to the time when coffee is consumed. OBJECTIVE: We examined the long-term effect of coffee, globally and according to the accompanying meal, and of tea, chicory, and caffeine on type 2 diabetes risk. DESIGN: This was a prospective cohort study including 69,532 French women, aged 41-72 y from the E3N/EPIC (Etude EpidÃ©miologique auprÃ¨s de Femmes de la Mutuelle GÃ©nÃ©rale de l'Education Nationale/European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition) cohort study, without diabetes at baseline. Food and drink intakes per meal were assessed by using a validated diet-history questionnaire in 1993-1995. RESULTS: During a mean follow-up of 11 y, 1415 new cases of diabetes were identified. In multivariable Cox regression models, the hazard ratio in the highest category of coffee consumption [&gt; or =3 cups (375 mL)/d] was 0.73 (95% CI: 0.61, 0.87; P for trend &lt; 0.001), in comparison with no coffee consumption. This inverse association was restricted to coffee consumed at lunchtime (hazard ratio: 0.66; 95% CI: 0.57, 0.76) when comparing &gt;1.1 cup (125 mL)/meal with no intake. At lunchtime, this inverse association was observed for both regular and decaffeinated coffee and for filtered and black coffee, with no effect of sweetening. Total caffeine intake was also associated with a statistically significantly lower risk of diabetes. Neither tea nor chicory consumption was associated with diabetes risk. CONCLUSIONS: Our data support an inverse association between coffee consumption and diabetes and suggest that the time of drinking coffee plays a distinct role in glucose metabolism.",M2
20143838,"Discrimination of complex mixtures by a colorimetric sensor array: <e>coffee</e> aromas.The analysis of complex mixtures presents a difficult challenge even for modern analytical techniques, and the ability to discriminate among closely similar such mixtures often remains problematic. Coffee provides a readily available archetype of such highly multicomponent systems. The use of a low-cost, sensitive colorimetric sensor array for the detection and identification of coffee aromas is reported. The color changes of the sensor array were used as a digital representation of the array response and analyzed with standard statistical methods, including principal component analysis (PCA) and hierarchical clustering analysis (HCA). PCA revealed that the sensor array has exceptionally high dimensionality with 18 dimensions required to define 90% of the total variance. In quintuplicate runs of 10 commercial coffees and controls, no confusions or errors in classification by HCA were observed in 55 trials. In addition, the effects of temperature and time in the roasting of green coffee beans were readily observed and distinguishable with a resolution better than 10 degrees C and 5 min, respectively. Colorimetric sensor arrays demonstrate excellent potential for complex systems analysis in real-world applications and provide a novel method for discrimination among closely similar complex mixtures.",M2
20141144,"Influence of brewing method and acidity regulators on the antioxidant capacity of <e>coffee</e> brews.The antioxidant capacity of coffee brews prepared with different coffeemakers (filter, plunger, mocha, and espresso) was measured by colorimetric (total phenolic compounds and ABTS) and electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy techniques (Fremy's salt and TEMPO). The mocha coffeemaker had the highest yield in coffee antioxidant extraction per gram of ground roasted coffee, but espresso coffee was richest in terms of antioxidant intake (per milliliter of coffee brew) followed by mocha, plunger, and filter. Both Folin-Ciocalteu (total phenolic compounds) and ABTS assays reacted with standard solutions of chlorogenic acids (CGA) and melanoidins (MO-Ala and MO-Gly). However, Fremy's salt was mainly scavenged by chlorogenic acids, whereas the stabilized radical TEMPO was effectively scavenged by melanoidins, but not by chlorogenic acids. Thus, ESR spectroscopy allows distinguishing between phenolic and nonphenolic antioxidants. Moreover, the addition of pH-regulator agents to coffee, such as sodium carbonate (75 ppm) and bicarbonate (75 ppm), to extend its shelf life, slightly increases the pH, modifying the antioxidant capacity in those coffee brews with the highest capacity (mocha and espresso).",M2
20138903,"The influence of beverage composition on delivery of phenolic compounds from <e>coffee</e> and tea.Epidemiological data suggest that consumption of coffee and tea is associated with a reduced risk of several chronic and degenerative diseases including cardiovascular disorders, diabetes, obesity and neurodegenerative disorders. Both coffee and tea are a rich source of phenolic compounds including chlorogenic acids in coffee; and flavan-3-ols as well as complex theaflavins and thearubigens in tea. Coffee and tea are two of the most commonly consumed beverages in the world and thus represent a significant opportunity to positively affect disease risk and outcomes globally. Central to this opportunity is a need to better understand factors that may affect the bioavailability of specific phenolic components from coffee and tea based beverages. An overview of the phenolic composition of coffee and tea is discussed in the context of how processing and composition might influence phenolic profiles and bioavailability of individual phenolic components. Specifically, the impact of beverage formulation, the extent and type of processing and the influence of digestion on stability, bioavailability and metabolism of bioactive phenolics from tea and coffee are discussed. The impact of co-formulation with ascorbic acid and other phytochemicals are discussed as strategies to improve absorption of these health promoting phytochemicals. A better understanding of how the beverage composition impacts phenolic profiles and their bioavailability is critical to development of beverage products designed to deliver specific health benefits.",M2
20131840,"Isoflavones in <e>coffee</e>: influence of species, roast degree, and brewing method.This paper reports the isoflavone contents of roasted coffee beans and brews, as influenced by coffee species, roast degree, and brewing procedure. Total isoflavone level is 6-fold higher in robusta coffees than in arabica ones, mainly due to formononetin. During roasting, the content of isoflavones decreases, whereas their extractability increases (especially for formononetin). Total isoflavones in espresso coffee (30 mL) varied from approximately 40 microg (100% arabica) to approximately 285 microg (100% robusta), with long espressos (70 mL) attaining more than double isoflavones of short ones (20 mL). Espressos (30 mL) prepared from commercial blends contained average amounts of 6, 17, and 78 microg of genistein, daidzein, and formononetin, respectively. Comparison of different brewing methods revealed that espresso contained more isoflavones ( approximately 170 microg/30 mL) than a cup of press-pot coffee ( approximately 130 microg/60 mL), less than a mocha coffee ( approximately 360 microg/60 mL), and amounts similar to those of a filtered coffee cup ( approximately 180 microg/120 mL).",M2

20127052,"Antiviral effect of pyridinium formate, a novel component of <e>coffee</e> extracts.N-methyl-pyridinium formate, a novel component of coffee extracts, inhibited the multiplication of both DNA and RNA viruses. In the presence of the compound, the progeny viral yields of both herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and poliovirus in HEp-2 cells and those of influenza virus type A in MDCK cells decreased with increasing concentrations of the compound, although the degree of viral sensitivity to this compound differed. In addition, none of these viruses were directly inactivated by the compound at the concentrations tested. Characterization of the mode of action of this compound against HSV-1 multiplication revealed that it inhibits the viral growth primarily at the initial step of virus multiplication, i.e., within 2 h after the onset of multiplication, although the virus multiplication was affected by the compound throughout the multiplication cycle. In addition, this compound showed a significant cytotoxic effect, although the observed antiviral effect was unlikely to be attributed to the cytotoxic effect.",M2
20088510,"Identification of metabolites in human plasma and urine after consumption of a polyphenol-rich juice drink.A polyphenol-rich (P-R) juice drink was developed as a potential approach to increase intake of dietary polyphenols. Analysis of the beverage by HPLC with PDA, fluorescence, and MS detection facilitated the identification/partial identification of 40 flavonoids and related phenolic compounds. The main constituents were (-)-epigallocatechin and other green tea flavan-3-ols, phloretin-2'-O-glucoside, gallic acid, hesperetin-7-O-rutinoside, 5-O-caffeoylquinic acid, and procyanidins, with trace levels of several flavonols and purple grape juice anthocyanins also being present. Healthy human subjects (n = 10) consumed 350 mL of the P-R juice drink, after which plasma and urine samples were collected over a 0-24 h period. HPLC-MS analysis identified 13 metabolites in plasma and a further 20 in urine.

20082748,"Estimation of caffeine intake in Japanese adults using 16 d weighed diet records based on a food composition database newly developed for Japanese populations.OBJECTIVE: Previous studies in Western populations have linked caffeine intake with health status. While detailed dietary assessment studies in these populations have shown that the main contributors to caffeine intake are <e>coffee</e> and tea, the wide consumption of Japanese and Chinese teas in Japan suggests that sources of intake in Japan may differ from those in Western populations. Among these teas, moreover, caffeine content varies widely among the different forms consumed (brewed, canned or bottled), suggesting the need for detailed dietary assessment in estimating intake in Japanese populations. Here, because a caffeine composition database or data obtained from detailed dietary assessment have not been available, we developed a database for caffeine content in Japanese foods and beverages, and then used it to estimate intake in a Japanese population. DESIGN: The caffeine food composition database was developed using analytic values from the literature, 16 d weighed diet records were collected, and caffeine intake was estimated from the 16 d weighed diet records. SETTING: Four areas in Japan, Osaka (Osaka City), Okinawa (Ginowan City), Nagano (Matsumoto City) and Tottori (Kurayoshi City), between November 2002 and September 2003. SUBJECTS: Two hundred and thirty Japanese adults aged 30-69 years. RESULTS: Mean caffeine intake was 256.2 mg/d for women and 268.3 mg/d for men. The major contributors to intake were Japanese and Chinese teas and coffee (47 % each). Caffeine intake above 400 mg/d, suggested in reviews to possibly have negative health effects, was seen in 11 % of women and 15 % of men. CONCLUSIONS: In this Japanese population, caffeine intake was comparable to the estimated values reported in Western populations.",M2
20075335,"<e>Coffee</e> consumption enhances high-density lipoprotein-mediated cholesterol efflux in macrophages.RATIONALE: Association of habitual coffee consumption with coronary heart disease morbidity and mortality has not been established. We hypothesized that coffee may enhance reverse cholesterol transport (RCT) as the antiatherogenic properties of high-density lipoprotein (HDL). OBJECTIVE: This study was to investigate whether the phenolic acids of coffee and coffee regulates RCT from macrophages in vitro, ex vivo and in vivo. METHODS AND RESULTS: Caffeic acid and ferulic acid, the major phenolic acids of coffee, enhanced cholesterol efflux from THP-1 macrophages mediated by HDL, but not apoA-I. Furthermore, these phenolic acids increased both the mRNA and protein levels of ATP-binding cassette transporter (ABC)G1 and scavenger receptor class B type I (SR-BI), but not ABCA1. Eight healthy volunteers were recruited for the ex vivo study, and blood samples were taken before and 30 minutes after consumption of coffee or water in a crossover study. The mRNA as well as protein levels of ABCG1, SR-BI, and cholesterol efflux by HDL were increased in the macrophages differentiated under autologous sera obtained after coffee consumption compared to baseline sera. Finally, effects of coffee and phenolic acid on in vivo RCT were assessed by intraperitoneally injecting [(3)H]cholesterol-labeled acetyl low-density lipoprotein-loaded RAW264.7 cells into mice, then monitoring appearance of (3)H tracer in plasma, liver, and feces. Supporting in vitro and ex vivo data, ferulic acid was found to significantly increase the levels of (3)H tracer in feces. CONCLUSIONS: Coffee intake might have an antiatherogenic property by increasing ABCG1 and SR-BI expression and enhancing HDL-mediated cholesterol efflux from the macrophages via its plasma phenolic acids.",M2
20073472,"Development of a hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry based stable isotope dilution analysis and pharmacokinetic studies on bioactive pyridines in human plasma and urine after <e>coffee</e> consumption.The paper reports on the development of an accurate hydrophilic liquid interaction chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (HILIC-MS/MS) based stable isotope dilution analysis for the simultaneous quantitation of the food-derived bioactive pyridines trigonelline, nicotinic acid, nicotinamide, and N-methylpyridinium, as well as their key metabolites nicotinamide-N-oxide, N-methylnicotinamide, N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxylic acid in human plasma and urine. Precision of the stable isotope dilution analysis (SIDA) was 1.9% and 11.9% relative standard deviation (n = 6), and accuracy was between 92.4% and 113.0%. The lower limit of quantitation (LLOQ) was 50 fmol (10 pmol/mL) injected onto the column for all analytes with the exception of N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxylic acid and N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide, for which an LLOQ of 100 fmol (20 pmol/mL) was found. The method was applied to monitor the plasma appearance and urinary excretion and to determine pharmacokinetic parameters of the bioactive pyridines as well as their metabolites in a clinical human intervention study with healthy volunteers (six women, seven men) after oral administration of 350 mL of a standard coffee beverage. Trigonelline plasma levels increased from 160 nmol/L to maximum concentrations of 5479 (males) or 6547 nmol/L (females), and N-methylpyridinium plasma levels raised from virtually complete absence to maximum values of 777 (females) or 804 nmol/L (males) within 2-3 and 1-2 h after coffee consumption, respectively. The high plasma levels of N-methylpyridinium found after coffee consumption clearly demonstrate for the first time that this cation is entering the vascular system, which is the prerequisite for biological in vivo effects claimed for that compound. In contrast, the coffee intervention did not significantly influence the plasma concentrations of N-methyl-2-pyridone-5-carboxamide and N-methyl-4-pyridone-5-carboxamide, the major niacin metabolites. Within 8 h after coffee intervention, an urinary excretion of 57.4 +/- 6.9% of trigonelline and 69.1 +/- 6.2% of N-methylpyridinium was found for the male volunteers, whereas females excreted slightly less with 46.2 +/- 7.4% and 61.9 +/- 12.2% of these pyridines.",M2

Results showed that melanoidins decrease the synthesis of lipid hydroperoxides and secondary lipoxidation products. Coffee melanoidins at 3 mg/mL reversed the reaction and broke down hydroperoxides to concentrations lower than the initial value. Barley coffee and dark beer melanoidins were less effective, and even at 12 mg/mL did not reverse the reaction. The proposed mechanism of action involved Fe(2+) chelating capacity, heme-binding ability, and radical-scavenging activity. Melanoidins were characterized for their content in total proteins, carbohydrates, and phenolics, and the relationship between the chemical composition and the antioxidant activity of dietary melanoidins was investigated. Coffee melanoidins, which contain more phenolics and proteins with respect to the other melanoidins, showed greater antioxidant activity with respect to the other melanoidins tested.",M2

20056621,"<e>Coffee</e>, tea, caffeine intake, and risk of adult glioma in three prospective cohort studies.Current data suggest that caffeinated beverages may be associated with lower risk of glioma. Caffeine has different effects on the brain, some of which could play a role in brain carcinogenesis, and coffee has been consistently associated with reduced risk of liver cancer, thus suggesting a potential anticarcinogenic effect. A total of 335 incident cases of gliomas (men, 133; women, 202) were available from three independent cohort studies. Dietary intake was assessed by food frequency questionnaires obtained at baseline and during follow-up. Cox proportional hazard models were used to estimate incidence rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) between consumption of coffee, tea, carbonated beverages, caffeine, and glioma risk adjusting for age and total caloric intake. Estimates from each cohort were pooled using a random-effects model. Consumption of five or more cups of coffee and tea daily compared with no consumption was associated with a decrease risk of glioma (RR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.41-0.87; P(trend) = 0.04). Inverse, although weaker, associations were also observed between coffee, caffeinated coffee, tea, and carbonated beverages and glioma risk. No association was observed between decaffeinated coffee and glioma risk. Among men, a statistically significant inverse association was observed between caffeine consumption and risk of glioma (RR, 0.46; 95% CI, 0.26-0.81; P(trend) = 0.03); the association was weaker among women. Our findings suggest that consumption of caffeinated beverages, including coffee and tea, may reduce the risk of adult glioma, but further research is warranted to confirm these findings in other populations.",M2

Sixty-six volunteers who experienced tinnitus and who usually consumed at least 150 mg/day of caffeine participated. The intervention was a direct replacement of usual caffeinated tea/<e>coffee</e> with double-blinded supplies, under one of two conditions. Condition 1: Maintenance followed by phased withdrawal. Condition 2: Phased withdrawal followed by reintroduction and maintenance. Tinnitus severity was measured by the total score of the Tinnitus Questionnaire on Days 1, 15, and 30. Secondary measures included twice daily self-rated symptoms relevant to tinnitus and caffeine withdrawal. Caffeine had no effect on tinnitus severity, the mean difference between caffeinated and decaffeinated days being -0.04 (95% confidence interval -1.99 to 1.93), p=0.97.

20047988,"Absorption, distribution, and biliary excretion of cafestol, a potent cholesterol-elevating compound in unfiltered <e>coffees</e>, in mice.Cafestol is a diterpene present in unfiltered coffees. It is the most potent cholesterol-elevating compound present in the human diet. However, the precise mechanisms underlying this effect are still unclear. In contrast, cafestol is also known as a hepatoprotective compound, which is likely to be related to the induction of glutathione biosynthesis and conjugation. In the present study, we investigated whole-body distribution, biliary excretion, and portal bioavailability of cafestol in mice. First, dissection was used to study distribution. Five hours after an oral dose with (3)H-labeled cafestol, most activity was found in small intestine, liver, and bile. These results were confirmed by quantitative whole-body autoradiography in a time course study, which also showed elimination of all radioactivity within 48 h after administration. Next, radiolabeled cafestol was dosed intravenously to bile duct-cannulated mice. Five hours after the dose 20% of the radioactivity was found in bile. Bile contained several metabolites but no parent compound. After intestinal administration of radioactive cafestol to portal vein-cannulated mice, cafestol was shown to be rapidly absorbed into the portal vein as the parent compound, a glucuronide, and an unidentified metabolite. From the presence of a glucuronide in bile that can be deconjugated by a bacterial enzyme and the prolonged absorption of parent compound from the gastrointestinal tract, we hypothesized that cafestol undergoes enterohepatic cycling. Together with our earlier observation that epoxidation of the furan ring occurs in liver, these findings merit further research on the process of accumulation of this coffee ingredient in liver and intestinal tract.",M2
20045950,"Cafestol, a <e>coffee</e>-specific diterpene, is a novel extracellular signal-regulated kinase inhibitor with AP-1-targeted inhibition of prostaglandin E2 production in lipopolysaccharide-activated macrophages.Coffee is a popular beverage worldwide with various nutritional benefits. Diterpene cafestol, one of the major components of coffee, contributes to its beneficial effects through various biological activities such as chemopreventive, antitumorigenic, hepatoprotective, antioxidative and antiinflammatory effects. In this study, we examined the precise molecular mechanism of the antiinflammatory activity of cafestol in terms of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) production, a critical factor involved in inflammatory responses. Cafestol inhibited both PGE(2) production and the mRNA expression of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 from lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-treated RAW264.7 cells. Interestingly, this compound strongly decreased the translocation of c-Jun into the nucleus and AP-1 mediated luciferase activity. In kinase assays using purified extracellular signal-regulated kinase 2 (ERK2) or immunoprecipitated ERK prepared from LPS-treated cells in the presence or absence of cafestol, it was found that this compound can act as an inhibitor of ERK2 but not of ERK1 and mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase 1 (MEK 1). Therefore our data suggest that cafestol may be a novel ERK inhibitor with AP-1-targeted inhibitory activity against PGE(2) production in LPS-activated RAW264.7 cells.",M2

Caffeine intake was compared between patients with mild and advanced liver fibrosis (bridging fibrosis/cirrhosis). Logistic regression was used to evaluate the association between caffeine consumption and hepatic fibrosis. One hundred seventy-seven patients (99 male, 104 white, 121 with chronic hepatitis C virus [HCV] infection) undergoing liver biopsy completed the caffeine questionnaire on up to three occasions. Results from repeated questionnaires were consistent. Daily caffeine consumption above the 75(th) percentile for the cohort (308 mg = approximately 2.25 cups of coffee equivalents) was associated with reduced liver fibrosis (odds ratio [OR], 0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.14-0.80; P = 0.015) and the protective association persisted after controlling for age, sex, race, liver disease, body mass index, and alcohol intake in all patients (OR, 0.25; 95% CI, 0.09-0.67; P = 0.006), as well as the subset with HCV infection (OR, 0.19; 95% CI, 0.05-0.66; P = 0.009). Despite a modest trend, consumption of caffeine from sources other than coffee or of decaffeinated coffee was not associated with reduced liver fibrosis. A reliable tool for measurement of caffeine consumption demonstrated that caffeine consumption, particularly from regular coffee, above a threshold of approximately 2 coffee-cup equivalents per day, was associated with less severe hepatic fibrosis.",M2
20008687,"<e>Coffee</e>, decaffeinated coffee, and tea consumption in relation to incident type 2 diabetes mellitus: a systematic review with meta-analysis.BACKGROUND: Coffee consumption has been reported to be inversely associated with risk of type 2 diabetes mellitus. Similar associations have also been reported for decaffeinated coffee and tea. We report herein the findings of meta-analyses for the association between coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and tea consumption with risk of diabetes. METHODS: Relevant studies were identified through search engines using a combined text word and MeSH (Medical Subject Headings) search strategy. Prospective studies that reported an estimate of the association between coffee, decaffeinated coffee, or tea with incident diabetes between 1966 and July 2009. RESULTS: Data from 18 studies with information on 457 922 participants reported on the association between coffee consumption and diabetes. Six (N = 225 516) and 7 studies (N = 286 701) also reported estimates of the association between decaffeinated coffee and tea with diabetes, respectively. We found an inverse log-linear relationship between coffee consumption and subsequent risk of diabetes such that every additional cup of coffee consumed in a day was associated with a 7% reduction in the excess risk of diabetes relative risk, 0.93 [95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.95]) after adjustment for potential confounders. CONCLUSIONS: Owing to the presence of small-study bias, our results may represent an overestimate of the true magnitude of the association. Similar significant and inverse associations were observed with decaffeinated coffee and tea and risk of incident diabetes. High intakes of coffee, decaffeinated coffee, and tea are associated with reduced risk of diabetes. The putative protective effects of these beverages warrant further investigation in randomized trials.",M2
20007338,"Nondairy creamer, but not milk, delays the appearance of <e>coffee</e> phenolic acid equivalents in human plasma.Chlorogenic acids (CGA) are antioxidants found in coffee. They are becoming of interest for their health-promoting effects, but bioavailability in humans is not well understood. We hypothesized that adding whole milk or sugar and nondairy creamer to instant coffee might modulate the bioavailability of coffee phenolics. Nine healthy participants were asked to randomly drink, in a crossover design, instant coffee (Coffee); instant coffee and 10% whole milk (Milk); or instant coffee, sugar, and nondairy creamer already premixed (Sugar/NDC). All 3 treatments provided the same amount of total CGA (332 mg). Blood was collected for 12 h after ingestion and plasma samples treated using a liquid-liquid extraction method that included a full enzymatic cleavage to hydrolyze all CGA and conjugates into phenolic acid equivalents. Hence, we focused our liquid chromatography-Electrospray ionization-tandem MS detection and quantification on caffeic acid (CA), ferulic acid (FA), and isoferulic acid (iFA) equivalents. Compared with a regular black instant coffee, the addition of milk did not significantly alter the area under the curve (AUC), maximum plasma concentration (C(max)), or the time needed to reach C(max) (T(max)). The C(max) of CA and iFA were significantly lower and the T(max) of FA and iFA significantly longer for the Sugar/NDC group than for the Coffee group. However, the AUC did not significantly differ. As a conclusion, adding whole milk did not alter the overall bioavailability of coffee phenolic acids, whereas sugar and nondairy creamer affected the T(max) and C(max) but not the appearance of coffee phenolics in plasma.",M2
20006112,"Analysis of commercial beverage products by size exclusion chromatography coupled with UV-vis absorbance detection and dynamic surface tension detection.Multidimensional analysis of instant <e>coffee</e> and barley beverage samples using size exclusion chromatography (SEC) combined with a dynamic surface tension detector (DSTD) and a UV-vis absorbance detector (UV) is reported. A unique finding of this study was the action of the tetrabutylammonium (TBA) cation as a modifying agent (with bromide as the counter anion) that substantially increased the surface pressure signal and sensitivity of many of the proteins in the chromatographically separated samples. The tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) enhancement of the surface pressure signal was further investigated by studying the response of 12 commercial standard proteins (alpha-lactalbumin, beta-lactoglobulin, human serum albumin (HSA), albumin from chicken egg white (OVA), bovine serum albumin (BSA), hemoglobin, alpha-chymotrypsinogen A, cytochrome C, myoglobin, RNase A, carbonic anhydrase, and lysozyme) in buffer performed using flow injection analysis (FIA) coupled with the DSTD with and without various concentrations of TBAB. The FIA-DSTD data show that 1mM TBAB enhances sensitivity of HSA detection, by lowering the limit of detection (LOD) from 2mg/mL to 0.1mg/mL. Similarly, the LOD for BSA was reduced from 1mg/mL to 0.2mg/mL. These FIA-DSTD experiments allowed the detection conditions to be optimized for further SEC-UV/DSTD experiments. Thus, the SEC-UV/DSTD system has been optimized and successfully applied to the selective analysis of surface-active protein fractions in a commercial instant coffee sample and in a soluble barley sample. The complementary selectivity of using the DSTD relative to an absorbance detector is also demonstrated.",M2
20005914,"Estimation of dietary intake of 5-hydroxymethylfurfural and related substances from <e>coffee</e> to Spanish population.5-Hydroxymethylfurfural (HMF) is naturally formed during food processing or cooking activities, giving its ubiquity in the Western diet. HMF could be metabolised to 5-sulfooxymethylfurfural making HMF potentially harmful in an extent unknown at present. Coffee is the main exposure source. Occurrence of HMF, 5-hydroxymethyl-2-furoic acid (HMFA) and 2-furoic acid (FA) were measured in commercial ground coffee and soluble coffee marketed in Spain. Levels of 110, 625, 1734, 2480 mg HMF/kg were obtained for natural, blend, torrefacto and soluble coffee, respectively, giving four classes significantly different. Soluble coffee showed the largest variability in HMF. Levels of HMFA and FA did not change significantly being about 600 mg/kg. Dietary exposure to HMF coffee to consumption in the total Spanish population was estimated to be 8.57 mg/day by using a deterministic approach. However, median level was recalculated to 5.26 mg HMF/day when specific contribution of each type of ground and soluble coffee in the consumption habits was considered. Resultant value is above of the threshold of concern (1600 microg HMF/day, mTAMDI). A level of 8.57 mg HMF/day in persons with high consumption habits (95th percentile) was calculated for risk assessment.",M2

20002929,"Effect of bleaching on staining susceptibility of resin composite restorative materials.STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM: Effect of bleaching procedures on staining susceptibility of resin restorative materials is still questionable. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the staining susceptibility of restorative materials bleached with 20% carbamide peroxide home bleaching agent and subsequently immersed in <e>coffee</e> and tea. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-two disk-shaped specimens were fabricated for each of the resin composites (Filtek Supreme XT [3M ESPE, St. Paul, MN, USA], Ceram-X Mono [Dentsply, Konstanz, Germany], and Aelite All Purpose Body [BISCO, Inc., Shaumburg, IL, USA]). The baseline color values were measured with a spectrophotometer. The specimens of each restorative material were randomly divided into two groups (N = 21). While the first group specimens were stored in distilled water (nonbleaching group-control), bleaching agent (Opalescence PF 20% [Ultradent Poducts, South Jordan, UT, USA]) was applied on the top surface of each specimen of the second group (bleaching group). After color change values were measured, the specimens were randomly divided into three subgroups (N = 7) according to the staining solutions. The color change values (DeltaE*ab) were calculated and the data were subjected to analysis of variance. Statistical significance was declared if the p value was 0.05 or less. RESULTS: There was no statistically significant difference within each restorative material's DeltaE*ab values after bleaching (p = 0.714). Also, the staining solutions did not cause a statistically significant difference between DeltaE*ab values of bleaching compared with nonbleaching groups (p = 0.146). Significant interaction was found only between restorative materials and staining solutions (p = 0.000). CONCLUSION: Bleaching of the tested resin composites did not increase their susceptibility to extrinsic staining in vitro. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE Bleaching did not affect staining susceptibility of the tested resin composite restorative materials. (J Esthet Restor Dent 21:407-415, 2009).",M2
19995882,"Caffeine consumption and cognitive function at age 70: the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 study.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association between caffeine consumption and cognitive outcomes in later life. METHODS: Participants were 923 healthy adults from the Lothian Birth Cohort 1936 Study, on whom there were intelligence quotient (IQ) data from age 11 years. Cognitive function at age 70 years was assessed, using tests measuring general cognitive ability, speed of information processing, and memory. Current caffeine consumption (using multiple measures of tea, <e>coffee</e>, and total dietary caffeine) was obtained by self-report questionnaire, and demographic and health information was collected in a standardized interview. RESULTS: In age- and sex-adjusted models, there were significant positive associations between total caffeine intake and general cognitive ability and memory. After adjustment for age 11 IQ and social class, both individually and together, most of these associations became nonsignificant. A robust positive association, however, was found between drinking ground coffee (e.g., filter and espresso) and performance on the National Adult Reading Test (NART, p = .007), and the Wechsler Test of Adult Reading (WTAR, p = .02). No gender effects were observed, contrary to previous studies. Generally, higher cognitive scores were associated with coffee consumption, and lower cognitive scores with tea consumption, but these effects were not significant in the fully adjusted model. CONCLUSIONS: The present study is rare in having childhood IQ in a large sample of older people. The results suggest that the significant caffeine intake-cognitive ability associations are bidirectional-because childhood IQ and estimated prior IQ are associated with the type of caffeine intake in old age-and partly confounded by social class.",M2
19942347,"Carbons prepared from <e>coffee</e> grounds by H3PO4 activation: characterization and adsorption of methylene blue and Nylosan Red N-2RBL.Activated carbons were prepared by the pyrolysis of coffee grounds impregnated by phosphoric acid at 450 degrees C for different impregnation ratios: 30, 60, 120 and 180 wt.%. Materials were characterized for their surface chemistry by elemental analysis,  Boehm titrations , point of zero charge measurements, Infrared spectroscopy, thermogravimetric analysis (TGA); as well as for their porous and morphological structure by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and nitrogen adsorption at 77K. The impregnation ratio was found to govern the porous structure of the prepared activated carbons. Low impregnation ratios (&lt;120 wt.%) led to essentially microporous and acidic activated carbons whereas high impregnation ratios (&gt;120 wt.%) yielded to essentially mesoporous carbons with specific surface areas as high as 925 m(2)g(-1), pore volume as large as 0.7 cm(3)g(-1), and neutral surface. The activated carbons prepared from coffee grounds were compared to a commercial activated carbon (S(BET) approximately 1400 m(2)g(-1)) for their adsorption isotherms of methylene blue and  Nylosan Red N-2RBL , a cationic and anionic (azo) dye respectively.

However, caffeinated coffee acutely impairs glucose metabolism. We assessed acute effects of decaffeinated coffee on glucose and insulin levels. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized, cross-over, placebo-controlled trial of the effects of decaffeinated coffee, caffeinated coffee, and caffeine on glucose, insulin, and glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide (GIP) levels during a 2-h oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) in 11 young men. RESULTS: Within the first hour of the OGTT, glucose and insulin were higher for decaffeinated coffee than for placebo (P &lt; 0.05). During the whole OGTT, decaffeinated coffee yielded higher insulin than placebo and lower glucose and a higher insulin sensitivity index than caffeine. Changes in GIP could not explain any beverage effects on glucose and insulin. CONCLUSIONS: Some types of decaffeinated coffee may acutely impair glucose metabolism but less than caffeine.",M2

Male C57BL/6J mice were raised for 8 weeks on either a normal diet (N group), a high-fat diet (HF group), or a high-fat diet with 1.1% decaffeinated (HF+DC group) or 1.1% caffeine-containing instant coffee (HF+CC group). The body weights of mice in the HF+DC and HF+CC groups were mostly intermediate between the N and HF groups, even if there were no difference in the amount of diet consumption in each group. Mesenteric fat weight was lower in the HF+DC group than in the HF group (p &lt; 0.05) and tended to become lower in the HF+CC group than in the HF group.

19897909,"Continuous orally administered <e>coffee</e> enhanced the antigen-specific Th1 response and reduced allergic development in a TCR-transgenic mice model.Coffee is a globally consumed beverage. Although recent studies have suggested that coffee reduced the risk of lifestyle-related diseases, there are few studies regarding allergic response. This study investigates the effects of orally administered coffee (91 ml/kg/d) on allergic responses using a T cell receptor (TCR)-transgenic DO11.10 mouse allergic model. Splenocytes from coffee-administered naÃ¯ve mice increased antigen (Ag)-specific interleukin (IL)-12p40 secretion. When Ag sensitization and coffee administration were concurrently performed, the splenocytes from coffee-administered mice showed a decrease of IL-2 and an increase of IL-12p40 secretion. The Ag-specific cutaneous response and serum IgE level were reduced in coffee-administered mice, although, after establishing the allergy, coffee administration did not suppress the allergic reaction. These results suggest that coffee could induce a Th1-type response of the immune system and prevent an allergy developing. Further studies on the optimum dose, cultivar differences, and roasted degree need to be undertaken.",M2
19894707,"Differential reactivity of purified bioactive <e>coffee</e> furans, cafestol and kahweol, with acidic nitrite: product characterization and factors controlling nitrosation versus ring-opening pathways.Cafestol and kahweol, coffee-specific furan diterpenes, are believed to cause various physiological effects in human subjects, including an increase in cholesterol and plasma triacylglycerol levels as well as cancer chemopreventive effects. Despite the increasing interest in these compounds raised by the diverse range of biological activities, their reaction behavior and degradation pathways under physiologically relevant conditions remain uncharted. Herein, we report a detailed investigation of the structural modifications suffered by cafestol and kahweol in the presence of acidic nitrite under conditions mimicking those occurring in the stomach during digestion as well as by action of other oxidants. Prior to the chemical study, an isolation procedure for kahweol from green coffee beans was developed based on Soxhlet extraction followed by preparative HPLC. Preliminary experiments showed that kahweol is much more reactive than cafestol toward nitrite at pH 3, as evidenced by inhibition experiments with the 2,3-diaminonaphthalene assay as well as by product analysis in coffee extracts. When exposed to equimolar nitrite in phosphate buffer, pH 3, kahweol gave as a main product the ring-opened dicarbonyl derivative 1. Under more forcing conditions, cafestol reacted as well to give a main nitrogenous product identified as the 1-hydroxy-2-pyrrolinone 2. It is concluded that the conjugated double bond in kahweol is a critical structural element, increasing the susceptibility of the furan ring to protonation rather than nitrosation and favoring ring-opening routes driven by the irreversible oxidation steps. These results offer a useful background to assess the effects of coffee-specific lipids in association with abnormally high nitrite levels from the diet.",M2

The effects of CC on glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity when co-ingested with a high carbohydrate meal and on postprandial metabolism of a subsequent (second) carbohydrate load have not been studied. In a randomised, crossover design, ten healthy males ingested either CC (5 mg caffeine/kg body weight), decaffeinated coffee (DC) or water (W; equal volume) co-ingested with a high glycaemic index cereal followed 3 h later by a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test. After the initial meal, insulin area under the curve (AUC) and insulin sensitivity index did not differ between treatments, although glucose AUC for CC (107 (sem 18) mmol/l x 3 h) and DC (74 (sem 15) mmol/l x 3 h) was greater than W ( - 0.2 (sem 29) mmol/l x 3 h, P &lt; 0.05). After the second carbohydrate load, insulin AUC for CC was 49 % and 57 % greater (P &lt; 0.01) than for DC and W, respectively.

Group I included patients who drank 1 - 3 cups of coffee daily (140 - 420 mg caffeine) for at least 2 years before the study [n = 11; dialysis vintage: 29.1 months (range: 8.7 - 59.6 months); age: 56.0 +/- 14.6 years]. Group II consisted of patients who said that they were nondrinkers of caffeinated coffee [n = 19; dialysis vintage: 15.2 months (range: 6.3 - 45.4 months); age: 56.3 +/- 19.8 years). Serum lipid profile, anthropometric and bioimpedance measurements, and laboratory indices of nutrition and inflammation status were examined.

In the overall group, a correlation was seen between lean body mass and total cholesterol (r = -0.487, p = 0.006). Lower LDL and higher HDL serum cholesterol may occur in dialyzed patients who drink coffee not only because of the direct influence of coffee ingredients on serum lipid profile, but mainly because of a more favorable body composition and better protein nutrition in coffee drinkers.",M2

19818197,"Consumption of <e>coffee</e>, green tea, oolong tea, black tea, chocolate snacks and the caffeine content in relation to risk of diabetes in Japanese men and women.Although the inverse association between coffee consumption and risk of diabetes has been reported numerous times, the role of caffeine intake in this association has remained unclear. We evaluated the consumption of coffee and other beverages and food containing caffeine in relation to the incidence of diabetes. The study participants were 5897 men and 7643 women in a community-based cohort in Takayama, Japan. Consumption of coffee, green tea, oolong tea, black tea and chocolate snacks were measured with a semi-quantitative FFQ in 1992. At the follow-up survey in 2002, the development of diabetes and the time of diagnosis were reported. To assess the association, age, smoking status, BMI, physical activity, education in years, alcohol consumption, total energy intake, fat intake and women's menopausal status were adjusted. Among men who consumed one cup per month to six cups per week and among those who consumed one cup per d or more, the associated hazard ratios were 0.69 (95 % CI 0.50, 0.97) and 0.69 (95 % CI 0.49, 0.98) compared with those who drank little to no coffee, with a P value for trend of 0.32. The hazard ratios for women with the same coffee consumption patterns were 1.08 (95 % CI 0.74, 1.60) and 0.70 (95 % CI 0.44, 1.12), with a P value for trend of 0.03. The association between estimated total caffeine intake and risk of diabetes was insignificant both among men and among women.

Psychometric functions were measured for both single compounds and binary mixtures (2 of 5, forced-choice method). An air dilution olfactometer delivered stimuli, with vapor-phase calibration using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Across the three odorants that differed from the acids, acetic and butyric acid showed approximately additive (or perhaps even supra-additive) summation at low perithreshold concentrations, but subadditive interactions at high perithreshold concentrations. In contrast, the medium-chain acids showed subadditive interactions across a wide range of concentrations.

We assessed the intake of lariciresinol, pinoresinol, secoisolariciresinol and matairesinol in 100 Finnish men consuming their habitual omnivorous diet, and measured the 24 h urinary excretion of plant and enterolignans to compare the intake and metabolism. Dietary determinants of lignan intake and their urinary excretion were also determined. The mean intake of lignans was 1224 (sd 539) mug/d, of which lariciresinol and pinoresinol covered 78 %. Almost half (47 %) of the intake of lignans was explained by the intake of rye products, berries, <e>coffee</e>, tea and roots. The urinary excretion of plant lignans corresponded to 17 % and enterolignans to 92 % of the intake of lignans. The urinary excretion of plant lignans was explained 14 % by the intake of rye products and intake of coffee, and consequently 3-7 % by the intake of water-insoluble fibre. The urinary excretion of enterolactone was explained 11 % by the intake of vegetables and rye products, 14 % by the intake of water-soluble fibre and only 4 % by the intake of lariciresinol. Although the assessed intake of lignans corresponded well with the urinary excretion of lignans, the enterolactone production in the human body depended more on the dietary sources of lignans than the absolute intake of lignans.",M2
19810022,"Variation in the human lipidome associated with <e>coffee</e> consumption as revealed by quantitative targeted metabolomics.The effect of coffee consumption on human health is still discussed controversially. Here, we report results from a metabolomics study of coffee consumption, where we measured 363 metabolites in blood serum of 284 male participants of the Cooperative Health Research in the Region of Augsburg study population, aged between 55 and 79 years. A statistical analysis of the association of metabolite concentrations and the number of cups of coffee consumed per day showed that coffee intake is positively associated with two classes of sphingomyelins, one containing a hydroxy-group (SM(OH)) and the other having an additional carboxy-group (SM(OH,COOH)). In contrast, long- and medium-chain acylcarnitines were found to decrease with increasing coffee consumption. It is noteworthy that the concentration of total cholesterol also rises with an increased coffee intake in this study group. The association observed here between these hydroxylated and carboxylated sphingolipid species and coffee intake may be induced by changes in the cholesterol levels. Alternatively, these molecules may act as scavengers of oxidative species, which decrease with higher coffee intake. In summary, we demonstrate strong positive associations between coffee consumption and two classes of sphingomyelins and a negative association between coffee consumption and long- and medium-chain acylcarnitines.",M2
19800839,"Highly sensitive flow-injection chemiluminescence determination of pyrogallol compounds.A highly sensitive flow-injection chemiluminescent method for the direct determination of pyrogallol compounds has been developed. Proposed method is based on the enhanced effect of pyrogallol compounds on the chemiluminescence signals of KMnO(4)-H(2)O(2) system in slightly alkaline medium. Three important pyrogallol compounds, pyrogallic acid, gallic acid and tannic acid, have been detected by this method, and the possible mechanism of the CL reaction is also discussed. The proposed method is simple, convenient, rapid (60 samples h(-1)), and sensitive, has a linear range of 8x10(-10) mol L(-1) to 1x10(-5) mol L(-1), for pyrogallic acid, with a detection limit of 6x10(-11) mol L(-1), 4x10(-8) mol L(-1) to 5x10(-3) mol L(-1) for gallic acid with a detection limit of 9x10(-10) mol L(-1), and 8x10(-8) mol L(-1) to 5x10(-2) mol L(-1) for tannic acid, with a detection limit of 2x10(-9) mol L(-1), respectively. The relative standard deviation (RSD, n=15) was 0.8, 1.1 and 1.3% for 5x10(-6) mol L(-1) pyrogallic acid, gallic acid and tannic acid, respectively. The proposed method was successfully applied to the determination of pyrogallol compounds in tea and <e>coffee</e> samples.",M2
19797353,"In pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma blood concentrations of some organochlorine compounds and <e>coffee</e> intake are independently associated with KRAS mutations.While KRAS activation is a fundamental initiating event in the aetiopathogenesis of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDA), environmental factors influencing the occurrence and persistence of KRAS mutations remain largely unknown. The objective was to test the hypothesis that in PDA there are aetiopathogenic relationships among concentrations of some organochlorine compounds (OCs) and the mutational status of the KRAS oncogene, as well as among the latter and coffee intake. Incident cases of PDA were interviewed and had blood drawn at hospital admission (N = 103). OCs were measured by high-resolution gas chromatography with electron capture detection. Cases whose tumours harboured a KRAS mutation had higher concentrations of p,p'-dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethene (DDE) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) 138, 153 and 180 than cases with wild-type KRAS, but differences were statistically significant only for p,p'-DDT and PCBs 138 and 153. The association between coffee intake and KRAS mutations remained significant (P-trend &lt; 0.015) when most OCs where accounted for. When p,p'-DDT, PCB 153, coffee and alcohol intake were included in the same model, all were associated with KRAS (P = 0.042, 0.007, 0.016 and 0.025, respectively). p,p'-DDT, p,p'-DDE and PCB 138 were significantly associated with the two most prevalent KRAS mutations (Val and Asp). OCs and coffee may have independent roles in the aetiopathogenesis of PDA through modulation of KRAS activation, acquisition or persistence, plausibly through non-genotoxic or epigenetic mechanisms. Given that KRAS mutations are the most frequent abnormality of oncogenes in human cancers, and the lifelong accumulation of OCs in humans, refutation or replication of the findings is required before any implications are assessed.",M2

19781429,"<e>Coffee</e> consumption and risk of heart failure in men: an analysis from the Cohort of Swedish Men.BACKGROUND: A previous study found that consuming 5 or more cups of coffee per day was associated with increased incidence of heart failure (HF). We sought to evaluate this association in a larger population. METHODS: We measured coffee consumption using food frequency questionnaires among 37,315 men without history of myocardial infarction, diabetes, or HF. They were observed for HF hospitalization or mortality from January 1, 1998, until December 31, 2006, using record linkage to the Swedish inpatient and cause of death registries. Cox proportional hazards models adjusted for age, dietary, and demographic factors were used to calculate incidence rate ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: For 9 years of follow-up, 784 men experienced an HF event. Compared to men who drank &lt;or=1 cup of coffee per day (unadjusted rate 29.9 HF events/10,000 person-years), RR were 0.87 (95% CI 0.69-1.11, unadjusted rate 29.2/10,000 person-years) for 2 cups/d, 0.89 (95% CI 0.70-1.14, unadjusted rate 25.1/10,000 person-years) for 3 cups/d, 0.89 (95% CI 0.69-1.15, unadjusted rate 25.0/10,000 person-years) for 4 cups/d, and 0.89 (95% CI 0.69-1.15, unadjusted rate 18.1/10,000 person-years) for &gt;or=5 cups/d (P for trend in RR = .61). CONCLUSIONS: This study did not support the hypothesis that high coffee consumption is associated with increased rates of HF hospitalization or mortality.",M2
19781119,"Association between habitual <e>coffee</e> consumption and normal or increased estimated glomerular filtration rate in apparently healthy adults.Habitual coffee consumption is associated with the prevention of type 2 diabetes, which often accompanies diabetic nephropathy. However, the relationship between coffee consumption and kidney function is unclear. Therefore, we investigated the associations between habitual coffee consumption and kidney function and damage assessed by the estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and proteinuria using dipstick urinalysis, respectively, in a cross-sectional study of 342 apparently healthy adults. Habitual coffee consumption was defined as drinking one or more cups of coffee per d. eGFR in coffee consumers (n 182; 80.1 (sd 15.0) ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) was significantly higher than that in non-coffee consumers (n 160; 76.9 (sd 12.6) ml/min per 1.73 m(2)) (P &lt; 0.05). Multivariate logistic analysis showed that, compared with non-coffee consumption, coffee consumption was significantly associated with normal or increased eGFR (NIGFR) ( &gt;or= 90 ml/min per 1.73 m(2)), but not proteinuria, which was not attenuated, even after adjustment for age, sex, smoking, tea consumption and other cardiovascular risks (OR 2.91; 95 % CI 1.51, 5.61; P = 0.001). When we took into account eGFR measured 1 year before in a subgroup of the subjects (n 262), coffee consumption (n 142) had a significant relationship with eGFR, which was consistently higher with a difference of 4.0 ml/min per 1.73 m(2) compared with non-coffee consumption (P = 0.01; two-way repeated ANOVA). Similar associations were observed in both sexes when data were reanalysed according to sex. In conclusion, our findings suggest that habitual coffee consumption is associated with NIGFR independently of clinical confounders. Further studies are needed to confirm this association and to explore whether the effect of coffee consumption on eGFR is beneficial for the kidney.",M2

A nested case-control study was conducted in a cohort of French-Canadian women, with 560 members involving 280 nongene carriers of mutated BRCA gene affected by breast cancer and 280 nonaffected and nongene carriers of mutated BRCA gene. A validated semi-quantitative food frequency questionnaire was used to ascertain dietary intake, and a core questionnaire, to gather information on lifestyle risk factors. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated in logistic regression models. It was found that energy intake &gt;2,057 Kcal/day was significantly and positively related to breast cancer risk (OR = 2.54; 95% CI: 1.67-3.84; p = 0.01). Women who drank more than eight cups of coffee per day had an increased risk of breast cancer: OR = 1.40 (95% CI: 1.09-2.24; p = 0.03). Subjects who drank &gt;9 g of alcohol (ethanol) per day had an increased risk of breast cancer: OR = 1.55 (95% CI: 1.02-2.37; p = 0.04). In addition, a positive and significant association was noted between the consumption of beer, wine and spirits, and breast cancer risk. The ORs were 1.34 (95% CI: 1.28-2.11; p = 0.04) for more than two bottles of beer per week, OR = 1.16 (95% CI: 1.08-2.58; p = 0.05) for &gt;10 oz of wine per week and OR = 1.09 (95% CI: 1.02-2.08; p = 0.05) for &gt;6 oz of spirit per week, respectively. Intakes of other nutrients and dietary components were not significantly associated with nongene carrier breast cancer risk. This study provides evidence that total energy intake, coffee, and alcohol consumption may play a role in breast cancer risk.",M2

The adsorbent was prepared by microwave treatment, providing a significant reduction in processing time coupled to an increase in adsorption capacity in comparison to conventional carbonization in a muffle furnace. Batch adsorption tests were performed at 25 degrees C and the effects of particle size, contact time, adsorbent dosage and initial solution pH were investigated. Adsorption kinetics was better described by a second-order model. The experimental adsorption equilibrium data were fitted to Langmuir, Freundlich and Tempkin adsorption models, with Langmuir providing the best fit. The results presented in this study show that microwave activation presents great potential as an alternative method in the production of adsorbents.",M2
19760283,"Caffeine expectancies influence the subjective and behavioral effects of caffeine.OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the independent and interactive effects of caffeine pharmacology and expected effects of caffeine on performance and subjective outcomes. METHODS: Abstinent <e>coffee</e> drinkers (n = 60) consumed decaffeinated coffee with either 280 mg or 0 mg added caffeine. Caffeine dose was crossed with varying instructions that the coffee would either enhance or impair performance in a 2 x 2 factorial design. Performance, mood, caffeine withdrawal, and negative somatic effects were assessed. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, caffeine improved reaction time and accuracy on the rapid visual information processing task, a measure of vigilance. However, there was a significant dose by expectancy interaction that revealed that among participants given placebo coffee,  impair  instructions produced better performance than  enhance  instructions. Caffeine also improved psychomotor performance as indicated by a finger tapping task with no main effects of expectancy or interactions. Impair instructions produced greater reports of negative somatic effects than enhance instructions, but only when caffeine was administered. CONCLUSIONS: Manipulating the expected effects of caffeine altered the behavioral and subjective effects of caffeine. A significant dose by expectancy interaction revealed a somewhat paradoxical outcome in the placebo conditions whereby those told  impair  performed better than those told  enhance.  This may reflect compensatory responding as has been observed in similar studies using alcohol (Fillmore et al. Psychopharmacology 115:383-388, 1994). Impair instructions led to greater negative somatic effects only when caffeine was administered supporting the active placebo hypothesis.",M2
19756631,"The promoter of a gene encoding an isoflavone reductase-like protein in <e>coffee</e> (Coffea arabica) drives a stress-responsive expression in leaves.A cDNA clone (designated CaIRL) encoding an isoflavone reductase-like protein from coffee (Coffea arabica) was retrieved during a search for genes showing organ/tissue-specific expression among the expressed sequence tags (EST) of the Brazilian coffee EST database. The CaIRL cDNA contains a single open reading frame of 946 nucleotides (nt) encoding 314 amino acids (predicted molecular weight of 34 kDa). Several features identified the predicted CaIRL protein as a new member of the PIP family of NADPH-dependent reductases. Expression studies demonstrated that CaIRL is expressed exclusively in coffee leaves and its transcript level is markedly increased in response to fungal infection and mechanical injury. Analysis of transgenic tobacco plants harboring a CaIRL 5'-flanking region (862 nt) fused to uidA reporter gene (GUS) confirmed the responsiveness of the putative promoter to abiotic stress in wounded leaves. In turn, a 5' deletion to -404 completely abolished promoter activation by abiotic stimulus in transgenic plants. The lack of GUS expression in non-wounded leaf tissues in transgenic tobacco was in contrast to the basal level of CaIRL expression observed in non-stressed healthy coffee leaves.",M2
19756031,"Obesity, <e>coffee</e> consumption and CRP levels in postmenopausal overweight/obese women: importance of hormone replacement therapy use.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Obesity is associated with an inflammatory state that is often characterized by elevated plasma C-reactive protein (CRP) levels. Although coffee is broadly consumed in Western societies, few studies have examined the relationship between obesity, coffee consumption and CRP levels. The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between obesity, coffee consumption and variation in CRP in postmenopausal, overweight/obese women with or without hormone replacement therapy (HRT) use. SUBJECTS/METHODS: Cross-sectional analyses of 344 healthy sedentary, overweight/obese postmenopausal women (mean age=57.1+/-6.4 years and mean body mass index (BMI)=36.1+/-3.9 kg/ m(2)). Plasma CRP levels were measured by a highly sensitive immunoassay that used monoclonal antibodies coated with polystyrene particles. Diet was assessed using the Food Intake and Analysis System semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire. RESULTS: Plasma CRP was positively associated with BMI (P&lt;0.001) and negatively associated with coffee consumption (P&lt;or=0.05). In women using HRT, plasma CRP was positively associated with BMI in women consuming less than one cup of coffee per month (r (2)=0.15 (P&lt;0.001)), one cup per day (0.14 (P=0.02)) and more than one cup per day (0.12 (P=0.03)). In women who did not use HRT, CRP was associated with BMI only in women consuming less than one cup of coffee per day (r (2)=0.16 (P&lt;0.001)) but not in women consuming one cup per day (0.06 (P=0.10)) or more than one daily cup of coffee (0.03 (P=0.27)). CONCLUSIONS: Among overweight/obese postmenopausal women, coffee consumption is negatively associated with CRP. Coffee consumption appears to attenuate the association between BMI and CRP, but only in women not using HRT.",M2

19748677,"The effect of beverage preparation method on aluminium content in <e>coffee</e> infusions.Seven types of coffee were prepared by four methods. Three of them - simple coffee infusion, preparation in ibrick and moka pot - are very often used to prepare coffee at home. The fourth one - a single-cup filter is typical for Vietnam. Cookware used for each method was made from glass, aluminium, stainless steel and two types of alloys. Amounts of Al leaching to coffee infusions were determined. On average, the highest amount of Al was in coffee infusions brewed in aluminium single-cup filter, and the lowest in infusions prepared by simple extraction. Other brewing methods in combination with different tool materials resulted in similar Al content. The type of brewing method significantly influences the Al content in final infusion. Aluminium content varies in infusions in relation to the method of choice, especially when using single-cup filter. Despite the fact that coffee is considered to be a poor source of Al for humans, in some cases, Al content in infusions can even reach the values reported for tea infusions.",M2

Dairy farming and railroad development distinguished Barra do PiraÃ­ from other <e>coffee</e>-producing areas that suffered from ecological devastation. By 1900 the land's loss of fertility precluded further plantation agriculture in Barra do PiraÃ­, leading to the transition from lucrative coffee cultivation to dairy farming based on meager capital inputs. Compared to the earlier coffee culture, dairy farms produced only modest wealth for landlords and required fewer laborers, compelling impoverished tenants to migrate in search of employment. Since Barra do PiraÃ­ was an important railroad junction, many rural laborers ended up in the locale after using the railroad as a migratory path. At the same time, the railroad and proto-industries that it stimulated provided alternative employment for rural laborers, thereby partially mitigating the leverage landlords had over the abundant labor force. The availability of industrial and proto-industrial employment created occupational diversity among rural tenants and introduced them to work routines that would become commonplace when the region more fully industrialized after 1940.",M2

METHODS: This research was conducted as part of the Dutch Contribution to the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition, which involves a prospective cohort of 40,011 participants with a mean follow-up of 10 years. A validated food-frequency questionnaire was used to assess coffee and tea consumption and other lifestyle and dietary factors. The main outcome was verified incidence of type 2 diabetes. Blood pressure, caffeine, magnesium and potassium were examined as possible mediating factors. RESULTS: During follow-up, 918 incident cases of type 2 diabetes were documented. After adjustment for potential confounders, coffee and tea consumption were both inversely associated with type 2 diabetes, with hazard ratios of 0.77 (95% CI 0.63-0.95) for 4.1-6.0 cups of coffee per day (p for trend = 0.033) and 0.63 (95% CI: 0.47-0.86) for &gt;5.0 cups of tea per day (p for trend = 0.002). Total daily consumption of at least three cups of coffee and/or tea reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes by approximately 42%. Adjusting for blood pressure, magnesium, potassium and caffeine did not attenuate the associations.

Three-week-old male ICR mice were fed with/without 0.1% (w/v) instant coffee solution. At 2, 4, and 8 mo, the levels of 8-hydroxydeoxyguanosine (8-OH-dG), a major form of oxidative DNA damage, and the expression of mouse 8-OH-dG repair-associated genes and redox system-associated genes, the SOD activity, and the LPO level were analyzed. Simultaneously, half of the mice were fed a low vitamin (LV) diet (autoclaved diet) to disturb the defense system against oxidative stresses. As a result, the 8-OH-dG level was increased in the livers of LV diet (+ water)-fed mice for 8 mo, in comparison to those of the 0 M control mice and normal diet (+ water)-fed mice. However, no significant differences between water drinking and coffee drinking were observed, in terms of the 8-OH-dG level. In addition, the 8-OH-dG repair-associated gene expression, the SOD activity, and the LPO level also showed no significant differences between water drinking and coffee drinking in all mouse groups. On the other hand, among the redox system-associated genes, only the expression of GPx1 was changed. These results suggest that instant coffee consumption has little, if any, effect on the risk of liver cancer due to oxidative stresses.",M2
19719133,"Polyphenolic chemistry of tea and <e>coffee</e>: a century of progress.Tea and coffee, the most popular beverages in the world, have been consumed for thousands of years for their alluring flavors and health benefits. Polyphenols, particularly flavonoids and phenolic acids, are of great abundance in tea and coffee and contribute a lot to their flavor and health properties. This paper reviews the polyphenol chemistry of tea and coffee, specifically their stability, and scavenging ability of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and reactive carbonyl species (RCS). During the manufacturing and brewing process, green tea and black tea polyphenols undergo epimerization and oxidation, respectively. Meanwhile, the lactonization and the polymerization of chlorogenic acid are the major causes for the degradation of polyphenols in coffee. Tea catechins, besides having antioxidant properties, have the novel characteristic of trapping reactive carbonyl species. The A ring of the catechins is the binding site for RCS trapping, whereas the B ring is the preferred site for antioxidation.",M2
19713967,"Effects of hydroxyhydroquinone-reduced <e>coffee</e> on vasoreactivity and blood pressure.Recent studies suggest that chlorogenic acids, which are the main components of the polyphenol class in coffee, decrease blood pressure, and that hydroxyhydroquinone (HHQ), which is generated by roasting coffee beans, inhibits the antihypertensive effect of chlorogenic acids in brewed coffee. Here, we examined the vasoreactivity and antihypertensive effects of HHQ-reduced coffee in mild hypertension. The study design was a double blind, randomized, placebo-controlled intervention study, with a 4-week run-in period, followed by an 8-week test beverage ingestion period. The subjects were Japanese men and women with mild hypertension and vascular failure, who were not taking any antihypertensive drugs. During the test beverage ingestion period, the subjects ingested either active or placebo HHQ-reduced coffee (chlorogenic acids per 184 ml of coffee: active, 300 mg; and placebo, 0 mg) daily. Subjects were randomly divided into two groups: active group (n=9) and placebo group (n=12). In the active beverage group, endothelium-dependent, flow-mediated vasodilation impairment was significantly ameliorated and systolic blood pressure was significantly decreased from the baseline, but not in the placebo group. There were no test beverage consumption-related changes in other parameters that may influence blood pressure, such as pulse, cardiac output, body weight or 24-h urine volume. Ingestion of the active beverage significantly decreased urinary isoprostane levels, suggesting a reduced oxidative stress. These findings indicate that HHQ-reduced coffee decreased blood pressure in subjects with mild hypertension. The decreased blood pressure was associated with improved vascular endothelial function.",M2

We examined the relationship of coffee consumption with liver disease progression in individuals with advanced hepatitis C-related liver disease. Baseline coffee and tea intake were assessed in 766 participants of the Hepatitis C Antiviral Long-Term Treatment against Cirrhosis (HALT-C) trial who had hepatitis C-related bridging fibrosis or cirrhosis on liver biopsy and failed to achieve a sustained virological response to peginterferon plus ribavirin treatment. Participants were followed for 3.8 years for clinical outcomes and, for those without cirrhosis, a 2-point increase in Ishak fibrosis score on protocol biopsies. At baseline, higher coffee consumption was associated with less severe steatosis on biopsy, lower serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST)/alanine aminotransferase (ALT) ratio, alpha-fetoprotein, insulin, and homeostatic model assessment (HOMA2) score, and higher albumin (P &lt; 0.05 for all). Two hundred thirty patients had outcomes. Outcome rates declined with increasing coffee intake: 11.1/100 person-years for none, 12.1 for less than 1 cup/day, 8.2 for 1 to fewer than 3 cups/day, and 6.3 for 3 or more cups/day (P-trend = 0.0011). Relative risks (95% confidence intervals) were 1.11 (0.76-1.61) for less than 1 cup/day; 0.70 (0.48-1.02) for 1 to fewer than 3 cups/day; and 0.47 (0.27-0.85) for 3 or more cups/day (P-trend = 0.0003) versus not drinking. Risk estimates did not vary by treatment assignment or cirrhosis status at baseline. Tea intake was not associated with outcomes.

19708805,"Caffeine's implications for women's health and survey of obstetrician-gynecologists' caffeine knowledge and assessment practices.OBJECTIVE: Caffeine has relevance for women's health and pregnancy, including significant associations with spontaneous abortion and low birth weight. According to scientific data, pregnant women and women of reproductive age should be advised to limit their caffeine consumption. This article reviews the implications of caffeine for women's psychological and physical health, and presents data on obstetrician-gynecologists' (ob-gyns) knowledge and practices pertaining to caffeine. METHODS: Ob-gyns (N = 386) who are members of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists' Collaborative Ambulatory Research Network responded to a 21-item survey about caffeine. RESULTS: Although most knew that caffeine is passed through breast milk, only 24.8% were aware that caffeine metabolism significantly slows as pregnancy progresses. Many respondents were not aware of the caffeine content of commonly used products, such as espresso and Diet Coke, with 14.3% and 57.8% indicating amounts within an accurate range, respectively. Furthermore, ob-gyns did not take into account large differences in caffeine content across different caffeinated beverages with most recommending one to two servings of <e>coffee</e> or tea or soft drinks per day. There was substantial inconsistency in what was considered to be  high levels  of maternal caffeine consumption, with only 31.6% providing a response. When asked to indicate the risk that high levels of caffeine have on various pregnancy outcomes, responses were not consistent with scientific data. For example, respondents overestimated the relative risk of stillbirths and underestimated the relative risk of spontaneous abortion. There was great variability in assessment and advice practices pertaining to caffeine. More than half advise their pregnant patients to consume caffeine under certain circumstances, most commonly to alleviate headache and caffeine withdrawal. CONCLUSIONS: The data suggest that ob-gyns could benefit from information about caffeine and its relevance to their clinical practice. The development of clinical practice guidelines for caffeine may prove to be useful.",M2
19706910,"Exposure of seasonal migrant workers to Onchocerca volvulus on <e>coffee</e> plantations in Guatemala.Onchocerciasis (river blindness), which is close to being eliminated from Guatemala through semiannual administration of ivermectin, is still transmitted in one area of the country that coincidentally receives an annual influx of migrant workers to harvest coffee. Migrant workers generally are not included in semiannual ivermectin treatments, but if infected could serve as a reservoir. We report on two studies undertaken to measure the exposure to onchocerciasis (presence of IgG4 antibodies to a recombinant Onchocerca volvulus antigen, OV-16) among migrant workers. During two coffee harvest seasons, 170 migrant workers with a history of working in the disease-endemic area were tested and 1 (0.6%, 95% confidence interval = 0-3.2%) was seropositive. This low rate of exposure in migrant workers indicates that they are unlikely to play a significant role in transmission of onchocerciasis and may indicate that transmission in the last remaining disease-endemic area of Guatemala is decreasing significantly.",M2
