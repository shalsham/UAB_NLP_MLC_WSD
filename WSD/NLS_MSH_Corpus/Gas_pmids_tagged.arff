20520712,"The key nickel enzyme of methanogenesis catalyses the anaerobic oxidation of methane.Large amounts (estimates range from 70 Tg per year to 300 Tg per year) of the potent greenhouse <e>gas</e> methane are oxidized to carbon dioxide in marine sediments by communities of methanotrophic archaea and sulphate-reducing bacteria, and thus are prevented from escaping into the atmosphere. Indirect evidence indicates that the anaerobic oxidation of methane might proceed as the reverse of archaeal methanogenesis from carbon dioxide with the nickel-containing methyl-coenzyme M reductase (MCR) as the methane-activating enzyme. However, experiments showing that MCR can catalyse the endergonic back reaction have been lacking. Here we report that purified MCR from Methanothermobacter marburgensis converts methane into methyl-coenzyme M under equilibrium conditions with apparent V(max) (maximum rate) and K(m) (Michaelis constant) values consistent with the observed in vivo kinetics of the anaerobic oxidation of methane with sulphate. This result supports the hypothesis of 'reverse methanogenesis' and is paramount to understanding the still-unknown mechanism of the last step of methanogenesis. The ability of MCR to cleave the particularly strong C-H bond of methane without the involvement of highly reactive oxygen-derived intermediates is directly relevant to catalytic C-H activation, currently an area of great interest in chemistry.",M1

20480860,"Reclamation of elemental sulfur from flue <e>gas</e> biodesulfurization waste sludge.Perchloroethylene (PCE) extraction was used to reclaim elemental sulfur from flue gas biodesulfurization sludge. The sludge was generated from a biodesulfurization system that concurrently treated the flue gas scrubbing solution and wastewater of citric acid production. The sludge contained approximately 40-60% elemental sulfur; other components included flue gas dust, biomass, inorganic salts, and flocculants. The sulfur was extracted with PCE at 80 degrees C, and then separated from the sludge by hot filtration. The elemental sulfur was then recovered from the PCE solution by recrystallization and centrifugation. When the dried sludge with particle size less than 0.2 mm was used in the PCE extraction, more than 90% of the elemental sulfur in the sludge could be recovered with a contact time of 15 min and a PCE-to-sludge ratio of 5 mL PCE/g sludge. The recovered sulfur generally had purities of 98-99.9% and could be directly used in many industries. Reuse of the PCE solvent in the extraction protocol through four cycles did not adversely influence the sulfur recovery efficiency. The results indicated that the PCE extraction was an effective method for the sulfur recovery from the biodesulfurization sludge.",M1
20471599,"Computational fluid dynamics modeling of <e>gas</e> dispersion in multi impeller bioreactor.In the present study, experiments have been carried out to identify various flow regimes in a dual Rushton turbines stirred bioreactor for different gas flow rates and impeller speeds. The hydrodynamic parameters like fractional gas hold-up, power consumption and mixing time have been measured. A two fluid model along with MUSIG model to handle polydispersed gas flow has been implemented to predict the various flow regimes and hydrodynamic parameters in the dual turbines stirred bioreactor. The computational model has been mapped on commercial solver ANSYS CFX. The flow regimes predicted by numerical simulations are validated with the experimental results. The present model has successfully captured the flow regimes as observed during experiments. The measured gross flow characteristics like fractional gas hold-up, and mixing time have been compared with numerical simulations. Also the effect of gas flow rate and impeller speed on gas hold-up and power consumption have been investigated.",M1
20443485,"Monitoring of hemodynamic changes induced in the healthy breast through inspired <e>gas</e> stimuli with MR-guided diffuse optical imaging.PURPOSE: The modulation of tissue hemodynamics has important clinical value in medicine for both tumor diagnosis and therapy. As an oncological tool, increasing tissue oxygenation via modulation of inspired gas has been proposed as a method to improve cancer therapy and determine radiation sensitivity. As a radiological tool, inducing changes in tissue total hemoglobin may provide a means to detect and characterize malignant tumors by providing information about tissue vascular function. The ability to change and measure tissue hemoglobin and oxygenation concentrations in the healthy breast during administration of three different types of modulated gas stimuli (oxygen/ carbogen, air/carbogen, and air/oxygen) was investigated. METHODS: Subjects breathed combinations of gases which were modulated in time. MR-guided diffuse optical tomography measured total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation in the breast every 30 s during the 16 min breathing stimulus. Metrics of maximum correlation and phase lag were calculated by cross correlating the measured hemodynamics with the stimulus. These results were compared to an air/air control to determine the hemodynamic changes compared to the baseline physiology. RESULTS: This study demonstrated that a gas stimulus consisting of alternating oxygen/carbogen induced the largest and most robust hemodynamic response in healthy breast parenchyma relative to the changes that occurred during the breathing of room air. This stimulus caused increases in total hemoglobin and oxygen saturation during the carbogen phase of gas inhalation, and decreases during the oxygen phase. These findings are consistent with the theory that oxygen acts as a vasoconstrictor, while carbogen acts as a vasodilator. However, difficulties in inducing a consistent change in tissue hemoglobin and oxygenation were observed because of variability in intersubject physiology, especially during the air/oxygen or air/carbogen modulated breathing protocols. CONCLUSIONS: MR-guided diffuse optical imaging is a unique tool that can measure tissue hemodynamics in the breast during modulated breathing. This technique may have utility in determining the therapeutic potential of pretreatment tissue oxygenation or in investigating vascular function. Future gas modulation studies in the breast should use a combination of oxygen and carbogen as the functional stimulus. Additionally, control measures of subject physiology during air breathing are critical for robust measurements.",M1
20437953,"Net mitigation potential of straw return to Chinese cropland: estimation with a full greenhouse <e>gas</e> budget model.Based on the carbon-nitrogen cycles and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation and emission processes related to straw return and burning, a compound greenhouse gas budget model, the  Straw Return and Burning Model  (SRBM), was constructed to estimate the net mitigation potential of straw return to the soil in China. As a full GHG budget model, the SRBM addressed the following five processes: (1) soil carbon sequestration, (2) mitigation of synthetic N fertilizer substitution, (3) methane emission from rice paddies, (4) additional fossil fuel use for straw return, and (5) CH4 and N2O emissions from straw burning in the fields. Two comparable scenarios were created to reflect different degrees of implementation for straw return and straw burning. With GHG emissions and mitigation effects of the five processes converted into global warming potential (GWP), the net GHG mitigation was estimated. We concluded that (1) when the full greenhouse gas budget is considered, the net mitigation potential of straw return differs from that when soil carbon sequestration is considered alone; (2) implementation of straw return across a larger area of cropland in 10 provinces (i.e., Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, and Hainan) will increase net GHG emission; (3) if straw return is promoted as a feasible mitigation measure in the remaining provinces, the total net mitigation potential before soil organic carbon (SOC) saturation will be 71.89 Tg CO2 equivalent (eqv)/yr, which is equivalent to 1.733% of the annual carbon emission from fossil fuel use in China in 2003; (4) after SOC saturation, only 13 of 21 provinces retain a relatively small but permanent net mitigation potential, while in the others the net GHG mitigation potential will gradually diminish; and (5) the major obstacle to the feasibility or permanence of straw return as a mitigation measure is the increased CH4 emission from rice paddies. The paper also suggests that comparable scenarios in which all the related carbon-nitrogen cycles are taken into account be created to estimate the mitigation potentials of organic wastes in different utilizations and treatments.",M1
20437781,"Uncertainties associated with the use of optical remote sensing technique to estimate surface emissions in landfill applications.Landfills represent a source of distributed emissions source over an irregular and heterogeneous surface. In the method termed  Other Test Method-10  (OTM-10), the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a method to quantify emissions from such sources by the use of vertical radial plume mapping (VRPM) techniques combined with measurement of wind speed to determine the average emission flux per unit area per time from nonpoint sources. In such application, the VRPM is used as a tool to estimate the mass of the <e>gas</e> of interest crossing a vertical plane. This estimation is done by fitting the field-measured concentration spatial data to a Gaussian or some other distribution to define a plume crossing the vertical plane. When this technique is applied to landfill surfaces, the VRPM plane may be within the emitting source area itself. The objective of this study was to investigate uncertainties associated with using OTM-10 for landfills. The spatial variability of emission in the emitting domain can lead to uncertainties of -34 to 190% in the measured flux value when idealistic scenarios were simulated. The level of uncertainty might be higher when the number and locations of emitting sources are not known (typical field conditions). The level of uncertainty can be reduced by improving the layout of the VRPM plane in the field in accordance with an initial survey of the emission patterns. The change in wind direction during an OTM-10 testing setup can introduce an uncertainty of 20% of the measured flux value. This study also provides estimates of the area contributing to flux (ACF) to be used in conjunction with OTM-10 procedures. The estimate of ACF is a function of the atmospheric stability class and has an uncertainty of 10-30%.",M1

20420364,"Laboratory investigation of Hg release from flue <e>gas</e> desulfurization products.Flue gas desulfurization (FGD) is a process applied to remove acid deposition precursors from the coal combustion air stream. This process also removes mercury (Hg) resulting in accumulation of this element in FGD produced solids. This project investigated Hg release from FGD materials to the air and water. Hg concentrations in the synthetic leaching precipitation procedure extracts, designed to simulate rainwater pH conditions, were in general &lt;10 ng L(-1). Unlike coal fly ash, which has been found to adsorb Hg from the air, FGD materials were found to release Hg to the air over time with the addition of water a dominant environmental factor promoting release. The chemistry of the atmosphere to which the FGD materials were exposed (i.e., air Hg concentration and presence of oxidants), as well as that of the material (i.e., salts removed), was found to influence the magnitude of emissions. Although this work showed a component of the Hg captured by the FGD process could be released to the air under laboratory conditions, the potential for release under disposal and beneficial use conditions needs to be determined.",M1
20408537,"Oxidation and stabilization of elemental mercury from coal-fired flue <e>gas</e> by sulfur monobromide.Sulfur monobromide (S(2)Br(2)) was employed as a task-specific oxidant to capture and stabilize elemental mercury from coal-fired flue gas. Its performances on the removal of Hg(0) were investigated with respect to the gas-phase reaction and particle-involved reactions. It was found that the gas-phase reaction between Hg(0) and S(2)Br(2) was rapid, and the determined second-rate constant was about 1.2(+/-0.2) x 10(-17)cm(3) molecules(-1) s(-1) at 373 K, which was about 30 times higher than that with sulfur monochloride. The pilot tests showed that the presence of fly ash in flue gas can accelerate the removal of Hg(0) significantly. It was predicted that about 90% of Hg(0) removal efficiency can be obtained with 0.6 ppmv S(2)Br(2) and 30 g/m(3) fly ash in flue gas, and the unburned carbon in fly ash played an important role for Hg(0) removal. The fates of S(2)Br(2) and mercury in the process were evaluated, and the product analysis and leaching tests indicated that mercuric sulfide was the main product of the converted Hg(0) by the direct reaction and consequent series reactions, which is more stable and less toxic than other mercury species. Also, the surplus S(2)Br(2) in flue gas could be captured and neutralized effectively by the alkali components in fly ash or FGD liquor, and its hydrolysis products (elemental sulfur and sulfide) were also helpful to the stabilization of mercury. The result indicated that S(2)Br(2) is a promising oxidant for elemental mercury (Hg(0)) oxidation and stabilization for mercury emission control.",M1
20408083,"Expansion of intraocular <e>gas</e> bubbles due to altitude: do meteorological factors play a role?BACKGROUND: Intraocular gas bubbles expand as patients move up to higher altitude. This may cause an acute intraocular pressure (IOP) rise with associated vascular obstructions and visual loss. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two pseudophakic patients underwent a pars plana vitrectomy and 23% SF6 gas tamponade for a pseudophakic retinal detachment. During the immediate post-operative phase, the patients travelled daily up to their domicile, which was situated approximately 600 m higher than the level where they had been operated on. These travels were always without any pain or visual loss. However 1 week after surgery both patients developed severe ocular pain, and one patient had complete temporary loss of vision after ascending to altitude levels, which had previously presented no problem. Both episodes occurred in parallel with a change in barometric pressure. RESULTS: Treatment with acetazolamide reduced the increased IOP to normal levels, and visual acuity recovered. CONCLUSIONS: Although the post-operative size of an intraocular gas bubble decreases progressively over time, problems with bubble expansion may still occur even at a late stage if meteorological factors, that may increase the bubble size, change.",M1
20403545,"[Atmospheric air pollution: a risk factor for COPD?]Tobacco smoking is the leading cause of COPD worldwide but other risk factors have been recognized. Air pollution is one of them, but its exact role in the development of COPD is hard to demonstrate. Its physiological effects on lung function have only been studied since the nineties by long and tedious cohort studies. Difficulties arise from the heterogeneity of air pollution (<e>gas</e> and particles); thus, its respiratory effects have to be examined for every component separately, and in different populations. It is also necessary to analyse the effects of atmospheric pollution in the short and the long term, considering both its physiological, clinical and toxicological effects, from childhood to adulthood. These factors make it difficult to obtain statistically significant results. Nevertheless, most studies seem to point to a role of air pollution in the development of COPD via oxydative stress but further studies are needed to confirm the exact effect of each component of air pollution on the respiratory tract. These studies could lead to improved public health policies and results are awaited that would identify at-risk populations, decide appropriate preventive measures and propose documented thresholds in pollution exposure... thereby limiting the spread of COPD.",M1
20394810,"Effects of acute in vitro exposure of murine precision-cut lung slices to gaseous nitrogen dioxide and ozone in an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture.The aim of this study was to establish an air-liquid interface (ALI) culture of precision-cut lung slices (PCLS) for direct exposure of lung cells to gaseous contaminants. Nitrogen dioxide (NO(2)) and ozone (O(3)) were selected as model <e>gas</e> compounds. Acute pro-inflammatory and toxic effects of NO(2) and O(3) on live lung tissue were investigated. Murine PCLS were exposed to different flow rates (3-30mL/min) of synthetic air, O(3) (3.5-8.5ppm), or NO(2) (1-80ppm). Tissue survived ex vivo in ALI culture and resisted exposure to NO(2) (1-10ppm) and O(3) (3.5-8.5ppm) for 1h. Longer exposure to NO(2) resulted in a clear loss of viability, whereas exposure to O(3) was less effective. Exposure to NO(2) dose-dependently induced release of the pro-inflammatory IL-1alpha (40%), whereas RANTES, IL-12, and eotaxin remained unchanged. Early secretion of IL-1alpha (80%), RANTES (&gt;800%), MIP-1beta (44%), and MCP-1 (60%) was already detected after 1h of exposure to O(3). The obtained data showed that direct exposure to O(3) and NO(2) induced cytotoxicity and pro-inflammatory responses in PCLS with ALI culture. This provides a model that more closely resembles in vivo exposure of airborne contaminants, and thus should be appropriate for toxicity testing.",M1

The following ligands (L) were employed: 1,12-diazaperylene (dap), 1,1'-bisisoquinoline (bis), 2,2'-bipyridine (bpy), 1,10-phenanthroline (phen), 2,11-disubstituted 1,12-diazaperylenes (dap), 3,3'-disubstituted 1,1'- bisisoquinoline (bis), 5,8-dimethoxy-substituted diazaperylene (meodap), 6,6'- dimethoxy-substituted bisisoquinoline (meobis) and 2,9-dimethyl-1,10-phenanthroline (dmphen). Collision-induced decomposition measurements were applied to evaluate the relative stabilities of the different copper complexes. The influence of the spatial arrangement of the ligands, of the type of substituents and of the counter ion of the copper salts employed for the complexation was examined. Correlations were found between the binding constants of the [ML(2)](+) complexes in solution and the relative stabilities of the analogous complexes in the gas phase. Furthermore, complexation with the ligands 2,11-dialkylated 1,12-diazaperylenes [alkyl = ethyl (dedap) and isopropyl (dipdap)] was studied in the solvents CH(3)OH and CH(3)CN.",M1
20389578,"Impact of vertical stratification of inherent optical properties on radiative transfer in a plane-parallel turbid medium.The atmosphere is often divided into several homogeneous layers in simulations of radiative transfer in plane-parallel media. This artificial stratification introduces discontinuities in the vertical distribution of the inherent optical properties at boundaries between layers, which result in discontinuous radiances and irradiances at layer interfaces, which lead to errors in the radiative transfer simulations. To investigate the effect of the vertical discontinuity of the atmosphere on radiative transfer simulations, a simple two layer model with only aerosols and molecules and no <e>gas</e> absorption is used. The results show that errors larger than 10% for radiances and several percent for irradiances could be introduced if the atmosphere is not layered properly.",M1
20380433,"Anaerobic biodegradation of BTEX by original bacterial communities from an underground <e>gas</e> storage aquifer.BTEX biodegradation by an indigenous deep subsurface microbial community was evaluated in a water sample collected in the area of an underground gas storage. Five different sulfate-reducing microbial communities able to use at least either benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, or xylene (BTEX) compounds were studied. A total of 21 different bacterial phylotypes were identified, each community containing three to nine bacterial phylotypes. Archaeal phylotypes were retrieved from only three communities. The analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences showed that i) these consortia were mainly composed of novel species, some of which belonging to bacterial groups not previously suspected to be involved in BTEX anaerobic degradation, ii) three consortia were dominated by an uncultured Pelobacter sp. previously detected in biodegraded oil reservoirs, iii) a deeply branching species distantly affiliated to Thermotogales was abundant in two consortia, and that iv) Firmicutes related to the Desulfotomaculum and Carboxydocella genera represented the only three detectable phylotypes in a toluene-degrading consortium. This work shows that subdominant microbial populations present in a deep subsurface aquifer used for seasonal underground gas storage could be involved in the natural attenuation of the traces of BTEX coinjected with methane in the deep subsurface.",M1

20365700,"<e>Gas</e>-liquid critical parameters of asymmetric models of ionic fluids.The effects of size and charge asymmetry on the gas-liquid critical parameters of a primitive model (PM) of ionic fluids are studied within the framework of the statistical field theory based on the collective variables method. Recently, this approach has enabled us to obtain the correct trends of the both critical parameters of the equisize charge-asymmetric PM without assuming ionic association. In this paper, we focus on the general case of an asymmetric PM characterized by the two parameters: hard-sphere diameter, lambda=sigma+/sigma-, and charge, z=q+/|q-|, ratios of the two ionic species. We derive an explicit expression for the chemical potential conjugate to the order parameter which includes the effects of correlations up to the third order. Based on this expression we consider the three versions of PM: a monovalent size-asymmetric PM (lambda not equal 1, z=1) , an equisize charge-asymmetric PM (lambda=1, z not equal 1) and a size- and charge-asymmetric PM (lambda not equal 1, z=2) . Similar to simulations, our theory predicts that the critical temperature and the critical density decrease with the increase in size asymmetry. Regarding the effects of charge asymmetry, we obtain the correct trend of the critical temperature with z , while the trend of the critical density obtained in this approximation is inconsistent with simulations, as well as with our previous results found in the higher-order approximation. We expect that the consideration of the higher-order correlations will lead to the correct trend of the critical density with charge asymmetry.",M1
20365571,"Interferometric enhancement of x-ray reflectivity from unperturbed Langmuir monolayers of amphiphiles at the liquid-<e>gas</e> interface.Langmuir monolayers provide an important system for the investigation of the intramolecular structure and intermolecular ordering of organic and bio-organic macromolecular amphiphiles at an interface between polar and nonpolar media, e.g., the liquid-gas interface. Specular x-ray and neutron reflectivity have contributed substantially to these investigations. However, these reflectivity techniques are generally limited by the absence of crucial phase information, the relatively small contribution of the amphiphile to the scattering-length density contrast across the interface, and the relatively limited range of momentum transfer available perpendicular to the interface. Although several procedures have been developed to provide model-independent solutions to the phase problem, there remains a limited ability to distinguish features of slightly differing contrast (i.e., the  sensitivity ) as well as their minimum allowable separation (i.e., the  spatial resolution ) along the length of the scattering-length density profile derived from the reflectivity data via solution to the phase problem. Here, we demonstrate how the well-known interferometric approach can be extended to the structural investigation of otherwise unperturbed Langmuir monolayers of these amphiphiles to provide a direct solution to the phase problem and importantly, substantially enhance both the sensitivity and the spatial resolution in the derived profiles.",M1
20365360,"Computation of accommodation coefficients and the use of velocity correlation profiles in molecular dynamics simulations.For understanding the behavior of a <e>gas</e> close to a channel wall it is important to model the gas-wall interactions as detailed as possible. When using molecular dynamics simulations these interactions can be modeled explicitly, but the computations are time consuming. Replacing the explicit wall with a wall model reduces the computational time but the same characteristics should still remain. Elaborate wall models, such as the Maxwell-Yamamoto model or the Cercignani-Lampis model need a phenomenological parameter (the accommodation coefficient) for the description of the gas-wall interaction as an input. Therefore, computing these accommodation coefficients in a reliable way is very important. In this paper, two systems (platinum walls with either argon or xenon gas confined between them) are investigated and are used for comparison of the accommodation coefficients for the wall models and the explicit molecular dynamics simulations. Velocity correlations between incoming and outgoing particles colliding with the wall have been used to compare explicit simulations and wall models even further. Furthermore, based on these velocity correlations, a method to compute the accommodation coefficients is presented, and these newly computed accommodation coefficients are used to show improved correlation behavior for the wall models.",M1
20365166,"Unusual diffusion in a quasi-two-dimensional granular <e>gas</e>.We have studied diffusion in a quasi-two-dimensional granular gas composed of plastic balls confined in a vertically vibrating thin box. The horizontal motion of the balls in the box is found to follow the Langevin equation with the top and bottom of the box acting on the balls with a viscous drag like that in a fluid. Surprisingly, we find that both the granular temperature and the diffusion constant increase with the number of balls (N) in the box for small N . The unusual diffusion can be explained by a two-state model, in which a ball is in contact with two effective temperature baths due to collisions with the top or bottom of the box and collisions with other balls.",M1
20365136,"Nucleation stage with nonsteady growth of supercritical <e>gas</e> bubbles in a strongly supersaturated liquid solution and the effect of excluded volume.An approach to the kinetics of barrier formation of supercritical gas bubbles in a strongly supersaturated liquid solution is presented. A common assumption of uniform reduction of a dissolved gas supersaturation in a liquid solution via stationary diffusion to nucleating gas bubbles is shown to be not applicable to the case of high gas supersaturations. The approach recognizes that the diffusion growth of supercritical bubbles at high gas supersaturation is essentially nonstationary. Nonstationary growth of an individual gas bubble is described by a self-similar solution of the diffusion equation which predicts a renormalized growth rate and thin highly nonuniform diffusion layer around the bubble. The depletion of a dissolved gas due to intake of gas molecules by the bubble occurs only within this thin layer. An integral equation for the total volume of an ensemble of supercritical gas bubbles within a liquid solution is derived. This equation describes the effect of excluding a total volume of the depleted diffusion layers around the growing bubbles nucleated at all previous moments of time until nucleation of new bubbles ceases due to elimination of the nondepleted volume of the solution. An analytical solution of this equation is found. The swelling of the liquid solution, the number of gas bubbles nucleated, the distribution function of bubbles in their sizes, and the mean radius of the bubbles are determined in their dependence on time.",M1

The sign of DeltaTc depends on whether the potential or the surface charge density is held constant assuming that the dielectric material fills the space between capacitor plates. Our own as well as previous literature data for DeltaTc are compared to and interpreted in terms of a simple mean field theory.

The latter ties the sign of DeltaTc to the outside constraints via the electric field dependence of the orientation part of the mean field free energy.",M1
20364952,"Hard versus soft dynamics for adsorption-desorption kinetics: Exact results in one-dimension.The adsorption-desorption kinetics is discussed in the framework of the kinetic lattice-<e>gas</e> model. The master equation formalism has been introduced to describe the evolution of the system, where the transition probabilities are written as an expansion of the occupation configurations of all neighboring sites. Since the detailed balance principle determines half of the coefficients that arise from the expansion, it is necessary to introduce ad hoc, a dynamic scheme to get the rest of them. Three schemes of the so-called hard dynamics, in which the probability of transition from single site cannot be factored into a part which depends only on the interaction energy and one that only depends on the field energy, and five schemes of the so-called soft dynamics, in which this factorization is possible, were introduced for this purpose. It is observed that for the hard dynamic schemes, the equilibrium and nonequilibrium observables, such as adsorption isotherms, sticking coefficients, and thermal desorption spectra, have a normal or physical sustainable behavior. While for the soft dynamics schemes, with the exception of the transition state theory, the equilibrium and nonequilibrium observables have several problems. Some of them can be regarded as abnormal behavior.",M1
20364239,"Sorptive removal of odorous carbonyl gases by water.In this study, the removal capacity of deionized water was investigated against five gaseous carbonyl compounds (i.e., acetaldehyde, propionaldehyde, butyraldehyde, valeraldehyde, and isovaleraldehyde) by means of the <e>gas</e> stripping method. To determine the trapping behavior of these odorants by water, gaseous working standards prepared at three different concentration levels (i.e., for acetaldehyde around 300, 500, and 1,000 ppb) were forced through pure water contained in an impinger at room temperature. The removal efficiency of the target compounds was inspected in terms of two major variables: (1) concentration levels of gaseous standard and (2) impinger water volume (20, 50, 100, and 150 mL). Although the extent of removal was affected fairly sensitively by changes in water volume, this was not the case for standard concentration level changes. Considering the efficiency of sorption media, gas stripping with aqueous solution can be employed as an effective tool for the removal of carbonyl odorants.",M1

The binary vapor-liquid coexistence curves of the CO(2)/acetic acid mixtures were calculated at 313.2, 333.2, and 353.2 K and are in excellent agreement with experimental measurements. Two sets of rigorous hydrogen-bonding criteria were established for the hydrogen bonding at the hydroxyl oxygen and carbonyl oxygen, respectively.

Its self-reaction and interactions with HNOx (x = 1-3).The gas-phase redox reactions of HOCl with its self and HNO(x) (x = 1-3) have been studied theoretically by ab initio quantum chemical and statistical mechanical theories. The structures of reactants, intermediate complexes, products, and transition states were optimized at the MPW1PW91/6-311+G(3df,2p) level of theory. The potential energy surface of each reaction was refined at the CCSD(T)/6-311+G(3df,2p) level of theory. The most favorable products are predicted to be ClClO + H(2)O and ClOCl + H(2)O for the HOCl self-reaction (A), H(2)O + Cl + NO for the HOCl + HNO reaction (B), H(2)O + ClNO(2) for the HOCl + HONO-t reaction (C), H(2)O + cis-ClONO for the HOCl + HONO-c reaction (D). For the HOCl + HONO(2) reaction (E), only one dehydration reaction channel was considered to produce H(2)O + ClONO(2). The rate constants of all above five reactions have been predicted at 300-3000 K by the VTST/RRKM theory. The calculation shows that the theoretical rate constants are within the upper limits of experimental results.

20359454,"Production of biofuels from synthesis <e>gas</e> using microbial catalysts.World energy consumption is expected to increase 44% in the next 20 years. Today, the main sources of energy are oil, coal, and natural gas, all fossil fuels. These fuels are unsustainable and contribute to environmental pollution. Biofuels are a promising source of sustainable energy. Feedstocks for biofuels used today such as grain starch are expensive and compete with food markets. Lignocellulosic biomass is abundant and readily available from a variety of sources, for example, energy crops and agricultural/industrial waste. Conversion of these materials to biofuels by microorganisms through direct hydrolysis and fermentation can be challenging. Alternatively, biomass can be converted to synthesis gas through gasification and transformed to fuels using chemical catalysts. Chemical conversion of synthesis gas components can be expensive and highly susceptible to catalyst poisoning, limiting biofuel yields. However, there are microorganisms that can convert the CO, H(2), and CO(2) in synthesis gas to fuels such as ethanol, butanol, and hydrogen.

20359204,"<e>Gas</e> phase energetics of CN radicals in radio frequency discharges: influence on surface reaction probability during deposition of carbon nitride films.The CN radical has been implicated as an important contributor to the plasma deposition of amorphous carbon nitride. Here, laser-induced fluorescence and optical emission spectroscopy were used to explore in greater detail the gas phase energetics of CN in CH(3)CN, BrCN, and CH(4)/N(2) plasmas. Measurements of CN internal temperatures from these systems yield rotational temperatures well above 300 K, with notably higher ones for CN formed in BrCN plasmas, and vibrational temperatures of 4500-6000 K in all three systems. The data agree with the results of literature photodissociation experiments, and extension of those results to the plasma systems studied here provides insight into both the mechanisms for CN formation as well as the disposal of energy during fragmentation of the parent molecules. The internal energies of these species may influence their surface behavior; this issue is discussed in the context of previous work from our lab as well as others. The apparent trends not only offer a valuable perspective on the chemical dynamics of CN during the plasma deposition of a-CN(x) films but are also suggestive of a more general relationship between the energetics of plasma species and their behavior at surfaces.",M1
20358924,"Prediction of TiO2 thin film growth on the glass beads in a rotating plasma chemical vapor deposition reactor.We calculated the concentration profiles of important chemical species for TiO2 thin film growth on the glass beads in the TTIP + O2 plasmas and compared the predicted growth rates of thin films with the experimental measurements. The film thickness profile depends on the concentration profile of TiO(OC3H7)3 precursors in the <e>gas</e> phase because TiO(OC3H7)3 is the main precursor of the thin film. The TTIP concentration decreases with time, while the TiO(OC3H7)3 concentration increases, and they reach the steady state about 2 approximately 3 sec. The growth rate of TiO2 film predicted in this study was 9.2 nm/min and is in good agreements with the experimental result of 10.5 nm/min under the same process conditions. This study suggests that a uniform TiO2 thin film on particles can be obtained by using a rotating cylindrical PCVD reactor.",M1

20356136,"Flame synthesis of nanosized Cu-Ce-O, Ni-Ce-O, and Fe-Ce-O catalysts for the water-<e>gas</e> shift (WGS) reaction.A flame synthesis method has been used to prepare nanosized, high-surface-area Cu-Ce-O, Ni-Ce-O, and Fe-Ce-O catalysts from aqueous solutions of metal acetate precursors. The particles were formed by vaporization of the precursors followed by reaction and then gas to particle conversion. The specific surface areas of the synthesized powders ranged from 127 to 163 m(2)/g. High-resolution transmission electron microscope imaging showed that the particle diameters for the ceria materials are in the range of 3-10 nm, and a thin layer of amorphous material was observed on the surface of the particles. The presence and surface enrichment of the transition-metal oxides (CuO, NiO, and Fe(2)O(3)) on the ceria particles were detected using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Electron energy-loss spectroscopic studies suggest the formation of a core-shell structure in the as-prepared particles. Extended X-ray absorption fine structure studies suggest that the dopants in all M-Ce-O systems are almost isostructural with their oxide counterparts, indicating the doping materials form separate oxide phases (CuO, Fe(2)O(3), NiO) within the host matrix (CeO(2)). Etching results confirm that most of the transition-metal oxides are present on the surface of CeO(2), easily dissolved by nitric acid. The performance of the flame-synthesized catalysts was examined toward water-gas shift (WGS) activity for fuel processing applications. The WGS activity of metal ceria catalysts decreases in the order Cu-Ce-O &gt; Ni-Ce-O &gt; Fe-Ce-O &gt; CeO(2) with a feed mixture having a hydrogen to carbon monoxide (H(2)/CO) ratio of 1.

A PC film was placed in the apparatus. Both sides were exposed to oxygen until the film was saturated. To simulate inert <e>gas</e> purging of a closed container or  microenvironment , oxygen was pumped from one side of the apparatus to reduce the concentration on that side to nearly zero. Oxygen concentrations on the freshly purged side rose quickly at first but then slowed. Eventually, a steady state was established and oxygen concentrations increased linearly with time. Mass-transport coefficients (permeation, diffusion, and solubility coefficients) were also estimated and then used to successfully predict the postpurge rise of the oxygen concentration.",M1
20355695,"Greenhouse <e>gas</e> and carbon profile of the u.s. Forest products industry value chain.A greenhouse gas and carbon accounting profile was developed for the U.S. forest products industry value chain for 1990 and 2004-2005 by examining net atmospheric fluxes of CO(2) and other greenhouse gases (GHGs) using a variety of methods and data sources. Major GHG emission sources include direct and indirect (from purchased electricity generation) emissions from manufacturing and methane emissions from landfilled products. Forest carbon stocks in forests supplying wood to the industry were found to be stable or increasing. Increases in the annual amounts of carbon removed from the atmosphere and stored in forest products offset about half of the total value chain emissions. Overall net transfers to the atmosphere totaled 91.8 and 103.5 TgCO(2)-eq. in 1990 and 2005, respectively, although the difference between these net transfers may not be statistically significant. Net transfers were higher in 2005 primarily because additions to carbon stored in forest products were less in 2005. Over this same period, energy-related manufacturing emissions decreased by almost 9% even though forest products output increased by approximately 15%. Several types of avoided emissions were considered separately and were collectively found to be notable relative to net emissions.",M1

The studies show two dissociation pathways for the AMP ions indicating dominant ergodic pathways in the photodissociation of these species. The photofragmentation was determined to be a single photon process for the AMP ions. Photodetachment of the AMP anion excited at 266 nm was not observed, leaving dissociation as the prominent pathway for relaxation of the excess energy in the biomolecule. The photofragments were analysed at the electrostatic ion storage ring (ELISA) and found to be similar to collision induced fragments in the case of anions but different in the case of cations.",M1
20352812,"Effect of a sintering process on the electrical properties of SnO2 <e>gas</e> sensors.SnO2 is a widely used sensor material that exhibits high sensitivity. It is known for its complex sensing characteristics, and its microstructure is an important parameter related to electrical properties and mechanical rigidity. Understanding of its microstructural effects is therefore essential to examine sensing mechanisms that may apply to industrial devices. In this work, the effect of a sintering process on the electrical properties is investigated. The sintering temperature and the relative density were chosen as process variables. The grain size of the specimen increased as the sintering temperature increased, whereas the relative density did not change. The apparent activation energy for conduction varied as the compacting pressure and the sintering conditions changed. Samples with a high density and large particle size showed low activation energy for conduction and low sensitivity at 375 degrees C. In an attempt to improve the properties, the powder was heat-treated at 1000 degrees C for 10 hours before compacting and sintering. The samples with heat-treated powder showed a slight decrease in the activation energy depending on the density and comparable sensitivity compared to non-treated powder at a high density. Pre-treatment of powder can be a simple means of thermal stability under high operating temperatures.",M1
20352675,"Infrared multiple photon dissociation spectroscopy of cationized  methionine: effects of alkali-metal cation size on <e>gas</e>-phase  conformation.The gas-phase structures of alkali-metal cation complexes of the amino acid methionine (Met) as well as protonated methionine are investigated using infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy utilizing light generated by a free electron laser. Spectra of Li(+)(Met) and Na(+)(Met) are similar and relatively simple, whereas the spectra of K(+)(Met), Rb(+)(Met), and Cs(+)(Met) include distinctive new bands. Measured IRMPD spectra are compared to spectra calculated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory to identify the conformations present in the experimental studies. For Li(+) and Na(+) complexes, the only conformation present is a charge-solvated, tridentate structure that binds the metal cation to the amine and carbonyl groups of the amino acid backbone and the sulfur atom of the side chain, [N,CO,S]. In addition to the [N,CO,S] conformer, bands corresponding to alkali-metal cation binding to a bidentate zwitterionic structure, [CO(2)(-)], are clearly present for the K(+), Rb(+), and Cs(+) complexes. Theoretical calculations of the lowest energy conformations of Rb(+) and Cs(+) complexes suggest that the experimental spectra could also include contributions from two additional charge-solvated structures, tridentate [COOH,S] and bidentate [COOH]. For H(+)(Met), the IRMPD action spectrum is reproduced by multiple low-energy [N,CO,S] conformers, in which the protonated amine group hydrogen bonds to the carbonyl oxygen atom and the sulfur atom of the amino acid side chain. These [N,CO,S] conformers only differ in their side-chain orientations.",M1

Diprotonated chlorine and diprotonated bromine dications 3a and 6a, respectively, were found to be lowest energy minima. The isomeric dications, 3b and 6b, are also minima on the potential energy surfaces but they are significantly less stable than the structures 3a and 6a by 33.6 and 30.9 kcal/mol, respectively. On the basis of computed G2 energies, proton affinities and related thermodynamic parameters were also calculated. Dications 3a and 6a have substantial kinetic barriers for deprotonation. Their homolytic dissociation are however facile. Dimethylated molecular chlorine and bromine dications 3g and 6g, respectively, were also found to be global energy minima. These vicinal dihalonium or the corresponding protosolvated species are expected to form either in the superacidic media or in the <e>gas</e> phase.",M1
20348599,"Hydrogen <e>gas</e> sensing properties of PdO thin films with nano-sized cracks.We report on a novel method for the fabrication of highly sensitive hydrogen gas sensors based on palladium oxide thin films and have investigated their hydrogen sensing properties and nanostructures. To our knowledge, this is the first report on the use of palladium oxide and reduced palladium thin films as hydrogen sensors. The palladium oxide thin films were deposited on thermally oxidized Si substrates using a reactive direct current (DC) magnetron sputtering system. Considerable changes in the resistance of the palladium oxide thin films were observed when they were initially exposed to hydrogen gas, as a result of the reduction process. After the initial exposure to hydrogen gas of PdO(30%), its sensitivity increased up to approximately 4.5 x 10(3)%. The morphology of the PdO surface was analyzed using a scanning electron microscope (SEM), in order to investigate the interactions between palladium oxide and hydrogen. The SEM images showed a large number of nano-sized cracks on the surface of the palladium oxide during the reduction process, which acted to increase the effective surface-to-volume ratio. The response behaviors of the reduced Pd films to hydrogen gas were reversible and had an enhanced sensing property when compared with those of the pure Pd films. In addition, their sensitivities and response times were improved due to the nano-sized cracks on the surfaces. The results demonstrate that palladium oxide and reduced palladium thin films can be applied for use in highly sensitive hydrogen sensors.",M1
20346485,"Seasonal variation, sources and <e>gas</e>/particle partitioning of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons in Guangzhou, China.Air samples were collected weekly at an urban site and a suburban site in Guangzhou City, China, from April 2005 to March 2006, to measure the concentrations of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the ambient air and study their seasonal variations, gas/particle partitioning, origins and sources. The concentrations of summation Sigma16-PAHs (particle+gas) were 129.9+/-73.1 ng m(-)(3) at the urban site and 120.4+/-48.5 ng m(-)(3) at the suburban site, respectively. It was found that there was no significant difference in PAH concentrations between the urban and suburban sites. Seasonal variations of PAH concentrations at the two sampling sites were similar, with higher levels in the winter that gradually decreased to the lowest levels in the summer. The average concentrations of summation Sigma16-PAHs in the winter samples were approximately three times higher than those of the summer samples because in the summer local emissions dominated, and in the winter the contribution from outside sources or transported PAHs is increased. The plot of logK(p) versus logP(L)(0) for the data sets of summer and winter season samples had significantly different slopes at both sampling sites. The slopes for the winter samples were steeper than those for the summer samples. It was also observed that gas/particle partitioning of PAHs showed different characteristics depending on air parcel trajectories. Steeper slopes were obtained for an air parcel that traveled across the continent to the sampling site from the northern or northeastern sector, whereas shallower slopes were obtained for air masses that traveled across the sea from the southern or eastern sector. Diagnostic ratio analytical results imply that the origins of PAHs were mainly from petroleum combustion and coal/biomass burning. The anthracene/phenanthrene and benzo[a]anthracene/chrysene ratios in the winter were significantly lower than those in the summer, which indicate that there might be long-range transported PAH input to Guangzhou in the winter.",M1
20337464,"Photocatalytic degradation of chlorinated ethanes in the <e>gas</e> phase on the porous TiO(2) pellets: effect of surface acidity.The photocatalytic degradation of chlorinated ethanes was studied in a tubular photoreactor packed with TiO(2) pellets prepared by sol-gel method. The steady-state condition was not obtained, but the deterioration in the photocatalytic activity was observed during the irradiation. Effects of mole fractions of water vapor, O(2), and C(2)H(5)Cl or C(2)H(4)Cl(2) and reaction temperature on the photodegradation of C(2)H(5)Cl or C(2)H(4)Cl(2) were examined, and these data were compared with those obtained by the photodegradation of chlorinated ethylenes. On the basis of the products detected with and without oxygen in the reactant's gas stream, we proposed the degradation mechanism. Measurement of diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform spectroscopy of pyridine adsorbed on the catalysts showed that decrease in the conversion for the photodegradation of C(2)H(5)Cl was attributable to the formation of Brønsted acid sites. Comparison of the data obtained with the TiO(2) and the sulfated TiO(2) (SO(4)(2-)/TiO(2)) pellets indicated that the photodegradation of C(2)H(5)Cl was suppressed by the presence of the Brønsted sites, but that of trichloroethylene was not affected. Such a difference is attributable to the adsorption process of these reactants on the acid sites on the catalyst surface.",M1

The mid-IR spectra (1100-1800 cm(-1)) of these mass-selected anionic species have been recorded by means of resonant infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy performed with the free-electron laser CLIO. Structural assignment has been achieved through comparisons with the low-energy conformers obtained from replica-exchange molecular dynamics simulations, for which IR spectra were calculated using a hybrid quantum mechanics/semi-empirical (QM/SE) method at the DFT/B3LYP/6-31+G*/AM1 level. Comparison between deprotonated vancomycin and its non-covalently bound V + Ac(2)(L)K(D)A(D)A complex shows significant spectral shifts of the carboxylate stretches and the Amide I and Amide II modes that are satisfactorily reproduced in the structures known from the condensed phase. Both theoretical and experimental findings provide strong evidence that the native structure of the deprotonated V + Ac(2)(L)K(D)A(D)A complex is preserved in the gas phase.",M1
20336257,"Binding a heparin derived disaccharide to defensin inspired peptides: insights to antimicrobial inhibition from <e>gas</e>-phase measurements.Due to the ubiquitous presence of polysaccharide moieties on bacterial surfaces, it is hypothesised that a peptide-saccharide interaction plays a key role during the recognition of invading microorganisms by beta-defensins. We have employed different gas-phase methods to investigate these interactions. This manuscript describes: an MS-based titration assay measuring the gas-phase binding of ten beta-defensin related peptides to a sulfated disaccharide derived from heparin (HDD); ion mobility-mass spectrometry-determined collision cross sections of 3 peptides (both free and binding HDD); and results from molecular modelling with the aim of reconciling some of our experimental observations. We observe a clear qualitative correlation between the antimicrobial activity of several beta-defensins and related peptides and their gas-phase binding to a heparin-derived disaccharide (HDD). Four of the ten peptides show &gt;100 micromolar K(d) values with HDD, and no bacteriocidal activity, illustrating that HDD binding correlates with peptide antimicrobial activity. For five of the remaining six peptides, bacteriocidal activity was re-measured with HDD present. For the peptides containing intramolecular disulfide bonds in two out of five, bacteriocidal activity was reduced approximately 10-fold; for the remaining three peptides, which lack intramolecular disulfide bonds, HDD addition had little effect on bacteriocidal activity. The latter results are suggested to arise from the greater degree of flexibility imparted by the removal of disulfide bonds giving the peptides the ability to envelope HDD and assume a  defensin-like  fold. Thus gas-phase analysis is put forward as a powerful tool for assessing the properties of antimicrobial peptides providing valuable insights in the mechanism of antimicrobial inhibition.",M1

Solid aspartic acid (m.p. &gt; 300 degrees C) was vaporized by laser ablation and expanded in a supersonic jet where rotational spectra of various conformers were obtained by Fourier transform microwave spectroscopy. Six different conformers have been conclusively identified by their distinct rotational and (14)N nuclear quadrupole coupling constants.

20336248,"Structure of the <e>gas</e>-phase glycine tripeptide.The structural preferences of the neutral gas-phase glycine tripeptide have been investigated using a variety of strategies including a hierarchy of electronic structure theory (encompassing HF/3-21G single-point energy calculation and geometry optimisation, B3LYP/6-31G(d) geometry optimisation and MP2/6-31+G(d) single-point energy calculation and/or geometry optimisation). The structures and relative stabilities of the 20 most stable conformers identified were verified by M05-2X and mPW2-PLYP-D calculations. The most stable conformer located has a folded gamma-turn structure, with an NH...N interaction between the N-terminal nitrogen and the amide hydrogen of glycine (2) and an NH...O interaction between the amide hydrogen of glycine (3) and the carboxyl oxygen of glycine (1). The results show a clear preference for folded over extended structures.",M1
20336246,"Infrared vibrational spectra as a structural probe of gaseous ions formed by caffeine and theophylline.Ionic hydrogen bond (IHB) interactions, resulting from the association of ammonia and the two protonated methylxanthine derivatives, caffeine and theophylline, have been characterized using infrared multiphoton dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations at the MP2/aug-cc-pVTZ//B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. The proton-bound dimer (PBD) of caffeine and ammonia exhibits a low binding energy and was found to be elusive under the experimental conditions due, most probably, to collision-induced dissociation of the complex with helium buffer <e>gas</e> before IRMPD irradiation. The IRMPD spectrum of a PBD of theophylline and ammonia was obtained and revealed bidentate IHB formation within the complex, which greatly increased the binding energy relative to the most stable isomer of the PBD of caffeine and ammonia. The IRMPD spectra of the protonated forms of caffeine and theophylline have also been obtained. The spectrum of protonated caffeine showed dominant protonation at the N(9) site, whereas the spectrum of protonated theophylline showed a mixture of two isomers. The first protonated isomer of theophylline exhibits protonation at the N(9) site and the second isomer demonstrated protonation at the C(6) carbonyl oxygen. The protonated carbonyl isomer of theophylline cannot be produced as a result of direct protonation and is thus suggested to be a consequence of proton-transport catalysis (PTC) initiated by the electrostatic interaction between water and N(9) protonated theophylline. Calculated anharmonic spectra have been simulated at the B3LYP/6-311+G(d,p) level of theory. It is shown that calculated anharmonic frequencies significantly outperform calculated harmonic frequencies in providing simulated IRMPD spectra in all cases.",M1
20336243,"Theoretical spectroscopy of floppy peptides at room temperature. A DFTMD perspective: <e>gas</e> and aqueous phase.Theoretical spectroscopy is mandatory for a precise understanding and assignment of experimental spectra recorded at finite temperature. We review here room temperature DFT-based molecular dynamics simulations for the purpose of interpreting finite temperature infrared spectra of peptides of increasing size and complexity, in terms of temperature-dependent conformational dynamics and flexibility, and vibrational anharmonicities (potential energy surface anharmonicities, vibrational mode couplings and dipole anharmonicities). We take examples from our research projects in order to illustrate the main key-points and strengths of dynamical spectra modeling in that context. The calculations are presented in relation to room temperature gas phase IR-MPD experiments and room temperature liquid phase IR absorption experiments. These illustrations of floppy polypeptides have been chosen in order to convey the following ideas: temperature-dependent spectra modeling is pivotal for a precise understanding of gas phase spectra recorded at room temperature, including conformational dynamics and vibrational anharmonicities; harmonic spectroscopy (as commonly performed in the literature) can be misleading and even erroneous for a proper interpretation of spectra recorded at finite temperature; taking into account vibrational anharmonicities is pivotal for a proper interplay between theory and experiments; amide I-III bands are not necessarily the most relevant fingerprints for unraveling the local structures of peptides and more complex systems; liquid phase simulations have unraveled relationships between the zwitterionic properties of the peptide bonds and infrared signatures. The review presents a state-of-the-art account of the domain and offers perspectives and new developments for future still more challenging applications.",M1
20334894,"Chemically enhanced phytoextraction of Pb by wheat in texturally different soils.A pot study was used to examine the effects of amendments such as EDTA and elemental sulfur on the growth potential, <e>gas</e> exchange features, uptake and mobilization of Pb by wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) in two texturally different contaminated soils at three levels of EDTA (2, 4, 8 mmol kg(-1) dry soil) and two levels of elemental sulfur (100, 200 mmol kg(-1) dry soil). EDTA resulted in more solubilization of Pb than elemental sulfur in both soils. Application of EDTA and elemental sulfur increased shoot dry matter in the loamy sand soil, whereas in the sandy clay loam soil EDTA treated plants produced lower shoot dry matter compared to that observed with elemental sulfur. Application of EDTA 10d prior to harvest increased the amount of Pb accumulated into wheat shoots with more Pb accumulated by plants from the loamy sand than from the sandy clay loam soil. However, evaluation of the relative extraction efficiency expressed as the percentage of solubilized Pb that is subsequently also effectively accumulated by the plant shoots reveals that the relatively low efficiency does not warrant the massive mobilization induced by the environmentally persistent EDTA chelator. More modest mobilization of Pb induced by elemental sulfur and the higher relative extraction of mobilized Pb therefore deserves further attention in future research. In particular, attention needs to be paid to determining soil types in which elemental sulfur can induce significant impact on soil pH and metal mobility after application of a practically realistic dosage.",M1
20329749,"Patterned electrode-based amperometric <e>gas</e> sensor for direct nitric oxide detection within microfluidic devices.This article describes a thin amperometric nitric oxide (NO) sensor that can be microchannel embedded to enable direct real-time detection of NO produced by cells cultured within the microdevice. A key for achieving the thin ( approximately 1 mm) planar sensor configuration required for sensor-channel integration is the use of gold/indium-tin oxide patterned electrode directly on a porous polymer membrane (pAu/ITO) as the base working electrode. The electrochemically deposited Au-hexacyanoferrate layer on pAu/ITO is used to catalyze NO oxidation to nitrite at lower applied potentials (0.65-0.75 V vs Ag/AgCl) and stabilize current output. Furthermore, use of a gas-permeable membrane to separate internal sensor compartments from the sample phase imparts excellent NO selectivity over common interfering agents (e.g., nitrite, ascorbate, ammonia, etc.) present in culture media and biological fluids. The optimized sensor design reversibly detects NO down to the approximately 1 nM level in stirred buffer and &lt;10 nM in flowing buffer when integrated within a polymeric microfluidic device. We demonstrate utility of the channel-embedded sensor by monitoring NO generation from macrophages cultured within non-gas-permeable microchannels, as they are stimulated with endotoxin.",M1
20309750,"Comparison of two tracer <e>gas</e> dilution methods for the determination of clothing ventilation and of vapour resistance.Clothing microclimate ventilation is an important parameter in climatic stress and in contaminated environments. The two main methods for its determination (Crockford et al. (CR) 1972 and Lotens and Havenith (LH) 1988) were, after further development, compared in terms of reproducibility, validity and usability. Both methods were shown to have a good sensitivity and reproducibility (with average coefficients of variation 1.5-2.3% for the method alone and up to 7% for method and clothing/movement effects combined). They produced values very close to calibration values in forced ventilation tests (r = 0.988). Weak points for the CR method were the limits in the time constant of the measurement apparatus, causing an upper limit to the ventilation that can be reliably measured (around 800 l/min) and the method of measuring clothing microclimate volume. The original 'vacuum oversuit' (CR) method was cumbersome and prone to large errors. Alternative methods of measuring clothing microclimate volume (whole body scanner or manual circumference measurements) were shown to produce good results. For the LH method, the distribution of the tracer gas over the whole skin surface became a problem factor at very high ventilations (above 1000 l/min). As all methods use tracer gases (O(2), Ar, CO(2), SF(6)) with diffusivities smaller than that of water vapour, this potentially creates a problem in the calculation of vapour resistance from the ventilation values in the region where the emphasis of vapour transfer moves from diffusion to convection. In most real-life situations, where body and air movement are present, a correction is not however required because the error remains below 10%. STATEMENT OF RELEVANCE: Clothing ventilation indicates heat loss potential as well as risk of pollutants entering the clothing. Two main methods for its determination are compared and validated, identifying a number of issues. An in-depth analysis is given of the advantages and disadvantages of the available methodologies.",M1

20306485,"Evaluation of tetracationic salts as <e>gas</e>-phase ion-pairing agents for the detection of trivalent anions in positive mode electrospray ionization mass spectrometry.In previous studies, new electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (ESI-MS) approaches were developed for the highly sensitive detection of singly and doubly charged anions in positive mode ESI-MS by using specially synthesized dicationic and tricationic ion-pairing agents, respectively. By detecting the positively charged ion complex in the positive mode, limits of detection (LODs) for the anions can be lowered by several magnitudes. In this work, we used eighteen newly synthesized tetracationic ion-pairing agents, constructed with different geometries, linkages and cation moieties, for the detection of eighteen triply charged anions of different structural motifs. The LODs for these anions were from ten to several thousand times lower in the positive selective ion monitoring (SIM) mode than in the negative mode. These tetracationic agents also were shown to be useful for the detection of -1 and -2 anions. In addition, the LODs for -3 anions can be further lowered by monitoring the product fragments of the ion-pairing complexes in the single reaction monitoring (SRM) mode.",M1
20302333,"Temperature dependence of Henry's law constant for hydrogen cyanide. Generation of trace standard gaseous hydrogen cyanide.Primary data for the temperature dependent solubility of HCN in water do not presently exist for low concentrations of HCN at environmentally or physiologically relevant temperatures. Henry's Law constant (K(H), M/atm) for the vapor-solution equilibrium of HCN was determined in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (adjusted to pH 9.00 +/- 0.03 at 296.6 +/- 0.1 K) from 287-311 K. Stable <e>gas</e> phase concentrations of HCN are generated by established techniques, via air equilibration of aqueous cyanide partitioned by a microporous membrane. The effluent gaseous HCN, in equilibrium with the constant temperature aqueous cyanide, was collected in dilute NaOH and determined by a spectrophotometrically using cobinamide.

20299239,"<e>Gas</e> phase structure of micro-hydrated [Mn(ClO4)]+ and [Mn2(ClO4)3]+ ions probed by infrared spectroscopy.Gas-phase infrared photodissociation spectroscopy is reported for the microsolvated [Mn(ClO(4))(H(2)O)(n)](+) and [Mn(2)(ClO(4))(3)(H(2)O)(n)](+) complexes from n = 2 to 5. Electrosprayed ions are isolated in an ion-trap where they are photodissociated. The 2600-3800 cm(-1) spectral region associated with the OH stretching mode is scanned with a relatively low-power infrared table-top laser, which is used in combination with a CO(2) laser to enhance the photofragmentation yield of these strongly bound ions. Hydrogen bonding is evidenced by a relatively broad band red-shifted from the free OH region. Band assignment based on quantum chemical calculations suggest that there is formation of water-perchlorate hydrogen bond within the first coordination shell of high-spin Mn(II). Although the observed spectral features are also compatible with the formation of structures with double-acceptor water in the second shell, these structures are found relatively high in energy compared with structures with all water directly bound to manganese. Using the highly intense IR beam of the free electron laser CLIO in the 800-1700 cm(-1), we were also able to characterize the coordination mode (eta(2)) of perchlorate for two clusters. The comparison of experimental and calculated spectra suggests that the perchlorate Cl-O stretches are unexpectedly underestimated at the B3LYP level, while they are correctly described at the MP2 level allowing for spectral assignment.",M1

In particular, the standard enthalpies of formation in the gas phase at 298.15 K for all of these species were determined. A reliable experimental estimation of the enthalpy associated with intramolecular hydrogen bonding in chelated species was experimentally obtained. The gas-phase acidities (GA) of benzophenones, substituted phenols, and several aliphatic alcohols are compared with the corresponding aqueous acidities (pK(a)), covering a range of 278 kJ.mol(-1) in GA and 11.4 in pK(a).

20234987,"[Combination of Intravitreal rTPA, <e>gas</e> and ranibizumab for extensive subfoveal haemorrhages secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration]BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcomes of the combination therapy with intravitreal recombinant tissue plasminogen activator (rTPA), gas and lucentis for patients with extensive subfoveal haemorrhages secondary to neovascular age-related macular degeneration (AMD). METHODS: In this retrospective clinical study 10 eyes with extensive subfoveal haemorrhages secondary to neovascular AMD were included and treated with intravitreal rTPA (0.05 mL; 0.025 mg/0.1 mL in 0.9% NaCl), 100% sulphur hexafluoride (SF(6)) gas (0.5 mL) and lucentis (0.05 mL, 10 mg/mL) within two weeks after the onset of the subretinal haemorrhage. Retreatments with lucentis were performed at 4-week intervals if there were persistent submacular haemorrhages or signs of active choroideal neovascularisation (CNV). The treatment effect was evaluated using best-corrected visual acuity (VA, Snellen), complete ophthalmic examination, fluorescein angiography (FLA) and optical coherence tomography (OCT). RESULTS: Mean observation period was 6.4 A+/- 3.7 months (range: 3 - 13 months). With regard to VA, in 7 eyes there was an increase in VA (&gt; or = 1 Snellen lines), in 1 eye a stabilisation and in 2 eyes a decrease in VA (&gt; or = 1 Snellen lines). At the end of follow-up time, with regard to VA no significant difference was observed compared to baseline (p = 0.41). In 1 patient an intra-operative transient central arterial occlusion and in another patient a corneal erosion and an increase of intraocular pressure up to 27 mmHg were observed after initial combination treatment. On average there were 1.9 A+/- 1.3 retreatments indicated after initial treatment. CONCLUSION: The combination of rTPA, gas and lucentis is a valuable therapy for extensive subfoveal haemorrhages secondary to neovascular AMD resulting in stabilisation of both VA and morphologic parameters.",M1
20222728,"Catalytic oxidation of benzene in the <e>gas</e> phase over alumina-supported silver catalysts.Catalytic properties of Ag/Al(2)O(3) for complete oxidation of benzene with ozone at 295-373 K were studied and compared with those of Mn/Al(2)O(3). At the reaction temperature of 295 K, the Ag/Al(2)O(3) catalysts showed selectivity to CO(x) (ca. 80%) higher than that of the oxide of metals in the first transition series (Fe, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu) supported on Al(2)O(3), which had selectivities of 28-62%. The catalyst showed gradual deactivation from accumulation of byproduct compounds on the catalyst surface. FTIR studies revealed that the byproduct compounds consisted of easily decomposable species and hardly decomposable species. The rate for benzene oxidation linearly increased with Ag loadings (approximately 15 wt %) and was not improved at higher loading levels. The ratios of ozone decomposition to benzene oxidation and ozone decomposition to CO(x) selectivity were evaluated to be 7.5 and 80%, respectively, and they were independent of benzene conversion. The Ag/Al(2)O(3) catalyst showed steady-state activities at a reaction temperature of 313-373 K, and the conversion increased with the increase in the reaction temperature. The presence of water vapor in the reaction gas inhibited the catalyst deactivation, and steady-state activity was obtained at a reaction temperature of 295 K, while it did not affect the activities for benzene oxidation but improved the CO(2) selectivity.",M1
20222526,"Effect of ethanol-gasoline blends on small engine generator energy efficiency and exhaust emission.This study was focused on fuel energy efficiency and pollution analysis of different ratios of ethanol-gasoline blended fuels (E0, E3, E6, and E9) under different loadings. In this research, the experimental system consisted of a small engine generator, a particulate matter measurement system, and an exhaust <e>gas</e> analyzer system. Different fuels, unleaded gasoline, and ethanol-gasoline blends (E0, E3, E6, and E9) were used to study their effects on the exhaust gas emission and were expressed as thermal efficiency of the small engine generator energy efficiency. The results suggested that particle number concentration increased as the engine loading increased; however, it decreased as the ethanol content in the blend increased. While using E6 as fuel, the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration was less than other fuels (E0, E3, and E9) for each engine loading. The average of CO concentration reduction by using E3, E6, and E9 is 42, 86, and 83%, respectively. Using an ethanol-gasoline blend led to a significant reduction in exhaust emissions by approximately 78.7, 97.5, and 89.46% of the mean average values of hydrocarbons (HCs) with E3, E6, and E9 fuels, respectively, for all engine loadings. Using an ethanol-gasoline blend led to a significant reduction in exhaust emissions by approximately 35, 86, and 77% of the mean average values of nitrogen oxides (NOx) with E3, E6, and E9 fuels, respectively, at each engine loading. The E6 fuel gave the best results of the exhaust emissions, and the E9 fuel gave the best results of the particle emissions and engine performance. The thermal efficiency of the small engine generator increased as the ethanol content in the blend increased and as the engine loading increased.",M1
20220898,"Enhancement of trace <e>gas</e> detection by integrating wavelength modulated spectra across multiple lines.We describe and demonstrate a technique that enhances the sensitivity of a spectrometer for trace gas detection by employing wavelength modulation spectroscopy (WMS) and integrating the absolute value of the recorded spectra across multiple lines of the species. The sensitivity is further enhanced by conducting WMS with large modulation depths. This technique is demonstrated using a continuously tunable external cavity CW quantum cascade laser to record the second harmonic wavelength modulated spectra of NO(2) across the peak of the R-branch from 1629.5 to 1633.9 cm(-1). By integrating the absolute value of the resulting spectra, the detection sensitivity of NO(2) is improved by a factor of 40 compared to the sensitivity achieved using single-line WMS with the same apparatus. By using this technique, we achieve a sensitivity of approximately 6 parts in 10(9) (ppb) using a short-path cell (a 1 m absorption cell with two passes).",M1
20220249,"Improvement of olfactometric measurement accuracy and repeatability by optimization of panel selection procedures.The EN 13725:2003, which standardizes the determination of odour concentration by dynamic olfactometry, fixes the limits for panel selection in terms of individual threshold towards a reference <e>gas</e> (n-butanol in nitrogen) and of standard deviation of the responses. Nonetheless, laboratories have some degrees of freedom in developing their own procedures for panel selection and evaluation. Most Italian olfactometric laboratories use a similar procedure for panel selection, based on the repeated analysis of samples of n-butanol at a concentration of 60 ppm. The first part of this study demonstrates that this procedure may originate a sort of  smartening  of the assessors, which means that they become able to guess the right answers in order to maintain their qualification as panel members, independently from their real olfactory perception. For this reason, the panel selection procedure has been revised with the aim of making it less repetitive, therefore preventing the possibility for panel members to be able to guess the best answers in order to comply with the selection criteria. The selection of new panel members and the screening of the active ones according to this revised procedure proved this new procedure to be more selective than the  standard  one. Finally, the results of the tests with n-butanol conducted after the introduction of the revised procedure for panel selection and regular verification showed an effective improvement of the laboratory measurement performances in terms of accuracy and precision.",M1
20220238,"An assessment of oxygen transfer efficiency in a <e>gas</e> permeable hollow fibre membrane biological reactor.The clean water oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE) of a full scale non-porous hollow fibre gas permeable (GP) membrane (surface area of 500 m(2)) was evaluated at inlet air pressures of 1.2, 1.4, and 1.8 atm using two established testing methods. To form a basis of comparison with traditional aeration technologies, additional testing was done with conventional aerators (fine bubble and coarse bubble diffusers) replacing the GP membrane. OTE can be established based on the re-aeration of deoxygenated water or by monitoring the catalytic oxidation of a sodium sulphite (Na(2)SO(3)) solution. In this study, OTE values determined by sulphite oxidation (SOTE(S)) were consistently higher than those established during re-aeration (SOTE(R)) suggesting that the chemical reaction was enhancing the mass transfer. The chemical reaction was sufficiently fast in the case of the GP membrane, that the gas phase limited the mass transfer. The GP membrane operating at 1.2 atm had a SOTE(S) of 70.6% and a SOTER of 52.2%. SOTE(R) for the coarse bubble and fine bubble diffusers were 3.8% and 23.6%, respectively. This is comparable to the manufacturer's values, corrected for depth of 3.4% and 18.3%, respectively. Particularly, the derived OTE values were used to evaluate differences in energy consumption for a conventional treatment plant achieving carbon removal and nitrification. This analysis highlights the potential energy efficiency of GP membranes, which could be considered for the design of the membrane modules.",M1
20218763,"Novel characterization of the aerosol and <e>gas</e>-phase composition of aerosolized jet fuel.Few robust methods are available to characterize the composition of aerosolized complex hydrocarbon mixtures. The difficulty in separating the droplets from their surrounding vapors and preserving their content is challenging, more so with fuels, which contain hydrocarbons ranging from very low to very high volatility. Presented here is a novel method that uses commercially available absorbent tubes to measure a series of hydrocarbons in the vapor and droplets from aerosolized jet fuels. Aerosol composition and concentrations were calculated from the differential between measured total (aerosol and gas-phase) and measured gas-phase concentrations. Total samples were collected directly, whereas gas-phase only samples were collected behind a glass fiber filter to remove droplets. All samples were collected for 1 min at 400 ml min(-1) and quantified using thermal desorption-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. This method was validated for the quantification of the vapor and droplet content from 4-h aerosolized jet fuel exposure to JP-8 and S-8 at total concentrations ranging from 200 to 1000 mg/m(3). Paired samples (gas-phase only and total) were collected every approximately 40 min. Calibrations were performed with neat fuel to calculate total concentration and also with a series of authentic standards to calculate specific compound concentrations. Accuracy was good when compared to an online GC-FID (gas chromatography-flame ionization detection) technique. Variability was 15% or less for total concentrations, the sum of all gas-phase compounds, and for most specific compound concentrations in both phases. Although validated for jet fuels, this method can be adapted to other hydrocarbon-based mixtures.",M1
20218631,"Probing 'spin-forbidden' oxygen-atom transfer: <e>gas</e>-phase reactions of chromium-porphyrin complexes.Oxygen-atom transfer reactions of metalloporphyrin species play an important role in biochemical and synthetic oxidation reactions. An emerging theme in this chemistry is that spin-state changes can play important roles, and a 'two-state' reactivity model has been extensively applied especially in iron porphyrin systems. Herein we explore the gas-phase oxygen-atom transfer chemistry of meso-tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)porphyrin (TPFPP) chromium complexes, as well as some other tetradentate macrocyclic ligands. Electrospray ionization in concert with Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance (FT-ICR) mass spectrometry has been used to characterize and observe reactivity of the ionic species [(TPFPP)Cr(III)](+) (1) and [(TPFPP)Cr(V)O](+) (2). These are attractive systems to examine the effects of spin-state change on oxygen-atom transfer because the d(1) Cr(V) species are doublets, while the Cr(III) complexes have quartet ground states with high-lying doublet excited states. In the gas phase, [(TPFPP)Cr(III)](+) forms adducts with a variety of neutral donors, but O-atom transfer is only observed for NO(2). Pyridine N-oxide adducts of 1 do yield 2 upon collision-induced dissociation (CID), but the ethylene oxide, DMSO, and TEMPO analogues do not. [(TPFPP)Cr(V)O](+) is shown by its reactivity and by CID experiments to be a terminal metal-oxo with a single, vacant coordination site. It also displays limited reaction chemistry, being deoxygenated only by the very potent reductant P(OMe)(3). In general, [(TPFPP)Cr(V)O](+) species are much less reactive than the Fe and Mn analogues. Thermochemical analysis of the reactions points toward the involvement of spin issues in the lower observed reactivity of the chromium complexes.",M1

20214398,"Effect of UV-ozone treatment on poly(dimethylsiloxane) membranes: surface characterization and <e>gas</e> separation performance.A thin SiO(x) selective surface layer was formed on a series of cross-linked poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) membranes by exposure to ultraviolet light at room temperature in the presence of ozone. The conversion of the cross-linked polysiloxane to SiO(x) was monitored by attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR) spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), energy-dispersive X-ray (EDX) microanalysis, contact angle analysis, and atomic force microscopy (AFM). The conversion of the cross-linked polysiloxane to SiO(x) increased with UV-ozone exposure time and cross-linking agent content, and the surface possesses highest conversion. The formation of a SiO(x) layer increased surface roughness, but it decreased water contact angle. Gas permeation measurements on the UV-ozone exposure PDMS membranes documented interesting gas separation properties: the O(2) permeability of the cross-linked PDMS membrane before UV-ozone exposure was 777 barrer, and the O(2)/N(2) selectivity was 1.9; after UV-ozone exposure, the permeability decreased to 127 barrer while the selectivity increased to 5.4. The free volume depth profile of the SiO(x) layer was investigated by novel slow positron beam. The results show that free volume size increased with the depth, yet the degree of siloxane conversion to SiO(x) does not affect the amount of free volume.",M1
20210357,"<e>Gas</e> phase measurements of pyruvic acid and its volatile metabolites.Pyruvic acid, central to leaf carbon metabolism, is a precursor of many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that impact air quality and climate. Although the pathways involved in the production of isoprenoids are well-known, those of several oxygenated VOCs remain uncertain. We present concentration and flux measurements of pyruvic acid and other VOCs within the tropical rainforest (TRF) biome at Biosphere 2. Pyruvic acid concentrations varied diurnally with midday maxima up to 15 ppbv, perhaps due to enhanced production rates and suppression of mitochondrial respiration in the light. Branch fluxes and ambient concentrations of pyruvic acid correlated with those of acetone, acetaldehyde, ethanol, acetic acid, isoprene, monoterpenes, and sesquiterpenes. While pyruvic acid is a known substrate for isoprenoid synthesis, this correlation suggests that the oxygenated VOCs may also derive from pyruvic acid, an idea supported by leaf feeding experiments with sodium pyruvate which resulted in large enhancements in emissions of both isoprenoids and oxygenated VOCs. While feeding with sodium pyruvate-2-(13)C resulted in large emissions of both (13)C-labeled isoprenoids and oxygenated VOCs, feeding with sodium pyruvate-1-(13)C resulted in only (13)C-labeled isoprenoids. This suggests that acetaldehyde, ethanol, and acetic acid are produced from pyruvic acid via the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) bypass system (in which the 1-C carbon of pyruvic acid is lost as CO(2)) and that acetone is also derived from the decarboxylation of pyruvic acid.",M1

We used ESI-MS competition experiments for the high throughput screening of the supramolecular interaction between four macrocyclic receptors and different peptide-like substrates in solution, rendering the best-fitted host-guest pairs. Further insights on the non-covalent recognition process in the gas-phase were obtained through collision induced dissociation (CID) experiments. Solution studies using NMR spectroscopy ((1)H NMR titrations, NOESY and DOSY) were carried out to prove the validity of ESI-MS as a high-throughput screening method for studying the molecular recognition of the investigated pseudopeptidic macrocycles. A clear selectivity for N-protected dipeptides over N-protected amino acids, and a slight preference for dipeptides bearing aromatic side chains were observed.

20201508,"Estimation and congener-specific characterization of polychlorinated naphthalene emissions from secondary nonferrous metallurgical facilities in China.Secondary nonferrous production is addressed as one of the potential sources of the unintentionally produced persistent organic pollutants (UP-POPs) due to the impurity of raw material. Although there are inventories of dioxin emissions from secondary nonferrous metallurgical facilities, release inventories of polychlorinated naphthalenes (PCNs) are scarce. This study selected typical secondary copper, aluminum, zinc, and lead plants to investigate the emissions of PCNs in secondary nonferrous production in China. The toxic equivalency (TEQ) emission factor for PCNs released to the environment is highest for secondary copper production, at 428.4 ng TEQ t(-1), followed by secondary aluminum, zinc, and lead production, at 142.8, 125.7, and 20.1 ng TEQ t(-1), respectively. PCNs released in secondary copper, aluminum, lead, and zinc production in China are estimated to be 0.86, 0.39, 0.009, and 0.01 g TEQ a(-1), respectively. Analysis of stack <e>gas</e> emission from secondary nonferrous production revealed that less-chlorinated PCNs are the dominant homologues, with mono- to tri-CNs making the most important contributions to the concentration. However, for fly ash, the more highly chlorinated PCNs such as octa-CN are the dominant homologues.",M1
20200735,"<e>Gas</e>-phase fluorescence excitation and emission spectroscopy of mass-selected trapped molecular ions.A flexible interface to perform optical spectroscopic measurements on gaseous ions stored in a modified commercial quadrupole ion trap (QIT) mass spectrometer is described. The modifications made to the mass spectrometer did not adversely affect its operating characteristics. Gas-phase ions are produced using electrospray ionization, mass isolated and stored in the trapping mass spectrometer. The ions are subsequently irradiated with visible light from a tunable laser and dispersed fluorescence spectra are recorded simultaneously. Mass spectra are recorded after the irradiation period. This set-up allows us to track a range of possible outcomes upon photoexcitation of selected ions including fluorescence, photofragmentation and photodetachment of electrons. The experimental set-up is characterized using rhodamine 590, which is a methyl ester variant of rhodamine 6G. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectra of gaseous rhodamine 590 are measured and compared with solution-phase spectra. Excitation and emission maxima for the gaseous ions are found to lie at higher energy than for the solvated rhodamine 590. In addition, the gas-phase Stokes shift is significantly smaller than the solution-phase Stokes shift. The effects of several experimental parameters on the observed fluorescence signal are investigated, including laser power, relative number of ions, q(z) trapping parameter and buffer gas pressure. In addition to its use for the photophysical characterization of the intrinsic properties of ionic chromophores, this set-up may be used to investigate the properties of mass-selected, dye-labeled biomolecules, both alone and in well-defined complexes and clusters.",M1

20187085,"The reactions of H(3)O(+), NO(+) and O(2) (+) with several flavourant esters studied using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry.The reactions of H(3)O(+), NO(+), and O(2) (+) with nineteen ester compounds occurring naturally in plants, and having important flavourant properties, were examined using selected ion flow tube mass spectrometry (SIFT-MS). The H(3)O(+) reactions primarily generate [R(1)COOR(2).H](+), and may also produce [R(2)](+) fragment ions and/or fragmentation within the ester linkage. Collisional association/adduct ions, [R(1)COOR(2).NO](+), are the main products formed in the NO(+) reactions, although the carboxyl fragment ion is also detected frequently. The identification of the parent compound may be made more easily in the H(3)O(+) and NO(+) reactions. The inclusion of O(2) (+) reactions in the analysis provides additional information, which may be applied when the identity of a parent compound cannot be determined solely from the H(3)O(+) and NO(+) analysis. Consideration of the product ions generated with the three precursors suggests that SIFT-MS can differentiate between many of the esters investigated, including isomers, although the product ions generated in the reactions with some esters are too similar to allow independent quantification. Our data therefore suggest that SIFT-MS may be a useful tool to rapidly analyse and quantify flavourant esters in complex <e>gas</e> mixtures.",M1
20185231,"Modeling dry-scrubbing of gaseous HCl with hydrated lime in cyclones with and without recirculation.A mathematical model describing the dry-scrubbing of gaseous hydrogen chloride (HCl) with solid hydrated lime particles (Ca(OH)(2)) was developed and experimentally verified. The model applies to cyclone systems with and without recirculation, where reaction and particle collection occurs in the same processing unit. The Modified Grain Model was selected to describe the behavior of the reaction process and it was assumed that the <e>gas</e> and the solid particles flow in the reactor with a plug flow. In this work, this behavior is approximated by a cascade of N CSTRs in series. Some of the model parameters were estimated by optimization taking into account the experimental results obtained. A good agreement was observed between the experimental results and those predicted by the model, where the main control resistance is the diffusion of the gaseous reactant in the layer of solid product formed.",M1

Comparison of the duplex stability in the gas phase versus solution indicates that hypoxanthine has much less of a destabilizing effect in the gas phase versus in solution, relative to the normal complementary duplexes. The biological implications of these results, both in the context of hypoxanthine as a universal base and as a damaged base, are discussed.",M1
20184000,"Simultaneous SO2 and NO removal from flue <e>gas</e> based on TiO2 photocatalytic oxidation.A new approach to the simultaneous removal of SO2 and NO from flue gas, by TiO2 photocatalysis based on UV irradiation technology, is presented. Experiments on the simultaneous desulphurization and denitrification were carried out using this photocatalyst in a self-designed photocatalytic reactor. Under the optimal experimental conditions, a removal efficiency of 98% for SO2 and 50% for NO was achieved. Scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy and X-ray energy spectrometry were used to observe the surface characteristics of the TiO2 photocatalyst. It was found that the surface of the quartz sand carrier was covered with Ti, on which the Si content of the quartz sand carrier was similar to the Ti content, indicating that the quartz sand supported the TiO2 membrane well. Based on the results of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and chemical analysis of the resulting products, the SO2 and NO removal mechanisms were revealed. Sulphate was the main desulphurization product and nitrite was the main denitrification product. In the removal reaction, NO was rapidly oxidized to NO2 and absorbed in the chemical reaction.",M1
20183995,"Co-current and counter-current spraying of odour-neutralizing products.A lab-scale pilot plant was developed in order to measure the efficiency of some odour-neutralizing products for the removal of odorous compounds. Experiments were carried out on <e>gas</e> and liquid flows in two configurations: co-current and counter-current, which differ in the values of the drop diameter and the contact time, leading to different behaviours between highly water-soluble compounds like ammonia and other compounds like sulphurous compounds. Mass transfer was shown to be modified by the presence of neutralizing products as a result of their pH and surface tension. Few chemical reactions, except for acidic or basic ones, could be highlighted. Olfactometric analyses were carried out and showed that, because of possible confusion between odours caused by the neutralizing product and odours caused by the by-products, it was difficult to conclude that an obvious relation existed between physico-chemical and olfactometric efficiencies.",M1
20183235,"The potential for releasing methane from artificial lakes in Central Germany--a 13C study.Methane is a strong greenhouse <e>gas</e>. Inland waters are thought to be important sources of methane, although detailed studies of emissions (diffusion and ebullition) are limited. This is the reason why we investigated the sediments of three anthropogenic lakes with respect to methane formation. Methane of microbial origin could be proved in any case. In one case, methane was released into the atmosphere by ebullition. The measured fluxes ranged between 134 and 935 mg CH(4) m(-2)d(-1). The fluxes close above the sediments were higher (274-4107 mg CH(4) m(-2)d(-1)). The decrease of methane content in the bubbles from greater to lower sampling depths is connected with an increase in its delta(13)C values. The Rayleigh equation has been used to calculate fractionation factors alpha between 1.0104 and 1.0163, which means that the changes are due to oxidation processes within the predominant oxic water column. However, large amounts of methane still reach the atmosphere.",M1
20181350,"Diffusion technique for the generation of gaseous halogen standards.Halogens are known to play an important role in the tropospheric ozone-depletion chemistry and are of special interest because of their influence on the atmospheric oxidation capacity. In this paper, we investigate the application of a capillary diffusion technique for the generation of gaseous halogen standards like Br(2), IBr, ICl and I(2). The influence of capillary dimension (i.e. length and inner diameter), ambient pressure and headspace volume of the diffusion vessel on the test <e>gas</e> output has been evaluated. The experimental output rates are determined from the mass loss of the analyte vessel on a regular schedule and compared with their respective theoretical predictions. We also demonstrate that a 1,3,5-trimethoxybenzene-coated diffusion denuder is capable of collecting gaseous ICl quantitatively, which provides an attractive alternative for the rapid determination of the output of test gas devices. The output rates of ICl measured by the denuder method are in close agreements with the data obtained by the gravimetric method.",M1
20180032,"<e>Gas</e> emission into the atmosphere from controlled landfills: an example from Legoli landfill (Tuscany, Italy).BACKGROUND, AIM AND SCOPE: Landfill gas (LFG) tends to escape from the landfill surface even when LFG collecting systems are installed. Since LFG leaks are generally a noticeable percentage of the total production of LFG, the optimisation of the collection system is a fundamental step for both energy recovery and environmental impact mitigation. In this work, we suggest to take into account the results of direct measurements of gas fluxes at the air-cover interface to achieve this goal. MATERIALS AND METHODS: During the last 5 years (2004-2009), 11 soil gas emission surveys have been carried out at the Municipal Solid Waste landfill of Legoli (Peccioli municipality, Pisa Province, Italy) by means of the accumulation chamber method. Direct and simultaneous measurements of CH(4) and CO(2) fluxes from the landfill cover (about 140,000 m(2)) have been performed to estimate the total output of both gases discharged into the atmosphere. Three different data processing have been applied and compared: Arithmetic mean of raw data (AMRD), sequential Gaussian conditional simulations (SGCS) and turning bands conditional simulations (TBCS). The total amount of LFG (captured and not captured) obtained from processing of direct measurements has been compared with the corresponding outcomes of three different numerical models (LandGEM, IPCC waste model and GasSim). RESULTS: Measured fluxes vary from undetectable values (&lt;0.05 mol m(-2) day(-1) for CH(4) and &lt;0.02 mol m(-2) day(-1) for CO(2)) to 246 mol m(-2) day(-1) for CH(4) and 275 mol m(-2) day(-1) for CO(2). The specific CH(4) and CO(2) fluxes (flux per surface unit) vary from 1.8 to 7.9 mol m(-2) day(-1) and from 2.4 to 7.8 mol m(-2) day(-1), respectively. DISCUSSION: The three different estimation methodologies (AMRD, SGCS and TBCS) used to evaluate the total output of diffused CO(2) and CH(4) fluxes from soil provide similar estimations, whereas there are some mismatches between these results and those of numerical LFG production models. Isoflux maps show a non-uniform spatial distribution, with high-flux zones not always corresponding with high-temperature areas shown by thermographic images. CONCLUSIONS: The average value estimated over the 5-year period for the Legoli landfill is 245 mol min(-1) for CH(4) and 379 mol min(-1) for CO(2), whereas the volume percentage of CH(4) in the total gas discharged into the atmosphere varies from 29% to 51%, with a mean value of 39%. The estimated yearly emissions from the landfill cover is about 1.29 x 10(8) mol annum(-1) (2,100 t year(-1)) of CH(4) and 1.99 x 10(8) mol annum(-1) (8,800 t year(-1)) of CO(2). Considering that the CH(4) global warming potential is 63 times greater than that of CO(2) (20 a time horizon, Lashof and Ahuja 1990), the emission of methane corresponds to 130,000 t annum(-1) of CO(2). RECOMMENDATIONS AND PERSPECTIVES: The importance of these studies is to provide data for the worldwide inventory of CH(4) and CO(2) emissions from landfills, with the ultimate aim of determining the contribution of waste disposal to global warming. This kind of studies could be extended to other gas species, like the volatile organic compounds.",M1
20176844,"Quantification of greenhouse <e>gas</e> emissions from windrow composting of garden waste.Microbial degradation of organic wastes entails the production of various gases such as carbon dioxide (CO(2)), methane (CH(4)), nitrous oxide (N(2)O), and carbon monoxide (CO). Some of these gases are classified as greenhouse gases (GHGs), thus contributing to climate change. A study was performed to evaluate three methods for quantifying GHG emissions from central composting of garden waste. Two small-scale methods were used at a windrow composting facility: a static flux chamber method and a funnel method. Mass balance calculations based on measurements of the C content in the in- and out-going material showed that 91 to 94% of the C could not be accounted for using the small-scale methods, thereby indicating that these methods significantly underestimate GHG emissions. A dynamic plume method (total emission method) employing Fourier Transform Infra Red (FTIR) absorption spectroscopy was found to give a more accurate estimate of the GHG emissions, with CO(2) emissions measured to be 127 +/- 15% of the degraded C. Additionally, with this method, 2.7 +/- 0.6% and 0.34 +/- 0.16% of the degraded C was determined to be emitted as CH(4) and CO. In this study, the dynamic plume method was a more effective tool for accounting for C losses and, therefore, we believe that the method is suitable for measuring GHG emissions from composting facilities. The total emissions were found to be 2.4 +/- 0.5 kg CH(4)-C Mg(-1) wet waste (ww) and 0.06 +/- 0.03 kg N(2)O-N Mg(-1) ww from a facility treating 15,540 Mg of garden waste yr(-1), or 111 +/- 30 kg CO(2)-equivalents Mg(-1) ww.",M1

Cadmium ions were retained on a column packed with sulfur powder modified with 2-mercaptobenzothiazole (2-MBT) in the medium of 1-butyl-3-methylimidazolium hexafluorophosphate ([bmim](+)PF(6)(-)) ionic liquid. The presence of ionic liquid during modification of sulfur enhanced the retention of cadmium ions on the column. The retained cadmium ions were eluted with 2 mol L(-1) solution of HCl and measured by cold vapor generation-atomic absorption spectrometry (CVG-AAS). By using reaction cell-<e>gas</e> liquid separator (RC-GLS), gaseous cadmium vapors were produced and reached the atomic absorption spectrometer, instantaneously. The influence of different variables on both processes of solid phase extraction and CVG-AAS determination of cadmium ions was investigated. The calibration curve was linear in the range of 10-200 ng L(-1)of cadmium in the initial solution with r=0.9992 (n=8) under optimum conditions. The limit of detection based on three times the standard deviation of the blank (3S(b), n=10) was 4.6 ng L(-1). The relative standard deviation (R.S.D.) of 25 and 150 ng L(-1) of cadmium was 4.1 and 2.2% (n=8), respectively. The procedure was validated by the analysis of a certified reference material (DORM-3), water and fish samples.",M1
20175570,"Gasous hole closing in a polymer Langmuir monolayer.The hole-closing phenomenon is studied in a polymer Langmuir film with coexisting gaseous and liquid phases both as a test of hydrodynamic theories of a two-dimensional fluid embedded in a three-dimensional one and as a means to accurately determine line tension, an important parameter determining size, shape, and dynamics within these and other membrane model systems. The hole-closing curve consists of both a universal linear regime and a history-dependent nonlinear one. Improved experimental technique allows us to explore the origin of the nonlinear regime. The linear regime confirms previous theoretical work and yields a value lambda = (0.69 +/- 0.02) pN for the line tension of the boundary between the gaseous and liquid phases. The observed hole closing also demonstrates that the two-dimensional polymer <e>gas</e> must be taken as having a small, probably negligible elasticity, so that line-tension measurements assuming that both phases are incompressible should be re-evaluated.",M1

NTDs, high-throughput automatic desorption and separation systems, were tested in vitro and within a study in 11 patients undergoing cardiac surgery with respect to reproducibility, reliability, and clinical applicability. NTD-heart-cut GC/MS analysis of standard mixtures containing different volatile organic compounds (VOCs) yielded relative standard deviations (RSDs) from 4.0% to 18.5%. Substance adsorption was stable for 1 day if NTDs were closed on both ends and was stable for approximately 7.8 h when NTD tip ends had to be left open during autosampler storage. Even in the presence of high concentrations of contaminants linearity of heart-cut GC/MS was conserved. In patients' breath potential biomarkers could be determined even in the presence of very high concentrations of sevoflurane. Profiles of blood-borne biomarkers, intravenous drugs, and clinical contaminants were characterized. Comprehensive GC x GC/TOF-MS may be used as a screening tool for new biomarkers, if patterns are generated from deconvoluted normalized areas. Needle trap sampling in combination with hyphenated chromatographic techniques can thus be used to provide well-tailored solutions for complex problems occurring in clinical breath analysis.",M1
20167465,"Coal fly ash based carbons for SO2 removal from flue gases.Two different coal fly ashes coming from the burning of two coals of different rank have been used as a precursor for the preparation of steam activated carbons. The performance of these activated carbons in the SO(2) removal was evaluated at flue <e>gas</e> conditions (100 degrees C, 1000 ppmv SO(2), 5% O(2), 6% H(2)O). Different techniques were used to determine the physical and chemical characteristics of the samples in order to explain the differences found in their behaviour. A superior SO(2) removal capacity was shown by the activated carbon obtained using the fly ash coming from a sub-bituminous-lignite blend. Experimental results indicated that the presence of higher amount of certain metallic oxides (Ca, Fe) in the carbon-rich fraction of this fly ash probably has promoted a deeper gasification in the activation with steam. A more suitable surface chemistry and textural properties have been obtained in this case which explains the higher efficiency shown by this sample in the SO(2) removal.",M1

Mono-, di-, tri-, and tetra(ethylene glycols) and 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone were studied. The influence of minute impurities (&lt;0.1%) upon the process of droplet evaporation was observed and discussed. The gas phase diffusion and evaporation coefficients were found from droplet radii evolution under the assumption of known vapor pressure. Diffusion coefficients were compared with independent measurements and calculations (in air). Good agreement was found for mono- and di(ethylene glycols), and for 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone, which confirmed the used vapor pressure values. The value of equilibrium vapor pressure for tri(ethylene glycol) was proposed to be 0.044 +/- 0.008 Pa.

20163169,"Structures of alkali metal ion-adenine complexes and hydrated complexes by IRMPD spectroscopy and electronic structure calculations.Complexes between adenine and the alkali metal ions Li(+), Na(+), K(+), and Cs(+) have been investigated by infrared multiple photon dissociation (IRMPD) spectroscopy between 2800 and 3900 cm(-1), as have some singly hydrated complexes. The IRMPD spectra clearly show the N-H stretching and the NH(2) symmetric and asymmetric stretching vibrations of adenine; and for the solvated ions, the O-H stretching vibrations are observed. These experimental spectra were compared with those for a variety of possible structures, including both A9 (A9 refers to the tautomer where hydrogen is on the nitrogen in position 9 of adenine, see Scheme 1) and A7 adenine tautomers, computed using B3-LYP/6-31+G(d,p). By comparing the experimental and the simulated spectra it is possible to rule out various structures and to further assign structures to the species probed in these experiments. Single-point calculations on the B3-LYP/6-31+G(d,p) geometries have been performed at MP2/6-311++G(2d, p) to obtain good estimates of the relative thermochemistries for the different structures. In all cases the computed IR spectrum for the lowest energy structure is consistent with the experimental IRMPD spectrum, but in some cases structural assignment cannot be confirmed based solely upon comparison with the experimental spectra so computed thermochemistries can be used to rule out high-energy structures. On the basis of the IRMPD spectra and the energy calculations, all adenine-M(+) and adenine-M(+)-H(2)O are concluded to be composed of the A7 tautomer of adenine, which is bound to the cations in a bidentate fashion through N3 and N9 (see Scheme 1 for numbering convention). For the hydrated ions water binds directly to the metal ion through oxygen, as would be expected since the metal contains most positive charge density. For the hydrated lithium cation-bound adenine dimer, the water molecule is concluded to be hydrogen bonded to a free basic site of one of the adenine monomers, which is also bound to the lithium cation. Experimental and theoretical results on adenine-Li(+)-H(2)O suggest that the electrosprayed adenine-Li(+) resembles the lowest-energy solution phase ion rather than the lowest-energy <e>gas</e>-phase ion, which is the imine form.",M1
20154374,"Metal-modified and vertically aligned carbon nanotube sensors array for landfill <e>gas</e> monitoring applications.Vertically aligned carbon nanotube (CNT) layers were synthesized on Fe-coated low-cost alumina substrates using radio-frequency plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (RF-PECVD) technology. A miniaturized CNT-based gas sensor array was developed for monitoring landfill gas (LFG) at a temperature of 150 degrees C. The sensor array was composed of 4 sensing elements with unmodified CNT, and CNT loaded with 5 nm nominally thick sputtered nanoclusters of platinum (Pt), ruthenium (Ru) and silver (Ag). Chemical analysis of multicomponent gas mixtures constituted of CO(2), CH(4), H(2), NH(3), CO and NO(2) has been performed by the array sensor responses and pattern recognition based on principal component analysis (PCA). The PCA results demonstrate that the metal-decorated and vertically aligned CNT sensor array is able to discriminate the NO(2) presence in the multicomponent mixture LFG. The NO(2) gas detection in the mixture LFG was proved to be very sensitive, e.g.: the CNT:Ru sensor shows a relative change in the resistance of 1.50% and 0.55% for NO(2) concentrations of 3.3 ppm and 330 ppb dispersed in the LFG, respectively, with a wide NO(2) gas concentration range measured from 0.33 to 3.3 ppm, at the sensor temperature of 150 degrees C. The morphology and structure of the CNT networks have been characterized by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Raman spectroscopy. A forest-like nanostructure of vertically aligned CNT bundles in the multi-walled form appeared with a height of about 10 microm and a single-tube diameter varying in the range of 5-35 nm. The intensity ratio of the Raman spectroscopy D-peak and G-peak indicates the presence of disorder and defects in the CNT networks. The size of the metal (Pt, Ru, Ag) nanoclusters decorating the CNT top surface varies in the range of 5-50 nm. Functional characterization based on electrical charge transfer sensing mechanisms in the metal-modified CNT-chemoresistor array demonstrates high sensitivity by providing minimal sub-ppm level detection, e.g., download up to 100 ppb NO(2), at the sensor temperature of 150 degrees C. The gas sensitivity of the CNT sensor array depends on operating temperature, showing a lower optimal temperature of maximum sensitivity for the metal-decorated CNT sensors compared to unmodified CNT sensors. Results indicate that the recovery mechanisms in the CNT chemiresistors can be altered by a rapid heating pulse from room temperature to about 110 degrees C. A comparison of the NO(2) gas sensitivity for the chemiresistors based on disorderly networked CNTs and vertically aligned CNTs is also reported. Cross-sensitivity towards relative humidity of the CNT sensors array is investigated. Finally, the sensing properties of the metal-decorated and vertically aligned CNT sensor arrays are promising to monitor gas events in the LFG for practical applications with low power consumption and moderate sensor temperature.",M1

20179685,"Colonic responses to <e>gas</e> loads in subgroups of patients with abdominal bloating.OBJECTIVES: We sought to evaluate colonic gas accommodation, ileocecal competence, and colonic clearance in subgroups patients with abdominal bloating. METHODS: Thirty-six patients complaining of abdominal bloating (12 constipation-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-C), 12 diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS-D), and 12 functional bloating) and 18 healthy controls were studied. Abdominal perception and girth were measured during: (i) 1 h continuous infusion of gas at 24 ml/min into the rectum (accommodation period) and (ii) 30 min free rectal gas evacuation (clearance period). In eight patients and eight healthy subjects, the gas infused was labeled with radioactive xenon (74 MBq (133)Xe), and gas distribution was determined by scintigraphy. RESULTS: Colonic gas accommodation produced significantly more abdominal symptoms and distension in patients than in healthy subjects (3.8+/-0.2 vs. 2.4+/-0.3 perception score; P&lt;0.001; 10.9+/-0.6 vs. 8.3+/-0.5 mm girth increment; P=0.009). Scintigraphy showed no differences in colonic gas distribution and no ileal gas reflux, but patients exhibited impaired gas clearance from the proximal colon (63%+/-10% clearance in 30 min vs. 80%+/-2% in health; P=0.042), resulting in more residual gas (506+/-46 vs. 174+/-47 ml; P&lt;0.001), perception (1.9+/-0.2 vs. 1.0+/-0.2 score; P=0.015), and girth increment (4.2+/-0.7 vs. 2.2+/-0.5 mm; P=0.024); IBS-C patients exhibited increased sensation and objective distension, as opposed to sensation only in IBS-D and distension only in functional bloating. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with abdominal bloating have normal colonic accommodation and ileocecal competence but impaired gas clearance from the proximal colon after retrograde infusion, and the consequences of this dysfunction are related to bowel habit.",M2

Our aim was to determine whether, and to what extent, intestinal gas propulsion is impaired in patients with manometrically proven dysmotility compared with healthy controls and patients with IBS. METHODS: Clearance and tolerance of a jejunal gas load (12 mL min(-1) for 2 h) were measured in 15 patients with severe abdominal symptoms and intestinal dysmotility evidenced by manometry, 15 patients with IBS and 15 healthy subjects. Thereafter, the effect of neostigmine (0.5 mg i.v. bolus) vs placebo (i.v. saline) was tested in six dysmotility patients. KEY RESULTS: After 2-h gas infusion, patients with dysmotility developed significantly more gas retention (717 +/- 91 mL) than IBS patients (372 +/- 82 mL; P = 0.0037) and healthy subjects (17 +/- 67 mL; P &lt; 0.0001 vs dysmotility; P = 0.0060 vs IBS). Despite the greater retention in dysmotility patients, abdominal perception (2.5 +/- 0.6 score) and distension (7 +/- 2 mm girth increment) were similar to IBS (3.9 +/- 0.6 score and 7 +/- 2 mm, respectively). In dysmotility patients, neostigmine produced immediate clearance of gas, and by 30 min had reduced gas retention (by -552 +/- 182 vs 72 +/- 58 mL after saline; P = 0.008), abdominal symptoms (by -0.8 +/- 0.3 score vs 0.3 +/- 0.2 after saline; P = 0.019) and distension (girth change -5 +/- 1 mm; P = 0.003 vs-2 +/- 2 mm after saline).

Since recently, its pathophysiology is better understood: an impaired transit of <e>gas</e> (particularly in the small bowel) or a visceral hypersensitivity leading to the induction of an abdominal discomfort despite a normal volume of gas are two of the main causes, far more frequent than an excessive production of gas. Moreover, bloating can be related to abnormal viscera-somatic reflexes promoting both an abdomino-phrenic dyssynergia and the relaxation of the muscles of the abdominal wall. From a therapeutic point of view, the efficacy of the gas absorbants remains to be more documented. Besides the treatment of a constipation and the avoidance of nutrients either highly fermentable or rich in fructose, other therapeutic options include prokinetics and drugs acting on visceral sensitivity. Probiotics are another promising option. In some centers, a non pharmacological therapeutic approach, mainly based on hypnosis, is discussed.",M2
19505462,"Are the effects of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors on cardiovascular events related to elevated levels of hydrogen <e>gas</e> in the gastrointestinal tract?The major side-effect of treatment with alpha-glucosidase inhibitors, flatulence, occurs when undigested carbohydrates are fermented by colonic bacteria, resulting in gas formation. We propose that the cardiovascular benefits of alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are partly attributable to their ability to neutralise oxidative stress via increased production of H(2) in the gastrointestinal tract. Acarbose, which is an alpha-glucosidase inhibitor, markedly increased H(2) production, with a weaker effect on methane production. Our hypothesis is based on our recent discovery that H(2) acts as a unique antioxidant, and that when inhaled or taken orally as H(2)-dissolved water it ameliorates ischaemia-reperfusion injury and atherosclerosis development.",M2

19124113,"Prevalence, characteristics, and impact of bloating symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Bloating symptoms are common in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) seen in primary care and gastrointestinal clinics. However, the underlying mechanisms of IBS are poorly understood, and there are few data available about the epidemiology of this syndrome or the impact of its symptoms. We investigated the prevalence, characteristics, and impact of bloating symptoms in patients with IBS. METHODS: IBS patients were identified by Rome II criteria in a U.S. population representative web-based survey. Patients were asked about the quality, frequency, and severity of their gastrointestinal symptoms. The impact of these symptoms was investigated by assessing patients' health-related quality of life, utilization of health care, and use of medications. RESULTS: Of the 337 IBS patients in this study, 82.5% (n = 278) reported bloating symptoms, the second most bothersome symptom after abdominal cramping. The symptoms were more prevalent in female patients, 87.4% (n = 209), than in male patients, 70.4% (n = 69) (P &lt; .0001), and in patients with constipation, 88.7% (n = 47), and mixed symptoms, 88.8% (n = 135), than in patients with diarrhea, 72.3% (n = 96), (P = .02 and P &lt; .01, respectively). Bloating symptoms were the third (of 14) most important reason to seek medical care, and more than half of the patients reported regular use of anti-<e>gas</e> medications. Bloating symptoms were associated with decreased energy levels (P = .04), food intake (P &lt; .01), and physical functioning (P = .06). CONCLUSIONS: Bloating symptoms are common in patients with IBS, and their prevalence and relative severity differ on the basis of sex and IBS subtype. Bloating symptoms are associated with a decrease in the quality of life and increases in health care utilization and use of medications.",M2

18802999,"Intestinal <e>gas</e> and bloating: effect of prokinetic stimulation.BACKGROUND: It is unknown if abdominal bloating is attributable to excess abdominal gas or improved by a prokinetic agent. AIMS: To assess abdominal gas content in functional abdominal bloating and to ascertain the effect of a prokinetic agent on intestinal gas symptoms in these patients. METHODS: In 20 patients, intra-abdominal gas content and symptoms were quantified before and during treatment with pyridostigmine (30 mg/8 hp. o) in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. Daily symptoms were quantified for 5 days before and 10 days during treatment, and abdominal gas volume was quantified by CT imaging before and at the fourth day of treatment. A CT scan was also obtained in 10 healthy subjects. RESULTS: Before treatment, the total volume of intestinal gas was similar in patients (112 +/- 18 mL) and in healthy controls (116 +/- 20 mL). The treatment-induced change in total and regional intestinal gas volume was not significantly different between pyridostigmine (-4 +/- 18 mL; mean +/- SEM) and placebo (0 +/- 15 mL). However, pyridostigmine reduced the severity of bloating from 3.3 +/- 0.3 to 2.6 +/- 0.4 (P &lt; 0.05), whereas placebo did not (3.2 +/- 0.3 vs 3.0 +/- 0.4), although the change did not reach statistical difference across groups. CONCLUSION: In patients complaining of functional bloating, the volume and distribution of intestinal gas, measured on nonselected days, is comparable to asymptomatic subjects. Prokinetic stimulation improves bloating sensation without detectable changes in gas content.",M2
18716868,"Development, validation, and applicability of a symptoms questionnaire for lactose malabsorption screening.Lactase deficiency has a high prevalence worldwide. Thus, a valid symptom scale would be a useful tool for identifying patients with lactose malabsorption. OBJECTIVE: To develop, validate, and apply a symptoms questionnaire on lactose malabsorption to identify lactose malabsorbers diagnosed with the gold-standard hydrogen breath test. METHODS: In the first part of the study, 292 patients completed a questionnaire at the end of a 50-g lactose breath test. The questionnaire included five items (diarrhea, abdominal cramping, vomiting, audible bowel sounds, and flatulence or <e>gas</e>) scored on a 10-cm visual analogue scale. In the second part of the study, 171 patients completed the questionnaire twice: first, according to their opinion when consuming dairy products at home and second, after a 50-g lactose breath test. Patients were grouped as absorbers or malabsorbers according to the result of the breath test. RESULTS: Diarrhea, abdominal cramping, and flatulence were scored significantly higher in malabsorbers than in absorbers. Total score of the symptomatic questionnaire was significantly higher in malabsorbers (17.5 versus 3.0, P&lt;0.01). According to receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analysis, the most discriminant cut-off of the total score to identify lactose malabsorption was 6.5 (sensitivity 0.75, specificity 0.67). In 58 malabsorbers the effect size of the questionnaire to determine sensitivity to change was 1.32. In the second part of the study, scoring of the home questionnaire was higher than after the lactose-breath test. The lactose malabsorbers rate was higher according to the home questionnaire than after the lactose breath test (72% versus 52%). The home questionnaire had excellent sensitivity (0.82) but low specificity (0.35). CONCLUSION: We developed and validated a five-item symptoms questionnaire for lactose malabsorption. This is a valid test that permits patients with a total score lower than 7 to be excluded from future studies.",M2
18493854,"Incidence of predominant methanogenic flora in irritable bowel syndrome patients and apparently healthy controls from North India.BACKGROUND: Flatulence is a common symptom in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). This may be due to production of hydrogen by intestinal flora. With the presence of methanogenic flora, 4 mol of hydrogen (H(2)) are used with 1 mol of carbon dioxide (CO(2)) to produce 1 mol of methane (CH(4)), a process greatly reducing the volume of <e>gas</e> in the colon. However, the prevalence of methanogenic flora has not yet been reported in healthy and IBS patients from North India. Therefore, this study was planned. METHODS: This study was conducted prospectively and included 345 patients with irritable bowel syndrome (fulfilling Rome II criteria) and 254 age- and gender-matched apparently healthy controls. Each subject underwent a hydrogen breath test using 10 g lactulose after an overnight fast. An SC Microlyser from Quintron, USA, was used to measure methane and hydrogen at baseline and at every 30 min for 4 h. Subjects with fasting methane concentration &lt;10 p.p.m. were labeled as low methane producers (LMPs) and &gt; 10 p.p.m. as predominant methane producers (PMPs). RESULTS: The IBS and control groups included 66.78% and 67.53% men, respectively. Mean age in the two groups was 48.52 +/- 30.54 years (range 15-68 years) and 45.67 +/- 30.54 years (range 15-78 years), respectively. Prevalence of predominant methanogenic flora in IBS and control groups was 14.5% (50/345) and 34.6% (88/254), respectively (P &lt; 0.001). Fifty-two out of 254 (20.6 %) were PMPs and 36 out of 254 (14.0%) were LMPs in controls. In contrast to this, IBS patients had 17 out of 354 (4.9%) that were PMPs and 33 out of 345 (9.6%) that were LMPs. CONCLUSION: Methanogenic flora was significantly lower in IBS patients from North India than in apparently healthy subjects. This may be one of the causes of flatulence in IBS patients.",M2

18441716,"Anorectal symptoms in pregnancy and the postpartum period.OBJECTIVE: To determine the frequency of anorectal complaints in nulliparous, pregnant women before and after delivery. STUDY DESIGN: This was a prospective, observational study. Nulliparous, pregnant women attending an active-duty prenatal clinic completed a 6-item anorectal symptom questionnaire that assessed anal continence and defecatory symptoms. RESULTS: Seventy-five active-duty, nulliparous women completed 158 questionnaires. Anorectal symptoms were reported both antepartum (AP) and postpartum (PP): straining to defecate (AP: 28-59%; PP: 30%), hard or lumpy stools (AP: 48-59%; PP: 66%), incomplete emptying (AP: 38-53%; PP: 38%), uncontrolled loss of <e>gas</e> or stool from the rectum (AP: 18-29%; PP: 15%), unpreventable soilage of underwear (AP: 15-33%; PP: 13%) and splinting (AP: 3-9%; PP: 9%). Constipation symptoms were reported most frequently in the first trimester (p = 0.031) and anal incontinence most often in the third trimester but loss of gas or stool  often  more in the postpartum period (p = 0.027). Anal incontinence was more frequent in women who delivered by forceps (p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Anorectal symptoms are common both during pregnancy and in the postpartum period.

18436509,"[Bowel gases]Abdominal bloating is one of the most common symptoms in patients with different gastrointestinal disorders. The majority of patients usually attribute this complaint to increased intestinal <e>gas</e> volume. Recent experimental studies using the gas challenge test help us to better understand the gas dynamics and tolerance in humans. Although there are some clinical conditions that are clearly related to impaired gas dynamics, the role of gases in functional gastrointestinal disorders especially in irritable bowel syndrome is much more complicated. Impaired gas handling, abnormal reflexes and visceral hypersensitivity seem to be the main factors resulting in abdominal bloating in this group of patients. Further clinical studies are needed to clarify the pathophysiologic mechanisms of intestinal gas and this may contribute to the evaluation of optimal therapy.",M2
18377682,"Effect of a prebiotic mixture on intestinal comfort and general wellbeing in health.Specific carbohydrates, i.e. prebiotics such as fructo-oligosaccharide (FOS), are not digested in the small intestine but fermented in the colon. Besides beneficial health effects of an enhanced bifidobacteria population, intestinal <e>gas</e> production resulting from fermentation can induce abdominal symptoms. Partial replacement with slowly fermented acacia gum may attenuate side effects. The aim was to compare the effects of FOS with those of a prebiotic mixture (50 % FOS and 50 % acacia gum; BLEND) and a rapidly absorbed carbohydrate (maltodextrin) on general intestinal wellbeing, abdominal comfort and anorectal sensory function. Twenty volunteers (eight male and twelve female; age 20-37 years) completed this double-blind, randomised study with two cycles of a 2-week run-in phase (10 g maltodextrin) followed by 5 weeks of 10 g FOS or BLEND once daily, separated by a 4-week wash-out interval. Abdominal symptoms and general wellbeing were documented by telephone interview or Internet twice weekly. Rectal sensations were assessed by a visual analogue scale during a rectal barostat test after FOS and BLEND treatment. Both FOS and BLEND induced more side effects than maltodextrin. Belching was more pronounced under FOS compared with BLEND (P = 0.09 for females; P = 0.01 for males), and for self-reported general wellbeing strong sex differences were reported (P = 0.002). Urgency scores during rectal barostat were higher with FOS than BLEND (P = 0.01). Faced with a growing range of supplemented food products, consumers may benefit from prebiotic mixtures which cause fewer abdominal side effects.

18004186,"Daily stress and gastrointestinal symptoms in women with irritable bowel syndrome.BACKGROUND: Stress has been implicated as contributing to the initiation and exacerbation of bowel and discomfort symptoms in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). OBJECTIVE: To examine the relationships of daily self-reported stress to gastrointestinal (GI) and psychological distress symptoms both across women and within woman in a comparison group of women without IBS and among subgroups of women with IBS. METHODS: Women with IBS (n = 181; age = 18-49 years) who were divided into subgroups based on bowel pattern (constipation, n = 52; diarrhea, n = 67; alternating, n = 62) were compared to a group of women without IBS (n = 48). Self-report stress measures; abdominal (abdominal pain, bloating, and intestinal <e>gas</e>), bowel pattern (constipation, diarrhea), and intestinal gas; and psychological (anxiety and depression) distress symptoms were obtained daily over 1 month. Across-women and within-woman analyses were used. RESULTS: There were significant across-women correlations among mean daily stress, psychological distress, and GI symptoms in the total IBS group and the IBS bowel pattern subgroups. The across-women relationships between daily stress and GI symptoms were diminished when anxiety and depression were controlled in the analyses. Within-woman analyses showed little evidence of relationship between day-to-day variations in stress and day-to-day variations in GI symptoms; however, stress was strongly related to anxiety and depression. DISCUSSION: Gastrointestinal symptom distress is associated with self-reported stress in women with IBS. Psychological distress moderates the effects of stress on GI symptoms. The IBS treatment protocols that incorporate strategies that decrease stress and psychological distress are likely to reduce GI symptoms.",M2
17954090,"Laparoscopic clam shell partial fundoplication achieves effective reflux control with reduced postoperative dysphagia and <e>gas</e> bloating.BACKGROUND: We describe a novel laparoscopic  clam shell  partial fundoplication, incorporating a modified Toupet with an anterior fundic flap for the management of medically recalcitrant gastroesophageal reflux disease. We hypothesize that this clam-shell-like mechanism allows a dynamic rather than rigid circumferential antireflux barrier allowing effective reflux control (compared with partial fundoplication) with reduced occurrence of postoperative dysphagia, gas bloating and vagal nerve injury (compared with Nissen fundoplication). METHODS: Between November 2002 and May 2006, 140 patients (82 female; mean age, 53 years) underwent this laparoscopic clam shell fundoplication procedure for medically recalcitrant gastroesophageal reflux disease (n = 94) or large paraesophageal hernias (n = 46). Preoperative invasive studies (endoscopy, manometry, pH monitoring) and noninvasive studies (barium swallow and radionuclide gastroesophageal motility) revealed esophageal dysmotility in 26 patients. Routine barium swallow and radionuclide studies were performed 6 months postoperatively and then at yearly intervals. RESULTS: There was no mortality or conversions to open procedures. Mean operative time was 45 minutes; median hospital stay was 1 day (range, 1 to 4). Overall control of reflux symptoms was seen in 95% of patients. Postoperative gas bloating and significant dysphagia occurred in only 11% and 6% of patients, respectively. Three patients (2%) experienced postoperative complications (pneumonia, 2; pleural effusion requiring drainage, 1). Postoperative studies demonstrated reflux in 8 patients (5%) and the presence of small hiatal hernias in 5 patients (4%) during a mean follow-up 19 months (range, 7 to 42). Twenty five patients (17%) underwent postoperative esophageal dilation (median dilations, 1; range, 1 to 3) for dysphagia (11 of these patients had preoperative esophageal dysmotility). Five patients underwent repeat fundoplication (recurrent reflux, 2; gas bloating, 1; dysphagia, 2). CONCLUSIONS: Clam shell near-circumferential fundoplication may be considered as an attractive alternative antireflux approach to Nissen fundoplication, particularly among patients at risk for postoperative dysphagia or gas bloating.",M2
17643909,"Irritable bowel syndrome and bloating.Gaseous symptoms in irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) including eructation, flatulence, and bloating occur as a consequence of excess <e>gas</e> production, altered gas transit, abnormal perception of normal amounts of gas within the gastrointestinal tract, or dysfunctional somatic muscle activity in the abdominal wall. Because of the prominence of gaseous complaints in IBS, recent investigations have focussed on new insights into pathogenesis and novel therapies of bloating. The evaluation of the IBS patient with unexplained gas and bloating relies on careful exclusion of organic disease with further characterisation of the underlying condition with directed functional testing. Treatment of gaseous symptomatology in IBS should be targeted to pathophysiologic defects whenever possible. Available therapies include lifestyle alterations, dietary modifications, enzyme preparations, adsorbents and agents which reduce surface tension, treatments that alter gut flora, and drugs that modulate gut transit.",M2

17431432,"[The high fermentative capacity of colonic bacteria in the origin of flatulence and its sensibility to bismuth subsalicylate]Using a previously described technique,  in vitro  determinations were carried out for faecal fermentation (FF): basal faecal fermentation (BFF), i.e, only with faeces, with faeces and lactulose (LFF) and with faeces, lactulose and bismuth subsalicylate (BiLFF) in 34 patients with flatulence. The media+d.s. of the difference between the LFFand BFF levels (LFF-BFF) in patients with flatulence was significant and markedly higher than the respective media +d.s. in 30 normal control patients previously studied (9.1+4.7 vs. 3.9+3.2 ml <e>gas</e>/24 hrs; p&lt;0.000001 respectively). And, although FF was reduced by adding bismuth salicylate in only 24% (70.6%) of the patients with flatulence but not in the remaining 10 (29.4%), in total the media+d.s. of the differences between the levels BiLFF and BFF (BiLFFBFF) was significantly lower that the media+d.s. of the differences between the LFF and BFF levels (LFF-BFF) (6.0+4.2 vs 9.1+4.7 ml gas/24 hrs; p&lt;0.01 respectively). These results confirm that: 1) The fermentative capacity of the colonic bacteriae is most likely to be abnormally intense in peoples with flatulence and 2) Bismuth subsalicylate can be useful in the control of excessive colonic fermentation and flatulence; they raise, furthermore, the interesting possibility that we may have found the way to predict when the use of bismuth subsalicylate could be effective in the treatment of a patient with flatulence.",M2
17306636,"<e>Gas</e>-related symptoms after laparoscopic 360 degrees Nissen or 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication in gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients with aerophagia as comorbidity.BACKGROUND: Aerophagia is a rare but well-known comorbidity in patients with gastrooesophageal reflux disease. Particularly after laparoscopic Nissen fundoplication, it has proven to result in worse symptomatic outcome and a lower postoperative quality of life in comparison to patients without preoperative gas-related symptoms. AIMS: Aim of the study was to compare the postoperative outcome in gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients with aerophagia as comorbidity after either laparoscopic 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen fundoplication or 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication with main focus on the frequency and subjective impairment of gas-related symptoms. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 56 gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients, the comorbidity of aerophagia was diagnosed prior to laparoscopic antireflux surgery. Irrespective of their preoperative manometric findings, the patients were either scheduled to a laparoscopic 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen (n=28) or a laparoscopic 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication (n=28). All patients have been analysed concerning the presence of gas-related symptoms preoperatively as well as 3 months after surgery. Additionally, the subjective degree of impairment was evaluated using a numerous rating scale (0=no perception/impairment, 100=most severe perception/impairment). The following symptoms have been analysed: ability/inability to belch, 'gas bloat', flatulence, postprandial fullness and epigastric pain. RESULTS: Before surgery, there were no significant differences between both surgical groups. Three months after surgery, significant differences (p&lt;0.05-0.01) were found: patients who underwent a laparoscopic 270 degrees Toupet fundoplication suffered from less impairing gas bloat, flatulence and postprandial fullness when compared with patients with a 360 degrees 'floppy' Nissen fundoplication. The majority of these patients were able to belch postoperatively but felt no impairment due to this symptom. In contrast, patients of the Nissen group felt a significant impairment due to the inability to belch. CONCLUSION: Gas-related symptoms are very common in gastrooesophageal reflux disease patients with aerophagia as a comorbidity. Patients who undergo a laparoscopic Toupet fundoplication show less impairment in relation to gas-related problems compared with patients treated with a Nissen fundoplication for a follow-up period of at least 3 months. In the Toupet group, the ability to belch postoperatively seems to be a positive aspect from the patients' view which also improves the percentage of gas-related problems. However, long-term results are necessary.",M2

DESIGN: Hermeneutic phenomenology guided by a Gadamerian perspective. SETTING AND SUBJECTS: Six people with a bowel ostomy were recruited from a city in Australia. METHODS: In-depth, nonstructured interviews generated rich text. Interviews were videotaped. A variety of interpretive, hermeneutic techniques were applied for text interpretation RESULTS: Nine existential themes of meaning emerged: I am undignified, I am a secret, I am always with <e>gas</e>, I am not myself alone, I am without choice, I am a seeker of control, I am the smell, I am not normal, and I am living a life-sort of.

17097152,"Tolerability of oral xylitol solution in young children: implications for otitis media prophylaxis.OBJECTIVE: Xylitol, given as 2g orally five times-a-day, significantly reduces the incidence of acute otitis media (AOM) in children. A less frequent dosing schedule, if tolerable and efficacious, would promote the more widespread use of this treatment. We sought to determine the tolerability and acceptability in young children of oral xylitol solution at doses of 5g three times-a-day (TID) and 7.5g once daily (QD). METHODS: The study was a 3-month randomized placebo-controlled trial of the tolerability and acceptability of oral xylitol solution in 120 children 6-36 months of age performed in the SCOR Network. RESULTS: Study withdrawals and unscheduled medical visits for gastrointestinal complaints did not differ significantly among the study groups. The proportions of subjects in the xylitol TID group who experienced excessive <e>gas</e> or diarrhea at months 1, 2, and 3 were 22.7%, 10.0%, and 14.3%, respectively, and in the xylitol QD group were 27.3%, 17.4%, and 14.3%, respectively, and these did not differ from the placebo groups. The proportions who accepted the study solution easily or with only minor difficulty at 1, 2, and 3 months in the xylitol TID group were 77.3%, 90.0%, and 90.5% and in the xylitol QD group, 77.3%, 82.6%, and 90.5%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Oral xylitol solution at dosages of 5g TID and 7.5g QD is well-tolerated by young children. Given the potential for xylitol as a safe, inexpensive option for AOM prophylaxis, clinical trials using these dosages of xylitol can be conducted.",M2
16979386,"Role of colonic fermentation in the perception of colonic distention in irritable bowel syndrome and functional bloating.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Bloating represents a frequent gastrointestinal symptom, but the pathophysiologic mechanism responsible for its onset is still largely unknown. Patients very frequently attribute the sensation of bloating to the presence of excessive bowel <e>gas</e>, but not all patients with gas-related symptoms exhibit increased intestinal production of gas. It is therefore possible that other still unrecognized mechanisms might contribute to its pathophysiology. Our aim was to evaluate whether a subgroup of patients affected by functional abdominal bloating presents hypersensitivity to colonic fermentation. METHODS: Sixty patients affected by functional gastrointestinal disorders (11 functional bloating, 36 constipation-predominant, and 13 diarrhea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome) and moderate to severe bloating took part in the study. Twenty sex- and age-matched healthy volunteers were enrolled as a control group. All the subjects underwent a preliminary evaluation of breath hydrogen excretion after oral lactulose. Then, on a separate day, an evaluation of sensitivity thresholds at rectal level was performed with a barostat before and after the induction of colonic fermentation with oral lactulose. A control test with electrolyte solution was also performed. RESULTS: Both breath hydrogen excretion and mouth-to-cecum transit time did not differ between the 4 groups studied. Neither electrolyte solution nor lactulose modified sensitivity thresholds in healthy volunteers. In low hydrogen producers, basal perception and discomfort thresholds were similar to high hydrogen producers, but after lactulose both perception and discomfort thresholds were significantly reduced only in low hydrogen producers. CONCLUSIONS: A subgroup of patients with functional gastrointestinal disorders and moderate to severe bloating might have hypersensitivity to products of colonic fermentation.",M2

METHODS: In 12 patients complaining of abdominal bloating (8 IBS and 4 functional bloating) and in 12 healthy controls, the effect of colonic <e>gas</e> load (24 mL/min rectal gas infusion for 1 hour) on perception (measured by a 0-6 scale), abdominal girth, and muscular activity was tested. With the participants sitting on an ergonomic chair and the trunk erect, multichannel electromyography was measured via bipolar surface electrodes located over the upper and lower rectus abdominis, and the external and internal oblique bilaterally. RESULTS: In healthy controls, colonic gas loads produced subjective symptoms (score, 3.0 +/- 0.3), objective abdominal distention (girth increment, 6 +/- 1 mm), and increased the activity of the abdominal muscles (external oblique activity, 11% +/- 3% in; P &lt; .05 vs basal). At the same infused gas volumes, the patients developed significantly more symptoms (score, 4.5 +/- 0.4) and abdominal distention (11 +/- 1 mm; P &lt; .05 vs healthy for both).

16410032,"Sugar malabsorption in functional abdominal bloating: a pilot study on the long-term effect of dietary treatment.BACKGROUND: Functional abdominal bloating is a functional bowel disorder dominated by a feeling of abdominal fullness without sufficient criteria for another functional gastrointestinal disorder. <e>Gas</e>-related complaints (i.e., passage of flatus), which are present in a subgroup of these patients, might be associated with carbohydrate malabsorption. AIM: To evaluate the presence of lactose and/or fructose plus sorbitol malabsorption, and the long-term efficacy of malabsorbed sugar-free diets, in patients with Rome II criteria of functional abdominal bloating and gas-related symptoms. METHODS: Thirty-six consecutive patients (age, 51+/-3.1 years; sex, 12 M, 24 W) with Rome II criteria of functional abdominal bloating and gas-related symptoms were included in a pilot study. In all cases, the presence of malabsorption of both lactose (20 g) and fructose plus sorbitol (20+3.5 g) was assessed by means of hydrogen breath test. Patients with sugar malabsorption were put on a malabsorbed sugar-free diet. Follow-up visits were scheduled at both 1 and 12 months after starting the diet. Global rating scales of change as compared to the beginning of the study were used to assess symptom changes. RESULTS: Twenty-six of 36 patients (72.2%) presented sugar malabsorption (six lactose, 12 fructose plus sorbitol, and eight both). Seventeen of the 26 (65%) patients with malabsorption had symptoms of sugar intolerance during the 3-h breath testing period. All 26 were put on malabsorbed sugar-free diets. Eighty-one per cent of patients referred clinical improvement at 1-month visit, which was maintained at 12 months in 67% of them (complete improvement in 50% and partial improvement in 16.7%). CONCLUSIONS: Sugar malabsorption and intolerance seem to be frequent in patients with functional abdominal bloating and gas-related complaints. A malabsorbed sugar-free diet might be a long-term effective therapy in a high percentage of patients. Further controlled clinical trials are warranted.",M2
16254518,"Clinical features of pathologic childhood aerophagia: early recognition and essential diagnostic criteria.OBJECTIVE: This study investigated the early recognition and diagnosis of pathologic childhood aerophagia to avoid unnecessary diagnostic approaches and serious complications. METHODS: Between 1995 and 2003, data from 42 consecutive patients with pathologic childhood aerophagia, aged 2 to 16 years, were reviewed. An esophageal air sign was defined as an abnormal air shadow on the proximal esophagus adjacent to the trachea on a full-inflated chest radiograph. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients, the chief complaints were abdominal distention (52.4%), recurrent abdominal pain syndrome (21.4%), chronic diarrhea (11.9%), acute abdominal pain (7.1%) and others (7.2%). Mean symptom duration before diagnosis was 10.6 months (range, 1 to 60 months), and it exceeded 12 months for 16 (38.1%) patients. The clinical features common to all patients were abdominal distention that increased progressively during the day, increased flatus on sleep, increased bowel sound on auscultation and an air-distended stomach with increased <e>gas</e> in the small and large bowel by radiography. Visible or audible air swallowing (26.2%) and repetitive belching (9.5%) were also noted. Esophageal air sign was observed in 76.2% of the patients and in 9.7% of the controls (P=0.0001). The subgroups of pathologic childhood aerophagia divided by underlying associations were pathologic childhood aerophagia without severe mental retardation (76.2%), which consisted of psychological stresses and uncertain condition, and pathologic childhood aerophagia with severe mental retardation (23.8%). CONCLUSIONS: The common manifestations of pathologic childhood aerophagia may be its essential diagnostic criteria, and esophageal air sign may be useful for the early recognition of pathologic childhood aerophagia. Our observations show that the diagnostic clinical profiles suggested by Rome II criteria should be detailed and made clearer if they are to serve as diagnostic criteria for pathologic childhood aerophagia.",M2

16183355,"Fructose intake at current levels in the United States may cause gastrointestinal distress in normal adults.OBJECTIVE: Fructose intake has increased considerably in the United States, primarily as a result of increased consumption of high-fructose corn syrup, fruits and juices, and crystalline fructose. The purpose was to determine how often fructose, in amounts commonly consumed, would result in malabsorption and/or symptoms in healthy persons. DESIGN: Fructose absorption was measured using 3-hour breath hydrogen tests and symptom scores were used to rate subjective responses for <e>gas</e>, borborygmus, abdominal pain, and loose stools. SUBJECTS/SETTING: The study included 15 normal, free-living volunteers from a medical center community and was performed in a gastrointestinal specialty clinic. INTERVENTION: Subjects consumed 25- and 50-g doses of crystalline fructose with water after an overnight fast on separate test days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Mean peak breath hydrogen, time of peak, area under the curve (AUC) for breath hydrogen and gastrointestinal symptoms were measured during a 3-hour period after subjects consumed both 25- and 50-g doses of fructose. STATISTICAL ANALYSES: Differences in mean breath hydrogen, AUC, and symptom scores between doses were analyzed using paired t tests. Correlations among peak breath hydrogen, AUC, and symptoms were also evaluated. RESULTS: More than half of the 15 adults tested showed evidence of fructose malabsorption after 25 g fructose and greater than two thirds showed malabsorption after 50 g fructose. AUC, representing overall breath hydrogen response, was significantly greater after the 50-g dose. Overall symptom scores were significantly greater than baseline after each dose, but scores were only marginally greater after 50 g than 25 g. Peak hydrogen levels and AUC were highly correlated, but neither was significantly related to symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Fructose, in amounts commonly consumed, may result in mild gastrointestinal distress in normal people. Additional study is warranted to evaluate the response to fructose-glucose mixtures (as in high-fructose corn syrup) and fructose taken with food in both normal people and those with gastrointestinal dysfunction. Because breath hydrogen peaks occurred at 90 to 114 minutes and were highly correlated with 180-minute breath hydrogen AUC, the use of peak hydrogen measures may be considered to shorten the duration of the exam.",M2
16097984,"Pelvic floor dysfunction after Burch colposuspension--a comprehensive study. Part II.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the prevalence of pelvic floor dysfunction (PFD) concerning bowel function at long-term follow-up after Burch colposuspension (Bc) in relation to the bowel function in an age-matched sample of women in the general population. METHODS AND MATERIAL: This is a follow-up study of a cohort of 190 patients who underwent Bc in 1980-1988 and 305 age-matched control women without urinary anti-incontinence surgery, randomly selected from the general population. The participants answered a postal questionnaire with detailed questions about the pelvic floor function in 1998. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. RESULTS: The patients showed considerable signs of bowel dysfunction compared with the general population in the following aspects: they used the fingers to help emptying the bowel [odds ratio (OR) 3.25 (1.35-7.86)]; had feeling of incomplete emptying of the bowel [OR 2.29 (1.11-4.73)]; felt no warning before passing a motion [OR 3.04 (1.20-7.71)]; had <e>gas</e> incontinence [OR 1.98 (1.17-3.37); had loose stool incontinence [OR 3.67 (1.43-9.42)]; used protection against fecal leakage during daytime [OR 3.22 (1.30-7.95)]; and experienced that the bowel function affected the general well-being adversely [OR 2.15 (1.30-3.56)]. CONCLUSION: The patients who have undergone colposuspension for stress urinary incontinence have more symptoms of PFD concerning the bowel function than women without urinary anti-incontinence surgery in the general population. This affects the general well-being. A comprehensive concept of multidisciplinary assessment and treatment of PFD should be encouraged.",M2
16042910,"New insights into the pathophysiology of irritable bowel syndrome: implications for future treatments.Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a multifactorial disorder characterized by abdominal pain and altered bowel habits. Chronic symptoms may occur due to changes in gastrointestinal motor function, enhanced perception of gut stimuli, and psychosocial factors. Recent data suggest that abnormal processing of afferent signals occurs in IBS patients. A newly recognized causative factor in a subset of IBS patients is post-infectious IBS. Altered transport of intestinal <e>gas</e> and bowel distention may contribute to abdominal discomfort, pain, and bloating. Changes in gut microflora have also been reported, but data remain scant. Advances have been made in our understanding of serotonin signaling and metabolism in IBS patients, in part due to the introduction of specific receptor agonists and antagonists. Finally, exciting data are emerging on genetic alterations that may contribute to the pathophysiology and treatment of IBS. Increasingly novel mechanisms are being identified that should aid in better understanding of the complex pathophysiology of IBS and developing new therapies.",M2
15862934,"The pathogenesis of bloating and visible distension in irritable bowel syndrome.Abdominal bloating is a relevant, troublesome, and poorly understood clinical problem. Despite its clinical importance, bloating remains substantially ignored, without proper clinical classification, known pathophysiology, and effective treatment. It is not even clear to what extent the complaints of individual patients correlate with objective evidence of abdominal distension, and this uncertainly regarding the subjective or objective origin of the complaints further adds to confusion. This article proposed a framework for investigating bloating, considering key factors potentially involved in its pathophysiology: distorted sensation, physical abdominal expansion, and abdominal wall dystony. Some data indicate that patients complaining of bloating have impaired transit and tolerance of intestinal <e>gas</e> loads. The problem does not seem to be too much gas,however, but rather abnormal responses to gas. Furthermore, abnormal control of abdominal muscle activity in these patients may contribute to objective distension. Bloating, like many other abdominal symptoms,probably represents a heterogeneous condition produced by a combination of pathophysiological mechanisms that differ among individual patients,resulting in a polymorphic clinical presentation.",M2
15687757,"[Difference in time of bowel sounds and passing of <e>gas</e> in abdominal hysterectomy patients having San-Yin-Jia (SP-6) acupressure]PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare differences in the time when bowel sounds were heard and gas was passed in women who had an abdominal hysterectomy and were treated for 5 minutes (experimental group A) or 10 minutes (experimental group B) with San-Yin-Jiao (SP-6) acupressure. METHOD: The design of this study was a nonequivalent control group non-synchronized post test only design. The participants included 142 women, 39 in experimental group A, 30 in experimental group B, and 73 in the control group. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire which included items on general characteristics and a self report of time when gas was passed. Differences for the three groups as to time when bowel sounds were heard and gas was passed were analyzed using ANOVA. RESULT: The time when bowel sounds were heard was statistically significantly shorter in both experimental groups compared to the control group(F=10.29, p=.000). The time when gas was passed was statistically significantly shorter in experimental group B(10 min) compared to the control group(F=4.68, p=.011). CONCLUSION: It could be concluded that SP-6 acupressure of 10 minutes was effective in shortening the time until bowel sounds were heard and gas was passed for women who had had an abdominal hysterectomy. Replication of the study with a larger number of participants is necessary in order to be able to generalize the results.",M2
15667499,"Effectiveness of devices purported to reduce flatus odor.OBJECTIVE: A variety of charcoal-containing devices are purported to minimize problems with odoriferous rectal <e>gas</e>; however, the evidence supporting the efficacy of these products is virtually all anecdotal. We objectively evaluated the ability of these devices to adsorb two malodorous, sulfide gases (hydrogen sulfide and methylmercaptan) instilled at the anus. METHODS: Via a tube, 100 ml of nitrogen containing 40 ppm of sulfide gases and 0.5% H(2) was instilled at the anus of six healthy volunteers who wore gas impermeable Mylar pantaloons over their garments. Since H(2) is not adsorbed by charcoal, the fraction of the sulfide gases removed could be determined from the concentration ratio of sulfide gas: H(2) in the pantaloon space relative to the ratio in instilled gas. RESULTS: Measurements with no device in place showed that subjects' garments removed 22.0 +/- 5.3% of the sulfide gases, and results obtained with each device were corrected for this removal. The only product that adsorbed virtually all of the sulfide gases was briefs constructed from an activated carbon fiber fabric. Pads worn inside the underwear removed 55-77% of the sulfide gases. Most cushions were relatively ineffective, adsorbing about 20% of the gases. CONCLUSIONS: The ability of charcoal-containing devices to adsorb odoriferous rectal gases is limited by incomplete exposure of the activated carbon to the gases. Briefs made from carbon fiber are highly effective; pads are less effective, removing 55-77% of the odor; cushions are relatively ineffective.",M2
15624540,"Dietary fructose intolerance: diet modification can impact self-rated health and symptom control.Carbohydrate intolerance to lactose is widely accepted as a cause of gastrointestinal symptoms, but controversy persists on how important dietary fructose intolerance (DFI) is in causing gastrointestinal pain and suffering and if an elimination diet can control the presenting complaints. The objective of this study was to identify a group of well-defined DFI patients and explore whether dietary education followed by dietary compliance could control symptoms and improve quality of life. During a 5-year period, patients referred to a pancreato-biliary clinic were evaluated for dietary carbohydrate intolerances if they presented with gastrointestinal pain and/or <e>gas</e> and/or bloating and/or diarrhea. Patients were tested with a standardized mixture of glucose, fructose, and lactose diluted in sterile water. End-expiratory breath samples were collected for hydrogen and methane measurement. Symptoms were scored using a 9-point symptom questionnaire. The patients underwent in-depth education by a dietician, and were provided with access to a cookbook, a newsletter, and a support group. A dietary questionnaire was used to evaluate compliance with the fructose-restricted diet. DFI can cause significant gastrointestinal symptoms that may not respond to medications or surgical interventions. Symptoms can improve and self-rated health does improve in DFI patients willing to adhere to a low fructose diet.",M2
15335408,"New pathophysiological mechanisms in irritable bowel syndrome.Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a functional, multifactorial disease characterized by abdominal pain and erratic bowel habit. Changes in gastrointestinal motor function, enhanced perception of stimuli arising from the gut wall and psychosocial factors are thought to be major contributors for symptom generation. In recent years, several additional factors have been identified and postulated to interact with these classical mechanisms. Reduced ability to expel intestinal <e>gas</e> with consequent gas trapping and bowel distension may contribute to abdominal discomfort/pain and bloating. Abnormal activation of certain brain regions following painful stimulation of the rectum suggests altered processing of afferent signals. An acute gastrointestinal infection is now a recognized aetiological factor for symptom development in a subset of IBS patients (i.e. post-infectious IBS), who are probably unable to down-regulate the initial inflammatory stimulus efficiently. Furthermore, low-grade inflammatory infiltration and activation of mast cells in proximity to nerves in the colonic mucosa may also participate in the frequency and severity of perceived abdominal pain in post-infectious and non-specific IBS. Initial evidence suggests the existence of changes in gut microflora, serotonin metabolism and a genetic contribution in IBS pathophysiology. These novel mechanisms may aid a better understanding of the complex pathophysiology of IBS and to develop new therapies.",M2

15138961,"Hepatic portal venous <e>gas</e>: clinical significance of computed tomography findings.Hepatic portal venous gas (HPVG) is a rare radiographic finding of significance. Most cases with HPVG are related to mesenteric ischemia that have been associated with extended bowel necrosis and fatal outcome. With the help of computed tomography (CT) in early diagnosis of HPVG, the clinical outcome of patients with mesenteric ischemia has improved. There has been also an increasing rate of detection of HPVG with certain nonischemic conditions. In this report, we present two cases demonstrating HPVG unrelated to mesenteric ischemia. One patient with cholangitis presented abdominal pain with local peritonitis and survived after appropriate antibiotic treatment. Laparotomy was avoided as a result of lack of CT evidence of ischemic bowel disease besides the presence of HPVG. The other case had severe enteritis. Although his CT finding preluded ischemic bowel disease, conservative treatment was implemented because of the absence of peritoneal signs or clinical toxic symptoms. Therefore, whenever HPVG is detected on CT, urgent exploratory laparotomy is only mandatory in a patient with whom intestinal ischemia or infarction is suspected on the basis of radiologic and clinical findings. On the other hand, unnecessary exploratory laparotomy should be avoided in nonischemic conditions that are usually associated with a better clinical outcome if appropriate therapy is prompted for the underlying diseases. Patients with radiographic diagnosis of HPVG should receive a detailed history review and physical examination. The patient's underlying condition should be determined to provide a solid ground for exploratory laparotomy. A flow chart is presented for facilitating the management of patients with HPVG in the ED.",M2
14994113,"Effect of hysterectomy on bowel function.PURPOSE: Hysterectomy is the most common major gynecologic procedure. Unwanted postoperative effects on bowel function are a topic of recent debate. The aim of the present study was to prospectively evaluate the influence of hysterectomy on bowel function. METHODS: One hundred and twenty consecutive patients undergoing hysterectomy for benign conditions answered a questionnaire covering bowel habits and symptoms preoperatively and at 6 and 12 months postoperatively. Forty-four patients underwent vaginal hysterectomy and 76 underwent abdominal hysterectomy. Concomitant bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy was performed in 17 patients. RESULTS: After abdominal hysterectomy, patients reported increased symptoms of <e>gas</e> incontinence, urge to defecate, and inability to distinguish between gas and feces ( P &lt; 0.05). There was a tendency of increased fecal incontinence. Subgroup analysis indicated that concomitant bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy resulted in an increased risk of fecal incontinence. No significant changes were detected in symptoms associated with constipation. Mean defecation frequency increased and the frequency of pelvic heaviness symptoms was reduced. After vaginal hysterectomy, there was no increased frequency of incontinence or constipation symptoms. The frequency of pelvic heaviness symptoms was reduced. CONCLUSIONS: Patients undergoing abdominal hysterectomy may run an increased risk for developing mild to moderate anal incontinence postoperatively and this risk is increased by simultaneous bilateral salpingo-oopherectomy. An increased risk of anal incontience symptoms could not be identified in patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy. Our study does not support the assumption that hysterectomy is associated with de novo or deteriorating constipation.",M2

12966230,"Role of alimentation in irritable bowel syndrome.BACKGROUND: Different food items are made responsible for irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms, but the physiopathology of IBS remains unclear. AIMS: During a meeting in Nice, France, experts of the European Working Team of the IBiS Club discussed selected data regarding the relationships between alimentation, food items (including fibers) and IBS symptoms. METHODS/RESULTS: Food allergy remains a difficult diagnosis, but medical and general history, presence of general symptoms such as skin rash, and hypersensitivity tests may help in achieving a positive diagnosis. On the other hand, food intolerance is more confusing because of the subjectivity of the relationship between ingestion of certain foods and the appearance of clinical symptoms. Different food items which are commonly implicated in adverse reactions mimicking IBS were found to be stimulants for the gut, suggesting that patients with predominant diarrhea IBS have to be carefully questioned about consumption of different kinds of food (i.e., coffee, alcohol, chewing gum, soft drinks) and not only on lactose ingestion. <e>Gas</e> production is discussed on the basis of retention of intestinal gas as well as on malabsorption of fermentable substrates. The role of a large amount of this kind of substrate reaching the colon is suggested as a potential mechanism of IBS-type symptoms in overeating patients. Regarding the role of fiber in IBS, the expert group concluded that fibers are not inert substances and that they could trigger pain or bloating in some IBS patients.

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Two hundred forty three consecutive patients were operated laparoscopically. The surgical procedures were complete fundoplication with division of short vessels (Nissen: 80 patients), without division of short vessels (Nissen-Rossetti: 68 patients) or partial fundoplication of 270 degrees (Toupet: 95 patients). The mean follow-up was 38 months. Functional results were evaluated in 225 patients (92.5%) using a questionnaire with visual analog scales. RESULTS: The morbidity rate was 5%, higher after Nissen procedure (6.5%). With a follow-up of 3 months: a dysphagia coted 5/10, a <e>gas</e> bloat syndrome coted 4/10 and colon distension present in 61% of patients, were significantly more frequent after Nissen procedure. GERD recurred early in 4.5% of patients. With a follow-up of 38 months: dysphagia rate (coted 1/10) was significantly higher after Nissen. Dysphagia still persisted in 8 patients (9%) after Nissen. Colon distension and flatulence were more present after Nissen fundoplication. GERD recurrence rate was 12%. Pyrosis was significantly higher after Toupet fundoplication. Continuous medical treatment was necessary in 19 patients (8%). The satisfaction of patients was coted 7.5/10 without difference between to the three types of fundoplication.

DESIGN: Randomized, controlled, crossover trial. SUBJECTS/SETTING: Ten community-based subjects who malabsorb lactose. INTERVENTION: Ingestion of 2 standard servings of milk-based supplements (a powder reconstituted in fat-free milk or a ready-to-drink preparation) or low-lactose control preparations. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Frequency of flatus passage and subjective impression of bloating, flatulence, and abdominal discomfort. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Wilcoxon signed-rank test. RESULTS: The high lactose content (27 g) of 2 servings of the powder-based supplement ingested without other food resulted in a marked increase in daily flatus passages from the basal level of 9.7+/-8.2 to 30+/-14 (mean+/-SD), and a significant increase in the subjects' perception of gas. In contrast, the lower lactose content (18.4 g) of 2 servings of a ready-to-drink supplement resulted in a flatus frequency of 17+/-10 (P=.14 vs baseline) and no significant increase in the perception of increased gas. Neither supplement resulted in a significant increase in bloating, abdominal pain, or diarrhea. The lactose content of the liquid supplement was reduced by 80% following overnight incubation with an over-the-counter lactase preparation. APPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Persons who malabsorb lactose should be aware that sizable increases in rectal gas commonly occur when milk-based powders reconstituted in milk are used as meal replacements. In contrast, gas problems probably will be minor following ingestion of 2 doses of a ready-to-drink, milk-based supplement. The lactose content of these supplements can be markedly reduced by overnight incubation with over-the-counter lactase preparations, and this manipulation should be beneficial for subjects troubled by the increased gas caused by the consumption of lactose-containing supplements.",M2

The purpose of this study was to evaluate a preliminary outcome tool for fecal incontinence. METHOD: Since 1994 an extensive database has prospectively been collected on all females undergoing an overlapping sphincter repair for fecal incontinence by a single surgeon. A simple incontinence form designed to examine outcome, developed by colon and rectal surgeons, was filled out preoperatively and postoperatively. RESULTS: Of 206 females evaluated for surgical treatment of their fecal incontinence, 65 underwent surgical treatment from January 1994 until July 1999. The mean age was 49 (range, 23-80) years, and the mean follow-up was 10 (range, 1-50) months. When comparing each variable (problems holding <e>gas</e>, staining of undergarments, accidental bowel movements, and need to wear pads) and lifestyle issue (physical, social, and sexual activities) preoperatively and postoperatively, there was significant improvement in all areas. Three parameters were chosen (change in accidental bowel movements, improvement in two of three lifestyle areas, and improvement in one of three lifestyle areas) to examine individual items from the database and to determine if they affected outcome. No single variable has a significant effect on the outcome. A scoring system was devised from the questionnaire. From preoperatively to postoperatively, there was a median 14-point improvement that was statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: This preliminary tool to examine outcome for fecal incontinence measures parameters that are significantly improved by overlapping sphincteroplasty.

This study was undertaken to determine the morbidity and efficacy of the cutting seton in the management of complex anal fistulas at the King Faisal Specialist Hospital. METHODS: All patients who had a cutting seton inserted in the colorectal unit at King Faisal Specialist Hospital between 1990 and 1998 were identified from a colorectal data base. The charts of these patients were examined and form the basis of this report. Setons were inserted and tied under general anesthesia after the fistula tract had been identified. All fistulas were transsphincteric, and if it seemed that more than 30 percent of the internal sphincter would need to be divided to  lay open  the tract, a seton was used. Fistulas were designated  high  if the internal opening was above the level of the anal crypts. Setons were tightened under general anesthesia at intervals of three to four weeks until cutting was complete. Patients were followed up until wounds had healed and fistula symptoms had resolved. RESULTS: Data from 47 patients were analyzed. The mean duration of disease before surgery was 39.1 months. Twenty-five patients had had previous anorectal abscess drainage. The mean number of previous fistula operations was 2.2. Before seton insertion five patients were incontinent to gas, two to liquid stool, and none to solid stool. Continence status before seton surgery was unknown in 11 patients. There were 16  high  fistulas. Methylene blue dye was used to identify the internal opening in 14 patients when simple probing failed. Setons were tightened on three or more occasions in 12 patients, twice in 19 patients, and once in 16 patients. Mean perineal wound healing time was six months. The mean length of follow-up was 1.1 years, and during this time one fistula recurred. After treatment a total of 17 patients (36.2 percent) were incontinent to gas, 4 to liquid feces (8.5 percent), and 1 to solid feces (2.3 percent). Four patients complained of soiling. Of previously continent patients, 9.5 percent were significantly incontinent to gas, but in addition 21.4 percent were  occasionally  incontinent for gas. CONCLUSION: The use of the cutting seton resulted in a significant gas incontinence rate of 9.5 percent after a mean follow-up of 1.1 years. Only 1 fistula recurred.",M2
11294313,"Administration of charcoal, Yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate to reduce malodorous flatulence in dogs.OBJECTIVE: To determine whether feeding activated charcoal, Yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate would ameliorate the frequency and odor characteristics of flatulence in dogs. DESIGN: In vitro screening of active agents followed by a randomized controlled trial. ANIMALS: 8 adult dogs. PROCEDURE: A fecal fermentation system was used to assess the effects of activated charcoal, Yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate alone and in combination on total <e>gas</e> production and production of hydrogen sulfide, the primary determinant of flatus malodor in dogs. All 3 agents were subsequently incorporated into edible treats that were fed 30 minutes after the dogs ate their daily rations, and the number, frequency, and odor characteristics of flatulence were measured for 5 hours, using a device that sampled rectal gases and monitored hydrogen sulfide concentrations. RESULT: Total gas production and number and frequency of flatulence episodes were unaffected by any of the agents. Production of hydrogen sulfide in vitro was significantly reduced by charcoal, Yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate by 71, 38, and 58%, respectively, and was reduced by 86% by the combination of the 3 agents. Consumption of the 3 agents was associated with a significant decrease (86%) in the percentage of flatulence episodes with bad or unbearable odor and a proportional increase in the percentage of episodes of no or only slightly noticeable odor. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggest that activated charcoal, Yucca schidigera, and zinc acetate reduce malodor of flatus in dogs by altering the production or availability of hydrogen sulfide in the large intestine.",M2

10930893,"Non-absorbable antibiotics for managing intestinal <e>gas</e> production and gas-related symptoms.BACKGROUND: Simethicone, activated charcoal and antimicrobial drugs have been used to treat gas-related symptoms with conflicting results. AIM: To study the relationship between gaseous symptoms and colonic gas production and to test the efficacy of rifaximin, a new non-absorbable antimicrobial agent, on these symptoms. METHODS: Intestinal gas production was measured by hydrogen (H2) and methane (CH4) breath testing after lactulose in 21 healthy volunteers and 34 functional patients. Only the 34 functional patients took part in a double-blind, double-dummy controlled trial, receiving, at random, rifaximin (400 mg b.d per 7 days), or activated charcoal (400 mg b.d per 7 days). The following parameters were evaluated at the start of the study and 1 and 10 days after therapy: bloating, abdominal pain, number of flatus episodes, abdominal girth, and cumulative breath H2 excretion. RESULTS: Hydrogen excretion was greater in functional patients than in healthy volunteers. Rifaximin, but not activated charcoal, led to a significant reduction in H2 excretion and overall severity of symptoms. In particular, in patients treated with rifaximin, a significant reduction in the mean number of flatus episodes and of mean abdominal girth was evident. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with gas-related symptoms the colonic production of H2 is increased. Rifaximin significantly reduces this production and the excessive number of flatus episodes.",M2
10925977,"Quantitative analysis of bowel <e>gas</e> using plain abdominal radiograph in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.OBJECTIVE: Ideally, the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) would be achieved using a minimal number of procedures. It is presumed that bowel gas is related to IBS, and it is easily visualized by plain abdominal radiograph. In the present study, to clarify the relationship between IBS and the quantity of bowel gas, the measured bowel gas volume using plain abdominal radiographs was compared with the pathology of IBS. METHODS: Plain abdominal radiographs were digitized and transmitted to a computer (computed radiography) in 30 IBS patients and 30 normal controls. The quantity of bowel gas, determined as the pixel value on images and standardized by physique, was defined as the gas volume score (GVS). Using the mean +/- 2SD of GVS in the control group as the normal score, IBS patients were divided into three groups: high, normal, and low. To examine the sequential reproducibility of a similar quantity of bowel gas, a second plain abdominal radiography was performed about 2 months later, and the GVS were compared. The colonic transit time was determined using radiopaque markers. RESULTS: There was a strong correlation between the quantities of bowel gas measured by two independent gastroenterologists. The mean GVS of IBS patients was significantly higher than that in the control group (p &lt; 0.001). The sequential reproducibility was recognized in all 10 IBS patients. There was no significance between colonic transit time and GVS, nor between symptoms and GVS. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal gas was analyzed objectively by using GVS, and GVS was considered to represent a useful tool for the diagnosis of IBS.",M2

10811333,"Alteration of intestinal microflora is associated with reduction in abdominal bloating and pain in patients with irritable bowel syndrome.OBJECTIVE: The influence of the gastrointestinal (GI) microflora in patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) has not been clearly elucidated. This study was undertaken to see if patients with IBS have an imbalance in their normal colonic flora, as some bacterial taxa are more prone to <e>gas</e> production than others. We also wanted to study whether the flora could be altered by exogenous supplementation. In a previous study we have characterized the mucosa-associated lactobacilli in healthy individuals and found some strains with good colonizing ability. Upon colonization, they seemed to reduce gas formation. METHODS: The study comprised 60 patients with IBS and a normal colonoscopy or barium enema. Patients fulfilling the Rome criteria, without a history of malabsorption, and with normal blood tests underwent a sigmoidoscopy with biopsy. They were randomized into two groups, one receiving 400 ml per day of a rose-hip drink containing 5 x 10(7) cfu/ml of Lactobacillus plantarum (DSM 9843) and 0.009 g/ml oat flour, and the other group receiving a plain rose-hip drink, comparable in color, texture, and taste. The administration lasted for 4 wk. The patients recorded their own GI function, starting 2 wk before the study and continuing throughout the study period. Twelve months after the end of the study all patients were asked to complete the same questionnaire regarding their symptomatology as at the start of the study. RESULTS: All patients tolerated the products well. The patients receiving Lb. plantarum had these bacteria on rectal biopsies. There were no major changes of Enterobacteriaceae in either group, before or after the study, but the Enterococci increased in the placebo group and remained unchanged in the test group. Flatulence was rapidly and significantly reduced in the test group compared with the placebo group (number of days with abundant gas production, test group 6.5 before, 3.1 after vs 7.4 before and 5.6 after for the placebo group). Abdominal pain was reduced in both groups. At the 12-month follow-up, patients in the test group maintained a better overall GI function than control patients. There was no difference between the groups regarding bloating. Fifty-nine percent of the test group patients had a continuous intake of fermented products, whereas the corresponding figure for the control patients was 73%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the study indicate that the administration of Lb. plantarum with known probiotic properties decreased pain and flatulence in patients with IBS. The fiber content of the test solution was minimal and it is unlikely that the fiber content could have had any effect. This type of probiotic therapy warrants further studies in IBS patients.",M2
10649159,"Randomized trial of perineal massage during pregnancy: perineal symptoms three months after delivery.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of perineal massage performed during pregnancy on perineal symptoms 3 months after delivery. STUDY DESIGN: Pregnant women from 5 hospitals in the province of Quebec, Canada, participated in this single-blind, randomized, controlled trial. All participants received oral and written information on the prevention of perineal trauma. Women in the experimental group were taught the perineal massage technique and were asked to perform a 10-minute perineal massage daily from the 34th through 35th weeks of pregnancy until delivery. Participants completed a self-administered questionnaire on perineal pain, dyspareunia, sexual satisfaction, and incontinence of urine, flatus, and stool at the time of enrollment and 3 months after delivery. RESULTS: Among participants without a previous vaginal birth there were no differences between the massage (n = 283) and the control (n = 289) groups with respect to perineal pain, dyspareunia, sexual satisfaction, and incontinence of urine, <e>gas</e>, or stool 3 months post partum. Among women with a previous vaginal birth more women in the massage group (n = 187) than in the control group (n = 190) were free of perineal pain (93.6% vs 85.8%; P =.01) but the frequencies of dyspareunia and incontinence of urine, gas, or stool were similar in the 2 groups. CONCLUSIONS: Perineal massage during pregnancy neither impairs nor substantially protects perineal function at 3 months post partum.",M2
10613469,"Patient and surgeon ranking of the severity of symptoms associated with fecal incontinence: the fecal incontinence severity index.PURPOSE: The purpose of this research was to develop and evaluate a severity rating score for fecal incontinence, the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index. METHODS: The Fecal Incontinence Severity Index is based on a type x frequency matrix. The matrix includes four types of leakage commonly found in the fecal incontinent population: <e>gas</e>, mucus, and liquid and solid stool and five frequencies: one to three times per month, once per week, twice per week, once per day, and twice per day. The Fecal Incontinence Severity Index was developed using both colon and rectal surgeons and patient input for the specification of the weighting scores. RESULTS: Surgeons and patients had very similar weightings for each of the type x frequency combinations; significant differences occurred for only 3 of the 20 different weights. The Fecal Incontinence Severity Index score of a group of patients with fecal incontinence (N = 118) demonstrated significant correlations with three of the four scales found in a fecal incontinence quality-of-life scale. CONCLUSIONS: Evaluation of the Fecal Incontinence Severity Index indicates that the index is a tool that can be used to assess severity of fecal incontinence. Overall, patient and surgeon ratings of severity are similar, with minor differences associated with the accidental loss of solid stool.",M2
10389712,"Anal sphincter tears at vaginal delivery: risk factors and clinical outcome of primary repair.OBJECTIVE: To determine risk factors for obstetric anal sphincter tears and to evaluate symptomatic outcome of primary repair. METHODS: Obstetric-procedure, maternal, and fetal data were registered in 845 consecutive vaginally delivered women. Risk factors for anal sphincter tears were calculated by multiple logistic regression. All 808 Swedish-speaking women who delivered vaginally were included in a questionnaire study regarding anal incontinence in relation to the delivery. Questionnaires were distributed within the first few days postpartum, and at 5 and 9 months postpartum. RESULTS: Six percent of the women had a clinically detected sphincter tear at delivery. Sphincter tears were associated with nulliparity (odds ratio [OR] 9.8, 95% confidence interval [CI] 3.6, 26.2), postmaturity (OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.0, 6.2), fundal pressure (OR 4.6 95% CI 2.3, 7.9), midline episiotomy (OR 5.5 95% CI 1.4,18.7), and fetal weight in intervals of 250 g (OR 1.3 95% CI 1.1, 1.6). Fifty-four percent of women with repaired sphincter tears suffered from fecal or <e>gas</e> incontinence or both at 5 months and 41% at 9 months. Most of the symptoms were infrequent and mild. CONCLUSION: Several risk factors for sphincter tear were identified. Sphincter tear at vaginal delivery is a serious complication, and it is frequently associated with anal incontinence. Special attention should be directed toward risk factors for this complication. Symptoms of anal incontinence should explicitly be sought at follow-up after delivery.",M2
10333820,"Loperamide-simethicone vs loperamide alone, simethicone alone, and placebo in the treatment of acute diarrhea with <e>gas</e>-related abdominal discomfort. A randomized controlled trial.CONTEXT: Acute diarrhea with gas-related abdominal discomfort is a common, usually self-limited disorder with substantial social and economic impact. OBJECTIVE: To compare the efficacy and safety of a loperamide hydrochloride-simethicone combination product with those of loperamide alone, simethicone alone, and placebo in treating acute diarrhea with gas-related abdominal discomfort. DESIGN: Randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial of 48 hours' duration. SETTING: A primary care, ambulatory practice in Acapulco, Mexico. PATIENTS: A total of 493 outpatient adults aged 18 to 63 years, with acute nonspecific diarrhea with at least moderately severe abdominal discomfort. INTERVENTIONS: Each patient was randomly assigned to receive 2 chewable tablets containing loperamide hydrochloride, 2 mg, and simethicone, 125 mg (n = 124); loperamide hydrochloride, 2 mg (n = 123); simethicone, 125 mg (n = 123); or placebo (n = 123). This was followed by 1 tablet after each unformed stool, up to 4 tablets in any 24-hour period. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to last unformed stool and time to complete relief of gas-related abdominal discomfort were the protocol-specified primary outcomes. Secondary outcomes included time to complete relief of diarrhea, number of unformed stools, and patient-assessed variables at the end of the study (overall illness relief, diarrhea relief, and abdominal discomfort relief). RESULTS: Patients who received loperamide-simethicone had significantly (P &lt; .001) shorter time to last unformed stool and faster relief of gas-related abdominal discomfort than patients who received loperamide, simethicone, or placebo alone. Loperamide-simethicone was significantly (P &lt; or = .01) more effective than the other 3 treatments for all end-of-study patient-assessed outcomes and all clinically important secondary outcomes. No significant differences in adverse events were found among treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: The loperamide-simethicone combination chewable product provides faster and more complete relief of acute nonspecific diarrhea and associated gas-related abdominal discomfort (gas pain, cramps, gas pressure, and bloating) than either of its components or placebo. The combination is well tolerated.",M2
9820415,"Evaluation of an extremely flatulent patient: case report and proposed diagnostic and therapeutic approach.We recently encountered a patient with severe flatulence who previously had been subjected to innumerable diagnostic tests and ineffective therapies based on the belief that his rectal <e>gas</e> was produced in the colon. Analysis of three flatus samples demonstrated that nitrogen (N2) was the predominant flatus gas whereas the three gases produced in the gut (CO2, H2 [hydrogen], and CH4 [methane]) comprised &lt;16% of rectal gas. This result plus a series of other diagnostic tests clearly indicated that the patient's flatus was derived almost entirely from swallowed air. Based on this case, the present report summarizes available data on excessive flatulence and suggests a rational approach to the patient complaining of this problem. Particular emphasis is placed upon a sequential strategy consisting of: 1) a count of flatus passages to determine if the subject truly is abnormal (normal: &lt;20 passages/day); 2) an analysis of flatus to determine if the flatus originates from swallowed air (predominantly nitrogen) or intraluminal production (predominantly CO2, H2, and CH4); and 3) treatment based upon the origin of the rectal gas.",M2
9777836,"Abnormal colonic fermentation in irritable bowel syndrome.BACKGROUND: The cause of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is unknown. It may follow gastroenteritis and be associated with an abnormal gut flora and with food intolerance. Our study was designed to assess whether these factors were associated with colonic malfermentation. METHODS: We carried out a crossover controlled trial of a standard diet and an exclusion diet matched for macronutrients in six female IBS patients and six female controls. During the final 72 h on each diet, faecal excretion of fat, nitrogen, starch, and non-starch polysaccharide NSP was measured, and total excretion of hydrogen and methane collected over 24 h in a purpose-built 1.4 m3 whole-body calorimeter. Breath hydrogen and methane excretion were then measured for 3 h after 20 g oral lactulose. FINDINGS: The maximum rate of <e>gas</e> excretion was significantly greater in patients than in controls (2.4 mL/min IQR 1.7-2.6 vs 0.6, 0.4-1.1). Although total gas production in patients was not greater than in controls (median 527 mL/24 h IQR 387-660 vs 412, 234-507), hydrogen production was higher (332, 318-478 vs 162, 126-217, p=0.009). In patients, the exclusion diet reduced symptoms and produced a fall in maximum gas excretion (0.5 mL/min IQR 0.3-0.7). After lactulose, breath hydrogen was greater on the standard than on the exclusion diet. INTERPRETATION: Colonic-gas production, particularly of hydrogen, is greater in patients with IBS than in controls, and both symptoms and gas production are reduced by an exclusion diet. This reduction may be associated with alterations in the activity of hydrogen-consuming bacteria. Fermentation may be an important factor in the pathogenesis of IBS.",M2

However, extrapolation of this observation to subjects who use fibre is arguable since these individuals may have a propensity to gaseousness. In the present study, gaseous complaints during fibre ingestion were assessed in subjects who believed that a previous exposure to fibre induced <e>gas</e>. METHODS: In a double-blind protocol, subjects were randomized to one of four treatment periods, during which the regular diet was supplemented for 1-week periods with two daily doses of: placebo 10 g, psyllium 3.4 g, methylcellulose 2 g or lactulose 5 g. A symptom diary was maintained for 1-week periods on or off treatment. RESULTS: During treatment, the lactulose group passed gas significantly more often than did the psyllium or the methylcellulose group (P = 0.01). No other symptom was significantly different among the treatment groups. CONCLUSIONS: (1) psyllium and methylcellulose did not cause greater gaseous symptomatology than did placebo in subjects who believed that these preparations caused gas; and (2) subjects commonly misidentify dietary components that cause gaseous symptoms.",M2

8995944,"Influence of a methanogenic flora on the breath H2 and symptom response to ingestion of sorbitol or oat fiber.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: We investigated the possibility that a variant of the normal colonic flora, a high concentration of methanogens, influences the host's response to ingestion of nonabsorbable, fermentable materials. METHODS: To better evaluate symptomatic and breath H2 and methane (CH4) responses, subjects were placed on a basal diet (primarily rice and hamburger) that contained minimal amounts of nonabsorbable, fermentable substrate. A breath CH4/H2 ratio of greater or less than 1 on the second day of the basal diet was used to categorize subjects as high (N = 9) or low (N = 25) CH4 producers. After stabilization of the breath <e>gas</e> excretion (day 3 or 4 on the basal diet), the subjects ingested either sorbitol (8.8 g) or oat fiber (10.2 g). RESULTS: The low CH4 producers had a significantly higher (p &lt; 0.05) breath H2 concentration than the high producers on the basal diet and after ingestion of sorbitol (27.1 +/- 2.7 ppm vs 15.8 +/- 3.6 ppm) or oat fiber (13.1 +/- 0.08 ppm vs 9.6 +/- 1.2 ppm). Low producers of methane reported significantly increased bloating and cramping after sorbitol ingestion and increased bloating after fiber ingestion, whereas high CH4 producers reported no significant increase in these symptoms. CONCLUSION: The presence of a methanogenic flora is associated with a reduced symptomatic response to ingestion of nonabsorbable, fermentable material in healthy subjects. Manipulation of the normal flora could be of therapeutic value in nonmethanogenic patients with irritable bowel syndrome.",M2

Over a one-week period on their usual diet, subjects passed gas 10 +/- 1 times/day [upper limit of normal (mean + 2 SD): 20 times/day]. The addition of the nonabsorbable disaccharide lactulose (10 g/day) to the diet significantly (P &lt; 0.01) increased flatus frequency to 19 +/- 2.4 times per day. Gender, age, and the ability of an individual's colonic flora to produce methane had no significant influence on flatus frequency either on the basal or lactulose-supplemented diets. Some subjects consistently passed gas more often than did others. These individual differences appeared to result, in part, from differences in the ability of the flora to produce gas from a given quantity of fermentable material.",M2

Most often, patients do not have an actual increase in gastrointestinal gas volume, but rather their complaints derive from a misunderstanding of normal physiology, a misinterpretation of symptoms (colic), or an increase in intestinal sensitivity (irritable bowel syndrome). Symptoms from actual increases in intestinal gas volume are seen most frequently in children who swallow excessive amounts of air, have a dysmotility syndrome, or consume foods containing poorly absorbed carbohydrates. Although many therapies are used in the treatment of gas-related symptoms, under close scrutiny, the commonly recommended agents (e.g. simethicone) do not have proven efficacy.

8613657,"How much lactose is low lactose?OBJECTIVE: To test the hypothesis that complete elimination of lactose is not necessary to ensure tolerance by lactose maldigesters. DESIGN: Double-blind, randomized protocol in which challenge doses of 0, 2, 6, 12, and 20 g lactose in water were fed to subjects after a 12-hour fast. SUBJECTS: 13 healthy, free-living adults who were lactose maldigesters. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Breath hydrogen production (a measure of maldigestion) and symptom response to each challenge dose. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Analysis of variance was done to determine overall differences in mean hydrogen <e>gas</e> production (peak and sum of hours 1 through 8). Friedman's test was used to determine overall differences in the mean ranks for each symptom. Fisher's least significant difference test was used for multiple comparisons for hydrogen and symptom and data. RESULTS: Hydrogen production after consumption of the 0- and 2-g lactose doses was not significantly different. Hydrogen production increased with the 6-g dose. Intensity of abdominal pain increased when the dose of lactose was 12 g. Episodes of flatulence did not increase until the dose reached 20 g. No significant differences in the occurrence of diarrhea were observed after the five treatments. CONCLUSIONS: No significant increase in breath hydrogen production or intolerance symptoms occurred after consumption of a 2-g dose of lactose. Up to 6 g was tolerated, even though maldigestion could be measured at the 6-g dose. Thus, lactose maldigesters may be able to tolerate foods containing 6 g lactose or less per serving, such as hard cheeses and small servings (120 mL or less) of milk.",M2
8601379,"Flatus-related colorectal and anal motor events.Although complaints of excessive  <e>gas</e>  symptoms are frequently encountered in clinical practice, the physiologic and pathophysiologic grounds of flatus events are poorly understood, partly because of the social taboos associated with the topic and partly because of technical difficulties in measuring flatus. For these reasons, we studied the colorectal and anal motor events occurring during artificially evoked flatus events and compared them to those that occurred spontaneously. Five healthy male volunteers were studied by multilumen probes placed in the left colon and rectum and across the anal canal, to observe the flatus-related motor events that occurred after instillation of air into the colon. Flatus-related spontaneously occurring motor events were also checked in 24-hr motility tracings obtained in three patients with functional bowel disorders. Analysis of the tracings showed that both artificially induced and spontaneously occurring flatus-related motor phenomena were characterized by colonic propagated contractions associated with a rise in rectal pressure and early relaxation of the anal sphincter, in a sequence resembling that observed following swallowing. Spontaneous flatus events were associated with colonic waves of lesser amplitude than those following insufflation of air into the colon.",M2
8650927,"Evaluation of the pathogenesis of flatulence and abdominal cramps in patients with lactose malabsorption.Aim of this study was to assess whether the interindividual differences in the development of flatulence and cramps in patients with lactose malabsorption are due to the quantity of malabsorbed lactose or <e>gas</e> accumulation, or if accelerated intestinal transit or increased perception of gas might play a role. Hydrogen breath tests were performed in 43 patients with lactose malabsorption after ingestion of 50 g lactose and, on a separate day, 25 g lactulose. The unabsorbed amount of lactose, small bowel transit time and colonic hydrogen accumulation were assessed in patients who did and did not develop flatulence and cramps after ingestion of lactose. The unabsorbed amount of lactose, small bowel transit time and volume and rate of colonic hydrogen accumulation were the same in patients who did or did not have symptoms after lactose. Patients with flatulence and cramps had a significantly longer time interval between the onset of the increase and peak breath hydrogen concentration (p &lt; 0.05) and a significant correlation between the time of occurrence of peak symptoms and the time of peak breath hydrogen concentration (r = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001).

Stool consistencies was significantly looser in the IBS group relative to the control group. Menstrual cycle effects on symptoms were noted in all the groups. There were no significant differences in psychological distress between women with IBS and IBS-NP, but both groups reported significantly higher global distress than the control group. The lack of difference between the IBS and IBS-NP groups in contrast to the results of others, can be understood in terms of differences in recruitment strategies.",M2

7743764,"One-year acarbose treatment raises fasting serum acetate in diabetic patients.alpha-Glucosidase inhibitors such as acarbose improve blood glucose control in diabetes by delaying or reducing carbohydrate absorption. The fermentation of malabsorbed carbohydrate in the colon is associated with the production of <e>gas</e>, leading to flatulence, and short chain fatty acids such as acetate, which may have systemic effects. To see if acarbose raised fasting serum acetate in diabetic patients, we studied 85 subjects selected from the 267 who had completed a 1-year, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design study of the effects of acarbose in the treatment of diabetes. At baseline, there was no significant difference between the 44 subjects subsequently randomized to placebo and the 41 randomized to acarbose, respectively, in fasting serum acetate (80 +/- 5 vs 71 +/- 4 mumoll-1) or glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1C; 7.2 +/- 0.3 vs 7.4 +/- 0.3%). Compared to placebo, acarbose treatment significantly increased fasting serum acetate by 11 +/- 4 vs 2 +/- 3 mumoll-1 (p &lt; 0.02) and reduced HbA1C by -0.59 +/- 0.16 vs -0.13 +/- 0.20% (p &lt; 0.02). Acarbose treatment had no significant effect on serum cholesterol or non-esterified fatty acids, but was associated with a significant increase in flatulence. There was no relationship between changes in serum acetate and changes in HbA1C, serum cholesterol or symptoms. We conclude, in subjects with diabetes who tolerate therapy for a 1-year period, that acarbose treatment increases serum acetate. The magnitude of change in acetate was unrelated to side-effects or changes in blood glucose control or serum lipids.",M2

At the first test meal, group 1 received eight drops of alpha-galactosidase solution and group 2 received eight drops of placebo. After the meal, subjects were asked to keep a careful record of gastrointestinal symptoms, including occurrences of intestinal gas passage, for the next 6 hours. One week later, an identical test meal was served to each study subject and the solutions were reversed. Again subjects recorded their symptoms for the next 6 hours. Data were analyzed by means of paired t tests. RESULTS: The number of flatulence events per hour was significantly less in the group treated with alpha-galactosidase than placebo over the 6-hour follow-up period (F = 2.87, P = .016). When the two groups were compared at each follow-up interval, this difference was statistically significant only for the 5th hour after ingesting the test meal (t = 2.19, P = .04). No differences between the two groups were found in the extent of bloating or pain following the meal. CONCLUSIONS: Oral alpha-galactosidase solution is efficacious, at least in some patients, for the prophylaxis of gastrointestinal intolerance of oligosaccharides.",M2
8185044,"Spectrum of gastrointestinal symptoms after laparoscopic fundoplication.A total of 82 patients underwent laparoscopic fundoplication between October 1991 and September 1993. Operative complications were unusual (7%), and the procedure in one patient was converted to an open procedure. Postoperative complications including dysphagia, <e>gas</e> bloat, and reflux recurrence were also unusual (less than 10% at 6 weeks). However, the majority of patients (96%) experienced some gastrointestinal side effects in the postoperative period. Such side effects included early satiety (96%), hyperflatulence (82%), nausea (15%), odynophagia (5%), and diarrhea (26%). The majority of these side effects faded during the mean follow-up of 13 months but persisted in a few patients. The incidence of these problems corresponds with the incidence reported in the literature for open fundoplications. The etiology of these side effects and treatment used is presented in this review.",M2
8172152,"Delta 10 ppm versus delta 20 ppm: a reappraisal of diagnostic criteria for breath hydrogen testing in children.OBJECTIVE: To reevaluate the timing and level of rise in breath hydrogen (H2) excretion following oral lactose challenge in children with respect to the subsequent development of symptoms consistent with lactose intolerance. METHODS: Breath hydrogen test (BHT) data from 581 individuals &lt; 19 yr of age (mean age 7.4 yr), all of whom had a fasting baseline breath H2 concentration of &lt; 20 ppm, were reviewed. All subjects ingested 2 g/kg lactose (maximum 50 g) and had breath H2 analysis at 30-min intervals for 3 h. Symptoms of abdominal pain, bloating, <e>gas</e>, and diarrhea were monitored. RESULTS: Seventeen percent of subjects had no H2 detectable in their breath at any time, 41% had a rise &lt; 10 ppm from baseline, 6% increased 10-19 ppm, and 36% had a rise &gt; or = 20 ppm. Symptom development (gas, bloating, abdominal pain, diarrhea) was similar in the non-H2 excretors, the delta &lt; 10 ppm, and the delta 10-19 ppm groups. Compared to the &lt; 10 ppm or &lt; 20 ppm groups, subjects with a rise of &gt; or = 20 ppm were more likely to develop diarrhea (p &lt; 0.0001), gas (p &lt; 0.0001), bloating (p &lt; 0.0001), and abdominal pain (p &lt; 0.0001). Symptoms were more common in the &gt; or = 20 ppm group than in the delta 10-19 ppm group (p &lt; 0.02 for diarrhea, p &lt; 0.0001 for gas, bloating, and abdominal pain). Fifty-three percent of subjects with a rise in breath H2 &lt; 20 ppm reported symptoms during or after the BHT, and 9% of those with a rise &gt; or = 20 ppm were asymptomatic. CONCLUSION: A rise of breath H2 concentration of &gt; or = 20 ppm over baseline appears to correlate better with subsequent symptom development than does &gt; or = 10 ppm. However, the frequently poor association between symptoms of lactose intolerance and breath H2 excretion suggest caution in the interpretation of the clinical significance of the BHT.",M2
8314516,"Colonic hydrogen absorption: quantification of its effect on hydrogen accumulation caused by bacterial fermentation of carbohydrates.The aim of the study was to assess (quantitatively) colonic hydrogen absorption. Hydrogen volumes in flatus and breath were measured over periods of six hours in normal subjects during fasting and after ingestion of the non-absorbable carbohydrate lactulose to simulate the effect of fermentable dietary fibres. If less than 76 ml/6 h of hydrogen accumulated in the colon then all of it was absorbed, as suggested by the intercept of the regression line of the correlation between hydrogen volumes in flatus and breath after ingestion of lactulose. As total flatus volume increased, efficiency of colonic hydrogen absorption decreased from 90% to 20%. The positive correlation between hydrogen volumes of flatus and breath showed that the eightfold interindividual differences in flatus volume after ingestion of 12.5 g of lactulose were caused by differences in bacterial net <e>gas</e> production, not gas absorption. Differences in colonic gas emptying rate are the consequence rather than the cause of interindividual differences in flatus volume. In conclusion: (1) colonic hydrogen absorption is highly effective at low colonic hydrogen accumulation rates, but not at higher accumulation rates; (2) ineffective colonic gas absorption is the consequence and not the cause of high colonic gas accumulation rate after ingestion of non-absorbable carbohydrates; and (3) future therapeutic approaches to the large interindividual variability in colonic gas accumulation after ingestion of poorly absorbable fermentable carbohydrates, such as some kinds of dietary fibres, should be directed towards altering colonic bacterial metabolism.",M2
1451222,"Anaesthetic technique does not influence postoperative bowel function: a comparison of propofol, nitrous oxide and isoflurane.The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of propofol, nitrous oxide and isoflurane on recovery, postoperative bowel function and postoperative complications after major gastrointestinal surgery. Sixty patients undergoing elective colonic operations were included in the study. They were randomly allocated to anaesthesia with isoflurane-nitrous oxide, propofol-air, or propofol-nitrous oxide, with fentanyl and vecuronium being used in all three groups. The same anaesthetic and surgical teams performed all the operations. The postoperative course was judged once each day by the Acute Physiology Score (APS) based on the Apache II classification, passage of <e>gas</e>, tolerance of enteral feeding, hospital stay and complications up to 30 days after surgery. The demographic data, magnitude of operation, duration of operation, intraoperative blood loss, and post-operative analgesic needs were similar in the groups. In all groups the APS was normal by median day 1 (range 1-7). A similar impairment of bowel function after operation, with passage of gas median 3 (1-6) days after surgery and tolerance of enteral intake median day 5 (1-10), was found in all groups. The incidence of complications and the length of postoperative hospital stay, median 11 (6-45) days, did not differ among the groups. It is concluded that overall recovery, bowel function, postoperative hospital stay, and complications were not influenced by the anaesthetic technique.",M2
1397911,"Pain following colonoscopy: elimination with carbon dioxide.Fifty-six patients have been examined in a prospective randomized study on the effects of air and carbon dioxide on post-procedural discomfort following colonoscopy. A significant reduction in post-procedural pain was observed at 6 hours (p = &lt; 0.0005) and was still present the next day (p = 0.01). This was associated with a difference in the grading of flatus at 6 and 24 hours (p = &lt; 0.0001 and &lt; 0.05, respectively). An abdominal radiograph 1 hour after the procedure showed minimal <e>gas</e> in the CO2 patients, while the patients who had air showed distention of large and small bowel (p = &lt; 0.0001 and &lt; 0.01, respectively). Seventeen of 29 patients who had air suffered post-procedural pain, compared with 2 of 27 of the CO2 patients. Fifty-seven percent of the patients who were given air had colonic diameters over 6 cm on a 1-hour post-colonoscopy radiograph and 18% over 10-cm diameter. Provision by equipment manufacturers of simple and safe devices for routine delivery of CO2 for lower gastrointestinal endoscopy is long overdue.",M2

In a randomized, double-blind cross-over study, 10 healthy volunteers were given 30 g lactulose and 600 mg simethicone or placebo. End-expiratory breath samples were collected and analyzed for H2 and gastrointestinal symptoms registered. There were no differences in biochemical parameters or symptom score between simethicone and placebo. In contrast to previous studies, we used a sufficiently large dose of lactulose to produce gastrointestinal symptoms, a higher dose of simethicone and placebo tablets containing the same additives as the simethicone tablets. There was no demonstrable effect of simethicone on symptoms or intestinal gas production caused by carbohydrate malabsorption.",M2

This study aimed to estimate prevalence, to determine whether patients with irritable bowel syndrome are more likely to make such complaints, and to determine whether bowel complaints during menstruation are attributable to psychological traits such as increased somatization. To estimate prevalence, 369 clients of Planned Parenthood of Maryland were asked whether <e>gas</e>, diarrhea, or constipation occurred during menstruation. These subjects were compared with women referred to a gastroenterology clinic and found to have irritable bowel syndrome or functional bowel disorder (abdominal pain plus altered bowel habits but not satisfying restrictive criteria for irritable bowel syndrome). Thirty-four percent of 233 Planned Parenthood clients who denied symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome or functional bowel disorder reported that menstruation was associated with one or more bowel symptoms. Gastroenterology clinic patients with irritable bowel syndrome were significantly more likely to experience exacerbations of each of these bowel symptoms, but especially increased bowel gas. Self-reports of bowel symptoms during menstruation were not associated with psychological traits or with menses-related changes in affect.",M2

Half of them had significant trouble, such as incontinence for <e>gas</e>, dyspareunia, and pain. We performed anal pressure profilometry in 14 of these women and in ten controls for comparison, and found a significant reduced strength in the external anal sphincters of the studied group. When anal sphincter rupture extended through the rectal mucosa, the internal sphincter strength was also reduced. The persisting signs and symptoms of anal dysfunction indicate that women with anal sphincter rupture need more attention and follow-up.",M2
3966638,"Mechanisms of rectal continence. Lessons from the ileoanal procedure.To clarify mechanisms of rectal continence, we evaluated 34 patients who had straight or J-pouch ileoanal anastomosis. This evaluation included pressures, anal inhibitory reflex, neorectal capacity, neorectal compliance, and the ability to discriminate stool from <e>gas</e>. Both groups of patients had satisfactory anal sphincter resting pressures and neorectal capacities, and all could discriminate stool from gas despite the absence of any rectal mucosa. We conclude that normal rectal mucosa is not necessary to be able to discriminate stool from gas; a long rectal muscular cuff is not necessary for rectal sensation; essentially normal sphincter function is preserved, and this procedure does not normally fail because of inadequate sphincter function or the absence of the anal inhibitory reflex; and in the presence of normal sphincter function, continence is not dependent on the presence of normal mucosa or the anal inhibitory reflex but correlates with reservoir capacity and compliance as well as with the frequency and strength of intrinsic bowel contractions.",M2

This review describes the origins of intestinal <e>gas</e>, its composition and methods which have been developed for its analysis. Emphasis is placed upon the effects of legumes in the diet in producing excessive intestinal gas and, particularly, on the role of raffinose-type oligosaccharides, containing alpha-galactosidic groupings. Suggestions for overcoming the problem are presented, including drug treatment, enzyme treatment, food processing and plant breeding. It is emphasised that removal of all raffinose-oligosaccharides from beans does not remove the problem of flatulence in animals and man; the compounds responsible--though assumed to be polysaccharides (or polysaccharide-derived oligomers formed by processing or cooking)--have yet to be characterised.",M2
3604970,"Gaseous response to ingestion of a poorly absorbed fructo-oligosaccharide sweetener.Fructo-oligosaccharides are naturally occurring sweet substances that are poorly absorbed and have the potential to be clinically useful nonnutritive sweeteners. Because most nonabsorbed carbohydrates are fermented yielding <e>gas</e>, we assessed flatulent symptoms and H2 excretion during ingestion of fructo-oligosaccharide (5 g tid) for 12 d. Ten subjects had significantly greater flatulence while taking the oligosaccharide than did five subjects taking sucrose (5 g tid). Breath H2 after 10 g fructo-oligosaccharide was similar to that of 10 g lactulose, suggesting near total malabsorption of the fructo-oligosaccharide. Although previous studies found a marked diminution in breath H2 after prolonged exposure to lactulose, breath H2 response increased by 50% after a 12-d period on the oligosaccharide and gaseous symptoms did not improve. We conclude that adaptation of colonic bacteria to carbohydrate malabsorption is variable and may depend upon quantity or nature of the carbohydrate.",M2
