20308399,"Effect of the duration of prefeeding on amino acid digestibility of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles in broiler chicken.The objective of this study was to determine the effect of the duration of prefeeding on prececal amino acid (<e>AA</e>) digestibility of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) in broilers. The experimental diets with DDGS at levels of 0, 10, and 20% were offered ad libitum for 7, 5, and 3 d, starting on 14, 16, and 18 d of age. Titanium dioxide was used as an indigestible marker. Six pens of 10 birds were allocated to each treatment. Digesta was sampled on a pen basis from the distal two-thirds of the intestine section between Meckel's diverticulum and 2 cm anterior to the ileo-ceca-colonic junction. Ingested and digested amounts of AA were determined for each pen. Digestibility of AA in the diets was not significantly affected by the duration of prefeeding but was significantly reduced by inclusion of DDGS. Digestibility of AA in DDGS was determined by using a linear regression approach. The digestibility of AA in DDGS ranged from 76% (Arg, 5 d of feeding) to 33% (Asp, 3 d of feeding). There was no significant effect of prefeeding time on AA digestibility of DDGS. Lysine digestibility of DDGS was 72%. The mean digestibility of the AA Arg, Cys, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, and Val of DDGS across the 3 prefeeding times was 66%. This study gave evidence that 3 d of prefeeding a diet is sufficient in studying prececal AA digestibility in broilers when low-digestible feeds are used.",M1
20184306,"Metal cation dependence of interactions with amino acids: bond energies of Rb+ to Gly, Ser, Thr, and Pro.The interactions of rubidium cations with the four amino acids (<e>AA</e>), glycine (Gly), serine (Ser), threonine (Thr), and proline (Pro), are examined in detail. Experimentally, the bond energies are determined using threshold collision-induced dissociation of the Rb(+)(AA) complexes with xenon in a guided ion beam tandem mass spectrometer. Analyses of the energy dependent cross sections include consideration of unimolecular decay rates, internal energy of reactant ions, and multiple ion-molecule collisions. 0 K bond energies of 108.9 +/- 7.0, 115.7 +/- 4.9, 122.1 +/- 4.6, and 125.2 +/- 4.5 kJ/mol are determined for complexes of Rb(+) with Gly, Ser, Thr, and Pro, respectively. Quantum chemical calculations are conducted at the B3LYP, B3P86, and MP2(full) levels of theory with geometries and zero point energies calculated at the B3LYP level using both HW*/6-311+G(2d,2p) and Def2TZVP basis sets. Results obtained using the former basis sets are systematically low compared to the experimental bond energies, whereas the latter basis sets show good agreement. For Rb(+)(Gly), the ground state conformer has the rubidium ion binding to the carbonyl group of the carboxylic acid, and a similar geometry is found for Rb(+)(Pro) except the secondary nitrogen accepts the carboxylic acid hydrogen to form the zwitterionic structure. Both Rb(+)(Ser) and Rb(+)(Thr) are found to have tridentate binding at the B3LYP and MP2(full) levels, whereas the B3P86 slightly prefers binding Rb(+) at the carboxylic acid. Comparison of these results to those for the lighter alkali ions provides insight into the trends in binding affinities and structures associated with metal cation variations.",M1
20166661,"Changes in composition and amino acid profile during dry grind ethanol processing from corn and estimation of yeast contribution toward DDGS proteins.Three sets of samples, consisting of ground corn, yeast, intermediate products, and DDGS, were provided by three commercial dry grind ethanol plants in Iowa and freeze dried before chemical analysis. On average, ground corn contained 70.23% starch, 7.65% protein, 3.26% oil, 1.29% ash, 87.79% total carbohydrate (CHO), and 17.57% total nonstarch CHO, dry matter basis. Results from Plant 1 samples showed that compared to ground corn, there was a slight but significant increase in the contents of protein, amino acids (<e>AA</e>), oil, and ash before fermentation, although starch/dextrin decreased sharply upon saccharification. After fermentation, starch content further decreased to about 6.0%, while protein, oil, and ash contents increased over 3-fold. AA increased 2.0-3.5-fold. Total CHO content decreased by 40%, and the content of total nonstarch CHO increased over 2.5-fold. Concentrations of these attributes fluctuated slightly in the remaining downstream products, but oil and ash were concentrated in thin stillage, while protein was concentrated in distiller grains upon centrifugation. When AA composition is expressed in relative % (protein basis), its changes did not follow that of protein concentration, but the influence of yeast AA profiles on those of downstream products became apparent. Accordingly, a multiple linear regression model for the AA profile of a downstream product as a function of AA profiles of ground corn and yeast was proposed. Regression results indicated that, with an r(2) = 0.95, yeast contributed about 20% toward DDGS proteins, and the rest came from corn. Data from Plants 2 and 3 confirmed those found with Plant 1 samples.",M1
20102672,"Digestion rate of dietary starch affects systemic circulation of amino acids in weaned pigs.The present study was conducted to evaluate the in vitro and in vivo digestibility of dietary starch and its digestive behaviour on the systemic circulating amino acids (<e>AA</e>) in weaned pigs. Eighteen weanling pigs surgically fitted with a catheter in the jugular vein were randomly assigned to three dietary treatment groups. Sticky rice starch (SRS) was hydrolysed more quickly in vitro (P &lt; 0.05) than maize starch (MS) and resistant starch (RS), and was almost completely hydrolysed within 4 h. The in vivo digestibility of dietary starch in different segments of the small intestine was significantly different. SRS was digested (81.9 %; P &lt; 0.05) in the anterior jejunum, but not more than half of the MS and RS was digested in the same segment of the small intestine. The digestibilities of isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, valine, alanine, aspartate and serine in the SRS group were higher than in the MS group (P &lt; 0.05), and all nutritionally indispensable and dispensable AA in the SRS group were higher when compared with those in the RS group (P &lt; 0.05). The serum concentrations of nutritionally indispensable AA, proline and serine in the three groups were increased to a peak point within 1.5 h postprandially then decreased gradually; however, the time that serum concentrations of alanine, aspartate, glutamate and glycine in each group increased to a peak point was different. The concentrations of nutritionally indispensable AA, including arginine, cystine, histidine, isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine at 09.30 hours and arginine, cystine, histidine, isoleucine, methionine, phenylalanine, threonine, tryptophan, tyrosine and valine at 13.30 hours in the SRS group were higher than in the MS group (P &lt; 0.05); all nutritionally indispensable AA in the SRS group were higher than in the RS group at 09.30 and 13.30 hours (P &lt; 0.05), respectively. We conclude that dietary starches digested rapidly in vitro have higher digestibility in the anterior small intestine of pigs. Diets containing rapidly digestible starch ameliorate the digestive and absorptive function and regulate AA metabolism to beneficially increase the entry of dietary AA into the systemic circulation in pigs.",M1
20092318,"Non-native side chain IR probe in peptides: ab initio computation and 1D and 2D IR spectral simulation.Infrared frequency region of 2000-2600 cm(-1) (i.e., ca. 4-5 microm in wavelength) is a well-known open spectral window for peptides and proteins. In this work, six unnatural amino acids (unAAs) were designed to have characteristic absorption bands located in this region. Key chemical groups that served as side chains in these unAAs are C[triple bond]C, Phe-C[triple bond]C, N=C=O, N=C=S, P-H, and Si-H, respectively. Cysteine (a natural <e>AA</e> having S-H in side chain) was also studied for comparison. The anharmonic vibrational properties, including frequencies, anharmonicities, and intermode couplings, were examined using the density functional theory. Broadband linear infrared (IR) and two-dimensional (2D) IR spectra were simulated for each molecule. It is found that all of the side chain modes have significant overtone diagonal anharmonicities. All have moderate transition dipole strengths except the C[triple bond]C and S-H stretching modes, in comparison with the C=O stretching mode. In each case, a collection of 2D IR cross peaks were predicted to appear due to the presence of the side chain groups, whose strengths are closely related to the intramolecular anharmonic interactions, and to the transition dipole strengths of the coupled vibrators. Further, potential energy distribution analysis and high-order anharmonic constant computation showed that these IR probes possess a varying degree of mode localization. The results suggest that these IR probes are potentially useful in complementing the well-studied amide-I mode, to investigate structures and dynamics of peptides and proteins.",M1
20089194,"Nutritional control of gene expression in Drosophila larvae via TOR, Myc and a novel cis-regulatory element.BACKGROUND: Nutrient availability is a key determinant of eukaryotic cell growth. In unicellular organisms many signaling and transcriptional networks link nutrient availability to the expression of metabolic genes required for growth. However, less is known about the corresponding mechanisms that operate in metazoans. We used gene expression profiling to explore this issue in developing Drosophila larvae. RESULTS: We found that starvation for dietary amino acids (<e>AA</e>'s) leads to dynamic changes in transcript levels of many metabolic genes. The conserved insulin/PI3K and TOR signaling pathways mediate nutrition-dependent growth in Drosophila and other animals. We found that many AA starvation-responsive transcripts were also altered in TOR mutants. In contrast, although PI3K overexpression induced robust changes in the expression of many metabolic genes, these changes showed limited overlap with the AA starvation expression profile. We did however identify a strong overlap between genes regulated by the transcription factor, Myc, and AA starvation-responsive genes, particularly those involved in ribosome biogenesis, protein synthesis and mitochondrial function. The consensus Myc DNA binding site is enriched in promoters of these AA starvation genes, and we found that Myc overexpression could bypass dietary AA to induce expression of these genes. We also identified another sequence motif (Motif 1) enriched in the promoters of AA starvation-responsive genes. We showed that Motif 1 was both necessary and sufficient to mediate transcriptional responses to dietary AA in larvae. CONCLUSIONS: Our data suggest that many of the transcriptional effects of amino acids are mediated via signaling through the TOR pathway in Drosophila larvae. We also find that these transcriptional effects are mediated through at least two mechanisms: via the transcription factor Myc, and via the Motif 1 cis-regulatory element. These studies begin to elucidate a nutrient-responsive signaling network that controls metabolic gene transcription in Drosophila.",M1
20079672,"Molecular modeling study on orphan human protein CYP4A22 for identification of potential ligand binding site.A molecular structure is an essential source to identify ligand binding sites in orphan human cytochrome P450 4A22 (CYP4A22) that belongs to family 4, which is known to be involved in the regulation of blood pressure. Thus, a homology model has been constructed for CYP4A22 and refined by molecular dynamics simulation (MDS). Subsequently, molecular docking was performed with possible substrates, arachidonic acid (essential fatty acid, <e>AA</e>) and erythromycin (therapeutic drug, ERY). These complexes were also subjected to MDS, which helped in predicting the energetically favorable binding sites for these ligands. Putative substrate recognition sites (SRSs) of this protein provide highly hydrophobic binding pockets for the target ligands. A few key ligand binding residues identified in this study indicates that they could also play a major role in ligand-channeling (F122, L132 and C230). Furthermore, it appears that they might serve critical support for the catalytic reaction center (E321, F450, P449 and R455). Structural analysis of channels proposed that the conformational changes might have originated from the active site upon ligand binding and transferred to the rest of the protein via SRSs, which could thereby regulate the channels in CYP4A22. Most of our prediction results are supported by other research groups. In summary, the first molecular modeling study of CYP4A22 yields structural knowledge, which would be helpful to design structure-based-drugs and functional experiments for the target protein.",M1
20075281,"Uric acid, urea, and ammonia concentrations in serum and uric acid concentration in excreta as indicators of amino acid utilization in diets for broilers.Five experiments were conducted to determine if serum uric acid, serum urea N (SUN), serum ammonia, and the uric acid content of the excreta (UAE) could be used to determine the efficacy of amino acid (<e>AA</e>) utilization in diets for broilers. All experiments were conducted with Ross x Ross 308 or 708 broilers from 0 to 14 or 0 to 18 d posthatching in brooder batteries. Treatments had 6 or 7 replications with at least 6 broilers per replicate pen. All diets were corn and soybean meal-based and formulated to contain 1.0% Ca and 0.45% nonphytate P and to meet or exceed the requirements of all nutrient requirements except total Lys, Met, and Thr (experiment 1) or Met (experiments 2 to 5). Experiment 1 consisted of 2 dietary treatments. Diet 1 was formulated to be deficient in Lys, Thr, and Met and diet 2 was formulated to be adequate in all nutrients. Broilers fed the AA-adequate diet had increased (P&lt;0.01 to 0.03) ADG, ADFI, and G:F compared with broilers fed the AA-deficient diet. Serum uric acid, SUN, serum ammonia, and UAE were not affected (P=0.34 to 0.70) by dietary treatment. In experiments 2 to 5, diets contained 1.35% total Lys, 2 levels of Met (0.50 or 0.76 TSAA:Lys), and without or with Gly supplementation up to 2.32% Gly+Ser. Broilers fed diets containing supplemental Met in experiments 2 to 5 had increased (P=0.01 to 0.03) ADG, ADFI, and G:F. Gain:feed was increased (P=0.01 to 0.07) in broilers fed supplemental Gly. Serum uric acid and SUN were decreased (P&lt;0.01) after a 2-h fast in broilers fed supplemental Met and Gly. Serum uric acid and SUN also were decreased at other times after fasting, but the 2-h fast gave the most consistent response. Uric acid content of the excreta was decreased (P&lt;0.01) in broilers fed supplemental Met. Serum ammonia was decreased (P&lt;0.01 to 0.02) in experiments 2, 3, and 4 at varying times postfeeding but was not affected by diet in experiment 5. The results of this research indicate that serum uric acid, SUN, and UAE concentrations can be used as an indicator of AA utilization in broilers fed AA-adequate and AA-deficient diets.",M1
20059915,"The frequency of unilateral milking alters leucine metabolism and amino acid removal by the mammary gland of lactating goats.The objective of this study was to test whether mammary <e>AA</e> metabolism and blood flow (BF) fluctuate in relation to changes in milk protein yield brought about by unilateral milking frequency. To investigate these relationships, the vascular systems of the mammary glands of 4 lactating goats were separated by ligation and flow probes were fitted around the external pudic artery of each gland. Goats were subjected to 3 consecutive periods (5 d each) during which 1) both glands were milked twice daily (2x; period 1); 2) glands were unilaterally milked, with gland A milked 8 times daily and gland B milked incompletely (30% of period 1 milk yield retained in the gland) once daily (8x vs. 1x; period 2); and 3) both glands milked twice daily (2x; period 3). On d 5 of periods 1 (2x) and 2 (8x vs. 1x), arteriovenous [1-(13)C]Leu kinetics were monitored for each gland. Milk protein yield was greater for gland A compared with gland B. After 2x milking resumed in period 3, yields for both glands returned to period 1 levels. Similarly, BF increased (19%) for gland A (8x), whereas BF was decreased (21%) for gland B (1x). For both glands, BF returned to previous levels when 2x milking resumed in period 3. Mammary net uptakes and oxidation of Leu were greater for the gland milked 8x compared with that milked 1x. Net uptakes from blood of Ile, Leu, Val, Lys, Pro, and Arg were greater (39-79%) for the 8x compared with the 1x gland. In conclusion, the excess removal and oxidation by the mammary gland of some amino acids appears an obligatory requirement to support increases or decreases in milk protein yield when milking frequency is altered.",M1
20059914,"Nutrient availability and lactogenic hormones regulate mammary protein synthesis through the mammalian target of rapamycin signaling pathway.The nutritional and endocrine factors affecting protein translation in the bovine mammary gland, and the molecular mechanisms mediating their effects, are not well understood. The objective of this study was to assess the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway in the regulation of mammary protein synthesis by nutrients and hormones. Mammary epithelial acini isolated from lactating dairy cows were treated in medium containing, alone or in combination, a mixture of <e>AA</e> or glucose and acetate (GA) as energy substrates, or a combination of the lactogenic hormones hydrocortisone, insulin, and prolactin (HIP). Changes in the rate of mammary protein synthesis and the phosphorylation state of components of the mTOR signaling pathway were measured. Mammary protein synthesis was 50% higher with increased availability of AA in medium. The presence of GA or treatment of mammary acini with HIP alone did not affect mammary protein synthesis. The stimulation of mammary protein synthesis by AA was enhanced by HIP treatment, but not by the presence of GA in medium. Treatment of mammary acini with HIP induced the phosphorylation of protein kinase B. This effect was augmented in the presence of either AA or GA in medium. The stimulation of mammary protein synthesis by AA and its enhancement by HIP were associated with increased phosphorylation of the mTOR substrates, p70 ribosomal protein S6 kinase-1, and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E (eIF4E)-binding protein-1 (4E-BP1), and dissociation of 4E-BP1 from eIF4E. The results suggest that nutrients and hormones may modulate mammary protein synthesis through the mTOR signaling pathway.",M1
20057337,"Glutathione synthesis rates in early postnatal life.Preterm infants have diminished antioxidant defenses. Glutathione (GSH), the main intracellular antioxidant, increases upon amino acid (<e>AA</e>) administration in preterm infants, without an accompanying rise of the fractional synthesis rate of GSH (FSRGSH) This study investigated the mechanism behind this increased GSH concentration by determining GSH synthesis in the first days after birth using stable isotope techniques in very low-birth-weight (VLBW) infants receiving i.v. AAs. Advanced oxidized protein products (AOPPs) were determined to quantify oxidative stress. Eighteen infants (birth weight 989 +/- 241 g, gestational age of 27/7 +/- 1/7 weeks) were studied either on postnatal day 1 or 2 (7 or 31 h postnatally, respectively). Concentration of GSH increased with postnatal age (1.45 +/- 0.48 mM versus 1.99 +/- 0.40 mM, p = 0.019). FSRGSH was not significantly different, but the absolute synthesis rate of GSH (ASRGSH) tended to be higher in the infants studied on day 2 [8.1 +/- 2.7 mg/(kg . d) versus 10.6 +/- 2.4 mg/(kg . d), p = 0.054]. AOPP concentrations were not different between groups. In conclusion, GSH concentration in VLBW infants increases significantly after birth. A concomitant increased synthesis rate was not found, suggesting that GSH consumption decreases upon AA administration.",M1
20049071,"Amino acids - Guidelines on Parenteral Nutrition, Chapter 4.Protein catabolism should be reduced and protein synthesis promoted with parenteral nutrion (PN). Amino acid (<e>AA</e>) solutions should always be infused with PN. Standard AA solutions are generally used, whereas specially adapted AA solutions may be required in certain conditions such as severe disorders of AA utilisation or in inborn errors of AA metabolism. An AA intake of 0.8 g/kg/day is generally recommended for adult patients with a normal metabolism, which may be increased to 1.2-1.5 g/kg/day, or to 2.0 or 2.5 g/kg/day in exceptional cases. Sufficient non-nitrogen energy sources should be added in order to assure adequate utilisation of AA. A nitrogen calorie ratio of 1:130 to 1:170 (g N/kcal) or 1:21 to 1:27 (g AA/kcal) is recommended under normal metabolic conditions. In critically ill patients glutamine should be administered parenterally if indicated in the form of peptides, for example 0.3-0.4 g glutamine dipeptide/kg body weight/day (=0.2-0.26 g glutamine/kg body weight/day). No recommendation can be made for glutamine supplementation in PN for patients with acute pancreatitis or after bone marrow transplantation (BMT), and in newborns. The application of arginine is currently not warranted as a supplement in PN in adults. N-acetyl AA are only of limited use as alternative AA sources. There is currently no indication for use of AA solutions with an increased content of glycine, branched-chain AAs (BCAA) and ornithine-alpha-ketoglutarate (OKG) in all patients receiving PN. AA solutions with an increased proportion of BCAA are recommended in the treatment of hepatic encephalopathy (III-IV).",M1
20047764,"Direct binding of TRAF2 and TRAF6 to TICAM-1/TRIF adaptor participates in activation of the Toll-like receptor 3/4 pathway.Using yeast two-hybrid screening, we found three TRAF proteins TRAF1, 2 and 6, bound the N-terminal region of the TLR3/4 adaptor TICAM-1 (TRIF). TRAF2, a newly identified TICAM-1-binding protein, bound the PxQxS motif (<e>aa</e> 333-338) of TICAM-1 using mutagenesis by alanine substitutions. TICAM-1 is known to induce the activation of NF-kappaB and IRF-3, which leads to activation of the interferon (IFN)-beta promoter, an activity that is conserved in the N+TIR fragment (aa 1-533). By mutation of the two distinct binding sites for TRAF2 and TRAF6 in N+TIR TICAM-1, the induction of IFN-beta was completely abrogated. Although the TRAF2 site single mutation only marginally affected TICAM-1-mediated type I IFN induction, it further impaired the function of the TRAF6 site mutant. Moreover, double point mutations of the TRAF2 and TRAF6 binding motifs in TICAM-1 N+TIR reduced the activation of IRF-3 and NF-kappaB, the critical transcription factors for IFN-beta expression. Furthermore, TRAF2/6 functioned as an E3 ligase to induce K63-mediated ubiquitination on N+TIR which was abrogated in the mutant lacking the TRAF2/6 sites in parallel with IFN-inducing activity. Confocal microscopy analysis indicated that TRAF2 and TRAF6 merged with oligomerized (i.e. activated) TICAM-1 N+TIR. However, TRAF3, which is another TRAF family member essential for TLR3-mediated type-I IFN signaling, still assembled in the mutant lacking the TRAF2/6 sites. Our data suggest that the binding of TRAF2 and TRAF6 to TICAM-1 cooperatively activates the IFN-inducing pathway through ubiquitination of TICAM-1, a modification which occurs unrelated to TRAF3 recruitment in the TICAM-1 signaling complex. TRAF2/6 may participate in TICAM-1-mediated IFN-beta induction besides TRAF3.",M1
20042552,"Effect of virginiamycin on the apparent ileal digestibility of amino acids by growing pigs.The objective of this experiment was to measure the influence of virginiamycin on the apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of <e>AA</e> by growing pigs. Fifteen barrows were surgically equipped with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and used in the experiment (initial BW = 35.0 +/- 2.7 kg). Animals were randomly allotted to 3 dietary treatments with 5 pigs per treatment during a 6-wk experiment. Dietary treatments included 1) a basal corn-soybean meal diet, 2) the basal diet supplemented with 11 mg/kg of virginiamycin, and 3) the basal diet supplemented with 22 mg/kg of virginiamycin. Pigs were fed their respective treatment diets during wk 2, 3, and 4, but during wk 1, 5, and 6, all pigs were fed the basal diet. Ileal samples were collected on d 6 and 7 of each week. Results showed that the AID of all indispensable AA, except Arg, His, and Ile, increased (P &lt; 0.05) during wk 2, 3, and 4 compared with wk 1 in pigs fed the diet containing 11 mg/kg of virginiamycin. Pigs fed 22 mg/kg of virginiamycin during wk 2, 3, and 4 had increased (P &lt; 0.05) AID of Trp and Val during these weeks compared with the AID in wk 1. However, the increased AID of AA did not carry over to wk 5 and 6, when virginiamycin was withdrawn from the diet, regardless of the inclusion rate. In pooled data from wk 2, 3, and 4, the AID of CP, the mean of all indispensable AA, and Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Trp, and Val increased (linear, P &lt; 0.05) as virginiamycin was added to the diets, whereas a tendency (P &lt; 0.10) for a linear or quadratic increase was observed for His, Lys, and Thr. These results indicate that addition of virginiamycin to corn-soybean meal diets fed to growing pigs increases the AID of AA, but this effect is not maintained after the removal of virginiamycin from the diet.",M1
20023135,"Effects of distillers dried grains with solubles on amino acid, energy, and fiber digestibility and on hindgut fermentation of dietary fiber in a corn-soybean meal diet fed to growing pigs.The objective of this experiment was to measure the effect of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) on the digestibility of <e>AA</e>, energy, and fiber, on the fermentation of fiber, and on the first appearance of digesta at the end of the ileum, in the cecum, and in the feces of growing pigs fed a corn-soybean meal-based diet. Sixteen pigs (initial BW = 38.0 +/- 1.6 kg) were prepared with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and a T-cannula in the cecum and allotted to 2 treatments. In period 1, all pigs were fed a corn-soybean meal diet. In periods 2, 3, and 4, pigs were fed the control diet or a diet containing corn, soybean meal, and 30% DDGS. First appearance of digesta at the end of the ileum, in the cecum, and over the entire intestinal tract was measured at the end of period 4. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of nutrients were measured, and the concentration of VFA was analyzed in ileal, cecal, and fecal samples. The AID of Lys (74.1%) in the DDGS diet was less (P &lt; 0.05) than in the control diet (78.6%), but the AID of most other AA and GE, NDF, and total dietary fiber (TDF) were not different between the 2 diets. The ATTD of GE (81.0%), NDF (57.2%), TDF (55.5%), and DM (81.7%) were less (P &lt; 0.05) in the DDGS diet than in the control diet (86.0, 69.3, 66.0, and 87.2%, respectively). The concentration of VFA in ileal, cecal, and fecal samples was not different between pigs fed the 2 diets. The pH of ileal and cecal digesta from pigs fed the DDGS diet (6.3 and 5.5) was greater (P &lt; 0.01) than from pigs fed the control diet (5.8 and 5.3). The ATTD of DM, GE, ADF, NDF, and TDF did not change with collection period, but the AID of ADF, NDF, and TDF increased (P &lt; 0.05) from period 2 to period 4. The concentration of all VFA, except isobutyrate, was greater (P &lt; 0.05) in cecal samples from period 4 compared with period 2, and the concentration of all VFA except propionate and isovalerate were greater (P &lt; 0.05) in fecal samples collected in period 4 compared with those collected in period 2. The first appearance of digesta at the end of the ileum, in the cecum, and in the feces was not affected by DDGS. In conclusion, pigs fed the diet containing DDGS had less digestibility of Lys, GE, ADF, NDF, and TDF than pigs fed the control diet. The digestibility of DM and GE was not influenced by collection period, but the concentration of VFA in cecal digesta and feces increased with the length of time pigs received the diets.",M1
20023126,"Energy and amino acid utilization in expeller-extracted canola meal fed to growing pigs.Two experiments were conducted to determine the nutritive value of expeller-extracted canola meal (EECM) for growing pigs. In Exp. 1, a total of 6 ileally cannulated barrows (average initial BW = 26.8 kg) were fed 3 diets in a replicated 3 x 3 Latin square design to determine the apparent and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) values of N and <e>AA</e> and the SID AA contents of EECM. The 3 diets were a cornstarch-based diet with either solvent-extracted canola meal (SECM) or EECM as the sole source of protein, and a low-casein cornstarch-based diet, which was used to estimate basal endogenous N and AA losses to determine the SID of N and AA. All 3 diets contained chromic oxide as an indigestible marker for determining nutrient digestibility by the indicator method. In Exp. 2, a total of 18 intact barrows (average initial BW = 25.9 kg) were fed 3 diets in a completely randomized design (6 pigs per diet) to determine apparent total tract digestibility and retention of nutrients and the DE and ME contents of EECM. The diets were a basal corn-based diet or the basal diet with corn replaced by 35% SECM or EECM. The basal diet was used for determining the total tract digestible nutrient content by the difference method. Solvent-extracted canola meal, which is commonly used in the formulation of swine diets, was fed in both experiments for comparison with EECM. The SECM and EECM were similar in CP content (41.8 vs. 41.4%). Expeller-extracted canola meal was, however, greater in ether extract content (12.03 vs. 5.54%) and decreased in NDF content (23.8 vs. 29.9%) compared with SECM. The EECM also had a greater content of all the AA except Met, Cys, and Ser, by approximately 6.6%; Cys was greater in SECM, whereas Met and Ser were similar between the 2 meals. The EECM had greater (P &lt; 0.05) SID of N, Arg, Ile, Leu, Phe, Glu, and Pro. The SID contents of Arg, His, Ile, Leu, Phe, Val, Ala, Asp, Glu, Gly, Pro, and Tyr were also greater (P &lt; 0.05) for EECM than for SECM by an average of 15%. The EECM had greater (P &lt; 0.01) DE (4,107 vs. 3,790 kcal/kg) and ME (3,978 vs. 3,564 kcal/kg) values compared with SECM. The results show that the EECM used in the current study had greater digestible AA and energy and a greater ME content than the SECM; hence, it may be a better source of protein and energy for growing pigs than SECM.",M1

We have previously shown that intake of antigenic dietary protein is critical for inducing maturation of the immune system as well as for the development of T helper type 1 (Th1) immunity. In this study, we show that administration of an amino acid (<e>aa</e>)-based diet during the development of the immune system subsequently resulted in inefficient control of Leishmania major infection in adult C57BL/6 mice. Compared with mice fed a control protein-containing diet, adult aa-fed mice showed a decreased interferon (IFN)-gamma response to parasite antigens and insufficient production of nitric oxide (NO), which is crucial to parasite death. However, no deviation towards Th2-specific immunity to L. major was observed. Phenotypic analysis of antigen-presenting cells (APCs) from aa-fed mice revealed deficient levels of the costimulatory molecules CD40 and CD80, and low levels of interleukin (IL)-12 produced by peritoneal macrophages, revealing an early stage of maturation of these cells. APCs isolated from aa-fed mice were unable to stimulate a Th1 response in vitro. Both phenotypic features of T cells from aa-fed mice and their ability to produce a Th1 response in the presence of mature APCs were unaffected when compared with T cells from control mice. The results presented here support the notion that regulation of Th1 immunity to infection includes environmental factors such as dietary proteins, which provide a natural source of stimulation that contributes to the process of maturation of APCs.",M1
19966174,"Net flux of amino acids across the portal-drained viscera and liver of the ewe during abomasal infusion of protein and glucose.The objective of the study was to measure net <e>AA</e> flux rates across the portal-drained viscera (PDV) and liver in the presence and absence of abomasal glucose infusion. Decreasing the fraction of AA metabolized by the mucosal cells may increase the fraction of AA being released into the blood. A potential mechanism to reduce AA catabolism by mucosal cells is to provide an alternative source of energy. We hypothesized that increasing glucose flow to the small intestine would increase net appearance of AA across the PDV. Eighteen mature ewes with sampling catheters were placed on study. The experimental design was a split-plot with a complete randomized design on the whole-plot and a Latin-square subplot with 5 periods and incremental levels of protein infusion. One-half of the ewes received abomasal glucose infusions (3.84 g/h), and all ewes received each of 5 protein abomasal infusion levels over 5 periods (0, 2.6, 5.2, 7.8, and 10.5 g/h). Net PDV release of isoleucine, leucine, methionine, phenylalanine, aspartate, glutamate, glutamine, proline, serine, and tyrosine increased linearly with increased protein infusion, and net PDV release of histidine, lysine, threonine, valine, alanine, and glycine did not differ with protein infusion. Net hepatic glucose release decreased with glucose infusion. With the exception of histidine, phenylalanine, and valine, net hepatic AA uptake increased linearly with increased delivery of AA to the liver. Glucose infusion increased the hepatic lysine and valine uptake and decreased phenylalanine uptake. Based on the observations in the current study, we reject our hypothesis that glucose can spare AA metabolism by PDV tissue. Our findings suggest that hepatic gluconeogenesis can be increased in the presence of increased AA delivery to the liver and that hepatic gluconeogenesis can be decreased with increased absorption of dietary glucose. Our findings support the concept that for most AA, hepatic transport of AA can be described by mass action kinetics; however, the rates of hepatic uptake of specific AA are upregulated directly or indirectly by elevated glucose.",M1
19966165,"Gluconeogenesis differs in developing chick embryos derived from small compared with typical size broiler breeder eggs.We hypothesized that, as the supply of preformed glucose diminishes during development, the embryo would transition to a greater rate of gluconeogenesis (GNG) and that GNG would be greater in embryos from small vs. typical size eggs. Gluconeogenesis by embryos from small (51.1 +/- 3.46 g) and typical size (65 +/- 4.35 g) broiler breeder eggs was measured by dosing [(13)C(6)]glucose (15 mgxegg(-1)) into the chorio-allantoic fluid for 3 consecutive days to achieve isotopic steady-state before blood collection on embryonic day (e) 12, e14, e16, and e18 (4 to 5 eggsxsize(-1)xd(-1)). The (13)C-Mass isotopomer enrichment of blood glucose was determined by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. On e14, e16, and e18, but not on e12, embryos from small eggs weighed less (P &lt; 0.05) than typical size eggs. For both sizes of eggs, blood glucose concentration, glucose entry rate (g.d(-1)), and Cori cycling and glucose (13)C-recycling (% of entry rate) increased (P &lt; 0.05) with development. On e12 and e14, rates of glucose entry and Cori cycle flux were greater (P &lt; 0.05) for embryos from small eggs. When standardized to BW (g.100 g of BW(-1)xd(-1)), glucose entry and Cori and non-Cori cycle fluxes were greater for embryos from small eggs. From e12 through e18, blood concentrations of gluconeogenic <e>AA</e> (threonine, glutamine, arginine, proline, isoleucine, and valine) were 25 to 48% less (P &lt; 0.01) in embryos from small eggs. In conclusion, embryos from small eggs exhibit greater rates of GNG earlier in development compared with typical size eggs and, perhaps as a consequence, their reduced embryonic growth may result from diverting greater supplies of AA toward GNG.",M1

The results indicated that the composition of this complex is Eu (9-AA)(3). The luminescence properties of the complex in different solvents and at different pH values have been investigated. The results show that the complex exhibits more efficient luminescence in THF and ethyl acetate. The interactions of Eu-complex with different N-acetyl amino acids and nucleotides in different solvents have been investigated by fluorescence measurements. Enhancement of the fluorescence intensities has been observed in cyclohexane, acetone, acetonitrile, and tetrahydrofuran whereas the fluorescence intensities of the investigated complex in ethanol, water, and ethyl acetate exhibit relatively low intensity.",M1
19924293,"Three distinct domains contribute to nuclear transport of murine Foxp3.Foxp3, a 47-kDa transcription factor, is necessary for the function of CD4+CD25+ regulatory T cells (Tregs), with an essential role in the control of self-reactive T cells and in preventing autoimmunity. Activation of Tregs by TCR engagement results in upregulation of Foxp3 expression, followed by its rapid nuclear transport and binding to chromatin. Here, we identify three distinct Foxp3 domains that contribute to nuclear transport. The first domain (Domain 1) comprises the C-terminal 12 amino acids. The second domain (Domain 2) is located immediately N-terminal to the forkhead domain (FHD), recently reported to be a binding site for the runt-related transcription factor 1/acute myeloid leukemia 1 (Runx1/AML1). The third domain (Domain 3) is located within the N-terminal first 51 amino acids. Unlike the known nuclear localization signals (NLSs), none of these three regions are rich in basic residues and do not bear any similarity to known monopartite or bipartite NLSs that have one or more clusters of basic amino acids. The basic arginine-lysine-lysine-arginine (RKKR) sequence, located 12-<e>aa</e> from the C-terminal end of Foxp3 was previously reported to be a nuclear localization signal (NLS) for several proteins, including for a GFP-Foxp3 hybrid. Evidence is provided here that in the full-length native Foxp3 RKKR does not function as an NLS. The data reported in this study indicates that Foxp3 achieves nuclear transport by binding to other nuclear factors and co-transporting with them to the nucleus.",M1
19923609,"Intestinal digestibility of amino acids in rumen-undegraded protein estimated using a precision-fed cecectomized rooster bioassay: II. Distillers dried grains with solubles and fish meal.The objectives of this experiment were to measure intestinal digestibility of <e>AA</e> in the rumen-undegraded protein fraction (RUP-AA) of distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) and fish meal (FM) samples and to determine whether these feeds contain a constant protein fraction that is undegradable in the rumen and indigestible in the small intestine, as assumed in the French Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Paris, France) and Scandinavian AAT-PBV (AAT = AA absorbed from small intestine; PBV = protein balance in the rumen) models. Five sources of DDGS and 5 sources of FM were obtained from Feed Analysis Consortium, Inc. (Champaign, IL). To obtain the rumen-undegradable protein fraction, samples were ruminally incubated in situ for 16 h in 4 lactating cows, and the collected rumen-undegraded residues (RUR) were pooled by sample. Subsamples of the intact feeds and RUR were crop-intubated to 4 cecectomized roosters, and total excreta were collected for 48 h. Intact feeds, RUR, and excreta were analyzed for AA. Basal endogenous AA loss estimates were obtained from fasted birds and were used to calculate standardized digestibility of RUP-AA and AA in the intact feeds. Indigestibility coefficients of the intact feeds were calculated as (100 - % standardized AA digestibility), and indigestibility of the RUR was calculated as [(100 - % ruminal degradation of AA) x (100 - % standardized RUP-AA digestibility)/100]. Results indicate that standardized digestibility of feed-AA differs from RUP-AA for DDGS samples but not for FM samples, and that standardized digestibility of individual AA differs within samples. For the DDGS samples, standardized feed-AA and RUP-AA digestibility values were most often lowest for His and Lys and highest for Met and Trp. For FM samples, standardized feed-AA and RUP-AA digestibility values were most often lowest for His and highest for Trp. Results also indicate that DDGS and most FM samples do not contain a constant protein fraction that is both undegradable in the rumen and indigestible in the small intestine. Indigestibility values of RUR were lower than in intact feeds, suggesting that the feed ingredients used in this experiment contain a protein fraction that is indigestible in the intestine but partly degradable in the rumen or digestible in the intestine after rumen incubation, or both.",M1
19920778,"Predicting HLA class I alloantigen immunogenicity from the number and physiochemical properties of amino acid polymorphisms.BACKGROUND: Knowledge of the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) amino acid (<e>AA</e>) sequence combined with crystallographic structural data may enable prediction of the relative immunogenicity of individual donor/recipient HLA mismatches. METHODS: Multiple sera from 32 highly sensitized patients awaiting kidney transplantation were screened using Luminex/single-antigen beads to determine the HLA-specific antibody levels against mismatched HLA class I specificities. A computer program was developed to allow intralocus and interlocus comparison of mismatched HLA-A and -B specificities with corresponding recipient HLA class I type, and to determine the number, position, and physiochemical disparity (hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge) of polymorphic AA. RESULTS: HLA-specific antibody was detected against 1666 (85%) of the 1964 mismatched HLA specificities evaluated, with a close correlation between increasing number of AA polymorphisms and the presence and magnitude of the alloantibody response (P&lt;0.0001). Hydrophobicity and electrostatic charge disparity scores were independent predictors of alloantibody production (adjusted P=0.0009 and P=0.0005, respectively). Mismatched specificities with physiochemical scores within the first decile of the scale led to weak alloantibody responses (median fluorescence intensity 2330), whereas those with scores above the sixth decile led to strong alloantibody production (median fluorescence intensity &gt;10,000). CONCLUSION: Differences in AA number, hydrophobicity, and electrostatic charge between HLA class I specificities enable prediction of donor HLA class I types with low immunogenicity for a given recipient.",M1
19915542,"Natural amino acids do not require their native tRNAs for efficient selection by the ribosome.The involvement of tRNA structural elements beyond the anticodon in aminoacyl-tRNA (<e>aa</e>-tRNA) selection by the ribosome has revealed that substrate recognition is considerably more complex than originally envisioned in the adaptor hypothesis. By combining recent breakthroughs in aa-tRNA synthesis and mechanistic and structural studies of protein synthesis, we have investigated whether aa-tRNA recognition further extends to the amino acid, which would explain various translation disorders exhibited by misacylated tRNAs. Contrary to expectation, we find that natural amino acids misacylated onto natural but non-native tRNAs are selected with efficiencies very similar to those of their correctly acylated counterparts. Despite this, small but reproducible differences in selection indeed demonstrate that the translational machinery is sensitive to the amino acid-tRNA pairing. These results suggest either that the ribosome is an exquisite sensor of natural versus unnatural amino acid-tRNA pairings and/or that aa-tRNA selection is not the primary step governing the amino acid specificity of the ribosome.",M1
19907505,"Efficient aquatic bacterial metabolism of dissolved low-molecular-weight compounds from terrestrial sources.Carboxylic acids (CAs), amino acids (<e>AAs</e>) and carbohydrates (CHs) in dissolved free forms can be readily assimilated by aquatic bacteria and metabolized at high growth efficiencies. Previous studies have shown that these low-molecular-weight (LMW) substrates are released by phytoplankton but also that unidentified LMW compounds of terrestrial origin is a subsidy for bacterial metabolism in unproductive freshwater systems. We tested the hypothesis that different terrestrially derived CA, AA and CH compounds can offer substantial support for aquatic bacterial metabolism in fresh waters that are dominated by allochthonous dissolved organic matter (DOM). Drainage water from three catchments of different characters in the Krycklan experimental area in Northern Sweden were studied at the rising and falling limb of the spring flood, using a 2-week bioassay approach. A variety of CA, AA and CH compounds were significantly assimilated by bacteria, meeting 15-100% of the bacterial carbon demand and explaining most of the observed variation in bacterial growth efficiency (BGE; R(2)=0.66). Of the 29 chemical species that was detected, acetate was the most important, representing 45% of the total bacterial consumption of all LMW compounds. We suggest that LMW organic compounds in boreal spring flood drainage could potentially support all in situ bacterial production in receiving lake waters during periods of weeks to months after the spring flood.",M1
19904637,"Studies on the effects of microbial phytase on amino acid digestibility and energy metabolisability in caecectomised laying hens and the interaction with the dietary phosphorus level.1. Caecectomised laying hens were used in two assays to study the effects of a microbial 6-phytase on amino acid (<e>AA</e>) digestibility and energy metabolisability using (1) diets with phytate-rich protein sources and (2) with two dietary phosphorus (P) levels. The two assays followed a 2 x 2-factorial arrangement of treatments using 8 hens per treatment. The hens were housed individually in metabolism cages, and excreta were quantitatively collected for a period of 5 d. 2. In Assay 1, two dietary P levels (8.0 and 4.0 g/kg dry matter) and two levels of phytase supplementation (0 and 1000 U/kg diet) were used in diets that were mainly based on maize, sunflower meal and wheat gluten. The digestibility of AA was 001 to 002 lower in the diet with the low P than with the high P concentration. The effect of P content was significant for 12 out of the 14 AA studied. The supplementation of phytase significantly improved the degradation of myo-inositol(1,2,3,4,5,6)hexakisphosphate (IP6), but affected neither AA digestibility nor energy metabolisability. An interaction between the two factors was not detected. 3. In Assay 2, diets contained one main protein source (sunflower meal or rapeseed meal) at a concentration of 250 g/kg. The diets were either supplemented or not with phytase (1500 U/kg diet). On average, AA digestibility was 0.01 lower in the rapeseed meal-containing diet than in the sunflower meal-containing one. The maximum difference was 0.03. The effect of the protein source was significant for 9 of the 14 AA studied. The supplementation of phytase had no significant effect on AA digestibility or energy metabolisability. 4. Our studies do not substantiate the hypothesis that improved IP6 degradation due to phytase supplementation is associated with improved AA digestibility and energy metabolisability in laying hens. An interaction between phytase efficacy to improve AA digestibility or energy metabolisability and the P level in the diet does not seem to exist.",M1
19903958,"Standardized ileal amino acid digestibility in wheat distillers dried grains with solubles for broilers.A study was conducted to estimate the ileal digestibility of amino acids (<e>AA</e>) in 5 different samples of wheat distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) fed to broilers. Two hundred sixteen male Ross broiler chicks were fed a commercial starter diet from d 1 to 15 of age followed by the test diets from d 15 to 21. The 5 test diets consisted of a DDGS sample or wheat as the sole source of AA, dextrose, minerals, and vitamins. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was included in all diets as a digestibility marker. Each test diet was randomly assigned to 6 replicate cages, each with 6 birds. On d 21, birds were killed to sample ileal digesta for determining the apparent (AID) and standardized (SID) ileal AA digestibilities. The SID values were calculated using ileal endogenous AA losses previously determined in our laboratory. Among the indispensable AA in wheat DDGS, the lowest and highest AID average values were observed for Lys (35.6%) and Phe (79.2%), respectively. The most variable AID estimates of wheat DDGS samples were observed for Lys (24.4 to 45.7%), Thr (48.2 to 60.9%), and His (57.4 to 69.1%) as indispensable and Asp (32.5 to 50.9%), Gly (49.6 to 63.1%), and Ala (53.6 to 66.8%) as dispensable AA, respectively. Apparent ileal digestibility estimates of the wheat sample for Lys, Thr, His, Gly, and Ala were 77.5, 74, 83.6, 79.3, and 78.9%, respectively. All AA digestibility estimates for both AID and SID determined in wheat were higher than in wheat DDGS samples (P &lt; 0.05). Considering both AID and SID coefficients of wheat DDGS samples, Lys was the least digestible AA, averaging 35.6 and 40.0%, respectively. Using SID values in practical diet formulation can increase accuracy, prevent overformulation of diets, and reduce cost of safety margins.",M1
19903658,"Bioactive rather than total IGF-I is involved in acute responses to nutritional interventions in CAPD patients.BACKGROUND: Inadequate food intake plays an important role in the development of malnutrition in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Aim of the study. The aim of the study was to investigate in CAPD patients whether circulating insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) bioactivity may offer a more sensitive index to acute nutritional interventions than total IGF-I. METHODS: An open-label, randomized, crossover study of 2 days-with a 1-week interval-was performed in 12 CAPD patients in the fed state to compare a mixture of amino acids (Nutrineal 1.1%) plus glucose (<e>AA</e> plus G) (Physioneal 1.36% to 3.86%) dialysate versus G only as control dialysate. Fed-state conditions were created by identical liquid hourly meals. IGF-I bioactivity was measured by the kinase receptor activation assay (IGF-I KIRA); total IGF-I was measured by immunoassay. RESULTS: In the fed state, both after AA plus G as well as after G dialysis IGF-I bioactivity increased compared to baseline, while no changes in circulating total IGF-I levels were observed in both treatment arms. However, the increase in IGF-I bioactivity was only significant after AA plus G dialysis (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide evidence that in CAPD patients changes in circulating IGF-I bioactivity are associated with nutrient intake and that IGF-I bioactivity rather than total IGF-I is involved in acute responses to nutritional interventions in CAPD patients.",M1
19854984,"Effects of ruminal protein degradability and frequency of supplementation on nitrogen retention, apparent digestibility, and nutrient flux across visceral tissues in lambs fed low-quality forage.Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of ruminal protein degradability and supplementation frequency on intake, apparent digestibility, N retention, and nutrient flux across visceral tissues of lambs fed a low-quality forage diet. In both experiments, wethers were fed a basal diet of mature crested wheatgrass hay (4.2% CP) for ad libitum consumption plus 1 of 4 supplements: 1) a high RDP supplement provided daily (RDP-D), 2) the high RDP supplement provided on alternate days (RDP-A), 3) a high RUP provided on alternate days (RUP-A), or 4) a 50:50 mixture of the RDP and RUP supplements provided on alternate days. In Exp. 1, 12 lambs (29.9 +/- 2.7 kg initial BW) were used. Forage OM, NDF, and ADF intake were not affected by treatment. Total tract digestibilities (OM, NDF, ADF, and N) were unaffected (P &gt;or= 0.15) by treatment. Neither protein degradability nor supplementation frequency had an effect (P &gt;or= 0.52) on N retention. In Exp. 2, 15 lambs (34 +/- 4 kg initial BW) fitted with indwelling catheters in a hepatic vein, the hepatic portal vein, a mesenteric vein, and a mesenteric artery were used. Release of ammonia N by the portal-drained viscera (PDV) was reduced (P = 0.004) in alternate-day-supplemented lambs compared with RDP-D. Consequently, hepatic uptake of ammonia N was least (P = 0.003) in all alternate-day lambs. Alpha-amino nitrogen (AAN) release by the PDV and hepatic uptake of AAN were not affected by treatment or supplementation frequency. Additionally, hepatic output and PDV uptake of urea N were not affected by treatment. Hepatic N uptake (ammonia N + AAN) accounted for urea synthesized by the liver in all treatments; however, hepatic urea synthesis was approximately 4.5-fold less for RUP-A lambs. This suggests that the provision of <e>AA</e> as RUP may provide a delay in ureagenesis, thus altering the timing of N recycling.",M1
19846668,"Calcium and phosphate compatibility in low-osmolarity parenteral nutrition admixtures intended for peripheral vein administration.BACKGROUND: Precipitation of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) salts can lead to potentially lethal outcomes, especially in low-osmolarity parenteral nutrition (LO-PN) formulations. Three concentrations of amino acids (<e>AA</e>) and 2 concentrations of calcium gluconate and sodium phosphate injections on the compatibility of Ca and P in LO-PN admixtures were studied. METHODS: Final AA concentrations of 1%, 2%, or 3% (n = 3) and 5% glucose (G) were prepared with either 2.5 or 5 mmol/L (5 or 10 mEq) of Ca (n = 2) and 15 or 30 mmol/L of P (n = 2) for a total of 12 base (3 x 2 x 2) formulations. Triplicate bags of each were analyzed for subvisible micro-precipitates using the light obscuration (or extinction) method for particle counts per milliliter (PC) in the size range of 1.8-50 mum at 7 time intervals over 48 hours stored at 30 degrees C +/- 0.2 degrees C. Visual evaluation was performed using a high-intensity lamp against a black background for detection of macro-precipitates. The pH of all 36 admixtures was measured at 0 and 48 hours. Any precipitated material was isolated and characterized by polarized light microscopy and infrared spectroscopy. RESULTS: Of the 12 base LO-PN formulations tested, those containing 1% and 2% AA with 5 mmol/L of Ca and 30 mmol/L of P showed significant increases in PC, and some resulted in visible dibasic calcium phosphate precipitation. Analyses of variance based on concentrations of AA, Ca, P, and time were highly significant independent variables for increases in the PC of potentially embolic particles, that is, sizes &gt;5 mum (P &lt; .0001). The lowest concentrations of Ca and P, 2.5 and 15 mmol/L, respectively, had significantly lower PC (P &lt; .05) for all sizes compared with the other Ca and P combinations. CONCLUSIONS: LO-PN admixtures (AA &lt;/= 3%; G = 5%) should not contain more than 2.5 mmol/L of Ca from calcium gluconate injection and no more than 15 mmol/L of P from potassium or sodium phosphates injection.",M1
19841222,"Effects of feeding grass or red clover silage cut at two maturity stages in dairy cows. 1. Nitrogen metabolism and supply of amino acids.This study investigated the effects of plant species (red clover vs. timothy-meadow fescue) and forage maturity at primary harvest (early vs. late cut silage) on rumen fermentation, nutrient digestion, and nitrogen metabolism including omasal canal <e>AA</e> flow and plasma AA concentration in lactating cows. Five dairy cows equipped with rumen cannulas were used in a study designed as a 5 x 5 Latin square with 21-d periods. The diets consisted of early-cut and late-cut grass and red clover silage, respectively, and a mixture of late-cut grass and early-cut red clover silages given ad libitum with 9 kg/d of a standard concentrate. Grass silage dry matter intake tended to decrease but that of red clover silages tended to increase with advancing maturity. Milk yields were unchanged among treatments, milk protein and fat concentrations being lower for red clover than for grass silage diets. Rumen fluid pH was unchanged but volatile fatty acid and ammonia concentrations were higher for red clover than for grass silage diets. Intake of N, and omasal canal flows of total nonammonia N (NAN), microbial NAN, and dietary NAN were higher for red clover than for grass silage diets but were not affected by forage maturity. However, microbial NAN flow and amount of N excreted in the feces decreased with advancing maturity for grass diets but increased for red clover diets. Apparent ruminal N degradability of the diets was unchanged, but true ruminal N degradability decreased and efficiency of microbial synthesis increased with red clover diets compared with grass silage diets. Omasal canal flows of AA, except those for Met and Cys, were on average 20% higher for red clover than grass silage diets. Omasal canal digesta concentrations of Leu, Phe, branched-chain, and essential AA were higher but those of Met lower for red clover than for grass silage diets. Plasma AA concentrations, except for His (unchanged) and Met (lower), were higher for red clover than for grass diets. However, none of these AA-related variables were affected by forage maturity. Total digestibility of N and excretion of N in the urine were higher for red clover than for grass diets and decreased with advancing maturity. It was concluded that despite the higher total AA supply of cows fed red clover versus grass silage diets, further milk production responses on red clover diets were compromised by an inadequate supply of Met as evidenced by lower Met concentration in the AA profile of omasal digesta and plasma.",M1
19820054,"Effects of ractopamine hydrochloride are not confined to mammalian tissue: evidence for direct effects of ractopamine hydrochloride supplementation on fermentation by ruminal microorganisms.Four experiments were conducted to investigate the effects of ractopamine hydrochloride (RAC) on ruminal fermentation and proteolysis. In Exp. 1, in vitro gas and VFA production was measured in flasks incubated with 0, 0.226, 2.26, 22.6, and 226.0 mg of RAC/L of buffered ruminal fluid. Ractopamine hydrochloride had a quadratic effect on in vitro gas production (P &lt; 0.05; 177, 181, 185, 190, and 170 mL for 0, 0.226, 2.26, 22.6, and 226.0 mg, respectively). Total VFA production was not significantly changed with RAC (P &gt; 0.50). In Exp. 2, IVDMD was measured with tubes incubated with 0, 0.226, 2.26, or 22.6 mg of RAC/L of buffered ruminal fluid with 4 substrate combinations: corn, corn plus soybean meal, corn plus urea, and corn plus soybean meal plus urea. Dry matter disappearance was measured after 2, 4, 6, 8, or 12 h of fermentation. There was an interaction between RAC and substrate (P &lt; 0.01), with more degradable forms of nitrogen eliciting greater IVDMD from RAC. Significant main effects also were detected for RAC, substrate, and hour (P &lt; 0.001). In Exp. 3, <e>AA</e> and ammonia were measured in tubes treated with 0 or 2.26 mg of RAC/L of buffered ruminal fluid. Tubes were incubated for 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210, or 240 min. There were decreases in ammonia and AA concentrations with RAC (P &lt; 0.001). Experiment 4 used 16 ruminally fistulated Holstein steers in a 2 x 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments. Factors consisted of grain processing method (steam-flaked or dry-rolled corn), concentration of dried distillers grains (DG) with solubles (0 or 25% DG, DM basis), and concentration of RAC (0 or 200 mg/d). Ruminal ammonia concentrations were less when RAC was fed in combination with dry-rolled corn, but not when RAC was fed in conjunction with steam-flaked corn (grain processing x RAC, P &lt; 0.01). Addition of RAC, steam-flaked corn, and DG all resulted in reduced ruminal ammonia concentrations (P &lt; 0.01). Amino acid concentrations were decreased when RAC was added to diets with DG but were unchanged in diets without added DG (DG x RAC, P &lt; 0.05). Changes in ruminal ammonia and AA concentrations with RAC supplementation are dependent on grain processing and the addition of DG to finishing diets. Results from these studies suggest that RAC affects fermentation by ruminal microflora. Effects of the interactions between RAC and protein source, grain processing, and DG on proteolysis could have important implications when formulating diets for cattle supplemented with RAC.",M1
19820050,"Metabolic acidosis in sheep alters expression of renal and skeletal muscle amino acid enzymes and transporters.To determine the effect of metabolic acidosis on expression of L-Gln, L-Glu, and L-Asp metabolizing enzymes and transporters, the relative content of mRNA, protein, or mRNA and protein, of 6 enzymes and 5 transporters was determined by real-time reverse transcription-PCR and immunoblot analyses in homogenates of kidney, skeletal muscle, and liver of growing lambs fed a common diet supplemented with canola meal (control; n = 5) or HCl-treated canola meal (acidosis; n = 5). Acidotic sheep had a 790% greater (P = 0.050) expression of renal Na(+)-coupled neutral <e>AA</e> transporter 3 mRNA and a decreased expression of renal glutamine synthetase mRNA (47% reduction, P = 0.037) and protein (57% reduction, P = 0.015) than control sheep. No change in renal cytosolic phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (protein and mRNA), glutaminase (mRNA), or L-Glu dehydrogenase (protein) was found. In skeletal muscle, acidotic sheep had 101% more (P = 0.026) aspartate transaminase protein than did control sheep, whereas no change in the content of 3 Na(+)-coupled neutral AA transporters (mRNA) or 2 high-affinity L-Glu transporter proteins was found. In liver, no change in the content of any assessed enzyme or transporter was found. Collectively, these findings suggest that tissue-level responses of sheep to metabolic acidosis are different than for nonruminants. More specifically, these results indicate the potential capacity for metabolism of L-Asp and L-Glu by skeletal muscle, and L-Gln absorption by kidneys, but no change in hepatic expression of L-Gln metabolism, elaborates previous metabolic studies by revealing molecular-level responses to metabolic acidosis in sheep. The reader is cautioned that the metabolic acidosis model employed in this study differs from the increased plasma lactate-induced metabolic acidosis commonly observed in ruminants fed a highly fermentable grain diet.",M1
19820045,"Characterization of the nutritional value of air-classified protein and starch fractions of field pea and zero-tannin faba bean in grower pigs.Most pulse (nonoilseed legume) seed flours can be fractionated rapidly and economically by air classification into protein and starch concentrates. The nutritional value of air-classified field pea and faba bean concentrates requires characterization to assess the feeding opportunity for pigs. Thus, the objectives were to characterize the apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of DM, OM, energy, starch, CP, fat, and ash; apparent ileal digestibility of CP and starch; standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of <e>AA</e>; and the SID AA, DE, and NE content of air-classified zero-tannin faba bean and field pea protein and starch concentrates in grower pigs. Pulse protein and starch concentrates were compared with soy protein concentrate and corn starch, respectively, as corresponding standards. The corn starch diet served as an N-free diet to correct for basal endogenous AA losses. In a Youden square design, 8 ileal-cannulated barrows (24.9 +/- 2.3 kg of BW) were fed 6 diets over 7 periods at 3 times the maintenance DE requirement. Periods encompassed a 5-d diet acclimation, 3-d feces collection, and 3-d ileal digesta collection. The ATTD of GE was 2% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for faba bean than soy and was intermediate for field pea protein (95.6, 93.7, and 94.9%, respectively). The ATTD of GE was 3.6% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for corn and field pea than faba bean starch (96.2, 95.1, and 92.3%, respectively). The DE content of faba bean was 5.0% greater (P &lt; 0.05) than for field pea or soy protein (4.47, 4.23, and 4.26 Mcal/kg, respectively). The DE content of faba bean and field pea was 1.7% greater (P &lt; 0.05) than for corn starch (3.72, 3.77, and 3.68 Mcal/kg, respectively). The NE content was 5% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for faba bean than field pea and soy protein (3.08, 2.94, and 2.92 Mcal/kg, respectively). The NE content for field pea starch was 2.0% greater (P &lt; 0.05) than for corn starch and faba bean starch (2.68, 2.63, and 2.61 Mcal/kg, respectively). Protein concentrates had a 14 and 11% greater (P &lt; 0.05) DE and NE content, respectively, than starch concentrates. The SID of Lys was 6.0% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for faba bean and field pea protein than soy protein (95.5, 92.6, and 88.7%, respectively). The SID of Lys was 6.0% greater (P &lt; 0.05) for faba bean than field pea starch. Nutrient digestibility and digestible nutrient profiles indicated that air-classified fractions of zero-tannin faba bean and field pea constitute concentrated sources of AA and energy for pigs with high nutritional demands.",M1
19762834,"Effects of providing two forms of supplemental methionine to periparturient Holstein dairy cows on feed intake and lactational performance.Eighteen primiparous and 42 multiparous Holstein cows were blocked according to parity and expected calving date and assigned randomly to 1 of 3 dietary treatments: 1) a basal diet (negative control), 2) the basal diet plus 2-hydroxy-4-methylthio butanoic acid isopropyl ester (MetaSmart, Adisseo Inc., Antony, France), or 3) the basal diet plus rumen-protected Met (Smartamine M, Adisseo Inc., Alpharetta, GA). Treatments were initiated 21 d before expected calving and continued through 140 d postpartum. Diets were similar in ingredient and chemical composition, except for the content of Met in metabolizable protein. MetaSmart [0.35% prepartum and 0.54% postpartum in diet dry matter (DM)] and Smartamine M (0.06% prepartum and 0.10% postpartum in diet DM) were added to the basal diet in amounts needed to achieve a 3.0:1 ratio of Lys to Met in metabolizable protein. Prepartum DM intake (DMI; 13.5 kg/d), body weight (687 kg), body condition score (3.81), postpartum milk yield (42.0 kg/d), milk fat yield (1,549 g/d), milk fat content (3.66%), milk true protein yield (1,192 g/d), and milk urea N content (12.9 mg/dL) were not different among treatments. Postpartum DMI and body condition score were greater and the ratios of milk:DMI and milk N:feed N were less for cows fed the MetaSmart diet than for cows fed the control and Smartamine M diets. Milk protein content was greater for the Smartamine M (2.87%) and MetaSmart (2.81%) treatments than for the control treatment (2.72%). Concentrations of Met and Met + Cys in total plasma <e>AA</e> were different among treatments, with values for the Smartamine M treatment being the highest, followed by the MetaSmart and control treatments. The results indicated that both MetaSmart and Smartamine M are effective in providing metabolizable Met, but clarification of their relative contributions to metabolizable Met is still needed.",M1
19749018,"Effects of dietary protein level and amino acid supplementation on performance of mixed-parity lactating sows in a tropical humid climate.Eighty-six mixed-parity Large White sows were used to determine the effect of diets with reduced CP content or supplemented with essential <e>AA</e> on 28-d lactation performance under humid tropical climatic conditions. This experiment was conducted in Guadeloupe (West French Indies, latitude 16 degrees N, longitude 61 degrees W) between February 2007 and January 2008. Two seasons were distinguished a posteriori from climatic measurement variables continuously recorded in the farrowing room. The average minimum and maximum ambient temperatures and average daily relative humidity for the warm season were 20.5 and 28.2 degrees C, and 93.8%, respectively. The corresponding values for the hot season were 22.7 and 29.4 degrees C, and 93.7%, respectively. The dietary experimental treatments were a normal protein diet (NP), a low protein diet (LP), and a NP diet (NP+) supplemented with essential AA. The NP and LP diets supplied the same levels of standardized digestible Lys (i.e., 0.80 g/MJ of NE), and the NP+ diet supplied 0.95 g/MJ of NE. No interaction between season and diet composition was noted on any response variable evaluated. The ADFI was decreased (P &lt; 0.05) in the hot season (i.e., 3.69 vs. 4.72 kg) and therefore decreased by 500 g per degrees C increase of ambient temperature under high relative humidity conditions. The ADFI tended to be greater with the LP and NP+ diets when compared with the NP treatment (i.e., +10%, P = 0.08). Litter BW gain and mean BW of piglets at weaning were greater (P &lt; 0.05) during the warm season than during the hot season (2.3 vs. 1.8 kg/d and 7.5 vs. 7.1 kg, respectively). Milk production and composition were not affected by dietary treatments but were affected by season (8.1 vs. 6.8 kg/d, for warm and hot seasons, respectively; P &lt; 0.01). The sows fed LP and NP+ diets tended to have decreased backfat thickness losses (3.3 and 3.8 mm, respectively; P &gt; 0.08). In conclusion, the hot season in humid tropical climates, which combines high levels of temperature and humidity, has a pronounced negative impact on performance of lactating sows. Diets with low CP content or supplemented with essential AA can attenuate the effects of hot and humid season by increasing ADFI in lactating sows.",M1
19739658,"Investigations on the effect of amino acids on acrylamide, pyrazines, and Michael addition products in model systems.Acrylamide and pyrazine formation, as influenced by the incorporation of different amino acids, was investigated in sealed low-moisture asparagine-glucose model systems. Added amino acids, with the exception of glycine and cysteine and at an equimolar concentration to asparagine, increased the rate of acrylamide formation. The strong correlation between the unsubstituted pyrazine and acrylamide suggests the promotion of the formation of Maillard reaction intermediates, and in particular glyoxal, as the determining mode of action. At increased amino acid concentrations, diverse effects were observed. The initial rates of acrylamide formation remained high for valine, alanine, phenylalanine, tryptophan, glutamine, and leucine, while a significant mitigating effect, as evident from the acrylamide yields after 60 min of heating at 160 degrees C, was observed for proline, tryptophan, glycine, and cysteine. The secondary amine containing amino acids, proline and tryptophan, had the most profound mitigating effect on acrylamide after 60 min of heating. The relative importance of the competing effect of added amino acids for alpha-dicarbonyls and acrylamide-amino acid alkylation reactions is discussed and accompanied by data on the relative formation rates of selected amino acid-<e>AA</e> adducts.",M1
19738034,"mTOR, AMPK, and GCN2 coordinate the adaptation of hepatic energy metabolic pathways in response to protein intake in the rat.Three transduction pathways are involved in amino acid (<e>AA</e>) sensing in liver: mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and general control nondepressible kinase 2 (GCN2). However, no study has investigated the involvement of these signaling pathways in hepatic AA sensing. To address the question of liver AA sensing and signaling in response to a high-protein (HP) dietary supply, we investigated the changes in the phosphorylation state of hepatic mTOR (p-mTOR), AMPKalpha (p-AMPKalpha), and GCN2 (p-GCN2) by Western blotting. In rats fed a HP diet for 14 days, the hepatic p-AMPKalpha and p-GCN2 were lower (P &lt; 0.001), and those of both the p-mTOR and eukaryotic initiation factor 4E-binding protein-1 phosphorylation (p-4E-BP1) were higher (P &lt; 0.01) compared with rats receiving a normal protein (NP) diet. In hepatocytes in primary culture, high AA concentration decreased AMPKalpha phosphorylation whether insulin was present or not (P &lt; 0.01). Either AAs or insulin can stimulate p-mTOR, but this is not sufficient for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation that requires both (P &lt; 0.01). As expected, branched-chain AAs (BCAA) or leucine stimulated the phosphorylation of mTOR, but both insulin and BCAA or leucine are required for 4E-BP1 phosphorylation. GCN2 phosphorylation was reduced by both AAs and insulin(P &lt; 0.01), suggesting for the first time that the translation inhibitor GCN2 senses not only the AA deficiency but also the AA increase in the liver. The present findings demonstrate that AAs and insulin exert a coordinated action on translation and involved mTOR, AMPK, and GCN2 transduction pathways.",M1
19734688,"Purification, characterization, molecular cloning, and expression of a new aminoacylase from Streptomyces mobaraensis that can hydrolyze N-(middle/long)-chain-fatty-acyl-L-amino acids as well as N-short-chain-acyl-L-amino acids.We report here on the purification, characterization, molecular cloning, and expression of a new aminoacylase, initially isolated from the supernatant of Streptomyces mobaraensis (Sm-<e>AA</e>). Purified wild-type Sm-AA was found to be a monomeric protein with a molecular mass of 55 kDa. The cloned gene of Sm-AA contained an ORF of 1,383 bp, encoding a polypeptide of 460 amino acids. A BLAST search revealed that Sm-AA belongs to the peptidase M20 family, with identities to a hypothetical protein from Streptomyces pristinaespiralis, a putative peptidase from Streptomyces avermitilis, peptidase M20 from Frankia sp., succinyl-diaminopimelate desuccinylase from Hemophilus influenzae, and aminoacylase-1 from porcine kidney at 89, 88, 67, 29, and 25% respectively. The Sm-AA gene was subcloned into an expression vector, pSH19, and was expressed in Streptomyces lividans TK24. The amount of the recombinant Sm-AA expressed in the S. lividans cells was approximately 42-fold higher than that of Sm-AA found in the supernatant of S. mobaraensis. Sm-AA showed high hydrolytic activity towards various N-acetyl-L-amino acids and N-(middle/long)-chain-fatty-acyl-L-amino acids, with a preference for the acyl derivatives of L-Met, L-Ala, L-Cys, etc. with an optimum pH and temperature for reaction of about 7.5 and 50 degrees Celsius (at pH 7.5).",M1
19729231,"A class of novel N-(3S-1,2,3,4-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carbonyl)-L-amino acid derivatives: their synthesis, anti-thrombotic activity evaluation, and 3D QSAR analysis.To find new anti-thrombotic agents, a natural amino acid was introduced into the 3-position of anti-platelet aggregation active 3S-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxylic acid (THIQA), and 20 novel dipeptide derivatives, 3S-tetrahydroisoquinoline-3-carboxyamino acids (6a-t), targeting the intestinal peptide transport system were provided. In vitro anti-platelet aggregation assay of 6a-t indicated that their potencies of inhibiting adenosine diphosphate (ADP), arachidonic acid (<e>AA</e>), platelet-activating factor (PAF), and thrombin (TH) induced platelet aggregations were higher than that of THIQA, and the in vivo anti-thrombotic assay of 6a-t indicated that their potencies of inhibiting thrombogenesis in rats were also higher than that of THIQA.

19717784,"Amino acid digestibility and energy concentration in a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains and their effects on growth performance of pigs.Three experiments were conducted to evaluate a novel source of high-protein distillers dried grains produced by Buhler Inc. (HP-DDG(Buhler)) and fed to growing pigs. The standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of <e>AA</e> in HP-DDG(Buhler) and in soybean meal (SBM) was determined in Exp. 1. Nine pigs (109.8 +/- 2.78 kg of BW) were fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a triplicated 3 x 3 Latin square design with 3 diets and 3 periods per square. Diets containing HP-DDG(Buhler) or SBM as the only source of AA and an N-free diet were formulated. The SID of indispensable AA was less (P &lt; 0.01) in HP-DDG(Buhler) than in SBM (Arg, 87.5 vs. 93.9%; His, 76.7 vs. 88.7%; Ile, 76.4 vs. 87.5%; Leu, 77.8 vs. 86.8%; Lys, 75.4 vs. 88.4%; Met, 82.8 vs. 88.4%; Phe, 77.9 vs. 87.3%; Thr, 72.5 vs. 83.5%; Trp, 85.1 vs. 91.0%; Val, 73.3 vs. 84.3%). The DE and ME in HP-DDG(Buhler) and in corn were measured in Exp. 2 using 16 growing barrows (24.6 +/- 1.66 kg of BW). A corn-based diet and a diet containing 50% corn and 48.2% HP-DDG(Buhler) were formulated. The total collection method and the difference procedures were used. The concentrations of DE and ME in HP-DDG(Buhler) were greater (P &lt; 0.001) than in corn (5,043 vs. 4,002 kcal/kg of DM and 4,690 vs. 3,921 kcal/kg of DM, respectively). Experiment 3 was a 9-wk growth assay using 40 pigs (initial BW: 58.2 +/- 2.28 kg) allotted to 5 dietary treatments, with 8 replicates of individually housed pigs per treatment. Treatments included a control diet based on corn and SBM and 4 diets in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 33, 66, 66, or 100% of the SBM in the control diet. All HP-DDG(Buhler) diets contained supplemental Lys and Thr to provide similar concentrations of SID Lys and Thr in all diets; one of the diets in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 66% of the SBM and the diet in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 100% of the SBM also contained crystalline Trp. Dietary treatments had no effect on ADG (1.15, 1.13, 1.16, 1.12, and 1.14 kg), ADFI (3.33, 3.35, 3.39, 3.30, and 3.33 kg), or G:F (0.35, 0.34, 0.34, 0.34, and 0.34 kg/kg). Carcass traits of pigs fed the diet in which HP-DDG(Buhler) replaced 100% of the SBM were not different from those of pigs fed the control diet. In conclusion, HP-DDG(Buhler) contains more DE and ME than corn, but has decreased SID values for AA compared with SBM. Soybean meal can be replaced by HP-DDG(Buhler) in diets fed to finishing pigs without any effect on growth performance or carcass characteristics, provided that diets are adequate in indispensable AA.",M1
19717769,"The standardized ileal digestible isoleucine-to-lysine requirement ratio may be less than fifty percent in eleven- to twenty-three-kilogram piglets.Most studies concerning the Ile requirement in pigs have been carried out using blood products as a protein source, and these have a relatively low Ile content relative to the other branched-chain <e>AA</e> (BCAA). There are indications that an excess supply of one BCAA can affect the utilization of the other BCAA. Little information is available concerning the Ile requirement in pigs when the supply of the other BCAA is moderate (e.g., in cereal- and soybean meal-based diets). The objective of the present study was to evaluate the response of piglets to Ile supplementation under different nutritional conditions. In all experiments, piglets were housed individually and had ad libitum access to feed during a 3-wk period. The first experiment was carried out to study the response of piglets to an increasing Ile supply by using 2 sources of l-Ile differing in degree of purity. Piglets received either a control diet with 48% standardized ileal digestible (SID) Ile:Lys or 1 of 4 other diets containing graded levels of either source of l-Ile to provide 52 or 56% SID Ile:Lys. All diets were formulated to provide 1.00% SID Lys in the diet. Feed intake and growth were not affected by Ile level or Ile source. Experiment 2 was performed to exclude a possible interaction between Ile and Lys supply. In a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement, 2 levels of Lys (1.00 and 1.15% SID Lys) and 2 levels of Ile (48 and 60% SID Ile:Lys) were used. Growth and G:F were 8 and 7% greater in piglets receiving the diet with the greater Lys content, but the Ile:Lys did not affect performance. No interactions were observed between the Lys and Ile supplies. In Exp. 3, a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement was used to test the effect of protein source (spray-dried blood cells or corn gluten meal) and Ile supply (50 or 65% SID Ile:Lys) on performance in piglets. Both protein sources had an elevated BCAA content but differed in Leu and Val contents. Protein source or Ile supply did not affect feed intake, growth, or G:F in the piglets. Plasma concentrations after an overnight fast reflected the difference in AA concentrations of the diets. In conclusion, the results of these experiments indicate that the SID Ile:Lys requirement may be not greater than 50% in piglets receiving cereal- and soybean meal-based diets with a moderate BCAA content. In contrast to other studies, we could not confirm that the Ile requirement was affected by BCAA content of the diet.",M1
19706206,"Ileal digestibility of dietary protein in the growing pig and adult human.The suitability of the pig as an animal model for predicting protein digestibility in man was evaluated. Healthy adult human subjects (mean body weight 67 kg; n 11) and growing pigs (mean body weight 40 kg; n 15) were fed semi-synthetic mixed meals containing, as a sole source of N, casein (C), hydrolysed casein (HC) or rapeseed isolate (R). There was no prior adaptation to the test meal. Ileal digesta were sampled through a naso-ileal tube (human subjects) or a post-valve T-caecum cannula (pigs) after ingestion of a bolus meal. The protein sources were 15N-labelled. Amino acid (<e>AA</e>) digestibilities were not determined for R. Ileal apparent N digestibility was markedly lower (14-16 %; P &lt; 0.001) in human subjects than in pigs (C, HC, R). Similarly, most apparent ileal AA digestibilities were lower (8 % on average; P &lt; 0.05) in human subjects (C, HC). Ileal true N digestibility was slightly lower (3-5 %; P &lt; 0.001) in human subjects than in pigs (C, HC, R) and most true ileal AA digestibilities were similar (P&gt;0.05) between the species (C, HC). Exceptions were for phenylalanine, tyrosine, lysine, histidine and aspartic acid for which digestibilities were lower (3 % on average; P &lt; 0.001) in human subjects. A similar ranking of the diets was observed for true ileal N digestibility between species. The inter-species correlation for true ileal digestibility was high for N (r 0.98 over 3 x 2 data; P = 0.11) and AA (r 0.87 over 26 x 2 data; P &lt; 0.0001). Overall, this supports the use of the pig as a model for predicting differences among dietary protein digestibility, especially regarding true ileal N digestibility, in man.",M1
19700710,"Intestinal digestibility of amino acids in rumen undegradable protein estimated using a precision-fed cecectomized rooster bioassay: I. Soybean meal and SoyPlus.The objectives of this experiment were to measure intestinal digestibility of <e>AA</e> in rumen undegradable protein (RUP-AA) in soybean meal (SBM) and expeller SBM (SoyPlus, West Central, Ralston, IA; SP) and to determine if these feeds contain a constant protein fraction that is undegradable in the rumen and indigestible in the small intestine, as assumed in the French Institut National de la Recherche Agronomique (Paris, France) and Scandinavian AAT-PBV (AAT = AA absorbed from small intestine; PBV = protein balance in the rumen) models. Three samples of SBM and 3 samples of SP were obtained from the Feed Analysis Consortium Inc. (Savoy, IL). To obtain the RUP fraction, samples were ruminally incubated in situ for 16 h in 4 lactating cows, and the collected rumen undegraded residues (RUR) were pooled by sample. Subsamples of the intact feeds and RUR were crop intubated to 4 cecectomized roosters, and total excreta were collected for 48 h. Intact feeds, RUR, and excreta were analyzed for AA. Basal endogenous AA loss estimates were obtained from fasted birds and were used to calculate standardized digestibility of AA in the intact feeds and RUP-AA. Indigestibility coefficients of the intact feeds were calculated as (100 - % standardized AA digestibility), and indigestibility of the RUR was calculated as [(100 - % ruminal degradation of AA) x [(100 - % standardized RUP-AA digestibility)]/100]. Results indicated that standardized digestibility of feed-AA was similar to standardized digestibility of RUP-AA for SBM and SP samples and that standardized digestibility of individual AA differed within samples. Standardized feed-AA and RUP-AA digestibility values were lowest for Lys and Cys and highest for Trp and Met. Results also indicated that SBM and SP did not contain a constant protein fraction that was both undegradable in the rumen and indigestible in the small intestine. Indigestibility values of RUR were lower than in intact feeds, suggesting that SBM and SP contain a protein fraction that is indigestible in the intestine but partly degradable in the rumen, digestible in the intestine after ruminal incubation, or both.",M1
19692493,"Hydrolyzed dietary casein as compared with the intact protein reduces postprandial peripheral, but not whole-body, uptake of nitrogen in humans.BACKGROUND: Compared with slow proteins, fast proteins are more completely extracted in the splanchnic bed but contribute less to peripheral protein accretion; however, the independent influence of absorption kinetics and the amino acid (<e>AA</e>) pattern of dietary protein on AA anabolism in individual tissues remains unknown. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to compare the postprandial regional utilization of proteins with similar AA profiles but different absorption kinetics by coupling clinical experiments with compartmental modeling. DESIGN: Experimental data pertaining to the intestine, blood, and urine for dietary nitrogen kinetics after a 15N-labeled intact (IC) or hydrolyzed (HC) casein meal were obtained in parallel groups of healthy adults (n = 21) and were analyzed by using a 13-compartment model to predict the cascade of dietary nitrogen absorption and regional metabolism. RESULTS: IC and HC elicited a similar whole-body postprandial retention of dietary nitrogen, but HC was associated with a faster rate of absorption than was IC, resulting in earlier and stronger hyperaminoacidemia and hyperinsulinemia. An enhancement of both catabolic (26%) and anabolic (37%) utilization of dietary nitrogen occurred in the splanchnic bed at the expense of its further peripheral availability, which reached 18% and 11% of ingested nitrogen 8 h after the IC and HC meals, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: The form of delivery of dietary AAs constituted an independent factor of modulation of their postprandial regional metabolism, with a fast supply favoring the splanchnic dietary nitrogen uptake over its peripheral anabolic use. These results question a possible effect of ingestion of protein hydrolysates on tissue nitrogen metabolism and accretion. This trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov as NCT00873951.",M1

Efficient labeling was achieved by sequential injection of buffer, Dns-Cl, AA enantiomers, Dns-Cl and buffer at 0.2 psi for 10.0, 3.0, 24.0, 3.0, and 10.0 s, respectively. After injection, the sandwich sections were allowed to react at room temperature for 35.0 min.

CLE-CE of some individual and mixed pairs was also demonstrated, much the same as using pre-column labeling. As validated by both artificially prepared solutions and serum samples, this new method was shown to be applicable to the quantitative analysis, with a linear range between 14.0 muM and 3.7 mM, correlation coefficient above 0.99 and recovery in between 90.4% and 111.7%.

Dietary DM, OM, NDF, and N intake, and retained N were less (P &lt; 0.01) for +LPS than -LPS steers. Total N intake, apparent N digestibility, and retained N were greater (P &lt; or = 0.05) for steers fed CP16RDP and CP16RUP vs. CP14.5CON. An LPS x diet interaction (P = 0.05) occurred for N retention (% N intake) because N retention was less for +LPS than -LPS steers when fed CP14.5CON, but not different between +LPS and -LPS steers when fed CP16RDP and CP16RUP. These results demonstrate that LPS infusion alters serum hormones, plasma AA, and N balance in cattle and imply that growing steers exposed to LPS may require greater dietary protein concentrations to account for altered intake and metabolic AA demand.",M1
19643160,"The fourfold way of the genetic code.We describe a compact representation of the genetic code that factorizes the table in quartets. It represents a  least grammar  for the genetic language. It is justified by the Klein-4 group structure of RNA bases and codon doublets. The matrix of the outer product between the column-vector of bases and the corresponding row-vector V(T)=(C G U A), considered as signal vectors, has a block structure consisting of the four cosets of the KxK group of base transformations acting on doublet <e>AA</e>. This matrix, translated into weak/strong (W/S) and purine/pyrimidine (R/Y) nucleotide classes, leads to a code table with mixed and unmixed families in separate regions. A basic difference between them is the non-commuting (R/Y) doublets: AC/CA, GU/UG. We describe the degeneracy in the canonical code and the systematic changes in deviant codes in terms of the divisors of 24, employing modulo multiplication groups. We illustrate binary sub-codes characterizing mutations in the quartets. We introduce a decision-tree to predict the mode of tRNA recognition corresponding to each codon, and compare our result with related findings by Jestin and Soulé [Jestin, J.-L., Soulé, C., 2007. Symmetries by base substitutions in the genetic code predict 2' or 3' aminoacylation of tRNAs. J. Theor. Biol. 247, 391-394], and the rearrangements of the table by Delarue [Delarue, M., 2007.

19625700,"Dietary protein intake and stage of lactation differentially modulate amino acid transporter mRNA abundance in porcine mammary tissue.To test the hypothesis that under restricted and surfeit protein intake the mammary gland undergoes adaptive regulation, changes in mammary tissue mRNA abundance of cationic amino acid (<e>AA</e>) transporter (CAT)-1, CAT-2B, alanine/serine/cysteine/threonine transporter 1 (ASCT1), and broad specificity transporter for neutral and cationic AA (ATB(0,+)), and CAT-1 protein abundance were investigated at 2 stages of lactation. Eighteen sows were allocated to a 2 x 3 randomized incomplete block design with 2 stages of lactation (early and peak) and 3 protein levels: deficient (D), adequate (A), or in excess (E) of lactation requirement. In early lactation, compared with A, sows fed E had lower (P = 0.05) piglet growth rate and sows fed D or E had lower (P &lt; or = 0.05) casein yield. In early lactation, piglet growth rate and milk protein and casein yield increased from D to A and decreased from A to E (quadratic, P = 0.095, P &lt; 0.05, and P &lt; 0.01, respectively). Protein intake did not affect CAT-1, ASCT1, ATB(0,+) mRNA abundance, or CAT-1 protein level. Overall, CAT-2B mRNA abundance decreased linearly with increasing protein intake (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with A, E decreased CAT-2B mRNA abundance (P &lt; 0.05). Compared with early lactation, peak lactation did not increase CAT-1 mRNA abundance or relative CAT-1 protein content, but increased abundance of ASCT1 and ATB(0,+) mRNA (P &lt; 0.01). Mammary CAT-2B appears to be adaptively regulated in vivo at the transcription level, whereas ASCT1 and ATB(0,+) mRNA abundances are associated only with stage of lactation. Neither protein intake nor stage of lactation affects porcine mammary CAT-1 gene expression in vivo.",M1
19625420,"Nonomuraea antimicrobica sp. nov., an endophytic actinomycete isolated from a leaf of Maytenus austroyunnanensis.A novel actinomycete strain, designated YIM 61105(T), was isolated from a leaf of Maytenus austroyunnanensis from the tropical rainforest in Xishuangbanna, Yunnan Province, south-west China. A 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the organism belonged to the phylogenetic cluster of the genus Nonomuraea and was most closely related to Nonomuraea candida HMC10(T) (98.2 %), 'Nonomuraea aegyptia' S136 (97.9 %), Nonomuraea kuesteri GW 14-1925(T) (97.5 %) and Nonomuraea turkmeniaca DSM 43926(T) (97.4 %). The 16S rRNA gene sequence similarities to other Nonomuraea species were less than 97.4 %. The main chemotaxonomic properties of strain YIM 61105(T), such as the principal amino acid of the peptidoglycan, the predominant menaquinone and the polar lipid profile, supported its classification within the genus Nonomuraea. Strain YIM 61105(T) was also readily differentiated from closely related species on the basis of a broad range of phenotypic properties and DNA-DNA hybridization values. Thus, this isolate is considered to represent a novel species of the genus Nonomuraea, for which the name Nonomuraea antimicrobica sp. nov. is proposed.

19622785,"Tertiary active transport of amino acids reconstituted by coexpression of System A and L transporters in Xenopus oocytes.The System L transporter facilitates cellular import of large neutral amino acids (<e>AAs</e>) such as Leu, a potent activator of the intracellular target of rapamycin (TOR) pathway, which signals for cell growth. System L is an AA exchanger, proposed to accumulate certain AAs by coupling to dissipation of concentration gradient(s) of exchange substrates generated by secondary active AA transporters such as System A (SNAT2). We addressed the hypothesis that this type of coupling (termed tertiary active transport) acts as an indirect mechanism to extend the range of AA stimulating TOR to those transported by both Systems A and L (e.g., Gln) through downstream enhancement of Leu accumulation. System A overexpression enabled Xenopus oocytes to accumulate substrate AAs (notably Ser, Gln, Ala, Pro, Met; totaling 2.6 nmol/oocyte) from medium containing a physiological AA mixture at plasma concentrations. Net accumulation of System L (4F2hc-xLAT1) substrates from this medium by System L-overexpressing oocytes was increased by 90% (from 0.7 to 1.35 nmol/oocyte; mainly Leu, Ile) when Systems A and L were coexpressed, coincident with a decline in accumulation of specific System A substrates (Gln, Ser, Met), as expected if the latter were also System L substrates and functional coupling of the transport Systems occurred. AA flux coupling was confirmed as trans-stimulation of Leu influx in System L-expressing oocytes by Gln injection (0.5 nmol/oocyte). The observed changes in Leu accumulation are sufficient to activate the TOR pathway in oocytes, although intracellular AA metabolism limits the potential for AA accumulation by tertiary active transport in this system.",M1
19620677,"In vitro digestibility of individual amino acids in rumen-undegraded protein: the modified three-step procedure and the immobilized digestive enzyme assay.Three soybean meal, 3 SoyPlus (West Central Cooperative, Ralston, IA), 5 distillers dried grains with solubles, and 5 fish meal samples were used to evaluate the modified 3-step in vitro procedure (TSP) and the in vitro immobilized digestive enzyme assay (IDEA; Novus International Inc., St. Louis, MO) for estimating digestibility of <e>AA</e> in rumen-undegraded protein (RUP-AA). In a previous experiment, each sample was ruminally incubated in situ for 16 h, and in vivo digestibility of AA in the intact samples and in the rumen-undegraded residues (RUR) was obtained for all samples using the precision-fed cecectomized rooster assay. For the modified TSP, 5 g of RUR was weighed into polyester bags, which were then heat-sealed and placed into Daisy(II) incubator bottles. Samples were incubated in a pepsin/HCl solution followed by incubation in a pancreatin solution. After this incubation, residues remaining in the bags were analyzed for AA, and digestibility of RUP-AA was calculated based on disappearance from the bags. In vitro RUP-AA digestibility estimates obtained with this procedure were highly correlated to in vivo estimates. Corresponding intact feeds were also analyzed via the pepsin/pancreatin steps of the modified TSP. In vitro estimates of AA digestibility of the feeds were highly correlated to in vivo RUP-AA digestibility, which suggests that the feeds may not need to be ruminally incubated before determining RUP-AA digestibility in vitro. The RUR were also analyzed via the IDEA kits. The IDEA values of the RUR were good predictors of RUP-AA digestibility in soybean meal, SoyPlus, and distillers dried grains with solubles, but the IDEA values were not as good predictors of RUP-AA digestibility in fish meal. However, the IDEA values of intact feed samples were also determined and were highly correlated to in vivo RUP-AA digestibility for all feed types, suggesting that the IDEA value of intact feeds may be a better predictor of RUP-AA digestibility than the IDEA value of the RUR. In conclusion, the modified TSP and IDEA kits are good approaches for estimating RUP-AA digestibility in soybean meal products, distillers dried grains with solubles, and fish meal samples.",M1

Cells were motile by means of peritrichous flagella and formed ellipsoidal endospores lying in subterminal swollen sporangia. Growth occurred with 1-20% (w/v) total salts (optimum, 5-10%) and at pH 6.0-10.5 (optimum, pH 7.5-8.0) and 10-55 degrees C (optimum, 35-40 degrees C). It was unable to grow with NaCl as the only salt. meso-Diaminopimelic acid was present in the cell-wall peptidoglycan. The strain contained menaquinone 7 (MK-7) as the predominant respiratory quinone and diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylethanolamine and an unidentified phospholipid as polar lipids. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C15:0 and anteiso-C17:0. The DNA G+C content was 40.9 mol%.

19603474,"Hair protein and amino acid 13C and 15N abundances take more than 4 weeks to clearly prove influences of animal protein intake in young women with a habitual daily protein consumption of more than 1 g per kg body weight.A high protein or meat intake might be a risk factor for metabolic disorders. Stable isotopic abundances (SIA) of hair can be used as biomarkers for animal protein intake due to characteristic isotopic patterns of food proteins. We investigated if an additional meat intake (M, 200 g pork fillet/day) or an omission of meat and meat products (NOM) can influence the natural (15)N and (13)C SIA within 4 weeks in hair and plasma of young women. The daily protein intake (means +/- SD) was 1.40 +/- 0.29, 2.25 +/- 0.35, and 1.15 +/- 0.26 g/kg at baseline, during M, and during NOM, respectively. At baseline the animal protein intake correlated with bulk SIA of hair ((15)N: R(2) = 0.416; (13)C: R(2) = 0.664; n = 14). However, isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) analyses have not shown that hair and plasma SIA were changed significantly after M or NOM. Possible reasons were discussed. Urinary SIA were significantly lower after M than after NOM ((15)N: p = 0.039; (13)C: p = 0.006) and close to those of pork fillet. Characteristic patterns of SIA were measured in individual amino acids (<e>AA</e>) by gas chromatography/combustion isotope ratio mass spectrometry (GC/C/IRMS). The results confirmed considerable differences in SIA between AA (delta(15)N, up to 22 per thousand; delta(13)C, up to 31 per thousand). Plots of (15)N versus (13)C abundances in hair revealed characteristic differences between indispensable and dispensable AA. The intervention-dependent changes of AA-specific SIA were not as clear as expected. Although the AA-specific SIA may reveal more detailed characteristics of physiological conditions, further methodological research is required. We suggest that the SIA of leucine can be potential markers of protein intake. The reliability of SIA as biomarkers of protein intake still have to be tested in longer lasting intervention studies in humans. The results may have implications in the assessment for possible benefits and risks of protein consumption.",M1
19602603,"Amino Acid-based peritoneal dialysis solutions for malnutrition: new perspectives.Protein and energy malnutrition is frequently found in patients on maintenance dialysis and is associated with an increased risk of death. Among a variety of factors involved in the development of protein and energy malnutrition, such as acidosis, insulin resistance, inflammation, and dialysate protein losses, insufficient intake of proteins and energy as a result of anorexia plays a prominent role. Amino acid (<e>AA</e>)-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions can induce an anabolic response in malnourished patients on continuous ambulatory PD if enough calories are ingested simultaneously. Poor appetite, however, may impede the intake of sufficient calories. Peritoneal dialysis solutions containing a mixture of AAs and glucose in a proper ratio can serve as a source of proteins and calories. Such a dialysis solution can be used in fasting patients on nocturnal automated PD as part of a regular dialysis schedule. Using a sophisticated technique involving stable isotopes, this dialysis mixture has been found to induce acute anabolic changes in whole body protein metabolism. Such a metabolic response is similar to that induced by food. Intraperitoneal AAs, in common with ingested proteins, can induce generation of hydrogen ions and urea through oxidation of specific AAs. Supplying AAs together with calories could bring about utilization of AAs for the synthesis of proteins rather than the oxidation of AAs, thereby limiting production of acid and urea. Using dialysis solutions with a buffer concentration of 40 mmol/L further contributes to maintaining acid-base homeostasis. We advocate consideration of usage of AA/glucose dialysate when PD patients cannot comply with dietary requirements. To evaluate the long-term effects of this approach on morbidity and mortality, clinical trials with large groups of patients are needed.",M1
19602583,"Prolonged maternal amino acid infusion in late-gestation pregnant sheep increases fetal amino acid oxidation.Protein supplementation during human pregnancy does not improve fetal growth and may increase small-for-gestational-age birth rates and mortality. To define possible mechanisms, sheep with twin pregnancies were infused with amino acids (<e>AA</e> group, n = 7) or saline (C group, n = 4) for 4 days during late gestation. In the AA group, fetal plasma leucine, isoleucine, valine, and lysine concentrations were increased (P &lt; 0.05), and threonine was decreased (P &lt; 0.05). In the AA group, fetal arterial pH (7.365 +/- 0.007 day 0 vs. 7.336 +/- 0.012 day 4, P &lt; 0.005), hemoglobin-oxygen saturation (46.2 +/- 2.6 vs. 37.8 +/- 3.6%, P &lt; 0.005), and total oxygen content (3.17 +/- 0.17 vs. 2.49 +/- 0.20 mmol/l, P &lt; 0.0001) were decreased on day 4 compared with day 0. Fetal leucine disposal did not change (9.22 +/- 0.73 vs. 8.09 +/- 0.63 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1), AA vs. C), but the rate of leucine oxidation increased 43% in the AA group (2.63 +/- 0.16 vs. 1.84 +/- 0.24 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1), P &lt; 0.05). Fetal oxygen utilization tended to be increased in the AA group (327 +/- 23 vs. 250 +/- 29 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1), P = 0.06). Rates of leucine incorporation into fetal protein (5.19 +/- 0.97 vs. 5.47 +/- 0.89 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1), AA vs. C), release from protein breakdown (4.20 +/- 0.95 vs. 4.62 +/- 0.74 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1)), and protein accretion (1.00 +/- 0.30 vs. 0.85 +/- 0.25 micromol x min(-1) x kg(-1)) did not change. Consistent with these data, there was no change in the fetal skeletal muscle ubiquitin ligases MaFBx1 or MuRF1 or in the protein synthesis regulators 4E-BP1, eEF2, eIF2alpha, and p70(S6K). Decreased concentrations of certain essential amino acids, increased amino acid oxidation, fetal acidosis, and fetal hypoxia are possible mechanisms to explain fetal toxicity during maternal amino acid supplementation.",M1
19594118,"Oxidation of the natural amino acids by a ferryl complex: kinetic and mechanistic studies with peptide model compounds.Kinetic and mechanistic studies detailing the oxidation of substrates derived from the 20 natural amino acids by the ferryl complex [Fe(IV)(O)(N4Py)](2+) are described. Substrates of the general formula Ac-<e>AA</e>-NHtBu were treated with the ferryl complex under identical conditions ([Ac-AA-NHtBu] = 10 mM, [Fe] = 1 mM, 1:1 H(2)O/CH(3)CN), and pseudo-first-order rate constants were obtained. Relative rate constants calculated from these data illustrated the five most reactive substrates; in order of decreasing reactivity were those derived from Cys, Tyr, Trp, Met, and Gly. Second-order rate constants were determined for these substrates by varying substrate concentration under pseudo-first-order conditions. Substrates derived from the other natural amino acids did not display significant reactivity, accelerating decomposition of the ferryl complex at a rate less than 10 times that of the control reaction with no substrate added. Ferryl decomposition rates changed in D(2)O/CD(3)CN for the Cys, Tyr, and Trp substrates, giving deuterium kinetic isotope effects of 4.3, 29, and 5.2, respectively, consistent with electron-transfer, proton-transfer (Cys and Trp), or hydrogen atom abstraction (Tyr) mechanisms. Decomposition rates for [Fe(IV)(O)(N4Py)](2+) in the presence of the Met and Gly substrates were identical in H(2)O/CH(3)CN versus D(2)O/CD(3)CN solvents. A deuterium kinetic isotope effect of 4.8 was observed with the labeled substrate 2,2-d(2)-Ac-Gly-NHtBu, consistent with [Fe(IV)(O)(N4Py)](2+) abstracting an alpha-hydrogen atom from Ac-Gly-NHtBu and generating a glycyl radical. Abstraction of alpha-hydrogen atoms from amino acid substrates other than Gly and oxidation of side chains contained in the amino acids other than Cys, Tyr, Trp, and Met were slow by comparison.",M1
19574568,"Technical note: correction of net portal absorption of nitrogen compounds for differences in methods: first step of a meta-analysis.The objective of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of correcting net portal absorption (NPA) of urea-N, ammonia, and <e>AA</e>-N for differences in methods before their inclusion into a meta-analysis. It was hypothesized that the difference, or portal-drained viscera (PDV) balance, between N inputs (apparently digested N plus urea-N) and outputs (ammonia plus AA-N) was 0 in the absence of measurement errors and based on the assumption that other sources of N inputs and outputs were relatively small and balanced each other. A database was built from 44 publications that reported data from 129 treatments (sheep, n = 71; beef cattle, n = 32; and dairy cows, n = 26). When necessary, NPA of urea-N (n = 38) and ammonia (n = 35) results were recalculated on a whole-blood basis, whereas NPA of AA-N (n = 87) was recalculated for all the N from AA transferred across the PDV rather than only the N from the alpha-amino group. Before corrections, PDV balance averaged 22.9% of N ingested (SD 29.0) for all treatments; after corrections, PDV balance significantly decreased to 10.2% of N ingested (SD 34.7). No difference in PDV balance was observed among species before or after corrections. Correcting NPA of urea-N, ammonia, and AA-N increased the accuracy without improving precision. Therefore, from a biological perspective, recalculating reported data seems appropriate to reduce bias due to differences in methods because this approach reduces the excess in N inputs relative to N outputs.",M1
19574567,"Effect of the degree and duration of early dietary amino acid restrictions on subsequent and overall pig performance and physical and sensory characteristics of pork.The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the degree and duration of early dietary <e>AA</e> restrictions on subsequent and overall pig performance and physical and sensory characteristics of pork. For the grower (G) and finisher-1 (F1) phases, 3 corn-soybean meal diets were formulated to contain 100, 80, or 60% of the 1998 NRC total Lys recommendations (100G, 80G, or 60G, and 100F1, 80F1, or 60F1, for the G and F1 phases, respectively). For the finisher-2 (F2) phase, a common corn-soybean meal diet was formulated to satisfy the 1998 NRC total Lys recommendation. Thirty gilts and 30 castrated males (2 gilts or 2 castrated males/pen) were randomly assigned to 5 dietary treatments (100G-100F1, 80G-100F1, 80G-80F1, 60G-100F1, and 60G-60F1) when BW was 22.7 +/- 0.3 kg. Pigs were switched to F1 and F2 diets at 50.7 +/- 0.4 and 79.9 +/- 0.5 kg of BW, respectively. Pigs had ad libitum access to feed and water. All pigs were slaughtered at 110.7 +/- 0.5 kg of BW, and LM samples were collected. Pigs fed the 60G diet had less (P &lt; or = 0.05) ADG during the G phase and greater (P &lt; or = 0.05) ultrasound backfat (UBF) at the end of the G phase than those fed the 100G diet. The ADG decreased linearly (R(2) = 0.70; P &lt; 0.001) as the degree of AA restrictions became more severe. Although serum total protein (TP) and albumin concentrations in pigs fed the 60G-100F1 diets were less (P &lt; or = 0.05) than those fed the 100G-100F1 diets at the end of the G phase, TP concentration was similar between the 2 groups at the end of the F1 phase. Likewise, ADG during the F1 phase and UBF at the end of the F1 phase in pigs fed the 60G-100F1 diets were similar to those fed the 100G-100F1 diets. Feeding the 80G diet resulted in numerically decreased ADG during the G phase, but there was no difference in ADG during the F1 and F2 phases or UBF at the end of F1 and F2 phases between pigs fed the 80G and 100G diets. Overall, pigs fed the 80G-80F1 diets had similar ADG, but less (P &lt; or = 0.05) fat-free lean gain (LG) than those fed the 100G-100F1 diets. These pigs also had less (P &lt; or = 0.05) serum TP and albumin concentrations than pigs fed the 100G-100F1 diets throughout the study. Pigs fed the 60G-60F1 diets had less (P &lt; or = 0.05) overall ADG and G:F and less (P &lt; or = 0.05) LM area and LG than those fed the 100G-100F1 diets. However, they had a greater (P &lt; or = 0.05) subjective marbling score than those fed the 100G-100F1 diets. The results indicated that pigs fed the 80G-80F1 diets may have exhibited compensatory growth in BW gain, but not in terms of lean accretion. Growth performance and carcass traits of pigs fed the 60G-60F1 diets were reduced, indicating that the restriction may have been too severe or too long or both. Early dietary AA restrictions had no clear effect on physical and sensory characteristics of pork.",M1

19545553,"Improved MS/MS analysis of succinylacetone extracted from dried blood spots when combined with amino acids and acylcarnitine butyl esters.BACKGROUND: The utilization of succinylacetone (SUAC) as the primary metabolic marker for tyrosinemia Type I is now well known, thus new methods have been developed to analyze SUAC as a first tier test in newborn screening. One approach is to prepare a SUAC hydrazine derivative from the dried blood spots (DBS) previously utilized in the extraction of acylcarnitine (AC) and amino acids (<e>AA</e>). The final derivatized products of SUAC, AA and AC are combined in a single tandem mass spectrometric (MS/MS) analysis. However, butyl esterification techniques may result in contamination of underivatized acylcarnitines by as much as 20%. We have developed a simple wash step to improve the combined analysis of SUAC, AA and AC in DBS by MS/MS. METHODS: AA and AC were extracted with methanol containing labeled internal standard from 3.2mm punches taken from the DBS specimen. The previously extracted blood spot that remains after removal of the methanol extraction solvent was used in the preparation of SUAC with and without additional washing of the blood spot. The butyl ester eluates of AA and AC, and SUAC hydrazine derivatives were recombined and measured by MS/MS. RESULTS: Three additional methanol wash steps of the remaining DBS punches prior to SUAC derivatization reduced the presence of underivatized acylcarnitines, resulting in a 4-fold reduction of underivatized palmitoylcarnitine. Palmitoylcarnitine butyl ester is detected at m/z 456 while the underivatized species is detected at m/z 400, which is also the mass of dodecanoylcarnitine butyl ester. The linearity of the SUAC assay was unchanged by the additional wash steps. For butyl esterification methods, the preferred analytic procedure, the presence of AC can compromise the results of a newborn screen for the actual concentrations of acylcarnitines. It is essential to remove any underivatized acylcarnitines prior to SUAC analysis. CONCLUSION: The additional methanol wash steps did not alter SUAC assay results but did remove underivatized acylcarnitines which could result in the incorrect quantification of acylcarnitines.",M1
19528608,"Effect of abomasal glucose infusion on splanchnic amino acid metabolism in periparturient dairy cows.Six Holstein cows fitted with ruminal cannulas and permanent indwelling catheters in the portal vein, hepatic vein, mesenteric vein, and an artery were used to study the effects of abomasal glucose infusion on splanchnic <e>AA</e> metabolism. The experimental design was a split plot, with cow as the whole plot, treatment as the whole-plot factor and days in milk (DIM) as the subplot factor. Cows were assigned to 1 of 2 treatments: control or infusion of 1,500 g/d of glucose into the abomasum from the day of calving to 29 DIM. Cows were sampled prepartum and at 4, 15, and 29 DIM. Postpartum dry matter intake increased at a lower rate with infusion compared with the control. Arterial concentrations of all essential AA (EAA) were lower with infusion compared with the control. Net portal fluxes of His, Ile, Leu, Lys, Met, Phe, Thr, Val, Ala, Pro, Ser, and Tyr were lower with infusion compared with the control and the net portal fluxes of these AA showed positive correlations with dry matter intake, whereas the net portal fluxes of Asp, Glu, and Gln were unaffected by treatment. Net hepatic fluxes of EAA were not affected by treatment but increased as lactation progressed with both treatments. On a net basis, all EAA were removed by the liver prepartum and at 4 DIM, whereas Met, Phe, and Thr were the only EAA being removed at 29 DIM. Except for Ala, AA removed by the liver might be used primarily for noncatabolic processes, as exemplified by the 16% of hepatic Gly uptake accounted for as urinary hippurate. The measured hepatic uptake of glucogenic precursors (glucogenic AA, volatile fatty acids, lactate, and glycerol) accounted for 50 to 90% of the hepatic release of glucose. The hepatic urea output accounted for more than 100% of the hepatic ureagenic precursor uptake, indicating that the glucogenic precursors unaccounted for are nonnitrogen-containing compounds. In conclusion, an increased exogenous glucose supply to the small intestine did not seem to affect the amount of EAA and non-EAA available for peripheral tissues in early lactation, and the study did not indicate an AA-sparing effect of small intestinal glucose absorption. In periparturient dairy cows, hepatic catabolism of AA was not driven by the increased whole-body demand for glucose, and Ala was the only AA that contributed substantially to hepatic gluconeogenesis. In very early lactation, the supply of EAA might be of greater concern than the supply of glucogenic substrates.",M1
19528600,"Differences in splanchnic metabolism between late gestation and early lactation dairy cows.In the transition from the pre- to postcalving state, the demands on the cow increase from support of gestation to high rates of milk production. This extra demand is met partly by increased intake but may also involve altered metabolism of major nutrients. Six multiparous Holstein cows were used to monitor changes in net fluxes of nutrients across the portal-drained viscera and liver (splanchnic tissues) between late gestation and early lactation. Blood samples were obtained simultaneously from the portal, hepatic, and subcutaneous abdominal veins and the caudal aorta 18 d before expected calving and 21 or 42 d after calving. On the day of blood sampling and the 3 d preceding sampling, cows were fed every 2 h. The precalving (1.63 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg and 1,326 g of metabolizable protein/d) and postcalving (1.72 Mcal of net energy for lactation/kg and 2,136 g of metabolizable protein/d) diets were based on corn silage, alfalfa hay, and corn grain. Dry matter intake increased postcalving. Net splanchnic release of glucose increased postpartum because of tendencies for both increased portal absorption and net liver release. Increased removal of lactate, rather than <e>AA</e>, contributed to the additional hepatic gluconeogenesis. Although portal absorption of AA increased with intake at the onset of lactation, hepatic removal of total AA-N tended to decline. This clearly indicates that liver removal of AA is not linked to portal absorption. Furthermore, net liver removal relative to total liver inflow even decreased for Gly, His, Met, Phe, and Tyr. Together, these data indicate that in early lactation, metabolic priority is given to direct AA toward milk protein production rather than gluconeogenesis, in cows fed a corn-based ration.",M1
19523452,"Insulin mediates the linkage acceleration of muscle protein synthesis, thermogenesis, and heat storage by amino acids.Amino acid (<e>AA</e>) administration can stimulate heat accumulation in the body, as especially found under anesthetic conditions. To test our hypothesis that marked rise in plasma insulin concentrations following AA administration plays an important role in the heat storage, we intravenously administered either a balanced AA mixture or saline over 3 h, both with and without a primed-constant infusion of somatostatin in propofol-anesthetized rats. Rats on AA but lacking marked rise in plasma insulin by somatostatin treatment failed to show: attenuation of fall in core body temperature; partial increases in oxygen consumption; and stimulated muscle protein synthesis. Furthermore, the AA's stimulatory effects on phosphorylation of mTOR, 4E-BP1, and S6K1 were partially blocked by somatostatin. Our findings strongly suggest that the marked rise in insulin following AA administration promote translation initiation activities and stimulate muscle protein synthesis, which facilitates heat accumulation in the body.",M1
19518060,"Molecular dynamics investigations on the effect of D amino acid substitution in a triple-helix structure and the stability of collagen.Studies on the structure and stability of peptides and proteins during l--&gt;d configurational change are certainly important for the designing of peptides with new biological activity and protein engineering. The l--&gt;d amino acid (d <e>AA</e>) changes have been observed in aged proteins such as collagen. Hence, in this study, an attempt has been made to explore the effect of the replacement of l amino acid (l AA) in the model collagen-like peptides with d AA and the origin of structural stability (destability) has been traced using the molecular dynamics (MD) method employing the AMBER force field. Our results reveal that the substitution of d AA produces a large local disruption to the triple-helical structure. Formation of a kink (bulge) at the site of substitution is observed from the detailed analysis of MD trajectory. However, this local perturbation of kinked helix changes the direction of the helices and affects the relative orientation of the respective AA residues for helix-helix interaction, enough to affect the overall stability of the model collagen-like peptide. The destabilization energy per d Ala substitution is 7.87 kcal/mol, which is similar to the value for the Gly--&gt;Ala mutation in collagen. Since the Gly--&gt;Ala mutation is involved in genetic disorders such as osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), the l--&gt;d configurational change may produce a similar effect on collagen.",M1
19500999,"Oral protein supplementation alone improves anabolism in a dose-dependent manner in chronic hemodialysis patients.OBJECTIVE: We examined the protein anabolic effects of Pro-Stat 64, a high nitrogen-containing, enzyme-hydrolyzed, tryptophan-fortified, collagen protein supplement administrated during hemodialysis, at two different dosing regimens. DESIGN: This was a randomized, controlled, prospective study with 3 different groups: control, single dose of supplementation, and double dose of supplementation. SETTING: This study was performed at a clinical research center. PATIENTS: Six prevalent chronic hemodialysis (HD) patients were enrolled: 5 males, 1 female, 4 African Americans, and 2 Caucasians. Their mean age was 45 +/- 11 years (S.D.). Two patients were diabetic. METHODS: Protein turnover studies were performed using amino-acid (<e>AA</e>) balance and primed constant infusion of L-(1-(13)C) leucine. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Whole-body protein balance was determined according to substrate kinetics. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant difference at any time point between protocols for blood chemistries and hormonal markers, except for minor variations in plasma glucose. All plasma AA groups displayed decreases during a control study, in which no supplementation was given. Compared with the control group, plasma nonessential AA and total AA concentrations were statistically significantly higher during HD after both single and double doses of supplementation. The forearm arteriovenous AA balance was statistically significantly better for essential, nonessential, and total AA uptake after both single-dose and double-dose supplementation compared with the control group, except for nonessential AA, which was significantly better only after a double dose. Whole-body protein breakdown and net protein balance were statistically significantly better during HD with a double-dose administration in a dose-dependent manner, compared with the control and single-dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral AA supplementation alone improves whole-body and skeletal muscle protein anabolism in a dose-dependent manner in chronic HD patients. These data should be taken into account during clinical decision-making or when designing clinical trials of nutritional supplementation.",M1
19453132,"Molecular dynamics simulations of equilibrium and transport properties of amino acid-based room temperature ionic liquids.Molecular dynamics simulations are used to study liquid-state equilibrium and transport properties of the 1-ethyl-3-methylimidazolium salts of the 20 naturally occurring amino acids [emim][<e>AA</e>] that all form room temperature ionic liquids. These ionic liquids have been recently synthesized by Ohno and co-workers [J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 127, 2398], but other than measured ionic conductivity at 25 degrees C, there is a dearth of quantitative measurements on the physiochemical properties of these liquids. The goal is to computationally study the density, polarity, transference number, and ionic conductivity of this family of solvents. We also study the spatial correlations among the imidazolium cation and amino acid anions in these liquids by computing atomic and charge radial distribution functions and preparing polarity maps. The microscopic dynamics behavior of these materials is determined by studying the mean square displacements (MSD) and velocity autocorrelation functions (VACF). The diffusion coefficients of the liquids are determined using the MSD and VACF, and the contributions of the anions and cations to the transport of charge in the ionic liquids are studied. Ionic liquids of this family that show strong anion-anion and anion-cation associations in the simulations are experimentally observed to show anomalously low electrical conductivities. Knowledge of the microscopic structures and dynamics of these liquids can allow for an intelligent choice of a solvent from this class that has required polarity and ionic conductivity.",M1
19439631,"Effect of inclusion of cellulose in the diet on the inevitable endogenous amino acid losses in the ileum of broiler chicken.The objective of this study was to determine the inevitable endogenous amino acid (<e>AA</e>) loss at the terminal ileum of broilers that were fed diets with 2 different fiber levels using a regression approach. The design of the study was a randomized complete block employing a factorial arrangement of treatments with 3 CP levels (50, 90, and 130 g/kg) and 2 fiber levels. The fiber level was adjusted by inclusion of cellulose at the expense of cornstarch. The AA pattern of the CP was the same in all diets. Titanium dioxide was used as indigestible marker. Six cages of 8 birds were allocated to each diet. The experimental diets were offered for ad libitum consumption for 3 d, starting on 21 d of age. Digesta were sampled on a cage basis from the distal two-thirds of the intestine section between Meckel's diverticulum and 2 cm anterior to the ileo-ceca-colonic junction. Inevitable endogenous CP and AA losses were determined by extrapolating the linear regressions between intake and prececal flow toward zero intake. The inevitable losses of CP and AA, expressed in relation to DM intake, were significantly increased by increased cellulose inclusion in the diet. Amino acids with the greatest loss were Glu, Asp, and Thr, whereas Met was the AA with the lowest loss. The ranking of the concentrations of AA of inevitable CP loss was very similar between the 2 fiber levels. This ranking also was similar in comparison to published values for the endogenous AA losses in broilers. It was concluded that the fiber level in the diet can affect the amount of AA inevitably lost at the terminal ileum and that all AA are affected to a similar extent. The results suggest that there is no effect of enhanced fiber level in the diet on AA composition of prececal endogenous CP loss in broilers. These findings can be considered in modeling the AA requirements of broilers.",M1
19423917,"Cu(II)-catalyzed reactions in ternary [Cu(<e>AA</e>)(AA - H)]+ complexes (AA = Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, t-Leu, Phe).The unimolecular chemistry of [Cu(II)AA(AA - H)](+) complexes, composed of an intact and a deprotonated amino acid (AA) ligand, have been probed in the gas phase by tandem and multistage mass spectrometry in an electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometer. The amino acids examined include Gly, Ala, Val, Leu, Ile, t-Leu and Phe. Upon collisionally-activated dissociation (CAD), the [Cu(II)AA(AA - H)](+) complexes undergo decarboxylation with simultaneous reduction of Cu(II) to Cu(I); during this process, a radical site is created at the alpha-carbon of the decarboxylated ligand (H(2)N(1) - (*)C(alpha)H - C(beta)H(2) - R; R = side chain substituent). The radical site is able to move along the backbone of the decarboxylated amino acid to form two new radicals (HN(1)(*) - C(alpha)H(2) - C(beta)H(2) - R and H(2)N(1) - C(alpha)H(2) - (*)C(beta)H - R). From the complexes of Gly and t-Leu, only C(alpha) and N(1) radicals can be formed. The whole radical ligand can be lost to form [Cu(I)AA](+) from these three isomeric radicals. Alternatively, further radical induced dissociations can take place along the backbone of the decarboxylated amino acid ligand to yield [Cu(II)AA(AA - 2H - CO(2))](+), [Cu(I)AA((*)NH(2))](+), [Cu(I)AA(HN = C(alpha)H(2))](+), or [Cu(I)AA(H(2)N - C(alpha)H = C(beta)H - R'](+) (R' = partial side chain substituent). The sodiated copper complexes, [Cu(II)(AA - H + Na)(AA - H)](+), show the same fragmentation patterns as their non-sodiated counterparts; sodium ion is retained on the intact amino acid ligand and is not involved in the CAD pathways. The amino groups of both AA units, the carbonyl group of the intact amino acid, and the deprotonated hydroxyl oxygen coordinate Cu(II) in square-planar fashion. Ab initio calculations indicate that the metal ion facilitates hydrogen atom shuttling between the N(1), C(alpha) and C(beta) atoms of the decarboxylated amino acid ligand. The dissociations of the decarboxylated radical ions unveil important insight about the so far largely unknown intrinsic chemistry of alpha-amino acid and peptide radicals, which are implicated as intermediates in numerous pathogenic biological processes.",M1

Intermolecular Forces, 1981, 3, 331) and OPLS-<e>AA</e> (Jorgensen et al., J Am Chem Soc, 1996, 118, 11225) potential parameter sets were used. A rigorous approach for the computation of high precision free energy profiles at water-vapor interface using constraint force technique is implemented. Methodology of obtaining high precision potential of mean force (PMF) profiles free of simulation artifacts in MD simulations is outlined and discussed. The accuracy of the calculations is examined by comparing the hydration free energies of studied solutes obtained from PMF calculations and separately using Bennett acceptance ratio technique by decoupling solvent-solute interactions in the bulk. All molecules exhibit a free energy minimum at interface. No significant desolvation barrier is observed for any of the studied species. Adsorption energies for studied molecules at water-vapor interface are estimated and compared with experimental observations. We find that for modeled neutral compounds pronounced surface influence on solute solvation vanishes already at 6-7 A behind the water surface as the solvation free energy approaches the bulk value. The possibility of force field refinement using adsorption free energies is outlined.",M1
19403950,"Plasma amino acid responses after consumption of beverages with varying protein type.PURPOSE: To examine how different proteins in a carbohydrate-protein beverage affect postprandial amino acid (<e>AA</e>), glucose, and insulin responses. METHODS: Two randomized, repeated-measures experiments were performed. In one, 10 volunteers drank 3 carbohydrate-protein beverages (380 kcal, 76 g carbohydrate, 19 g protein, 2 g fat) in separate (&gt;7 days) trials, each differing in protein type. All drinks consisted of cocoa (4 g) and nonfat dry milk (1 g) supplemented with casein (CAS), whey (WP), or a casein and whey blend (CAS-WP). Ten additional volunteers consumed the same drinks after 60 min of varying-intensity exercise (60% and 85% VO2peak). Blood glucose, insulin, glucose-dependent insulinotrophic polypeptide (GIP), and AAs were measured every 15-30 min for 4 hr after beverage consumption. RESULTS: Branched-chain AA concentrations peaked at 30 min and did not differ between beverages at rest (0.69 +/- 0.12 mmol/L) or postexercise (0.70 +/- 0.07 mmol/L). There were no significant differences between beverages with respect to initial (time 0-60) or total area under the curve (time 0-240) for any outcome measures at rest or postexercise. CONCLUSION: High-carbohydrate beverages containing various proportions of milk proteins procured from a supplier to the commercial industry had no impact on AA concentration. Retrospective chemical analysis of commercial proteins showed that casein was partially hydrolyzed; therefore, consumers should carefully consider the manufacturer (to ensure that the product contains intact protein) or other factors (i.e., cost or taste) when procuring these beverages for their purported physiological effects.",M1
19403714,"High rates of mammary tissue protein turnover in lactating goats are energetically costly.The high energetic demands and metabolism of amino acids (<e>AA</e>) within the lactating mammary gland have been ascribed to the requirements for milk component synthesis and tissue maintenance. Our objective in this work was to assess rates of protein synthesis from several AA so that the energetic costs of tissue maintenance could be better reflected. Lactating goats (n = 4) were given staggered infusions of 5 labeled forms of phenylalanine (Phe) initiated at 30, 12, 9, 6, and 3 h before goats were killed. [5-(13)CH(3)] Methionine (Met), [1-(13)C] leucine, and [1-(13)C] valine were also infused for 30 h, during which time, the glands were milked hourly and arteriovenous flux measurements were performed the last 6 h. A dynamic, compartmental model capable of simulating fluxes of AA through extracellular and intracellular free, slow and fast turnover tissue-bound, and milk protein pools was developed and fitted to the observed data. The udder removed 81% of the Phe present in plasma using 31% for milk protein synthesis and releasing 66% back into plasma. Transamination accounted for 40% of Phe flux in the mammary and transmethylation accounted for a portion of mammary Met flux. Mammary tissue protein synthesis was &gt;300% the value of milk protein synthesis with fractional protein synthesis rates &gt;130%/d. Assuming 4 mol of ATP/mol of peptide bond formed, we estimate that approximately 50% of ATP generated by the lactating mammary glands is used for synthesis of tissue (nonmilk) protein.",M1
19403708,"Dietary and endogenous amino acids are the main contributors to microbial protein in the upper gut of normally nourished pigs.Although amino acids (<e>AA</e>) synthesized by enteric microbiota in the upper gut of nonruminants can be absorbed, they do not necessarily make a net contribution to the host's AA supply. That depends on whether protein or nonprotein nitrogen sources are used for microbial protein production. We determined the contributions of urea, endogenous protein (EP), and dietary protein (DP) to microbial valine (M.VAL) at the distal ileum of growing pigs, based on isotope dilutions after a 4-d continuous infusion of l-[1-(13)C]valine to label EP and of [(15)N(15)N]urea. Eight barrows were assigned to either a cornstarch and soybean meal-based diet with or without 12% added fermentable fiber from pectin. Dietary pectin did not affect (P &gt; 0.10) the contributions of the endogenous and DP to M.VAL. More than 92% of valine in microbial protein in the upper gut was derived from preformed AA from endogenous and DP, suggesting that de novo synthesis makes only a small contribution to microbial AA.",M1

19395509,"Amino acid digestibility of distillers dried grains with solubles, produced from sorghum, a sorghum-corn blend, and corn fed to growing pigs.The objective of this experiment was to measure the concentration and digestibility of CP and <e>AA</e> in distillers dried grains with solubles (DDGS) produced from sorghum (S-DDGS) or a blend of sorghum and corn grains (SC-DDGS), and to compare these values with the digestibility of CP and AA in corn-based DDGS (C-DDGS). Eleven growing barrows (initial BW = 44.6 +/- 6.5 kg) were surgically fitted with a T-cannula in the distal ileum and allotted to a Youden square design with 11 diets and 8 periods. One diet contained 66.7% S-DDGS, 1 diet contained 66.7% SC-DDGS, 8 diets contained 66.7% C-DDGS, and 1 diet was N-free. Chromic oxide (0.3%) was used in all diets as an indigestible marker. The direct procedure was used to measure apparent ileal digestibility (AID) and standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of CP and AA in the 10 sources of DDGS. Results of the experiment showed that the AID of Lys was not different among S-DDGS, SC-DDGS, and C-DDGS. The mean SID of CP, Arg, and Lys in C-DDGS were not different from values obtained in S-DDGS and SC-DDGS. The SID of Trp in S-DDGS (72.0%) was greater (P &lt; 0.01) than in C-DDGS (64.9%), but there was no difference between C-DDGS and SC-DDGS (62.4%). The SID of CP and all AA were different among the 8 sources of C-DDGS (P &lt; 0.01). Among the indispensable AA, Lys had the greatest variation and the SID ranged from 55.7 to 68.7%. The concentration of total and digestible AA was highly correlated (r(2)) for Arg (0.88), Ile (0.85), Leu (0.82), Phe (0.84), and Trp (0.84), but reduced r(2) values were observed for Lys (0.66) and Thr (0.39). A low correlation between the concentration and digestibility of AA indicates that it is desirable to develop in vitro procedures to predict digestible AA concentration in DDGS. In conclusion, SID values for CP and Lys in S-DDGS and SC-DDGS are within the range of values obtained in C-DDGS, but for many other AA, SID values in S-DDGS and in SC-DDGS are less than in C-DDGS.",M1
19375530,"Searching for specific motifs in affinity capture in proteome analysis.In analysing the red blood cell cytoplasmic proteome, in search for low abundance proteins, 15 amino acid (<e>AA</e>; Arg, Asn, Asp, Gln, Gly, His, Ile, Lys, Phe, Pro, Ser, Thr, Trp, Tyr, and Val) probes, used individually, captured a total of 787 unique gene products. Of those, 76 were found to be the common catch of all AA probes, 497 were captured by more than one (but not all) probe, and 214 were captured by only one probe. By using the InterPro database, for 151 of the 214 IPIs associated with proteins captured by a single amino acid, we have found 265 annotations of motifs (231 protein domains, 3 binding sites, 3 active sites, 13 conserved sites, and 15 repeats). Among these 151 proteins annotated, there are 75 domains, 2 active sites, 5 conserved sites, and 3 repeats (a total of 85 motifs) that are at all effects amino acid strictly specific. As a result of these findings, these 85 amino acid specific motifs singled out 40 (18.69%) of the total list of 214 proteins representing the total capture of the 15 AAs here reported. If one considers that only for 151 (70.56%) of the 214 proteins data about interacting motifs could be collected, the percentage of proteins for which the 85 amino acid strictly specific motifs have been found increases to the even more relevant value of 26.49%. The identified motifs can partially explain the exclusive protein capture of the 15 amino acid probes. The unique general and specific capturing ability of two of these AA probes, Phe and Arg, is evaluated, discussed and put in perspective.",M1
19370376,"The role of extrafloral nectar amino acids for the preferences of facultative and obligate ant mutualists.Plants in some 300 genera produce extrafloral nectar (EFN) to attract ants as a means of indirect defence. Among Mesoamerican Acacia species, obligate myrmecophytes produce EFN constitutively to nourish symbiotic ant mutualists, while non-myrmecophytes induce EFN secretion in response to herbivore damage to attract non-symbiotic ants. Since symbiotic Acacia ants entirely depend on the host-derived food rewards while non-symbiotic ants need to be attracted to EFN, this system allows comparative analyses of the function of EFN components in ant nutrition and attraction. We investigated sugar and amino acid (<e>AA</e>) composition in EFN of two myrmecophytes (Acacia cornigera and Acacia hindsii) and two related non-myrmecophyte species (Acacia farnesiana and Prosopis juliflora). AA composition allowed a grouping of myrmecophytes vs. non-myrmecophytes. Behavioural assays with obligate Acacia inhabitants (Pseudomyrmex ferrugineus) and non-symbiotic ants showed that AA composition affected ant preferences at high but not at low AA/sugar ratios. Most interestingly, behavioural responses differed between the two types of ants tested: Symbiotic ants showed a clear preference for higher AA concentrations and preferred nectar mimics with those four AAs that most significantly characterised the specific nectar of their Acacia host plant. In contrast, non-symbiotic ants distinguished among nectars containing different sugars and between solutions with and without AAs but neither among nectars with different AA/sugar ratios nor among mimics containing different numbers of AAs. Our results confirm that both AAs and sugars contribute to the taste and attractiveness of nectars and demonstrate that the responses of ants to specific nectar components depend on their life style. AAs are a chemical EFN component that likely can shape the structure of ant-plant mutualisms.",M1

STUDY DESIGN: This was a retrospective study of ELBW infants between 2000 and 2007. Nutritional intake and laboratory results were monitored during the first 5 days of life. Growth rates and complications were followed until discharge. RESULT: Infants were similar in birth weight (BW), gestational age (GA) and severity of illness. The age at initiation of AA decreased significantly over time. Age at weight nadir, return to BW and percent postnatal weight loss decreased in epoch 3. There were modest increases in blood urea nitrogen (BUN), but no significant metabolic disturbances were observed. Cholestasis was more prevalent in epoch 2. CONCLUSION: AA administration within the first hours of life appears to be safe and beneficial for ELBW infants. Absent signs of renal dysfunction, a modest rise in BUN is consistent with the neonate's utilization of AAs for energy.",M1

19333680,"Collagen-related abnormalities, reduction in bone quality, and effects of menatetrenone in rats with a congenital ascorbic acid deficiency.In this study, we focused on collagen metabolism as a factor involved in menatetrenone (MK-4)-related improvement in bone quality. Using rats with a congenital ascorbic acid (<e>AA</e>) deficiency, osteogenic disorder Shionogi (ODS) rats, we established a model in which abnormal collagen metabolism reduced bone mechanical properties, and investigated the effects of MK-4. We divided 13-week-old ODS rats into four groups: Pre, AA sufficiency (AA(+)), AA deficiency-control (AA(-)control), and AA deficiency+ MK-4-treated (AA(-)MK-4). MK-4 was given as a dietary supplement (30 mg/kg). At the beginning (pre) and after two, three, and four weeks, seven rats in each group were killed to measure plasma bone metabolism and femoral bone mass data and bone mechanical properties. In the rats killed after four weeks, histomorphometric data of the tibiae, the total amino acid level in bone collagen, and rates of proline and lysine hydroxylation were determined. In the AA(+)group, both the cortical bone mass data and bone mechanical properties were serially increased. However, in the AA(-)control group, the cortical bone mass data were similar for four weeks and the bone mechanical properties decreased after three to four weeks. After four weeks, the total level of amino acids in bone collagen and rates of proline and lysine hydroxylation were significantly lower in the AA(-)control group than in the AA(+)group. MK-4 increased bone mechanical properties after four weeks without influencing cortical bone mass. Simultaneously, it inhibited decreases in the total level of amino acids in collagen (P = 0.017). The rates of proline and lysine hydroxylation were higher in the AA(-)MK-4 group than in the AA(-)control group, but not significantly. These results suggest the level of collagen and abnormalities of hydroxylation are involved in the AA deficiency-related reduction in bone mechanical properties, and that MK-4 improves bone mechanical properties by restoring collagen metabolism.",M1

The strain was moderately halophilic, facultatively alkaliphilic and obligately aerobic. Colonies were white. Growth occurred with 1.0-30.0 % NaCl (optimum, 10.0 % NaCl), at pH 6.0-10.0 (optimum, pH 8.5) and at 5-40 degrees C (optimum, 25 degrees C). The major amino acid constituents of the cell wall were glycine and lysine. The major cellular fatty acids were anteiso-C(15 : 0), anteiso-C(17 : 0) and iso-C(15 : 0). MK-6 was the predominant respiratory quinone, with MK-7 present in minor amounts. The polar lipids consisted of diphosphatidylglycerol, phosphatidylglycerol and an unidentified phospholipid. The DNA G+C content was 46.1 mol%. Phylogenetic analysis based on 16S rRNA gene sequence comparisons revealed that strain YIM-Y21(T) was most closely related to the type strains of the nine recognized species of the genus Salinicoccus. The sequence similarities between the isolate and the type strains of members of this genus were in the range of 90.6-93.8 %, which indicated that strain YIM-Y21(T) is a representative of a novel species within the genus Salinicoccus.

It has been shown that the 1-34 amino acid fragment of PTH is sufficient to bind and activate the PTH type-I receptor. Recent investigations focusing on the interaction of N-terminal fragments of PTH with PTH type-I receptor showed that certain modifications can increase signalling potency in peptides as short as 11 amino acids. To understand the role of the side chains of all the amino acid residues in PTH(1-11), we synthesized all-D PTH, three retro-inverso analogues of the most active modified PTH(1-11), H-Aib-Val-Aib-Glu-Ile-Gln-Leu-Nle-His-Gln-Har-NH(2), and we substituted every L-<e>AA</e> of the latter with the corresponding D-AA, obtaining a library of PTH(1-11) analogues that were tested as agonists. The library was synthesized by SPPS, employing the Fmoc protocol. The biological tests showed that the activity of the D-Har11 analogue is of the same order of magnitude of that of the most active modified PTH(1-11). This behaviour is paralleled by an increase of the helical content on going from the D-Val(2) to the D-Har(11) analogue. This is in agreement with previous work where a correlation between activity and helical content has been demonstrated. The importance of a positively charged group in the C-terminal position is shown to be independent of the configuration of the C(alpha)-carbon.",M1
19301095,"Amino acids: metabolism, functions, and nutrition.Recent years have witnessed the discovery that amino acids (<e>AA</e>) are not only cell signaling molecules but are also regulators of gene expression and the protein phosphorylation cascade. Additionally, AA are key precursors for syntheses of hormones and low-molecular weight nitrogenous substances with each having enormous biological importance. Physiological concentrations of AA and their metabolites (e.g., nitric oxide, polyamines, glutathione, taurine, thyroid hormones, and serotonin) are required for the functions. However, elevated levels of AA and their products (e.g., ammonia, homocysteine, and asymmetric dimethylarginine) are pathogenic factors for neurological disorders, oxidative stress, and cardiovascular disease. Thus, an optimal balance among AA in the diet and circulation is crucial for whole body homeostasis. There is growing recognition that besides their role as building blocks of proteins and polypeptides, some AA regulate key metabolic pathways that are necessary for maintenance, growth, reproduction, and immunity. They are called functional AA, which include arginine, cysteine, glutamine, leucine, proline, and tryptophan. Dietary supplementation with one or a mixture of these AA may be beneficial for (1) ameliorating health problems at various stages of the life cycle (e.g., fetal growth restriction, neonatal morbidity and mortality, weaning-associated intestinal dysfunction and wasting syndrome, obesity, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, the metabolic syndrome, and infertility); (2) optimizing efficiency of metabolic transformations to enhance muscle growth, milk production, egg and meat quality and athletic performance, while preventing excess fat deposition and reducing adiposity. Thus, AA have important functions in both nutrition and health.",M1
19288401,"Effect of seven tricyclic diterpenoids from needles of Taxus media var. Hicksii on stimulus-induced superoxide generation, tyrosyl or serine/threonine phosphorylation and translocation of cytosolic compounds to the cell membrane in human neutrophils.Taxol has been widely used as an anticancer drug for ovarian, breast, lung and prostate cancer. Some kinds of Taxus plants are widely distributed in the Northeast Asia region. We have isolated seven tricyclic diterpenoids, taxinine, taxagifine, 5-O-cinnamoyltaxacin I triacetate, 5-decinnamoyltaxinine J, 5-cinnamoyl-9-acetyltaxicin I, taxacin and taxol from the needles of Taxus media var. Hicksii, and investigated their effects on stimulus-induced superoxide generation and translocation of cytosolic compounds to the cell membrane in human neutrophils. Six tricyclic diterpenoids used in this experiment suppressed the superoxide generation induced by N-formyl-methionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine (fMLP) and arachidonic acid (<e>AA</e>) in a concentration-dependent manner. Taxinine significantly suppressed the superoxide generation induced by phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA). The compounds also suppressed fMLP- and AA-induced tyrosyl or PMA-induced serine/threonine phosphorylation, and translocation of cytosolic compounds, p47 (phox), p67 (phox) and Rac to the cell membrane in parallel with the suppression of the stimulus-induced superoxide generation.",M1
19286827,"Amino acid digestibility and concentration of digestible and metabolizable energy in soybean meal produced from conventional, high-protein, or low-oligosaccharide varieties of soybeans and fed to growing pigs.Two experiments were conducted to determine <e>AA</e> digestibility and the concentration of DE and ME in 5 sources of soybean meal (SBM). The 5 sources included hexane-extracted SBM produced from high-protein soybeans (SBM-HP) and conventional soybeans (SBM-CONV), and mechanically extruded-expelled SBM produced from high-protein soybeans (EE-SBM-HP), low-oligosaccharide soybeans (EE-SBM-LO), and conventional soybeans (EE-SBM-CONV). Five diets that each contained 1 source of SBM and a N-free diet were used in Exp. 1 to determine AA digestibility in each meal. Twelve growing barrows (initial BW: 67.7 +/- 1.34 kg) were allotted to a replicated 6 x 6 Latin square design with 6 periods and 6 diets in each square. Each period lasted 7 d, and ileal digesta were collected on d 6 and 7 of each period. Results of the experiment showed that the standardized ileal digestibility (SID) of all AA except Trp was similar for SBM-HP and SBM-CONV, but EE-SBM-HP and EE-SBM-LO had greater (P &lt; 0.05) SID of His, Ile, Lys, Thr, and Val than EE-SBM-CONV. The SID of all indispensable AA in EE-SBM-HP was greater (P &lt; 0.05) than in SBM-HP. The SID of Arg, Ile, Leu, and Phe in EE-SBM-CONV was greater (P &lt; 0.05) than in SBM-CONV, but the SID of Trp was also greater (P &lt; 0.05) in SBM-CONV than in EE-SBM-CONV. Experiment 2 was conducted to measure DE and ME in the same 5 sources of SBM as used in Exp. 1. Forty-eight growing barrows (initial BW: 38.6 +/- 3.46 kg) were placed in metabolism cages and randomly allotted to 6 diets with 8 replicates per diet. A corn-based diet and 5 diets based on a mixture of corn and each source of SBM were formulated. Urine and feces were collected during a 5-d collection period, and values for DE and ME in each source of SBM were calculated using the difference procedure. Results showed that the ME in SBM-HP tended to be greater (P = 0.10) than in SBM-CONV (4,074 vs. 3,672 kcal/kg of DM). The ME in EE-SBM-HP also tended to be greater (P = 0.10) than in EE-SBM-CONV and in EE-SBM-LO (4,069 vs. 3,620 and 3,721 kcal/kg of DM), but there was no difference in ME between extracted and extruded-expelled meals. It is concluded that SBM-HP has a greater feeding value than SBM-CONV because of greater concentrations of digestible AA and ME. Likewise, EE-SBM-LO has a greater concentration of most indispensable AA than EE-SBM-CONV, but the concentration of ME is similar in these 2 meals. Results of this experiment also showed that AA digestibility values in extruded-expelled SBM are greater than in hexane-extracted SBM.",M1
19282369,"Intestinal nitrogen recycling and utilization in health and disease.The role of intestinal microflora in digestive and metabolic processes has received increasing attention from researchers and clinicians. Both enterocytes and small intestine luminal microorganisms can degrade peptides and amino acids (<e>AA</e>). Further, enterocytes can utilize ammonia via glutamate, glutamine, citrulline, and urea synthesis, whereas luminal microbes will deaminate AA, hydrolyze luminal urea, and recycle this ammonia by synthesis of new microbial cells. Although, undoubtedly, some indispensable AA may arise from N cycling and microbial synthesis in the intestinal lumen, the actual net impact on protein nutrition status appears to be limited in humans and animals. Moreover, potential contributions of the recycled N as colonic luminal microbial proteins to AA in blood depend on colonic protein digestion and AA absorption. Finally, new evidence indicates that gut microbial metabolism may be enhanced by prebiotics and probiotics, with the prospects of new treatment paradigms for eliminating undesirable secondary N metabolites and ameliorating complications in whole-body N metabolism under the conditions of intestinal stress, liver disease, and kidney failure.",M1
19281806,"Altered amino acid homeostasis in subjects affected by fibromyalgia.OBJECTIVES: To evaluate plasma amino acid (<e>AA</e>) concentrations in patients affected by fibromyalgia (FM) and to study the relationships between their levels and FM clinical parameters. DESIGN AND METHODS: 20 AAs were assessed in 34 FM patients and in 18 healthy volunteers by means of a modified version of the Waters picotag method. RESULTS: Significant lower plasma taurine, alanine, tyrosine (Tyr), valine, methionine, phenylalanine and threonine concentrations, and the sum of essential AAs were observed in FM patients vs healthy controls (P&lt;0.05). Tyr CAA' ratio and the sum of AAs competing with tryptophan for brain uptake were significantly reduced in FM (P&lt;0.05). A significant correlation was found between FM clinical parameters and certain AAs. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest probable defects of gut malabsorption of certain AAs in FM patients. Moreover, given the reduced Tyr CAA' ratio in FM patients, a possible impairment of the cathecolaminergic system in the FM syndrome may be suggested.",M1
19251930,"Influence of glutamine infusion on ubiquitin, caspase-3, cathepsins L and B, and m-calpain expression in sheep with nutritionally induced metabolic acidosis.Provision of <e>AA</e> has shown success in attenuating proteolytic activity in monogastrics suffering from metabolic acidosis. However, it is unknown whether AA supplementation can provide any beneficial effects to ruminants with nutritionally induced metabolic acidosis. The objective of the current study was to examine the effects of glutamine infusion on various protein degradation components across several tissues in sheep with induced metabolic acidosis. Sheep were assigned to a randomized complete block design with 2 x 2 factorial arrangement of treatments (n = 6 sheep/treatment) consisting of a control or acidosis diet, and receiving a saline or L-glutamine infusion. Sheep were fed diets for 10 d and slaughtered on d 11. Liver, kidney, and muscle samples were collected at slaughter and examined for relative messenger RNA (mRNA) expression of ubiquitin, C8, E2, cathepsin L, cathepsin B, caspase-3, and m-calpain, as well as protein expression of ubiquitin. Relative mRNA expression of C8 (P = 0.02), E2 (P = 0.06), and ubiquitin (P = 0.07) was less in kidney in acidotic vs. control sheep. Additionally, mRNA expression of m-calpain in kidney was greater (P = 0.01) as a result of glutamine infusion. There were no significant alterations (P &gt; 0.10) in mRNA of any component as a result of acidosis in the liver or muscle. This study demonstrates the inability of metabolic acidosis to increase expression of the ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic pathway in skeletal muscle; however, downregulation of renal mRNA expression of these components is apparent during the induction of metabolic acidosis.",M1
19244369,"Improved nutritional management of phenylketonuria by using a diet containing glycomacropeptide compared with amino acids.BACKGROUND: Phenylketonuria (PKU) requires a lifelong low-phenylalanine diet that provides the majority of protein from a phenylalanine-free amino acid (<e>AA</e>) formula. Glycomacropeptide (GMP), an intact protein formed during cheese production, contains minimal phenylalanine. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate the effects of substituting GMP food products for the AA formula on acceptability, safety, plasma AA concentrations, and measures of protein utilization in subjects with PKU. DESIGN: Eleven subjects participated in an inpatient metabolic study with two 4-d treatments: a current AA diet (AA diet) followed by a diet that replaced the AA formula with GMP (GMP diet) supplemented with limiting AAs. Plasma concentrations of AAs, blood chemistries, and insulin were measured and compared in AA (day 4) and GMP diets (day 8). RESULTS: The GMP diet was preferred to the AA diet in 10 of 11 subjects with PKU, and there were no adverse reactions to GMP. There was no significant difference in phenylalanine concentration in postprandial plasma with the GMP diet compared with the AA diet. When comparing fasting with postprandial plasma, plasma phenalyalanine concentration increased significantly with the AA but not with the GMP diet. Blood urea nitrogen was significantly lower, which suggests decreased ureagenesis, and plasma insulin was higher with the GMP diet than with the AA diet. CONCLUSIONS: GMP, when supplemented with limiting AAs, is a safe and highly acceptable alternative to synthetic AAs as the primary protein source in the nutritional management of PKU. As an intact protein source, GMP improves protein retention and phenylalanine utilization compared with AAs.",M1
19233802,"Alfalfa cut at sundown and harvested as baleage increases bacterial protein synthesis in late-lactation dairy cows.Alfalfa (Medicago sativa L.) cut at sundown (p.m.) has been shown to have a greater concentration of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) than when cut at sunup (a.m.). Eight ruminally cannulated Holstein cows that were part of a larger lactation trial were used in a crossover design (24-d periods) to investigate the effects of alfalfa cutting time on digestibility and omasal flow of nutrients. Alfalfa was cut at sundown or sunup, field-wilted, and harvested as baleage (530 +/- 15.0 g of dry matter/kg of fresh matter). The difference in TNC concentration between p.m. and a.m. alfalfa within each pair of bales fed daily during the 10 d of data and sample collection varied from -10 to 50 g/ kg of dry matter. Each pair of bales was fed for ad libitum intake to cows once daily with no concentrate. During the 3 d of omasal sampling, intake (+0.8 kg/d) and omasal flow of organic matter (OM; +0.42 kg/d) tended to be greater when cows were fed p.m. vs. a.m. alfalfa, but no differences were found for ruminal and postruminal digestion of this nutrient. Similarly, N apparently digested ruminally and postruminally did not differ when feeding p.m. vs. a.m. alfalfa. However, N truly digested in the rumen, as a proportion of N intake, was significantly greater in cows fed p.m. (79%) vs. a.m. alfalfa (74%), thus suggesting that longer wilting time of alfalfa cut at sundown increased forage proteolysis. Supply of rumen-degradable protein did not change (2,716 g/d) when averaged across treatments, whereas omasal flow of non-NH(3) nonbacterial N was significantly decreased (-29 g/d) when feeding p.m. vs. a.m. alfalfa. Omasal flow of total bacterial non-NH(3)-N (NAN) increased (+21 g/d) significantly when cows were fed p.m. vs. a.m. alfalfa possibly because bacteria from cows fed p.m. alfalfa captured significantly more NH(3) than those from cows fed a.m. alfalfa. Therefore, greater availability of fermentable energy as TNC appears to increase the capacity of microbes to uptake NH(3)-N and convert it to microbial protein. Enhanced OM intake can also explain the observed increase in bacterial protein synthesis with p.m. alfalfa. Efficiency of bacterial protein synthesis, expressed on a fermented OM basis or as grams of bacterial NAN per gram of rumen-degradable N, did not differ between p.m. and a.m. alfalfa. Conversely, bacterial efficiency, as grams of bacterial NAN per gram of N intake, was significantly increased when cows were fed p.m. baleage. No significant difference between forage treatments was found for the omasal flow of total <e>AA</e> from omasal true digesta, suggesting no benefit of daytime cutting management on the passage of total AA to the lower gastrointestinal tract. Enhancing energy intake and TNC concentration of alfalfa by shifting forage cutting from sunup to sundown increased protein synthesis and NH(3) uptake by ruminal bacteria indicating an improvement in N utilization.",M1
19213717,"Effects of dietary protein concentration and amino acid supplementation on the feeding behavior of multiparous lactating sows in a tropical humid climate.Forty-seven mixed-parity Large White sows were used to determine the effect of diets with reduced CP content or supplemented with essential <e>AA</e> on 28-d lactation feeding behavior under humid tropical climatic conditions. The study was conducted at the INRA experimental facilities in Guadeloupe, French West Indies (latitude 16 degrees N, longitude 61 degrees W) between February 2007 and January 2008. Two seasons were distinguished a posteriori from climatic measurements continuously recorded in the open-front farrowing room. The average ambient temperature and average daily relative humidity for the warm season were 23.6 degrees C and 93.8%, respectively. The corresponding values for the hot season were 26.1 degrees C and 93.7%. The dietary experimental treatments were a normal protein diet (17.3%), a low protein diet (14.1%), and a normal protein diet supplemented with essential AA (17.6%). No interaction between season and diet composition was found for all criteria. Average daily feed intake was less (P &lt; 0.01) during the hot season (4,559 +/- 161 vs. 5,713 +/- 204 kg/d). Meal size was reduced during the hot season (542 +/- 37 vs. 757 +/- 47 g/meal; P &lt; 0.01). Daily ingestion time (45.5 +/- 3.2 vs. 55.8 +/- 4.0 min/d; P &lt; 0.05) was less in the hot season. Meal size was reduced during the hot season at night (P &lt; 0.01). In both seasons, daily feed intake, feed ingestion, and rate of feed intake were less (P &lt; 0.01) during the nocturnal period than during the diurnal period. The number of meals per day was not affected (P &gt; 0.10) by season or diet composition. Daily feed intake was greater for the sows fed the low protein diet when compared with normal protein treatments (P &lt; 0.05). Duration of standing was not affected by diet or season (P &gt; 0.05), and averaged 126 +/- 35 min/d. This study confirms that feeding behavior variables of the lactating sow are affected by seasonal pavariations of the tropical climate. Irrespective of season, the reduction of CP content improved feed consumption under tropical conditions.",M1
19213712,"Nitrogen- and energy-imbalanced diets affect hepatic protein synthesis and gluconeogenesis differently in growing lambs.The aim of this study was to assess the metabolic fate of <e>AA</e> (endogenous or export protein synthesis, gluconeogenesis, or oxidation) after an imbalanced supply of energy and N in the diet of growing lambs. Eighteen INRA 401 lambs (3 mo old, 29.7 +/- 0.45 kg of BW) were fed 3 experimental diets, one providing a N and energy supply according to recommended allowances (control), one with 23% less N supply relative to energy (LN), and one with 19% less ME supply relative to N (LE). Animals were assigned to 6 blocks of 3, with each animal receiving 1 of the 3 diets, and the animals from each block were slaughtered on the same day. Liver slices from these lambs were incubated in a minimum salt medium (Krebs-Henseleit) containing physiological concentrations of propionate and AA as energy and N sources, similarly across all 3 treatments. Protein synthesis (endogenous and export) using [U-(14)C]valine and [(35)S]methionine, gluconeogenesis from [1-(14)C]propionate and [U-(14)C]alanine, and oxidation were measured. A relative sparing of AA at the liver level was observed with the LN diet because of reduced urinary N (-42%, LN vs. control, P &lt; 0.001). The AA were also directed toward anabolic purposes in the LN diet via an increased endogenous and total export protein synthesis (+51%, LN vs. control, P = 0.01; also observed for fibrinogen synthesis, but not for albumin or transferrin) associated with a tendency for increased gluconeogenesis from alanine (+58%, LN vs. LE, P = 0.08). On the other hand, the LE diet resulted in a marked loss of N in urine (+24%, LE vs. control, P &lt; 0.05), but no notable effect of the LE diet was demonstrated for protein synthesis or gluconeogenesis ex vivo. These data demonstrate a more efficient utilization of AA for anabolic purposes in the lambs fed LN, probably via an activation of some AA transport systems, to address the shortage of nitrogenous nutrients in the LN diet. By contrast, no such adaptation occurred in the LE lambs, probably because the regulatory mechanisms that prevailed in this case were the nutrient supply or hormones, which were not altered in our ex vivo experimental model.",M1
19188866,"Physical compatibility of neonatal total parenteral nutrition admixtures containing organic calcium and inorganic phosphate salts in a simulated infusion at 37 degrees C.OBJECTIVE: Within an incubator environment at 37 degrees C, we evaluated the physical compatibility of calcium (Ca) and phosphate (P) in simulated neonatal total parenteral nutrition (TPN) infusions. DESIGN: Representative neonatal TPN formulas containing four concentrations of amino acids [<e>AA</e>] (1-4 g/dL) and two levels of dextrose [D] (5 and 10 g/dL) were monitored for calcium-phosphate precipitate formation over 24 hours using a laser-based particle counting technique. SETTING: Research Laboratory. SUBJECTS: None. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: Of the eight AA-D combinations studied, two formulas containing 1 g/dL AA with either 5 g/dL or 10 g/dL of D and high amounts of Ca and P resulted in significant increases in particle counts and visibly evident precipitation during the 24-hour infusion. Precipitation was noted only after the infusion passed through the incubator, but not in the TPN bags, demonstrating the heightened risk of calcium-phosphate incompatibility with increased temperatures. CONCLUSIONS: Low AA concentrations and high temperatures are significant risk factors for the precipitation of the insoluble dibasic calcium phosphate that may be fatal upon intravenous infusion. When thermoregulation is required, the AA concentration of the TPN formula should not be less than 1.5 g/dL (and ideally &gt; or =3 g/dL) when high intakes of calcium (60 mg/dL) and phosphate (46.5 mg/dL) are prescribed.",M1
19176630,"The region approximately between amino acids 81 and 137 of proteinase K-resistant PrPSc is critical for the infectivity of the Chandler prion strain.Although the major component of the prion is believed to be the oligomer of PrP(Sc), little information is available concerning regions on the PrP(Sc) molecule that affect prion infectivity. During the analysis of PrP(Sc) molecules from various prion strains, we found that PrP(Sc) of the Chandler strain showed a unique property in the conformational-stability assay, and this property appeared to be useful for studying the relationship between regions of the PrP(Sc) molecule and prion infectivity. Thus, we analyzed PrP(Sc) of the Chandler strain in detail and analyzed the infectivities of the N-terminally denatured and truncated forms of proteinase K-resistant PrP. The N-terminal region of PrP(Sc) of the Chandler strain showed region-dependent resistance to guanidine hydrochloride (GdnHCl) treatment. The region approximately between amino acids (<e>aa</e>) 81 and 137 began to be denatured by treatment with 1.5 M GdnHCl. Within this stretch, the region comprising approximately aa 81 to 90 was denatured almost completely by 2 M GdnHCl. Furthermore, the region approximately between aa 90 and 137 was denatured completely by 3 M GdnHCl. However, the C-terminal region thereafter was extremely resistant to the GdnHCl treatment. This property was not observed in PrP(Sc) molecules of other prion strains. Denaturation of the region between aa 81 and 137 by 3 M GdnHCl significantly prolonged the incubation periods in mice compared to that for the untreated control. More strikingly, the denaturation and removal of this region nearly abolished the infectivity. This finding suggests that the conformation of the region between aa 81 and 137 of the Chandler strain PrP(Sc) molecule is directly associated with prion infectivity.",M1
19161639,"Decreasing dietary particle size of lupins increases apparent ileal amino acid digestibility and alters fermentation characteristics in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs.Two experiments were conducted to examine the effects of lupin particle size on amino acid (<e>AA</e>) and energy digestibility and fermentation characteristics in pigs. Expt 1 examined the effects of lupin variety (cv. Tanjil and Mandelup) and lupin particle size (746, 888, 1099 and 1136 mum) on the total-tract apparent digestibility of dietary components in 63.5 (sd 7.28) kg pigs. While variety had no effect on total-tract apparent digestibility, decreasing particle size of lupins linearly increased total-tract apparent digestibility of crude protein of diets containing 350 g lupins per kg (P &lt; 0.01). Expt 2 examined the effect of lupin particle size (567, 995, 1198, 1250 and 1304 mum) on digestion and fermentation characteristics in 29.8 (sd 2.9) kg pigs. Pigs were fed the respective diets ad libitum for the first 2 weeks and fed at three times maintenance energy level in the third week. Pigs were euthanised under sedation at 46.7 (sd 4.21) kg to collect digesta samples along the intestinal tract. Decreasing particle size increased apparent ileal and total-tract digestible N (P &lt; 0.01) and the apparent and standardised ileal digestible AA content (P &lt; 0.05- &lt; 0.001) of lupins. Decreasing particle size of lupins linearly decreased the molar proportion of straight-chain volatile fatty acids (sum of acetic, propionic and butyric acids; VFAAPB), while branched-chain fatty acids (sum of valeric, caproic, isobutyric and isovaleric acids) were linearly increased (P &lt; 0.001). The results demonstrated that particle size of lupins is a critical factor influencing nutrient, especially AA, utilisation efficiency and fermentation characteristics in the gastrointestinal tract of pigs.",M1
19155585,"Enhancement of myofibrillar proteolysis following infusion of amino acid mixture correlates positively with elevation of core body temperature in rats.Administration of an amino acid (<e>AA</e>) mixture stimulates muscle protein synthesis and elevates core body temperature (T(b)), as characteristically found under anesthetic conditions. We tested the hypothesis that not only AA given, but also AA produced by degradation of endogenous muscular protein are provided for muscle protein synthesis, which is further reflected in T(b) modifications. Rats were intravenously administered an AA mixture or saline in combination with the anesthetic propofol or lipid emulsion. We measured plasma 3-methylhistidine (MeHis) concentrations as an index of myofibrillar protein degradation, rectal temperature and mRNA expression of atrogin-1, MuRF-1 and ubiquitin in gastrocnemius and soleus muscles of rats following 3 h infusion of test solutions. T(b) did not differ significantly between conscious groups, but was higher in the AA group than in the saline group among anesthetized rats. Plasma MeHis concentrations were higher in the AA group than in the saline group under both conditions. Plasma MeHis levels correlated positively with T(b) of rats under both conditions. AA administration decreased mRNA levels of atrogin-1 and ubiquitin in gastrocnemius muscle and all mRNA levels in soleus muscle. These results suggest that AA administration enhances myofibrillar protein degradation and that the change is a determinant of T(b) modification by AA administration. However, the mechanisms underlying AA administration-associated enhancement of myofibrillar proteolysis remains yet to be determined.",M1
19144214,"Ileal digestibility and endogenous flow of minerals and amino acids: responses to dietary phytic acid in piglets.Effects of phytic acid (PA) on ileal mineral and amino acid (<e>AA</e>) digestibilities and ileal endogenous AA flow in piglets were investigated. Seven ileal-cannulated weanling pigs were fed a casein-maize starch-based diet with PA (as sodium phytate) at 0, 5, 10 or 20 g/kg in 4 x 4 Latin square design with three added columns to give seven observations per treatment. The basal diet was formulated to meet National Research Council energy and AA requirements for piglets. The respective digestibility and endogenous lysine loss were determined by indicator and homoarginine methods. The apparent ileal digestibility (AID) of Na, K and P was linearly and quadratically reduced (P &lt; 0.05) by increased dietary PA concentration, whereas that of Ca and Mg was only linearly reduced (P &lt; 0.05) by the dietary PA. The AID values for Mg and Na were negative ( - 0.03 and - 0.18, respectively) when PA was supplemented at 20 g/kg. The AID of isoleucine, leucine and valine responded quadratically to dietary PA concentration, though the differences between the AID values of the AA due to change in dietary PA concentration were marginal (at most by 1.8 percentage units). Furthermore, dietary PA did not affect (P&gt;0.05) endogenous AA losses. The results suggest that PA has limited effect on the digestibility and endogenous losses of AA in piglets, but can reduce AID of Mg and Na partly by increasing endogenous losses of these minerals as evidenced by their negative AID values.",M1
19581057,"Development and validation of the Alcoholics Anonymous Intention Measure (AAIM).BACKGROUND: Drop-out from 12-step groups is notoriously high, yet the field lacks strong models and scales for addressing this problem. We aim to determine whether the theory of planned behavior (TPB) can be applied to 12-step involvement, and to develop and validate a scale of 12-step readiness based on that theory: the Alcoholics Anonymous Intention Measure (AAIM). METHOD: Data were from a longitudinal trial of a manual-guided 12-step facilitation intervention called Making <e>AA</e> Easier (MAAEZ) involving two treatment programs in California (N=508). Participants completed surveys at baseline, 7 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months. Surveys included the preliminary AAIM, a 12-step involvement measure, other readiness measures, and substance use outcomes. RESULTS: The final, 17-item AAIM measured Attitude (5-item alpha's=.75-.83), Subjective Norm (4-item alpha's=.56-.81), Perceived Control (5-item alpha's=.78-.85), and Intention (3-item alpha's=.80-.95) regarding attendance at 12-step groups. Components were correlated with each other and other readiness measures as expected, supporting the AAIM's validity. Scale components predicted 31% of the variance in Intention to attend 12-step groups at 6 months and 41% of the variance in 12-step involvement at 12 months. Social factors were among the strongest predictors of 12-step involvement. Results did not support the expectancy-value formulation of the TPB, as unweighted (vs. weighted) belief items performed optimally. CONCLUSIONS: Results generally support the TPB as a model of 12-step involvement and suggest specific targets for 12-step facilitation interventions within attitude, norm, and control components. Findings also support the AAIM as a tool for identifying drop-out risks and tailoring individual interventions.",M2
19457623,"Using propensity scores to adjust for selection bias when assessing the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous in observational studies.BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) is difficult to establish. Observational studies consistently find strong dose-response relationships between AA meeting attendance and abstinence, and the only experimental studies favoring AA have been of 12-step facilitation treatment rather than of AA per se. Pending future randomized trials, this paper uses propensity score (PS) method to address the selection bias that potentially confounds the effect of AA in observational studies. METHOD: The study followed a treatment sample for 1 year to assess post-treatment AA attendance and abstinence (n=569). Propensity scores were constructed based on known confounders including motivation, problem severity, and prior help-seeking. AA attendance during the 12-month follow-up period was studied as a predictor of alcohol abstinence for 30 days prior to the follow-up interview. PS stratification and PS matching techniques were used to adjust for the self-select bias associated with respondents' propensity to attend AA. RESULTS: The overall advantage in abstinence initially observed narrowed when adjusted. The odds ratio associated with AA attendance reduced from 3.6 to 3.0 after PS stratification and 2.6 after PS matching to AA-attenders. Support for AA effectiveness was strengthened in the quintile with lower propensity scores and when AA-nonattenders were matched as the target group, but was weakened among those in the higher PS quintiles and when matching to AA-attenders. DISCUSSION: These results confirm the robustness of AA effectiveness overall, because the results for higher abstinence associated with AA attendance following propensity score adjustment remained significant, and the reduction in the magnitude of AA's effect was moderate. However, the effect modification by propensity scores in both PS stratification and PS matching approaches seems to suggest that AA may be most helpful, or matter more, for those with a lower propensity to attend AA. Conversely, for those with a high propensity to go to AA (operationalized as higher motivation, greater problem severity, more prior AA and treatment exposure, etc.), attending AA may not make as much of a difference. It will be important that future studies replicate our results, as this is the first paper to use propensity score adjustment in this context.",M2
19446963,"Gender differences in 16-year trends in assault- and police-related problems due to drinking.This study examined the frequency and predictors of physical assault and having trouble with the police due to drinking over 16 years among women and men who, at baseline, were untreated for their alcohol use disorder. Predictors examined were the personal characteristics of impulsivity, self-efficacy, and problem-solving and emotional-discharge coping, as well as outpatient treatment and Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) participation. Women and men were similar on rates of perpetrating assault due to drinking, but men were more likely to have had trouble with the police due to drinking. Respondents who, at baseline, were more impulsive and relied more on emotional discharge coping, and less on problem-solving coping, assaulted others more frequently during the first year of follow-up. Similarly, less problem-solving coping at baseline was related to having had trouble with the police more often at one and 16 years due to drinking. The association between impulsivity and more frequent assault was stronger for women, whereas associations of self-efficacy and problem-solving coping with less frequent assault and police trouble were stronger for men. Participation in AA was also associated with a lower likelihood of having trouble with the police at one year, especially for men. Interventions aimed at decreasing impulsivity and emotional discharge coping, and bolstering self-efficacy and problem-solving coping, during substance abuse treatment, and encouragement to become involved in AA, may be helpful in reducing assaultive and other illegal behaviors.",M2
19340677,"Alcoholics anonymous effectiveness: faith meets science.Research on the effectiveness of Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) is controversial and subject to widely divergent interpretations. The goal of this article is to provide a focused review of the literature on AA effectiveness that will allow readers to judge the evidence effectiveness of AA for themselves. The review organizes the research on AA effectiveness according to six criterion required for establishing causation: (1) magnitude of effect; (2) dose response effect; (3) consistent effect; (4) temporally accurate effects; (5) specific effects; (6) plausibility. The evidence for criteria 1- 4 and 6 is strong: rates of abstinence are about twice as high among those who attend AA (criteria 1, magnitude); higher levels of attendance are related to higher rates of abstinence (criteria 2, dose-response); these relationships are found for different samples and follow-up periods (criteria 3, consistency); prior AA attendance is predictive of subsequent abstinence (criteria 4, temporal); and mechanisms of action predicted by theories of behavior change are present in AA (criteria 6, plausibility). However, rigorous experimental evidence establishing the specificity of an effect for AA or Twelve Step Facilitation/TSF (criteria 5) is mixed, with 2 trials finding a positive effect for AA, 1 trial finding a negative effect for AA, and 1 trial finding a null effect. Studies addressing specificity using statistical approaches have had two contradictory findings, and two that reported significant effects for AA after adjusting for potential confounders such as motivation to change.",M2
19339148,"Effectiveness of Making Alcoholics Anonymous Easier: a group format 12-step facilitation approach.Most treatment programs recommend clients attend 12-step groups, but many drop out posttreatment. The effectiveness of Making Alcoholics Anonymous [<e>AA</e>] Easier (MAAEZ ), a manual-guided intervention designed to help clients connect with individuals encountered in AA, was tested using an  OFF/ON  design (n = 508). MAAEZ effectiveness was determined by comparing abstinence rates of participants recruited during ON and OFF conditions and by studying the effect of the number of MAAEZ sessions attended. At 12 months, more clients in the ON condition (vs. OFF) reported past 30-day abstinence from alcohol (p = .012), drugs (p = .009), and both alcohol and drugs (p = .045). In multivariate analyses, ON condition participants had significantly increased odds of abstinence from alcohol (odds ratio [OR] = 1.85) and from drugs (OR = 2.21); abstinence odds also increased significantly for each additional MAAEZ session received. MAAEZ appeared especially effective for those with more prior AA exposure, severe psychiatric problems, and atheists/agnostics. MAAEZ represents an evidence-based intervention that is easily implemented in existing treatment programs.",M2
19309183,"Changing network support for drinking: network support project 2-year follow-up.The Network Support Project was designed to determine whether a treatment could lead patients to change their social network from one that supports drinking to one that supports sobriety. This study reports 2-year posttreatment outcomes. Alcohol-dependent men and women (N = 210) were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 outpatient treatment conditions: network support (NS), network support + contingency management (NS + CM), or case management (CaseM, a control condition). Analysis of drinking rates indicated that the NS condition yielded up to 20% more days abstinent than the other conditions at 2 years posttreatment. NS treatment also resulted in greater increases at 15 months in social network support for abstinence, as well as in <e>AA</e> attendance and AA involvement than did the other conditions. Latent growth modeling suggested that social network changes were accompanied by increases in self-efficacy and coping that were strongly predictive of long-term drinking outcomes. The findings indicate that a network support treatment can effect long-term adaptive changes in drinkers' social networks and that these changes contribute to improved drinking outcomes in the long term.",M2
19297380,"The role of <e>AA</e> sponsors: a pilot study.AIMS: The aim of this study was to explore the roles of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) sponsors and to describe the characteristics of a sample of sponsors. METHODS: Twenty-eight AA sponsors, recruited using a purposive sampling method, were administered an unstructured qualitative interview and standardized questionnaires. The measurements included: a content analysis of sponsors' responses; Severity of Alcohol Dependence Questionnaire-Community version (SADQ-C) and Alcoholics Anonymous Affiliation Scale (AAAS). RESULTS: Sample characteristics were as follows: the median length of AA attendance was 9.5 years (range 5-28); the median length of sobriety was 11 years (range 4.5-28); the median number of sponsees per sponsor was 1 but there was a wide range (0-17, interquartile range 3.75); and the sponsors were highly affiliated to AA (median AAAS score 8.75, range 5.5-8.75, maximum possible score 9). Past alcohol dependence scores were surprisingly low: 5 (18%) sponsors had mild, 14 (50%) moderate and 9 (32%) severe dependence according to the SADQ-C (median 26.5, range 11-56). Sponsorship roles were as follows: 16 roles were identified through the initial content analysis. These were distilled into three super-ordinate roles through a thematic analysis: (1) encouraging sponsees to work the programme of AA (doing the 12 steps and engaging in AA activity); (2) support (regular contact, emotional support and practical support); and (3) carrying the message of AA (sharing sponsor's personal experience of recovery with sponsees). CONCLUSIONS: The roles identified broadly corresponded with the AA literature delineating the duties of a sponsor. This non-random sample of sponsors was highly engaged in AA activity but only had a past history of moderate alcohol dependence.",M2

DESIGN: Randomized controlled trial with assessments at baseline, end of treatment and 3, 6, 9 and 12 months after treatment. PARTICIPANTS, SETTING AND INTERVENTION: A total of 169 alcoholic out-patients (57 women) assigned randomly to one of three conditions: a directive approach to facilitating AA, a motivational enhancement approach to facilitating AA or treatment as usual, with no special emphasis on AA. MEASUREMENTS: Self-report of AA meeting attendance and involvement, alcohol consumption (percentage of days abstinent, percentage of days heavy drinking) and negative alcohol consequences. FINDINGS: Participants exposed to the 12-Step directive condition for facilitating AA involvement reported more AA meeting attendance, more evidence of active involvement in AA and a higher percentage of days abstinent relative to participants in the treatment-as-usual comparison group. Evidence also suggested that the effect of the directive strategy on abstinent days was mediated partially through AA involvement. The motivational enhancement approach to facilitating AA had no effect on outcome measures. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that treatment providers can use a 12-Step-based directive approach to effectively facilitate involvement in AA and thereby improve client outcome.",M2
19187818,"Identification with mainstream culture and preference for alternative alcohol treatment approaches in a community sample.Although various treatment approaches are available for alcohol problems, less than 25% of individuals with alcohol use disorders obtain treatment. The purpose of this study is to evaluate interest in attending alternative alcohol treatments, such as meditation and acupuncture, compared to Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>). A community sample of 156 adult participants concerned about their drinking were recruited through flyers and newspaper advertisements to complete a Web-based survey assessing identification with mainstream culture, sexual identity, and likelihood to attend alternative alcohol treatments. Participants reported higher likelihood of attending alternative treatments as compared to AA, and lesbian, gay, and bisexual participants (28.2% of the sample) were more likely to attend alternative treatments than heterosexual participants. A series of regression analyses were conducted to test whether the relationship between sexual identity and likelihood to attend alternative treatments was mediated by identification with mainstream culture. Participants who were less strongly identified with mainstream culture, regardless of sexual identity, reported higher likelihood of attending alternative treatments. These findings highlight that, for certain subgroups of the population, alternative treatments for alcohol misuse are appealing and suggest the need for future research testing the efficacy of alternative treatments for alcohol problems.",M2

METHOD: Data were derived from Project MATCH (Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity), a longitudinal investigation of the efficacy of three behavioral treatments for alcohol abuse and dependence. Cox proportional hazard regressions were performed to determine the extent to which demographic, clinical, belief, and AA factors predicted initial AA-related helping. RESULTS: Demographic characteristics, drinking severity, antisocial personality, and purpose in life were not associated with initial AA-related helping. Increased self-efficacy, faith-based practices, meeting attendance, number of steps worked, having a sponsor, and length of sobriety predicted initial AA-related helping. Alcoholics reported elevated depressive symptoms before initial AA-related helping, lowered depressive symptoms at the start of AA-related helping, and similarly lowered depressive symptoms in the interval following initial AA-related helping. CONCLUSIONS: The profile of prospective helpers in AA is not limited to alcoholics from certain backgrounds or higher functioning in terms of drinking or clinical severity. To increase participation in AA-related helping, and hence outcomes, results suggest strengthening self-efficacy and progress in other AA programmatic components.",M2

Although many patients choose to attend <e>AA</e> of their own accord, clinicians' facilitation of AA involvement ( Twelve-Step Facilitation  [TSF]) has shown to substantially increase the likelihood that patients will become engaged with these freely available resources. Importantly, many individuals with alcohol dependence never seek help from addiction specialists, yet often encounter other health professionals due to alcohol-related physical or psychological problems providing an opportunity for intervention. However, for clinicians who do not specialize in addiction treatment, knowledge about what AA actually is and does is often lacking, and confidence in implementing TSF strategies is low. This chapter provides essential information for clinicians working in non-specialty settings who have little knowledge of, or experience with, AA or TSF, but who may wish to utilize proven strategies to augment existing interventions by helping educate, link, and engage patients with AA. Detailed information on the origins and specific elements of AA is provided along with recommended TSF approaches and strategies to aid the non-specialist in building effective interventions for patients with alcohol dependence.",M2

We consider demographics (gender, age, ethnicity, marital status), receipt of specialty treatment, and short- and long-term abstinence rates among these AA exposure groups. Results suggest stability in the representation of women and minorities among the AA membership, but a decline among youth. Fully one-half of those completing AA's most recent membership survey reported that they had been abstinent for more than 5 years. Those receiving specialty treatment any given year are likely to report AA exposure that year. Disengagement from AA does not appear to necessarily translate to loss of abstinence among those with initial high levels of AA exposure, but long-term abstinence is more likely among those with continued engagement.",M2
19115770,"Spirituality and health: empirically based reflections on recovery.In this chapter, we explore the spiritual functioning and well-being of individuals and how this relates to mental health and recovery from alcoholism within the conceptual framework of Alcoholics Anonymous. We raise the question of whether the spiritually oriented focus of <e>AA</e> is a critical factor in achieving recovery. We suggest that examining the findings from a large body of research on religion and mental health may provide further insight into this question. Specifically, we assert that the mechanisms through which the spiritual focus of AA may influence recovery from alcoholism may be similar to the mechanisms through which spirituality may influence mental health. These potential explanatory mechanisms include the provision of a community, a narrative framework for meaning-making, a means of coping through submission and redemption, and prescribed lifestyle behaviors.",M2
19115768,"Kickbacks from helping others: health and recovery.<e>AA</e> is often viewed as a spiritual organization, but it is less commonly recognized that helping others is a fundamental part of AA's conception of spirituality. Helping others by bringing AA's program to other alcoholics (articulated in Step 12) is understood as the culmination of AA's program and the behavioral manifestation of a spiritual awakening (Step 11). Also, members are encouraged to help in all stages of their involvement in AA's, and it is this helping that is thought to keep them sober. Accordingly, the current chapter addresses the question of whether helping benefits the helper from an empirical standpoint-and specifically, whether helping might contribute to recovery in the context of AA involvement. In addition to describing AA's approach to helping, we review research on associations between helping and (a) health outcomes in the general population, (b) recovery in diverse mutual help groups, and (c) recovery from chemical dependency within and outside of AA. We find evidence supporting benefits for helpers in each of these domains and tentatively conclude in favor of helper therapy principles. However, the work is limited by the lack of experimental studies and by problems in defining helping. Other concerns are that  over-helping  can be worse than not helping at all and that helping may sometimes harm the intended recipients. Recommendations for further research are to address these limitations. Particularly useful would be research designing and testing interventions aiming to increase helping, perhaps informed by social model programs and principles.",M2

Known as  social model recovery,  these programs were staffed by individuals in recovery and they encouraged program participants to become involved in AA as a way to address their drinking problems. In addition, they relied on the traditions, beliefs, and recovery practices of AA as a guide for managing and operating programs (e.g., democratic group processes, shared and rotated leadership, and experiential knowledge). This chapter reviews the philosophy, history, and recent changes in several types of these programs, along with a depiction of AA's influence on them. Programs examined include neighborhood recovery centers, residential social model recovery programs, and two types of sober living houses: California Sober Living Houses and Oxford Houses.

19115763,"The impact of <e>AA</e> on professional treatment.Several forces combined in the 1950s to profoundly change the way alcoholism was treated in the United States. Anderson, Bradley, and Hazelden staff combined strategies to revolutionize alcoholism treatment across the spectrum of social rehabilitation services and hospital-based care. Prevailing psychiatric services, heavily influenced by psychoanalytic practices, were abandoned in favor of an emphasis on patient education, therapeutic group process, peer interaction, and the development of life-long support systems through AA. The addition of the alcoholism counselors, many of whom were recovering AA members, was a key ingredient in aligning a closely identified professional with the alcoholic to foster integration of Twelve Step principles and practices in everyday life. Dignity, respect, and hope for recovery became the cornerstone of the Minnesota/Hazelden Model. The resulting treatment model is recognized as an effective, evidence-based approach for alcohol and drug dependence. One of the strongest commendatory statements has come from the staff of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism who, in a report to the U.S. Congress, identified Twelve Step-based professional treatment as effective as other approaches and a model that  ...may actually achieve more sustained abstinence  (2000, p. 448). Clearly, AA's impact on professional treatment cannot be underestimated. Perhaps Dan Anderson summarized it best:  Without the initial and sustaining impetus of [AA], none of our treatment efforts could have been realized  (Anderson, 1981, p. 3).",M2

19115761,"The twelve-step recovery model of <e>AA</e>: a voluntary mutual help association.Alcoholism treatment has evolved to mean professionalized, scientifically based rehabilitation. Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) is not a treatment method; it is far better understood as a Twelve-Step Recovery Program within a voluntary self-help/mutual aid organization of self-defined alcoholics. The Twelve-Step Recovery Model is elaborated in three sections, patterned on the AA logo (a triangle within a circle): The triangle's legs represent recovery, service, and unity; the circle represents the reinforcing effect of the three legs upon each other as well as the  technology  of the sharing circle and the fellowship. The first leg of the triangle, recovery, refers to the journey of individuals to abstinence and a new  way of living.  The second leg, service, refers to helping other alcoholics which also connects the participants into a fellowship. The third leg, unity, refers to the fellowship of recovering alcoholics, their groups, and organizations. The distinctive AA organizational structure of an inverted pyramid is one in which the members in autonomous local groups direct input to the national service bodies creating a democratic, egalitarian organization maximizing recovery. Analysts describe the AA recovery program as complex, implicitly grounded in sound psychological principles, and more sophisticated than is typically understood. AA provides a nonmedicalized and anonymous  way of living  in the community and should probably be referred to as the Twelve-Step/Twelve Tradition Recovery Model in order to clearly differentiate it from professionally based twelve-step treatments.

Evidence suggests some youth benefit, yet, despite referrals, youth participation is low. Little is known about adolescents' experiences of AA/NA. Greater knowledge would inform and help tailor aftercare recommendations. METHOD: Two clinical samples of youth (N = 74 and N= 377) were asked about their perceptions of, and experiences with, AA/NA with responses categorized by content into domains assessed for face validity and reliability. RESULTS: The aspects of AA/NA youth liked best were general group dynamic processes related to universality, support, and instillation of hope. The most common reason for discontinuing was boredom/lack of fit. CONCLUSIONS: General group-therapeutic, and not 12-step-specific, factors are most valued by youth during early stages of recovery and/or degree of AA/NA exposure. Many youth discontinue due to a perceived lack of fit, suggesting a mismatch between some youth and aspects of AA/NA.",M2
18657129,"Coffee and cigarette consumption and perceived effects in recovering alcoholics participating in Alcoholics Anonymous in Nashville, Tennessee, USA.BACKGROUND: Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) members represent an important and relatively understudied population for improving our understanding of alcohol dependence recovery as over 1 million Americans participate in the program. Further insight into coffee and cigarette use by these individuals is necessary given AA members' apparent widespread consumption and the recognized health consequences and psychopharmacological actions of these substances. METHODS: Volunteers were sought from all open-AA meetings in Nashville, TN during the summer of 2007 to complete a questionnaire (n = 289, completion rate = 94.1%) including timeline followback for coffee, cigarette, and alcohol consumption; the Alcoholics Anonymous Affiliation Scale; coffee consumption and effects questions; the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND); and the Smoking Effects Questionnaire. RESULTS: Mean (+/-SD) age of onset of alcohol consumption was 15.4 +/- 4.2 years and mean lifetime alcohol consumption was 1026.0 +/- 772.8 kg ethanol. Median declared alcohol abstinence was 2.1 years (range: 0 days to 41.1 years) and median lifetime AA attendance was 1000.0 meetings (range: 4 to 44,209 meetings); average AA affiliation score was 7.6 +/- 1.5. Most (88.5%) individuals consumed coffee and approximately 33% of coffee consumers drank more than 4 cups per day (M = 3.9 +/- 3.9). The most common self-reported reasons for coffee consumption and coffee-associated behavioral changes were related to stimulatory effects. More than half (56.9%) of individuals in AA smoked cigarettes. Of those who smoked, 78.7% consumed at least half a pack of cigarettes per day (M = 21.8 +/- 12.3). Smokers' FTND scores were 5.8 +/- 2.4; over 60% of smokers were highly or very highly dependent. Reduced negative affect was the most important subjective effect of smoking. CONCLUSIONS: A greater proportion of AA participants drink coffee and smoke cigarettes in larger per capita amounts than observed in general U.S. populations. The effects of these products as described by AA participants suggest significant stimulation and negative affect reduction. Fundamental knowledge of the quantitative and qualitative aspects of coffee and cigarette consumption among AA members will enable future research to discern their impact on alcohol abstinence and recovery.",M2
18557829,"Social recovery model: an 8-year investigation of adolescent 12-step group involvement following inpatient treatment.BACKGROUND: Despite widespread use of 12-step treatment approaches and referrals to Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA) by youth providers, little is known about the significance of these organizations in youth addiction recovery. Furthermore, existing evidence is based mostly on short-term follow-up and is limited methodologically. METHODS: Adolescent inpatients (n = 160; mean age = 16, 40% female) were followed at 6-months, and at 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 years posttreatment. Time-lagged, generalized estimating equations modeled treatment outcome in relation to AA/NA attendance controlling for static and time-varying covariates. Robust regression (locally weighted scatterplot smoothing) explored dose-response thresholds of AA/NA attendance on outcome. RESULTS: The AA/NA attendance was common and intensive early posttreatment, but declined sharply and steadily over the 8-year period. Patients with greater addiction severity and those who believed that they could not use substances in moderation were more likely to attend. Despite declining attendance, the effects related to AA/NA remained significant and consistent. Greater early participation was associated with better long-term outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Even though many youth discontinue AA/NA over time, attendees appear to benefit, and more severely substance-involved youth attend most. Successful early posttreatment engagement of youth in abstinence-supportive social contexts, such as AA/NA, may have long-term implications for alcohol and drug involvement into young adulthood.",M2

METHOD: We examined the impact of per capita consumption of total alcohol, spirits, beer, and wine; unemployment rate; and Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) membership rate on total, male and female suicide mortality rates in Manitoba during 1976 to 1997. Time series analyses with autoregressive integrated moving average modelling were applied to total, male and female suicide rates. The analyses performed included total alcohol consumption, spirits consumption, beer consumption, and wine consumption. Missing AA membership data were interpolated with cubic splines. RESULTS: Total alcohol consumption, and consumption of beer, spirits, and wine individually, were significantly and positively related to female suicide mortality rates. Spirits and wine were positively related to total and male mortality rates. AA membership rates were negatively related to total and female suicide rates. Unemployment rates were positively related to male and total suicide rates. CONCLUSIONS: The data confirm the important relations between per capita consumption measures and suicide mortality rates. Additionally, the results for AA membership rates are consistent with the hypothesis that AA membership and alcohol abuse treatment can exert beneficial effects observable at the population level.",M2

DESIGN: The MacArthur model was applied in this naturalistic study to identify how baseline, discharge and 1-year follow-up factors worked together to predict 4-year improvement in substance-related problems. SETTING: Eighty-eight community residential facilities were selected based on geographic representativeness, number of patient referrals and type of treatment orientation. PARTICIPANTS: Of 2796 male patients who completed intake assessments, 2324 were assessed at the 1-year follow-up and 2023 at the 4-year follow-up. MEASUREMENTS: Self-report measures of symptom severity, functioning, social resources and coping, treatment and involvement in Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) were collected at baseline and at 1- and 4-year follow-ups. Provider-rated treatment participation measures were obtained at discharge. FINDINGS: Greater substance use severity, more psychiatric symptoms, more prior arrests and stronger belief in AA-related philosophy at treatment entry predicted improvement significantly in substance-related problems 4 years later. At the 1-year follow-up, being employed and greater use of AA-related coping predicted outcome significantly. AA-related coping at 1 year mediated the relationship partially between belief in AA philosophy at treatment entry and 4-year outcome. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the unique and positive impact of AA involvement on long-term SUD treatment outcome and extend understanding of why AA is beneficial for patients.",M2

The SCID-I and a questionnaire focusing on patient relationship with AA groups were used. The responses obtained through the questionnaire were independently evaluated by two researchers. AA adherence was below 20%. The main factors reported by patients as reasons for non-adherence to AA were relapse, lack of identification with the method, lack of need, and lack of credibility. The factors reported by patients as reasons for adherence were identification with the method and a way to avoid relapse. Although AA is considered an effective intervention for alcoholism, its adherence rate was excessively low. The identification of these nonadherence factors could help health professionals in referring certain alcoholic patients to therapeutic interventions other than AA.",M2
18201015,"Experiences of alcohol dependence: a qualitative study.INTRODUCTION AND AIMS OF THE STUDY: Despite the increasing incidence of alcohol misuse and the costs it incurs, British society continues to hold equivocal and ambiguous attitudes towards drinking, and understanding of the nature of alcohol dependence and related issues is limited. This qualitative study aimed to investigate the experiences of individuals with alcohol dependence to enhance understanding of the illness, identify key issues and common themes and provide insight into the experiences of the participants during their alcohol dependent period and recovery. METHOD: A qualitative approach, using narrative method, was used. Eight participants, all members of Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>), were interviewed by the researchers. Using a grounded theory approach and content analysis, the in-depth narratives of the eight participants were systematically analysed. RESULTS: While participants continued to deny the existence of a problem to those around them, their behaviours indicated that they were aware of the problem but were afraid to admit it openly through fear of other people's reactions. Participants generally regarded GPs as helpful but other health professionals less so, especially nurses and Accident and Emergency staff. Participants considered that the success of treatment depended on their own motivation and willingness to engage in radical behaviour change. They considered that reaching this stage represented a turning point in their illness. The point at which this stage was reached appeared to be different for each participant. CONCLUSIONS: This systematic analysis of a small sample of alcohol dependent individuals gives insight into their experiences during alcohol dependency and the journey to recovery. The findings suggest that denial of the problem to the outside world occurs simultaneously with individuals being aware of their problem. Participants felt the illness carries a stigma and their negative experiences of health professionals other than GPs suggests that nurses and other health workers need to revise their understanding of alcohol dependence and their approach to it. AA was a significant factor in recovery for these participants.",M2
18159779,"Adolescents' participation in Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous: review, implications and future directions.Youth treatment programs frequently employ 12-Step concepts and encourage participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA). Since AA/NA groups are easily accessible at no charge and provide flexible support at times of high relapse risk they hold promise as a treatment adjunct in an increasingly cost-constricting economic climate. Yet, due to concerns related to adolescents' developmental status, skepticism exists regarding the utility of AA/NA for youth. This review evaluates the empirical evidence in this regard, identifies and discusses knowledge gaps, and recommends areas for future research. Searches were conducted in PsychINFO, Medline, relevant literature and by personal correspondence. Findings suggest youth may benefit from AA/NA participation following treatment, but conclusions are limited by four important factors: (1) a small number of studies; (2) no studies with outpatients; (3) existing evidence is solely observational; and (4) only partial measurement of the 12-Step construct. While surveys of adolescent SUD treatment programs indicate widespread clinical interest and application of adult-derived 12-Step approaches this level of enthusiasm has not been reflected in the research community. Qualitative research is needed to improve our understanding of youth-specific AA/NA barriers, and efficacy, comparative effectiveness, and process studies are still needed to inform clinical practice guidelines for youth providers.",M2

Predictors of self-efficacy at 1 year included improvement from baseline to 1 year in heavy drinking, alcohol-related problems, depression, impulsivity, avoidance coping, social support from friends, and longer duration of participation in Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>). Female gender, more education, less change in substance use problems, and impulsivity during the first year predicted improvement in self-efficacy over 16 years. Clinicians should focus on keeping patients engaged in AA, addressing depressive symptoms, improving patient's coping, and enhancing social support during the first year and reduce the risk of relapse by monitoring individuals whose alcohol problems and impulsivity improve unusually quickly.",M2
18028521,"Attendance at Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, frequency of attendance and substance use outcomes after residential treatment for drug dependence: a 5-year follow-up study.AIMS: This study investigates the relationship between frequency of attendance at Narcotics Anonymous and Alcoholics Anonymous (NA/<e>AA</e>) meetings and substance use outcomes after residential treatment of drug dependence. It was predicted that post-treatment NA/AA attendance would be related to improved substance use outcomes. METHODS: Using a longitudinal, prospective cohort design, interviews were conducted with drug-dependent clients (n = 142) at intake to residential treatment, and at 1 year, 2 years and 4-5 years follow-up. Data were collected by structured interviews. All follow-up interviews were carried out by independent professional interviewers. FINDINGS: Abstinence from opiates was increased throughout the 5-year follow-up period compared to pre-treatment levels. Clients who attended NA/AA after treatment were more likely to be abstinent from opiates at follow-up. Abstinence from stimulants increased at follow-up but (except at 1-year follow-up) no additional benefit was found for NA/AA attendance. There was no overall change in alcohol abstinence after treatment but clients who attended NA/AA were more likely to be abstinent from alcohol at all follow-up points. More frequent NA/AA attenders were more likely to be abstinent from opiates and alcohol when compared both to non-attenders and to infrequent (less than weekly) attenders. CONCLUSIONS: NA/AA can support and supplement residential addiction treatment as an aftercare resource. In view of the generally poor alcohol use outcomes achieved by drug-dependent patients after treatment, the improved alcohol outcomes of NA/AA attenders suggests that the effectiveness of existing treatment services may be improved by initiatives that lead to increased involvement and engagement with such groups.",M2

17934994,"A brief scale for measuring helping activities in recovery: the brief helper therapy scale.BACKGROUND: Helping others is evident in the philosophy of Alcoholics Anonymous, and is emphasized in formal treatment. However, helping among recovering alcoholics has not been studied, in part because of a lack of helping measures. METHODS: This study developed a Brief Helper Therapy Scale to capture helping among individuals with varying lengths of recovery. The 26-item long version of the Helper Therapy Scale was developed from qualitative interviews (n = 21) and item analysis of responses from 200 recovering alcoholics with differing lengths of recovery. Three subscales assessed Recovery, Life, and Community Helping. This brief version was created using an iterative process of item analysis designed to yield good internal consistency and representation of different types of helping. Helping was assessed as a continuous measure of how much time had been spent on each activity in the past week. RESULTS: The resulting 9-item Brief Helper Therapy Scale demonstrated strong internal consistency (alpha = 0.83), but did not correlate well with psychological and spirituality measures used to assess construct validity. The Brief Helper Therapy Scale can be completed in about 5 minutes. Those in early recovery reported move involvement in recovery helping, with service in <e>AA</e> a notable exception. Those with the longest recovery focused more on community helping. CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that persons more stable in recovery move beyond a singular focus on recovery helping and demonstrate that people in recovery do contribute to society - potentially dispelling some of the stigma associated with alcoholism.",M2
17889297,"Spirituality and recovery in 12-step programs: an empirical model.Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) and other 12-step programs are widely employed in the addiction rehabilitation community. It is therefore important for researchers and clinicians to have a better understanding of how recovery from addiction takes place, in terms of psychological mechanisms associated with spiritual renewal. A program like AA is described here as a spiritual recovery movement, that is, one that effects compliance with its behavioral norms by engaging recruits in a social system that promotes new and transcendent meaning in their lives. The mechanisms underlying the attribution of new meaning in AA are considered by recourse to the models of positive psychology and social network support; both models have been found to be associated with constructive health outcomes in a variety of contexts. By drawing on available empirical research, it is possible to define the diagnosis of addiction and the criteria for recovery in spiritually oriented terms.",M2
17719158,"Social network variables in alcoholics anonymous: a literature review.Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) is the most commonly used program for substance abuse recovery and one of the few models to demonstrate positive abstinence outcomes. Although little is known regarding the underlying mechanisms that make this program effective, one frequently cited aspect is social support. In order to gain insight into the processes at work in AA, this paper reviewed 24 papers examining the relationship between AA and social network variables. Various types of social support were included in the review such as structural support, functional support, general support, alcohol-specific support, and recovery helping. Overall, this review found that AA involvement is related to a variety of positive qualitative and quantitative changes in social support networks. Although AA had the greatest impact on friend networks, it had less influence on networks consisting of family members or others. In addition, support from others in AA was found to be of great value to recovery, and individuals with harmful social networks supportive of drinking actually benefited the most from AA involvement. Furthermore, social support variables consistently mediated AA's impact on abstinence, suggesting that social support is a mechanism in the effectiveness of AA in promoting a sober lifestyle. Recommendations are made for future research and clinical practice.",M2
17644932," Their lack of masculine security and aggression was obvious : gender and the medicalization of inebriety in the United States, 1930-50.This article examines the roles of gender and sexuality in the public and private debate over medicalizing inebriety in the United States from 1930-50. During this period various interest groups wrestled with two competing visions of how to frame chronic drinking, which came to be labelled alcoholism following the repeal of Prohibition. Mainstream doctors and psychiatrists agreed that the underlying cause of alcoholism was in the mind of the individual. A number of psychiatrists went further, suggesting a connection between alcoholism and latent homosexuality. In contrast, laypeople identifying themselves as alcoholics advanced a second, competing vision of alcoholism that framed it as a blameless physiological illness. This second understanding of alcoholism, particularly as promoted by members of Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>), emphasized the need for restoring heteronormative gender roles for alcoholics (who were generally men) and their spouses (who were generally women) as an important step to recovery. Indeed, this may help to explain the success of AA and its medicalization model in the US from 1930-50, as both built upon widely held cultural assumptions concerning gender roles and sexuality.",M2

METHODS: Archival research, drawing mainly on primary sources in AA archives in New York and Dublin. RESULTS: Anticipated tensions between this fellowship, which had its roots in Evangelical Protestantism, and the politically powerful Roman Catholic Church in Ireland were skillfully avoided; initial hostility from the medical profession quickly dissipated; and AA distanced itself from policy debate on the wider topic of alcoholism as disease.

17458422,"Helping as healing among recovering alcoholics.Several avenues remain open for future research. Perhaps most important, experimental research manipulating peer helping activities is needed to confirm and extend the conclusions offered here. As suggested previously, the correlational evidence linking helping to better recovery outcomes is subject to valid critique based on the possibility of third-variable associations, so experimental studies manipulating helping are indispensable to demonstrating a causal role for peer helping (and to ruling out reverse causality). Future research will also be important in identifying what forms of helping work best, and when. The Zemore and Kaskutas (2004) study described earlier uncovered some rather complex associations between length of recovery and helping in specific life domains: longer recovery was positively associated with community-oriented helping, negatively associated with recovery-oriented helping (outside of <e>AA</e> participation), and not associated with level of life helping. These results hint that, over time, recovering alcoholics may naturally transition from helping activities associated primarily with alcohol problems to helping activities concerned with the broader community--and that there may be some value to this transition. What works for a recovering alcoholic early in recovery may not work later in recovery. Further research is needed to explore how length of sobriety, type of helping, and other variables interact to affect the impact of helping activities on recovery outcomes. Another exciting question for further research will be why helping helps the helper. It has been suggested that helping enhances helpers' self-perceptions of independence, competence, usefulness, and/or social status; fosters relationships with others; and diverts helpers from excessive self-absorption. Some have argued that helping others contributes to building and expressing a positive identity. Cooperation may even be inherently rewarding. A recent study found that, when women cooperated (versus competed) in a Prisoner's Dilemma game, blood flow increased in areas of their brains rich in dopamine, the neurotransmitter involved in reward systems and famed in part for its role in addictive behaviors. Moreover, the longer the women engaged in the cooperative strategy, the stronger was the activation. The fact that people often compete rather than cooperate implies the existence of countervailing tendencies. But, the fact that one can (at least sometimes) help oneself by helping others suggests that the traditional dualities pitting competition against cooperation, and self against other, disguise a compelling third choice. The ability to see beyond such dualities may be part of what AA, NA, and other mutual help groups offer.",M2
17458419,"Spirituality and alcoholics anonymous.What can be confidently said about <e>AA</e> in general and about the role of spirituality in AA in particular? First, there is convincing evidence that alcoholism severity predicts later AA attendance. Second, atheists are less likely to attend AA, relative to individuals who already hold spiritual and/or religious beliefs. However, belief in God before AA attendance does not offer any advantage in AA-related benefits, and atheists, once involved, are at no apparent disadvantage in deriving AA-related benefits. Third, the spiritually-based principles of AA appear to be endorsed in AA meetings regardless of the perceived social dynamics or climate of a particular meeting, eg, highly cohesive or aggressive. Fourth, significant increases in spiritual and religious beliefs and practices seem to occur among AA-exposed individuals. Fifth, in spite of much discussion to the contrary there is little evidence that spirituality directly accounts for later abstinence. We are finding, however, that spirituality has an important indirect effect in predicting later drinking reductions. Specifically, in the past 20 years a number of effective methods have been developed to facilitate initial AA attendance (AA dropout is high, with some estimates ranging as high as 80%). Interventions that lead to initial increases in spirituality appear to lead to sustained AA affiliation, which, in turn, produces sustained recovery over time.",M2
17401731,"Predictors of engagement in the Alcoholics Anonymous group or to psychotherapy among Brazilian alcoholics : a six-month follow-up study.OBJECTIVE: To ascertain factors associated with engagement of patients with alcohol dependence in Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) groups and psychotherapy. METHODS: About 300 hospitalized alcoholics were interviewed at hospitalization and again 3 and 6 months thereafter. Assessment included the administration of standardized instruments. Determinants of engagement in both interventions were assessed through logistic regression analysis. RESULTS: Higher educational level was predictive of engagement in AA after 6 months (OR = 2.19; CI 1.08-4.41). Engagement in psychotherapy after 6 months was related to having a university degree (OR = 3.60; CI 1.6-7.9), to a co-morbid depressive disorder (OR = 3.47; CI 1.8-6.5), to the use of other drugs together with alcohol (OR = 3.08; CI 1.5-6.19), to previous treatment (OR = 2.87; CI 1.29-6.40), and to having a high school degree (OR = 2.44; CI 1.24-4.80). The presence of substance-induced anxiety disorder was associated with non-engagement in psychotherapy (OR = 0.27; CI 0.63-0.003).

METHOD: Longitudinal survey data were collected from 123 outpatients with alcohol use disorders (66% male; mean age = 39; 83% white) on 10 measures of S/R, covering behaviors, beliefs, and experiences, including the Daily Spiritual Experiences and Purpose in Life scales. Drinking behaviors were assessed with the Timeline Followback interview. Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) participation and attendance were also measured. RESULTS: Over 6 months, there were statistically significant increases in half of the S/R measures, specifically the Daily Spiritual Experiences scale, the Purpose in Life scale, S/R practices scale, Forgiveness scale, and the Positive Religious Coping scale. There were also clinically and statistically significant decreases in alcohol use. Multiple logistic regression analyses showed that increases in Daily Spiritual Experiences and in Purpose in Life scores were associated with increased odds of no heavy drinking at 6 months, even after controlling for AA involvement and gender. CONCLUSIONS: In the first 6 months of recovery, many dimensions of S/R increased, particularly those associated with behaviors and experiences. Values, beliefs, self-assessed religiousness, perceptions of God, and the use of negative religious coping did not change. Increases in day-to-day experiences of spirituality and sense of purpose/meaning in life were associated with absence of heavy drinking at 6 months, regardless of gender and AA involvement. The results of this descriptive study support the perspective of many clinicians and recovering individuals that changes in alcoholics' S/R occur in recovery and that such changes are important to sobriety.",M2

METHODS: Data for the present analysis were derived from the placebo-group of a multi-centre study in Germany (Wiesbeck et al., 2001). Patients were free to choose either self-help group attendance (N = 50) or no support (N = 28). RESULTS: After 1-month of follow-up, there was a lower relapse rate in patients attending a self-help group as compared to the control group, a difference, however, that leveled off during the following months.

17010141,"Alcohol consumption, alcoholics anonymous membership, and homicide mortality rates in Ontario 1968 to 1991.BACKGROUND: Research has shown a strong link between alcohol use and a variety of problems, including violence. Parker and colleagues have presented a selective disinhibition theory for the link between alcohol use and homicide (and other violence) that posits a causal relationship that is also influenced by other situational and contextual factors. This model is particularly well suited for aggregate-level investigations. In this study, we examine the impact of alcohol factors, including consumption measures and Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) membership rates, on homicide mortality rates in Ontario, and test predictions derived from the selective disinhibition model. METHODS: Time series analyses with ARIMA modeling were applied to total, male, and female homicide rates in Ontario between 1968 and 1991. The analyses performed included total alcohol consumption, spirits consumption, beer consumption, and wine consumption. Missing AA membership data were interpolated with cubic splines. RESULTS: For the total population and males, homicide rates were significantly and positively related to total alcohol consumption and to the consumption of beer and spirits. They were also negatively related to AA membership rates in the analyses involving spirits and wine and positively related to unemployment rates in the analyses involving beer, wine, and total alcohol. Among females, none of the measures were significant predictors of homicide mortality rates. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide important support for the selective disinhibition model and confirm important relationships between per capita consumption measures and homicide mortality rates, especially among males, seen in other studies. Additionally, the results for AA membership rates are consistent with the hypothesis that AA membership and treatment for misuse of alcohol can exert beneficial effects observable at the population level.",M2

DESIGN: A naturalistic study in which individuals were assessed at baseline and 1, 8 and 16 years later. SETTING: Participants initiated help-seeking with the alcoholism service system by contacting an information and referral service or detoxification program. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 461 individuals with alcohol use disorders (50% women). METHODS: Participants were assessed by mail surveys and telephone interviews on participation in professional treatment and Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>), alcohol-related functioning and indices of life context and coping. RESULTS: Compared to men, women were more likely to participate in treatment and AA, and to experience better alcohol-related and life context outcomes. In general, women and men who participated in treatment and/or AA for a longer duration were more likely to achieve remission. However, women benefited somewhat more than men from extended participation in AA. Continuing depression and reliance on avoidance coping were more closely associated with lack of remission among men than among women. CONCLUSION: Compared to men, women with alcohol use disorders were more likely to obtain help and achieve remission. Women tended to benefit more from continued participation in AA and showed greater reductions in depression and avoidance coping than men did. These findings identify specific targets for clinical interventions that appear to be especially beneficial for women and that may also enhance the likelihood of recovery among men.",M2

Although it is the most common, AA is not the only 12-step intervention available there are other 12-step approaches (labelled Twelve Step Facilitation (TSF)). OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of AA or TSF programmes compared to other psychosocial interventions in reducing alcohol intake, achieving abstinence, maintaining abstinence, improving the quality of life of affected people and their families, and reducing alcohol associated accidents and health problems. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Specialized Register of Trials of the Cochrane Group on Drugs and Alcohol, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), MEDLINE from 1966, EMBASE from 1980, CINAHL from 1982, PsychINFO from 1967. Searches were updated in February 2005. We also inspected lists of references for relevant studies. SELECTION CRITERIA: Studies involving adults (&lt;18) of both genders with alcohol dependence attending on a voluntary or coerced basis AA or TSF programmes comparing no treatment, other psychological interventions, 12-step variants. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: One reviewer (MF) assessed studies for inclusion and extracted data using a pre-defined data extraction form. Studies were evaluated for methodological quality and discussed by all reviewers. MAIN RESULTS: Eight trials involving 3417 people were included. AA may help patients to accept treatment and keep patients in treatment more than alternative treatments, though the evidence for this is from one small study that combined AA with other interventions and should not be regarded as conclusive. Other studies reported similar retention rates regardless of treatment group. Three studies compared AA combined with other interventions against other treatments and found few differences in the amount of drinks and percentage of drinking days. Severity of addiction and drinking consequence did not seem to be differentially influenced by TSF versus comparison treatment interventions, and no conclusive differences in treatment drop out rates were reported. Included studies did not allow a conclusive assessment of the effect of TSF in promoting complete abstinence. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: No experimental studies unequivocally demonstrated the effectiveness of AA or TSF approaches for reducing alcohol dependence or problems. One large study focused on the prognostic factors associated with interventions that were assumed to be successful rather than on the effectiveness of interventions themselves, so more efficacy studies are needed.",M2
16736076,"Examining the effects of alcoholism typology and <e>AA</e> attendance on self-efficacy as a mechanism of change.OBJECTIVE: Existing research indicates that increased self-efficacy to sustain abstinence is a strong causal mechanism explaining later reduction of drinking. Little is known about how mechanisms of change may differ among distinct subgroups of alcoholics. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mediational role of self-efficacy on changes in drinking associated with Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance in Type-A and Type-B alcoholics. METHOD: Analysis of covariance and structural equation modeling were used to model 6-, 9-, 12-, and 15-month data from Project MATCH (Matching Alcoholism Treatments to Client Heterogeneity) participants who were classified as Type-A or Type-B alcoholics (N=1,284; 72% male). Measures of AA attendance and percent days abstinent were taken from the Form 90. Self- efficacy was assessed with the Alcohol Abstinence Self-Efficacy Scale. RESULTS: Alcoholism typology and AA attendance were independent predictors of later self-efficacy, but there was no interaction between typology and AA attendance. Abstinence self-efficacy mediated a modest proportion of the effect of posttreatment AA attendance on later abstinence in both Type-A and Type-B alcoholics. The strength of this mediation did not differ by typology. CONCLUSIONS: Self-efficacy for abstinence has a strong direct relationship to abstinence across treatment conditions and typologies. Increases in self-efficacy mediate some of the beneficial effects of AA for Type-A and Type-B alcoholics. Further work is necessary to determine whether self-efficacy plays a different role in the recovery of Type-A versus Type-B alcoholics.",M2

This study investigated whether alcohol problem severity predicted both AA affiliation and disaffiliation among clients receiving TS. This study of a Project MATCH sample included 453 alcohol-dependent clients randomly assigned to TS who reported AA attendance during treatment. Greater alcohol problem severity predicted AA attendance; opposite to prediction, less alcohol-impaired clients were more than twice as likely to discontinue AA attendance after treatment. When sustained AA attendance is desired, the evaluation of client pretreatment alcohol involvement may be useful for identifying potential AA dropout after TS treatment.

RESULTS: Total alcohol consumption and consumption of each of beer, distilled spirits, and wine were significantly and positively related to total and female suicide mortality rates. AA membership rates were negatively related to total and female suicide rates. Although data for males did not reach significance (except for the relationship between wine consumption and suicide rate), the direction of effects was consistent with that observed for female and total suicide rates. Unemployment rates were positively related to male and total suicide rates in some models. CONCLUSIONS: These data confirm the important relationships between per capita consumption measures and suicide mortality rates seen by previous investigators. Additionally, the results for AA membership rates are consistent with the hypothesis that AA membership and treatment for misuse of alcohol can exert beneficial effects observable at the population level.",M2

These individuals were surveyed at baseline and 1 year, 3 years, 8 years, and 16 years later. Compared with individuals who remained untreated, individuals who obtained 27 weeks or more of treatment in the first year after seeking help had better 16-year alcohol-related outcomes. Similarly, individuals who participated in AA for 27 weeks or more had better 16-year outcomes. Subsequent AA involvement was also associated with better 16-year outcomes, but this was not true of subsequent treatment. Some of the association between treatment and long-term alcohol-related outcomes appears to be due to participation in AA.",M2

Spirituality is a latent construct, one that is inferred from multiple component dimensions, such as social psychology, neurophysiology, and treatment outcome research. Mechanisms related to its role in promotion of recovery in AA are discussed from the perspective of these findings, along with related options for professionally grounded treatment, such as Twelve-Step Facilitation.

16340455,"Alcoholics anonymous careers: patterns of <e>AA</e> involvement five years after treatment entry.BACKGROUND: Most formal treatment programs recommend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) attendance during treatment and as a form of aftercare, but we know very little about treatment seekers' patterns of AA involvement over time and how these relate to abstinence. METHOD: This paper applies latent class growth curve modeling to longitudinal data from 349 dependent drinkers recruited when they were entering treatment and were re-interviewed at one or more follow-up interviews one, three and five years later, and who reported having attended AA at least once. RESULTS: Four classes of AA  careers  of meeting attendance emerged: The low AA group mainly just attended AA during the 12 months following treatment entry. The medium and high AA groups were characterized by stable attendance at the second and third follow-ups-at about 60 meetings a year for the medium group and over 200 meetings per year for the high group, followed by slight increases for the medium group and slight decreases for the high group by year five. The declining AA group doubled its meeting attendance postbaseline, to almost 200 meetings during the year following treatment entry, but by year five they were only attending about six meetings on average. Decreases in AA meetings did not necessarily signal disengagement from AA; at the five-year follow-up, a third of the low AA group and over half of the declining AA group said they felt like a member of AA. Activities other than meeting attendance, such as having a sponsor, otherwise paralleled the meeting careers, but social networks were similar by year five. Rates of abstinence by year five (for the past 30 days) were 43% for the low AA group, 73% for the medium group, 79% for the high group and 61% for the declining group. Rates of dependence symptoms and social consequences of drinking did not differ between the groups at year five. CONCLUSIONS: The prototypical AA careers derived empirically are consistent with anecdotal data about AA meetings: some never connect; some connect but briefly; and others maintain stable (and sometimes quite high) rates of AA attendance. However, contrary to AA lore, many who connect only for a while do well afterwards.",M2
16320441,"Does diagnosis matter? Differential effects of 12-step participation and social networks on abstinence.Previous studies that have examined the effects of specific aspects of 12-step participation and social network composition on abstinence have focused mostly on alcohol-related outcomes and have screened out drug dependent persons. This article explores whether these predictors differentially affect abstinence based on DSM-III-R substance dependence disorder (alcohol dependence, drug dependence, and both alcohol and drug dependence). A heterogeneous community sample of treatment seekers (N=302) randomized to day treatment programs were followed at 6 and 12 months. Bivariate and multivariate regression models were used to test whether engagement in 12-step practices and social network influences to drink or use drugs predicted total abstinence from alcohol and drugs differentially by dependence disorder. Chi-square automatic interaction detector (CHAID) segmentation analyses were then conducted to identify the specific 12-step activities and social network thresholds that best distinguished higher rates of abstinence in each dependence category. Results showed that the number of 12-step meetings attended and number of prescribed 12-step activities engaged in similarly predicted abstinence for alcoholics, drug addicts, and those dependent on both alcohol and drugs. However, specific activities were associated with abstinence differentially by dependence disorder. While many activities differentiated abstinence for drug addicts and those dependent on both alcohol and drugs, for alcoholics only two Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) activities distinguished abstinence (having a sponsor and doing service). Key predictors of abstinence (CHAID) varied by follow-up and dependence disorder, except for doing service in AA and/or Narcotics Anonymous, which was the only specific 12-step activity that was a best predictor of abstinence in all three categories one year following treatment. Thus,  giving back  to one's peer community through service work, an important 12-step belief, seems to be universally valuable later in recovery. As for social network influences, a multivariate regression model showed that having a higher proportion of abstinent individuals in the network was associated with abstinence for alcoholics at 6 months only and for drug dependent persons at 12 months only. CHAID models supported these results and provided specific thresholds for 12-step measures (e.g., &gt;20 meetings for alcoholics, 2 or more nondrinkers in the social network, 3 or more persons supporting reduction for those dependent on both alcohol and drugs, and having 2 or more nondrinkers for those dependent on drugs only). These results support the value of treatment providers prioritizing certain 12-step-related practices and social network changes based on their client dependence profiles. Early on, those with an alcohol diagnosis need to make a commitment to meetings and obtain a sponsor; also, they need to place themselves in a network that encourages sobriety. Early on, those who are drug-dependent-only especially need to become connected with 12-step programs to the extent that they consider themselves a member, and, later, saturate themselves in a highly supportive and predominantly nondrinking environment. Alcohol and drug dependent clients need more intense ongoing 12-step involvement (sponsor and meetings) as well as having nondrinking individuals and people supportive of abstinence in their network. For all clients, doing service is especially important at the longer 12-month posttreatment timeframe.",M2
16311185,"United Kingdom substance misuse treatment workers' attitudes toward 12-step self-help groups.Research has highlighted the benefits of professional substance misuse treatment workers facilitating their clients' involvement in 12-step self-help groups such as Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA). This study used a cross-sectional survey design to explore the attitudes of substance misuse treatment staff working in the English West Midlands region toward AA and NA and the 12-step philosophy. A total of 346 treatment workers responded (71%). Fewer than 10% used the 12-step model in their treatment work, and only a third felt that their clients were generally suited to AA or NA. Fewer than half (46%) said that they were likely to recommend that their clients attend a self-help group meeting. Staff with nursing qualifications were more likely to have a positive attitude toward AA/NA than their non-nursing colleagues, and there was a statistically significant association between the level of reported spirituality of the workers and the likelihood of them recommending to clients that they attend AA or NA meetings. These results highlight differences in the role of AA/NA within the substance misuse treatment system in the United Kingdom and that in the United States; possible explanations are discussed.",M2
16277627,"Cirrhosis mortality in Ontario: effects of alcohol consumption and Alcoholics Anonymous participation.AIMS: We test the hypotheses that cirrhosis mortality rates are positively associated with per capita alcohol consumption and negatively associated with Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) membership rates. DESIGN: The impact of alcohol consumption levels and AA membership rates on cirrhosis mortality rates in Ontario from 1968 to 1989 were examined. Time-series analyses with ARIMA modelling were applied to male and female cirrhosis mortality rates in three age groups: 15-44, 45-64 and 65 + years. Missing AA membership data were interpolated using two methods: linear splines and cubic splines. FINDINGS: In general, cirrhosis mortality rates were positively associated with alcohol consumption and negatively associated with AA membership. For some age and gender combinations, these effects were not statistically significant. CONCLUSIONS: The limits of this study include restrictions in the length of series available and in the ability to infer causality. Despite these limitations, these findings are consistent with previous research demonstrating that per capita consumption is a strong determinant of cirrhosis mortality rates, and also that higher levels of AA membership can reduce cirrhosis mortality rates.",M2

At each contact point, participants described their participation in AA and treatment and their current alcohol-related functioning. They also described their reasons for entering AA and/or treatment and the perceived benefits of these sources of help RESULTS: Compared with individuals who initially participated only in treatment but later entered AA, those who entered treatment and AA together participated in AA longer and more frequently and were more likely to achieve remission. Among individuals who initially participated only in AA, those who later entered treatment had poorer remission outcomes than those who did not enter treatment. Longer duration of participation in AA was associated with a higher likelihood of remission at all four follow-ups; individuals who dropped out of AA were more likely to relapse or remain nonremitted. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with individuals who participated only in professional treatment in the first year after they initiated help-seeking, individuals who participated in both treatment and AA were more likely to achieve remission. Individuals who entered treatment but delayed participation in AA did not appear to obtain any additional benefit from AA.",M2
16244684,"[Self-help programs in drug addiction therapy]BACKGROUND: Treatment of drug addiction is complex; hence there is a debate in the field of what is the best approach. An honest desire to stop using drugs is the entry ticket into the self-help programmes Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) and Narcotics Anonymous (NA); these groups are a possible supplement to ordinary treatment. They employ the twelve-step programme and are found in most large cities in Norway and around the world. The usefulness of these groups has been disputed, and few Norwegian treatment facilities have developed a systematic cooperation with them. The purpose of this study was to examine whether the use of self-help groups is associated with higher rates of abstinence two years after participants started attending groups. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 114 patients, 59 with alcohol addiction and 55 with drug addiction, who started in self-help groups after a drug treatment, were approached two years later with a questionnaire. The response rate was 66%; 6 (5%) patients were dead. RESULTS:Intention to treat analysis showed that 38% participated in self-help programmes two years after treatment. Of regular participants, 81% had been abstinent over the previous 6 months, compared with only 26% among non-participants. Logistic regression analysis showed odds ratio = 12.6, 95% CI (4.1-38.3), p &lt; 0.001, for participation and abstinence. CONCLUSION: The study has several methodological problems; particularly that correlation does not necessarily indicate causality. These problems are discussed here; the conclusion is that the probability of a positive effect is strong enough to recommend participation in self-help groups as a supplement to drug addiction treatment.",M2
15957682,"Psychobehavioral risk factors, substance treatment engagement and clinical outcomes as predictors of emergency department use and medical hospitalization.OBJECTIVE: Prior research on health care utilization after treatment for substance misuse disorders has not accounted for posttreatment clinical outcomes as well as putative confounds associated with both substance use and health care. This study examined the association of posttreatment health care utilization with treatment factors (program type and time in treatment) and baseline psychological/behavioral risk factors (smoking status and level of depressive, alcohol and drug dependence symptoms). The study also examined whether posttreatment clinical outcomes-participation in aftercare, Alcoholic Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) attendance, substance use, depressive symptoms and smoking- were associated with subsequent health care utilization. METHOD: We analyzed predictors of posttreatment medical hospitalizations and emergency department (ED) use among 15,041 participants in a multistate treatment evaluation project conducted from 1987 to 1995. RESULTS: Greater time in treatment reduced the likelihood of future hospitalizations and ED use, whereas clients in outpatient treatment were less likely to be hospitalized. Baseline measures of depressive, alcohol and drug dependence symptoms were each independently associated with subsequent health care use. Posttreatment aftercare participation reduced the likelihood of future hospitalization and ED use, whereas AA attendance also reduced the likelihood of hospitalization. In addition, posttreatment counts of depressive symptoms increased the likelihood of future hospitalization and ED use. Substance relapse increased the likelihood of subsequent ED use. CONCLUSIONS: The study supports the public health importance of substance misuse disorders treatment, with greater treatment involvement associated with lower high-cost medical utilization. Treatment clinical outcomes-posttreatment relapse and depressive symptoms-partially mediate the effect of treatment on health care utilization.",M2

DESIGN AND MEASURES: A sample of individuals (N = 461) who initiated help-seeking was surveyed at baseline and 1, 3, 8, and 16 years later. In addition to providing information on life history of drinking at each contact point, participants described their current alcohol-related and psychosocial functioning and life context, and coping responses. FINDINGS: Irrespective of whether or not individuals obtained help, their alcohol-related functioning, life context, and coping improved. However, individuals who obtained help (AA or treatment) in the first year improved more and were more likely to achieve stable remission than those who did not. Nevertheless, the factors associated with stable remission were comparable for individuals who did and those who did not obtain timely help. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with individuals who do not obtain timely help, those who enter either AA or treatment relatively soon after initiating help-seeking improve more quickly and achieve higher long-term remission rates.",M2

METHOD: The published works on effective treatments for alcoholism is briefly reviewed and a prospective multidisciplinary follow-up of recovery from alcoholism in two community cohorts of adolescent males followed from 1940 until the present day is reviewed. CONCLUSIONS: The suggested mechanism of action of AA is that it employs four factors widely shown to be effective in relapse prevention in addictions: external supervision, substitute dependency, new caring relationships and increased spirituality. In addition, AA serendipitously follows the principles of cognitive behaviour therapy in relapse prevention. Alcoholics Anonymous appears equal to or superior to conventional treatments for alcoholism, and the skepticism of some professionals regarding AA as a first rank treatment for alcoholism would appear to be unwarranted. Alcoholics Anonymous is probably without serious side-effects.",M2

METHODS: Initially untreated problem drinkers were followed up for 8 years. RESULTS: Women and men did not differ in regard to the type of help received, but women had longer professional treatment. At baseline, women had more stressors and fewer resources from family and relied more on avoidance coping and drinking to cope. During the next 8 years, women, more so than men, increased on approach coping and reduced their use of avoidance coping and drinking to cope. When baseline status was controlled, women had better social resource, coping, and drinking outcomes than men did at 1 year and 8 years. A longer duration of professional treatment during year 1 was associated with improved approach coping among men but not women. A longer duration of AA attendance during year 1 and the full 8 years was associated with more resources from friends, more use of approach coping, and less drinking to cope. In turn, more friends resources and approach coping and less drinking to cope were associated with better drinking outcomes. Decreases in avoidance coping and drinking to cope were more strongly associated with better drinking outcomes among men than among women. CONCLUSIONS: It may be important to target men for formal services or self-help to increase their use of approach coping in efforts to maintain abstinence. Women's strategies for improving their social context need further explication to be adapted for transfer to male problem drinkers.",M2

The treatment retention amounted to n = 74 (72 %), 18 of the 25 dropouts took place because of alcohol relapse. At 6-, 12- and 24-months-follow-up 87 - 95 % of the patients were successfully located and re-interviewed. Analyses revealed that 64 % of the patients were abstinent at the 6-months-follow-up evaluation, 56 % at the total 12-months-follow-up evaluation. 49 % of the patients remained abstinent until the 24-months-follow-up evaluation, 14 % were improved and 37 % relapsed. 56 patients (55 %) participated in selfhelp-groups the first six months following treatment, two years later 45 patients (44 %) still attended a group. 53 - 56 % participated on a weekly basis. Patients who participated regularly on a weekly basis in self-help-groups fared the best on 2-year outcome. Patients who infrequently at all participated or not had the poorest outcome (relapse). After controlling for confounding variables (sex, treatment drop-out, relapse during treatment) these results were still statistical significant. Results indicate the predictive value of AA attendance for relapse prevention after controlling for confounding variables.

The purpose of this study is to examine prospectively the relationship between helping other alcoholics and relapse in the year following treatment for alcohol use disorders. METHOD: Data were derived from Project MATCH, a longitudinal prospective investigation of the efficacy of three behavioral treatments for alcohol abuse and dependence. Kaplan-Meier survival estimates were used to calculate probabilities of time to alcohol relapse. To identify the unique value of helping other alcoholics when controlling for the number of AA meetings attended, proportional hazards regressions were conducted to determine whether the likelihood of relapse was lower for those who were helping other alcoholics. RESULTS: There were no demographic differences that distinguished participants in regard to involvement in helping other alcoholics, with the exception of age; those who were helping other alcoholics were, on average, 3 years older than those who were not helping alcoholics. Those who were helping were significantly less likely to relapse in the year following treatment, independent of the number of AA meetings attended. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide compelling evidence that recovering alcoholics who help other alcoholics maintain long-term sobriety following formal treatment are themselves better able to maintain their own sobriety. Clinicians who treat persons with substance abuse disorders should encourage their clients to help other recovering alcoholics to stay sober.",M2

A sample of 200 subjects completed a Helper Therapy Scale including three subscales: Recovery Helping (alpha = 0.78), Life Helping (alpha = 0.62), and Community Helping (alpha = 0.60). A previous analysis using structural equation modeling found that length of sobriety predicted measures of spirituality, helping, and AA participation. The analysis reported here examined whether psychiatric severity was associated with these variables. Results indicated significant relationships between psychiatric severity and measures of spirituality (Self Transcendence, Forgiveness, Positive Coping, and Negative Coping) and AA Achievement (defined as completing the 12 steps and serving as a sponsor). However, no relationships were found between psychiatric severity and length of sobriety, the three Helper Therapy subscales, or AA involvement. The findings suggest that individuals with higher psychiatric severity may need assistance from their peers or professional service providers to develop a spiritual life, serve as a sponsor for others, or complete the steps of AA.",M2

This analysis examines the question of what is the essence of affiliation vs. disaffiliation. Data from the Project MATCH 1-year posttreatment Alcoholics Anonymous Involvement (AAI) scale (N=1506) are used to identify the most salient items of Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) affiliation predicting 1-year posttreatment drinking outcomes.

The factors associated with complete abstinence were investigated. METHOD: Patients (187 men) admitted consecutively to an addiction facility, who fulfilled the DSM-IV criteria for alcohol dependence, were recruited for the study. Patients with major psychopathology were excluded from the cohort. The program was based on the principles of AA. The final outcome at 1 year was determined by visiting the patient and talking to the family and members of the local AA group. RESULTS: Of the 187 initially recruited, five were excluded due to the presence of major psychopathology, one committed suicide and seven could not be traced. Of the 174 patients followed up, 58 (33.3%) remained sober (complete abstinence for the past year) at 1 year. Patients coming from distant places and those with follow-up workers in their localities fared better than those from the local area and those from towns where there was no one to motivate them to continue with AA meetings. These variables were significantly associated with sobriety even after adjusted for other confounders using multivariate techniques.

The study also explores interrelations among Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>), helping and spirituality. METHOD: Questionnaires were administered to recovering alcoholics (118 men, 80 women) recruited at AA and Women for Sobriety meetings, treatment programs and through personal connections. A helping scale measured Recovery Helping (8-item alpha = 0.78), Life Helping (12-item alpha = 0.62), and Community Helping (6-item alpha = 0.60). The Daily Spiritual Experiences scale assessed two components of spirituality identified by factor analysis: Theism and Self-Transcendence. Two components of an AA scale, Involvement and Achievement, were also treated separately on the basis of factor analysis. RESULTS: Structural equation modeling revealed that longer sobriety predicted significantly more time spent on Community Helping, less time spent on Recovery Helping and higher levels of Theism, Self-Transcendence and AA Achievement. Model covariances revealed that both AA components were related to more Recovery Helping and higher Theism. Both spirituality components related to all forms of helping, with one exception. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight important changes in helping with length of sobriety. As their sobriety accumulates, recovering alcoholics seem to devote less time to informal helping and more time to organized community projects--perhaps indicating evolving needs and abilities. The results also suggest roles for AA and spirituality in encouraging helping, and they indicate that some forms of spirituality relate to AA affiliation. Future work might establish whether and when helping in different domains contributes to the maintenance of abstinence and to other drinking-related outcomes.",M2

Three hundred twenty-two members of the Daytop TC completed a survey assessing personal orientation to spirituality and attitudes towards spirituality based treatments. The majority of clients believed that the TC program should feature spirituality more in treatment. Nearly half agreed that the Twelve-Step (<e>AA</e>) approach should be more a part of TC treatment.

Participant reports were verified through collateral or reliability interviews. Stable resolution was associated with heavier drinking and greater negative life events before resolution. Seeking help, especially from treatment, was associated with greater psychosocial problems and higher dependence levels. The results indicate that different dimensions of drinking problems are associated with help-seeking and drinking outcomes, and suggest ways to increase help-seeking.",M2
14621343,"Short-term buprenorphine maintenance: treatment outcome.Fifty-two heroin addicts were inducted onto buprenorphine under the care of psychiatric residents in a setting modeled on office practice. Subjects were maintained on a protocol of six weeks of 16 mg daily dosing, then tapered to zero dose up to week 16, and maintained on placebo through week 18. Of 44 subjects who continued after the first induction dose, 11 terminated during maintenance, 17 during taper; and 16 while on zero dose. Twice weekly urine toxicologies showed significant successive declines in samples positive for heroin use across these three periods: 70%, 41%, and 20%, respectively. Among historical variables, only prior <e>AA</e> attendance distinguished subjects who achieved zero dose from those who did not. A comparison with recent studies suggests that relatively inexperienced office-based physicians can maintain patients on buprenorphine at a level comparable to that reported for research clinic settings, but with comparable rates of heroin abstinence. These findings are discussed in light of potential options for office-based opioid maintenance.",M2
12921201,"The persistent influence of social networks and alcoholics anonymous on abstinence.OBJECTIVE: The role of changes in Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) involvement and social networks in relation to abstinence following substance abuse treatment is studied. Specifically, the role of AA and network support for abstinence are examined in relation to their effect on changes in abstinence states between follow-ups. METHOD: Study sites were 10 representative public and private alcohol treatment programs in a northern California county. A recruitment of 367 men and 288 women seeking treatment were interviewed at intake and re-interviewed 1 and 3 years later to collect information about alcohol consumption, dependence symptoms, social support for reducing drinking, number of heavy drinkers in the social network and AA involvement. RESULTS: Significant predictors of 90-day abstinence at both the 1- and 3-year follow-up interviews included AA involvement in the last year, percentage of heavy or problem drinkers in the social network, percentage encouraging alcohol reduction and AA-based support for reducing drinking. Panel models estimated an increase in AA participation between 12 and 36 months posttreatment increased the odds of abstinence at 3 years by 35% above those at 12 months. The only significant mediator of AA's effect on abstinence was the number of AA-based contacts supporting reduced drinking, which reduced the magnitude of the relationship by 16%. CONCLUSIONS: AA involvement and the type of support received from AA members were consistent contributors to abstinence 3 years following a treatment episode. The enduring effects observed from supportive networks demonstrate the importance of ongoing mechanisms of action that contribute to an abstinent lifestyle.",M2
12915517,"Is attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous meetings after inpatient treatment related to improved outcomes? A 6-month follow-up study.AIMS: This study investigates the relationship between attendance at Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) meetings prior to, during, and after leaving treatment, and changes in clinical outcome following inpatient alcohol treatment. METHODS: A longitudinal design was used in which participants were interviewed at admission (within 5 days of entry), and 6 months following departure. The sample comprised 150 patients in an inpatient alcohol treatment programme who met ICD-10 criteria for alcohol dependence. The full sample was interviewed at admission to treatment. Six months after departure from treatment, 120 (80%) were re-interviewed. RESULTS: Significant improvements in drinking behaviours (frequency, quantity and reported problems), psychological problems and quality of life were reported. Frequent AA attenders had superior drinking outcomes to non-AA attenders and infrequent attenders. Those who attended AA on a weekly or more frequent basis after treatment reported greater reductions in alcohol consumption and more abstinent days. This relationship was sustained after controlling for potential confounding variables. Frequent AA attendance related only to improved drinking outcomes. Despite the improved outcomes, many of the sample had alcohol and psychiatric problems at follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The importance of aftercare has long been acknowledged. Despite this, adequate aftercare services are often lacking. The findings support the role of Alcoholics Anonymous as a useful aftercare resource.",M2
12713200,"Prior Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) affiliation and the acceptability of the Twelve Steps to patients entering UK statutory addiction treatment.OBJECTIVE: The study investigates levels of affiliation with AA and beliefs about the organization and its philosophy among a cohort of alcoholics entering a UK (non-AA) alcohol treatment service. METHOD: A total of 150 consecutive admissions (75% men) were interviewed by an independent researcher within 5 days of their entry into a residential alcohol treatment unit. RESULTS: Although about three quarters of these patients had previously attended AA meetings, levels of affiliation were low, with only 16% having worked any of the Twelve Steps. Previous AA attenders were more likely to be older, drinking greater daily quantities prior to treatment and to have first sought alcohol treatment at a younger age. Roughly equal groups expressed  positive,   neutral  and  negative  current attitudes towards AA (38%, 36% and 26%, respectively). Each of these three AA-attitude groups expressed greater endorsement of  Personal Responsibility  steps than of  Higher Power mediated  steps. CONCLUSIONS: Few participants were universally negative to AA or the Twelve Steps--most regarded some of the steps as positive, but many rejected those referring to a Higher Power. Most also regarded some aspects of the organization and its philosophy worthwhile, with attitudes spread across the continuum of opinion. As AA remains one of the most widely sought forms of help for alcohol problems, a clearer understanding is needed of its impact on patients and the appropriateness of its integration within substance misuse programs which are not explicitly Twelve Step in orientation.",M2
12699024,"Alcoholics anonymous involvement and positive alcohol-related outcomes: cause, consequence, or just a correlate? A prospective 2-year study of 2,319 alcohol-dependent men.A positive corelation between Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) involvement and better alcohol-related outcomes has been identified in research studies, but whether this correlation reflects a causal relationship remains a subject of meaningful debate. The present study evaluated the question of whether AA affiliation appears causally related to positive alcohol-related outcomes in a sample of 2,319 male alcohol-dependent patients. An initial structural equation model indicated that 1-year posttreatment levels of AA affiliation predicted lower alcohol-related problems at 2-year follow-up, whereas level of alcohol-related problems at 1-year did not predict AA affiliation at 2-year follow-up. Additional models found that these effects were not attributable to motivation or psychopathology. The findings are consistent with the hypothesis that AA participation has a positive effect on alcohol-related outcomes.",M2

12133128,"Social networks as mediators of the effect of Alcoholics Anonymous.AIMS: This study tested the hypothesis that the relationship between Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) involvement and reduced substance use is partially explained (or 'mediated') by changes in social networks. DESIGN: This is a naturalistic longitudinal study of the course of alcohol problems. SETTING: Study sites were the 10 largest public and private alcohol treatment programs in a northern California county. PARTICIPANTS: Three hundred and seventy-seven men and 277 women were recruited upon seeking treatment at study sites. MEASUREMENTS: At baseline and 1-year follow-up, we assessed alcohol consequences and dependence symptoms, consumption, social support for abstinence, pro-drinking social influences and AA involvement. FINDINGS: In the structural equation model, AA involvement was a significant predictor of lower alcohol consumption and fewer related problems. The size of this effect decreased by 36% when network size and support for drinking were included as mediators. In logistic regression models predicting abstinence at follow-up, AA remained highly significant after including social network variables but was again reduced in magnitude. Thirty-day abstinence was predicted by AA involvement (OR=2.9), not having pro-drinking influences in one's network (OR=0.7) and having support for reducing consumption from people met in AA (versus no support; OR=3.4). In contrast, having support from non-AA members was not a significant predictor of abstinence. For alcohol-related outcomes other than abstinence, significant relationships were found for both AA-based and non-AA-based support. CONCLUSIONS: The type of social support specifically given by AA members, such as 24-hour availability, role modeling and experientially based advice for staying sober, may help to explain AA's mechanism of action. Results highlight the value of focusing on outcomes reflective of AA's goals (such as abstinence) when studying how AA works.",M2
12133127,"Gender differences in help-utilization and the 8-year course of alcohol abuse.AIMS: The aim of this study was to compare initially untreated women and men problem drinkers on help-utilization and outcomes over 8 years. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: At the time of the 8-year follow-up, individuals (N=466, 49% female) had self-selected into four groups: no help, Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) only, formal treatment only or formal treatment plus AA. MEASUREMENTS: At baseline and 1, 3 and 8 years later, participants completed measures of drinking and functioning. FINDINGS: Women were generally worse off than men on baseline drinking and functioning indices. In keeping with their poorer baseline status, women were more likely to participate in AA, and had longer in-patient stays during the next year. When women's baseline status was controlled, women had better outcomes than did men at 1 and 8 years. Generally, women and men did not differ on the extent to which obtaining help, or a particular type of help, was related to improved outcomes. Regarding drinking outcomes, women benefited more than did men from more AA attendance during years 2-8 of follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that although alcoholism interventions were designed primarily for men, they are currently delivered in ways that are also useful to women. Problem-drinking women appear to benefit from sustained participation in AA, which emphasizes bonding with supportive peers to maintain abstinence.",M2
12086134,"Environmental contexts surrounding resolution of drinking problems among problem drinkers with different help-seeking experiences.OBJECTIVE: This study investigated whether similar environmental contexts surround abstinent resolutions associated with different intervention experiences, including no assistance. METHOD: Participants were selected in a 3 x 2 design (25-30 per group, N = 167) according to their help-seeking experiences (no assistance, Alcoholics Anonymous [<e>AA</e>] only, treatment plus AA) and current drinking status (resolved abstinent [RA] for &gt;2 years or nonresolved [NR] controls). Life events were assessed retrospectively over a 4-year period that spanned the 2 years before and 2 years after the initiation of stable abstinence by RA participants or over a matched interval for NR participants. Collateral or reliability interviews were conducted for 84% of the sample as checks on participant reports. RESULTS: Across help-seeking groups, RA participants reported decreased negative events and increased positive events from the pre- through the post-resolution period. Interventions, especially treatment, enhanced the postresolution improvements in RA participants' life circumstances. This pattern was absent among NR participants. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that a similar molar environmental context surrounds resolutions achieved with and without interventions and that interventions are associated with enhanced improvements during maintenance.",M2
12033698,"Utilization of <e>AA</e> by Hispanic and non-Hispanic white clients receiving outpatient alcohol treatment.OBJECTIVE: Research indicates that Hispanic clients are less likely than non-Hispanic white (NHW) clients to attend Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) after treatment. This study examined how, if at all, the nature of commitment to prescribed AA-related behaviors after treatment differed between Hispanic and non-Hispanic whites, and how such behaviors were associated with drinking reductions. METHOD: This retrospective study was conducted using Project MATCH data collected at the Albuquerque clinical research unit. Study aims were investigated using the Form 90, the Alcoholics Anonymous Inventory and the Religious Background and Behavior measures. A total of 100 Hispanic and 105 non-Hispanic clients were randomized to receive either Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT), Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET) or Twelve-Step Facilitation (TSF) therapy, and findings were divided according to whether clients were encouraged to attend AA (TSF) or not (CBT and MET). RESULTS: Six months after treatment, Hispanic clients assigned to TSF reported significantly less AA attendance relative to NHW clients in TS, and no differences in AA attendance rates were found between Hispanics encouraged and not encouraged to attend AA (TSF vs CBT and MET). Among TSF clients, however, no ethnic differences were found in rates of specific AA-related behaviors. Controlling for intake beliefs,  God Consciousness  after treatment was significantly higher for Hispanic relative to NHW clients, and a main effect of treatment was also obtained (TSF vs CBT and MET). Specific AA-related practices were not associated with increased abstinence, in general. CONCLUSIONS: Despite less frequent AA attendance, Hispanic clients showed increase in AA commitment comparable to that of NHW clients. It thus appears that differential commitment to AA does not explain why Hispanic clients report less frequent AA attendance but equal benefit, relative to NHW clients.",M2
12638636,"Alcoholics Anonymous and 12-step alcoholism treatment programs.Alcoholics Anonymous (<e>AA</e>) self-help groups are the most commonly accessed component of the de facto system of care for alcohol problems in the United States. Further, AA's concepts and approach have strongly influenced a significant number of professional treatment programs. Nevertheless, only a modest number of longitudinal, comparative outcome studies on AA and on professional 12-step treatment programs have been conducted, which has limited both the certainty and scope of conclusions that can be drawn about these interventions. Research indicates that participation in Alcoholics Anonymous and in 12-step treatment are associated with significant reductions in substance abuse and psychiatric problems. Further, such interventions, it has been found, reduce health care costs over time in naturalistic, quasi-experimental, and experimental studies. Evaluation studies have also begun to illuminate the processes through which self-help groups and 12-step treatment programs exert their effects. To build on this knowledge base, future research should (1) be methodologically flexible and well-matched to its phenomenon of interest, (2) include evaluation of the unique features of self-help organizations, (3) increase representation of African-Americans and women in research samples, and (4) increase statistical power through larger sample sizes and more reliable measurement. Key content areas for future enquiry include further longitudinal evaluation of the outcomes of participation in AA and 12-step treatment (particularly in outpatient samples); better specification of the aspects of AA that influence outcome; and individual-, community-, and health organization-level controlled studies of the health care cost consequences of 12-step interventions.",M2
12380849,"Atheists, agnostics and Alcoholics Anonymous.OBJECTIVE: In spite of the strong emphasis in <e>AA</e> on spiritual beliefs and practices, findings are mixed about the importance of such beliefs in predicting AA affiliation. This study of the Project MATCH outpatient (N = 952) and aftercare (N = 774) samples tested three hypotheses about the role of client God belief and subsequent AA attendance and benefit, taking into account that some individuals may, in fact, deny the existence of a God. METHOD: Longitudinal analyses were conducted (N = 1,526) investigating client God beliefs, AA attendance, patterns of AA attendance and alcohol use. Assessments were conducted at intake and in 3-month intervals using the Form 90, Religious Behaviors and Background, and the Alcoholics Anonymous Inventory. RESULTS: 12-Step treatment was significantly more likely to promote pre-post shifts in client God beliefs, and atheist and agnostic clients attended AA significantly less often throughout follow-up relative to clients self-labeled as spiritual and religious. AA attendance, however, was significantly associated with increased abstinence and reductions in drinking intensity regardless of God belief. Finally, no differences in percent days abstinence and drinking intensity were found between atheist and agnostic versus spiritual and religious clients, but clients unsure about their God belief reported significantly higher drinking frequency relative to the other groups. CONCLUSIONS: God belief appears to be relatively unimportant in deriving AA-related benefit, but atheist and agnostic clients are less likely to initiate and sustain AA attendance relative to spiritual and religious clients. This apparent reticence to affiliate with AA ought to be clinically recognized when encouraging AA participation.",M2
