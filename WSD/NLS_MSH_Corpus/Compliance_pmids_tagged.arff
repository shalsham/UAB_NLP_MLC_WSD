20551758,"Rectoanal reflexes and sensorimotor response in rectal hyposensitivity.PURPOSE: Rectal hyposensitivity commonly causes anorectal disorders, but its underlying mechanism is unknown. We hypothesized that subjects with rectal hyposensitivity have altered rectoanal reflexes and/or sensorimotor response. METHODS: We performed stepwise graded balloon distensions of the rectum in 30 subjects with constipation and rectal hyposensitivity and in 23 healthy controls. Thresholds for first sensation, desire, and urgency to defecate were assessed. The lowest balloon volume that evoked rectoanal inhibitory reflex, rectoanal contractile reflex, and sensorimotor response and manometric characteristics and rectal <e>compliance</e> were examined. RESULTS: Reflex responses were present in all subjects. The balloon volumes were higher in subjects with rectal hyposensitivity for inducing rectoanal inhibitory reflex (P = .008) and contractile reflex (P = .001) compared with controls. All controls showed a sensorimotor response, but in 13 hyposensitive subjects (43%) the onset of sensorimotor response was associated with absent sensation and in 17 (57%), with a transient rectal sensation. Thresholds for eliciting sensorimotor response were similar between patients and controls, but the amplitude, duration, and magnitude of response were higher (P &lt; .05) in patients. Rectal compliance was similar between controls and hyposensitive subjects with transient sensation but higher (P = .001) in subjects with absent sensation. CONCLUSIONS: Constipated subjects with rectal hyposensitivity demonstrate higher thresholds for inducing rectoanal reflexes and abnormal characteristics of sensorimotor response. These findings suggest either disruption of afferent gut-brain pathways or rectal wall dysfunction. These altered features may play a role in the pathogenesis of bowel dysfunction in rectal hyposensitivity.",M1
20514984,"Reduced arterial <e>compliance</e> associated with metabolic syndrome in Chinese children and adolescents.OBJECTIVE: To explore the metabolic syndrome and its association with arterial compliance in Chinese children and adolescents. METHODS: 337 participants aged 6 to 18 years with males accounted for 55.8% were grouped according to their traits of metablic syndrome. Anthropometry, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, insulin and serum lipid profile were measured. Homeostasis model was assessed and insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index was measured and calculated for estimating individual insulin resistance. Arterial compliance was also measured using digital pulse wave analyzing method (Micro medical, London), and stiffness index was calculated. RESULTS: The stiffness index in participants with metablic syndrome was significant higher than that in participants with no riskof metablic syndrome [(7.69 +/- 1.63) vs (6.25 +/- 0.86) m/s, P &lt; 0.01] and stiffness index and HOMA-IR were progressively increased with the increase of traits of metablic syndrom (P for linear trend &lt; 0.001). After gender, age, and pubertal development were adjusted, both traits of metablic syndrome and HOMA-IR were correlated positively with stiffness index (both P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The clustering of metablic syndrome was closely associated with risk at increased arterial stiffness in Chinese children and adolescents. It was suggested that arterial compliance assessment of children and adolescents might be an important measure for prevention of cardiovascular diseases.",M1
20452485,"Effects of magnesium on central arterial <e>compliance</e> in preeclampsia.OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study was to investigate the effect of MgSO4 infusion on central arterial compliance, using radial artery applanation tonometry in women with preeclampsia. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy women with preeclampsia were prospectively recruited. Radial pulse waveforms were obtained and the aortic waveforms constructed. The arterial compliance surrogates, augmentation pressure (AP) and augmentation index (AIx-75), were derived from the aortic waveform and then compared: prior to MgSO4 (t1), 1 hour after MgSO4 bolus (t2), 4 hours after MgSO4 infusion (t3), and 24 hours after MgSO4 cessation (t4). Statistical analysis was performed using differences of least squared means with Tukey Kramer adjustments. RESULTS: The AP and AIx-75 at t2-t4 were significantly lower compared with t1, with the greatest decrease in arterial stiffness at t3 (P&lt;.05). CONCLUSION: In preeclampsia, MgSO4 improved central arterial compliance. This effect was most exaggerated after 4 hours of infusion and remained 24 hours following MgSO4 completion, suggesting either a sustained arterial compliance effect or resolution of the vasoconstrictive effect of preeclampsia.",M1
20421337,"Cardiovascular risk factors and arterial rigidity are similar in asymptomatic normocalcemic and hypercalcemic primary hyperparathyroidism.OBJECTIVE: It is still uncertain whether mild primary hyperparathyroidism (PHPT) carries the same risk for increased cardiovascular (CV) morbidity as the more severe symptomatic form. In recent years, the even more subtle normocalcemic (NC) variant is being increasingly recognized. We sought to compare the prevalence of CV risk factors in patients with NC- and hypercalcemic (HC)-PHPT, and to examine whether they differ on a battery of non-invasive vascular parameters. DESIGN/SUBJECTS/METHODS: A retrospective study of two cohorts of patients with PHPT in a referral center: 32 subjects with NC-PHPT and 81 subjects with HC-PHPT, compared for the presence of clinical and biochemical risk factors, and CV morbidity. Non-invasive parameters of arterial stiffness (augmentation index; pulse wave velocity; and vascular <e>compliance</e> indices, C1 and C2) were extracted from the data of gender- and age-matched subsets of these patients, and were related to those of a group of matched control subjects. RESULTS: Despite a similar prevalence of hypertension (approximately 62%), hyperlipidemia (approximately 30%), and impaired glucose metabolism in both PHPT groups, CV or cerebrovascular disease was more common in the HC-PHPT group (24.7 vs 3.1%, P=0.007). Arterial stiffness parameters did not differ in the three groups, and were unrelated to serum calcium or parathyroid hormone concentration. CONCLUSIONS: NC-PHPT and HC-PHPT subjects exhibit similar high rates of traditional CV risk factors, and have comparable indices of arterial stiffness. The lower clinical CV morbidity observed with NC-PHPT remains unexplained, and requires confirmation. Until then, the CV risk associated with NC-PHPT should not be underestimated.",M1
20415700,"Pulse wave velocity and augmentation index, but not intima-media thickness, are early indicators of vascular damage in hypercholesterolemic children.BACKGROUND: Arterial stiffness is an important determinant of cardiovascular risk. It is associated with several cardiovascular risk factors, including hypertension, diabetes and cigarette smoking. However, there are conflicting data about the relationship between arterial stiffness and hypercholesterolemia. Furthermore, augmentation index (AIx), a measure of systemic arterial stiffness, has not been previously investigated in hypercholesterolemic (HCh) children. Aim of our study was to evaluate local and systemic arterial stiffness as well as carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) in HCh children and also to investigate the relation between serum cholesterol levels and arterial stiffness. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We determined lipid profile, body mass index, blood pressure, heart rate, carotid IMT and several arterial stiffness parameters, as beta-index, elastic modulus (E(p)), arterial <e>compliance</e> (AC), pulse wave velocity (PWV) and AIx, in 44 untreated HCh children (mean age 10.7 +/- 2.8 years; 18 with familial hypercholesterolemia, FH, and 26 with primary hypercholesterolemia, PHC) and 18 age- and sex-matched controls. HCh children never received any medication, including antihypertensive and lipid lowering drugs. RESULTS: Respect to controls and to PHC, FH had significantly higher (P &lt; 0.001) beta-index (5.22 +/- 1.13 vs. 3.13 +/- 0.74 and 3.60 +/- 1.02), PWV (4.72 +/- 0.72 m s(-1) vs. 3.66 +/- 0.55 m s(-1) and 4.10 +/- 0.67 m s(-1)), AIx (3.55 +/- 3.97% vs. -4.43 +/- 4.09% and 0.61 +/- 2.39%) and E(p) (64.4 +/- 19.6 kPa vs. 36.2 +/- 11.3 kPa and 42.9 +/- 13.1), whereas AC (1.25 +/- 0.48 mm(2) kPa(-1) vs. 1.9 +/- 0.43 mm(2) kPa(-1) and 1.62 +/- 0.43 mm(2) kPa(-1)) was lower (P &lt; 0.001). There was no significant difference in carotid IMT and blood pressure values between the groups. The multiple regression analysis showed a significant association of arterial stiffness values with plasma cholesterol levels (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Our findings show that local and systemic arterial stiffness are increased in asymptomatic, normotensive HCh children, suggesting that HCh plays a key role in arterial mechanical impairment since the paediatric age.",M1
20400137,"Detrusor <e>compliance</e> changes after bladder neck sling without augmentation in children with neurogenic urinary incontinence.PURPOSE: We reviewed preoperative, and initial and final postoperative urodynamic testing in consecutive children undergoing bladder neck sling without augmentation for neurogenic urinary incontinence to determine if progressive loss of compliance occurs. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We assessed consecutive patients with neurogenic outlet incompetence who underwent 360-degree tight fascial wrap around the bladder neck with appendicovesicostomy but no augmentation. This population comprised all patients undergoing outlet surgery between 2002 and 2007. Inclusion criteria were initial urodynamic test within 1 year postoperatively and final urodynamic test at least 18 months postoperatively. RESULTS: A total of 26 patients met inclusion criteria. Most patients (73%) had an acontractile bladder with detrusor pressures less than 25 cm H(2)O preoperatively. Initial postoperative urodynamic test at a mean of 7 months was most predictive of subsequent urodynamic findings. Eight patients (31%) had increased detrusor pressures and/or uninhibited contractions postoperatively. Six patients increased anticholinergic therapy dose. At a mean of 39 months urodynamic patterns were either stable or improved in all patients. CONCLUSIONS: Progressive compliance loss was not observed after bladder neck sling without augmentation. Postoperative increases in detrusor pressure and/or uninhibited contractions within 1 year postoperatively should prompt review of anticholinergic therapy rather than enterocystoplasty.",M1
20368218,"Elastic properties and structure of the radial artery in patients with type 2 diabetes.Alterations of elastic properties may contribute to the accelerated atherosclerosis in patients with T2D. Little is known, however, about radial artery distensibility in this patient group. A total of 19 patients with T2D and 19 controls were investigated.An echotracking system coupled to a plethysmograph was used to assess the morphologic and elastic properties of radial artery. Distensibility and <e>compliance</e> were evaluated using Langewouters' equations. Distensibility and compliance did not differ significantly in patients with diabetes compared with controls. In contrast, radial IMT and WCSA were significantly higher in patients with T2D than in controls. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant association between SBP and IMT (r(2) = 0.40, p&lt;0.001) as well as WCSA (r = 0.54; r(2) = 0.30; p&lt;0.001 ) in individuals with diabetes. In conclusion, distensibility and compliance of the radial artery are not reduced in patients with T2D. In contrast, radial IMT and WCSA are significantly higher in patients with T2D than in controls.These modifications are chiefly and positively related to SBP.",M1
20363422,"Endoscopic balloon dilation for obstructive colorectal cancer: a basic study on morphologic and pathologic features associated with perforation.BACKGROUND: The use of endoscopic dilation and a self-expandable stent for colorectal cancer (CRC) presenting with a stricture or obstruction, either prior to surgery or as a palliative measure (an alternative to colostomy), causes perforation with relative high incidence (1%-17%). OBJECTIVE: To experimentally investigate risk factors associated with perforation in excised CRC specimens. DESIGN: Experimental study. SETTING: Ex vivo experiment on freshly excised human colon cancer specimens at an academic hospital. PATIENTS: This study involved 47 patients with strictured CRCs of &lt;15 mm in internal diameter as assessed by a preoperative contrast enema. INTERVENTION: Immediately after surgical resection, a balloon with a diameter of 18 mm was placed in the stricture. The balloon was inflated slowly with hydrostatic pressure over 1 minute and kept at the maximum diameter for 1 minute. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS: Correlations between macroscopic perforation and 20 items, including morphological and histopathological characteristics. RESULTS: Perforation occurred in 8 of 47 (17.0%) CRC specimens. Four items showed statistically significant (P &lt; .05) correlations with perforation: peritumoral proliferation of collagen fibers (relative area &gt; or =23.9% in the visual field), annularity of the tumor, severe stricture (&lt;7.9 mm), and fewer residual smooth muscle cells in the muscularis propria, reflecting tumor encroachment. The best predictor of perforation was a combination of severe stricture and pronounced peritumoral proliferation of collagen fibers. LIMITATIONS: An uncontrolled study with a small number of patients. CONCLUSION: Histopathological and morphological items associated with a decrease in elastic <e>compliance</e> were more important as predictors of perforation than dilation procedure parameters, such as balloon pressure.",M1
20331827,"Venous elastography: validation of a novel high-resolution ultrasound method for measuring vein <e>compliance</e> using finite element analysis.Ultrasonography for the noninvasive assessment of tissue properties has enjoyed widespread success. With the growing emphasis in recent years on arteriovenous fistulae (AVFs) for dialysis vascular access in patients with end-stage renal disease, and on reducing AVF failures, there is increasing interest in ultrasound for the preoperative evaluation of the mechanical and elastic properties of arteries and veins. This study used high-resolution ultrasound with phase-sensitive speckle tracking to obtain in vivo vein elasticity measurements during dilation. The results of this novel ultrasound technique were then compared to a computer model of venous strain. The computer model and ultrasound analysis of the vessel wall demonstrated internally consistent positive and negative longitudinal strain values as the vein wall underwent dilation. These results support further investigation of the use of phase-sensitive speckle tracking for ultrasound venous mapping for preoperative vascular access evaluation.",M1
20206806,"Gender and ethnic differences in arterial <e>compliance</e> in patients with intermittent claudication.OBJECTIVE: To assess the gender and ethnic differences in arterial compliance in patients with intermittent claudication. METHODS: A total of 114 patients participated, including 38 Caucasian men, 32 Caucasian women, 16 African American men, and 28 African American women. Patients were assessed on large artery elasticity index (LAEI), small artery elasticity index (SAEI), age, weight, body mass index, ankle-brachial index (ABI), smoking status, and metabolic syndrome components. RESULTS: Group differences were found for LAEI (P = .042), SAEI (P = .019), body mass index (P = .020), prevalence of elevated fasting glucose (P = .001), and prevalence of abdominal obesity (P = .025). Significant covariates for LAEI included age (P = .0002) and elevated triglycerides (P = .0719). LAEI (units = 10 mL x mm Hg) adjusted for age and triglycerides was 39% lower (P = .0005) in African Americans (11.4 +/- .90; mean +/- SE) than in Caucasians (15.8 +/- 0.72), whereas no significant difference (P = .7904) existed between men (13.8 +/- 0.81) and women (13.5 +/- 0.79). Significant covariates for SAEI included age (P = .0001), abdominal obesity (P = .0030), and elevated blood pressure (P = .0067). SAEI (units = 100 mL x mm Hg) adjusted for age, abdominal obesity, and elevated blood pressure was 32% lower (P = .0007) in African-Americans (2.8 +/- 0.3) than in Caucasians 4.1 +/- 0.2), and was 18% lower (P = .0442) in women (3.1 +/- 0.2) than in men (3.8 +/- 0.2). CONCLUSION: African American patients with intermittent claudication have more impaired macrovascular and microvascular function than Caucasian patients, and women have more impaired microvascular function than men. These ethnic and gender differences in arterial compliance are evident even though ABI was similar among groups, suggesting that arterial compliance provides unique information to quantify vascular impairment in patients with intermittent claudication.",M1
20191813,"[A model for studying arterial stiffness in essential arterial hypertension]Arterial stiffness (AS) is a complex parameter, which can be assessed by non-invasive methods. Our study demonstrates the usefulness of an integrative model for measuring the components of the AS. MATERIAL AND METHOD: The AS was prospectively studied before and after 6 and 12 months of antihypertensive treatment in 92 hypertensive patients and 50 matched normotensives. The studied parameters were pulse wave velocity (PWV), pulse pressure, indices of vascular <e>compliance</e> assessed by vascular ultrasound (b index and strain) and the systolic volume index/PP ratio (SVI/PP). RESULTS: All parameters of AS have a favourable evolution after 12 months of antihypertensive treatment and the normalization of the blood pressure. The central parameters have a different behavior compared with the peripheral AS, probably in relation with the arterial structure. The ratio SVI/PP is useful for studying the ventricular-arterial coupling. CONCLUSION: An integrative model for studying AS and a prospective follow-up is useful and necessary in essential arterial hypertension.",M1
20180777,"Obesity and arterial <e>compliance</e> alterations.Obesity is associated with increased cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk, especially when excess body fat is distributed preferentially within the abdominal region. Obese subjects usually have increased arterial stiffness compared with non-obese subjects of similar age. The factors associated with increased arterial stiffness in obesity include endothelial dysfunction (decreased nitric oxide bioavailability), impaired smooth muscle cell function, insulin resistance, as well as elevated cholesterol and C-peptide levels. Furthermore, visceral fat, the adipose tissue-related renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system and hyperleptinaemia contribute to the obesity-associated impaired arterial compliance. Weight loss improves CVD risk factors and arterial compliance. Because increased arterial stiffness is a marker of CVD risk these findings support the concept that the presence of obesity has vascular implications.",M1
20154185,"The influence of tendon <e>compliance</e> on muscle power output and efficiency during cyclic contractions.Muscle power output and efficiency during cyclical contractions are influenced by the timing and duration of stimulation of the muscle and the interaction of the muscle with its mechanical environment. It has been suggested that tendon compliance may reduce the energy required for power production from the muscle by reducing the required shortening of the muscle fibres. Theoretically this may allow the muscle to maintain both high power output and efficiency during cyclical contraction; however, this has yet to be demonstrated experimentally. To investigate how tendon compliance might act to increase muscle power output and/or efficiency, we attached artificial tendons of varying compliance to muscle fibre bundles in vitro and measured power output and mechanical efficiency during stretch-shorten cycles (2 Hz) with a range of stretch amplitudes and stimulation patterns. The results showed that peak power, average power output and efficiency (none of which can have direct contributions from the compliant tendon) all increased with increasing tendon compliance, presumably due to the tendon acting to minimise muscle energy use by allowing the muscle fibres to shorten at optimal speeds. Matching highly compliant tendons with a sufficiently large amplitude length change and appropriate stimulation pattern significantly increased the net muscle efficiency compared with stiff tendons acting at the same frequency. The maximum efficiency for compliant tendons was also similar to the highest value measured under constant velocity and force conditions, which suggests that tendon compliance can maximise muscle efficiency in the conditions tested here. These results provide experimental evidence that during constrained cyclical contractions, muscle power and efficiency can be enhanced with compliant tendons.",M1
20094955,"Ureterocystoplasty: an ideal method for vesical augmentation in children.BACKGROUND: Inadequate therapy endangers upper urinary tract function in children with low <e>compliance</e> bladders. We report our approach of increasing bladder compliance using the patients own (mega)-ureter for bladder augmentation. PATIENTS: A total of 8 children underwent ureterocystoplasty. The etiology of bladder non-compliance and the need for augmentation was neurogenic in 5 children, posterior urethral valves in 2 children and in one child the situation after repeated antireflux surgery. In all patients the kidney of the used ureter was functionless. Surgery was done through a transperitoneal approach. After nephrectomy, the renal pelvis and the ureter were spatulated and sutured into the bladder incision. An additional MACE stoma was made in 3 patients, antireflux surgery for the contralateral kidney was necessary in 2 patients and one patient underwent stone removal in the remaining kidney. In 1 patient the ureter was used as a free transplant and was covered by an omental flap. In addition, a simultaneous living donor kidney transplant was performed (case 2). RESULTS: Bladder capacity and compliance improved significantly in all patients. The function of the ureter which was used as a free transplant showed good clinical results. The longest follow-up is 8 years. CONCLUSION: Ureterocystoplasty is a useful and metabolically neutral alternative to bowel segments. In patients with only one functioning kidney and a contralateral megaureter, ureterocystoplasty is the treatment of choice in our institution.",M1
20090775,"A comparison of methods for assessing total arterial <e>compliance</e>.There are several methods of assessing total arterial compliance (TAC) based on the two element Windkessel model, which is a ratio of pressure and volume, but the optimal technique is unclear. In this study, three methods of estimating TAC were compared to determine which was the most robust in a large group of patients with and without cardiovascular risk. In all, 320 patients (170 men; age 55+/-10) were studied; TAC was determined by the pulse-pressure method (PPM), the area method (AM) and the stroke volume/pulse-pressure method (SVPP). We obtained arterial waveforms using radial applanation tonometry, dimensions using two-dimensional echocardiography and flow data by Doppler. Clinical data, risk factors, echo parameters and TAC by all three methods were then compared. TAC (ml mm Hg(-1)) by the PPM was 1.24+/-0.51, by the AM 1.84+/-0.90 and by the SVPP 1.96+/-0.76 (P&lt;0.0001 between groups). Correlation was good between all methods: PPM/AM r=0.83, PPM/SVPP r=0.94 and AM/SVPP r=0.80 (all P&lt;0.0001). Subgroup analysis showed significant differences between patients with and those without cardiovascular risk for all three methods; TAC-AM and TAC-SVPP values were similar and significantly higher than TAC-PPM. The only significant relationships observed with TAC and echo parameters were in left ventricular (LV) septal thickness (R(2)=0.07; P&lt;0.0001) and LV mass (R(2)=0.04; P=0.004). Normal and abnormal values of TAC vary according to method, which should be expressed. Each of the techniques shows good correlation with each other, however, values for TAC-PPM are significantly lower. TAC-PPM and TAC-SVPP are comparable in determining differences between groups with and without cardiovascular risk.",M1
20051902,"Central arterial pulse wave augmentation is greater in girls than boys, independent of height.OBJECTIVES: Central arterial pulse wave augmentation, quantified by the augmentation index (AIx), is a key marker of arterial health, an important contributor to cardiac afterload and is significantly greater in older women than men. We measured carotid AIx in 8-year-old children to examine the influences of sex, height and arterial stiffness on central arterial pulse wave augmentation METHODS: Four hundred and five children (age 8.0 +/- 0.1 years, 49% girls) had anthropometry, brachial systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and carotid artery pressure waveforms (by applanation tonometry), diastolic diameter and distensibility assessed. RESULTS: Carotid AIx was significantly higher in girls than boys (-11.7 +/- 8.1 versus -16.5 +/- 9.3%, respectively, P &lt; 0.001). Boys and girls had similar height (129 +/- 6 versus 128 +/- 6 cm), systolic blood pressure (100 +/- 7 versus 101 +/- 7 mmHg), diastolic blood pressure (59 +/- 6 versus 60 +/- 5 mmHg) and heart rate (80 +/- 10 versus 82 +/- 10 bpm). Carotid diastolic diameter was smaller in girls than boys (0.45 +/- 0.03 versus 0.47 +/- 0.04 cm, P &lt; 0.001). The sex difference in AIx remained significant after adjustment for height, heart rate, blood pressure, diastolic diameter and birth weight. The time to the onset of the reflected wave was shorter in girls (155 +/- 19 versus 163 +/- 18 ms, P &lt; 0.001). Girls had greater carotid artery distensibility (6.2 +/- 1.8 versus 5.8 +/- 1.5% per 10 mmHg, P = 0.016), suggesting lower regional carotid artery stiffness. CONCLUSION: Greater pulse wave augmentation in prepubertal girls results from earlier wave reflection and is independent of height, carotid artery diameter and stiffness. When combined with age-related changes in arterial <e>compliance</e>, this may contribute to adverse cardiovascular outcomes in older women.",M1
20035992,"Long term performance of small-diameter vascular grafts made of a poly(ether)urethane-polydimethylsiloxane semi-interpenetrating polymeric network.In the past years considerable research efforts have been directed at developing more suitable synthetic vascular grafts, but small-diameter vascular grafts (SDVGs) perform less well than autogenous arterial or venous grafts. Grafts such as Dacron and ePTFE have often been used as alternatives to autologous grafts, but they have shown poor patency rates when used in small-diameter sizes or low-flow locations. Nevertheless, despite these efforts no alternative concepts have emerged yet that promises to replace the current generation of synthetic grafts soon. The purpose of this preliminary in vivo study was to assess the blood and tissue compatibility behaviors of a novel compliant SDVGs, fabricated with a poly(ether)urethane-polydimethylsiloxane (PEtU-PDMS) semi-interpenetrating polymeric network (semi-IPN) and featuring two different porous layers in the wall thickness. Grafts were implanted according to anastomotic techniques which emulate the flow conditions clinically adopted for peripheral or aorto-coronary bypass procedures. Relatively long grafts were implanted in the common carotid artery of adult sheep and compared to standard ePTFE grafts of the same size and length implanted controlaterally.

Forty-three obese, hypertensive African Americans (mean BP: systolic, 148.8+/-14.3 mm Hg; diastolic, 90.4+/-8.2 mm Hg) were treated with nebivolol (5-10 mg/d) for 8 weeks. Primary outcomes were change in systolic and diastolic BP and efficacy in reaching normotensive BP. Mean systolic BP decreased by 9.2+/-14 mm Hg (P&lt;.005) and diastolic BP decreased 6.8+/-9 mm Hg (P&lt;.005) with 8 weeks of therapy. Significant improvements were seen in arterial compliance with nebivolol treatment as measured by aortic augmentation index (P&lt;.005) and time to wave reflection (P=.013). Nebivolol treatment improved endothelial function as measured by flow-mediated dilation (P&lt;.005). Levels of erythrocyte cellular superoxide dismutase increased with nebivolol, indirectly suggesting increased bioavailability of nitric oxide (P&lt;.005). Monotherapy with nebivolol in obese, hypertensive African Americans results in significant systolic and diastolic BP reduction by mechanisms that include improved vascular function and compliance.",M1

19997578,"Vascular health in children and adolescents: effects of obesity and diabetes.The foundations for cardiovascular disease in adults are laid in childhood and accelerated by the presence of comorbid conditions, such as obesity, diabetes, hypertension, and dyslipidemia. Early detection of vascular dysfunction is an important clinical objective to identify those at risk for subsequent cardiovascular morbidity and events, and to initiate behavioral and medical interventions to reduce risk. Typically, cardiovascular screening is recommended for young adults, especially in people with a family history of cardiovascular conditions. Children and adolescents were once considered to be at low risk, but with the growing health concerns related to sedentary lifestyle, poor diet and obesity, cardiovascular screening may be needed earlier so that interventions to improve cardiovascular health can be initiated. This review describes comorbid conditions that increase cardiovascular risk in youth, namely obesity and diabetes, and describes noninvasive methods to objectively detect vascular disease and quantify vascular function and structure through measurements of endothelial function, arterial <e>compliance</e>, and intima-media thickness. Additionally, current strategies directed toward prevention of vascular disease in these populations, including exercise, dietary interventions and pharmacological therapy are described.",M1
19964916,"Thermo-mechanical characterization of polypyrrole <e>compliance</e> using stochastic system identification.Conducting polymers such as polypyrrole are studied as novel biologically inspired actuators. Their capacity to generate stresses of up to 5 MPa, strains of up to 10% at low voltages (2 V) make them ideal candidates to be used as artificial muscle materials. It has been shown that the modulus of polypyrrole can change when the material is electrochemically excited. In this paper we develop a technique that uses a stochastic stress input that can be used to measure the compliance frequency response (between 10(-2) Hz and 100 Hz) of polypyrrole in-situ. We validate the compliance calculated from the stochastic stress input by comparing it with the compliance calculated from a single sinusoidal stress input. We also measure the compliance as a function of temperature using both techniques and show that the stochastic compliance follows the same trends as the compliance calculated from single sinusoidal stress input.",M1
19962188,"Physiologic <e>compliance</e> in engineered small-diameter arterial constructs based on an elastomeric substrate.Compliance mismatch is a significant challenge to long-term patency in small-diameter bypass grafts because it causes intimal hyperplasia and ultimately graft occlusion. Current engineered grafts are typically stiff with high burst pressure but low compliance and low elastin expression. We postulated that engineering small arteries on elastomeric scaffolds under dynamic mechanical stimulation would result in strong and compliant arterial constructs. This study compares properties of engineered arterial constructs based on biodegradable polyester scaffolds composed of either rigid poly(lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) or elastomeric poly(glycerol sebacate) (PGS). Adult baboon arterial smooth muscle cells (SMCs) were cultured in vitro for 10 days in tubular, porous scaffolds. Scaffolds were significantly stronger after culture regardless of material, but the elastic modulus of PLGA constructs was an order of magnitude greater than that of porcine carotid arteries and PGS constructs. Deformation was elastic in PGS constructs and carotid arteries but plastic in PLGA constructs. Compliance of arteries and PGS constructs were equivalent at pressures tested. Altering scaffold material from PLGA to PGS significantly decreased collagen content and significantly increased insoluble elastin content in constructs without affecting soluble elastin concentration in the culture medium. PLGA constructs contained no appreciable insoluble elastin. This research demonstrates that: (1) substrate stiffness directly affects in vitro tissue development and mechanical properties; (2) rigid materials likely inhibit elastin incorporation into the extracellular matrix of engineered arterial tissues; and (3) grafts with physiologic compliance and significant elastin content can be engineered in vitro after only days of cell culture.",M1
19812923,"Clinical proof of the importance of <e>compliance</e> for hydrocephalus pathophysiology.INTRODUCTION: Recently decreased compliance is discussed as an initially disturbed CSF hydrodynamic parameter in hydrocephalus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In 180 patients with suspected chronic hydrocephalus we performed a dynamic infusion test, which was not used for shunt indication. Shunt indication was based on long-term ICP monitoring. Follow-up was 4.6 +/- 1.8 years. Statistics: Spearman-, Kruskal-Wallis-, Wilcoxen-U-test. RESULTS: Resistance to outflow (Rout) and Pressure Volume Index (PVI) alone provide positive predictive values (PPV) and sensitivity, which might be sufficient in daily practice, while negative predictive values (NPV) and specificity are weak. With an intelligent combined algorithm of Rout and PVI at a critical value of ROF of 13 mm Hg/ml x min and 30 ml, a clearly improved outcome prediction is possible.

Impaired pulsatile arterial function is also an independent predictor of early vascular damage and related CV outcome. However, information is scant regarding the influence of low birth weight on pulsatile arterial function. METHODS: The study cohort consisted of 538 black and white subjects (29% black, 42% male) aged 18-44 years (mean 36.7 years) enrolled in the Bogalusa Heart Study. Subjects were categorized into low birth weight and normal birth weight. Pulsatile arterial function was assessed in terms of large artery <e>compliance</e>, small artery compliance, and systemic vascular resistance by noninvasive radial artery pressure pulse contour analysis. RESULTS: Blacks and females had significantly lower birth weight compared to their counterparts. Low vs. normal birth weight group had lower large artery compliance (13.3 ml/mm Hg x 10 vs. 15.5 ml/mm Hg x 10, P = 0.0002). Further, after adjusting for age, race, and sex, the large artery compliance increased across quartiles of increasing birth weight specific for race, sex, and gestational age (P for trend = 0.03). In multivariate regression model, adding race, sex, age, body surface area, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio one by one, the effect was attenuated but significant (beta = -0.067, P = 0.033). CONCLUSIONS: The observed deleterious association of low birth weight on arterial wall dynamics in asymptomatic younger adults may account in part for the adverse CV risk in the Bogalusa sample.",M1
19941329,"Effects of mechanical left ventricular unloading by Impella on left ventricular dynamics in high-risk and primary percutaneous coronary intervention patients.OBJECTIVES: We studied online left ventricular (LV) dynamic effects of mechanical LV unloading directly after percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). BACKGROUND: Limited clinical information is available on the direct LV dynamic consequences of LV unloading in patients undergoing high-risk PCI and primary PCI for acute ST-elevation myocardial infarction. METHODS: The effects of the Impella LP2.5 device on LV dynamics were studied in 11 patients (elective high-risk PCI, n = 6; primary PCI, n = 5). LV pressure and volume were continuously assessed by a pressure-conductance catheter at 4 different support levels of the Impella, from 0 L/min at baseline to 2.5 L/min at maximal support. RESULTS: The response to increased LV unloading was not different between both groups of patients. The pooled data showed no change on global and systolic LV function during increased LV unloading, while diastolic function showed improvement as indicated by an increased LV <e>compliance</e> in all patients. There was a decrease in end-diastolic pressure from 22 +/- 12 to 13 +/- 9 mm Hg (P = 0.0001), in end-diastolic elastance from 0.134 +/- 0.060 to 0.091 +/- 0.064 mm Hg/mL (P = 0.009), and in end-diastolic wall stress from 84 +/- 50 to 47 +/- 39 mm Hg (P = 0.004). CONCLUSIONS: LV unloading decreases end-diastolic wall stress and improves diastolic compliance dose-dependently. Our results indicate beneficial LV unloading effects of Impella during high-risk and primary PCI.",M1
19929686,"The role of vascular and interstitial <e>compliance</e> and vascular volume in the regulation of blood volume in two species of anuran.The objectives of this study were (1) to measure plasma (V(p)), blood (V(b)), extracellular (V(e)), and interstitial fluid (V(ist)) volumes using the same techniques; (2) to measure the rate of plasma turnover; and (3) to characterize the three important variables required to interpret transvascular flux at an organismal level (vascular compliance [C(vas)], interstitial compliance [C(ist)], and the whole-body transvascular filtration coefficient [F(c)]) in two species of anurans that differ in their capacity to regulate blood volume during dehydrational and hemorrhagic stress. The disappearance curve of Evans blue-labeled native plasma protein fitted a two-component exponential decay model for both species, indicating that plasma proteins exchanged quickly between two kinetically distinct compartments, V(p) and V(e). V(p) calculated using serial sampling times &lt;10 min were 61.0 mL kg(-1) for Chaunus marinus and 40.5 mL kg(-1) for Lithobates catesbeiana. Plasma turnover rate was 3% of V(p) min(-1) (1.8 mL min(-1) kg(-1)) for C. marinus and 5.5% of V(p) min(-1) (2.2 mL min(-1) kg(-1)) for L. catesbeiana. Chaunus marinus also had significantly greater V(b) (84 to 53 mL kg(-1)), V(ist) (171 to 154 mL kg(-1)), and V(e) (232 to 195 mL kg(-1)) than L. catesbeiana. C(vas) was significantly greater in C. marinus (47.3 mL kPa(-1) kg(-1)) compared with L. catesbeiana (27.7 mL kPa(-1) kg(-1)). This difference reflects the interspecific differences in V(b) because vascular distensibilities are similar (0.5% kPa(-1)). There were no interspecific differences in the C(ist) (500 mL kPa(-1) kg(-1)) or F(c) (2.5 mL kg(-1) kPa(-1) min(-1) filtration calculation; 0.2-0.5 mL kPa(-1) kg(-1) min(-1) fit to volume change data). Functionally, these circulatory/interstitial exchange variables of both anuran species exemplify a circulatory system with high rates of filtration (lymph formation) and with no capacity for transcapillary fluid uptake, hence requiring substantial lymphatic return to maintain vascular volume. The large C(ist) of both species provides a capacity to store extravascular volume with little perturbation of vascular pressure, but the resulting low interstitial pressures would create difficulties for extravascular fluid return to the dorsally located lymph hearts. The principal interspecific differences of greater V(b), V(p), V(ist), and C(vas) for the more terrestrial species, C. marinus, would stabilize cardiac function during hypovolemia (e.g., hemorrhage) and increase resistance to dehydration. This is consistent with this species' enhanced capacity to manage dehydrational and hemorrhagic challenges to blood volume regulation compared to L. catesbeiana.",M1
19918895,"Comparative study of carpal tunnel <e>compliance</e> in the human, dog, rabbit, and rat.The purpose of this study was to measure the compliance of the carpal tunnel in candidate animal models of carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS), by measuring the resistance when passing a tapered metal rod through the carpal tunnel. Forepaws from 10 dogs, 10 rabbits, and 10 rats with intact carpal tunnels, and 10 fresh frozen human wrist cadavers were used. The slopes of the linear part of the force-displacement curve (a measure of stiffness), normal force, and increasing area ratio (InAR) were significantly different among the four species (p&lt;0.05). Post hoc analysis indicated that the mean slopes for the human carpal tunnel were the largest, indicating the least compliance, whereas those of the rat were the least (p&lt;0.05). The features of the compliance for the dog carpal tunnel were closest to the human. The development of animal models of CTS should consider the compliance of the carpal tunnel, as it will be more difficult to increase pressure in a more compliant tunnel.",M1
19914025,"Modification of the descending thoracic aortic anastomotic site using biodegradable felt: study in a canine model with or without basic fibroblast growth factor.OBJECTIVES: We investigated the outcomes of reinforcing anastomotic sites using (1) nonbiodegradable polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) felt, (2) biodegradable polyglycolic acid (PGA) felt, and (3) PGA felt with basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) in a canine descending thoracic aortic replacement model. METHODS: Thirty-seven beagles underwent descending thoracic aorta replacement using a prosthetic graft with one of the above-mentioned reinforcements or no reinforcement for controls. Histologic evaluations were carried out 1 month and 3 months after surgery. The biomechanical strength of the anastomosis was assessed along the longitudinal axis of the aortic segments using a tensile tester. Local <e>compliance</e> at the anastomotic site was also evaluated in the circumferential direction. RESULTS: The media was significantly thinner in the PTFE group than in the control group (65.8% +/- 5.1% vs 95.0% +/- 9.3% of normal thickness; P &lt; .05). Relative to the control group, the adventitial layer was significantly thinner in the PTFE group (42.3% +/- 8.2% of control; P &lt; .05) but significantly thicker in the PGA and the PGA + bFGF groups (117.2% +/- 11.3% and 134.1% +/- 14.2% of control, respectively; P &lt; .05). There were more vessels in the adventitial layer in the PGA + bFGF group than in the control, PTFE, and PGA groups (29.2 +/- 2.1/mm(2) vs 13.8 +/- 0.8, 5.4 +/- 0.7, 17.0 +/- 1.3/mm(2), respectively; P &lt; .01). There were no significant differences between the four groups in the failure force at anastomotic sites. Local compliance at the anastomotic site was higher in the PGA group than that in the PTFE group (11.6 +/- 1.6 10(-6) m(2)/N vs 5.6 +/- 1.9 10(-6) m(2)/N; P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: Reinforcement of the experimental aortic wall with PTFE felt resulted in thinning of the media and adventitia and fewer vessels at the anastomotic site. These histologic changes were not observed when biodegradable felt was used. The bFGF failed to augment the modification of the aortic wall with the exception of increased adventitial vessel number. Biomechanical strength of the anastomosis along the longitudinal axis was comparable in all four groups; however, local vascular compliance was better in the biodegradable PGA felt group.",M1
19911238,"Esophagogastric junction distensibility after fundoplication assessed with a novel functional luminal imaging probe.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to compare the esophagogastric junction (EGJ) <e>compliance</e> in response to controlled distension in fundoplication (FP) patients and controls using the functional luminal imaging probe (FLIP). BACKGROUND: FP aims to replicate normal EGJ distensibility. FLIP is a new technology that uses impedance planimetry to measure intraluminal cross-sectional area (CSA) during controlled distension. METHODS: Ten controls and ten FP patients were studied with high-resolution esophageal pressure topography (HREPT) and then the FLIP placed across the EGJ. Deglutitive and interdeglutitive EGJ distensibility was assessed with volume-controlled distension. The FLIP measured eight CSAs spaced 4 mm apart within a cylindrical saline-filled bag along with the corresponding intrabag pressure. RESULTS: The EGJ formed an hourglass shape during distensions with the central constriction at the diaphragmatic hiatus. The distensibility of the hiatus was significantly greater during deglutitive relaxation in both subject groups, but FP patients exhibited reduced EGJ distensibility and compliance compared to controls. During the interglutitive period, the corresponding increase in intrabag pressures at larger volumes were also greater in FP patients implying a longer segment of EGJ constriction. The EGJ distensibility characteristics did not correlate with HREPT measures. CONCLUSIONS: FLIP technology was used to compare EGJ distensibility in FP patients and control subjects. The least distensible locus within the EGJ was always at the hiatus. EGJ distensibility was significantly reduced, and the length of constriction increased in FP patients. Future FLIP studies will compare patients with and without post-FP dysphagia and gas bloat, symptoms suggestive of an overly restrictive FP.",M1
19896128,"Measurement of arterial distensibility and <e>compliance</e> to assess prognosis.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Total arterial compliance (TAC) reflects arterial function in the entire systemic circulation while distensibility coefficient (DC) is an estimate of local arterial compliance obtained from large elastic arteries. There are few studies relating TAC or DC to outcome. We sought whether DC or TAC predicted outcome in a primary prevention cohort with a spectrum of cardiovascular risk. METHODS: Clinical data including blood pressure (BP) and diabetes mellitus (DM) were obtained and Framingham 10-year risk was calculated in 719 primary prevention patients (373 men; age 55+/-11 years). TAC was calculated from applanation tonometry using the pulse-pressure method, 2D-echocardiography and Doppler, and DC was derived from 2D measurements of the common carotid artery and pulse pressure (PP). Cox regression analysis was performed to determine correlates of outcome. RESULTS: There were 42 deaths (5.8%) and 114 cardiovascular admissions (15.8%) over 57 months. The independent correlates of mortality were Framingham 10-year risk (HR=1.69; p&lt;0.0001) and DC (HR=0.54; p=0.02) (model chi-square 24.52; p&lt;0.0001) but not TAC. The independent predictors of the composite outcome of either death or admission for cardiovascular causes were Framingham 10-year risk (HR=1.28; p=0.001) and TAC (HR=0.75; p=0.006) (model chi-square 21.43; p&lt;0.0001) but not DC. CONCLUSIONS: Measurement of arterial function is independently correlated with outcome in patients with varying degrees of cardiovascular risk, and different aspects identify fatal and non-fatal events. In addition, measurement of TAC and DC adds incremental benefit to Framingham risk scores alone in patients with intermediate cardiovascular risk.",M1
19863318,"Value of nasal mucosa congestion index in choosing treatment strategies for chronic rhinosinusitis.CONCLUSION: The mucosa <e>compliance</e> in lesions is determined by the congestion index, enabling us to determine whether the patient is sensitive to pharmacotherapy and to choose surgical management rationally. OBJECTIVE: To explore the correlation between the nasal mucosa congestion index and tissue remodeling in chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) and to provide objective evidence for clinical choice of therapeutic methods. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Forty-four patients with CRS who underwent nasal endoscopic surgery were enrolled in the study. The congestion indexes of the nasal mucosa were measured using an acoustic rhinometer and specimens were taken from the uncinate process mucosa to evaluate vascular density and degree of fibrosis. The correlations were statistically analyzed. RESULTS: There was an inverse correlation between the congestion index and degree of fibrosis (r=- 0.522, p=0.00) and a direct correlation between the congestion index and vascular density (r=0.838, p=0.00) in nasal mucosa. There was a significant correlation between the congestion index and the combination of degree of fibrosis and vascular density with a determination coefficient (R(2)) of 0.778.",M1
19836611,"Relations between a novel, reliable, and rapid index of arterial <e>compliance</e> (PP-HDI) and well-established inidices of arterial blood pressure (ABP) in a sample of hypertensive elderly subjects.Hypertension is a risk factor for a long-lasting arterial wall-remodelling leading to stiffness. The rapid method measuring the pulse pressure (PP) by means of the tool of Hypertension Diagnostic Instruments (HDI) called PP-HDI, overcomes some of the problems arising with more-time consuming methods, like ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM), and give information about the elasticity of the arterial walls. We studied the relationship between the PP-HDI, the large artery compliance (LA-C) and small artery compliance (SA-C) and few well-established indices of arterial blood pressure (ABP) in a sample of 75 hypertensive subjects, aged 65 years and over. Significant correlations between LA-C and heart rate (HR), PP-ABPM and PP-HDI were found. SA-C relates with HR and systolic blood pressure (SBP) measured in lying and standing positions. Applying a stepwise regression analysis, we found that LA-C variance stems from PP-HDI and HR, while SA-C variance stems from SBP in lying position. Receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves for thresholds of PP showed that PP-HDI reached levels of sensitivity/specificity similar to PP-ABPM. In conclusion, surveillance of ABP through hemo-dynamic indices, in particular of SBP, is essential, nevertheless the advantage of this control is not known in an elderly population where the organ damage is already evident. PP needs necessarily an instrumental measurement. The PP-HDI result is similar in reliability with respect to PPABPM, but is more rapid and well applicable in an elderly population.",M1
19850904,"Discrete contributions of elastic fiber components to arterial development and mechanical <e>compliance</e>.OBJECTIVE: Even though elastin and fibrillin-1 are the major structural components of elastic fibers, mutations in elastin and fibrillin-1 lead to narrowing of large arteries in supravalvular aortic stenosis and dilation of the ascending aorta in Marfan syndrome, respectively. A genetic approach was therefore used here to distinguish the differential contributions of elastin and fibrillin-1 to arterial development and compliance. METHODS AND RESULTS: Key parameters of cardiovascular function were compared among adult mice haploinsufficient for elastin (Eln(+/-)), fibrillin-1 (Fbn1(+/-)), or both proteins (dHet). Physiological and morphological comparisons correlate elastin haploinsufficiency with increased blood pressure and vessel length and tortuosity in dHet mice, and fibrillin-1 haploinsufficiency with increased aortic diameter in the same mutant animals. Mechanical tests confirm that elastin and fibrillin-1 impart elastic recoil and tensile strength to the aortic wall, respectively. Additional ex vivo analyses demonstrate additive and overlapping contributions of elastin and fibrillin-1 to the material properties of vascular tissues. Lastly, light and electron microscopy evidence implicates fibrillin-1 in the hypertension-promoted remodeling of the elastin-deficient aorta. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that elastin and fibrillin-1 have both differential and complementary roles in arterial wall formation and function, and advance our knowledge of the structural determinants of vascular physiology and disease.",M1
19846730,"Left ventricular diastolic function in type 2 diabetes mellitus: prevalence and association with myocardial and vascular disease.BACKGROUND: Although type 2 diabetes mellitus is a risk factor for developing congestive heart failure, the mechanism leading to heart failure is unclear. We examined the prevalence of left ventricular (LV) systolic and diastolic dysfunction in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus in relation to vascular function and myocardial perfusion. METHODS AND RESULTS: A prospective observational study of 305 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (diabetes duration, 4.5+/-5.3 years) referred consecutively to a diabetes clinic were screened for LV systolic and diastolic function by echocardiography. Vascular function was estimated using noninvasive estimation of pulse pressure, carotid arterial <e>compliance</e>, total arterial compliance, and valvulo-arterial impedance. The prevalences of LV diastolic dysfunction and left atrial (LA) volume index &gt;32 mL/m(2) were 40% and 32%, respectively. The prevalence of myocardial ischemia on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was more frequent in patients with grade 2 diastolic dysfunction and LA volume index &gt;32 mL/m(2) compared with those having normal or grade 1 diastolic dysfunction (P=0.002) or LA volume index &lt; or =32 mL/m(2) (P&lt;0.001), respectively. Predictors of grade 2 diastolic dysfunction and LA dilation were summed stress score on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, total arterial compliance, and valvulo-arterial impedance, whereas pulse pressure and carotid arterial compliance were not, after adjusting for age, sex, and diabetes duration. On multivariable modeling, summed stress score (P&lt;0.001) and valvulo-arterial impedance (P=0.027) remained predictors of grade 2 diastolic dysfunction, and only summed stress score (P&lt;0.001) was a predictor of LA dilation. CONCLUSIONS: Abnormal LV filling is closely associated with abnormal myocardial perfusion on myocardial perfusion scintigraphy, whereas the association of LV filling with vascular function is less prominent.",M1
19831474,"A structure-based model of arterial remodeling in response to sustained hypertension.A novel structure-based mathematical model of arterial remodeling in response to a sustained increase in pressure is proposed. The model includes two major aspects of remodeling in a healthy matured vessel. First, the deviation of the wall stress and flow-induced shear stress from their normal physiological values drives the changes in the arterial geometry. Second, the new mass that is produced during remodeling results from an increase in the mass of smooth muscle cells and collagen fibers. The model additionally accounts for the effect of the average pulsatile strain on the recruitment of collagen fibers in load bearing. The model was used to simulate remodeling of a human thoracic aorta, and the results are in good agreement with previously published model predictions and experimental data. The model predicts that the total arterial volume rapidly increases during the early stages of remodeling and remains virtually constant thereafter, despite the continuing stress-driven geometrical remodeling. Moreover, the effects of a perfect or incomplete restoration of the arterial <e>compliance</e> on the remodeling outputs were analyzed. For instance, the model predicts that the pattern of the time course of the opening angle depends on the extent to which the average pulsatile strain is restored at the end of the remodeling process. Future experimental studies on the time course of compliance, opening angle, and mass fractions of collagen, elastin, and smooth muscle cells can validate and improve the introduced hypotheses of the model.",M1
19824999,"Quantitative assessment of radiation-induced fibrosis of the breast with tissue <e>compliance</e> meter, palpation, and radiological imaging: preliminary results.Quantification of radiation (RT)-induced fibrosis (RIF) continues to present a challenge in breast cancer survivors. We compare assessment of RIF by palpation and tissue compliance meter (TCM) to the radiological findings in women treated with RT. Of 300 patients treated with adjuvant RT, 17 women had &gt; or =2-year follow-up sufficient to document RIF. Palpation and TCM were employed by three radiation oncologists in a blinded fashion. Palpation grades 1, 2, and 3 denoted mild, moderate, and severe RIF. TCM measured degree of compliance (DC) of RIF in irradiated (RTB) and nonirradiated breasts (NRTB). Architectural distortions (AD) on mammograms, ultrasound (US), and MRI were assessed. Median time of follow up was 3.9 years (range 2.1-6.5 years). Palpation revealed RIF grades 1, 2, and 3 in four, 10, and three patients, respectively. Mean percent changes (PC) in DC between RTB and NRTB by TCM were 19.5%, 37.1%, and 57.5% for grades 1, 2, and 3 RIF, respectively (p &lt; 0.0001). There was a strong linear correlation between palpation grade and PC of DC by TCM (spearman-rank correlation=0.88, p &lt; 0.0001). Interobserver variability (reliability) was computed using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for TCM and kappa statistic for clinical palpation (ICC=0.99 [p &lt; 0.0001] and kappa=0.70 [p &lt; 0.0001], respectively). There was no correlation between average size of the AD as measured by the imaging modalities and RIF as assessed by palpation or TCM. Our preliminary data suggest that quantification of RIF is best with TCM. TCM results correlate better with palpation than with radiological imaging. The study with larger number of patients required to confirm our findings is underway.",M1

METHODS: Volumetric shrinkage (with a mercury dilatometer), degree of conversion, maximum rate of reaction (RPmax) (with differential scanning calorimetry) and polymerization stress (with a controlled <e>compliance</e> device) were evaluated. Bis-GMA/TEGDMA (equal mass ratios) were mixed with a tertiary amine (EDMAB) and camphorquinone, respectively, in three concentrations (wt%): high = 0.8/1.6; intermediate = 0.4/0.8 and low = 0.2/0.4. 80 wt% filler was added. Composites were photoactivated (400 mW/cm2 x 40 seconds; radiant exposure = l6 J/cm2). A fourth experimental group was included in which the low concentration formulation was exposed for 80 seconds (32 J/cm2). RESULTS: For the same radiant exposure, conversion, RPmax and stress increased with photoinitiator concentration (P &lt; 0.001). When the low concentration group exposed to 32 J/cm2 was compared with the high and intermediate groups (exposed to 16 J/cm2), RPmax still increased with the photoinitiator concentration between all levels (P &lt; 0.001) but conversion and stress did not vary (P &gt; 0.05). Shrinkage did not vary regardless of the photoinitiator concentration or radiant exposure. For the photoinitiator concentrations used in this study. Polymerization stress was influenced by conversion but not by rate of reaction.",M1
19816408,"Differential effects of reduced cyclic stretch and perturbed shear stress within the arterial wall and on smooth muscle function.BACKGROUND: Cyclic circumferential stretch and shear stress act in concert and yet are capable of independently mediating arterial smooth muscle function, modulating the production of superoxide and stimulating arterial remodeling. METHODS: Porcine carotid arteries were perfused ex vivo for 72 h. Groups combining normal (5%) and reduced (1%) stretch with high shear (6 +/- 3 dyn/cm2) and oscillatory shear (0.3 +/- 3 dyn/cm2) stress were created, while maintaining a pulse pressure of 80 +/- 10 mm Hg. RESULTS: Total superoxide production, fibronectin expression, and gelatinase activation were mediated by shear stress, but expression in the endothelial region was mediated by reduced cyclic stretch. By plotting intensity vs. radius, we saw that superoxide and gelatinase activity were in part mediated by stress distributions throughout the vascular wall, whereas fibronectin and p22-phox were much less or not at all. These findings, when coupled with our results from tissue reactive studies, suggest that the arterial remodeling process triggered in the endothelial region due to reduced stretch causes the most significant changes in arterial smooth muscle function. CONCLUSIONS: We have found that the remodeling process triggered by reduced <e>compliance</e> in the endothelial region of large conduit arteries has a more profound detrimental effect to smooth muscle function than that brought on by perturbed shear stress. This work provides new insight by suggesting that although mechanical stimuli such as cyclic stretch and shear stress are known to augment similar markers of vascular remodeling, the location of their expression throughout the vascular wall differs greatly and this can have dramatic effects on vascular function.",M1
19801491,"RC time constant of single lung equals that of both lungs together: a study in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension.The product of resistance, R, and <e>compliance</e>, C (RC time), of the entire pulmonary circulation is constant. It is unknown if this constancy holds for individual lungs. We determined R and C in individual lungs in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) patients where resistances differ between both lungs. Also, the contribution of the proximal pulmonary arteries (PA) to total lung compliance was assessed. Patients (n=23) were referred for the evaluation of CTEPH. Pressure was measured by right heart catheterization and flows in the main, left, and right PA by magnetic resonance imaging. Total, left, and right lung resistances were calculated as mean pressure divided by mean flow. Total, left, and right lung compliances were assessed by the pulse pressure method. Proximal compliances were derived from cross-sectional area change DeltaA and systolic-diastolic pressure difference DeltaP (DeltaA/DeltaP) in main, left, and right PA, multiplied by vessel length. The lung with the lowest blood flow was defined  low flow  (LF), the contralateral lung  high flow  (HF). Total resistance was 0.57+/-0.28 mmHg.s(-1).ml(-1), and resistances of LF and HF lungs were 1.57+/-0.2 vs. 1.00+/-0.1 mmHg.s(-1).ml(-1), respectively, P&lt;0.0001. Total compliance was 1.22+/-1.1 ml/mmHg, and compliances of LF and HF lung were 0.47+/-0.11 and 0.62+/-0.12 ml/mmHg, respectively, P=0.01. Total RC time was 0.49+/-0.2 s, and RC times for the LF and HF lung were 0.45+/-0.2 and 0.45+/-0.1 s, respectively, not different. Proximal arterial compliance, given by the sum of main, right, and left PA compliances, was only 19% of total lung compliance. The RC time of a single lung equals that of both lungs together, and pulmonary arterial compliance comes largely from the distal vasculature.",M1
19783777,"Additive beneficial effects of lactotripeptides and aerobic exercise on arterial <e>compliance</e> in postmenopausal women.Central arterial compliance plays an important role in the functional abilities of the vasculature. Two active tripeptides, valine-proline-proline and isoleucine-proline-proline, were isolated from sour milk and were referred to as lactotripeptides (LTP). Because LTP appears to act as an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor, it is plausible to hypothesize that LTP improves arterial compliance. We determined the effects of LTP ingestion alone or in combination with regular aerobic exercise on arterial compliance. A total of 55 postmenopausal women (50-65 yr old) were randomly divided into four groups: placebo, LTP, exercise and placebo (Ex + placebo), or exercise and LTP (Ex + LTP). LTP or placebo was administered orally for 8 wk. The exercise groups completed an 8-wk moderate aerobic exercise intervention. There were no differences in baseline arterial compliance and most other key dependent variables among the groups. Carotid arterial compliance increased significantly in the LTP (0.93 + or - 0.07 vs. 0.99 + or - 0.08 mm(2)/mmHg x 10(-1)), Ex + placebo (0.92 + or - 0.04 vs. 1.00 + or - 0.05 mm(2)/mmHg x 10(-1)), and Ex + LTP groups (0.86 + or - 0.06 vs. 1.00 + or - 0.06 mm(2)/mmHg x 10(-1)), whereas no such changes were observed in the placebo control group (0.86 + or - 0.06 vs. 0.85 + or - 0.07 mm(2)/mmHg x 10(-1)). The magnitude of increases in carotid arterial compliance was significantly greater in the Ex + LTP group (19 + or - 4%) than in other groups. The improvements in arterial compliance with LTP were associated with the corresponding reductions in arterial blood pressure and plasma angiotensin II concentrations. We concluded that LTP ingestion improves carotid arterial compliance and that the combination of LTP ingestion and regular exercise is additive and synergistic in improving arterial compliance in postmenopausal women.",M1

The purpose of this work was to evaluate whether automated methods could be used reliably on a clinically relevant population, and to assess the precision of these measurements so that it could be compared with expert manual assessment. In this paper we apply an algorithm similar to that used by Krug et al., and the exact processing steps are described in detail to allowing easy reproduction of our methods. Phantoms of different sizes have been assessed and the MRI measurements are found to correlate well (r = 0.9998) with physical measurement. Reproducibility assessment was performed on 33 CAD subjects in three anatomical locations along the aorta. Six normal volunteers and ten patients with more severe aortic plaques were investigated to assess reproducibility and sensitivity to pathological changes, respectively. The performance was also assessed on carotid vessels in 40 patients with known arterial plaques. In the human aorta the method is found to be robust (failing in only 7% of cases, all due to clear errors with image acquisition), and to be quantifiably consistent with expert clinical measurement, but showing smaller errors than that approach [&lt;1.21% (5.62 mm(2)) manual vs. &lt;0.58% (2.71 mm(2)) automated, for the aortic area] and with reduced bias, and operated correctly in advanced disease.

Given its role in endothelial pathobiology, we hypothesized that soluble ESAM (sESAM) would be independently associated with atherosclerosis and vascular stiffness. METHODS AND RESULTS: We measured sESAM, soluble intercellular adhesion molecule (sICAM)-1, and soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule (sVCAM)-1 in 3222 subjects participating in the Dallas Heart Study, a probability-based population sample. Coronary artery calcium (CAC) was measured by electron beam computed tomography, and abdominal aortic wall thickness (AWT), aortic plaque burden (APB), and aortic <e>compliance</e> (AC) by MRI. Increasing levels of sESAM were associated with all major cardiovascular risk factors as well as with inflammatory markers such as monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, but only weakly correlated with sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1. In multivariate analyses, sESAM was independently associated with prevalent CAC (OR 1.2 per SD increase, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.3; P=0.005), AWT (P=0.035), and AC (P=0.006), but not APB (P=0.15). In contrast, no independent associations were observed between sICAM-1 or sVCAM-1 and any of the atherosclerosis phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: In this first reported clinical study of sESAM in humans, sESAM levels were independently associated with CAC, AWT, and AC, whereas sICAM-1 and sVCAM-1 were not. These findings support a unique role of this cellular adhesion molecule in atherosclerosis and suggest the need for further exploration of sESAM as a predictive biomarker and potential mediator of atherosclerosis.",M1
19717452,"The regulatory role of cell mechanics for migration of differentiating myeloid cells.Migration of cells is important for tissue maintenance, immune response, and often altered in disease. While biochemical aspects, including cell adhesion, have been studied in detail, much less is known about the role of the mechanical properties of cells. Previous measurement methods rely on contact with artificial surfaces, which can convolute the results. Here, we used a non-contact, microfluidic optical stretcher to study cell mechanics, isolated from other parameters, in the context of tissue infiltration by acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) cells, which occurs during differentiation therapy with retinoic acid. <e>Compliance</e> measurements of APL cells reveal a significant softening during differentiation, with the mechanical properties of differentiated cells resembling those of normal neutrophils. To interfere with the migratory ability acquired with the softening, differentiated APL cells were exposed to paclitaxel, which stabilizes microtubules. This treatment does not alter compliance but reduces cell relaxation after cessation of mechanical stress six-fold, congruent with a significant reduction of motility. Our observations imply that the dynamical remodeling of cell shape required for tissue infiltration can be frustrated by stiffening the microtubular system. This link between the cytoskeleton, cell mechanics, and motility suggests treatment options for pathologies relying on migration of cells, notably cancer metastasis.",M1
19699738,"No role for increased rectal <e>compliance</e> in pediatric functional constipation.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Increased rectal compliance has been proposed to contribute to pediatric functional constipation (FC). We evaluated the clinical relevance of increased rectal compliance and assessed whether regular use of enemas improves rectal compliance in children with FC. METHODS: A prospective longitudinal study was conducted on children (8-18 years old) with FC. Pressure-controlled rectal distensions were performed at baseline and at 1 year. Rectal compliance was categorized into 3 groups: normal, moderately increased, or severely increased. Patients were randomly assigned to groups given conventional therapy or rectal enemas and conventional therapy. Clinical success was defined as &gt;or=3 spontaneous defecations per week and fecal incontinence &lt;1 per week. RESULTS: Baseline measurements were performed in 101 children (11.0 +/- 2.1 years); rectal compliance was normal in 36%, moderately increased in 40%, and severely increased in 24%. Patients with severely increased rectal compliance had lower defecation frequency (P = .03), more fecal incontinence (P = .04), and more rectal fecal impaction (P &lt; .001). After 1 year, success values were similar between groups: 42% normal, 41% moderately increased, and 40% with severely increased compliance. Barostat studies performed after 1 year in 80 children (37 conventional therapy and 43 rectal enemas in addition to conventional therapy) revealed that rectal compliance had not changed in either group and had not improved in successfully treated patients. CONCLUSIONS: Constipated children with severely increased rectal compliance have severe symptoms. However, increased rectal compliance is not related to treatment failure. Regular use of enemas to avoid rectal fecal impaction does not improve rectal compliance in pediatric FC.",M1
19666842,"TNF-alpha inhibition attenuates adverse myocardial remodeling in a rat model of volume overload.Tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha is a proinflammatory cytokine that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of heart failure. In contrast, we have recently shown that myocardial levels of TNF-alpha are acutely elevated in the aortocaval (AV) fistula model of heart failure. Based on these observations, we hypothesized that progression of adverse myocardial remodeling secondary to volume overload would be prevented by inhibition of TNF-alpha with etanercept. Furthermore, a principal objective of this study was to elucidate the effect of TNF-alpha inhibition during different phases of the myocardial remodeling process. Eight-week-old male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomly divided into the following three groups: sham-operated controls, untreated AV fistulas, and etanercept-treated AV fistulas. Each group was further subdivided to study three different time points consisting of 3 days, 3 wk, and 8 wk postfistula. Etanercept was administered subcutaneously at 1 mg/kg body wt. Etanercept prevented collagen degradation at 3 days and significantly attenuated the decrease in collagen at 8 wk postfistula. Although TNF-alpha antagonism did not prevent the initial ventricular dilatation at 3 wk postfistula, etanercept was effective at significantly attenuating the subsequent ventricular hypertrophy, dilatation, and increased <e>compliance</e> at 8 wk postfistula. These positive adaptations achieved with etanercept administration translated into significant functional improvements. At a cellular level, etanercept also markedly attenuated increases in cardiomyocyte length, width, and area at 8 wk postfistula. These observations demonstrate that TNF-alpha has a pivotal role in adverse myocardial remodeling and that treatment with etanercept can attenuate the progression to heart failure.",M1
19661565,"A novel <e>compliance</e> measurement in radial arteries using strain-gauge plethysmography.We propose a novel method for assessing the compliance of the radial artery by using a two-axis mechanism and a standard positioning procedure for detecting the optimal measuring site. A modified sensor was designed to simultaneously measure the arterial diameter change waveform (ADCW) and pressure pulse waveform with a strain gauge and piezoresistor. In the x-axis scanning, the sensor could be placed close to the middle of the radial artery when the ADCW reached the maximum amplitude. In the Z-axis scanning, the contact pressure was continuously increased for data measurement. Upon the deformation of the strain gauge following the change in the vascular cross-section, the ADCW was transferred to the change of the vascular radius. The loaded strain compliance of the radial artery (C(strain)) can be determined by dividing the dynamic changed radius by the pulse pressure. Twenty-three untreated, mild or moderate hypertensive patients aged 29-85 were compared with 14 normotensive patients aged 25-62. The maximum strain compliance between the two groups was significantly different (p &lt; 0.005). Of the hypertensive patients, 14 were at risk of developing hyperlipidemia. There was a significant difference between this and the normotension group (p &lt; 0.005).",M1
19661445,"Arginase inhibition restores NOS coupling and reverses endothelial dysfunction and vascular stiffness in old rats.There is increasing evidence that upregulation of arginase contributes to impaired endothelial function in aging. In this study, we demonstrate that arginase upregulation leads to endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) uncoupling and that in vivo chronic inhibition of arginase restores nitroso-redox balance, improves endothelial function, and increases vascular <e>compliance</e> in old rats. Arginase activity in old rats was significantly increased compared with that shown in young rats. Old rats had significantly lower nitric oxide (NO) and higher superoxide (O2(-)) production than young. Acute inhibition of both NOS, with N(G)-nitro-l-arginine methyl ester, and arginase, with 2S-amino- 6-boronohexanoic acid (ABH), significantly reduced O2(-) production in old rats but not in young. In addition, the ratio of eNOS dimer to monomer in old rats was significantly decreased compared with that shown in young rats. These results suggest that eNOS was uncoupled in old rats. Although the expression of arginase 1 and eNOS was similar in young and old rats, inducible NOS (iNOS) was significantly upregulated. Furthermore, S-nitrosylation of arginase 1 was significantly elevated in old rats. These findings support our previously published finding that iNOS nitrosylates and activates arginase 1 (Santhanam et al., Circ Res 101: 692-702, 2007). Chronic arginase inhibition in old rats preserved eNOS dimer-to-monomer ratio and significantly reduced O2(-) production and enhanced endothelial-dependent vasorelaxation to ACh. In addition, ABH significantly reduced vascular stiffness in old rats. These data indicate that iNOS-dependent S-nitrosylation of arginase 1 and the increase in arginase activity lead to eNOS uncoupling, contributing to the nitroso-redox imbalance, endothelial dysfunction, and vascular stiffness observed in vascular aging. We suggest that arginase is a viable target for therapy in age-dependent vascular stiffness.",M1
19660461,"Phenotypic variation of colonic motor functions in chronic constipation.BACKGROUND &amp; AIMS: Colonic motor disturbances in chronic constipation (CC) are heterogeneous and incompletely understood; the relationship between colonic transit and motor activity is unclear. We sought to characterize the phenotypic variability in chronic constipation. METHODS: Fasting and postprandial colonic tone and phasic activity and pressure-volume relationships were assessed by a barostat manometric assembly in 35 healthy women and 111 women with CC who had normal colon transit (NTC; n = 25), slow transit (STC; n = 19), and defecatory disorders with normal (DD-normal; n = 34) or slow transit (DD-slow; n = 33). Logistic regression models assessed whether motor parameters could discriminate among these groups. Among CC, phenotypes were characterized by principal components analysis of these measurements. RESULTS: Compared with 10th percentile values in healthy subjects, fasting and/or postprandial colonic tone and/or <e>compliance</e> were reduced in 40% with NTC, 47% with STC, 53% with DD-normal, and 42% with DD-slow transit. Compared with healthy subjects, compliance was reduced (P &lt;or= .05) in isolated STC and DD but not in NTC. Four principal components accounted for 85% of the total variation among patients: factors 1 and 2 were predominantly weighted by fasting and postprandial colonic phasic activity and tone, respectively; factor 3 by postprandial high-amplitude propagated contractions; and factor 4 by postprandial tonic response. CONCLUSIONS: Fasting and/or postprandial colonic tone are reduced, reflecting motor dysfunctions, even in NTC. Colonic motor assessments allow chronic constipation to be characterized into phenotypes. Further studies are needed to evaluate the relationship among these phenotypes, enteric neuropathology, and response to treatment in CC.",M1
19656755,"Post traumatic cerebral oedema in severe head injury is related to intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure but not to cerebral <e>compliance</e>.This was a prospective cohort study, carried out in the Neuro Intensive Care Unit, Department of Neurosciences, Hospital Universiti Sains Malaysia, Kubang Kerian Kelantan. The study was approved by the local ethics committee and was conducted between November 2005 and September 2007 with a total of 30 patients included in the study. In our study, univariate analysis showed a statistically significant relationship between mean intracranial pressure (ICP) as well as cerebral perfusion pressure (CPP) with both states of basal cistern and the degree of diffuse injury and oedema based on the Marshall classification system. The ICP was higher while CPP and compliance were lower whenever the basal cisterns were effaced in cases of cerebral oedema with Marshall III and IV. In comparison, the study revealed lower ICP, higher mean CPP and better mean cerebral compliance if the basal cisterns were opened or the post operative CT brain scan showed Marshall I and II. These findings suggested the surgical evacuation of clots to reduce the mass volume and restoration of brain anatomy may reduce vascular engorgement and cerebral oedema, therefore preventing intracranial hypertension, and improving cerebral perfusion pressure and cerebral compliance. Nevertheless the study did not find any significant relationship between midline shifts and mean ICP, CPP or cerebral compliance even though lower ICP, higher CPP and compliance were frequently observed when the midline shift was less than 0.5 cm. As the majority of our patients had multiple and diffuse brain injuries, the absence of midline shift did not necessarily mean lower ICP as the pathology was bilateral and even when after excluding the multiple lesions, the result remained insignificant. We assumed that the CT brain scan obtained after evacuation of the mass lesion to assess the state basal cistern and classify the diffuse oedema may prognosticate the intracranial pressure and cerebral perfusion pressure thus assisting in the acute post operative management of severely head injured patients. Hence post operative CT brain scans may be done to verify the ICP and CPP readings postoperatively. Subsequently, withdrawal of sedation for neurological assessment after surgery could be done if the CT brain scan showed an opened basal cistern and Marshall I and II coupled with ICP of less than 20 mmHg.",M1
19656688,"Comparative audiometric evaluation of temporomandibular disorder patients with otological symptoms.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this study was to assess the audiological status of temporomandibular disorder (TMD) patients with otological symptoms and to make comparisons with that of a control group of subjects without TMD and otological symptoms. METHODS: 25 TMD patients with otological symptoms and 20 age and gender matched controls, 45 subjects in total, were included in the study. All subjects underwent a series of audiological tests that included pure-tone audiometry, impedance test and reflex tympanometry. The audiological parameters recorded in the two groups were compared statistically by means of unpaired t tests and corrected according to Bonferroni in the case of repeated tests. RESULTS: The pure-tone thresholds at frequencies 125, 250, 500Hz, and 6kHz showed significant differences between the TMD patients and control subjects after the Bonferroni correction (p&lt;0.007). <e>Compliance</e> peaks demonstrated significant differences when the TMD and control groups were compared (p&lt;0.05).

19649309,"Irbesartan improves arterial <e>compliance</e> more than lisinopril.BACKGROUND: Antihypertensive agents can reduce arterial stiffness. We hypothesized that an angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) irbesartan and an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) lisinopril improved arterial compliance. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, controlled crossover trial. Fifteen hypertensive patients, mean age 65.5 +/- 8.9 years (mean +/- SD) were given irbesartan (150 to 300 mg/day) or lisinopril (10 to 20 mg/day) for 12 weeks and then crossed over for 12 weeks. Pulse wave velocity (PWV) in the carotid-femoral (CF), carotid-radial (CR), and femoral dorsalis-pedis (FD) were measured using a Complior((R)) PWV system. RESULTS: After 12 weeks, systolic blood pressure (SBP) decreased from 162.4 +/- 12.9 to 134.5 +/- 14.8 with irbesartan and to 145.2 +/- 25 mmHg with lisinopril. Irbesartan and lisinopril reduced PWV (CF) in the elastic arterial system from 15.1 +/- 5 to 13.3 +/- 2.6 (p &lt; 0.005) and to 14 +/- 4.7 (p &lt; 0.05) m/s respectively (p = 0.345). Irbesartan reduced PWV (CR) and PWV (FD), whereas lisinopril did not. The difference between treatments was significant after SBP adjustment (p = 0.037 for PWV (CR) and p &lt; 0.001 for PWV (FD)). CONCLUSIONS: Irbesartan improved arterial compliance in elastic and muscular arteries, whereas lisinopril improved it only in elastic arteries.",M1

Middle-aged men with at least 1 CHD risk were randomized to a 6-month low-GI (LGI) or high-GI (HGI) diet. All were advised on healthy eating and weight loss. They were seen monthly to assess dietary compliance and anthropometrics. Carotid-femoral pulse wave velocity (PWV), fasting blood lipid profile, and glucose and insulin concentrations were measured at baseline and at months 3 and 6. Six-hour postprandial glucose and insulin responses and 24-hour ambulatory BP were also assessed at baseline and month 6. Thirty-eight subjects (HGI group, n = 16; LGI group, n = 22) completed the study. At month 6, groups differed in dietary GI, glycemic load, and carbohydrate intake (P &lt; .001). Fasting insulin concentration and insulin resistance (calculated by homeostatic model assessment) were lower in the LGI than the HGI group (P &lt; .01). The reduction in total cholesterol and 24-hour BP was bigger in the LGI than the HGI group (P &lt; .05); and only the LGI group had significant reductions (P &lt; .05) in PWV, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, and triacylglycerol concentration. There were no differences in postprandial glucose or insulin responses between the groups. The results suggest that an LGI diet may be more beneficial in reducing CHD risk, including PWV and 24-hour BP, even in the setting of healthy eating and weight loss; and thus, further study is warranted.",M1
19580971,"Ageing and cardiovascular responses to head-up tilt in healthy subjects.OBJECTIVE: Ageing is associated with increased postural blood pressure changes and attenuated cardiovascular reactivity. As the background of these changes remains uncertain, we examined arterial stiffness, cardiac function and vascular resistance in healthy subjects in supine position and during orthostatic challenge. METHODS: Haemodynamics of 179 normotensive subjects (109 female and 70 male, 21-59 years) were examined using continuous radial pulse wave analysis, whole-body impedance cardiography, and plethysmographic finger blood pressures. RESULTS: Both in supine position and during head-up tilt central and peripheral blood pressure and augmentation index (amplitude of the reflected pressure wave divided by pulse pressure) increased, and time of pulse wave reflection decreased with age. Supine pulse wave velocity progressively increased with age. There were only minor differences in supine and upright systemic vascular resistance, cardiac index, stroke index, and heart rate that were not systematically related to age. In regression analysis, the explanatory factors for a more pronounced decrease in central systolic blood pressure during the head-up tilt were in the age of 50-59 years, higher baseline pulse wave velocity and central systolic BP. None of the changes in other haemodynamic variables during tilt were related to age. CONCLUSION: As no systematic age-related differences were observed in cardiac function or vascular resistance, these results support the view that progressive reduction of large arterial <e>compliance</e> contributes to the exaggerated age-related decrease in central systolic blood pressure in response to head-up tilt.",M1

In this study, we examined whether the polymorphism is associated with serum lipid and lipoprotein concentrations, as well as with subclinical atherosclerosis in Young Finns. The participants comprised 2041 men and women (aged 24-39 years) enrolled in the Cardiovascular Risk in Young Finns Study with complete data concerning the rs1800588 polymorphism and serum lipids concentration. All participants underwent an ultrasound examination for brachial artery flow-mediated vasodilatation (FMD) and carotid artery intima-media thickness (IMT) measurement. The marker of arterial elasticity, carotid artery <e>compliance</e> (CAC), was also calculated by means of ultrasound and concomitant brachial blood pressure measurements. In all subjects, serum total cholesterol (p &lt; 0.001), HDL cholesterol (p = 0.006), apolipoprotein AI (apoAI, p &lt; 0.001), and triglyceride (p = 0.009) concentrations increased according to rs1800588 genotype in the order CC, CT, and TT. The same order applied only to apoAI after adjustment for age, body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity, diabetes, hypertension, contraceptive hormone use in women, and concentrations of glucose, insulin and C-reactive protein in men and women separately (p = 0.007 and p = 0.003, respectively). The polymorphism was also associated with HDL cholesterol, total cholesterol, and triglyceride levels in women (adjusted p = 0.004, p = 0.007 and 0.02, respectively), but not in men (p was not significant for all). No significant association between the rs1800588 and brachial FMD, carotid IMT, or CAC was found among the entire study population or among women or men separately, with or without adjustment for the above-mentioned factors. The rs1800588 is associated with serum lipid and apolipoprotein concentrations, especially in women, but does not seem to be a determinant of brachial artery FMD, carotid IMT, or CAC in young healthy adults.",M1

19541733,"Effect of <e>compliance</e> and hematocrit on wall shear stress in a model of the entire coronary arterial tree.A hemodynamic analysis is implemented in the entire coronary arterial tree of diastolically arrested, vasodilated pig heart that takes into account vessel compliance and blood viscosity in each vessel of a large-scale simulation involving millions of vessels. The feed hematocrit (Hct) is varied at the inlet of the coronary arterial tree, and the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect and phase separation are considered throughout the vasculature. The major findings are as follows: 1) vessel compliance is the major determinant of nonlinearity of the pressure-flow relation, and 2) changes in Hct influence wall shear stress (WSS) in epicardial coronary arteries more significantly than in transmural and perfusion arterioles because of the Fahraeus-Lindqvist effect. The present study predicts the flow rate as a second-order polynomial function of inlet pressure due to vessel compliance. WSS in epicardial coronary arteries increases &gt;15% with an increase of feed Hct from 45% to 60% and decreases &gt;15% with a decrease of feed Hct from 45% to 30%, whereas WSS in small arterioles is not affected as feed Hct changes in this range.

We hypothesized that people with subjective memory problems would exhibit higher suggestibility and compliance levels and would be more susceptible to false recollections than those who are optimistic about their memory. In addition, we expected a discrepancy between subjective memory judgments and objective memory performance. We found that subjective memory judgments correlated significantly with compliance, with more negative memory judgments accompanying higher levels of compliance.

Furthermore, participants were accurate in estimating their objective memory performance.",M1
19497928,"Arterial <e>compliance</e> in multiple sclerosis: a pilot study.A reduction in arterial compliance in patients with autoimmune diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus has been previously reported. It is caused by the effect that systemic inflammation has on the cardiovascular system. Multiple sclerosis (MS), an immune-mediated disease that exclusively affects the central nervous system (CNS), has a significant inflammatory component that is limited to that compartment. The potential effects of its inflammatory mediators in the cardiovascular system are largely unknown. Purpose: To examine large (C1) and small arterial compliance (C2) in patients with MS and compare them with healthy age-matched controls. To also determine whether any differences in C1 and C2 indices between participants diagnosed with relapsing remitting MS (RR-MS), secondary progressive MS (SP-MS), and controls exist. Methods: A total of 26 men and women between the ages of 18 and 64 diagnosed with MS and 25 healthy controls volunteered for this study. Arterial compliance was measured by using pulse contour analysis (PCA), which records and analyzes the blood pressure waveform data from the Arterial Pulse Wave Sensors. Results: Significant differences in C1 and C2 were found between young RR-MS and healthy young controls (P &lt; .05), with the MS group showing lower arterial C1 and C2 compliance. No significant differences (P &gt; .05) were seen for C1 or C2 values between older RR-MS, SP-MS, and healthy controls. Conclusion: Arterial compliance is significantly compromised in young individuals with MS, compared with age-matched controls, but not for older individuals, suggesting a systemic effect of an inflammatory process that predominantly affects the CNS.",M1
19477237,"Altered mechanosensitive properties of vagal afferent fibers innervating the stomach following gastric surgery in rats.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Several types of gastric surgeries have been associated with early satiety, dyspepsia and food intolerances. We aimed to examine alterations in gastric vagal afferents following gastric surgery-fundus ligation. METHODS: Six week old, male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent chronic ligation (CL) of the fundus. Sham rats underwent abdominal surgery, but without ligation. Another group of rats underwent acute ligation (AL) of the fundus immediately prior to experiments. CL and sham rats were allowed to grow to age 3-4 months. Food intake and weights were recorded post-operatively. Gastric <e>compliance</e> and gastric wall thickness was measured at baseline and during gastric distension (GD). Extracellular recordings were made to examine response characteristics of vagal afferent fibers to GD and to map the stomach receptive field (RF). The morphological structures of afferent terminals in the stomach were examined with retrograde tracings from the nodose ganglion. RESULTS: The CL group consumed significantly less food and weighed less than sham control. The mean compliance of the CL group was significantly less than control, but higher than the AL group. The spontaneous firing and responses to GD of afferent fibers from the CL rats were significantly higher than AL rats. There was a marked expansion of the gastric RF in the CL rats with significant reorganization and regeneration of intramuscular array (IMA) terminals. There was no difference in total wall or muscle thickness among the groups. CONCLUSION: CL results in aberrant remodeling of IMAs with expansion of the gastric RF and alters the mechanotransduction properties of vagal afferent fibers. These changes could contribute to altered sensitivity following gastric surgery.",M1

19442671,"A cerebrovascular response model for functional neuroimaging including dynamic cerebral autoregulation.Functional neuroimaging techniques such as functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) can be used to isolate an evoked response to a stimulus from significant background physiological fluctuations. Data analysis approaches typically use averaging or linear regression to remove this physiological baseline with varying degrees of success. Biophysical model-based analysis of the functional hemodynamic response has also been advanced previously with the Balloon and Windkessel models. In the present work, a biophysical model of systemic and cerebral circulation and gas exchange is applied to resting state NIRS neuroimaging data from 10 human subjects. The model further includes dynamic cerebral autoregulation, which modulates the cerebral arteriole <e>compliance</e> to control cerebral blood flow. This biophysical model allows for prediction, from noninvasive blood pressure measurements, of the background hemodynamic fluctuations in the systemic and cerebral circulations. Significantly higher correlations with the NIRS data were found using the biophysical model predictions compared to blood pressure regression and compared to transfer function analysis (multifactor ANOVA, p&lt;0.0001).

METHODS: Control subjects, n=510, aged 46.1 +/- 11 years, with no history of coronary disease, were selected from electoral rolls, and coronary patients, n=301, aged 53.7 +/- 10 years, were selected from hospital patients with a history of coronary artery disease (CAD) confirmed by coronary angiogram (at least 75% obstruction of one of the main coronary vessels). The asymptomatic subjects without CAD formed Group A, and were subdivided into A1 (without hypertension, dyslipidemia and/or diabetes) and A2 (with hypertension, dyslipidemia and/or diabetes). The coronary patients formed Group B, who were also subdivided into B1, without these classic risk factors, and B2 with hypertension, dyslipidemia and/or diabetes. We used the Student's t test to compare continuous variables and the chi-square test to compare categorical data. The strength of correlation between continuous variables was tested by Pearson's linear correlation. Independent variables predictive of CAD were determined by backward logistic regression analysis. The statistical analysis was performed using SPSS for Windows version 11.0 and data were expressed as means +/- SD; a p value of 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Comparing the two groups A1 and A2, mean PWV was significantly lower in group A1. Comparing B1 and B2, mean PWV was also significantly lower in group B1. In group A1, PWV was significantly and positively correlated with age, body mass index, waist-to-hip ratio, alcohol consumption, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, systolic, diastolic and mean blood pressure (BP), blood glucose, apo B, triglycerides, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, unlike HDL which was inversely correlated (Pearson's coefficient). In group A2, PWV was significantly and positively correlated with age, alcohol consumption, total/HDL cholesterol ratio, systolic, diastolic and mean BP, blood glucose and pulse pressure (PP), but not HDL, which was inversely correlated with PWV. In group B1, PWV was only significantly and positively correlated with age, systolic, mean, and diastolic BP and PP, and presented a significant inverse correlation with ejection fraction. However, in the high-risk coronary population (group B2), there was a positive correlation with age, waist-to-hip ratio, systolic and mean BP, PP and homocysteine. After stepwise logistic regression, PWV remained in the model and proved to be a significant and independent risk factor for CAD. CONCLUSION: The results of our study show that PWV is higher in high-risk groups and significantly correlated with many classic and new CAD risk markers, suggesting that there is a cumulative influence of risk factors in the development of arterial stiffness. We believe that PWV is a useful index of vascular status and hence cardiovascular risk and that it may be useful for risk stratification in both asymptomatic and coronary patients.",M1
19420292,"Balance point characterization of interstitial fluid volume regulation.The individual processes involved in interstitial fluid volume and protein regulation (microvascular filtration, lymphatic return, and interstitial storage) are relatively simple, yet their interaction is exceedingly complex. There is a notable lack of a first-order, algebraic formula that relates interstitial fluid pressure and protein to critical parameters commonly used to characterize the movement of interstitial fluid and protein. Therefore, the purpose of the present study is to develop a simple, transparent, and general algebraic approach that predicts interstitial fluid pressure (P(i)) and protein concentrations (C(i)) that takes into consideration all three processes. Eight standard equations characterizing fluid and protein flux were solved simultaneously to yield algebraic equations for P(i) and C(i) as functions of parameters characterizing microvascular, interstitial, and lymphatic function. Equilibrium values of P(i) and C(i) arise as balance points from the graphical intersection of transmicrovascular and lymph flows (analogous to Guyton's classical cardiac output-venous return curves). This approach goes beyond describing interstitial fluid balance in terms of conservation of mass by introducing the concept of inflow and outflow resistances. Algebraic solutions demonstrate that P(i) and C(i) result from a ratio of the microvascular filtration coefficient (1/inflow resistance) and effective lymphatic resistance (outflow resistance), and P(i) is unaffected by interstitial <e>compliance</e>. These simple algebraic solutions predict P(i) and C(i) that are consistent with reported measurements. The present work therefore presents a simple, transparent, and general balance point characterization of interstitial fluid balance resulting from the interaction of microvascular, interstitial, and lymphatic function.",M1
19412147,"Targeting transpulmonary pressure to prevent ventilator induced lung injury.Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) and ventilator induced lung injury (VILI) continue to challenge clinicians who care for the critically ill. Current research in ARDS has focused on ventilator strategies to improve the outcome for these patients. In this review, we emphasize the limitations of managing ventilators based on airway pressures alone. Specifically, basic pulmonary mechanics including chest wall <e>compliance</e> and transpulmonary pressure are reviewed. This review suggests that perturbations in chest wall compliance and transpulmonary pressure may explain the lack of efficacy observed in recent clinical trials of ventilator management. We present a method for estimating pleural and transpulmonary pressures from esophageal manometry. Quantifying these variables and individualizing ventilator management based on individual patient physiology may be useful to intensive care clinicians who treat patients with ARDS.",M1
19389680,"Noninvasive intracranial <e>compliance</e> from MRI-based measurements of transcranial blood and CSF flows: indirect versus direct approach.Intracranial compliance (ICC) determines the ability of the intracranial compartment to accommodate an increase in volume without a large increase in intracranial pressure (ICP). The clinical utilization of ICC is limited by the invasiveness of current measurement. Several investigators attempted to estimate ICC noninvasively, from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) measurements of cerebral blood and cerebral spinal fluid flows, either using indirect measures of ICC or directly by measuring the ratio of the changes in intracranial volume and pressure during the cardiac cycle. The indirect measures include the phase lag between the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and its driving force, either arterial inflow or net transcranial blood flow. This study compares the sensitivity of phase-based and amplitude-based measures of ICC to changes in ICC. In vivo volumetric blood and CSF flows measured by MRI phase contrast from healthy volunteers and from patients with elevated ICP were used for the comparison. An RLC circuit model of the craniospinal system was utilized to simulate the effect of a change in ICC on the CSF flow waveform. The simulations demonstrated that amplitude-based measures of ICC are considerably more sensitive than phase-based measures, and among the amplitude-based measures, the ICC index provides the most reliable estimate of ICC.",M1
19384533,"[Intracranial pressure-volume relationship. Physiology and pathophysiology]Posttraumatic increase of intracranial pressure (ICP) is a strong prognostic factor for the outcome of patients after traumatic brain injury. After exhausting all compensatory mechanisms ICP increases exponentially, where ICP(norm)=(CSF production*CSF flow resistance)+venous pressure((sinus sagittalis))=10-15 mmHg. The ICP curve is influenced by the <e>compliance</e> (DeltaV/DeltaP) and elasticity (DeltaP/DeltaV) of the brain. Marmarou could demonstrate that the non-linear cranio-spinal pressure-volume relationship describes a logarithmic, mono-exponential, strongly linear relationship between pressure and volume and named this the pressure volume index (PVI=log ICP/DeltaV). The pressure volume index describes the volume necessary to increase ICP by a factor of 10. Additionally to PVI the measurement of volume-pressure response (VPR) was introduced. The continuous intracranial compliance could be determined on the principle of pulsatile volume increases as an equivalent of very small intra-cranial volume increases. However, to ascertain functional status of the injured brain a combination of measurements of different parameters, such as tissue oxygen partial pressure (p(ti)O2), cerebral blood flow (CBF), microdialysis and electrocorticography (ECoG) is recommended.",M1
19376518,"<e>Compliance</e> mismatch between stenotic and distal reference segment is associated with coronary artery disease instability.OBJECTIVE: Inflammation and structural factors such as a thin fibrous cap, positive remodeling and large lipid pool have been established as factors associated with coronary plaque instability. This study aimed to investigate the hypothesis that the differential in coronary artery compliance between stenotic and adjacent arterial segments is another factor associated with unstable coronary disease. METHODS: Forty-one patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention were classified as unstable coronary syndrome (n=19) or stable angina (n=22). Intravascular ultrasound was used to assess external elastic lamina (EEL) cross-sectional area at diastole and systole. Aortic pressure was determined from the coronary guiding catheter. Coronary cross-sectional compliance (C) was calculated as the quotient of systolic-to-diastolic area differential and pulse pressure. C was measured within the stenosis and the adjacent reference segments. RESULTS: EEL cross-sectional area was greater in systole than in diastole in the reference segments, but did not differ within the lesion site. C was greater in the distal reference than the stenotic segments (7.7+/-13.1 vs. 0.0+/-12.3mm(2)mmHg(-1)x10(3), p=0.003). When dichotomized by clinical presentation, the distal-to-stenosis compliance difference was only significant in the unstable coronary syndrome group (stable: distal 4.1+/-13.3 vs. stenosis -0.3+/-13.2mm(2)mmHg(-1)x10(3), ANOVA p=0.48; unstable: distal 11.9+/-11.9 vs. stenosis 0.1+/-11.6mm(2)mmHg(-1)x10(3), ANOVA p=0.006, distal-to-stenosis difference p=0.001). CONCLUSIONS: A difference between stenotic and distal reference segment coronary compliance was evident in unstable, but not stable coronary artery disease patients. Coronary compliance differential would increase cyclical forces in the plaque shoulder region, which may contribute to plaque disruption.",M1
19359366,"Dynamic pressure-flow relationship of the cerebral circulation during acute increase in arterial pressure.The physiological mechanism(s) for the regulation of the dynamic pressure-flow relationship of the cerebral circulation are not well understood. We studied the effects of acute cerebral vasoconstriction on the transfer function between spontaneous changes in blood pressure (BP) and cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) in 13 healthy subjects (30 +/- 7 years). CBFV was measured in the middle cerebral artery using transcranial Doppler. BP was increased stepwise with phenylephrine infusion at 0.5, 1.0 and 2.0 microg kg(-1) min(-1). Phenylephrine increased BP by 11, 23 and 37% from baseline, while CBFV increased (11%) only with the highest increase in BP. Cerebrovascular resistance index (BP/CBFV) increased progressively by 6, 17 and 23%, demonstrating effective steady-state autoregulation. Transfer function gain at the low frequencies (LF, 0.07-0.20 Hz) was reduced by 15, 14 and 14%, while the phase was reduced by 10, 17 and 31%. A similar trend of changes was observed at the high frequencies (HF, 0.20-0.35 Hz), but gain and phase remained unchanged at the very low frequencies (VLF, 0.02-0.07 Hz). Windkessel model simulation suggests that increases in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or decreases in vascular <e>compliance</e> during cerebral vasoconstriction contribute to the changes in gain and phase. These findings suggest that changes in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or vascular compliance modulate the dynamic pressure-flow relationship at the low and high frequencies, while dynamic autoregulation is likely to be dominant at the very low frequencies. Thus, oscillations in CBFV are modulated not only by dynamic autoregulation, but also by changes in steady-state cerebrovascular resistance and/or vascular compliance.",M1

BNP and N-terminal-pro-BNP were analyzed in 1,000 subjects aged 70 years participating in the Prospective Investigation of the Vasculature in Uppsala Seniors (PIVUS) study and were related to different measures of endothelial function and activation, arterial <e>compliance</e>, carotid atherosclerosis, and echocardiographic findings. The median levels were 42.0 ng/L for BNP and 110.7 ng/L for N-terminal-pro-BNP. On adjusted multivariate analysis, the 2 BNPs were related to increased left ventricular mass and impaired left ventricular systolic and diastolic function but not to any of the other assessed entities reflecting preclinical vascular disease. In conclusion, BNPs are strong markers of increased left ventricular mass and impaired cardiac performance but cannot be regarded as useful screening markers for the detection of preclinical states of vascular disease in elderly subjects.",M1
19321997,"Usefulness of naftopidil for dysuria in benign prostatic hyperplasia and its optimal dose--comparison between 75 and 50 mg.BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: The clinical usefulness and optimal dose of naftopidil were evaluated and discussed in 100 patients with benign prostatic hyperplasia without urinary retention. METHODS: Naftopidil was administered once in the morning in a dose of 75 mg for 6 weeks; following washout for 1 week, a reduced dose of 50 mg was administered for another 6 weeks. Subjective and objective symptoms were clinically evaluated. RESULTS: Significant improvements were observed in nocturia, IPSS, QOL index, Qmax, Qave, and % postvoid residual urine volume after administration of 75 mg as well as 50 mg. Comparison of the results obtained after administration of 75 and 50 mg revealed improvement only in bladder <e>compliance</e>. Among the items of the IPSS, 'nocturia', 'less than two hours urination', 'weak urinary stream' and 'sensation of not emptying bladder' improved, after administration of 75 as well as 50 mg. The bladder compliance aggravated to 13.6, from 22.1 ml/cm H(2)O after administration of 50 mg. CONCLUSIONS: Naftopidil could have superior effects in benign prostatic hyperplasia patients whose complaints are storage and voiding symptoms, especially nocturia of three times or more, as well as in patients with low compliance bladder and detrusor overactivity. The recommended dose seems to be 50 mg.",M1
19320894,"Biomechanical behavior of scar tissue and uninjured skin in a porcine model.A new method to test axial and transverse tensile properties of skin was developed to improve our understanding of skin mechanical behavior, and how it changes following injury and formation of a scar. Skin tissue was evaluated at 70 days following full-thickness wounding in juvenile female pigs (N=14). Samples were taken in the axial (cranial-caudal) and transverse (dorsal-ventral) directions, for both scar tissue and uninjured skin, and were evaluated mechanically in vitro using a protocol of stress relaxation followed by tensile failure. Uninjured skin was more compliant, with a larger toe-in region, and faster load relaxation, in the axial direction than the transverse. Such directional differences were not present in high-load responses, such as linear stiffness or failure properties. When compared with uninjured skin, scars displayed a similar linear stiffness, with considerably reduced failure properties, and reduced low-load <e>compliance</e>. Scars showed no directional differences in low-load behavior, viscous response, or failure properties. These findings suggest morphological changes that may occur with injury that are consistent with the viscoelastic and directional changes observed experimentally. This improved understanding of how injury affects skin biomechanical function provides valuable information necessary for the design of successful grafting procedures and tissue-engineered skin replacements.",M1
19299643,"Biochemical and mechanical dysfunction in a mouse model of desmin-related myopathy.An R120G mutation in alphaB-crystallin (CryAB(R120G)) causes desmin-related myopathy (DRM). In mice with cardiomyocyte-specific expression of the mutation, CryAB(R120G)-mediated DRM is characterized by CryAB and desmin accumulations within cardiac muscle, mitochondrial deficiencies, activation of apoptosis, and heart failure (HF). Excessive production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is often a hallmark of HF and treatment with antioxidants can sometimes prevent the progression of HF in terms of contractile dysfunction and cardiomyocyte survival. It is unknown whether blockade of ROS is beneficial for protein misfolding diseases such as DRM. We addressed this question by blocking the activity of xanthine oxidase (XO), a superoxide-generating enzyme that is upregulated in our model of DRM. The XO inhibitor oxypurinol was administered to CryAB(R120G) mice for a period of 1 or 3 months. Mitochondrial function was dramatically improved in treated animals in terms of complex I activity and conservation of mitochondrial membrane potential. Oxypurinol also largely restored normal mitochondrial morphology. Surprisingly, however, cardiac contractile function and cardiac <e>compliance</e> were unimproved, indicating that the contractile deficit might be independent of mitochondrial dysfunction and the initiation of apoptosis. Using magnetic bead microrheology at the single cardiomyocyte level, we demonstrated that sarcomeric disarray and accumulation of the physical aggregates resulted in significant changes in the cytoskeletal mechanical properties in the CryAB(R120G) cardiomyocytes. Our findings indicate that oxypurinol treatment largely prevented mitochondrial deficiency in DRM but that contractility was not improved because of mechanical deficits in passive cytoskeletal stiffness.",M1
19299568,"Regular endurance exercise in young men increases arterial baroreflex sensitivity through neural alteration of baroreflex arc.Endurance exercise training increases arterial baroreflex sensitivity that corresponds to alteration in vessel wall <e>compliance</e> of the carotid artery in elderly men. Here, we examined whether regular endurance exercise increases arterial baroreflex sensitivity through neural alteration of the baroreflex arc in young men. We assessed arterial baroreflex sensitivity in eight sedentary men (age 24 +/- 1 yr) and nine men trained in endurance exercise (age 23 +/- 1 yr) during phase IV of the Valsalva maneuver [systolic arterial blood pressure (SAP)-R-R interval relationship]. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity was further analyzed by dividing the mechanical component [SAP-end-systolic carotid lumen diameter relationship (ultrasonography)] and the neural component (end-systolic carotid lumen diameter-R-R interval relationship). Carotid arterial compliance was determined using B-mode ultrasound and arterial applanation tonometry on the common carotid artery. Arterial baroreflex sensitivity and its neural component were greater in the exercise-trained group (P &lt; 0.05). In contrast, carotid arterial compliance and the mechanical component of arterial baroreflex sensitivity did not differ between groups. These results suggest that regular endurance exercise in young men increases arterial baroreflex sensitivity through changes in the neural component of the baroreflex arc and not through alterations in vessel wall compliance of the carotid artery.",M1
19291400,"Reproducibility and performance characteristics of colonic <e>compliance</e>, tone, and sensory tests in healthy humans.BACKGROUND: The performance characteristics of colonic sensation and motility measurements are unclear. AIM: To compare left colon compliance, tone, and sensation in males and females and to evaluate inter and intra-individual coefficients of variation (COV) in these measurements. METHODS: Data were acquired using standard barostat methods, by one technologist, in 72 human volunteers (38 males, 18-65 years). We measured compliance, fasting tone, and sensation during baseline and post-placebo; postprandial (PP) tone was measured only post-placebo. Compliance and thresholds for first sensation, gas, and pain were measured using ascending method of limits; sensory ratings (0-100 mm VAS) using random phasic distensions at 8-36 mmHg above baseline operating pressure. Change in PP tone was measured by barostat balloon volume for the first 30 min after a 1000-kcal meal. Inter-COV was calculated as 100 (SD/mean), and intra-COV as (100 x SD delta/overall mean). RESULTS: There were no statistically significant associations with gender for most sensory or motor data at baseline. A modest association of fasting colonic tone and gender was observed. COV are lower (20-35%) for compliance, fasting tone, pain threshold, and sensation ratings than for PP tone and threshold for first or gas sensation (&gt;45%). COV data are similar in males and females; sensation COVs appear smaller in females than in males. CONCLUSIONS: Testing of compliance, tone and pain, and gas sensation in left colon performs adequately to assess these functions in humans. Lower COV for sensation tests among females is relevant to plan studies of drugs intended for functional GI disorders.",M1
19281281,"Effect of stent-graft <e>compliance</e> on endotension after EVAR.PURPOSE: To investigate whether, and to which extent, the type of graft has influence on the pressure in the aneurysm sac. METHODS: The study consisted of a dynamic and a static experiment. In the dynamic experiment, a latex aneurysm was inserted into an in-vitro circulation model, with variable (80-180 mmHg) systemic systolic pressure and a pulse pressure of 40 mmHg. Seven types of devices were used to exclude the aneurysm: a latex reference graft, 3 stentless grafts made of different fabrics, and 3 different types of commercially produced stented grafts used for endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR). The systolic and diastolic intra-aneurysm pressures (IAP) were measured, along with the pulse pressure. The mean IAP and pulse pressures were compared for each category of graft (stented/stentless) and for each graft. In the static experiments, the compliance of each graft and the latex aneurysm were determined by measuring the change in volume necessary to obtain a change in pressure. Furthermore, the IAP with each graft was measured in a nonpulsatile situation under systolic pressures varying between 60 and 140 mmHg. RESULTS: The experiments showed that, with increasing systemic pressures, there was a small pressure (&lt;5 mmHg) increase in the aneurysm, but there was no significant difference among grafts in the dynamic or the static experiments (p = 0.12 and p = 0.17, respectively). With the 3 stented EVAR grafts, there was less pressure transmission than with the 3 stentless grafts, but this difference was not significant (p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: This in-vitro study demonstrated that there is a clinically irrelevant pressure transmission through the graft wall and no significant difference in the pressure transmission between stented and stentless grafts.",M1

We studied the changes in vascular properties after the initiation of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) as well as the contribution of different drug classes. METHODS: cART-naive men were randomized to receive either lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) plus zidovudine/lamivudine (ZDV/3TC) (n = 19) or LPV/r plus nevirapine (NVP) (n = 18). Carotid artery intima-media thickness (C-IMT), arterial stiffness (distensibility coefficients [DCs] and <e>compliance</e> coefficients [CCs] of the carotid, femoral, and brachial arteries; carotid elastic modulus; and augmentation index), and markers of endothelial function (soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule [sVCAM]-1, intercellular adhesion molecule [sICAM]-1, plasma von Willebrand factor (vWF) antigen, and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 antigen) and inflammation (high-sensitivity C-reactive protein) were measured before the initiation of cART and after 3, 12, and 24 months of cART. RESULTS: C-IMT increased by 0.061 +/- 0.016 mm (P &lt; .001) in the ZDV/3TC/LPV/r arm and by 0.044 +/- 0.018 mm (P = .012) in the NVP/LPV/r arm (data are estimated means +/- SEs). Femoral artery DC (-1.66 +/- 0.78 x 10(-3)/kPa [P = .035]) and CC (-0.11 +/- 0.053 mm(2)/kPa [P = .43]) decreased in the ZDV/3TC/LPV/r arm and femoral DC decreased in the NVP/LPV/r arm (-1.72 +/- 0.85 x 10(-3)/kPa [P = .046]), with no significant difference in C-IMT or arterial stiffness between arms. sVCAM-1, sICAM-1, and vWF levels decreased significantly in both groups.

19272611,"Ecological momentary assessment in aging research: a critical review.Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) gathers respondent data on affective, behavioral, and contextual experiences as close in time to those experiences as possible. Potential advantages of EMA in aging research include reducing memory biases and gathering intra-individual data, yet there is little understanding about implementation. The goal of this critical review was to assess the feasibility and applications of EMA in psychological and behavioral research on aging. Through a comprehensive search of the online electronic databases, Psycinfo and Pubmed, for English-language peer-reviewed journals published between 1990 and 2007, we identified 40 articles using EMA methods in older adults. Studies sampled participants between five times per day over one day to once a week for 210 days. Samples were generally not cognitively impaired, evenly split between healthy and clinical populations, and only 6 of 40 studies focused on psychiatric diagnoses. The most common assessment content solicited ratings on affect (n=15), activities of daily living (n=12), physical activities (n=10), and social exchanges (n=8). A total of 90% of the studies that reported <e>compliance</e> reported rates over 80%. Uses of EMA varied widely, with research goals including validation of global measures, detection of subtle treatment effects, and for testing hypotheses about causal intra-individual relationships.

19260082,"The clinical significance of poor bladder <e>compliance</e>.AIMS: There is limited data on bladder compliance associated with lower urinary tract dysfunction. The aim of this study was to investigate the decrease in bladder compliance, and the clinical relationship between patterns of increased pressure with neurological disease. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis was performed in 5,027 patients with voiding dysfunction between June 2002 and April 2008. The patients with poor compliance (PC) were categorized according to the detrusor pattern of increased pressure: group A (gradual increase), group B (terminal increase), and group C (abrupt increase and plateau). RESULTS: Patients with PC were found in 170 (3.4%) cases (76 males and 94 females) with 46.5% in group A 44.7%, group B, and 8.8% group C. Bladder trabeculation was more prevalent in patients with PC than among those with normal compliance. Group A had the highest correlation with the incidence of spinal cord injury compared to the other groups. Group B had a higher correlation with a history of pelvic irradiation, radical prostatectomy, and tethered cord syndrome compared to the others. Vesicoureteral reflux was more frequently detected in group A and group C. Group C was positively correlated with the presence of detrusor overactivity and nocturnal enuresis. CONCLUSIONS: Poor compliance was correlated with the presence of neurological conditions. The gradual increase of detrusor pressure was associated with the development of spinal cord injury, and the terminal increase had an association with a history of treatment to the pelvic cavity.",M1
19243555,"The impact of age on incremental elastic modulus and incremental <e>compliance</e> of pig hepatic portal vein for liver xenotransplantation.BACKGROUND: Pigs are currently considered the most likely source of organs for human xenotransplantation because of anatomical and physiological similarities to humans, and the relative ease to be bred in large numbers. Along with the fast development of the genetic engineering and organ transplant immunity medical science, the research of liver xenotransplantation suffers the very big valuing in recent years. Whether the livers from different species after transplanting can perform the normal function, depends on the function regeneration and lucid rates of hepatic portal vein. The objective of this study was to investigate the age effect on biomechanical properties of pig hepatic portal vein to pave the way for seeking a reliable biomaterial for future pig-to-human liver xenotransplantation. METHODS: The biomechanical remodelling of the hepatic portal vein of pigs for 1,2,3,4,5 and 6 months (n = 6 per month) were measured in this study. The blood vessel was given periodic permanent loading and unloading, and repeated force-deformation data were obtained. The incremental modulus (Einc), the longitudinal incremental modulus (Ep), the circumferential incremental modulus (Ev), incremental compliance (C) and wall thickness were calculated based on the recorded pressure-diameter curves from experimental data. RESULTS: The incremental modulus, pressure strain modulus and the volume modulus of the pig hepatic portal vein increases with the age increased (P &lt; 0.01), while the compliance decreased with the increasing of the age (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Our present study suggests that the biomechanical properties of the pig hepatic portal vein are age dependent, the pig hepatic portal vein with biomechanical properties that match those of human hepatic portal vein should be chosen for liver xenotransplantation.",M1
19231393,"Theoretic impact of infarct <e>compliance</e> on left ventricular function.BACKGROUND: After coronary occlusion, the infarct region loses contractile function immediately and then undergoes a progressive healing process. This causes complex and time-dependent changes in infarct material properties that have not been well described experimentally. We used a theoretic approach to assess how infarct compliance effects left ventricular (LV) size and function after myocardial infarction. METHODS: We used a closed-loop lumped-parameter model of the ovine cardiovascular system developed to study the effect of infarct size and compliance on cardiovascular function. The time-varying LV function was partitioned into infarct and noninfarct regions where the parameters of each could be adjusted separately. The model incorporated an adaptive compensatory mechanism to maintain stroke volume by varying the total blood volume. RESULTS: For the preinfarction heart, the model produced pressure, volume, and functional results that were consistent with normal values for large animals. When infarcts of progressively larger size (5% to 25%) were introduced and stroke volume adaptation was permitted, the model produced pressure, volume, and functional results that were consistent with postinfarction values measured experimentally in large animals. Infarct size was held at 20% as infarct compliance decreased from 7 to 1 mL/mm Hg. This stiffening of the infarct resulted in reduced LV end-diastolic volume (200 to 60 mL), increased ejection fraction (0.10 to 0.30), and reduced LV end-diastolic pressure (14 to 5 mm Hg). Estimated LV oxygen consumption was also improved in the stiffer infracts. CONCLUSION: Stiffer infarcts are associated with less LV dilatation, reduced filling pressures and better global LV function.",M1
19228985,"Interacting effects of genioglossus stimulation and mandibular advancement in sleep apnea.Both mandibular advancement (MA) and stimulation of the genioglossus (GG) have been shown to improve upper airway patency, but neither one achieves the effect of continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) treatment. In the present study we assessed the combined effect of MA and GG stimulation on the relaxed pharynx in patients with obstructive sleep apnea (OSA). We evaluated responses of upper airway pressure-flow relationships and endoscopically determined pharyngeal cross-sectional area to MA and electrical stimulation of the GG in 14 propofol-anesthetized OSA patients. Measurements were undertaken at multiple levels of CPAP, enabling calculation of the critical closing pressure (Pcrit), upstream resistance (Rus), and pharyngeal <e>compliance</e>. GG stimulation, MA, and the combination of both shifted the pressure:flow relationships toward higher flow levels, resulting in progressively lower Pcrit (from baseline of 2.9 +/- 2.2 to 0.9 +/- 2.5, -1.4 +/- 2.9, and -4.2 +/- 3.3 cmH(2)O, respectively), without significant change in Rus. DeltaPcrit during GG stimulation was significantly larger during MA than under baseline conditions (-2.8 +/- 1.4 vs. -2.0 +/- 1.4 cmH(2)O, P = 0.011). Combining the effect of GG stimulation with MA lowered Pcrit below 0 in all patients and restored pharyngeal patency to a level that enabled flow above the hypopnea level in 10/14 of the patients. Velopharyngeal compliance was not affected by either manipulation. We conclude that the combined effect of MA and GG stimulation is additive and may act in synergy, preventing substantial flow limitation of the relaxed pharynx in most OSA patients.",M1

19217745,"The vascular and biochemical effects of cilostazol in patients with peripheral arterial disease.OBJECTIVES: Cilostazol improves walking distance and quality of life in patients with peripheral arterial disease (PAD). This study assessed the vascular and biochemical effects of cilostazol therapy in PAD patients. METHODS: PAD patients were prospectively recruited to a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial. Baseline clinical data were recorded. Clinical assessment included measurement of arterial <e>compliance</e>, transcutaneous oxygenation, ankle-brachial index (ABI), and treadmill walking distance. Blood analyses included a full blood panel, coagulation screen, urea and electrolytes, liver function tests, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and lipid profiles. Quality of life indices were recorded using validated generic and walking-specific questionnaires. All tests were performed at baseline, 6, and 24 weeks. RESULTS: Eighty patients (53 men) were recruited from December 2004 to January 2006. The cilostazol group had a significant reduction in the augmentation index compared with the placebo group at 6 weeks (19.7% vs 26.7%, P = .001) and at 24 weeks (19.7% vs 27.7%, P = .005). A paradoxic reduction in transcutaneous oxygenation levels was identified in the cilostazol group for the left foot at 6 weeks and for the right foot at both 6 and 24 weeks. The ABIs were not significantly different between treatment groups at baseline, 6 weeks, or 24 weeks for the left and right lower limbs. The mean percentage change in walking distance from baseline improved more markedly in the cilostazol compared with the placebo group for absolute claudication distance at 6 (78.6% vs 26.4%, P = .20) and 24 weeks (173.1% vs 92.1%, P = .27); however, these failed to reach significance. Significant improvements in lipid profiles were demonstrated with cilostazol therapy at 6 weeks (triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein [HDL]) and at 24 weeks (cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL, and low-density lipoprotein). The cilostazol treatment group demonstrated significant improvements in the Short Form-36 (physical functioning, physical component score), Walking Impairment (distance and speed), and Vascular Quality of Life (pain) indices at 6 and 24 weeks. Although cilostazol was associated with side effects in approximately one-third of patients, most settled within 6 weeks, facilitating the continuation of therapy in &gt;89%. CONCLUSION: Cilostazol is a well-tolerated, safe, and efficacious treatment for PAD patients. It not only improves patients' symptomatology and quality of life but also appears to have beneficial effects on arterial compliance, possibly through its lipid-lowering property.",M1
19214094,"Prophylactic vertebroplasty may reduce the risk of adjacent intact vertebra from fatigue injury: an ex vivo biomechanical study.STUDY DESIGN: In vitro biomechanical study using human spine specimens. OBJECTIVE: To find the biomechanical consequences of prophylactic vertebroplasty post fatigue loading. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: Percutaneous vertebroplasty man be an effective treatment for osteoporotic vertebral compression fracture. One frequently observed complication post surgery is the adjacent vertebral failure (AVF). The prophylactic vertebroplasty was proposed to prevent the AVF. The vertebroplasty is, nevertheless, an invasive intervention. More scientific proves are needed for the application of this surgery on a still intact vertebra. METHODS: Fourteen 5-level fresh human cadaveric thoracic motion segments were divided into standard and prophylactic group. Both ends of the specimen were mounted, leaving the center 3 vertebrae free. The lower level of free vertebrae was artificially injured and cement augmented. The center level vertebra of standard group remained intact and nonaugmented. The center level vertebra of prophylactic group also remained intact, but augmented with bone cement. The specimen was applied with a 2-hour, 5-Hz, 630-N (mean) compressive fatigue loading. Impulse test and CT scanning were conducted both before and after fatigue loading to find the variance of strain <e>compliance</e> of cortical shell and height of vertebral body. RESULTS: The strain compliance of cortical shell is generally not statistically significantly affected by the fatigue loading, cement augmentation and vertebral level (All P &gt; 0.05). The only exception is that the cortical strain compliance of augmented vertebrae tentatively decreased post fatigue loading (P = 0.012 for tensile strain compliance, and P = 0.049 for compressive strain compliance). The height loss of intact vertebra adjacent to a 2-level augmented (or intact-augmented) vertebra is significantly lower than the one adjacent to a 1-level augmented (or injury-augmented) vertebra (P = 0.014). For an osteoporotic vertebra, neither cortical strain compliance nor vertebral height loss is connected with bone mineral density (all P &gt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: The strain compliance of cortical shell is generally not a sensitive indicator to predict risk of fatigue injury if the fatigue loading is mild. The prophylactic augmentation strengthens the osteoporotic vertebrae, decreases the progression of vertebral height loss, reduces the anterior body shift, and hence protects the adjacent intact vertebra from elevated flexion bending. It can be cautiously suggested that if the vertebra is osteoporotic and adjacent level is located at pivot or lordotic level of spinal column, the prophylactic augmentation may be an option to prevent the AVF.",M1
19207867,"Relationship between vascular calcification, arterial stiffness and bone mineral density in a cross-sectional study of prevalent Australian haemodialysis patients.BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is associated with increased vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness, both inversely correlated with bone mineral density (BMD). Few studies have correlated VC in the dialysis population with measurements of BMD and arterial <e>compliance</e>. METHODS: We report cross-sectional data on 45 haemodialysis (HD) patients assessing the prevalence of VC and its associations. Patients had computed tomography scans through abdominal aorta and superficial femoral arteries (SFA) to determine VC, pulse wave velocity (PWV) using SphygmoCor device measuring arterial stiffness, and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) to determine BMD. RESULTS: Patients, 64% male, 38% diabetic, had median age 58 years. Mean PWV was 8.7 +/- 3.5 m/s and median aortic VC score 488.1 +/- 298 Hounsfield units, with 91% having aortic VC present. In univariate linear regression analysis, aortic VC correlated positively with length of HD (P = 0.03) and diabetes (P = 0.06). Increasing PWV was positively associated with age (P = 0.001), diabetes (P = 0.05) and VC (aortic P = 0.08, SFA P = 0.01). In multivariate regression analysis, length of HD and diabetes were significantly associated with aortic VC, whereas age and diabetes were associated with SFA VC and PWV. Mean lumbar spine and femoral neck T-scores on DXA were 0.14 and -1.66 respectively. CONCLUSION: Increased VC and reduced arterial compliance, both closely related, are common in Australian HD patients. Both are associated with diabetes and increasing age, and greater aortic VC is seen with longer duration of dialysis.",M1
19200779,"Cerebral vasoreactivity decreases overnight in severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome: a study of cerebral hemodynamics.BACKGROUND: OSAS has been associated with surrogate markers of atherosclerosis and is a known risk factor for stroke. However, there is limited data on the effects of recurring apneas in severe OSAS on cerebral circulation and their consequences on cerebrovascular reactivity and <e>compliance</e>. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate cerebral blood flow velocity (CBFV) changes and vascular compliance in patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) using transcranial Doppler sonography (TCD) and cerebral pulse transit time (PTT). METHODS: Seven patients (1 woman, 6 men, mean age 57.4 years) with severe OSAS underwent polysomnography at the sleep laboratory of the Neurology Department of Innsbruck Medical University. TCD was performed continuously during the whole night using a pulsed wave probe and was co-registered with routine polysomnography. Cerebrovascular reactivity was assessed by calculation of apnea and hypopnea-related CBFV changes. Arterial compliance was characterized by PTT derived from phase difference analysis between ECG and TCD signals. Sleep time was dichotomized into periods with high density of consecutive respiratory events (CRE) vs. periods with low density of consecutive respiratory events (non-CRE). TCD measurements of CBFV showed a regular, undulating pattern with flow minima immediately before apneas or hypopneas and maxima closely after their termination, reciprocally to peripheral O(2) saturation. CBFV reactivity was significantly diminished in CRE compared to non-CRE periods. PTT phase differences were reduced in non-CRE, and even more so in CRE periods, compared to initial wake phases. CONCLUSION: We found severe disturbances of cerebrovascular reactivity in OSAS patients. Our data demonstrate loss of vasoreactivity and increase of arterial stiffness, indicated by CBF hyporeactivity and PTT reduction, especially during CRE periods. These changes are likely to impair cerebral circulation and may be detrimental to the endothelium.",M1
19199556,"The physical movement of urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder and bladder <e>compliance</e> in two anurans.Urine movement from the ureters to the bladder was accomplished by a combination of gravity and pressures resulting from lung inflation, buccal pumping, and smooth-muscle contraction. Urine movement from the cloaca to the urinary bladder was the result of pressure generated by cloacal smooth-muscle contraction and opposed by urinary bladder pressure, resulting from compliance, lung inflation, and buccal movements. The frequency of cloacal smooth-muscle contraction measured in Chaunus marinus (4.9 min(-1)) and Lithobates grylio (2.8 min(-1)) generated cloacal pressures that averaged 0.67 and 0.59 kPa, respectively. Chaunus marinus had a mean internal bladder pressure of 0.29 kPa, while Lithobates catesbeiana had a mean internal bladder pressure of 0.16 kPa. Using direct urinary bladder infusion and physiological pressure transducers on live anurans, it was determined that urinary bladder compliance was lower (P &lt; 0.05) in the aquatic frog L. grylio (2,050 mL kPa(-1) kg(-1)) than in the terrestrial toad C. marinus (4,440 mL kPa(-1) kg(-1)). Taken together, these data suggest that bladder filling is a result of pressures generated in the ureters and the cloaca that are greater than internal bladder pressures and that the more aquatic species had a less compliant urinary bladder compared with that of the terrestrial species.",M1
19195659,"Effects of vessel <e>compliance</e> on flow pattern in porcine epicardial right coronary arterial tree.The compliance of the vessel wall affects hemodynamic parameters which may alter the permeability of the vessel wall. Based on experimental measurements, the present study established a finite element (FE) model in the proximal elastic vessel segments of epicardial right coronary arterial (RCA) tree obtained from computed tomography. The motion of elastic vessel wall was measured by an impedance catheter and the inlet boundary condition was measured by an ultrasound flow probe. The Galerkin FE method was used to solve the Navier-Stokes and Continuity equations, where the convective term in the Navier-Stokes equation was changed in the arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian (ALE) framework to incorporate the motion due to vessel compliance. Various hemodynamic parameters (e.g., wall shear stress-WSS, WSS spatial gradient-WSSG, oscillatory shear index-OSI) were analyzed in the model. The motion due to vessel compliance affects the time-averaged WSSG more strongly than WSS at bifurcations. The decrease of WSSG at flow divider in elastic bifurcations, as compared to rigid bifurcations, implies that the vessel compliance decreases the permeability of vessel wall and may be atheroprotective. The model can be used to predict coronary flow pattern in subject-specific anatomy as determined by noninvasive imaging.",M1
19193426,"Better <e>compliance</e> contributes to better nocturnal continence with orthotopic ileal neobladder than ileocolonic neobladder after radical cystectomy for bladder cancer.OBJECTIVES: To investigate, in a randomized controlled study, the degree of continence after the creation of orthotopic ileocolonic and ileal neobladders after cystectomy and to explore a possible mechanism for the difference in continence between these 2 types of orthotopic neobladder. METHODS: From 2003 to 2007, 71 male patients underwent orthotopic lower urinary tract reconstruction with either an ileocolonic or ileal neobladder after radical cystectomy. The degrees of continence and voiding patterns were individually evaluated using urodynamic examinations and a detailed patient questionnaire. The abnormal upper tract was evaluated using intravenous urography and ultrasonography. RESULTS: Complete daytime continence was achieved in 90.9% and 89.4% of the patients and functional nocturnal continence 48.5% and 76.3% of patients in the ileocolonic neobladder and ileal neobladder groups, respectively. The urodynamic data showed that the initial volume of both the ileocolonic and the ileal neobladder appeared to not be significantly different statistically, although the compliance of the ileocolonic neobladder was lower than that of the ileal neobladder (P &lt; .05). No difference was found in the parameters such as flow rate, urethral profile length, maximal urethral pressure, or neobladder neck pressure between the 2 neobladder types. CONCLUSIONS: Although the ileocolonic and ileal neobladders can both achieve a large initial volume, the ileal neobladder has an advantage in the aspect of obtaining satisfactory nocturnal continence because of its greater compliance compared with that of the ileocolonic neobladder.",M1
19186296,"[Modifications of diaphragmatic activity induced by midline laparotomy and changes in abdominal wall <e>compliance</e>]INTRODUCTION AND OBJECTIVE: Diaphragmatic activity varies with the initial length of the muscle. Our objective was to evaluate the influence of surgery and changes in abdominal wall compliance on diaphragmatic activity. METHODS: Both phrenic nerves in 7 mongrel dogs were stimulated electrically with single supramaximal pulses (twitch). The gastric (Pga) and transdiaphragmatic (Pdi) pressures generated and muscle shortening (sonomicrometry) were used to evaluate diaphragmatic activity, which was determined at baseline, after midline laparotomy, with an elastic abdominal bandage, and with a rigid circular cast. Abdominal pressure was then gradually increased in order to induce progressive lengthening of the diaphragm. RESULTS: After laparotomy, the pressures were somewhat lower (by 12%) than at baseline. The elastic bandage produced a slight increase in the pressure generated by the diaphragm (mean [SE] values: Pga, from 4.2 [0.3]cm H(2)O to 6.3 [0.9]cm H(2)O, P&lt;.01; Pdi(tw), from 12.1 [2.0]cm H(2)O to 15.4 [1.8]cm H(2)O, P&lt;.05]), and these values increased even further with the rigid cast (Pga, to 12.6 [1.5]cm H(2)O; Pdi, to 20.2 [2.3]cm H(2)O; P&lt;.01 for both comparisons); this occurred despite smaller degrees of muscle shortening: by 57% [5%] of the initial length at functional residual capacity at baseline, by 49% [5%] with the bandage (P&lt;.05), and by 39% [6%] with the cast (P&lt;.01). With progressive lengthening of the muscle, its contractile efficacy increased up to a certain point (105% of the length at functional residual capacity), after which it began to decline. CONCLUSIONS: Abdominal wall compliance plays an important role in the diaphragmatic response to stimulation. This appears to be due mainly to changes in its length at rest.",M1
19184331,"Hygiene precautions and the transmission of infections in radiology.Healthcare-associated infections are a critical challenge for the public health sector. Most are acquired through contact, predominantly with the hands of health care personnel. Hand hygiene, therefore, is the single most effective measure for preventing and controlling infectious diseases. Recently, cases of acute hepatitis C occurred in patients who had undergone contrast-enhanced computed tomography. This was probably related to inadequate handling by health care staff. Rigorous <e>compliance</e> with standard precautions is therefore compulsory even in radiology, a setting traditionally considered at low risk for the transmission of pathogens. Adherence to standard precautions is still poor and the persistence of inappropriate practices responsible for preventable incidents is very common in radiology, often owing to underestimation of risk. Radiology units must promote compliance with correct hand hygiene through appropriate education programmes and provision of adequate areas and hand hygiene products. The evidence base to support the use of alcohol-based hand rub is demonstrating that these formulations are effective in improving hand hygiene compliance and preventing infections.",M1
19184170,"The influence of different surgical approaches on arterial rigidity in children after aortic coarctation repair.Complications, such as recoarctation or secondary hypertension, probably related to the loss of arterial elasticity, frequently occur after aortic coarctation surgery. This study aimed to investigate arterial <e>compliance</e> as evaluated by automated recording of the QKd interval in patients who underwent repair of coarctation by construction of a subclavian flap compared with those who underwent resection of the narrowed aortic segment with end-to-end anastomosis. Thirty-nine children who underwent surgical repair of aortic coarctation by subclavian flap (n = 19) and by end-to-end anastomosis (n = 20) were enrolled. Arterial stiffness was measured by the noninvasive QKd 100-60 method. Twenty-four-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring and a transthoracic echocardiography were also performed. The group of patients who had an end-to-end anastomosis showed better results regarding 24-hour blood pressure profile and QKD 100-60 value compared with those underwent construction of a subclavian flap. Surgical repair of aortic obstruction by end-to-end anastomosis demonstrates better preservation of arterial distensibility than those repaired by subclavian flap. Therefore, it appears to be advantageous, whenever possible, to use the end-end anastomosis approach, which appears to lessen the incidence of the most common complications after aortic arch surgery.",M1

We compared aortic elasticity between 19 FH patients with the same mutation, 18 type 2 DM patients, and 30 controls, all aged 48 to 64. They underwent aortic magnetic resonance imaging, risk-factor assessment, and carotid and femoral ultrasound measurements. All patients were on adequate cardiovascular medication including statins and had established coronary heart disease (CHD). FH patients had longer-duration CHD (13.3 +/- 7.7 years) than did DM patients (5.0 +/- 3.1). Aortic compliance in the descending thoracic (DM 0.38 +/- 0.14 vs control 0.53 +/- 0.19, P = 0.032) and abdominal aorta (DM 0.45 +/- 0.20 vs control 0.66 +/- 0.25, P = 0.011) was lower in DM patients than in controls, whereas no significant difference existed between FH patients and controls. Carotid and femoral intima-media thickness was greater in FH and DM patients than in controls with no difference between patient groups. Carotid or femoral plaques appeared in 15 (79%) FH and in 10 (56%) DM patients. One control had a femoral plaque. Five FH patients showed stenosis, occlusion or both in carotid arteries. In our opinion, DM patients' lower compliance reflect mainly arterial media affecting arteriosclerosis, while FH patients' plaque status and longer duration of CHD suggest more advanced atherosclerosis. The FH patients may therefore be at increased risk for atherothrombotic events. However, due to small patient material, larger confirmatory studies are needed.",M1

The measurement system uses an ultrasound pulse echo method to probe the carotid artery. The reflected echoes are processed using Hilbert transform techniques. Peak detection and echo tracking are implemented in LabVIEW. A comparison is done between manual and automatic method of echo identification. The instrument gives a display of the variation of carotid diameter in real time and calculates the various estimates of arterial compliance from the analyzed data.

DESIGN: Three groups randomized controlled trial with pretests and posttests. SETTING: Exercise programs were community-based, and the outcome measures were laboratory-based. PARTICIPANTS: Adults (N=64) age 65+ years with positive fall history in the previous year and/or significant fear of falling. INTERVENTION: A 24-form, Yang-style Tai Chi for 15 weeks, 3 hours a week. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Exercise compliance, number of falls, fear of falling (Activities-specific Balance Confidence [ABC] score), self-perceived health (Medical Outcomes Study 36-Item Short Form Health Survey [SF-36]), Timed Up &amp; Go (TUG), single leg stance (SLS), and body sway during quiet stance (medial-lateral foot center of pressure [ML-COP]). RESULTS: Tele-ex and Comm-ex groups demonstrated significantly higher exercise attendance and in-class practice time than the Home-ex group (P&lt;.01) and significant reductions in the mean number of falls and injurious falls (P&lt;.01). There were significant improvements posttraining in SLS, ABC, ML-COP, and Physical Health subscore of the SF-36 (P&lt;.05). Both Tele-ex and Comm-ex groups demonstrated larger improvements than the Home-ex group in TUG, ML-COP, and the Social Function, Mental Health, and Physical Health subscores of the MOS SF-36. CONCLUSION: Compared with the Home-ex, the Tele-ex and Comm-ex groups are better in exercise compliance, fall reduction and balance and health improvements.

20497773,"<e>Compliance</e> with French nutrition and health program recommendations is strongly associated with socioeconomic characteristics in the general adult population.BACKGROUND: In many countries, nutrition policies such as the Programme National Nutrition Santé (PNNS), implemented in France since 2001, have been developed to prevent and reduce the risk of chronic disease. However, the way in which such programs might benefit persons having different socioeconomic characteristics is unknown. The French nutrition and health survey (Etude Nationale Nutrition Santé [ENNS]) represented an opportunity to address this issue. OBJECTIVE: To describe compliance with PNNS recommendations in the general population and to investigate the relationship between social, economic, and educational characteristics and poor compliance with French nutrition recommendations. DESIGN: A national cross-sectional multistage sampling survey. Food intake was estimated through three 24-hour recalls. Adherence to French nutrition recommendations was estimated using the PNNS guideline score (15 possible points). PARTICIPANTS: Two thousand five hundred seventy-seven adults aged 18 to 74 years living in France in 2006-2007 were included in these analyses. STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: All analyses were carried out in men and women separately. Sex-specific quartiles of score were estimated. Multiple logistic models were used to identify socioeconomic characteristics (ie, age, marital status, occupational status, education level, and holiday trip in the past 12 months) associated with poor compliance with recommendations (first PNNS guideline score quartile vs three other quartiles), estimating odds ratios (ORs), and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). RESULTS: The mean PNNS guideline score was 7.67+/-0.17 in men and 8.55+/-0.12 in women. In both sex groups, a difference of approximately four attained recommendations (out of 13 maximum) was observed between the lowest and highest quartiles. In multivariate models, being in the first PNNS guideline score quartile was significantly associated with lower age and lower occupational status for both sexes. Moreover, women living without a partner were at higher risk of poor compliance with recommendations (adjusted OR 1.43; 95% CI 1.01 to 2.04, vs women living with a partner), as were men not having taken a holiday trip during the past 12 months (adjusted OR 1.78, 95% CI 1.05 to 3.02, vs at least one holiday trip). CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with nutrition recommendations can be improved despite several years of public health interventions carried out by the PNNS. Identification of characteristics associated with poor compliance should help to target future public health measures.",M2

OBJECTIVE: The Supplementation with Multiple Micronutrients Intervention Trial (SUMMIT), a randomized, controlled clinical trial in Lombok, Indonesia, found that supplementation during pregnancy with multiple micronutrients reduced 90-day infant mortality by nearly 20% as compared with iron-folic acid. This trial was designed as both a program and research trial and used community facilitators to serve as liaisons between the study and the pregnant women. This analysis documents the programmatic impacts of SUMMIT on health-seeking and early infant mortality resulting from community facilitators' field activities. METHODS: Data on <e>compliance</e>, human resource practices, health-seeking, and health outcomes from the 31,290 SUMMIT enrollees were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall compliance with either iron-folic acid or multiple micronutrients was high in the program, at 85.0%. Early prenatal care visits increased significantly. Sixty-three percent of primiparous women used a skilled birth attendant (SBA); among multiparous women, the rate of use of a SBA rose from 35% for the last birth to 53%. Use of a SBA resulted in a 30% reduction in early infant mortality (RR, 0.70; 95% CI, 0.59 to 0.83; p &lt; .0001), independently of any reductions due to multiple micronutrients. The community facilitators played a central role in improving health-seeking; however, the quality of the community facilitators' performance was associated with the impact of the micronutrient supplement on infant health. In a subsample of community facilitators, better-performing facilitators were found to markedly improve the overall impact of the multiple micronutrients on early infant mortality (RR, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.49 to 0.92; p = .0117). In contrast, infants of women with poorly performing community facilitators were found to derive no additional benefit from the multiple micronutrients (RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.64 to 1.72; p = .8568). CONCLUSIONS: Systematic enhancements to the quality of implementation of SUMMIT led to significant increases in use of SBAs at delivery, resulting in a 30% reduction in early infant mortality independent of the impact of micronutrient supplementation. Therefore, if women were to consume multiple micronutrients on a regular basis and were to use a SBA at delivery, the risk of early infant mortality could be reduced by nearly 50%. The impacts of community facilitators in effecting changes in women's health behaviors are notable and are applicable to other health programs. Enhancements to program implementation should be driven by evidence, be accountable to the communities the program serves, and be evaluated on the basis of measurable gains in health for women and children.",M2

Women have been found to have a higher prevalence of vision loss than men. Early detection and timely treatment by eye-care providers are necessary to delay disease progression and prevent vision loss. To assess the use of professional eye care among women aged &gt; or = 40 years, CDC analyzed data from the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) for 19 U.S. states for the period 2006-2008. This report summarizes the results of that analysis, which indicated that 21% of women with self-reported DR, 12% of women with self-reported glaucoma, and 8% of women with self-reported ARMD did not visit an eye-care provider in the recommended follow-up period. Women who did not have insurance coverage for eye care or who did not receive routine medical check-ups were more likely to report not having the recommended follow-up eye care.

20442215,"Lung cancer screening in the randomized Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial.BACKGROUND: The 5-year overall survival rate of lung cancer patients is approximately 15%. Most patients are diagnosed with advanced-stage disease and have shorter survival rates than patients with early-stage disease. Although screening for lung cancer has the potential to increase early diagnosis, it has not been shown to reduce lung cancer mortality rates. In 1993, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial was initiated specifically to determine whether screening would reduce mortality rates from PLCO cancers. METHODS: A total of 77 464 participants, aged 55-74 years, were randomly assigned to the intervention arm of the PLCO Cancer Screening Trial between November 8, 1993, and July 2, 2001. Participants received a baseline chest radiograph (CXR), followed by three annual single-view CXRs at the 10 US screening centers. Cancers were classified as screen detected and nonscreen detected (interval or never screened) and according to tumor histology. The positivity rates of screen-detected cancers and positive predictive values (PPVs) were calculated. Because 51.6% of the participants were current or former smokers, logistic regression analysis was performed to control for smoking status. All statistical tests were two-sided. RESULTS: <e>Compliance</e> with screening decreased from 86.6% at baseline to 78.9% at the last screening. Overall positivity rates were 8.9% at baseline and 6.6%-7.1% at subsequent screenings; positivity rates increased modestly with smoking risk categories (P(trend) &lt; .001). The PPVs for all participants were 2.0% at baseline and 1.1%, 1.5%, and 2.4% at years 1, 2, and 3, respectively; PPVs in current smokers were 5.9% at baseline and 3.3%, 4.2%, and 5.6% at years 1, 2, and 3, respectively. A total of 564 lung cancers were diagnosed, of which 306 (54%) were screen-detected cancers and 87% were non-small cell lung cancers. Among non-small cell lung cancers, 59.6% of screen-detected cancers and 33.3% of interval cancers were early (I-II) stage. CONCLUSIONS: The PLCO Cancer Screening Trial demonstrated the ability to recruit, retain, and screen a large population over multiple years at multiple centers. A higher proportion of screen-detected lung cancers were early stage, but a conclusion on the effectiveness of CXR screening must await final PLCO results, which are anticipated at the end of 2015.",M2

METHODS: Adults admitted to the University of Alberta Hospital stroke service with a diagnosis of stroke or TIA between August 1st, 2005 and July 31st, 2006 were identified using International Classification of Diseases (10th Revision) codes. Two hundred charts were randomly selected for retrospective review. Compliance, defined as achievement of therapeutic targets or appropriate therapy for subtherapeutic targets, was assessed. RESULTS: Among 190 eligible patients (mean age 67 years, 55% male), 147 (77.4%) had a non-cardioembolic cerebral event while 43 (22.6%) had a cardioembolic cerebral event. We found high compliance for antithrombotic (92% [174/190]) and antihypertensive (95% [136/143]) agents, but suboptimal compliance for lipid lowering agents (68% [107/158]) and smoking cessation (27% [17/64]). CONCLUSIONS: There is room for improvement in early risk factor management for secondary prevention, even in specialized stroke centres. To optimize stroke preventative care, more interdisciplinary collaboration, investigation of reasons for suboptimal care, development of strategies to minimize care gaps and ongoing stroke care audits for quality improvement are needed.",M2
20437765,"Clinical prognostic factors for tinnitus retraining therapy with a sound generator in tinnitus patients.OBJECTIVES: The purpose of the present study is to find out the clinical characteristics which determine candidates for tinnitus retraining therapy (TRT) with a sound generator (SG) as well as the prognosis of this treatment. METHOD: This study enrolled 270 serious tinnitus patients who visited this institute between January 2004 and December 2008 in the TRT program. The relationships among <e>compliance</e>, efficacy, clinical characteristics, and affinity for SG were evaluated retrospectively. RESULTS: The persistence rate at one month was 61.5%. The shorter duration and higher pitch of tinnitus were significant independent predictors of compliance. Six months after the initiation of TRT, 65.2% subjects demonstrated significant relief from tinnitus. The Kaplan-Meier method demonstrated that the overall efficacy rate at 18 months was 86.5%. The lower loudness of tinnitus, recognition of tinnitus attenuation by a sound generator, and patient's positive attitude toward TRT were significant variables for predicting favorable results. CONCLUSION: The patients with lower loudness of tinnitus were suitable for TRT with a SG.",M2
20432754,"Cervical cytology and HPV test in follow-up after conisation or LLETZ.The patients treated with conservative surgical therapy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) have an increased risk to develop invasive cervical carcinoma compared to the general population. Cervical cytology and HPV test are included in the protocols for the detection of treatment failure. The purpose of the study was to analyse cytology-histology correlation after conisation or Large Loop Excision of the Transformation Zone (LLETZ), resection margin status, <e>compliance</e> to the follow-up protocol and evaluation of cervical cytology and HPV testing in two year period after surgical treatment. We retrospectively reviewed 251 cases of conisation or LLETZ performed between January and December, 2006. Conventional cervical smears were analysed and abnormal cytology was defined as atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance or worse (ASCUS+). The digene Hybrid capture 2 test was used for detection of high-risk HPV types. Histology analysis demonstrated CIN1 + lesion in 234 cases (93.2%) with cytology-histology correlation in 97.9% of cases. A preoperative HPV test was made in 142 histologically confirmed CIN1 + lesions and 137 (96.5%) tested positive. The resection margins were involved in 48 (20.8%) cases. In 24 (10.3%) cases the margins were difficult to determine. Abnormal cytology was found in 33 (15.2%) cases of the 217 (86.5%) patients that attended the post-treatment visits. The post-treatment HPV test was performed on 159 women and it was positive in 25 (15.7%) cases. The complete follow-up control cytology, with at least three Pap smears in the subsequent two years or with second treatment, was registered in only 146 (58.2%) patients. 14/217 (6.5%) patients underwent second treatment with histologically confirmed treatment failure. In all patients with control smear, repeated cytology found HSIL. On six women, the control HPV test was performed. In five cases, it was positive and in one case with histological diagnoses of VAIN2, it was negative. Our study confirms the important role of cervical cytology in the diagnosis of cervical intraepithelial lesions and monitoring after treatment. In the future we will have to improve compliance to the follow-up protocols and use of the HPV test in the selection of women at risk of treatment failure.",M2
20429742,"Very low calorie diet (VLCD) followed by a randomized trial of corset treatment for obesity in primary care.OBJECTIVE: The primary objective was to investigate the feasibility and cost-effectiveness of weight reduction using very low calorie diet (VLCD) in groups. The secondary objective was to investigate whether subsequent corset treatment could maintain the weight reduction long term. DESIGN: Participants, consecutively included in groups of 8-14 subjects, underwent three months of VLCD with lifestyle advice at group meetings. Subjects attaining &gt; or = 8 kg reduction were randomized to corset (A) or no corset (B) treatment for nine months. Weight was registered at all meetings and after 24 months. Costs were calculated using current salaries and anti-obesity drug prices as at 2008. SETTINGS: Primary care in Skaraborg, Sweden. Subjects. A total of 26 men and 65 women aged 30-60 years with BMI &gt; or = 30-&lt; 45 kg/m2. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Weight changes and costs of treatment. RESULTS: VLCD (dropout n = 14) resulted in a mean weight reduction of 20.1+/-6.6 kg (20 men) and 15.7+/-4.7 kg (57 women). These 77 subjects were randomized to treatment A (n = 39) or B (n = 38). <e>Compliance</e> with corset was only 20% after three months. After one year (dropout n = 17) weight loss was 11.7+/-8.1 kg (A) and 9.3+/-6.9 kg (B), p = 0.23 and after two years (dropout n = 22) 6.1+/-7.0 kg and 4.4+/-7.3 kg respectively, p = 0.94. Serum glucose and lipids were altered favourably. The cost per participant of treatments A and B was SEK 4440 and SEK 1940 respectively. CONCLUSIONS: VLCD in groups was feasible and reduced weight even after one year. The cost of treatment was lower than drug treatment. Corset treatment suffered from poor compliance and could therefore not be evaluated.",M2
20423436,"Dietary and fluid <e>compliance</e>: an educational intervention for patients having haemodialysis.AIM: This paper is a report of a study conducted to determine the effect of an educational intervention on dietary and fluid compliance in patients having haemodialysis. BACKGROUND: Many of the clinical problems experienced by patients having haemodialysis are related to their failure to eat appropriate foods and restrict their fluid intake. Educational intervention in patients having haemodialysis to improve their compliance with dietary and fluid restrictions appears to be effective. METHODS: Sixty-three patients having haemodialysis in three general hospitals in Tehran, Iran, were allocated into two groups at random for oral and/or video education. They were asked to give demographic and medical data. Bimonthly average values of serum potassium, sodium, calcium, phosphate, albumin, creatinine, uric acid, and blood urea nitrogen and interdialytic weight gain were measured before and after the teaching programmes. The data were collected in 2007. FINDINGS: Compliance in terms of biochemical parameters and interdialytic weight gain was observed in 63.5% and 76.2% of patients in the oral and video teaching groups respectively. Statistically significant correlations were observed between demographic variables (age, educational level and occupation) and dietary and fluid compliances (P &lt; 0.001). There was no difference between the effectiveness of two educational interventions. CONCLUSION: Nurses should emphasize sodium compliance in patients having haemodialysis and explain its adverse effects, such as excessive weight gain, hypertension, and peripheral oedema.",M2
20405639,"Parents' influence on the treatment of amblyopia in children.Amblyopia in children is a great problem that has to be identified on time and treatment initiated as early as possible to achieve optimal therapeutic result. Therapeutic success depends greatly on the children's parents' collaboration. It was the reason for us to embark upon this study to evaluate the parents' role in amblyopia treatment and their influence on the final therapeutic result. The aim of the study was to assess <e>compliance</e> with therapy prescribed, the degree to which the parents understood their children's health condition, and whether they were satisfied with their child's ophthalmologist. The study included 105 parents divided into three groups of 35 persons according to their educational level. All study parents filled out a questionnaire. The children's visual acuity measured before and after prescribed therapy was compared with the parents' answers to the questions. Among 105 children, post-therapeutic improvement in visual acuity was recorded in 66 (62.8%) children, whereas the rest of 39 (37.1%) children showed no therapeutic success. Statistical analysis yielded no significant difference in the rate of therapeutic success according to parent's educational level (P = 0.61). The best results were obtained in children with highest therapy compliance. It is of utmost importance for the ophthalmologist to gain parents' trust, which then leads them to better compliance with the therapeutic measures prescribed. This mode of approach requires more time, which, unfortunately, may not always be possible due to the great number of visits the ophthalmologist has to cover during working hours. Frequent ophthalmologic follow ups are mandatory to be sure that therapy is performed correctly and to prevent the possible unfavorable effects of noncompliance.",M2
20397346,"Assessing historical <e>compliance</e> with medical recommendations among transplant candidates: preliminary findings.CONTEXT: Noncompliance with medical recommendations by transplant candidates and recipients carries serious consequences for morbidity and mortality. Few patient-specific, objective measures for assessing historical compliance exist. OBJECTIVE: To address this gap, a psychometric and exploratory analysis of an interview-based, global measure of clinician-rated judgment of historical compliance was undertaken. METHODS: All findings are based on a retrospective chart review of the medical and psychosocial evaluations of 96 consecutive potential heart transplant candidates seen at a large Southeastern academic medical center. RESULTS: Preliminary results demonstrated adequate interrater reliability and discriminant validity for the measure. Additionally, results from hierarchical multivariable regression analysis revealed years of education to be positively associated with clinician-rated judgment of historical compliance. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides preliminary psychometric support for the use of a measure of historical compliance among heart transplant candidates. Findings from this study also are consistent with the literature to date and may be reflective of a psychobiological process that mediates the relationship between socioeconomic status and health outcomes.",M2
20394322,"Randomized controlled trial comparing flexible and continuous positive airway pressure delivery: effects on <e>compliance</e>, objective and subjective sleepiness and vigilance.STUDY OBJECTIVES: Positive airway pressure (PAP) treatment for obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) can be limited by suboptimal compliance. C-Flex technology (Philips Respironics, PA, USA) reduces pressure during expiration, aiming to improve comfort and therefore compliance. This may be of particular relevance to patients requiring high pressures. Many studies thus far have suffered from design limitations and small sample sizes. This study aimed to compare compliance with C-Flex and CPAP, as well as analyzing objective and subjective sleepiness and vigilance. DESIGN: Three-month, double-blinded, parallel-arm randomized controlled trial. SETTING: A university-based sleep laboratory. PATIENTS: 76 consecutive patients with severe OSA (mean +/- SD AHI 60.2 +/- 32.9 events/hour, ESS 13.6 +/- 4.5/24, BMI 35.6 +/- 7.8 kg/m2), without significant cardiac, respiratory, psychiatric, or sleep comorbidities. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized to C-Flex (dip level 2) or CPAP. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Patients underwent titration with C-Flex/CPAP (mean pressure 11.6 cm H2O). Modified maintenance of wakefulness tests (mod-MWT), psychomotor vigilance tasks (PVT) and questionnaires were administered at baseline and after one and 3 months. Median compliance was 5.51 and 5.89 h/night in the C-Flex and CPAP groups respectively (P = 0.82). There were no significant differences between groups in terms of PVT reaction time, subjective sleepiness, sleep quality, health-related quality of life, or treatment comfort. There was no significant difference between the groups regarding the change in mod-MWT sleep latency values. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with severe OSA both CPAP and C-Flex resulted in substantial improvements in sleepiness, vigilance, and quality of life. The use of C-Flex did not result in greater compliance, and neither treatment appeared superior.",M2
20378184,"Psychiatric health care provider attitudes towards implantable medication.Medication nonadherence is a major problem in psychiatry. Introduction of implantable psychiatric medication could alleviate the need to take daily medication, significantly decreasing the rate of nonadherence. This survey assessed psychiatric health care professionals' opinions regarding implants. An email was sent to potential participants including an explanation of the study and a link to an online survey. Email addresses of faculty in the Department of Psychiatry were obtained from websites of United States medical schools. To assess which provider characteristics were most important in consideration of implants, logistic regression models were employed. For assessing which patient characteristics were associated with providers' opinions, logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations tested associations between patient factors and implant decision. Eighty-six percent of respondents supported implants for a subset of patients. Four provider characteristics influenced support for implants including type of work, caseload, percent of patients with schizophrenia and percent of patients with bipolar disorder. Seven patient characteristics significantly influenced provider opinions including illness severity, length of illness, medication <e>compliance</e>, diagnosis, type of medication, family support, and patient age. Although dozens of factors influence the future of implants, the surveyed population showed moderate to strong support for this novel treatment.",M2
20372668,"A strategy for encouraging young adults' adoption of a preferred oral hygiene technique.PURPOSE: Adherence to dental preventive programmes in young adults is low. The aim of the present longitudinal study was to evaluate whether tutoring peers can be a <e>compliance</e>-enhancing tool or not. METHODS: In Part 1, two randomly selected classes (49 female students, mean age 19.8 + or - 2.3 years) were taught adult toothbrushing technique (the modified Bass technique) in a project-like manner. After the course, knowledge was tested using a class test, and compliance was evaluated using anonymous quantitative questionnaires. Compliance was defined as a reported degree of change from the easy-to-learn childhood toothbrushing techniques to the more efficient and challenging Bass technique. In Part 2 of the present longitudinal study, the compliance of these students was re-evaluated after having developed and applied themselves a programme of how to tutor peers in oral health. Re-evaluation of compliance was performed after 3 and 9 months. RESULTS: In Part 1, 28.5% of the students were compliant after 1 week. Compared with Part 1, the compliance in Part 2 was significantly higher (P u 0.001), both after 3 months (90%) and after 9 months (82%). CONCLUSIONS: Tutoring peers can significantly enhance the compliance over a period of 9 months. Tutoring can function as a form of empowerment and can establish a strong sustained health engagement. Tutoring peers in health-related subjects can readily be implemented in schools and might be an additional means of oral health promotion with fewer additional costs.",M2

20367838,"Dynamical difference in patients encounters involving uncontrolled diabetes: an orbital decomposition analysis.RATIONALE: Poor glucose control is common in patients with type 2 diabetes. Little is known about the dynamics within the doctor-patient encounter that might explain this phenomenon. The purpose of this study was to compare dynamics of encounters with and without a hypoglycaemic medication change for patients with poorly controlled diabetes. METHODS: The doctor-patient encounters of 182 patients with type 2 diabetes from 20 primary care clinics were audio-recorded and transcribed. Encounters were coded using the Davis Observation Codes (DOCs), classifying content into 20 different categories, for example, chatting or history taking, at 15 second intervals. Of the 60 encounters in which the A1C &gt; 8.0, 25 involved a medication change. Fifteen patients were randomly selected from those with a change in medication as well as fifteen patients from those without a change in medication for analysis using orbital decomposition. 'Orbital decomposition' is an analytic technique based on symbolic dynamics in which categorical time series data, such as a string of DOCs, are used to identify amount of complexity present and recurrent patterns of strings. RESULTS: Encounters with a change were longer (mean 20 versus 15.5 minutes) and included more time planning treatment (29% versus 23%). Encounters with and without a change displayed similar degrees of non-linearity, but change encounters were slightly more non-linear (D(Lyapunov) = 1.94 versus 1.75). Encounters with a change had more structure to them: they had many more DOC strings (60 versus 33 strings occurring at least three times), and those DOC strings more often linked treatment planning to history taking, chatting, health education, physical examination and <e>compliance</e> assessment. Encounters without a change linked treatment planning to history taking, compliance assessment and nutrition counselling but had no strings with chatting or evaluation and feedback. CONCLUSION: In conclusion, the doctor's decision to change medication may be made before the encounter, thus the different strings of DOC codes observed. Chatting and evaluation and feedback may be strategies to increase trust before recommending a medication change.",M2
20357630,"BAHA in single-sided deafness: patient <e>compliance</e> and subjective benefit.OBJECTIVE: Despite most patients with single-sided deafness (SSD) after operation for acoustic neuroma (AN) perceiving a significant hearing handicap, less than 25% are interested in bone-anchored hearing aid (BAHA) implantation. We evaluated the treatment compliance of BAHA in SSD and the effect of BAHA on the subjective handicap. METHODS: Part 1: It was determined, from our first study, how many of the SDD patients after operation for AN (n = 59) and interested in BAHA (n = 14) had been implanted. Part 2: Of 23 BAHA-implanted patients with SSD due to various causes, including the implanted patients from the previous study, 21 answered a questionnaire on the BAHA treatment compliance and the subjective handicap with and without BAHA. RESULTS: Part 1: Of the 14 patients from our first study who were interested in implantation for BAHA, 11 had been implanted (18.6% of all 59 patients). Part 2: Of the 21 patients with SSD, 95% still used BAHA, and of these, 81% used it more than 8 hours a day. Of the patients, 90% considered BAHA a moderate to significant aid; it reduced the subjective hearing handicap from 7.4 to 2.3 arbitrary units on a visual analog scale. CONCLUSION: Despite the subjective handicap perception among most patients with SSD after AN surgery, less than 20% chose treatment with BAHA. Conversely, patients with SSD choosing implantation had high treatment compliance and felt that BAHA reduced their handicap. Thus, when selected by the patients after testing, BAHA is effective in SSD and results in a high patient compliance.",M2
20346337,"Uninsured South Florida vascular surgery patients are less likely to receive optimal medical management than their insured counterparts.OBJECTIVE: Vascular disease is the most prevalent condition in patients aged &gt;60 years, leading to increasing complications associated with their comorbid conditions. Poor medical <e>compliance</e> could be one reason why the rate of complications may be higher in this patient population, particularly the uninsured. This study was conducted to better assess rates of medication compliance in vascular surgical patients. METHODS: Consecutive patients seen in vascular clinics at a busy tertiary academic center were prospectively studied. Physicians and physician assistants used a standardized questionnaire to collect patient data and evaluated patients for coexisting medical conditions and medication use. Optimal medical therapy was defined according to the 2006 American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC)  Guidelines for Secondary Prevention for Atherosclerotic Vascular Disease.  Data were analyzed using multivariate regression. RESULTS: During the 4-month study period, 180 consecutive patients (47% men) were seen in vascular surgery clinics. Most patients (79%) were nonsmokers and only 21% admitted to smoking. Comorbid conditions surveyed included hypertension in 141, diabetes mellitus in 56, coronary artery disease in 24, hypercholesterolemia in 89, and chronic renal failure in 13; of these, 61% were insured and 39% had no insurance. Overall, only 31% of all patients were receiving adequate medical therapy for their comorbid conditions, and about 66% were receiving suboptimal medical treatment for their vascular disease. Uninsured patients were less likely (19%) than insured patients (39%) to receive optimal medical therapy (P = .012). Lack of insurance was a predictor of suboptimal medical therapy for hypertension (odds ratio [OR], 3.13; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-8.16; P = .016), hypercholesterolemia (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 1.87-13.88; P = .001), peripheral arterial disease (OR, 13.32; 95% CI, 2.84-62.54, P &lt; .001), and any disease overall (OR, 2.43; 95% CI, 1.21-4.88, P = .012). Overall, men and women were equally likely (68%) to receive suboptimal medical therapy; however, women were significantly more likely to be undertreated for coronary artery disease (OR, 0.022; 95% CI, 0.0017-0.293; P &lt; .001). CONCLUSIONS: Compliance with optimal medical therapy for secondary risk factor management amongst our vascular surgery patients is low. Uninsured patients are less likely to receive optimal medical therapy than their insured counterparts. This survey provides sobering statistics regarding medical compliance in our population. This issue deserves further study and may indirectly affect outcomes in minority groups that are disproportionately represented in our uninsured patients.",M2

20348453,"Current prescribing patterns of elastic compression stockings post-deep venous thrombosis.OBJECTIVES: Post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS) is a complication of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) characterized by chronic pain, swelling and heaviness, and may result in ulceration. Elastic compression stockings (ECS) worn daily after DVT appear to reduce the incidence and severity of PTS. The aims of our study were to investigate practices and perceptions of DVT patients and physicians regarding the use of ECS after DVT. METHODS: Two surveys were conducted. The first was sent to 225 staff and trainee clinicians and the second was administered to 150 DVT patients. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the majority of senior staff (75%) believed that ECS were effective in preventing PTS and in managing venous symptoms. However, this was in contrast with junior trainees (21%) (P &lt; 0.05). This resulted in only 63% of patients being prescribed ECS post-DVT. There was a lack of consensus as regards the optimal timing of initiation of ECS, duration of therapy and compression strength. Nearly all DVT patients who were prescribed ECS purchased them, 74% wore them daily, and most (61%) reported that ECS relieved swelling and symptoms. Physicians correctly predicted the main reasons for non-<e>compliance</e>, but misjudged the scale of patient compliance with ECS. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that there is a lack of consensus among doctors regarding ECS use after DVT and widespread education regarding the latest evidence of the benefit of ECS after DVT.",M2

20347686,"Chronic venous disease progression and modification of predisposing factors.AIM: This study evaluated long-term characteristics of chronic venous disease (CVD) progression and its correlation with the modification of specific risk factors. METHODS: The contralateral limb of 73 patients (95% women; mean age, 48 +/- 12 years) undergoing varicose vein surgery was prospectively evaluated using physical and color duplex examination and classified by CEAP. After 5 years of follow-up, development of new sites of reflux among the contralateral, preoperatively asymptomatic limbs and modification of predisposing factors, including prolonged orthostatism, obesity, estrogen therapy (ET), multiparity, and elastic stockings use (ESU), were assessed. Data were analyzed with Pearson chi(2), t test, binary logistic regression, and Spearman rho. RESULTS: Forty-eight new sites of reflux (superficial system, 37; perforators, 5; deep veins, 6) were revealed in 38 limbs (52%). CEAP scores significantly deteriorated: clinical, 2.2 +/- 0.5 from 0.1 +/- 0.03 (P &lt; .01); anatomic, 3.8 +/- 1.2 from 2.6 +/- 2.5 (P &lt; .05); disability, 1.9 +/- 0.7 from 0 (P &lt; .01); and severity, 7.9 +/- 2.4 from 2.7 +/- 2.2 (P &lt; .01). Patient <e>compliance</e> to predisposing factor modification was low; no change was observed during follow-up (orthostatism, P = .9; obesity, P = 0.7; ET, P = .9; multiparity, P = .4; ESU, P = .3). CVD progression was significantly lower in patients who controlled orthostatism vs those who maintained orthostatism or initiated it (P &lt; .001) and in patients who controlled preoperative obesity vs those who became obese or maintained obesity (P &lt; .001). Non-ESU patients had a significantly higher incidence of CVD progression vs those who started ESU or continued during the study (P &lt; .001). By binary logistic regression analysis, orthostatism (P = .002; B coefficient value [BCV] = 1.745), obesity (P = .009; BCV = 1.602), and ESU (P = .037; BCV = 0.947) were independent predictive factors for CVD progression, whereas multiparity (P = .174) and ET (P = .429) were not. CONCLUSIONS: In about half of patients with unilateral varicosities, CVD developed in the contralateral initially asymptomatic limb in 5 years. CVD progression consisted of reflux development and clinical deterioration of the affected limbs. Obesity, orthostatism, and noncompliance with ESU were independent risk factors for CVD progression, but ET and multiparity were not. Maintenance of a normal body weight, limitation of prolonged orthostatism, and systematic ESU may be recommended in patients with CVD to limit future disease progression.",M2
20347681,"A prospective randomized controlled study with intermittent mechanical compression of the calf in patients with claudication.OBJECTIVES: The study tested the feasibility of using a new portable mechanical compression device for the treatment of claudication. The device applies intermittent non-pneumatic mechanical compression (IMC) to the calf. It was hypothesized that it can offer a low-cost convenient option for patients and achieve good <e>compliance</e> and improved clinical outcomes. METHODS: Thirty patients were enrolled in a randomized controlled single blind study. Fourteen patients were assigned to active IMC. Sixteen control patients continued with medical treatment alone. Outcomes were recorded at baseline, after one month, three months, and six months. The study examined changes in exercise tolerance using Initial Claudiacation Distance (ICD) and Absolute Claudiaction Distance (ACD) as well as ankle-brachial index at rest (ABI-r) and post-exercise (ABI-pe). All patients had stable claudication due to peripheral arterial disease (PAD) and were already under best medical treatment (BMT). To be eligible for inclusion, patients had to be between the ages of 50 and 75 years, had to have stable claudication with an absolute claudication distance &gt;40 meters but &lt;300 meters on a standardized treadmill stress test (3.8 km/h at a 10% grade), have a resting ABI in the affected limb &lt;0.8 with a drop of at least 0.15 following exercise, in whom surgical intervention was not expected for at least three months. Fourteen patients were assigned to active IMC consisting of compressions 65 mm Hg in amplitude, applied for three 3-second compressions/minute, two hours/day for three months. Sixteen control patients continued with BMT alone. RESULTS: One month after treatment, ICD increased by 66% (P = .001), ACD increased by 51.75% (P = .005), and ABI-pe increased by 42% (P = .01). Treatment effects were maintained or further improved after three months. ABI-r did not increase at any time. Compliance exceeded 80%. Three months following cessation of therapy, claudication distances and ABI-pe did not decrease significantly. CONCLUSIONS: We concluded that the use of IMC of the calf for three months increased claudication distances and led to objective improvements in ABI-pe. Intermittent mechanical compression may be a useful approach to patients with continued claudication despite standard medical treatment.",M2
20335903,"Pharmacological treatment of combat-induced PTSD: a literature review.Historically, soldiers have returned from war changed men. Over the years there has been an increase in awareness of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and the impact of diagnosis. Treatment of PTSD presents a challenge on every level.

20306860,"<e>Compliance</e> with preventive care following dental treatment of children under general anaesthesia.OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the self-reported preventive dental care compliance of parents/families whose children received dental treatment under general anaesthesia. STUDY DESIGN: Complete records of 68 pediatric patients who attended the University of Stellenbosch's Paediatric Dentistry Department for dental treatment were included in the survey. Parents of 41 (60%) patients were interviewed telephonically to evaluate parental dental health knowledge and preventive practices. RESULTS: The majority (85%) of parents had a good idea about the aetiology of dental caries. An assessment of the children's dental health behaviour reveals that parents were mostly responsible for brushing the childs' teeth (44%).The majority of parents (51%) reported that following dental treatment of the child under general anaesthesia, there was no change in their child's frequency of sugar consumption. Sixty-three percent of children treated under GA had returned for the one-week follow-up. However, only 22% of children returned for the three-month follow up appointment. Parents were informed about the importance of these follow-up appointments. CONCLUSION: Parental belief that proper dental health behaviour helps maintain the teeth, did not influence parents preventive compliance, despite them having received preventive instruction. Parents were mostly responsible for brushing their child's teeth following dental treatment of their children under general anaesthesia. This research found however that, in the majority of cases there was no change in the children's frequency of sugar intake.",M2
20306768,"HPV vaccination coverage among adolescents aged 9 to 17 years in a United States military treatment facility.Human papilloma virus (HPV) is expected to infect 80% of the United States female population. The vaccine Gardasil protects against four types of HPV. Routine administration of Gardasil began at Womack Army Medical Center (WAMC) in November 2006. This research looks at vaccine <e>compliance</e> among girls aged 9 to 17 years. Medical records of all females aged 9 to 17 enrolled at WAMC (n = 6,154) were examined using the Composite Health Care System (CHCS) database. Patients identified with CPT code 90649, HPV vaccine were included. Of girls enrolled at WAMC, 22.9% (n = 1,406) began the vaccine series. Among girls aged 9 to 17 years age, only 25.7% completed the entire 3 injection series; 34.6% received 2 injections, and 39.7% received 1 dose (P = .006). WAMC falls slightly below the national norm in administering the Gardasil vaccination series. Because at least six months is required to complete the series, however, some patients who received the first dose might not have had sufficient time to complete the series during the data collection period. Findings show that 77% of girls aged 12 to 17 years have not yet been vaccinated.",M2
20305844,"Mandibular implant overdentures followed for over 10 years: patient <e>compliance</e> and prosthetic maintenance.PURPOSE: The mandibular implant overdenture is a popular treatment modality and is well documented in the literature. Follow-up studies with a long observation period are difficult to perform due to the increasing age of patients. The present data summarize a long-term clinical observation of patients with implant overdentures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between 1984 and 1997, edentulous patients were consecutively admitted for treatment with an implant overdenture. The dentures were connected to the implants by means of bars or ball anchors. Regular maintenance was provided with at least one or two scheduled visits per year. Recall attendance and reasons for dropout were analyzed based on the specific history of the patient. Denture maintenance service, relining, repair, and fabrication of new dentures were identified, and complications with the retention devices specified separately. RESULTS: In the time period from 1984 to 2008, 147 patients with a total of 314 implants had completed a follow-up period of &gt;10 years. One hundred one patients were still available in 2008, while 46 patients were not reexamined for various reasons. Compliance was high, with a regular recall attendance of &gt;90%. More than 80% of dentures remained in continuous service. Although major prosthetic maintenance was rather low in relation to the long observation period, visits to a dental hygienist and dentist resulted in an annual visit rate of 1.5 and 2.4, respectively. If new dentures became necessary, these were made in student courses, which increased the treatment time and number of appointments needed. Complications with the retention devices consisted mostly of the mounting of new female retainers, the repair of bars, and the changing of ball anchors. The average number of events and the rate of prosthetic service with ball anchors were significantly higher than those with bars. Twenty-two patients changed from ball anchors to bars; 9 patients switched from a clip bar to a rigid U-shaped bar. CONCLUSIONS: This long-term follow-up study demonstrates that implant overdentures are a favorable solution for edentulous patients with regular maintenance. In spite of specific circumstances in an aging population, it is possible to provide long-term care, resulting in a good prognosis and low risk for this treatment modality. For various reasons the dropout rate can be considerable in elderly patients and prosthetic service must be provided regularly.",M2
20305369,"Effects of physical training on aerobic capacity in frail elderly people (75+ years). Influence of lung capacity, cardiovascular disease and medical drug treatment: a randomized controlled pilot trial.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Frail elderly people often suffer from a combination of unintentional weight loss and/or low body mass index, as well as a low physical activity level. No studies have investigated the effect of physical training alone or in combination with nutritional intervention on aerobic capacity in frail elderly people. The aim of this pilot study was to determine if a physical training program can affect aerobic capacity in frail elderly people. METHODS: Ninety-six community-dwelling frail elderly people (58 women) were included in the study. Subjects were randomized to four different groups: i) physical training program (aerobic, muscle strength, balance), ii) a nutritional intervention program (individually targeted advice and group sessions), iii) a combination of these interventions, and iv) a control group. At baseline, subjects were screened for aerobic capacity, leg muscle strength, spirometry, heart disease and cardiovascular drugs. Aerobic capacity and leg muscle strength were analyzed immediately after the 3-month intervention period (1st follow-up), and after another 6 months (2nd follow-up). RESULTS: Subjects mean age was 83 years. The mean <e>compliance</e> rate with the physical training program was 65%. There were no observed effects on aerobic capacity measured as maximal workload, or work time, with or without beta-receptor blockade. Subjects in the training groups without lung disease significantly increased maximal work time when compared with subjects with lung disease. Physical training significantly increased lower extremity muscle strength compared with nutrition alone at the 1st follow-up. No serious adverse events occurred during assessment or physical training. CONCLUSIONS: Further studies with larger sample sizes and a more specific aerobic component in the training program are necessary before any further conclusions can be drawn.",M2

20303526,"<e>Compliance</e> with antibiotic prophylaxis in children with vesicoureteral reflux: results from a national pharmacy claims database.PURPOSE: Antibiotic prophylaxis is commonly used for medical management of vesicoureteral reflux. Little information exists on compliance with antibiotic prophylaxis in patients with vesicoureteral reflux. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We queried the i3 Innovus (Ingenix) pharmacy claims 2002 to 2007 database for patients 18 years old or younger with vesicoureteral reflux (ICD-9 code 593.7 plus claim for cystogram) and analyzed those with at least 1 year of followup data. Criteria for management with antibiotic prophylaxis were 2 or more 30-day supplies of antibiotic prescriptions, or 4 or more 14-day supplies of prescriptions if the antibiotic was a penicillin or cephalosporin. Antibiotic prophylaxis compliance was determined using a medication possession ratio, an estimate of the proportion of time that patients have a prescribed drug available for use. Compliance was established as a medication possession ratio of 80% or greater, meaning coverage with antibiotic prophylaxis for 80% of the year or more. RESULTS: Of 9,496 patients with vesicoureteral reflux 5,342 (56.3%) were treated with antibiotic prophylaxis. Most patients were female (81%) and 5 years old or younger (79%). Trimethoprims/sulfonamides were most commonly prescribed (62%) and antiseptics were next (24%). Of patients prescribed antibiotic prophylaxis 40% were compliant. Compliance was lower for 6 to 10-year-olds (OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.61-0.83) and 11 to 18-year-olds (OR 0.56, 95% CI 0.41-0.79) compared to younger children (5 years or less). Increased compliance was associated with 1 or more hospitalizations (OR 1.70, 95% CI 1.48-1.97) and 1 or more urologist visits (OR 1.41, 95% CI 1.25-1.58). CONCLUSIONS: Among patients with vesicoureteral reflux who are prescribed prophylactic antibiotics 40% are compliant with treatment. Young age, frequent hospitalization and specialist visits are associated with compliance. This knowledge may help to develop effective interventions to improve compliance and underscores the importance of reporting compliance in clinical studies evaluating the usefulness of antibiotic prophylaxis in vesicoureteral reflux management.",M2
20298399,"Effect of asthma <e>compliance</e> enhancement training on asthma control in patients on combination therapy with salmeterol/fluticasone propionate: a randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: We investigated if a higher proportion of adults with previously uncontrolled asthma can achieve total control when given salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (50/250 microg) bid and compliance enhancement training (CET) compared to those given medication alone. METHODS: Open comparison of stable, but uncontrolled, adult asthmatics. After a 12-week treatment period on salmeterol/fluticasone propionate (period 1), patients who failed to achieve control were randomised to continuing treatment with or without CET for 12 weeks (period 2). The primary end point was the proportion achieving total control of their asthma in 7 of the last 8 consecutive weeks of period 2. RESULTS: A total of 361 subjects (50.4% males, mean age 40.0 +/- 14.4 years) in 29 centres were included, of whom 75.9% were randomised into treatment period 2 (n = 140 in the intervention group). The proportion of subjects achieving total asthma control was 8.8% and 7.6%, respectively, in the intervention and control group [not significant (NS)]. Mean morning peak flow, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV(1)), asthma symptom score and quality of life improved significantly over the study period in both treatment groups. Furthermore, proportion of days with use of rescue medication declined from 59.7% +/- 34.6% (55.7% +/- 35.3%) during screening to 20.3% +/- 29.2% (19.4% +/- 30.9%) during treatment period 2 (NS). CONCLUSION: CET failed to increase the likelihood of achieving total control in asthmatics on salmeterol/fluticasone propionate compared to subjects receiving medication only. However, both groups had a significant improvement in asthma control. (Clinical Trials.gov number, NCT00351143)",M2
20235421,"Lack of <e>compliance</e> with national vaccination guidelines in oncology patients receiving radiation therapy.Cancer patients are at increased risk for potentially life-threatening infections. Patient safety goals recently issued by the Joint Commission on the Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) and current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) guidelines recommend vaccinations for all cancer patients over the age of 65 (for Pneumococcus) and 50 years of age (annually, for Influenza). The authors investigated vaccination practices in patients over a season of risk at a university-based outpatient cancer treatment clinic. Of 204 patients recruited, 196 (93%) completed the survey. Overall, 30% of patients reported never receiving the Influenza vaccine (33% of patients &gt;50 years old), and 56% reported never receiving the Pneumococcal vaccine (30% of patients &gt;65 years old). Only 7% of patients reported being asked or informed about vaccination by their oncologists. Substantial proportions of patients undergoing cancer treatment have not received vaccinations as recommended by national guidelines. The reasons cited for lack of compliance seem correctable, and doing so would potentially prevent mortality and morbidity, thereby improving the care of cancer patients. Recommended vaccinations may now include that for the Influenza A virus (H1N1).",M2
20235087,"<e>Compliance</e> with enhanced recovery programmes in elective colorectal surgery.BACKGROUND: Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols are often criticized for being difficult to implement outside clinical trials. This audit evaluated compliance with an ERAS protocol and compared it with that during a trial. METHODS: Compliance was audited by case-note review of 100 consecutive patients undergoing colorectal surgery. This was compared with the compliance in a group of 95 patients who participated in a clinical trial. RESULTS: Fewer patients in the audit group than in the study group received preoperative oral carbohydrate loading (61.0 versus 96 per cent; P &lt; 0.001), a transverse incision (25.0 versus 39 per cent; P = 0.037), early fluid and diet reintroduction (73.0 versus 99 per cent; P &lt; 0.001), and non-opiate postoperative oral analgesia (70.0 versus 99 per cent; P &lt; 0.001). Lower non-opiate oral analgesia use in the audit group was not associated with a commensurate increase in opiate use (P = 0.061). There was no difference between groups in length of hospital stay (median (interquartile range) 7 (5-8) versus 6 (5-7) days respectively), septic morbidity or 30-day mortality rates. CONCLUSION: Observance to some aspects of the ERAS protocol was lower outside the clinical trial. However, this made little difference to patient outcome.",M2
20234287,"E-prescribing and primary noncompliance: physician and patient experience.PURPOSE/OBJECTIVES: The success of medication therapy, regardless of how it is prescribed, hinges on patient adherence starting with primary <e>compliance</e> (filling prescriptions.) This study examined primary noncompliance (PNC) in the context of e-prescribing (e-Rx). PRIMARY PRACTICE SETTING: An e-Rx-promotion project was supplemented by mailed alerts to clinicians in private practice regarding PNC to improve adherence to therapy. We included physicians who were willing to participate and plan members who received prescriptions from these providers. Physicians and patients were surveyed about their experience with e-Rx and PNC. FINDINGS/CONCLUSIONS: The rate of PNC was 15%. Provider survey respondents indicated satisfaction with e-Rx (83%.) Most of them were satisfied with improved office efficiency (74%) and certain e-Rx features. Patient survey results indicated that the top 2 reasons for PNC were perception of lack of efficacy and concern about side effects. High cost and absence of symptoms ranked next. Only 34% of patients felt that e-Rx improves medication safety significantly, and many of them were not aware of e-Rx use by their physicians. Most patients and physicians reported being comfortable discussing PNC. IMPLICATIONS FOR CASE MANAGEMENT PRACTICE: PNC is a significant cause of poor adherence to drug therapy, and nonfinancial patient concerns are the primary reason. Mailed PNC alerts to providers are resource intensive and may be supplanted by certain e-Rx standards. Clinicians who adopted e-Rx report a largely positive experience with e-Rx. Recent changes in Medicare rules will impact the use of this technology but challenges remain and require continued support to hasten the adoption of e-Rx. Case management programs may improve primary compliance by incorporating exchange of e-Rx data.",M2

20225911,"An intervention for VA patients with congestive heart failure.OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of a telephone intervention to improve quality of life among patients with congestive heart failure (CHF). STUDY DESIGN: Prospective randomized study. METHODS: Single-site recruitment of 458 patients using Veterans Health Administration care into a randomized controlled trial with a 1-year preintervention data collection period and a 1-year intervention and follow-up period. To compensate for imbalanced study groups, propensity scores were included in adjusted models of quality of life, satisfaction with care, inpatient utilization, survival, and costs of care. RESULTS: Patients aged 45 to 95 years participated in the study; 22% were of Hispanic race/ethnicity, and 7% were African American. All but 5 were male, consistent with the older population among veterans. At baseline, 40% were in Goldman Specific Activity Scale class I, 42% were in class III, 6% were in class II or IV, and 12% were unclassified. Patients scored a mean (SD) of 14 (1.5) points below the norm on the physical component score. After the yearlong intervention, no differences in clinical outcomes were noted between the intervention group and the control group. The CHF-related costs were higher for the intervention group, as were overall costs that included the cost of the intervention. Intervention group patients reported better <e>compliance</e> with weight monitoring and exercise recommendations. CONCLUSIONS: A risk-stratified intervention for patients with CHF resulted in potential behavioral improvements but no survival benefit. A high-cost high-intensity intervention may be required to improve survival for patients with CHF. Inclusion of the costs of interventions is recommended for future researchers.",M2

METHODS: Survey of caregivers of 205 infants from birth to 24 months at 2 rural and 2 urban private pediatric practices in Southwest Tennessee. RESULTS: Income was a significant predictor (P &lt; 0.05) of caregivers' awareness of sleep position recommendations. Awareness rates were 74% among respondents with an income of less than $20,000 and 98% among those earning above $80,000. The primary source of sleep position recommendations for lower income and African American respondents was hospital staff; higher income and European Americans reported printed materials as the primary source. Among respondents who were aware of the recommendations but noncompliant, 60% reported infant preference as the primary influence on choice of sleep position. CONCLUSIONS: Based on this study, particular emphasis needs to be placed on reaching out to lower income groups to disseminate the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) sleep positioning recommendations. The importance of positioning infants supine for sleep must be stressed before mother and baby are discharged from the hospital. Caregivers need to understand that many infants prefer to sleep on their stomachs, but there are ways to help babies adapt to supine sleeping.",M2

DESIGN: Cohort study (the PROHTECT trial). Settings Noord-Holland and Flevoland regions of the Netherlands, December 2006 to December 2007, including 13 laboratories, gynaecologists, and more than 800 general practitioners. PARTICIPANTS: 28 073 women who had not responded to two invitations to the regular cervical screening programme: 27 792 women were assigned to the self sampling group and invited to submit a self collected cervicovaginal sample for HPV testing; 281 were assigned to the recall control group and received a second re-invitation for conventional cytology. INTERVENTION: Women with a positive result on the high risk HPV test on their self sample material were referred to their general practitioner. Women with abnormal results on cytology were referred for colposcopy. Women with normal results on cytology were re-evaluated after one year by cytology and high risk HPV testing and referred for colposcopy if either result was positive. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Attendance rate in both groups and yield of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grade II/III or worse (&gt;or=CIN II/&gt;or=CIN III) in self sampling responders. RESULTS: The <e>compliance</e> rate in the self sampling group was significantly higher than in the control group (crude 26.6% v 16.4%, P&lt;0.001; adjusted 27.5% v 16.6%, P&lt;0.001). The number of detected &gt;or=CIN II and &gt;or=CIN III lesions in self sampling responders was 99 (1.3%) and 76 (1.0%), respectively. Self sampling responders who had not participated in the previous round of screening (43%) had increased relative risks of &gt;or=CIN II (2.04, 95% confidence interval 1.27 to 3.28) and &gt;or=CIN III (2.28, 1.31 to 3.96) compared with self sampling women who had been screened in the previous round (57%). CONCLUSIONS: Offering self sampling by sending a device for collecting cervicovaginal specimens for high risk HPV testing to women who did not attend regular screening is a feasible and effective method of increasing coverage in a screening programme. The response rate and the yield of high grade lesions support implementation of this method for such women. Trial registration ISRCTN45527158.",M2

The present study investigates: (1) the validity of this index by comparing DQI scores for preschool children with nutrient intakes, both of which were derived from 3 d estimated diet records; (2) the reproducibility of the DQI for preschoolers based on a parentally reported forty-seven-item FFQ DQI, which was repeated after 5 weeks; (3) the relative validity of the FFQ DQI with 3 d record DQI scores as reference. The study sample included 510 and 58 preschoolers (2.5-6.5 years) for validity and reproducibility analyses, respectively. Increasing 3 d record DQI scores were associated with decreasing consumption of added sugars, and increasing intakes of fibre, water, Ca and many micronutrients. Mean FFQ DQI test-retest scores were not significantly different: 72 (sd 11) v. 71 (sd 10) (P = 0.218) out of a maximum of 100. Mean 3 d record DQI score (66 (sd 10)) was significantly lower than mean FFQ DQI (71 (sd 10); P &lt; 0.001). The reproducibility correlation was 0.88.

METHOD: This is a retrospective study exploring appointment compliance for an HIV treatment based on an outreach intervention. Information regarding the medical and psychosocial appointments of 185 patients of the HIV-Drug Addiction outpatient unit, at the University of Montreal Hospital Centre (CHUM), has been collected for a one-year period (2006-2007). The compliance rate of appointments has been calculated according to the type of care provided: 1) conventional, provided only in the clinic at the  fixed  location, and 2) outreach-based, when the team at the fixed location is complemented by the intervention of a  mobile  team for the more unstable patients. RESULTS: Compliance rates for medical and psychosocial appointments in patients receiving care solely at the fixed location is 61.4%. For those whom care is received at the fixed location while complemented by the mobile team, the corresponding rate is 73.9%. This is an elevated compliance rate, higher than those generally reported for outreach-based programs. CONCLUSION: These results lend support to the success of programs integrating an outreach-based intervention for a vulnerable clientele. Indeed, appointment compliance in those who are more disorganized, for which the mobile team has intervened, has proven comparable and even superior to compliance with appointments when treatment is only received at the fixed location.",M2
20209395,"Does Ochsner-Sherren regimen still hold true in the management of appendicular mass?BACKGROUND: Although proposed as far back as 1901, conservative management for appendicular mass is still widely practiced. With a few recent series outlining the advantages of early appendicectomy for appendicular mass, we tried to investigate the feasibility of such an approach in this retrospective study. METHODS: We analyzed retrospectively 506 patients (240 male, 266 female) who underwent emergency appendicectomy for suspected appendicitis and appendicular mass between January 2005 and December 2007. Patients with sub-acute/chronic appendicitis and interval appendicectomy were excluded. The postoperative outcomes were compared between the two groups of patients classified as with or without the mass. RESULTS: A total of 506 patients were included in the study, of which 114 had appendicular mass. A comparison of the two groups demonstrated no major complications in either group. There was significantly increased incidence of minor complications in the group of patients with mass, although the incidence of wound infection showed no significance difference between the two groups. There was a significantly increased usage of drain/duration of stay in patients with mass. CONCLUSION: Low morbidity, reduced hospital stay, low cost, and patient <e>compliance</e> favor early operative management for appendicular mass, and it also avoids the possibility of missing entities like intestinal/peritoneal tuberculosis, which have similar presentations and are especially common in a country like India.",M2
20207272,"Qualitative examination of <e>compliance</e> in heart failure patients in The Netherlands.BACKGROUND: Noncompliance with pharmacological and nonpharmacological recommendations is a problem in many heart failure (HF) patients, leading to worse symptoms and readmission. Although knowledge is available regarding factors related to compliance with HF regimens, little is known about patients' perspectives. We investigated patients' reasons and motivations for compliance with HF regimens from their perspective, and we studied how patients manage these recommendations in daily life. The health belief model was used as a framework for this study. METHODS: A qualitative descriptive study was used, and 15 HF patients were interviewed about reasons for compliance, barriers to compliance, interventions that helped them comply with medications, sodium restriction, fluid restriction, and daily weighing. RESULTS: The most commonly reported reasons for compliance included fear of hospitalization and HF symptoms. Barriers to compliance were mainly related to the negative aspects of a regimen, e.g., taste of the food and thirst. Most patients tried to make their lifestyle changes part of the daily routine. Several problems and misunderstandings with the regimen were evident. Patients themselves offered many tips that helped them comply with the regimen. CONCLUSIONS: To improve compliance in HF patients, patient-tailored interventions must be targeted at specific problems and patients' beliefs regarding the regimen, and aim at implementing the regimen into daily life. Healthcare providers need to emphasize the benefits of compliance, motivate patients to comply, and focus on individual barriers to compliance, knowledge deficits, and misunderstandings regarding the regimen. More specific advice about medications and diet is needed. Group interventions, including tips patients themselves provide, might also be useful in helping patients implement the HF regimen in their daily lives.",M2
20205345,"Potential clinical and economic impact of nonadherence with osteoporosis medications.This study aims to estimate the potential clinical and economic implications of therapeutic adherence to bisphosphonate therapy. A validated Markov microsimulation model was used to estimate the impact of varying adherence to bisphosphonate therapy on outcomes (the number of fractures and the quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs]), health-care costs, and the cost-effectiveness of therapy compared with no treatment. Adherence was divided into persistence and <e>compliance</e>, and multiple scenarios were considered for both concepts. Analyses were performed for women aged 65 years with a bone mineral density T-score of -2.5. Health outcomes and the cost-effectiveness of therapy improved significantly with increasing compliance and/or persistence. In the case of real-world persistence and with a medical possession ratio (MPR; i.e., the number of doses taken divided by the number of doses prescribed) of 100%, the QALY gain and the number of fractures prevented represented only 48 and 42% of the values estimated assuming full persistence, respectively. These proportions fell to 27 and 23% with an MPR value of 80%. The costs per QALY gained, for branded bisphosphonates (and generic alendronate), were estimated at 19,069 euros (4,871 euros), 32,278 euros (11,985 euros), and 64,052 euros (30,181 euros) for MPR values of 100, 80, and 60%, respectively, assuming real-world persistence. These values were 16,997 euros (2,215 euros), 24,401 euros (6,179 eruos), and 51,750 euros (20,569 euros), respectively, assuming full persistence. In conclusion, poor compliance and failure to persist with osteoporosis medications results not only in deteriorating health outcomes, but also in a decreased cost-effectiveness of drug therapy. Adherence therefore remains an important challenge for health-care professionals treating osteoporosis.",M2

Patients' attitudes toward symptoms, results, causes, disease course, and effective treatment of depression can influence their adherence to therapy. We aimed to assess the efficacy of an educational leaflet designed to improve patients' attitudes toward depression and antidepressant treatment. Participants were one hundred twenty-two outpatients of three psychiatric clinics in Japan who met the DSM-IV criteria for depression. Patients in the intervention group received an educational leaflet at the start of the study. Participants filled in The Antidepressant <e>Compliance</e> Questionnaire (ADCQ) and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) before and after the intervention. Intervention group showed greater improvements on the total score of ADCQ, the score on the  positive beliefs regarding antidepressants  subscale. They maintained the scores on the  perceived doctor-patient relationship  subscale, where the control group lowered those scores. No significant difference in improvement in BDI scores was observed between groups. The intervention using an educational leaflet had a significant positive impact on patients' attitudes toward depression and antidepressant treatment. Our results indicate that the educational leaflet is an effective tool for enhancement of face-to-face education by medical professionals.

20192909,"Perceived treatment effectiveness, medication <e>compliance</e>, and complementary and alternative medicine use among veterans with bipolar disorder.OBJECTIVES: Recent research shows a high rate of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use among persons with mental disorders, although correlates and patterns of CAM use are relatively unknown. This study tested whether CAM use is associated with perceived effectiveness of conventional treatment (i.e., psychotropic medication and psychotherapy) and medication compliance among persons with bipolar disorder. DESIGN: Patients with bipolar disorder (n = 435) were included as part of a naturalistic cohort study. Measures of CAM utilization, medication compliance, and perceptions of the effectiveness of psychotropic medications and psychotherapy were based on previously established questionnaires. Associations were tested using bivariate and multivariate analyses. RESULTS: Bivariate analyses showed that patients who did not perceive psychotherapy as effective at improving social, family, or job functioning reported greater CAM use. However, medication compliance was not significantly associated with use of CAM. Patients who used oral (e.g., herbal therapies) or cognitive (e.g., meditation) CAM were more likely to report that their medications were not effective at relieving manic or depressive symptoms. Users of cognitive CAM were more likely to report that their medications did not help with social, job, or family functioning, and that they did not prevent recurrences of manic or depressive episodes. None of the bivariate associations remained significant in multivariate analyses. CONCLUSIONS: Prior research has suggested that persons who are dissatisfied with treatment for medical conditions are more likely to use CAM therapies. However, the results of this study do not show CAM therapies to be associated with perceived effectiveness of treatments for mental health problems among this sample of persons with serious mental illnesses. This suggests that motivations for CAM use may vary by population and condition. Because few correlates of CAM use among persons with serious mental illnesses are known, providers should conduct routine assessments of CAM use.",M2

20179981,"Efficacy and safety of piascledine 300 versus chondroitin sulfate in a 6 months treatment plus 2 months observation in patients with osteoarthritis of the knee.To investigate that a 6-month treatment with avocado soybean unsaponifiable (Piascledine 300 mg) once daily is as effective as with chondroitin sulfate 400 mg three times daily in femorotibial gonarthrosis, and also the carry-over effect for two more months is comparable. Patients were randomized (1:1) to the treatment groups. They received for 6 months 3 capsules chondroitin sulfate per day or one capsule of avocado soybean unsaponifiable (ASU) in a double-dummy technique. A 2-month post-treatment period followed to determine the carry-over effect. Primary efficacy criterion was the change of the WOMAC-index from study begin to end of treatment. Secondary criteria were the changes in Lequesne-index, pain on active movement and at rest, global assessment of efficacy. Three hundred sixty-four patients have been taken up into the trial. Three hundred sixty one patients were eligible for evaluation. One hundred eighty three received ASU 300 mg once daily, one hundred seventy eight chondroitin sulfate three times daily. The WOMAC-index decreased in both groups for approx. 50% to the end of therapy. During the post-treatment observation there was a further slight improvement. There was no statistical significant difference between the treatment groups during the entire observation. All other observed parameters showed the same pattern. The daily intake of rescue medication was reduced continuously. Overall efficacy has been rated excellent and good in more than 80% of the patients in both groups. Both drugs were safe and well tolerated. The first direct comparison between avocado soybean unsaponifiable 300 mg once daily and chondroitin sulfate three times daily reveiled no difference in efficacy or safety aspects between 1 capsule ASU 300 mg per day and 3 capsules chondroitin sulfate per day. It can be assumed that the once daily intake of ASU will lead to a better <e>compliance</e> in routine therapy.",M2
20176161,"[Which factors are associated to hemorrhagic adverse drug events related to antivitamin K?]INTRODUCTION: Hemorrhagic events constitute a major risk for patients on oral anticoagulant therapy. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a prospective survey of all patients taking oral anticoagulants and admitted to the emergency room of Grenoble University Hospital over a period of 10 months. The objective was to identify the causes of drug-induced adverse hemorrhagic events, and whether they were related to health care practices or patient behavior concerning their treatment. RESULTS: Two hundred and sixteen patients treated with oral anticoagulants were identified and 68 of them had a hemorrhagic adverse drug event. Not taking into account prior medial history before prescribing an anticoagulant was noted for 21 of the patients who experienced a hemorrhagic event (p = 0.0003). In addition, compared with patients who had not had a hemorrhagic event, inadequate prescribing with regard to doses and administration frequency there were also more common in the hemorrhagic event group (p &lt; 0.0001). Pharmacists delivering the drugs had not intervened to correct drug interactions, contraindications and inadequate doses in 72% of patients with hemorrhage (p &lt; 0.0001). Other factors associated with increased the risk of hemorrhage were self-medication, not taking the prescribed drug at a predefined time of the day, insufficient INR monitoring and poor <e>compliance</e> (p &lt; 0.0001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: To achieve the beneficial effects expected with anticoagulants, physicians must carefully comply with prescription recommendations, especially for elderly patients. Pharmacists delivering the drugs should also intervene more readily when required.",M2
20169242,"[Beliefs of diabetic patients about nutritional therapy and its influence on their <e>compliance</e> with treatment]The system of health beliefs influences the process of compliance with diabetes treatment. Compliance with nutritional therapy is one of the greatest challenges found. The purpose of this qualitative approach study was to analyze the beliefs of type 2 diabetic patients regarding nutritional therapy and its influence on the compliance with it. The participants of the study were nine patients being treated in a reference unit for diabetic patients' treatment. The procedures involved were blood exam to check the glycated hemoglobin, a questionnaire, semi-structured recorded interview and patient report checking. The analysis of the speeches was made using the thematic categories of Bardin (2000), and the models of Rokeach (1981) and Rosenstock (1974). All participants showed glycated hemoglobin levels higher than 7%, what shows that is difficult for them to control their glicemic levels and possible non compliance. After the analysis of the speeches, two thematic categories were identified: 'Recommendations received about feeding' and 'Nutritional therapy compliance'. Both categories showed authority beliefs and consensus zero, and barriers to nutritional therapy, which the participants see as a restrictive imposition. Those beliefs have negative influence on the compliance, and so, they have to be considered when providing health assistance to the population.",M2
20160262,"Influence of nurses on <e>compliance</e> with breast screening recommendations in an organized breast screening program.BACKGROUND: Evidence from breast screening trials has shown that a significant reduction in breast cancer mortality from screening can be achieved by regular attendance. Few studies have evaluated the influence of nurses on compliance with breast screening recommendations. METHODS: The cohort included 157,788 women ages 50 to 69 years who were screened at 1 of 9 regional cancer centers or 57 affiliated centers with nurses or 26 affiliated centers without nurses between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2002, within the Ontario Breast Screening Program. These women were followed up prospectively for at least 30 months to compare compliance for annual and biennial screening recommendations among women who attended centers with and without nurses. The associations between type of screening center and the odds of compliance were modeled using mixed-effect logistic regression models. All P values are two-sided. RESULTS: Women attending a regional cancer center [odds ratios (OR), 1.96; 95% confidence interval (95% CI), 1.07-3.58] or affiliated center with nurses (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.38-2.22) were significantly more likely to return within 18 months of their annual screening recommendation than women attending affiliated centers without nurses. In addition, women attending regional cancer centers (OR, 2.28; 95% CI, 1.34-3.89) or affiliated centers with nurses (OR, 2.30; 95% CI, 1.86-2.83) were significantly more likely to make a timely return within the recommended biennial screening interval of between 18 and 30 months. CONCLUSIONS: Breast screening programs should consider methods of integrating educational activities as provided by the nurses to improve compliance with screening.",M2
20159506,"Adherence to scheduled appointments among HIV-infected female youth in five U.S. cities.OBJECTIVE: Identify factors associated with appointment-keeping among HIV-infected adolescents and young adults. METHODS: HIV-infected adolescent and young adult females in five U.S. cities were followed for a period of 18 months to examine adherence to scheduled clinic visits with their HIV care provider. Psychosocial and behavioral factors that have been shown in other populations to influence appointment adherence were measured at baseline and follow-up visits using an audio computer-assisted self-interview questionnaire. These factors included mood disorder, depressive symptoms, social network support, healthcare satisfaction, disease acceptance, HIV stigma, alcohol use, and marijuana use. CD4 count and prescription of antiretroviral therapy medication were also monitored to understand the influence of health status on appointment- keeping. RESULTS: Participants included 178 youth with a mean age of 20.6 years. Forty-two percent had clinically significant depressive symptoms, 10% had a diagnosable mood disorder, 37% reported marijuana use in the last 90 days, and 47% reported alcohol use. Overall, participants attended 67.3% of their scheduled visits. Controlling for age and health status, marijuana use was the only variable that was associated with appointment-keeping behavior. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the importance of appointment-keeping for maintaining personal health and preventing further transmission, screening HIV-infected adolescents for marijuana use could help alert providers of this specific barrier to visit <e>compliance</e>.",M2
20155341,"Effect of opium use on short-term outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery.PURPOSE: Data regarding the effect of opium use on short-term outcome in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass surgery are limited. We sought to assess the morbidity and in-hospital mortality of current and past users compared the data with those from nonusers of opium after coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG). METHODS: This is a descriptive analytical review of prospectively collected data on 782 consecutive male patients who underwent isolated CABG between January 2005 and December 2007. Of these, 708 (90.5%) were nonusers, 56 (7.1%) were current users, and 18 (2.3%) were former opium users of more than 4 weeks. The effect of opium usage on clinical, admission, and outcome variables were analyzed. RESULTS: Current opium users were younger (P = 0.004) and more likely to be cigarette smokers (P = 0.0004). Other demographic characteristics, major coronary risk factors, rates of postoperative complications, intensive care unit readmission, postoperative length of stay, and in-hospital mortality did not differ among the three groups. Current opium users needed less analgesic postoperatively (P = 0.0001), were significantly less compliant with medical and dietary recommendations after discharge (P &lt; 0.0001), and were more likely to be rehospitalized with cardiovascular causes within 6 months after CABG surgery; these differences were much more pronounced for nonusers versus current users of opium (P &lt; 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Continued use of opium is a significant predictor of rehospitalization with a cardiac cause within 6 months of CABG surgery. This may be partly due to the low <e>compliance</e> of these patients with treatment recommendations.",M2
20153859,"Variability of residual platelet function despite clopidogrel treatment in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease.Residual platelet function despite treatment with clopidogrel may predict an unfavourable cardiovascular outcome. The majority of studies have investigated the effects of clopidogrel administration in conjunction with aspirin in patients undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention. The primary objective of the present study was to assess the platelet response to clopidogrel in the absence of aspirin in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease (PAOD) and to investigate whether non-responsiveness to clopidogrel is reproducible during long-term follow-up. Fifty-four clinically stable PAOD patients on a maintenance dose of 75 mg/d clopidogrel were enrolled in this study. Platelet function was assessed at baseline and after a median follow-up of 18 months using light transmittance aggregometry (LTA) with 2 microM ADP as an agonist. HPLC-coupled mass spectrometry was used to detect clopidogrel and clopidogrel carboxylic acid, the main metabolite of clopidogrel. Residual platelet function, as defined by late aggregation values within the reference range (i.e., &gt;43%), was observed in 35.2% of patients at baseline and 17.6% during follow-up. During the observation period, 26.5% had switched from responder to non-responder status or vice versa. Among non-responders, either clopidogrel or its metabolite was detected in 89.5% and 83.3% of patients at baseline and at follow-up, respectively. We conclude that non-responsiveness to clopidogrel as determined by ADP-induced LTA is not stable over time. This phenomenon cannot be attributed to non-<e>compliance</e> alone.",M2
20151203,"Diet and visually significant cataracts in galactosaemia: is regular follow up necessary?INTRODUCTION: Classic galactosaemia is caused by a recessively inherited deficiency of the enzyme galactose 1 phosphate uridyl transferase (GALT). Patients with classical galactosaemia are at increased risk of developing cataracts. We sought to retrospectively review the incidence and severity of cataracts in the cohort of galactosaemia patients attending our national treatment centre and to assess a possible effect of dietary <e>compliance</e> on cataract formation and the benefits of regular ophthalmic follow-up. METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed the clinical notes of all patients currently attending our centre with classic galactosaemia and identified all those in whom cataracts had been diagnosed by an ophthalmologist. Compliance to diet was also reviewed and compared with a matched control group. RESULTS: Of 100 active patient charts, 14 had cataracts diagnosed at some stage. Six of these persisted whereas eight regressed. Three occurred soon after birth. Age at cataract formation varied from soon after birth to 19 years of age. There was no significant difference in the cataract group between those who were compliant and those who were noncompliant with diet (p = 0.09). There was no difference in compliance between the cataract group and the control group (p = 0.16). None of the cataracts found were affecting vision. CONCLUSION: Cataracts affecting vision were not found in our cohort. A direct relationship between dietary compliance and cataract formation was not demonstrated. On the basis of our data, regular life-long ophthalmic exam of patients with classic galactosemia seems to be unnecessary. TAKE-HOME MESSAGE: Cataracts which develop in patients with classical Galactosaemia do not usually affect vision and may be unrelated to compliance to diet.",M2
20148609,"Medication adherence and enrollment in a consumer-driven health plan.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of enrolling in a consumer-driven health plan (CDHP) on adherence to maintenance drugs. STUDY DESIGN: Two-year retrospective cohort study. METHODS: Consumer-driven health plan patients were enrolled in a traditional managed care plan in 2005 (pre-year) and a full-replacement CDHP in 2006 (post-year). Traditional-plan patients voluntarily enrolled in a traditional plan in both years. Adherence measures included (1) post-year continuation rate among continuous users, (2) time to refill the first prescription in the post-year, (3) change in the <e>compliance</e> rate from the pre- to the post-year, and (4) total days with continuous drug supply in the post-year. Analysis was conducted on 8 drug classes. RESULTS: The CDHP patients had a slightly higher illness burden and used more medication in the pre-year. The continuation rate was relatively high for all drug classes, although the CDHP cohort had a lower probability of continuing cardiac and cholesterol drugs. Consumer-driven health plan patients took slightly longer on average to refill their first prescription in the post-year for cardiac, hypertension, cholesterol, and thyroid drugs. The compliance rate dropped over time in both cohorts, but the reduction was bigger among CDHP patients for 3 drug classes (adjusted ratio of the odds ratios was 0.77, 0.78, and 0.69 for asthma, cardiac, and cholesterol drugs, respectively). The CDHP patients also terminated their continuous drug supply 21 days earlier for epilepsy drugs and 27 days earlier for cholesterol drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Adherence was lower for a few drug classes among CDHP patients.",M2
20146552,"Practice strategies to improve <e>compliance</e> and patient self-management.BACKGROUND: Failure in treating opioid dependence is costly to the patient, the employer, managed care organizations, and the overall health care system. Opioid dependent patients tend to be less productive at work and in society and utilize a great many health care resources. Optimizing outcomes is essential. OBJECTIVE: To introduce the benefit of integrated strategies and patient support in the treatment of opioid dependence. SUMMARY: Health Analytics is currently studying the benefit of HereToHelp, a behavioral support program in which registered nurses or addiction treatment counselors with specialized training in addiction education provide information and encouragement to patients receiving pharmacologic treatment for opioid dependence. A total of 470 physicians in 41 states have been enlisted to participate in this patient support study. The study hypothesis is that patients who receive behavioral support and encouragement will be more compliant with their opioid replacement therapy, leading to better outcomes. Additional treatment strategies are also being developed to minimize the risk of abuse and diversion. Prodrugs and vaccines are also being investigated. CONCLUSION: A coordinated team approach is essential in treating pain patients and opioid-dependent patients. Offering behavior modification in addition to pharmacotherapy and utilizing strategies such as prescription monitoring programs, pain contracts, and screening are all vital components necessary for positive outcomes.",M2
20146547,"Strategies for improving asthma outcomes: a case-based review of successes and pitfalls.Several comprehensive community-based asthma management programs have been developed in recent years. Their central goal is to provide access to quality asthma care to achieve successful long-term disease management. The Kansas City Children's Asthma Management Program (KC CAMP) and the Asthma Network of West Michigan (ANWM) share many of the same objectives, which include educating patients, families, the community, and health care providers about asthma care, advocating on behalf of those who need care, and allocating resources to provide care. Education to promote behavioral changes in health care providers enrolled in KC CAMP was achieved through didactic sessions and was considered successful; provider and staff satisfaction increased, as did <e>compliance</e> with treatment guidelines. ANWM seeks to promote prevention rather than crisis care by providing home visits, physician care conferences to generate asthma management plans, and social workers to address psychosocial barriers to care. Funding from multiple resources is essential for maintaining the programs. In addition, staff work with corporate sponsors, governmental agencies, and individual donors to ensure the programs' success. The benefits of KC-CAMP and ANWM are evident with data showing dramatic declines in emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and overall health care costs for asthma care.",M2
20141308,"Psychometric properties of a computerized mobile phone method for assessing mood in daily life.Ecological momentary assessment is a method that is now largely used to study behavior and mood in the settings in which they naturally occur. It maximizes ecological validity and avoids the limitations of retrospective self-reports. Studies on the psychometric properties of scales administered via mobile phone ecological momentary assessment are lacking. Therefore, we collected data on a 4-item mood scale measuring well being on six occasions per day for 7 days (N = 307) and examined <e>compliance</e> rate across time, within day, and within week. Using specific latent state-trait structural equation models, we analyzed the degree to which interindividual mood differences on an occasion of measurement were because of (a) measurement error, (b) stable differences in mood level, and (c) occasion-specific differences. Results show good compliance (mean compliance: 74.9% of calls answered). Moreover, the scale showed good reliability (M = .82). Mood was mostly stable, especially the first 3 days of the week. It depended weakly albeit significantly on the previous assessment (autoregressive coefficient). In conclusion, computerized mobile phone assessment is an appropriate, easy-to-use, and promising method to measure mood.",M2
20136989,"Evidence-based dietary management of functional gastrointestinal symptoms: The FODMAP approach.BACKGROUND AND AIM: Functional gastrointestinal symptoms are common and their management is often a difficult clinical problem. The link between food intake and symptom induction is recognized. This review aims to describe the evidence base for restricting rapidly fermentable, short-chain carbohydrates (FODMAPs) in controlling such symptoms. METHODS: The nature of FODMAPs, their mode of action in symptom induction, results of clinical trials and the implementation of the diet are described. RESULTS: FODMAPs are widespread in the diet and comprise a monosaccharide (fructose), a disaccharide (lactose), oligosaccharides (fructans and galactans), and polyols. Their ingestion increases delivery of readily fermentable substrate and water to the distal small intestine and proximal colon, which are likely to induce luminal distension and induction of functional gut symptoms. The restriction of their intake globally (as opposed to individually) reduces functional gut symptoms, an effect that is durable and can be reversed by their reintroduction into the diet (as shown by a randomized placebo-controlled trial). The diet has a high <e>compliance</e> rate. However it requires expert delivery by a dietitian trained in the diet. Breath hydrogen tests are useful to identify individuals who can completely absorb a load of fructose and lactose so that dietary restriction can be less stringent. CONCLUSIONS: The low FODMAP diet provides an effective approach to the management of patients with functional gut symptoms. The evidence base is now sufficiently strong to recommend its widespread application.",M2
20134337,"Assessing the relationship between <e>compliance</e> with antidepressant therapy and employer costs among employees in the United States.OBJECTIVE: To assess effects of antidepressant treatment compliance on health care and workplace costs. METHODS: By using workplace survey data linked to two employers' health care claims, employees with depression/antidepressant claims were categorized into noncompliant/compliant groups. Annualized costs were compared between compliance groups, for the employees with antidepressant use and a subset diagnosed with depression. RESULTS: Among antidepressant users (N = 1224), medical costs were not statistically different for compliant versus noncompliant patients; drug costs were higher for compliant patients, primarily because of antidepressants' costs. Similar associations were observed among depressed patients (N = 488). Absenteeism costs were lower for compliant patients with antidepressant use ($3857 vs $4,907, P = 0.041) and among depressed patients ($3976 vs $5899, P = 0.047). Presenteeism costs were higher for depressed compliant patients ($19,170 vs $15,829, P = 0.011).

20132570,"[Hallucinations attributed to djinns]Individuals with an Islamic background who suffer from hallucinations often attribute these to djinns, invisible beings. The treatment of these hallucinations is complicated by the patients' reluctance to discuss them, and by their doubts concerning the usefulness of a biomedical treatment for a problem which they experience as metaphysical in nature. In this clinical lesson, we present case studies of three Moroccan patients who attributed their hallucinations to djinns. The first was a 30-year-old factory worker whose compulsive complaints had started when he saw a white figure in the basement who asked him 'What are you doing here?' The psychiatric diagnosis was obsessive-compulsive disorder. The patient was prescribed cognitive behavioural therapy, an SSRI and a consultation by the imam, but he refused. The second patient was a 25-year-old unemployed man, who had auditory hallucinations, delusions, behavioural problems, and alcohol and cannabis abuse. He heard voices which he attributed to maleficent djinns. He was diagnosed with schizophrenia, but his <e>compliance</e> with antipsychotics was insufficient. The imam who was consulted reassured him that his complaints were not caused by djinns. After prolonged treatment with clozapine and cutting down on cannabis use the patient recovered sufficiently to be discharged. The third patient was a 26-year-old unemployed woman who was hearing voices that her imam thought were caused by a djinn. She was examined because of serious self-mutilation and was diagnosed with a schizoaffective disorder. Treatment with an antipsychotic, lithium and valproic acid and a consultation by a second imam, who found no signs of evidence of djinns, was successful. We recommend to ask individuals with an Islamic background specifically whether djinns might be involved, especially in cases of mental problems and unexplained symptoms, and to seek the cooperation of a qualified imam or traditional healer for treatment purposes.",M2
20132537,"<e>Compliance</e> with a three-day course of artesunate-mefloquine combination and baseline anti-malarial treatment in an area of Thailand with highly multidrug resistant falciparum malaria.BACKGROUND: Artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) is presently recommended by the World Health Organization as first-line treatment for uncomplicated Plasmodium falciparum malaria in several countries, as a mean of prolonging the effectiveness of first-line malaria treatment regimens. A three-day course of artesunate-mefloquine (4 mg/kg body weight once daily for three consecutive days, plus 15 and 10 mg/kg body weight mefloquine on the first and second days) has been adopted by Malaria Control Programme of Thailand as first-line treatment for uncomplicated falciparum malaria all over the country since 2008. The gametocytocydal anti-malarial drug primaquine is administered at the dose of 30 mg (0.6 mg/kg) on the last day. The aim of the present study was to assess patient compliance of this combination regimen when applied to field condition. METHODS: A total of 240 patients (196 males and 44 females) who were attending the malaria clinics in Mae-Sot, Tak Province and presenting with symptomatic acute uncomplicated falciparum malaria, with no reappearance of Plasmodium vivax parasitaemia during follow-up were included into the study. The first dose of the treatment was given to the patients under direct supervision. All patients were given the medication for self-treatment at home and were requested to come back for follow-up on day 3 of the initial treatment. Baseline (day 0) and day 3 whole blood mefloquine and plasma primaquine concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. RESULTS: Two patients had recrudescence on days 28 and 35. The Kaplan-Meier estimate of the 42-day efficacy rate of this combination regimen was 99.2% (238/240). Based on whole blood mefloquine and plasma primaquine concentrations on day 3 of the initial treatment, compliance with mefloquine and primaquine in this three-day artesunate-mefloquine combination regimen were 96.3% (207/215), and 98.5% (197/200), respectively. Baseline mefloquine and primaquine levels were observed in 24 and 16% of the patients. CONCLUSION: The current first-line treatment and a three-day combination regimen of artesunate-mefloquine provides excellent patient compliance with good efficacy and tolerability in the treatment of highly multidrug resistance falciparum malaria. Previous treatment with mefloquine and primaquine were common in this area.",M2
20130372,"Public knowledge, attitude and behavioural changes in an Indian population during the Influenza A (H1N1) outbreak.BACKGROUND: Influenza A (H1N1) is the most recent of the pandemic diseases that has affected the world's population. The aim of this study was to assess knowledge, attitude and behavioural responses of an Indian community toward Influenza A (H1N1). METHODOLOGY: A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted in Udaipur (Rajasthan, India) among 791 individuals (57% males and 43% females) from 23 July to 27 August 2009. Outcome measures were perceived seriousness of the disease, opinion about government and health authorities, perceived efficacy of various preventive measures, avoidance behaviours, and increased hygiene maintenance in relation to Influenza A (H1N1). RESULTS: Of 791 respondents, 83.1% had heard about Influenza A (H1N1), but 47.4% felt that they did not have enough information about the pandemic. Only 34.5% felt that their health would be seriously affected if they contracted Influenza A (H1N1). Over half of the respondents (59.6%) had no idea about the duration of the pandemic. Knowledge differed significantly according to gender, age groups, and educational status as well as working status; however, females had better attitude than males. Respondents rated face masks and vaccines as the most effective preventive measures. CONCLUSION: Results showed that in spite of having acceptable knowledge and attitude, behavioural response to Influenza A (H1N1) was poor. Therefore, increased efforts should be made by the government to understand what factors are associated with adaptive behaviour changes among the general public. Emphasizing the efficacy of recommended actions and the possible duration of the outbreak may further help to improve public <e>compliance</e>.",M2
20129882,"<e>Compliance</e> with periodontal maintenance at the University of Pittsburgh: Retrospective analysis of 315 cases.Maintenance care is the most important part of periodontal treatment because maintenance - adherence to the schedule of recall dental appointments after treatment - is believed to be the key in preventing the recurrence of periodontal disease. This article is a retrospective analysis of 315 cases from the Department of Periodontics and Preventive Dentistry at the University of Pittsburgh to determine compliance with periodontal maintenance schedules over a two-year period. Following the completion of periodontal surgical treatment, patients were placed on a regimen of maintenance care that included recalls every three months, professional prophylaxis by the hygiene faculty, and repeated instructions in home self-care. Medical records and patient charts of 315 subjects were selected randomly and reviewed in terms of the patient's attending the scheduled recall visit. It was hypothesized that female subjects would show better compliance with the maintenance care regimen than male subjects, as suggested in the literature. Among the 315 subjects, 112 (54 women and 58 men) followed the recommended recall schedule; 30% ultimately returned for the three-month prophylaxis recall visit after the initial periodontal surgical appointment, and thus were considered to have complied with the suggested maintenance program. The investigators failed to reject the stated hypothesis that women would display better compliance than men (p = 0.3).",M2

Adding a molecule with a long half-life to doxycycline could be useful to take over from this drug in case of occasional missed doses. A double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized field trial was designed to compare the tolerability of a doxycycline-chloroquine combination vs. doxycycline as malaria prophylaxis among French soldiers deployed in Africa. Data from 936 volunteers were analyzed. In both groups, the proportion of volunteers who reported at least one adverse effect was about 57%. Tolerability was similar in the groups except for a higher proportion of nausea or vomiting in the doxycycline-chloroquine group. The reported compliance rate was 86.6% and was similar in the two groups. Eight Plasmodium falciparum malaria cases were diagnosed in the doxycycline group and seven in the doxycycline-chloroquine group. The efficacy of the two chemoprophylaxis regimens was similar. Our study was the first randomized field trial to assess a doxycycline-chloroquine combination as malaria prophylaxis and showed no significant decrease of overall tolerability of the combination compared with doxycycline alone. Our results showed that a doxycycline-chloroquine combination could be a safe combination for malaria chemoprophylaxis.",M2
20128921,"Determinants of <e>compliance</e> with malaria chemoprophylaxis among French soldiers during missions in inter-tropical Africa.BACKGROUND: The effectiveness of malaria chemoprophylaxis is limited by the lack of compliance whose determinants are not well known. METHODS: The compliance with malaria chemoprophylaxis has been estimated and analysed by validated questionnaires administered before and after the short-term missions (about four months) in five tropical African countries of 2,093 French soldiers from 19 military companies involved in a prospective cohort study.  Correct compliance  was defined as  no missed doses  of daily drug intake during the entire mission and was analysed using multiple mixed-effect logistic regression model. RESULTS: The averaged prevalence rate of correct compliance was 46.2%, ranging from 9.6%to 76.6% according to the companies. Incorrect compliance was significantly associated with eveningness (p = 0.028), a medical history of clinical malaria (p &lt; 0.001) and a perceived mosquito attractiveness inferior or superior to the others (p &lt; 0.007). Correct compliance was significantly associated with the systematic use of protective measures against mosquito bites (p &lt; 0.001), the type of military operations (combat vs. training activities, p &lt; 0.001) and other individual factors (p &lt; 0.05).

In 2006, an artesunate (AS)-mefloquine (MQ) treatment program was implemented in Antioquia. In addition, primaquine (PQ) was added to eliminate malaria gametocytes in the bloodstream. OBJECTIVE: The efficacy and gametocytocidal activity was evaluated for two treatment regimens, AS-MQ-PQ and AS-MQ, in patients with uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Between April 2007 and February 2008, 50 patients were recruited for the trial in Turbo, Antioquia. A randomized clinical trial was conducted. Treatment <e>compliance</e> was supervised, with a clinical and parasitological assessment on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 21, 28, 35, and 42 to evaluate response rate according to the WHO 2003 protocol. RESULTS: Clinical response and parasite elimination efficacy of AS-MQ (with or without PQ) was 100% (95% CI 86.3%-100%), and parasitemia and fever were absent on day 3 of treatment in all patients. Gametocyte elimination was superior when PQ was used--92% (95% CI: 74%-99%) of patients who received PQ had no gametocytes on day 3, compared to 78.3% (95% CI: 59%-93%) of patients who only received AS-MQ. Furthermore, circulating gametocytes were eliminated on average one week faster when the AS-MQ-PQ treatment scheme was used compared to the scheme without PQ. CONCLUSION: These studies recommend the use of AS-MQ to treat P. falciparum malaria given its good therapeutic efficacy. However, further assessment is suggested concerning the benefit of adding PQ to this treatment scheme.",M2
20126497,"Hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts (lacrisert) reduce the signs and symptoms of dry eye syndrome and improve patient quality of life.PURPOSE: A multicenter, 2-visit, open-label, 4-week study was conducted to determine the acceptability of hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts in adult patients with a history of dry eye syndrome (DES). METHODS: At visit 1, patients (N = 520) were evaluated, screened by slit-lamp biomicroscopy, and completed the Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI), a validated measure of quality of life. Patients were trained in the proper placement and use of hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts and were contacted by telephone on day 3 of the study. At week 4, patients were given a clinical evaluation and completed a second questionnaire. Answers determined changes in symptoms and quality of life. Adverse events were monitored throughout the study. RESULTS: Four hundred eighteen patients completed the study and reported significant improvements in discomfort, burning, dryness, grittiness, stinging, and light sensitivity (P = .05) after 4 weeks use of hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts. Significant improvements in clinical signs (keratitis, conjunctival staining, and tear volume) were reported. Contact lens wearers reported significant improvements similar to nonwearers, with a strong trend toward improvement in light sensitivity. Mean OSDI total scores, measuring quality of life, significantly improved by 21.3% (from 41.8 +/- 22.38 to 32.9 +/- 21.97, P &lt; or = .0215). The most commonly reported adverse event leading to discontinuation was blurred vision, observed in 8.7% of patients (n = 45). <e>Compliance</e> during the study was good; 41.5% of subjects were fully compliant. Of the 58.5% of subjects who missed doses, the majority (69.4%) missed only one to five. CONCLUSIONS: Hydroxypropyl cellulose ophthalmic inserts significantly reduced symptoms and clinical signs of moderate to severe DES. They also significantly improved DES in patients wearing contact lenses. Patients experienced a statistically significant improvement in quality of life, as measured by the OSDI, of 21.3%.",M2
20123224,"A randomized controlled trial of the effect of fixed-dose routine nocturnal oxygen supplementation on oxygen saturation in patients with acute stroke.BACKGROUND: Mild hypoxia is common in patients with stroke, and associated with worse long-term outcome. Oxygen supplementation could prevent hypoxia and improve recovery. A previous study of routine oxygen supplementation showed no benefit after acute stroke, but did not report <e>compliance</e> and the effect on oxygenation. The aim of this study was to assess the effect of routine low-flow oxygen supplementation on oxygen saturation (SpO(2)) in patients with acute stroke. METHODS: In all, 63 patients with normoxic stroke and no indications for oxygen treatment were randomized to 2 L/min oxygen supplementation via nasal cannulae overnight or to control (room air) within 72 hours of symptom onset. Additional oxygen was given at the discretion of the clinical team, if medically indicated. SpO(2) was assessed from 22:00 to 09:00 by pulse oximetry. Compliance with the trial treatment and sleep status were recorded by nursing staff. RESULTS: In all, 59 patients were confirmed to have had a stroke and available for overnight monitoring. Six (2 oxygen, 4 control) had no or insufficient oximetry data for analysis. The mean nocturnal SpO(2) was 2.5% higher in the oxygen group (n = 27) than in the control group (n = 26) (P &lt; .001). More patients on oxygen than control subjects had SpO(2) greater than 90% throughout the night (59% v 23%). Patients on oxygen had fewer desaturations than control subjects (oxygen desaturation index 4%, 0.8 v 2.1) (P = .001). Oxygen was found to be in place as prescribed in 71%. Oxygen supplementation was not associated with insomnia or restlessness. No patient in either group was given oxygen for clinical indications. CONCLUSIONS: Nocturnal oxygen supplementation at a rate of 2 L/min increases the mean nocturnal SpO(2) by 2.5% and reduces the number of nocturnal desaturations in patients with acute stroke.",M2
20122146,"Scoring and psychometric properties of the Eye-Drop Satisfaction Questionnaire (EDSQ), an instrument to assess satisfaction and <e>compliance</e> with glaucoma treatment.BACKGROUND: The objective of this study was to ascertain the scoring and assess the psychometric properties of the Eye-Drop Satisfaction Questionnaire (EDSQ), a 43-item Patient-Reported Outcome instrument developed to assess patients' satisfaction and compliance with glaucoma treatment. METHODS: The EDSQ was administered during an observational, retrospective study to 184 French patients treated for glaucoma. The hypothesized structure, including six dimensions (patient-clinician relationship; patient experience; patient-treatment interaction; apprehension; patient knowledge; travel), was tested by assessing the internal consistency reliability (Cronbach's alpha) and construct-related validity (item convergent and discriminant validity). As unsatisfactory results were demonstrated, another structure was defined using a principal component analysis (PCA) combined with content of items. Psychometric properties of this new structure were assessed. Scores were compared between low, moderate and high compliance profile groups defined using data collected with the Travalert electronic device. RESULTS: Analyses were performed with the 169 patients who completed at least half of the EDSQ items. The hypothesized structure showed a Cronbach's alpha lower than 0.70 for four dimensions out of six and an overall poor construct-related validity (range of item-scale correlations: 0.00-0.68). The new structure obtained with the PCA included six dimensions: concern about treatment (five items); concern about disease (two items); satisfaction with patient-clinician relationship (five items); positive beliefs (three items); treatment convenience (three items); and self-declared compliance (three items). A score ranging from 0 to 100 was calculated for each dimension, with higher scores indicating more of the attribute referred to in the dimension. Internal consistency reliability was good (Cronbach's alpha greater than 0.70 for five dimensions). The structure offered good construct-related validity (range of item-scale correlations: 0.36-0.82). Ceiling effects of 21% and 49%, were observed for the satisfaction with patient-clinician relationship and self-declared compliance scores. Patients in low compliance profile group reported the lowest score for the satisfaction with patient-clinician relationship, positive beliefs, treatment convenience and self-declared compliance dimensions, and the highest score for the concern about treatment dimension. CONCLUSIONS: The scoring of the EDSQ was developed and the questionnaire proved to have satisfactory psychometric properties. EDSQ scores showed a promising relationship to compliance profiles. The EDSQ could be used in future studies.",M2
20089500,"Evidence that calcium supplements reduce fracture risk is lacking.Credible evidence that calcium supplements reduce the risk of vertebral, nonvertebral, or hip fractures is lacking. Flaws in study design and execution such as inclusion of calcium-replete individuals, high dropout rates, and poor <e>compliance</e> preclude testing the hypothesis that calcium deficiency increases fracture rates or that calcium supplements reduce them. Intent-to-treat analyses of individual trials have failed to detect antifracture efficacy. Post hoc analyses of subgroups with a low calcium intake and per-protocol analyses of compliers have reported fewer fractures in the supplemented groups. However, this may be the result of confounding by violation of randomization; compliers to placebo have a lower morbidity and mortality than noncompliers. Higher hip fracture rates and cardiac mortality in patients receiving calcium supplements, as reported in some studies, may also be due to factors other than supplementation. Hypothesis testing requires that a cohort be stratified into calcium-deficient and calcium-replete groups, with each person randomized to a supplement or placebo. This design quantifies the risk of fracture attributable to calcium deficiency and any benefit that supplementation confers in the calcium-deficient and calcium-replete groups. To regard a calcium-deficient arm as unethical begs the question. Consensus statements that support the widespread use of calcium are opinion-based; they accept claims of beneficial effects despite flaws in study design, execution, and analysis; and they reject reported adverse effects because of them. Until well designed, well executed, and well analyzed studies demonstrate a net benefit in morbidity, mortality, and cost, recommendations supporting the widespread use of calcium supplementation remain belief-based and not evidence-based.",M2
20118208,"Effects of long-term continuous positive airway pressure on body composition and IGF1.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the long-term effects of nasal continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) ventilation in patients with obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS) on body composition (BC) and IGF1. DESIGN: Observational study. SUBJECTS: Seventy-eight (11 females and 67 males) OSAS patients who were compliant with CPAP (age 51+/-1.1 years) participated in the study. We assessed body mass index (BMI), total body mass (TBM), total body fat (TBF; kg) and lean body mass (LBM; kg), abdominal subcutaneous (SC) and visceral (V) fat (cm(2)), and waist circumference (WC; cm) by magnetic resonance imaging, and IGF1 (ng/ml) before and after 7.8+/-1.3 months of CPAP use of an average of 5.9+/-1.2 h. RESULTS: Women had a higher BMI, WC; TBM, TBF, and more SC fat. Men had a higher LBM and more V fat. CPAP increased WC (+2.8+/-9.6 cm, P=0.02) and LBM (2.2+/-0.5 kg, P=0.006), but not IGF1. In men, CPAP increased BMI (0.5+/-0.2 kg/m(2), P=0.02), WC (1.7+/-6.9 cm, P=0.002), TBM (1.7+/-0.4 kg, P=0.0001), LBM (1.5+/-0.4 kg, P=0.0003), SC fat (12.9+/-5.1 cm(2), P=0.02), and IGF1 (13.6+/-4.2 ng/ml, P=0.002). <e>Compliance</e> with CPAP increased LBM in men aged &lt;60 years, but not in those aged &gt;60 years, and IGF1 increased in men aged 40-60 years only. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term CPAP increased LBM in both sexes and IGF1 in men, while fat mass remained unchanged, suggesting a sexually dimorphic response of IGF1 to CPAP. The role of the GH axis activity and age to this response is unclear. The metabolic consequences of changes in LBM are still to be determined. Future studies on the effects of CPAP on BC should include LBM as an outcome.",M2
20117869,"Can patient self-management explain the health gradient? Goldman and Smith's  Can patient self-management help explain the SES health gradient?  (2002) revisited.In their much-cited paper,  Can patient self-management help explain the SES health gradient? Goldman and Smith (2002) use samples of diabetic and HIV+ patients in the United States to conclude that disease self-management is an important explanation for the much-documented positive gradient in education and health outcomes. In this paper, I revisit their analysis and point to some fundamental difficulties in interpreting their results as conclusive evidence in favor of self-management. I also argue that for individuals for whom self-management might be expected to matter -i.e. populations of patients managing complex conditions - economic factors such as resource availability and insurance access might be a more important mechanism behind the gradient than medical <e>compliance</e>. The impact of self-management, though it might matter, is likely to be small.",M2
20113549,"Employment and <e>compliance</e> with pandemic influenza mitigation recommendations.In the event of a serious pandemic influenza outbreak, businesses must play a key role in protecting employees' health and safety. With regard to pandemic influenza mitigation recommendations requiring social distancing, we examined whether some US employees would disproportionately fail to comply because of job insecurity and financial problems associated with missing work. We used the 2006 Harvard School of Public Health Pandemic Influenza Survey and multivariable logistic regression to determine whether employment characteristics such as inability to work from home, lack of pay when absent from work, and self-employment would be associated with less ability to comply with recommendations. We found that inability to work from home, lack of paid sick leave, and income are associated with working adults' ability to comply and should be major targets for workplace interventions in the event of a serious outbreak.",M2
20112854,"Quality of life as a key indicator of patient satisfaction and treatment <e>compliance</e> in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus in the IMPROVE study: a multicentre, open label, non-randomised, observational trial.Diabetes is a debilitating chronic illness having multiple impacts on physical and mental well-being of patients. When treating chronic conditions like diabetes, psychosocial aspects and quality of life (QoL) have to be considered; however, these receive less attention due to various reasons. Patients with diabetic complications have increased levels of depression and decreased QoL This necessitates evaluating QoL of patient which now is used as a primary or secondary end point in clinical trials eg, Diab-MedSat QoL questionnaire used in diabetes. At some point all diabetic patients may require insulin to control hyperglycaemia and disease progression. The traditional insulin syringe and needle delivery system has been the principal barrier in the treatment of diabetes as it was not well accepted among the patients due to various reasons. A success over this approach has been pen like devices like FlexPen and Novopen3 which are becoming more popular than the conventional syringe-and-needles as they have several advantages like, easy to carry, use, maintain and also reduces administrative errors ensuring accurate doses are delivered. The objective of IMPROVE study is to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of biphasic insulin aspart (NovoMix 30) in normal clinical practice conditions, in India. This is an open label, non-randomised, non-interventional, observational, safety and effectiveness study in approximately 17,995 patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. A cohort of Indian patients (n = 349) from all 4 geographical locations (North, West, East and South of India) were administered QoL instrument Diab-MedSat at baseline and 346 patients at final visit (n = 346) to assess their satisfaction with the treatment they received. The results were included in the final statistical analysis as additional outcome variables. The Diab-MedSat Novo Nordisk June 2004 English (UK) version is used. The Diab-MedSat has 21 items that need to be answered and it is scored as an overall score (all 21 items) as well as three subscale scores regarding burden (11 items), symptoms (5 items), efficacy (5 items). The complete analysis took into account all 21 items of Diab-MedSat questionnaire with their subscales. Analyses of the cohort showed higher patient satisfaction among the patients administered Diab-MedSat questionnaire from baseline (n = 349) to final visit (n = 346). The mean of overall score was 52.33 (baseline visit) versus 79.03 (final visit). The difference in the overall score and sub parameters like burden, symptoms and efficacy between the baseline and final visits were statistically significant (p-value &lt; 0.001). The mean value of difference in overall score between the baseline visit and final visit was 26.73 +/- 20.83; while the difference for burden, symptoms and efficacy were respectively 27.86 +/- 20.81, 19.75 +/- 20.94 and 32.87 +/- 28.08. A fairly clear picture emerged that the use of biphasic insulin aspart resulted in improved QoL of the patients substantially. This is demonstrated in the results for all the parameters that were used like symptoms, efficacy and burden. The overall number of extremely satisfied patients had increased from 5.4% in the baseline visit to 91% in the final visit. This unambiguously proves that the satisfaction of patients on biphasic insulin aspart (NovoMix 30) is beyond question.",M2

This study was initiated to cover this lacuna. Eighty young patients suffering from asthma with rhinitis or urticaria between the age group of 10 and 40 years were included in this study. Compliance to medications was carefully observed using dose diaries for a period of one year. The data obtained revealed the highest compliance for sublingual immunotherapy (84.19%) and the lowest for a nasal spray (62.32%).

The aim of this study was to investigate the presence and type of psychopathology in a group of obese children and to determine the effect of comorbid psychiatric disorders on treatment compliance. Fifty-four obese patients were evaluated by clinical interviews as well as Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children, Present and Lifetime Version (KIDI-SADS-PL) for psychiatric diagnosis. Fifty percent of the sample was found to have psychopathology and treatment compliance was found to be poor in the group with comorbid psychiatric disorders.

20110817,"Breast and cervical cancer screening in Spain and predictors of adherence.Gynecological cancers are an important cause of morbidity and mortality. Secondary prevention programmes attempt to improve their prognosis. High participation rates are needed to ensure the desired population impact. We sought to assess the use of mammography and Pap smear and analyze predictors of screening adherence. We included women surveyed in the Spanish National Health Survey 2006. Cancer screening included mammography in the last 2 years and Pap smear in the last 3 years. The target age range of the screening programmes was 50-69 years in breast cancer screening and 25-64 years in cervical cancer screening. Independent variables included: sociodemographics, chronic diseases and lifestyles. Predictors of mammography or Pap smear adherence were explored using logistic regression. The screening coverage for the target age range was 84.1% (95% confidence interval=82.9-85.2) in breast cancer and 67.4% (95% confidence interval=66.5-68.4) in cervical cancer. Mammography uptake was positively associated with age, being married, higher educational level, having visited a physician or gynecologist, supplementary private health coverage and osteomuscular disease. Some unhealthy lifestyles were associated with nonadherence to mammography. Positive predictors of Pap smear adherence behaved in the same way as for mammography and also higher monthly incomes and eating a healthy diet were associated with higher screening <e>compliance</e>. In conclusion, adherence to breast cancer screening in Spain is acceptable in the target age group; nevertheless Pap smear screening must be improved. In both cases, an effort must be made to recruit those women who are less likely to undergo screening, as they are those who are at higher risk of suffering these diseases.",M2

RESEARCH DESIGN: Prospective cohort study in 100 nationally-representative US high schools. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: Certified athletic trainers submitted injury reports for concussed athletes in five boys' (football, soccer, basketball, wrestling, baseball) and four girls' (soccer, basketball, volleyball, softball) sports via High School RIO (Reporting Information Online). Concussions were retrospectively graded and it was determined whether athletes followed American Academy of Neurology (AAN) or Prague return-to-play guidelines. MAIN OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: There were 1308 concussions reported during 5 627 921 athlete-exposures (23.2 concussions per 100 000 athlete-exposures), reflecting an estimated 395 274 concussions sustained nationally. At least 40.5% and 15.0% of concussed athletes returned to play prematurely under AAN and Prague return-to-play guidelines, respectively. In football, 15.8% of athletes sustaining a concussion that resulted in loss-of-consciousness returned to play in &lt;1 day. Males (12.6%) were more likely than females (5.9%) to return 1-2 days after sustaining an initial grade II concussion. CONCLUSIONS: Too many adolescent athletes are failing to comply with recommended return-to-play guidelines.

20092387,"Add-back therapy use and its impact on LA persistence in patients with endometriosis.OBJECTIVES: Persistence and <e>compliance</e> in women with endometriosis who are receiving gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists (GnRH-a) may be limited by its hypoestrogenic side effects. Use of concomitant therapy with norethindrone acetate (NA), estrogen, estrogen/progestin combinations, or other progestin (i.e., 'add-back therapy' [ABT]) is recommended to alleviate these side effects. This retrospective study evaluated ABT utilization and its effect on compliance and persistence in patients with endometriosis taking the GnRH-a leuprolide acetate (LA) depot suspension. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of a large pharmacy claims database identified patients who started LA therapy from 2002 to 2004 for the treatment of endometriosis. Patients were identified as having received ABT if they started 7 days before, or within 45 days of the last LA fill. RESULTS: A total of 1285 women with endometriosis who began using LA were identified with 12 months of evaluable data: 211 (16.4%) used concomitant NA therapy, 116 (9.0%) used concomitant estrogen-based therapy, 28 (2.2%) used concomitant combination estrogen- and progestin-based therapies, 56 (4.4%) used concomitant progestin-based therapy, and 874 (68.0%) did not use any ABT. Mean (+/-SD) LA persistence in women receiving NA-based ABT was 5.83 +/- 2.98 months, compared with 4.25 +/- 2.62 months for those not using ABT (P &lt; 0.0001). Average medication possession ratio was 0.43 +/- 0.20 for women receiving NA-based ABT versus 0.32 +/- 0.18 for those not receiving any ABT (P &lt; 0.0001). Patients &lt; 30 years of age were most likely to continue therapy longer and have greater compliance compared with the older age group cohorts (P &lt; 0.01). Patients who used ABT continued to do so for 3.79 +/- 3.21 months. LIMITATIONS: Limitations of this study include those associated with the use of retrospective claims databases: It does not include any information regarding the patient's pain symptoms, disease severity, or other factors, which could correlate to compliance and persistence. CONCLUSIONS: Among women using LA therapy for endometriosis, only 32% used any type of ABT, and these patients had significantly higher persistence and compliance with LA therapy compared to no ABT user group.",M2
20088431,"[The influence of an event in the Israeli media on the <e>compliance</e> of patients with influenza vaccinations in the winter of 2006-2007]BACKGROUND: The influenza virus is a well-known cause of pandemics, such as the swine flu (A/H1N1) pandemic and of seasonal epidemics worldwide. Most of the morbidity and mortality due to the virus is caused by the seasonal flu epidemics for which the flu vaccine has been proven to be an efficient preventive measure. On the 22nd of October 2006 the Israeli media widely reported the deaths of three patients who had received the flu vaccine at the same clinic in Kiryat Gat. A nationwide panic arose following these publications and many people were afraid to receive the flu vaccine. OBJECTIVES: To examine the influence of the panic reflected in the media on the rate of vaccination for influenza and on the attitudes of the patients towards the vaccine at the Hadassah Mount Scopus Medical Center. METHODS: Between January and April 2007, 162 people at the Hadassah Mount Scopus Medical Center completed a questionnaire about the flu vaccine and their reasons for avoiding it. The clinical status of the participants was also assessed. RESULTS: The rate of vaccination during the flu season of 2006-7 was only 31% compared with a recommended rate of 96% according to the Israeli Health Ministry's guidelines. This represents a 37% decline in the rate of vaccination compared with the previous flu season (p=0.0015). More than half of the people surveyed (54%) reported that their decision to avoid the flu vaccine was related to the public scare reported by the media. The patients who received the flu vaccine in 2005-6 but discontinued receiving it in 2006-7 were on average younger that those who continued receiving it. There were no significant differences between the sexes or ethnic backgrounds of the vaccine avoiders. A total of 73 patients were reported sick with influenza-related diseases. These patients, who had not received the flu vaccine, were significantly younger (60 years p&lt;0.001) and less chronically ill (57% had recurrent hospitalizations p=0.017). Amongst the patients who discontinued the flu vaccine in 2006-7 the rate of influenza-related diseases was 63%. This rate was 1.4 times higher than the average rate observed amongst the entire survey population--45% (p=0.058). CONCLUSIONS: The results of this survey show that the panic in the Israeli media resulted in a very significant reduction in the rate of vaccination with the flu vaccine at the Hadassah Mount Scopus Medical Center during the flu season of 2006-7. This reduction in the rate of vaccination resulted in greater morbidity. We can conclude that many people in Israel became sick and even died due to the flu vaccine scare which was never proved to be justified. There is a need to consider how to avoid a similar media-evoked panic reaction in the future which causes damage to the public's health.",M2
20087215,"Prevalence, awareness, treatment, and control of hypertension in rural China: results from Shandong Province.OBJECTIVES: Hypertension is an important public health problem in rural China with a rapidly increasing prevalence noted in recent years. This study estimates the prevalence, awareness, treatment and control of hypertension in a rural population in Shandong Province, China. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted in rural Shandong Province, China, in April 2007 using multistage cluster sampling. A total of 16 364 rural residents aged 25 years and more were interviewed and examined. Two blood pressure (BP) measurements were obtained using a standardized mercury sphygmomanometer after a 5-min seated rest. Information on history of hypertension was obtained using a standard questionnaire. Hypertension was defined as mean systolic BP (SBP) at least 140 mmHg and/or diastolic BP (DBP) at least 90 mmHg, and/or self-reported current use of antihypertensive medication. RESULTS: Overall, 43.8% of the population had hypertension. Among hypertensive patients, only 26.2% were aware of their hypertension, 22.2% were currently undergoing antihypertensive treatment, and 3.9% achieved BP control (&lt;140/90 mmHg). Lack of knowledge about hypertension and the importance of BP control were associated with poor <e>compliance</e> with nonpharmacological and pharmacological treatments. CONCLUSIONS: In the study population, the prevalence of hypertension is high, but levels of awareness, treatment and control are unacceptably low.

20086260,"Patient use and <e>compliance</e> with medical advice delivered by a web-based triage system in primary care.We studied a web-based triage system which was accessible to the general public in the Netherlands. In a retrospective analysis we investigated the type of complaints that were submitted and the kind of advice provided. Over a period of 15 months, 13,133 different people began using the web-based triage system and 3812 patients went right through the triage process to the end. The most frequent complaints were common cold symptoms, such as cough and a sore throat (22%), itch problems (13%), urinary complaints (12%), diarrhoea (10%), headache (8%) and lower back pain (8%). Most commonly, the system generated the advice to contact a doctor (85%) and in 15% of the cases the system provided fully automated, problem-tailored, self-care advice. A total of 192 patients participated in a prospective study and completed an online survey immediately after the delivery of advice. A follow-up questionnaire on actual compliance was completed by 35 patients. Among these, 20 (57%) had actually complied with the advice provided by the system. A regression analysis revealed that intention to comply was strongly related to actual compliance. In turn, intention to comply was strongly related to attitude towards the advice (P &lt; 0.001). Web-based triage can contribute to a more efficient primary care system, because it facilitates the gatekeeper function.",M2

Some physicians believe that split-dose preparations would be unpopular with patients scheduled for early morning colonoscopies. AIMS: To determine the willingness of potential patients to undergo split-dose bowel preparation for colonoscopy and the actual adherence of colonoscopy patients to split-dose instructions. METHODS: We performed a survey of esophagogastroduodenoscopy patients and drivers of colonoscopy patients asking whether they would accept split-dose preparations for early morning colonoscopy appointments. We also asked colonoscopy patients scheduled in the early morning if they had complied with the written preparation instructions. RESULTS: Of the 300 individuals surveyed, the majority (85%) stated they would be willing to get up during the night to take the second dose of preparation. Of 107 colonoscopy patients with early morning appointments, 78% actually got up during the night to take the second dose of preparation. CONCLUSIONS: Acceptance of and compliance with split-dose bowel preparations is high and should not be a deterrent to prescribing split-dose preparations for colonoscopy.",M2

All-cause mortality was 28%. One or more cardiac events occurred in 83% of the patients: recurrent MI in 31%; unstable angina pectoris in 52%; heart failure in 23%. Coronary artery bypass surgery was performed in 35% and coronary angioplasty in 38% of the patients. Recurrence of angina/MI was observed in 55% of patients treated with bypass surgery and in 75% of those treated with angioplasty. Stroke occurred in 14% of the cohort. At the fifth interview, anginal symptoms were reported by one third of survivors and left ventricular dysfunction was found in almost half of the patients. Self-reported <e>compliance</e> with diet and exercise was 36% and 44%, respectively. Adequate control of blood cholesterol was 25%, of hypertension - 57%; and of diabetes - 51%. Smoking rate among smokers at the index MI was 42%. Participation in cardiac rehabiLitation at any time since the index infarction was less than 20%. Resumption of work and sexual activity among previously active participants was 83% and 87%, respectively. At the fifth interview, 44% of survivors were employed and 65% were sexually active. Health-related quality of life was inferior in female participants compared with male participants and a normative sample of women. Outcomes of all categories were predicted by sociodemographic, clinical, and psychosocial variables. CONCLUSIONS: In a long-term follow-up of post-MI patients, cardiac events occurred in most participants, risk factors were not adequately controlled and participation in cardiac rehabilitation was poor. Psychosocial and socioeconomic measures had an impact on all outcomes. RECOMMENDATIONS: (A) Further development of cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention services in Israel is essential; (B) psychosocial evaluation of cardiac patients should be incorporated into their routine assessment and the findings should be applied to preventive and rehabilitative care; (C) preventive services for low socioeconomic individuals should receive a high priority.",M2
20067607,"Effectiveness of diclofenac versus acetaminophen in primary care patients with knee osteoarthritis: [NTR1485], DIPA-trial: design of a randomized clinical trial.BACKGROUND: Osteoarthritis is the most frequent chronic joint disease which causes pain and disability of especially hip and knee. According to international guidelines and the Dutch general practitioners guidelines for non-traumatic knee symptoms, acetaminophen should be the pain medication of first choice for osteoarthritis. However, of all prescribed pain medication in general practice, 90% consists of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs compared to 10% of acetaminophen. Because general practitioners may lack evidence showing a similar efficacy of acetaminophen and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, we present the design of a randomized open-label trial to investigate the efficacy of a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (diclofenac) compared with acetaminophen in new consulters with knee osteoarthritis in general practice. METHODS/DESIGN: Patients aged 45 years or older consulting their general practitioner with non-traumatic knee pain, meeting the clinical American College of Rheumatology criteria, and with a pain severity score of 2 or higher (on a 0-10 scale), will be randomly allocated to either diclofenac (maximum daily dose of 150 mg) or acetaminophen (maximum daily dose of 3000 mg) for 2 weeks and, if required, an additional 1-2 weeks, with a total follow-up period of 12 weeks. The primary outcomes are knee pain measured with a daily diary, and pain and function measured with the Knee Injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score (KOOS) at baseline, and at 3, 6, 9, and 12-weeks follow-up. Secondary outcomes are patients' perceived recovery, quality of life, medical, patient, and productivity costs, <e>compliance</e> to therapy, co-interventions, and adverse reactions. DISCUSSION: The successful completion of this trial would lead to a better understanding of which medication should be used in the treatment of primary care patients with mild knee osteoarthritis.

20060665,"Does daily vitamin D 800 IU and calcium 1000 mg supplementation decrease the risk of falling in ambulatory women aged 65-71 years? A 3-year randomized population-based trial (OSTPRE-FPS).OBJECTIVE: The hypothesis was that the calcium and vitamin D supplementation prevents falls at the population level.Study design: The OSTPRE-FPS was a randomized population-based open-trial with 3-year follow-up. The supplementation group (n=1566) received daily cholecalciferol 800IU+calcium carbonate 1000mg, while the control group (n=1573) received no supplementation or placebo. A randomly selected subsample of 593 subjects underwent a detailed measurement program including serum 25(OH)D measurements. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: The occurrence of falls was the primary outcome of the study. The participants in the subsample were telephoned at 4 months intervals and the rest of the trial population was interviewed by phone once a year. RESULTS: In the entire trial population (ETP), there were 812 women with 1832 falls in the intervention group and 833 women with 1944 falls in the control group (risk ratio was 0.98, 95% CI 0.92-1.05, P=0.160). The supplementation was not associated with single or multiple falls in the ETP. However, in the subsample, multiple fall incidence decreased by 30% (odds ratio (OR) 0.70, 95% CI 0.50-0.97, P=0.034) in the supplementation group. Further, the supplementation decreased the incidence of multiple falls requiring medical attention (OR 0.72, 95% CI 0.53-0.97, P=0.031) in the ETP. The mean <e>compliance</e> in the entire trial population was 78% and in the subsample 79%. DISCUSSION: Overall, the primary analysis showed no association between calcium and vitamin D supplementation and risk of falls. However, the results of a post hoc analysis suggested that there was a decreased risk of multiple falls requiring medical attention: this finding requires confirmation.",M2
20055571,"The functional impact of a traumatic hand injury on people who live in rural and remote locations.PURPOSE: This study aimed to gain an understanding of the functional impact of a traumatic hand injury on a rural and remote Australian population. METHOD: A retrospective, exploratory design was used. Patients who had experienced a traumatic hand injury were samples and were treated at the occupational therapy department at a major regional Australian hospital between January 2003 and February 2007 (n = 198). A mail-out survey was utilized, with 65 respondents included in the study. Questions focused on the impact on specific areas of occupational performance and on <e>compliance</e> to home exercises. The upper extremity functional index was also incorporated in the survey. RESULTS: The results revealed that almost 90% of survey respondents had residual difficulties as a result of the traumatic hand injury. The overall impact these difficulties have on 'day-to-day' life was moderate to extreme for over half of the respondents. In the areas of occupational performance, the most affected were work and leisure with less impact reported in self-care and rest. Comments were at times contrary with closed question data, with many respondents expressing relative satisfaction with their outcome despite highlighting the functional difficulties. CONCLUSION: A significant impact on occupational performance has been highlighted, which reflects common issues within this rural and remote population. Confirmation of the extent of these identified issues within the larger rural and remote Australian population will contribute to the formulation of policy and consequent improvements in health for this traditionally underserved population.",M2
20054213,"Influence of changes in body composition and adaptive thermogenesis on the difference between measured and predicted weight loss in obese women.BACKGROUND: There is a difference between measured and predicted weight loss in obese patients. This might be explained by the composition of weight loss, adaptive thermogenesis, or poor <e>compliance</e>. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 48 overweight and obese female patients (31.5 +/- 6.1 years; BMI 35.4 +/- 4.4 kg/m(2)) were investigated before and 13.9 +/- 2.4 weeks after dietary treatment (1,000 kcal/day). Body composition was measured by air-displacement plethysmography and resting energy expenditure (REE) by indirect calorimetry. Physical activity was assessed using electronic pedometers in order to calculate total energy expenditure from REE and physical activity level (PAL). Fat mass (FM) and fat-free mass (FFM) were converted into caloric equivalents using 9.45 kcal/g FM and 1.13 kcal/g FFM. Predicted weight loss was calculated by Wishnofsky's '7,700 kcal/kg rule'. RESULTS: Weight (-8.4 +/- 3.9 kg; p &lt; 0.001), FM (-7.8 +/- 3.6 kg; p &lt; 0.001), and FFM (-0.6 +/- 2.0 kg; p &lt; 0.05) decreased with caloric restriction. Measured weight loss was only 44% of the predicted value. Since FM contributed to 87% of weight loss, the energy deficit/kg weight loss was considerably higher (9,098 +/- 2,349 kcal/kg) than the assumed 7,700 kcal/kg. Adaptive thermogenesis after weight loss was significant in 26 of 48 women (-3.2 +/- 1.2 kcal per kg FFM; p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSION: 14% of the difference between measured and predicted weight loss was explained by the higher proportion of FM in weight loss and 38% by adaptive thermogenesis (in 54% of the women). Thus, poor compliance was responsible for about 50% of the difference between measured and predicted weight loss only.",M2

20064220,"How do patients with inflammatory bowel disease want their biological therapy administered?BACKGROUND: Infliximab is usually administered by two monthly intravenous (iv) infusions, therefore requiring visits to hospital. Adalimumab is administered by self subcutaneous (sc) injections every other week. Both of these anti-TNF drugs appear to be equally efficacious in the treatment of Crohn's Disease and therefore the decision regarding which drug to choose will depend to some extent on patient choice, which may be based on the mode of administration.The aims of this study were to compare preferences in Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) patients for two currently available anti-TNF agents and the reasons for their choices. METHODS: An anonymous questionnaire was distributed to IBD patients who had attended the Gastroenterology service (Ulster Hospital, Dundonald, Belfast, N. Ireland. UK) between January 2007 and December 2007. The patients were asked in a hypothetical situation if the following administering methods of anti-TNF drugs (intravenous or subcutaneous) were available, which drug route of administration would they choose. RESULTS: One hundred and twenty-five patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were issued questionnaires, of these 78 questionnaires were returned (62 percent response). The mean age of respondent was 44 years. Of the total number of respondents, 33 patients (42 percent) preferred infliximab and 19 patients (24 percent) preferred adalimumab (p = 0.07). Twenty-six patients (33 percent) did not indicate a preference for either biological therapy and were not included in the final analysis. The commonest reason cited for those who chose infliximab (iv) was:  I do not like the idea of self-injecting,  (67 percent). For those patients who preferred adalimumab (sc) the commonest reason cited was:  I prefer the convenience of injecting at home,  (79 percent). Of those patients who had previously been treated with an anti-TNF therapy (n = 10, all infliximab) six patients stated that they would prefer infliximab if given the choice in the future (p = 0.75). CONCLUSIONS: There was a trend towards patient preference for infliximab (iv) treatment as opposed to adalimumab (sc) in patients with IBD. This difference may be due to the frequency of administration, mode of administration or differing 'times in the market-place', as infliximab had been approved for a longer period of time in Crohn's disease. Further studies are required in IBD patients to investigate whether patient choice will affect <e>compliance</e>, patient satisfaction and efficacy of treatment with anti-TNF therapies.",M2
20064067,"Telemedicine for recently discharged older patients.Congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, diabetes, and hypertension are common causes of hospitalization in the elderly. Short-term postdischarge clinical outcomes regarding <e>compliance</e>, symptom control, readmission, functional status, and mortality rates are in need of improvement. This observational study documents the results of a home-based case-managed telemedicine (CMTM) program delivered over a 2-month period postdischarge. A population of 851, predominantly elderly (over age 60), recently discharged patients were enrolled in the program. They received a nurse visit up to 3 times/week and home telemedicine monitoring (weight, blood pressure, pulse rate, blood glucose, and oximeter recordings) on a daily basis. Patient education was provided by the nurse and reinforced through telemedicine. Compliance rates, quality of life parameters, patient satisfaction with telemedicine, and data regarding nine quality of care measures (QCM), hospital readmission, and mortality rates were documented. Patient demographics and outcomes of care were analyzed. There were 68% females and 56% African Americans. The readmission rate was 13% and mortality 2%. Treatment goals were met in 67%, patient compliance rate was 77%, and the average improvement in the nine QCM indicators was 66%. A majority of patients showed improved quality of health perception, better disease understanding, and high satisfaction rates with telemedicine. This is one of the larger observational studies in a predominantly elderly patient population enrolled in a CMTM program, to date. This model of care was well accepted by the elderly and produced excellent short-term clinical outcomes.",M2
