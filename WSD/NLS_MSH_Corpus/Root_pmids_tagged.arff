20576883,"Plants integrate information about nutrients and neighbors.Animals regularly integrate information about the location of resources and the presence of competitors, altering their foraging behavior accordingly. We studied the annual plant Abutilon theophrasti to determine whether a plant can demonstrate a similarly complex response to two conditions: presence of a competitor and heterogeneous resource distributions. Individually grown plants fully explored the pot by using a broad and uniform rooting distribution regardless of soil resource distributions. Plants with competitors and uniform soil nutrient distributions exhibited pronounced reductions in rooting breadth and spatial soil segregation among the competing individuals. In contrast, plants with competitors and heterogeneous soil nutrient distributions reduced their <e>root</e> growth only modestly, indicating that plants integrate information about both neighbor and resource distributions in determining their root behavior.",M1
20533628,"In vitro assessment of chemical activation efficiency during in-office dental bleaching.PURPOSE: This study compared five types of chemical catalyzing agents added to 35% hydrogen peroxide gel, with regard to their capacity of intensifying in-office dental bleaching results. METHODS: One-hundred and twenty bovine incisors were used, of which the crowns and <e>roots</e> were cut in the incisor-apical direction, to acquire the dimensions of a human central incisor. The specimens were sectioned in the mesiodistal direction by means of two longitudinal cuts, the lingual halves being discarded. The vestibular halves received prophylaxis with a bicarbonate jet, ultrasound cleaning and acid etching on the dentinal portion. Next, the specimens were stored in receptacles containing a 25% instant coffee solution for two weeks. After the darkening period, initial measurement of the shade obtained was taken with the Easy Shade appliance, which allowed it to be quantified by the CIELab method. The samples were divided into six groups, corresponding to the chemical activator used: a) none (CON); b) ferric chloride (CF); c) ferrous sulphate (SF); d) manganese gluconate (GM); e) manganese chloride (CM); f) mulberry root extract (RA). Each group received three 10-minute applications of the gels containing the respective activating agents. Next, a new shade measurement was made. RESULTS: The Analysis of Variance and Tukey tests (alpha = 5%) showed statistically significant differences for the shade perception values (p = 0.002). Groups GM, CM and RA showed significantly higher means than the control group. CONCLUSION: The presence of some chemical activators is capable of resulting in a significant increase in tooth shade variation.",M1
20524585,"Mycorrhizal symbionts of Pisonia grandis and P. sechellarum in Seychelles: identification of mycorrhizal fungi and description of new Tomentella species.Nyctaginaceae includes species that are predominantly non-mycorrhizal or form arbuscular or ectomycorrhiza. <e>Root</e>-associated fungi were studied from P. grandis and P. sechellarum roots collected respectively on the islands of Cousin and Silhouette in Seychelles. In addition fungal sporocarps were collected from the sampling area. Fungal symbionts were identified from the roots by anatomotyping and rDNA sequencing; sporocarps collected were examined microscopically and sequenced. Three distantly related ectomycorrhizal fungal species belonging to Thelephoraceae were identified from the roots of P. grandis. Sporocarps also were found for two symbionts and described as new Tomentella species. In addition Tomentella species collected from other Seychelles islands were studied and described as new species if there was no close resemblance to previously established species. P. sechellarum was determined to be an arbuscular mycorrhizal plant; three arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal species were detected from the roots. P. grandis is probably associated only with species of Thelephoraceae throughout its area. Only five Tomentella species are known to form ectomycorrhiza with P. grandis and they never have been found to be associated with another host, suggesting adaptation of these fungi to extreme environmental conditions in host's habitat.",M1
20506689,"Protective effect of Withania somnifera <e>root</e> powder on lipid peroxidation and antioxidant status in gentamicin-induced nephrotoxic rats.We investigated the protective effect of Withania somnifera root powder (used in ayurvedic medicine in India) on gentamicin (GEN) induced nephrotoxicity in male Wistar rats. The root powder was administered orally to rats for 14 days before GEN treatment and thereafter with GEN for 8 days. Nephrotoxicity was manifested in GEN-treated rats as significant increases in urea, creatinine, uric acid, non protein nitrogen, urinary protein, N-acetyl-beta-D-glucosaminidase, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, hydroperoxides, followed by a significant reduction in glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase, catalase, and reduced glutathione in liver and kidney tissues, histopathologically confirmed by tubular necrosis. W. somnifera treatment altered the antioxidant status and significantly reversed the levels as seen microscopically. The results show that the root powder of W. somnifera with the presence of natural antioxidants, bioflavanoids, and other bioactive compounds scavenged the free radicals generated by GEN and ameliorated the severity of GEN-induced nephrotoxicity by enhancing the antioxidant system and protecting the cellular integrity of kidney and liver tissues.",M1
20499639,"[Identification, colonization and disease prevention capacity of an antagonistic bacterium against Ralstonia Solanacearum]OBJECTIVE: To isolate a bacterial strain YPP-9, dominantly colonizing the rhizosphere of tomato using <e>root</e> exudate medium. In this study, we investigated the antagnism and disease-controling effect against Ralstonia solanacearum, evaluated the ability to colonize the rhizosphere of tomato, and further analyzed the phylogeny of YPP-9. METHODS: To evaluate the antagnism against R. solanacearum and the biocontrol on tomato bacterial wilt by YPP-9 respectively employing plate culture method and pot experiment in green house. We analyzed the rhizosphere colonization of YPP-9 by PCR-denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis, and also identified the taxonomic position of YPP-9 using morphological and chemotaxonomic characteristics together with 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analysis. RESULTS: YPP-9 suppressed the growth of R. solanacearum (strains SSF-4) in vitro with the inhibition zone of 5 mm. The disease-control efficiency against tomato bacterial wilt in pot was 63.4%. YPP-9 also colonized the rhizosphere of tomato well. The colonies were cream in colour after 24 h culture. Cells were gram-positive, rods (1.8 -4.1 microm x 0.9 - 1.1 microm) and formed endospores. Endospores were mainly ellipsoidal to cylindrical and lied in subterminal, and occasionally paracentral, positions in no swollen sporangia. No crystal protein. The pH range for YPP-9 growth was 5.5 - 8.5 with the optimum at pH 6.0, and the temperature for YPP-9 growth was 20 to 45 degrees with the optimum at 30 degrees. The results of BIOLOG GP2 showed that YPP-9 was Bacillus. Phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene sequence revealed that YPP-9 was the most closely related to Bacillus fumarioli, with the sequence similarity of 97.7%. The sequence number was FJ231500. The DNA G + C content was 41.9%. The major menaquinone was MK-7. The dominant fatty acids in cell wall were C14 : 0 iso, C15 : 0 iso, C16 : 0 iso and C16 : 1omega 7c alcohol, with the contents of 28.27%, 19.59%, 12.93% and 10.88%, respectively. CONCLUSION: Bacterium YPP-9 strongly inhibited R. Solanacearum in vitro and efficiently suppressed the disease development in pot experiment. YPP-9 also colonized the tomato rhizosphere well. Taxonomically, YPP-9 is affiliated to Bacillus, and probably a novel species.",M1
20498067,"Arabidopsis PIS1 encodes the ABCG37 transporter of auxinic compounds including the auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid.Differential distribution of the plant hormone auxin within tissues mediates a variety of developmental processes. Cellular auxin levels are determined by metabolic processes including synthesis, degradation, and (de)conjugation, as well as by auxin transport across the plasma membrane. Whereas transport of free auxins such as naturally occurring indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) is well characterized, little is known about the transport of auxin precursors and metabolites. Here, we identify a mutation in the ABCG37 gene of Arabidopsis that causes the polar auxin transport inhibitor sensitive1 (pis1) phenotype manifested by hypersensitivity to auxinic compounds. ABCG37 encodes the pleiotropic drug resistance transporter that transports a range of synthetic auxinic compounds as well as the endogenous auxin precursor indole-3-butyric acid (IBA), but not free IAA. ABCG37 and its homolog ABCG36 act redundantly at outermost <e>root</e> plasma membranes and, unlike established IAA transporters from the PIN and ABCB families, transport IBA out of the cells. Our findings explore possible novel modes of regulating auxin homeostasis and plant development by means of directional transport of the auxin precursor IBA and presumably also other auxin metabolites.",M1
20469644,"Progesterone and beta-estradiol stimulate seed germination in chickpea by causing important changes in biochemical parameters.Effects of progesterone and beta-estradiol on morphologic (germination velocity, <e>root</e> and shoot length) and biochemical (activities of alpha-amylase, superoxide dismutase, peroxidase and catalase, H2O2 content, lipid peroxidation) parameters during germination and post-germination stages of chickpea seeds were studied. The seeds germinated at various hormone concentrations (10(-4), 10(-9), 10(-9), 10(-12), 10(-15) M) were harvested at the end of the 1st, 3rd, and 5th day. With comparison to the control, these hormones caused an increment in the number of germinating seeds at the end of days 1 and 3 by accelerating the seed germination. Root and shoot lengths were augmented by both hormones at all hormone concentrations tested. The highest elongation was recorded in 10(-6) M progesterone and 10(-9)-10(-12) M beta-estradiol. Similarly, activities of a-amylase and superoxide dismutase were increased by all concentrations of both hormones, and maximum increases were obtained with 10(-6) M progesterone and 10(-1)-10(-12) M beta-estradiol. In the case of superoxide dismutase activity, not only the H2O2 content but also the peroxidase and catalase activities increased. Lipid peroxidation decreased depending on an increase in the antioxidant enzyme activities. In the present study, it was demonstrated that progesterone and beta-estradiol even at low concentrations increase the germination velocity and resistance to stress conditions by changing the activities of some biochemical pathways.",M1
20469634,"n-Alkylresorcinol occurrence in Mercurialis perennis L. (Euphorbiaceae).Investigation of the dichloromethane extracts from herbal and <e>root</e> parts of Mercurialis perennis L. afforded a mixture of 11 homologous n-alkylresorcinols (ARs) with saturated odd-numbered alkyl side chains (C15:0-C27:0). In addition to three predominant ARs (C19:0, C21:0 and C23:0), a number of minor ARs were identified by use of LC-MS/MS and GC-MS techniques. Among the compounds detected, four uncommon ARs with even-numbered alkyl side chain lengths were also determined. The overall AR concentration in herbal parts was 7 to 9 times higher compared to that of the roots. The results presented may open a new view on the phytochemistry and pharmacognosy of M. perennis and other members of the Euphorbiaceae family.",M1
20459320,"Host selection of symbiotic cyanobacteria in 31 species of the Australian cycad genus: Macrozamia (Zamiaceae).The nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterium Nostoc is a commonly occurring terrestrial and aquatic cyanobacterium often found in symbiosis with a wide range of plant, algal, and fungal species. We investigated the diversity of cyanobacterial species occurring within the coralloid <e>roots</e> of different Macrozamia cycad species at diverse locations throughout Australia. In all, 74 coralloid root samples were processed and 56 endosymbiotic cyanobacteria were cultured. DNA was isolated from unialgal cultures and a segment of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified and sequenced. Microscopic analysis was performed on representative isolates. Twenty-two cyanobacterial species were identified, comprising mostly Nostoc spp. and a Calothrix sp. No correlation was observed between a cycad species and its resident cyanobiont species. The predominant cyanobacterium isolated from 18 root samples occurred over a diverse range of environmental conditions and within 14 different Macrozamia spp. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that endosymbionts were not restricted to previously described terrestrial species. An isolate clustering with Nostoc PCC7120, an aquatic strain, was identified. This is the first comprehensive study to identify the endosymbionts within a cycad genus using samples obtained from their natural habitats. These results indicate that there is negligible host specialization of cyanobacterial endosymbionts within the cycad genus Macrozamia in the wild.",M1
20459313,"Infection-specific activation of the Medicago truncatula Enod11 early nodulin gene promoter during actinorhizal <e>root</e> nodulation.The MtEnod11 gene from Medicago truncatula is widely used as an early infection-related molecular marker for endosymbiotic associations involving both rhizobia and arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. In this article, heterologous expression of the MtEnod11 promoter has been studied in two actinorhizal trees, Casuarina glauca and Allocasuarina verticillata. Transgenic C. glauca and A. verticillata expressing a ProMtEnod11::beta-glucuronidase (gus) fusion were generated and the activation of the transgene investigated in the context of the symbiotic associations with the N-fixing actinomycete Frankia and both endo- and ectomycorrhizal fungi (Glomus intraradices and Pisolithus albus, respectively). ProMtEnod11::gus expression was observed in root hairs, prenodules, and nodules and could be correlated with the infection of plant cells by Frankia spp. However, no activation of the gus reporter gene was detected prior to infection or in response to either rhizobial Nod factors or the wasp venom peptide MAS-7. Equally, ProMtEnod11::gus expression was not elicited during the symbiotic associations with either ecto- or endomycorrhizal fungi. These observations suggest that, although there is a conservation of gene regulatory pathways between legumes and actinorhizal plants in cells accommodating endosymbiotic N-fixing bacteria, the events preceding bacterial infection or related to mycorrhization appear to be less conserved.",M1
20456234,"Diversity of mitochondrial large subunit rDNA haplotypes of Glomus intraradices in two agricultural field experiments and two semi-natural grasslands.Glomus intraradices, an arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), is frequently found in a surprisingly wide range of ecosystems all over the world. It is used as model organism for AMF and its genome is being sequenced. Despite the ecological importance of AMF, little has been known about their population structure, because no adequate molecular markers have been available. In the present study we analyse for the first time the intraspecific genetic structure of an AMF directly from colonized <e>roots</e> in the field. A recently developed PCR-RFLP approach for the mitochondrial rRNA large subunit gene (mtLSU) of these obligate symbionts was used and complemented by sequencing and primers specific for a particularly frequent mtLSU haplotype. We analysed root samples from two agricultural field experiments in Switzerland and two semi-natural grasslands in France and Switzerland. RFLP type composition of G. intraradices (phylogroup GLOM A-1) differed strongly between agricultural and semi-natural sites and the G. intraradices populations of the two agricultural sites were significantly differentiated. RFLP type richness was higher in the agricultural sites compared with the grasslands. Detailed sequence analyses which resolved multiple sequence haplotypes within some RFLP types even revealed that there was no overlap of haplotypes among any of the study sites except between the two grasslands. Our results demonstrate a surprisingly high differentiation among semi-natural and agricultural field sites for G. intraradices. These findings will have major implications on our views of processes of adaptation and specialization in these plant/fungus associations.",M1
20453910,"Characterization of arsenic-resistant bacteria from the rhizosphere of arsenic hyperaccumulator Pteris vittata.Arsenic hyperaccumulator fern Pteris vittata L. produces large amounts of <e>root</e> exudates that are hypothesized to solubilize arsenic and maintain a unique rhizosphere microbial community. Total heterotrophic counts on rich or defined media supplemented with up to 400 mmol/L of arsenate showed a diverse arsenate-resistant microbial community from the rhizosphere of P. vittata growing in arsenic-contaminated sites. Twelve bacterial isolates tolerating 400 mmol/L of arsenate in liquid culture were identified. Selected bacterial isolates belonging to different genera were tested for their resistance to osmotic and oxidative stresses. Results showed that growth was generally better under osmotic stress generated by arsenic than under that generated by NaCl or PEG 6000, demonstrating that arsenic detoxification metabolism also cross-protected bacterial isolates from arsenic-induced osmotic stress. After 32 h of growth, all arsenate at 1 mmol/L was reduced to arsenite by strains Naxibacter sp. AH4, Mesorhizobium sp. AH5, and Pseudomonas sp. AH21, but arsenite at 1 mmol/L remained unchanged. Sensitivity to hydrogen peroxide was similar to that in broad-host pathogen Salmonella enterica sv. Typhimurium wild type, except strain AH4. The results suggested that these arsenic-resistant bacteria are metabolically adapted to arsenic-induced osmotic or oxidative stresses in addition to the specific bacterial system to exclude cellular arsenic. Both these adaptations contribute to the high arsenic resistance in the bacterial isolates.",M1
20450044,"[Constituents from a water-soluble portion of ethanolic extract of Iodes cirrhosa]OBJECTIVE: To investigate chemical constituents of Iodes cirrhosa. METHOD: Constituents were isolated by using a combination of various chromatographic techniques including column chromatography over silica gel, Sephadex LH-20, and C-18, as well as reversed-phase HPLC. Structures of the isolates were identified by spectroscopic and chemical methods. RESULT: Twenty-four compounds were obtained from a H2O-soluble portion of an ethanolic extract of the <e>root</e> of lodes cirrhosa Turcz.

20429298,"[Protonophores as inducers of energy dependent changes in the ultrastructure of wheat <e>root</e> cells mitochondria]The effects of protonophores, 2, 4-DNP (2, 4-dinitrophenol) and CCCP (carbonyl cyanide m-chlorophenyl-hydrazone), on plasma membrane potential, release of K+ into incubation medium, respiratory metabolism, ATP content, and changes in the ultrastructure of cells from excised roots of wheat seedlings were studied. Dissipation of the plasma membrane potential, release of K+ ions and inhibition of the rate of oxygen consumption by the cells were observed following 1 h incubation of roots with the protonophores. Mitochondrial had condensed appearance with numerous sharply defined and slightly swollen cristae. The evidence for cytoplasmic acidification was provided by an increase in plasma membrane potential, a decrease in K+ release into the incubation medium and an increase in ATP content in the cells after 4 h treatment with the protonophores. The protonophores caused unusual spatial arrangements of cristae in mitochondria, e. g. stacked on the top of each other, or having the shape of propellers or florets. Such re-organization of cristae might be of adaptive significance in response to increased concentration of H+ in cytoplasm. After 6 h exposure of the cells to the protonophores, cells ultrastructure destruction started. It is suggested that observed ultrastructural changes in the mitochondria reflect changes in their functional activity and the physiological state of cells during their long-term exposure to the protonophores.",M1
20423508,"Tomato <e>root</e> transcriptome response to a nitrogen-enriched soil patch.BACKGROUND: Nitrogen (N), the primary limiting factor for plant growth and yield in agriculture, has a patchy distribution in soils due to fertilizer application or decomposing organic matter. Studies in solution culture over-simplify the complex soil environment where microbial competition and spatial and temporal heterogeneity challenge roots' ability to acquire adequate amounts of nutrients required for plant growth. In this study, various ammonium treatments (as 15N) were applied to a discrete volume of soil containing tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) roots to simulate encounters with a localized enriched patch of soil. Transcriptome analysis was used to identify genes differentially expressed in roots 53 hrs after treatment. RESULTS: The ammonium treatments resulted in significantly higher concentrations of both ammonium and nitrate in the patch soil. The plant roots and shoots exhibited increased levels of 15N over time, indicating a sustained response to the enriched environment. Root transcriptome analysis identified 585 genes differentially regulated 53 hrs after the treatments. Nitrogen metabolism and cell growth genes were induced by the high ammonium (65 mug NH4+-N g-1 soil), while stress response genes were repressed. The complex regulation of specific transporters following the ammonium pulse reflects a simultaneous and synergistic response to rapidly changing concentrations of both forms of inorganic N in the soil patch. Transcriptional analysis of the phosphate transporters demonstrates cross-talk between N and phosphate uptake pathways and suggests that roots increase phosphate uptake via the arbuscular mycorrhizal symbiosis in response to N. CONCLUSION: This work enhances our understanding of root function by providing a snapshot of the response of the tomato root transcriptome to a pulse of ammonium in a complex soil environment. This response includes an important role for the mycorrhizal symbiosis in the utilization of an N patch.",M1
20421235,"Analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana <e>root</e> growth kinetics with high temporal and spatial resolution.BACKGROUND: Methods exist to quantify the distribution of growth rate over the root axis. However, non-destructive, high-throughput evaluations of total root elongation in controlled environments and the field are lacking in growth studies. A new imaging approach to analyse total root elongation is described. SCOPE: High pixel resolution of the images enables the study of growth in short time intervals and provides high temporal resolution. Using the method described, total root elongation rates are calculated from the displacement of the root tip. Although the absolute root elongation rate changes in response to growth conditions, this set-up enables root growth of Arabidopsis wild-type seedlings to be followed for more than 1 month after germination. The method provides an easy approach to decipher root extension rate and much simpler calculations compared with other methods that use segmental growth to address this question. CONCLUSIONS: The high temporal resolution allows small modifications of total root elongation growth to be revealed. Furthermore, with the options to investigate growth of various mutants in diverse growth conditions the present tool allows modulations in root growth kinetics due to different biotic and abiotic stimuli to be unravelled. Measurements performed on Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Col0) plants revealed rhythms superimposed on root elongation. Results obtained from the starchless mutant pgm, however, present a clearly modified pattern. As expected, deviation is strongest during the dark period.",M1
20420309,"Vasoconstrictor and inotropic effects induced by the <e>root</e> bark extracts of Anthocleista schweinfurthii.The present study was undertaken to investigate the cardiovascular effect of three extracts from the root bark of Anthocleista schweinfurthii Gilg.: an aqueous extract (AE), a dichloromethane extract (DCMR) and a fraction enriched in cardiac glycoside type compounds (CARDAN). In isolated perfused frog heart, bolus injection of the extracts produced a positive inotropic effect. The responses to AE and DCMR, but not to CARDAN, were depressed by propranolol. In isolated rat aorta, DCMR produced a transient increase in contractile tension while AE and CARDAN induced a sustained constriction. AE vasoconstrictor effect was abolished by phentolamine, while contraction evoked by CARDAN was antagonized by verapamil. In aortic rings contracted in low K+ media, the addition of K+ evoked a relaxation, which was abolished by ouabain, depressed by DCMR but not affected by either A(E) or CARDAN. These observations indicate that Anthocleista schweinfurthii contains substances that promote vasoconstriction and increase cardiac contraction. The effect of DCMR was only partially mediated by inhibition of the Na+ pump while the mechanism of action of A(E) and CARDAN was distinct from the inhibition of the Na+, K+ - ATPase pump, but could involve adrenergic receptors, or either direct or indirect activation of L-type calcium channels.",M1
20420308,"Identification of sakurasosaponin as a cytotoxic principle from Jacquinia flammea.The crude ethanolic extract of leaves, stem-bark and <e>roots</e> of J. flammea were tested for their cytotoxic effect against two mammalian cell lines (HeLa and RAW 264.7) and four bacterial species (Staphylococcus aureus, Bacillus subtilis, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa). When tested at the concentration of 100 microg/mL, the root extract showed the highest cytotoxic activity against mammalian cells followed by the stem-bark extract while the leaves extract did not show significant activity. No antibacterial activity was detected for all extracts when tested up to 500 microg/disc in the disc diffusion assay. The cytotoxic root extract was subjected to fractionation using solvents of ascending polarity: petroleum ether, chloroform, ethylacetate, butanol and water. The water fraction which showed cytotoxic activity was further subjected to routine bioassay-guided fraction to lead to the isolation of sakurasosaponin as the active principle. The recorded IC50 value for sakurasosaponin was 11.3 +/- 1.52 and 3.8 +/- 0.25 microM (n=3) against HeLa and RAW 264.7 respectively. The identification of sakurasosaponin was based on analysis of spectroscopic data.",M1

20418897,"Glycyrrhetinic acid inhibits ICAM-1 expression via blocking JNK and NF-kappaB pathways in TNF-alpha-activated endothelial cells.AIM: To investigate the effects of glycyrrhetinic acid (GA), an active component extracted from the <e>root</e> of Glycyrrhizae glabra, on the expression of intercellular adhesion molecule-1 (ICAM-1) in tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha)-activated human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVEC). METHODS: ICAM-1 mRNA and protein levels were detected using RT-PCR and cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. The adherence of human monocytic THP-1 cells labeled with [(3)H]thymidine to HUVEC was determined by counting radioactivity with a scintillation counter. The activation of mitogen-activated protein kinases as well as the degradation of I kappaB and nuclear factor-kappaB (NF-kappaB) or phospho-c-Jun in the nucleus were detected by western blots. NF-kappaB binding activity was detected using electrophoretic mobility shift assay. RESULTS: GA (50 and 100 micromol/L) significantly inhibits TNF-alpha-induced ICAM-1 mRNA and protein expressions, as well as THP-1 cell adhesiveness in HUVEC. GA selectively inhibited TNF-alpha-activated signal pathway of c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), without affecting extracellular signal-regulated kinase 1/2 and p38. Furthermore, GA apparently inhibited I kappaB/NF-kappaB signaling system by preventing I kappaB degradation, NF-kappaB translocation, and NF-kappaB/DNA binding activity. Finally, pretreatment with GA or the inhibitors of NF-kappaB, JNK, and p38 reduced the ICAM-1 protein expression induced by TNF-alpha. CONCLUSION: GA inhibits TNF-alpha-stimulated ICAM-1 expression, leading to a decrease in adherent monocytes to HUVEC. This inhibition is attributed to GA interruption of both JNK/c-Jun and I kappaB/NF-kappaB signaling pathways, which decrease activator protein-1 (AP-1) and NF-kappaB mediated ICAM-1 expressions. The results suggest that GA may provide a beneficial effect in treating vascular diseases associated with inflammation, such as atherosclerosis.",M1
20416102,"De novo sequencing and analysis of the American ginseng <e>root</e> transcriptome using a GS FLX Titanium platform to discover putative genes involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis.BACKGROUND: American ginseng (Panax quinquefolius L.) is one of the most widely used herbal remedies in the world. Its major bioactive constituents are the triterpene saponins known as ginsenosides. However, little is known about ginsenoside biosynthesis in American ginseng, especially the late steps of the pathway. RESULTS: In this study, a one-quarter 454 sequencing run produced 209,747 high-quality reads with an average sequence length of 427 bases. De novo assembly generated 31,088 unique sequences containing 16,592 contigs and 14,496 singletons. About 93.1% of the high-quality reads were assembled into contigs with an average 8-fold coverage. A total of 21,684 (69.8%) unique sequences were annotated by a BLAST similarity search against four public sequence databases, and 4,097 of the unique sequences were assigned to specific metabolic pathways by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes. Based on the bioinformatic analysis described above, we found all of the known enzymes involved in ginsenoside backbone synthesis, starting from acetyl-CoA via the isoprenoid pathway. Additionally, a total of 150 cytochrome P450 (CYP450) and 235 glycosyltransferase unique sequences were found in the 454 cDNA library, some of which encode enzymes responsible for the conversion of the ginsenoside backbone into the various ginsenosides. Finally, one CYP450 and four UDP-glycosyltransferases were selected as the candidates most likely to be involved in ginsenoside biosynthesis through a methyl jasmonate (MeJA) inducibility experiment and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis based on a real-time PCR assay. CONCLUSIONS: We demonstrated, with the assistance of the MeJA inducibility experiment and tissue-specific expression pattern analysis, that transcriptome analysis based on 454 pyrosequencing is a powerful tool for determining the genes encoding enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites in non-model plants. Additionally, the expressed sequence tags (ESTs) and unique sequences from this study provide an important resource for the scientific community that is interested in the molecular genetics and functional genomics of American ginseng.",M1
20415137,"Rooting response of five pomegranate varieties to indole butyric acid concentration and cuttings age.The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of cutting age and Indole Butyric Acid (IBA) treatments on five pomegranate varieties propagation by stem cuttings. The experiment was carried out in a partially controlled glasshouse conditions at Mutah University, Jordan. The treatments comprised of two types of cuttings, i.e., hardwood and semi-hardwood; five concentrations of IBA, i.e., 3,000, 6,000, 9,000 and 12,000 ppm as quick dip (10 sec) as well as five Jordanian pomegranate varieties (Kdaree Hello, Hmadee Hmaree, Kdaree Sfaree, Zeklabi, Maleese). In this study, the percentage of cuttings that rooted, the number of <e>roots</e> produced per cutting, root length and diameter and root weight per cutting were recorded. It was obvious that the rootability of pomegranate is influenced by the interactive effect of cuttings age, IBA concentration and variety as well as by the single effect of either. The cuttings taken from hardwood stems had higher rooting percentage than those taken from semi-hardwood stems with a considerable differences in rootability between varieties under this study. The highest percentage of cuttings that rooted was observed in Hmadee Hmaree (70%), Zeklabee (69%) and Malesse (73%), while the lowest rooting percentage in Khdaree Hello (58%) and Kdaree Sfaree (49%) varieties. Zeklabee and Hmadee Hmaree varieties when compared with other varieties gave more favorable results at 6000 to 9000 ppm IBA in terms of the percentage of cuttings that rooted, the number of roots produced per cutting and root weight per cutting using both semi- and hard-wood cuttings. It was concluded that the increasing dose of IBA could be useful in increasing rooting potential and other root characteristics in pomegranate.",M1
20410882,"Cell signalling by microRNA165/6 directs gene dose-dependent <e>root</e> cell fate.A key question in developmental biology is how cells exchange positional information for proper patterning during organ development. In plant roots the radial tissue organization is highly conserved with a central vascular cylinder in which two water conducting cell types, protoxylem and metaxylem, are patterned centripetally. We show that this patterning occurs through crosstalk between the vascular cylinder and the surrounding endodermis mediated by cell-to-cell movement of a transcription factor in one direction and microRNAs in the other. SHORT ROOT, produced in the vascular cylinder, moves into the endodermis to activate SCARECROW. Together these transcription factors activate MIR165a and MIR166b. Endodermally produced microRNA165/6 then acts to degrade its target mRNAs encoding class III homeodomain-leucine zipper transcription factors in the endodermis and stele periphery. The resulting differential distribution of target mRNA in the vascular cylinder determines xylem cell types in a dosage-dependent manner.",M1
20409273,"Getting to the <e>root</e> of plant biology: impact of the Arabidopsis genome sequence on root research.Prior to the availability of the genome sequence, the root of Arabidopsis had attracted a small but ardent group of researchers drawn to its accessibility and developmental simplicity. Roots are easily observed when grown on the surface of nutrient agar media, facilitating analysis of responses to stimuli such as gravity and touch. Developmental biologists were attracted to the simple radial organization of primary root tissues, which form a series of concentric cylinders around the central vascular tissue. Equally attractive was the mode of propagation, with stem cells at the tip giving rise to progeny that were confined to cell files. These properties of root development reduced the normal four-dimensional problem of development (three spatial dimensions and time) to a two-dimensional problem, with cell type on the radial axis and developmental time along the longitudinal axis. The availability of the complete Arabidopsis genome sequence has dramatically accelerated traditional genetic research on root biology, and has also enabled entirely new experimental strategies to be applied. Here we review examples of the ways in which availability of the Arabidopsis genome sequence has enhanced progress in understanding root biology.",M1
20405311,"Arabidopsis EMBRYOMAKER encoding an AP2 domain transcription factor plays a key role in developmental change from vegetative to embryonic phase.Although several types of plant cells retain the competence to enter into embryonic development without fertilization, the molecular mechanism(s) underlying ectopic embryogenesis is largely unknown. To gain insight into this mechanism, in a previous study we identified 136 ESTs specifically expressed in microspore embryogenesis of Brassica napus. Here, we describe the characterization of the Arabidopsis EMBRYOMAKER (EMK) gene, which is homologous to one of the identified Brassica ESTs (BnGemb-58) and encodes an AP2 domain transcription factor. The AtEMK was expressed in developing and mature embryos, but its rapid disappearance occurred during germination. After germination, the expression of AtEMK was found in the <e>root</e> apical meristem and the distal parts of cotyledons. Although a mutant lacking AtEMK exhibited no distinctive defects in the embryo, ectopic expression of AtEMK induced embryo-like structures from cotyledons. The embryo-like structures contained high concentration of lipids, expressed several embryo-specific genes, and could convert into independent plants, indicating that the structures are somatic embryos. In vitro culture, AtEMK enhanced the efficiency of somatic embryogenesis. Furthermore, ectopic expression of AtEMK caused the formation of trichomes on cotyledons, dedifferentiated several tissues into calli, and retarded root development, demonstrating that AtEMK is harmful for the normal development of plants after germination. From these results, we conclude that the AtEMK is a key player to maintain embryonic identity, and the rapid disappearance of AtEMK expression during germination is essential for the developmental transition between the embryonic and vegetative phases in plants.",M1
20404146,"A hyperactive quantitative trait locus allele of Arabidopsis BRX contributes to natural variation in <e>root</e> growth vigor.Quantitative trait loci analysis of natural Arabidopsis thaliana accessions is increasingly exploited for gene isolation. However, to date this has mostly revealed deleterious mutations. Among them, a loss-of-function allele identified the root growth regulator BREVIS RADIX (BRX). Here we present evidence that BRX and the paralogous BRX-LIKE (BRXL) genes are under selective constraint in monocotyledons as well as dicotyledons. Unexpectedly, however, whereas none of the Arabidopsis orthologs except AtBRXL1 could complement brx null mutants when expressed constitutively, nearly all monocotyledon BRXLs tested could. Thus, BRXL proteins seem to be more diversified in dicotyledons than in monocotyledons. This functional diversification was correlated with accelerated rates of sequence divergence in the N-terminal regions. Population genetic analyses of 30 haplotypes are suggestive of an adaptive role of AtBRX and AtBRXL1. In two accessions, Lc-0 and Lov-5, seven amino acids are deleted in the variable region between the highly conserved C-terminal, so-called BRX domains. Genotyping of 42 additional accessions also found this deletion in Kz-1, Pu2-7, and Ws-0. In segregating recombinant inbred lines, the Lc-0 allele (AtBRX(Lc-0)) conferred significantly enhanced root growth. Moreover, when constitutively expressed in the same regulatory context, AtBRX(Lc-0) complemented brx mutants more efficiently than an allele without deletion. The same was observed for AtBRXL1, which compared with AtBRX carries a 13 amino acid deletion that encompasses the deletion found in AtBRX(Lc-0). Thus, the AtBRX(Lc-0) allele seems to contribute to natural variation in root growth vigor and provides a rare example of an experimentally confirmed, hyperactive allelic variant.",M1

The objective of this study was to relate NO(3)-N leaching to variation in the uptake of N and the size and distribution of the root systems of different catch crops species. In a 3-yr lysimeter experiment, phacelia (Phacelia tanacetifolia Benth.), sunflower (Helianthus annuus L.), and a Brassica species (yellow mustard [Brassica alba L.] or a hybrid of turnip rape [B. rapa L. spp. oleifera (DC.) Metzg.] and Chinese cabbage [B. rapa L. ssp. chinensis (L.) Hanelt]) were grown after the harvest of spring wheat under two levels of N supply. Bare soil lysimeters served as the control. Water percolation from the lysimeters and the NO(3)(-) concentration in the leachate were measured weekly from the sowing until the presumed frost-kill of the catch crops. Minirhizotrons were used to assess the spatial and temporal patterns of root growth from 0.10 to 1.00 m. The catch crop species differed in their shoot biomass, N uptake, total NO(3)-N leaching, and root growth. The results suggested that there was no strict relationship between the total NO(3)-N leaching of each catch crop species and the N uptake or parameters that indicate static characteristics of the root system. In contrast, the ranking of each catch crop species by parameters that indicate early root growth was inversely related to the ranking of each catch crop species in NO(3)-N leaching. The rapid establishment of the root system is essential for a catch crop following spring wheat to reduce the amount of NO(3)-N leaching after the harvest of spring wheat.",M1
20398236,"Fungal carbohydrate support in the ectomycorrhizal symbiosis: a review.Ectomycorrhizal (ECM) symbiosis is a mutualistic interaction between certain soil fungi and fine <e>roots</e> of perennial plants, mainly forest trees, by which both partners become capable of efficiently colonising nutrient-limited environments. The success of this interaction is reflected in the dominance of ECM forest ecosystems in the Northern hemisphere. Apart from their economic importance (wood production), forest ecosystems are essential for large-scale carbon sequestration, leading to substantial reductions in anthropogenic CO(2) release. The biological function of ECM symbiosis is the exchange of fungus-derived mineral nutrients for plant-derived carbohydrates. Improved plant nutrition as a result of this interaction, however, has a price. Together with their fungal partner, root systems of ECM plants can receive about half of the photosynthetically fixed carbon. To enable such a strong carbohydrate sink, the monosaccharide uptake capacity and carbohydrate flux through glycolysis and intermediate carbohydrate storage pools (trehalose and/or mannitol) of mycorrhizal fungi is strongly increased at the plant-fungus interface. Apart from their function as a carbohydrate store, trehalose/mannitol are additionally considered to be involved in carbon allocation within the fungal colony. Dependent on the fungal species involved in the symbiosis, regulation and fine-tuning of fungal carbohydrate uptake and metabolism seems to be controlled either by developmental mechanisms or by the apoplastic sugar content. As a consequence of the increased carbohydrate demand in symbiosis, trees increase their photosynthetic capacity. In addition, host plants control and restrict carbohydrate flux towards their partner to avoid fungal parasitism. The mechanisms behind this phenomenon are still largely unknown but rates of local sucrose hydrolysis and hexose uptake by rhizodermal cells are thought to restrict fungal carbohydrate nutrition under certain conditions (e.g., reduced fungal nutrient export).",M1
20397393,"Influence of indian mustard (Brassica juncea) on rhizosphere soil solution chemistry in long-term contaminated soils: a rhizobox study.This study investigated the influence of Indian mustard (Brassica juncea) <e>root</e> exudation on soil solution properties (pH, dissolved organic carbon (DOC), metal solubility) in the rhizosphere using a rhizobox. Measurement was conducted following the cultivation of Indian mustard in the rhizobox filled four different types of heavy metal contaminated soils (two alkaline soils and two acidic soils). The growth of Indian mustard resulted in a significant increase (by 0.6 pH units) in rhizosphere soil solution pH of acidic soils and only a slight increase (&lt; 0.1 pH units) in alkaline soils. Furthermore, the DOC concentration increased by 17-156 mg/L in the rhizosphere regardless of soil type and the extent of contamination, demonstrating the exudation of DOC from root. Ion chromatographic determination showed a marked increase in the total dissolved organic acids (OAs) in rhizosphere. While root exudates were observed in all soils, the amount of DOC and OAs in soil solution varied considerably amongst different soils, resulting in significant changes to soil solution metals in the rhizosphere. For example, the soil solution Cd, Cu, Pb, and Zn concentrations increased in the rhizosphere of alkaline soils compared to bulk soil following plant cultivation. In contrast, the soluble concentrations of Cd, Pb, and Zn in acidic soils decreased in rhizosphere soil when compared to bulk soils. Besides the influence of pH and DOC on metal solubility, the increase of heavy metal concentration having high stability constant such as Cu and Pb resulted in a release of Cd and Zn from solid phase to liquid phase.",M1

The tsl strain Vienna 8 from the Ceratitis capitata Wied. (Diptera: Tephritidae), medfly, mass-rearing facility located in Juazeiro-BA, Brazil, was used. The results showed that sterile males either exposed or not to GRO exhibit similar dispersal behavior and postrelease survival. More than 60% of the sterile males, either treated or not treated with GRO, were recovered at a 25-m distance from the releasing point, approximately 20% at 50 m, and 5% in traps situated 100 m from the releasing point. Around 90% of the sterile males, exposed or not to GRO, were recovered 5 d after release of the sterile male individuals, whereas &lt;1% were recovered after 11 d.

20388277,"<e>Root</e> deformation reduces tolerance of lodgepole pine to attack by Warren root collar weevil.Surveys were conducted on regenerating stands of lodgepole pine to determine the relationship between root deformation and susceptibility to attack by the Warren root collar weevil, Hylobius warreni Wood. The total number of trees attacked by H. warreni did not differ between planted and natural trees. A matched case-control logistic regression suggested that root cross-sectional area was more important in predicting weevil attack for naturally regenerated trees than for planted trees, but weevils were associated with a larger reduction in height-to-diameter ratios for trees with planted root characteristics than for trees with natural root form. Neither the stability of attacked versus unattacked trees differed significantly and there was no significant interaction of weevil attack and tree type, but weevil-killed trees had different root characteristics than alive, attacked trees. Lateral distribution and root cross-sectional area were significant predictors of alive attacked trees versus weevil-killed trees, suggesting that trees with poor lateral spread or poor root cross-sectional area are more likely to die from weevil attack. We conclude that root deformation does not necessarily increase susceptibility to attack but may increase the likelihood of mortality. Thus, measures to facilitate good root form are needed when planting pine in areas with high risk of Warren root collar weevil attack.",M1
20388270,"Ecology of <e>root</e>-feeding beetles and their associated fungi on longleaf pine in Georgia.Root-feeding beetles, particularly of the curculionid subfamilies Scolytinae and Molytinae, are known to be effective vectors of Ophiostomatoid fungi. Infestation by these insects and subsequent infection by the Ophiostomatoid fungi may play an important role in accelerating symptom progression in pine declines. To examine the relationship between beetles and fungi in longleaf pine stands, root-feeding curculionids were collected in pitfall traps baited with ethanol and turpentine for 62 wk, and Ophiostomatoid fungi were isolated from their body surfaces. The most abundant root-feeding beetles captured were Hylastes tenuis, H. salebrosus, Pachylobius picivorus, Hylobius pales, and Dendroctonus terebrans. The number of insects captured peaked in spring and fall, although peaks for different insect taxa did not coincide. The most frequently isolated fungi were Grosmannia huntii, Leptographium procerum, L. terebrantis, and L. serpens. Other Ophiostomatoid fungi recovered included Ophiostoma spp. and Pesotum spp. Insect infestation data suggest that Hylastes spp. share an ecological niche, as do Hb. pales and P. picivorus, because the ratios of their fungal symbionts were similar. The fungi associated with D. terebrans suggest that it did not share habitat with the other principle vectors.",M1

The linear increase in fresh weight was found to be parallel to the alkaloids production. The transformed cultures were exposed to different elicitors, such as methyl jasmonate (MJ), quercetin and salicylic acid in order to increase their productivity. Pyrrolizidine alkaloids were quantitatively determined by HPLC. Estimation of total alkaloids was achieved by peak area calculations. MJ at a concentration of 100 microM induced the accumulation of total alkaloids about 19-fold compared to the untreated control. The flavonoid quercetin (Q) at a concentration of 50 microM enhanced the pyrrolizidine accumulation approximately 6-fold. The induction effect of both MJ and Q can be suppressed by pre-incubation of hairy root cultures with salicylic acid.",M1
20380206,"Optimal partitioning theory revisited: nonstructural carbohydrates dominate <e>root</e> mass responses to nitrogen.Under optimal partitioning theory (OPT), plants preferentially allocate biomass to acquire the resource that most limits growth. Within this framework, higher root mass under low nutrients is often assumed to reflect an allocation response to build more absorptive surface. However, higher root mass also could result from increased storage of total nonstructural carbohydrates (TNC) without an increase in non-storage mass or root surface area. To test the relative contributions of TNC and non-storage mass as components of root mass responses to resources, we grew seedlings of seven northern hardwood tree species (black, red, and white oak, sugar and red maple, American beech, and black cherry) in a factorial light x nitrogen (N) greenhouse experiment. Because root mass is a coarse metric of absorptive surface, we also examined treatment effects on fine-root surface area (FRSA). Consistent with OPT, total root mass as a proportion of whole-plant mass generally was greater in low vs. high N. However, changes in root mass were influenced by TNC mass in all seven species and were especially strong in the three oak species. In contrast, non-storage mass contributed to increased total root mass under low N in three of the seven species. Root morphology also responded, with higher fine-root surface area (normalized to root mass) under low vs. high N in four species. Although biomass partitioning responses to resources were consistent with OPT, our results challenge the implicit assumption that increases in root mass under low nutrient levels primarily reflect allocation shifts to build more root surface area. Rather, root responses to low N included increases in: TNC, non-storage mass and fine-root surface area, with increases in TNC being the largest and most consistent of these responses. The greatest TNC accumulation occurred when C was abundant relative to N. Total nonstructural carbohydrates storage could provide seedlings a carbon buffer when respiratory or growth demands are not synchronized with photosynthesis, flexibility in responding to uncertain and fluctuating abiotic and biotic conditions, and increased access to soil resources by providing an energy source for mycorrhizae, decomposers in the rhizosphere, or root uptake of nutrients.",M1

In this study, the plasma-membrane hydroxyl radical (HR)-activated K(+) channel responsible for K(+) efflux from root cells during stress accompanied by ROS generation is characterised. The channel showed 16-pS unitary conductance and was sensitive to Ca(2+), tetraethylammonium, Ba(2+), Cs(+) and free-radical scavengers. The channel was not found in the gork1-1 mutant, which lacks a major plasma-membrane outwardly rectifying K(+) channel. In intact Arabidopsis roots, both HRs and stress induced a dramatic K(+) efflux that was much smaller in gork1-1 plants. Tests with electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy showed that NaCl can stimulate HR generation in roots and this might lead to K(+)-channel activation. In animals, activation of K(+)-efflux channels by HRs can trigger programmed cell death (PCD). PCD symptoms in Arabidopsis roots developed much more slowly in gork1-1 and wild-type plants treated with K(+)-channel blockers or HR scavengers. Therefore, similar to animal counterparts, plant HR-activated K(+) channels are also involved in PCD. Overall, this study provides new insight into the regulation of plant cation transport by ROS and demonstrates possible physiological properties of plant HR-activated K(+) channels.",M1

Despite the importance of the disease, only limited information is available about the host-pathogen interaction at the cellular level. To evaluate the host plant interaction, an isolate of O. herpotricha expressing green fluorescent proteins (GFP) or red fluorescent proteins (tdTomato) was used to study the infection and colonization of <e>roots</e> and stolons of several bermudagrass cultivars. Roots of cultivars Tifway 419 and Midlawn were colonized similarly, resulting in extensive root necrosis, whereas an accession of Cynodon transvaalensis was less necrotic. The stele of C. transvaalensis roots was colonized but not those of Tifway 419 and Midlawn. For intact stolons, colonization was limited to the epidermis and defined macroscopic necrotic lesions were observed on Tifway 419 and Midlawn while C. transvaalensis stolon tissues remained mostly nonnecrotic. Internal colonization of stolons occurred when hyphae grew into wounds, resulting in necrosis in Tifway 419 and Midlawn, but not in C. transvaalensis. These studies suggest that the interaction of O. herpotricha with bermudagrass varies across host genotypes and the host tissues infected. The limited necrosis in C. transvaalensis tissues, though colonized, suggests an inherent tolerance to O. herpotricha.",M1

Using results obtained mainly with the plant model Arabidopsis, we summarize the description of the structure of root cap and the known molecular mechanisms regulating its functioning.

20371103,"Auxin: a major regulator of organogenesis.Plant development is characterized by the continuous initiation of tissues and organs. The meristems, which are small stem cell populations, are involved in this process. The shoot apical meristem produces lateral organs at its flanks and generates the growing stem. These lateral organs are arranged in a stereotyped pattern called phyllotaxis. Organ initiation in the peripheral zone of the meristem involves accumulation of the plant hormone auxin. Auxin is transported in a polar way by influx and efflux carriers located at cell membranes. Polar localization of the PIN1 efflux carrier in meristematic cells generates auxin concentration gradients and PIN1 localization depends, in turn, on auxin gradients: this feedback loop generates a dynamic auxin distribution which controls phyllotaxis. Furthermore, PIN-dependent local auxin gradients represent a common module for organ initiation, in the shoot and in the <e>root</e>.",M1

An Arabidopsis and a tobacco line were used, containing viral movement proteins fused to green fluorescent protein as a localization marker for plasmodesmata. Plasmodesmata were detected in walls between giant cells but also in walls toward neighboring cells. In syncytia, plasmodesmata were mainly detected at later stages. In young syncytia, few plasmodesmata were observed and a specific temporal callose deposition along plasmodesmata indicated impaired symplasmic exchange. In order to study the relevance of callose deposition for successful cyst nematode development in Arabidopsis, two mutant lines inhibited in callose synthesis and degradation, respectively, were used in nematode infection assays. Histological analyses showed that syncytia were smaller when callose degradation was reduced, indicating a significant importance of this process to cyst nematode development.",M1

Subchronic treatment of rats for 21 days caused comparable increase in body weights of rats in extract treated and control groups. The extract caused a dose-dependent increases in RBC, PCV, Hb, WBC, bleeding time and clotting time. The increases were only significant (P&lt;0.05) at the highest dose of the extract (81 mg/kg) for RBC and WBC when compared to control.

20358261,"The putative Arabidopsis zinc transporter ZTP29 is involved in the response to salt stress.Salt stress leads to a stress response, called the unfolded protein response (UPR), in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). UPR is also induced in a wide range of organisms by zinc deficiency. However, it is not clear whether regulation of zinc levels is involved in the initiation of the UPR in plant response to salt stress. In this study, a putative zinc transporter, ZTP29, was identified in Arabidopsis thaliana. ZTP29 localizes to the ER membrane and is expressed primarily in hypocotyl and cotyledon tissues, but its expression can be induced in <e>root</e> tissue by salt stress. T-DNA insertion into the ZTP29 gene led to NaCl hypersensitivity in seed germination and seedling growth, leaf etiolation, and widening of cells in the root elongation zone. In addition, in ztp29 mutant plants, salt stress-induced upregulation of the UPR pathway genes BiP2 and bZIP60 was inhibited. Furthermore, under conditions of salt stress, upregulation of BiP2 and bZIP60 was inhibited by treatment with high concentrations of zinc in both control and ztp29 plants. However, zinc chelation restored salt stress-induced BiP2 and bZIP60 upregulation in ztp29 mutant plants. These experimental results suggest that ZTP29 is involved in the response to salt stress, perhaps through regulation of zinc levels required to induce the UPR pathway.",M1
20358225,"Survival of Schismus arabicus seedlings exposed to desiccation depends on annual periodicity.Schismus arabicus, a desert annual grass, is one of the most common pasture annuals in the deserts of Israel and Asia. S. arabicus exhibits a unique set of adaptations and survival strategies, which enable it to germinate, develop and produce seeds even in years with annual rainfall of less than 100 mm. The current study examined whether an annual rhythm exists in the survival ability of S. arabicus seedlings exposed to desiccation. Our results indicate that survival of S. arabicus seedlings after six different periods of 7 to 42 days of desiccation depended on the month of germination of the caryopses (seeds). Seed germination was 80-100% in all experiments, regardless the month of germination; however, seedlings that germinated in different months varied in their <e>root</e> and shoot elongation rates. None of about 2,500 seedlings that germinated in July (in each of the 4 years) survived the desiccation treatment. The percentages of surviving seedlings in each month of June from 2002 to 2005 were less than 40%. In contrast, over 80% of the seedlings that germinated in each of the months of December and January survived after the desiccation periods of 7-42 days. Seedlings that survived were transferred to 5 L soil pots in which the seedlings developed into mature plants, completed their life cycle and produced seeds that germinated well. The current study demonstrated a novel phenomenon indicating that seedling survival in plants may depend on an annual periodicity according to the date of germination.",M1

Previously, we showed that JACKDAW (JKD), a zinc finger protein, localizes in the quiescent centre and the ground tissue, and regulates tissue boundaries and asymmetric cell division by delimiting SHORT-ROOT movement. Here, we provide evidence that JKD controls position-dependent signals that regulate epidermal-cell-type patterning. JKD is required for appropriately patterned expression of the epidermal cell fate regulators GLABRA2, CAPRICE and WEREWOLF. Genetic interaction studies indicate that JKD operates upstream of the epidermal patterning network in a SCRAMBLED (SCM)-dependent fashion after embryogenesis, but acts independent of SCM in embryogenesis. Tissue-specific induction experiments indicate non-cell-autonomous action of JKD from the underlying cortex cell layer to specify epidermal cell fate. Our findings are consistent with a model where JKD induces a signal in every cortex cell that is more abundant in the hair cell position owing to the larger surface contact of cells located over a cleft.",M1
20356952,"Plant Fe status affects the composition of siderophore-secreting microbes in the rhizosphere.BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Soil microbes have been demonstrated to play an important role in favouring plant iron (Fe) uptake under Fe-limiting conditions. However, the mechanisms involved are still unclear. This present study reported the effects of plant Fe status on the composition of siderophore-secreting microbes in the rhizosphere, and their potential function in improving plant Fe nutrition. METHODS: An Fe-efficient plant, red clover (Trifolium pratense 'Kenland') was cultured in a calcareous soil to obtain rhizosphere soils with (Fe-sufficient) or without (Fe-stressed) foliar FeEDTA spraying. The siderophore-producing ability of rhizospheric microbes was measured. The bioavailability of the siderophore-solubilized Fe from iron oxides/hydroxides was tested in hydroponic culture. KEY RESULTS: In rhizosphere soil, the number of microbes that secreted siderophores quickly was more in the Fe-stressed treatment than in the Fe-sufficient one, while the number of microbes that did not secret siderophores was the opposite. A significantly higher concentration of phenolics was detected in the rhizosphere soil of Fe-stressed plants. Moreover, after the soil was incubated with phenolic <e>root</e> exudates, the composition of the siderophore-secreting microbial community was similar with that of the rhizosphere of Fe-stressed plant. Additionally, the siderophores produced by a rhizospheric microbe isolated from the Fe-stressed treatment can well solubilize iron oxides/hydroxides, and the utilization of the siderophore-solubilized Fe by plant was even more efficient than EDTA-Fe. CONCLUSIONS: Iron-deficiency stress of red clover would alter the composition of siderophore-secreting microbes in the rhizosphere, which is probably due to the phenolics secretion of the root, and may in turn help to improve the solubility of Fe in soils and plant Fe nutrition via elevated microbial siderophore secretion.",M1
20331769,"Massively parallel 454-sequencing of fungal communities in Quercus spp. ectomycorrhizas indicates seasonal dynamics in urban and rural sites.We analysed two sites within and outside an urban development in a rural background to estimate the fungal richness, diversity and community composition in Quercus spp. ectomycorrhizas using massively parallel 454-sequencing in combination with DNA-tagging. Our analyses indicated that shallow sequencing ( approximately 150 sequences) of a large number of samples (192 in total) provided data that allowed identification of seasonal trends within the fungal communities: putative <e>root</e>-associated antagonists and saprobes that were abundant early in the growing season were replaced by common ectomycorrhizal fungi in the course of the growing season. Ordination analyses identified a number of factors that were correlated with the observed communities including host species as well as soil organic matter, nutrient and heavy metal enrichment. Overall, our application of the high throughput 454 sequencing provided an expedient means for characterization of fungal communities.",M1
20355109,"Effects of micronization on the physico-chemical properties of peels of three <e>root</e> and tuber crops.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of micronization on the physicochemical properties of the peels of root and tuber crops, including yam (Dioscorea alata L.), taro (Colocasia esculenta L.) and sweet potato (Ipomea batatas L.). Two continuous milling sections, including hammer milling and ball milling, were applied to three samples to obtain micro-sized particles of root and tuber peels. The micronization by ball-milling treatment for 10 h was carried out to investigate the distribution of particle sizes and the changes in physiochemical properties. RESULTS: The results indicate that the peels of three crops appeared to be significantly decreased in particle size after 10 h of ball-milling treatment. Moreover, the ball-milling treatments resulted in the redistribution of fiber components from insoluble fiber to soluble fiber. The micronization treatments decreased the bulk density but increased the solubility and water-holding capacities of the micronized peels. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that micronization treatments can improve functional properties of the fiber components of micronized peels, which provide a good source of dietary fiber in food applications.",M1
20355108,"Mycorrhizal colonization and grain Cd concentration of field-grown durum wheat in response to tillage, preceding crop and phosphorus fertilization.BACKGROUND: A 3-year field trial was conducted to investigate the effect of agricultural management practices including tillage, preceding crop and phosphate fertilization on <e>root</e> colonization by arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi and grain cadmium (Cd) concentration of durum wheat (Triticum turgidum L.). The relationship between grain Cd and soil and plant variables was explored to determine the primary factors affecting grain Cd concentration. RESULTS: Mycorrhizal colonization of the roots was reduced by conventional tillage or when the preceding crop was canola (Brassica napus L.), compared to minimum tillage or when the preceding crop was flax (Linum usitatissimum L.). In contrast, grain Cd was not consistently affected by any treatment. Grain Cd was generally below the maximum permissible concentration (MPC) of 100 microg Cd kg(-1) proposed by WHO. Grain Cd varied substantially from year to year, and could be predicted with 70% of variance accounted for by using the model: grain Cd concentration = - 321.9 + 44.5x ln(grain yield) + 0.26x soil DTPA-Cd + 182.5x soil electrical conductivity (EC)- 0.98x grain Zn concentration. CONCLUSIONS: These common agricultural management practices had no effect on grain Cd concentration in durum wheat though they impacted mycorrhizal colonization of roots. Grain yield and to a lesser extent soil conditions of EC and DTPA-Cd and grain Zn influenced grain Cd, whereas mycorrhizal colonization levels did not.",M1
20354195,"Gibberellins regulate lateral <e>root</e> formation in Populus through interactions with auxin and other hormones.The role of gibberellins (GAs) in regulation of lateral root development is poorly understood. We show that GA-deficient (35S:PcGA2ox1) and GA-insensitive (35S:rgl1) transgenic Populus exhibited increased lateral root proliferation and elongation under in vitro and greenhouse conditions, and these effects were reversed by exogenous GA treatment. In addition, RNA interference suppression of two poplar GA 2-oxidases predominantly expressed in roots also decreased lateral root formation. GAs negatively affected lateral root formation by inhibiting lateral root primordium initiation. A whole-genome microarray analysis of root development in GA-modified transgenic plants revealed 2069 genes with significantly altered expression. The expression of 1178 genes, including genes that promote cell proliferation, growth, and cell wall loosening, corresponded to the phenotypic severity of the root traits when transgenic events with differential phenotypic expression were compared. The array data and direct hormone measurements suggested crosstalk of GA signaling with other hormone pathways, including auxin and abscisic acid. Transgenic modification of a differentially expressed gene encoding an auxin efflux carrier suggests that GA modulation of lateral root development is at least partly imparted by polar auxin transport modification. These results suggest a mechanism for GA-regulated modulation of lateral root proliferation associated with regulation of plant allometry during the stress response.",M1

20352404,"Effect of bacterial inoculation, plant genotype and developmental stage on <e>root</e>-associated and endophytic bacterial communities in potato (Solanum tuberosum).Beneficial bacteria interact with plants by colonizing the rhizosphere and roots followed by further spread through the inner tissues, resulting in endophytic colonization. The major factors contributing to these interactions are not always well understood for most bacterial and plant species. It is believed that specific bacterial functions are required for plant colonization, but also from the plant side specific features are needed, such as plant genotype (cultivar) and developmental stage. Via multivariate analysis we present a quantification of the roles of these components on the composition of root-associated and endophytic bacterial communities in potato plants, by weighing the effects of bacterial inoculation, plant genotype and developmental stage. Spontaneous rifampicin resistant mutants of two bacterial endophytes, Paenibacillus sp. strain E119 and Methylobacterium mesophilicum strain SR1.6/6, were introduced into potato plants of three different cultivars (Eersteling, Robijn and Karnico). Densities of both strains in, or attached to potato plants were measured by selective plating, while the effects of bacterial inoculation, plant genotype and developmental stage on the composition of bacterial, Alphaproteobacterial and Paenibacillus species were determined by PCR-denaturing gradient gel-electrophoresis (DGGE). Multivariate analyses revealed that the composition of bacterial communities was mainly driven by cultivar type and plant developmental stage, while Alphaproteobacterial and Paenibacillus communities were mainly influenced by bacterial inoculation. These results are important for better understanding the effects of bacterial inoculations to plants and their possible effects on the indigenous bacterial communities in relation with other plant factors such as genotype and growth stage.",M1
20348434,"Common genetic pathways regulate organ-specific infection-related development in the rice blast fungus.Magnaporthe oryzae is the most important fungal pathogen of rice (Oryza sativa). Under laboratory conditions, it is able to colonize both aerial and underground plant organs using different mechanisms. Here, we characterize an infection-related development in M. oryzae produced on hydrophilic polystyrene (PHIL-PS) and on <e>roots</e>. We show that fungal spores develop preinvasive hyphae (pre-IH) from hyphopodia (root penetration structures) or germ tubes and that pre-IH also enter root cells. Changes in fungal cell wall structure accompanying pre-IH are seen on both artificial and root surfaces. Using characterized mutants, we show that the PMK1 (for pathogenicity mitogen-activated protein kinase 1) pathway is required for pre-IH development. Twenty mutants with altered pre-IH differentiation on PHIL-PS identified from an insertional library of 2885 M. oryzae T-DNA transformants were found to be defective in pathogenicity. The phenotypic analysis of these mutants revealed that appressorium, hyphopodium, and pre-IH formation are genetically linked fungal developmental processes. We further characterized one of these mutants, M1373, which lacked the M. oryzae ortholog of exportin-5/Msn5p (EXP5). Mutants lacking EXP5 were much less virulent on roots, suggesting an important involvement of proteins and/or RNAs transported by EXP5 during M. oryzae root infection.",M1
20348430,"Alkylresorcinol synthases expressed in Sorghum bicolor <e>root</e> hairs play an essential role in the biosynthesis of the allelopathic benzoquinone sorgoleone.Sorghum bicolor is considered to be an allelopathic crop species, producing phytotoxins such as the lipid benzoquinone sorgoleone, which likely accounts for many of the allelopathic properties of Sorghum spp. Current evidence suggests that sorgoleone biosynthesis occurs exclusively in root hair cells and involves the production of an alkylresorcinolic intermediate (5-[(Z,Z)-8',11',14'-pentadecatrienyl]resorcinol) derived from an unusual 16:3Delta(9,12,15) fatty acyl-CoA starter unit. This led to the suggestion of the involvement of one or more alkylresorcinol synthases (ARSs), type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) that produce 5-alkylresorcinols using medium to long-chain fatty acyl-CoA starter units via iterative condensations with malonyl-CoA. In an effort to characterize the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the pentadecyl resorcinol intermediate, a previously described expressed sequence tag database prepared from isolated S. bicolor (genotype BTx623) root hairs was first mined for all PKS-like sequences. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that three of these sequences were preferentially expressed in root hairs, two of which (designated ARS1 and ARS2) were found to encode ARS enzymes capable of accepting a variety of fatty acyl-CoA starter units in recombinant enzyme studies. Furthermore, RNA interference experiments directed against ARS1 and ARS2 resulted in the generation of multiple independent transformant events exhibiting dramatically reduced sorgoleone levels. Thus, both ARS1 and ARS2 are likely to participate in the biosynthesis of sorgoleone in planta. The sequences of ARS1 and ARS2 were also used to identify several rice (Oryza sativa) genes encoding ARSs, which are likely involved in the production of defense-related alkylresorcinols.",M1
20336312,"Expression pattern conferred by a glutamic acid-rich protein gene promoter in field-grown transgenic cassava (Manihot esculenta Crantz).A major constraint for incorporating new traits into cassava using biotechnology is the limited list of known/tested promoters that encourage the expression of transgenes in the cassava's starchy <e>roots</e>. Based on a previous report on the glutamic-acid-rich protein Pt2L4, indicating a preferential expression in roots, we cloned the corresponding gene including promoter sequence. A promoter fragment (CP2; 731 bp) was evaluated for its potential to regulate the expression of the reporter gene GUSPlus in transgenic cassava plants grown in the field. Intense GUS staining was observed in storage roots and vascular stem tissues; less intense staining in leaves; and none in the pith. Consistent with determined mRNA levels of the GUSPlus gene, fluorometric analyses revealed equal activities in root pulp and stems, but 3.5 times less in leaves. In a second approach, the activity of a longer promoter fragment (CP1) including an intrinsic intron was evaluated in carrot plants. CP1 exhibited a pronounced tissue preference, conferring high expression in the secondary phloem and vascular cambium of roots, but six times lower expression levels in leaf vascular tissues. Thus, CP1 and CP2 may be useful tools to improve nutritional and agronomical traits of cassava by genetic engineering. To date, this is the first study presenting field data on the specificity and potential of promoters for transgenic cassava.",M1
20334630,"Disruption of actin filaments induces mitochondrial Ca2+ release to the cytoplasm and [Ca2+]c changes in Arabidopsis <e>root</e> hairs.BACKGROUND: Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that move along actin filaments, and serve as calcium stores in plant cells. The positioning and dynamics of mitochondria depend on membrane-cytoskeleton interactions, but it is not clear whether microfilament cytoskeleton has a direct effect on mitochondrial function and Ca2+ storage. Therefore, we designed a series of experiments to clarify the effects of actin filaments on mitochondrial Ca2+ storage, cytoplasmic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c), and the interaction between mitochondrial Ca2+ and cytoplasmic Ca2+ in Arabidopsis root hairs. RESULTS: In this study, we found that treatments with latrunculin B (Lat-B) and jasplakinolide (Jas), which depolymerize and polymerize actin filaments respectively, decreased membrane potential and Ca2+ stores in the mitochondria of Arabidopsis root hairs. Simultaneously, these treatments induced an instantaneous increase of cytoplasmic Ca2+, followed by a continuous decrease. All of these effects were inhibited by pretreatment with cyclosporin A (Cs A), a representative blocker of the mitochondrial permeability transition pore (mPTP). Moreover, we found there was a Ca2+ concentration gradient in mitochondria from the tip to the base of the root hair, and this gradient could be disrupted by actin-acting drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Based on these results, we concluded that the disruption of actin filaments caused by Lat-B or Jas promoted irreversible opening of the mPTP, resulting in mitochondrial Ca2+ release into the cytoplasm, and consequent changes in [Ca2+]c. We suggest that normal polymerization and depolymerization of actin filaments are essential for mitochondrial Ca2+ storage in root hairs.",M1

The modifications were necessary to improve the performance of the method for matrixes beyond corn and peanuts. The extraction solvent was changed from a mixture of methanol and water to acetonitrile and water. The accuracy, repeatability, and reproducibility characteristics of this method were determined. Replicates of 10 test portions of each powdered root (black cohosh, echinacea, ginger, ginseng, kava kava, and valerian) at each spiking level (AFs at 0, 2, 4, 8, and 16 ng/g) were analyzed on 3 separate days. Test portions were extracted with acetonitrile-water (84 + 16, v/v), and the extracts were centrifuged, diluted with phosphate-buffered saline, filtered, and applied to an immunoaffinity column containing antibodies specific for AFs. After the column was washed with water, the toxins were eluted from the column with methanol and quantified by HPLC with fluorescence detection. All test materials except kava kava were found to contain AF at &lt; 0.1 ng/g. Kava kava was naturally contaminated with AFs at 0.5 ng/g. Average within-day and between-days recoveries of AFs from botanical roots ranged from 88 to 112 and from 86 to 118%, respectively. Total RSD values for within-day and between-days repeatability ranged from 1.4 to 15.9%. HorRat values were &lt; 0.4 for all of the matrixes examined.

20334134,"Honokiol and magnolol production by in vitro micropropagated plants of Magnolia dealbata, an endangered endemic Mexican species.An efficient protocol for the in vitro propagation of Magnolia dealbata Zucc., an important medicinal plant that is the source of the anxiolytic and anticancer compounds honokiol and magnolol, was established. This plant is wild-crafted, and conservationists have expressed concerns with regard to the sustainability of production. In the present work, two factors were found to be of importance for the regeneration of M. dealbata and the production of honokiol and magnolol. These factors were the type of explants and the combination and concentration of plant-growth regulators. Green, compact, nodular organogenic callus was obtained from leaf explants in a medium fortified with Murashige and Skoog salts and supplemented with 1.5 mg/L 2,4-dicholorophenoxyacetic acid and 1.5 mg/L kinetin. Shoots multiplication from callus cultures was achieved in the Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium with 1.5 mg/L thidiazuron (TDZ). Phenol secretion was controlled by the addition of 250 mg/L of activated charcoal. For rooting, shoots were transferred to MS medium supplemented with several auxins. After <e>root</e> induction, the plants were hardened in earthen pots containing sand, soil, and vermiculite. The contents of honokiol (HK) and magnolol (MG) were determined in different plant materials by high-performance liquid chromatography-diode-array detection techniques. This analysis revealed that the honokiol and magnolol content in aerial and underground parts of micropropagated M. dealbata were higher than that observed in wild plants (both 6 months old). Our results suggest that conservation of M. dealbata is possible by means of in vitro multiplication of leaf-derived callus. The usefulness of M. dealbata regeneration and production of HK and MG may be attributed to the proper selection of explant sourcing and identification of the correct growth medium to support adequate growth. This careful selection of explants and growth medium leads to a very useful source of plant material for pharmacological and phytomedicinal screening applications and, above all, would safeguard this plant species from the threat of extinction.",M1
20334119,"Specific maceration and induction of PR-3 gene in potato tuber tissue by Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum type III secretion system mutants.The exact function of type III secretion system in some phytopathogenes including Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. atrosepticum (Pca) is not understood and is a matter of debate. The aim of this study were to determine specific effect of type III secretion system on potato tubers and to reveal the connection of this system with potato resistant genes such as PR-3. A Pca hrpW fragment was subcloned into a low-copy-number cloning vector (pZH448). The resulting plasmid (pAS19) was then conjugated into the wild-type and mutant strains of Pca by type III secretion system. The virulence property of different Pca strains was studied and the influence of over expression of hrpW on maceration activity was also investigated. Furthermore, the effect of mentioned mutation on the maceration of carrot-<e>root</e> was evaluated. Finally, using real-time PCR, the copy-number of PR-3 gene in potato tuber tissue was assessed. In conclusion, for type III secretion system mutant strains, in contrast with the wild-type, the maceration amount of potato tuber tissue decreased after over expression of hrpW while inoculation of tubers by mutants, increased this amount. In the case of potato, HrpN and DspE proteins appeared to be avirulent factors. Compared with the wild-type strains, Pca nominated mutants significantly reduced potato PR-3 expression thus, PR-3 expression level in potato tuber tissue in answer to infiltration by Pca, depends on functional type III secretion system in the bacterium.",M1

Nine strains of Klebsiella were isolated from rhizosphere of wheat (var. Lokwan) and identified as K. pneumoniae by 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Six K. pneumoniae strains showed in vitro IAA production. Colorimetric analysis showed that K8 produced maximum IAA (27.5 mg l(-1)) in the presence of tryptophan (1 mg ml(-1)) at 72 h of incubation with optimum conditions as pH 8.0, 37 degrees C and 0.5% (w/v) NaCl concentration. GC-MS analysis and IR studies confirmed presence of IAA in the cell filtrates of strain K8. Effect of six IAA producing Klebsiella strains on plant growth was studied by performing series of seed germination tests using moth bean seeds under axenic conditions and pot experiments using sterilized soil and wheat seeds (var. Lokwan). Strain K11 and K42 demonstrated increase in <e>root</e> length of inoculated moth beans (approximately 92.71% over the control). Results of pot experiments indicated that almost all the six IAA producing Klebsiella strains significantly increased the root length and shoot height of inoculated wheat seedlings over the control.

20309617,"Subterranean herbivore-induced volatiles released by citrus <e>roots</e> upon feeding by Diaprepes abbreviatus recruit entomopathogenic nematodes.Herbivore-induced volatile emissions benefit plant hosts by recruiting natural enemies of herbivorous insects. Such tritrophic interactions have been examined thoroughly in the above-ground terrestrial environment. Recently, similar signals have also been described in the subterranean environment, which may be of equal importance for indirect plant defense. The larvae of the root weevil, Diaprepes abbreviates, are a serious pest of citrus. Infestations can be controlled by the use of entomopathogenic nematodes, yet the interactions between the plant, insect and nematode are poorly understood and remain unpredictable. In bioassays that used a root zone six-arm olfactometer, citrus roots ('Swingle citrumelo' rootstock) recruited significantly more entomopathogenic nematodes (Steinernema diaprepesi) when infested with root weevil larvae than non-infested roots. Infested plants were more attractive to nematodes than larvae alone. Roots damaged by weevil larvae attracted more nematodes than mechanically damaged roots and sand controls. By dynamic in situ collection and GC-MS analysis of volatiles from soil, we determined that four major terpene compounds were produced by infested plant roots that were not found in samples from non-infested roots or soil that contained only larvae. Solvent extracts of weevil-infested roots attracted more nematodes than extracts of non-infested roots in a two choice sand-column bioassay. These findings suggest that Swingle citrus roots release induced volatiles as an indirect defense in response to herbivore feeding, and that some of these induced volatiles function as attractants for entomopathogenic nematodes.",M1
20307286,"Accumulation of phenanthrene by <e>roots</e> of intact wheat (Triticum acstivnm L.) seedlings: passive or active uptake?BACKGROUND: Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) are of particular concern due to their hydrophobic, recalcitrant, persistent, potentially carcinogenic, mutagenic and toxic properties, and their ubiquitous occurrence in the environment. Most of the PAHs in the environment are present in surface soil. Plants grown in PAH-contaminated soils or water can become contaminated with PAHs because of their uptake. Therefore, they may threaten human and animal health. However, the mechanism for PAHs uptake by crop roots is little understood. It is important to understand exactly how PAHs are transported into the plant root system and into the human food chain, since it is beneficial in governing crop contamination by PAHs, remedying soils or waters polluted by PAHs with plants, and modeling potential uptake for risk assessment. RESULTS: The possibility that plant roots may take up phenanthrene (PHE), a representative of PAHs, via active process was investigated using intact wheat (Triticum acstivnm L.) seedlings in a series of hydroponic experiments. The time course for PHE uptake into wheat roots grown in Hoagland solution containing 5.62 microM PHE for 36 h could be separated into two periods: a fast uptake process during the initial 2 h and a slow uptake component thereafter. Concentration-dependent PHE uptake was characterized by a smooth, saturable curve with an apparent Km of 23.7 microM and a Vmax of 208 nmol g(-1) fresh weight h(-1), suggesting a carrier-mediated uptake system. Competition between PHE and naphthalene for their uptake by the roots further supported the carrier-mediated uptake system. Low temperature and 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP) could inhibit PHE uptake equally, indicating that metabolism plays a role in PHE uptake. The inhibitions by low temperature and DNP were strengthened with increasing concentration of PHE in external solution within PHE water solubility (7.3 muM). The contribution of active uptake to total absorption was almost 40% within PHE water solubility. PHE uptake by wheat roots caused an increase in external solution pH, implying that wheat roots take up PHE via a PHE/nH+ symport system. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that an active, carrier-mediated and energy-consuming influx process is involved in the uptake of PHE by plant roots.",M1
20307144,"Chlorophytum borivilianum as potential terminator of free radicals in various in vitro oxidation systems.Chlorophytum borivilianum is a very popular herb in traditional Indian medicine and used as a potent  Rasayana  drug in  Ayurveda  as a rejuvenator. Currently, a large body of evidence supports the key role of free radicals in diverse pathological conditions such as aging and atherosclerosis. The present investigation essentially focuses on the comprehensive account of in vitro antioxidant activity exerted by C.borivilianum <e>root</e> extracts (i.e., aqueous and ethanolic), to clarify the pharmacological antagonism of chemicals/metals-mediated oxidation. Graded-dose (25 to 1000 microg/ml) of aqueous extract exhibited higher antioxidant potency as evidenced by powerful nitric oxide, superoxide, hydroxyl, DPPH and ABTS(*+) radicals scavenging activity along with reducing capacity (Fe(3+)/ferricyanide complex and FRAP assays), metal chelating ability, as well as markedly suppressed the lipid peroxidation in mitochondrial fractions as compared to ethanolic extract. Further, aqueous extract significantly decreased (P &lt; 0.05) copper-mediated human serum and kinetics of LDL oxidation, as demonstrated by prolongation of lag phase time with decline of oxidation rate, conjugated dienes, lipid hydroperoxides and thiobarbituric acid reactive substances. In addition, the total polyphenol and flavonoid contents of aqueous extract were higher than that of ethanolic extract, which indicated a positive correlation between antioxidant activity and contents of total phenols. The IC(50) values of both extracts were also compared with appropriate antioxidant standards. Overall, aqueous extract of C.borivilianum root has significant powerful antioxidant activity and may favorably affect atherosclerosis risk status by reducing LDL oxidation susceptibility.",M1
20306024,"Insight into the evolutionary history of symbiotic genes of Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia deriving from Poland and Japan.The phylogeny of symbiotic genes of Robinia pseudoacacia (black locust) rhizobia derived from Poland and Japan was studied by comparative sequence analysis of nodA, nodC, nodH, and nifH loci. In phylogenetic trees, black locust symbionts formed a branch of their own suggesting that the spread and maintenance of symbiotic genes within Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia occurred through vertical transmission. There was 99-100% sequence similarity for nodA genes of Robinia pseudoacacia nodulators, 97-98% for nodC, and 97-100% for nodH and nifH loci. A considerable sequence conservation of sym genes shows that the symbiotic apparatus of Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia might have evolved under strong host plant constraints. In the nodA and nodC gene phylograms, Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia grouped with Phaseolus sp. symbionts, although they were not closely related to our isolates based on 16S rRNA genes, and with Mesorhizobium amorphae. nifH gene phylogeny of our isolates followed the evolutionary history of 16S rDNA and Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia grouped with Mesorhizobium genus species. Nodulation assays revealed that Robinia pseudoacacia rhizobia effectively nodulated their native host and also Amorpha fruticosa and Amorpha californica resulting in a significant enhancement of plant growth. The black locust <e>root</e> nodules are shown to be of indeterminate type.",M1
20304781,"Ectomycorrhizal identity determines respiration and concentrations of nitrogen and non-structural carbohydrates in <e>root</e> tips: a test using Pinus sylvestris and Quercus robur saplings.Fine roots play a significant role in plant and ecosystem respiration (RS); therefore, understanding factors controlling that process is important both to advancing understanding and potentially in modelling carbon (C) budgets. However, very little is known about the extent to which ectomycorrhizal (ECM) identity may influence RS or the underlying chemistry that may determine those rates. In order to test these relationships, we examined RS, measured as O(2) consumption, of first-order ECM root tips of Pinus sylvestris L. and Quercus robur L. saplings in relation to their ECM fungal symbionts and associated nitrogen (N), C and non-structural carbohydrate concentrations. Roots of P. sylvestris were colonized by Rhizopogon roseolus, Tuber sp. 1 and an unknown species of Pezizales. Fungal species colonizing Q. robur roots were Hebeloma sp., Tuber sp. 2 and one unidentified ECM fungus described as Tuber-like based on ECM morphology. ECM RS rates for different host species were significantly different and more than 97% of the variation in RS within a host species was explained by ECM root tip N concentrations. This may indicate that some of the variability in fine root RS-N relationships observed between and within different host species or their functional groups may be related to intraspecific host species differences in root tip N concentration among ECM fungal associates.",M1
20303656,"Genotoxicity effect of nitrobenzene on soybean (Glycine max) <e>root</e> tip cells.Nitrobenzene is a synthetic compound widely used in industry which can lead to environmental pollution. While the toxicity and carcinogenicity of nitrobenzene on humans and animals have been studied, less is known about its genotoxicity to plants. In this study, the genotoxic effects of nitrobenzene were investigated with growing soybean seedlings in solution culture. Compared with the control, the growth of soybean seedlings (taproot length, longest lateral root length and lateral roots number) decreased and showed statistics difference at nitrobenzene test concentration of 50 and 100mg/L. Micronucleus, chromosomal bridge and others chromosomal aberrations were observed in soybean root tip cells exposed to nitrobenzene. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations increased linearly with nitrobenzene test concentration between 5 and 50mg/L and decreased at 100mg/L which showed significant difference between control and 25mg/L or higher test concentration. Results of the present study suggest that nitrobenzene has genotoxicity on soybean root tip cells. The mechanism of genotoxicity of NB needs further study. It is concluded that high environmental levels of nitrobenzene in rivers, lakes and dam waters are hazardous to aquatic species and to irrigated plants.",M1
20302659,"Yeast functional screen to identify genetic determinants capable of conferring abiotic stress tolerance in Jatropha curcas.BACKGROUND: Environmentally inflicted stresses such as salinity and drought limit the plant productivity both in natural and agricultural system. Increasing emphasis has been directed to molecular breeding strategies to enhance the intrinsic ability of plant to survive stress conditions. Functional screens in microorganisms with heterologous genes are a rapid, effective and powerful tool to identify stress tolerant genes in plants. Jatropha curcas (Physic nut) has been identified as a potential source of biodiesel plant. In order to improve its productivity under stress conditions to benefit commercial plantations, we initiated prospecting of novel genes expressed during stress in J. curcas that can be utilized to enhance stress tolerance ability of plant. RESULTS: To identify genes expressed during salt tolerance, cDNA expression libraries were constructed from salt-stressed <e>roots</e> of J. curcas, regulated under the control of the yeast GAL1 system. Using a replica based screening, twenty thousand yeast transformants were screened to identify transformants expressing heterologous gene sequences from J. curcas with enhanced ability to tolerate stress. From the screen we obtained 32 full length genes from J. curcas [GenBank accession numbers FJ489601-FJ489611, FJ619041-FJ619057 and FJ623457-FJ623460] that can confer abiotic stress tolerance. As a part of this screen, we optimized conditions for salt stress in J. curcas, defined parameters for salt stress in yeast, as well as isolated three salt hypersensitive yeast strains shs-2, shs-6 and shs-8 generated through a process of random mutagenesis, and exhibited growth retardation beyond 750 mM NaCl. Further, we demonstrated complementation of the salt sensitive phenotypes in the shs mutants, and analyzed the expression patterns for selected J. curcas genes obtained from the screen in both leaf and root tissues after salt stress treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The approach described in this report provides a rapid and universal assay system for large scale screening of genes for varied abiotic stress tolerance within a short span of time. Using this screening strategy we could isolate both genes with previously known function in stress tolerance as well as novel sequences with yet unknown function in salt stress tolerance from J. curcas. The isolated genes could be over-expressed using plant expression system to generate and evaluate transgenic plants for stress tolerance as well as be used as markers for breeding salt stress tolerance in plants.",M1
20300871,"Zinc tolerance and uptake by Arabidopsis halleri ssp. gemmifera grown in nutrient solution.BACKGROUND, AIM, AND SCOPE: Zinc is an essential micronutrient element but its concentrations found in contaminated soils frequently exceed those required by the plant and soil organisms, and thus create danger to animal and human health. Phytoremediation is a technique, often employed in remediation of contaminated soils, which aims to remove heavy metals or other contaminants from soils or waters using plants. Arabidopsis (A.) halleri ssp. gemmifera is a plant recently found to be grown vigorously in heavy metal contaminated areas of Japan and it contained remarkably high amount of heavy metals in its shoots. However, the magnitude of Zn accumulation and tolerance in A. halleri ssp. gemmifera need to be investigated for its use as a phytoremediation plant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A. halleri ssp. gemmifera was grown for 3 weeks into half-strength nutrient solution with Zn (as ZnSO(4)) levels ranging from 0.2 to 2,000 microM. The harvested plants were separated into shoots and <e>roots</e>, dried in the oven, and ground. The plant tissue was digested with nitric-perchloric acid, and the Zn concentration in the digested solution was measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The results showed no reduction in shoot and root dry weight when plants were grown at 0.2 to 2,000 microM Zn in the solution. The highest Zn concentration measured in the shoots was 26,400 mg kg(-1) at 1,000 microM Zn, while in the roots, it was 71,000 mg kg(-1) at 2,000 microM Zn treatment. Similar to the Zn concentration in plant parts, maximum Zn accumulation of 62 mg plant(-1) in the shoots and 22 mg plant(-1) in the roots was obtained at 1,000 and 2,000 microM Zn in the solution. The percentage of Zn translocation in shoot varied from 69% to 90% of the total Zn, indicating that the shoot was the major sink of Zn accumulation in this plant. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study indicate that the growth of A. halleri ssp. gemmifera was not affected by the Zn level of up to 2,000 microM in the nutrient solution. The concentration of Zn found in shoot indicated that A. halleri ssp. gemmifera has an extraordinary ability to tolerate and accumulate Zn and hence a good candidate for the phytoremediation of Zn-polluted soil. RECOMMENDATIONS AND OUTLOOK: Based on the results presented in this study and earlier hydroponics, and field study, A. halleri ssp. gemmifera seems to be a potential heavy metals hyperaccumulator, and could be recommended to use for phytoremediation of Cd- and Zn-contaminated soils.",M1
20299074,"Reduction of compost phytotoxicity during the process of decomposition.Hog manure from windrows composted at different operating strategies was used in a bioassay to determine phytotoxicity. Twelve windows that differed in composting strategies (i.e. turning frequency and moisture content adjustment) were built. The effects of hog manure water extracts on seed germination and primary <e>root</e> growth of cress (Lepidum sativum L.) was measured. The germination index (GI, a product of relative seed germination and root elongation) was related to the chemical characteristics (electrical conductivity, nitrogen compounds, C:N ratio, heavy metals and humification parameters) of the hog manure. The water-extractable chemical properties of the hog manure that showed the highest negative correlation with GI were extractable Cu, extractable Zn and NH(4)(+)N, demonstrating that these chemical compounds gradually decrease during composting due to transformation to other compounds and immobilization effects. A GI&gt;80 (an indicator of the disappearance of phytotoxicity) was reached when the concentrations of NH(4)(+)-N, extractable Cu, and extractable Zn were 2gkg(-1), 15mgkg(-1), and 15mgkg(-1), respectively. Multiple regression analysis revealed that NH(4)(+)-N was the most important factors affecting the phytotoxicity of the hog manure. Composting strategies employed affected the speed of composting, time of maturation, and disappearance of phytotoxicity. The disappearance of phytotoxicity corresponded with the time of maturation of the hog manure. If optimum composting conditions (windrows turned every 4d with weekly moisture adjustment to 60%) are met, phytotoxicity disappears within 56d.",M1
20298468,"Molecular phylogeography of Carapichea ipecacuanha, an amphitropical shrub that occurs in the understory of both semideciduous and evergreen forests.The medicinal shrub Carapichea ipecacuanha (ipecac) is an amphitropic species with three disjunct areas of distribution. In the Brazilian Atlantic and Amazonian ranges, the species was associated mostly with the understory of seasonal semideciduous forests, whereas in the Central American-Colombian range, the species occurred in the understory of moist evergreen forests. We examined the phylogeographic structure of ipecac using chloroplast trnT-trnL and nuclear internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences from 120 and 46 specimens, respectively. To complement existing data on <e>root</e> alkaloid profiles, we used high-performance liquid chromatography to assess the levels of emetine and cephaeline in 33 specimens from the two Brazilian ranges. The three ranges shared neither nuclear nor chloroplast haplotypes. The phylogeographic structures showed an uneven distribution of genetic diversity, sharp breaks and high levels of genetic differentiation among ranges. Our results suggest that the extant populations are descendents of at least four distinct ancestral lineages. The Atlantic ipecacs showed higher levels of genetic diversity than ipecacs from the other two ranges; it is likely that they derive from two ancestral lineages, with long-term persistence in that region. The Amazonian ipecacs were monomorphic with respect to the ITS and cpDNA sequences, which supports the view that there was a recent expansion from a single parental source after a strong genetic bottleneck. The existence of a fourth distinct lineage is apparent from the high levels of genetic and chemical differentiation that we identified in the Central American-Columbian ipecacs.",M1
20238266,"Expression profiling of fungal genes during arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis establishment using direct fluorescent in situ RT-PCR.Expression profiling of fungal genes in the arbuscular mycorrhiza (AM) symbiosis has been based on studies of RNA extracted from fungal tissue or mycorrhizal <e>roots</e>, giving only a general picture of overall transcript levels in the targeted tissues. Information about the spatial distribution of transcripts within AM fungal structures during different developmental stages is essential to a better understanding of fungal activity in symbiotic interactions with host roots and to determine molecular events involved in establishment and functioning of the AM symbiosis. The obligate biotrophic nature of AM fungi is a challenge for developing new molecular methods to identify and localize their activity in situ. The direct fluorescent in situ (DIFIS) RT-PCR procedure described here represents a novel tool for spatial mapping of AM fungal gene expression simultaneously prior to root penetration, within fungal tissues in the host root and in the extraradical stage of fungal development.In order to enhance detection sensitivity of the in situ RT-PCR technique and enable localization of low abundance mRNA, we have adopted direct fluorescent labeling of primers for the amplification step to overcome the problem of low detection associated with digoxigenin or biotin-labeled primers and to avoid the multiplicity of steps associated with immunological detection. Signal detection has also been greatly improved by eliminating autofluorescence of AM fungal and root tissues using confocal microscopy.",M1
20235569,"High-spatial and high-mass resolution imaging of surface metabolites of Arabidopsis thaliana by laser desorption-ionization mass spectrometry using colloidal silver.High-spatial resolution and high-mass resolution techniques are developed and adopted for the mass spectrometric imaging of epicuticular lipids on the surface of Arabidopsis thaliana. Single cell level spatial resolution of approximately 12 mum was achieved by reducing the laser beam size by using an optical fiber with 25 mum core diameter in a vacuum matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization-linear ion trap (vMALDI-LTQ) mass spectrometer and improved matrix application using an oscillating capillary nebulizer. Fine chemical images of a whole flower were visualized in this high spatial resolution showing substructure of an anther and single pollen grains at the stigma and anthers. The LTQ-Orbitrap with a MALDI ion source was adopted to achieve MS imaging in high mass resolution. Specifically, isobaric silver ion adducts of C29 alkane (m/z 515.3741) and C28 aldehyde (m/z 515.3377), indistinguishable in low-resolution LTQ, can now be clearly distinguished and their chemical images could be separately constructed. In the application to <e>roots</e>, the high spatial resolution allowed molecular MS imaging of secondary roots and the high mass resolution allowed direct identification of lipid metabolites on root surfaces.",M1
20234049,"Auxin biosynthesis inhibitors, identified by a genomics-based approach, provide insights into auxin biosynthesis.Despite its importance in plant growth and development, the auxin biosynthetic pathway has remained elusive. In this study, we analyzed hormone series transcriptome data from AtGenExpress in Arabidopsis and found that aminoethoxyvinylglycine (AVG) had the strongest anti-auxin activity. We also identified other effective compounds such as L-amino-oxyphenylpropionic acid (AOPP) through additional screening. These inhibitors shared characteristics in that they inhibited pyridoxal enzymes and/or aminotransferases. They reduced endogenous IAA levels in both monocots and dicots. L-AOPP inhibited <e>root</e> development of Arabidopsis in main root elongation, gravitropism, root skewing and root hair formation. This inhibition was generally recovered after exogenous IAA treatment, and the recovery was almost completely to the level of non-inhibited seedlings. The compounds inhibited conversion from tryptophan to indole-3-pyruvic acid in enzyme extracts from Arabidopsis and wheat. Our data collectively suggest that the inhibitors directly blocked auxin biosynthesis, and that the major target site was tryptophan aminotransferase. This enzyme probably makes up one of the major biosynthesis pathways conserved among higher plants. Each inhibitor, however, demonstrated a different action spectrum in shoot and root of rice and tomato, indicating diversity in biosynthesis pathways between organs and species. Our results provide novel insights into auxin biosynthesis and action, and uncover structural characteristics of auxin biosynthesis inhibitors.",M1
20232906,"Bioactivity of chemically transformed humic matter from vermicompost on plant <e>root</e> growth.Chemical reactions (hydrolysis, oxidation, reduction, methylation, alkyl compounds detachment) were applied to modify the structure of humic substances (HS) isolated from vermicompost. Structural and conformational changes of these humic derivatives were assessed by elemental analyses, size exclusion chromatography (HPSEC), solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance ((13)C CPMAS-NMR), and diffusion ordered spectroscopy (DOSY-NMR), whereas their bioactivity was evaluated by changes in root architecture and proton pump activation of tomato and maize. All humic derivatives exhibited a large bioactivity compared to original HS, both KMnO(4)-oxidized and methylated materials being the most effective. Whereas no general relationship was found between bioactivity and humic molecular sizes, the hydrophobicity index was significantly related with proton pump stimulation. It is suggested that the hydrophobic domain can preserve bioactive molecules such as auxins in the humic matter. In contact with root-exuded organic acids the hydrophobic weak forces could be disrupted, releasing bioactive compounds from humic aggregates. These findings were further supported by the fact that HS and all derivatives used in this study activated the auxin synthetic reporter DR5::GUS.",M1
20232336,"Platycodin d improves the immunogenicity of newcastle disease virus-based recombinant avian influenza vaccine in mice.The development of an effective influenza vaccine is urgently important for controlling outbreaks of the highly pathogenic avian influenza virus (HPAIV) and reducing the impact of pandemics. The use of an adjuvant in such a vaccine can significantly contribute to improve the immunogenicity. To explore a novel and safe adjuvant for improving the potency of influenza vaccines, platycodin D (1), a saponin from the <e>root</e> of Platycodon grandiflorum, was evaluated for the adjuvant potentials on the specific cellular and humoral immune responses to Newcastle disease virus-based recombinant avian influenza vaccine (rL-H5) in mice. Compound 1 significantly promoted the concanavalin A (Con A)-, the lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-, and the antigen-induced splenocyte proliferation and enhanced the serum antigen-specific IgG, IgG1, IgG2a, and IgG2b antibody titers (P&lt;0.05, P&lt;0.01, or P&lt;0.001) in mice immunized with rL-H5. The mRNA expressions of Th1/Th2 cytokines (IFN-gamma and IL-10) and transcription factors (T-bet and GATA-3) in splenocytes were also markedly up-regulated by 1, compared with the control group immunized with rL-H5 alone (P&lt;0.01 or P&lt;0.001). In addition, 1 remarkably increased the killing activities of natural killer (NK) cells from splenocytes in the immunized mice (P&lt;0.05), which may have important implications for the vaccination against the avian influenza virus. We concluded that 1 could improve the immunogenicity of the rL-H5 vaccine by enhancing both humoral and cellular immune responses in mice, and that 1 is a promising adjuvant for influenza vaccines.",M1
20230881,"Molecular mechanism of endothelial nitric-oxide synthase activation by Platycodon grandiflorum <e>root</e>-derived saponins.Nitric oxide (NO) produced by endothelial nitric-oxide synthase (eNOS) has antithrombotic and antiatherosclerotic properties in the vasculature. Previously, we demonstrated that saponins derived from the roots of Platycodon grandiflorum (CKS) inhibited the tumor necrosis factor-alpha-induced expression of adhesion molecules in human endothelial cells. In this study, we found that CKS increased eNOS phosphorylation and NO production in human endothelial cells. Treatment with CKS increased the phosphorylation of Akt, p38/MAPK, AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), and calmodulin-dependent protein kinase II (CaMK II) leading to increased NO production in human endothelial cells. Moreover, inhibitors of Akt (LY294002), p38/MAPK (SB203580), AMPK (compound C), and CaMK II (W7) failed to suppress CKS-induced eNOS phosphorylation. In addition, CKS-induced eNOS phosphorylation was inhibited by the overexpression of a dominant-negative mutant form of AMPK (DN-AMPK). Taken together, these results indicate that CKS stimulates eNOS phosphorylation and NO production via the activation of PI3K/Akt, p38/MAPK, AMPK, and CaMK II.",M1
20230752,"Arabidopsis regeneration from multiple tissues occurs via a <e>root</e> development pathway.Unlike most animal cells, plant cells can easily regenerate new tissues from a wide variety of organs when properly cultured. The common elements that provide varied plant cells with their remarkable regeneration ability are still largely unknown. Here we describe the initial process of Arabidopsis in vitro regeneration, where a pluripotent cell mass termed callus is induced. We demonstrate that callus resembles the tip of a root meristem, even if it is derived from aerial organs such as petals, which clearly shows that callus formation is not a simple reprogramming process backward to an undifferentiated state as widely believed. Furthermore, callus formation in roots, cotyledons, and petals is blocked in mutant plants incapable of lateral root initiation. It thus appears that the ectopic activation of a lateral root development program is a common mechanism in callus formation from multiple organs.",M1
20228245,"High-affinity manganese uptake by the metal transporter NRAMP1 is essential for Arabidopsis growth in low manganese conditions.In contrast with many other essential metals, the mechanisms of Mn acquisition in higher eukaryotes are seldom studied and poorly understood. We show here that Arabidopsis thaliana relies on a high-affinity uptake system to acquire Mn from the soil in conditions of low Mn availability and that this activity is catalyzed by the divalent metal transporter NRAMP1 (for Natural Resistance Associated Macrophage Protein 1). The nramp1-1 loss-of-function mutant grows poorly, contains less Mn than the wild type, and fails to take up Mn in conditions of Mn limitation, thus demonstrating that NRAMP1 is the major high-affinity Mn transporter in Arabidopsis. Based on confocal microscopy observation of an NRAMP1-green fluorescent protein fusion, we established that NRAMP1 is localized to the plasma membrane. Consistent with its function in Mn acquisition from the soil, NRAMP1 expression is restricted to the <e>root</e> and stimulated by Mn deficiency. Finally, we show that NRAMP1 restores the capacity of the iron-regulated transporter1 mutant to take up iron and cobalt, indicating that NRAMP1 has a broad selectivity in vivo. The role of transporters of the NRAMP family is well established in higher eukaryotes for iron but has been controversial for Mn. This study demonstrates that NRAMP1 is a physiological manganese transporter in Arabidopsis.",M1
20226871,"Identification of in planta-expressed arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal proteins upon comparison of the <e>root</e> proteomes of Medicago truncatula colonised with two Glomus species.In the absence of sequenced genomes for arbuscular mycorrhizal (AM) fungi, their obligatory biotrophy makes their intra-radical biology especially recalcitrant to functional analyses. Because tandem mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables fungal gene product identifications in phyla lacking genomic information, we have compared as a way to enlarge the coverage of in planta expressed-mycorrhiza-related proteins, the root proteome responses of Medicago truncatula upon colonisation with two AM fungi, Glomus mosseae and G. intraradices, using two-dimensional electrophoresis. In contrast to phosphate fertilization, mycorrhization led to specific changes in the abundance of 99 spots, including 42 overlapping modifications between G. mosseae- and G. intraradices-colonised roots. The 32 confident identifications that could be retrieved following tandem mass spectrometry encompassed 21 fungal proteins whose homology-inferred functions were found to complement the working models so far proposed for the intra-radical functioning of AM fungi with regard to carbon utilization, energy generation, redox homeostasis and protein turnover-related processes.",M1
20226165,"Celastrol: Molecular targets of Thunder God Vine.Celastrol, a quinone methide triterpene, is a pharmacologically active compound present in Thunder God Vine <e>root</e> extracts used as a remedy of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis. Celastrol is one of the most promising medicinal molecules isolated from the plant extracts of traditional medicines. Molecular studies have identified several molecular targets which are mostly centered on the inhibition of IKK-NF-kappaB signaling. Celastrol (i) inhibits directly the IKKalpha and beta kinases, (ii) inactivates the Cdc37 and p23 proteins which are co-chaperones of HSP90, (iii) inhibits the function of proteasomes, and (iv) activates the HSF1 and subsequently triggers the heat shock response. It seems that the quinone methide structure present in celastrol can react with the thiol groups of cysteine residues, forming covalent protein adducts. In laboratory experiments, celastrol has proved to be a potent inhibitor of inflammatory responses and cancer formation as well as alleviating diseases of proteostasis deficiency. Celastrol needs still to pass several hurdles, e.g. ADMET assays, before it can enter the armoury of western drugs.",M1
20224946,"Boron toxicity is alleviated by hydrogen sulfide in cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) seedlings.Boron (B) is an essential micronutrient for plants, which when occurs in excess in the growth medium, becomes toxic to plants. Rapid inhibition of <e>root</e> elongation is one of the most distinct symptoms of B toxicity. Hydrogen sulfide (H(2)S) is emerging as a potential messenger molecule involved in modulation of physiological processes in plants. In the present study, we investigated the role of H(2)S in B toxicity in cucumber (Cucumis sativus) seedlings. Root elongation was significantly inhibited by exposure of cucumber seedlings to solutions containing 5 mM B. The inhibitory effect of B on root elongation was substantially alleviated by treatment with H(2)S donor sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS). There was an increase in the activity of pectin methylesterase (PME) and up-regulated expression of genes encoding PME (CsPME) and expansin (CsExp) on exposure to high B concentration. The increase in PME activity and up-regulation of expression of CsPME and CsExp induced by high B concentration were markedly reduced in the presence of H(2)S donor. There was a rapid increase in soluble B concentrations in roots on exposure to high concentration B solutions. Treatment with H(2)S donor led to a transient reduction in soluble B concentration in roots such that no differences in soluble B concentrations in roots in the absence and presence of NaHS were found after 8 h exposure to the high concentration B solutions. These findings suggest that increases in activities of PME and expansin may underlie the inhibition of root elongation by toxic B, and that H(2)S plays an ameliorative role in protection of plants from B toxicity by counteracting B-induced up-regulation of cell wall-associated proteins of PME and expansins.",M1
20223061,"Development of a non-scanning vibrational sum-frequency generation detected infrared super-resolution microscope and its application to biological cells.We report single-cell infrared (IR) imaging of onion (Allium cepa) <e>root</e> cells using an IR super-resolution microscope based on vibrational sum-frequency generation (VSFG). The resolution of recorded IR images was less than 2 microm and IR super-resolution was achieved by virtue of the VSFG detection. In addition, IR spectra measurements were successfully performed on distinct intra-cellular assemblies. The IR absorption intensity of the cell nuclear edge and the nucleolus in the 3055-3130 cm(-1) region was stronger than that from the cytoplasmic part. This is because the cell nucleus and nucleolus contain larger amounts of nucleic acid. Thus, the obtained IR spectra reflect differences in chemical composition among different cellular structures. In addition, the ability of our novel IR super-resolution microscope to obtain distinct information on both VSFG and two-photon fluorescence is demonstrated.",M1
20222410,"[Absorption and distribution of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium in Chrysanthemum morifolium]OBJECTIVE: To study Chrysanthemum morifolium dry matter accumulation and absorption characteristics of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium at different growth stages. METHOD: Through the field experiment and the sampling analysis, the absorbing capacity of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium as well as the growth of plant at different growth stages in Ch. morifolium were analyzed. RESULT: The dry matter accumulation reached 70.4% of the total accumulation within 60-150 days after transplantation. Dry matter mainly distributed in leaf within 60 days after transplantation, the distribution ratio in the stem was higher than that in leaf within 60-150 days after transplantation, the highest distribution ratio was the flower, and the second was the <e>root</e> within 150-210 days after transplantation. The accumulative capacity of N, P and K by Ch. morifolium was lower within 45 days after transplantation, which only accounted for 16.14%, 13.39% and 10.19% of total absorptive capacity, respectively. But it increased rapidly within 45-150 days after transplantation, which accounted for 71.86%, 63.81% and 62.94% respectively. The nitrogen accumulation was slower, while the accumulation of phosphorus and potassium was increased rapidly, within 150-210 days after transplantation. The distribution ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was different within different organs in different growth stages. The distribution ratio of nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium was mainly distributed in stem and leaf, within 150 days after transplantation, then transferring to the flower and root, the transferring efficiency was N &gt; P &gt; K. CONCLUSION: the absorption capacity of K was the highest, followed by N and P. The N : P205 : K2O ratio was 1 : 0.88 : 1.58. Correlation analysis showed that dry matter accumulation and nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium accumulation correlated positively. For producing 1g dry matter, Ch. morifolium needed to absorb 5.198 1 mg N, 4.329 5 mg P205 and 7.138 5 mg K20 from soil and fertilizer.",M1

20220754,"MONOPTEROS controls embryonic <e>root</e> initiation by regulating a mobile transcription factor.Acquisition of cell identity in plants relies strongly on positional information, hence cell-cell communication and inductive signalling are instrumental for developmental patterning. During Arabidopsis embryogenesis, an extra-embryonic cell is specified to become the founder cell of the primary root meristem, hypophysis, in response to signals from adjacent embryonic cells. The auxin-dependent transcription factor MONOPTEROS (MP) drives hypophysis specification by promoting transport of the hormone auxin from the embryo to the hypophysis precursor. However, auxin accumulation is not sufficient for hypophysis specification, indicating that additional MP-dependent signals are required. Here we describe the microarray-based isolation of MP target genes that mediate signalling from embryo to hypophysis. Of three direct transcriptional target genes, TARGET OF MP 5 (TMO5) and TMO7 encode basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors that are expressed in the hypophysis-adjacent embryo cells, and are required and partially sufficient for MP-dependent root initiation. Importantly, the small TMO7 transcription factor moves from its site of synthesis in the embryo to the hypophysis precursor, thus representing a novel MP-dependent intercellular signal in embryonic root specification.",M1
20219659,"Antitussive and central respiratory depressant effects of Stemona tuberosa.AIMS OF THE STUDY: Stemona alkaloids with distinctly different chemical skeletons are recently reported as the active components in the antitussive herb Baibu derived from the <e>root</e>-tubers of Stemona tuberosa. This study aims to determine if alkaloids of this herb contribute equally to the antitussive functions, act on the same sites of cough reflex, and play any role in inducing central respiratory depressant effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Antitussive potency of four major alkaloids was evaluated on guinea pigs with citric acid aerosol to induce cough. The action sites of the alkaloids on cough reflex pathway were tested with electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve in guinea pigs. The central respiratory effects of croomine were also tested on guinea pigs. RESULTS: Croomine, neotuberostemonine and stemoninine showed similar antitussive potency, while tuberostemonine showed much weaker antitussive potency. Neotuberostemonine, tuberostemonine and stemoninine acted on the peripheral cough reflex pathway, while croomine acted on the central part. Croomine also showed obvious central respiratory depressant effects. CONCLUSIONS: The four major Stemona alkaloids in Stemona tuberosa do not contribute equally to antitussive potency in guinea pigs. Neotuberostemonine, tuberostemonine and stemoninine target on peripheral cough reflex pathway. Croomine acts on central sites in the cough reflex pathway and demonstrates central respiratory depressant effects, which can partly account for the adverse reactions reported for the herb.",M1

20215588,"Arabidopsis homologs of nucleus- and phragmoplast-localized kinase 2 and 3 and mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 are essential for microtubule organization.A double homozygous recessive mutant in the Arabidopsis thaliana homologs of nucleus- and phragmoplast-localized kinase 2 (ANP2) and 3 (ANP3) genes and a homozygous recessive mutant in the mitogen-activated protein kinase 4 (MPK4) gene of Arabidopsis exhibit deficiencies in the overall microtubule (MT) organization, which result in abnormal cell growth patterns, such as branching of <e>root</e> hairs and swelling of diffusely growing epidermal cells. Genetic, pharmacological, molecular, cytological, and biochemical analyses show that the major underlying mechanism for these phenotypes is excessive MT stabilization manifested in both mutants as heavy MT bundling, disorientation, and drug stability. The above defects in MAPK signaling result in the adverse regulation of members of the microtubule-associated protein (MAP65) protein family, including strongly diminished phosphorylation of MAP65-1. These data suggest that ANP2/ANP3, MPK4, and the microtubule-associated protein MAP65-1, a putative target of MPK4 signaling, are all essential for the proper organization of cortical microtubules in Arabidopsis epidermal cells.",M1
20214631,"Analysis of the metabolites in apical area of Allium cepa <e>roots</e> by high resolution NMR spectroscopy method.Elucidation of the molecular mechanisms determining the formation of various tissues and organs is one of the central problems of cell biology. High-resolution NMR spectroscopy was applied for the analysis of the metabolites produced at the various areas of the apical part of the onion Allium cepa roots. To this end, three samples were extracted from the root apex (the root cap, the meristem region and the cell elongation zone). These samples were noticeably different in the number of mitoses and the sets of metabolites. Furthermore, the complete stasis of the plant roots and tops growth was registered in heavy water. Comparison of the morphological and NMR data revealed their perfect agreement with the cellular processes occurring in the root apex. The root cap sample was characterized by the greatest mitotic activity reflected in the great variability of the chemical compounds extracted from this area, the high level of energy consumption, and the increased synthesis of the phosphocholines needed for the cell fission. Sample containing the cell elongation zone possessed the high sugar content, which is required for the cell-wall growth. Therefore, our data show that high-resolution NMR spectroscopy can be used for the identification of chemical compounds in the various regions of the onion root apical area.",M1
20214380,"Evaluating western corn rootworm (Coleoptera: Chrysomelidae) emergence and <e>root</e> damage in a seed mix refuge.Resistance management is essential for maintaining the efficacy and long-term durability of transgenic corn engineered to control western corn rootworm (Diabrotica virgifera virgifera Le Conte). Theoretically, a refuge can be provided by growing susceptible (refuge) plants in either a separate section of the field adjacent to resistant (transgenic) plants, or as a seed mixture. We examined the effects of varying the structure of a 10 and 20% refuge between currently approved structured refuges (block or strip plantings), as well as deploying the refuge within a seed mix, on adult emergence timing and magnitude, root damage and yield. Our 2-yr field study used naturally occurring western corn rootworm populations and included seven treatments: 10 and 20% block refuge, 10 and 20% strip refuge, 10 and 20% seed mix refuge, and 100% refuge. Beetles emerging from refuge corn emerged more synchronously with those emerging from transgenic (Bacillus thuringiensis [Berliner] Bt-RW) corn in seed mix refuges when compared with block refuges. The proportion of beetles emerging from refuge plants was significantly greater in a block and strip refuge structure than in a seed mix refuge. More beetles emerged from Bt-RW corn plants when they were grown as part of a seed mix. We discuss the potential benefits and drawbacks of a seed mix refuge structure in light of these findings.",M1
20213576,"Methodological evaluation of 2-DE to study <e>root</e> proteomics during nematode infection in cotton and coffee plants.The identification of plant proteins expressed in response to phytopathogens is a remaining challenge to proteome methodology. Proteomic methods, such as electrophoresis and mass spectrometry have been extensively used for protein differential expression studies in several plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, rice, and wheat. However, in coffee (Coffea canephora) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum), bidimensional electrophoresis (2-DE) analysis has been rarely employed. Moreover, global protein expression in both agricultural plants in response to biotic stress conditions had not been reported until now. In this study, Meloidogyne paranaensis and M. incognita, two devastating phytonematodes for numerous crop cultures, were used to infect resistant genotypes of coffee and cotton plants. The protein expression of infected- and non-infected roots were evaluated by 2-DE following in silico experiments. Additionally, gels were stained with silver nitrate and/or Coomassie brilliant blue in order to obtain an optimized method for proteomic analysis of plant-nematode interaction. The 2-DE analysis revealed an enhanced number of protein spots, as well as differentially expressed proteins, when Coomassie brilliant blue was used. The results obtained here could be extended to other plant species, providing valuable information to root-nematode interactions.",M1

METHOD: The shapes and properties, the characters of transverse section, the powder and disintegrated tissue of <e>roots</e> of medical materials were compared by microscopic measuring. RESULT: Wild Radix Saposhnikovia had a long conical or cylindrical root, and fewer root branches. It showed a close annulus grain on top root, cortical section of root in light brown colour, many brown oil spots and possessed typical odor, While cultivated Radix Saposhnikovia had many root branches, and showed less annulus grain on top root, cortical section of root in light yellow brown colour, less brown oil spots and possessed light odor. The difference of microscopic histological structure was that wild Radix Saposhnikovia had phloem transverse section of root with many rotundity oil tube lining up 10-22 rings, xylem vessel with radiate rank, and indistinct annual ring. While cultivated Radix Saposhnikovia had phloem transverse section of root with oil tube lining up 10-11 rings and xylem vessel with distinct annual ring. CONCLUSION: There exists several differences between wild and cultivated Radix Saposhnikovia in shapes and properties and differences of microscopic frameworks. The main characteristics are the differences of shapes and numbers of oil tube of phloem transverse section of root. The cultivated Radix Saposhnikovia of 1-4 years can be recognized by annual rings of xylem vessel.",M1

20205539,"Identification, characterization, and expression analyses of class II and IV chitinase genes from Douglas-fir seedlings infected by Phellinus sulphurascens.Laminated <e>root</e> rot (LRR) disease, caused by the fungus Phellinus sulphurascens, is a major threat to coastal Douglas-fir (DF) (Pseudotsuga menziesii) forests in western North America. Understanding host-pathogen interactions of this pathosystem is essential to manage this important conifer root disease. Our research objectives were to identify DF pathogenesis-related (PR) genes and analyze their expression patterns over the course of infection. We constructed a cDNA library of Phellinus sulphurascens-infected DF seedling roots and sequenced a total of 3,600 random cDNA clones from this library. One of the largest groups of identified genes (203 cDNA clones) matched with chitinase genes reported in other plant species. We identified at least three class II and six class IV chitinase genes from DF seedlings. Quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction analyses showed significant differential expression patterns locally in root tissues and systemically in needle tissues after fungal invasion. Nonetheless, there was a common trend in gene expression patterns for most of the chitinase genes: an upregulation within 12 h of pathogen inoculation followed by down-regulation within 2 to 3 days postinoculation (dpi), and then further upregulation within 5 to 7 dpi. Western immunoblot data showed differential accumulation of class IV chitinases in Phellinus sulphurascens-infected DF seedlings. Further detailed functional analyses will help us to understand the specific role of DF chitinases in defense against Phellinus sulphurascens infection.",M1

20434040,"Evaluation of <e>root</e> and canal systems of mandibular first molars in Taiwanese individuals using cone-beam computed tomography.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) can provide valuable data for root canal systems of human teeth. This study used CBCT to evaluate the number of roots and canals in mandibular first molars in Taiwanese individuals. METHODS: We screened 151 patients (76 male and 75 female) scheduled for CBCT scan prior to implantation, or orthodontic, endodontic, or periodontic treatment between June 2006 and March 2009 at the Department of Dentistry, Cardinal Tien Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan. A total of 237 image samples of mandibular first molars were obtained and analyzed for their number of roots and canals. RESULTS: We found that 177 (74.7%) mandibular first molars had two roots and 60 (25.3%) had three roots. Of the 237 teeth, 133 (56.1%) had three canals, 96 (40.5%) had four, and eight (3.4%) had two canals. Of the 86 patients (43 male and 43 female) with bilateral mandibular first molars, 22 (25.6%, 15 male and 7 female) had bilateral three-rooted mandibular first molars, and six (7.0%, 4 male and 2 female) had unilateral three-rooted mandibular first molars. The chi(2) test showed a significantly higher incidence of three-rooted mandibular first molars in male (44.2%, 19/43) than in female (20.9%, 9/43, p = 0.038) subjects. CONCLUSION: Our results showed a high overall incidence (32.6%) of three-rooted mandibular first molars in Taiwanese individuals. CBCT could be a valuable tool for identifying an extra distolingual root in mandibular first molars.",M2
20416444,"Temperature changes accompanying near infrared diode laser endodontic treatment of wet canals.INTRODUCTION: Diode laser endodontic treatments such as disinfection or the generation of cavitations should not cause deleterious thermal changes in radicular dentin. METHODS: This study assessed thermal changes in the <e>root</e> canal and on the root surface when using 940 and 980 nm lasers at settings of 4 W/10 Hz and 2.5 W/25 Hz, respectively, delivered into 2000-mum fibers to generate cavitations in water. The root surface temperature in the apical third was recorded, as was the water temperature in coronal, middle, and apical third regions, by using thermocouples placed inside the canal. Lasing was undertaken with either rest periods or rinsing between 5-second laser exposures. RESULTS: Both diode lasers induced only modest temperature changes on the external root surface at the settings used. Even though the temperature of the water within the canal increased during lasing by as much as 30 degrees C, the external root surface temperature increased by only a maximum of 4 degrees C. Irrigation between laser exposures was highly effective in minimizing thermal changes within the root canal and on the root surface. CONCLUSIONS: Diode laser parameters that induce cavitation do not result in adverse thermal changes in radicular dentin.",M2
20416436,"Effect of acidic environment on the push-out bond strength of mineral trioxide aggregate.INTRODUCTION: Reduced surface microhardness and decreased sealing ability have been shown after the placement of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) in an acidic environment. In this study, the effect of an acidic environment on the push-out strength of MTA was evaluated. METHODS: Eighty <e>root</e> dentin slices from freshly extracted single-rooted human teeth were sectioned and their lumen instrumented to achieve a diameter of 1.3 mm. One gram of tooth-colored ProRoot MTA (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Johnson City, TN) was mixed with 0.33 g of distilled water and introduced into the canals of the root-dentin slices and treated with ultrasonic energy. The specimens were then randomly divided into four groups (n = 20) and wrapped in pieces of gauze soaked in phosphate buffer saline solution (pH = 7.4) and butyric acid buffered at pH values of 4.4, 5.4, or 6.4, respectively. They were then incubated for 4 days at 37 degrees C. The push-out bond strengths were then measured using a universal testing machine. The slices were examined under a light microscope at x40 magnification to determine the nature of the bond failure. The data were analyzed using one-way analysis of variance and the Tamhane post hoc test. RESULTS: The greatest mean push-out bond strength (7.28 +/- 2.28 MPa) was observed after exposure to a pH value of 7.4. The values decreased to 2.47 +/- 0.61 MPa after exposure to a pH value of 4.4. There were significant differences between the groups (p &lt; 0.001). Inspection of the samples revealed the bond failure to be predominantly adhesive. CONCLUSION: The force needed for displacement of MTA was significantly lower in samples stored at lower pH values.",M2
20416435,"Efficacy of cone-beam computed tomography as a modality to accurately identify the presence of second mesiobuccal canals in maxillary first and second molars: a pilot study.INTRODUCTION: The achievement of successful nonsurgical endodontic therapy relies on the location, disinfection, and obturation of all canals in the <e>root</e> canal system. This study evaluated the ability of the i-CAT cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) unit (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, PA) to accurately identify the presence or absence of the second mesiobuccal canal (MB2) in maxillary first and maxillary second human molars. METHODS: Twenty completely intact maxillary first and second molars were used as test subjects. The existence of the MB2 canal was evaluated by the following three methods: (1) periapical radiograph evaluation, (2) CBCT evaluation, and (3) clinical sectioning evaluation. The evaluation methods were used to compare the accuracy of CBCT scanning and clinical sectioning (gold standard) in the identification of the MB2 canal. RESULTS: The i-CAT CBCT unit accurately identified the presence or absence of the MB2 canal in 78.95% of samples. Statistical analysis showed that there was no significant difference in the ability of CBCT scanning to detect the MB2 canal when compared with the gold standard of clinical sectioning (p &gt; 0.5). CONCLUSION: The results of this in vitro investigation may be interpreted to show that CBCT scanning is a reliable method to detect the MB2 canal when compared with the gold standard of physical sectioning of the specimen.",M2
20416422,"Prevalence and associated periodontal status of teeth with <e>root</e> perforation: a retrospective study of 2,002 patients' medical records.INTRODUCTION: Various procedures along the course of an endodontic treatment may lead to perforations. The prognosis of perforated teeth depends on perforation location, perforation size, and time from occurrence. The aim of this study was to retrospectively evaluate the prevalence of root perforations and associated pathological changes in the adjacent periodontal tissues. METHODS: Full periapical status surveys and medical records of 2,002 patients with a total of 56,175 teeth were evaluated. RESULTS: Of a total of 5,048 root canal-treated teeth, 116 root perforations were identified in 101 patients. Associated pathological changes in the adjacent periodontal tissues were identified in 81 teeth with perforations. The patient's age, perforation location and size, and tooth type significantly influenced the occurrence of perforation associated periodontal damage. CONCLUSIONS: When a perforation occurs, the main treatment goal is to prevent long-lasting injury to the periodontium. Better knowledge of the prevalence of perforations and their possible predictors may assist the clinician in the prevention and treatment of iatrogenic root perforations.",M2
20416421,"Penetration of sodium hypochlorite into dentin.INTRODUCTION: Sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) is the most commonly used <e>root</e> canal irrigant. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of concentration, time of exposure, and temperature on the penetration of NaOCl into dentinal tubules. METHODS: Thirty extracted human permanent maxillary anterior teeth with single canals were instrumented by using ProTaper rotary files. The teeth were then sectioned perpendicular to the long axis. The crowns and apical thirds of all the teeth were removed. The remaining roots were processed into 4-mm-long blocks and stained overnight in crystal violet. One hundred eight stained blocks were treated by 1%, 2%, 4%, and 6% NaOCl for 2, 5, and 20 minutes at 20 degrees C, 37 degrees C, and 45 degrees C, respectively. The depth of penetration of NaOCl was determined by bleaching of the stain and measured by light microscopy at magnifications of 20x and 40x. Statistical comparisons were made by using one-way analysis of variance, and Dunnett T3 tests were made for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: The shortest penetration (77 mum) was measured after incubation with 1% NaOCl for 2 minutes at room temperature. The highest penetration (300 mum) was obtained with 6% NaOCl for 20 minutes at 45 degrees C. After the initial penetration during the first 2 minutes, the depth of penetration doubled during the next 18 minutes of exposure. Temperature had a modest effect within each group on the depth of penetration and in most cases was not statistically significant (P &gt; .05). Depth of penetration increased with increasing hypochlorite concentration, but the differences were small. Within each time group, depth of penetration with 1% NaOCl was about 50%-80% of the values with the 6% solution. CONCLUSIONS: Temperature, time, and concentration all contribute to the penetration of sodium hypochlorite into dentinal tubules.",M2

20381767,"Accuracy of mesiodistal <e>root</e> angulation projected by cone-beam computed tomographic panoramic-like images.INTRODUCTION: In this study, we tested the accuracy of the cone-beam computed tomography panoramic (pan)-like image in the projection of mesiodistal tooth angulations. METHODS: A plastic typodont with 28 teeth in ideal occlusion was fixed in position in a dry human skull for imaging with a NewTom 3G volume scanner (AFP Imaging, Elmsford, NY). Gold standard angular measurements of each tooth were calculated by using a coordinate measuring machine (CMM) (Faro International, Lake Mary, Fla) and compared with the corresponding measurement derived from each CBCT pan-like image. Imaging processing was accomplished with the proprietary software. RESULTS: Statistically significant differences between the CMM and CBCT pan-like image mesiodistal angular projections were found for 16 of the 28 teeth, although only the mean difference and confidence intervals of teeth 22, 12, and 33 (FDI numbering system) were above at the applied tolerance limit of +/-2.5 degrees (3.675 degrees with 95% confidence interval of [3.330 degrees, 4.020 degrees], 2.006 degrees [1.339 degrees, 2.672 degrees] and 2.179 degrees [1.800 degrees, 2.557 degrees], respectively). The maxillary roots with the exception of teeth 16 and 26 were projected with greater distal angulations. The mandibular roots with the exception of teeth 44, 47, and 36 were projected with greater mesial angulations than the CMM gold standard measurement. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with previous studies on the accuracy of conventional pan radiographs, the mesiodistal angular projection of teeth on the CBCT pan-like image is closer to the true mesiodistal angulation. If the practitioner is well acquainted with how the information from the CBCT is processed to create the pan-like image, it can be a useful tool for evaluating mesiodistal root angulations.",M2
20381750,"Accuracy and reliability of tooth and <e>root</e> lengths measured on cone-beam computed tomographs.INTRODUCTION: In this study, we evaluated the accuracy and reliability of tooth-length and root-length measurements derived from cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) volumetric data. METHODS: CBCT scans were made of 7 fresh porcine heads. The scans were made with an i-CAT machine (Imaging Sciences International, Hatfield, Pa) at 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4 mm voxel sizes. Two film-acquired periapical radiographs were also taken of selected incisors and premolars, 52 of which (28 premolars, 24 incisors) were included in this study. By using Dolphin imaging software (version 10.5, Dolphin Imaging Systems, Chatsworth, Calif), the CBCT scans were oriented twice for each tooth (ie, 2 trials) using the mesial, distal, labial, and lingual cementoenamel junctions as reference points. Root and tooth lengths were derived from these points and compared with actual measurements of the teeth made with digital calipers after all surrounding bone had been carefully removed. RESULTS: CBCT tooth-length and root-length measurements were not significantly different from the actual lengths; the mean differences were less than 0.3 mm. The periapical measurements significantly (P = 0.001) underestimated root lengths (mean difference, 2.58 mm) and overestimated tooth lengths (mean difference, 2.58 mm; P = 0.056). Mean differences between the 3 CBCT voxel sizes were all less than 0.25 mm. Within-trial method errors were almost 2 times greater for the periapical radiographs than for the CBCT scans. Between-trial method errors were greatest for the 0.4-mm CBCT scans, which were within 0.1 mm of the periapical radiograph method errors. The intraclass correlations for the periapical and CBCT measurements were all above 0.995. CONCLUSIONS: CBCT scans are at least as accurate and reliable as periapical radiographs for tooth-length and root-length determinations.",M2

20362906,"Repair of <e>root</e> resorption 2 to 16 weeks after the application of continuous forces on maxillary first molars in rats: a 2- and 3-dimensional quantitative evaluation.INTRODUCTION: Root resorption is a side effect of orthodontic treatment that occurs with the removal of hyalinized tissue. Studies have shown that a reparative process in the periodontium begins when the applied orthodontic force is discontinued or reduced below a certain level. However, quantitative 3-dimensional evaluation of root resorption repair has not been done. The aim of this study was to quantitatively assess the 2- and 3-dimensional changes of root resorption craters after 2 weeks of continuous mesially applied orthodontic forces of 50 g on rat molars and 2- to 16-week retention periods. METHODS: We used 60 male Wistar rats (10 weeks old). Nickel-titanium closed-coil springs were used to apply 50-g mesial forces for 2 weeks to move the maxillary left first molars. The rats were randomly allocated to 6 groups. Those in the zero-week retention group were killed after force application. In the remaining 5 groups, the interdental spaces between the maxillary first and second molars were filled with resin to retain the molars. The molars were extracted after periods of retention from 2 and 16 weeks. The maxillary right molars were used as the controls. Mesial and distal roots (distobuccal and distopalatal) were examined by using scanning electron and 3-dimensional scanning laser microscopes. The surface area, depth, volume, and roughness of the root resorption craters were measured. RESULTS: The area, depth, and volume of the craters decreased gradually and showed similar trends over the retention time, approaching a plateau at the 12th week. After 16 weeks of retention, the volumes of the resorption craters of the distobuccal and distopalatal roots reached recovery peaks of 69.5% and 66.7%, respectively. Small pits on the mesial roots showed recovery of 62.5% at the 12th week. The healing patterns in distal roots with severe resorption and mesial roots with shallow resorption had no significant differences. CONCLUSIONS: The resorption and repair processes during the early stages of retention are balanced, and most of the reparative process occurs after 4 weeks of passive retention after the application of orthodontic force. Frequent orthodontic reactivations should be avoided to allow recovery and repair of root surface damage.",M2
20348486,"Can fiber posts increase <e>root</e> stresses and reduce fracture?The clinical success of fiber posts has been attributed to their lower elastic modulus. The tested hypothesis was that fiber posts could lead to lower risk of post debonding and lower risk of root fracture, despite an increase in root stresses. Stress analyses were carried out with a 3D finite element model of a premolar restored with a metallic or a fiber post. Bonded and non-bonded post/cement interface conditions were simulated. We calculated risk-of-fracture indices by determining the highest principal stress values divided by the tensile strength. Shear stresses along the post/cement interface were analyzed for the bonded models. Compared with the premolar restored with a metallic post, the fiber post generated lower stresses along the interface and higher stresses in the root. However, with the fiber post, fracture was less likely to occur in the root, since its core and post fracture indices were higher.",M2

It can be localized in the crown, between the crown and the root, or, most frequently, in the root. This report describes a horizontally unerupted maxillary central incisor with distoangular root dilacerations most likely caused by a traumatic dental injury to its primary predecessor. METHODS: Surgical-orthodontic traction was applied after the redistribution of the space in the anterior maxillary region. RESULTS: Root dilaceration of the tractioned tooth was evident and did not allow the alignment of the tooth into proper position in the dental arch. Root canal filling and apicoectomy were performed.

METHODS: Eighty-four roots of extracted human molars with curvatures measuring 40 degrees to 80 degrees were used. The roots were randomly assigned into four groups based on the rotary instrumentation system: group 1, ProFile (.04 taper); group 2, EndoSequence (.04 taper); group 3, Liberator (.04 taper); and group 4, Liberator (.02 taper). RESULTS: File distortion was 19.4%, 10%, 44.4%, and 59.1% for the ProFile, EndoSequence, and Liberator .04 and Liberator .02 groups, respectively. There were statistically significant differences between the ProFile and Liberator .04 groups (p &lt; 0.05), the ProFile and Liberator .02 groups (p &lt; 0.01), the EndoSequence and Liberator .04 groups (p &lt; 0.01), and the EndoSequence and Liberator .02 groups (p &lt; 0.01). Broken files occurred in 2.8% of the ProFile group and 7.4% of the Liberator .04 group. There were no broken files in the EndoSequence or Liberator .02 groups.

After these treatments, 15 samples of each group received a blood drop and were analyzed by SEM. The remaining 15 had their surface morphology evaluated for collagen fibrils exposure by SEM. Photomicrographs were analyzed according to the score of adhesion of blood components. Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn multiple comparison tests were employed. RESULTS: The control group was characterized by the absence of blood elements on the surface. The best result was observed in the citric acid group, which had a dense fibrin network with blood elements adhered. The EDTA group showed a moderate fibrin network formation. In contrast, a scarce fibrin network and a few cells were present in the tetracycline samples, and an absence of blood elements was found on sodium citrate specimens. The citric acid group was statistically different from the control group (P &lt; .01). No differences were found among the control, EDTA, tetracycline, and sodium citrate groups (P &gt; .05). CONCLUSION: Under these experimental conditions, citric acid is indicated to stabilize clots on the root surface, which act as a scaffold for connective tissue cell development.",M2
20303900,"[Measurement of mesiodistal <e>root</e> angulation for panoramic images and the effect of buccolingual root angulation]Panoramic images were taken from an anatomically correct phantom with three different buccolingual angulations for each tooth (Original, 10 degrees buccal root torque, and 10 degrees lingual root torque). The true mesiodistal angulation of each tooth was determined with a three-dimensional coordinate measurement machine. Each tooth had at least one angle measurement that was statistically different from the other mesiodistal angles with different buccolingual orientations. Roots with buccal root orientations were projected more distally than they were in reality; and the roots lingually positioned were projected more mesially. The canine and premolars in both arches were most affected and the phenomenon was more pronounced in the maxilla than the mandible. Buccolingual orientation changes did not affect the root angulation expression on the incisor area.",M2

METHODS: The study population consisted of 126 children. Stages C to H of the Demirjian classification were used to classify the dental development of the adjacent incisors. Associations were sought between the complications and the developmental stage of the adjacent maxillary incisors at the time of surgical removal. Tests of association were carried out using Fisher's exact test with a probability level of P=.05 for statistical significance. RESULTS: Significant differences were evident: for mature maxillary central incisors (N=170); between all the proportions for <e>root</e> resorption, with the greatest difference being between stages E and H (P&lt;.001); for arrested root development between stages D and E (P=.013), and D and H (P=.02); and for persistent malocclusion between stages E and G (P=.004), E and H (P=.02), F and G (P=.005), and F and H (P=.01).

A retrospective study.The purpose of the present retrospective study was to evaluate the post-traumatic healing of the pulp and periodontium of 32 permanent teeth with horizontal root fractures. Twenty-nine patients, 8-48 years old, who presented at our department with a root fracture between January 2001 and April 2007, participated in the study. Root-fractured teeth with a loosened or dislocated coronal fragment were repositioned and splinted for 14-49 days (average: 34 days). In cases of severe dislocation of the coronal fragment, prophylactic endodontic treatment was performed. Follow-up examinations were conducted routinely after 1,2,3,6, and 12 months. For this study, follow-up took place for up to 7 years post trauma. Of 32 root-fractured teeth, 29 (91%) survived. 10 teeth (31%) exhibited pulpal healing; 13 teeth (41%) were prophylactically endodontically treated within 2 weeks of injury. At the fracture line, interposition of calcified tissue was evident in 6 teeth (19%), and interposition of granulation tissue was observed in 8 teeth (25%). The prognosis of the root-fractured teeth was good, and one-third of the teeth with root fractures possessed a vital pulp at the final examination.",M2

20225476,"Optimum post and tooth <e>root</e> diameters for a cast post-core system.PURPOSE: To investigate the optimum diameter for the tapered post of a cast alloy post-core system relative to the root diameter, when measured at the root face, that is required to minimize both post and root failures. METHODS: 32 extracted maxillary central incisor teeth were each decoronated perpendicular to the long axis at a point 2.0 mm occlusal to the labial cemento-enamel junction. Following endodontic canal obturation, the teeth were assigned randomly to four equal groups for different diameter tapered post space preparations. Then 1.10, 1.50, 1.70, and 2.00 mm diameter cast Ni-Cr alloy post-cores and complete crowns without ferrules were fabricated. Each root was embedded in a large gypsum stone block and the crown loaded palatally at 135 degrees from the long axis in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 1.0 mm/minute until failure. Results were analyzed using one-way ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer post hoc tests, and Fisher's exact test, with alpha = 0.05 for statistical significance. RESULTS: Mean failure resistance loads were: 0.60, 0.91, 1.00, and 1.38 kN (P &lt; 0.001). All of the 1.10 mm posts failed, without any root fractures. Conversely, none of the 2.00 mm posts failed, but all of the roots fractured. The optimum post to root diameter ratio to minimize failures was approximately 1:4.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: Fifty human mandibular first premolar roots were enlarged to ISO size 20, inoculated with Enterococcus faecalis [ATCC2912] for 72 hours and divided into 5 groups: group I: prepared with .02 taper hand instruments ISO size 40; group II: Profile .04 taper size 40; group III: Profile .06 taper size 40; group IV: ProTaper size F4; and group V (control group) further divided into: Va: with bacterial inoculation and no mechanical instrumentation; and Group Vb: neither bacterial inoculation nor mechanical instrumentation. Cleaning efficacy was evaluated in terms of reduction of colony forming units (CFUs). The VRF strength was evaluated using D11 spreader as wedge in an Instron testing machine. RESULTS: Root canals instrumented with ProTaper and 6% Profile instruments showed maximum reduction in CFUs, with statistically insignificant difference between them. The VRF resistance decreased in all instrumented groups. The difference of VRF between 2% and 4% taper Profile groups was statistically insignificant (P = .195). One-way analysis of variance showed that canals instrumented with ProTaper F4 showed maximum reduction in VRF resistance compared with control uninstrumented group. CONCLUSIONS: Profile 6% taper instruments offer the advantage of maximum debridement without significant reduction in root fracture resistance.",M2

METHOD AND MATERIALS: Extracted human third molars had their crowns sectioned above the CEJ, pulp tissue removed, and cervical root dentin exposed using a high-speed bur (approximately 1 mm in depth of substance loss). From each root fragment, one specimen was prepared. A total of 25 specimens were used and distributed randomly into five groups. The specimens were attached to a hydraulic pressure apparatus to evaluate the alterations of root dentin permeability after exposure to different acids. Dentin permeability was measured after the following sequential steps: (1) treatment with EDTA for 3 minutes to obtain the maximum permeability; (2) root planing to create a smear layer; (3) exposure to different acidic substances for 5 minutes (vinegar, cola drink, lemon juice, white wine, and orange juice); and (4) brushing for 3 minutes. RESULTS: All acidic substances increased dentin permeability after root planing. Lemon juice produced higher values for permeability when compared to the other substances (P = .009); moreover, orange juice showed similar results (P &lt; .02) except when compared to vinegar (P = .12). Brushing right after acid exposure significantly reduced dentin permeability except in the vinegar group (P = .07). CONCLUSION: Under the experimental conditions, dietary acids increased root dentin permeability, and immediate brushing reduced permeability levels.",M2
20197178,"<e>Root</e>-contact evaluation by panoramic radiography and cone-beam computed tomography of super-high resolution.INTRODUCTION: Correct tooth position in the 3 planes of space is a major objective of orthodontic treatment. The aim of this study was to determine whether a panoramic radiograph (OPT) provides a true assessment of the mesiodistal root relationship of adjacent teeth. METHODS: OPTs of 22 patients near the end of treatment with fixed appliances in both arches were taken before debonding. When the roots of adjacent teeth were touching on the OPT, cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) was used to show the true root relationships. RESULTS: We evaluated 235 interdental sites by OPT and CBCT; 47 areas showed contact between adjacent roots in the OPT images. However, the CBCT images showed true contact in only 5 of these areas; ie, 11% of the diagnoses based on OPT images were true positive, whereas the rest (89%) was false positive. One hundred eighty-eight sites showed no contact in the OPT images; this was confirmed by CBCT. CONCLUSIONS: OPT has high sensitivity and relatively high specificity to detect adjacent roots touching each other. Root contacts are overestimated when evaluated by OPT.",M2
20197177,"Severe <e>root</e> resorption in orthodontic patients treated with the edgewise method: prevalence and predictive factors.INTRODUCTION: Our aims in this study were to assess the prevalence of severe root resorption and identify possible associations in orthodontic patients treated with the edgewise method. METHODS: The sample included 1049 patients who had periapical radiographs taken for all incisors before and after treatment. The radiographs were examined by 2 orthodontists using an x-ray viewer with standard light intensity. These variables were collected: root shape, overbite, initial resorption, and hypodontia. The patients were classified according to sex, Angle classification, ethnicity, age, duration of treatment, type of dentition (mixed or permanent), and treatment with or without extraction of 4 premolars. Resorption was considered severe when it affected more than a third of the length of the root. Statistical analysis included the chi-square test and both simple and multiple logistic regression (P &lt; or =0.05). RESULTS: Severe root resorption was observed in 14.5% of the sample. Patients treated with exodontia of the first premolars (odds ratio [95% CI] = 6.38 [4.2-9.7]), those who had triangle-shaped roots at the beginning of treatment (odds ratio [95% CI] = 4.67 [3.1-6.9]), and those with initial root resorption (odds ratio [95% CI] = 4.52 [2.7-7.6]) had a greater chance of developing severe root resorption during orthodontic treatment. CONCLUSIONS: A high prevalence of severe root resorption was observed in Brazilian patients treated with the edgewise method. The main factors directly involved in severe resorption were extraction of first premolars, triangle-shaped roots, and root resorption before treatment.",M2

METHODS: 32 systemically healthy, non-smoking patients, with one Miller Class I or II buccal GR of &gt; or = 3 mm, were treated with a LPF. At baseline the following measurements were recorded: (1) recession depth; (2) probing depth; (3) clinical attachment level; and (4) width of keratinized tissue. At 24 months post-surgery, all clinical measurements were repeated. RESULTS: Mean <e>root</e> coverage obtained with the laterally positioned flaps was 93.8%. Complete root coverage was obtained in 62.5% of the recipient sites. The mean recession depth decreased from 4.71 +/- 1.30 mm to 0.28 +/- 0.42 mm. Statistically significant improvements were found for all clinical parameters from baseline to 24 months (P &lt; 0.05). Patients with maxillary recessions recorded statistically superior gains in the width of keratinized tissue than patients with mandibular recessions. The results of the present study demonstrated that the LPF is an effective procedure to cover localized gingival recession. Moreover, both groups (i.e., patients with maxillary or mandibular recessions) recorded similar significant improvements from baseline to 24-month examination, except for the width of keratinized tissue which was statistically higher for maxillary recessions.",M2
20171360,"Fracture necrosis: diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and treatment recommendations.INTRODUCTION: The presence of cracks and fractures in teeth can pose difficulties in diagnosis, prognosis assessment, and treatment recommendations. When a tooth has no significant restorations or caries, whereby the pulp is nonvital in the absence of a luxation injury, it is suggested that this necrosis is likely caused by a significant longitudinal crack that extends from the occlusal surface and into the pulp. This type of presentation has been termed  fracture necrosis.  METHODS: Twenty-seven teeth with nonvital pulps were evaluated that had no restorations or minimally deep restorations and no signs of caries. These teeth were extracted and evaluated as to the depth and location of any potential fracture. RESULTS: All evaluated teeth were found to have cracks that extended from the occlusal surface into the pulp and progressed to an external <e>root</e> surface. CONCLUSION: Pulp necrosis, in the absence of restorations, caries, or luxation injuries, is likely caused by a longitudinal fracture extending from the occlusal surface and into the pulp. Based on the available literature, these types of teeth may have a poor prognosis after endodontic treatment, with the potential ramification of extensive periodontal and/or periapical bone loss. Extraction may be considered as the primary treatment option.",M2

20162984,"[Electronic Apex Locator as a dental instrument]Electronic Apex Locators (EAL) have become widely used in the last decade. The first apex locator was introduced in 1962, based on a constant electrical resistance (6.5 K.) between the oral mucosa and periodontal ligament. The first and second generations of EAL were inaccurate and could not detect the apex in the presence of conducting fluids. The third generation solved this problem by using two alternating frequencies and calculating the impedance between them. This provided reliable and accurate results in dry canals, or in the presence of blood, electrolytes or other fluid in the <e>root</e> canals, when the pulp was necrotic or when there was a perforation along the root. The Root ZX and Apit (Endex) are the most documented devices.

Several of the newer EALs are smaller, and others connect to computers.",M2
20158533,"Vertical fracture of <e>root</e> filled teeth restored with posts: the effects of patient age and dentine thickness.AIM: To determine whether patient age contributed to the fracture resistance of teeth subjected to root canal treatment and post placement. METHODOLOGY: Forty-five single-rooted, single-canal human teeth were mounted, instrumented, obturated and prepared for a post. The teeth were divided into young (18 &lt; or = age &lt; or = 35) and old (60 &lt; or = age) groups and subjected to cyclic loading until fracture; those reaching 200,000 cycles without undergoing failure were then subjected to static loading to fracture. Statistical differences between groups were examined using one-way anovas, and correlations were identified using Pearson's r; significance was established at P &lt; or = 0.05. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between the two age groups in terms of the number of cycles to fracture (P &gt; 0.05) or the load to fracture (P &gt; 0.05). However, there was a significant correlation (P &lt; or = 0.05) between the root fracture resistance and individual age, indicating that the susceptibility to root fracture increases significantly with increasing patient age. Also, the dentine thickness of roots that fractured was significantly less than those that did not (P = 0.04). CONCLUSION: Vertical root fracture of teeth receiving root canal treatment with posts is more likely to occur in the teeth of older patients (60+) and particularly in those with low dentine thickness.",M2
20158530,"The effect of irrigation time, <e>root</e> morphology and dentine thickness on tooth surface strain when using 5% sodium hypochlorite and 17% EDTA.AIM: To evaluate the effect of irrigation with 5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) alone and in conjunction with 17% ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) on tooth surface strain (TSS) and to analyse the influence of irrigation time, root morphology and dentine thickness. METHODOLOGY: Thirty-six single-rooted pre-molars with single canals had their crown and enamel reduced and root canals prepared using a standardized protocol. Teeth were grouped according to anatomical criteria and randomly distributed to experimental irrigation groups: (A) saline (negative control); (B) 5% NaOCl (positive control); (C) 5% NaOCl alternated with 17% EDTA. TSS was measured using electrical strain gauges bonded to the cervico-proximal part of the tooth. Teeth, mounted in clear acrylic resin placed in a universal testing machine, were subjected to nine consecutive 10-min irrigation periods followed by non-destructive occlusal loading to record TSS. Statistical analysis was carried out using two-way hierarchical anova and post hoc multiple comparisons. RESULTS: Two groups showed an increase in TSS from the baseline (initial 10-min irrigation with saline). Group A showed a negligible reduction of 1.2% (343-339 muepsilon), which was not statistically significant (P = 0.7). Group B showed a highly significant (P = 0.001) increase in TSS by 53.7% (178-253 muepsilon), and group C showed a significant (P = 0.02) increase in TSS by 17.4% (163-192 muepsilon). The rate of change in TSS was significantly different between test groups. The length of the tooth (P = 0.04) as well as the mesio-distal (P = 0.05) width had significant effects on TSS. CONCLUSIONS: Irrigation with 5% with or without 17% EDTA increased TSS. The increase was significantly greater with 5% NaOCl alone than with 5% NaOCl alternated with 17% EDTA in contrast to previous findings with longer duration of irrigant exposure. Tooth length and mesio-distal root width significantly contributed to the increase in TSS.",M2
20152675,"Proper mesiodistal angles for microimplant placement assessed with 3-dimensional computed tomography images.INTRODUCTION: To provide information about placement sites and angulations of microimplants between tooth <e>roots</e>, we analyzed 3-dimensional computed tomography images from 25 patients. METHODS: The patients in the sample had good interdigitation, no restorations, and no arch length discrepancies in the posterior segments. Three-dimensional images of the maxillary and mandibular second premolars, first molars, and second molars were constructed. The distances and midpoints between the roots at 3 levels were calculated, and the angles between the lines connecting the midpoints and perpendicular lines to the occlusal plane at the contact points were also calculated. RESULTS: The midpoints between the roots were located distally to the contact point and from the cervical to the apical areas. The lines connecting these midpoints from the cervix to the apex of the roots in the mandibular arch had more distal inclination than in the maxillary arch. CONCLUSIONS: To minimize root contacts, microimplants need to be inclined distally about 10 degrees to 20 degrees and placed 0.5 to 2.7 mm distally to the contact point to minimize root contact according to sites and levels, except into palatal interradicular bone between the maxillary first and second molars.",M2
20152659,"Postorthodontic <e>root</e> approximation after opening space for maxillary lateral incisor implants.INTRODUCTION: Orthodontic space opening during adolescence is a common treatment for congenitally missing maxillary lateral incisors. Because of continued facial growth and compensatory tooth eruption, several years can elapse between completion of orthodontic treatment for a teenage patient and implant placement. There are reports that, after successful orthodontic opening of the implant space, the central incisor and canine roots reapproximate during retention and prevent implant placement. METHODS: To study this phenomenon, the records of 94 patients with missing maxillary lateral incisors were collected. Periapical and panoramic radiographs were used to measure intercoronal and interradicular distances between the central incisor and the canine adjacent to the missing lateral incisor before and after orthodontic treatment and at implant placement. RESULTS: Although root approximation between the adjacent central incisor and canine during retention did not occur consistently, 11% of the patients experienced relapse significant enough to prevent implant placement. CONCLUSIONS: To ensure sufficient space for implant placement, we recommend at least 6.3 mm of intercoronal space and 5.7 mm of interradicular space between the adjacent central incisor and canine. A bonded wire or resin-bonded bridge will help to reduce root approximation that might occur during retention.",M2
20126913,"Diagnosis and <e>root</e> canal treatment in a mandibular premolar with three canals.This paper presents a case report of a left mandibular second premolar with three canals and three different apical foramina. A 39-year-old male patient presented to our clinic with pain in the mandibular left second premolar. Initially, pain was caused by cold stimulus and later was spontaneously. The intraoral clinical examination revealed a fractured amalgam restoration with occlusal caries. Percussion and cold (Endo-Frost) tests were positive. The radiographic examination showed the presence of two roots. The probable diagnosis was an acute pulpitis. After access cavity, it was observed remaining roof of the pulp chamber and mild bleeding in the tooth lingual area, indicating the possible presence of a third canal. The endodontic treatment was completed in a single session using Root ZX apex locator and K3 NiTi rotary system with surgical diameter corresponding to a .02/45 file in the three canals and irrigation with 1% sodium hypochlorite. The canals were obtured with gutta-percha cones and Sealer 26 using the lateral condensation technique. After 1 year of follow-up, the tooth was asymptomatic and periapical repair was observed radiographically. Internal alterations should be considered during the endodontic treatment of mandibular second premolars. The correct diagnosis of these alterations by the analysis of preoperative radiographs can help the location of two or more canals, thereby avoiding root therapy failure.",M2
20123588,"Prevalence of three-rooted primary mandibular first molars in Taiwan.BACKGROUND/PURPOSE: Knowledge of <e>root</e> canal anatomy is important for dental practice and for identifying features of anthropological significance. Three-rooted permanent mandibular molars are considered an anatomical variant of the Mongoloid race. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of three-rooted primary mandibular first molars in Taiwanese subjects. METHODS: Vertical bite-wing radiographs of 227 subjects, which had been obtained previously in the Department of Pediatric Dentistry, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan, from January 2004 to December 2007, were screened retrospectively. Images of 121 subjects [54 boys and 67 girls; mean age (range), 5.8 (2.4-10.4) years] who had bilateral primary mandibular first molars were studied. The sex, symmetry and frequency of occurrence of three-rooted primary mandibular first molars were recorded and statistically analyzed. RESULTS: The overall prevalence of subjects with three-rooted primary mandibular first molars was 5.0% (6/121), and 83.0% of the molars were unilateral. The prevalence of teeth that showed an extra root among all teeth examined was 2.9% (7/242). Such prevalence did not differ significantly between the right and left sides of the mandible, bilateral and unilateral, or with sex. CONCLUSION: The data presented here indicate that approximately 5% of Taiwanese subjects had a threerooted mandibular primary first molar and 80% of such teeth occurred unilaterally. Dentists should take into account the prevalence of these three-rooted variants in primary mandibular first molars among Taiwanese patients during their daily endodontic and exodontic procedures.",M2

20123367,"Predicting the configuration of a C-shaped canal system from panoramic radiographs.OBJECTIVE: To characterize the presentation of C-shaped canals in mandibular molars on dental panoramic radiographs. STUDY DESIGN: The sample consisted of 290 patients who had undergone both panoramic dental radiography and computed tomography (CT). Initially the presence of mandibular molars with C-shaped canals was identified on this sample by the use CT. This was used as a ground radiographic truth. Then 3 investigators independently classified the mandibular molars according to their 6 <e>root</e> morphologies on panoramic dental radiographs. The sensitivities, specificities, positive predictive values (PPV), and negative predictive values (NPV) of characteristic findings on panoramic radiographs were calculated. RESULTS: A C-shaped canal was identified in 90 (29%) of 311 mandibular molars. The most common morphology of C-shaped canal molars was 2 separate conical roots (52%); trabecular patterns were relatively common between the roots. In contrast, the most common morphology of molars without C-shaped canals was 2 separate roots that were either divergent or parallel (85%). CONCLUSION: Panoramic radiography is a good surveying modality to detect C-shaped canals and can be used to determine whether further examination is required before endodontic treatment.",M2
20121924,"A new osteopetrosis mutant mouse strain (ntl) with odontoma-like proliferations and lack of tooth <e>roots</e>.A new spontaneous mouse mutant (ntl) with autosomal-recessive osteopetrosis was characterized. These mice formed tartrate-resistant acid phosphate (TRAP)-positive osteoclasts but their osteoclasts had no ruffled border and did not resorb bone. These mice displayed no tooth eruption or tooth root formation. Adult mutant mice developed odontoma-like proliferations near the proximal ends of the incisors. Intraperitoneal injection of progenitor cells from the liver of 16.5 days postcoitum wild-type embryos into newborn mutants rescued the osteopetrosis phenotype, indicating that the defects were intrinsic to the osteoclasts. Our findings not only provide further support for a critical role of osteoclasts in tooth eruption and tooth root development, but also suggest that the perturbation of the homeostasis of the odontogenic precursors of the incisors is primarily responsible for the development of the odontoma-like proliferations in this osteopetrosis mutant. Genetic mapping has narrowed down the location of the mutant allele to a genetic interval of 3.2 cM on mouse chromosome 17.",M2

METHODS: Two hundred seventeen extracted human mandibular first premolars were used. Radiographs were taken in both mesiodistal and buccolingual directions for each premolar. Then, all the teeth were decoronated at the cementoenamel junction and resected perpendicular to their long axes into three equal sections and stained with fuscin. Digital photographs of the cross-sectional root surfaces were taken and surveyed at 40x magnification. The root canal configuration types were determined separately by radiographs and cross-sectional images for each premolar. RESULTS: Out of 217 teeth examined, 192 (88.47%) had a single root canal. The remaining 25 teeth (11.53%) showed two canals in at least one cross-section of their roots with five root canal configurations. In the mesiodistal (MD) radiographs, only 5.99% of premolars showed two canals with three root canal configurations. CONCLUSIONS: One-hundred ninety two out of 217 premolars showed one canal in both cross-section and MD radiography. Only 7 premolars were diagnosed as having more than one canal with the same canal configuration in both cross-sections and MD radiography methods.",M2
20113776,"Treatment outcome of mineral trioxide aggregate: repair of <e>root</e> perforations.INTRODUCTION: The use of biocompatible materials like mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) may improve the prognosis of teeth with root perforations. METHODS: The treatment outcome of root perforations repaired between 2000 and 2006 with MTA was investigated. Twenty-six patients received treatment with MTA in 26 teeth with root perforations. Treatment was performed by supervised undergraduate students (29%), general dentists (52%), or dentists who had focused on endodontics (19%). Perforation repair by all treatment providers was performed using a dental operating microscope. Calibrated examiners assessed clinical and radiographic outcome 12 to 65 months after treatment (median 33 months, 81% recall rate). Pre-, intra-, and postoperative information relating to potential prognostic factors was evaluated. RESULTS: Of 21 teeth examined, 18 teeth (86%) were classified as healed. None of the analyzed potential prognostic factors had a significant effect on the outcome. CONCLUSIONS: MTA appears to provide a biocompatible and long-term effective seal for root perforations in all parts of the root.",M2
20111870,"Evaluation of the radiographic visibility of the <e>root</e> pulp in the lower third molars for the purpose of forensic age estimation in living individuals.The question of whether an individual has reached the age of 18 is of crucial importance in forensic age estimation practice. In some countries, the age threshold of 21 years is relevant as well. A completed mineralization of third molars is not a sufficient criterion for a diagnosis of a minimum age of 18 years with the required probability. In a material of 1,198 orthopantomograms from 629 females and 569 males aged between 15 and 40 years, the visibility of the root pulp of fully mineralized lower third molars was evaluated according to stages 0, 1, 2, and 3. In females, stage 0 was first noticed at age 17.2 years, in males at age 17.6 years. In either sex, the earliest observation of stage 1 was between 21.0 and 22.4 years. Stage 2 was first achieved by males between 22.3 and 22.7 years, by females between 23.4 and 24.7 years. The occurrence of stage 3 was first found in both sexes between 25.1 and 25.9 years. These findings indicate that for stage 0, an age below 18 years cannot be excluded. However, for stage 1, the examined individual must be over 18 years of age and most probably over 21 years of age. For stages 2 and 3, the age can safely be stated to be over 21 years of age. This method may be a powerful tool for forensic dentists in age estimation in asylum and criminal proceedings.",M2
19863900,"Case report: Surgical luxation and elevation as treatment approach for secondary eruption failure of permanent molars.BACKGROUND. Secondary eruption failure of permanent molars is a rare disturbance that usually causes serious clinical problems to the patient. Various treatment approaches have been proposed that depend on the age of the patient, the developmental stage of the <e>root</e>, the position of the tooth, the severity of infraocclusion and the presence of one or more affected teeth. Surgical luxation followed by elevation and stabilization of the luxated tooth has been proposed as a first-step treatment in cases of young patients with incomplete root formation and favourable position of the tooth. CASE REPORT. A boy initially aged 7.5 years old presented with localized secondary eruption failure of the mandibular right first permanent molar (46) and infra-occlusion. The medical and dental history of the child was uneventful, while there was no history of eruption failure or ankylosis in any other family member. TREATMENT. This included surgical luxation of the tooth, followed by elevation to the occlusal plane and immobilization to the adjacent primary molar. The splint was removed after 4 weeks. FOLLOW-UP. Three years follow-up revealed a successful result with no clinical or radiological pathology of the area. Root development of the affected tooth was arrested, but there was no sign of pulp necrosis. CONCLUSION. Favourable treatment outcome using surgical luxation and repositioning of the teeth in the present case of permanent molar with secondary eruption failure was observed.",M2
20097106,"Assessment of the anterior maxilla in orthodontic patients using upper anterior occlusal radiographs and dental panoramic tomography: a comparison.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to establish if dental panoramic tomographic (DPT) radiographs provide a reliable means of assessing the anterior maxilla in new orthodontic patients. STUDY DESIGN: Two hundred fifty pairs of upper anterior occlusal (UAO) and DPT radiographs were randomly selected from the records of new orthodontic patients. Ten observers each rated 50 pairs of radiographs for specific risk factors as well as for a measure of adequacy. Correlations between the 2 radiograph types and inter/intraobserver reliability were computed using Cohen kappa test. RESULTS: Intraobserver reliability was good for detection of impacted teeth/supernumeraries/periapical pathology (kappa = 0.711-1.0). Reliability was more variable for the specific <e>root</e> morphologies, with blunt and bent roots being reassessed as such most reliably (kappa = 0.259-0.533). There was low interobserver reliability (kappa = 0.327 for UAO and kappa = 0.223 for DPT) for  normal  or  not normal  root morphology. For every variable, however, the interexaminer agreement was higher when using UAO radiographs rather than DPTs. Observers were best able to agree on the diagnosis of eroded/resorbed roots on the UAO (kappa = 0.402) and blunt roots (kappa = 0.303) on the DPT radiographs. With UAO as the gold (reference) standard for grading root morphology, DPT had a sensitivity of 45.6% and a specificity of 71.4% for detecting abnormal root form. Risk factors were more likely to be detected on the UAO radiographs than the DPTs. DPTs had a poor ability to detect abnormal root form. DPTs were more likely to be rated as  inadequate  than UAO radiographs. On 6 occasions, supernumerary teeth that were observed on the UAO were missed on the DPT. CONCLUSION: The DPT is not an accurate means of screening the anterior maxilla prior to orthodontic treatment.",M2

20089068,"Multidisciplinary approach to the treatment of an oblique crown-<e>root</e> fracture.This case report describes the management of an oblique crown-root fracture of the buccal cusp of the upper right first premolar. After removal of the fractured cusp, a provisional restorative build-up in this area was carried out, in order to carry out an endodontic treatment in a sterile environment. A glass fibre post and core were then constructed and over a 90-day period the tooth was extruded orthodontically by 4 mm. The periodontal fibres associated with this tooth were cut with a tiny surgical blade to help to prevent reintrusion of the tooth and achieve fine contouring of the gingival margins. The new tooth position was maintained with a retainer for a further 60 days and after a period with a provisional acrylic crown, a porcelain bonded crown was fitted. This case report demonstrates that such a multidisciplinary treatment approach to an oblique subgingival fracture is a reliable and predictable manner in which to save a tooth that would have otherwise been difficult, if not impossible, to restore with a resultant good long-term prognosis.",M2
20089061,"The effects of digital image enhancement on the detection of vertical <e>root</e> fracture.AIM: To determine the effects of digital image enhancement on observer ability to detect experimentally induced vertical root fractures (VRF). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 64 extracted human mandibular premolar teeth were used in this study. In 32 teeth, VRFs were created in the bucco-lingual planes by gently tapping with screw-type root-canal pins. The remaining 32 intact teeth served as a control group. Digital images were obtained using a charge coupled device sensor. Three observers separately examined the original and four types of digitally enhanced images (enhanced using sharpness, zoom-in, reverse-contrast, and pseudo-3D functions) at 1-week intervals. All teeth were evaluated using a 5-point scale for the presence/absence of VRF. Evaluations of each image set were repeated 1 month after the initial viewings. Kappa coefficients were calculated to investigate the degree of intra- and inter-observer agreement. The areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves (Az values) were calculated using the MedCalc statistical software. ROC values for each image type, observer and viewing were compared using t-tests. A level of alpha = 0.05 was considered significant. RESULTS: Kappa coefficients for intra-observer agreement ranged from 0.304 to 0.679. Inter-observer agreement kappa values ranged from 0.109 to 0.399 for the first reading and from 0.106 to 0.380 for the second reading. Statistical comparisons between Az values for each observer showed no significant differences (P &gt; 0.05) among image types. CONCLUSION: There were no differences in diagnostic outcomes among differently enhanced images in the in vitro detection of VRF.",M2
20082304,"Effect of cryopreservation on biological and immunological properties of stem cells from apical papilla.Stem cells from apical papilla (SCAP) are a novel population of multipotent stem cells that, although similar to dental pulp stem cells, are a discrete source of dental stem cells. SCAP have potential roles in <e>root</e> development, apexogenesis, pulp/dentin regeneration, and bioroot engineering. However, procedures to store and preserve SCAP for future clinical applications have not been explored. In this study, we compared human freshly isolated SCAP (fSCAP) with cryopreserved SCAP (cSCAP) in terms of cell viability, colony-forming efficiency, cell proliferation rate, multilineage differentiation potential, profiles of mesenchymal stem cell (MSC) markers, karyotype analysis, and immunological assays. cSCAP showed a similar viable cell ratio, colony-forming efficiency, cell proliferation rate, multilineage differentiation potential, MSC surface markers, apoptotic rate, and G-banded karyotype when compared to fSCAP. There was no significant difference between fSCAP and cSCAP with regard to immune properties. In addition, cSCAP of miniature pig possessed the similar proliferation rate, differentiation potential, and immunomodulatory function as seen in fSCAP. This study demonstrates that cryopreservation does not affect the biological and immunological properties of SCAP, supporting the feasibility of SCAP cryopreservation in nitrogen.",M2

20050748,"Clinical outcomes of 0.018-inch and 0.022-inch bracket slot using the ABO objective grading system.OBJECTIVE: To determine if there is a significant difference in the clinical outcomes of cases treated with 0.018-inch brackets vs 0.022-inch brackets according to the American Board of Orthodontics (ABO) Objective Grading System (OGS). MATERIALS AND METHODS: Treatment time and the ABO-OGS standards in alignment/rotations, marginal ridges, buccolingual inclination, overjet, occlusal relationships, occlusal contacts, interproximal contacts, and <e>root</e> angulations were used to compare clinical outcomes between a series of 828 consecutively completed orthodontic cases (2005-2008) treated in a university graduate orthodontic clinic with 0.018-inch- and 0.022-inch-slot brackets. RESULTS: A two-sample t-test showed a significantly shorter treatment time and lower ABO-OGS score in four categories (alignment/rotations, marginal ridges, overjet, and root angulations), as well as lower total ABO-OGS total score, with the 0.018-inch brackets. The ANCOVA-adjusting for covariants of discrepancy index, age, gender, and treatment time-showed that the 0.018-inch brackets scored significantly lower than the 0.022-inch brackets in both the alignment/rotations category and total ABO-OGS score. CONCLUSIONS: There were statistically, but not clinically, significant differences in treatment times and in total ABO-OGS scores in favor of 0.018-inch brackets as compared with the 0.022-inch brackets in a university graduate orthodontic clinic (2005-2008).",M2
20050742,"<e>Root</e> shortening in patients treated with two-step and en masse space closure procedures with sliding mechanics.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the comparative amount of root shortening between two-step and en masse space closure procedures. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fifty-two patients were selected from a pool of patients satisfying the following inclusion criteria: no evidence of resorption on the pretreatment panoramic radiographs; no dental trauma; no dilacerations of incisor roots, anodontia, or impacted canines; complete root formation at the start of treatment; intact and caries-free incisors; no endodontically treated incisors; Angle Class I or II malocclusion; extraction of four first premolars; and space closure with moderate anchorage. Patients received treatment with either a two-step or an en masse procedure to close the extraction spaces after alignment and leveling with the same preadjusted appliances. Root shortening of the maxillary and mandibular incisors was evaluated on panoramic radiographs, taken before and after space closure, and measured in millimeters. Distortion of measurements caused by panoramic radiographs was corrected by using special metal rods ligated to brackets. Statistical comparisons of root shortening between space closure procedures were investigated with the two-sample t test. RESULTS: No difference was found in the amount of root shortening between space closure procedures. The average root shortening of maxillary central and lateral incisors was 0.43 +/- 0.12 mm and 0.58 +/- 0.10 mm, respectively, and that of mandibular central and lateral incisors was 0.23 +/- 0.07 mm and 0.22 +/- 0.06 mm, respectively.

20050738,"Cone beam computed tomography for assessment of <e>root</e> length and marginal bone level during orthodontic treatment.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the accuracy and precision of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) with regard to measurements of root length and marginal bone level in vitro and in vivo during the course of orthodontic treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirteen patients (aged 12-18 years) from an ongoing study and a dry skull were examined with CBCT using multiplanar reformatting for measurements of root length and marginal bone level. For in vivo evaluation of changes in root length, an index according to Malmgren et al was used, along with a modification of this method. RESULTS: The in vitro mean difference between physical and radiographic measurements was 0.05 mm (SD 0.75) for root length and -0.04 mm (SD 0.54) for marginal bone level. In vivo the error was &lt;0.35 mm for root length determinations and &lt;0.40 mm for marginal bone level assessments.

20050736,"<e>Root</e> and bone response to the proximity of a mini-implant under orthodontic loading.OBJECTIVE: To determine the histological reaction of the root and bone as a mini-implant approaches the root. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two kinds of mini-implants were inserted into the buccal alveolar bone of 4 beagles (2 males and 2 females). The specimens were classified as the near-root group, the PDL contact group, the root contact group, and the root perforation group. Cementum resorption, dentin resorption, cementum repair, cementum growth, ankylosis, root cracking, and root fracture were assessed as the implant neared the root. RESULTS: The incidence of root resorption increased when the mini-implant was less than 0.6 mm from the root in the near-root group and PDL contact group. Root cracking and root fracture occurred in the root contact group and root perforation group. Bone resorption and ankylosis were observed in some specimens. However, some specimens of the PDL contact group and root contact group had cementum growth or little root resorption despite proximity to the root. In the root perforation group, root resorption and ankylosis occurred on the side opposite the insertion. CONCLUSIONS: There is a risk of root contact and severe tissue damage from a thick mini-implant and the drilling procedure, either of which can induce root resorption or ankylosis. Use of smaller mini-implants may reduce root contact and tissue damage. However, the small mini-implant may need enhancement of its stability.",M2
20050735,"Autotransplantation of teeth in 215 patients. A follow-up study.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the success rate of autotransplantation of teeth in consecutive patients and to analyze factors affecting the outcome. Materials and METHODS: The subjects consisted of 215 consecutive patients (101 women and 114 men; aged 9.1-56.4 years, median age 15.2 years [P(10) = 11.4, P(90) = 19.7]) who had undergone transplantation of a total of 269 teeth, all by the same surgeon. In patients with multiple transplants, only the first transplant was included, to ensure that all transplanted teeth were independent units. The transplants were recorded as unsuccessful if the tooth had been extracted or was surviving but with <e>root</e> resorption or ankylosis. The interval between transplantation and final follow-up was a median 4.8 years (P(10) = 2.0, P(90) = 5.5) for successful transplants and a median of 2.4 years (P(10) = 0.4, P(90) = 7.7) for unsuccessful transplants. RESULTS: One-hundred seventy-five (81%) of the transplantations were recorded as successful and 40 (19%) as unsuccessful. Twenty-five teeth had been extracted and 15 had survived but did not fulfill the criteria for success. CONCLUSIONS: The success rate of 215 consecutively transplanted teeth was 81%. The highest success rate was for transplantation of premolars to the maxillary incisor region (100%). Complications at surgery such as difficult extraction, deviant root anatomy, or damaged root periodontium affected the outcome. During growth, a successful transplant preserves alveolar bone.",M2
20032614,"Sealing ability of mineral trioxide aggregate and Portland cement for furcal perforation repair: a protein leakage study.The purpose of this study was to compare the sealing ability of gray mineral trioxide aggregate (GMTA), white MTA (WMTA), and both white and gray Portland cement as furcation perforation repair materials. A total of 120 human mandibular first molars were used. After <e>root</e> canal obturation and preparation of furcal perforations the specimens were randomly divided into four groups of 25 teeth each. In groups A, B, C, and D furcation perforations were filled with WMTA, GMTA, white Portland cement, and type II Portland cement, respectively. Ten teeth were used as positive controls with no filling materials in the perforations and 10 teeth with complete coverage with two layers of nail varnish were used as negative controls. A protein leakage model utilizing 22% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used for evaluation. Leakage was noted when color conversion of the protein reagent was observed. The controls behaved as expected. Leakage was found in the samples from group A (WMTA), group B (GMTA), and in the two other groups (white and gray Portland cement). There were no statistically significant differences between GMTA and WMTA or white and gray Portland cement, but significant differences were observed between the MTA groups and the Portland cement groups. It was concluded that Portland cements have better sealing ability than MTA, and can be recommended for repair of furcation perforation if the present results are supported by other in vivo and in vitro studies.",M2
20032612,"Age-related changes in crown and <e>root</e> length in Sri Lankan Sinhalese.Exploration of the relationship between tooth dimensions, body size, and age is important in paleontology, forensic odontology and aesthetic dentistry. It is reasonable to speculate that tooth length is associated with stature since teeth contribute to facial height. This study aimed to determine whether there was an association between tooth length and stature and age in a sample of Sri Lankan Sinhalese. Extracted teeth of adults, whose age, sex and standing height were known, were used for measurements. The total tooth length (TTL), crown length (CL) and root length (RL) of permanent maxillary central (68) and lateral (67) incisors were measured using a caliper. Statistical analyses were performed with the software MINITAB version 14.0 (Minitab Inc, USA). Mean age and standing height were 47.81 yr and 152.15 cm, respectively. There was no significant correlation between stature and tooth lengths of incisors. However, age was found to have a significant correlation with RL, (r = 0.26, P &lt; 0.05) and CL (r = -0.28, P &lt; 0.05). Absence of an association between tooth length and stature indicated that the genetic linkage between tooth size and stature was weak, suggesting that determination of stature from tooth lengths is unwarranted. The association between tooth length and age indicates the importance of root length in age determination.",M2
20032608,"Linear measurements to determine working length of curved canals with fine files: conventional versus digital radiography.This in vitro study compared conventional and digital radiographic linear measurements to determine the working length (WL) of curved canals with fine endodontic files. In total, 30 mesiobuccal <e>root</e> canals in molars were measured with a #06 K-file to a length 1 mm short of the apical foramen (WL1). Teeth were mounted in plastic blocks and standardized periapical radiographs were obtained by conventional and digital (Digora Optime) radiographic methods with #06, #08 and #10 K-files positioned in WL1. Two independent and calibrated examiners performed the conventional measurements with a millimeter ruler, from the file stop to the file tip (WL2). For the digital images, examiners used the linear measurement tool on the Digora software, in original mode (WL3). For comparison of WL1, WL2 and WL3, the Wilcoxon test (P &lt; 0.05) was applied and the reproducibility of the measurements was assessed. There was no statistically significant difference between Wl2 and Wl3 for #06, #08 and #10 K-files (P = 0.341, 0.641 and 0.232, respectively), with an acceptable level of interexaminer agreement. The measurements of Wl2 and Wl3 were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) larger than those of WL1. No difference was observed among the linear measures obtained with either radiographic method, which showed higher WL values than the direct measurements.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: The VRFs were created in 30 teeth, and 30 intact teeth served as control samples. All images were evaluated twice by 4 observers. Kappa coefficients were calculated to assess intra- and interobserver agreement, and t tests were used to compare Az values (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: Both intra- and interobserver agreement values were higher for the ultra-resolution Iluma and NewTom 3G images compared with the low-resolution Iluma and intraoral CCD images. Az values for the ultra-resolution Iluma and NewTom 3G images were also higher than for the Iluma low-resolution and intraoral CCD images. No significant differences (P &gt; .05) in diagnostic accuracy were found between the Iluma ultra-resolution and NewTom 3G images, with the exception of the second reading of observer 2 (P = .036), and no significant differences (P &gt; .05) were found between the intraoral digital and low-resolution Iluma images.

20019417,"Finite element analysis of weakened <e>roots</e> restored with composite resin and posts.Finite element analysis (FEA) was used to investigate the influence of different post systems on the stress distribution of weakened teeth under oblique-load application. A maxillary central incisor root obtained from a sound tooth was weakened by partial removal of dentin inside the root canal. Seven two-dimensional numerical models, one from the sound tooth and six from the weakened root restored with composite resin and post systems were created as follows - ST: sound tooth; CPC: cast CuAl post and core; SSP: stainless steel post + composite core; GP: fiberglass + composite core; CP: carbon fiber + composite core; ZP: zirconium dioxide post + composite core; TP: titanium post + composite core. The numerical models were considered to be restored with a leucite-reinforced all-ceramic crown and received a 45 masculine occlusal load (10 N) on the lingual surface.All the materials and structures were considered linear elastic, homogeneous, and isotropic, with the exception of fiberglass and carbon fiber posts which assumed orthotropic behavior. The numerical models were plotted and meshed with isoparametric elements, and the results were analyzed using von Mises and Sy stress criteria. When compared with the sound tooth, FEA revealed differences in stress distribution when post systems were used. Among the restored teeth, the use of CPC, SSP, ZP, and TP resulted in higher stress concentration in the post itself when compared to GP and CP. Therefore, results from the FEA images suggested that the use of non-metallic post systems could result in improved mechanical behavior for the weakened restored teeth.",M2
20009599,"A technique for atraumatic extraction of teeth before immediate implant placement using implant drills.PURPOSE: The purpose of this article is to present a minimally invasive technique using the implant drills to help extract teeth before the insertion of immediate implants. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Nine patients (7 women and 2 men) aged 24 to 60 years having <e>root</e> fractures and dental caries were included in this study. Inclusion criteria for the study were presence of at least 4 mm of bone beyond the root apex, the absence of acute signs of infection or inflammation in the treatment area, and the absence of systemic pathologies that would contraindicate bone healing around implants. Heavy smokers were not included in the study. Extraction was done after thinning the root walls by the help of the implant drills. After extraction, implant sites were prepared and implants were inserted. In 2 of the cases, the peri-implant bone defect was filled with autogenous bone graft. RESULTS: Healing progressed uneventfully in all 9 cases. The use of implant drills to thin the root walls provided atraumatic tooth extraction protecting the thin buccal bone. At second stage surgery, all implants were asymptomatic, immobile, and osseointegrated. The soft tissue anatomy was clinically acceptable in all patients. Radiographic examination of all 9 implants showed no peri-implant radiolucency at the end of a year. CONCLUSION: Successful osseointegration and complete bone healing were observed for all patients. The new extraction technique was found to be effective in immediate implant cases in order not to damage the thin plate of buccal bone.",M2
20006164,"Tooth replantation after use of Euro-Collins solution or bovine milk as storage medium: a histomorphometric analysis in dogs.PURPOSE: Euro-Collins solution was developed for the preservation of organs for transplantation, whose characteristics have raised interest for its use as a storage medium for avulsed teeth before replantation. This study evaluated histologically and morphometrically the healing process of dog teeth replanted after storage in Euro-Collins solution or bovine milk. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighty <e>roots</e> of 4 young adult mongrel dogs were randomly assigned to 4 groups (n = 20) and the root canals were instrumented and obturated with gutta-percha and a calcium hydroxide-based sealer. After 2 weeks, the teeth were extracted and subjected to the following protocols: GI (negative control), replantation immediately after extraction; GII (positive control), bench-drying for 2 hours before replantation; GIII and GIV, immersion in 10 mL of whole bovine milk and Euro-Collins solution at 4 degrees C, respectively, for 8 hours before replantation. The animals were sacrificed 90 days postoperatively. The pieces containing the replanted teeth were subjected to routine processing for histologic and histometric analyses under light microscopy and polarized light microscopy. RESULTS: Root resorption was observed in all groups. GII exhibited the greatest loss of dental structure (P &lt; .01), and inflammatory resorption was predominant in this group. Storage in milk showed poorer results than immediate replantation and storage in Euro-Collins solution (P &lt; .01). The teeth stored in Euro-Collins solution presented similar extension of root resorption and periodontal ligament reorganization to those of immediately replanted teeth. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that the Euro-Collins solution is an adequate storage medium for keeping avulsed teeth for up to 8 hours before replantation.",M2

MATERIALS AND METHODS: A literature search of electronic databases, Cochrane Oral Health Group's Trials Register, National Research Register, conference proceedings, and abstracts was performed to identify studies that had investigated the diagnostic accuracy of the 3 panoramic radiographic markers (ie, darkening of the root, interruption of the radiopaque borders, and diversion of the mandibular canal). RevMan, version 5.0, and Meta-DiSc software programs were used for the pooled analyses and the construction of a summary receiver operating characteristic curve. RESULTS: A total of 5 studies were included, involving 894 observations. The overall pooled sensitivity and specificity for darkening of the root was calculated as 51.2% (95% confidence interval [CI] 42% to 60%) and 89% (95% CI 87% to 90%), respectively. The interruption of radiopaque borders showed a pooled sensitivity of 53.5% (95% CI 78.1% to 81.8%) and a pooled specificity of 80% (95% CI 78.1% to 81.8%). The diversion of the canal criterion had a pooled sensitivity of 29.4% (95% CI 21.8% to 38.1%) and a pooled specificity of 94.7% (95% CI 93.6% to 95.7%). The area under the receiver operating characteristic curve was 70% to 77%. CONCLUSIONS: The results of this meta-analysis suggest a reasonable diagnostic accuracy for panoramic radiography in the preoperative evaluation of the relationship between third molars and the canal. Additional studies are needed to examine a more accurate, accessible, and cost-effective initial radiographic technique before third molar surgery.",M2
20003951,"Compromised bond strength after <e>root</e> dentin deproteinization reversed with ascorbic acid.INTRODUCTION: The present study evaluated the effect of a reducing agent on the bond strength of deproteinized root canal dentin surfaces when using a self-adhesive versus dual-cured cement. Regional differences were also evaluated. METHODS: A total of 45 bovine incisor roots were divided into 3 groups: irrigation with physiologic solution (control), 10-minute deproteinization with 5% NaOCl, and 10-minute deproteinization with 5% NaOCl followed by 10 minutes of 10% ascorbic acid. Fiber posts were cemented with either RelyX U100 or RelyX ARC (with SingleBond 2 or Clearfil SE Bond). The push-out bond strength was evaluated after 24 hours of storage. Data were submitted to three-way analyses of variance and Dunnett T3 tests (alpha = 0.05). RESULTS: No differences between cements were observed within the testing conditions, regardless of the adhesive (P &lt; .05). Deproteinization reduced bond strengths. Subsequent treatment with ascorbic acid was capable of reversing bond strength value changes to levels similar to those of controls. Regional radicular differences were also found, where coronal &gt; middle &gt; apical. CONCLUSIONS: The reducing agent was capable of reversing the effect of dentin deproteinization, and RelyX U100 behaved similarly to RelyX ARC.",M2
20003950,"Comparison of five cone beam computed tomography systems for the detection of vertical <e>root</e> fractures.INTRODUCTION: This study compared the accuracy of cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) scans made by five different systems in detecting vertical root fractures (VRFs). It also assessed the influence of the presence of root canal filling (RCF), CBCT slice orientation selection, and the type of tooth (premolar/molar) on detection accuracy. METHODS: Eighty endodontically prepared teeth were divided into four groups and placed in dry mandibles. The teeth in groups Fr-F and Fr-NF were artificially fractured; those in groups control-F and control-NF were not. Groups Fr-F and control-F were root filled. CBCT scans were made using five different commercial CBCT systems. Two observers evaluated images in axial, coronal, and sagittal reconstruction planes. RESULTS: There was a significant difference in detection accuracy among the five systems (p = 0.00001). The presence of RCF did not influence sensitivity (p = 0.16), but it reduced specificity (p = 0.003). Axial slices were significantly more accurate than sagittal and coronal slices (p = 0.0001) in detecting VRF in all systems. Significantly more VRFs were detected among molars than premolars (p = 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: RCF presence reduced specificity in all systems (p = 0.003) but did not influence accuracy (p = 0.79) except in one system (p = 0.012). Axial slices were the most accurate in detecting VRFs (p = 0.0001).",M2
20003947,"Stress distribution with different restorations in teeth with curved <e>roots</e>: a finite element analysis study.INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate and compare stress distribution in various degrees of curved roots with different post and restorations by finite element analysis (FEA). METHODS: Sixteen 3-dimensional FEA models were created and adapted by using computer software based on external anatomy of mandibular second premolar. A 50-N load was applied. Tensile and compressive stresses were plotted. RESULTS: The stress distribution pattern showed that degrees of root curvature in this study (15, 30, and 45 degrees) had little effect. When the elastic modulus of post and core materials was similar to that of root dentin, tensile stresses were low and concentrated on the external root surface. With higher elastic modulus of materials, tensile stresses were increased and concentrated on the post and post apex. CONCLUSIONS: Within the limitations of this study, the suitable restoration in endodontically treated mandibular premolar with limited loss of tooth structure was resin composite that was filled in the coronal third of the root canal. However, when the post and core were indicated, the glass-fiber post and resin composite core were the materials of choice for restoration.",M2
20003939,"Gene expression analysis of acutely traumatized pulps.INTRODUCTION: Vertical <e>root</e> fracture of vital teeth is a relatively rare occurrence. To address early molecular biologic events that take place in the pulp of such cases, we measured mRNA expression levels of selected molecules related to nociception, bacterial pattern recognition, and hard tissue repair/mineralization. METHODS: Three extracted roots obtained from vital molars diagnosed as vertical root fracture were used. The samples were first analyzed with light and transmission electron microscopy. Then mRNA expression in the apical (root fractured) and coronal portions of the pulp was analyzed by using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or real-time PCR after laser capture microdissection. RESULTS: In all the samples, cracks and vital pulp tissue, but not signs of infection and inflammation, were recognized in the apical portion of the fractured root. The gene expression analysis showed that mRNAs of pattern recognition receptors (CD14, Toll-like receptor 2, and Toll-like receptor 4) and neurokinin-1 receptor were equally expressed in both regions of the pulp. On the other hand, mRNA expression levels of hard tissue-associated proteins (osteopontin, osteonectin, and osteocalcin) and calcium channel voltage-dependent alpha 2 delta subunit 1 (CACNA2D1) in the apical portion of the pulp tissue and periodontal ligaments were significantly up-regulated, as compared with those in the coronal portion of the pulp. CONCLUSIONS: In the traumatized apical pulp of vertically root-fractured vital teeth, elevated mRNA expression of CACNA2D1, a nociception-related molecule, and proteins related to hard tissue repair/mineralization occurs under noninfectious condition.",M2
20002535,"The use of likelihood ratio methodology to find predictors of treatment outcome in patients with dental injury diagnoses.The purpose of this prospective, cohort study of patients with dental injuries was to develop prediction rules to predict treatment response related to the management of dental injuries. The study comprised of 130 patients with a single permanent incisor affected by a dental displacement (n = 100) or fracture injury (n = 30). Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) measurements of pulpal blood flow (PBF) were taken 6 and 18 weeks after dental injury Treatment response (success or failure) was categorized based on findings of clinical and radiographical evaluation after 9 months. Forty-four (34%) subjects were categorized as treatment success (absence of loss of sensitivity, periapical radiolucency and grey discolouration of crown), 43 (33%) as treatment failures (loss of sensitivity, and periapical radiolucency and/or grey discolouration of crown) and 43 (33%) as acceptable outcome (loss of sensitivity). After using univariate analysis to determine the association between potential clinical and LDF predictor variables and treatment response status, preliminary prediction rules were developed for prediction of success [positive likelihood ratio (LR), 29.0; 95% confidence interval (CI), 1.7-496.4] and failure (negative LR, 0.55; CI, 0.4-0.7). The most important variables were subluxation, <e>root</e> fracture, baseline PBF level and change in PBF level at 3-month follow-up. Outcome following the management of dental injuries may be predicted from variables collected from LDF and physical examination. Predictive modelling may provide clinicians with the opportunity to identify 'at-risk' patients early and initiate specific treatment approaches.",M2
19969482,"Shaping ability of nickel-titanium rotary instruments in simulated S-shaped <e>root</e> canals.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to compare the shaping ability of 4 nickel-titanium rotary techniques and 1 hand technique in simulated S-shaped curved root canals. STUDY DESIGN: Seventy-five simulated double-curved resin root canals were divided into 5 groups (n = 15). The canals were compared at 12 different levels and at 3 different times: before preparation and after preparation to master apical 25 and 35. Data were statistically analyzed by performing 2-by-2 comparisons with the Tukey parametric test of variance analysis using a confidence interval of 95%. RESULTS: All of the 75 resin blocks presented transportation of the root canals by transforming the apical curvature into a straight zone and straightening the first curvature. When increasing the diameter from 25 to 35, both curvatures were straightened. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the conditions of this study, we can say that the flexibility of the instruments is inversely related with the transportation of the root canals, and that in the double-curved root canals, the apical curvature is always straightened.",M2
19969480,"Management of crown-<e>root</e> fracture tooth by intra-alveolar transplantation with 180-degree rotation and suture fixation.Teeth with traumatic crown-root fractures extending subgingivally and involving the entire width of the tooth may have problems in endodontic isolation, periodontal maintenance, and restoration. A number of techniques, such as crown lengthening, and orthodontic or surgical extrusion, have been described for treatment of crown-root fractures. However, all of these techniques have limitations in terms of the extended time required for treatment, cost, and esthetic considerations. Intra-alveolar transplantation is an alternative treatment option in the management of complicated crown-root fractures. We describe a case of intra-alveolar transplantation with 180( degrees ) rotation and suture fixation. At 1-year follow-up, the replanted tooth has normal function and no obvious inflammatory root resorption on radiographic examination.",M2
19968743,"Treatment of class III multiple gingival recessions: a randomized-clinical trial.BACKGROUND: The aim of this controlled randomized split-mouth study was to evaluate whether a modified tunnel/connective tissue graft (CTG) technique - enamel matrix derivative (EMD) combination will improve the treatment of multiple class III recession when compared with the same technique alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty healthy subjects with a mean age of 31.7 years, were enrolled for the trial in a university periodontal clinic. Patients with at least three adjacent gingival recessions on both sides of the mouth were treated with a modified tunnel/CTG technique. On the test side, an EMD was used in addition. Clinical parameters were measured at baseline, 28 days, 3, 6 and 12 months after the surgery. Results are presented at the subject level. RESULTS: The mean <e>root</e> coverage from baseline to 1 year post-surgery was 82% for the test group and 83% for the control group. Complete root coverage was achieved at 1 year in eight (38%) of the 20 surgeries (experimental and control group). CONCLUSIONS: One-year results indicate that the modified tunnel/CTG technique is predictable for the treatment of multiple class III recession-type defects. The addition of EMD does not enhance the mean clinical outcomes.",M2

Thirty-two teeth were extracted, the apical thirds (n = 39) were removed, and prepared to analyse the external apical root surface. All specimens presented irregular areas of root resorption with different depths, located mainly around the apical foramen. Teeth with chronic periapical lesions present areas of external apical root resorption with irregular surface and different depths located mainly around the apical foramen.

19961391,"Gingival cyst of the adult: regenerative therapy of associated <e>root</e> exposure. A case report and literature review.BACKGROUND: The gingival cyst of the adult (GCA) is an uncommon developmental cyst of odontogenic origin most frequently seen near mandibular canines and premolars and is routinely treated with excisional biopsy. This article presents a case of a GCA treated with a combined regenerative approach and reviews the GCA literature with an emphasis on the clinical aspects of this lesion. METHODS: A 54 year-old man presented for treatment of generalized severe chronic periodontitis. Clinical examination revealed a cystic lesion in the gingiva of the mandibular canine-premolar area. Radiographs revealed a well-defined radiolucency in the coronal one-third of the tooth roots. Surgical enucleation of the lesion revealed root exposure of the second premolar. Because of the anatomy of the lesion-associated defect, regenerative treatment, using a combination of freeze-dried bone allograft and a collagen membrane, was considered the therapeutic approach of choice. RESULTS: The biopsy revealed histologic features consistent with a GCA. Clinical and radiographic examinations 1 year post-surgery indicated uneventful soft tissue healing and bone fill of the initial defect. The review of the literature revealed only one other case of root exposure associated with GCA and no previous report of regenerative therapy. CONCLUSIONS: In rare instances, a GCA lesion may result in tooth-root exposure. In such cases, a combined regenerative treatment approach may be used to achieve resolution.",M2

19936530,"A scanning electron microscopic study of the patterns of external <e>root</e> resorption under different conditions.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to examine if there are qualitative differences in the appearance of external root resorption patterns of primary teeth undergoing physiologic resorption and permanent teeth undergoing pathological root resorption in different conditions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A total of 40 teeth undergoing external root resorption in different conditions were divided into 4 groups and prepared for examination under scanning electron microscopy at magnifications ranging from 20x to 1000x. Group I: 10 primary molars exfoliated due to physiologic root resorption; Group II: 10 permanent teeth with periapical granulomas showing signs of resorption; Group III:10 permanent teeth therapeutically extracted during the course of orthodontic therapy with evidence of resorption, and Group IV: 10 permanent teeth associated with odontogenic tumors that showed evidence of resorption. RESULTS: In Group I, the primary teeth undergoing resorption showed smooth extensive and predominantly regular areas reflecting the slow ongoing physiologic process. In Group II, the teeth with periapical granulomas showed the resorption was localized to apex with a funnel shaped appearance in most cases. Teeth in Group III, which had been subjected to a short period of light orthodontic force, showed the presence of numerous resorption craters with adjoining areas of cemental repair in some cases. Teeth associated with odontogenic tumors in Group IV showed many variations in the patterns of resorption with extensive loss of root length and a sharp cut appearance of the root in most cases. CONCLUSION: Differences were observed in the patterns of external root resorption among the studied groups of primary and permanent teeth under physiologic and pathological conditions.",M2
19929098,"Volumetric assessment of secondary alveolar bone grafting using cone beam computed tomography.OBJECTIVE: To assess the radiographic outcome of secondary alveolar bone grafting in individuals with nonsyndromic unilateral or bilateral cleft lip and palate using cone beam computed tomography. METHODS: This prospective study was conducted at the University of California at San Francisco Center for Craniofacial Anomalies on 21 consecutive nonsyndromic complete cleft lip and palate individuals between 8 and 12 years of age who required alveolar bone grafting. Seventeen unilateral and four bilateral cleft lip and palate individuals had preoperative and postoperative cone beam computed tomography scans that were analyzed using Amira 3.1.1 software. RESULTS: The average volume of the preoperative alveolar cleft defect in unilateral cleft lip and palate was 0.61 cm(3), and the combined average volume of the right and left alveolar cleft defects in bilateral cleft lip and palate was 0.82 cm(3). The average percentage bone fill in both unilateral cleft lip and palate and bilateral cleft lip and palate was 84%. The outcome of alveolar bone grafting was assessed in relation to (1) type of cleft, (2) size of preoperative cleft defect, (3) presence or absence of lateral incisor, (4) <e>root</e> development stage of the maxillary canine on the cleft side, (5) timing, and (6) surgeon. None of these parameters significantly influenced the radiographic outcome of alveolar bone grafting. CONCLUSIONS: Secondary alveolar bone grafting of the cleft defect in our center was successful, based on radiographic outcome using cone beam computed tomography scans. Volume rendering using cone beam computed tomography and Amira software is a reproducible and practical method to assess the preoperative alveolar cleft volume and the adequacy of bone fill postoperatively.",M2
19919541,"Factors related to treatment and outcomes of avulsed teeth.BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to examine factors associated with avulsion injury and to specify the association between these factors and the treatment, as well as the outcomes of avulsed permanent incisors in children. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The sample consisted of 51 children with 62 avulsed permanent incisors, whose injuries had been managed in the period 1998-2006. The study was prospective, recording the history of the accident, concomitant injuries, age, gender, apical maturity of the <e>root</e>, replantation rate, storage media, extra-alveolar duration, endodontic treatment, compliance and recall appointments response. Factors were analysed in relation to postoperative outcomes, classified as functional healing (FH), infection-related (inflammatory) resorption (IRR) and replacement resorption (RR). RESULTS: The average age of patients was 10.7 years (range 7-19). In 16/51 patients, tooth avulsion was caused by a road traffic accident. Avulsion was accompanied by concomitant injuries in all cases. Thirty of 62 avulsed teeth were not replanted and 32 incisors were replanted after dry storage. Time until replantation ranged between 15 min and 9 h (median 60 min). The observation period ranged from 1 to 6 years (median 2 years). FH was observed in 5/32, IRR in 20/32 and RR in 7/32 incisors. Ten teeth were extracted during 5-years of observation. Immature incisors exhibited significantly more complications compared with mature teeth (P = 0.04). Storage media and extra-alveolar duration did not significantly affect the survival of replanted teeth (P = 0.253, P = 0.350). Teeth in which endodontic treatment was in temporary phase exhibited significantly more complications in comparison with teeth with completed endodontic treatment (P = 0.0l6). CONCLUSION: The combination of delayed replantation and unphysiological storage is followed by low survival. Incisors with open apices exhibited lower survival compared with incisors with closed apices. Replanted incisors that required prolonged treatment with calcium hydroxide exhibited more complications compared with incisors with completed root canal treatment.",M2

19893465,"Surgical decision making in coronally located vertical <e>root</e> fracture.AIM: The purpose of this study was to present an intrasurgical decision making in teeth showing clinical signs and symptoms of incomplete vertical root fracture. METHODS: Sixteen patients with one tooth in which an incomplete vertical root fracture was diagnosed, involving only the buccal side, underwent a flap elevation procedure to visualize the pattern of bone loss and assess the type of root fracture. If the intraoperative diagnosis confirmed the presurgical one, a new root fracture repair technique was used. If the intraoperative diagnosis consisted of a complete or multiple fracture, the tooth was extracted and a postextraction implant insertion procedure was performed, in combination with the use of plasma rich in growth factors in order to enhance implant osseointegration. RESULTS: A total of nine vertical root fracture repair procedures were performed. The mean patient follow-up was 22.5 months. All patients reported full satisfaction for mastication function and phonetics. One patient was not satisfied for the esthetic result. A total of seven implants were immediately inserted in fresh postextraction sockets, and loaded four months later. The mean patient follow-up was 25.2 months. Overall implant success and survival was 100% after one year of functional loading. All patients reported full satisfaction for mastication function, phonetics and esthetics. CONCLUSIONS: Intraoperative diagnosis allowed to choose an appropriate surgical approach that led to excellent results in terms of clinical outcomes and patient satisfaction.",M2
19892289,"<e>Root</e> and pulp response after intentional injury from miniscrew placement.INTRODUCTION: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects on the pulp and supporting tissues when miniscrews severely abrade the root surface. METHODS: Sixty self-drilling and self-tapping miniscrews were placed between the premolars and molars of 3 beagles (20 miniscrews per dog). The miniscrews were placed according to the protocol suggested by the manufacturer, but with the intention of inflicting root damage. Radiographs were taken of all 60 interdental alveolar sites, 5 in each quadrant, and sites that evidenced root proximity were identified. The animals were killed at 12 weeks, and 20 of the most probable injury sites were selected for histologic analysis. Serial nondecalcified sections and microcomputed tomography scans were obtained with the implants in place. RESULTS: There was no histologic evidence of inflammatory response either at the root surface or in the pulp. Pulp necrosis, external resorption, and ankylosis were not found, but reparative cementum was seen at each injury site. The presence of woven bone along miniscrew threads lends evidence to support the osseointegration of miniscrews. CONCLUSIONS: Permanent damage to the pulp and supporting tissues is not a regular occurrence when miniscrews abrade or even enter the root surface.",M2
19892272,"Cone-beam computed tomography evaluation of orthodontic miniplate anchoring screws in the posterior maxilla.INTRODUCTION: The purposes of this study were to evaluate the actual postplacement positions of orthodontic miniplate anchoring screws (MPAS) and to determine the risk factors for their failure and iatrogenic effects on the intraoral structures. METHODS: Three-dimensional cone-beam computed tomography images were generated to examine 31 orthodontic miniplates and their MPAS (diameter, 1.5 mm; length, 4 mm), which showed good clinical stability 6 months after placement in the posterior maxilla of 18 patients. The cone-beam computed tomography data were analyzed with analysis of variance (ANOVA) statistics to evaluate the difference of placement depth and vertical distance of the MPAS from the cementoenamel junction to the center of the screw. The Fisher exact test was used to determine differences in MPAS position, <e>root</e> proximity, and sinus penetration. RESULTS: The mean placement depth of the MPAS was 2.48 mm with no significant difference relative to their position. Twenty-six (of 74) MPAS were placed in the dentition area. Of these 26, 14 were placed in interdental spaces, and the other 12 followed the direction of the roots. Nine MPAS showed root proximity, and 7 MPAS had root penetration, all of which were placed in the central position of the miniplate. Thirty-nine MPAS penetrated the sinus, indicating a low interrelationship between placement depth and cortical bone thickness of the sinus. CONCLUSIONS: Miniplates were successfully retained by MPAS even with less-than-ideal placement. Root contact and proximity of MPAS seem to have minimal effects on the successful stabilization of miniplates. Pertinent guidelines should, however, be followed during MPAS placement to minimize the risk of damage to adjacent roots.",M2
19884718,"Comparison of resin push-out strength to <e>root</e> dentin of bovine- and human-teeth.AIM: To compare the push-out strength of bovine- and human-root dentin and, thus, evaluate the suitability of bovine-root dentin to substitute human-root dentin for bond strength testing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten single-rooted human-teeth and ten bovine incisors were prepared using a #3 bur of a fiber post system (12 mm long). The posts were duplicated with resin cement (Duolink). The root canals were treated with All Bond 2 adhesive system and the resin posts were cemented using Duolink. The specimens were cut perpendicular to their long axis, yielding disc-specimens with 1.5 mm thickness, which were submitted to a push-out test (1 mm/min). Ten bond strength values per group (n = 10) were used for statistical analysis (Student t test, alpha =.05). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found for the bond strength values between bovine- (4.1 +/- 1.3 MPa) and human-root dentin (8.6 +/- 5.7 MPa) (P =.0001).

19884709,"Fracture resistance of endodontically treated teeth restored by different FRC posts: an in vitro study.BACKGROUND: Posts and cores are often required for restoration of pulpless teeth and to provide retention and resistance for a complete crown, but conventional posts may increase the <e>root</e> fracture. OBJECTIVE: This study was performed to compare the root fracture resistance of extracted teeth treated with different fibers reinforced with composite posts and treated teeth with conventional post and core systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Root canal therapy was performed for 50 mandibular first premolars. The coronal portion of each tooth was amputated, and five post and core systems (cast, polyethylene woven, glass, carbon, and quartz fiber posts) were compared. Acrylic resin blocks were used for mounting, using a layer of elastomeric impression material covering the roots. The load was applied axially and measured with a universal testing machine. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: Significantly, cast posts and cores had a higher failure threshold including teeth fracture; whereas, fiber posts failure was due to core fracture, with or without fractures in coronal portion of posts. Difference in FRC posts did not provide any significant difference in the load failure and the mode of fracture.",M2
19875312,"Variable-resolution cone-beam computerized tomography with enhancement filtration compared with intraoral photostimulable phosphor radiography in detection of transverse <e>root</e> fractures in an in vitro model.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare the diagnostic accuracy of an intraoral photostimulable storage phosphor (PSP) plate system and cone-beam computerized tomography scanning (CBCT) for detection of experimentally induced transverse root fractures and to evaluate differences between original images and images enhanced with high-pass filters. STUDY DESIGN: Sixty-nine extracted human teeth, 34 with root fractures and 35 without, were examined under standardized conditions using an intraoral PSP system (Digora Optime; Soredex). The images were saved in original 8-bit format and in a version sharpened with a high-pass filter. The teeth were examined with CBCT (i-Cat; Imaging Sciences) in 2 resolutions: 0.125 mm and 0.25 mm voxel size. Original images were saved together with images enhanced with 2 high-pass filters, sharpen and angio-sharpen. Six observers scored the presence of a root fracture in all modalities in random order. Sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy [(true positives + true negatives)/all scores] were calculated for each modality and each observer. Differences were estimated by analyzing the binary data, assuming additive effects of observer and modality in a generalized linear model. RESULTS: High-resolution original CBCT images had higher sensitivity (P &lt; .05) than lower-resolution images and PSP images (0.125 mm resolution 87%, 0.25 mm resolution 72%, and PSP 74%). Angio-sharpen-filtered images for both CBCT resolutions had higher sensitivities (P &lt; .02) than the original images (0.125 mm resolution: 95% vs. 87%; 0.25 mm resolution: 81% vs. 72%). There was no significant difference between the lower-resolution CBCT and PSP images. Only small differences in specificity were seen between modalities, and accuracy was higher for high-resolution CBCT than for the other modalities (P &lt; .03). CONCLUSIONS: High-resolution i-Cat CBCT images resulted in an increase in sensitivity without jeopardizing specificity for detection of transverse root fractures compared with lower-resolution CBCT images, which were not more accurate than periapical PSP images. The angio-sharpen high-pass filter improved sensitivity in the high-resolution CBCT images in this in vitro model.",M2
19852652,"<e>Root</e> contact during drilling for microimplant placement. Affect of surgery site and operator expertise.OBJECTIVE: To determine the surgery site dependency of root contact during drilling for orthodontic microimplant placement and to analyze the influence of clinicians' expertise on the results. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Dental arches with resin teeth were mounted on a dental phantom (P-5/3 TS, Frasaco, Germany). Drilling was conducted in six locations frequently selected for microimplant placement: between the central incisors, between the maxillary first molar and second premolar, and between the mandibular first and second molars, bilaterally. The 28 qualified dentists who participated were divided into two groups based on their clinical experience. A total of 192 drillings were performed by the experienced group and 240 by the inexperienced group. The damaged root surfaces were classified as  moderate  or  severe.  RESULTS: Significant differences in both overall and site-dependent rates of root contacts were found between the groups. Overall rates for the experienced and inexperienced groups were 13.5% and 21.3%, respectively. For the experienced group, the incidents occurred predominantly in the lower left (34.4%) and upper right (18.8%) posterior regions. The most susceptible teeth were numbers 36 and 16. In contrast, for the inexperienced group, all four posterior regions were susceptible. CONCLUSIONS: The surgery site and clinicians' expertise had significant effects on the rate as well as the pattern of root contacts.",M2
19846324,"The prognostic value of panoramic radiography of inferior alveolar nerve damage after mandibular third molar removal: retrospective study of 400 cases.OBJECTIVE: The aim of the study was to estimate the accuracy of panoramic radiographic signs predicting inferior alveolar nerve (IAN) paresthesia after lower third molar removal. STUDY DESIGN: In a case-control study the sample was composed of 41 cases with postoperative IAN paresthesia and 359 control cases without it. The collected data included  classic  specific signs indicating a close spatial relationship between third molar <e>root</e> and inferior alveolar canal (IAC), root curvatures, and the extent of IAC-root tip overlap. Bivariate and multivariate logistic regression analyses were completed to estimate the association between radiographic findings and IAN paresthesia. RESULTS: The multivariate logistic analysis identified 3 signs significantly associated with IAN paresthesia (P &lt; .001): interruption of the superior cortex of the canal wall, diversion of the canal, and darkening of the root. The sensitivities and specificities ranged from 14.6% to 68.3% and from 85.5% to 96.9%, respectively. The positive predictive values, calculated to factor a 1.1% prevalence of paresthesia, ranged from 3.6% to 10.9%, whereas the negative predictive values &gt;99%. CONCLUSION: Panoramic radiography is an inadequate screening method for predicting IAN paresthesia after mandibular third molar removal.",M2
19843136,"The three-dimension finite element analysis of stress in posterior tooth residual <e>root</e> restored with postcore crown.OBJECTIVE: Teeth that have been endodontically treated and restored with postcore crown may experience fracture sometimes. Some researchers have analyzed the stress of the anterior teeth after postcore crown restoration, but the stress of the posterior teeth after such restoration has not been reported. We used three-dimension finite element methods to analyze the stress magnitude and distribution of remaining dentin in posterior tooth residual root restored with postcore crown. The binding material, loading direction, number, length and material of posts were studied. METHODS: The models of residual root of maxillary first molar restored with postcore crown were created by CT scanning, mimics software and abaqus software. Different number, length and material of posts were used in the modeling. The posts were cemented with zinc-phosphate cement or composited resin. A load of 240 N was applied to the occlusal surface in four directions and tensile, shear, and von Mises stresses were calculated. RESULT: (i) The maximum stress on remaining dentin changed irregularly as the number and length of posts changed. (ii) The maximum stress on remaining dentin decreased slightly as elastic modulus of the material of posts increased. (iii) The maximum stress on bonding layer and remaining dentin was lower when bonded with resin luting agent than with zinc-phosphate cement. (iv) The maximum stress on remaining dentin increased markedly as loading angle increased. CONCLUSION: The number, length, material of posts, bonding material and loading angle all have influence on the magnitude and distribution of stress. The influence of loading angle is most apparent.",M2
19843131,"Comparison of intraoral radiography and limited cone beam computed tomography for the assessment of <e>root</e>-fractured permanent teeth.AIM: To compare intraoral occlusal (OC) and periapical (PA) radiographs vs. limited cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) in diagnosing root-fractured permanent teeth. MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 38 patients (mean age 24 years, range 8-52 years) with 44 permanent teeth with horizontal root fractures, intraoral radiographs (PA and OC) and limited CBCT were used to evaluate the location (apical, middle, cervical third of the root) and angulation of the fracture line. Furthermore, the conventional radiographs and CBCT images were compared for concordance of fracture location. RESULTS: In the PA and OC radiographs, 28 fractures (63.6%) were located in the middle third of the root, 11 (25.0%) in the apical third and 5 (11.4%) in the cervical third. The PA/OC radiographs and the sagittal CBCT images (facial aspect) yielded the same level of root fracture in 70.5% of cases (31 teeth; 95% CI: 54.1-82.7%). The PA/OC radiographs and sagittal CBCT images (palatal aspect) showed the same level of root fracture in 31.8% of cases. There was a statistically significant association between the angle at which the root fracture line intersected the axis of the tooth and the level of root fracture in the facial aspect of the sagittal CBCT images. CONCLUSIONS: The diagnosis of the location and angulation of root fractures based on limited CBCT imaging differs significantly from diagnostic procedures based on intraoral radiographs (PA/OC) alone. The clinical significance for treatment strategies and for the prognosis of root-fractured teeth has to be addressed in future studies.",M2
19840655,"Evaluation of correspondence of dental Computed Tomography imaging to anatomic observation of external <e>root</e> resorption.Radiography using a compact dental CT, the 3D Accuitomo XYZ Slice View Tomograph (3D Accuitomo), was performed for examining the root resorption of a mandibular premolar in a patient who needed endodontic therapy. The images obtained by the 3D Accuitomo clearly showed the apparent presence of external root resorption of the tooth. As the root resorption had progressed seriously, the diagnosis was that it was impossible to save the tooth. After having obtained informed consent from the patient, the tooth was extracted. The surface of the root of the extracted tooth was examined visually without magnification, and the observations were compared with the findings made by 3D Accuitomo imaging for evaluating the reliability of the dental CT for diagnostic imaging of root resorption. The radiographic and visual examination results corresponded completely. Thus the 3D Accuitomo depicted the aspects of root resorption accurately; and its application for clinical use should be very effective for examining and diagnosing root resorption.",M2
19852601,"Molecular markers of early orthodontic tooth movement.OBJECTIVE: To understand the molecular basis of early orthodontic tooth movement by looking at the expression of KI-67, runt-related transcription factor 2 (Runx2), and tumor necrosis factor ligand superfamily member 11 (RANKL) proteins. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We employed a rat model of early orthodontic tooth movement using a split-mouth design (where contralateral side serves as a control) and performed immunohistochemical staining to map the spatial expression patterns of three proteins at 3 and 24 hours after appliance insertion. RESULTS: We observed increased expression of KI-67, a proliferation marker, and RANKL, a molecule associated with osteoclastic differentiation, in the compression sites of the periodontal ligament subjected to 3 hours of force. In contrast, there was increased expression of KI-67 and Runx2, a marker of osteoblast precursors, in tension areas after 24 hours of force. Decreased KI-67 expression in the mesial and distal regions of the periodontal ligament was observed at the midpoint of the tooth <e>root</e>. CONCLUSIONS: The early RANKL expression indicates that at this early stage cells are involved in osteoclast precursor signaling. Also, decreased KI-67 expression found near the midpoint of the tooth root is believed to represent the center of rotation, providing a molecular means of visualizing mechanical loading patterns.",M2
19852600,"Optimal loading conditions for controlled movement of anterior teeth in sliding mechanics.OBJECTIVE: To determine optimal loading conditions such as height of retraction force on the power arm and its position on the archwire in sliding mechanics. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A 3D finite element method (FEM) was used to simulate en masse anterior teeth retraction in sliding mechanics. The degree of labiolingual tipping of the maxillary central incisor was calculated when the retraction force was applied to different heights of a power arm set mesial or distal to the canine. RESULTS: When the power arm was placed mesial to the canine, at the level of 0 mm (bracket slot level), uncontrolled lingual crown tipping of the incisor was observed and the anterior segment of the archwire was deformed downward. At a power arm height of 5.5 mm, bodily movement was produced and the archwire was less deformed. When the power arm height exceeded 5.5 mm, the anterior segment of the archwire was raised upward and lingual <e>root</e> tipping occurred. When the power arm was placed distal to the canine, lingual crown tipping was observed up to a level of 11.2 mm. CONCLUSIONS: Placement of the power arm of an archwire between the lateral incisor and canine enables orthodontists to maintain better control of the anterior teeth in sliding mechanics. Both the biomechanical principles associated with the tooth's center of resistance and the deformation of the archwire should be taken into consideration for predicting and planning orthodontic tooth movement.",M2
