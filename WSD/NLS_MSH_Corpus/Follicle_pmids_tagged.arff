20473297,"Bcl-2 and accelerated DNA repair mediates resistance of hair <e>follicle</e> bulge stem cells to DNA-damage-induced cell death.Adult stem cells (SCs) are at high risk of accumulating deleterious mutations because they reside and self-renew in adult tissues for extended periods. Little is known about how adult SCs sense and respond to DNA damage within their natural niche. Here, using mouse epidermis as a model, we define the functional consequences and the molecular mechanisms by which adult SCs respond to DNA damage. We show that multipotent hair-follicle-bulge SCs have two important mechanisms for increasing their resistance to DNA-damage-induced cell death: higher expression of the anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-2 and transient stabilization of p53 after DNA damage in bulge SCs. The attenuated p53 activation is the consequence of a faster DNA repair activity, mediated by a higher non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) activity, induced by the key protein DNA-PK. Because NHEJ is an error-prone mechanism, this novel characteristic of adult SCs may have important implications in cancer development and ageing.",M1
20450888,"Melanocyte stem cells express receptors for canonical Wnt-signaling pathway on their surface.It has been reported that melanocytes play important roles in skin and hair pigmentation and are differentiated from melanocyte stem cells (MSCs) residing in the bulge area of hair <e>follicles</e>. Recently, interest has been growing in MSCs because regulation of the upstream of differentiated melanocytes is essential for the determination of skin and hair pigmentation; however, their precise characteristics remain to be elucidated. The aim of this study is to explore cell-surface markers expressed on MSCs in order to understand their characteristics. To explore genes specifically expressed in the bulge region, we classified a hair follicle into four areas, hair bulb, hair bulb to bulge (lower bulge), bulge, and epidermis to bulge (upper bulge), and collected these areas from back skin sections of C57BL/6 mice by laser microdissection. Real-time RT-PCR performed on these areas revealed that Frizzled (Fzd)-4, Fzd7, low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 5 (Lrp5), and Lrp6, receptors for Wnt molecules, were expressed higher in the bulge area than other areas. Furthermore, FACS analysis showed that populations of Fzd4(+) cells and Fzd7(+) cells were different from those of Kit(+) cells (precursor of melanocytes: melanoblasts). Fzd4(+) and Fzd7(+) cells isolated by FACS required a longer culture period to differentiate into mature melanocytes than Kit(+) cells. Up-regulation of mRNA expressions of melanocyte markers (dopa chrometautomerase: Dct, tyrosinase: Tyr, tyrosinase-related protein 1: Tyrp1) was observed in Fzd4(+) and Fzd7(+) cells following Kit(+) cells during differentiation. These results suggested that Fzd4(+) and Fzd7(+) cells were more immature than melanoblasts, therefore raising the possibility that Fzd4(+) and Fzd7(+) cells are MSCs.",M1
20450009,"Occurrence of demodex spp. (Acari, Demodecidae) in the striped field mouse Apodemus agrarius (Rodentia, Muridae) in Poland.The hair <e>follicle</e> mites (Acari, Demodecidae) are obligatory and specific parasites of mammals, important in human and veterinary medicine. The family is represented by more than 100 species worldwide and 30 in Poland, therein 11 species (and 3 subspecies) were discovered from 10 species of native rodents. Fifty two striped field mice Apodemus agrarius from eastern Pomerania (Poland) were examined in 2006-2007; the presence of mites was confirmed by the standard method of digesting skin fragments (from head, belly, groin, limbs, genital-anal region, neck and back). Two demodectic mites were found: Demodex agrarii and D. arvicolae--specifically the form D. a. apodemi, previously recorded in the wood mouse (Apodemus silvaticus). Demodex spp. were noted in 53.8% of the examined mice; D. arvicolae was the dominant species (prevalence 48.1%, mean intensity 12.5), whereas D. agrarii was found in only a few hosts (prevalence 13.5%, mean intensity 7.6); these mites were more frequently found in males. D. a. apodemi were found mainly in skin of head and very few in skin of genital-anal region. D. agrarii lives in the ducts of the auricular sebaceous gland, in which all its developmental stages have been found; it is precisely the specific habitat of D. agrarii that determines its large size and its strongly elongated shape.",M1
20430743,"Compartmentalized organization: a common and required feature of stem cell niches?A key question in the stem cell field is how to balance the slow cycling of stem cells with active organ growth. Recent studies of the hair <e>follicle</e> stem cell niche have shown that this can be achieved by organizing the stem cell niche into two compartments: one that engages in immediate, rapid new growth and one that contributes later to long-term growth that fuels hair regeneration. Based on these and other recent findings, we propose that several other adult stem cell niches, including those in the blood, intestine and brain, have a similar bi-compartmental organization and that stem cells might work cooperatively with their progeny to sustain tissue regeneration.",M1
20429299,"[Cultivated human hair <e>follicle</e> cells are capable of integrating to skin structure in vivo]In the present study, human keratinocytes and dermal papilla cells were labeled to investigate their behaviour after intradermal transplantation. Cells were transduced by lentiviral vectors that bore marker gene encoding green fluorescent protein (copGFP) or red fluorescent protein (DsRed). A portion of transgene expressing cells was evaluated by flow cytometry. Genetic constructions that we used provided high level (&gt; 95 %) of transduction of hair follicle cells. In vitro transduced cells were injected under the epidermis of human skin fragments, and these fragments were then transplanted under the skin of immunodeficient mice. Injected epidermal keratinocytes were found, mainly, in hair follicles and partially in a zone of interfollicular epidermis, while dermal papilla cells were found in papilla derma. The results of the present research show that the chosen genetic constructions obtained on a basis of human immunodeficiency lentivirs are capable of effective and stable transduction of human skin cells. Injected cells survived and were found in the corresponding structures of the skin.",M1
20412777,"beta-catenin activity in the dermal papilla regulates morphogenesis and regeneration of hair.The activity of keratinocytes in the hair <e>follicle</e> is regulated by signals from a specialized mesenchymal niche, the dermal papilla (DP). Here, mice expressing cre recombinase in the DP were developed to probe the interaction between follicular keratinocytes and the DP in vivo. Inactivation of the beta-catenin gene within DP of fully developed hair follicles results in dramatically reduced proliferation of the progenitors and their progeny that generate the hair shaft, and, subsequently, premature induction of the destructive phase of the hair cycle. It also prevents regeneration of the cycling follicle from stem cells. Gene expression analysis reveals that beta-catenin activity in the DP regulates signaling pathways, including FGF and IGF, that can mediate the DP's inductive effects. This study reveals a signaling loop that employs Wnt/beta-catenin signaling in both epithelial progenitor cells and their mesenchymal niche to govern and coordinate the interactions between these compartments to guide hair morphogenesis.",M1
20411592,"Direct transplantation of uncultured hair-<e>follicle</e> pluripotent stem (hfPS) cells promotes the recovery of peripheral nerve injury.We previously showed that the stem cell marker nestin is expressed in hair follicle stem cells which suggested their pluripotency. We subsequently showed that the nestin-expressing hair-follicle pluripotent stem (hfPS) cells can differentiate in culture to neurons, glial cells, keratinocytes, and other cell types and can promote regeneration of peripheral nerve and spinal cord injuries upon injection to the injured nerve or spinal cord. The location of the hfPS cells has been termed the hfPS cell area (hfPSCA). Previously, hfPS cells were cultured for 1-2 months before transplantation to the injured nerve or spinal cord which would not be optimal for clinical application of these cells for nerve or spinal cord repair, since the patient should be treated soon after injury. In the present study, we addressed this issue by directly using the upper part of the hair follicle containing the hfPSCA, without culture, for injection into the severed sciatic nerve in mice. After injection of hfPSCA, the implanted hfPS cells grew and promoted joining of the severed nerve. The transplanted hfPS cells differentiated mostly to glial cells forming myelin sheaths, which promoted axonal growth and functional recovery of the severed nerve. These results suggest that the direct transplantation of the uncultured upper part of the hair follicle containing the hfPSA is an important method to promote the recovery of peripheral nerve injuries and has significant clinical potential.",M1
20393562,"APCDD1 is a novel Wnt inhibitor mutated in hereditary hypotrichosis simplex.Hereditary hypotrichosis simplex is a rare autosomal dominant form of hair loss characterized by hair <e>follicle</e> miniaturization. Using genetic linkage analysis, we mapped a new locus for the disease to chromosome 18p11.22, and identified a mutation (Leu9Arg) in the adenomatosis polyposis down-regulated 1 (APCDD1) gene in three families. We show that APCDD1 is a membrane-bound glycoprotein that is abundantly expressed in human hair follicles, and can interact in vitro with WNT3A and LRP5-two essential components of Wnt signalling. Functional studies show that APCDD1 inhibits Wnt signalling in a cell-autonomous manner and functions upstream of beta-catenin. Moreover, APCDD1 represses activation of Wnt reporters and target genes, and inhibits the biological effects of Wnt signalling during both the generation of neurons from progenitors in the developing chick nervous system, and axis specification in Xenopus laevis embryos. The mutation Leu9Arg is located in the signal peptide of APCDD1, and perturbs its translational processing from the endoplasmic reticulum to the plasma membrane. APCDD1(L9R) probably functions in a dominant-negative manner to inhibit the stability and membrane localization of the wild-type protein. These findings describe a novel inhibitor of the Wnt signalling pathway with an essential role in human hair growth. As APCDD1 is expressed in a broad repertoire of cell types, our findings indicate that APCDD1 may regulate a diversity of biological processes controlled by Wnt signalling.",M1
20338163,"The hair <e>follicle</e>-a stem cell zoo.Recent studies on stem cells in the adult hair follicle (HF) have uncovered a veritable menagerie of exceptionally diverse and dynamic keratinocytes with stem cell properties located in distinct regions of the HF. Although endowed with specific functions during normal hair follicle maintenance, the majority of these cells can act as multipotent stem cells in stress situations, such as physical injury, which argues for an unanticipated degree of plasticity of these cells. This review provides an overview of the different epithelial stem cell populations, identified in the mouse HF, and their relationships with one another, and envisions possible cellular mechanisms underlying normal HF maintenance and skin regeneration.",M1
20335364,"Abnormal hair <e>follicle</e> development and altered cell fate of follicular keratinocytes in transgenic mice expressing DeltaNp63alpha.The transcription factor p63 plays an essential role in epidermal morphogenesis. Animals lacking p63 fail to form many ectodermal organs, including the skin and hair follicles. Although the indispensable role of p63 in stratified epithelial skin development is well established, relatively little is known about this transcriptional regulator in directing hair follicle morphogenesis. Here, using specific antibodies, we have established the expression pattern of DeltaNp63 in hair follicle development and cycling. DeltaNp63 is expressed in the developing hair placode, whereas in mature hair its expression is restricted to the outer root sheath (ORS), matrix cells and to the stem cells of the hair follicle bulge. To investigate the role of DeltaNp63 in hair follicle morphogenesis and cycling, we have utilized a Tet-inducible mouse model system with targeted expression of this isoform to the ORS of the hair follicle. DeltaNp63 transgenic animals display dramatic defects in hair follicle development and cycling, eventually leading to severe hair loss. Strikingly, expression of DeltaNp63 leads to a switch in cell fate of hair follicle keratinocytes, causing them to adopt an interfollicular epidermal (IFE) cell identity. Moreover, DeltaNp63 transgenic animals exhibit a depleted hair follicle stem-cell niche, which further contributes to the overall cycling defects observed in the mutant animals. Finally, global transcriptome analysis of transgenic skin identified altered expression levels of crucial mediators of hair morphogenesis, including key members of the Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathway, which, in part, account for these effects. Our data provide evidence supporting a role for DeltaNp63alpha in actively suppressing hair follicle differentiation and directing IFE cell lineage commitment.",M1
20308320,"Runx1 directly promotes proliferation of hair <e>follicle</e> stem cells and epithelial tumor formation in mouse skin.Runx1/AML1 is a transcription factor implicated in tissue stem cell regulation and belongs to the small Runx family of cancer genes. In the hair follicle (HF), Runx1 epithelial deletion in morphogenesis impairs normal adult hair homeostasis (cycle) and blocks adult hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) in quiescence. Here, we show that these effects are overcome later in adulthood. By deleting Runx1 after the end of morphogenesis, we demonstrate its direct role in promoting anagen onset and HFSC proliferation. Runx1 deletion resulted in cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor Cdkn1a (p21) upregulation. Interfering with Runx1 function in cultured HFSCs impaired their proliferation and normal G(0)/G1 and G(1)/S cell cycle progression. The proliferation defect could be rescued by Runx1 readdition or by p21 deletion. Chemically induced skin tumorigenesis in mice turned on broad Runx1 expression in regions of the skin epithelium, papillomas, and squamous cell carcinomas. In addition, it revealed reduced rates of tumor formation in the absence of Runx1 that were accompanied by decreased epithelial levels of phospho-Stat3. Runx1 protein expression was similar in normal human and mouse hair cycles. We propose that Runx1 may act as a skin oncogene by directly promoting proliferation of the epithelial cells.",M1
20302576,"Thyrotropin-releasing hormone and oestrogen differentially regulate prolactin and prolactin receptor expression in female human skin and hair <e>follicles</e> in vitro.BACKGROUND: Human skin and scalp hair follicles are both a nonclassical target and an extrapituitary source of prolactin (PRL), which is a potent hair growth modulator. However, how the expression of PRL and PRL receptor (PRLR) is regulated in human skin is unknown. OBJECTIVES: To investigate whether two key stimulators of pituitary PRL secretion, thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) and oestrogen, also regulate cutaneous PRL and PRLR expression. METHODS: Female scalp skin and/or microdissected hair follicles were treated for 6 days in serum-free organ culture with oestrogen (100 nmol L(-1)), TRH (1-10 ng mL(-1), 3-30 nm) or vehicle control. Quantitative immunohistomorphometry of skin and hair follicle sections was complemented with quantitative polymerase chain reaction for PRL and PRLR in cultured hair follicles and/or female human outer root sheath (ORS) keratinocytes. RESULTS: Oestrogen treatment significantly upregulated PRL and PRLR immunoreactivity in selected skin and hair follicle compartments, at the gene and protein level (P &lt; 0.05). TRH significantly increased PRL immunoreactivity and transcription in hair follicles (P &lt; 0.05); however, while it also increased PRLR transcription in hair follicles, it downregulated PRLR immunoreactivity in the hair follicle ORS (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our pilot study shows that two key endocrine controls of pituitary PRL secretion, oestrogen and TRH, also regulate PRL and PRLR expression in human skin. This provides novel insights into the regulation of extrapituitary PRL and PRLR expression, and invites exploration of oestrogen and TRH as novel therapeutic agents in the management of skin and hair diseases characterized by aberrant PRLR-mediated signalling.",M1
20229054,"Differential expression of stem cell markers in human follicular bulge and interfollicular epidermal compartments.Although skin contains a number of stem cell repositories, their characterization has been hindered by a lack of specific markers and an unclear in vivo localization. In this study, we whole mounted single human scalp hair <e>follicles</e> and examined their profiles using in situ immunohistochemistry and multicolor immunofluorescence in search of markers to distinguish between stem cells residing in the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and bulge. Our study revealed that expression of several biomarkers localized uniquely to the basal IFE (CD34 and CD117), bulge region (CD200), or both (CK15, CD49f, and CD29). In addition, we found that both basal IFE and bulge stem cells did not express CD71 or CD24 suggesting their potential utility as negative selection markers. Dermal papilla but not basal IFE or bulge stem cells expressed CD90, making it a potential positive selection marker for dermal hair follicle stem cells. The markers tested in this study may enable pursuit of cell sorting and purification strategies aimed at determining each stem cell population's unique molecular signature.",M1
20227563,"[Intra- and interfamilial phenotype variation in Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome: Consequences for therapy]BACKGROUND: Birt-Hogg-Dubé syndrome (BHDS) is an autosomal-dominantly inherited genodermatosis that predisposes to the development of benign hair <e>follicle</e> tumours, lung cysts, kidney tumours, and possibly colonic cancers, due to mutations in the FLCN gene. We report cases involving a new mutation in three unrelated families. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Blood samples of three probands were submitted for a molecular diagnosis of BHDS. Following DNA extraction, FLCN gene sequencing was performed. The identified mutations were confirmed on a second sample. A cancer genetics consultation was organized and specific tests (dermatological examination, CT scan of chest and abdomen and colonoscopy) were proposed for each BHDS patient. RESULTS: FLCN gene-sequencing analysis revealed an identical complex harmful mutation in all three families. The first proband showed fibrofolliculomas (FF), a history of pneumothorax and colonic adenoma. The mutation was found in a brother and two sisters, who were asymptomatic, and in a niece with FF. The second proband showed FF. The mutation was found in her mother, who had FF. The third proband presented diffuse emphysema and very rare FF. DISCUSSION: This case report shows extremely wide intra- and interfamilial phenotype variation within individuals having a similar FLCN gene mutation. In large cohorts of BHDS patients, no genotype-phenotype correlation has been shown. This case emphasises the vital importance of presymptomatic diagnosis for each member of a BHDS family by means of a cancer genetics consultation, followed by a CT scan of the chest and abdomen, colonoscopy and annual kidney imaging.",M1
20225276,"Nestin-expressing interfollicular blood vessel network contributes to skin transplant survival and wound healing.Using nestin-driven green fluorescent protein (ND-GFP) transgenic mice, we previously demonstrated an inter-hair-<e>follicle</e> blood vessel network that expresses ND-GFP and appears to originate from ND-GFP expressing hair-follicle stem cells. We report here that angiogenesis of transplanted skin or healing wounds originates from this ND-GFP-expressing microvasculature network. ND-GFP-expressing blood vessels were visualized growing from the ND-GFP-expressing hair-follicle stem cell area and re-establishing the dermal microvasculature network after skin transplantation or wound healing. When the ND-GFP stem cell area from the vibrissa (whisker) from ND-GFP mice was transplanted to transgenic mice ubiquitously expressing RFP, we observed chimeric ND-GFP-RFP blood vessels, suggesting the joining of inter-follicular blood vessel networks from the transplant and host. These observations suggest that the inter-hair-follicle blood-vessel network contributes to skin transplant survival and wound healing.",M1
20223988,"Lgr6 marks stem cells in the hair <e>follicle</e> that generate all cell lineages of the skin.Mammalian epidermis consists of three self-renewing compartments: the hair follicle, the sebaceous gland, and the interfollicular epidermis. We generated knock-in alleles of murine Lgr6, a close relative of the Lgr5 stem cell gene. Lgr6 was expressed in the earliest embryonic hair placodes. In adult hair follicles, Lgr6+ cells resided in a previously uncharacterized region directly above the follicle bulge. They expressed none of the known bulge stem cell markers. Prenatal Lgr6+ cells established the hair follicle, sebaceous gland, and interfollicular epidermis. Postnatally, Lgr6+ cells generated sebaceous gland and interfollicular epidermis, whereas contribution to hair lineages gradually diminished with age. Adult Lgr6+ cells executed long-term wound repair, including the formation of new hair follicles. We conclude that Lgr6 marks the most primitive epidermal stem cell.",M1
20214178,"Utilization of a new tissue expander in the closure of a large Mohs surgical defect.BACKGROUND: Malignant proliferating trichilemmal tumor (MPTT) is a rare neoplasm originating in the outer sheath of a hair <e>follicle</e> that often presents as a slowly enlarging, painful, subcutaneous scalp nodule. The authors describe a case of malignant proliferating trichilemmal tumor (MPTT) in an elderly 65-year-old Asian male who presented with a 5.5 x 5.0 cm mass on the posterior scalp. METHODS: The authors present a unique dual approach to treatment of MPTT in both the excision and wound revision phases. First, Mohs micrographic surgery is utilized for more discrete removal of malignant tissue, as opposed to wide excision. Then, a novel device called DermaClose RC is used in wound revision, a device that has proven to be more effective in promoting wound closure than traditional suturing. RESULTS: Mohs micrographic surgery was used to excise the tumor in three stages. The resulting irregular wound measured 6.3 x 5.6 cm, and was repaired with the device. Following the application of the device, the wound reduced in size to 1.5-1.0 cm. Postoperatively, the patient had no evidence of recurrent disease at seven months. CONCLUSION: Use of the DermaClose RC tissue expander following a Mohs surgical procedure provides an effective functional and cosmetic alternative to a skin graft which creates a donor site wound and creates a more complicated, time consuming procedure. The dual approach discussed here-of Mohs micrographic surgery performed in tandem with wound revision via the tissue expanding device is one that may yield promising benefits but warrants further evaluation.",M1
20203417,"Hair growth stimulated by conditioned medium of adipose-derived stem cells is enhanced by hypoxia: evidence of increased growth factor secretion.Adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs) and their secretomes mediate diverse skin-regeneration effects, such as wound-healing and antioxidant protection, that are enhanced by hypoxia. We investigated the hair-growth-promoting effect of conditioned medium (CM) of ADSCs to determine if ADSCs and their secretomes regenerate hair and if hypoxia enhances hair regeneration. If so, we wanted to identify the factors responsible for hypoxia-enhanced hair-regeneration. We found that ADSC-CM administrated subcutaneously induced the anagen phase and increased hair regeneration in C(3)H/NeH mice. In addition, ADSC-CM increased the proliferation of human <e>follicle</e> dermal papilla cells (HFDPCs) and human epithelial keratinocytes (HEKs), which are derived from two major cell types present in hair follicles. We investigated the effect of hypoxia on ADSC function using the same animal model in which hypoxia increased hair regrowth. Forty-one growth factors in ADSC-CM from cells cultured under hypoxic or normoxic conditions were analyzed. The secretion of insulin-like growth factor binding protein (IGFBP)-1, IGFBP-2, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), M-CSF receptor, platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta, and vascular endothelial growth factor was significantly increased by hypoxia, while the secretion of epithelial growth factor production was decreased. It is reasonable to conclude that ADSCs promote hair growth via a paracrine mechanism that is enhanced by hypoxia.",M1
20187446,"[Development of hair <e>follicle</e> stem cells related signal transduction in proliferation and differentiation]OBJECTIVE: To introduce the basic research and clinical potential of the hair follicle stem cells related signal transduction in proliferation and differentiation. METHODS: The recent original articles about the hair follicle stem cells were extensively reviewed. RESULTS: Many different signal pathways had been involved in the skin development and self-newals.The hair follicle stem cells could play an important role in the skin self-renewal and regeneration which were modulated by several different signal pathways, which included bone morphogenetic protein/transforming growth factor beta, Wnt, Notch and ectodysplasin A genes.

20178699,"Does D matter? The role of vitamin D in hair disorders and hair <e>follicle</e> cycling.BACKGROUND: The role of vitamin D in the proliferation and differentiation of keratinocytes is well known within the field of dermatology. OBJECTIVE: We sought to evaluate the role that vitamin D and the vitamin D receptor play in the hair cycle and assess how this can be clinically applied to the treatment of hair disorders. METHODS: A MEDLINE search (1955-July 2009) was preformed to find relevant articles pertaining to vitamin D, the vitamin D receptor, and hair loss. RESULTS: The vitamin D receptor, independent of vitamin D, plays an important role in hair cycling, specifically anagen initiation. The role of vitamin D in hair follicle cycling is not as well understood. LIMITATIONS: The review is broad and there are limited human studies available to date. CONCLUSION: Additional studies to evaluate the role of vitamin D in the hair cycle should be done. Treatments that up regulate the vitamin D receptor may be successful in treating hair disorders and are a potential area of further study.",M1
20178470,"Canine hair-<e>follicle</e> keratinocytes enriched with bulge cells have the highly proliferative characteristic of stem cells.Homeostasis of the epidermis and skin appendages is maintained by tissue-specific stem cells. In mice and humans, two populations of epithelial stem cells have been identified: one in the basal layer of the interfollicular epidermis and another in the bulge area of hair follicles. However, our understanding of canine epithelial stem cells is extremely limited. In this study, in vitro colony-forming assays were performed to locate highly proliferative keratinocytes in canine skin. Their phenotypic resemblance to epithelial stem cells in other species was also assessed. When equal numbers of epidermal or hair-follicle keratinocytes were cultured, colonies derived from follicular keratinocytes were significantly larger both in total numbers and size, than those derived from epidermal keratinocytes. In addition, immunoreactivity for CD34, a putative bulge stem-cell marker in the mouse, was predominantly detected in follicular keratinocytes. Thus in dogs, follicular keratinocytes were distinct from epidermal keratinocytes in proliferative capacity and CD34 expression. Using microdissection, highly proliferative keratinocytes were located within the middle portion of hair follicles, including the bulge area. Immunohistochemical study revealed that keratin 15, an established marker of bulge stem cells in mice and humans, was also predominantly expressed in the canine bulge area. Flow cytometry analysis revealed high numbers of keratin-15-positive cells in the highly proliferative keratinocyte compartment. Of note, keratin 15(high) cells possessed the phenotypic characteristics of putative stem cells. This study represents the first in vitro identification and isolation of highly proliferative canine keratinocytes, which represent candidate epithelial stem cells.",M1
20154679,"Identification of the cell lineage at the origin of basal cell carcinoma.For most types of cancers, the cell at the origin of tumour initiation is still unknown. Here, we used mouse genetics to identify cells at the origin of basal cell carcinoma (BCC), which is one of the most frequently occurring types of cancer in humans, and can result from the activation of the Hedgehog signalling pathway. Using mice conditionally expressing constitutively active Smoothened mutant (SmoM2), we activated Hedgehog signalling in different cellular compartments of the skin epidermis and determined in which compartments Hedgehog activation induces BCC formation. Activation of SmoM2 in hair <e>follicle</e> bulge stem cells and their transient amplifying progenies did not induce cancer formation, demonstrating that BCC does not originate from bulge stem cells, as previously thought. Using clonal analysis, we found that BCC arises from long-term resident progenitor cells of the interfollicular epidermis and the upper infundibulum. Our studies uncover the cells at the origin of BCC in mice and demonstrate that expression of differentiation markers in tumour cells is not necessarily predictive of the cancer initiating cells.",M1

20146380,"Upregulation of genes orchestrating keratinocyte differentiation, including the novel marker gene ID2, by contact sensitizers in human bulge-derived keratinocytes.In the epidermis, keratinocytes are involved in physical and first-line immune protection of the host. In this study, we analyzed the molecular responses to certain contact sensitizers (2,4-dinitrochlorobenzene and NiSO(4)) and irritants (sodium dodecyl sulfate and benzalkonium chloride) in cultured human keratinocytes from the bulge region of a plucked hair <e>follicle</e> (bulge-derived keratinocytes [BDKs]) and compared these molecular responses to those with the human monocytic leukemia cell line, THP-1. The BDKs, individually established without invasive biopsies, showed high reactivity to these stimulants. As a primary response to the contact sensitizers, the NRF2-mediated signaling pathway was upregulated in BDKs and THP-1. The expression of IL1B and IL8 genes was not induced by the irritants but by the sensitizers in THP-1. However, the expression of the IL1B and IL8 genes was induced at higher levels by the irritants in BDKs than by the sensitizers. Many genes orchestrating keratinocyte differentiation, including ID2, were significantly upregulated in response to the sensitizers in BDKs but not those in THP-1. The use of the ID2 gene to discriminate between sensitizers and irritants might be effective as a novel marker for application during in vitro sensitization with BDKs.",M1
20137756,"Infundibulomatosis: a case report with immunohistochemical study and literature review.Tumor of the follicular infundibulum was first described in 1961 by Mehregan and Butler in a patient presenting with multiple papules. It is more frequent, however, as an isolated lesion affecting mainly the face, neck, and upper trunk. Clinical presentation is variable, requiring histology for the diagnosis, which reveals typically a plate-like proliferation of keratinocytes in continuity with the epidermis and hair <e>follicles</e>; some morphological features are reminiscent of the outer root sheath of the hair follicle. A well defined network of elastic fibers surrounding the tumor is usually present using the appropriate staining and this finding is specific because it is not found in other benign follicular tumors. Multiple infundibulomas are usually sporadic and there is no apparent association with internal malignancy. The authors report the case of a 30-year-old female patient with a 5-year history of multiple small discrete hypopigmented macules and papules, scattered over the submental and submaxillary regions and anterior neck. Histopathological findings were consistent with the diagnosis of tumor of the follicular infundibulum. Immunohistochemical study was performed to further characterize the proliferation.",M1
20130590,"Expression of the orphan protein Plet-1 during trichilemmal differentiation of anagen hair <e>follicles</e>.The rat mAb 33A10 recognizes an antigen in a variety of mouse epithelial tissues. In this study, we investigated in detail the expression pattern of the 33A10-defined antigen in the hair follicle. We show that 33A10 reactivity is confined to the most differentiated keratinocytes of the outer root sheath (ORS), the companion layer (CL), and to cells of the sebaceous gland duct. In vitro, the 33A10-defined antigen is expressed in keratinocytes derived from the ORS and accumulates on induction of differentiation. Using microarray analysis and transient transfection approaches, we established that the 33A10-defined antigen is the orphan protein, Placenta-expressed transcript (Plet)-1. Biochemical data indicated that Plet-1 is a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored glycoprotein with N-linked carbohydrates in addition to other posttranslational modifications. Although silencing of Plet-1 expression using stable RNA interference in ORS keratinocytes decreased cellular migration, it increased adhesion to collagens I and IV. Immunohistochemical analysis showed that Plet-1 was primarily localized at the leading edge of epidermal wounds, where keratinocytes contacted the eschar. The restricted localization in both differentiated ORS and CL cells contacting the hair fiber and epidermal wounds suggests a role for the Plet-1 protein in regulating the interaction of keratinocytes with inert tissues.",M1
20110322,"Hair <e>follicle</e> renewal: authentic morphogenesis that depends on a complex progression of stem cell lineages.The hair follicle (HF) grows during the anagen phase from precursors in the matrix that give rise to each differentiated HF layer. Little is known about the lineal relationship between these layer-restricted precursors and HF stem cells. To understand how the HF stem cells regenerate the typical anagen organization, we conducted in vivo clonal analysis of key stages of the HF cycle in mice. Unexpectedly, we found that the pool of HF stem cells contains precursors with both multipotent and restricted contributions. This implies that the lineal relationships between HF stem cells (persisting during telogen) and layer-restricted precursors (in the germinative layer), responsible for HF elongation during anagen, are not stereotyped. Formation of the matrix at each cycle is accompanied by the transient expansion of an intermediary pool of precursors at the origin of the germinative layer and by the progressive restriction of cell dispersion. The regionalization of clonal patterns within the outer HF structure (the outer root sheath) suggests that the position of the precursors might be a crucial factor in determining their fate. The presence of HF stem cells with multipotent contribution and the progressive segregation of HF lineages upon anagen activation indicate that each HF renewal cycle constitutes an authentic morphogenetic process. A comprehensive model was constructed based on the different clonal patterns observed. In this model, the positions of the precursors relative to the dermal papilla together with the progressive restriction of cell dispersion are part of the mechanism that restricts their contribution to the different HF lineages.",M1
20107849,"Vitamin D and the skin.The keratinocytes of the skin are unique in being not only the primary source of vitamin D for the body, but also possessing the enzymatic machinery to metabolize vitamin D to active metabolites [in particular, 1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D (1,25(OH)(2)D)] and the vitamin D receptor (VDR) that enables the keratinocytes to respond to the 1,25(OH)(2)D they produce. Numerous functions of the skin are regulated by vitamin D and/or its receptor: these include inhibition of proliferation, stimulation of differentiation including formation of the permeability barrier, promotion of innate immunity, regulation of the hair <e>follicle</e> cycle, and suppression of tumor formation. Regulation of these actions is exerted by a number of different coregulators including the coactivators DRIP and SRC, a less well known inhibitor, hairless, and beta-catenin. Different coregulators appear to be involved in different VDR-regulated functions. This review examines the various functions of vitamin D and its receptor, and to the extent known explores the mechanisms by which these functions are regulated.",M1
20080498,"Molecular basis for hair loss in mice carrying a novel nonsense mutation (Hrrh-R ) in the hairless gene (Hr).Animal models carrying mutations in the hairless (Hr) gene provide a rich resource for study of hair <e>follicle</e> biology. A spontaneous mouse mutant with a phenotype strikingly similar to rhino mutants of Hr arose spontaneously in the mouse facility at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Sequence analysis of Hr in these mutants uncovered a nonsense mutation in exon 12, designated as Hr(rh-R) (rhino, Oak Ridge). The mutation led to significant reduction in Hr mRNA levels, predicted to be due to nonsense-mediated decay. Histological analysis indicated dilated hair follicle infundibula at 14 days of age that rapidly became filled with cornified material. Microarray analyses revealed that expression levels of many genes involved in keratinocyte differentiation, epidermal regeneration, and wound healing were significantly upregulated before morphological detection of the phenotype, suggesting their role in onset of the Hr(rh-R) phenotype. Identification of this new Hr allele and the underlying molecular alterations allows further understanding of the role of Hr in hair follicle biology.",M1
20071778,"Neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein modulates Wnt signaling and is required for hair <e>follicle</e> cycling in mice.The Rho family GTPases Cdc42 and Rac1 are critical regulators of the actin cytoskeleton and are essential for skin and hair function. Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome family proteins act downstream of these GTPases, controlling actin assembly and cytoskeletal reorganization, but their role in epithelial cells has not been characterized in vivo. Here, we used a conditional knockout approach to assess the role of neural Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein (N-WASP), the ubiquitously expressed Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome-like (WASL) protein, in mouse skin. We found that N-WASP deficiency in mouse skin led to severe alopecia, epidermal hyperproliferation, and ulceration, without obvious effects on epidermal differentiation and wound healing. Further analysis revealed that the observed alopecia was likely the result of a progressive and ultimately nearly complete block in hair follicle (HF) cycling by 5 months of age. N-WASP deficiency also led to abnormal proliferation of skin progenitor cells, resulting in their depletion over time. Furthermore, N-WASP deficiency in vitro and in vivo correlated with decreased GSK-3beta phosphorylation, decreased nuclear localization of beta-catenin in follicular keratinocytes, and decreased Wnt-dependent transcription. Our results indicate a critical role for N-WASP in skin function and HF cycling and identify a link between N-WASP and Wnt signaling. We therefore propose that N-WASP acts as a positive regulator of beta-catenin-dependent transcription, modulating differentiation of HF progenitor cells.",M1
20060689,"c-Maf and MafB transcription factors are differentially expressed in Huxley's and Henle's layers of the inner root sheath of the hair <e>follicle</e> and regulate cuticle formation.BACKGROUND: The hair follicle of mammalian skin consists of a group of concentric epithelial cell layers. The inner root sheath (IRS), which surrounds the hardening hair shaft beneath the skin surface, is subdivided into three layers, termed the cuticle of the IRS, Huxley's layer, and Henle's layer. The IRS forms a follicular wall in the hair canal and helps guide the developing hair shaft. c-Maf and MafB, members of the Maf family of transcription factors, play important roles in the developmental processes of various tissues and in cell type-specific gene expression. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study is to reveal the pattern of expression and functional roles of c-Maf and MafB in the hair follicle. METHODS: We determined the precise location of c-Maf and MafB expression using immunofluorescent staining of mouse skin sections with layer-specific markers. We also analyzed whiskers of c-maf- and mafB-null mice (c-maf(-/-) and mafB(-/-), respectively) using scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: c-Maf and MafB were differentially expressed in the Huxley's and Henle's layers of the IRS. Scanning electron microscopic analysis showed irregular cuticle patterning of whiskers of c-maf(-/-) and mafB(-/-) mice. The cuticles of mafB(-/-) mice were also thinner than those of wild-type mice. CONCLUSION: c-Maf and MafB are expressed in the IRS layers in a lineage-restricted manner and are involved in hair morphogenesis.",M1
20060271,"Cutaneous consequences of inhibiting EGF receptor signaling in vivo: normal hair <e>follicle</e> development, but retarded hair cycle induction and inhibition of adipocyte growth in Egfr(Wa5) mice.BACKGROUND: The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) network is essential for proper development and homeostasis of skin and hair. However, detailed dissection of the role of the EGFR in hair follicle development and cycling have been impaired by the early mortality of EGFR knockout mice. OBJECTIVES: We have studied in Waved-5 mice carrying an antimorphic EGFR allele (Egfr(wa5)), whose product acts as a dominant-negative receptor, whether strongly reduced EGFR signaling impacts on the hair and skin phenotype. METHODS: Histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry were employed to study hair follicle morphogenesis stages and cycle induction in Waved-5 mice and control littermates during embryonic development and postnatal life. RESULTS: By routine histology and quantitative histomorphometry, no significant abnormalities in the epidermis and in hair follicle morphogenesis were detected, while the initiation of hair follicle cycling was slightly, but significantly retarded. Proliferation and apoptosis of epidermal and hair matrix keratinocytes of Waved-5 mice appeared unaltered. Intriguingly, the thickness of the subcutis and the percentage of proliferating subcutaneous adipocytes were significantly reduced in Waved-5 mice around days P8.5 to P10.5. Although no differences in total body weight gain could be detected, Wa5 mice showed a significant reduction in the percentage of body fat at P8.5. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the presence of effective compensatory mechanisms in murine skin in vivo that ensure nearly normal epidermal and hair follicle keratinocyte function despite very low levels of EGFR-mediated signaling. Our unexpected findings of transiently reduced subcutaneous adipose tissue indicate a role for the EGFR in regulating subcutaneous fat.",M1
20060268,"Targeting to the hair <e>follicles</e>: current status and potential.The pilosebaceous unit is a complex structure that undergoes a specific growth cycle and comprises a few important drug targeting sites. For example, drugs can be targeted to the bulge region with stem cells or to the sebaceous glands. Interest in pilosebaceous units is directed towards their utilization as reservoirs for localized therapy and also as a transport pathway for systemic drug delivery. Improved investigative methods, such as differential stripping, are being developed in order to determine follicular penetration. This article reviews relevant aspects of effective follicle-targeting formulations and delivery systems as well as the activity status of hair follicles, and variations in follicle size and distribution throughout various body regions. Each of these factors strongly affects follicular permeation. We provide examples of improved penetration of particle-based formulations and of a size-dependent manner of follicular penetration. Contradictions are also discussed, indicating the need for detailed future investigations.",M1
20050020,"Hedgehog signaling maintains hair <e>follicle</e> stem cell phenotype in young and aged human skin.Skin hair follicles (HF) contain bulge stem cells (SC) that regenerate HFs during hair cycles, and repair skin epithelia following injury. As natural aging is associated with decreased skin repair capacity in humans, we have investigated the impact of age on human scalp HF bulge cell number and function. Here, we isolated human bulge cells, characterized as CD200+/KRT15+/KRT19+ cells of the HF, by dissection-combined CD200 selection in young and aged human skin. Targeted transcriptional profiling indicates that KRT15, KRT19, Dkk3, Dkk4, Tcf3, S100A4, Gas1, EGFR and CTGF/CCN2 are also preferentially expressed by human bulge cells, compared to differentiated HF keratinocytes (KC). Our results demonstrate that aging does not alter expression or localization of these HF SC markers. In addition, we could not detect significant differences in HF density or bulge cell number between young and aged human scalp skin. Interestingly, hedgehog (Hh) signaling is activated in human bulge cells in vivo, and down-regulated in differentiated HF KCs, both in young and aged skin. In addition, activation of Hh signaling by lentivirus-mediated overexpression of transcription factor Gli1 induces transcription of HF SC markers KRT15, KRT19, and Gas1, in cultured KCs. Together with previously reported knock-out mouse results, these data suggest a role for Hh signaling in maintaining bulge cell phenotype in young and aged human skin.",M1
20049729,"Epidermal stem cell diversity and quiescence.Mammalian epidermis is maintained by self-renewal of stem cells and terminal differentiation of their progeny. New data reveal a diversity amongst stem cells that was previously unrecognized. Different stem cell populations have different locations and differ in whether they are quiescent or actively cycling. During normal epidermal homeostasis, each stem cell population feeds a restricted number of differentiated lineages. However, in response to injury or genetic manipulation the different pools of stem cells demonstrate multi-lineage differentiation ability. While it is well established that Wnt signalling promotes hair <e>follicle</e> (HF) differentiation, new observations suggest a role for EGF receptor signalling in promoting differentiation of interfollicular epidermis. NFATc1 maintains quiescence in the HF, while Lrig1 exerts the same function in the junctional zone. The stage is now set for exploring the relationship between the different epidermal stem cell populations and between quiescence and lineage selection.",M1
20043013,"Corticotropin-releasing hormone stimulates the in situ generation of mast cells from precursors in the human hair <e>follicle</e> mesenchyme.Hair follicles (HFs) maintain a peripheral, functional equivalent of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, whose most proximal element is corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH). The mast cell (MC)-rich connective-tissue sheath (CTS) of mouse vibrissa HFs harbors MC precursors. Differentiation of these MC precursors into mature MCs can be induced by stem cell factor (SCF). We have investigated whether the MC progenitors of normal human scalp HF CTS respond to stimulation with CRH. Microdissected anagen HFs and full-thickness scalp skin were treated with CRH (10(-7) M). CRH treatment induced the degranulation of CTS MCs, in addition to increasing the number of CTS MCs in full-thickness skin and HF organ cultures in situ. In the latter, cells with characteristic MC features emigrated from the CTS. CRH-receptor protein expression in the CTS was colocalized with Kit expression on some CTS MCs in situ. CRH treatment upregulated SCF mRNA and protein expression within the HF epithelium. In skin organ culture, CRH-induced degranulation of CTS MCs was abolished by anti-SCF antibody. We demonstrate that human skin is an extramedullary reservoir for MC precursors, and we have identified a regulatory loop between CRH and SCF signaling. This highlights a previously unpublished finding about neuroendocrine control of human MC biology.",M1
20032992,"Sebum free fatty acids enhance the innate immune defense of human sebocytes by upregulating beta-defensin-2 expression.Various sebum free fatty acids (FFAs) have shown antibacterial activity against a broad range of gram-positive bacteria, resulting in the suggestion that they are accountable, at least partially, for the direct antimicrobial activity of the skin surface. In this study, we examined the effects of sebum FFAs on the antimicrobial peptide (AMP)-mediated innate immune defense of human sebocytes. Incubation of lauric acid, palmitic acid, or oleic acid (OA) with human sebocytes dramatically enhanced their expression of human beta-defensin (hBD)-2, one of the predominant AMPs found in the skin, whereas remarkable increases in hBD-1, hBD-3, and human cathelicidin LL-37 were not observed. Secreted hBD-2 was detectable by western blotting in the supernatant of sebocyte culture incubated with each FFA, but not with a vehicle control. The supernatant of FFA-incubated sebocyte culture showed antimicrobial activity against Propionibacterium acnes, whereas the enhanced antimicrobial activity of human sebocytes was neutralized by anti-hBD-2 IgG. In addition, the FFA-induced hBD-2 expression was suppressed by blocking the cluster of differentiation (CD)36 fatty acid translocase on the surface of sebocytes with anti-human CD36 IgG or blocking the NF-kappaB signaling pathway with BMS-345541, a highly selective inhibitor of inhibitory kappaB kinase. These data suggest that sebum FFAs upregulate the expression of hBD-2 in human sebocytes, which may enhance the disinfecting activity of the human sebaceous gland. The FFA-induced upregulation of hBD-2 is facilitated by CD36-mediated FFA uptake and NF-kappaB-mediated transactivation. The upregulation of mouse beta-defensin 4, a mouse ortholog for hBD-2, was also observed in the hair <e>follicle</e> sebaceous glands of mouse ear skin after an epicutaneous application of OA, the most hBD-2-inducible FFA tested. This report highlights the potential of using FFAs as a multifunctional antimicrobial therapy agent for acne vulgaris treatment; FFAs may provide direct antibacterial activities against P. acnes and enhance the skin's innate antibacterial defense by inducing the expression of hBD-2 in sebocytes as well.",M1
20022473,"Review of hair <e>follicle</e> dermal cells.Hair follicle stem cells in the epithelial bulge are responsible for the continual regeneration of the hair follicle during cycling. The bulge cells reside in a niche composed of dermal cells. The dermal compartment of the hair follicle consists of the dermal papilla and dermal sheath. Interactions between hair follicle epithelial and dermal cells are necessary for hair follicle morphogenesis during development and in hair reconstitution assays. Dermal papilla and dermal sheath cells express specific markers and possess distinctive morphology and behavior in culture. These cells can induce hair follicle differentiation in epithelial cells and are required in hair reconstitution assays either in the form of intact tissue, dissociated freshly prepared cells or cultured cells. This review will focus on hair follicle dermal cells since most therapeutic efforts to date have concentrated on this aspect of the hair follicle, with the idea that enriching hair-inductive dermal cell populations and expanding their number by culture while maintaining their properties, will establish an efficient hair reconstitution assay that could eventually have therapeutic implications.",M1
20021572,"Effects of transient receptor potential (TRP) channel agonists and antagonists on slowly adapting type II mechanoreceptors in the rat sinus hair <e>follicle</e>.The possible functional role of transient receptor potential (TRP) channels was investigated by testing various TRP agonists and antagonists in an isolated rat sinus hair follicle preparation. Extracellular recordings from slowly adapting type II mechanoreceptor units were made. The antagonist capsazepine depressed spontaneous and mechanically evoked activity, with an IC(50) of 82 microM. In one-third of units, capsazepine caused a selective depression of mechanically evoked firing, such that the existing spontaneous firing was interrupted by an absence of activity during the mechanical stimulus. The broad spectrum TRP blocker ruthenium red (30 microM) had inconsistent effects, although in some units a delayed onset (following wash) bursting and paroxysmal firing ensued. The agonist icilin (50-100 microM) had an excitatory effect on spontaneous firing, and (-)-menthol (200 microM) had inconsistent effects. Cinnamaldehyde (1-2 mM) depressed all types of activity equally, mechanically evoked and spontaneous. Camphor (0.5-2 mM) also depressed all types of activity, although it had a preferential effect on spontaneous activity. Capsaicin (1-10 microM) and allyl isothiocyanate (50-100 microM) had no clear effects. These results rule out any role for TRPA1 and TRPV1 channels in mechanotransduction processes of slowly adapting type II mechanoreceptors.",M1
20016249,"Effect of helium-neon laser irradiation on hair <e>follicle</e> growth cycle of Swiss albino mice.We report the results of a study carried out to investigate the effect of helium-neon (He-Ne) laser (632.8 nm) irradiation on the hair follicle growth cycle of testosterone-treated and untreated mice. Both histology and optical coherence tomography (OCT) were used for the measurement of hair follicle length and the relative percentage of hair follicles in different growth phases. A positive correlation (R = 0.96) was observed for the lengths of hair follicles measured by both methods. Further, the ratios of the lengths of hair follicles in the anagen and catagen phases obtained by both methods were nearly the same. However, the length of the hair follicles measured by both methods differed by a factor of 1.6, with histology showing smaller lengths. He-Ne laser irradiation (at approximately 1 J/cm(2)) of the skin of both the control and the testosterone-treated mice was observed to lead to a significant increase (p &lt; 0.05) in % anagen, indicating stimulation of hair growth. The study also demonstrates that OCT can be used to monitor the hair follicle growth cycle, and thus hair follicle disorders or treatment efficacy during alopecia.",M1
20016073,"N-WASP is a novel regulator of hair-<e>follicle</e> cycling that controls antiproliferative TGF{beta} pathways.N-WASP is a cytoplasmic molecule mediating Arp2/3 nucleated actin polymerization. Mice with a keratinocyte-specific deletion of the gene encoding N-WASP showed normal interfollicular epidermis, but delayed hair-follicle morphogenesis and abnormal hair-follicle cycling, associated with cyclic alopecia and prolonged catagen and telogen phases. The delayed anagen onset correlated with an increased expression of the cell-cycle inhibitor p21CIP, and increased activity of the TGFbeta pathway, a known inducer of p21CIP expression. Primary N-WASP-null keratinocytes showed reduced growth compared with control cells and enhanced expression of the gene encoding the cell-cycle inhibitor p15INK4B, a TGFbeta target gene. Inhibition of TGFbeta signaling blocked overexpression of p15INK4B and restored proliferation of N-WASP-deficient keratinocytes in vitro. However, induction of N-WASP gene deletion in vitro did not result in obvious changes in TGFbeta signaling or growth of keratinocytes, indicating that the in vivo environment is required for the phenotype development. These data identify the actin nucleation regulator N-WASP as a novel element of hair-cycle control that modulates the antiproliferative and pro-apoptotic TGFbeta pathway in keratinocytes in vivo and in vitro.",M1
19956733,"Palmitoylation regulates epidermal homeostasis and hair <e>follicle</e> differentiation.Palmitoylation is a key post-translational modification mediated by a family of DHHC-containing palmitoyl acyl-transferases (PATs). Unlike other lipid modifications, palmitoylation is reversible and thus often regulates dynamic protein interactions. We find that the mouse hair loss mutant, depilated, (dep) is due to a single amino acid deletion in the PAT, Zdhhc21, resulting in protein mislocalization and loss of palmitoylation activity. We examined expression of Zdhhc21 protein in skin and find it restricted to specific hair lineages. Loss of Zdhhc21 function results in delayed hair shaft differentiation, at the site of expression of the gene, but also leads to hyperplasia of the interfollicular epidermis (IFE) and sebaceous glands, distant from the expression site. The specific delay in follicle differentiation is associated with attenuated anagen propagation and is reflected by decreased levels of Lef1, nuclear beta-catenin, and Foxn1 in hair shaft progenitors. In the thickened basal compartment of mutant IFE, phospho-ERK and cell proliferation are increased, suggesting increased signaling through EGFR or integrin-related receptors, with a parallel reduction in expression of the key differentiation factor Gata3. We show that the Src-family kinase, Fyn, involved in keratinocyte differentiation, is a direct palmitoylation target of Zdhhc21 and is mislocalized in mutant follicles. This study is the first to demonstrate a key role for palmitoylation in regulating developmental signals in mammalian tissue homeostasis.",M1
19955877,"Spectrum of follicular and sebaceous differentiation induced by dermatofibroma.BACKGROUND: The term  induction  has been used to designate epidermal changes above dermatofibroma. Whereas follicular differentiation has been reported frequently, sebaceous hyperplasia above dermatofibroma is considered a rarity. OBJECTIVE: To characterize all changes overlying dermatofibroma and to determine their frequency. METHODS: Sections cut from 210 consecutive examples of dermatofibroma were stained with hematoxylin and eosin and analyzed for the presence or absence of induction, for the type of change induced, and for features associated with these findings. RESULTS: The epidermis above dermatofibromas was acanthotic, simulating seborrheic keratosis in 62.9% of the cases, and areas of clear and pale cells similar to those of clear cell acanthoma were seen in 18.6%. Induction of adnexal differentiation was encountered in 41% of the cases. Follicular differentiation was seen in 10.9%, all of which showed some follicular germinative cells. In 9.5%, follicular germinative cells were present together with well-circumscribed mesenchymal papillae. In 4%, formation of a complete hair <e>follicle</e> was encountered. In 16.7% of the dermatofibromas, induction of sebaceous lobules was encountered, whereas sebaceous differentiation in the form of mantles was seen in 25.7% of the cases. Not uncommonly, sebaceous structures were arranged in a reticulate pattern similar to that seen in reticulated acanthoma with sebaceous differentiation (12%). CONCLUSIONS: Induction of adnexal structures is more common than currently perceived. Especially, induction of immature and mature sebaceous structures seems to be underrecognized.",M1
19951689,"SKPs derive from hair <e>follicle</e> precursors and exhibit properties of adult dermal stem cells.Despite the remarkable regenerative capacity of mammalian skin, an adult dermal stem cell has not yet been identified. Here, we investigated whether skin-derived precursors (SKPs) might fulfill such a role. We show that SKPs derive from Sox2(+) hair follicle dermal cells and that these two cell populations are similar with regard to their transcriptome and functional properties. Both clonal SKPs and endogenous Sox2(+) cells induce hair morphogenesis, differentiate into dermal cell types, and home to a hair follicle niche upon transplantation. Moreover, hair follicle-derived SKPs self-renew, maintain their multipotency, and serially reconstitute hair follicles. Finally, grafting experiments show that follicle-associated dermal cells move out of their niche to contribute cells for dermal maintenance and wound-healing. Thus, SKPs derive from Sox2(+) follicle-associated dermal precursors and display functional properties predicted of a dermal stem cell, contributing to dermal maintenance, wound-healing, and hair follicle morphogenesis.",M1
19944990,"Perioral wrinkles: histologic differences between men and women.BACKGROUND: Women tend to develop more and deeper wrinkles in the perioral region than men. Although much is known about the complex mechanisms involved in skin aging, previous studies have described histologic differences between men and women with respect to skin aging only incidentally and have not investigated the perioral region. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to investigate gender-specific differences in the perioral skin. METHODS: To determine wrinkle severity, skin surface replicas of the upper lip region in 10 male and 10 female fresh cadavers were analyzed by using the dermaTOP blue three-dimensional digitizing system (Breuckmann, Meersburg, Germany). In 30 fresh male and female cadavers, three full-thickness lip resections were investigated in a blinded fashion for specific histologic features. All results were statistically analyzed in a linear regression model with SPSS software (version 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL). RESULTS: The female replicas showed more and deeper wrinkles than the male replicas (P &lt; .01). Histologic analysis revealed that the perioral skin of men displayed a significantly higher number of sebaceous glands (P = .000; 95% confidence interval [CI] 23.6-53.2), sweat glands (P = .002; 95% CI 2.1-8.1), and a higher ratio between vessel area and connective tissue area in the dermis (P = .009; 95% CI 0.003-0.021). The amount of hair <e>follicles</e> did not significantly differ between men and women, although the average number of sebaceous glands per hair follicle was greater in men (P = .002; 95% CI 0.33-1.28). CONCLUSIONS: Women exhibit more and deeper wrinkles in the perioral region and their skin contains a significantly smaller number of appendages than men, which could be a feasible explanation for why women are more susceptible to development of perioral wrinkles.",M1

Nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells appear in the hair follicular stem cell area, the permanent upper hair follicle immediately below the sebaceous glands and above the bulge area. The nestin-expressing hair follicle stem cells can differentiate into neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro. Furthermore, the hair follicle stem cells promote the recovery of peripheral nerve and spinal cord injury. We have termed these cells hair follicle pluripotent stem (hfPS) cells. These results suggest that hfPS cells provide an important accessible, autologous source of adult stem cells with potential for use in regenerative medicine.",M1

From this structure, cells with stem characteristics were isolated: they have a mesenchymal origin and express CD90 protein, a typical marker of mesenchymal stem cells. It is not yet really clear in which region of hair follicle these cells are located but some experimental evidence suggests that dermal stem cells are localized prevalently in the lower part of the anagen hair follicle. As there are no data available regarding DS stem cells in dog species, we carried out a morphological analysis of the hair follicle DS and performed both an immunohistochemical and an immunocytochemical investigation to identify CD90+ cells. We immunohistochemically evidenced a clear and abundant positivity to CD90 protein in the DS cells located in the lower part of anagen hair follicle. The positive cells showed a typical fibroblast-like morphology. They were flat and elongated and inserted among bundles of collagen fibres. The whole structure formed a close and continuous sleeve around the anagen hair follicle. Our immunocytochemical study allowed us to localize CD90 protein at the cytoplasmic membrane level.",M1

OBJECTIVES: To characterize eyelash follicle growth, cycle and morphology, and further investigate the biological mechanisms that determine eyelash length, curl and pigmentation, compared with scalp hair follicle. METHODS: Twenty-nine caucasian female volunteers aged between 26 and 60 years were enrolled in the study to provide eyelashes. Four of these volunteers were followed weekly for 9 months to characterize their eyelash cycle. Eyelash length and time of renewal were measured using a high-resolution camera and image analysis. Immunohistological study of the bulbs were performed on eyelid biopsies from 17 patients requiring block excision for ectropion repair. RESULTS: The calculated durations of anagen phase and complete cycle of the eyelashes were 34 + or - 9 and 90 + or - 5 days, respectively. Eyelash follicle growth rate was quite variable, with an average rate of 0.12 + or - 0.05 mm daily. Eyelash follicle morphology was very close to that of the scalp hair follicle, but some remarkable differences were noticed. For example, the K19-positive epithelial stem cell population was spread all along the follicle and not split into two reservoirs as seen in scalp hair follicles. Some asymmetry was detected in HSPG and CSPG, as well as K38 (formerly Ha8) and K82 (formerly Hb2) distribution, similar to that observed in curly hair. Finally, dopachrome tautomerase was found expressed in eyelash follicle melanocytes, while it was strikingly absent in scalp hair follicle melanocytes.

The rats in scald group and treatment group were subjected to 30% TBSA partial thickness scald on the back, and were resuscitated with balanced solution after 1 hour, while those in sham group were immersed in water at 37 degrees C for 25 s to simulate scald, and did not receive fluid replacement. Rats in treatment group were intraperitoneally injected with 10 mg/kg melatonin solution at 1 minute, 8 hours and 12 hours after scald, while those in sham group and scald group were given equal volume of 1% alcohol sodium-isotonic saline instead. Tissue samples were harvested at 6, 12 and 24 post scald hours (PSH) for determination of MDA and GSH levels. Apoptosis of residul hair follicle was detected by TUNEL method and immunohistochemistry of caspase-3. RESULTS: The level of MDA in scald group at each time point was much higher than that in sham group (P &lt; 0.01) and treatment group (P &lt; 0.05), and it peaked at 12 PSH. The changes in GSH were just opposite to that of MDA. Under fluorescence microscope, the residual hair follicle cells were blue, and the apoptotic cells appeared green. The apoptosis rate in scald group at 6, 12, 24 PSH was obviously higher than that in sham (P &lt; 0.01) and treatment groups (P &lt; 0.05), which was (20.2 +/- 3.4)% vs (4.3 +/- 2.3)% vs (10.9 +/- 3.2)%, (31.2 +/- 3.6)% vs (5.1 +/- 2.5)% vs (19.1 +/- 3.7)%, (22.4 +/- 2.7)% vs (4.1 +/- 2.4)% vs (13.1 +/- 3.4)%, respectively. The score of caspase-3 positive cell in scald group was higher than those in sham group (P &lt; 0.01) and treatment group (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: There is obvious correlation between oxidative stress and apoptosis rate of hair follicle cells in rats with partial thickness scald. Early administration of melatonin may have anti-apoptosis ability for residual hair follicle cells by attenuation of oxidative stress.",M1
19793306,"Hereditary hair loss and the ancient signaling pathways that regulate ectodermal appendage formation.All epidermal appendages, including hair, teeth, and nails, begin as a thickening of the ectoderm, called a placode. The placode arises from a primary induction signal that is sent from the underlying mesenchyme to the overlying epidermis. In mammals, the precise arrangement of hair <e>follicles</e> in the skin is due to the amount and distribution of signals that promote and inhibit hair placode formation. Continued development of a hair follicle after placode formation requires a complex cross-talk between the mesenchyme and epidermis. Here, I will review recent studies in humans and mice that have increased our understanding of the role of these signaling pathways in normal development and in hereditary hair loss syndromes. The study of normal hair development may suggest ways to restore or eliminate hair and might identify possible targets for the therapy of basal cell carcinoma, a cancer which strongly resembles embryonic hair follicles.",M1
19761392,"Hair <e>follicle</e> neogenesis induced by cultured human scalp dermal papilla cells.AIM: To develop a method by which human hair follicle dermal papilla (DP) cells can be expanded in vitro while preserving their hair-inductive potential for use in follicular cell implantation, a cellular therapy for the treatment of hair loss. MATERIALS &amp; METHODS: DP cells were isolated from scalp hair follicles in biopsies from human donors. DP cell cultures were established under conditions that preserved their hair-inductive potential and allowed for significant expansion. The hair-inductive potential of cells cultured for approximately 36 doublings was tested in an in vivo flap-graft model. In some experiments, DiI was used to label cells prior to grafting. RESULTS: Under the culture conditions developed, cultures established from numerous donors reproducibly resulted in an expansion that averaged approximately five population doublings per passage. Furthermore, the cells consistently induced hair formation in an in vivo graft assay. Grafted DP cells appeared in DP structures of newly formed hairs, as well as in the dermal sheath and in the dermis surrounding follicles. Induced hair follicles persisted and regrew after being plucked 11 months after grafting. CONCLUSION: A process for the propagation of human DP cells has been developed that provides significant expansion of cells and maintenance of their hair-inductive capability, overcoming a major technical obstacle in the development of follicular cell implantation as a treatment for hair loss.",M1
19750535,"Nonviral in situ green fluorescent protein labeling and culture of primary, adult human hair <e>follicle</e> epithelial progenitor cells.In this article we show that cloning of the human K15 promoter before a green fluorescence protein (GFP)/geneticin-resistance cassette and transfection of microdissected, organ-cultured adult human scalp hair follicles generates specific K15 promoter-driven GFP expression in their stem cell-rich bulge region. K15-GFP+ cells can be visualized in situ by GFP fluorescence and 2-photon laser scanning microscopy. Vital K15-GFP+ progenitor cells can then be selected by using the criteria of their green fluorescence, adhesion to collagen type IV and fibronectin, and geneticin resistance. Propagated K15-GFP+ cells express epithelial progenitor markers, show the expected differential gene expression profile of human bulge epithelium, and form holoclones. This application of nonretroviral, K15 promoter-driven, GFP labeling to adult human hair follicles facilitates the characterization and manipulation of human epithelial stem cells, both in situ and in vitro, and should be transferable to other complex human tissues.",M1
19733540,"mTOR mediates Wnt-induced epidermal stem cell exhaustion and aging.Epidermal integrity is a complex process established during embryogenesis and maintained throughout the organism lifespan by epithelial stem cells. Although Wnt regulates normal epithelial stem cell renewal, aberrant Wnt signaling can contribute to cancerous growth. Here, we explored the consequences of persistent expressing Wnt1 in an epidermal compartment that includes the epithelial stem cells. Surprisingly, Wnt caused the rapid growth of the hair <e>follicles</e>, but this was followed by epithelial cell senescence, disappearance of the epidermal stem cell compartment, and progressive hair loss. Although Wnt1 induced the activation of beta-catenin and the mTOR pathway, both hair follicle hyperproliferation and stem cell exhaustion were strictly dependent on mTOR function. These findings suggest that whereas activation of beta-catenin contributes to tumor growth, epithelial stem cells may be endowed with a protective mechanism that results in cell senescence upon the persistent stimulation of proliferative pathways that activate mTOR, ultimately suppressing tumor formation.",M1
19730084,"A revaluation of trichofolliculoma: the histopathological and immunohistochemical features.Few investigations on the histopathology of trichofolliculoma (TF) have so far included an immunohistochemical study. To seek new insight into TF with a revaluation of the histopathological features and an investigation of the immunohistochemical profile, 14 TFs were revaluated for the histopathology and the immunohistochemical profile of various cytokeratins (CKs), hair <e>follicle</e> stem cell markers, and others. The CK15 expression was upregulated in the basal cells from the primary cystic structures beyond to secondary follicles without expression of CK19. CK16 and CK17 were positive in the suprabasal cells of the primary cystic structures and the immature secondary hair follicles. No exact isthmus/bulge region was seen in the anagen secondary hair follicles, and newly developed (tertiary) hair follicles arose randomly from the involuting secondary follicles. Ber EP4 expression was generally weakened in the secondary or tertiary hair germ-like structures. The size of secondary hair follicles varied from vellus hair follicles to terminal hair follicles, even though no lesions located on the regions where the terminal hairs develop were included in this study. S-100 protein-positive wavy spindle cells were accidentally found in the surrounding connective tissue of the secondary follicles in 2 TF lesions. TFs were characterized by the proliferation of abnormal CK15-positive hair follicle stem cells, which basically differentiated toward the outer root sheath and attempting to make hair but losing the proper differentiation. The control of the size of the anagen hair follicles and the regular hair cycle were also disordered.",M1
19726344,"[Histocompatibility of a polypropylene matrix for hair <e>follicle</e> transplantation in rabbits]OBJECTIVE: To observe the histocompatibility of a polypropylene matrix implanted subcutaneously for potential hair follicle transplantation in rabbits. METHODS: The polypropylene matrix for harboring the hair follicles was prepared and implanted subcutaneously at the neck of 5 New Zealand white rabbits by means of hair follicle unit transplantation. At 1 week after the transplantation and then on a monthly basis in the following 6 months, full-thickness skin tissues were sampled at the site of grafting to evaluate the histocompatibility of the matrix material using HE staining and scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: At 1 week after implantation of the matrix material, a small number of inflammatory cells and lymphocytic infiltration were observed around the graft, with mild hyperemia in the proliferative capillaries and mild inflammatory responses. In the following 6 months, the inflammatory cells and lymphocytes around the graft decreased obviously or even disappeared, and such graft rejection responses as tissue lysis and necrosis were not observed. A large quantity of collagen fibers were found to encapsulate the polypropylene material. CONCLUSION: Polypropylene matrix graft has good histocompatibility with the rabbit subcutaneous tissue without producing obvious graft rejection responses, suggesting its feasibility for further experiments of hair follicle transplantation.",M1
19725870,"Methods in hair research: how to objectively distinguish between anagen and catagen in human hair <e>follicle</e> organ culture.The organ culture of human scalp hair follicles (HFs) is the best currently available assay for hair research in the human system. In order to determine the hair growth-modulatory effects of agents in this assay, one critical read-out parameter is the assessment of whether the test agent has prolonged anagen duration or induced catagen in vitro. However, objective criteria to distinguish between anagen VI HFs and early catagen in human HF organ culture, two hair cycle stages with a deceptively similar morphology, remain to be established. Here, we develop, document and test an objective classification system that allows to distinguish between anagen VI and early catagen in organ-cultured human HFs, using both qualitative and quantitative parameters that can be generated by light microscopy or immunofluorescence. Seven qualitative classification criteria are defined that are based on assessing the morphology of the hair matrix, the dermal papilla and the distribution of pigmentary markers (melanin, gp100). These are complemented by ten quantitative parameters. We have tested this classification system by employing the clinically used topical hair growth inhibitor, eflornithine, and show that eflornithine indeed produces the expected premature catagen induction, as identified by the novel classification criteria reported here. Therefore, this classification system offers a standardized, objective and reproducible new experimental method to reliably distinguish between human anagen VI and early catagen HFs in organ culture.",M1
19718024,"Tissue regenerative delays and synthetic lethality in adult mice after combined deletion of Atr and Trp53.Trp53 loss of function has previously been shown to rescue tissue maintenance and developmental defects resulting from DNA damage or DNA-repair gene mutations. Here, we report that p53 deficiency severely exacerbates tissue degeneration caused by mosaic deletion of the essential genome maintenance regulator Atr. Combined loss of Atr and p53 (Trp53(-/-)Atr(mKO)) led to severe defects in hair <e>follicle</e> regeneration, localized inflammation (Mac1(+)Gr1(+) infiltrates), accelerated deterioration of the intestinal epithelium and synthetic lethality in adult mice. Tissue degeneration in Trp53(-/-)Atr(mKO) mice was characterized by the accumulation of cells maintaining high levels of DNA damage. Moreover, the elevated frequency of these damaged cells in both progenitor and downstream compartments in Trp53(-/-)Atr(mKO) skin coincided with delayed compensatory tissue renewal from residual ATR-expressing cells. Together, our results indicate that the combined loss of Atr and Trp53 in adult mice leads to the accumulation of highly damaged cells, which, consequently, impose a barrier to regeneration from undamaged progenitors.",M1

19700758,"Bone morphogenetic protein antagonist noggin promotes skin tumorigenesis via stimulation of the Wnt and Shh signaling pathways.Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) play pivotal roles in the regulation of skin development. To study the role of BMPs in skin tumorigenesis, BMP antagonist noggin was used to generate keratin 14-targeted transgenic mice. In contrast to wild-type mice, transgenic mice developed spontaneous hair <e>follicle</e>-derived tumors, which resemble human trichofolliculoma. Global gene expression profiles revealed that in contrast to anagen hair follicles of wild-type mice, tumors of transgenic mice showed stage-dependent increases in the expression of genes encoding the selected components of Wnt and Shh pathways. Specifically, expression of the Wnt ligands increased at the initiation stage of tumor formation, whereas expression of the Wnt antagonist and tumor suppressor Wnt inhibitory factor-1 decreased, as compared with fully developed tumors. In contrast, expression of the components of Shh pathway increased in fully developed tumors, as compared with the tumor placodes. Consistent with the expression data, pharmacological treatment of transgenic mice with Wnt and Shh antagonists resulted in the stage-dependent inhibition of tumor initiation, and progression, respectively. Furthermore, BMP signaling stimulated Wnt inhibitory factor-1 expression and promoter activity in cultured tumor cells and HaCaT keratinocytes, as well as inhibited Shh expression, as compared with the corresponding controls. Thus, tumor suppressor activity of the BMPs in skin epithelium depends on the local concentrations of noggin and is mediated at least in part via stage-dependent antagonizing of Wnt and Shh signaling pathways.",M1
19695019,"Exogen involves gradual release of the hair club fibre in the vibrissa <e>follicle</e> model.Exogen is a distinct phase of the hair cycle describing the process by which the hair club fibre is shed from the follicle. This process is difficult to study in human skin and little is known about the mechanisms involved in the release of club fibres. We sought an alternative model system to study exogen in more detail, and therefore utilised the vibrissa system on the rodent mystacial pad. The time at which a vibrissa club hair will be lost can be predicted, based on the relative lengths of the new growing fibre and old club fibre. This timing phenomenon was exploited to investigate the club fibre within the follicle as it approaches final release, revealing key changes in the adhesive state of the club fibre within the epithelial sac as it approached release. We propose that exogen should be subdivided to represent variations in the club fibre status.",M1

The hair <e>follicles</e> and sebaceous glands had reticular epithelial degeneration by mucoid material of the outer root sheath and sebaceous epithelium. The mucoid material stained with Alcian blue at pH 2.5. The clinical and histological features were consistent with the diagnosis of follicular mucinosis. On immunohistochemistry, the outer root sheath cells with reticular epithelial degeneration were nestin-positive and keratin 15-negative. These results suggest that the outer root sheath cells with reticular epithelial degeneration come from the nestin-positive, multipotent, hair follicle stem cells.",M1

19674199,"Fibrofolliculoma/trichodiscoma and fibrous papule (perifollicular fibroma/angiofibroma): a revaluation of the histopathological and immunohistochemical features.BACKGROUND: The multiple facial lesions of fibrofolliculoma (FF)/trichodiscoma (TD) and those of fibrous papule (FP; perifollicular fibroma/angiofibroma, AF) are characteristic of Birt-Hogg-Dubé (BHD) syndrome and tuberous sclerosis, respectively. However, there was a recently reported case of BHD syndrome with multiple facial FP lesions and a case of tuberous sclerosis, in which one FF lesion was included among the multiple facial FPs. METHODS: The histopathological and immunohistochemical features of FF/TD and FP lesions were revaluated to study the relationship between the two. This investigation evaluated 20 FF/TD lesions including two cases of BHD syndrome and 35 FP lesions including three cases of tuberous sclerosis. RESULTS: There are common histopathological features in the two lesions, such as the follicular and perifollicular elements, an angiofibromatous element and stellate fibrocytes. The similar immunohistochemical features between the two lesions included the expression patterns of CD34, factor XIIIa, nestin and c-kit in the stromal cells as well as abnormal CK15 expression in the hair <e>follicles</e>. CONCLUSIONS: Both FF/TD and FP are hamartomas composed of perifollicular or interfollicular connective tissue and a hair follicular epithelial component, which may be caused by an abnormal functioning of the hair follicle bulge cells.",M1

19664980,"Distinct self-renewal and differentiation phases in the niche of infrequently dividing hair <e>follicle</e> stem cells.In homeostasis of adult vertebrate tissues, stem cells are thought to self-renew by infrequent and asymmetric divisions that generate another stem cell daughter and a progenitor daughter cell committed to differentiate. This model is based largely on in vivo invertebrate or in vitro mammal studies. Here, we examine the dynamic behavior of adult hair follicle stem cells in their normal setting by employing mice with repressible H2B-GFP expression to track cell divisions and Cre-inducible mice to perform long-term single-cell lineage tracing. We provide direct evidence for the infrequent stem cell division model in intact tissue. Moreover, we find that differentiation of progenitor cells occurs at different times and tissue locations than self-renewal of stem cells. Distinct fates of differentiation or self-renewal are assigned to individual cells in a temporal-spatial manner. We propose that large clusters of tissue stem cells behave as populations whose maintenance involves unidirectional daughter-cell-fate decisions.",M1

19663765,"Drug targeting through pilosebaceous route.Local skin targeting is of interest for the pharmaceutical and the cosmetic industry. A topically applied substance has basically three possibilities to penetrate into the skin: transcellular, intercellular, and follicular. The transfollicular path has been largely ignored because hair <e>follicles</e> constitute only 0.1% of the total skin. The hair follicle is a skin appendage with a complex structure containing many cell types that produce highly specialised proteins. The hair follicle is in a continuous cycle: anagen is the hair growth phase, catagen the involution phase and telogen is the resting phase. Nonetheless, the hair follicle has great potential for skin treatment, owing to its deep extension into the dermis and thus provides much deeper penetration and absorption of compounds beneath the skin than seen with the transdermal route. In the case of skin diseases and of cosmetic products, delivery to sweat glands or to the pilosebaceous unit is essential for the effectiveness of the drug. Increased accumulation in the pilosebaceous unit could treat alopecia, acne and skin cancer more efficiently and improve the effect of cosmetic substances and nutrients. Therefore, we review herein various drug delivery systems, including liposomes, niosomes, microspheres, nanoparticles, nanoemulsions, lipid nanocarriers, gene therapy and discuss the results of recent researches.

19645852,"Does erythropoietin modulate human hair <e>follicle</e> melanocyte activities in situ?Erythropoietin (EPO) is now appreciated for not only drive erythopoiesis, but also to exert additional functions. Since we had previously shown that human hair follicles (HFs) are both an extra-renal source and an extra-medullary target of EPO, we have now studied whether one such function is the regulation of HF pigmentation. Human anagen VI HFs were treated with EPO (100 IU/ml) in serum-free organ culture. Unexpectedly, we noticed greatly divergent pigmentary effects of EPO, since both up- and down-regulation of HF melanin content and tyrosinase activity in situ was seen in HF derived from different individuals. These divergent effects could not be attributed to differences in skin regions, the total HF melanocyte number or specific traits of individual HF donors. Our pilot study provides first evidence suggesting that EPO may modulate normal human melanocyte functions under physiologically relevant conditions in situ.",M1
19629164,"Circadian clock genes contribute to the regulation of hair <e>follicle</e> cycling.Hair follicles undergo recurrent cycling of controlled growth (anagen), regression (catagen), and relative quiescence (telogen) with a defined periodicity. Taking a genomics approach to study gene expression during synchronized mouse hair follicle cycling, we discovered that, in addition to circadian fluctuation, CLOCK-regulated genes are also modulated in phase with the hair growth cycle. During telogen and early anagen, circadian clock genes are prominently expressed in the secondary hair germ, which contains precursor cells for the growing follicle. Analysis of Clock and Bmal1 mutant mice reveals a delay in anagen progression, and the secondary hair germ cells show decreased levels of phosphorylated Rb and lack mitotic cells, suggesting that circadian clock genes regulate anagen progression via their effect on the cell cycle. Consistent with a block at the G1 phase of the cell cycle, we show a significant upregulation of p21 in Bmal1 mutant skin. While circadian clock mechanisms have been implicated in a variety of diurnal biological processes, our findings indicate that circadian clock genes may be utilized to modulate the progression of non-diurnal cyclic processes.",M1
19619491,"Reciprocal requirements for EDA/EDAR/NF-kappaB and Wnt/beta-catenin signaling pathways in hair <e>follicle</e> induction.Wnt/beta-catenin and NF-kappaB signaling mechanisms provide central controls in development and disease, but how these pathways intersect is unclear. Using hair follicle induction as a model system, we show that patterning of dermal Wnt/beta-catenin signaling requires epithelial beta-catenin activity. We find that Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is absolutely required for NF-kappaB activation, and that Edar is a direct Wnt target gene. Wnt/beta-catenin signaling is initially activated independently of EDA/EDAR/NF-kappaB activity in primary hair follicle primordia. However, Eda/Edar/NF-kappaB signaling is required to refine the pattern of Wnt/beta-catenin activity, and to maintain this activity at later stages of placode development. We show that maintenance of localized expression of Wnt10b and Wnt10a requires NF-kappaB signaling, providing a molecular explanation for the latter observation, and identify Wnt10b as a direct NF-kappaB target. These data reveal a complex interplay and interdependence of Wnt/beta-catenin and EDA/EDAR/NF-kappaB signaling pathways in initiation and maintenance of primary hair follicle placodes.",M1
19614992,"Cytokeratin 75 expression in central, centrifugal, cicatricial alopecia--new observations in normal and diseased hair <e>follicles</e>.BACKGROUND: Premature desquamation of the inner root sheath (IRS) is an important histological marker for central, centrifugal, cicatricial alopecia (CCCA), and an inherently defective IRS may be responsible. Cytokeratin 75 (K75; formerly K6hf) is an appealing candidate for study because K75 is specifically expressed in the companion layer of the hair follicle, the interface for IRS desquamation. Also, K75 abnormalities have been found in other hair diseases bearing similarities to CCCA. METHODS: We used a commercially available antibody to K75 on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded tissue from clinically and histologically  normal  scalp (n=9); clinically diseased scalp from patients with CCCA (n=15); and clinically  normal  scalp from patients with CCCA (n=6). RESULTS: K75 expression disappears during the process of IRS desquamation, and loss of expression begins even when IRS desquamation is in its incipient phase. Also, K75 has a characteristic pattern of expression in telogen follicles. CONCLUSIONS: K75 expression is closely associated with the process of desquamation of the IRS. This process occurs prematurely (below the isthmus) in many follicles from patients with, but not without, CCCA. K75 expression highlights premature desquamation of the IRS in CCCA, but may not be directly involved in disease pathogenesis.",M1

We isolated and sequenced the complete genome of a novel PV type (designated RnPV) from the oral cavity of the Norway rat (Rattus norvegicus), as well as an L1 gene fragment from hair-<e>follicle</e> cells of the European beaver (Castor fiber). As inferred from amino acid sequence data, RnPV clustered within the beta+gamma+pi+Xi-PV supertaxon as a member of the genus Pipapillomavirus. The closest relatives of RnPV were McPV-2 and MmPV, and time estimates indicated that the genus Pipapillomavirus originated in the late Cenozoic era. The close relationship of RnPV to other murid PV types supports the hypothesis of co-divergence between members of the genus Pipapillomavirus and their hosts. However, the derived Neogene origin of the genus Pipapillomavirus is much younger than has been considered for the Rodentia as the primary hosts, indicating that alternative interpretations of the phylogenetic trees should be conceived.",M1
19605494,"Sox2-positive dermal papilla cells specify hair <e>follicle</e> type in mammalian epidermis.The dermal papilla comprises the specialised mesenchymal cells at the base of the hair follicle. Communication between dermal papilla cells and the overlying epithelium is essential for differentiation of the hair follicle lineages. We report that Sox2 is expressed in all dermal papillae at E16.5, but from E18.5 onwards expression is confined to a subset of dermal papillae. In postnatal skin, Sox2 is only expressed in the dermal papillae of guard/awl/auchene follicles, whereas CD133 is expressed both in guard/awl/auchene and in zigzag dermal papillae. Using transgenic mice that express GFP under the control of the Sox2 promoter, we isolated Sox2(+) (GFP(+)) CD133(+) cells and compared them with Sox2(-) (GFP(-)) CD133(+) dermal papilla cells. In addition to the 'core' dermal papilla gene signature, each subpopulation expressed distinct sets of genes. GFP(+) CD133(+) cells had upregulated Wnt, FGF and BMP pathways and expressed neural crest markers. In GFP(-) CD133(+) cells, the hedgehog, IGF, Notch and integrin pathways were prominent. In skin reconstitution assays, hair follicles failed to form when dermis was depleted of both GFP(+) CD133(+) and GFP(-) CD133(+) cells. In the absence of GFP(+) CD133(+) cells, awl/auchene hairs failed to form and only zigzag hairs were found. We have thus demonstrated a previously unrecognised heterogeneity in dermal papilla cells and shown that Sox2-positive cells specify particular hair follicle types.",M1
19596793,"Corneodesmosin gene ablation induces lethal skin-barrier disruption and hair-<e>follicle</e> degeneration related to desmosome dysfunction.Corneodesmosin (CDSN) is specific to desmosomes of epithelia undergoing cornification, mainly the epidermis and the inner root sheath of the hair follicles. CDSN nonsense mutations are associated with hypotrichosis simplex of the scalp, a rare disease that leads to complete baldness in young adults. CDSN displays adhesive properties, mostly attributable to its N-terminal glycine-rich domain, and is sequentially proteolyzed as corneocytes migrate towards the skin surface. K14-promoter driven Cre-mediated deletion of Cdsn in mice resulted in neonatal death as a result of epidermal tearing upon minor mechanical stress. Ultrastructural analyses revealed a desmosomal break at the interface between the living and cornified layers. After grafting onto nude mice, knockout skin showed a chronic defect in the epidermal permeability barrier. The epidermis was first hyperproliferative with a thick cornified layer, then, both the epidermis and the hair follicles degenerated. In adults, Cdsn deletion resulted in similar histological abnormalities and in a lethal barrier defect. We demonstrate that Cdsn is not essential for skin-barrier formation in utero, but is vital throughout life to preserve this barrier by maintaining desmosome integrity. The strong adhesive function that the protein confers on corneodesmosomes also seems necessary for maintaining the architecture of the hair follicle.",M1

The derivative 6-amino-N-cyclohexyl-3-methylthiazolo[3,2-alpha]benzimidazole-2-carboxamide hydrochloride (desmethyl YM-298198) had a comparable potency. Another compound 7-(hydroxyimino)cyclopropa[b]chromen-1a-carboxylate ethyl ester (CPCCOEt) had a similar depressant effect, although it was less potent with an approximate IC(50) of 100 microM.

No depression, and some weak excitatory effects, were observed using the following ligands: the competitive mGlu1 receptor antagonist alpha-amino-5-carboxy-3-methyl-2-thiopheneacetic acid (3-MATIDA) (300 microM), the phosphoserine phosphatase inhibitor dl-2-amino-3-phosphonopropionic acid (dl-AP3) (2 mM), non-competitive mGlu5 receptor antagonists 3-((2-methyl-1,3-thiazol-4-yl)ethynyl)pyridine; (S)-3,5-DHPG, (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (MTEP) (10 microM) and 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP) (100 microM), the mGlu1 receptor agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine ((S)-3,5-DHPG) (500 microM), and the mGlu5 receptor agonist (RS)-2-chloro-5-hydroxyphenylglycine (CHPG) (1 mM). The results suggest that the non-competitive mGlu1 receptor antagonists are not acting at conventional mGlu1 receptors but at other binding sites, possibly those directly associated with mechanogated channels or on any of a number of indirect biochemical pathways. YM-298198 and related compounds may prove to be useful ligands to identify mechanosensitive channel proteins. The selective interference of type I units may provide further evidence that Merkel cells are mechanotransducers. Finally such compounds may deliver insights or treatments for Merkel cell carcinoma.",M1
19587698,"The keratins of the human beard hair medulla: the riddle in the middle.We have investigated the expression of 52 of the 54 keratins in beard hair medulla. We found that not only 12 hair keratins but, unexpectedly, also 12 epithelial keratins are potentially expressed in medulla cells. The latter comprise keratins also present in outer- and inner-root sheaths and in the companion layer. Keratins K5, K14, K17, K25, K27, K28, and K75 define a  pre-medulla,  composed of cells apposed to the upper dermal papilla. Besides K6, K16, K7, K19, and K80, all pre-medullary epithelial keratins continue to be expressed in the medulla proper, along with the 12 hair keratins. Besides this unique feature of cellular keratin co-expression, the keratin pattern itself is highly variable in individual medulla cells. Remarkably, both epithelial and hair keratins behave highly promiscuously with regard to heterodimer- and IF formation, which also includes keratin chain interactions in IF bundles. We also identified cortex cells within the medullary column. These exhibit all the properties of genuine cortex cells, including a particular type of keratin heterogeneity of their compact IF bundles. In both keratin expression profile and keratin number, medulla cells are distinct from all other cells of the hair <e>follicle</e> or from any other epithelium.",M1
19570515,"TAp63 prevents premature aging by promoting adult stem cell maintenance.The cellular mechanisms that regulate the maintenance of adult tissue stem cells are still largely unknown. We show here that the p53 family member, TAp63, is essential for maintenance of epidermal and dermal precursors and that, in its absence, these precursors senesce and skin ages prematurely. Specifically, we have developed a TAp63 conditional knockout mouse and used it to ablate TAp63 in the germline (TAp63(-/-)) or in K14-expressing cells in the basal layer of the epidermis (TAp63(fl/fl);K14cre+). TAp63(-/-) mice age prematurely and develop blisters, skin ulcerations, senescence of hair <e>follicle</e>-associated dermal and epidermal cells, and decreased hair morphogenesis. These phenotypes are likely due to loss of TAp63 in dermal and epidermal precursors since both cell types show defective proliferation, early senescence, and genomic instability. These data indicate that TAp63 serves to maintain adult skin stem cells by regulating cellular senescence and genomic stability, thereby preventing premature tissue aging.",M1
19557687,"Reptile scale paradigm: Evo-Devo, pattern formation and regeneration.The purpose of this perspective is to highlight the merit of the reptile integument as an experimental model. Reptiles represent the first amniotes. From stem reptiles, extant reptiles, birds and mammals have evolved. Mammal hairs and feathers evolved from Therapsid and Sauropsid reptiles, respectively. The early reptilian integument had to adapt to the challenges of terrestrial life, developing a multi-layered stratum corneum capable of barrier function and ultraviolet protection. For better mechanical protection, diverse reptilian scale types have evolved. The evolution of endothermy has driven the convergent evolution of hair and feather <e>follicles</e>: both form multiple localized growth units with stem cells and transient amplifying cells protected in the proximal follicle. This topological arrangement allows them to elongate, molt and regenerate without structural constraints. Another unique feature of reptile skin is the exquisite arrangement of scales and pigment patterns, making them testable models for mechanisms of pattern formation. Since they face the constant threat of damage on land, different strategies were developed to accommodate skin homeostasis and regeneration. Temporally, they can be under continuous renewal or sloughing cycles. Spatially, they can be diffuse or form discrete localized growth units (follicles). To understand how gene regulatory networks evolved to produce increasingly complex ectodermal organs, we have to study how prototypic scale-forming pathways in reptiles are modulated to produce appendage novelties. Despite the fact that there are numerous studies of reptile scales, molecular analyses have lagged behind. Here, we underscore how further development of this novel experimental model will be valuable in filling the gaps of our understanding of the Evo-Devo of amniote integuments.",M1

Humans are host to D. folliculorum and D. brevis. The biology, natural history, and anatomy of these mites as related to their life in the human pilosebaceous complex is reviewed.

19554024,"Nestin in human skin: exclusive expression in intramesenchymal skin compartments and regulation by leptin.Cutaneous nestin+ cells are of substantial interest in regenerative medicine. However, the location of nestin+ cells in situ remains controversial. We therefore sought to determine their location in female human scalp skin, using stringently controlled immunohistochemical techniques, Western blot analysis, and in situ hybridization and complementing those techniques with relative and quantitative reverse transcriptase-PCR of enzymatically digested or laser-capture microdissected human hair <e>follicle</e> (HF) compartments. We show here that the immunoreactivity (IR) patterns obtained with anti-nestin antibodies are highly dependent on the tissue-fixation and immunohistochemical methods used. NESTIN mRNA could not be detected within HF-associated epithelial cells in situ or in RNA extracts of the microdissected HF epithelium. Instead, NESTIN transcripts were found only in intramesenchymal skin compartments. Individual cells showing both, specific nestin IR and NESTIN mRNA were detectable in the connective-tissue sheaths of human HFs, sebaceous and sweat glands. Moreover, stimulation of organ-cultured human scalp skin with the adipokine leptin increased the number of nestin+ cells in these intramesenchymal skin locations, whereas no specific nestin IR could be induced by leptin within the HF epithelium, including the bulge. Therefore, nestin expression at the gene and protein levels in human scalp skin is restricted to the periappendage mesenchyme and can be stimulated by leptin.",M1

Stem cells in the epidermis not only ensure the maintenance of epidermal homeostasis and hair regeneration, but also contribute to repair of the epidermis after injury. These stem cells lie within specific niches in the hair follicle and the epidermis. The availability of monoclonal antibodies that can be used on formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue has greatly facilitated the use of this methodology as an adjunct to uncovering stem cell niches. In this review, we attempt to provide an overview of the potential markers available to identify and study stem cells in an effort to providing a better understanding of the pathogenesis of skin diseases including disorders of hair loss and malignancies. The potential uses of these markers in prognosis and in expanding the therapeutic options in several disorders will also be addressed.",M1

A 45-year-old man presented with an asymptomatic nodule on the scalp since 3 years. Histologically, the lesion corresponded to a well-organized, symmetrical dermal nodule made up of basophilic lobules included in a fibrocytic stroma. The lesion had the characteristics of hair germ tumors; however, most lobules depicted a distinctive pattern of rounded nests of concentrically arranged clear cells. Small <e>follicle</e> bulb-like basophilic structures, foci of sebaceous differentiation, and areas of infundibulocystic, isthmic, and outer sheath keratinization were also seen.

19542918,"Requirement of DHCR24 for postnatal development of epidermis and hair <e>follicles</e> in mice.Desmosterolosis is an autosomal recessive disorder with severe developmental anomalies due to mutations in the DHCR24 gene, encoding an enzyme to convert desmosterol to cholesterol. We reported that DHCR24 [knockout (KO)] mice were born with wrinkleless taut skin and with impaired development of epidermis. In this study, we investigated the postnatal development of epidermis and hair follicle in the skin of KO mice grafted to the nude mice. Skin graft was required since the KO mice die within few hours after birth. Forty days after the skin graft, epidermis from the KO mice revealed the characteristic phenotype observed at birth. Furthermore, the number of hair follicles in the skin graft from KO mice to the nude mice was significantly less and development was delayed than that from control. These findings implicate that DHCR24 plays important roles for normal development of epidermis and hair follicle even in postnatal life.",M1
19519832,"The 'melanocyte-keratin' mystery revisited: neither normal human epidermal nor hair <e>follicle</e> melanocytes express keratin 16 or keratin 6 in situ.BACKGROUND: Keratin family proteins are generally accepted as being restricted to epithelial cells. However, several studies have challenged this paradigm by reporting, for example, that melanoma cells can express keratins and that normal human epidermal melanocytes, which derive from the neural crest, express keratin 16 (K16) in situ. OBJECTIVES: We wished to confirm or refute that K16 and/or its intermediate filament partner, keratin 6 (K6), are expressed in normal human epidermal and/or hair follicle melanocytes in situ. METHODS: Cryosections of normal human scalp skin were subjected to highly sensitive double immunohistochemistry with specific antibodies against K16 or K6 and against the melanocyte-specific marker NKI/beteb (gp100). Immunoreactivity (IR) was visualized by conventional light microscopy and confocal fluorescence microscopy. RESULTS: Despite the use of different, high-sensitivity immunostaining methods, stringent positive and negative controls, and monospecific, well-characterized antikeratin antibodies, we could detect neither K16 nor K6 IR within intraepidermal or intrafollicular pigment cells of normal human scalp skin. Instead, NKI/beteb+ cells were found to be intimately embedded in foci of K16+ and/or K6+ keratinocytes, which might create the illusion of keratin expression by these cells. CONCLUSIONS: Human epidermal or hair follicle melanocytes do not express K16 and/or K6 while residing in their natural habitat.",M1
19513791,"A novel mutation in Hr causes abnormal hair <e>follicle</e> morphogenesis in hairpoor mouse, an animal model for Marie Unna Hereditary Hypotrichosis.Hairpoor mice (Hr(Hp)) were derived through N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis. These mice display sparse and short hair in the Hr(Hp)/+ heterozygous state and complete baldness in the Hr(Hp)/Hr(Hp) homozygous state. This phenotype was irreversible and was inherited in an autosomal semidominant manner. Hair follicles (HFs) of Hr(Hp)/+ mice underwent normal cycling and appeared normal, although smaller than those of the wild-type mice. In contrast, HFs of Hr(Hp)/Hr(Hp) mice became cyst-like structures by postnatal day (P) 21. The number and length of vibrissae decreased in a dose-dependent manner as the number of mutant alleles increased. A positional candidate gene approach was used to identify the gene responsible for the hairpoor phenotype. Genetic linkage analysis determined that the hairpoor locus is 2 cm from D14Mit34 on chromosome 14. Sequence analysis of the exons of the candidate gene hairless revealed a T-to-A transversion mutation at nucleotide position 403 (exon 2), presumably resulting in abolishment of an upstream open reading frame (uORF). In addition, we also found that the near-naked mouse (Hr(N)), a spontaneously arising mutant, harbors a A402G transition in its genome. Both mutations were in the uATG codon of the second uORF in the 5' UTR and corresponded to the mutations identified in Marie Unna Hereditary Hypotrichosis (MUHH) patients. In the present study we describe the phenotype, histological morphology, and molecular etiology of an animal model of MUHH, the hairpoor mouse.",M1
19507228,"Human hair <e>follicle</e> pluripotent stem (hfPS) cells promote regeneration of peripheral-nerve injury: an advantageous alternative to ES and iPS cells.The optimal source of stem cells for regenerative medicine is a major question. Embryonic stem (ES) cells have shown promise for pluripotency but have ethical issues and potential to form teratomas. Pluripotent stem cells have been produced from skin cells by either viral-, plasmid- or transposon-mediated gene transfer. These stem cells have been termed induced pluripotent stem cells or iPS cells. iPS cells may also have malignant potential and are inefficiently produced. Embryonic stem cells may not be suited for individualized therapy, since they can undergo immunologic rejection. To address these fundamental problems, our group is developing hair follicle pluripotent stem (hfPS) cells. Our previous studies have shown that mouse hfPS cells can differentiate to neurons, glial cells in vitro, and other cell types, and can promote nerve and spinal cord regeneration in vivo. hfPS cells are located above the hair follicle bulge in what we have termed the hfPS cell area (hfPSA) and are nestin positive and keratin 15 (K-15) negative. Human hfPS cells can also differentiate into neurons, glia, keratinocytes, smooth muscle cells, and melanocytes in vitro. In the present study, human hfPS cells were transplanted in the severed sciatic nerve of the mouse where they differentiated into glial fibrillary-acidic-protein (GFAP)-positive Schwann cells and promoted the recovery of pre-existing axons, leading to nerve generation. The regenerated nerve recovered function and, upon electrical stimulation, contracted the gastrocnemius muscle. The hfPS cells can be readily isolated from the human scalp, thereby providing an accessible, autologous and safe source of stem cells for regenerative medicine that have important advantages over ES or iPS cells.",M1
19506554,"Differential expression of stem-cell-associated markers in human hair <e>follicle</e> epithelial cells.Several putative biomarkers have been suggested for identifying murine follicular stem cells; however, human hair follicles have a different pattern of biomarker expression, and follicular stem cell isolation methods have not been established. To isolate a stem cell population applicable to clinical settings, we conducted a comprehensive survey of the expression of stem-cell-associated (K15, CD200, CD34, and CD271) and other biomarkers (K1, K14, CD29, and CD49f) in immunohistological sections of the human epidermis and follicular outer root sheath (ORS). We also examined freshly isolated and cultured epidermal or follicular cells with single- and multicolor flow cytometry or immunocytochemistry. After sorting cells by CD200, CD34, and forward scatter (FSC) values (cell size), colony-forming assays were performed. We found that biomarkers were differentially expressed in the epidermis and ORS. Basal bulge cells were mainly K15+CD200+CD34(-)CD271(-), and suprabasal cells were K15(-)CD200+CD34(-)CD271(-). We categorized follicular cells into nine subpopulations according to biomarker expression profiles. The CD200+CD34(-) bulge cells had much higher colony-forming abilities than the CD34+ population, and were divided into two subpopulations: a CD200+CD34(-)FSC(high) (K15-rich, basal) and a CD200+CD34(-)FSC(low) (K15-poor, suprabasal) population. The former formed fewer but larger-sized colonies than the latter. Follicular epithelial cell cultivation resulted in loss of K15, CD200, CD34, and CD271 expression, but maintenance of K14, CD29, and CD49f expression. We found that the bulge contained two populations with different localizations, cell sizes, and colony-forming abilities. We showed that K15, CD200, CD34, and CD271 were useful biomarkers for characterizing freshly isolated human follicular epithelial cells in diverse stages of differentiation.",M1

19496793,"Review of the hair <e>follicle</e> origin hypothesis for basal cell carcinoma.BACKGROUND: Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most common type of skin cancer treated by the dermatologic surgeon. The discovery that patients with the nevoid BCC syndrome had mutations in the human homologue of the Drosophila patched gene led to a rapid increase in our understanding of the pathogenesis of BCC. It is theorized that altered regulation at multiple steps in the patched signal transduction pathway may contribute to the development of BCC. This pathway also plays an essential role in embryonic hair follicle development and during the hair cycle. Taken together, a considerable body of evidence suggests that at least some BCC may be derived from deregulated patched signaling in hair follicle stem cells. OBJECTIVE: To review evidence of a follicular derivation of BCC and to highlight emerging therapeutic strategies to block deregulated patched signaling in BCC. CONCLUSION: Deregulation of the patched signal transduction pathway is present in the vast majority of human BCCs. Pharmacologic inhibitors of this pathway may offer a therapeutic strategy to block tumor growth. The author has indicated no significant interest with commercial supporters.",M1
19481595,"Eclipta alba extract with potential for hair growth promoting activity.ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Eclipta alba is traditionally known to potentiate hair growth promotion. AIM OF THE STUDY: The study was aimed to investigate the efficacy of methanol extract of Eclipta alba as hair growth promoter. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pigmented C57/BL6 mice, preselected for their telogen phase of hair growth were used. In these species, the truncal epidermis lacks melanin-producing melanocytes and melanin production is strictly coupled to anagen phase of hair growth. The extract was applied topically to assess telogen to anagen transition. Immunohistochemical investigation was performed to analyze antigen specificity. Animals in anagen phase of hair growth were positive for FGF-7 and Shh and negative for BMP4, whereas the animals in telogen phase were positive only for BMP4 antigen. RESULTS: The methanol extract of whole plant when tested for hair growth promoting potential, exhibited dose dependent activity in C57BL6 mice. The activity was assessed by studying the melanogenesis in resected skin, <e>follicle</e> count in the subcutis, skin thickness and surrogate markers in vehicle control and extract treated animals.

19474150,"KGF and EGF signalling block hair <e>follicle</e> induction and promote interfollicular epidermal fate in developing mouse skin.A key initial event in hair follicle morphogenesis is the localised thickening of the skin epithelium to form a placode, partitioning future hair follicle epithelium from interfollicular epidermis. Although many developmental signalling pathways are implicated in follicle morphogenesis, the role of epidermal growth factor (EGF) and keratinocyte growth factor (KGF, also known as FGF7) receptors are not defined. EGF receptor (EGFR) ligands have previously been shown to inhibit developing hair follicles; however, the underlying mechanisms have not been characterised. Here we show that receptors for EGF and KGF undergo marked downregulation in hair follicle placodes from multiple body sites, whereas the expression of endogenous ligands persist throughout hair follicle initiation. Using embryonic skin organ culture, we show that when skin from the sites of primary pelage and whisker follicle development is exposed to increased levels of two ectopic EGFR ligands (HBEGF and amphiregulin) and the FGFR2(IIIb) receptor ligand KGF, follicle formation is inhibited in a time- and dose-dependent manner. We then used downstream molecular markers and microarray profiling to provide evidence that, in response to KGF and EGF signalling, epidermal differentiation is promoted at the expense of hair follicle fate. We propose that hair follicle initiation in placodes requires downregulation of the two pathways in question, both of which are crucial for the ongoing development of the interfollicular epidermis. We have also uncovered a previously unrecognised role for KGF signalling in the formation of hair follicles in the mouse.",M1
20390842,"Follicular apoptosis in the mussel (Mytella strigata) as potential indicator of environmental stress in coastal ecosystems.Follicular apoptosis in the tropical mussel Mytella strigata was assessed in three coastal lagoons located in the southern Gulf of California, Mexico. Mussels were collected from three coastal lagoons associated with different scenarios of anthropogenic stress during one year. The gonad of each mussel was dissected, weighed, and sampled for histology and apoptosis analysis by TUNEL labeling. Two apoptotic indices were used: the apoptotic index of cells (AIC) based on the number of follicular cells in apoptosis in one thousand cells counted per gonad, and the apoptotic index of <e>follicles</e> (AIF) based on the number of follicular cells per follicle per gonad. Both indices showed high association with each other for all developmental stages, although AIF seemed to better discriminate among sites. Higher AIF and AIC were observed at the Urias Estuary (1.6 and 1.5 respectively) ranked as highly polluted, followed by Ensenada del Pabellon (0.82 and 0.95 respectively), ranked as moderately polluted, and the Teacapan Estuary (0.57 and 0.76 respectively) ranked as slightly polluted. Our data indicate that the apoptotic index in tropical mussels could be a useful indicator of environmental stress in coastal ecosystems; however, the ecological relevance of follicular apoptosis in polluted environments needs further investigation.",M2
20388653,"Drosophila VHL tumor-suppressor gene regulates epithelial morphogenesis by promoting microtubule and aPKC stability.Mutations in the human von Hippel-Lindau (VHL) genes are the cause of VHL disease, which displays multiple benign and malignant tumors. The VHL gene has been shown to regulate angiogenic potential and glycolic metabolism via its E3 ubiquitin ligase function against the alpha subunit of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF). However, many other HIF-independent functions of VHL have been identified and recent evidence indicates that the canonical function cannot fully explain the VHL mutant cell phenotypes. Many of these functions have not been verified in genetically tractable systems. Using an established follicular epithelial model in Drosophila, we show that the Drosophila VHL gene is involved in epithelial morphogenesis via stabilizing microtubule bundles and aPKC. Microtubule defects in VHL mutants lead to mislocalization of aPKC and subsequent loss of epithelial integrity. Destabilizing microtubules in ex vivo culture of wild-type egg chambers can also result in aPKC mislocalization and epithelial defects. Importantly, paclitaxel-induced stabilization of microtubules can rescue the aPKC localization phenotype in Drosophila VHL mutant <e>follicle</e> cells. The results establish a developmental function of the VHL gene that is relevant to its tumor-suppressor activity.",M2
20382141,"Role of G protein-coupled estrogen receptor 1, GPER, in inhibition of oocyte maturation by endogenous estrogens in zebrafish.Estrogen inhibition of oocyte maturation (OM) and the role of GPER (formerly known as GPR30) were investigated in zebrafish. Estradiol-17beta (E2) and G-1, a GPER-selective agonist, bound to zebrafish oocyte membranes suggesting the presence of GPER which was confirmed by immunocytochemistry using a specific GPER antibody. Incubation of <e>follicle</e>-enclosed oocytes with an aromatase inhibitor, ATD, and enzymatic and manual removal of the ovarian follicle cell layers significantly increased spontaneous OM which was partially reversed by co-treatment with either 100 nM E2 or G-1. Incubation of denuded oocytes with the GPER antibody blocked the inhibitory effects of estrogens on OM, whereas microinjection of estrogen receptor alpha (ERalpha) antisense oligonucleotides into the oocytes was ineffective. The results suggest that endogenous estrogens produced by the follicle cells inhibit or delay spontaneous maturation of zebrafish oocytes and that this estrogen action is mediated through GPER. Treatment with E2 and G-1 also attenuated the stimulatory effect of the teleost maturation-inducing steroid, 17,20beta-dihyroxy-4-pregnen-3-one (DHP), on OM. Moreover, E2 and G-1 down-regulated the expression of membrane progestin receptor alpha (mPRalpha), the intermediary in DHP induction of OM. Conversely DHP treatment caused a &gt;50% decline in GPER mRNA levels. The results suggest that estrogens and GPER are critical components of the endocrine system controlling the onset of OM in zebrafish. A model is proposed for the dual control of the onset of oocyte maturation in teleosts by estrogens and progestins acting through GPER and mPRalpha, respectively, at different stages of oocyte development.",M2
20368445,"Epigenetic stability increases extensively during Drosophila <e>follicle</e> stem cell differentiation.Stem and embryonic cells facilitate programming toward multiple daughter cell fates, whereas differentiated cells resist reprogramming and oncogenic transformation. How alterations in the chromatin-based machinery of epigenetic inheritance contribute to these differences remains poorly known. We observed random, heritable changes in GAL4/UAS transgene programming during Drosophila ovarian follicle stem cell differentiation and used them to measure the stage-specific epigenetic stability of gene programming. The frequency of GAL4/UAS reprogramming declines more than 100-fold over the nine divisions comprising this stem cell lineage. Stabilization acts in cis, suggesting that it is chromatin-based, and correlates with increased S phase length. Our results suggest that stem/early progenitor cells cannot accurately transmit nongenetic information to their progeny; full epigenetic competence is acquired only gradually during early differentiation. Modulating epigenetic inheritance may be a critical process controlling transitions between the pleuripotent and differentiated states.",M2

More recent studies in mice and humans indicate that many other intra-ovarian signaling cascades affect follicular development and gonadotropin action in a stage- and context-specific manner. As we discuss here, mutant mouse models and clinical evidence indicate that some of the most powerful intra-ovarian regulators of follicular development include the TGF-beta/SMAD, WNT/FZD/beta-catenin, and RAS/ERK1/2 signaling pathways and the FOXO/FOXL2 transcription factors.",M2

STUDY DESIGN: In this clinical trial, 107 infertile patients with PCOS received either 100 mg clomiphene citrate (n = 57) or 5 mg letrozole (n = 50) daily since day 3-7 of their menstrual cycle. Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) was administered at a dose of 10,000 IU when at least 1 mature <e>follicle</e> was detected. A single intrauterine insemination was performed 34 hours later. Then the size, number and growth rate of follicles, ovulation rate, endometrial thickness and pregnancy rate were measured in both groups. RESULTS: The number and the size of mature follicles were similar between the 2 groups. The pregnancy rate in letrozole group was higher than that in the clomiphene group (20% vs. 14%), but the difference was not significant (p = 0.286). In letrozole group, 86% of patients developed mature follicles, all showing ovulation, whereas 72% of patients in clomiphene citrate group developed mature follicles (p = 0.07).

Primiparous UPB sows (n=47) were randomly assigned to (weaning=Day 0): control (no Altrenogest, n=12), RU8-15 (15 mg of Altrenogest, Day-1 till Day 7, n=12), RU8-20 (20 mg of Altrenogest, Day-1 till Day 7, n=12) or RU15-15 (15 mg of Altrenogest, Day-1 till Day 14, n=11). From weaning onwards, trans-abdominal ultrasound was performed daily. Sows were slaughtered on Day 4 or 5 after ovulation. Follicle size increased during Altrenogest treatment and reached a plateau around Day 6, regardless of dose (4.6+/-1.5, 4.6+/-1.6 and 4.6+/-1.6 mm for RU8-15, RU8-20 and RU15-15, respectively). This increase resulted in larger follicles (P=0.0002) at the onset of the follicular phase (i.e. time of weaning for control sows and 24h after last administration of Altrenogest for treated sows); 4.8+/-1.8, 4.8+/-1.4, 4.9+/-0.9 mm and 2.9+/-0.8, for RU8-15, RU8-20, RU15-15 and controls, respectively. Pre-ovulatory follicle size tended (P=0.07) to be larger for treated animals (7.9+/-2.4, 7.9+/-0.7, 8.6+/-1.3 and 6.9+/-0.9 mm for RU8-15, RU8-20, RU15-15 and controls, respectively). The interval follicular phase-oestrus was shorter (P=0.005) for treated animals. Treatment did not affect ovulation rate or early embryonic development. However, for treated animals, the increase in follicle size during treatment was positively related with ovulation rate (P=0.05). In conclusion, post-weaning treatment with Altrenogest of first litter sows influenced follicle size and shortened the follicular phase, but did not affect ovulation rate or early embryonic development.",M2

Although CDH1 expression remained exclusively in the oocytes during neonatal ovary development, CDH2 expression shifted from the oocytes to granulosa cells of primordial follicles on postnatal day (P)8. Subsequently, strong CDH2 expression was restricted to granulosa cells of growing follicles. Cdh2 mRNA levels in the ovary decreased from embryonic d 13 through P10 with a transient increase on P7, which was the day before the appearance of primordial follicles. Cdh1 mRNA levels decreased from embryonic d 13 through P3 and then showed a transient increase on P8, coinciding with the formation of primordial follicles. CDH1 and CDH2 expression were consistent with that of mRNA. Neutralization of FSH in utero impaired primordial follicle formation with an associated decrease in Cdh2 mRNA and CDH2, but an increase in Cdh1 mRNA and CDH1 expression. The altered expression was reversed by equine chorionic gonadotropin treatment on P1. Whereas a CDH2 antibody significantly reduced the formation of primordial and primary follicles in vitro, a CDH1 antibody had the opposite effect. This is the first evidence to suggest that primordial follicle formation requires a differential spatiotemporal expression and action of CDH1 and CDH2. Further, FSH regulation of primordial follicle formation may involve the action of CDH1 and CDH2.",M2

20198416,"Activin A inhibits activation of human primordial <e>follicles</e> in vitro.PURPOSE: To determine whether Activin A affects the activation and survival of human primordial follicles in vitro. METHODS: Ovarian cortical biopsies from eight women undergoing elective caesarean sections or benign gynaecological procedures were taken and cut into small pieces (1-3 mm(3)), cultured in serum-free medium for 7 days with/without human recombinant Activin A at a concentration of either 50 or 100 ng/ml. Ovarian tissue were analysed by histology for follicle viability, development and density. RESULT(S): Significant activation of primordial follicles within cultured cortical tissue was observed after 7 days in control medium. However, medium supplemented with Activin A at 50 ng/ml resulted in significant inhibition of follicular activation. Increasing the concentration of Activin A to 100 ng/ml reversed the inhibitory effect. The effect of Activin A appeared to be specific to activation of non-growing (primordial) follicles into the growing population since no significant differences in follicle viability was observed between treatment groups. CONCLUSION(S): Activin A at a concentration of 50 ng/ml can inhibit the spontaneous activation of human primordial follicles in vitro indicating that this may be a component of the signalling mechanisms that maintain follicular quiescence.",M2
20189735,"Effect of estradiol benzoate used at the start of a progestagen treatment on superovulatory response and embryo yield in lactating and non-lactating llamas.Two experiments were conducted to determine the effect of estradiol benzoate (EB) and intravaginal progestagen treatment on ovarian follicular dynamics and superstimulatory response in eCG-treated llamas. The purpose of Experiment 1 was to evaluate the effect of EB and progestagen treatment starting at different phases of dominant <e>follicle</e> (DF1) development on regression pattern and subsequent follicle wave emergence (WE2) in lactating and non-lactating llamas. Early lactating (n=24, 30+/-4 days postpartum) and non-lactating (n=24) females were assigned in equal numbers (n=8) to one of three groups according to the phase of DF1 (growing, static or regressing) determined by ultrasonography from day -3 to day 0. At day 0, llamas received an intravaginal sponge (MPA, 150 mg) and 5mg of MPA (i.m.). Half of the females (n=4) of each group were injected with 2mg (i.m.) of EB and half were not (control group). A 2 x 2 x 3 (lactational status, EB treatment and follicular phases) factorial design was used. Each sponge was removed 8 days later. Ovaries were monitored from day 0 to day 12. Daily blood samples were taken to determine 17beta-estradiol (E(2)) profiles from day 0 to day 8. The DF1 regression pattern was not affected (P&gt;0.05) by the phase of follicle wave at the start of the treatment or any interactions among main effects. Follicle wave emergence in EB-treated llamas was delayed (P&lt;0.05) by 2.3 days compared with non-treated llamas. Following EB treatment, plasma concentrations of E(2) were greater (P&lt;0.05) from day 1 to day 5 in the treated than in non-treated females, but not from day 6 onward (P&gt;0.05). Experiment 2 was designed to evaluate the effect of this treatment on the ovarian superovulatory response and embryo yield following eCG treatment administered on day of follicular wave emergence as determined in the Experiment 1. The same lactating (n=18, 61+/-4 days postpartum) and non-lactating (n=18) llamas at random stages of follicle wave were treated as those in Experiment 1 and received 1200IU of eCG at the time of WE2 (EB-treated=day 6.5 and non-treated=day 4.5). Llamas were mated 5 days after sponge withdrawal. A second mating was allowed 24h later. Embryos were collected between 7 and 8 days after the first mating and blood samples were taken to determine progesterone (P(4)) concentrations. The mean number of follicles on day of mating and the number of CL on day of embryo collection were not affected by lactational status, EB treatment or their interactions (P&gt;0.05). Ovulation rate and mean (+/-SEM) number of recovered embryos for EB treatment group (67.5% and 2.4+/-0.4) were greater (P&lt;0.05) than for no EB treatment (51.1% and 1.1+/-0.4). Plasma P(4) concentrations and number of CL per llama were correlated (r=0.49; P=0.014). In conclusion, progestagen plus EB treatment facilitates the prediction of the emergence of a new follicular wave approximately 6 days after treatment and resulted in a higher ovulation rate and embryo production in ovarian superstimulated llamas regardless of lactational status.",M2
20188358,"Embryonic stem cell-like cells established by culture of adult ovarian cells in mice.OBJECTIVE: To suggest an alternative strategy for deriving histocompatible stems cells without undertaking genetic manipulation. DESIGN: Prospective approach using an animal model. SETTING: Stem cell and bioevaluation laboratory, Seoul National University. ANIMAL(S): F1 (C57BL6 X DBA2) and outbred (ICR) mice. INTERVENTION(S): Ovarian stroma cells of less than 40 mum in diameter were subcultured with fibroblast monolayer, and colony-forming cells were characterized. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Stemness, genotype, and imprinted gene methylation. RESULT(S): Two-lines of colony-forming cells were established, which expressed markers specific for embryonic stem cells (ESC) and formed embryoid bodies and teratomas. Complete matching of microsatellite markers with the cell donor strain confirmed their establishment from ovarian tissue, and identification of both homozygotic and heterozygotic chromosomes raised the possibility of their derivation from parthenogenetic oocytes. However, the use of cells smaller than mature oocytes for primary culture, the difference in imprinted gene methylation compared with parthenogenetic ESCs, and failure to establish the ESC-like cells by primary <e>follicle</e> culture collectively suggested the irrelevancy to gametes. CONCLUSION(S): Coculture of adult ovarian cells with somatic fibroblasts can yield colony-forming cells having ESC-like activity, which may provide an alternative for establishing autologous stem cells from adults that can be obtained without genetic manipulation.",M2
20188028,"Inherent capacity of the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropins is not influenced by the number of ovarian <e>follicles</e> &gt; or = 3 mm in diameter in cattle.We hypothesised that higher serum FSH concentrations in cattle with low v. high follicle numbers during follicular waves are caused by a different capacity of the pituitary gland to produce gonadotropins. Dairy cows with high (&gt; or = 30; n = 5) and low (&lt; or = 15; n = 5) follicle numbers were selected and serum concentrations of oestradiol and FSH during an oestrous cycle were measured. Cows were ovariectomised at oestrus and bled frequently up to 8 days after ovariectomy. After 33 days, cows were injected with gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and bled intensively up to 8 h after GnRH injection. One day later, animals were injected with follicular fluid (FF) from bovine follicles and were bled intensively up to 2 days after the first injection. Serum concentrations of FSH and LH were measured. After 2 days, cows were killed and their pituitary glands collected. Prior to ovariectomy, serum oestradiol concentrations were similar between groups, whereas FSH concentrations were higher in cattle with low v. high numbers of follicles. No differences were detected in serum gonadotropin concentrations after ovariectomy, GnRH injection or FF challenge between groups. The results indicate that the inherent capacity of the pituitary gland to secrete gonadotropins does not differ between cattle with high v. low numbers of follicles during follicular waves.",M2
20172968,"Female mice expressing constitutively active mutants of FSH receptor present with a phenotype of premature <e>follicle</e> depletion and estrogen excess.Strong gain-of-function mutations have not been identified in humans in the FSH receptor (FSHR), whereas such mutations are common among many other G protein-coupled receptors. In order to predict consequences of such mutations on humans, we first identified constitutively activated mutants of the mouse (m) Fshr and then expressed them under the human anti-Müllerian hormone promoter in transgenic mice or created knock-in mutation into the mouse genome. We show here that mutations of Asp580 in the mFSHR significantly increase the basal receptor activity. D580H and D580Y mutations of mFSHR bind FSH, but the activity of the former is neither ligand-dependent nor promiscuous towards LH/human choriogonadotropin stimulation. Transgenic expression of mFshr(D580H) in granulosa cells leads to abnormal ovarian structure and function in the form of hemorrhagic cysts, accelerated loss of small follicles, augmented granulosa cell proliferation, increased estradiol biosynthesis, and occasional luteinized unruptured follicles or teratomas. The most affected mFshr(D580H) females are infertile with disturbed estrous cycle and decreased gonadotropin and increased prolactin levels. Increased estradiol and prolactin apparently underlie the enhanced development of the mammary glands, adenomatous pituitary growth, and lipofuscin accumulation in the adrenal gland. The influence of the mFSHR(D580Y) mutation is milder, mainly causing hemorrhagic cysts in transgenic mFSHR(D580Y) and mFSHR(D580Y) -knock-in mice. The results demonstrate that gain-of-function mutations of the FSHR in mice bring about distinct and clear changes in ovarian function, informative in the search of similar mutations in humans.",M2
20172211,"Naturally occurring mastitis effects on timing of ovulation, steroid and gonadotrophic hormone concentrations, and follicular and luteal growth in cows.The effects of naturally occurring subclinical chronic or clinical short-term mastitis on time of ovulation, plasma steroid and gonadotropin concentrations, and follicular and luteal dynamics were examined in 73 lactating Holstein cows. Cows were sorted by milk somatic cell count and bacteriological examination into an uninfected group (n=22), a clinical mastitis group (n=9; events occurring 20+/-7 d before the study), and a subclinical chronic mastitis group (n=42). In addition, uninfected and mastitic cows were further sorted by their estrus to ovulation (E-O) interval. About 30% of mastitic cows (mainly subclinical) manifested an extended E-O interval of 56+/-9.2h compared with 28+/-0.8h in uninfected cows and 29+/-0.5h in the other 70% of mastitic cows. In mastitic cows with extended E-O interval, the concentration of plasma estradiol at onset of estrus was lower than that of uninfected cows or mastitic cows that exhibited normal E-O intervals (3.1+/-0.4, 5.8+/-0.5, and 5.5+/-0.5 pg/mL, respectively). The disruptive effect of mastitis on follicular estradiol probably does not involve alterations in gonadotropin secretion because any depressive effects of mastitis on pulsatile LH concentrations were not detected. Cortisol concentrations did not differ among groups. The preovulatory LH surge in mastitic cows with delayed ovulation varied among individuals, being lower, delayed, or with no surge noted compared with the normal LH surge exhibited by uninfected cows or mastitic cows with normal E-O interval (6.8+/-0.7 ng/mL). The diameter of the second-wave dominant <e>follicle</e> was larger and the number of medium follicles was smaller in uninfected and subclinical cows with normal intervals compared with subclinical cows with extended intervals (13.4+/-0.5 vs. 10.9+/-0.9mm, and 3.8+/-0.2 vs. 6.7+/-0.14 follicles, respectively). Mid-luteal progesterone concentrations were similar in uninfected and mastitic cows. These results indicate for the first time that around 30% of cows with subclinical chronic mastitis exhibit delayed ovulation that is associated with low plasma concentrations of estradiol and a low or delayed preovulatory LH surge.",M2
20170740,"A role for the lysosomal protease cathepsin B in zebrafish follicular apoptosis.This study presents evidence that cathepsin B, a lysosomal protease, may be involved in the regulation of apoptosis during serum-starvation in teleost <e>follicles</e>. Zebrafish vitellogenic follicles were isolated, incubated under serum-free conditions and homogenized. The follicle extracts demonstrated caspase-3-like activity using the fluorogenic substrate DEVD-AMC, indicating the onset of apoptosis. Cathepsin B activity as measured using the fluorogenic cathepsin B substrate, Z-Arg-Arg-AMC was elevated within the first 6h of incubation in serum-free media and coincided with the onset of apoptosis. This increase in cathepsin B activity was sensitive to the cathepsin B inhibitor, CA-074-ME. Furthermore, adding CA-074-ME to the follicle incubation blocked caspase-3-like activation, suggesting that cathepsin B activity is a positive regulator of the apoptotic cascade during serum-starvation. Interestingly, the increase in cathepsin-B-like activity was not preceded by an increase in cathepsin B mRNA transcription, suggesting that regulation of this enzyme is at a level other than of the gene. These results suggest a regulatory role for cathepsin B during follicular apoptosis in zebrafish ovarian follicles.",M2
20166196,"Altered sex hormone concentrations and gonadal mRNA expression levels of activin signaling factors in hatchling alligators from a contaminated Florida lake.Activins and estrogens participate in regulating the breakdown of ovarian germ cell nests and <e>follicle</e> assembly in mammals. In 1994, our group reported elevated frequencies of abnormal, multioocytic ovarian follicles in 6 month old, environmental contaminant-exposed female alligators after gonadotropin challenge. Here, we investigated if maternal contribution of endocrine disrupting contaminants to the egg subsequently alters estrogen/inhibin/activin signaling in hatchling female offspring, putatively predisposing an increased frequency of multioocytic follicle formation. We quantified basal and exogenous gonadotropin-stimulated concentrations of circulating plasma steroid hormones and ovarian activin signaling factor mRNA abundance in hatchling alligators from the same contaminated (Lake Apopka) and reference (Lake Woodruff) Florida lakes, as examined in 1994. Basal circulating plasma estradiol and testosterone concentrations were greater in alligators from the contaminated environment, whereas activin/inhibin betaA subunit and follistatin mRNA abundances were lower than values measured in ovaries from reference lake animals. Challenged, contaminant-exposed animals showed a more robust increase in plasma estradiol concentration following an acute follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) challenge compared with reference site alligators. Aromatase and follistatin mRNA levels increased in response to an extended FSH challenge in the reference site animals, but not in the contaminant-exposed animals. In hatchling alligators, ovarian follicles have not yet formed; therefore, these endocrine differences are likely to affect subsequent ovarian development, including ovarian follicle assembly.",M2
20158943,"7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene induces sertoli-leydig-cell tumors in the <e>follicle</e>-depleted ovaries of mice treated with 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide.Ovarian cancer is associated with high mortality due to its late onset of symptoms and lack of reliable screening methods for early detection. Furthermore, the incidence of ovarian cancer is higher in postmenopausal women. Mice rendered follicle-depleted through treatment with 4-vinylcyclohexene diepoxide (VCD) are a model of ovary-intact menopause. The present study was designed to induce ovarian neoplasia in this model by treating mice with 7,12-dimethylbenz[a]anthracene (DMBA). Female B6C3F1 mice (age, 28 d) received intraperitoneal sesame oil (vehicle; VCD- groups) as a control or VCD (160 mg/kg; VCD+ groups) daily for 20 d to cause ovarian failure. Four months after the onset of dosing, mice from each group received a single injection of DMBA (VCD-DMBA+ and VCD+DMBA+ groups, n = 15 per group) or vehicle control (VCD-DMBA-, n = 15; VCD+ DMBA-, n = 14) under the bursa of the right ovary. Ovaries were collected 3 or 5 mo after injection and processed for histologic evaluation. Immunohistochemistry was used to confirm classification of neoplasms. None of the animals in the VCD-DMBA- and VCD-DMBA+ groups (that is, mice still undergoing estrus) had tumors at either time point. At the 3-mo time point, 12.5% of the VCD+DMBA+ mice had ovarian tumors; at 5 mo, 57.1% of the VCD+DMBA+ and 14.3% of VCD+DMBA- ovaries had neoplasms. Neoplasms stained positively for inhibin alpha (granulosa cells) and negatively for keratin 7 (surface epithelium), thus confirming classification of the lesions as Sertoli-Leydig cell tumors. These findings provide evidence for an increased incidence of DMBA-induced ovarian neoplasms in the ovaries of follicle-depleted mice compared with that in age-matched cycling controls.",M2
20156346,"Age-dependent role of steroids in the regulation of growth of the hen follicular wall.BACKGROUND: The ovaries are the primary targets of senescence effects in mammalian and avian species. In the present study, relationships between reproductive aging, sex steroids and the growth pattern of the pre-ovulatory <e>follicle</e> wall were investigated using young hens with long clutch (YLC), old hens with long clutch (OLC), old hens with short clutch (OSC), and old hens with interrupted long clutch (OILC). METHODS: Experiment 1: Hens were sacrificed 1.5 and 14.5 h after ovulation. Experiment 2: YLC and OILC hens were sacrificed 3.5 h after treatments with LH and/or aminoglutethimide (AG), an inhibitor of steroid synthesis. Volumes of pre-ovulatory follicles (F1-F5) and plasma concentrations of ovarian steroids were determined. Experiment 3: Granulosa and theca cells from F3 follicles of OSC and/or YLC hens were exposed in vitro to estradiol-17beta (E2), testosterone (T) and LH and the proliferative activity of the cells was examined using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Assay. RESULTS: In YLC and OLC groups, the total volume of F1-F5 follicles rose between 1.5 and 14.5 h after ovulation (P &lt; 0.01), negatively correlating with the plasma level of E2 (P &lt; 0.01). There was no growth of pre-ovulatory follicles in the middle of the ovulatory cycle in the OSC group, with a positive correlation being present between E2 and the follicular volume (P &lt; 0.05). In young hens, AG caused a rise in the total follicular volume. This rise was associated with a fall in E2 (r = -0.54, P &lt; 0.05). E2 enhanced proliferation of granulosa cells from YLC and OSC groups. The proliferative activity of granulosa and theca cells of YLC hens depended on the interaction between T and LH (P &lt; 0.01). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate for the first time that the growth pattern of pre-ovulatory follicles during the ovulatory cycle changes in the course of reproductive aging. E2 seems to play a dual role in this adjustment; it stimulates the growth of the follicular wall in reproductive aged hens, whereas it may inhibit this process in young birds. T and LH are apparently involved in the growth regulation during the pre-ovulatory surge in young hens.",M2
20153129,"Modulating peripheral gonadotrophin levels affects follicular expression of mRNAs encoding insulin-like growth factor binding proteins in sheep.Evidence suggests that the insulin-like growth factor binding proteins (IGFBPs) are involved in modulating the role that IGF-I and -II play in regulating follicular growth and development in sheep. However, little information exists as to the role that key peripheral factors play in regulating the expression of IGFBP components within the <e>follicle</e>. The present study investigated the regulatory effects of FSH and LH on gene expression for IGFBP-2 to -6 in ovine follicles, using bovine follicular fluid (bFF) and gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist (GnRHa) model systems to perturb endogenous gonadotrophin secretion. Gene expression studies were carried out using in situ hybridisation with sheep-specific ribonucleotide probes. Treatment of ewes with bFF had few consistent effects on IGFBP-3 and -4 mRNA expression in follicles, whereas bFF treatment resulted in significant decreases in IGFBP-2 and IGFBP-6 mRNA expression in only medium follicles 60 h after onset of bFF, and in follicles 12h after the onset of bFF, respectively. Treatment of ewes with GnRHa resulted in transient significantly increased IGFBP-2 mRNA in healthy follicles in comparison to early atretic or atretic follicles 12h post-GnRHa (P&lt;0.05), in IGFBP-3 mRNA in early atretic and atretic follicles 36 h post-GnRHa (P&lt;0.001), and IGFBP-5 mRNA in follicles 12h post-GnRHa (P&lt;0.001). In contrast, GnRHa treatment resulted in significant decreases in IGFBP-4 (P&lt;0.001) and IGFBP-6 (P&lt;0.01) mRNA expression in large follicles 36 h post-GnRHa, and atretic follicles by 60 h post-GnRHa, respectively. These data highlight that FSH and LH are involved, at least in part, in mediating the proliferative and differentiative changes in intrafollicular IGFBP levels that are observed during follicular growth and atresia in the sheep.",M2
20150576,"Serum anti-mullerian hormone concentrations are elevated in oligomenorrheic girls without evidence of hyperandrogenism.CONTEXT: Serum anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) levels are significantly elevated in adolescents with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) compared to normal controls. Whether adolescents with oligomenorrhea have elevated AMH levels is unknown. Objective: This study was performed to assess serum AMH levels in oligomenorrheic (OLIGO) girls without evidence of hyperandrogenism. DESIGN: This was a prospective study comparing AMH levels in OLIGO, PCOS, and normal control adolescents. SETTING: The study was conducted through four tertiary academic medical centers. PARTICIPANTS: The study groups were comprised of OLIGO (n = 24), PCOS (n = 153), and normal adolescent girls (n = 39), as well as PCOS (n = 73) and normal adult women (n = 36). INTERVENTIONS: In each subject, serum AMH levels were assessed in the early to midfollicular phases for regularly menstruating subjects and on an arbitrary day for OLIGO or PCOS subjects. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Basal serum AMH levels were assessed among OLIGO, PCOS, and normal girls, in addition to PCOS and normal women. RESULTS: OLIGO girls had serum AMH levels (5.33 +/- 0.47 ng/ml) that were significantly greater than the normal adolescents (3.05 +/- 0.31 ng/ml) and adults (2.33 +/- 0.22 ng/ml), but similar to values seen in the PCOS adolescents (5.28 +/- 0.26 ng/ml) and adults (6.36 +/- 0.47 ng/ml). Obese adolescents and PCOS women had significantly lower AMH levels compared to lean controls (P &lt; 0.02). CONCLUSION: In OLIGO adolescents, elevated serum AMH levels suggest increased antral <e>follicle</e> number similar to that observed in girls with PCOS.",M2
20150280,"The cytolinker Pigs is a direct target and a negative regulator of Notch signalling.Gas2-like proteins harbour putative binding sites for both the actin and the microtubule cytoskeleton and could thus mediate crosstalk between these cytoskeletal systems. Family members are highly conserved in all metazoans but their in vivo role is not clear. The sole Drosophila Gas2-like gene, CG3973 (pigs), was recently identified as a transcriptional target of Notch signalling and might therefore link cell fate decisions through Notch activation directly to morphogenetic changes. We have generated a null mutant in CG3973 (pigs): pigs(1) mutants are semi-viable but adult flies are flightless, showing indirect flight muscle degeneration, and females are sterile, showing disrupted oogenesis and severe defects in <e>follicle</e> cell differentiation, similar to phenotypes seen when levels of Notch/Delta signalling are perturbed in these tissues. Loss of Pigs leads to an increase in Notch signalling activity in several tissues. These results indicate that Gas2-like proteins are essential for development and suggest that Pigs acts downstream of Notch as a morphogenetic read-out, and also as part of a regulatory feedback loop to relay back information about the morphogenetic state of cells to restrict Notch activation to appropriate levels in certain target tissues.",M2
20149359,"The role of autophagy in follicular development and atresia in rat granulosa cells.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the involvement of autophagy in folliculogenesis and its correlation with apoptosis. DESIGN: Animal model-based study. SETTING: University medical center. ANIMAL(S): Twenty-one day-old female Sprague-Dawley rats. INTERVENTION(S): Ovaries obtained from established immature rat models primed with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin (PMSG) were used for the induction of follicular development and atresia. Granulosa cells isolated from developing <e>follicles</e> were cultured in serum-free condition with or without follicle-stimulating hormone. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Microtubule-associated light-chain protein 3 (LC3) and autophagic vacuoles were used as autophagic markers, and cleaved caspase-3 was used as an apoptotic marker in ovaries and/or granulosa cells. RESULT(S): The LC3 protein was expressed mainly in granulosa cells during all developmental stages. In granulosa cells isolated from PMSG-primed immature rat ovaries, LC3-II expression showed a similar expression pattern to cleaved caspase-3. In addition, granulosa cells of atretic follicles that showed intense cleaved caspase-3 staining also showed intense LC3 immunoreactivity. An in vitro culture experiment revealed that the levels of LC3-II and cleaved caspase-3 proteins were gonadotropin-dependent. The induction and the gonadotropin dependency of granulosa cell autophagy were confirmed by the observation of autophagic vacuoles under transmission electron microscopy. CONCLUSION(S): These preliminary results suggest that autophagy is induced mainly in granulosa cells during folliculogenesis and shows good correlation with apoptosis.",M2
20138961,"Inhibitory effect of pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide on the initial stages of rat <e>follicle</e> development.Pituitary adenylate cyclase activating polypeptide (PACAP) is transiently expressed in preovulatory follicles of different species and positively affects parameters correlated with the ovulatory process. It has also been shown to be expressed in the interstitial tissue and in interstitial glandular cells in the proximity of primordial and preantral follicles. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether PACAP influences the recruitment of primordial follicles and the growth and differentiation of preantral follicles. Rat ovaries from 2-day-old animals were cultured for 5 days in the presence of PACAP. This treatment significantly inhibited the primordial to primary follicle transition. PACAP inhibited granulosa cell proliferation without affecting cell viability. PACAP also inhibited the growth of isolated preantral follicles cultured under basal conditions or in the presence of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH). These results suggest that PACAP is significantly involved in the cyclic recruitment of primordial follicles and in the FSH-dependent growth of preantral follicles.",M2
20138422,"Differentiation potential of germ line stem cells derived from the postnatal mouse ovary.General belief in reproductive biology is that in most mammals female germ line stem cells are differentiated to primary oocytes during fetal development and oogenesis starts from a pool of primordial <e>follicles</e> after birth. This idea has been challenged previously by using follicle kinetics studies and demonstration of mitotically active germ cells in the postnatal mouse ovary (Johnson et al., 2004; Kerr et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2008). However, the existence of a population of self-renewing ovarian germ line stem cells in postnatal mammals is still controversial (Eggan et al., 2006; Telfer et al., 2005; Gosden, 2004). Recently, production of offspring from a germ line stem cell line derived from the neonatal mouse ovary was reported (Zou et al., 2009). This report strongly supports the existence of germ line stem cells and their ability to expand in vitro. Recently, using a transgenic mouse model in which GFP is expressed under a germ cell-specific Oct-4 promoter, we isolated and generated multipotent cell lines from male germ line stem cells (Izadyar et al., 2008). Using the same strategy we isolated and derived cell lines from postnatal mouse ovary. Interestingly, ovarian germ line stem cells expanded in the same culture conditions as the male suggesting that they have similar requirements for their self-renewal. After 1 year of culture and many passages, ovarian germ line stem cells maintained their characteristics and telomerase activity, expressed germ cell and stem cell markers and revealed normal karyotype. As standard protocol for differentiation induction, these cells were aggregated and their ability to form embryoid bodies (EBs) was investigated. EBs generated in the presence of growth factors showed classical morphology and expressed specific markers for three germ layers. However, in the absence of growth promoting factors EBs were smaller and large cells with the morphological and molecular characteristics of oocytes were formed. This study shows the existence of a population of germ line stem cell in postnatal mouse ovary with multipotent characteristics.",M2

20138115,"Pig preovulatory oocytes modulate cumulus cell protein and gene expression in vitro.This study investigated the changes in protein and gene expression in oocytectomized cumulus cells (OOX) of medium-sized <e>follicles</e> from gilts, cultured with or without denuded oocytes isolated from large oestrogenic sow follicles. Proteomic analysis identified 14 proteins that were differentially expressed in OOX, of which the protein 14-3-3 eta, a signal transduction pathway modulator, was down-regulated in the presence of oocytes. Oocyte co-culture also down-regulated FSHR mRNA expression in OOX, as measured by real-time PCR, and FSHR and 14-3-3 eta mRNA abundance were positively correlated. The oocyte also up-regulated HSD3B mRNA, suggesting an effect on cumulus cell progesterone synthesis. Together with data on gene expression in granulosa cells during the follicular phase of the sow oestrous cycle, this study suggests that modulation of the expression of steroidogenesis related proteins and genes in cumulus cells by the porcine preovulatory oocyte reflects the specific physiological requirements of the preovulatory follicle.",M2
20106641,"A novel pattern of follicular epithelium morphogenesis in higher dipterans.In fly ovaries, the follicular epithelium surrounding germline cells diversifies into several morphologically distinct cell subpopulations. This complex process is crucial for the formation of a regionally complex eggshell and establishment of polarity of the future embryo. Morphogenetic changes accompanying patterning of the follicular epithelium have been best characterized in the model fly, Drosophila melanogaster. Here, we analyze follicular epithelium diversification in the ovaries of Tachypeza nubila, a brachyceran fly closely related to the group Cyclorrhapha, which also includes Drosophila. We provide morphological evidence that in Tachypeza, the diversification process differs from that described in the Drosophila model system in several important respects: (i) <e>follicle</e> cells differentiate into five subpopulations (versus eight in Drosophila); (ii) only one of these subpopulations (i.e. border cells) is migratory (versus four in Drosophila); (iii) the main body follicle cells form a uniform epithelium with no distinct border between follicle cells covering the nurse cell compartment and the oocyte; (iv) chorionic material is deposited not only on the surface of the oocyte but also on the nurse cells; (v) there is no centripetal migration of the follicle cells; (vi) the resulting eggshell is morphologically simple with no regional specializations except for the micropylar apparatus at the anterior pole of the oocyte. Our findings provide novel insights into the evolution of the follicle cell patterning and functioning in dipterans. A critical analysis of these processes in different dipteran groups strongly indicates that in Tachypeza, follicular epithelium diversification follows a distinct pattern, novel for higher dipterans.",M2
20105525,"Effects of dietary fats differing in n-6:n-3 ratio fed to high-yielding dairy cows on fatty acid composition of ovarian compartments, follicular status, and oocyte quality.The objectives were to determine the incorporation of dietary encapsulated fats differing in n-6:n-3 ratio into milk fat, plasma, and various ovarian compartments and to examine the effects on ovarian follicular status, preovulatory <e>follicle</e> characteristics, and oocyte quality. Twenty-four multiparous Israeli Holstein cows, averaging 114 d in milk, were assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups: 1) control (n=7), in which cows were fed a lactating cow diet; 2) E-FLAX (n=8), in which cows were fed a lactating cow diet that consisted of 1kg/d of encapsulated fat (3.8% of dry matter) containing 40.8% flaxseed oil, providing 242.2g of C18:3n-3 (low n-6:n-3 ratio); or 3) E-SUN (n=9), in which cows were fed a lactating cow diet that consisted of 1kg/d of encapsulated fat (3.8% of dry matter) containing 40.8% sunflower oil, providing 260.0g of C18:2n-6 (high n-6:n-3 ratio). Ovaries were monitored by ultrasonography for follicular status, and after synchronization, follicles &gt;7mm were aspirated and evaluated. Ovum pickup was performed (19 sessions for the control and E-FLAX groups and 11 for the E-SUN group), and in vitro maturation and oocyte fertilization were conducted. The E-FLAX treatment increased the proportions of C18:3n-3 (5.8 fold), C20:5n-3, and C22:5n-3 (approximately 4-fold) in milk fat as compared with the other 2 treatments. The proportion of C18:3n-3 fatty acid in plasma increased dramatically with the E-FLAX treatment, from 1.43 and 1.49% in the control and E-SUN groups, respectively, to 7.98% in the E-FLAX group. Consequently, the n-6:n-3 ratio in plasma was reduced from approximately 42 in the control and E-SUN groups to 6.74 in the E-FLAX group. Proportions of C18:3n-3 in follicular fluid and granulosa cells were approximately 5-fold higher in the E-FLAX group than in the other 2 groups. The percentage of C18:2n-6 in cumulus-oocyte complexes of cows in the E-SUN group was 54% higher than that in the E-FLAX group and was 2.4-fold higher than that in the control group; the proportion of C18:3n-3 in the E-FLAX group was 4.73% and was not detected in the other groups. The average numbers of 2- to 5-mm follicles on d 5 and 9 of the cycle were higher in the E-FLAX group than in the E-SUN group, whereas the average numbers of follicles &gt; or =10mm on d 5, 9, and 13 were higher in the E-SUN group than in the other 2 groups. The estrous cycles of the cows were synchronized and PGF(2alpha) was injected on d 16 to 17 of the cycle. The interval from PGF(2alpha) injection to behavioral estrus was longer in the E-FLAX group than in the E-SUN group, and the beginning of the luteal phase of the subsequent cycle was delayed. Concentrations of estradiol in follicular fluid of the preovulatory follicles were higher in the E-SUN group than in the E-FLAX group. The number of follicles aspirated by ovum pickup was higher in the E-FLAX group than in the control group, and the cleavage rate in the E-FLAX group was higher than in the control group, but not the E-SUN group. In conclusion, dietary n-3 fatty acids influenced the follicular status and increased the cleavage rate of oocytes as compared with those of control cows. These findings could be related to modifications of the fatty acid composition in plasma and ovarian compartments in response to dietary supplementation.",M2
20091563,"Interventions for 'poor responders' to controlled ovarian hyper stimulation (COH) in in-vitro fertilisation (IVF).BACKGROUND: The success of in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) depends on adequate <e>follicle</e> recruitment by using controlled ovarian stimulation with gonadotrophins. Failure to recruit adequate follicles is called 'poor response'. Various treatment protocols have been proposed that are targeted at this cohort of women, aiming to increase their ovarian response. OBJECTIVES: To compare the effectiveness of different treatment interventions in women who have poor response to controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (are poor responders) in the context of IVF. SEARCH STRATEGY: We searched the Cochrane Menstrual Disorders and Subfertility Group Specialised Register of controlled trials (MDSG) (5/1/2009), the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled trials (CENTRAL) (4th Quarter 2008), MEDLINE (1950 to November week 3 2008), EMBASE (1980 to 2008 week 52) and The National Research Register (NRR). The citation lists of relevant publications, review articles, abstracts of scientific meetings and included studies were also searched. The authors were contacted to clarify data that were unclear from the trial reports. SELECTION CRITERIA: Only randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing one type of intervention versus another for controlled ovarian stimulation of poor responders to a previous IVF treatment, using a standard long protocol were included. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two reviewers independently scanned the abstracts, identified relevant papers, assessed trial quality and extracted relevant data for inclusion. Validity was assessed in terms of method of randomisation, completeness of treatment cycle and co-intervention. Where possible, data were pooled for analysis. MAIN RESULTS: The new search identified fifteen trials. Three trials were eligible for inclusion. Ten trials involving eight different comparison groups have been included. Only one trial reported live birth rates.The number of oocytes retrieved were significantly less in the conventional GnRHa long protocol compared to stop protocol and GnRH antagonist protocol.Total dose of gonadotrophins used was significantly higher in the GnRHa long protocol group compared to the Stop protocol and GnRH antagonist groups.Cancellation rates were significantly higher in the GnRHa flare up group compared to the GnRHa long protocol group.None of the studies reported a difference in the miscarriage and ectopic pregnancy rates. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is insufficient evidence to support the routine use of any particular intervention either for pituitary down regulation, ovarian stimulation or adjuvant therapy in the management of poor responders to controlled ovarian stimulation in IVF. More robust data from good quality RCTs with relevant outcomes are needed.",M2
20083604,"Endogenous folates and single-carbon metabolism in the ovarian <e>follicle</e>, oocyte and pre-implantation embryo.Maternal B-vitamin status at conception can affect fertility and the health of offspring. This study details transcript expression for genes encoding key enzymes in the linked methionine/folate cycles in the bovine oocyte, somatic cells of the ovarian follicle and pre-implantation embryo. Transcripts for all 12 enzymes that were studied and for the two folate receptors (FOLR1 and FOLR2) and reduced folate carrier (SLC19A1) were expressed in liver cells, but transcripts for betaine-homocysteine methyltransferase and methionine adenosyl transferase 1A were absent in all ovarian cells, and transcripts for FOLR2 were absent in embryonic cells. Transcripts for glycine methyltransferase were also absent/weak in cumulus and granulosa cells. The absence of these enzymes could have a profound effect on single-carbon metabolism within the ovary and pre-implantation embryo. Immunocytochemical analysis revealed SLC19A1 protein expression on the plasma and basal-lateral membranes of the pre-implantation embryo. The folate antagonist methotrexate (MTX) enters the cell via SLC19A1, and in the current study, MTX inclusion in bovine/ovine culture media at either 1 or 10 microM from the 1-cell stage inhibited embryo development beyond the 8-cell stage. Hypoxanthine and thymidine (100 microM) increased the proportion of embryos that developed to blastocysts, but the cell number was reduced by 20%. The reduced uptake of [(35)S] methionine into intra-cellular S-adenosylmethionine and S-adenosylhomocysteine pools, together with reduced uptake of glutamate and tryptophan, was consistent with depleted intra-cellular pools of reduced folates. These data provide an insight into the importance of maternal dietary folate/B-vitamin status during the peri-conceptional period.",M2
20079584,"Luteal function induced by transvaginal ultrasonic-guided follicular aspiration in mares.Ultrasonic-guided transvaginal <e>follicle</e> aspiration was performed in 58 crossbreed mares in order to determine whether aspiration of various dominant follicle diameters resulted in luteal tissue capable of producing progesterone (P(4)). The mares were randomly assigned to three groups according to follicular diameter (25-29 mm; 30-35 mm and &gt;35 mm). Mares that had ovulations naturally served as controls. The serum progesterone (P(4)) concentrations in the aspirated mares were greater (P &lt; 0.0001; r(2) = 0.6687; CV = 21.52) in mares with natural ovulation compared to mares with aspirated follicles regardless of groups. Serum P(4) concentration in aspired mares with follicular diameter of 25-29 mm declined 0.365 ng/ml/day (P = 0.0065) from the day of aspiration (D0) up to D8. In mares with follicle diameter of 30-35 mm, serum P(4) concentration increased (0.258 ng/ml/day; P = 0.001), as well as in the mares with follicles &gt;35 mm diameter (0.481 ng/ml/day; P &lt; 0.0001), and in mares with natural ovulation (1.236 ng/ml/day; P &lt; 0.0001). Out of the 25 mares with follicular aspirations that formed Corpora hemorragica (P(4) &gt;1 ng/ml), 23 (92%) had greater (&gt;2 ng/ml) serum P(4) concentrations on Day 8 after aspiration. Of these 23 mares, 75% were in the 25-29 mm group, 9/10 (90%) in the 30-35 mm group, and 11/11 (100%) of the mares in the &gt;35 mm follicular diameter group had luteinization (P(4) &gt;2 ng/ml). These results suggest that a functional Corpus luteum can be induced in mares using follicular aspiration and that a minimum 35 mm follicular diameter is needed to reach a progesterone serum concentration compatible with that of a Corpus luteum produced by natural ovulation.",M2
20074723,"Markers of growth and development in primate primordial <e>follicles</e> are preserved after slow cryopreservation.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of slow cryopreservation on the morphology and function of primate primordial follicles within ovarian tissue slices. DESIGN: Fresh monkey ovarian tissue was frozen by slow cryopreservation and thawed for analysis of morphologic and functional parameters. SETTING: University-affiliated laboratory. ANIMALS: Rhesus monkey ovarian tissue. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Histologic analysis, follicle counting, assessment of protein abundance and localization. RESULT(S): After freezing and thawing, 89% of the primordial follicles maintained their laminar-based architecture, with sizes close to those of fresh fixed follicles. Molecular markers of early follicle health (activin subunits and the phosphorylated form of the signaling protein Smad2 [pSmad2]) were present in fresh and frozen-thawed primordial follicles. Stroma cells, but not follicles, had a higher level of TUNEL staining. Granulosa cells within the follicles of frozen-thawed ovarian tissue cultured for 48 hours had the capacity to proliferate and sustained expression of the activin subunits and nuclear pSmad2. CONCLUSION(S): This study provides evidence that markers of early follicle growth and development are preserved after slow cryopreservation and thaw, with little effect on follicle morphology and function.",M2
20071017,"Ovarian follicular dynamics, <e>follicle</e> deviation, and oocyte yield in Gyr breed (Bos indicus) cows undergoing repeated ovum pick-up.The objective of this study was to evaluate ovarian follicular dynamics during intervals between successive ovum pick-up (OPU) and determine its effects on the number and quality of recovered cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs) in Zebu cows (Bos indicus). Pluriparous nonlactating Gyr cows (Bos indicus; n=10) underwent four consecutive OPU sessions at 96-h intervals. The dynamics of ovarian follicular growth between OPU sessions was monitored by twice-daily ultrasonographic examinations. A single dominant follicle (DF) or two codominant (CDF) follicles (&gt;9mm) were present in 63.3% (19 of 30) of intervals studied, with follicle deviation beginning when the future dominant follicle (F1) achieved a diameter of 6.2+/-0.3mm. The phenomenon of codominance was observed in four (13.3%) of the inter-OPU intervals. The remaining intervals (36.6%, 11 of 30) were characterized by a greater follicular population, lower rate of follicular growth, and a smaller diameter F1 (P&lt;0.0001). There was a tendency (P=0.08) toward an increase in the number of recovered COCs when dominant follicles were not present (NDF). The quality of COCs was not affected by the presence of a single dominant follicle, but codominant follicles resulted in recovery of a lower proportion of viable embryos (40.0%, 62.1%, and 63.6%; P&lt;0.05) and higher proportions of degenerate COCs (56.0%, 30.3%, and 28.6%; P&lt;0.05) for CDF, NDF, and DF respectively. We concluded that, in Zebu cows, (a) repeated follicle aspirations altered ovarian follicular dynamics, perhaps by increasing follicular growth rate; (b) follicular dominance could be established in cows undergoing twice-a-week OPU; and (c) the presence of a dominant follicle during short inter-OPU intervals may not affect COC quality, except when a codominant follicle was present.",M2
20064216,"Intact fetal ovarian cord formation promotes mouse oocyte survival and development.BACKGROUND: Female reproductive potential, or the ability to propagate life, is limited in mammals with the majority of oocytes lost before birth. In mice, surviving perinatal oocytes are enclosed in ovarian <e>follicles</e> for subsequent oocyte development and function in the adult. Before birth, fetal germ cells of both sexes develop in clusters, or germline cysts, in the undifferentiated gonad. Upon sex determination of the fetal gonad, germ cell cysts become organized into testicular or ovarian cord-like structures and begin to interact with gonadal somatic cells. Although germline cysts and testicular cords are required for spermatogenesis, the role of cyst and ovarian cord formation in mammalian oocyte development and female fertility has not been determined. RESULTS: Here, we examine whether intact fetal ovarian germ and somatic cell cord structures are required for oocyte development using mouse gonad re-aggregation and transplantation to disrupt gonadal organization. We observed that germ cells from disrupted female gonad prior to embryonic day e13.5 completed prophase I of meiosis but did not survive following transplantation. Furthermore, re-aggregated ovaries from e13.5 to e15.5 developed with a reduced number of oocytes. Oocyte loss occurred before follicle formation and was associated with an absence of ovarian cord structure and ovary disorganization. However, disrupted ovaries from e16.5 or later were resistant to the re-aggregation impairment and supported robust oocyte survival and development in follicles. CONCLUSIONS: Thus, we demonstrate a critical window of oocyte development from e13.5 to e16.5 in the intact fetal mouse ovary, corresponding to the establishment of ovarian cord structure, which promotes oocyte interaction with neighboring ovarian somatic granulosa cells before birth and imparts oocytes with competence to survive and develop in follicles. Because germline cyst and ovarian cord structures are conserved in the human fetal ovary, the identification of genetic components and molecular mechanisms of pre-follicle stage germ and somatic cell structures may be important for understanding human female infertility. In addition, this work provides a foundation for development of a robust fetal ovarian niche and transplantation based system to direct stem cell-derived oocyte differentiation as a potential therapeutic strategy for the treatment of infertility.",M2
20056831,"Kit ligand and the somatostatin receptor antagonist, BIM-23627, stimulate in vitro resting <e>follicle</e> growth in the neonatal mouse ovary.In the mammalian ovary, kit ligand (KL), coded by a cAMP-stimulatable gene, is a protein that promotes initiation of follicle growth. The neuropeptide somatostatin (SST) is a small peptide that inhibits cAMP generation in many cell types. Consequently, SST receptor agonists might alter KL production and subsequent follicle growth. The present study was undertaken to look for the existence of a functional SST system in the mouse ovary, to test the effects of the SST receptor 2 (SSTR-2) antagonist BIM-23627 on in vitro folliculogenesis, and to compare them with those of KL, which was demonstrated to stimulate follicle growth in the neonatal rat ovary. Pairs of ovaries from 5-d-old mice were incubated in vitro during 15 d in the presence of either KL or BIM-23627. For every mouse, one ovary was cultured in culture medium (control), and the other ovary was cultured in the presence of either KL or BIM-23627. After 5, 10, and 15 d culture, the ovaries were histologically assessed for the content of primordial, primary, and secondary follicles. The SSTR-2 and -5, but not SST, were identified at the transcriptional and translational (mainly in granulosa cells) levels. Both KL and BIM-23627 triggered a reduction of the percentages of primordial follicles and an increase of the percentages of primary and secondary follicles when compared with control ovaries from the same animal. In conclusion, extraovarian SST, acting through its receptors 2 and 5 present on granulosa cells, may be involved in mouse folliculogenesis by reducing recruitment of resting follicles.",M2
20056201,"Acquisition and loss of oocyte meiotic and developmental competence during in vitro antral <e>follicle</e> growth in mouse.OBJECTIVE: To analyze the effect of various culture periods and FSH on oocyte competence in cultured mouse follicles. DESIGN: Controlled in vitro laboratory experiment. SETTING: Academic research environment. INTERVENTION(S): DNA staining, maturation induction, parthenogenesis, and IVF were performed after various periods of oocyte culture. Additionally, FSH modulation during preantral follicle growth was studied. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE(S): Nucleolar conformation, meiotic resumption, activation potential, and preimplantation development were recorded. RESULT(S): Surrounded nucleolus (SN) conformation was found in oocytes cultured for 8 days and correlated by time with meiotic competence. Culture for 12 days increased oocyte diameter (day 8 69.8 mum vs. day 12 72.4 mum) and meiotic competence (day 8 63% vs. day 12 81% polar body oocytes), but decreased fertilization rate (day 8 75% vs. day 12 53% 2-cell embryos). Equal activation potential (49%) on both days indicated that impaired sperm entry could not account for lower fertilization rate after 12 days. Depriving early follicular growth of FSH delayed antrum formation but not SN conformation. CONCLUSION(S): Fertilization of cultured oocytes is most efficient close to the completion of SN. Omitting FSH from early follicle growth could not postpone the early onset of SN, which seems to be imposed by the time spent in vitro.",M2
20042232,"The expression of angiogenic growth factors and their receptors in ovarian <e>follicles</e> throughout the estrous cycle in the ewe.Healthy follicles are highly vascularized whereas those undergoing atresia have poor vascularity, suggesting a relationship between follicular vascularization and follicular function. Vascularization is regulated by angiogenic factors, and among them vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and angiopoietin-Tie (Ang-Tie) systems are of central importance. The objectives of this study were to determine if VEGF, VEGF receptor-2 (VEGFR-2), and components of the Ang-Tie system are expressed in ovarian follicles at both the protein and mRNA levels and to explore if their expression is related to the stage of the estrous cycle in the ewe. Ovaries from cyclic ewes were collected during the luteal phase (n=5) or before (n=5), during (n=4), and after (n=4) the preovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge. After fixation, ovaries were wax-embedded, serially sectioned, and analyzed for both protein and mRNA expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, angiopoietin-1 (Ang-1), angiopoietin-2 (Ang-2), Tie-1 (mRNA only), and Tie-2. mRNA was studied by in situ hybridization using digoxigenin-11-UTP-labeled ovine riboprobes. A similar pattern of expression was observed for mRNA and protein for all of the factors. Both mRNA and protein expression of VEGF, VEGFR-2, Ang-1, Ang-2, Tie-1 (mRNA only), and Tie-2 in the granulosa and theca cells of follicles &gt;or=2mm in diameter was significantly different among the stages of the estrous cycle, with the highest expression detected at the post-LH surge stage. Theca cells expressed significantly greater levels of the six angiogenic factors compared with granulosa cells at all stages of the estrous cycle. Expression levels in granulosa and theca cells were comparable between small (2.0 to 2.5mm) and medium (2.5 to 4.0mm) follicles, but large follicles (&gt;4.0mm) expressed higher mRNA and protein levels (all P&lt;0.05) for all factors at all stages of the estrous cycle. These data show (i) that VEGF, VEGFR-2, and the Ang-Tie system are present in both granulosa and theca cells of the ovarian follicle, (ii) that thecal cells consistently express greater levels of all of these factors compared with granulosa cells, and (iii) that their levels of expression are related to the stage of the estrous cycle and to follicle size.",M2
20041799,"Investigation of the effects of Aloe barbadensis on rat ovaries: a preliminary study.Effects of Aloe barbadensis, a type of Aloe vera, on ovaries were investigated during pregnancy. A. vera gel, a commercial and nontherapeutic form of A. barbadensis, was used for this purpose. Three groups (one control and two test groups) of female Wistar albino rats with no prior births were studied. Group I was administered 25 mg (140 mg/kg) of A. barbadensis/day both orally and through gavage. A. barbadensis was contained in capsules with 500 mg of soybean oil; therefore Group II was administered 500 mg of soybean oil. Group III was the control group. All three groups were given normal food and water ad libitum. The substance had been administered for 20 days until birth. Ovaries were examined histologically. Vascular increase and the hyperemic form of ovary in the group administered A. barbadensis were notable. Decrease in primary <e>follicle</e> numbers, increase in secondary follicle numbers, and diminishment of secondary follicle diameters occurred in ovaries. The histological changes imply an angiogenesis effect of A. barbadensis and an effect like that of follicle-stimulating hormone in ovaries.",M2
20036087,"Transvaginal follicular aspiration and embryo development in superstimulated early postpartum beef cows and subsequent fertility after artificial insemination.This study was conducted to investigate in early postpartum suckled beef cows with and without FSH pre-stimulation: (i) the influence of the postpartum period on the number and quality of oocytes recovered by ovum pick-up (OPU), (ii) the overall efficiency of the OPU/IVP embryos from days 30 to 80 postpartum and (iii) if repeated OPU negatively affect fertility following a fixed-time artificial insemination protocol. After parturition suckled Angus cows (n = 30) were divided in three groups (n = 10 group(-1)). All cows were anestrous at the commencement of experimental treatments (30.0 +/- 3.2 days postpartum, mean +/- SD; range 25-34 days). Group 1 treatments included: dominant <e>follicle</e> ablation (DFA), FSH treatment and OPU procedure 5 days after DFA. A total of 9 mg FSH (Ovagen) was administered s.c. once a day over 2 days at equal doses (4.5 + 4.5mg). For fertility test the cows received an intravaginal progesterone treatment from Days 78 to 86 postpartum and were fixed-time artificially inseminated (FTAI) at 56 and 72 h after device removal. Group 2: as cited for Group 1 with no FSH treatment. In both groups, OPU was repeated four times (Days 35, 49, 63 and 77 postpartum) and the collected oocytes classified as viable were in vitro matured, fertilized and presumptive embryos cultured for 8 days. Group 3 (Control FTAI): cows that had not previously aspirations were FTAI as Groups 1 and 2. Pregnancy was diagnosed by means ultrasonography 39 days after FTAI. The numbers (mean +/- SEM) of follicles visible and aspirated at the time of OPU in FSH-treated cows were greater (P &lt; 0.05) than in non-treated cows (10.6 +/- 0.6 and 8.4 +/- 0.4 vs. 8.0 +/- 0.5 and 4.6 +/- 0.3, respectively). Following FSH treatment, the number (mean +/- SEM) of recovered oocytes per cow per OPU session and percentage of viable oocytes were greater in the treated (P &lt; 0.05) than in non-treated animals (3.0 +/- 0.1 and 39.5% vs. 1.5 +/- 0.1 and 30.0%). The cleavage and embryo development rates were similar (P &gt; 0.05) for both groups (14.8 and 6.4% vs. 16.6 and 5.5%). After FTAI the pregnancy rates were not different (P &gt; 0.05) among groups (70, 60 and 90% for Groups 1, 2 and 3, respectively). We can conclude that (1) FSH-treated suckled postpartum cows can be a source of oocytes for in vitro fertilization and (2) repeated DFA/OPU applied during postpartum period did not affect the subsequent fertility following FTAI.",M2
20035550,"Evaluation of ovotoxicity in female mice caused by organic extracts in tap water from Jialing River in Chongqing, China.BACKGROUND: Recently, toxic effects of widespread organic pollutants have received much attention due to the hazards they pose to female reproductive health. The aim of the present study was to determine the female reproductive toxicity of organic extracts (OE) in tap water from the Jialing River in Chongqing, China. METHODS: In our experiment, Kunming female mice that exhibited normal estrous cycles were randomly divided into 4 groups, which included a control group (OE 0 L/kg bw) as well as low- (OE 12.5 L/kg bw/day), mid- (OE 25 L/kg bw/day), and high-dose (OE 50 L/kg bw/day) groups. Mice were continually administered intraperitoneal injections of OE at different doses for 5 consecutive days. On the 15th and 30th day after treatments, half of the mice were sacrificed separately. RESULTS: The results showed that OE decreased relative ovary weights and prolonged the duration of estrous cycle with concomitant increase in estrous phase. There was a significant decrease in the number of corpora lutea of OE-treated mice, but no significant differences were found in healthy and atretic <e>follicle</e> populations compared to control. Ultrastructure observation regarding granulosa cells of the ovary revealed that OE treatment caused mitochondrial swelling together with endoplasmic reticulum expansion. CONCLUSIONS: All these data indicate that OE could exert adverse effects on the development of ovary and also a slight suppressive effect on reproductive functions.",M2
20035108,"A clinical study of anestrus buffaloes in southern Nepal.Anestrus is one of the most important reproductive disorders in dairy buffaloes. The clinical features of anestrus in buffaloes, however, have not been well described. The objectives of this study were to describe the causes of anestrus in buffaloes and their reproductive performance after treatment under field conditions in southern Nepal. Of 135 anestrus buffalo cows, 61.4% had true anestrus with ovarian dysfunction and 33.3% had silent ovulation. In 111 buffalo heifers, 76.6% were in true anestrus and 18.9% had silent ovulation. The duration of anestrus after calving was longer than 6 months in 83% of buffalo cows and 61.5% of the buffalo cows had durations longer than 10 months. The interval between the last breeding and diagnosis of anestrus was more than 5 months in 67.4% of cows and heifers. Treatment of anestrus with prostaglandin F(2)alpha in cows and heifers with a corpus luteum resulted in higher pregnancy rates within one (P&lt;0.01) and two months (P&lt;0.05) after treatment as compared with treatment with a vitamin/mineral mixture. Buffalo cows and heifers with inactive ovaries bearing a dominant <e>follicle</e> were also successfully treated with gonadotropin releasing hormone, resulting in higher pregnancy rate within one month after treatment (P&lt;0.05). In conclusion, the predominant cause of anestrus in dairy buffaloes in this region was true anestrus with inactive ovaries, and the duration of anestrus after calving as well as breeding was extremely long. Routine reproductive examination and adequate hormone treatment may improve the reproductive performance of these buffaloes.",M2
20035000,"Sonographic changes after laparoscopic cystectomy compared with three-stage management in patients with ovarian endometriomas: a prospective randomized study.BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic surgery is the gold standard treatment for ovarian endometriomas. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of two different laparoscopic methods on sonographic indicators of ovarian reserve in the treated ovary. METHODS: In this prospective randomized clinical trial, 20 patients with endometriomas were randomly assigned to undergo either laparoscopic cystectomy (Group 1) or the 'three-stage procedure' (Group 2). All patients underwent ultrasound examination preoperatively and 6 months after laparoscopy. Another ultrasound examination was performed 12 months after intervention in order to detect any recurrence. We investigated the alterations in the residual ovarian volume, ovarian vascular supply and antral <e>follicle</e> count (AFC) on the ovary with the endometriotic cyst by transvaginal color Doppler ultrasonography. RESULTS: The residual ovarian volume and the lowest pulsatility and resistance indexes were found to be similar between the two groups before and 6 months after laparoscopic intervention. The AFC of the operated ovary was increased significantly (P = 0.002) in Group 2 compared with Group 1 after 6 months. One year after laparoscopy, two recurrences of endometriomas were detected in Group 2, although none were detected in Group 1 (P = 0.47). CONCLUSIONS: Ovarian volumes and vascularization were comparable among the two laparoscopic methods. On the contrary, functional ovarian tissue as determined by AFC was higher after the 'three-stage' procedure.",M2

Estrous cycles were 17.11+/-0.3 and 17.20+/-0.2 d long in cycles with three and four waves, respectively (P&gt;0.05). The first interwave interval and the interval from the emergence of the final wave to the day of ovulation were longer in cycles with three waves compared with those in cycles with four waves (P&lt;0.05). The growth phase (5.1+/-0.5 vs. 3.1+/-0.4 d) and life span (5.67+/-0.3 vs. 4.3+/-0.3 d) of the largest follicle growing in the last or ovulatory wave was longer in cycles with three waves compared with that in cycles with four waves (P&lt;0.05). The maximum diameter of the largest follicle was greater in the first wave and the ovulatory wave compared with that in other waves of the cycle (P&lt;0.05). The regression phase of the largest follicle growing in the first wave was longer in cycles with three waves compared with that in cycles with four waves (4.44+/-0.4 vs. 3.4+/-0.4 d; P&lt;0.05). The length of the life span, regression phase, and, although not significant in every case, FSH peak concentration and amplitude decreased across the cycle (P&lt;0.05). We concluded that estrous cycles with three or four follicular waves were confined within the same length of cycle in WWF ewes. In this study, there were no apparent endocrine or follicular characteristics that could explain the regulation of the different number of follicular waves (three vs. four) during cycles of similar length.",M2
20033367,"Increased ovarian <e>follicle</e> atresia in obese Zucker rats is associated with enhanced expression of the forkhead transcription factor FOXO1.It is well established that hyperinsulinemia, resulting from insulin resistance, plays a role in the pathophysiology of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). The aim of this study was to investigate if ovarian follicular development and atresia are impaired in obese hyperinsulinemic (fa/fa) Zucker rats. To gain insight into the molecular mechanism of follicular atresia, we also examined the expression and localization of forkhead transcription factor FOXO1, a major regulator of cell fate decisions such as differentiation, cell-cycle arrest, and cell death. Serum insulin but not gonadotropin levels were significantly higher in obese (fa/fa) rats when compared to lean controls. Total ovarian follicle number and the percentage of atretic follicles were also significantly increased in obese (fa/fa) rats. Follicle atresia was associated with nuclear accumulation of FOXO1 transcription factor in TUNEL-positive granulosa cells. These results suggest a role for FOXO1 in granulosa cell apoptosis and increased ovarian follicle atresia associated with hyperinsulinemia.",M2
20033213,"Dynamics of extracellular matrix in ovarian <e>follicles</e> and corpora lutea of mice.Despite the mouse being an important laboratory species, little is known about changes in its extracellular matrix (ECM) during follicle and corpora lutea formation and regression. Follicle development was induced in mice (29 days of age/experimental day 0) by injections of pregnant mare's serum gonadotrophin on days 0 and 1 and ovulation was induced by injection of human chorionic gonadotrophin on day 2. Ovaries were collected for immunohistochemistry (n=10 per group) on days 0, 2 and 5. Another group was mated and ovaries were examined on day 11 (n=7). Collagen type IV alpha1 and alpha2, laminin alpha1, beta1 and gamma1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2 and perlecan were present in the follicular basal lamina of all developmental stages. Collagen type XVIII was only found in basal lamina of primordial, primary and some preantral follicles, whereas laminin alpha2 was only detected in some preantral and antral follicles. The focimatrix, a specialised matrix of the membrana granulosa, contained collagen type IV alpha1 and alpha2, laminin alpha1, beta1 and gamma1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2, perlecan and collagen type XVIII. In the corpora lutea, staining was restricted to capillary sub-endothelial basal laminas containing collagen type IV alpha1 and alpha2, laminin alpha1, beta1 and gamma1 chains, nidogens 1 and 2, perlecan and collagen type XVIII. Laminins alpha4 and alpha5 were not immunolocalised to any structure in the mouse ovary. The ECM composition of the mouse ovary has similarities to, but also major differences from, other species with respect to nidogens 1 and 2 and perlecan.",M2
20032061,"Testosterone induces redistribution of forkhead box-3a and down-regulation of growth and differentiation factor 9 messenger ribonucleic acid expression at early stage of mouse folliculogenesis.Increasing evidence has shown that excess androgen may be a main cause of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). However, the molecular mechanism of androgen action on the ovary is unclear. To investigate the possible impacts of androgen on early follicular development, neonatal mouse ovaries mainly containing primordial <e>follicles</e> were cultured with testosterone. We demonstrated that the number of primary follicles was increased after 10 d culture with testosterone treatment via phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase/Akt pathway. Androgen induced Forkhead box (Foxo)-3a activation, and translocation of Foxo3a protein from oocyte nuclei to cytoplasm, which might be a key step for primordial follicle activation. Interestingly, testosterone was also capable of down-regulating growth and differentiation factor-9 expression via its receptor. In summary, we infer that intraovarian excess androgen in PCOS might result in excess early follicles by inducing oocyte Foxo3a translocation and follicular arrest by down-regulating growth and differentiation factor-9 expression.",M2
20032053,"Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) genes are expressed in the steroidogenic cells of the ovine ovary and are differentially regulated by members of the transforming growth factor-beta family.Inhibitor of differentiation (Id) proteins act during embryogenesis and development to repress gene transcription required for lineage commitment, while promoting cell growth. Growth factors belonging to the TGFbeta superfamily of signaling molecules, notably the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and activin, can regulate Id expression in these tissues. Id expression and function in adult physiology is less well determined, and we hypothesized a role for Id proteins in the adult mammalian ovary. Immunohistochemistry for Id1, Id2, Id3, and Id4 in the sheep ovary revealed consistent expression in granulosa and thecal cells of ovarian <e>follicles</e> throughout development. In atretic follicles, Id proteins were selectively down-regulated in thecal cells (P &lt; 0.0001). Additionally, Id1 was universally up-regulated in the cumulus cells adjacent to the oocyte. Immunohistochemistry for phospho (p)-smad 1/5/8 signaling components (stimulated by BMPs) showed a punctate pattern of expression whereas p-smad 2/3 (stimulated by activin) was ubiquitously expressed in follicles. Neither pathway, however, displayed differential staining in line with Id1 cumulus-specific expression, suggesting a more complex relationship between Id1 expression and TGFbeta signaling in these cells. Nevertheless, in vitro, stimulation of ovine granulosa cells with BMP6 or activin A led to a respective increase and decrease in Id1 (P &lt; 0.0001), Id2 (P &lt; 0.0001), Id3 (P &lt; 0.0001), and Id4 (P &lt; 0.05) transcripts, and Id1 gene expression was further manipulated by the oocyte-secreted factors BMP15 and growth differentiation factor 9 (P &lt; 0.001). These data confirm that TGFbeta signaling can regulate Id gene expression in the sheep ovarian follicle and suggest a functional role for the Id family in the mammalian ovary.",M2
20031956,"Effects of exogenous testosterone supplementation in gonadotrophin stimulated cycles.BACKGROUND: Various experiments suggest that ovarian follicular recruitment and growth may be increased by testosterone priming. Our aim was to determine the effects of exogenous testosterone supplementation in older women on ovarian folliculogenesis and steroidogenesis. METHODS: A prospective randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study was carried out. Twelve regularly menstruating non-obese women aged 38-45 years received a 12-day course of transdermal testosterone (2.5 mg per patch) or placebo patch, followed by 7 days of gonadotrophin stimulation. After at least a 1 month washout period, subjects underwent the same protocol using the opposite treatment. The main outcomes were follicular development (ultrasound measures) and hormone levels. RESULTS: Following gonadotrophin stimulation, there were no differences in average number of <e>follicles</e> over 10 mm diameter in cycles pre-treated with testosterone versus placebo [2.10 (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.11, 3.22) versus 2.08 (95% CI 1.03, 3.14), P = 0.55]. No crossover, period (first or second test) or sequence (order of treatment) effects were noted. As expected, total and free testosterone levels were increased following testosterone treatment (312.7 +/- 122.4 versus 12.3 +/- 4.5 ng/dl and 45.5+/- 16.7 versus 1.4 +/- 0.5 ng/dl, respectively, P &lt; 0.001) but no differences in free or total testosterone were noted by period. LH, FSH, estradiol and antral follicle counts before gonadotrophin stimulation were not altered by testosterone pretreatment or by period. CONCLUSIONS: Despite increased testosterone levels, a short course of androgens had no significant effect on the number of follicles over 10 mm during stimulation with FSH in women of late reproductive age.",M2
20031022,"Ongoing pregnancies from early retrieval of prematurely developing antral <e>follicles</e> after DHEA supplementation.Two patients with severely diminished ovarian reserve who were refractory to aggressive ovarian stimulation conceived with oocytes from prematurely developing antral follicles after dehydroepiandrosterone supplementation. The first patient had 11 and 14.5 mm, and the second patient had 13 mm antral follicles on cycle days 2 and 3 respectively. In the first case, no ovarian stimulation was performed, while the second case received one dose of gonadotrophins with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone antagonist. Following very early human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG) triggering on cycle day 5, when antral follicles reached 15 and 18.5 mm in the first case, and 19 mm in the second case, IVF intracytoplasmic sperm injection treatment resulted in pregnancies in both cases, which are currently ongoing at 35 and 14 weeks of gestation. The results in these patients show that pregnancy can be achieved in poor responder patients with prematurely developing antral follicles following early HCG triggering based on follicle size rather than cycle day, with no or minimal stimulation. Whether DHEA supplementation had any impact on the success of these cycles remains to be determined.",M2
20025631,"Glucocorticoid suppression of intraovarian levels of prostaglandins and plasminogen activator activity at ovulation in the rat ovary.AIM: Ovulation is a local physiological inflammatory process with active participation of inflammatory mediators and immune cells. To prevent extensive inflammatory injury to the <e>follicle</e> at ovulation there is also a local anti-inflammatory system at ovulation, converting the inactive glucocorticoid cortisone to the more potent cortisol. The aim of this study was to examine the effects of the potent glucocorticoid analogue, dexamethasone (DEX), on ovulation rate and the ovarian production of the ovulatory mediators prostaglandins (PG) and plasminogen activators (PA). METHODS: DEX (0.3, 3, or 100 microM) was administered to an in vitro rat ovarian perfusion system prior to the addition of an ovulation-inducing dose of luteinizing hormone (LH) and 3-isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX). Control ovaries were perfused only with LH + IBMX. Each perfusion experiment extended over 20 h with ovulation occurring in vitro around 12-15 h after hormonal stimulation. In a second set of perfusion experiments, extending over 10 h, the tissue levels of PG and PA activity in the ovary were evaluated at a time 2-5 h before anticipated ovulation. RESULTS: The median numbers of ovulated oocytes in the groups with DEX of 0.3, 3, and 100 microM were 17.0, 8.5 and 11.0 per treated ovary, respectively. These numbers were not different from those of LH + IBMX-controls (12.5). DEX (100 microM) suppressed tissue levels of PGE(2) and PA activity and decreased (DEX 3 microM, 100 microM) estradiol levels in the perfusion media. CONCLUSION: These results indicate that certain degrees of suppression of PG, PA activity, and estradiol are not sufficient to modulate ovulation rate and/or that glucocorticoids may positively modulate other mediator pathways that exert inhibitory influence on ovulation.",M2
20022436,"Ovarian follicular dynamics and hormonal secretory profiles in guanacos (Lama guanicoe).The objective of the present study was to describe ovarian activity in 11 adult non-mated guanacos, evaluated every second day for 40 days by transrectal ultrasonography and by plasma estradiol-17beta and progesterone concentrations. An inverse relationship (r = -0.29, P &lt; 0.001) was observed between the diameter of the largest ovarian <e>follicle</e> and the total number of follicles indicating that follicular growth in guanacos occurs in waves. The mean duration of follicular wave was 15.1 +/- 4.2 days with a range from 9 to 26. The follicular growth phase was 7.0 +/- 2.4 days, the static phase 3.0 +/- 1.2 days, the regression phase 5.2 +/- 2.1 days and the inter-wave interval was 12.6 +/- 5.6 days. The maximum follicular diameter in each follicular wave was 10.2 +/- 2.1 mm with a range from 7.2 to 16.1 mm. Inter-wave intervals of longer duration were associated with a larger maximum follicle diameter (P &lt; 0.001). Follicular activity alternated between ovaries in 93% of the waves with 48% of dominant follicles occurring in the left and 52% in the right ovary without differences (P &gt; 0.05). Plasma estradiol-17beta concentrations showed a wave-like pattern, varying from 20.0 to 92.1 pmol/L. Plasma progesterone concentrations remained below 1 nmol/L without any ultrasonic evidence of ovulation during the study. These results in guanacos suggest a follicular wave pattern more similar to the llama (Lama glama) than previously described in other South American and Old World camelid species.",M2
20020062,"Brownie, a gene involved in building complex respiratory devices in insect eggshells.BACKGROUND: Insect eggshells must combine protection for the yolk and embryo with provisions for respiration and for the entry of sperm, which are ensured by aeropyles and micropyles, respectively. Insects which oviposit the eggs in an egg-case have a double problem of respiration as gas exchange then involves two barriers. An example of this situation is found in the cockroach Blattella germanica, where the aeropyle and the micropyle are combined in a complex structure called the sponge-like body. The sponge-like body has been well described morphologically, but nothing is known about how it is built up. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: In a library designed to find genes expressed during late chorion formation in B. germanica, we isolated the novel sequence Bg30009 (now called Brownie), which was outstanding due to its high copy number. In the present work, we show that Brownie is expressed in the <e>follicle</e> cells localized in the anterior pole of the oocyte in late choriogenesis. RNA interference (RNAi) of Brownie impaired correct formation of the sponge-like body and, as a result, the egg-case was also ill-formed and the eggs were not viable. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Results indicate that the novel gene Brownie plays a pivotal role in building up the sponge-like body. Brownie is the first reported gene involved in the construction of complex eggshell respiratory structures.",M2
20018358,"Ovarian stimulation with <e>follicle</e>-stimulating hormone under increasing or minimal concentration of progesterone in dairy cows.The objective of this study was to investigate the effect of the presence or absence of Corpus luteum (CL) on the follicular population during superstimulation in dairy cows (Holstein-Friesian cattle). Animals were divided into two groups as follows: (1) Growing CL group (G1): Cows (n=7) received a total dose of 28 Armour units (AU) follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) through the first 4 d (twice daily) after spontaneous ovulation (Day 0). (2) CL Absence group (G2): Cows (n=10) received prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) at 9 or 10 d after ovulation. After 36h, all the follicles (larger than 5mm) were aspirated (Day 0). The FSH treatment started 24h after aspiration and continued for 4 d. The number of small (3 to &lt;5mm), medium (5 to &lt;8mm), and large (&gt; or = 8mm) follicles was examined on Days 1, 3, and 5 in all groups. Blood samples were collected daily for 5 d, and progesterone (P(4)), estradiol (E(2)), insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1), and growth hormone (GH) in plasma were measured by enzyme immunoassays. The results showed that in G1, the P(4) level increased gradually from 0.5 ng/mL at Day 1 to 2 ng/mL at Day 5, whereas in G2, the P(4) level was completely below 0.5 ng/mL. All cows of the G2 group showed an increase of E(2) at Day 3 or Day 4 followed by an increase of IGF-1 within 24h, while GH increased concomitantly with the E(2) increase in 8 of 10 trials. On the other hand, cows of the G1 group showed neither E(2) nor IGF-1 increase. Moreover, at the end of the treatment, the number of follicles in the G2 group was significantly increased compared with that of the G1 group (22.8+/-2.0 vs. 11.6+/-2.0). In conclusion, low P(4) level during FSH treatment enhanced multiple follicular growth and E(2) secretion, which was followed by increase of IGF-1 and GH. Therefore, the absence of the CL may play a critical role in the superovulation response by controlling the number of growing follicles.",M2
20014130,"Steady-state level of kit ligand mRNA in goat ovaries and the role of kit ligand in preantral <e>follicle</e> survival and growth in vitro.The aims of this study were to investigate steady-state level of Kit Ligand (KL) mRNA and its effects on in vitro survival and growth of caprine preantral follicles. RT-PCR was used to analyze caprine steady-state level of KL mRNA in primordial, primary, and secondary follicles, and in small (1-3 mm) and large (3-6 mm) antral follicles. Furthermore, ovarian fragments were cultured for 1 or 7 days in Minimal Essential Medium (MEM(+)) supplemented with KL (0, 1, 10, 50, 100, or 200 ng/ml). Noncultured (control) and cultured fragments were processed for histology and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). RT-PCR demonstrated an increase in steady-state level of KL mRNA during the transition from primary to secondary follicles. Small antral follicles had higher steady-state levels of KL mRNA in granulosa and theca cells than large follicles. After 7 days, only 50 ng/ml of KL had maintained the percentage of normal follicles similar to control. After 1 day, all KL concentrations reduced the percentage of primordial follicles and increased the percentage of growing follicles. KL at 10, 50, 100, or 200 ng/ml increased primary follicles, compared to MEM(+) after 7 days. An increase in oocyte and follicular diameter was observed at 50 ng/ml of KL. TEM confirmed ultrastructural integrity of follicles after 7 days at 50 ng/ml of KL. In conclusion, the KL mRNAs were detected in all follicular categories. Furthermore, 50 ng/ml of KL maintained the integrity of caprine preantral follicle cultured for 7 days and stimulated primordial follicle activation and follicle growth.",M2
20013789,"Posthatching development of Alligator mississippiensis ovary and testis.We investigated ovary and testis development of Alligator mississippiensis during the first 5 months posthatch. To better describe <e>follicle</e> assembly and seminiferous cord development, we used histochemical techniques to detect carbohydrate-rich extracellular matrix components in 1-week, 1-month, 3-month, and 5-month-old gonads. We found profound morphological changes in both ovary and testis. During this time, oogenesis progressed up to diplotene arrest and meiotic germ cells increasingly interacted with follicular cells. Concomitant with follicles becoming invested with full complements of granulosa cells, a periodic acid Schiff's (PAS)-positive basement membrane formed. As follicles enlarged and thecal layers were observed, basement membranes and thecal compartments gained periodic acid-methionine silver (PAMS)-reactive fibers. The ovarian medulla increased first PAS- and then PAMS reactivity as it fragmented into wide lacunae lined with low cuboidal to squamous epithelia. During this same period, testicular germ cells found along the tubule margins were observed progressing from spermatogonia to round spermatids located within the center of tubules. Accompanying this meiotic development, interstitial Leydig cell clusters become more visible and testicular capsules thickened. During the observed testis development, the thickening tunica albuginea and widening interstitial tissues showed increasing PAS- and PAMS reactivity. We observed putative intersex structures in both ovary and testis. On the coelomic aspect of testes were cell clusters with germ cell morphology and at the posterior end of ovaries, we observed  medullary rests  resembling immature testis cords. We hypothesize laboratory conditions accelerated gonad maturation due to optimum conditions, including nutrients and temperature. Laboratory alligators grew more rapidly and with increased body conditions compared with previous measured, field-caught animals. Additionally, we predict the morphological maturation observed in these gonads is concomitant with increased endocrine activities.",M2
20009084,"Sustained activity of the EGF receptor is an absolute requisite for LH-induced oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion.Mammalian reproduction depends on the release of a mature oocyte from the ovarian <e>follicle</e>. Maturation of the oocyte and rupture of the follicle wall constitute part of the responses to the preovulatory surge of LH, which also include cumulus expansion and granulosa cell luteinization. It was previously shown that the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) mediates the ovulatory response to LH in the ovarian follicle. We hypothesized that it is a sustained activity of the EGFR that generates oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion. We demonstrated that, whereas a transient exposure of rat isolated, intact, preovulatory follicles to either LH or forskolin was sufficient to induce oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion, these LH-induced responses were only generated upon a prolonged activity of the EGFR. In addition, the continuous activity of the EGFR is essential for the chronic phosphorylation of the ERK1/2 downstream signaling molecules, which were shown to be essential for oocyte maturation and cumulus expansion. Interestingly, EGFR-sustained activity was also necessary to maintain the up-regulation of Ptgs2, a gene essential for cumulus expansion. The unusual prolonged duration of ERK1/2 activity may possibly be attributed to the late induction of the ERK-specific phosphatase 3, demonstrated herein. These new data shed light on the unique characteristics of EGFR-ERK1/2 activity in the ovarian follicle and emphasize the fact that the ovulatory process involves a nonclassical activation of this pathway.",M2
20004373,"A novel two-step strategy for in vitro culture of early-stage ovarian <e>follicles</e> in the mouse.OBJECTIVE: To develop an in vitro strategy to support the growth of early-stage follicles and produce mature oocytes competent for fertilization. DESIGN: Whole ovaries from 8-day-old mice were cultured for 4 days, and then secondary follicles were isolated and cultured for 12 days in a three-dimensional alginate or fibrin-alginate (FA) hydrogel matrix. SETTING: University-affiliated laboratory. ANIMALS: Mice. INTERVENTION(S): None. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Histologic evaluation of follicle development, steroid hormone production, and rates of oocyte maturation, oocyte fertilization, and embryo formation. RESULT(S): Culture of 8-day-old mouse ovaries for 4 days resulted in transition of the follicle population from primordial and primary follicles to secondary follicles, similar to that seen in a 12-day-old ovary. Isolated secondary follicles cultured for 12 days showed larger increases in oocyte diameter and more frequent antrum formation and theca cell differentiation in the FA-hydrogel matrix compared with the alginate matrix. Steroid hormone secretion patterns were consistent with the changes in follicle morphology and cell differentiation observed in the cultured follicles. Compared with oocytes from alginate follicle cultures, a greater number of oocytes retrieved from the FA-based follicle cultures progressed to metaphase I, reached metaphase II, and could be fertilized and cleaved to two-cell embryos. The organ culture plus FA-hydrogel follicle culture strategy produced a very high rate of oocyte progression to metaphase II (88 +/- 8.7% [mean +/- SEM]) and formation of two-cell embryos (54 +/- 4%). CONCLUSION(S): A strategy combining whole ovary culture of early-stage follicles and subsequent FA hydrogel in vitro follicle culture produced a high percentage of oocytes competent for fertilization; this might provide new options for fertility preservation in women and prepubertal girls facing fertility-threatening diseases or treatments.",M2
20003855,"Use of knowledge regarding LH receptors to improve superstimulatory treatments in cattle.Embryo transfer is a biotechnology that has been used worldwide to increase the production of offspring from female bovines. Treatments to induce multiple ovulations (superovulation) have evolved from superstimulatory protocols that depended upon detection of oestrus to treatments that synchronise <e>follicle</e> growth and ovulation, allowing for improved donor management and fixed-timed AI (FTAI). The protocols associated with FTAI facilitate animal handling and produce at least as many viably embryos as conventional treatment protocols that required detection of oestrus. Recent knowledge regarding LH receptors (LHR) and follicular development can be applied to improve embryo transfer protocols. In fact, improvements in the superstimulatory treatment called the 'P-36 protocol', which include hormones that stimulate LHR, indicate that adjustments related to LHR availability may increase bovine embryo yield compared with conventional protocols based on the detection of oestrus.",M2
20003852,"New approaches to superovulation and embryo transfer in small ruminants.The present paper reviews the current state of knowledge in multiple ovulation and embryo transfer (MOET) technology in small ruminants, focusing on recently reported information. Major new findings are related to follicular wave patterns in small ruminants, the elucidation of follicular dominance and the integration of this information into ovarian superstimulatory treatment protocols. Follicular dynamics determine steroid and gonadotrophin secretion, follicular responses to FSH, ovulatory responses and embryo yield. Protocols that control follicular dominance have been designed to allow the initiation of superstimulation at the beginning of a follicular wave. New approaches consist of (1) synchronisation of ovulation for superstimulation during Wave 1 (i.e. Day 0 protocol), (2) pretreatment with a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) antagonist from 10 days prior to FSH treatment to avoid follicular dominance and (3) progesterone-oestradiol cotreatment to synchronise <e>follicle</e> wave emergence. These protocols provide a homogeneous pool of small follicles that are gonadotrophin responsive, enhancing the superovulatory response and embryo yield with a reduction in the incidence of unovulated follicles and early regression of corpora lutea. In addition, the rate of fertilisation failure has been reduced by using an inducer of ovulation (i.e. GnRH) associated with intrauterine insemination. In summary, the application of recently acquired knowledge has resulted in relevant improvements in MOET programmes in small ruminants.",M2
20003840,"Coordinated regulation of <e>follicle</e> development by germ and somatic cells.The continuum of folliculogenesis begins in the fetal ovary with the differentiation of the oogonia and their isolation within the primordial follicles. Primordial follicle activation is an enigmatic process, whereby some follicles enter the growing pool to become primary follicles, thereby embarking on an irreversible progression towards ovulation or atresia. This process is under the coordinated regulation of factors from the oocyte itself, as well as from the somatic cells of the ovary, in particular the theca and granulosa cells, which are structural components of the follicle. These two influences provide the principal stimuli for the growth of the follicle to the late preantral or early antral stage of development. The endocrine effects of the gonadotrophins FSH and LH are essential to the continued progression of the follicle and most atresia can be attributed to the failure to receive or process the gonadotrophin signals. The peri-ovulatory state has received intensive investigation recently, demonstrating a coordinated role for gonadotrophins, steroids, epidermal growth factor family proteins and prostaglandins. Thus, a complex programme of coordinated interaction of governing elements from both germ and somatic cell sources is required for successful follicle development.",M2
19996554,"Formation of primordial <e>follicles</e> and immunolocalization of PTEN, PKB and FOXO3A proteins in the ovaries of fetal and neonatal pigs.The assembly of primordial follicles and subsequent development and transition of the primordial follicle to the primary follicle are critical processes in ovarian biology. In order to examine follicle formation and development in fetal and neonatal pigs, ovarian samples were obtained from a famous local breed of Chinese pigs, Erhualian pigs, ranging in age from 50 days postcoitum to 1 day postpartum in our current study. Morphological changes in the ovaries of the fetal and neonatal pigs indicated that egg nests were the earliest recognizable gamete cells. The proportion of egg nests decreased from 98.4 to 25.6% and the proportion of single follicles increased from 1.6 to 74.4% between 70 and 90 days postcoitum. The proportions of primordial follicles increased between 70 and 90 days postcoitum but decreased from 90 days postcoitum to 1 day postpartum. Our results suggested that the key stage of primordial follicle formation was between 70 and 90 days postcoitum and that the major stage of transition from primordial follicles into primary follicles was between 90 days postcoitum and 1 day postpartum. Experiments were also conducted to examine the localization of PTEN, PKB and FOXO3A proteins in the porcine ovaries by immunohistochemistry and immunoblotting. The results indicated that PTEN, PKB and FOXO3A were localized in the germ cells of egg nests, cytoplasm of oocytes and granulosa cells of follicles ranging from the primordial to secondary stages and that the staining intensity was weak in granulosa cells but strong in oocytes. The different staining patterns of PTEN, FOXO3A and PKB suggested that these proteins were expressed in a stage- and cell-specific manner during ovarian follicle formation and development in the fetal and neonatal pig.",M2
19966222,"Cyclin E-dependent protein kinase activity regulates niche retention of Drosophila ovarian <e>follicle</e> stem cells.Whether stem cells have unique cell cycle machineries and how they integrate with niche interactions remains largely unknown. We identified a hypomorphic cyclin E allele WX that strongly impairs the maintenance of follicle stem cells (FSCs) in the Drosophila ovary but does not reduce follicle cell proliferation or germline stem cell maintenance. CycE(WX) protein can still bind to the cyclin-dependent kinase catalytic subunit Cdk2, but forms complexes with reduced protein kinase activity measured in vitro. By creating additional CycE variants with different degrees of kinase dysfunction and expressing these and CycE(WX) at different levels, we found that higher CycE-Cdk2 kinase activity is required for FSC maintenance than to support follicle cell proliferation. Surprisingly, cycE(WX) FSCs were lost from their niches rather than arresting proliferation. Furthermore, FSC function was substantially restored by expressing either excess DE-cadherin or excess E2F1/DP, the transcription factor normally activated by CycE-Cdk2 phosphorylation of retinoblastoma proteins. These results suggest that FSC maintenance through niche adhesion is regulated by inputs that normally control S phase entry, possibly as a quality control mechanism to ensure adequate stem cell proliferation. We speculate that a positive connection between central regulators of the cell cycle and niche retention may be a common feature of highly proliferative stem cells.",M2
19962424,"WNT4 is expressed in human fetal and adult ovaries and its signaling contributes to ovarian cell survival.WNT4 plays an important role in female sexual development and ovarian function. WNT4-deficiency leads disturbed development of the internal genitalia in mouse and human, and to a dramatic reduction of mouse oocytes. However, the expression and role of WNT4 in human ovaries is yet unknown. The expression of WNT4 mRNA and protein was studied in human adult and fetal ovaries (gestational ages 12-41 weeks), and the role of WNT4 in oocyte apoptosis was investigated in WNT4-deficient mice. WNT4 mRNA and protein were present in human ovaries throughout fetal development and in different follicular stages in adult ovaries. Compared with wild-type mice, WNT4-deficient mice had a markedly enhanced rate of oocyte apoptosis, with the highest values at gestational ages of 14.5 and 16.5 days post-coitum. The current results support a view that WNT4 may have a role in oocyte selection and <e>follicle</e> formation and maturation in human ovaries.",M2
19948890,"Regulation of epithelial stem cell replacement and <e>follicle</e> formation in the Drosophila ovary.Though much has been learned about the process of ovarian follicle maturation through studies of oogenesis in both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, less is known about how follicles form initially. In Drosophila, two somatic follicle stem cells (FSCs) in each ovariole give rise to all polar cells, stalk cells, and main body cells needed to form each follicle. We show that one daughter from each FSC founds most follicles but that cell type specification is independent of cell lineage, in contrast to previous claims of an early polar/stalk lineage restriction. Instead, key intercellular signals begin early and guide cell behavior. An initial Notch signal from germ cells is required for FSC daughters to migrate across the ovariole and on occasion to replace the opposite stem cell. Both anterior and posterior polar cells arise in region 2b at a time when approximately 16 cells surround the cyst. Later, during budding, stalk cells and additional polar cells are specified in a process that frequently transfers posterior follicle cells onto the anterior surface of the next older follicle. These studies provide new insight into the mechanisms that underlie stem cell replacement and follicle formation during Drosophila oogenesis.",M2
19948068,"Role of Scrib and Dlg in anterior-posterior patterning of the follicular epithelium during Drosophila oogenesis.BACKGROUND: Proper patterning of the <e>follicle</e> cell epithelium over the egg chamber is essential for the Drosophila egg development. Differentiation of the epithelium into several distinct cell types along the anterior-posterior axis requires coordinated activities of multiple signaling pathways. Previously, we reported that lethal(2)giant larvae (lgl), a Drosophila tumor suppressor gene, is required in the follicle cells for the posterior follicle cell (PFC) fate induction at mid-oogenesis. Here we explore the role of another two tumor suppressor genes, scribble (scrib) and discs large (dlg), in the epithelial patterning. RESULTS: We found that removal of scrib or dlg function from the follicle cells at posterior terminal of the egg chamber causes a complete loss of the PFC fate. Aberrant specification and differentiation of the PFCs in the mosaic clones can be ascribed to defects in coordinated activation of the EGFR, JAK and Notch signaling pathways in the multilayered cells. Meanwhile, the clonal analysis revealed that loss-of-function mutations in scrib/dlg at the anterior domains result in a partially penetrant phenotype of defective induction of the stretched and centripetal cell fate, whereas specification of the border cell fate can still occur in the most anterior region of the mutant clones. Further, we showed that scrib genetically interacts with dlg in regulating posterior patterning of the epithelium. CONCLUSION: In this study we provide evidence that scrib and dlg function differentially in anterior and posterior patterning of the follicular epithelium at oogenesis. Further genetic analysis indicates that scrib and dlg act in a common pathway to regulate PFC fate induction. This study may open another window for elucidating role of scrib/dlg in controlling epithelial polarity and cell proliferation during development.",M2
19939592,"Equine chorionic gonadotropin improves the efficacy of a progestin-based fixed-time artificial insemination protocol in Nelore (Bos indicus) heifers.A total of 177 Nelore heifers were examined by ultrasonography to determine the presence or absence of a corpus luteum (CL) and received a 3mg norgestomet ear implant plus 2mg of estradiol benzoate i.m. On Day 8, implants were removed and 150 microg of d-cloprostenol i.m. was administered. At the time of norgestomet implant removal, heifers with or without CL at the time of initiating treatment were assigned equally and by replicate to be treated with 0IU (n=87) or 400IU (n=90) eCG i.m. All heifers received 1mg of EB i.m. on Day 9 and were submitted to fixed-time artificial insemination (FTAI) 30-34h later. The addition of eCG increased the diameter of the largest <e>follicle</e> (LF) at FTAI (10.6+/-0.2mm vs. 9.5+/-0.2mm; P=0.003; mean+/-SEM), the final growth rate of the LF (1.14+/-0.1mm/day vs. 0.64+/-0.1mm/day; P=0.0009), ovulation rate [94.4% (85/90) vs. 73.6% (64/87); P=0.0006], the diameter of the CL at Day 15 (15.5+/-0.3mm vs. 13.8+/-0.3mm; P=0.0002), serum concentrations of progesterone 5 days after FTAI (6.6+/-1.0 ng/ml vs. 3.6+/-0.7ng/ml; P=0.0009), and pregnancy per AI [P/AI; 50.0% (45/90) vs. 36.8% (32/87); P=0.04]. The absence of a CL at the beginning of the treatment negatively influenced the P/AI [30.2% (16/53) vs. 49.2% (61/124); P=0.01]. Therefore, the presence of a CL (and/or onset of puberty) must be considered in setting up FTAI programs in heifers. In addition, eCG may be an important tool for the enhancement of follicular growth, ovulation, size and function of the subsequent CL, and pregnancy rates in progestin-based FTAI protocols in Bos indicus heifers.",M2
19934014,"Control in time and space: Tramtrack69 cooperates with Notch and Ecdysone to repress ectopic fate and shape changes during Drosophila egg chamber maturation.Organ morphogenesis requires cooperation between cells, which determine their course of action based upon location within a tissue. Just as important, cells must synchronize their activities, which requires awareness of developmental time. To understand how cells coordinate behaviors in time and space, we analyzed Drosophila egg chamber development. We found that the transcription factor Tramtrack69 (TTK69) controls the fates and shapes of all columnar <e>follicle</e> cells by integrating temporal and spatial information, restricting characteristic changes in morphology and expression that occur at stage 10B to appropriate domains. TTK69 is required again later in oogenesis: it controls the volume of the dorsal-appendage (DA) tubes by promoting apical re-expansion and lateral shortening of DA-forming follicle cells. We show that TTK69 and Notch compete to repress each other's expression and that a local Ecdysone signal is required to shift the balance in favor of TTK69. We hypothesize that TTK69 then cooperates with spatially restricted co-factors to define appropriate responses to a globally available (but as yet unidentified) temporal signal that initiates the S10B transformations.",M2
19933430,"Effect of dietary crude protein source on hormone and <e>follicle</e> characteristics in beef heifers.Ground, raw soybeans (SB), or dried distillers grain plus solubles (DDGS) were utilized in heifer development diets to determine the effect of dietary fat and protein source on hormone and follicle characteristics and ADG. The experiment was conducted over 2 yr with 100 June-born heifers (199 +/- 2 kg initial BW, n = 50 per yr). The experimental periods were 157 and 207 d in yr 1 and 2, respectively. Heifers were provided a dietary supplement (DM basis) of 1.23 kg of SB and 0.40 kg of corn or 1.65 kg of DDGS between weaning and breeding. Estrus was synchronized with 2 injections of PGF(2alpha) 14 d apart. Dominant follicles were measured and aspirated via transvaginal ultrasonography 60 h after the second PGF(2alpha) injection. Heifers were exposed to bulls beginning 14 d after aspiration for 45 d. Heifer ADG was greater (P = 0.02) for DDGS heifers in yr 1, but was similar (P = 0.47) in yr 2. However, there was no difference (P = 0.35) in final BW in either year. There was no difference (P &gt;or= 0.67) in follicle size, follicle hormone concentrations, or pregnancy rate (88%) between yr 1 and 2. Serum estrogen at 48 or 60 h after PGF(2alpha) injection were similar (P &gt;or= 0.91); however, LH at 60 h in yr 2 tended to be greater (P = 0.07) for DDGS heifers. The percentage of heifers experiencing an LH surge 48 and 60 h after PGF(2alpha) injection was not affected (P &gt;/= 0.40) by treatment. Calf production was not affected (P &gt;or= 0.20) by developmental diet. In summary, DDGS and SB have similar effects on hormone and follicle characteristics at the inclusion rates used in these studies.",M2
19933312,"The differential transcriptome and ontology profiles of floating and cumulus granulosa cells in stimulated human antral <e>follicles</e>.Communication between various ovarian cell types is a prerequisite for folliculogenesis and ovulation. In antral follicles granulosa cells divide into two distinct populations of mural and cumulus granulosa cells (CGC), enveloping the antrum and surrounding the oocyte, respectively. Both cell types, with the mural compartment in excess, contribute to the floating granulosa cell (FGC) population in the follicular fluid. The aim of this study was to compare the transcriptomes of FGC and CGC in stimulated antral follicles obtained from 19 women undergoing IVF-ICSI procedure. FGC were obtained from follicular fluid during the follicle puncture procedure and CGC were acquired after oocyte denudation for micromanipulation. Gene expression analysis was conducted using the genome-wide Affymetrix transcriptome array. The expression profile of the two granulosa cell populations varied significantly. Out of 28 869 analysed transcripts 4480 were differentially expressed (q-value &lt; 10(-4)) and 489 showed &gt; or =2-fold difference in the expression level with 222 genes up-regulated in FGC and 267 in CGC. The transcriptome of FGC showed higher expression of genes involved in immune response, hematological system function and organismal injury, although CGC had genes involved in protein degradation and nervous system function up-regulated. Cell-to-cell signalling and interaction pathways were noted in both cell populations. Furthermore, numerous novel transcripts that have not been previously described in follicular physiology were identified. In conclusion, our results provide a solid basis for future studies in follicular biology that will help to identify molecular markers for oocyte and embryo viability in IVF.",M2
19933235,"Suppression of follicular rupture with meloxicam, a cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor: potential for emergency contraception.BACKGROUND: There is evidence that cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitors can prevent or delay follicular rupture. COX-2 inhibitors, such as meloxicam, may offer advantages over emergency contraception with levonorgestrel, such as extending the therapeutic window for up to 24 h. We assessed the effect of meloxicam administered in the late follicular phase upon ovulation in women. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This was a single center, double blind, crossover study designed to assess the effects in 27 eligible women (18-40 years old, surgically sterilized with regular menstrual cycles) of meloxicam, 15 or 30 mg/day, administered orally for five consecutive days during the late follicular phase, starting when the leading <e>follicle</e> reached 18 mm diameter. Volunteers underwent two treatment cycles separated by one resting cycle, with randomization to dose sequence. Main outcomes were follicular rupture; serum LH, progesterone and estradiol (E2) levels; and incidence of adverse events. RESULTS: Twenty-two volunteers completed the study. There were no differences between meloxicam doses in menstrual cycle length. Dysfunctional ovulation was observed in 11/22 (50%) cycles treated with 15 mg/day and 20/22 (90.9%) cycles with 30 mg/day (P = 0.0068). All women had normal luteal phase progesterone levels; mean maximal values +/- SEM were 42 +/- 4.1 and 46.8 +/- 2.6 nmol/l for 15 and 30 mg/day groups, respectively. There were no serious adverse events, and no changes in LH and E2 levels or in cycle length. CONCLUSIONS: Meloxicam 30 mg given for five consecutive days in the late follicular phase is safe, effective and may be an alternative form of emergency contraception.",M2
19932503,"The relationship between periovulatory endocrine and follicular activity on corpus luteum size, function, and subsequent embryo survival.The objectives of this study were to examine the relationships between periovulatory endocrine events, ovarian activity, and embryo survival after artificial insemination (AI) in cattle (Bos taurus). Eighty-four reproductively normal beef heifers were estrus synchronized using a prostaglandin-based regimen. Artificial insemination was performed between 5 and 21h after heat onset. Ultrasonic examination of ovarian structures began 12h after the onset of heat and continued every 6h until confirmed ovulation. Blood samples were collected for measurement of estradiol, progesterone, and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1). Pregnancy diagnosis was conducted on Days 30 and 100 after AI. Embryo survival was defined as the presence of an embryo with a detectable heartbeat in a clear amniotic sac at Day 30 postinsemination. There was no effect of the intervals from the onset of heat to AI or ovulation or from AI to ovulation on embryo survival (P&gt;0.10). There was a tendency (P=0.09) of an inverse relationship between preovulatory <e>follicle</e> size and embryo survival that was unrelated to concentrations of estradiol or IGF-1 during the periovulatory period (P&gt;0.05). There was evidence (P=0.08) of a positive association between embryo survival and concentrations of progesterone on Day 7; however, this relationship was independent (P&lt;0.05) of hormonal and follicular measurements during the periovulatory period. This study shows that heifers could be inseminated up to 31.5h before ovulation without compromising the probability of embryo survival. This study suggests that there is an optimum range of follicle size within which high embryo survival rates can be achieved.",M2
19923252,"IGF-1 receptors in Xenopus laevis ovarian <e>follicle</e> cells support the oocyte maturation response.Insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1)-stimulated amphibian oocyte maturation has been studied extensively by a number of laboratory groups, but in previous studies possible effects of IGF-1 on ovarian follicle cells had not been tested directly. In the study reported here, biochemical and immunofluorescent techniques were used to test Xenopus ovarian follicle cells for the presence of hormone-sensitive IGF-1 receptor. Anti-xIGF-1 receptor beta-subunit antibodies detected a 90- and 98-kDa protein doublet in manually dissected oocyte cortices (plasma membrane-vitelline envelope complexes) by protein immunoblotting both before and after removal of follicle cells from oocytes by sandpaper rolling. The 90-kDa IGF-1 receptor beta-subunit was also detected in follicle cell pellets. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the receptor beta-subunits was increased by treatment of cortices with 10 nM IGF-1 both in the presence and absence of associated follicle cells, was reduced by removal of follicle cells, and was detected in follicle cell pellets. Treatment of follicle cell pellets with nanomolar concentrations of IGF-1 stimulated receptor tyrosine phosphorylation in a dose-dependent fashion that correlated with dose-dependent stimulation of oocyte maturation. IGF-1 receptor was also detected in cultured follicle cells by immunofluorescence. Removal of follicle cells significantly reduced the IGF-1-stimulated oocyte maturation response. These results offer the first direct evidence for hormone-responsive IGF-1 receptors in Xenopus laevis ovarian follicle cells and demonstrate that follicle cells somehow support IGF-1-stimulated oocyte maturation.",M2
19920068,"Insulin resistance and free androgen index correlate with the outcome of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation in non-PCOS women undergoing IVF.BACKGROUND: The dual effects of insulin and androgen on the ovary act to promote early folliculogenesis. In the context of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), the presence of hyperinsulinaemia, resulting from increased insulin resistance (IR), and hyperandrogenaemia lead to the appearance of multiple antral <e>follicles</e> and frequently a multi-follicular response to gonadotrophin stimulation for assisted reproductive treatments (ARTs). The effect of IR and androgen status in women without PCOS on the follicular outcome of controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) is not known. METHODS: We assessed the IR [using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA)] and androgen status of 49 women without PCOS undergoing an ART cycle. This was then related to the treatment cycle outcome. RESULTS: We found a significant positive correlation between HOMA and BMI, and free androgen index (FAI) and testosterone. The FAI significantly positively correlated with total follicle count after COH. The total follicle count was significantly higher in those with a HOMA &gt;2.5, and HOMA positively correlated with total follicle count in this group of IR women (HOMA &gt; 2.5). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest a positive correlation of HOMA-IR levels above a threshold level of 2.5 and a continuous positive correlation of free androgen (FAI) to total ovarian follicle count following COH in the non-PCOS patient.",M2
19920066,"A reduced size of the ovarian <e>follicle</e> pool is associated with an increased risk of a trisomic pregnancy in IVF-treated women.BACKGROUND: The increased risk of a trisomic pregnancy with a woman's age arises from an increased rate of meiotic non-disjunction in the oocytes. It has been hypothesized that the increase in meiotic errors is related to the decreasing number of oocytes with age. Our aim was to assess the relation between trisomic pregnancy and three parameters of oocyte quantity. METHODS: In a Dutch nationwide database on in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment from 1983 to 1995, we identified 28 women with a trisomic pregnancy conceived via or within 1 year from IVF treatment. We selected five age-matched controls with a healthy child for each trisomy case. We performed a case-control study to examine whether trisomy cases more often had a history of ovarian surgery and a lower response to ovarian hyperstimulation than controls. Subsequently, cases and controls were followed to compare the incidence of signs of menopause at the end of the study period as self-reported by questionnaire. RESULTS: Logistic regression analysis showed an association between trisomic pregnancy and a history of ovarian surgery [odds ratio (OR) 3.3; 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.0-10.5; P = 0.04] and between trisomic pregnancy and retrieval of &lt; or = 4 oocytes during IVF treatment (OR 4.0; 95% CI: 1.4-11.5; P = 0.01). The adjusted OR for signs of menopause associated with trisomic pregnancy was 5.7 (95% CI: 1.1-29.9; P = 0.04). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that IVF-treated women with a reduced ovarian follicle pool are at increased risk of a trisomic pregnancy, independent of their age. Our findings support the hypothesis that follicle pool size and not chronological age determines a woman's trisomy risk. Since a questionnaire was used, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of selection bias in this study.",M2

The pre-ovulatory estradiol peak occurred 2 days before the pre-ovulatory luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, while the follicle stimulating hormone surge started concomitantly with the LH surge in both cloned dogs. Serum progesterone levels increased during proestrus and estrus and its concentration on the day of the LH surge was 3.59 and 2.71 ng/ml in Clones A and B, respectively. Gradual follicular growth was observed by ultrasonography during proestrus. Although the numbers are limited, these cloned female dogs showed normal ranges of reproductive hormone levels and follicular changes during proestrous and early estrous stages of the cycle.",M2
19913632,"Sex- and tissue-specific expression of P450 aromatase (cyp19a1a) in the yellowtail clownfish, Amphiprion clarkii.To investigate the role of estrogen in the gonad of yellowtail clownfish Amphiprion clarkii, we isolated cDNA encoding cytochrome P450 aromatase (Cyp19a1a) from the adult ovary. The full-length cDNA of clownfish cyp19a1a is 1928-bp long and encodes 520 amino acids. Real-time quantitative RT-PCR analysis showed that cyp19a1a was expressed mainly in the ovary of female-phase fish. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemical observations showed that positive signals were restricted to the ovarian <e>follicle</e> of the female-phase fish. In contrast, Cyp19a1a signal was not detected in the ambisexual gonad of the male-phase fish. These findings suggest that Cyp19a1a is involved in oogenesis in the female-phase fish, but not in the ambisexual gonad of male-phase fish.",M2
19913288,"Xenotransplantation in immunodeficient mice to study ovarian follicular development in domestic animals.Nowadays, in vitro study of follicular dynamics of primordial and primary follicular stages is limited because in vitro culture systems for these <e>follicles</e> are lacking, both in domestic animal species and in human. Therefore, additional insights might be generated by grafting ovarian tissue into immunodeficient mice to study activation and maturation of early follicular stages. A considerable amount of data has already been gathered in laboratory animals and through clinical application of human assisted reproduction technologies where live births were reported recently after the use of (cryopreserved) ovarian grafts. However, given that human preantral follicles are difficult to obtain and that there are many similarities between the bovine and human species with regard to ovarian physiology, the bovine model offers exciting additional prospects and is therefore discussed in more detail. This review will focus on recent developments related to preantral follicle and (repeated) ovarian tissue retrieval and xenotransplantation of (bovine) ovarian tissue strips to immunodeficient mice as a model to study preantral follicular dynamics. Different grafting strategies will be discussed as well as the consequences of this procedure on the viability and dynamic behavior of the grafted tissue and follicles.",M2

19908149,"Differential distribution of cAMP-dependent protein kinase isoforms in the mantle of the bivalve mollusc Mytilus galloprovincialis.Two different isoforms of the regulatory (R) subunit of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA), named R(myt1) and R(myt2), had previously been identified in the sea mussel Mytilus galloprovincialis. R(myt1) and R(myt2) were differentially distributed in the various cell types comprising the mussel mantle. R(myt1) was found the only isoform to be present in the auxiliary cells of female <e>follicles</e> and the cubic epithelium of the middle fold of mantle edge. In contrast, only the R(myt2) isoform was detected in the subepithelial connective tissue, the endothelium of haemolymph vessels, the adipogranular and vesicular cells of reserve connective tissue, and the spermatozoa. Finally, both R(myt1) and R(myt2) coexist in some cell types but they show a different cellular localization: R(myt1) was localized in the cytoplasm whereas R(myt2) was mainly detected in the cell apical edge, cell periphery, cilia and sperm flagella. Interestingly, both R(myt1) and R(myt2) were absent in oocytes within the female gonadal follicles but, in contrast, they were highly expressed in follicle-released oocytes collected after spawning. Taken together the results show that mussel PKA isoforms are differentially distributed in the mantle cell types, which suggests that they are involved in the regulation of distinct cellular functions. On the other hand, the expression of R(myt1) and R(myt2) proteins is associated with the meiosis resumption of oocytes at the prophase I stage, which occurs in parallel to spawning.",M2
19906848,"The cadherin Fat2 is required for planar cell polarity in the Drosophila ovary.Planar cell polarity is an important characteristic of many epithelia. In the Drosophila wing, eye and abdomen, establishment of planar cell polarity requires the core planar cell polarity genes and two cadherins, Fat and Dachsous. Drosophila Fat2 is a cadherin related to Fat; however, its role during planar cell polarity has not been studied. Here, we have generated mutations in fat2 and show that Fat2 is required for the planar polarity of actin filament orientation at the basal side of ovarian <e>follicle</e> cells. Defects in actin filament orientation correlate with a failure of egg chambers to elongate during oogenesis. Using a functional fosmid-based fat2-GFP transgene, we show that the distribution of Fat2 protein in follicle cells is planar polarized and that Fat2 localizes where basal actin filaments terminate. Mosaic analysis demonstrates that Fat2 acts non-autonomously in follicle cells, indicating that Fat2 is required for the transmission of polarity information. Our results suggest a principal role for Fat-like cadherins during the establishment of planar cell polarity.",M2
19906004,"Ovarian transplantation for fertility preservation in a sheep model: can <e>follicle</e> loss be prevented by antiapoptotic sphingosine-1-phosphate administration?AIMS: The aim of this study was to investigate whether sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P), an apoptosis-inhibitor would be able to protect ovarian follicles from hypoxia-induced cell death in ovarian transplantation. METHODS: In four sheep, both ovaries were removed and immediately transplanted back into the abdominal wall. In two of them, one ovary was treated with S1P locally by injection and incubation after dissecting the ovarian cortex. The contra lateral ovary of both sheep and both ovaries of the remaining sheep served as controls. After 2 weeks, all grafts were evaluated histologically. RESULTS: Although the mean number of apoptotic cells were increased after grafting compared with fresh tissue, we were not able to demonstrate a significant difference regarding the follicular density in tissue with S1P treatment (mean number of follicles per field of view: 0.21 vs. 0.23, p = 0.909). CONCLUSION: Apoptosis seems to play a role in follicular loss during ovarian transplantation; however, local application of S1P does not prevent primordial/primary follicles from hypoxia-induced cell death in cortical grafts in our study.",M2
19904600,"Vitrification of bovine oocytes: implications of follicular size and sire on the rates of embryonic development.PURPOSE: The objectives were to test how the source of oocytes and semen impacted vitrification of large numbers of bovine oocytes and subsequent IVF and early embryo development to test procedures that may assist with assisted reproductive technologies in humans. METHODS: Bovine oocytes were vitrified from <e>follicles</e> of different diameters, small (&lt; or =4 mm) and medium (4 to 10 mm), using nylon mesh. Oocytes were exposed to the cryoprotectant composed of 40% (v/v) ethylene glycol, 18% (w/v) Ficoll-70, and 0.3 M sucrose in three stepwise dilutions. Thawing was conducted with a series of 0.5, 0.25 and 0.125 M sucrose dilutions in 20% fetal bovine serum. RESULTS: The cleavage (39.1% vs. 58.5%) and blastocyst rates (5.1% vs. 22.9%) were significantly lower for the vitrified oocytes. Follicle size had a significant impact on the development of embryos. Sires had significant effects on embryonic developmental rates. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude that differences in development exist due to follicle source and sire used for IVF after vitrification.",M2
19903031,"Involvement of HSP10 during the ovarian follicular development of polycystic ovary syndrome: Study in both human ovaries and cultured mouse <e>follicles</e>.OBJECTIVE: To study the possible roles of HSP10 in the follicular development. METHODS: In this study, we examined the expression of HSP10 during the follicular development in human ovaries and cultured mouse follicles as well as its functional relevance with PCOS. Ovary tissues from normal adults (n = 3) were obtained with consents. Mouse early antral follicles (diameter: 220-250 mum) were cultured for 3 days in vitro. Western Blot and immunohistochemistry were used to determine the HSP10 expression and localisation during follicular development in vivo and in vitro. RESULTS: HSP10 protein was detected only in oocytes from human preantral follicles, whereas in antral follicles, it was localised in oocytes, granulosa cells, theca cells and stroma cells. Furthermore, in cultured mouse antral follicles, a similar trend of HSP10 expression during follicle development was observed. CONCLUSION: HSP10 expression was increased as larger area and higher level of density during follicular development both in human and mouse follicles cultured in vitro. Our previous studies showed that HSP10 was highly expressed in normal ovaries compared with those from PCOS. The mouse early antral follicle culture approach may help to understand the role of HSP10 in pathophysiological development of PCOS.",M2
19900988,"Involvement of the SLIT/ROBO pathway in <e>follicle</e> development in the fetal ovary.In humans and domestic mammals, pivotal processes in ovary development, including primordial follicle assembly, occur prenatally. These events are essential for determining fertility in adult life; however, they remain poorly understood at the mechanistic level. In mammals, the SLITs (SLIT1, SLIT2 and SLIT3) and their ROBO (ROBO1, ROBO2, ROBO3/RIG-1 and ROBO4/MAGIC ROBO) receptors regulate neural, leukocyte, vascular smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell migration. In addition, the SLIT/ROBO pathway has functional roles in embryonic development and in the adult ovary by inhibiting cell migration and promoting apoptosis. We therefore characterised follicle formation and investigated the expression and localisation of the ROBO/SLIT pathway in the ovine fetal ovary. Using RT-PCR, we identified SLIT2, SLIT3, ROBO1, ROBO2 and ROBO4 in sheep ovaries harvested across gestation. The real-time quantitative PCR results implied that ROBO2 expression and ROBO4 expression were elevated during the early stages of follicle formation and stayed abundant during primordial follicle maturation (P&lt;0.05). Immunohistochemistry examination demonstrated that ROBO1 was localised to the pre-granulosa cells, while ROBO2, ROBO4 and SLIT2 were expressed in the oocytes of the developing primordial follicle. This indicates that in the fetal ovary, SLIT-ROBO signalling may require an autocrine and paracrine interaction. Furthermore, at the time of increased SLIT-ROBO expression, there was a significant reduction in the number of proliferating oocytes in the developing ovary (P&lt;0.0001). Overall, these results suggest, for the first time, that the SLIT-ROBO pathway is expressed at the time of follicle formation during fetal ovary development.",M2
19897528,"Assessment of theca cell function prior to controlled ovarian stimulation: the predictive value of serum basal/stimulated steroid levels.BACKGROUND: Serum androgen levels correlate with ovarian sensitivity to <e>follicle</e>-stimulating hormone (FSH) but in practice, standard baseline serum testosterone (T) levels prior to in-vitro fertilization (IVF) may not be the most appropriate marker for determination. METHODS: Infertile women enrolled in an IVF programme were included in this study. Serum T and Delta4-androstenedione (A), and the androgen precursor 17-hydroxyprogesterone (17-OHP) were measured before and 24 h after a gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist stimulation test (GAST). An early follicular phase antral follicle count (AFC) was also performed. Patients were subsequently enrolled in a long gonadotrophin-releasing hormone agonist protocol with a standard FSH dose (150 IU) for 7 days to assess the association between androgen levels and ovarian responsiveness to FSH. RESULTS: The GAST elicited a significant increase in serum androgen levels that was well correlated with AFC. 17-OHP showed the greatest response to GAST and strongest correlation with AFC. The 17-OHP response to GAST differentiated patients with high ovarian reserve (OR) from those with low or normal OR as assessed by AFC, whereas only the estradiol response could differentiate those with low AFC. GAST-stimulated serum levels of 17-OHP were also correlated with ovarian response to FSH. Using receiver operating characteristic curve analysis, stimulated 17-OHP levels were predictive of the ovarian response to controlled ovarian stimulation, with similar power to that observed with AFC but lower power than with anti-Müllerian hormone. CONCLUSIONS: Serum androgen levels following GAST are correlated with AFC and ovarian response to FSH. Serum T is a less sensitive marker of theca cell function than 17-OHP.",M2
19897233,"Effects of a shortened preovulatory follicular phase on genital blood flow and endometrial hormone receptor concentrations in Holstein-Friesian cows.The goal of this study was to determine the effects of the length of the preovulatory phase on genital blood flow and mRNA expression of endometrial hormone receptors in cattle (Bos Taurus). Ovulation was synchronized in 50 Holstein-Friesian cows using a modified Ovsynch (ovulation synchronization) protocol, in which the second gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) administration was given 40h (G40, n=17) or 60h (G60, n=16) after the prostaglandin F(2alpha) (PGF(2alpha)) administration. The third group (S, n=17) did not receive a second GnRH administration. Transrectal color Doppler examinations were carried out 24h before (Day -1) and on Day 7 after ovulation (Day 0). Follicular size (FS) and luteal size (CLS) were quantified by measuring the areas of these structures on cross-sectional B-mode ultrasound images. Follicular blood flow (FB) and luteal blood flow (CLB) were quantified by determining the colored areas of these structures. Uterine blood flow was measured using the time-averaged maximum velocities (TAMVs) and the pulsatility indices (PIs) of both uterine arteries. Endometrial mRNA transcript abundance of estrogen receptors alpha and beta as well as oxytocin and progesterone receptor were determined on Days -1 and 7 in G40 and G60 cows. In all cows, plasma progesterone (P(4)) values were measured on Day 7. On Day -1, FS and FB values were lower (P &lt; or = 0.05) in G40 cows compared with those in S cows but did not differ (P&gt;0.05) between G60 cows on the one hand and G40 cows and S cows, respectively, on the other hand. On Day 7, CLS and P(4) did not differ (P&gt;0.05) between cows of Groups G40, G60, and S; CLB was lower (P&lt; or =0.05) in G40 cows than in G60 and S cows, but no difference (P&gt;0.05) occurred between G60 and S cows. The uterine TAMV and PI values did not differ among the three groups (P&gt;0.05). Gene expression of hormone receptors did not differ (P&gt;0.05) between Groups G40 and G60 on Days -1 and 7. Results of this study indicate that a shortened preovulatory <e>follicle</e> phase primarily affects ovarian but not the measured uterine events in cows undergoing synchronization of ovulation.",M2
19890641,"Patterns of ovarian morphology in polycystic ovary syndrome: a study utilising magnetic resonance imaging.OBJECTIVE: To evaluate and compare MRI-based ovarian morphology in groups of women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and controls. METHODS: All PCOS cases (n = 44) had oligo-amenorrhoea and hyperandrogenism irrespective of ovarian morphology, and fulfilled NIH/Rotterdam diagnostic criteria for PCOS. All control women (n = 40) had normal menses and normoandrogenaemia. All subjects were of white British/Irish origin and pre-menopausal. Group comparisons were based on independent-sample t tests. Polycystic ovarian morphology was defined by at least 12 <e>follicles</e> 2-9 mm in diameter and/or an ovarian volume greater than 10 cm(3). RESULTS: Ovarian morphology differed significantly in PCOS cases and controls (follicle number geometric mean [SD range] 18.6 [9.9, 35.0] vs 6.6 [3.1, 14.2], unadjusted P = 1.3 x 10(-16); calculated ovarian volume 8.8 cm(3) [5.0, 15.5] vs 5.1 cm(3) [2.5, 10.3], unadjusted P = 3.0 x 10(-7); peripheral follicle location in 55% vs 18% of ovaries, P = 7.9 x 10(-6); visible central ovarian stroma in 61% vs 24% of ovaries, P = 2.3 x 10(-5)). Follicle number and calculated ovarian volume were not concordant with clinical/biochemical assignment of PCOS/control status in 36 (23%) and 52 (34%) of ovaries, respectively. CONCLUSION: Ovarian morphology overlaps in PCOS cases and controls, emphasising the importance of considering clinical/biochemical presentation together with imaging ovarian morphology in the diagnosis of PCOS.",M2
19886036,"Impact of pituitary FSH purification on in vitro early folliculogenesis in goats.Porcine pituitary <e>follicle</e> stimulating hormone (pFSH) is known to regulate the production of growth factors that have an essential role in early foliculogenesis. However, the effects of different preparations of pFSH on the survival and development of caprine follicles are not yet known. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of different pFSH (Stimufol and Folltropin) on the in vitro survival and growth of caprine preantral follicles. Pieces of caprine ovarian tissues were cultured for either one or seven days in a supplemented Minimum Essential Medium, alone or containing either Stimufol (50 ng/mL) or Folltropin (10, 50, 100 and 1000 ng/mL). Fresh control ovarian tissues as well as cultured tissued were processed for histological and ultrastructural studies. The results showed that after seven days, only Stimufol maintained follicular morphology similar to control. Moreover, follicular degeneration was higher in medium alone or with Folltropin at 50, 100 and 1000 ng/mL. However, at day seven, the percentage of growing follicles was higher in 100 ng/mL of Folltropin than Stimufol. In conclusion, FSH preparations affect differently the performance of in vitro culture of caprine preantral follicles. Stimufol was better to preserve follicular morphology while Folltropin was more efficient to promote follicular growth.",M2
19875303,"WNT signaling in ovarian <e>follicle</e> biology and tumorigenesis.The WNTS are an expansive family of glycoprotein signaling molecules known mostly for the roles they play in embryonic development. WNT signaling first caught the attention of ovarian biologists when it was reported that the inactivation of Wnt4 in mice results in partial female-to-male sex reversal and oocyte depletion. More recently, studies using loss- and gain-of-function transgenic mouse models demonstrated the requirement for Wnt4, Fzd4 and Ctnnb1, components of the WNT pathway, for normal folliculogenesis, luteogenesis and steroidogenesis, and showed that dysregulated WNT signaling can cause granulosa cell tumor development. This review covers our current knowledge of WNT signaling in ovarian follicles, highlighting both the great promise and the many unresolved questions of this emerging field of research.",M2
19874886,"Whole-body or isolated ovary (60)Co irradiation: effects on in vivo and in vitro folliculogenesis and oocyte maturation.For the first time, the effects of low doses of gamma-radiation were studied on folliculogenesis and on isolated oocytes. After irradiation of adult mice, even at the lowest dose, a drastic loss of primordial <e>follicles</e> was observed in serial sections of ovaries, with, in opposite, no effect on the other follicle stages. Moreover, oocytes freshly recovered from the largest antral follicles of irradiated adult ovaries exhibited significantly less regular Ca(2+) oscillations than controls. Finally, in vitro folliculogenesis demonstrated a smaller diameter of preantral follicles recovered from irradiated juvenile ovaries compared to control, and an increase in follicle atresia. Further on, PLC-beta1 localization was not affected in the enclosed oocytes whereas chromatin configuration revealed that a quarter of them had prematurely resumed meiosis or was fragmented. These results raise the question of the risk of genetic and teratogenic effects on women submitted to chronic exposure even of very low radiation.",M2
19874833,"Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate inhibit growth and reduce estradiol levels of antral <e>follicles</e> in vitro.Any insult that affects survival of ovarian antral follicles can cause abnormal estradiol production and fertility problems. Phthalate esters (PEs) are plasticizers used in a wide range of consumer and industrial products. Exposure to these chemicals has been linked to reduced fertility in humans and animal models. Di-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) and mono-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP) decrease serum estradiol levels and aromatase (Arom) expression, prolong estrous cycles, and cause anovulation in animal and culture models. These observations suggest PEs directly target antral follicles. We therefore tested the hypothesis that DEHP (1-100 microg/ml) and MEHP (0.1-10 microg/ml) directly inhibit antral follicular growth and estradiol production. Antral follicles from adult mice were cultured with DEHP or MEHP, and/or estradiol for 96 h. During culture, follicle size was measured every 24 h as a measurement of follicle growth. After culture, media were collected for measurement of estradiol levels and follicles were subjected to measurement of cylin-D-2 (Ccnd2), cyclin-dependent-kinase-4 (Cdk4), and Arom. We found that DEHP and MEHP inhibited growth of follicles and decreased estradiol production compared to controls at the highest doses. DEHP and MEHP also decreased mRNA expression of Ccnd2, Cdk4, and Arom at the highest dose. Addition of estradiol to the culture medium prevented the follicles from DEHP- and MEHP-induced inhibition of growth, reduction in estradiol levels, and decreased Ccnd2 and Cdk4 expression. Collectively, our results indicate that DEHP and MEHP may directly inhibit antral follicle growth via a mechanism that partially includes reduction in levels of estradiol production and decreased expression of cell cycle regulators.",M2
19860353,"The effect of cetrorelix vs. ganirelix on pregnancy outcome using minimal gonadotropin stimulation in women with elevated day 3 serum <e>follicle</e> stimulating hormone levels.PURPOSE: To determine if the choice of gonadotropin releasing hormone antagonist influences subsequent pregnancy rates in women with diminished egg reserve. METHOD: Retrospective determination of pregnancy rates following embryo transfer in women with day 3 FSH &gt;12 mIU/ml using lower dose gonadotropin stimulation regimen. RESULTS: Though no significant differences were found there was a trend for lower pregnancy rates with ganirelix vs cetrorelix. CONCLUSIONS: The trend for lower pregnancy rates with ganirelix vs. cetrorelix seen in women with diminished egg reserve is consistent with the findings of a study performed in women with normal egg reserve using a normal gonadotropin stimulation regimen. It is not clear if the adverse effect is on the endometrium or the embryo.",M2
19857904,"Gene expression profile during ovarian folliculogenesis.Assisted reproductive technologies have progressed significantly and have provided successful treatment for many infertile couples. However, more advanced technologies are required for severe infertility such as premature ovarian failure and ovarian impairment due to adjuvant therapy for cancer. Ovarian tissue cryopreservation followed by in vitro growth of isolated <e>follicles</e> is a feasible proposition for such patients. Close coordination of communication among follicle cells including oocytes, granulosa and theca cells is required for follicle growth. Crucial factors may regulate the gonadotropin-independent and -dependent follicle growth stages. To facilitate development of a culture system for early growing follicles, DNA microarray analysis of mouse ovaries recovered at 7, 10, 13, 16 and 19 days of age was performed to identify factors required for the growth of early-stage follicles. These studies showed strong intensity of zona pellucida glycoproteins, bone morphogenic protein-15 (BMP-15) and growth differentiation factor (GDF-9) in 7 days old mice, which gradually declined in 19 days old mice. KIT, KIT ligand, anti-müllerian hormone (AMH) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), known as granulosa cell secreted factors, also showed relatively high expression. These studies will facilitate our understanding of the regulatory factors involved in folliculogenesis and thereby enable establishment of in vitro culture system for ovarian follicles.",M2

This paper focuses on effects of lactation length, Intermittent Suckling and Split Weaning on <e>follicle</e> development and subsequent oestrus. It is concluded that a lactation length of less than 3 weeks still leads to suboptimal reproductive performance in our modern sows. Further, both Intermittent Suckling and Split Weaning stimulate lactational follicle development and oestrus, but the variation in response between sows still limits practical application.",M2
19874233,"Reactive oxygen species (ROS): involvement in bovine follicular cysts etiopathogenesis.Ovulation is compared to an acute inflammatory process during which vasoactive agents, prostanoids, leukotrienes and Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) develop. The aim of this study was to evaluate the levels of ROS in cystic and follicular fluid, in order to establish their involvement in the etiopathogenesis of Cystic Ovarian <e>Follicle</e> (COF) in dairy cows. The study was conducted in 30 healthy cows (group C) and 30 cows affected by COF (group COF). The fluid of follicular cysts and of preovulatory follicles was drawn by means of ultrasound guided aspiration from the cows of both groups. The fluid obtained was analyzed by a photometric analytical system to detect ROS level. ROS concentration was statistically lower in the cystic fluid than in the follicular one (62.4 +/- 13.36 U.Carr vs. 84.89 +/- 26.99 U.Carr) (p&lt;0.05), thus suggesting that an alteration of the cascade responsible for ROS production may be implicated in the complex etipathogenesis of COF.",M2
19864088,"Functional relationships among intrafollicular insulin-like growth factor 1, circulatory gonadotropins, and development of the dominant <e>follicle</e> in mares.The functional relationships among intrafollicular free insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), circulatory gonadotropins, and development of the dominant follicle were studied in 40 mares in two experiments. A GnRH antagonist (Acyline) was given i.m. at the expected beginning of follicular deviation (largest follicle or F1&gt; or =20mm; Day 0) alone (Acyline group) or in combination with intrafollicular treatment of F1 with rhIGF1 (Acyline/IGF1 group). In Experiment 1, blood samples, follicular-fluid samples, and diameter of F1 were taken on Days 1 and 2. In Experiment 2, daily follicular diameter and blood samples were taken from Day 0 to ovulation. The GnRH antagonist induced a 50% decrease in circulatory FSH concentrations for 1 d and in LH for 2 d. In Experiment 1, control and Acyline/IGF1 groups had greater intrafollicular free IGF1 (P&lt;0.05) and inhibin-A concentrations (P&lt;0.08) than the Acyline group. The intrafollicular concentration of estradiol on Day 2 was greater (P&lt;0.05) in the control group than in the Acyline and the Acyline/IGF1 groups. In Experiment 2, a decrease in diameter of F1 in the Acyline group was followed by a new follicular wave. All IGF-treated follicles grew and ovulated. Results indicated that the increase in intrafollicular free IGF1 observed in F1 in association with deviation is gonadotropin dependent. During the period of lesser gonadotropin concentrations from Acyline treatment, intrafollicular IGF1 stimulated follicular growth and inhibin concentrations, but not intrafollicular estradiol production.",M2
