20367417,"Teriparatide improves early <e>callus</e> formation in distal radial fractures.BACKGROUND: Teriparatide (parathyreoid hormone; PTH 1-34) increases skeletal mass in humans and improves fracture healing in animals. A recent randomized multicenter trial of nonoperated distal radial fractures showed a moderate shortening of the time to restoration of cortical continuity by treatment with 20 microg (low-dose) teriparatide per day, but not with 40 microg (high-dose). As radiographic cortical continuity appears late in the healing process, perhaps too late for clinical relevance, we studied the qualitative appearance of the callus 5 weeks after fracture. METHODS: One third of the patients of the international trial were treated at Link√∂ping University Hospital. The multicenter trial did not evaluate early callus formation. We therefore made a blinded qualitative scoring of the callus at 5 weeks in our 27 patients. Callus formation was arbitrarily classified as rich, intermediate, or poor. RESULTS: 9 patients were classified as rich (none had received placebo, 3 low-dose teriparatide, and 6 high-dose teriparatide). 9 patients were classified as intermediate (1 had received placebo, 5 low-dose, and 3 high-dose). 9 patients were classified as poor (7 had received placebo, 1 low-dose, and 1 high-dose) (p &lt; 0.001). INTERPRETATION: This is a post hoc subgroup analysis of an outcome variable, which was not in the official protocol. The results must therefore be interpreted with caution. However, in combination with the results of the larger trial, the data suggest that radiographic quality at an early time point might be a sensitive variable, perhaps better than time to cortical continuity. Moreover, teriparatide appeared to improve early callus formation in distal radial fractures.",M1
20358338,"Effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound on fracture <e>callus</e> mineral density and flexural strength in rabbit tibial fresh fracture.BACKGROUND: Low-intensity ultrasound is a biophysical intervention on a fracture repair process. However, the effect of low-intensity ultrasound therapy on fracture healing is controversial. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of low-intensity pulsed ultrasound (LIPUS) therapy on the fracture healing process, including mineral density and strength of callus using a rabbit model. METHODS: A total of 30 rabbits underwent unilateral, transverse, and mid-tibia open osteotomies that were stabilized with external fixators. Then, the animals were divided into two study groups composed of 15 rabbits each: the case group (US), which were exposed to low-intensity pulsed ultrasound with 30 mW/cm(2) intensity and 1.5 MHz sine waves; and the control group (C), which underwent sham ultrasound treatment. Callus development and mineral density were evaluated using multidetector computed tomography at 2, 5, and 8 weeks, after which the animals were killed. Three-point bending tests of both healed and intact bones were assessed and compared. RESULTS: The results demonstrated that the callus mineral density in the US group was higher than in the C group (1202.20 +/- 81.30 vs. 940.66 +/- 151.58 HU; P = 0.001) at the end of the 8th week. The mean recorded three-point bending test score of healed bones in the US group was not significantly different from that of the C group (359.35 +/- 173.39 vs. 311.02 +/- 80.58 N; P = 0.114). CONCLUSIONS: The present study showed that low-intensity pulsed ultrasound enhanced callus mineral density with an insignificant increase in the strength of the fractured bone.",M1
20182251,"Locked plating of distal femur fractures leads to inconsistent and asymmetric <e>callus</e> formation.OBJECTIVES: Locked plating constructs may be too stiff to reliably promote secondary bone healing. This study used a novel imaging technique to quantify periosteal callus formation of distal femur fractures stabilized with locking plates. It investigated the effects of cortex-to-plate distance, bridging span, and implant material on periosteal callus formation. DESIGN: Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: One Level I and one Level II trauma center. PATIENTS: Sixty-four consecutive patients with distal femur fractures (AO types 32A, 33A-C) stabilized with periarticular locking plates. INTERVENTION: Osteosynthesis using indirect reduction and bridge plating with periarticular locking plates. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENT: Periosteal callus size on lateral and anteroposterior radiographs. RESULTS: Callus size varied from 0 to 650 mm2. Deficient callus (20 mm2 or less) formed in 52%, 47%, and 37% of fractures at 6, 12, and 24 weeks postsurgery, respectively. Callus formation was asymmetric, whereby the medial cortex had on average 64% more callus (P=0.001) than the anterior or posterior cortices. A longer bridge span correlated minimally with an increased callus size at Week 6 (P=0.02), but no correlation was found at Weeks 12 and 24 postsurgery. Compared with stainless steel plates, titanium plates had 76%, 71%, and 56% more callus at Week 6 (P=0.04), Week 12 (P=0.03), and Week 24 (P=0.09), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Stabilization of distal femur fractures with periarticular locking plates can cause inconsistent and asymmetric formation of periosteal callus. A larger bridge span only minimally improves callus formation. The more flexible titanium plates enhanced callus formation compared with stainless steel plates.",M1
20169393,"The effect of zoledronate during bone healing.BACKGROUND: Bisphosphonates have become the treatment of choice for a variety of bone diseases in which excessive osteoclastic activity is an important pathologic feature. However, inhibition of osteoclastic activity could lead to inhibition of remodeling during bone healing or repair. The objective of this study is to investigate the effect of zoledronate (the most potent bisphosphonate) in the biological process of bone healing. METHODS: Thirty immature male rabbits were divided into two groups (control and experimental) of 15 animals each. Both groups were submitted to fibular osteotomy. Only in the experimental group a single dose of zoledronate was administered. After 1, 2, and 4 weeks, animals of both groups were euthanized and the osteotomy site was histomorphometrically evaluated. The associated parameters analyzed were tissue volume (TV), fractional trabecular bone volume (BV/TV), fractional woven bone volume (WoV/TV), fractional periosteal fibrous volume (FbV/TV), and medullary fibrous volume (MaV/TV). RESULTS: The first week of healing was characterized by small <e>callus</e> area (experimental group) and less periosteal fibrosis. The second week was characterized by a large quantity of woven bone and marked decrease in periosteal fibrosis in the two groups. In the control group there was also a significant increase in trabecular bone. The fourth week was characterized by increased amount of woven bone and trabecular bone in the experimental group; there was increased medullary fibrosis in the two groups, while there continued to be significantly less periosteal fibrosis in the experimental group. CONCLUSIONS: Zoledronate does not prevent bone healing. However, the effect of zoledronate was characterized by accentuated stimulation of primary bone production and probably inhibition of remodeling, leading to retention of trabecular bone.",M1
20108320,"Rejuvenation of the inflammatory system stimulates fracture repair in aged mice.Age significantly reduces the regenerative capacity of the skeleton, but the underlying causes are unknown. Here, we tested whether the functional status of inflammatory cells contributes to delayed healing in aged animals. We created chimeric mice by bone marrow transplantation after lethal irradiation. In this model, chondrocytes and osteoblasts in the regenerate are derived exclusively from host cells while inflammatory cells are derived from the donor. Using this model, the inflammatory system of middle-aged mice (12 month old) was replaced by transplanted bone marrow from juvenile mice (4 weeks old), or age-matched controls. We found that the middle-aged mice receiving juvenile bone marrow had larger calluses and more bone formation during early stages and faster <e>callus</e> remodeling at late stages of fracture healing, indicating that inflammatory cells derived from the juvenile bone marrow accelerated bone repair in the middle-aged animals. In contrast, transplanting bone marrow from middle-aged mice to juvenile mice did not alter the process of fracture healing in juvenile mice. Thus, the roles of inflammatory cells in fracture healing may be age-related, suggesting the possibility of enhancing fracture healing in aged animals by manipulating the inflammatory system.",M1
20063384,"Inhibition of STAT1 accelerates bone fracture healing.Skeletal fracture healing involves a variety of cellular and molecular events; however, the mechanisms behind these processes are not fully understood. In the current study, we investigated the potential involvement of the signal transducer and activator of transcription 1 (STAT1), a critical regulator for both osteoclastogenesis and osteoblast differentiation, in skeletal fracture healing. We used a fracture model and a cortical defect model in mice, and found that fracture <e>callus</e> remodeling and membranous ossification are highly accelerated in STAT1-deficient mice. Additionally, we found that STAT1 suppresses Osterix transcript levels and Osterix promoter activity in vitro, indicating the suppression of Osterix transcription as one of the mechanisms behind the inhibitory effect of STAT1 on osteoblast differentiation. Furthermore, we found that fludarabine, a potent STAT1 inhibitor, significantly increases bone formation in a heterotopic ossification model. These results reveal previously unknown functions of STAT1 in skeletal homeostasis and may have important clinical implications for the treatment of skeletal bone fracture.",M1
20063381,"Modulation of Wnt signaling influences fracture repair.While the importance of Wnt signaling in skeletal development and homeostasis is well documented, little is known regarding its function in fracture repair. We hypothesized that activation and inactivation of Wnt signaling would enhance and impair fracture repair, respectively. Femoral fractures were generated in Lrp5 knockout mice (Lrp5-/-) and wild-type littermates (Lrp5+/+), as well as C57BL/6 mice. Lrp5-/- and Lrp5+/+ mice were untreated, while C57BL/6 mice were treated 2x/week with vehicle or anti-Dkk1 antibodies (Dkk1 Ab) initiated immediately postoperatively (Day 0) or 4 days postoperatively (Day 4). Fractures were radiographed weekly until sacrifice at day 28, followed by DXA, pQCT, and biomechanical analyses. Lrp5-/- mice showed impaired repair compared to Lrp5+/+ mice, as evidenced by reduced <e>callus</e> area, BMC, BMD, and biomechanical properties. The effects of Dkk1 Ab treatment depended on the timing of initiation. Day 0 initiation enhanced repair, with significant gains seen for callus area, BMC, BMD, and biomechanical properties, whereas Day 4 initiation had no effect. These results validated our hypothesis that Wnt signaling influences fracture repair, with prompt activation enhancing repair and inactivation impairing it. Furthermore, these data suggest that activation of Wnt signaling during fracture repair may have clinical utility in facilitating fracture repair.",M1
20036345,"bFGF-Modified BMMSCs enhance bone regeneration following distraction osteogenesis in rabbits.Distraction osteogenesis (DO), which induces new bone formation along the vector of pull without requiring the use of bone graft, has become a valuable surgical method for patients with limb discrepancy or craniofacial microsomia. However, the long treatment period and possible fibrous union or nonunion hampers its further clinical application. Bone marrow mesenchymal stem cells (BMMSCs) have been widely used as a source of cell therapy or a vector for gene transfer. Basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) has high potential for promotion of bone regeneration. However, bFGF has a short half value period in vivo. In this study, osteodistraction was applied in craniofacial bone of rabbit to observe the effects of BMMSCs with or without bFGF gene transfected on bone regeneration in the distracted zone. Mandibular lengthening (10 mm) was performed in 42 New Zealand white rabbits using a rapid distraction rate (2 mm/day). The animals were then randomly divided into group A, group B and group C (n=14 for each group). At the end of distraction, physiological saline, autologous BMMSCs and BMMSCs transfected with bFGF were injected into the distraction gaps in groups A, B, and C, respectively. Eight weeks after DO, the rabbits were sacrificed, and the distracted mandibles were harvested and processed for radiography, dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DXA), micro-CT, histology and three-point bend testing. Under a rapid distraction, immature or poor bone healing was observed in the distracted <e>callus</e> from group A. However, better bone formation and higher bone mineral density (BMD) and bone mineral content (BMC) in the distracted callus were observed in group B and group C, the latter showed excellent bone formation and highest BMD and BMC. Such finding was confirmed by histological and micro-CT examinations. The values of BT/TV in group C were highest and the micro-architecture presented more mature characteristics. The mechanical strength in group C was 1.63-fold and 1.28-fold greater than that in group A and B by three-point bending testing. The results of this study suggest that BMMSCs transplantation can promote bone formation in DO, and bFGF-modified BMMSCs were more effective in this enhancement.",M1
20026440,"Comparison of effects of alfacalcidol and alendronate on mechanical properties and bone collagen cross-links of <e>callus</e> in the fracture repair rat model.Both bone density and quality are important determinants of bone strength. Bone quality is prescribed by matrix characteristic including collagen cross-linking and bone structural characteristics and is important in reinforcement of bone strength. We investigated the effects of alfacalcidol (ALF), a prodrug of calcitriol, and alendronate (ALN), a bisphosphanate, on the mechanical properties and content of enzymatic cross-links in femoral bone using a fracture repair rat model. Forty 3-month-old female Wistar-Imamichi rats were randomized into 4 groups: SHAM (sham-operated+vehicle), OVX (ovariectomy+vehicle), ALF (ovariectomy+ALF, 0.1 microg/kg/d, p.o.) and ALN (ovariectomy+ALN, 10 microg/kg/d, s.c.). Treatment began immediately after SHAM or OVX surgery. Three weeks later, all animals underwent transverse osteotomies at the midshaft of the left femur. Treatment was continued and rats were sacrificed at 12 weeks post-fracture for evaluation by X-ray radiography, micro-CT, pQCT, biomechanical testing and bone histomorphometry. In the ALN group, no new cortical shell appeared and the callus diameter was significantly larger than in the OVX group (p&lt;0.05). Stiffness of fractured callus in the ALF group, but not in the ALN group, was significantly higher than in the OVX group. Young's modulus in the ALN group was significantly decreased compared to the OVX group. Moreover, micro-CT analysis showed that ALN treatment increased the lowly mineralized bone in the callus by, resulting in the highest content of woven bone area and lowest content of lamellar bone. The total amount of enzymatic cross-links in both the ALF and ALN groups was significantly higher than in the OVX control group. Of particular interest, the Pyr-to-Dpyr ratio was significantly decreased by ALF administration, suggesting that ALF but not ALN normalized the enzymatic cross-link patterns in fractured bone to the control level. In conclusion, ALN and ALF treatment increased bone strength via the distinctive effect on bone mass and quality. ALN formed larger calluses and increased enzymatic cross-links despite delayed woven bone remodeling into lamellar bone, whereas ALF treatment induced lamellar bone formation coincided with increasing in the enzymatic cross-linking and normalizing the cross-link pattern in callus to native bone pattern.",M1
19995322,"Parathyroid hormone PTH(1-34) increases the volume, mineral content, and mechanical properties of regenerated mineralizing tissue after distraction osteogenesis in rabbits.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Parathyroid hormone (PTH) has attracted considerable interest as a bone anabolic agent. Recently, it has been suggested that PTH can also enhance bone repair after fracture and distraction osteogenesis. We analyzed bone density and strength of the newly regenerated mineralized tissue after intermittent treatment with PTH in rabbits, which undergo Haversian bone remodeling similar to that in humans. METHODS: 72 New Zealand White rabbits underwent tibial mid-diaphyseal osteotomy and the <e>callus</e> was distracted 1 mm/day for 10 days. The rabbits were divided into 3 groups, which received injections of PTH 25 microg/kg/day for 30 days, saline for 10 days and PTH 25 microg/kg/day for 20 days, or saline for 30 days. At the end of the study, the rabbits were killed and the bone density was evaluated with DEXA. The mechanical bone strength was determined by use of a 3-point bending test. RESULTS: In the 2 PTH-treated groups the regenerate callus ultimate load was 33% and 30% higher, absorbed energy was 100% and 65% higher, BMC was 61% and 60% higher, and callus tissue volume was 179% and 197% higher than for the control group. INTERPRETATION: We found that treatment with PTH during distraction osteogenesis resulted in substantially higher mineralized tissue volume, mineral content, and bending strength. This suggests that treatment with PTH may benefit new bone formation during distraction osteogenesis and could form a basis for clinical application of this therapy in humans.",M1
19960189,"Strontium ranelate enhances <e>callus</e> strength more than PTH 1-34 in an osteoporotic rat model of fracture healing.Treatment of an underlying disease is often initiated after the occurrence of an osteoporotic fracture. Our aim was to investigate whether teriparatide (PTH 1-34) and strontium ranelate affect fracture healing in ovariectomized (OVX) rats when provided for the first time after the occurrence of an osteoporotic fracture. We combined the model of an OVX rat with a closed diaphyseal fracture. Sixty Sprague Dawley rats were randomly assigned to four groups. Fracture healing in OVX rats after treatment with pharmacological doses of strontium ranelate and PTH 1-34 was compared with OVX and sham-treated control groups. After 28 days, the femur was excised and scanned by micro computed tomography and the callus evaluated, after which biomechanical torsional testing was performed and torque and toughness until reaching the yield point were analyzed. Only treatment with strontium ranelate led to a significant increase in callus resistance compared to the OVX control rats, whereas both PTH 1-34 and strontium ranelate increased the bone volume/tissue volume ratio of the callus. The PTH 1-34-increased trabecular bone volume within the callus was even higher compared to sham. As for the callus tissue volume, the increase induced by strontium ranelate was significant, contrary to the changes induced by PTH. Callus in strontium ranelate-treated animals is more resistant to torsion compared with OVX control rats. To our knowledge, this is the first report of the enhancement of fracture healing by strontium ranelate. Because both treatments enhance bone and tissue volume within the callus, there may be a qualitative difference between the calluses of PTH 1-34- and strontium ranelate-treated OVX rats. The superior results obtained with strontium ranelate compared to PTH in terms of callus resistance could be the consequence of a better quality of the new bone formed within the callus.",M1
19949941,"Do estrogen and alendronate improve metaphyseal fracture healing when applied as osteoporosis prophylaxis?Osteoporosis is accompanied by predominantly metaphyseal fractures with a delayed and qualitatively reduced healing process. This study addressed the question of whether fracture healing in the context of osteoporosis prophylaxis is improved with estrogen (E) or alendronate (ALN). Thirty-six ovariectomized and 12 sham-operated 12-week-old rats received soy-free (osteoporotic C, sham), E-, or ALN- supplemented diets. After 10 weeks, a metaphyseal tibia osteotomy and standardized T-plate fixation were performed. After a 5-week healing process, the fracture <e>callus</e> was evaluated qualitatively by biomechanical bending test and quantitatively in microradiographic sections. The time course of callus formation was examined using fluorochrome-labeled histological sections. Administration of E improved the biomechanical properties of callus (stiffness [N/mm]: sham: 110.2 + or - 76.07, C: 41.28 + or - 33.70, E: 85.72 + or - 47.24, ALN: 72.07 + or - 34.68). The resistance to microfracturing seen in E-treated animals was significantly enhanced and even superior to sham (yield load [N] sham: 27.44 + or - 9.72, C: 21.04 + or - 12.47, E: 42.85 + or - 13.74(Delta), ALN: 25.28 + or - 6.4(.)) (* P &lt; 0.05 vs. sham group, (Delta) P &lt; 0.05 vs. C group, (*) P &lt; 0.05 vs. E group). Trabecular bone in particular was improved, indicating the presence of physiological endosteal bridging (Tr.Dn [%] sham: 10.53 + or - 18.9, C: 1.01 + or - 0.14, E: 24.13 + or - 34.09(Delta), ALN: 3.99 + or - 8.3(.)). ALN did not help bone healing, as shown by mechanical tests. Compared to the C group, statistically, ALN did not show worse properties. The induction of callus formation under ALN treatment was slightly delayed (Tt.Cl [mm(2)] sham: 3.68 + or - 0.66, C: 3.44 + or - 0.42, E: 3.69 + or - 0.58, ALN: 3.06 + or - 0.56). Osteoporotic metaphyseal fracture healing was qualitatively and quantitatively improved by E prophylaxis. The process of fracture healing occurred nearly physiologically (shamlike). Notably, ALN hardly improved metaphyseal callus properties when assessed as osteoporosis prophylaxis, but to a lesser extent than E.",M1
19949285,"Three-dimensional microstructural properties of regenerated mineralizing tissue after PTH (1-34) treatment in a rabbit tibial lengthening model.Since the approval of parathyroid hormone (PTH) as treatment for osteoporosis, PTH has increasingly been investigated for bone repair and regeneration. The aim of the study was to investigate the effects of intermittent PTH treatment on the microstructure of regenerated mineralizing tissue after distraction osteogenesis in rabbits. After tibial mid-diaphyseal osteotomy the <e>callus</e> was distracted 1 mm/day for 10 days. 72 rabbits were divided in to 3 groups, which daily received a PTH (1-34) 25 microg/kg injection for 30 days; a saline injection for 10 days and a PTH injection for 20 days; or a saline injection for 30 days. The microstructure of the regenerate was assessed by micro computed tomography (microCT). In all 51 obtained specimens were evaluated morphometrically using three different volumes of interests. The results showed that treatment with PTH during distraction osteogenesis resulted in a significantly higher trabecular number, a more isotropic trabecular orientation, a higher connectivity density, and a higher mineralizing tissue mass. We also found that distraction calluses treated with PTH were more mature than the non-treated. Conclusion: treatment with PTH resulted in an enhanced microstructure of the newly regenerated mineralizing tissue indicating that PTH has a potential role as a stimulating agent during distraction osteogenesis.",M1
19949126,"Femoral lengthening in achondroplasia: magnitude of lengthening in relation to patterns of <e>callus</e>, stiffness of adjacent joints and fracture.Extensive limb lengthening may be indicated in achondroplastic patients who wish to achieve a height within the normal range for their population. However, increasing the magnitude of lengthening is associated with further complications particularly adjacent joint stiffness and fractures. We studied the relationship between the magnitude of femoral lengthening and callus pattern, adjacent joint stiffness and fracture of the regenerate bone in 40 femoral lengthenings in 20 achondroplastic patients. They were divided into two groups; group A had lengthening of less than 50% and group B of more than 50% of their initial femoral length. The patterns of radiological callus formation were classified according to shape, type and features. The incidence of callus features, knee stiffness and regenerate bone fracture were analysed in the two groups. Group B was associated with an increased incidence of concave, lateral and central callus shapes, adjacent joint and stiffness and fracture. Statistically, the incidence of stiffness in adjacent joints and regenerate bone fracture was significantly associated with the magnitude of lengthening. We suggest that careful radiological assessment of the patterns of callus formation is a useful method for the evaluation and monitoring of regenerate bone.",M1
19921394,"In vitro biochemical evaluation of cadmium tolerance  mechanism in <e>callus</e> and seedlings of Brassica juncea.In vitro grown callus and seedlings of Brassica juncea were treated with equimolar concentrations of cadmium and compared for their respective tolerance to cadmium. Calli cultures were grown on Murashige and Skoog medium supplemented with alpha 6-benzyl aminopurine (200 microg (-1), naphthalene acetic acid 200 microg L(-1)) and 2,4-dichloro-phenoxy acetic acid (65 microg L(-1)) while the seedlings grown on Hoagland's nutrient solution have been carried out. Cellular homeostasis and detoxification to cadmium in B. juncea were studied by analyzing the growth in terms of fresh weight and dry weight, lipid peroxidation, proline accumulation, and antioxidative enzymes (superoxide dismutase (SOD), ascorbate peroxidase (APX), and catalase (CAT)). At 200 microM cadmium, callus and seedlings showed 73.61% and 74.76% reduction in tolerance, respectively. A significant increase in malondialdehyde (MDA) content was found in both calli and seedlings; however, the amount of MDA content was more in seedlings. Proline content increased on lower concentration of cadmium (up to 50 microM), and it further decreased (up to 200 microM). But the accumulation of proline was higher in callus cultures. The overall activity of antioxidative enzymes (SOD, CAT, and APX) was found to be higher in callus in comparison to seedlings of B. juncea. Callus and seedlings showed a significant (P &lt;or= 0.5) increase in SOD activity in a concentration-dependent manner up to 50 microM cadmium concentration but decreased further. APX activity increased significantly at low cadmium levels but CAT activity decreased significantly throughout on increasing cadmium concentrations from 5 to 200 microM, respectively. Hence, it was observed that callus of B. juncea was more tolerant in comparison to seedlings exposed to equimolar concentrations of cadmium. Thus, from the present studies, it is concluded that calli were more tolerant toward cadmium-induced oxidative stress. Hence, it is suitable material for the study of cadmium tolerance mechanisms and for the manipulations within them for better understanding of cadmium detoxification strategies in B. juncea.",M1
19914623,"A computational technique to measure fracture <e>callus</e> in radiographs.Callus formation occurs in the presence of secondary bone healing and has relevance to the fracture's mechanical environment. An objective image processing algorithm was developed to standardize the quantitative measurement of periosteal callus area in plain radiographs of long bone fractures. Algorithm accuracy and sensitivity were evaluated using surrogate models. For algorithm validation, callus formation on clinical radiographs was measured manually by orthopaedic surgeons and compared to non-clinicians using the algorithm. The algorithm measured the projected area of surrogate calluses with less than 5% error. However, error will increase when analyzing very small areas of callus and when using radiographs with low image resolution (i.e. 100 pixels per inch). The callus size extracted by the algorithm correlated well to the callus size outlined by the surgeons (R2=0.94, p&lt;0.001). Furthermore, compared to clinician results, the algorithm yielded results with five times less inter-observer variance. This computational technique provides a reliable and efficient method to quantify secondary bone healing response.",M1
19903498,"Changes of substance P during fracture healing in ovariectomized mice.Neuropeptides may play an important role in the healing process of osteoporotic fractures. The objective of this study was to determine the role of substance P during osteoporotic fracture healing. One hundred ninety-two mice were randomized into ovariectomy (OVX) and control (CON) group (n=96, respectively). Femoral shaft fracture was created 3 weeks after OVX. Bone mineral density (BMD), micro-CT (microCT) analysis of fracture <e>callus</e> formation and mineralization, microCT analysis of fracture site neovascularization and biomechanical property as well as substance P levels were evaluated 1, 2, 4, and 8 weeks after fracture and compared with CON group. Following OVX-induced bone loss, fracture healing in OVX mice was significantly poorer than that in CON mice, with a significant decrease of substance P at the fracture site at all time points and with the level at early stage (1 and 2 weeks) higher than later stage (4 and 8 weeks). Impaired angiogenesis was also noted in OVX mice. No significant change of substance P level in serum was found between different groups or time points. In conclusion, fracture healing is inferior in OVX-induced bone loss and associated with a significant decrease of substance P. Substance P may play an important role during osteoporotic fracture healing.",M1
19884440,"Pharmacological inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase accelerates and enhances fracture-healing.BACKGROUND: Loss of cyclooxygenase-2 activity is known to impair fracture-healing in animal models and to inhibit heterotopic ossification in humans. Cyclooxygenase-2 is the rate-limiting enzyme involved in the conversion of arachidonic acid into prostaglandins. Arachidonic acid also is a substrate for 5-lipoxygenase, which catalyzes the initial steps in leukotriene synthesis. In contrast to cyclooxygenase-2, genetic ablation of 5-lipoxygenase accelerates and enhances fracture-healing in mice. The goal of this study was to determine if systemic inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase with an orally delivered drug could accelerate fracture-healing. METHODS: Closed femoral fractures were made in Sprague-Dawley rats. The rats were treated with oral doses of vehicle (ninety-five rats), celecoxib (fifty-nine rats), or AA-861 (a 5-lipoxygenase inhibitor; eighty-nine rats). Fracture-healing was measured with use of radiographs, histomorphometry, and biomechanical testing. Effects of drug treatments on <e>callus</e> cell proliferation and gene expression were determined by incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine and quantitative polymerase chain reactions, respectively. RESULTS: AA-861 treatment decreased fracture-bridging time, significantly increased early callus cartilage (5.6-fold; p &lt; 0.001) and bone formation (4.2-fold; p = 0.015), and significantly increased callus mechanical properties compared with the vehicle-treated rat fractures. Callus cell proliferation rate was increased by AA-861 treatment, compared with vehicle, at day 2 after fracture (3.68% compared with 2.08%; p &lt; 0.001; 95% confidence interval, -2.81 to -0.039) but was reduced by celecoxib treatment at day 4 after fracture (4.22% compared with 1.84%; p &lt; 0.001; 95% confidence interval, 2.27 to 4.07). At day 10 after fracture, AA-861 and celecoxib treatment increased Type-II collagen mRNA levels (16.0-fold and 6.1-fold, respectively; p &lt; 0.001 for both), but only AA-861 treatment caused an increase in Type-X collagen mRNA (6.3-fold; p &lt; 0.001). AA-861 treatment significantly increased cyclooxygenase-2 (4.0-fold at day 10; p &lt; 0.001) and osteopontin mRNA levels (3.6-fold at day 7; p = 0.024), while decreasing 5-lipoxygenase mRNA levels (5.6-fold at day 4; p &lt; 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Systemic inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase with an orally delivered drug significantly accelerated and enhanced fracture-healing in this rat model. Gene expression analysis indicates that cyclooxygenase-2 is necessary for callus chondrocytes to progress into hypertrophy so as to complete endochondral ossification. Conversely, inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase alters the inflammatory response, which enhances callus chondrocyte hypertrophy and accelerates endochondral ossification.",M1

19717946,"[An unusual cause of shoulder pain: stress fracture of the clavicle]We report a case of stress fracture of the clavicle in which diagnosis was delayed due to the unusual localization of pain and absence of predisposing risk factors. A 34-year-old woman presented with severe right-sided pain in the shoulder, arm, neck, and hemithorax, and numbness in her right upper extremity. Systemic radiographs, cervical and brachial plexus magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and thorax computed tomography (CT) did not show any pathology. In a retrospective review of the shoulder MRI sections, an edematous appearance was noted in the right clavicle and adjacent soft tissues, suggesting a stress fracture of the clavicle. The patient was followed-up with activity limitation and analgesic treatment and her complaints subsided gradually. Control radiographs obtained 10 months later showed fracture healing with atypical <e>callus</e> formation. Stress fractures of the clavicle must be kept in mind in the differential diagnosis of shoulder pain presenting as an atypical severe arm pain radiating to the upper extremity and hemithorax. In suspected cases, it may be helpful to obtain CT and MRI sections parallel to the long axis of the clavicle.",M1
19679210,"Sex-specific compromised bone healing in female rats might be associated with a decrease in mesenchymal stem cell quantity.INTRODUCTION: The clinically known importance of patient sex as a major risk factor for compromised bone healing is poorly reflected in animal models. Consequently, the underlying cellular mechanisms remain elusive. Because mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) are postulated to regulate tissue regeneration and give rise to essential differentiated cell types, they may contribute to sex-specific differences in bone healing outcomes. METHODS: We investigated sex-specific variations in bone healing and associated differences in MSC populations. A 1.5 mm osteotomy gap in the femora of 8 male and 8 female 12-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats was stabilized by an external fixator. Healing was analyzed in terms of biomechanical testing, bridging and <e>callus</e> size over time (radiography at 2, 4, and 6 weeks after surgery), and callus volume and geometry by microCT at final follow-up. MSCs were obtained from bone marrow samples of an age-matched group of 12 animals (6 per gender) and analyzed for numbers of colony-forming units (CFUs) and their capacity to differentiate and proliferate. The proportion of senescent cells was determined by beta-galactosidase staining. RESULTS: Sex-specific differences were indicated by a compromised mechanical competence of the callus in females compared with males (maximum torque at failure, p=0.028). Throughout the follow-up, the cross-sectional area of callus relative to bone was reduced in females (p&lt; or =0.01), and the bridging of callus was delayed (p(2weeks)=0.041). microCT revealed a reduced callus size (p=0.003), mineralization (p=0.003) and polar moment of inertia (p=0.003) in female animals. The female bone marrow contained significantly fewer MSCs, represented by low CFU numbers in both femora and tibiae (p(femur)=0.017, p(tibia)=0.010). Functional characteristics of male and female MSCs were similar. CONCLUSION: Biomechanically compromised and radiographically delayed bone formation were distinctive in female rats. These differences were concomitant with a reduced number of MSCs, which may be causative for the suboptimal bone healing.",M1
19678759,"Insight into the molecular pathophysiology of delayed bone healing in a sheep model.Delayed and nonunions are still challenging problems. In this study, we examined the endogenous mRNA expression of genes regulating cartilage formation, bone formation, endochondral ossification, and bone remodeling during mechanically induced delayed bone healing in a large animal model. A tibial osteotomy was performed in two groups of sheep and stabilized with either a rigid external fixator leading to standard healing or with a rotationally unstable fixator leading to delayed healing. At days 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21, and 42 after surgery, total RNA was extracted from the <e>callus</e>. Gene expressions of several molecules functionally important for bone healing were studied by quantitative reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction. The expression profiles were related to callus tissue composition, analyzed by histomorphometry. Histomorphometry demonstrated a delayed, prolonged chondral phase and a reduction in bone formation in the experimental group. There was no differential expression of Runx2 between both groups until day 42, but mRNA expression levels of BMP2, BMP4, BMP7, noggin, Col1a1, IGF1, TGFbeta1, OPN, MMP9, MMP13, TIMP3, TNFalpha, MCSF, RANKL, and OPG were lower in the delayed healing group at several time points. This study provides insight into the temporal periods during which various factors may be deficient during a compromised bone-healing situation.",M1
19678758,"Controlled dynamization to enhance reconstruction capacity of tissue-engineered bone in healing critically sized bone defects: an in vivo study in goats.Tissue-engineered bone (TEB) has shown to be an effective alternative to conventional gold-standard autogenous bone for the repair of critically sized bone defects (CSBD). Moderate axial interfragmentary movement (IFM) has been shown to promote bone healing in conventional models. This study explored the use of IFM to enhance the capacity of TEB in the repair of CSBD using a goat model. CSBD were created in a goat model. Dynamic intramedullary rods designed to supply axial IFMs within 10% of the interfragmentary strain were used to stabilize CSBD goat femur models, whose bone defects were filled with TEB. Bone regeneration was evaluated using radionuclide bone imaging, roentgenographic analysis, periosteal <e>callus</e> area, computed tomography value score, biomechanical analysis, and histological observation. Compared with the static intramedullary rods, the dynamic intramedullary rod group showed an increase in early-stage callus formation and blood supply to the callus tissue, better differentiation of fibrous and cartilaginous tissue into bone tissue, improved strength and stiffness of callus tissue in late-stage healing, and overall better functional recovery of the goat femur. This showed that moderate axial IFM could promote the osteogenesis and reconstruction of TEB in vivo.",M1
19657702,"Objective guidelines for removing an external fixator after tibial lengthening using pixel value ratio: a pilot study.During limb lengthening over an intramedullary nail, decisions regarding external fixator removal and weightbearing depend on the amount of <e>callus</e> seen at the lengthening area on radiographs. However, this method is subjective and objective evaluation of the amount of callus likely would minimize nail or interlocking screw breakage and refracture after fixator removal. We asked how many cortices with full corticalization of the newly formed bone at the lengthening area are needed to allow fixator removal and full weightbearing and how to radiographically determine the stage of corticalization. We retrospectively reviewed 17 patients (34 lengthenings) who underwent bilateral tibial lengthenings over an intramedullary nail. The average gain in length was 7.2 +/- 3.4 cm. We determined the pixel value ratio (ratio of pixel value of regenerate versus the mean pixel value of adjacent bone) of the lengthened area on radiographs. There were no nail or screw breakage and refracture. Partial weightbearing with crutches was permitted when the pixel value ratio was 1 in two cortices and full weightbearing without crutches was permitted when the pixel value ratio was 1 in three cortices. The pixel value ratio on radiographs can be an objective parameter for callus measurement and may provide guidelines for the timing of external fixator removal. We cannot determine from our limited data the minimum pixel value in how many cortices would suggest safe removal, but we can say our criteria were not associated with subsequent refracture.",M1
19653054,"Can rhBMP-2 containing collagen sponges enhance bone repair in ovariectomized rats?: a preliminary study.With an aging population the frequency of postmenopausal fractures is increasing. Methods to enhance the repair of osteoporotic bone repair therefore become more important to reduce the society burden of care. We asked if absorbable collagen sponges containing recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (rhBMP-2) have the potential to enhance bone repair. We randomly assigned 40 rats into the ovariectomy and sham operation groups. A segmental defect was created in the right tibia 12 weeks after ovariectomy. rhBMP-2-containing absorbable collagen sponges were implanted into the defect in half of the animals in each group. We analyzed radiographs and histological sections and performed three-point bending tests to assess repair. Radiological scores in the rhBMP-2 applied rats were higher than those in controls at the end of 8 weeks after tibial osteotomy. The specimens failed under higher loads in the rhBMP-2-applied groups and histology revealed a higher fracture healing score, including <e>callus</e> formation, bone union, marrow changes, and cortex remodeling. We observed no adverse tissue responses such as fibrous connective tissue formation and inflammatory cellular infiltration. rhBMP-2 in absorbable collagen sponges enhanced bone repair in segmental tibial defects of ovariectomized rats. The sponges with rhBMP-2 appeared to enhance bone repair.",M1
19647826,"Optical acquisition and polar decomposition of the full-field deformation gradient tensor within a fracture <e>callus</e>.Tracking tissue deformation is often hampered by material inhomogeneity, so local measurements tend to be insufficient thus lending to the necessity of full-field optical measurements. This study presents a novel approach to factoring heterogeneous deformation of soft and hard tissues in a fracture callus by introducing an anisotropic metric derived from the deformation gradient tensor (F). The deformation gradient tensor contains all the information available in a Green-Lagrange strain tensor, plus the rigid-body rotational components. A recent study [Bottlang et al., Journal of Biomechanics 41(3), 2008] produced full-field strains within ovine fracture calluses acquired through the application of electronic speckle pattern interferometery (ESPI). The technique is based on infinitesimal strain approximation (Engineering Strain) whose scheme is not independent of rigid-body rotation. In this work, for rotation extraction, the stretch and rotation tensors were separately determined from F by the polar decomposition theorem. Interfragmentary motions in a fracture gap were characterized by the two distinct mechanical factors (stretch and rotation) at each material point through full-field mapping. In the composite nature of bone and soft tissue, collagen arrangements are hypothesized such that fibers locally aligned with principal directions will stretch and fibers not aligned with the principal direction will rotate and stretch. This approach has revealed the deformation gradient tensor as an appropriate quantification of strain within callus bony and fibrous tissue via optical measurements.",M1
19640053,"Numerical and experimental simulation of the effect of long bone fracture healing stages on ultrasound transmission across an idealized fracture.The effect of various stages of fracture healing on the amplitude of 200 kHz ultrasonic waves propagating along cortical bone plates and across an idealized fracture has been modeled numerically and experimentally. A simple, water-filled, transverse fracture was used to simulate the inflammatory stage. Next, a symmetric external <e>callus</e> was added to represent the repair stage, while a callus of reducing size was used to simulate the remodeling stage. The variation in the first arrival signal amplitude across the fracture site was calculated and compared with data for an intact plate in order to calculate the fracture transmission loss (FTL) in decibels. The inclusion of the callus reduced the fracture loss. The most significant changes were calculated to occur from the initial inflammatory phase to the formation of a callus (with the FTL reducing from 6.3 to between 5.5 and 3.5 dB, depending on the properties of the callus) and in the remodeling phase where, after a 50% reduction in the size of the callus, the FTL reduced to between 2.0 and 1.3 dB. Qualitatively, the experimental results follow the model predictions. The change in signal amplitude with callus geometry and elastic properties could potentially be used to monitor the healing process.",M1
19635715,"Effects of neuropeptides and vasoactive substances on microcirculation of the <e>callus</e> after tibial osteotomy in rabbits.Previous studies have demonstrated a dynamic ingrowth of vessels into the developing callus. In this study, maturation and development of the regulation of microcirculation were followed in the callus of rabbits. In the first series, the effects of vasoactive substances on blood flow velocity, perfusion pressure, duration of effects and peripheral vascular resistance of the bone marrow in the femur and tibia were compared. In the second series, the same parameters were measured in the femur and in the developing callus 10 and 15 days following gap osteotomy of the tibia. There were no significant differences between the microcirculatory reactions of the intact femur and tibia. Basal blood flow could be verified in the callus on the 10th postoperative day. No vascular reactions could be elicited. Basal blood flow velocity was higher on the 15th day, when compared to the measurements on the 10th day. The substances elicited statistically significant differences in flow velocity, resistance and 50% recovery time in the callus on the 15th day. Blood flow reactions of the ipsilateral femoral and tibial bone marrow are identical, thus the femur can serve as a reference site for blood flow measurements in the callus. Regulation and maturation of callus microcirculation develop rapidly between the 10th and 15th days.",M1
19628768,"Rescue of impaired fracture healing in COX-2-/- mice via activation of prostaglandin E2 receptor subtype 4.Although the essential role of cyclooxygenase (COX)-2 in fracture healing is known, the targeted genes and molecular pathways remain unclear. Using prostaglandin E2 receptor (EP)2 and EP4 agonists, we examined the effects of EP receptor activation in compensation for the lack of COX-2 during fracture healing. In a fracture-healing model, COX-2(-/-) mice showed delayed initiation and impaired endochondral bone repair, accompanied by a severe angiogenesis deficiency. The EP4 agonist markedly improved the impaired healing in COX-2(-/-) mice, as evidenced by restoration of bony <e>callus</e> formation on day 14, a near complete reversal of bone formation, and an approximately 70% improvement of angiogenesis in the COX-2(-/-) callus. In comparison, the EP2 agonist only marginally enhanced bone formation in COX-2(-/-) mice. To determine the differential roles of EP2 and EP4 receptors on COX-2-mediated fracture repair, the effects of selective EP agonists on chondrogenesis were examined in E11.5 long-term limb bud micromass cultures. Only the EP4 agonist significantly increased cartilage nodule formation similar to that observed during prostaglandin E2 treatment. The prostaglandin E2/EP4 agonist also stimulated MMP-9 expression in bone marrow stromal cell cultures. The EP4 agonist further restored the reduction of MMP-9 expression in the COX-2(-/-) fracture callus. Taken together, our studies demonstrate that EP2 and EP4 have differential functions during endochondral bone repair. Activation of EP4, but not EP2 rescued impaired bone fracture healing in COX-2(-/-) mice.",M1
19586674,"Ultrasonographic and thermographic screening for latent inflammation in diabetic foot <e>callus</e>.AIMS: Inflammation within the diabetic foot callus may be an earliest, predicting symptom of foot ulcer developing later. The purpose of this study was to identify latent inflammation within the foot callus using thermography and ultrasonography, and to investigate relationship between the inflammatory findings in callus and presence or absence of diabetes. METHODS: This was a cross-sectional study of 60 cases with asymptomatic foot callus; the 30 diabetic patients and the 30 non-diabetic matched volunteers. Inflammation was defined using physiological imaging techniques; as skin temperature elevation in thermography and low echoic lesion in ultrasonography. RESULTS: Sixty-three and ninety-four calli were observed in the diabetic and non-diabetic groups, respectively. The inflammation signs were detected by both of the two techniques in 10% of the calli in the diabetic group. No inflammation was noted in the non-diabetic group (p=0.014). CONCLUSIONS: The inflammation signs presented here were specifically observed in the diabetic group. We consider that the physiological imaging techniques may be valuable screening tools for potential risk of diabetic foot ulcers.",M1
19565740,"[Effects of acupuncture on the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor in the ovariectomized rat fracture model]OBJECTIVE: To observe the effect of acupuncture on fracture in the ovariectomized rat and the mechanism. METHODS: Sixty SD female rats were randomly divided into 4 groups: normal group (group A), model group (group B), acupuncture group (group C) and Nilestriol group (group D). In all the groups, except the group A which received sham operation, the rats were overiectomized for preparing the osteoporosis model. Three months after the ovariectomy, the left femurs of the rats were closely fractured. Then, the group A and B were treated with oral administration of normal saline solution, 3 mL, weekly. The rats in the group C were treated daily with acupuncture at  Huantiao (GB 30),  Housanli  (ST 36),  Yanglingquan (GB 34) and  Weizhong (BL 40) on the left hind legs; the rats in the group D were given orally Nilestriol solution (0.2 mg/mL) in a dose of 0.6 mL/100 g body weight, weekly. At the 7th, 14th, 21st and 28th days, some rats were sacrificed and their fractural <e>callus</e> and blood samples were taken for histological examinations and immunohistochemical examination of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and tyrosine kinase B (TrkB). RESULTS: HE stained callus slides observed by optical microscope showed that the process of fracture healing in the group A, C, D was faster than that in the group B. Positive immuno-stalning of BDNF and TrkB could be seen in the all groups, mainly on the 7 and 14 days after the fracture. The expression levels from high to low in turn were group A, C, D and B. CONCLUSION: Expressions of BDNF and TrkB in callus of osteoporotic fracture were less than that of the normal fracture; acupuncture can elevate the expression levels and accelerate the process of fracture healing.",M1
19563715,"[Low dose X-irradiation promotes <e>callus</e> mineralization: experiment with rats]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effect of low dose irradiation (LDI) on callus formation and mineralization. METHODS: 80 SD rats were subjected to standard closed fracture on right femur so as to establish animal models and then were randomly divided into 2 equal groups: LDI group undergoing low dose whole body X-ray irradiation of 1Gy right after fracture induction and control group without irradiation. 1, 2, 3, 4, and 8 weeks later blood samples were collected from the heart to examine the amounts of white blood cells and platelets and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) level. Conventional X-ray films were taken and MicroCT was conducted to evaluate the callus bridging. Then the rats were killed to take out the femurs to undergo histological examination. Peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) was conducted to quantify the bone mineral content (BMC). Four-point bending test was used to examine the mechanical properties of the callus. RESULTS: The maximum load value and histological score 2 weeks later of the LDI group were both lower than those of the control group, however, the serum ALP, BMC, maximum load level, callus bridging score, and histological score 3 weeks later of the LDI group were all significantly higher than those of the control groups (all P&lt;0.05). 4 and 8 weeks later there were not significant differences in all these parameters between the 2 groups. The WBC amount in the first 2 weeks of experiment of the LDI group was remarkably lower in these 2 groups, however, in the third week, the WBC value of the LDI group was higher than that of the control group (P&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: LDI promotes the mineralization at the stage of hard callus formation which is probably associated with progenitor cell mobilization.",M1
19544445,"Regenerative effects of transplanted mesenchymal stem cells in fracture healing.Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) have a therapeutic potential in patients with fractures to reduce the time of healing and treat nonunions. The use of MSC to treat fractures is attractive for several reasons. First, MSCs would be implementing conventional reparative process that seems to be defective or protracted. Secondly, the effects of MSCs treatment would be needed only for relatively brief duration of reparation. However, an integrated approach to define the multiple regenerative contributions of MSC to the fracture repair process is necessary before clinical trials are initiated. In this study, using a stabilized tibia fracture mouse model, we determined the dynamic migration of transplanted MSC to the fracture site, their contributions to the repair process initiation, and their role in modulating the injury-related inflammatory responses. Using MSC expressing luciferase, we determined by bioluminescence imaging that the MSC migration at the fracture site is time- and dose-dependent and, it is exclusively CXCR4-dependent. MSC improved the fracture healing affecting the <e>callus</e> biomechanical properties and such improvement correlated with an increase in cartilage and bone content, and changes in callus morphology as determined by micro-computed tomography and histological studies. Transplanting CMV-Cre-R26R-Lac Z-MSC, we found that MSCs engrafted within the callus endosteal niche. Using MSCs from BMP-2-Lac Z mice genetically modified using a bacterial artificial chromosome system to be beta-gal reporters for bone morphogenic protein 2 (BMP-2) expression, we found that MSCs contributed to the callus initiation by expressing BMP-2. The knowledge of the multiple MSC regenerative abilities in fracture healing will allow design of novel MSC-based therapies to treat fractures.",M1

19474254,"Evaluation of distracted mandibular bone using computed tomography scan and ultrasonography: technical note.OBJECTIVES: Distraction osteogenesis is considered an important reconstruction armamentarium in the management of mandibular deformities and deficiency disorders. The duration of the consolidation period is still a debatable issue among the clinicians. Evaluation of the newly formed bone is the cornerstone for terminating the consolidation period safely. The aim of this study is to find a more conservative protocol for the evaluation of <e>callus</e> distraction by monitoring bone healing using two different examination tools: ultrasonography and dental CT. METHODS: Four adult patients (three women and one man) underwent mandibular distraction (using two intraoral and two extraoral devices). The latency period was 5-7 days and the distraction was at a rate of 2 mm per day, with 12-14 weeks of consolidation. All patients were evaluated during activation, 3 months, 6 months and 1 year post-distraction. Evaluation included clinical examination, plain radiographs, CT and ultrasonography examinations. RESULTS: Ultrasonographic examination of the healing callus revealed four different phases of maturation. These phases were similar to the degree of tissue calcification as measured by CT. Tissue density across the distraction wound at the time of distractor removal (12-14 weeks) was equal to or less than one-third of normal bone density. CONCLUSIONS: Clinical monitoring of mandibular distraction wounds can be successfully achieved through frequent use of ultrasonographic examinations. Standardization of ultrasonography based on CT findings will expand the reliability of ultrasound in monitoring callus maturation. An algorithm for evaluation of distraction wound healing is suggested.",M1
19472384,"Early fracture <e>callus</e> displays smooth muscle-like viscoelastic properties ex vivo: implications for fracture healing.Cells of early, fibrous callus in bone fractures possess much alpha smooth muscle actin. This callus contracts and relaxes; however, active and passive components of its force production have yet to be defined. We aimed to establish whether passive viscoelastic properties of early soft fracture callus are smooth muscle-like in nature. Under anesthesia one rib was fractured in rats and calluses removed 7 days later for analysis. Urinary bladder detrusor muscle and Achilles tendon were also resected and analyzed. Force production in these tissues was measured using a force transducer when preparations were immersed in calcium-free Krebs-Henseleit solution (pH 7.4, 22 degrees C). Viscoelastic responses were measured in each preparation in response to 50 microN increases and decreases in force after achieving basal tissue tension by preconditioning. Callus, bladder, and tendon all displayed varying, reproducible degrees of stress relaxation (SR) and reverse stress relaxation (RSR) (n = 7 for all groups). Hysteresis was observed in callus, with the first SR response significantly larger than that produced in subsequent stretches (p &lt; 0.05). Callus SR responses were greater than tendon (p &lt; 0.001) but less than bladder (p &lt; 0.001). Callus RSR responses were greater than tendon (p &lt; 0.001), but no significant difference was seen between RSR of callus and bladder. We concluded that early, soft callus displayed significant SR and RSR phenomena similar to smooth muscle tissue, and SR and RSR may be important in maintenance of static tension in early callus by promoting osteogenesis and fracture healing.",M1
19464400,"Simvastatin locally applied from a biodegradable coating of osteosynthetic implants improves fracture healing comparable to BMP-2 application.Many clinical and experimental investigations address the influence of statins on bone formation and fracture healing. Simvastatin was shown to increase the expression of Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP-2), which is one of the most potent growth factors targeting bone formation. In this study, the effect of simvastatin locally applied from a bioactive polymer coating of implants on fracture healing was investigated. A closed fracture of the right tibia of 5-month-old Sprague-Dawley rats was performed. Intramedullary stabilization was achieved with uncoated vs. polymer-only coated vs. polymer plus drug coated titanium Kirschner wires. Test substances (either simvastatin low- or high dosed or BMP-2) were incorporated into a biodegradable layer of poly(d,l-lactide). Tibiae were harvested after 28 or 42 days, respectively and underwent biomechanical testing (torsional stiffness and maximum load) and histomorphometric analysis. Radiographic results demonstrated progressed <e>callus</e> consolidation in the BMP-2- and simvastatin-treated groups compared to the uncoated group at both timepoints. The simvastatin-high-dosed group revealed an increased torsional stiffness and significantly elevated maximum load (d 28) compared to control group as well as a significant increase in both parameters at d 42. BMP-2-treated animals showed significantly elevated maximum load and stiffness at the early timepoint and elevated torsional stiffness after d 42. The histomorphometric analysis revealed a significantly decreased cartilage area for BMP-2 treated animals at d 28. Even though an increase of mineralized areas among periosteal callus was found at d 42 for simvastatin-high as well as BMP-2 treated animals, no significant difference could be detected at both timepoints compared to the uncoated group. However, simvastatin-high treated animals revealed significantly reduced cartilage areas within the periosteal callus at d 42. The present study revealed a dose-dependent effect and improved fracture healing under local application of simvastatin. Biomechanical, radiographic and histomorphometric properties showed comparable results to BMP-2- treated animals in this study.",M1

Various guided wave modes are detected and extracted from a broadband signal at several discrete locations. The energy-spectrum and v(FEP) (effective velocity of the first energy peak in callus region) of guided modes are found sensitive to the healing process in different aspects and stages. The healing process may be divided into several sub-courses, each of which can be evaluated by different combinations of guided wave modes. The energy-spectrum indicates that the longitudinal tube modes L(0,1) and L(0,2) are suitable for early healing; L(0,1), L(0,2), L(0,3), and L(0,5) for midway-course; and L(0,1) and L(0,3) for late consolidation, while L(0,2), L(0,5), and L(0,8) are suitable for detecting the change in callus geometrics. The v(FEP) results suggest that L(0,5) for monitoring early-course; L(0,3) and L(0,7) for midway process; L(0,2) for later consolidation, and L(0,7) for monitoring geometrical variation.",M1

We used an in vivo critical bone defect model to determine whether local administration of DBP promotes bone defect healing. We created a 5-mm segmental bone defect in the radial shaft in a rat model. Forty-eight rats were assigned to eight groups: local application of 1 microg, 5 microg, 10 microg, or 50 microg DBP (DBP-1, DBP-5, DBP-10, DBP-50), autogenous bone marrow mononuclear cells with or without 10 microg DBP (BM-DBP-10, BM), 80 microg BMP-2 delivered in gelatin sponge (BMP-2), and the sham operated group. Radiographic evaluation, histological stains, and epifluorescence microscopy were performed. Grossly, all bone gaps of the BMP-2 group were solidly bridged by <e>callus</e>, while all those in the sham operated group remained unhealed by 9 weeks. Only one specimen of the BM-DBP-10 and DBP-50 groups and three specimens of the BM group were solidly healed; pseudarthroses occurred in all of the other specimens.

19418051,"Analysis of <e>callus</e> pattern of tibia lengthening in achondroplasia and a novel method of regeneration assessment using pixel values.OBJECTIVE: To relate morphology of new bone formation to outcome after tibial lengthening performed in patients with achondroplasia. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 60 tibial segments in 30 achondroplasia patients was performed. There were 22 female patients and eight male patients, with a mean age of 9.8 years. New bone formation was classified by shape, homogeneity and density. Pixel values in relation to original bone were measured using a picture-archiving communication system (PACS). Clinical outcome was described by the external fixator and maturation indices. RESULTS: Mean lengthening was 9.2 cm (range 3-12.7 cm). The mean external fixator index was 23.4 (range 15.1-50). The mean maturation index was 12.3 days/cm (range 6-40 days/cm). Homogeneous pathways were associated with the best clinical results (fixator index 20.4, maturation index 10.8), followed by heterogeneous pathway (external fixator index 26.5, maturation index 16.8) and radiolucent pathway (fixator index 31.2, maturation index 21.4). Both cylindrical (external fixator index 25.2, maturation index 14.5) and concave (external fixator index 26.6, maturation index 16.3) callus shapes were favourable. Mineralization of new bone became equal to that of normal bone within 16 weeks (mean) for homogeneous pathway, 12 weeks for heterogeneous pathway and 32 weeks for lucent pathway. CONCLUSION: The type of new bone formation seen on radiographs is related to clinical outcome, with homogeneous pathways being the most favourable ones.",M1
19414072,"Spatial and temporal variations of mechanical properties and mineral content of the external <e>callus</e> during bone healing.After bone fracture, various cellular activities lead to the formation of different tissue types, which form the basis for the process of secondary bone healing. Although these tissues have been quantified by histology, their material properties are not well understood. Thus, the aim of this study is to correlate the spatial and temporal variations in the mineral content and the nanoindentation modulus of the callus formed via intramembranous ossification over the course of bone healing. Midshaft tibial samples from a sheep osteotomy model at time points of 2, 3, 6 and 9 weeks were employed. PMMA embedded blocks were used for quantitative back scattered electron imaging and nanoindentation of the newly formed periosteal callus near the cortex. The resulting indentation modulus maps show the heterogeneity in the modulus in the selected regions of the callus. The indentation modulus of the embedded callus is about 6 GPa at the early stage. At later stages of mineralization, the average indentation modulus reaches 14 GPa. There is a slight decrease in average indentation modulus in regions distant to the cortex, probably due to remodelling of the peripheral callus. The spatial and temporal distribution of mineral content in the callus tissue also illustrates the ongoing remodelling process observed from histological analysis. Most interestingly the average indentation modulus, even at 9 weeks, remains as low as 13 GPa, which is roughly 60% of that for cortical sheep bone. The decreased indentation modulus in the callus compared to cortex is due to the lower average mineral content and may be perhaps also due to the properties of the organic matrix which might be different from normal bone.",M1
19399356,"Effect of low-level laser therapy on the fracture healing process.Low-level laser therapy (LLLT) is a biophysical form of intervention in the fracture-repair process, which, through several mechanisms, accelerates the healing of fractures and enhances <e>callus</e> formation. The effect of laser on fracture healing is controversial. Some authors affirm that LLLT can accelerate bone formation by increasing osteoblastic activity. The objective of our study was to evaluate the effect of laser therapy on fracture healing. Thirty rabbits were subjected to tibial bone open osteotomies that were stabilized with external fixators. The animals were divided into two study groups: laser group and control group. Callus development and bone mineral density were quantitatively evaluated by CT; the animals were then killed and the fractures were assessed for biomechanical properties. The results demonstrated that the increasing rate of bone mineral density was higher in the laser (L) group than in the control (C) group. CT at 5 weeks revealed a mean callus density of 297 Hounsfield units (HU) for the control group and 691 HU for the L group, which was statistically significant (P = 0.001). In the L group, the mean recorded fracture tension was 190.5 N and 359.3 N for healed and intact bones, respectively, which was statistically significant (P &lt; 0.001). The result of the study showed that the use of laser could enhance callus development in the early stage of the healing process, with doubtful improvement in biomechanical properties of the healing bone; therefore, laser therapy may be recommended as an additional treatment in non-union fractures in humans.",M1
19398840,"[Bone fracture and the healing mechanisms. Fracture treatment using electrical stimulation]In 1953, Iwao Yasuda reported on the piezoelectricity of bone and the electrical stimulation of <e>callus</e> formation. Subsequently, various methods of electrical stimulation have been investigated, and the enhancement of callus formation by electrical stimulation is likely to have broad clinical applications for not only the repair of fractures, but also for nonunion and pseudoarthrosis. Recently, these outcomes have been validated by significant double blind clinical trials, and the electrical currents in bone were investigated at the molecular level. Moreover, the application of impedance measurements obtained upon electrical stimulation as a means to evaluate bone maturation was examined. This paper reports on the current methods of electrical stimulation, the fundamental effects on bone formation, and further clinical applications.",M1
19398835,"[Bone fracture and the healing mechanisms. The effects of anti-resorptive agents on fracture healing]The effects of anti-resorptive agents on fracture healing were reviewed based on the results of our studies using rats and cynomolugus monkeys. Anti-resorptive agents delay natural fracture healing process due to suppressed <e>callus</e> remodeling in response to the extent of remodeling suppression although they never interfere bone union or strength of fracture site. Bisphosphonates can increase the strength of fracture site by dramatically increasing callus volume, however they delay callus remodeling of woven bone into lamellar bone, which is structurally and mechanically superior to woven bone. This suggests that delayed natural fracture healing process caused by bisphosphonates was compensated by increased callus volume of immature bone.",M1
19382182,"Material properties are related to stress fracture <e>callus</e> and porosity of cortical bone tissue at affected and unaffected sites.Stress fractures are overuse injuries of bone that affect elite athletes and military recruits. One response of cortical bone to stress fracture is to lay down periosteal callus. The objectives of this study were to determine if material properties are different among bones with different stages of stress fracture callus, at both a callus site and at a distal site. Cortical specimens were mechanically tested to determine their stress-strain response. Material property differences were examined using nonparametric and regression analyses. At the callus site, material properties were low during the earliest stages of callus, higher with increasing callus maturity, but dropped at the late stage of callus. At the distal site, the material properties were low during early stages of callus and approached, or returned to, those of bones without callus during the late stages of callus. The effects of stress fracture and bone callus are not limited to the focal site of stress fracture.",M1

19366104,"[Effects of Swan-like Shape Memory Connector on stress shielding rate and <e>callus</e> development during experimental fracture healing process]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the stress shielding rate, ultrastructural and biomechanical property of the healing bone fixed by Swan-like Shape Memory Connector (SMC) during experimental fracture healing in rabbits. METHODS: Unilateral osteotomy of left humeral diaphysis was performed in 140 adult New Zealand rabbits. The humeral fracture was fixed with SMC in study group and 4-hole dynamic compression plate (DCP) in control group. The animals were sacrificed at the 2nd, 4th, 8th, 12th, and 16th weeks postoperatively. The humeral shafts were harvested for three-point bending tests and stress shielding rate examination. Samples from the fracture gaps were observed with scanning electron microscope. RESULTS: Within an observation period of 12 weeks after operation, the stress shielding rates were significantly lower in study group than those in control group, and the bending strength and the bending rigidity were statistically higher. It was also found that collagen fibers in callus was arranged more regulate and early mineral deposition in study group. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that SMC contributes to the proliferation and differentiation of osteoblasts, promoting the formation and calcification of bone matrix and enhancing biomechanical property of the healing bone, which might be closely correlated with a less stress shielding effect produced by SMC.",M1
19343273,"Eel calcitonin (elcatonin) suppressed <e>callus</e> remodeling but did not interfere with fracture healing in the femoral fracture model of cynomolgus monkeys.We investigated the effect of eel calcitonin (elcatonin) on the process of fracture repair in the osteotomized femur of cynomolgus monkeys, since they possess a Haversian remodeling system similar to that of humans. Alendronate was used for comparison. Twenty female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis), aged 18-22 years, were allocated into five groups: control (CNT, n = 4), low-dose elcatonin group (0.5 U/kg; ELL, n = 4), high-dose elcatonin group (5 U/kg; ELH, n = 4), low-dose alendronate group (10 microg/kg; ALL, n = 4) and high-dose alendronate group (100 microg/kg; ALH, n = 4). All animals were given subcutaneous injections twice a week for 3 weeks. Then fracture was produced surgically by transversely cutting the midshaft of the right femur and fixing with stainless steel plate. After fracture, treatments were continued until sacrifice at 26 weeks after surgery. The femora were assessed by micro CT, contact microradiograph, three-point bending mechanical test and histomorphometry. Micro CT showed that callus sizes in elcatonin-treated groups were similar to CNT, whereas alendronate-treated groups had larger calluses than those in the CNT and elcatonin-treated groups. Fracture lines almost disappeared in the CNT and elcatonin-treated groups but remained clear in the alendronate-treated groups. Total area did not differ significantly between the elcatonin-treated groups and the CNT but was significantly greater in the ALH compared to the CNT and elcatonin-treated groups, due to increased callus area in the ALH group. Callus remodeling was less suppressed in the elcatonin-treated groups than in the alendronate-treated groups when compared with callus remodeling in the CNT. Although no significant differences in structural mechanical properties such as ultimate load, stiffness and work to failure were found among all groups, ultimate stress was significantly reduced in the ALH group compared with CNT and ELL groups. In conclusion, mild suppression of callus remodeling by elcatonin did not impair overall fracture healing process. In contrast, alendronate delayed structural fracture healing process by strongly suppressing callus remodeling.",M1
19338032,"Prolyl hydroxylase inhibitors increase neoangiogenesis and <e>callus</e> formation following femur fracture in mice.Skeletal trauma and impaired skeletal healing is commonly associated with diminished vascularity. Hypoxia inducible factor alpha (HIF-1) is a key transcription factor responsible for activating angiogenic factors during development and tissue repair. Small molecule inhibitors of the prolyl hydroxylase enzyme (PHD), the key enzyme responsible for degrading HIF-1, have been shown to activate HIF-1, and are effective in inducing angiogenesis. Here we examined the effects of several commercially available PHD inhibitors on bone marrow mesenchymal stromal cells (MSCs) in vitro and in a stabilized fracture model in vivo. Three PHD inhibitors [Desferrioxamine (DFO), L-mimosine (L-mim), and Dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG)] effectively activated a HIF-1 target reporter, induced expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) mRNA in vitro, and increased capillary sprouting in a functional angiogenesis assay. DFO and DMOG were applied by direct injection at the fracture site in a stabilized murine femur fracture model. PHD inhibition increased the vascularity at 14 days and increased callus size as assessed by microCT at 28 days. These results suggest that HIF activation is a viable approach to increase vascularity and bone formation following skeletal trauma.",M1
19309060,"Augmentation of bone healing by specific frequency and amplitude compressive strains.A considerable proportion of bone fractures show signs of delayed or impaired healing. A novel device that applies interfragmentary compressive forces to the fracture site was developed and evaluated for its effect on fracture healing. The midshafts of the right tibias of 16 rabbits were osteotomized, leaving a 2-mm gap. A 4-pin, double-bar external fixator was fixed to the tibias. Interfragmental compressive displacement of 0.5 mm with a frequency of 1 Hz was applied 15 minutes per day. Mechanical stimulation began 1 week postoperatively and continued for 2 and 3 weeks. Control animals received no stimulation. <e>Callus</e> quality and area were assessed by radiographs. Maximum force and total energy absorbed up to failure of the healed bones were determined using a standard 3-point bending test. Postmortem radiographic examinations showed that mean radiographic measures in both anteroposterior and mediolateral views was significantly larger in experimental groups than controls (P=.029). Mechanical measures of the healed bones demonstrated that mean values of maximum force and absorbed energy were significantly higher in the experimental groups than in the control groups (P=.029). Both radiographic and mechanical measures were significantly higher after 3 weeks compared to 2 weeks of receiving stimulation (P&lt;.05).",M1
19308630,"P2X7 nucleotide receptor plays an important role in <e>callus</e> remodeling during fracture repair.The P2X7 nucleotide receptor (P2X7R) is an ATP-gated ion channel expressed in bone cells. Homozygous null P2X7R (P2X7R(-/-)) mice have reduced bone formation, so we hypothesized that P2X7R(-/-) mice have impaired fracture healing compared to P2X7R(+/+) control mice. To test the hypothesis, adult P2X7R(-/-) mice and P2X7R(+/+) mice were studied. Osteotomy of the right femur was performed and a stainless-steel pin was inserted into the medullary cavity to stabilize the fracture site. No differences in callus development were seen in the radiograph, micro computed tomography, or dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry measurements. Mechanical testing showed that the recovery of ultimate force, stiffness, and energy to failure were slightly decreased in P2X7R(-/-) mice compared with the control. Histomorphometric measurements of the callus revealed that mineralizing surface and bone formation were significantly decreased, by 22% (p &lt; 0.001) and 29% (p &lt; 0.05), respectively, in P2X7R(-/-) mice in comparison with the wild-type control. These data show that a null mutation of the P2X7R does not affect the amount of callus formed in our osteotomy fracture model. However, callus remodeling was significantly delayed. Our data suggest the different role of the P2X7R in woven bone and lamellar bone formation.",M1
19301255,"Secreted frizzled related protein 1 is a target to improve fracture healing.Genetic studies have identified a high bone mass of phenotype in both human and mouse when canonical Wnt signaling is increased. Secreted frizzled related protein 1 (sFRP1) is one of several Wnt antagonists and among the loss-of-function mouse models in which 32-week-old mice exhibit a high bone mass phenotype. Here we show that impact fracture healing is enhanced in this mouse model of increased Wnt signaling at a physiologic level in young (8 weeks) sFRP1(-/-) mice which do not yet exhibit significant increases in BMD. In vivo deletion of sFRP1 function improves fracture repair by promoting early bone union without adverse effects on the quality of bone tissue reflected by increased mechanical strength. We observe a dramatic reduction of the cartilage callous, increased intramembranous bone formation with bone bridging by 14 days, and early bone remodeling during the 28-day fracture repair process in the sFRP1(-/-) mice. Our molecular analyses of gene markers indicate that the effect of sFRP1 loss-of-function during fracture repair is to accelerate bone healing after formation of the initial hematoma by directing mesenchymal stem cells into the osteoblast lineage via the canonical pathway. Further evidence to support this conclusion is the observation of maximal sFRP1 levels in the cartilaginous <e>callus</e> of a WT mouse. Hence sFRP1(-/-) mouse progenitor cells are shifted directly into the osteoblast lineage. Thus, developing an antagonist to specifically inhibit sFRP1 represents a safe target for stimulating fracture repair and bone formation in metabolic bone disorders, osteoporosis and aging.",M1
19301082,"OP-1 augments glucocorticoid-inhibited fracture healing in a rat fracture model.Glucocorticoids inhibit bone remodeling and fracture healing. We sought to determine whether osteogenic protein 1 (OP-1) can overcome this inhibition in a closed fracture model in the rat. Time-released prednisolone or placebo pellets were implanted subcutaneously; closed femoral fractures were created 2 weeks later in rats. Fractures received sham, OP-1 and collagen, or collagen-only implants. Femurs were harvested at 3, 10, 21, 28, and 42 days postfracture. Fractures were examined radiographically for amount of hard <e>callus</e>; mechanically for torque and stiffness (also expressed as a percentage of the contralateral intact femur); and histomorphometrically for amount of cartilaginous and noncartilaginous soft callus, hard callus, and total callus. Glucocorticoid administration inhibited fracture healing. The application of a devitalized Type I collagen matrix mitigated the inhibitory effects of prednisolone on fracture healing However, further increases in indices of fracture healing were observed when OP-1 was added to the collagen matrix compared with collagen alone. OP-1 and collagen was more effective than collagen alone.",M1
19283438,"Quantification of fracture healing from radiographs using the maximum <e>callus</e> index.Callus formation and growth are an essential part of secondary fracture healing. Callus growth can be observed radiographically and measured using the  Callus Index,  which is defined as the maximum diameter of the callus divided by the diameter of the bone. We compared three groups of patients with tibial fractures treated by external fixation, intramedullary nailing, and casting to assess the validity of using serial measurements of callus index as a measure of fracture healing. When callus index was plotted against time for each patient, the point at which the fracture began to remodel, indicated by the highest point of the curve, was observed as a consistent feature regardless of fixation method. This occurred on average at 2(1/2) weeks after plaster cast removal (14 weeks post injury), 5 weeks after external fixator removal (22 weeks post injury), and 27 weeks post injury for the intramedullary nailed fractures. Because remodeling only occurs once the fracture is stable, a peak in callus index is a reliable sign that the fracture has united. Serial measurements of callus index would therefore appear to offer a simple method of quantifying secondary fracture healing regardless of the treatment method used.

19274756,"Differential regulation of blood vessel formation between standard and delayed bone healing.Blood vessel formation is a prerequisite for bone healing. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that a delay in bone healing is associated with an altered regulation of blood vessel formation. A tibial osteotomy was performed in two groups of sheep and stabilized with either a rigid external fixator leading to standard healing or with a highly rotationally unstable one leading to delayed healing. At days 4, 7, 9, 11, 14, 21, and 42 after surgery, total RNA was extracted from the <e>callus</e>. Gene expressions of vWF, an endothelial cell marker, and of several molecules related to blood vessel formation were studied by qPCR. Furthermore, histology was performed on fracture hematoma and callus sections. Histologically, the first blood vessels were detected at day 7 in both groups. mRNA expression levels of vWF, Ang1, Ang2, VEGF, CYR61, FGF2, MMP2, and TIMP1 were distinctly lower in the delayed compared to the standard healing group at several time points. Based on differential expression patterns, days 7 and 21 postoperatively were revealed to be essential time points for vascularization of the ovine fracture callus. This work demonstrates for the first time a differential regulation of blood vessel formation between standard and mechanically induced delayed healing in a sheep osteotomy model.",M1
19247856,"The influence of brain injury or peripheral nerve injury on calcitonin gene-related peptide concentration variation and fractures healing process.To investigate the changes of calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) in rat's blood plasma, spinal anterior motorneuron, and dorsal root ganglion (DRG) after fractures combined with central or peripheral nerve injuries and its influence on fracture healing, 72 healthy adult SD rats (male or female) were divided into 4 groups (18 rats in each group): group A, simple(left) tibial fracture; group B, left tibial fracture combined with left sciatic nerve injury; group C, left tibial fracture combined with T9-11 spinal cord transection injury; group D, left tibial fracture combined with right cerebral cortex injury. Group A was the control group. The concentration of serum CGRP was measured immediately, 1w, 2w, and 4w after injury using radio immunoassay. X-ray photograph was taken at 1w, 2w, and 4w after injury to assess fracture healing. The concentration of serum CGRP in spinal anterior motorneuron and dorsal root ganglion was measured 1w, 2w, and 4w after injury. Bony <e>callus</e> at 2w after injury using H.E.staining was observed. 1w and 2w after injury, the fracture line was still clear on the X-ray of all groups, but 4w after injury the fracture line disappeared with complete healing except the peripheral nerve injury group. By H.E. staining, we found lesser bony callus contents in the peripheral nerve injury group than the simple fracture group at 2w after injury; irregular bone trabecula and healing defect were found in the former group. While the spinal injury group and cerebral cortex injury group represented more bony callus than the simple fracture group, increased bone trabecula and regularity, medullary cavity occluded and finally solid bony connections were found. CGRP concentration in blood plasma and spinal anterior motorneuron represented no apparent differences among all groups during each observation period. For the dorsal root ganglion group, 1w after fracture, there was no apparent difference of CGRP concentration in the peripheral nerve injury group and cerebral cortex group compared with the control group (P &gt; 0.05), but the spinal injury group showed more CGRP than the control group (P &lt; 0.01). 2w after injury, the peripheral nerve injury group and cerebral cortex group also showed no difference compared with the control group, but the cerebral cortex group had more CGRP contents than the peripheral nerve injury group (P &lt; 0.05), and the spinal injury group showed more CGRP than the control group (P &lt; 0.01). 4w after injury, the peripheral nerve group, spinal injury group, and cerebral cortex injury group all showed higher concentration of CGRP than the control group. Among the 3 groups, the spinal injury group is the highest (P &lt; 0.01). When fracture combined with peripheral nerve injury, the healing process can be slowed down. In contrast, fracture combined with spinal injury and cerebral cortex injury will accelerate the healing process. The CGRP in dorsal root ganglion in spinal injury group and cerebral cortex injury group increased, which may have positive effects on fracture healing.",M1
19241330,"Equol but not genistein improves early metaphyseal fracture healing in osteoporotic rats.Healing of predominantly metaphyseal fractures in postmenopausal osteoporosis is delayed and comparatively poor. Hormone replacement therapy could improve fracture healing, but, because of its potential side effects, natural alternatives are more appealing. The aim of this study was to determine if the soy metabolite equol and the native isoflavone genistein, in comparison to 17beta-estradiol, improve metaphyseal fracture healing in ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic bone of the rat. Forty-eight 12-week-old female rats developed severe osteoporosis ten weeks after ovariectomy. After metaphyseal tibial osteotomy and standardized stable internal fixation, changes in <e>callus</e> morphology were evaluated biomechanically, qualitatively and quantitatively in fluorochrome-labeled histological sections and microradiographs in ovariectomized rats (C) and under standardized 17beta-estradiol (E), equol (EQ) and genistein (G) supplemented rats over a period of five weeks. Estrogen and equol were able to improve the elasticity of callus formation significantly in postmenopausal osteoporotic bone (stiffness of C: 121.40 +/- 47.08 N/mm, E: 147.90 +/- 39.38 N/mm, EQ: 167.8 +/- 59.90 N/mm). The effects of estrogen were more anabolic than those of equol and were visible in changes to the trabecular bone (N.Nd of E: 6.47 +/- 7.68, EQ: 4.25 +/- 3.96). However, in terms of the whole body, equol seemed to induce less of an adverse reaction than estrogen (body weight of C: 342.20 +/- 19.91 g, E: 280.25 +/- 12.05 g, EQ: 308.75 +/- 24.28 g). Genistein as an osteoclast inhibitor influenced callus stiffness (G: 144.50 +/- 61.52 N/mm) and negatively impacted trabecular structure (N.Nd of G: 0.59 +/- 1.01) in severely osteoporotic bones. Estrogen and equol were able to improve fracture healing in ovariectomy-induced osteoporotic bones, and the extent of callus formation played only a minor role. Genistein rather negatively influenced fracture healing. The metaphyseal osteotomy model in ovariectomized rats allows an accurate study of the therapeutic effects of antiosteoporotic substances on the fracture healing process.",M1

METHODS: Sixty-four patients with long-bone fractures were randomly divided into two groups, i.e. those who received autologous cultured osteoblast injection and those who received no treatment. The sum of the difference in the <e>callus</e> formation scores after four and eight weeks, was used as the first efficacy variable. RESULTS: The autologous cultured osteoblast injection group showed fracture healing acceleration of statistical significance, and there were no specific patient complications when using this treatment. CONCLUSION: Autologous cultured osteoblast injection should therefore be considered as a successful treatment option for treating long-bone fracture.",M1
19215029,"FGF23 is a putative marker for bone healing and regeneration.Besides numerous other factors, fibroblast growth factor receptor (FGFR) signaling is involved in fracture healing and bone remodeling. FGF23 is a phosphatonin produced by osteoblastic cells, which signals via FGFR1, thereby exerting effects in bone and kidney. We analyzed if serum FGF23 levels might be an indicator to predict fracture healing and union. FGF23 (C-Term) was elevated on day 3 postoperatively in 55 patients sustaining an exchange of total hip implants due to aseptic loosening. A prospective study of 40 patients undergoing primary hip arthroplasty also showed elevated FGF23 (C-Term) but no change in FGF23 (intact) levels on days 1, 4, and 10 postoperatively. Serum phosphate and phosphate clearance stayed within normal ranges. FGF23 mRNA expression in ovine <e>callus</e> was compared between a standard and delayed course of osteotomy healing. In the standard model, a marked increase in FGF23 mRNA expression compared to the delayed healing situation was observed. Immunohistochemical analysis showed FGF23 production of osteoblasts and granulation tissue in the fracture callus during bone healing. In conclusion, FGF23 is involved in bone healing, can be measured by a sensitive assay in peripheral blood, and is a promising candidate as an indicator for healing processes prone to reunion versus nonunion.",M1
19181971,"Humoral factors enhance fracture-healing and <e>callus</e> formation in patients with traumatic brain injury.BACKGROUND: Scientific evidence is mounting for an association between traumatic brain injury and enhanced osteogenesis. The aim of this study was to correlate the in vitro osteoinductive potential of serum with the features of fracture-healing and the extent of brain damage in patients with severe traumatic brain injury and bone fracture. METHODS: Patients with a long-bone fracture and a traumatic brain injury (seventeen patients) or without a brain injury (twenty-four patients) were recruited. The Glasgow Coma Scale score was determined on admission. Radiographs of the fracture were made before surgery, at six weeks, and at three, six, and twelve months after surgery. The time to union was estimated clinically and radiographically, and the callus ratio to shaft diameter was calculated. Serum samples were collected at six, twenty-four, seventy-two, and 168 hours after injury, and their osteogenic potential was determined by measurement of the in vitro proliferation rate of the human fetal osteoblastic cell line hFOB1.19. RESULTS: Patients with a traumatic brain injury had a twofold shorter time to union (p = 0.01), a 37% to 50% increased callus ratio (p &lt; 0.01), and their sera induced a higher proliferation rate in hFOB cells (p &lt; 0.05). A linear relationship was revealed between hFOB cell proliferation rates and the amount of callus formed (p &lt; 0.05). The Glasgow Coma Scale score was correlated with the callus ratio on both radiographic projections (p &lt; 0.05), time to union (p = 0.04), and the proliferation rate of hFOB cells at six hours after injury (p = 0.03). CONCLUSIONS: Patients with a severe brain injury release unknown humoral factors into the blood circulation that enhance and accelerate fracture-healing.",M1
19170096,"Recombinant human platelet-derived growth factor BB (rhPDGF-BB) and beta-tricalcium phosphate/collagen matrix enhance fracture healing in a diabetic rat model.Diabetes mellitus is a common systemic disease that has been associated with poor fracture healing outcomes. The mechanism through which diabetes impairs bone regeneration is unknown. One possible mechanism may be related to either decreased or uncoordinated release of local growth factors at the fracture site. Indeed, previous studies have found reduced platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) levels in the fracture <e>callus</e> of diabetic rats, suggesting that local application of PDGF may overcome the negative effects of diabetes and promote fracture healing. To test this hypothesis, low (22 microg) and high (75 ug) doses of recombinant human PDGF-BB (rhPDGF-BB) were applied directly to femur fracture sites in BB Wistar diabetic rats that were then compared to untreated or vehicle-treated animals. rhPDGF-BB treatment significantly increased early callus cell proliferation compared to that in control specimens. Low dose rhPDGF-BB treatment significantly increased callus peak torque values (p &lt; 0.05) at 8 weeks after fracture as compared to controls. High dose rhPDGF-BB treatment increased callus bone area at 12 weeks postfracture. These data indicate that rhPDGF-BB treatment ameliorates the effects of diabetes on fracture healing by promoting early cellular proliferation that ultimately leads to more bone formation. Local application of rhPDGF-BB may be a new therapeutic approach to treat diabetes-impaired fracture healing.",M1
19165036,"Temporomandibular joint ankylosis caused by chondroid hyperplasia from the <e>callus</e> of condylar neck fracture.A patient who complained of difficulty in opening his mouth after condylar neck fracture 1 year ago presented typical features of temporomandibular joint ankylosis in clinical and radiologic examinations. To demonstrate a possible pathogenesis of temporomandibular joint ankylosis after condylar neck fracture, the fractured condylar portion removed was examined by histologic and immunohistochemical stainings. Interpositional gap arthroplasty was performed by removing the inferomesially displaced fractured condyle, and reconstruction with subcutaneous dermis to the previous vertical height was performed immediately. The fractured condylar portion was almost intact with slight erosion of the condylar cartilage. In the hematoxylin and eosin and Masson trichrome stainings, an extensive chondroid hyperplasia with abundant hyaline cartilage was shown in the removed condylar portion. There were also hyperplastic features of the synovial membrane, which were abnormally distributed throughout the chondroid tissues. In the immunohistochemical stainings of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2 and BMP-4, the chondroid tissues were conspicuously hyperplastic and strongly positive for BMP-4 but sparse for BMP-2. From these results, we think that the hyperplastic chondroid tissue was derived from the callus of the primary fractured site of the condylar neck and propose that the chondroid tissue could proliferate continuously because of synovial tissue support from around the temporomandibular joint, resulting in temporomandibular joint ankylosis. This pathogenesis is quite different from those of other diaphyseal fracture of long bones.",M1
19138599,"Effects of calcitonin gene-related peptide on the expression and activity of nitric oxide synthase during mandibular bone healing in rabbits: an experimental study.PURPOSE: Previous studies have found that calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) takes part in the local regulation of bone growth and metabolism. However, the detailed regulatory mechanism of CGRP in the bone healing has not been explored. The objective of this study was to investigate the effects and the regulatory mechanism of CGRP on the expression and activity of nitric oxide synthase (NOS) in bony <e>callus</e> during mandibular defect healing. MATERIALS AND METHODS: To determine the effect of CGRP on bony callus, a bone defect in the left mandible was created in 48 adult rabbits (divided randomly into experimental and control group) and half of them underwent inferior alveolar nerve amputation. The bony callus were collected 4, 7, 14, and 28 days after operation, and the expressions of CGRP and NOS in the paraffin slices were analyzed with immunohistochemical staining. The activity of calcium-dependent nitric oxide synthase (cNOS) and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in the fresh specimens were measured with the NOS detecting kit. RESULTS: In the immunohistochemical analysis of bony callus, the immunohistochemical stain of CGRP was lower in experimental groups than in control groups from 4 to 14 days (P&lt; .05 or P&lt; .01), and the stain of eNOS showed the same phenomena from 4 to 7 days (P&lt; .01), but the stain of iNOS did not show any statistical difference. In the NOS activity analysis, the activity of cNOS was lower in experimental groups than in control groups from 4 to 7 days (P&lt; .05 or P&lt; .01), and the activity of iNOS was lower in experimental groups than in control groups from 7 to 14 days (P&lt; .01). CONCLUSION: The expression and activity of NOS has a positive correlation with CGRP expression during bone healing. CGRP may promote fracture healing via regulating the expression and the activity of NOS.",M1

Radiographic evidence of bone healing was monitored for 14 weeks. RESULTS: Substantial bony <e>callus</e> was evident at 4 weeks and at 8 weeks there was bridging callus with obvious bony remodeling. The fixation was destabilized at 9 weeks by IM pin removal, bone healing progressed and the fixator was removed at 11 weeks. By 14 weeks both cortices had been re-established with continued callus remodeling evident. CONCLUSION: rhBMP-2, applied in a CPM paste, was used as a bone graft substitute in the treatment of a comminuted, open humeral fracture in a whooping crane. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Use of rhBMP-2/CPM should be considered in treatment of avian fractures.",M1
19098554,"Efficacy of distraction osteogenesis for mandibular reconstruction in previously irradiated areas: clinical experiences.The efficacy of distraction osteogenesis in an irradiated area is controversial, although this procedure is now widely used in the field of craniomaxillofacial surgery. We report the clinical results from 4 patients with mandibular defects treated by lengthening of the irradiated mandibles. All patients had a mandibular defect caused by ablation of a malignant tumor. They had undergone radiotherapy at a total dose of 30 to 50 Gy to the surgical site after tumorectomy. Distraction osteogenesis was used as the secondary reconstruction method in 6 sites of the remaining irradiated mandibles and in 1 site of the transferred vascularized scapula after radiotherapy. The transported segment was obtained by corticotomy with an initial gap of 0 to 2 mm, and internal extension plates were used. Distraction was commenced after a latency period of 7 to 10 days and performed at the rate of 0.25 to 1.0 mm/d. The total amount of distraction and consolidation periods ranged from 15 to 25 mm and 120 to 193 days, respectively. In 5 of the 6 sites in the remaining irradiated mandibles, satisfactory bone formation in the distraction gap was observed, although a fracture after new bone formation was observed in 1 site. Fibrous <e>callus</e> formation was observed in 1 irradiated site only, and satisfactory results were obtained in another site of transferred vascularized scapula in the same patient. From these experiences, we believe that distraction may provide a reconstruction option for mandibular defects even under irradiated conditions because the procedure is simple and less invasive.",M1
19016594,"Comparison of effects of the bisphosphonate alendronate versus the RANKL inhibitor denosumab on murine fracture healing.The role of osteoclast-mediated resorption during fracture healing was assessed. The impact of two osteoclast inhibitors with different mechanisms of action, alendronate (ALN) and denosumab (DMAB), were examined during fracture healing. Male human RANKL knock-in mice that express a chimeric (human/murine) form of RANKL received unilateral transverse femur fractures. Mice were treated biweekly with ALN 0.1 mg/kg, DMAB 10 mg/kg, or PBS (control) 0.1 ml until death at 21 and 42 days after fracture. Treatment efficacy assessed by serum levels of TRACP 5b showed almost a complete elimination of TRACP 5b levels in the DMAB-treated animals but only approximately 25% reduction of serum levels in the ALN-treated mice. Mechanical testing showed that fractured femurs from both ALN and DMAB groups had significantly increased mechanical properties at day 42 compared with controls. muCT analysis showed that <e>callus</e> tissues from DMAB-treated mice had significantly greater percent bone volume and BMD than did both control and ALN-treated tissues at both 21 and 42 days, whereas ALN-treated bones only had greater percent bone volume and BMC than control at 42 days. Qualitative histological analysis showed that the 21-and 42-day ALN and DMAB groups had greater amounts of unresorbed cartilage or mineralized cartilage matrix compared with the controls, whereas unresorbed cartilage could still be seen in the DMAB groups at 42 days after fracture. Although ALN and DMAB delayed the removal of cartilage and the remodeling of the fracture callus, this did not diminish the mechanical integrity of the healing fractures in mice receiving these treatments. In contrast, strength and stiffness were enhanced in these treatment groups compared with control bones.",M1
19013264,"Micro-computed tomography assessment of fracture healing: relationships among <e>callus</e> structure, composition, and mechanical function.Non-invasive characterization of fracture callus structure and composition may facilitate development of surrogate measures of the regain of mechanical function. As such, quantitative computed tomography- (CT-) based analyses of fracture calluses could enable more reliable clinical assessments of bone healing. Although previous studies have used CT to quantify and predict fracture healing, it is unclear which of the many CT-derived metrics of callus structure and composition are the most predictive of callus mechanical properties. The goal of this study was to identify the changes in fracture callus structure and composition that occur over time and that are most closely related to the regain of mechanical function. Micro-computed tomography (microCT) imaging and torsion testing were performed on murine fracture calluses (n=188) at multiple post-fracture timepoints and under different experimental conditions that alter fracture healing. Total callus volume (TV), mineralized callus volume (BV), callus mineralized volume fraction (BV/TV), bone mineral content (BMC), tissue mineral density (TMD), standard deviation of mineral density (sigma(TMD)), effective polar moment of inertia (J(eff)), torsional strength, and torsional rigidity were quantified. Multivariate statistical analyses, including multivariate analysis of variance, principal components analysis, and stepwise regression were used to identify differences in callus structure and composition among experimental groups and to determine which of the microCT outcome measures were the strongest predictors of mechanical properties. Although calluses varied greatly in the absolute and relative amounts of mineralized tissue (BV, BMC, and BV/TV), differences among timepoints were most strongly associated with changes in tissue mineral density. Torsional strength and rigidity were dependent on mineral density as well as the amount of mineralized tissue: TMD, BV, and sigma(TMD) explained 62% of the variation in torsional strength (p&lt;0.001); and TMD, BMC, BV/TV, and sigma(TMD) explained 70% of the variation in torsional rigidity (p&lt;0.001). These results indicate that fracture callus mechanical properties can be predicted by several microCT-derived measures of callus structure and composition. These findings form the basis for developing non-invasive assessments of fracture healing and for identifying biological and biomechanical mechanisms that lead to impaired or enhanced healing.",M1
19010456,"Diabetes causes the accelerated loss of cartilage during fracture repair which is reversed by insulin treatment.Fracture healing in diabetic individuals and in animal models of diabetes is impaired. To investigate mechanisms by which diabetes may affect fracture healing we focused on the transition from cartilage to bone, a midpoint in the fracture healing process. Femoral fractures were induced in mice rendered diabetic by multiple low dose streptozotocin treatment and compared to matching normoglycemic mice. One group of diabetic animals was treated with slow release insulin to maintain normal serum glucose levels. The results indicate that there was relatively little difference in the initial formation of the fracture <e>callus</e> on day 10. However, on day 16 the diabetic group had significantly smaller callus, greater loss of cartilage and enhanced osteoclastogenesis that was normalized by treatment with insulin when assessed by histomorphometric analysis. Chondrocyte apoptosis was significantly higher in diabetic mice and this increase was blocked by insulin. These changes were accompanied by diabetes-increased mRNA levels of RANKL, TNF-alpha, and ADAMTS-4 and -5 measured by real-time PCR, which was reversed by insulin treatment. On days 16 and 22 bone formation within the callus of diabetic mice was significantly less than the normoglycemic and brought to normal levels by insulin treatment. These results suggest that a significant effect of diabetes on fracture healing is increased chondrocyte apoptosis and osteoclastogenesis that accelerates the loss of cartilage and reduces the anlage for endochondral bone formation during fracture repair. That insulin reverses these effects demonstrates that they are directly related to the diabetic condition.",M1
19000372,"Elevated leptin expression in a rat model of fracture and traumatic brain injury.A few studies have reported a relationship between leptin induced by brain injury and healing of bone tissue. Our objective was to measure serum and <e>callus</e> leptin expression within the setting of fracture and traumatic brain injury (TBI). Sixty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were randomised equally into four groups: control, TBI group, fracture group and fracture/TBI group. Rats were sacrificed at 2, 4, 8 and 12 weeks after fracture/TBI. Serum leptin was detected using radioimmunoassay, and callus formation was measured radiologically. Callus leptin was analysed with immunohistochemistry. Serum leptin was significantly increased in the fracture, TBI and combined fracture/TBI groups compared with the control group at 2 weeks (P &lt; 0.05). Serum leptin was significantly higher in the combined fracture/TBI group than in the fracture and TBI groups at 4 and 8 weeks (P &lt; 0.05). The percentage of leptin-positive cells in the callus and callus volume were significantly higher in the fracture/TBI group than in the fracture-only group (P &lt; 0.001). Thus, we demonstrated elevated leptin expression within healing bone, particularly in the first 8 weeks of a rat model combining fracture and TBI. A close association exists between leptin levels and the degree of callus formation in fractures.",M1
18988260,"Long-term effects of saw osteotomy versus random fracturing on bone healing and remodeling in a sheep tibia model.This article is about the evaluation of possible differences in biomechanical or histomorphological properties of bone healing between saw osteotomy and random fracturing after 6 months. A standardized, 30 degrees oblique monocortical saw osteotomy of sheep tibia was carried out, followed by manual fracture completion of the opposed cortical bone. Fixation was performed by bridge plating (4.5 mm, LCDCP, broad). X-rays were taken immediately after surgery and at the end of the study. Polychrome fluorescent staining was performed according to a standardized protocol in the 2nd, 4th 6th, 10th, 14th, 18th, 22th and 26th week. Ten sheep were comprehensively evaluated. Data for stiffness and histomorphology are reported. The average bending stiffness of the operated bone was higher (1.7 (SD 0.3) with plate (MP) vs. 1.5 without plate) than for the intact bone (1.4 (SD 0.2), though no significant differences in bending stiffness were observed (P&gt;0.05). Fluorescence staining revealed small numbers of blood vessels and less fragment resorption and remodeling in the osteotomy gap. Bone healing after saw osteotomy shows a very close resemblance to 'normal' fracture healing. However, vascular density, fragment resorption, fragment remodeling, and <e>callus</e> remodeling are reduced at the osteotomy.",M1
18985689,"Remodeling of fracture <e>callus</e> in mice is consistent with mechanical loading and bone remodeling theory.During the remodeling phase of fracture healing in mice, the callus gradually transforms into a double cortex, which thereafter merges into one cortex. In large animals, a double cortex normally does not form. We investigated whether these patterns of remodeling of the fracture callus in mice can be explained by mechanical loading. Morphologies of fractures after 21, 28, and 42 days of healing were determined from an in vivo mid-diaphyseal femoral osteotomy healing experiment in mice. Bone density distributions from microCT at 21 days were converted into adaptive finite element models. To assess the effect of loading mode on bone remodeling, a well-established remodeling algorithm was used to examine the effect of axial force or bending moment on bone structure. All simulations predicted that under axial loading, the callus remodeled to form a single cortex. When a bending moment was applied, dual concentric cortices developed in all simulations, corresponding well to the progression of remodeling observed experimentally and resulting in quantitatively comparable callus areas of woven and lamellar bone. Effects of biological differences between species or other reasons cannot be excluded, but this study demonstrates how a difference in loading mode could explain the differences between the remodeling phase in small rodents and larger mammals.",M1
18979884,"[Effect of brain injury on expression of PDGF in fracture healing process in rats]OBJECTIVE: To investigate the changes in the expression level of PDGF in the bone <e>callus</e> rats with femoral fracture and brain injury to explore the effect of brain injury on the fracture healing and the related mechanism. METHODS: Sixty-four 12-week-old SD rats weighing (356 +/- 25) g were randomly divided into 8 groups with 8 rats in each. The rats in groups A1, B1, C1 and D1 had a femoral fracture and a brain injury for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks, respectively; the rats in groups A2, B2, C2 and D2 had a mere fracture without a brain injury for 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks, respectively. After the CR films were taken, the bone callus was obtained 1, 2, 3 and 4 weeks after operation, respectively. Then, the bone callus and its histology were examined by HE staining, the expressions and changes in the level of PDGF were examined by the immunohistochemical staining, and the level of PDGF mRNA was measured by in situ hybridization. RESULTS: The CR films showed that the callus formation in the A1-D1 groups was earlier and greater than that in the A2-D2 groups at the same time point. The HE staining indicated that more fibroblasts and early-stage chondrocytes were found in group A1; some fibroblasts in the fracture interspace and few early-stage chondrocytes were found in group A2; some newly-formed trabecular bones were found at the end of the fracture in group B1; but no trabecular bone formation was found in group B2; woven bone formation and a few chondrocytes between trabecular bones in the fracture interspace were found in group C1; only a few trabecular bones in the fracture interspace were found in group C2; woven bones turned to lamellar bones in group D1; and more immature trabecular bones in the fracture interspace were found in group D2. The positive expression of PDGF and PDGF mRNA was strong in the cytoplasms of fibroblasts, mesenchymal cells, vascular endothelial cells, early-stage chondrocytes, osteoblasts and osteoclasts. The percentage of the positive cells for PDGF and PDGF mRNA in the callus was significantly higher in groups A1-D1 than in groups A2-D2 at the same time point (P &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: Brain injury can promote the fracture healing process, which is probably related to an increase in the expression level of PDGF after the brain injury.",M1
18924140,"Low-magnitude high-frequency vibration accelerates <e>callus</e> formation, mineralization, and fracture healing in rats.Fracture healing is a biological regenerative process that follows a well-orchestrated sequence. Most healing is uneventful and enhancement of normal fracture healing is not commonly done, although it is clinically important in the recovery and regain of functions after fracture. This study investigated the osteogenic effect of low-magnitude high-frequency vibration (LMHFV, 35 Hz, 0.3 g) on the enhancement of fracture healing in rats with closed femoral shaft fracture by comparing with sham-treated control. Assessments with plain radiography, micro-CT as well as histomorphometry showed that the amount of callus was significantly larger (p = 0.001 for callus area, 2 weeks posttreatment); the remodeling of the callus into mature bone was significantly faster (p = 0.039, 4 weeks posttreatment) in the treatment group. The mechanical strength of the healed fracture in the treatment group at 4 weeks was significantly greater (p &lt; 0.001). The results showed the acceleration of callus formation, mineralization, and fracture healing in the treatment group. It is concluded that LMHFV enhances healing in the closed femoral shaft fracture in rats. The potential clinical advantages shall be confirmed in the subsequent clinical trials.",M1
18923832,"Leg lengthening by distraction osteogenesis using the Ilizarov apparatus: a novel concept of tibia <e>callus</e> subsidence and its influencing factors.This article studies the incidence and magnitude of delayed callus subsidence, which will also help in study the hypothesis of three cortex corticalisation to determine the time of fixator removal during distraction osteogenesis (DO). Eighty-one tibia segments with mean lengthening of 7.7 +/- 2.9 cm were studied with age, gender, skeletal maturity, amount and percentage of lengthening, callus pattern, callus shape, number of cortices seen at the time of fixator removal, bone mineral density (BMD) ratio, and callus diameter ratio analysed for their effect on callus subsidence. All segments had tibia callus subsidence ranging from 4 mm to 3.2 cm with 54% having significant subsidence of more than 1 cm. Multivariate regression analysis revealed only the amount of lengthening and callus patterns to be significant. In conclusion, we can say that tibia callus subsidence is a significant delayed complication and factors affecting it can be used to determine the time of fixator removal.",M1
18852073,"Myostatin (GDF-8) deficiency increases fracture <e>callus</e> size, Sox-5 expression, and callus bone volume.Myostatin (GDF-8) is a negative regulator of skeletal muscle growth and mice lacking myostatin show increased muscle mass. We have previously shown that myostatin deficiency increases bone strength and biomineralization throughout the skeleton, and others have demonstrated that myostatin is expressed during the earliest phase of fracture repair. In order to determine the role of myostatin in fracture callus morphogenesis, we studied fracture healing in mice lacking myostatin. Adult wild-type mice (+/+), mice heterozygous for the myostatin mutation (+/-), and mice homozygous for the disrupted myostatin sequence (-/-) were included for study at two and four weeks following osteotomy of the fibula. Expression of Sox-5 and BMP-2 were significantly upregulated in the fracture callus of myostatin-deficient (-/-) mice compared to wild-type (+/+) mice at two weeks following osteotomy. Fracture callus size was significantly increased in mice lacking myostatin at both two and four weeks following osteotomy, and total osseous tissue area and callus strength in three-point bending were significantly greater in myostatin -/- mice compared to myostatin +/+ mice at four weeks post-osteotomy. Our data suggest that myostatin functions to regulate fracture callus size by inhibiting the recruitment and proliferation of progenitor cells in the fracture blastema. Myostatin deficiency increases blastema size during the early inflammatory phase of fracture repair, ultimately producing an ossified callus having greater bone volume and greater callus strength. While myostatin is most well known for its effects on muscle development, it is also clear that myostatin plays a significant, direct role in bone formation and regeneration.",M1
18849800,"Bacteriology of <e>callus</e> of closed fractures of tibia and femur.BACKGROUND: More than 1% of closed fractures of lower limbs and 6% of orthopedic implants are complicated by inflammation caused by infection despite of all precautionary methods taken. The question arises whether this clinical complication is not caused by bacteria dwelling in limb tissues. METHODS: Skin, subcutaneous fat, muscle, and fracture gap callus were obtained from 71 adult patients operated on due to closed fractures of tibia or femur; 28 because of comminuted fractures and mal-alignment of bone axis with nonoperative means, and 43 due to delayed healing and unstable union. RESULTS: Aerobic bacteria were isolated from gap callus of 14% healing and 35% nonhealing fractures. No isolates were found in subcutis and only in 3% in muscles. No anaerobic bacteria were detected. Polymerase chain reaction amplifications of 16S rRNA were found positive in 42% of callus specimens proving presence of bacterial DNA even when no isolates were found. The 95% similarity of the genetic pattern of some strains from foot skin and callus, estimated with random amplification of polymorphic DNA technique, suggested their foot skin origin. CONCLUSIONS: The colonizing bacterial cells and their DNA were detected in fracture callus but not in other deep tissues. Contamination was precluded by lack of isolates in disinfected cutis, subcutis, muscles, and materials used for sampling cultured after surgery. We suggest that certain strains of bacteria dwell in normal tissues of lower limbs and may cause inflammation upon stimulation by trauma. Their source may be tissue fluid, superficial and deep lymphatics, and lymph serving the physiologic transport to the regional lymph nodes of microorganisms penetrating foot skin during microinjuries.",M1
18847332,"Reduced COX-2 expression in aged mice is associated with impaired fracture healing.The cellular and molecular events responsible for reduced fracture healing with aging are unknown. Cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), the inducible regulator of prostaglandin E(2) (PGE(2)) synthesis, is critical for normal bone repair. A femoral fracture repair model was used in mice at either 7-9 or 52-56 wk of age, and healing was evaluated by imaging, histology, and gene expression studies. Aging was associated with a decreased rate of chondrogenesis, decreased bone formation, reduced <e>callus</e> vascularization, delayed remodeling, and altered expression of genes involved in repair and remodeling. COX-2 expression in young mice peaked at 5 days, coinciding with the transition of mesenchymal progenitors to cartilage and the onset of expression of early cartilage markers. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed that COX-2 is expressed primarily in early cartilage precursors that co-express col-2. COX-2 expression was reduced by 75% and 65% in fractures from aged mice compared with young mice on days 5 and 7, respectively. Local administration of an EP4 agonist to the fracture repair site in aged mice enhanced the rate of chondrogenesis and bone formation to levels observed in young mice, suggesting that the expression of COX-2 during the early inflammatory phase of repair regulates critical subsequent events including chondrogenesis, bone formation, and remodeling. The findings suggest that COX-2/EP4 agonists may compensate for deficient molecular signals that result in the reduced fracture healing associated with aging.",M1

18804576,"OP-1 application in bone allograft integration: preliminary results in sheep experimental surgery. Massive bone allografts are frequently used in orthopaedic reconstructive surgery. However the failure rate at long term follow-up is around 25%. AIM: Stimulation of allograft incorporation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In order to stimulate bone remodeling of an allograft we applied recombinant human osteogenic protein-1 (rh-OP-1, also know as bone morphogenetic protein-7, BMP-7) to a long bone critical size defect sheep model. In nine sheep we created a 3 cm osteoperiosteal metatarsal defect replaced with a structural allograft alone (control group, 4 animals), or an allograft added with rh-BMP-7 (BMP group, 5 animals). Radiographic, mechanical, histological and histomorphometric analysis were performed. RESULTS: X-rays in the BMP group showed a better and faster <e>callus</e> formation, compared to the control group within the first 8 weeks after surgery. After 16 weeks there was a higher evidence of bone remodeling in the BMP group. Radiographic healing at junction sites was more evident in the BMP group at 4, 8 and 16 weeks. Mechanical testing on screw extraction showed no statistical differences between the two groups and histomorphometry showed no difference in terms of newly formed bone inside the allograft as well. The resorption rate of the graft was higher in the BMP group in comparison to the control group. The penetration of newly formed vessels was significantly higher in the BMP group. CONCLUSIONS: These findings indicate that BMP-7 added to a structural bone allograft inducing early remodeling of the graft through stimulation of neo-angiogenesis and osteoclastic activity, without negative effects in mechanical strength and clinical outcome.",M1
18793763,"Altered fracture <e>callus</e> formation in chondromodulin-I deficient mice.Chondromodulin-I (Chm-I) is a glycoprotein that stimulates the growth of chondrocytes and inhibits angiogenesis in vitro. Mice lacking the Chm1 gene show abnormal bone metabolism and pathological angiogenesis in cardiac valves in the mature stage although they develop normally without aberrations in endochondral bone formation during embryogenesis or in cartilage development during growth. These findings indicate that Chm-I is critical under conditions of stress such as bone repair through endochondral ossification of a fracture callus. We carried out the present study to examine the expression and role of Chm-I in bone repair using a stabilized tibial fracture model, and compared fracture healing in Chm1 knockout (Chm1(-/-)) mice with that in wild-type mice. Chm-I mRNA and protein localized in the external cartilaginous callus in the reparative phase of fracture healing. Radiological examination showed a delayed union in Chm1(-/-) mice although the fracture site was covered with both external and internal calluses. Chm1 null mutation reduced external cartilaginous callus formation as judged by marked decrease of type X collagen alpha 1 (Col10a1) expression and the total amount of cartilage matrix. Interestingly, the majority of chondrocytes in the periosteal callus failed to differentiate into mature chondrocytes in Chm1(-/-) mice, while the hypertrophic maturation of chondrocytes between the cortices was not affected. These results suggest that Chm-I is involved in hypertrophic maturation of periosteal chondrocytes. Although a direct effect of Chm-I on bones is still unclear, bony callus formation was increased while external cartilaginous callus decreased in Chm1(-/-) mice. We conclude that in the absence of Chm1, predominant primary bone healing occurs due to an indirect effect induced by reduction of cartilaginous callus rather than to a direct effect on osteogenic function, resulting in a delayed union.",M1
18789890,"Gain-of-function mutation of FGFR3 results in impaired fracture healing due to inhibition of chondrocyte differentiation.Fracture healing is a complicated regeneration process which to some extent recapitulates bone development. Fibroblast growth factor receptor 3 (FGFR3) has a negative regulatory effect on endochondral ossification, and FGFR3 is also expressed in prehypertrophic and hypertrophic chondrocytes during fracture healing. However, the actual role of FGFR3 during bone regeneration is not fully understood. Therefore we investigated the role of FGFR3 in fracture repair using a non-stabilized fracture model. Fracture repair in gain-of-function mutation of FGFR3 (Fgfr3(G369C/+)) mice was delayed, with more cartilage <e>callus</e> on day 14 and residue of cartilage in the callus on day 21. Histologic, in-situ hybridization and qRT-PCR analysis showed that differentiation of mesenchymal cells into chondrocytes and hypertrophic differentiation was delayed in Fgfr3(G369C/+) mice during fracture healing. These results indicated that activating mutation of FGFR3 could lead to impaired bone repair due to inhibition of chondrocyte differentiation.",M1
18752292,"Acceleration of spinal fusion using syngeneic and allogeneic adult adipose derived stem cells in a rat model.Posterolateral spinal fusion is the standard treatment for lumbar compression fractures. Adult adipose tissue-derived stem cells (ASCs) promote osteogenesis in vivo and in vitro. The hypothesis tested in this study was that syngeneic and allogeneic ASCs on a biomaterial scaffold composed of tricalcium phosphate and collagen I will accelerate spinal fusion in a rat model. ASCs from male Fischer or ACI rats were loaded onto scaffolds (53,571 cells/mm(3)) and cultured in stromal media for 48 h. Male Fisher rats were assigned to 4 cohorts (n = 14/cohort) after bilateral decortication of the L4 and L5 transverse processes: (1) No treatment; (2) scaffold only; (3) scaffold + syngeneic ASCs; or (4) scaffold + allogeneic ASCs. Half of each cohort was harvested 4 or 8 weeks after surgery. Spinal fusion was evaluated with radiographs, microcomputed tomography, and light microscopy. <e>Callus</e> did not form in spines without scaffolds. There were no significant differences in callus formation among scaffold cohorts 4 weeks after surgery. Callus formation was more mature in both ASC cohorts versus scaffold alone 8 weeks after surgery based on microstructure as well as radiographic and microcomputed tomographic evidence of active bone formation. Inflammatory cell infiltrate was significantly lower in both ASC cohorts (syngeneic = 18.3 +/- 0.85%; allogeneic = 23.5 +/- 2.33%) versus scaffold alone (46.8 +/- 11.8%) 4 weeks after surgery. Results of this study support syngeneic and allogeneic ASC acceleration of posterior lumbar spinal fusion in a rat model.",M1
18725334,"Molecular basis for affected cartilage formation and bone union in fracture healing of the streptozotocin-induced diabetic rat.Most studies have focused on the association between diabetes mellitus (DM) and impaired osseous healing, but there is also evidence that diabetes impairs cartilage formation during fracture healing. To investigate the molecular mechanisms by which diabetes affects endochondral ossification, experiments were performed in a model of rat closed fracture healing complicated with diabetes. Diabetic rats were created by a single intravenous injection of streptozotocin (STZ), while controls were treated with vehicle alone. Fractures were made 2 weeks after STZ injection. Animals were killed at 4, 7, 10, 14, 21, 28 and 42 days following fracture, and samples were subject to radiographic, histological and molecular analyses. In the DM group, a significantly smaller cartilaginous <e>callus</e> was formed compared with controls throughout healing, with the cartilage area being reduced rapidly after day 14. When the bone union rate was evaluated radiographically on day 28, DM calluses exhibited a lower rate than controls. However, when evaluated on day 42, both groups showed an equivalent union rate. Cellular proliferation of chondroprogenitor cells and proliferating chondrocytes in soft calluses of the DM group was significantly reduced during early stages of healing (days 4 and 7), but no longer reduced thereafter. Moreover, expression levels of collagen type II, type X and osteopontin (OPN) were constantly low in the DM group. These results show the molecular basis for diminished cartilage formation and delayed union in fracture healing of the STZ-induced diabetic rats.",M1
18724139,"Role of platelet-rich plasma in acceleration of bone fracture healing.Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is a common therapy for acceleration of maxillofacial and spinal fusion bone-graft healing. This study analyzes the therapeutic role of PRP during long-bone fracture healing evaluated Lewis rats. Following creation of unilateral open femur fractures, either 500 microL thrombin-activated PRP (PRP treated group) or 500 microL saline (control group) were applied once to the fracture site. Fracture healing was analyzed after 1 and 4 weeks. Following 4 weeks of fracture healing, radiographic analysis demonstrated higher <e>callus</e> to cortex width ratio (P &lt; 0.05) in the PRP group (PRP: 1.65 +/- 0.06; control: 1.48 +/- 0.05). Three-point load bearing showed increased bone strength following PRP treatment (PRP: 60.85 +/- 6.06 Newton, control: 47.66 +/- 5.49 Newton). Fracture histology showed enhanced bone formation in the PRP group. Immunohistochemistry and Western-blotting demonstrated healing-associated changes in transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1 and bone morphogenetic protein (BMP)-2. Our results suggest that PRP accelerates bone fracture healing of rat femurs via modulation of TGF-beta1 and BMP-2 growth factor expression.",M1
18708175,"Bax deficiency in mice increases cartilage production during fracture repair through a mechanism involving increased chondrocyte proliferation without changes in apoptosis.This study sought to determine the role of the pro-apoptotic gene, Bax, in fracture healing by comparing femoral fracture healing in Bax knockout (KO) and wild-type C57BL/6J (background strain) mice. Bax KO fractures were larger, had more bone mineral content, had approximately 2-fold larger cartilage area per <e>callus</e> area in the first and second weeks of fracture healing, and showed an increased osteoclast surface area in the third and fourth weeks of fracture healing compared to C57BL/6J fractures. The increased cartilage area in the Bax KO fracture callus was due to increases in number of both pre-hypertropic and hypertropic chondrocytes. TUNEL analysis showed no significant differences in the number of either chondrocyte or non-chondrocyte apoptotic cells between Bax KO and C57BL/6J fractures at 7 or 14 days post-fracture, indicating that the increased number of chondrocytes in Bax KO fractures was not due to reduced apoptosis. Analysis of expression of apoptotic genes revealed that although the expression levels of Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL were not different between the Bax KO and C57BL/6J mice at 7 or 14 days post-fracture, the expression of BH3-domain only Bak and  Bik-like  pro-apoptotic gene increased approximately 1.5-fold and approximately 2-fold, respectively, in Bax KO fractures at 7 and 14 days post-fracture, compared to C57BL/6J fractures, suggesting that up-regulation of the Bak and Bik-like pro-apoptotic genes in Bax KO mice might compensate for the lack of Bax functions in the context of apoptosis. Analysis by in vivo incorporation of bromodeoxyuridine into chondrocytes within the fracture tissues indicated a highly significant increase in chondrocyte proliferation in Bax KO fractures compared to C57BL/6J fractures at day 7. The increased expression of collagen 2alpha1 and 9alpha1 gene in Bax KO fractures during early healing was consistent with an increased chondrocyte proliferation. In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that Bax has an important role in the early stage of fracture healing, and that the increased callus size and cartilage area in Bax KO fractures was due to increased chondrocyte proliferation and not to reduced apoptosis or increased chondrocyte hypertrophy. The unexpected effect of Bax deficiency on chondrocyte proliferation implicates a novel regulatory function for Bax on chondrocyte proliferation during fracture repair.",M1
18704847,"[Biochemical control of <e>callus</e> maturation--an experimental animal study]AIM OF THE STUDY: The purpose of this study was to verify the possibility of monitoring the callus maturation biochemically. METHOD: In an experimental study on sheep, animals with bone fractures with a length 5 cm each were divided into group A (with concomitant damage of the soft tissue) and group B (without soft tissue damage). During callus traction and maturation, biochemical parameters (osteocalcin, AlP, NTx, calcium, phosphate) were measured. Animals of each group (A+B) were euthanised at fixed points in time (according to protocol) and the callus was prepared histologically. RESULTS: Total AlP and NTx values were initially reduced during the callus traction and maturation, but increased significantly at the time of Docking+1 transportation time. At the same time, the histological evaluation showed a definite increase of the bone stabilisation, which approximately resembles the structure of a healthy bone as reference. CONCLUSION: With the combination of the AlP and NTx values already determined in the daily clinical routine the monitoring of callus maturation in animal studies becomes possible.",M1
18694917,"Treatment of distal radius fractures with a wrist-bridging external fixation: the value of alternating electric current stimulation.The radiological and functional outcomes of two groups of comminuted intraarticular fractures of the distal radius that were treated with wrist-bridging external fixation, with or without an alternating electric current stimulation (EF + ES or EF group, respectively), were compared. The radial length, radial inclination and palmar tilt were measured on radiographs taken immediately after removal of wrist external fixator and also after bone union had occurred. Furthermore, active range of motion was compared at the final consultation. Bridging <e>callus</e> was observed earlier postoperatively in the EF + ES group than in the EF group. The radial length and palmar tilt were significantly larger, and the loss of radial length and radial inclination significantly smaller, in the EF + ES group. We believe that callus maturation is enhanced by alternating electric current stimulation, which enables the early removal of external fixator.",M1
18692584,"Bone remodeling during fracture repair: The cellular picture.Fracture healing is a complex event that involves the coordination of a variety of different processes. Repair is typically characterized by four overlapping stages: the initial inflammatory response, soft <e>callus</e> formation, hard callus formation, initial bony union and bone remodeling. However, repair can also be seen to represent a juxtaposition of two distinct forces: anabolism or tissue formation, and catabolism or remodeling. These anabolic/catabolic concepts are useful for understanding bone repair without giving the false impression of temporally distinct stages that operate independently. They are also relevant when considering intervention. In normal bone development, bone remodeling conventionally refers to the removal of calcified bone tissue by osteoclasts. However, in the context of bone repair there are two phases of tissue catabolism: the removal of the initial cartilaginous soft callus, followed by the eventual remodeling of the bony hard callus. In this review, we have attempted to examine catabolism/remodeling in fractures in a systematic fashion. The first section briefly summarizes the traditional four-stage view of fracture repair in a physiological manner. The second section highlights some of the limitations of using a temporal rather than process-driven model and summarizes the anabolic/catabolic paradigm of fracture repair. The third section examines the cellular participants in soft callus remodeling and in particular the role of the osteoclast in endochondral ossification. Finally, the fourth section examines the effects of delaying osteoclast-dependent hard callus remodeling and also poses questions regarding the crosstalk between anabolism and catabolism in the latter stages of fracture repair.",M1
18663547,"Osteogenic protein-1 overcomes inhibition of fracture healing in the diabetic rat: a pilot study.Type I diabetes mellitus inhibits fracture healing and leads to an increase in complications. As a pilot study, we used a closed fracture model in the diabetic rat to address the question of whether osteogenic protein-1 (OP-1) in a collagen carrier can overcome this inhibition by increasing the area of the newly mineralized <e>callus</e> and femoral torque to failure compared with diabetic animals with fractures treated without OP-1. Diabetes was created in 54 rats by injection of streptozotocin. After 2 weeks, a closed femur fracture was created using a drop-weight impaction device. Each fracture site was immediately opened and treated with or without 25 microg OP-1 in a collagen carrier. Animals were euthanized after 2 or 4 weeks. Fracture healing was assessed by callus area from high-resolution radiographs, callus strength from torsional failure testing, and undecalcified histologic analysis. The area of newly mineralized callus was greater in diabetic animals treated with 25 microg OP-1/carrier compared with diabetic animals with untreated fractures and with fractures treated with carrier alone. This increase in callus area did not translate into an equivalent increase in torque to failure. Osteogenic protein-1 showed some evidence of overcoming the inhibition of fracture healing in the diabetic rat.",M1
18634913,"Pressure, oxygen tension and temperature in the periosteal <e>callus</e> during bone healing--an in vivo study in sheep.Adequate blood supply and sufficient mechanical stability are necessary for timely fracture healing. Damage to vessels impairs blood supply; hindering the transport of oxygen which is an essential metabolite for cells involved in repair. The degree of mechanical stability determines the mechanical conditions in the healing tissues. The mechanical conditions can influence tissue differentiation and may also inhibit revascularization. Knowledge of the actual conditions in a healing fracture in vivo is extremely limited. This study aimed to quantify the pressure, oxygen tension and temperature in the external callus during the early phase of bone healing. Six Merino-mix sheep underwent a tibial osteotomy. The tibia was stabilized with a standard mono-lateral external fixator. A multi-parameter catheter was placed adjacent to the osteotomy gap on the medial aspect of the tibia. Measurements of oxygen tension and temperature were performed for ten days post-op. Measurements of pressure were performed during gait on days three and seven. The ground reaction force and the interfragmentary movements were measured simultaneously. The maximum pressure during gait increased (p=0.028) from three (41.3 [29.2-44.1] mm Hg) to seven days (71.8 [61.8-84.8] mm Hg). During the same interval, there was no change (p=0.92) in the peak ground reaction force or in the interfragmentary movement (compression: p=0.59 and axial rotation: p=0.11). Oxygen tension in the haematoma (74.1 mm Hg [68.6-78.5]) was initially high post-op and decreased steadily over the first five days. The temperature increased over the first four days before reaching a plateau at approximately 38.5 degrees C on day four. This study is the first to report pressure, oxygen tension and temperature in the early callus tissues. The magnitude of pressure increased even though weight bearing and IFM remained unchanged. Oxygen tensions were initially high in the haematoma and fell gradually with a low oxygen environment first established after four to five days. This study illustrates that in bone healing the local environment for cells may not be considered constant with regard to oxygen tension, pressure and temperature.",M1
18622847,"Bone formation in interleukin-4 and interleukin-13 depleted mice.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Cytokines play an important role in the complex process of bone formation. We have previously found an altered skeletal phenotype with reduction of cortical bone mass in mice depleted of the 2 cytokines interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL 13). The present study was performed to investigate a potential role of IL-4 and IL-13 in fracture healing and bone induction by demineralized xenogenic bone matrix (DXBM). METHODS: <e>Callus</e> formation in IL-4-(/)-IL-13-(/)- (IL-4/13 knockout) and wild-type (WT) male mice was compared using a standardized fracture model. The capacity of IL-4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) and WT male and female mice to form heterotopic bone was compared using intramuscular implants of DXBM. Bone formation and mechanical properties were evaluated by pQCT, ash weight, 3-point bending, radiology, and immunohistology. RESULTS: In the fracture investigation substantial amounts of new bone formation by 5 weeks were found, but no differences in radiographical healing, callus volume, BMD, BMC, or mechanical properties were detected between IL-4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) and WT mice. In the DXBM investigation radiographic analysis confirmed mineralization of implants in both groups, but no difference in the amount of mineral deposition (net bone formation) between IL-4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) and WT mice was found. Immunohistology showed inhibition of autonomic nerves in the capsule of the IL-4(-/-)IL-13(-/-) group along with a lack of vascularization within the implants. INTERPRETATION: Depletion of IL-4 and IL-13 does not cause any major alteration in fracture healing or heterotopic bone formation in mice. The pattern of autonomous nerve expression and expression of markers of neovascularization is, however, altered to some extent by the absence of IL-4 and IL-13.",M1
18597237,"Delayed radial nerve palsy due to entrapment of the nerve in the <e>callus</e> of a distal third humerus fracture.A 45-year-old male patient was referred for management of radial nerve palsy. His past medical history revealed that he had been injured in a car accident and broken his left humerus 4 months ago. Primary stabilization of the fracture has been achieved by the application of a long-arm plaster cast. His medical reports displayed that he had experienced no clinical signs of radial nerve palsy at that time. After the cast was removed, he noticed that he could not extend his wrist. Surgical exploration revealed that the radial nerve was encased inside the callus. He had probably not realized the weakness of wrist extension earlier due to the structure of the long-arm plaster cast that totally encased the arm, wrist and hand. In the light of the presented case, we recommend not using a long-arm plaster cast in stabilization of the distal third humeral shaft fractures in order to diagnose this kind of a complication earlier.",M1
18582604,"Bolus or weekly zoledronic acid administration does not delay endochondral fracture repair but weekly dosing enhances delays in hard <e>callus</e> remodeling.INTRODUCTION: It has been widely assumed that osteoclasts play a pivotal role during the entire process of fracture healing. Bisphosphonates (BPs) are anti-catabolic agents commonly used to treat metabolic bone diseases including osteoporosis, minimizing fracture incidence. Yet, fractures do occur in these patients and the potential for negative effects of BPs on healing has been suggested. We aimed to examine the effect of different dosing regimes of the potent BP zoledronic acid (ZA) on early endochondral fracture repair and later callus remodeling in a normal bone healing environment. METHODS: Saline, a Bolus dose of 0.1 degrees mg/kg ZA or 5 weekly divided doses of 0.02 degrees mg/kg of ZA commenced 1 week post operatively in a rat closed fracture model. Samples at 1, 2, 4 and 6 weeks post fracture were used to analyze initial fracture union, and 12 and 26 weeks post fracture to investigate the progress of remodeling. RESULTS: ZA did not alter the rate of endochondral fracture union. All fractures united by 6 weeks, with no difference in the progressive reduction of cartilaginous soft callus between control and treatment groups over time. ZA treatment increased hard callus bone mineral content (BMC), volume and increased callus strength at 6 and 26 weeks post fracture. Hard callus remodeling commenced at 4 weeks post fracture with Bolus ZA treatment but was delayed until after 6 weeks in the Weekly ZA group. By 12 and 26 weeks, Bolus ZA had equivalent callus content of remodeled neo-cortical bone to the Saline controls, whereas Weekly ZA remained reduced compared to Saline controls at these times (P&lt;0.01). Callus material properties such as peak stress were significantly reduced in both ZA groups at 6 weeks. At 26 weeks, Bolus ZA-treated calluses generated peak stress equivalent to control values, whereas Weekly ZA callus peak stress remained significantly reduced, indicating remodeling delay. CONCLUSIONS: Osteoclast inhibition with ZA does not delay endochondral fracture repair in healthy rats. Bolus ZA treatment increased net callus size and strength at 6 weeks while allowing hard callus remodeling to proceed in the long term, albeit more slowly than control. Prolonged bisphosphonate dosing during repair does not delay endochondral ossification but can significantly affect remodeling long after the drug is ceased.",M1
18560855,"Biological effects of extracorporeal shockwave in bone healing: a study in rabbits.INTRODUCTION: This study is an investigation of the biological effects of extracorporeal shockwave treatment (ESWT) on bone healing in a rabbit model. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Sixteen 12-month-old New Zealand white rabbits with body weight ranging from 2.5 to 3.5 kg were used in the study. An intra-medullary pin was inserted retrograde into the femur canal. A closed fracture of the femur was created with a three-point bend method. The animals were randomly divided into the study group and the control group with eight rabbits in each group. The study group received shockwave treatment, whereas the control group did not. The animals were killed at 12 weeks, and a 5-cm long femur bone including the <e>callus</e> was harvested. The specimens were subjected to biomechanical study, histomorphological examination, and immunohistochemical analysis. RESULTS: The shockwave group showed significantly better bone strength in biomechanical study, more cortical bone formation in histomorphological examination and higher number of neo-vessels and angiogenic and osteogenic growth markers including VEGF, eNOS, PCNA, and BMP-2 on immunohistochemical stains than the control group. CONCLUSION: ESWT significantly improved bone healing after fracture of the femur in rabbit. ESWT promoted the formation of cortical bone what might have been associated with increased biomechanical results. ESWT-promoted bone healing was associated with increased neovascularization and up-regulation of angiogenic and osteogenic growth factors.",M1
18539674,"<e>Callus</e> distraction for humeral nonunion with bone loss and limb shortening caused by chronic osteomyelitis.Nonunion of the humerus with bone loss and shortening due to osteomyelitis is rare but difficult to treat. We describe our experience with a callus distraction technique using a monolateral external fixator for the treatment of this condition. Between October 1994 and January 2004, 11 patients were treated. There were seven males and four females, with a mean age of 14 years (10 to 17). The mean bone loss was 1.9 cm (1 to 2.7) and the mean length discrepancy in the upper limb was 5.6 cm (3.5 to 8.0). The mean follow-up was for 106 months (54 to 166). The mean external fixation index was 34.8 days/cm (29.8 to 40.5). The mean lengthening was 9.5 cm (5.5 to 13.4). There were seven excellent results, three good and one poor. There were nine excellent functional results and two good. The treatment of humeral nonunion with bone loss and shortening due to osteomyelitis by callus distraction is a safe and effective means of improving function and cosmesis.",M1
18528654,"Evaluation of lengthened <e>callus</e> by callotasis with analysis of mathematical morphology.BACKGROUND: Callotasis has become an established option for reconstruction of congenital anomalies and after resection of bone tumors. However, fracture after removal of the lengthener remains one of the most serious complications. Mathematical morphology is an image processing technique that allows the skeletal patterns of trabecular bone to be selectively extracted as binary images from computed radiographic (CR) images. We evaluated the strength of the lengthened callus by analysis using mathematical morphology and examined the utility of this method in a biomechanical study. METHODS: Three Japanese white rabbits per time point were euthanized at the 2-, 3-, 4-, 6-, and 8-week points after completion of the lengthening and were evaluated by CR images and analysis with mathematical morphology. RESULTS: The changes of the number and continuity of trabecular bone were obtained visually and could be evaluated quantitatively. In some cases corticalization appeared to be complete in the CR images, but it was not complete on the morphological images. Such cases were found to be weaker than those in which corticalization appeared to be complete on both CR and morphological images. CONCLUSION: Analysis with mathematical morphology is useful for evaluating the lengthened callus after callotasis.",M1
18464248,"Effect of age on vascularization during fracture repair.Age affects fracture repair; however, the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. The goal of this study was to assess the effects that age has on vascularization during fracture healing. Tibial fractures were created in juvenile (4-week-old), middle-aged (6-month-old), and elderly (18-month-old) mice. The length density and surface density of blood vessels within fracture calluses were analyzed using stereology at 7 days after fracture. The expression of molecules that regulate vascular invasion of the fracture <e>callus</e> was also compared among the three age groups by immunohistochemistry and in situ hybridization. At 7 days after fracture, juvenile mice had a higher surface density of blood vessels compared to the middle-aged and elderly. Hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha protein and transcripts of vascular endothelial growth factor were detected at 3 days postinjury in juvenile but not middle-aged and elderly mice. Stronger Mmp-9 and -13 expression was detected in fracture calluses at day 7 in the juvenile compared to the middle-aged and elderly mice. At 21 days postfracture, expression of both Mmps was more robust in the elderly than juvenile and middle-aged animals. These data indicate that age affects vascularization during fracture repair, and the changes we observed are directly correlated with altered expression of biochemical factors that regulate the process of angiogenesis. However, whether the increased vascularization is the cause or result of accelerated bone repair in juvenile animals remains unknown. Nonetheless, our results indicate that enhancing vascularization during fracture repair in the elderly may provide unique therapeutic opportunities.",M1
18454167,"Rapamycin affects early fracture healing in mice.BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The immunosuppressive drug rapamycin (RAPA) prevents rejection in organ transplantation by inhibiting interleukin-2-stimulated T-cell division. Rapamycin has also been suggested to possess strong anti-angiogenic activities linked to a decrease in production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). Angiogenesis and VEGF are thought to play a crucial role in fracture healing and as osteoporotic and traumatic fractures are common complications in immunosuppressed, organ transplantation patients, we conducted this study to analyze the effect of rapamycin treatment on bone repair. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We investigated the effect of rapamycin treatment on bone repair in a murine closed femur fracture model using radiological, histomorphometric, immunohistochemical, biomechanical and protein biochemical analyses. KEY RESULTS: X-ray analyses demonstrated that rapamycin treatment inhibits <e>callus</e> formation after two weeks of fracture healing. The radiologically observed lack of callus formation was confirmed by histomorphometric analyses, which revealed a significantly diminished callus size and a reduced amount of bone formation when compared with vehicle-treated controls. Biomechanical testing further demonstrated that rapamycin significantly reduces torsional stiffness of the callus. Interestingly, this effect was associated with decreased vessel formation; a diminished proliferation of osteoblasts, endothelial cells and periosteal cells; and a reduced VEGF expression in hypertrophic chondrocytes. After five weeks treatment, however, the negative impact of rapamycin on fracture healing was overcome. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: Thus, rapamycin initially delays fracture healing, most probably by inhibiting cell proliferation and neovascularization in the callus. These undesirable effects should be considered when rapamycin is administered to patients sustaining bone fractures.",M1
18427819,"Low-dose X-irradiation promotes mineralization of fracture <e>callus</e> in a rat model.OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the hypothesized beneficial effect of low-dose irradiation (LDI) on fracture callus mineralization in a rat model. METHODS: Seventy-two male Sprague-Dawley rats were averagely randomized into LDI group (rats treated with LDI) and SHAM group (rats treated with sham irradiation). Right after either LDI or sham irradiation, a standardized closed fracture on the right femur was established. At 2, 3 and 4 weeks postfracture, 12 rats in each group were euthanized. Fracture callus was assessed by using radiography and MicroCT for callus bridging, peripheral quantitative computed tomography (pQCT) for quantifying bone mineral content (BMC) and cross sectional area (CSA), confocal laser scanning microscopy for measuring area fraction of fluorescence labeling (AFFL) and four-point bending test for examining mechanical properties. RESULTS: The CSA and AFFL were found to be 22 and 33% smaller in the LDI group compared to the SHAM group at 2 weeks (P&lt;0.05 for both), whereas the BMC and AFFL were 15 and 34% higher in the LDI group at 3 weeks (P&lt;0.05 for both). The changing patterns were consistent with the findings in 3-D MicroCT reconstructions. The mechanical parameters (Max-Load, Stiffness and Energy) were also 18, 30 and 24% higher in the LDI group than in the SHAM group at 3 weeks (P&lt;0.05 for all). At 4 weeks, there was no difference found for all assessments between the two groups. CONCLUSION: The results indicated LDI promoted mineralization at the stage of hard callus formation in a rat fracture model.",M1

Most decisions during automobile design and manufacture are informed by studying the intricate biomechanical components of human musculoskeletal systems to ensure maximum comfort, safety and well-being during driving. A case study is presented that confirms inappropriate foot position as a causative factor for the development of abnormal lateral/plantar heel callosities when driving a 4 x 4-style vehicle. The driver's foot position was influenced by the seat geometry of the vehicle. Cessation of driving the 4 x 4-style vehicle and driving of an alternative automobile while on holiday for a period of 4 weeks resolved the condition. On return to the 4 x 4-style vehicle, however, the abnormal callus patterns redeveloped while using the same footwear and no change in any other parameters. It is therefore suggested that seat and consequent foot position is an important ergonomic factor that should be addressed in the future design of automobile seating.",M2

Patients and METHODS: Thirty-eight RA patients were randomly assigned to normal (NCT group) or sham (SCT) scalpel debridement. The sham procedure comprised blunt-edged scalpel paring of the callus which delivered a physical stimulus but left the hyperkeratotic tissue intact, the procedure being partially obscured from the patient. Forefoot pain was assessed using a 100 mm visual analogue scale (VAS), pressure using a high-resolution foot pressure scanner and function using the spatial-temporal gait parameters measured on an instrumented walkway. Radiographic scores of joint erosion were obtained for metatarsophalangeal (MTP) joints with and without overlying callosities. The trial consisted of a randomized sham-controlled phase evaluating the immediate same-day treatment effect and an unblinded 4-week follow-up phase. RESULTS: During the sham-controlled phase, forefoot pain improved in both groups by only 3 points on a VAS and no statistically significant between-group difference was found (P = 0.48). When data were pooled during the unblinded phase, the improvement in forefoot pain reached a peak after 2 days and gradually lessened over the next 28 days. Following debridement, peak pressures at the callus sites decreased in the NCT group and increased in the SCT group, but there was no statistically significant between-group difference (P = 0.16). The area of and duration of contact of the callus site on the ground remained unchanged following treatment in both groups. Following debridement, walking speed was increased, the stride-length was longer and the double-support time shorter in both groups; however, between-group differences did not reach levels of statistical significance. MTP joints with overlying callus were significantly more eroded than those without (P = 0.02). CONCLUSIONS: Treatment of painful plantar callosities in RA using scalpel debridement lessened forefoot pain but the effect was no greater than sham treatment. Localized pressure or gait function was not significantly improved following treatment.",M2

12627623,"Operative repair of fourth and fifth toe corns.METHODS: We report a retrospective review of 57 consecutive patients (72 feet) over a period of 20 years who had been treated operatively for either a lateral fifth toe corn or an interdigital corn of the fourth interdigital space more than two years previously. Of these, 51 patients (62 feet) returned for a follow-up evaluation at a minimum of two years (average of over seven years) which included a review of the interval history since the surgery, a physical examination, a radiographic evaluation, and assessment of the patient's satisfaction with the alignment and results of surgery. Treatment of 31 lateral fifth toe corns involved either a lateral condylectomy and flexor tenotomy or a complete condylectomy. Treatment of 31 interdigital corns comprised either a single condylectomy, double condylectomy of adjacent corns, or a complete condylectomy (hammertoe repair) of a symptomatic corn. Treatment in each case was dependent upon the severity of the deformity. RESULTS: There was found to be no significant difference in comparison of the two major groups (interdigital corns and lateral fifth toe corns) with the measurement of the relative length of the fourth and fifth metatarsals, toe malalignment, angulation of the fourth and fifth toes (MTP-4, MTP-5 angles), and the phalangeal-5 angle. Pain was relieved in 58 of 62 feet (93%) and subjective acceptable alignment was achieved in 54 of 62 feet (87%). At final follow-up 53 feet were rated by patients as excellent, seven as good, one as fair, and one as poor. Complications included numbness of the involved digit (six feet).

12461472,"The impact of callosities on the magnitude and duration of plantar pressure in patients with diabetes mellitus. A <e>callus</e> may cause 18,600 kilograms of excess plantar pressure per day.BACKGROUND: The importance of high peak plantar pressure (PP) in the development of foot ulcer is well known. However, few studies have analyzed the real impact of callosities on plantar pressure and ulcer formation. METHODS: The plantar pressure (PP) in patients with diabetes mellitus was studied in three groups, of a total number of 33 type 2 diabetic patients, without neuropathy or peripheral vascular disease: subjects with callus (A) (n = 10), subjects without callus (B) (n = 10), and a separate group of patients with callus which was submitted to callus removal (C) (n = 13). The plantar pressure (PP) parameters were measured by FSR 174 sensors and computer analyses were performed by LabView. RESULTS: Both maximum peak PP and duration of PP are significantly higher in patients with callus (peak PP: 314 +/- 52 kPa vs 128 +/- 16 kPa, p &lt; 0.005; duration of PP: 621 +/- 27 ms vs 505 +/- 27 ms, p &lt; 0.05). The intervention group C before and after callus removal showed an identical trend. Callus removal has decreased the peak PP by 58% (p &lt; 0.001) and duration of PP has been decreased by 150 milliseconds by step (p &lt; 0.05). CONCLUSION: This study has shown the deleterious role of callus and assuming that an average person walks about 10,000 steps a day, a callus may cause 18,600 kg of excess plantar pressure per day. In addition, this study has proven the importance of early and regular removal of hyperkeratotic tissue.

Kappa coefficients for the repeatability of scoring by this classification system by different workers were 0.71 for teat end callosity thickness and 0.86 for teat end callosity roughness. The teat end callosity classification system was used for a longitudinal study with 40 cows during the first 14 wk of lactation. Models were built to predict teat end callosity thickness and roughness, machine-on time, and milk yield. For the response variables, teat end callosity thickness, machine-on time, and milk yield, the consecutive measurements appeared to follow a lactation curve model with a subject-specific general slope and intercept. Teat end callosity increased rapidly the first 8 wk. Cow factors such as days in milk, parity, machine-on time, and teat end shape were associated with the degree of teat end callosity, and the probability of the callosity ring to become rough. Teat end callosity thickness did not decrease within the 14-wk trial period for most teats. Pointed or round teat ends showed more <e>callus</e> than inverted teat ends. Longer machine-on time resulted in a higher probability of the callosity ring to become rough. Rear teats showed less callosity than front teats in this study.",M2
10834422,"Efficacy of injected liquid silicone in the diabetic foot to reduce risk factors for ulceration: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the effectiveness of injecting liquid silicone in the diabetic foot to reduce risk factors for ulceration in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled trial. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: A total of 28 diabetic neuropathic patients without peripheral vascular disease were randomized to active treatment with 6 injections of 0.2 ml liquid silicone in the plantar surface of the foot or to treatment with an equal volume of saline (placebo). No significant differences were evident regarding age or neuropathy status between the 2 groups. All injections were under the metatarsal heads at sites of calluses or high pressures. Barefoot plantar pressures (pedobarography) and plantar tissue thickness under the metatarsal heads (Planscan ultrasound device) were measured at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months after the first injection. Injection sites were photographed at all stages, and <e>callus</e> formation was scored as a change from baseline. Throughout the study, patients were treated by the same podiatrist for all podiatry treatment. RESULTS: Patients who received silicone treatment had significantly increased plantar tissue thickness at injection sites compared with the placebo group (1.8 vs. 0.1 mm) (P &lt; 0.0001) and correspondingly significantly decreased plantar pressures (-232 vs. -25 kPa) (P &lt; 0.05) at 3 months, with similar results at 6 and 12 months. A trend was noted toward a reduction of callus formation in the silicone-treated group compared with no change in the placebo group. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm the efficacy of plantar silicone injections in reducing recognized risk factors associated with diabetic foot ulceration.",M2
10464719,"The effect of regular <e>callus</e> removal on foot pressures.The optimum frequency of callus removal is unknown. This study shows that in-shoe dynamic plantar pressure measurement can quantify the effect of callus removal in relation with the frequency of podiatric treatment in diabetic ulcer patients. Three groups of diabetic neuropathic patients were studied. Group 0 consisted of six patients who presented for the first time ever for callus removal and who did not have a history of ulceration. The other two groups had a history of ulceration and required regular podiatry treatment: every 6-8 weeks for 10 patients in group A, and every 3-4 weeks for eight patients in group B. Peak plantar pressures were measured using the F-SCAN system, before and after removal of callus, which was weighed to further quantify the effect of podiatry. When callus was removed, peak pressures fell by 32.1 +/- 8.4% (p = .014) in group 0, by 30.9 +/- 4.5% (p &lt; .005) in group A, and by 24.8 +/- 4.0% (p = .005) in group B. The mean weight of callus removed was not significantly different in the three groups. This suggests that the weight of callus is unlikely to be a reliable guide to assess the time intervals between podiatry appointments. However, the measurement of plantar pressures using a dynamic in-shoe plantar pressure device has proven to be a functional, objective, and quantifiable indicator in the assessment of podiatric treatment.",M2

9795067,"Accumulation of sunscreens and other compounds in keratinous substrates.Several cosmetic ingredients, especially sunscreens, should be substantive, which means they are to be adsorbed to specific binding sites within the upper skin layers, particularly keratinized structures of the stratum corneum, and thus show resistance to washing off. We investigated the affinity of 10 non-ionic compounds, among these UV-absorbing chemicals, antioxidants, antimicrobial compounds and a repellent to animal keratin and human <e>callus</e>. In each case a linear relationship between the drug amount, which has accumulated in the respective keratin, and the remaining free concentration of the applied solution could be established. Moreover, drug affinities to keratinous substrates are in direct proportion to the octanol/vehicle partition coefficients, pointing to the fact, that drug enrichment in keratinic substrates is clearly governed by lipophilicity, while specific adsorption, i.e. genuine substantivity, does not seem to occur. After application of a saturated solution non-ionic compounds with a pronounced keratin/vehicle partition coefficient will build up the highest concentration within the stratum corneum. If these compounds show, at the same time, a high solubility in the vehicle, they will penetrate the skin most easily. The used callous tissue seems to be a suitable substrate to simulate and quantify solute uptake into human skin.",M2

Good clinical and cosmetic results were obtained. Bone lengthening is effective in patients with short great toes not only for cosmesis, but also to relieve pain and callosities on the plantar aspect of the second and third metatarsal heads. Excessive lengthening of the first metatarsal resulted in limitation of the range of movement of the metatarsophalangeal joint of the great toe. To prevent this the amount of lengthening should not exceed 40% of the preoperative length of the metatarsal.",M2

PC composition was chromatographically modified (MPC) by eliminating the more polar lipids in order to evaluate their role. Analysis of composition confirms the potential use of PC as a source of stratum corneum lipids. MPC and SCLE exhibit similar differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) profiles with a main transition around 50 degrees C attributed to the solid-to-liquid phase transition of the ceramides. The absence of a transition around 50 degrees C for PC suggests the possible perturbation of ceramide packing by the significantly high proportion of phospholipids. X-ray data suggest a high miscibility of sebum components in stratum corneum lipids with possible modification of chain packing. The MPC patterns show a lipid phase separation which underscores the role of polar lipids in cholesterol/free fatty acids/sterol esters/ceramides structural cohesion.",M2
8976636,"Relation between heel position and the distribution of forefoot plantar pressures and skin callosities in rheumatoid arthritis.OBJECTIVE: To investigate the relation between the position of the rearfoot and the distribution of forefoot plantar pressures and skin callosities in rheumatoid arthritis. METHOD: Plantar pressures and callosity patterns were measured in 102 rheumatoid arthritis patients (120 feet with normal heel alignment and 84 feet with valgus heel alignment measured by goniometry) and in 42 (84 feet) age matched healthy adults. Peak pressures (kPa) were measured across the metatarsal heads in-shoe using an FScan system and the distribution of plantar callosities was visually mapped for each foot. RESULTS: Peak pressures were significantly greater at all but the first metatarsal head in the rheumatoid normal heel alignment and healthy adult groups than in the rheumatoid valgus heel group. The feet of both the rheumatoid normal heel group and the healthy adult group behaved the same, the highest peak pressures registering on the central metatarsal heads. However, only in the rheumatoid group were plantar callosities found at these sites. In the rheumatoid valgus heel group, lateral metatarsal heads were frequently non-weightbearing, producing gross loading patterns with a dominant medial distribution. Peak pressures were shifted to the medial fore-foot accompanied by a higher prevalence of callosities. The results, however, failed to establish clearly an association between peak pressures and <e>callus</e> formation. CONCLUSIONS: In rheumatoid arthritis there is an important interrelation between the rearfoot position and forefoot pressure sites.",M2
8946157,"The association between <e>callus</e> formation, high pressures and neuropathy in diabetic foot ulceration.The presence of an ulcer beneath callus on the diabetic foot has been a well-documented and common clinical finding. We have conducted a prospective study to examine whether callus can be used to predict plantar intrinsic neuropathic diabetic foot ulcer formation. Sixty-three diabetic patients (43 male, 25 Type 1), median age 62 years (IQ range 52, 67), median diabetes duration 17 years (IQ range 8,25) participated in the study. All had neuropathy and peak plantar foot pressures (measured using a dynamic optical pedobarograph) &gt; or = 10 kg cm-2. Calluses and previous ulcers were documented and classified. All ulcers occurring prior to and during the study were recorded, re-examination was 15.4 (range 10-22) months from baseline. Seven ulcers (6 patients) occurred during the study. Pressures were higher in the ulcer than non-ulcer sub-group (p = 0.04) with a relative risk of developing an ulcer of 4.7 for an area of elevated plantar pressure. This compares with a relative risk of 11.0 for an ulcer developing under an area of callus, and a relative risk of 56.8 for an ulcer developing on a site of previous ulceration. This study confirms that a history of previous ulceration is the highest risk factor for ulceration and demonstrates, for the first time, that the presence of plantar callus is highly predictive of subsequent ulceration. Careful history taking and examination of the foot to detect the presence of callus require no special training or equipment and callus should be recognized as a 'high risk' factor for foot ulceration.",M2
7587909,"The use of orthotic devices to correct plantar <e>callus</e> in people with diabetes.Foot problems are a major cause of morbidity in people with diabetes. Plantar callus is common and is a sign of abnormal foot pressures. Shear stresses at these areas of high foot pressures may ultimately result in ulcer formation. This study compared the effect on plantar callus of the use of rigid orthotic devices and conventional podiatric care. Twenty diabetic subjects participated in the study and were randomly allocated to conventional treatment (n = 11) or orthotic device treatment (n = 9). After 12 months the patients in the orthotic group showed a significant reduction in callus grade, whereas the conventionally treated group showed no significant change. There were no adverse effects from wearing the orthotic device. Rigid orthoses have a beneficial effect on plantar callus presumably through the lowering and redistribution of abnormal foot pressures.",M2
8156863,"Assessing the diabetic foot: plantar <e>callus</e> and pressure sensation.The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between the loss of protective pressure sensation in the foot and the formation of plantar calluses, two well-known precursors of plantar ulceration, in adults with diabetes referred to an outpatient diabetes education program. Pressure sensation testing was performed using Semmes-Weinstein monofilaments. Foot inspection included the identification and measurement of plantar calluses. Using the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test, groups categorized as sensitive (n = 67) and insensitive (n = 35) were compared on callus formation. The groups had equivalent numbers, areas, and thickness of calluses. The high prevalence of calluses in both sensitive and insensitive groups suggests that additional factors such as age-related changes in the foot and routine footwear must be included in risk assessment of the diabetic foot and in consideration of preventive interventions.",M2
1551311,"The effect of <e>callus</e> removal on dynamic plantar foot pressures in diabetic patients.Clinical observation suggests that neuropathic foot ulceration frequently occurs beneath plantar callosities and in areas of high dynamic shear and vertical stress underneath the foot during walking. Seventeen diabetic patients had dynamic foot pressure measurements made before and after the removal of a total of 43 forefoot plantar callosities. Peak pressures (mean +/- SE) in the treated areas were reduced by 26% from 14.2 +/- 1.0 to 10.3 +/- 0.9 kg cm-2 (p less than 0.001), with reductions at 37 of the 43 sites and in all patients. Mean heel pressures were not significantly different (5.0 +/- 0.6 vs 4.9 +/- 0.6 kg cm-2). These results suggest that callus may act as a foreign body elevating plantar pressures and that a significant reduction in pressure is achieved by local chiropody treatment.",M2
2760218,"Biochemical analysis of <e>callus</e> tissue in osteogenesis imperfecta type IV. Evidence for transient overmodification in collagen types I and III.We analyzed tissue and cells from a stationary and a rapidly growing hyperplastic callus from a patient with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) type IV and compared the results with those of compact bone and skin fibroblasts of an age-matched control. Collagen and protein contents per cell were low in the callus tissues and collagen I and III were overmodified as evidenced by an elevated level of hydroxylysine. The degree of lysyl hydroxylation was highest in those regions that appeared most immature by histological examination. Lysyl hydroxylation approached normal levels in collagen from the stationary callus and from the center of the growing callus. Overmodification of collagen was not seen in compact bone or cell cultures (neither skin fibroblasts nor callus cells) from the patient. Elevation of hydroxylysine in collagen from OI patients is generally attributed to mutations that delay triple helix formation. Our observations suggest that the varying degree of collagen modifications may occur in consequence of regulatory mechanisms during bone development and tissue repair. These mechanisms may be defective in some patients with OI as seen in this case with hyperplastic callus formation.",M2
3960764,"The influence of nylon cerclage on diaphyseal bone strength: an experimental evaluation of Partridge bands on rabbits.Partridge-designed nylon bands which are used for the cerclage of fractured osteoporotic bones. These bands were given elevations on their inner surfaces to raise the band from the bone surface and thus minimize the negative effects on the periosteal blood circulation. It has previously been shown that the Partridge bands, when applied to a diaphyseal bone, cause a mechanical irritation to the periosteum resulting in an increased <e>callus</e> formation by comparison with the case when corresponding bands with no elevations are applied. It has been suggested that the increased amount of callus would result in increased strength. We have studied the effect of bands designed in accordance with Partridge, compared with corresponding bands having no elevations, in terms of torsion strength (maximum torque capacity), on intact rabbit femora. The results show an increased torsion strength in the femora to which Partridge bands had been applied for eight weeks, while the femora to which corresponding plain nylon bands had been applied had decreased in strength. The experimental study performed supports Partridge's recommendation to use the bands as cerclage in the internal fixation of fractured osteoporotic bones, preferably in combination with further internal fixation materials.",M2

Tritiated thymidine autoradiographic labeling indices were increased in the calluses but the dansyl chloride fluorescence clearance time was prolonged, reflecting the increased thickness of the stratum corneum. The number of corneocytes that could be removed from the surface of callosities by a standardized stimulus was considerably increased compared to controls but after adhesive tape stripping no such increase was observed. The density of corneocytes as measured on Percoll gradients was decreased in corneocytes from <e>callus</e> compared to normal plantar skin, and their volume was increased.

The importance of the subtalar joint is emphasized. Four major abnormalities disturbing normal foot function are noted, and the most commonly encountered of these alterations, rearfoot varus, is discussed in some detail. A series of pedal abnormalities in rearfoot varus occurs because in the foot's attempt to overcome its imbalance, it pronates excessively and causes development of <e>callus</e>, corn, hallux valgus, and even ingrown toenail. Haglund's deformity, soft corn, and tailor's bunion are also secondary to the abnormality.

Surgical means of restoring normal function are briefly discussed.",M2

The electrophoretic behaviour of these solubilized proteins on SDS-polyacrylamide gel was compared with the alpha-fibrous proteins (keratin) of <e>callus</e>. The proteins isolated from callus of normal human heel showed six main bands which were similar to those of the keratin isolated by the 8 M urea-mercaptoethanol method. The lesional skin of forty-five psoriatic patients consistently showed nine main bands on polyacrylamide gels, but only two main bands were observed in the non-lesional, non-heel skin. Six of these nine bands had mobilities and relative intensities almost identical with those of alpha-keratin extracted by the mercaptoethanol method, but the other three bands had greater mobilities on the gels. These results suggest that this technique may have considerable potential for studying changes in alpha-keratin in patients with psoriasis and other disorders of keratinization.",M2
