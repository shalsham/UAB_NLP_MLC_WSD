20527500,"Considerations for the selection of a luting <e>cement</e>.Selection of a luting material for optimal cementation of indirect restorations requires the consideration of several factors relating to the properties of both the cement and of the restoration. Contemporary restorations (for example, dentine-bonded crowns or resin-retained bridges) often rely on bonding, and advances in dental materials science have resulted in simplified resin systems. Their ease of use and other favourable properties also offer advantages when used for more conventional restorations. Traditional luting cements remain commonplace and their benefits and shortcomings are discussed in terms of handling and clinical performance. Developments and trends in adhesive dentistry are explored. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Luting cement selection and application is integral to the optimal performance of indirect restorations.",M1
20499492,"In vitro evaluation of microleakage of various types of dental <e>cements</e>.INTRODUCTION: Microleakage is defined as the clinically undetectable seepage of oral fluids containing bacteria and debris between cement layer and tooth restoration. OBJECTIVE: This in vitro study investigated the effect of different dental cements (zinc-phosphate, polycarboxylate, glass-ionomer and resin cement) on microleakage in different ceramic crown systems (metal ceramic crown, metal ceramic crown with a porcelain margin, Empress 2 and in Ceram all-ceramic crowns) fixed on extracted human teeth. METHODS: One hundred and sixty intact human premolars were randomized to four groups of forty teeth each, according to the different ceramic crown systems. They were prepared in a standardized manner for metal-ceramic and all-ceramic crowns. Crowns were made following a standard laboratory technique, and each group of crowns were divided into four groups according to the different cement agents and cemented on their respective abutments. The specimens were subjected to thermocycling, placed in methylene blue solutions, embedded in resin blocks and vertically cut in the bucco-oral and meso-distal direction. The microleakage in the area of tooth-cement interface was defined as linear penetration of methylene blue and was determined with a microscope to assign microleakage scores using a five-point scale. RESULTS: A significant association was found between a cement type and degree of microleakage (p = 0.001). No statistically significant differences were found among the different ceramic crown systems luted with the same dental cement. The smallest degree of microleakage was observed in specimens luted with resin cement (X = 1.73), followed by glass-ionomer cement (X=2.45) and polycarboxylate cement (X = 3.20). The greatest degree of microleakage was detected in the crowns fixed with zincphosphate cement (X = 3.33). CONCLUSION: The investigated dental cements revealed different sealing abilities. The use of resin cement resulted in the percentage of 0 microleakage scores. Due to this feature, the resin cement is to be recommended in everyday clinical practice.",M1
20437727,"Push-out strength of modified Portland <e>cements</e> and resins.PURPOSE: Modified calcium-silicate cements derived from white Portland cement (PC) were formulated to test their push-out strength from radicular dentin after immersion for 1 month. METHODS: Slabs obtained from 42 single-rooted extracted teeth were prepared with 0.6 mm diameter holes, then enlarged with rotary instruments. After immersion in EDTA and NaOC1, the holes were filled with modified PCs or ProRoot MTA, Vitrebond and Clearfil SE. Different concentrations of phyllosilicate (montmorillonite-MMT) were added to experimental cements. ProRoot MTA was also included as reference material. Vitrebond and Clearfil SE were included as controls. Each group was tested after 1 month of immersion in water or PBS. A thin-slice push-out test on a universal testing machine served to test the push-out strength of materials. Results were statistically analyzed using the least squares means (LSM) method. RESULTS: The modified PCs had push-out strengths of 3-9.5 MPa after 1 month of immersion in water, while ProRoot MTA had 4.8 MPa. The push-out strength of PC fell after incubation in PBS for 1 month, while the push-out strength of ProRoot MTA increased. There were no significant changes in Clearfil SE Bond or Vitrebond after water or PBS storage.",M1
20416445,"Apexogenesis treatment with a new endodontic <e>cement</e>: a case report.INTRODUCTION: This article describes an apexogenesis report of an 8-year old boy referred to our clinic 4 weeks after an impact trauma to the maxillary left central incisor that caused a complicated crown fracture and pulpal exposure. METHODS: In the radiographic examination, the tooth was observed to be immature. After access cavity preparation, cervical pulpotomy was performed, and the remaining pulp was capped with calcium enriched mixture (CEM) cement. The crown was restored by using the fractured incisal segment on the next day. RESULTS: The radiographic and clinical examinations on the 6-month and 12-month follow-ups showed that the tooth remained functional, root development was completed, and the apex was formed. A calcified bridge was produced underneath the capping material. No further endodontic intervention was necessary. CONCLUSIONS: Considering the healing potential of traumatized immature vital pulp, the use of CEM cement for apexogenesis might be an applicable choice; however, further clinical studies with longer follow-up periods are recommended.",M1
20416442,"Effect of mineral trioxide aggregates and Portland <e>cements</e> on inflammatory cells.INTRODUCTION: Recently, some studies have compared mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) with Portland cements, concluding that the principal ingredients of Portland cements are similar to those of MTA. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the effect of gray MTA, white MTA, and gray and white Portland cements on inflammatory cells in rats. METHODS: Fresh mixtures mixed with distilled water were placed in polyethylene tubes, which were implanted in the dorsal subcutaneous connective tissue of 60 Sprague-Dawley rats along with empty tubes as controls. Tissue specimens were collected after the rats were sacrificed after 7, 15, 30, 60, and 90 days. The specimens were fixed, stained, processed, and histologically evaluated under a light microscope. Inflammatory reactions were classified as grade 0: without inflammatory cells, grade I: sporadic infiltration of inflammatory cells, grade II: moderate infiltration (&lt;25 cells), grade III: dense and severe infiltration (25-125 cells), and grade IV: very dense and severe infiltration (&gt;125 cells). Data were analyzed with the nonparametric (two factor) analysis of variance and Kruskal-Wallis H-test. RESULTS: All the groups showed grade III inflammation after 7 and 15 days; there was a decrease in the inflammatory process after 30, 60, and 90 days. After 90 days, gray MTA, white MTA, and control groups had grade 0 inflammatory process, but gray Portland cement and white Portland cement groups showed grade 0 to grade I inflammatory processes. CONCLUSION: MTAs were more biocompatible; however, more studies are required.",M1
20416432,"Environmental scanning electron microscopy connected with energy dispersive x-ray analysis and Raman techniques to study ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate and calcium silicate <e>cements</e> in wet conditions and in real time.INTRODUCTION: ProRoot mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium silicate cements are able to set in a moist environment. The aim of the study was to examine the surface structure and composition of a cement paste under wet conditions and in real time during setting by environmental scanning electron microscopy connected with energy dispersive x-ray analysis (ESEM-EDX) and micro-Raman techniques. METHODS: White ProRoot MTA and experimental white tetrasilicate cement (wTC) and wTC containing bismuth oxide (wTC-Bi) were studied. Cement disks were analyzed 10 minutes after powder-liquid mixing (freshly prepared samples) and after immersion in Dulbecco phosphate-buffered saline at 37 degrees C for 24 hours (24-hour-aged samples). RESULTS: Freshly prepared wet cements at ESEM-EDX exposed an irregular surface (displaying calcium, silicon, aluminum, chlorine reflexes, and bismuth traces in MTA and wTC-Bi) with needle-like and cubic-hexagonal shaped crystals. Aggregates of spheroidal Ca-P-rich crystals (spherulites) appeared on the surface of 24-hour-aged samples. The starting unhydrated powders displayed the typical Raman bands of Portland cement components: alite, belite, and calcium sulfate (only as anhydrite in MTA and as both anhydrite and gypsum in wTC and wTC-Bi). MTA powder showed higher amount of calcium carbonate and lower quantities of anhydrite and higher crystallinity of the silicate component, leading to a slower hydration reaction. Products/markers of hydration reactions were present on fresh samples; ettringite formed on the surface of all the cements; calcium hydroxide (portlandite) was detected only on the surface of wTC, but no conclusion can be drawn on wTC-Bi and MTA because of the interference of bismuth oxide. Calcium phosphate and calcite/aragonite bands were detected on all 24-hour-aged cements; portlandite was no longer detected on wTC. CONCLUSIONS: ESEM and micro-Raman are powerful and suitable techniques to investigate endodontic calcium silicate hydrated cements in real time and in their humid state without inducing artifacts by sample preparation. The formation of apatite spherulites on calcium silicate cements might have clinical relevance.",M1
20416429,"Periradicular regeneration after endodontic surgery with calcium-enriched mixture <e>cement</e> in dogs.INTRODUCTION: The aim of this in vivo study was to compare the response of periradicular tissues to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and calcium-enriched mixture (CEM) cement as root-end fillings and to analyze hard tissue healing after periradicular surgery. METHODS: Intentional periradicular lesions were induced in 32 premolar teeth in 4 beagle dogs. The root canals were prepared, dried, and obturated with laterally condensed gutta-percha with sealer, and the coronal access cavities were filled with amalgam. After surgical exposure of the apices, 2-3 mm of the apical root was resected, and root-end cavities were ultrasonically prepared. The root-end cavities were randomly filled with MTA or CEM cement. After 2 months, the animals were killed; tissue blocks were removed and prepared for histologic examination. Hard tissue healing including cementum and new bone formation in addition to concentration and extent of inflammation were evaluated. RESULTS: Eight samples were excluded. The major finding was the cementum deposition adjacent to MTA in 11 of 12 samples and CEM cement in 10 of 12 samples. With one-way analysis of variance, no significant difference was observed between the periradicular tissue response to tested materials. CONCLUSIONS: CEM cement and MTA were associated with regenerative periapical tissue response when used as root-end filling biomaterials.",M1
20416413,"A descriptive study of the radiographic density of implant restorative <e>cements</e>.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Cementation of implant prostheses is a common practice. Excess cement in the gingival sulcus may harm the periodontal tissues. Identification of the excess cement may be possible with the use of radiographs if the cement has sufficient radiopacity. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the radiographic density of different cements used for implant prostheses. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eight different cements were compared: TempBond Original (TBO), TempBond NE (TBN), Fleck's (FL), Dycal (DY), RelyX Unicem (RXU), RelyX Luting (RXL), Improv (IM), and Premier Implant Cement (PIC). Specimen disks, 2 mm in thickness, were radiographed. Images were made using photostimulable phosphor (PSP) plates with standardized exposure values. The average grey level of the central area of each specimen disk was selected and measured in pixels using a software analysis program, ImageTool, providing an average grey level value representative of radiodensity for each of the 8 cements. The radiodensity was determined using the grey level values of the test materials, which were recorded and compared to a standard aluminum step wedge. An equivalent thickness of aluminum in millimeters was calculated using best straight line fit estimates. To assess contrast effects by varying the exposure settings, a second experiment using 1-mm-thick cement specimens radiographed at both 60 kVp and 70 kVp was conducted. The PSP plates with specimens were measured for a grey level value comparison to the standard aluminum step wedge, using the same software program. RESULTS: The highest grey level values were recorded for the zinc cements (TBO, TBN, and FL), with the 1-mm specimen detectable at both 60- and 70-kVp settings. A lower grey level was recorded for DY, indicative of a lower radiodensity compared to the zinc cements, but higher than RXL and RXU. The implant-specific cements had the lowest grey level values. IM could only be detected in 2-mm-thick sections with a lower aluminum equivalence value than the previously mentioned cements. PIC could not be detected radiographically for either the 1-mm or 2-mm thicknesses at either of the kVp settings. CONCLUSIONS: Some types of cement commonly used for the cementation of implant-supported prostheses have poor radiodensity and may not be detectable following radiographic examination.",M1
20379684,"Effect of light-curing units in shear bond strength of metallic brackets: an in vitro study.OBJECTIVES: To determine the influence of the light curing units on the shear bond strength of orthodontic brackets. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-two premolars were divided into six groups (n=12): Group I: brackets bonded with Transbond and polymerization with halogen light; Group II: Transbond and LED; Group III: Fuji Ortho and halogen light; Group IV: Fuji Ortho and LED; Group V: Fuji Ortho, without acid and halogen light; Group VI: Fuji Ortho, without acid and LED. The groups were tested to shear strength in a universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 0.5 mm/min. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test. RESULTS: The composite resin presented higher shear bond strength than the resin-modified glass ionomer <e>cement</e> (p&lt;0.05). The halogen light and LED sources produced similar shear bond strength (p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: The shear bond strength was influenced by the material but not by the light-curing unit. The use of LED reduced the experimental time by approximately 60%, with the same curing efficiency.",M1
20379679,"Effect of temporary <e>cements</e> on the shear bond strength of luting cements.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate, by shear bond strength (SBS) testing, the influence of different types of temporary cements on the final cementation using conventional and self-etching resin-based luting cements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty human teeth divided in two halves were assigned to 8 groups (n=10): I and V (no temporary cementation); II and VI: Ca(OH)2-based cement; III and VII: zinc oxide (ZO)-based cement; IV and VIII: ZO-eugenol (ZOE)-based cement. Final cementation was done with RelyX ARC cement (groups I to IV) and RelyX Unicem cement (groups V to VIII). Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Tukey's test at 5% significance level. RESULTS: Means were (MPa): I - 3.80 (+/-1.481); II - 5.24 (+/-2.297); III - 6.98 (+/-1.885); IV - 6.54 (+/-1.459); V - 5.22 (+/-2.465); VI - 4.48 (+/-1.705); VII - 6.29 (+/-2.280); VIII - 2.47 (+/-2.076). Comparison of the groups that had the same temporary cementation (Groups II and VI; III and VII; IV and VIII) showed statistically significant difference (p&lt;0.001) only between Groups IV and VIII, in which ZOE-based cements were used. The use of either Ca(OH)2-based (Groups II and VI) or ZO-based (Groups III and VII) cements showed no statistically significant difference (p&gt;0.05) for the different luting cements (RelyX ARC and RelyX Unicem). The groups that had no temporary cementation (Groups I and V) did not differ significantly from each other either (p&gt;0.05). CONCLUSION: When temporary cementation was done with ZO- or ZOE-based cements and final cementation was done with RelyX ARC, there was an increase in the SBS compared to the control. In the groups cemented with RelyX Unicem, however, the use of a ZOE-based temporary cement affected negatively the SBS of the luting agent used for final cementation.",M1
20362915,"Microleakage of orthodontic band <e>cement</e> at the cement-enamel and cement-band interfaces.INTRODUCTION: Our objective was to determine and compare microleakage patterns of conventional glass ionomer cement (GIC), resin modified GIC (RMGIC), and polyacid-modified composite for band cementation. METHODS: Sixty freshly extracted third molars were randomly divided into 3 groups of 20 teeth each. Microetched molar bands in the 3 groups were cemented to enamel with one of three orthodontic cements: Ketac-Cem (3M ESPE, Gmbh, Seefeld, Germany), Multi-Cure (3M Unitek, Monrovia, Calif), and Transbond Plus (3M Unitek). A dye penetration method was used for microleakage evaluation. Microleakage was determined by a stereomicroscope for the cement-band and cement-enamel interfaces from both the buccal and lingual margins. Statistical analysis was performed with Kruskal-Wallis and Mann-Whitney U tests. RESULTS: The buccal sides had similar microleakage values compared with the lingual sides for the cement-enamel and cement-band interfaces with all cements. Statistical comparisons showed statistically significant differences among the band cements between both interfaces (P &lt;0.001). When the cement systems were compared, conventional GIC showed the highest leakage scores between cement-band (median, 3.50 mm) and cement-enamel (median, 2.88 mm) interfaces. Teeth banded with RMGIC and modified composite showed similar microleakage scores, and both had less leakage (&lt;1 mm) than conventional GIC. CONCLUSIONS: Conventional GIC is associated with more microleakage than RMGIC and modified composite at both the cement-band and cement-enamel interfaces.",M1
20344899,"Bond strength of luting <e>cements</e> to core foundation materials.PURPOSE: The purpose was to compare the shear bond strength of luting cements to foundation materials and to determine the effect of storage in lactate buffer solution. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Disks that were 8 mm in diameter and 2-mm thick were fabricated from foundation substrates: amalgam, composite resin, resin-modified glass ionomer, and glass ionomer (n = 20). Cylinders that were 2 mm in diameter and 4 mm in length of resin luting cement, resin-modified glass ionomer luting cement, and a glass ionomer luting cement were bonded to the foundation substrate materials. Shear bond strength of each foundation substrate material/cement pair was determined with a universal testing machine after 24 hours. A second set of specimens was tested after storage in a 0.01M lactate buffer solution for 24 hours. A three-way analysis of variance followed by pair-wise comparisons was performed to compare bond strengths (P &lt; .05). RESULTS: The resin cement provided the highest (P &lt; .05) bond strengths to amalgam, composite resin, and resin-modified glass ionomer foundation materials while the glass ionomer cement showed the lowest bond strength (P &lt; .05) to composite resin and glass ionomer foundation restoration materials. After immersion in a 0.01M lactate buffer solution, the shear bond strength of all the material combinations was significantly lower (P &lt; .05) than nonimmersed specimens, except the bonds between composite resin foundation and resin luting cement, which significantly increased (P &lt; .05) in strength. CONCLUSION: The resin cement had the highest bond strength to most foundation substrates investigated. The highest bond was observed between the composite resin foundation and resin cement. This bond was also the most durable on immersion in lactic acid.",M1
20303061,"Analysis of heavy metal contents in gray and white MTA and 2 kinds of Portland <e>cement</e>: a preliminary study.OBJECTIVE: The levels of 10 heavy metals (arsenic, bismuth, cadmium, chromium, copper, iron, lead, manganese, nickel, and zinc) in gray Portland cement (GPC), white Portland cement (WPC), gray MTA (GMTA), and white MTA (WMTA) were analyzed by inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES). STUDY DESIGN: One gram of each material was digested with 80 degrees C  aqua-regia  (7 mL of 60% HNO3 and 21 mL of 35% HCl), filtered, and analyzed by ICP-AES. The analysis was performed 6 times and the data were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: Arsenic and lead concentrations were the highest in GPC (P &lt; .05). GPC had much more of 7 heavy metals than the other 3 cements (P &lt; .05). GMTA and WMTA had higher purity than GPC and WPC (P &lt; .05), particularly when arsenic content was considered. CONCLUSION: If a clinician is considering using Portland cement versus MTA, the differences in purity may be considered.",M1
20235188,"Cytotoxicity, calcium release, and pH changes generated by novel calcium phosphate <e>cement</e> formulations.Few published studies describe the biological properties of calcium phosphate cements (CPCs) for dental applications. We measured several biologically relevant properties of 3 CPCs over an extended (8 wk) interval. Monocalcium phosphate, calcium oxide, and synthetic hydroxyapatite were combined with either modified polyacrylic acid, light-activated modified polyalkenoic acid, or 35% w/w polymethyl vinyl ether maleic acid to obtain Types I, II, and III CPCs, respectively. Set cements were placed in direct contact with L929 fibroblasts for up to 8 weeks. Media Ca(+2) and pH were determined by atomic absorption spectroscopy and pH electrode respectively. Cell mitochondrial function was measured by MTT assay. Type I cements suppressed mitochondrial activity &gt; 90% (vs. Teflon controls), but significantly (p &lt; 0.05) improved to control levels over 8 weeks. Type II cements suppressed mitochondrial activity &gt; 90% at all times. Type III cements elevated mitochondrial activity significantly after 7 wks. The pH profiles approached neutrality by 24 h, and all cements released calcium into the storage medium at all periods (24 h - 8 wk). We concluded that several types of cements had long-term biological profiles that show promise for dental applications.",M1
20228982,"Microleakage evaluation of core buildup composite resins with total-etch and self-etch adhesive systems.AIM: Core buildup composite resins with prefabricated posts are commonly used to restore endodontically treated teeth. This study compared the sealing ability of Core Max II and Panavia F2.0 <e>cement</e> with total-etch and self-etch adhesive systems. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Sixty recently extracted human second premolar teeth were chosen and their crowns were cut 3 mm above the CEJ. After preparing proximal boxes (4+/-1 mm buccolingually and 3 mm occlusogingivally dimensions) and finishing root canal therapy, the teeth were randomly divided into four groups (n=15): groups 1 and 2, Core Max II without and with total-etch adhesive; groups 3 and 4, Clearfil photocore composite, A2 shade, and Panavia F2.0 cement without and with self-etch adhesive respectively. The Dentatus posts (# 2 Long) were used in canals approximately 8 mm depth. According to manufacturer guidelines, pins were cemented and cores were restored. After keeping the specimens for 24 hours at 37 degrees C and 100% humidity, they were thermally cycled for 500 cycles, sealed with nail varnish except 1 mm beyond the margins of restoration, and then immersed in a 0.5% fuschin basic for 24 hours. Samples were embedded in clear epoxy resin, sectioned mesiodistally, and observed at 20x magnification. The microleakage was assessed under stereomicroscope and the results were recorded in percentage of dye penetration to the whole path from the cavosurface margin of the proximal boxes to the end of the post. Analysis of variance and the Tukey test were used to evaluate the data (p=0.05). RESULTS: Groups 1 and 4 had the highest and the lowest values of microleakage respectively. Microleakage of Panavia F2.0 cement was lower than for Core Max II and for both cements using adhesive made the microleakage smaller than without it (p&lt;0.05). CONCLUSION: Application of adhesive using Core Max II cement and Panavia F2.0 cement is strongly recommended to decrease microleakage. Self-etch adhesive performed better than total-etch adhesive. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: With regards to microleakage, the self-etching primer displayed better sealing than that obtained with the total-etching, two-step dental adhesive.",M1
20200419,"Implication of ethanol wet-bonding in hybrid layer remineralization.During mineralization, unbound water within the collagen matrix is replaced by apatite. This study tested the null hypothesis that there is no difference in the status of in vitro biomimetic remineralization of hybrid layers, regardless of their moisture contents. Acid-etched dentin was bonded with One-Step with ethanol-wet-bonding, water-wet-bonding, and water-overwet-bonding protocols. Composite-dentin slabs were subjected to remineralization for 1-4 months in a medium containing dual biomimetic analogs, with set Portland <e>cement</e> as the calcium source and characterized by transmission electron microscopy. Remineralization was either non-existent or restricted to the intrafibrillar mode in ethanol-wet-bonded specimens. Extensive intrafibrillar and interfibrillar remineralization was observed in water-wet-bonded specimens. Water-overwet specimens demonstrated partial remineralization of hybrid layers and precipitation of mineralized plates within water channels. The use of ethanol-wet-bonding substantiates that biomimetic remineralization is a progressive dehydration process that replaces residual water in hybrid layers with apatite crystallites.",M1
20171371,"Hydration characteristics of calcium silicate <e>cements</e> with alternative radiopacifiers used as root-end filling materials.INTRODUCTION: Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) is composed of calcium silicate cement and bismuth oxide added for radiopacity. The bismuth oxide in MTA has been reported to have a deleterious effect on the physical and chemical properties of the hydrated material. This study aimed to investigate the hydration mechanism of calcium silicate cement loaded with different radiopacifiers for use as a root-end filling material. METHODS: Calcium silicate cement loaded with barium sulfate, gold, or silver/tin alloy was hydrated, and paste microstructure was assessed after 30 days. In addition, atomic ratio plots of Al/Ca versus Si/Ca and S/Ca and Al/Ca were drawn, and X-ray energy dispersive analysis of the hydration products was performed to assess for inclusion of heavy metals. The leachate produced from the cements after storage of the cements in water for 28 days and the leaching of the radiopacifiers in an alkaline solution was assessed by using inductively coupled plasma. RESULTS: The hydrated calcium silicate cement was composed of calcium silicate hydrate, calcium hydroxide, ettringite, and monosulfate. Unhydrated cement particles were few. No heavy metals were detected in the calcium silicate hydrate except for the bismuth in MTA. Calcium was leached out early in large quantities that reduced with time. The barium and bismuth were leached in increasing amounts. Copper was the most soluble in alkaline solution followed by bismuth and barium in smaller amounts. CONCLUSIONS: The bismuth oxide can be replaced by other radiopacifiers that do not affect the hydration mechanism of the resultant material.",M1
20162930,"One year clinical performance and post-operative sensitivity of a bioactive dental luting <e>cement</e>--a prospective clinical study.A one-year clinical study was performed on the efficacy of a bioactive dental cement (Ceramir C&amp;B) with calcium aluminate and glass ionomer components. The study was performed on 38 crown and bridge abutments in 17 patients. Preparation parameters were recorded, as well as working-times, setting-times, and other handling characteristics. Baseline data were also recorded for gingival inflammation (GI) and pre-cementation sensitivity. Post-cementation parameters included sensitivity, gingival tissue reactions, marginal integrity and discolorations. All patients were seen for recall examinations at 30 days, and 6 months. For sixteen patients one-year recall data were collected on retention and subjective sensitivity. Fifteen subjects were available for one year clinical examinations. Three independent examiners found the working and setting time of the cement to be well within expected limits and that cement removal was easy. Four patients reported low-grades of immediate post-cementation sensitivity, however, this disappeared after an occlusal adjustment or without intervention within one month. At 12 months no retentive failures were recorded and no subjective sensitivity reported. All crowns were rated in the  Excellent  quality category for marginal integrity. Both GI-scores and scores for tooth sensitivity decreased during the course of the study. One year recall data yielded no incidence of secondary caries and no visible marginal discoloration. The new cement was thus found to perform favorably as a luting agent for permanent cementation.",M1
20162110,"In vitro evaluation of reverse torque value of abutment screw and marginal opening in a screw- and <e>cement</e>-retained implant fixed partial denture design.PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical efficacy of implant prostheses retained by screws and cement (SCPs) by examining the reverse torque values (RTVs) of the abutment screws and the marginal openings of the implant prostheses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two implants (3.8 x 13 mm; Camlog Biotechnologies) were embedded in an acrylic resin block 5 mm apart. Eighteen copies of this resin specimen were fabricated and randomly divided into two groups. Two-unit implant prostheses with two different designs-purely cement-retained implant prostheses (group 1) and SCPs (group 2)-were made out of type IV gold alloy and placed on the implants. After tightening to about 30 Ncm, the preloading RTVs of the abutment screws were measured. After retightening the abutment screws or cementing the prostheses, followed by cyclic loading, the postloading RTVs of the abutment screws were examined. Also, the marginal openings of the prostheses in the two groups were measured under a stereomicroscope. These measurements were compared statistically. RESULTS: The postloading RTVs and their differences from the preloading RTVs of the abutment screws demonstrated no significant differences between groups (P &gt; .05). Group 2 prostheses showed significantly smaller marginal openings than group 1 prostheses (P &lt; .05). CONCLUSION: The forces generated when torquing the abutment screw of the SCP did not cause more loosening of the abutment screws than the purely cement-retained implant prosthesis. The SCP showed better marginal adaptation of the cement-retained part than the purely cement-retained implant prosthesis, possibly as a result of the screw-retained abutment seating the restoration. Within the limitations of this in vitro test, the SCP showed no significant difference in RTV of the abutment screw and a smaller marginal gap compared to a purely cement-retained implant prosthesis.",M1
20158535,"Evaluation of the physical properties of an endodontic Portland <e>cement</e> incorporating alternative radiopacifiers used as root-end filling material.AIM: To investigate the physical and chemical properties of Portland cement (PC) loaded with alternative radiopacifying materials for use as root-end filling materials in a mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA)-like system. METHODOLOGY: Portland cement loaded with barium sulphate, gold and silver/tin alloy was mixed with water, and the physical and chemical properties of the hydrated cements were evaluated. MTA and intermediate restorative material (IRM) were used as controls. The radiopacity was compared to the equivalent thickness of aluminium, and the setting time of the cements was assessed using an indentation technique. The compressive strength and the stress-strain relationship were determined at 28 days. The stress-strain relationship was determined by monitoring the strain generated when the cement was subjected to compressive load. In addition, the pH was determined in water and simulated body fluid for a period of 28 days. RESULTS: The radiopacity of the cements using alternative radiopacifiers was comparable to MTA (P &gt; 0.05). IRM demonstrated a higher radiopacity than all the materials tested (P &lt; 0.05). All the cements with the exception of IRM exhibited an alkaline pH and had an extended setting time when compared to IRM. MTA had a longer setting time than the PC (P &lt; 0.001), and its setting time was similar to the gold-loaded cement (P = 0.159). The addition of a radiopacifier retarded the setting time (P &lt; 0.001) but did not have any effect on the compressive strength as all loaded cements had comparable strength to PC (P &gt; 0.05). IRM was the weakest cement tested (P &lt; 0.001). The cement loaded with gold radiopacifier had comparable strength to MTA (P = 1). The stress-strain relationship was linear for all the cements with IRM generating more strain on loading. CONCLUSIONS: Within the parameters set in this study, bismuth oxide in MTA can be replaced by gold or silver/tin alloy.

20113792,"The biomineralization ability of mineral trioxide aggregate and Portland <e>cement</e> on dentin enhances the push-out strength.INTRODUCTION: Recently, it was shown that the interaction of each of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland cement with dentin in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) promotes a biomineralization process that leads to the formation of an interfacial layer with tag-like structures at the cement-dentin interface. This study analyzes the influence of the biomineralization process on the push-out strength of ProRoot MTA (Dentsply Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK), MTA Branco (Angelus Soluções Odontológicas, Londrina, PR, Brazil), MTA BIO (Angelus Soluções Odontológicas), or Portland cement with and without calcium chloride. METHODS: Dentin discs with standardized cavities were filled with ProRoot MTA, MTA Branco, MTA BIO, white Portland cement + 20% bismuth oxide (PC1), or PC1 + 10% of calcium chloride (PC2). The specimens were randomly divided into two groups: cement in contact with a wet cotton pellet for 72 hours or immersed in PBS for 2 months. The bond strengths were measured with the Instron Testing machine (Model 4444; Instron Corp, Canton, MA), and the fractured surfaces on the root walls were observed by scanning electron microscopy. RESULTS: All samples immersed in PBS displayed a significantly greater resistance to displacement than that observed for the samples in contact with a wet cotton pellet for 72 hours (p &lt; 0.05). MTAs displayed a significantly greater resistance to displacement than Portland cements. CONCLUSION: It was concluded that the biomineralization process positively influenced the push-out bond strength of the cements, particularly the MTA groups.",M1
20105680,"Effects of endodontic post surface treatment, dentin conditioning, and artificial aging on the retention of glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Several post surface treatments with or without the application of a bonding agent have been recommended to improve the bond strength of resin <e>cements</e> to posts. A regimen that produces the maximum bond strength of glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts has not been verified. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the influence of post surface conditioning methods and artificial aging on the retention and microleakage of adhesively luted glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy-two endodontically treated single-rooted teeth were prepared for glass fiber-reinforced composite resin posts. The posts were submitted to 3 different surface treatments (n=24), including no treatment, etching with phosphoric acid, and airborne-particle abrasion. Subgroups of the posts (n=8) were then allocated for 3 different experimental conditions: no artificial aging, no bonding agent; no artificial aging, bonding agent; or artificial aging, bonding agent. The posts were luted with resin cement (Calibra). Post retention was measured in tension at a crosshead speed of 2 mm/min. The posts assigned for microleakage investigation were placed in fuchsin dye for 72 hours. The dislodged posts and the post spaces were examined microscopically to evaluate the mode of failure and explore the microleakage. Data were analyzed by 2-way ANOVA followed by Tukey HSD test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: The mean (SD) retention values for test groups ranged from 269 (63.8) to 349 (52.2) N. The retention values of the airborne-particle-abrasion group were significantly higher than those of the acidic-treatment and no-treatment groups. The application of bonding agent on the post surface produced no significant influence on retention. The mean retention values after artificial aging were significantly higher than without artificial aging. Microscopic evaluation demonstrated that the failure mode was primarily mixed. CONCLUSIONS: Treating the surface of the posts with phosphoric acid for 15 seconds before cementation produced no significant improvement in post retention. Airborne-particle abrasion of the surface of the post significantly improved post retention.",M1
20095198,"Clinical performance of <e>cements</e> as luting agents for telescopic double crown-retained removable partial and complete overdentures.PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the survival rates and technical failures of removable prostheses (RPs) supported by telescopic double crown (TDC)-retained abutment teeth luted with zinc-phosphate or glass-ionomer cement. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Clinical records of 577 patients (288 women, 289 men) who received 577 TDC-retained RPs supported by 1,807 abutments at the Department of Prosthodontics of the University Hospital Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany, between 1984 and 2007 were analyzed. The 577 prostheses included 200 attached to telescopic crowns with friction fit (FFs), 62 to conical crowns (CCs), and 315 to parallel-sided telescopic crowns with clearance fit (CFs). Survival probabilities were evaluated for the RPs, loss of cementation of the inner copings, secondary caries, and abutment teeth that required endodontic treatment using the Kaplan-Meier method. A Cox regression analysis determined the impact of covariates such as sex, denture location (maxilla/mandible), Eichner classification, number of abutment teeth, and the type of double crown system used. RESULTS: The 10-year survival probability was 98.8% +/- 0.09% for FFs, 92.9% +/- 0.41% for CCs, and 86.6% +/- 0.05% for CFs. During the observation period, loss of cementation was frequently observed (FFs: 32%, CCs: 53.2%, CFs: 21.3%). After 15 years, more than 75% of patients had experienced at least one  loss of cementation  event. In this respect, zinc-oxide phosphate and glass-ionomer cements did not show any significant difference. CONCLUSION: The long-term successful outcome of the RP experience was not compromised, although numerous clinical visits were required for maintenance. The predominant maintenance procedure was the need for recementation of the inner copings.",M1
20090144,"Cementing porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns.The clinical success of fixed prosthodontic restorations can be complex and involve multifaceted procedures. Preparation design, oral hygiene/micro flora, mechanical forces, and restorative materials are only a few of the factors which contribute to overall success. One key factor to success is choosing the proper <e>cement</e>. Popular use of cements for PFM crowns has shifted from zinc phosphate and glass ionomer cements to resin-reinforced glass ionomer, or RRGI, cements. This change has been rapid and profound. Dental cements have always been less than ideal materials, but this is shift to the relatively new RRGI category justified. Resin-reinforced glass ionomer (RRGI) cements appear to be better than zinc phosphate and glass ionomer cements when placing porcelain-to-metal crowns. RRGI cements, such as RelyX Luting, Fuji Plus and Vitremer Luting Cement, satisfy more of the ideal characteristics of PFM cementation than any other previous cement. Expansion of all three cements has not caused any apparent problems with the cements when used with PFM or metal crowns, but these cements, however, should be avoided when cementing all-ceramic crowns.",M1
20032614,"Sealing ability of mineral trioxide aggregate and Portland <e>cement</e> for furcal perforation repair: a protein leakage study.The purpose of this study was to compare the sealing ability of gray mineral trioxide aggregate (GMTA), white MTA (WMTA), and both white and gray Portland cement as furcation perforation repair materials. A total of 120 human mandibular first molars were used. After root canal obturation and preparation of furcal perforations the specimens were randomly divided into four groups of 25 teeth each. In groups A, B, C, and D furcation perforations were filled with WMTA, GMTA, white Portland cement, and type II Portland cement, respectively. Ten teeth were used as positive controls with no filling materials in the perforations and 10 teeth with complete coverage with two layers of nail varnish were used as negative controls. A protein leakage model utilizing 22% bovine serum albumin (BSA) was used for evaluation. Leakage was noted when color conversion of the protein reagent was observed. The controls behaved as expected. Leakage was found in the samples from group A (WMTA), group B (GMTA), and in the two other groups (white and gray Portland cement). There were no statistically significant differences between GMTA and WMTA or white and gray Portland cement, but significant differences were observed between the MTA groups and the Portland cement groups. It was concluded that Portland cements have better sealing ability than MTA, and can be recommended for repair of furcation perforation if the present results are supported by other in vivo and in vitro studies.",M1
19961453,"Effect of two storage solutions on surface topography of two root-end fillings.The effect of different storage solutions on surface topography of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and new experimental <e>cement</e> (NEC) as root-end fillings was investigated. Twenty-four single-rooted teeth were cleaned, shaped and obturated in a same manner. After root-end resection, 3-mm deep root-end cavities were ultrasonically prepared. Samples were randomly divided into four test groups (A1-A2-B1-B2, n = 6). Root-end cavities in groups A and B were filled with MTA and NEC, respectively, and were then stored in 100% humidity for 24 h. The samples of groups 1 and 2 were, respectively, immersed in normal saline (NS) and phosphate buffer saline solutions for 1 week. The samples were imaged under stereomicroscope before and after immersion and were then investigated and analysed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive X-ray analysis (EDXA). Results showed significant difference among studied groups. Surface topography of all samples was altered by crystal formation and precipitation on root-end fillings except for group A1 (MTA-NS). SEM and EDXA results showed that the composition and structure of precipitated crystals were comparable with that of standard hydroxyapatite. It was concluded that biocompatibility, sealing ability, and cementogenic activity of MTA and probably NEC may be attributed to this fundamental bioactive reaction.",M1
19936520,"Water sorption and solubility of different calcium hydroxide <e>cements</e>.OBJECTIVES: Calcium hydroxide cements have been largely used in deep cavities due to their abilities to stimulate dentin formation. However, their resistance can be relatively low and their solubility relatively high, in many instances. This study evaluated water sorption and solubility of different calcium hydroxide cements, in order to show alterations that may reduce their effectiveness. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five discs (20 mm in diameter and 1.5 mm thick) of three different materials (Biocal, Dycal and Hidro C) were prepared with the aid of a ring-shaped metallic matrix. After being stored at 37 degrees C for 24 h, the discs were weighed on a precision weight scale, dehydrated and weighed again. Immediately after weighing, discs were stored for a week in 50 mL of distilled water at 37 degrees C and, then, weighed again, dehydrated and submitted to a new weighing. The loss of soluble material and its water sorption was obtained from the difference between the initial and the final dry mass of each disc, after 1 week of immersion in water. Data were analyzed for significant differences by two-way ANOVA and Tukey's test (p&lt;0.05). RESULTS: Mean water sorption values (g) +/- standard deviation and percentage (%), for each evaluated cement, were: Biocal (0.006 +/- 0.001 / 2.15); Dycal (0.016 +/- 0.004 / 5.49); and Hidro C (0.025 +/- 0.003 / 8.27). Mean solubility values (g) +/- standard deviation and percentage (%), for each evaluated cement, were: Biocal (0.002 +/- 0.001 / 0.72); Dycal (0.013 +/- 0.004 / 4.21); and Hidro C (0.023 +/- 0.004 / 7.65). CONCLUSIONS: Biocal absorbed less water and was less soluble than the other evaluated cements; Hidro C exhibited the highest water sorption and solubility values; and there were significant differences among all evaluated experimental groups.",M1
19915272,"Why the carioprotective potential of luting <e>cements</e> crucial?Space maintainers make good oral hygiene difficult, modify the oral environment, and increase the chances of enamel demineralization. Demineralization can be prevented or reduced by improving patient oral hygiene or by using topical fluorides. However these methods depend on patient compliance and, therefore, are not very reliable. Thus, caries prevention in banding might be enhanced by using fluoride-releasing cements. The aim of the study was to comparatively evaluate the carioprotective potential of various luting media used for band cementation in permanent as well as deciduous molars. In this study, 100 molars were taken, which were banded and stored in artificial saliva for 1 month after which the teeth were debanded. An area of 2 x 2 mm was spared and the teeth were coated with nail varnish. The coated teeth were dipped in artificial caries solution in one month followed by 1-day immersion in methylene blue dye, after which the samples were sectioned through the window. The depth of dye penetration was measured and the results were statistically analyzed. Minimum dye penetration was observed with glass ionomer, which could be due to the fluoride release from the cement, whereas the control group showed the maximum, probably due to direct contact with the artificial caries solution.",M1
19891720,"Evaluation of the radiopacity of calcium silicate <e>cements</e> containing different radiopacifiers.AIM: To identify the suitable ratio of alternative radiopacifiers to impart the necessary radiopacity to calcium silicate cements (CSC) and assess the purity of the radiopacifying agents. METHODOLOGY: Alternative radiopacifying materials for incorporation into CSC included barium sulphate, titanium oxide, zinc oxide, gold powder and silver/tin alloy. The chemical composition of the alternative radipacifying materials and bismuth oxide, which is used in mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), was determined using energy dispersive X-ray analysis. In addition, using an aluminium step-wedge and densitometer, the radiopacity of each material was evaluated as recommended by international standards. The optical density was compared with the relevant thickness of aluminium (Al). A commercial MTA and CSC were used as controls. Statistical analysis comparing the radiodensity of the different cements to MTA was performed using anova with P = 0.05 and post hoc Tukey test. RESULTS: All percentage replacements of bismuth oxide, gold and silver-tin alloy powder, and the 25% and 30% replacements with barium sulphate and zinc oxide had radiopacities greater than 3 mm thickness of aluminium (Al) recommended by ISO 6876 (2002). The 25% replacement of cement with gold powder and 20% replacement of cement with silver/tin alloy powder exhibited radiopacity values of 8.04 mm Al and 7.52 mm Al, respectively, similar to MTA (P &gt; 0.05). The cement replaced with 20% bismuth oxide showed a radiopacity of 6.83 mm Al, lower than MTA (P = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: Silver/tin alloy and gold powder imparted the necessary radiopacity to a calcium silicate-based cement. Barium sulphate was also a suitable radiopacifier together with a lower concentration of silver/tin alloy and gold powder that achieved the radiodensity recommended by ISO 6876. Further research is required to investigate the broader properties of the calcium silicate-based cement with the different radiopacifiers.",M1
19885413,"The influence of soft tissue thickness on crestal bone changes around implants: a 1-year prospective controlled clinical trial.PURPOSE: The aim of this clinical trial was to evaluate the influence of gingival tissue thickness on crestal bone loss around dental implants after a 1-year follow-up. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Forty-six implants (23 test and 23 control) were placed in 19 patients. The test implants were placed about 2 mm supracrestally, whereas the control implants were positioned at the bone level. Before implant placement, the tissue thickness at implant sites was measured with a periodontal probe. After healing, metal-ceramic <e>cement</e>-retained prostheses were constructed. According to tissue thickness, the test implants were divided into A (thin) and B (thick) groups. Intraoral radiographs were performed and crestal bone changes were measured at implant placement and after 1 year. RESULTS: Mean bone loss around the test implants in group A (thin mucosa) was 1.61 +/- 0.24 mm (SE; range, 0.9 to 3.3 mm) on the mesial and 1.28 +/- 0.167 mm (range, 0.8 to 2.1 mm) on the distal. Mean bone loss in test group B (thick mucosa) implants was 0.26 +/- 0.08 mm (range, 0.2 to 0.9 mm) on the mesial aspect and 0.09 +/- 0.05 mm (range, 0.2 to 0.6 mm) on the distal aspect. Mean bone loss around control implants was 1.8 +/- 0.164 mm (range, 0.6 to 4.0 mm) and 1.87 +/- 0.166 mm (range, 0.0 to 4.1 mm) on the mesial and distal aspects, respectively. Analysis of variance revealed a significant difference in terms of bone loss between test A (thin) and B (thick) groups on both the mesial and the distal. CONCLUSION: Initial gingival tissue thickness at the crest may be considered as a significant influence on marginal bone stability around implants. If the tissue thickness is 2.0 mm or less, crestal bone loss up to 1.45 mm may occur, despite a supracrestal position of the implant-abutment interface.",M1
19853172,"Microtensile bond strength of new self-adhesive luting agents and conventional multistep systems.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Several self-adhesive luting agents have recently been introduced on the market. It is crucial to know the effectiveness of such luting agents prior to their clinical application. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the microtensile bond strengths (microTBS) produced by different self-adhesive <e>cements</e> and compare them with conventional luting agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Six self-adhesive cements (RelyX Unicem (UN), RelyX U100 (UC), SmartCem 2 (SC), G-Cem (GC), Maxcem (MC), and SeT (SET), and 2 conventional luting agents, one that uses a 2-step etch-and-rinse adhesive (RelyX ARC (RX)), and one that uses a 1-step self-etching adhesive (Panavia F (PF)), were used in this study. An additional group included the use of a 2-step self-etching primer adhesive system (Clearfil SE Bond) prior to the application of Panavia F (PS). Fifty-four human molars were abraded to expose occlusal surfaces and were assigned to 9 groups according to the luting material (n=6). Five composite resin (Filtek Z250) discs (12 mm in diameter, 5 mm thick) were cemented on the teeth according to manufacturers' instructions. After 24 hours of water storage, restored teeth were serially sectioned into beams with a cross-sectional area of approximately 1 mm2 at the bonded interface and were tested in tension with a crosshead speed of 1 mm/min. Failure mode was determined using scanning electron microscopy. Data were statistically analyzed by 1-way ANOVA and Tukey's studentized range HSD test (alpha =.05). RESULTS: Mean bond strengths (SD) in MPa were: RX, 69.6 (16.6)A; PS, 49.2 (9.7)A; PF, 33.7 (13.9)AB; GC, 16.9 (10.3)BC; UC, 15.3 (3.4)BC; UN, 12.5 (2.4)C; MC 11.5 (6.8)CD; SC, 8.5 (4.9)CD; SET, 4.6 (0.5)D. Groups with different uppercase letters were significantly different from each other (P&lt;.05). The predominant failure mode of the self-adhesive cements was adhesive between the resin cement and dentin. CONCLUSIONS: The bond strengths produced by the multistep luting agents were significantly higher than those observed for most self-adhesive cements.",M1
19849775,"Retention of zirconia copings on zirconia implant abutments cemented with provisional luting agents.The purpose of this study is to measure and compare the retentive force of zirconia-based all-ceramic crowns cemented on zirconia abutments using five provisional luting agents. In addition, the effect of sandblasting and thermocycling on the retentive force was evaluated. Two hundred zirconia abutments and copings were fabricated (Procera system; Nobel Biocare) and divided into five groups. Hy bond temporary <e>cement</e> hard (Hard), Hy bond temporary cement soft (Soft), experimental temporary cement (New), Tempbond NE (Temp) and Freegenool temporary pack (Pack) were used according to the manufacturers' instructions. Each group was divided into two groups, one with and one without sandblasting. Furthermore, thermocycling up to 2000 cycles was conducted on half of each group. After 24 h and thermocycling, the retentive force was measured using a universal testing machine. The data were subjected to analysis of variance, and comparisons of the means were performed with a Games-Howell test at a level of 95%. As a result, Hard showed the highest retentive force, sandblasting was effective for improving the durability, and no effect of sandblasting was detected in the others. New showed stability of the retentive force even after thermocycling. The retentive force of Temp and Pack decreased significantly after thermocycling even with sandblasting. The retentive forces were different from the provisional cement and sandblasting, and Temp and Pack may not be appropriate for the retention of single-tooth zirconia abutments and coping restorations.",M1
19846328,"Setting time and expansion in different soaking media of experimental accelerated calcium-silicate <e>cements</e> and ProRoot MTA.OBJECTIVES: The setting time and the expansion in deionized water, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), 20% fetal bovine serum (FBS)/80% PBS or hexadecane oil of experimental accelerated calcium-silicate cements and ProRoot MTA were evaluated. STUDY DESIGN: Different compounds such as sodium fluoride, strontium chloride, hydroxyapatite, and tricalcium phosphate were separately added to a basic experimental calcium-silicate cement to test their effect on setting and expansion. The initial and final setting times were determined using appropriate Gilmore needles. A linear variable differential transformer (LVDT) device was used to test the restricted hygroscopic linear expansion over 180 minutes of cements immersed in different solutions. Results were statistically compared using a 2-way ANOVA test (cement type versus solution type). RESULTS: All experimental cements showed initial setting times between 28 and 45 minutes and final setting times between 52 and 80 minutes. MTA showed a final setting time of 170 minutes. Final setting time of all experimental cements was faster than MTA. All cements showed slight (0.04%-0.77%) expansion in water, PBS, or FBS/PBS. Only fluoride-containing cement showed a significant expansion in water (6.68%) and in PBS (6.72%). The PBS/FBS contamination significantly reduced the expansion of fluoride-containing cement (2.98%) and MTA (0.07%). In contrast, cements showed a slight shrinkage when immersed in hexadecane, especially fluoride-containing cement. CONCLUSIONS: The study demonstrated that: (1) the setting time of calcium-silicate cements may be effectively reduced; (2) the expansion is a water dependent mechanism owing to water uptake, because no expansion occurred in cements immersed in oil; (3) a correlation between setting time and expansion in water and PBS exists; (4) fluorine-containing cement showed a significant expansion in water and in PBS; (5) the immersion in FBS/PBS strongly reduced the expansion of MTA and fluoride-doped cement suggesting that fluid contamination (ie, blood) during surgical procedures may greatly affect the expansion of some calcium-silicate cements.",M1
19811895,"Effect of biomedical organic compounds on the setting reaction of calcium phosphates.In the present study, the effect of biomedical organic compounds (starch, sodium alginate, chitosan and gelatin) on the hydration of calcium phosphates was studied using X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy and XPS analysis.

A solidification reaction occurred between ACP and dicalcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD); the hydration product was poorly crystallized hydroxyapatite (HA). During the setting reaction of ACP and DCPD, the presence of biomedical organic compounds had an effect on the hydration product: the bonding energies of the primary elements (Ca, P) in the hydration product (HA) were changed; also different hydration morphologies, self-setting properties, rheological properties and mechanical strength of the <e>cement</e> were obtained.

19801242,"Evaluation of selected properties of mineral trioxide aggregate sealer <e>cement</e>.INTRODUCTION: The addition of a water-soluble polymer to mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), which to date has been used primarily to seal lateral root perforations and as a root-end filling material, resulted in material that is suitable for use as an endodontic sealer. METHODS: MTA was mixed with water at powder/liquid ratios of 4 and 3.33 and an addition of 2 microL to 20 microL of water-soluble polymer. The materials were tested for flow and film thickness, and the optimal quantity of polymer required to conform to EN ISO 6876 Section 4.3.1, 4.3.4 (2002) was determined. The resultant MTA sealer was tested for radiopacity using methods suggested by ISO 6876 (2002) using pulp canal sealer (PCS) as control. The effect of polymer addition on the hydration characteristics of the MTA and calcium silicate cement was evaluated by assessing paste microstructure under the scanning electron microscope after 30 days and by collecting 50 quantitative analyses of the hydration products and plotting the data as atomic ratios. Plots of Al/Ca versus Si/Ca and S/Ca and Al/Ca were drawn. RESULTS: High additions of polymer were required for the flow and film thickness of MTA to conform to ISO 6876 (2002). The resultant cement sealer had a lower radiopacity than PCS but greater than the 3-mm thickness of Al specified by the international standard. The addition of polymer did not modify the hydration mechanism of MTA. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of a water-soluble polymer to MTA did not alter the hydration characteristics of the material and resulted in a material with improved properties suitable for use as endodontic sealer cement.",M1

METHODS: Three 3-dimensional finite element (FE) models designed with CAD/CAM ceramic onlay, endocrown, and conventional crown restorations were constructed to perform simulations. The Weibull function was incorporated with FE analysis to calculate the long-term failure probability relative to different load conditions. RESULTS: The results indicated that the stress values on the enamel, dentin, and luting <e>cement</e> for endocrown restoration were the lowest values relative to the other 2 restorations. Weibull analysis revealed that the individual failure probability in the endocrown enamel, dentin, and luting cement obviously diminished more than those for onlay and conventional crown restorations. The overall failure probabilities were 27.5%, 1%, and 1% for onlay, endocrown, and conventional crown restorations, respectively, in normal occlusal condition. CONCLUSIONS: This numeric investigation suggests that endocrown and conventional crown restorations for endodontically treated premolars with MODP preparation present similar longevity.",M1

White Pro-Root MTA (Dentsply, Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK) was used as a reference for comparison. METHODS: Fifty-six human maxillary incisor teeth were submitted to a step-back flaring technique and prepared for cytotoxicity assay in an in situ root-end filling experimental model. After retro filling, each root containing MTA, BioAggregate, or empty root canals (control) was exposed to culture media for 24, 48, or 72 hours, providing several extraction media. Mesenchymal cells were incubated with each extract medium for 24 hours, and toxicity was evaluated by three different parameters of cell survival and integrity on the same sample: XTT, neutral red, and crystal violet dye elution.

It is a formulation that has Portland cement in gel. However, there had not yet been any study evaluating its biologic properties. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the rat subcutaneous tissue response to CER and Angelus MTA. METHODS: The materials were placed in polyethylene tubes and implanted into dorsal connective tissue of Wistar rats for 7, 30, and 60 days. The specimens were prepared to be stained with hematoxylin-eosin or von Kossa or not stained for polarized light. The presence of inflammation, predominant cell type, calcification, and thickness of fibrous connective tissue were recorded. Scores were defined as follows: 0, none or few inflammatory cells, no reaction; 1, &lt;25 cells, mild reaction; 2, 25-125 cells, moderate reaction; 3, &gt;125 cells, severe reaction. Fibrous capsule was categorized as thin when thickness was &lt;150 mum and thick at &gt;150 mum. Necrosis and formation of calcification were both recorded. RESULTS: Both materials Angelus MTA and CER caused moderate reactions at 7 days, which decreased with time. The response was similar to the control at 30 and 60 days with Angelus MTA and CER, characterized by organized connective tissue and presence of some chronic inflammatory cells. Mineralization and granulations birefringent to polarized light were observed with both materials. CONCLUSIONS: It was possible to conclude that CER was biocompatible and stimulated mineralization.",M1
19782828,"Internal fit evaluation of crowns prepared using a new dental crown fabrication technique: laser-sintered Co-Cr crowns.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Difficulties encountered during casting of base metal dental alloys limit their use. Application of these alloys might be enhanced if new techniques are used. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to compare the internal fit of laser-sintered Co-Cr alloy crowns with base metal restorations prepared from another Co-Cr alloy and a Ni-Cr alloy using conventional casting techniques. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Internal fit of laser-sintered Co-Cr crowns was compared with the fit of conventionally cast Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloy crowns. Twelve crown-shaped specimens were prepared on a stainless steel die representing a prepared maxillary right central incisor for each group. Fit of crowns was evaluated using 2 different techniques: (1) weighing the light-body addition silicone that simulated a <e>cement</e> material, and (2) measuring the internal gap width on a die for longitudinally sectioned specimens. One-way ANOVA followed by Tukey multiple comparison test was used for statistical analysis (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Significantly higher mean (SD) light-body silicone weights (P&lt;.001) were observed in the laser-sintered Co-Cr alloy group (14.34 (1.67) mg) compared to the conventionally cast Ni-Cr alloy group (9.36 (1.97) mg) and Co-Cr alloy group (7.85 (1.19) mg). Mean internal gap widths (SDs) were 58.21 (19.92) microm, 50.55 (25.1) microm, and 62.57 (21.62) microm, respectively, for the cast Ni-Cr and Co-Cr alloy groups and the laser-sintered Co-Cr alloy group. No significant difference was observed between the 3 groups for internal gap widths (P=.42). CONCLUSIONS: Weighing the light-body addition silicone is a convenient method for evaluating the 3-dimensional internal fit of dental crowns. However, no significant difference was found among the 3 alloy groups evaluated for the internal gap width of sectioned crown specimens.",M1

Teeth were prepared to receive Class II MOD inlays with enamel gingival margins on 1 proximal surface and dentin gingival margins on the other surface. One hundred and twenty prepared teeth were divided into 3 groups of 40; 1 group for each resin cement: RelyX ARC, Variolink II, or Panavia 21. Each of the 3 groups were further divided into 4 dentin adhesive groups; Single Bond, ExciTE DSC, ED Primer, or Admira Bond. Each of the resin cements were used in combination with the 4 dentin adhesives, and IPS Empress ceramic inlays were placed with 12 different cement/adhesive combinations. After 1000 thermal cycles in a 5 degrees -55 degrees C water bath with a dwell time of 30 seconds, all specimens were subjected to cyclic axial mechanical loading. Then the restored teeth were stored in 0.5% basic fuchsin solution for 24 hours. The extent of dye penetration along the margins was measured with a stereomicroscope at x40 magnification. The data were evaluated statistically using repeated-measures ANOVA and Duncan tests (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Microleakage at dentin margins was greater than that at enamel margins (P&lt;.05) for all groups. Variolink II and RelyX ARC resin cements showed significantly lower microleakage results than Panavia 21 with all dentin adhesives in enamel margins. For dentin margins, Variolink II/Admira Bond combination showed the lowest microleakage value in dentin (P&lt;.05). CONCLUSIONS: The overall microleakage at the enamel margins was significantly less than at the dentin margins (P&lt;.05). Panavia 21 showed higher microleakage values than Variolink II and RelyX ARC in enamel margins.",M1
19782825,"Load fatigue of teeth with different ferrule lengths, restored with fiber posts, composite resin cores, and all-ceramic crowns.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: There is no evidence to suggest that the ferrule length needed for an all-ceramic crown is different from that needed for a cast metal or metal ceramic crown. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to relate different ferrule lengths with the number of fatigue cycles needed for failure of the crown <e>cement</e> for an all-ceramic crown cemented with a resin cement. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Fifteen maxillary central incisors were divided into 3 groups (n=5), with ferrules of 0.0 mm (no-ferrule group), 0.5 mm (0.5-mm ferrule group), and 1.0 mm (1.0-mm ferrule group), respectively. Each tooth was restored with a 0.050-inch glass-filled composite post (ParaPost FiberWhite) and a composite resin core (ParaCore). The posts were cemented with resin cement (ParaPost Cement), and the composite resin cores were bonded to dentin using a dentin bonding agent (ParaPost Cement, Conditioner A &amp; B). Each specimen was prepared with a 7-mm total preparation height, a 1.5-mm lingual axial wall, and a 1.0-mm shoulder around the tooth. The crowns for all specimens were pressed with a pressable ceramic material (IPS Empress 2) and cemented with resin cement (Variolink II). A 6-kg cyclic test load was applied to each specimen at 135 degrees to the long axis of the tooth. The independent variable measured was the number of load fatigue cycles required for failure of the crown cement. The data were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test to detect overall significance and the Mann-Whitney U test for pairwise comparisons with Bonferroni correction (alpha=.017). RESULTS: The mean (SD) number of cycles to failure for each group was: no-ferrule group, 213 (317); 0.5-mm ferrule group, 155,137 (68,991); and 1.0-mm ferrule group, 262,872 (21,432). None of the specimens in the 1.0-mm ferrule group failed. Significant differences were found between the no-ferrule group and the 0.5-mm ferrule group, and the no-ferrule group and the 1.0-mm ferrule group (P&lt;.017), but not between the 0.5-mm ferrule group and the 1.0-mm ferrule group (P&gt;.017). CONCLUSIONS: Specimens with a 0.0-mm ferrule survived few fatigue cycles despite the fact that both the post and crown were bonded with resin cement. Teeth with a 0.5-mm ferrule showed a significant increase in the number of fatigue cycles over the 0.0-mm group, whereas teeth with the 1.0-mm ferrule exhibited a significantly higher fatigue cycle count over the 0.0-mm but not the 0.5-mm group.",M1
19776512,"Comparative evaluation of antimicrobial activity of three <e>cements</e>: new endodontic cement (NEC), mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland.Using the agar diffusion method, we conducted an in vitro study to evaluate the antimicrobial activity of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA), new endodontic cement (NEC) and Portland cement at different concentrations against five different microorganisms. A base layer was made using Muller-Hinton agar for Escherichia coli (ATCC 10538) and Candida (ATCC 10231). For Actinomyces viscosus (ATCC 15987), Enterococcus faecalis (ATCC 10541) and Streptococcus mutans (ATCC 25175) blood agar medium was used. Wells were formed by removing the agar, and the materials were placed in the well immediately after manipulation. The plates were kept at room temperature for 2 h for prediffusion, and then incubated at 37 degrees C for 72 h. The inhibition zones were then measured. The data were analyzed using ANOVA and the Tukey test to compare the differences among the three cements at different concentrations. The positive controls showed bacterial growth, while the negative controls showed no bacterial growth. All materials showed antimicrobial activity against the tested strains except for Enterococcus faecalis. NEC created larger inhibition zones than MTA and Portland cement. This difference was significant for Portland cement (P &lt; 0.05), but not for MTA (P &gt; 0.05). Among the examined microorganisms, the largest inhibition zone was observed for Actinomyces group (P &lt; 0.05). The antimicrobial activity of the materials increased with time and concentration (P &lt; 0.05). It was concluded that NEC is a potent inhibitor of microorganism growth.",M1
19758259,"Effectiveness of bonding fiber posts to root canals and composite core build-ups.This study investigated the effects of fiber posts, silanization, and luting agents on the interfacial strength to root dentin and composite cores. Root canals of 120 crownless human teeth were instrumented. Three different posts (opaque and translucent), with and without silane treatment, were bonded using etch-and-rinse, self-etch, and self-adhesive luting agents. The restored roots were built up with dual-curing composite. After storage in water for 24 h at 37 degrees C, 2-mm-thick slices were cut from each sample: one from the composite core and one from the restored root. Interfacial push-out bond strengths of the posts were determined in a universal testing machine. Failure modes were analyzed using scanning electron microscopy. The post type and the luting agent had significant effects on both the post-to-dentin and post-to-core strengths. Silanization did not significantly influence post-to-dentin strengths, but enhanced post-to-core strengths. With etch-and-rinse luting agents, debonding occurred predominantly between the post and the <e>cement</e>, while the self-etch and self-adhesive luting agents showed more failures on root dentin. No failures occurred between the composite core and the cement. The combination of translucent posts and etch-and-rinse dual-curing luting agents can positively influence the retention of fiber posts in root canals. Silanization seems to be less relevant for intra-root canal bonding, but may have beneficial effects on post-to-core strengths.",M1
19744537,"The effect of different surface treatments on bond strength between leucite reinforced feldspathic ceramic and composite resin.OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of different surface treatments on the microtensile bond strength between a leucite reinforced glass-ceramic and composite resin. METHODS: Leucite reinforced ceramic blocks (n=24) were constructed using the hot pressing technique. The blocks were assigned to 4 groups, which received the following surface treatments: G1: hydrofluoric (HF) acid and silane; G2: silane alone; G3: HF acid and silane then dried with warm air (100 degrees C); G4: silane alone then dried with warm air (100 degrees C). Unfilled resin was applied, followed by composite resin. Specimens were prepared and loaded in tension to determine the microtensile bond strength. Failure modes were classified by stereo- and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Data was analysed using Kruskal-Wallis test followed by the Dunn's multiple range test. RESULTS: The groups including the warm air step (G3 and G4) achieved a significantly stronger adhesion than G1 and G2. Pre-treatment of the surface with hydrofluoric acid in G1 resulted in significantly higher bond strength than G2. Failures were mostly cohesive in the luting resin for G1, G3 and G4 and mainly adhesive at the ceramic-resin interface in G2. CONCLUSIONS: The method of application of silane to the ceramic surface can have a significant influence on the adhesion between the ceramic restoration and the resin <e>cement</e>. Enhancing the condensation reaction by drying the silane with a 100C warm air stream significantly improved the microtensile bond strength, possibly eliminating the need for the hydrofluoric acid etching step.",M1
19738942,"Rat subcutaneous tissue response to modified Portland <e>cement</e>, a new mineral trioxide aggregate.The purpose of this study was compare the biocompatibility of modified Portland cement (CPM) and mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) in a subcutaneous rat model. Twenty-four male Wistar rats were used. Three silicon tubes were placed on the dorsal subcutaneous tissue of each animal: one tube contained MTA, one tube contained CPM and the other was an empty tube. The rats were sacrificed in 3 groups of 8 animals at 7, 14 and 30 postoperative days, respectively. Tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin, embedded in paraffin, and serial sections were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Masson Trichrome and Luna's stain. At day 7, the empty tubes displayed a mild inflammatory infiltrate. In the CPM group, an inflammatory infiltrate was observed with some eosinophils and immature connective tissue. The MTA group showed a similar infiltrate without eosinophils and presence of abundant necrotic tissue and numerous multinucleate foreign body giant cells. At day 14, the chronic infiltrate with eosinophils persisted when in contact with CPM. In the MTA group, necrosis and distant giant cells could still be seen. At day 30, all 3 groups showed mature fibrous collagenous tissue. These findings indicate a different response to the materials evaluated in this study. Although, MTA and CPM induced a chronic inflammatory infiltrate, necrosis and multinucleated foreign body giant cells predominated in the MTA group, while in the CPM group numerous eosinophils were seen at all the observational periods.",M1
19737809,"Review paper: Role of aluminum in glass-ionomer dental <e>cements</e> and its biological effects.The role of aluminum in glass-ionomers and resin-modified glass-ionomers for dentistry is reviewed. Aluminum is included in the glass component of these materials in the form of Al(2)O(3) to confer basicity on the glass and enable the glass to take part in the acid-base setting reactions. Results of studies of these reactions by FTIR and magic-angle spinning (MAS)-NMR spectroscopy are reported and the role of aluminum is discussed in detail. Aluminum has been shown to be present in the glasses in predominantly 4-coordination, as well as 5- and 6-coordination, and during setting a proportion of this is converted to 6-coordinate species within the matrix of the cement. Despite this, mature cements may contain detectable amounts of both 4- and 5-coordinate aluminum. Aluminum has been found to be leached from glass-ionomer cements, with greater amounts being released under acidic conditions. It may be associated with fluoride, with which it is known to complex strongly. Aluminum that enters the body via the gastro-intestinal tract is mainly excreted, and only about 1% ingested aluminum crosses the gut wall. Calculation shows that, if a glass-ionomer filling dissolved completely over 5 years, it would add only an extra 0.5% of the recommended maximum intake of aluminum to an adult patient. This leads to the conclusion that the release of aluminum from either type of glass-ionomer cement in the mouth poses a negligible health hazard.",M1
19734458,"Biomimetic remineralization of resin-bonded acid-etched dentin.Degradation of denuded collagen within adhesive resin-infiltrated dentin is a pertinent problem in dentin bonding. A biomimetic remineralization scheme that incorporates non-classic crystallization pathways of fluidic amorphous nanoprecursors and mesoscopic transformation has been successful in remineralizing resin-free, acid-etched dentin, with evidence of intrafibrillar and interfibrillar remineralization. This study tested the hypothesis that biomimetic remineralization provides a means for remineralizing incompletely infiltrated resin-dentin interfaces created by etch-and-rinse adhesives. The remineralization medium consists of a Portland <e>cement</e>/simulated body fluid that includes polyacrylic acid and polyvinylphosphonic acid biomimetic analogs for amorphous calcium phosphate dimension regulation and collagen targeting. Both interfibrillar and intrafibrillar apatites became readily discernible within the hybrid layers after 2-4 months. In addition, intra-resin apatite clusters were deposited within the porosities of the adhesive resin matrices. The biomimetic remineralization scheme provides a proof-of-concept for the adoption of nanotechnology as an alternative strategy to extend the longevity of resin-dentin bonds.",M1
19723946,"Retention of metal-ceramic crowns with contemporary dental <e>cements</e>.BACKGROUND: New types of crown and bridge cement are in use by practitioners, and independent studies are needed to assess their effectiveness. The authors conducted a study in three parts (study A, study B, and study C) and to determine how well these new cements retain metal-ceramic crowns. METHODS: The authors prepared teeth with a 20-degree taper and a 4-millimeter length. They cast high-noble metal-ceramic copings, then fitted and cemented them with a force of 196 newtons. The types of cements they used were zinc phosphate, resin-modified glass ionomer, conventional resin and self-adhesive modified resin. They thermally cycled the cemented copings, then removed them. They recorded the removal force and calculated the stress of dislodgment by using the surface area of each preparation. They used a single-factor analysis of variance to analyze the data (alpha = .05). RESULTS: The mean stresses necessary to remove crowns, in megapascals, were 8.0 for RelyX Luting (3M ESPE, St. Paul, Minn.), 7.3 for RelyX Unicem (3M ESPE), 5.7 for Panavia F (Kuraray America, New York) and 4.0 for Fuji Plus (GC America, Alsip, Ill.) in study A; 8.1 for RelyX Luting, 2.6 for RelyX Luting Plus (3M ESPE) and 2.8 for Fuji CEM (GC America) in study B; and 4.9 for Maxcem (Kerr, Orange, Calif.), 4.0 for BisCem (Bisco, Schaumburg, Ill.), 3.7 for RelyX Unicem Clicker (3M ESPE), 2.9 for iCEM (Heraeus Kulzer, Armonk, N.Y.) and 2.3 for Fleck's Zinc Cement (Keystone Industries, Cherry Hill, N.J.) in study C. CONCLUSIONS: Powder-liquid versions of new cements were significantly more retentive than were paste-paste versions of the same cements. The mean value of crown removal stress for the new self-adhesive modified-resin cements varied appreciably among the four cements tested. All cements retained castings as well as or better than did zinc phosphate cement. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Powder-liquid versions of cements, although less convenient to mix, may be a better clinical choice when crown retention is an issue. All cements tested will retain castings adequately on ideal preparations because the corresponding removal stresses are comparable with or higher than those associated with zinc phosphate. Powder-liquid resin-modified glass ionomer cement, selected self-adhesive modified-resin cements and conventional resin cements provide additional retention when desired.",M1
19722787,"The positive relationship between excess <e>cement</e> and peri-implant disease: a prospective clinical endoscopic study.BACKGROUND: Cement-retained restorations are commonly used on dental implants. Residual excess cement after placement of fixed partial dentures has been associated with clinical and radiographic signs of peri-implant disease. The purpose of this study was to explore the relationship between excess dental cement and peri-implant disease using the dental endoscope. METHODS: Thirty-nine consecutive patients with implants exhibiting clinical and/or radiographic signs of peri-implant disease were studied. Patients were enrolled in the study during a 5-year period in a private periodontal practice. Twelve of these patients had similar implants without signs of inflammation; these implants served as controls. There were 20 controls and 42 test implants. All were evaluated using a dental endoscope initially, and all but one implant was evaluated at a 30-day follow-up. Results from both groups were assessed by two trained operators and recorded. RESULTS: None of the controls and all 42 of the test implants had clinical signs of peri-implant disease at initial treatment. Excess cement was found in none of the controls and 34 of the test sites. Thirty days after cement removal, 25 of 33 test sites from which the cement was removed had no clinical or endoscopic signs of inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: Excess dental cement was associated with signs of peri-implant disease in the majority (81%) of the cases. Clinical and endoscopic signs of peri-implant disease were absent in 74% of the test implants after the removal of excess cement.",M1
19716724,"Effect of radiopaque Portland <e>cement</e> on mineralization in human dental pulp cells.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to investigate whether radiopaque Portland cement (RPC) facilitates the mineralization process in human dental pulp cells (HDPCs) compared with pure Portland cement (PC). STUDY DESIGN: Under a scanning electron microscope (SEM), cellular morphology was evaluated. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity was analyzed, and nodule formation was assessed by performing Alizarin Red S staining. In addition, the mRNA expressions of mineralization-related proteins were evaluated by performing a real-time polymerase chain reaction. RESULTS: On SEM evaluation, healthy HDPCs were found adhering to the surfaces of PC and RPC. The ALP activity increased in the PC and RPC groups compared with the control group at 1 day. Alizarin Red stain increased in the PC and RPC groups compared with the control group at 2 and 3 weeks. The mRNA expression of dentin sialophosphoprotein increased at 14 days in the PC and RPC groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results show that PC and RPC have similar effects in terms of mineralization and suggest that RPC also has the potential to be used as a clinically suitable pulp-capping material.",M1

BACKGROUND: It has been suggested that cavity preparation using the Er:YAG laser has a potential for improving resistance to secondary caries on enamel. METHODS: Forty unerupted human third molars teeth were sectioned into 72 blocks of dental enamel and distributed into two groups to prepare cavities measuring (1.6 mm diameter) with diamond burs (DB) or Er:YAG laser (LA; 6 Hz, 300 mJ, 47 J/cm(2)). After that, each group was divided into three subgroups and restored with a glass-ionomer <e>cement</e> (GI), a resin-modified glass-ionomer (RM), or a composite resin (CR). Blocks were thermal cycled and submitted to a pH challenge to develop artificial caries-like lesions. Lesions were evaluated by Knoop microhardness test. An average of four indentations was used. Statistical analyses were performed by ANOVA followed by Tukey's test. RESULTS: The results (in Knoop hardness number) for DB cavity preparation were GI, 235.5 (+/-75.5); RM, 137.1 (+/-64.1); and CR, 39.3 (+/-26.5). For LA cavity preparation, the results were GI, 410.0 (+/-129.7); RM, 310.3 (+/-119.5); and CR, 96.4 (+/-57.4).

PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effect of tooth preparation height and luting agent on resistance form using unidirectional load fatigue testing. For a given tooth preparation with a clinically relevant total occlusal convergence (TOC), the adequacy of resistance form was investigated. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Sixty-four human maxillary premolars were prepared with occlusal-cervical dimensions of 2, 3,4, or 5 mm and a TOC of 20 degrees. Complete metal crowns were cemented using either zinc phosphate cement (HY Bond;ZP groups) or resin cement (Panavia F; PF groups). Cyclic load fatigue testing was done with an applied load of 6.0 kg at 2.6 Hz. Load cycles to preliminary failure were detected with a strain gauge at the palatal crown-tooth interface. Results were subjected to the Kruskal-Wallis test and the Wilcoxon post-hoc rank sum test (alpha=.05). RESULTS: Groups ZP4, ZP5, PF2, PF3, PF4, and PF5 had the highest mean number of cycles to preliminary failure,while group ZP2 had the lowest mean number of cycles to failure. Group ZP2 was significantly different (P&lt;.001) from all other test groups for the number of cycles to failure. Conclusions: For the 2- and 3-mm preparation height groups, zinc phosphate cement exhibited a poorer fatigue performance compared to Panavia F. There was no significant difference in the number of cycles to failure for groups ZP4,ZP5, PF2, PF3, PF4, and PF5. For both cements, the number of cycles to failure increased with increasing resistance length. (J Prosthet Dent 2009;102:155-164)",M1
19703621,"Effect of vital tooth bleaching on solubility and roughness of dental <e>cements</e>.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Vital tooth bleaching may affect properties of dental cements used for fixed prostheses. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to examine the effect of a combined in-office and at-home bleaching regimen on changes in surface roughness and depth loss of a variety of commercially available dental cements. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Five cement classifications were tested: glass ionomer, resin-modified glass ionomer, resin,self-adhesive resin cement, and zinc phosphate. Cements were placed in multiple wells in plastic blocks. After setting,the surface profile of each block was determined, and average roughness and vertical height of cement surface from the specimen holder were recorded. Blocks were water stored (control) or subjected to in-office and at-home bleaching(n=12). Surfaces were rescanned and pre- and posttest parameter changes were calculated. Statistical analysis consisted of Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon Rank Sum and Student t tests applied to control and bleaching parameterc hanges within the same cements. A family-wise alpha of .05 was maintained by using a Bonferroni-adjusted level of significance preset to .01 per test. RESULTS: Zinc phosphate showed the only significant depth increase (P=.004) from bleaching: 0.9 +/- 0.7 microm deeper than the water-control group. Only resin-modified glass ionomer showed a significant (P=.004) increase in roughness from bleaching; values increased by 0.05 +/- 0.03 microm over the water-control group. CONCLUSIONS: In-office and at-home bleaching significantly increased depth loss of zinc phosphate and increased resinmodified glass ionomer roughness. However, the absolute values of differences observed, as compared to the wateronly control, were considered to be clinically insignificant. (J Prosthet Dent 2009;102:148-154)",M1

White mineral trioxide aggregate (WMTA) and PC without radiopacifier were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. STUDY DESIGN: Following International Organization for Standardization (ISO) 6876/2001, 5 circular specimens (10 x 1 mm) were made from each material. After the materials set, radiographs were taken using occlusal film and a graduated aluminum step-wedge varying in thickness from 2 to 16 mm. The dental X-ray unit (GE1000) was set at 50 Kvp, 10 mA, 18 pulses/s, and distance of 33.5 cm. The radiographs were digitized, and radiopacity was compared with the aluminum step-wedge, using Wixwin-2000 software (Gendex). Data (mm Al) were analyzed using analysis of variance and Tukey tests.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: One hundred and eighty crowns were prepared from bovine teeth using a lathe. Ceramic crowns were prepared from three types of ceramic systems: an alumina-infiltrated ceramic, a lithia-disilicate-based glass ceramic, and a leucite-reinforced ceramic. For each ceramic system, 30 crowns were cemented with a composite resin cement, and the remaining 30 with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement. For each ceramic system and cement, ten specimens were loaded to fracture without fatiguing. A second group (n = 10) was subjected to cyclic fatigue and fracture tested in a dry environment, and a third group (n = 10) was fatigued and fractured in distilled water. The results were statistically analyzed using one-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD test. RESULTS: The fracture loads of ceramic crowns decreased significantly after cyclic fatigue loading (p&lt;or= 0.05); furthermore, fracture loads of crowns fatigued in a wet environment were statistically lower than those in a dry environment (p &lt; 0.05). Crowns luted with a composite resin cement showed statistically greater fracture loads than those luted with a resin-modified glass ionomer cement (p&lt;or= 0.05).

Materials and METHODS: The root canals of 70 single-rooted bovine teeth (16 mm-length) were prepared to 9 mm using the preparation drill of a double-tapered glass fiber post system (White Post DC, FGM). Each specimen was embedded in a plastic cylinder using acrylic resin up to 3 mm of the most coronal portion of the specimen and allocated into one of seven groups (n=10) based on strategies for cementation: Gr1-ScotchBond Multi Purpose plus (SBMP) + Relyx ARC resin <e>cement</e>; Gr2-Single Bond + Relyx ARC; Gr3-ED Primer + Panavia F resin cement; Gr4-SBMP + AllCem resin cement; Gr5-Relyx ARC; Gr6-Relyx Unicem resin cement; Gr7-Relyx Luting 2 glass ionomer cement. After cementation, the specimens were stored for seven days (in a humid environment at 37 degrees C) and submitted to pullout bond strength testing (the inferior part of each specimen was fixed and the fiber post was pulled out). The data (Kgf) were submitted to statistical analysis (one-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey tests, alpha=.05). The tested specimens were analyzed under the microscope and SEM for fracture analysis. RESULTS: The strategy for post cementation affected the pullout retentive strength (Kgf) (p&lt;0.0001) significantly. Gr6 (37.7 +/- 8a), Gr1 (37.4 +/- 5.7a) and Gr4 (31.6 +/- 6.6ab) presented the highest pullout bond strengths. Gr2 (12.2 +/- 5.6c), Gr3 (6.5 +/- 5.2c) and Gr7 (5.1 +/- 2.8c) presented the lowest pullout bond strengths. Gr5 (24.2 +/- 7.4b) was similar to Gr4 and inferior to Gr6 and Gr1. CONCLUSION: The use of a three-step etch-&amp;-rinse adhesive system appears to be effective. The application of other adhesive systems (single-bottle etch-&amp;-rinse and self-etch adhesive systems) did not present high pullout strength values. The simplified self-adhesive resin cement (without adhesive application) presented good retentive performance. Further studies should be conducted.",M1

Deciduous molars with acute carious lesions in the inner half of dentin and vital pulp were randomly divided into two groups of 16: complete removal, in which the carious dentin was completely removed with the help of a caries detector dye, and partial removal, in which the carious dentin was completely removed from the dentinoenamel junction and lateral walls, while the necrotic carious dentin from the cavity floor was only removed superficially. Dentin samples were obtained with a sterile No. 3 bur after caries removal and 3-6 months after protection with calcium hydroxide <e>cement</e> and restoration of the cavities with resin composite. The samples were stored in thioglycolate. Decimal dilutions were then prepared and seeded for the enumeration of Streptococcus spp., mutans streptococci, Lactobacillus spp. and total microorganisms. Before sealing, a larger number of microorganisms was detected in teeth submitted to partial caries removal compared to the complete removal group. However, after sealing the level of colonization was similar in the two groups for all microorganisms studied. The results suggest that persistence of bacteria does not seem to be a reason for reopening of cavities in deciduous teeth after partial caries removal.",M1
19639070,"Retention of gold alloy crowns cemented with traditional and resin <e>cements</e>.The aim of this study was to measure in vitro retention of cast gold crowns cemented with traditional and resin cements. Forty-eight human molars were prepared on a lathe to produce complete crown preparations with a consistent taper and split into six groups, eight crowns in each group. Crowns were cast in a high-gold alloy and then cemented. After 24 hours, the retention force (N) was recorded and mean values were analyzed by one-way analysis of variance and the Fisher post-hoc least significant difference (PLSD) multiple comparisons test (a = .05). Failure sites were examined under 3100 magnification and recorded. Mean values (SD) for each group in increasing order of retention force were: Harvard Cement: 43 N (27), TempoCem: 59 N (16), PermaCem Dual: 130 N (42), RelyX Luting Cement: 279 N (26), Contax and PermaCem Dual: 286 N (38), and TempoCem with Contax and PermaCem Dual: 340 N (14). The Fisher PLSD interval (P = .05) for comparing cements was 29 N. Zinc-phosphate cement and provisional resin cements had the lowest retention forces. Resin cement with a bonding agent and the hybrid-ionomer cement had similar retention forces. Resin cement with a bonding agent applied after use of a provisional resin cement had a significantly higher retention force than the other cements tested.",M1
19629145,"Pulpotomy of human primary molars with MTA and Portland <e>cement</e>: a randomised controlled trial.OBJECTIVE: This study compared the clinical and radiographic effectiveness of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland cement (PC) as pulp dressing agents in carious primary teeth. METHODOLOGY: Thirty carious primary mandibular molars of children aged 5-9 years old were randomly assigned to MTA or PC groups, and treated by a conventional pulpotomy technique. The teeth were restored with resin modified glass ionomer cement. Clinical and radiographic successes and failures were recorded at 6, 12, 18 and 24-month follow-up. RESULTS: All pulpotomised teeth were clinically and radiographically successful at all follow-up appointments. Six out of 15 teeth in the PC group and five out of 14 teeth in the MTA group exfoliated throughout the follow-up period. No statistically significant difference regarding dentine bridge formation was found between both groups throughout the follow-up period. As far as pulp canal obliteration is concerned, a statistically significant difference was detected at 6-month follow-up (p &lt;0.05), since the beginning of mineralised material deposition could be radiographically detected in 100% and 57.14% of the teeth treated with PC and MTA, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: PC may serve as an effective and less expensive MTA substitute in primary molar pulpotomies. Further studies and longer follow-up assessments are needed.",M1
19627674,"Understanding mineral trioxide aggregate/Portland-<e>cement</e>: a review of literature and background factors.AIM: This was to carry out a review of the literature concerning mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland cement with regards to clinical, biological and mechanical findings and a possible substitution of MTA through Portland cement for endodontic use. STUDY DESIGN: Electronic literature search of scientific papers from January 1993 to January 2009 was carried out on the MEDLINE and Scopus databases using specific key words. In total, 57 papers were identified that dealt with MTA and Portland cement in a relevant way. RESULTS: The review of 50 papers conforming to the applied criteria showed that MTA and Portland cements have the same clinical, biological and mechanical properties. In animal experiments and technical characterisations both materials seemed to have very similar properties. The only difference is bismuth oxide in MTA added for better radio opacity. It seems likely that MTA materials are based on industrial Portland cements mixed with bismuth oxide. More studies, especially some long-term studies comparing MTA and Portland cement, are necessary. CONCLUSION: The existing literature gives a solid base for clinical studies with Portland cement in order to replace MTA as an endodontic material. Portland cement could be a substitute for most endodontic materials used in primary teeth.",M1
19627358,"Push-out stress for fibre posts luted using different adhesive strategies.The influence of thermocycling on the bond strength of fibre posts cemented with different luting approaches was investigated. A total of 84 human incisors were selected for the study. Sixty teeth were assigned to one of the following adhesive/<e>cement</e> combinations for push-out bond-strength evaluation: group 1, XP Bond/CoreXFlow + DT Light-Post; group 2, Panavia F 2.0 + Tech 21; or group 3, RelyX Unicem + RelyX. Bonded specimens were cut into 1-mm-thick slabs and either thermocycled (40,000 cycles) or stored in artificial saliva (control specimens) before push-out bond-strength testing. Additional specimens were processed for quantitative interfacial nanoleakage analysis. Thermocycling decreased the bond strength in specimens of groups 2 and 3, but did not affect the specimens from group 1. No difference was observed among luting approaches in control specimens. Thermocycling resulted in increased silver nitrate deposition (i.e. interfacial nanoleakage) in all groups. Within the limitations of the study, the use of an etch-and-rinse adhesive in combination with a dual-cure cement to lute fiber posts is the most stable luting procedure if compared with a self-etch resin-based cement or a self-adhesive cement, as assayed by thermocycling of the bonded specimens.",M1
19583764,"Fluid flow after resin-composite restoration in extracted carious teeth.The aim of this study was to investigate fluid flow in dentin after restoration of carious teeth with resin composite bonded with a total-etching adhesive, with or without glass-ionomer <e>cement</e> lining. The roots of extracted third molars were removed and the crowns were connected to a fluid flow-measuring device. Each carious lesion was stained with caries detector dye and caries was removed using slow-speed burs and spoon excavators. Caries-excavated teeth were divided into two groups for restoration with resin composite bonded with a total-etch adhesive: (i) without lining; and (ii) lined with glass-ionomer cement before bonding. In non-carious teeth, cavities of similar dimensions were prepared, divided into two groups, and restored in the same manner. Fluid flow was recorded, after restoration, for up to 1 month. Caries-affected dentin was examined by scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and the bonded interfaces were observed using a confocal laser scanning microscope. No significant difference in fluid flow was observed between the two restorative procedures or between the carious and non-carious groups. The SEM images showed that the dentinal tubules of acid-etched, caries-affected dentin were usually still occluded, while some were patent. Limited penetration of fluorescent dye into dentin and into the bonded interfaces of restored carious teeth was observed.",M1
19581720,"Improved bond performance of a dental adhesive system using nano-technology.Since adhesive technology was introduced into dental field, metal-based restoration has been gradually replaced by metal-free restoration. Using the adhesive technology, minimum invasive technique has been possible in daily clinical practice as well as esthetic tooth-colored restorations have become very popular all over the world.One of the current issues of the dental adhesive is durability of bond between tooth structure and adhesive resin. Several approaches to overcome the issues have been carried out. Self-etching approach is believed to create durable bond because demineralization of superficial tooth surface is very shallow. Other approach is to utilize the inhibitor of enzymes which are suggested to catalyze the decomposition of resin composites and are always secreted within the oral environment.In the present study, Colloidal Platinum Nanoparticles (CPN) was applied before the application of 4-META/MMA-TBB resin <e>cement</e> as the third possibility to prolong the durability of bond. This implies that the use of the CPN solution would create higher conversion at the interface compared with conventional bonding procedures.",M1

19550090,"Radiopacity of conventional, resin-modified glass ionomer, and resin-based luting materials.The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the radiopacity of currently available dental luting materials. Five conventional <e>cements</e>, six resin-modified glass ionomers (RMGIs), two methyl methacrylate (MMA)-based acrylic resins (eight shades), and nine composite luting materials were evaluated. Radiographs of the specimens were taken together with tooth slices and aluminum step wedges. The density of the specimens was determined with a densitometer and was expressed in terms of the equivalent thickness of aluminum per 2.0-mm unit thickness of specimen. The radiopacity values for human enamel and dentin were 4.3 and 2.3 mm Al/2.0 mm specimen, respectively. The values for materials ranged from 5.1 to 12.9 for conventional luting materials, from 3.4 to 6.3 for RMGIs, from less than 0.5 to 7.3 for MMA resins, and from 2.3 to 9.9 for the composite luting materials. A zinc phosphate cement showed the highest value (12.9), whereas five shades of MMA resin resulted in the lowest value (less than 0.5). Two RMGIs and three composite luting materials exhibited radiopacity values between those of enamel (4.3) and dentin (2.3). It can be concluded that the radiopacity value of luting materials varies considerably, and that care must be taken when selecting luting materials, considering the material composition of restorations.",M1
19548010,"Clinical and microbiological performance of resin-modified glass-ionomer liners after incomplete dentine caries removal.The aims of this study were to evaluate clinically and microbiologically the effects of two resin-modified glass-ionomer <e>cements</e> (RMGICs) used as liners after incomplete dentine caries removal and to identify Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus strains isolated from dentine samples, before and after indirect pulp treatment. Twenty-seven primary molars with deep carious lesions, but without signs and symptoms of irreversible pulpitis, were submitted to indirect pulp treatment. Treatment consisted of incomplete excavation of the carious dentine, application of one of the RMGICs (Vitrebond or Fuji Lining LC) or calcium hydroxide cement (Dycal), and sealing for 3 months. Clinical evaluation (consistency, color, and wetness of dentine) and carious dentine collects were performed before temporary sealing and after the experimental period. Microbiological samples were cultivated in specific media for subsequent counting of mutans streptococci (MS) and lactobacilli (LB). MS colonies were selected for identification of S. mutans and S. sobrinus by polymerase chain reaction. After 3 months, the remaining dentine was hard and dry, and there was a significant decrease in the number of MS and LB, in all groups, although complete elimination was not achieved in 33% and 26% of the teeth for MS and LB, respectively. From 243 MS colonies selected, 216 (88.9%) were identified as S. mutans and only 2 (0.8%) as S. sobrinus. The use of resin-modified glass-ionomer liners after incomplete caries removal, as well as a calcium hydroxide cement, promoted significant reduction of the viable residual cariogenic bacteria in addition to favorable clinical changes in the remaining carious dentine.",M1
19544816,"Bond strength of resin <e>cements</e> to a zirconia ceramic with different surface treatments.This study evaluated the influence of surface treatments and metal primers on the bond strength of resin cements to a yttrium-stabilized tetragonal zirconia (Y-TZP) ceramic. Two-hundred and forty plates of Y-TZP ceramic were randomly assigned to 24 groups (n = 10) according to the combination of surface treatment (none, air abrasion with Al2O3 particles, Er:YAG laser irradiation), metal primer (none, Alloy Primer, Metal Primer II or Metaltite) and resin cement (Calibra [Bis-GMA-based] or Panavia F2.0 [MDP-based]). Fragments of dentin with a cylindrical edge (0.8 mm in diameter) were fixed to ceramic surfaces with the resin cements. The micro-shear bond test was carried out at a 1 mm/minute speed until failure, and the ceramic surfaces were examined after debonding. Bond strengths were analyzed through three-way ANOVA/Tukey test with a 5% significance level. Changes in topography after surface treatments were evaluated with scanning electron microscopy. Surface treatments significantly modified the topography of the Y-TZP ceramic. Air abrasion resulted in increased bond strength for both resin cements. However, air abraded and laser irradiated specimens presented higher bond strength with the Bis-GMA-based resin cement than with the MDP-based cement. Both cements presented similar behavior on untreated surfaces. The three metal primers yielded a significant increase in bond strength, regardless of the surface treatment and resin cement. Adhesive failures were the most prevalent. Air abrasion with Al2O3 particles and the application of metal primers increased bond strength to Y-TZP surfaces for both resin cements.",M1

Forty incisors were divided into 4 groups: (1) white-MTA, (2) calcium aluminate cement, and (3) positive and (4) negative control group. Falcon tubes were prepared for this experiment, divided into 2 separated chambers; the lower part was filled with RTF-transport media so that only the root apex was in contact with the transport media, whereas the coronal part was immersed in BHI containing Enterococcus faecalis to investigate bacterial microleakage. The evaluated materials used as root canal filling materials showed an absence of microbial growth. Both materials when used as the root canal filling were efficient in sealing root canals and preventing E. faecalis microleakage for the 30-day evaluation period using an in vitro model.",M1

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty teeth of two 3-month old pigs were capped with these materials. Three weeks later, the animals were killed and the specimens were prepared for histological examination and evaluation of inflammatory cell response, tissue disorganization, hard tissue formation and bacteria presence was performed. The data collected from the histological examinations were statistically analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Dunn multiple comparison tests. RESULTS: There was no significant difference between ss-TCP, WMTA, WPC and CH in terms of primary pulp response, hard tissue formation and normal pulp tissue preservation.

19515165,"Sealing ability of three fiber dowel systems.PURPOSE: To study the sealing ability of two new fiber dowel systems. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-six extracted single-rooted teeth were endodontically treated and randomly assigned to two new fiber dowel systems and a control group: (1) an E-glass-based dowel, everStick-POST, cemented with ParaCem Universal DC resin <e>cement</e> (EV); (2) a glass-fiber dowel, RelyX Fiber Post, cemented with RelyX Unicem self-adhesive resin cement (RX). The control group was restored with a glass-fiber dowel, ParaPost Fiber Lux, cemented with ParaCem Universal DC resin cement (PP). The roots were isolated and immersed in a 50 wt% ammoniacal silver nitrate solution for 24 hours followed by 8 hours in a photo-developing solution. The roots were sectioned in 1-mm-thick disks perpendicular to the long axis of the root. The specimens were processed for backscattered FESEM observation. For each tooth, the depth of silver infiltration into the root canal was measured by ranks from 0 to 8. For each disk, silver infiltration was measured as the percentage of leakage around the adhesive interface. Data were analyzed with Kruskal-Wallis nonparametric tests at a significance level of 95%. RESULTS: When the silver infiltration was computed from the coronal to the apical aspects of the root, RX resulted in the lowest degree of silver infiltration, but not statistically different from that of EV (p &lt; 0.148). RX, however, resulted in a lower depth of silver infiltration than the control group PP at p &lt; 0.023. EV resulted in a statistically similar depth of penetration to PP (p= 0.492). Although the total mean percentage of silver infiltration at the dentin-resin cement interface was statistically similar for all groups (p= 0.632), EV resulted in the greater number of disks with silver infiltration (23 out of 96), followed by PP (21 out of 96) and RX (14 out of 96). None of the specimens showed leakage around the dowel-resin cement interface. CONCLUSION: The use of the E-glass dowels in EV did not improve the root-wall sealing ability compared with the control group PP. The system RX, which uses a new simplified self-adhesive protocol, resulted in a lower depth of silver infiltration than the control group PP.",M1
19482192,"Negligible expression of arsenic in some commercially available brands of Portland <e>cement</e> and mineral trioxide aggregate.INTRODUCTION: This study was designed aiming to determine and compare the amount of arsenic in some brands of mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) and Portland cement. METHODS: In the present study, arsenic species (As[III], As[V], and dimethylarsinic acid) were separated by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) using a strong anion exchange column and converted into arsines by online HG. The instrumental coupling, HPLC-HG-AFS, was applied to 0.2 g of each cement that was prior digested in a solution of HCl, HNO(3), and HBF(4). Data were expressed as a part per million, and the preliminary analysis of the raw pooled data revealed a bell-shaped distribution. Statistical analysis was performed using one-way analysis of variance for multiple comparisons. RESULTS: In all chromatograms obtained, only type III arsenic could be detected. The minimum amount of arsenic was detected in samples of white MTA ProRoot (3.3 x 10-4) and the maximum in the samples MTA Bio Angelus (Angelus, Londrina, PR, Brazil) (8.6 x 10-4). In the Gray MTA (Angelus), gray ProRoot MTA (Tulsa/Dentsply, Tulsa, OK) and CP Juntalider (Brasilatex Ltda, Diadema, SP, Brazil) did not detect any trace of arsenic. The values of arsenic found in CP Irajazinho (Votorantim Cimentos, Rio Branco, SP, Brazil) and white MTA Angelus were intermediaries to minimum and maximum values. The nonparametric test Kruskal-Wallis showed statistically similar results among all cements tested (p &gt; 0.5). CONCLUSIONS: Overall, the present study showed that all cements showed insignificant amounts of type III arsenic as well as no trace of arsenic DMA and type V could be detected.",M1
19481792,"Phosphoric acid esters cannot replace polyvinylphosphonic acid as phosphoprotein analogs in biomimetic remineralization of resin-bonded dentin.Polyvinylphosphonic acid (PVPA), a biomimetic analog of phosphoproteins, is crucial for recruiting polyacrylic acid (PAA)-stabilized amorphous calcium phosphate nanoprecursors during biomimetic remineralization of dentin collagen matrices. This study tested the null hypothesis that phosphoric acid esters of methacrylates in dentin adhesives cannot replace PVPA during bimimetic remineralization of resin-dentin interfaces. Human dentin specimens were bonded with: (I) XP Bond, an etch-and-rinse adhesive using moist bonding; (II) XP Bond using dry bonding; (III) Adper Prompt L-Pop, a self-etching adhesive. The control medium contained only set Portland <e>cement</e> and a simulated body fluid (SBF) without any biomimetic analog. Two experimental Portland cement/SBF remineralization media were evaluated: the first contained PAA as the sole biomimetic analog, the second contained PAA and PVPA as dual biomimetic analogs. No remineralization of the resin-dentin interfaces could be identified from specimens immersed in the control medium. After 2-4 months in the first experimental medium, specimens exhibited either no remineralization or large crystal formation within hybrid layers. Only specimens immersed in the second remineralization medium produced nanocrystals that accounted for intrafibrillar remineralization within hybrid layers. The null hypothesis could not be rejected; phosphoric acid esters in dentin adhesives cannot replace PVPA during biomimetic remineralization of adhesive-bonded dentin.",M1

This modification in appliance attachment revolutionized orthodontics. Before, each tooth required a band. This meant a band must be fitted, have a bracket welded to it, and be cemented onto each tooth.

Many cases that perhaps could have been treated without tooth extraction ended up needing extractions to accommodate the band space.",M1
19451009,"Evaluation of pH and calcium ion release of new root-end filling materials.OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the pH and calcium ion release of 6 materials used for root-end filling and perforation repair.

After 3, 24, 72, and 168 hours the water in which each sample had been immersed was tested to determine the ph and calcium ion release. RESULTS: All the analyzed materials showed alkaline pH and capacity to release calcium ions; however, a tendency of reduction of these characteristics was noted for all the analyzed materials, except for the MBPc, which showed a slight increase of pH among the 3 initial periods. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that all materials investigated presented alkaline pH and ability of release of calcium ions.",M1
19415231,"Preparation and evaluation of an experimental luting glass ionomer <e>cement</e> to be used in dentistry.The aim of this paper is to compare the fluoride-releasing and mechanical properties of an experimental luting glass ionomer cement, which has a modified composition and a commercial luting cement. The experimental powder was obtained by sol-gel process and then, it was used to prepare the experimental cements. The properties of cement pastes, such as setting time and working time, microhardness and diametral tensile strength were determined. Fluoride release from GICs was evaluated at time intervals of 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days in deionized water. Atomic force microscopy (AFM) analyses showed that the surface of the experimental cements is more homogeneous than commercial GICs. The mechanical properties and the measure of liberation of fluoride of the two cements were influenced by ratio powder:liquid and chemical composition of the precursor powders. Experimental cements released less fluoride than commercial cements. However, this liberation was more constant during the analyzed period. Thus, the results obtained in this study indicated that the composition of the experimental powder modified by the niobium can lead the formation of the polysalt matrix with good mechanical properties. In other words, we can say that experimental powder offered considerable promise for exploitation in dental field.",M1
19410095,"Radiopacity of portland <e>cement</e> associated with different radiopacifying agents.This study evaluated the radiopacity of Portland cement associated with the following radiopacifying agents: bismuth oxide, zinc oxide, lead oxide, bismuth subnitrate, bismuth carbonate, barium sulfate, iodoform, calcium tungstate, and zirconium oxide. A ratio of 20% radiopacifier and 80% white Portland cement by weight was used for analysis. Pure Portland cement and dentin served as controls. Cement/radiopacifier and dentin disc-shaped specimens were fabricated, and radiopacity testing was performed according to the ISO 6876/2001 standard for dental root sealing materials. Using Insight occlusal films, the specimens were radiographed near to a graduated aluminum stepwedge varying from 2 to 16 mm in thickness. The radiographs were digitized and radiopacity compared with the aluminum stepwedge using Digora software (Orion Corporation Soredex, Helsinki, Finland). The radiographic density data were converted into mmAl and analyzed statistically by analysis of variance and Tukey-Kramer test (alpha = 0.05). The radiopacity of pure Portland cement was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) than that of dentin, whereas all cement/radiopacifier mixtures were significantly more radiopaque than dentin and Portland cement alone (p &lt; 0.05). Portland cement/bismuth oxide and Portland cement/lead oxide presented the highest radiopacity values and differed significantly from the other materials (p &lt; 0.05), whereas Portland cement/zinc oxide presented the lowest radiopacity values of all mixtures (p &lt; 0.05). All tested substances presented higher radiopacity than that of dentin and may potentially be added to the Portland cement as radiopacifying agents. However, the possible interference of the radiopacifiers with the setting chemistry, biocompatibility, and physical properties of the Portland cement should be further investigated before any clinical recommendation can be done.",M1
19410094,"Biomineralization ability and interaction of mineral trioxide aggregate and white portland <e>cement</e> with dentin in a phosphate-containing fluid.INTRODUCTION: Mineral trioxide aggregate (MTA) has been shown to be bioactive because of its ability to produce biologically compatible carbonated apatite. This study analyzed the interaction of MTA and white Portland cement with dentin after immersion in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). METHODS: Dentin disks with standardized cavities were filled with ProRoot MTA, MTA Branco, MTA BIO, white Portland cement + 20% bismuth oxide (PC1), or PC1 + 10% of calcium chloride (PC2) and immersed in 15 mL of PBS for 2 months. The precipitates were weighed and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and x-ray diffraction. The calcium ion release and pH of the solutions were monitored at 5, 15, 25, and 35 days. The samples were processed for SEM observations. Data were analyzed by using analysis of variance or Kruskall-Wallis tests. RESULTS: Our findings revealed the presence of amorphous calcium phosphate precipitates with different morphologies. The apatite formed by the cement-PBS system was deposited within collagen fibrils, promoting controlled mineral nucleation on dentin, observed as the formation of an interfacial layer with tag-like structures. CONCLUSIONS: All the cements tested were bioactive. The cements release some of their components in PBS, triggering the initial precipitation of amorphous calcium phosphates, which act as precursors during the formation of carbonated apatite. This spontaneous precipitation promotes a biomineralization process that leads to the formation of an interfacial layer with tag-like structures at the cement-dentin interface.",M1
19365350,"[Effect of calcium hydroxide based desensitizing agent on cast crown retention]A layer of desensitizing agent for prepared teeth was applied to tooth stump prior to the final cementation of cast crowns in order to alleviate postoperative sensibility. The aim of the study was to establish under in vitro conditions whether the application of the suspension of calcium hydroxide (Kaviner) on prepared teeth decreased the cast crown bonding strength. 40 intact human premolars were extracted for orthodontic reasons and prepared by high capacity machine using water supply cooling. Experimental crowns were made by a standard procedure using NiCrMo alloy and cemented by zinc phosphate or glass ionomer luting <e>cements</e> (20 in each group). Bond strength between prepared teeth and crowns was mechanically tested by using electronic dynamometer, at first without suspension of calcium hydroxide and then after its application. The results obtained pointed to decrease of bonding strength with both used luting cements: decrease of retention force with zinc phosphate cement was equal to 1.9% and with glass ionomer cement - 4.2%. However, the retention forces values obtained after the application of Kaviner for both dental cements observed were still clinically acceptable.",M1
19357616,"Effect of coronal macroretentions and diameter of a glass-FRC on fracture resistance of bovine teeth restored with fiber posts.AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate fracture resistance of bovine teeth restored with glass fiber posts of different diameter and shape. METHODS: Eighty single-rooted bovine teeth were prepared, embedded in a PVC cylinder using acrylic resin, and allocated into eight groups (N.=10) based on the post diameter (White Post DC) and shape: smooth double-tapered fiber post -- G1, G2, G3, and G4 with cervical diameters of 1.4 mm, 1.6 mm, 1.8 mm, and 2 mm, respectively; double-tapered fiber post with coronal macroretentions -- G5, G6, G7, and G8 with cervical diameters of 1.4 mm, 1.6 mm, 1.8 mm, and 2 mm, respectively. A three-step etch-and.rinse adhesive and resin <e>cement</e> system was used for postcementation. Afterwards, the core build-up was standardized with composite resin (Oppalis). The specimens were stored for seven days and later submitted to monotonic load at a crosshead speed of 0.05 cm/min (45 degrees ) until failure. The fracture loads were determined and the fracture mode was recorded. RESULTS: The post diameter (P=0.0007) and post-surface characteristic (P=0.0149) factors affected the fracture resistance results significantly (2-way ANOVA). Low fracture strength values were noted in the group with narrower diameter and macroretentions (G5). The macroretentions damaged the fracture resistance results when post diameter was 1.4 mm (G1 and G5). On fiber posts having diameters of 1.6 mm, 1.8 mm, and 2 mm, macroretentions did not impair fracture strengths significantly. CONCLUSIONS: A direct relation between the diameter of the fiber post and the fracture strength seems likely. Coronal macroretentions reduced fracture strength in thinner fiber posts.",M1
19345803,"The influence of calcium chloride on the setting time, solubility, disintegration, and pH of mineral trioxide aggregate and white Portland <e>cement</e> with a radiopacifier.This study evaluated the influence of addition of 10% calcium chloride (CaCl(2)) on the setting time, solubility, disintegration, and pH of white MTA (WMTA) and white Portland cement (WPC). A test of the setting time was performed following the #57 ADA specifications and a test of the final setting time according to the ASTM. For the solubility tests disintegration and pH, Teflon rings were filled with the cements and weighed after setting. After 24 h in a desiccator, they were once again weighed. Thereafter, they were immersed in MiliQ water for 24 and 72 h and 7, 14, and 28 days, with maintenance in the desiccator and weighing between periods. The pH of water in which the rings were immersed was measured immediately after contact with them and in the other periods. The addition of CaCl(2) provided a significant reduction (50%) in the initial setting time of cements. The final setting time of WMTA was reduced in 35.5% and the final setting time of WPC in 68.5%. The WMTA with CaCl(2) absorbed water and gained weight with time, except for in the 24-h period. The addition of CaCl(2) to the WPC reduced its solubility. The addition of CaCl(2) increased the pH of WMTA in the immediate period and at 24 and 72 h and for WPC in the immediate period and at 24 h. The addition of CaCl(2) to WMTA and WPC reduced the setting times and solubility of both and increased the pH of cements in the initial periods.",M1
19325196,"Influence of storage conditions and effect of metal priming agents on bond strength of resin-modified glass ionomers to gold alloy.This study evaluated the influence of water storage conditions and the effect of metal priming agents on bond strength and durability of four luting agents joined to gold alloy. Disk specimens were cast from a gold alloy (Degudent U), and the surfaces were ground flat with abrasive paper. Three surface conditions employed were: unprimed, primed with Alloy Primer, and primed with Metaltite. Three resin-modified glass ionomers (RMGIs; Vitremer Luting <e>Cement</e>, Fuji Lute, and Xeno Cem Plus) and a resin adhesive (Super-Bond C&amp;B) were used for bonding the gold alloy. Unprimed specimens bonded either with Fuji Lute or with Super-Bond C&amp;B were immersed in water at 5, 37, and 55 degrees C for 7 days, or subjected to thermocycling (5,000 cycles; 5 degrees C, 1 min and 55 degrees C, 1 min). In addition, specimens were bonded with 12 combinations comprising three surface conditions and four luting agents, and thermocycled for 20,000 cycles. Shear bond strengths were then determined and analyzed statistically. Thermocycling was useful for evaluation of the bonding durability of RMGIs. Application of two metal priming agents combined with RMGIs considerably enhanced the bond strength to the gold alloy.",M1
19283454,"Comparison of failure mechanisms for <e>cements</e> used in skeletal luting applications.Glass Polyalkenoate Cements (GPCs) based on strontium calcium zinc silicate (Sr-Ca-Zn-SiO(2)) glasses and low molecular weight poly(acrylic acid) (PAA) have been shown to exhibit suitable compressive strength (65 MPa) and flexural strength (14 MPa) for orthopaedic luting applications. In this study, two such GPC formulations, alongside two commercial cements (Simplex P and Hydroset) were examined. Fracture toughness and tensile bond strength to sintered hydroxyapatite and a biomedical titanium alloy were examined. Fracture toughness of the commercial Poly(methyl methacrylate) cement, Simplex P, (3.02 MPa m(1/2)) was superior to that of the novel GPC (0.36 MPa m(1/2)) and the commercial calcium phosphate cement, Hydroset, for which no significant fracture toughness was obtained. However, tensile bond strengths of the novel GPCs (0.38 MPa), after a prolonged period (30 days), were observed to be superior to commercial controls (Simplex P: 0.07 MPa, Hydroset: 0.16 MPa).",M1
19279975,"Marginal adaptation of root-end filling materials: an in vitro study with teeth and replicas.AIM: The purpose of this investigation was to evaluate the marginal adaptation of five root-end filling materials. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Fifty human single-rooted teeth were resected 3 mm from the apex. Root-end cavities were then prepared using an ultrasonic tip and filled with one of the following materials: silver amalgam without zinc, white MTA-Angelus, white Portland <e>cement</e> (PC), Vitremer, and GC Fuji Ortho LC. The apical portion of the roots was then sectioned to obtain two 1 mm thick transversal sections. Epoxy resin replicas of these apical sections were fabricated for an analysis of marginal adaptation. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) was used to determine gaps in the adaptation of the root-end filling materials at the interface between them and the dentin. The Kruskal-Wallis test and a multiple comparison test were used for statistical data analysis. The Spearman correlation coefficient was used to determine the correlation between the results found for teeth and replicas. RESULTS: Materials containing calcium oxide (MTA and PC) showed similar results. Resin modified glass ionomer cements (GICs) presented similar variations in marginal adaptation, but Vitremer showed significantly greater marginal adaptation when compared to GC Fuji Ortho LC. CONCLUSION: A positive and significant correlation was observed between marginal adaptation values found in the teeth and their replicas. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The use of ionomers as root-end filling materials may improve clinical outcomes in periradicular surgery.",M1
19279972,"Fracture resistance of aluminium oxide and lithium disilicate-based crowns using different luting <e>cements</e>: an in vitro study.AIM: The aim of this study was to investigate the fracture resistance of two types of ceramic crowns cemented with two different cements. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Forty premolar crowns were fabricated using lithium-disilicate (IPS Empress-2) and glass-infiltrated aluminium-oxide (In-Ceram) ceramic systems. The crowns were divided into four groups (n=10) with Group 1 (IPS Empress-2) and Group 2 (In-Ceram) cemented with glass ionomer cement. Group 3 (IPS Empress-2) and Group 4 (In-Ceram) were cemented with resin cement. Crowns were tested in a universal testing machine at a compressive-load speed of 10 mm/min. Fracture modes were grouped into five categories. One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) and Bonferroni post-hoc tests were used to detect statistical significances (p&lt;0.05). RESULTS: The mean (SD) fracture resistance (Newtons) for Groups 1 to 4 were: 245.35 (82.69), 390.48 (67.03), 269.69 (10.33), and 418.36 (26.24). The cement type had no statistical significant effect (p&gt;0.05) on fracture resistance within each ceramic system tested. In-Ceram crowns cemented with either glass ionomer or resin cements exhibited a statistically significantly higher fracture-resistance than IPS Empress-2 crowns (p&lt;0.05). Minimal fracture in the test crowns was the common mode exhibited. CONCLUSION: Fracture resistance of IPS Empress-2 and In-Ceram crowns was not affected by the type of cement used for luting. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: Both In-Ceram and IPS Empress-2 crowns can be successfully luted with the cements tested with In-Ceram exhibiting higher fracture resistance than IPS Empress-2.",M1
19264424,"Does dental zinc phosphate <e>cement</e> really shrink in clinical applications?Crowns are cemented onto abutments with adhesives; and zinc phosphate cement is a routine permanent luting agent, which is believed to secure crowns to abutments by non-adhesive micro-mechanical interlocking. Because it has been proven, and the public widely accepts, that zinc phosphate cement forms no chemical bonds with either the crown or the tooth tissue; it is impossible for the cement to attain adequate retention force if it contracts in volume. Assuming that the cement contracts in volume after setting, the prosthesis tends to loose and is doomed to be hampered by fretting damage when it functions during the masticatory cycle; thus the prognosis for the prosthesis is questionable. However, zinc phosphate is popular because of its brilliant clinical record. This paradox between theory and practice indicates that something might be wrong with the standing theory. The most possible problem with previous studies is that their samples' dimensions differ from those that are used clinically, which causes the studies' results, which claim that the cement shrinks, to deviate from clinical results. The real rationale must be that the zinc phosphate cement tends to expand in volume, and thus mechanically fasten the crown to the abutment.",M1
19241690,"Effect of preparation angles on the precision of zirconia crown copings fabricated by CAD/CAM system.The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the effects of different preparation angles on the precision of fit of zirconia crown frameworks. Dies were fabricated with three different preparation angles: 4, 8, and 12 degrees total taper. Ten copings were fabricated for each angle by a laboratory and a milling-center CAD/CAM system. After cementation, cross-sections were obtained and <e>cement</e> gaps were measured. Preparation angle (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.01) and measurement location (ANOVA, p &lt; 0.01) exhibited statistically significant influence on the precision of fit. On the other hand, no statistically significant influences were detected between copings prepared using the laboratory and milling-center CAD/CAM systems (ANOVA, p = 0.92). All groups showed marginal openings ranging between 36.6 and 45.5 microm. In light of the results obtained in this study, a preparation angle of 12 degrees is hence recommended with the confidence that the marginal gap will be consistently less than 50 microm.",M1
19235565,"Streptococcal adhesion to various luting systems and the role of mixing errors.OBJECTIVE: This study aims at ranking various luting systems according to their susceptibility to adhering Streptococcus mutans and at evaluating the influence of incongruent mixing ratios on adhesion quantities. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Circular specimens measuring 8 mm in diameter were made of nine widely used dental <e>cements</e> -- three of them mixed in different ratios -- and then incubated with S. mutans. Adhering streptococci were quantified using a biofluorometric assay in combination with an automated plate reader for cell quantification. Surface roughness (R(a)) was determined by perthometer measurements. RESULTS: Meron plus revealed the highest R(a) (0.90 microm) and glass the lowest R(a) (&lt;0.01 microm). In regular cement mixtures, the highest mean fluorescence intensities indicated the presence of many viable bacteria [Meron Plus (35,533 relative fluorescence units (rfu)), Maxcem (13,374 rfu), and Panavia F 2.0 (11,701 rfu)]. Moderate fluorescence intensities were found in Harvard (4,171 rfu), Ketac cem (3,766 rfu), Durelon (3,276 rfu), Calibra (3,259), Rely X Unicem (4,358 rfu), and Bifix SE (3,102 rfu). A medium correlation between R(a) and S. mutans adhesion was found. Changes in regular cement proportions (powder/liquid and base/catalyst, respectively) had a significant influence on relative fluorescence intensities, which linearly increased with a higher proportion of liquid in Harvard and with a higher proportion of catalyst in Calibra and Maxcem. CONCLUSIONS: Various luting systems revealed considerable differences in their potential to adhere S. mutans. Variations from recommended cement proportions led to significant changes in the amount of adhering streptococci.",M1
19234432,"Indirect resin composite restorations: evaluation of polymerization of luting agents by means of micro-Raman spectrophotometry.AIM: The degree of conversion of a luting composite <e>cement</e> influences its clinical performance. Aim of the study was to evaluate the degree of conversion of 4 different composite cements by means of micro Raman spectrophotometry. METHODS: Forty-four cylindrical onlays of different and defined thickness (1, 2, 3, 4 mm) were built using a custom made template. The onlays were made in composite material (Signum, Heraeus; shade A 3,5) and cemented onto a glass plate with different luting materials: dual curing (Variolink II, Calibra) and light curing (Venus flow, Tetric flow). The lamp tip was shielded in order to have the light reach the cement only through the onlay. Samples were divided into 12 groups (N.=3), differing in onlay thickness and luting material. Each sample was examined in three spots by a micro-Raman spectrophotometer (Dilor Hr-Labram). The conversion degree was evaluated by analyzing the variations in intensity of the 1638 cm(-1) aliphatic peak (C=C), characteristic of all Bis-GMA containing materials, related to the invariant 1608 cm(-1) (C-C of the aromatic ring). RESULTS: All materials show good polymerisation results below 1 mm and 2 mm onlays. Below onlays thicker than 3 mm a constant degree of conversion throughout the surface of samples could not be found: spots with satisfactory polymerisation and spots with insufficient polymerisation were found. CONCLUSIONS: Onlay thickness has a key role in cement conversion. The thicker the onlay, the less predictable the conversion.",M1
19228213,"Cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of pulp capping materials in two cell lines.AIM: The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity and genotoxicity of the new castor oil bean <e>cement</e> (COB) material in comparison to commonly used pulp capping materials. METHODOLOGY: Specimens of COB, calcium hydroxide (Hydro C), and mineral trioxide aggregate (white and gray MTA) were extracted in culture medium (91.6 mm(2) sample surface mL(-1)). Transfected human pulp cells (tHPCs) were exposed to dilutions of the extracts for 1 h, and the generation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was determined by flow cytometry (FACS) using H(2)DCF-DA as a dye. Survival of tHPCs was measured photometrically using a crystal violet assay after a 24-h exposure period. Genotoxicity as indicated by the formation of micronuclei in V79 cells, and the modification of the normal cell cycle by extracts of the materials was analysed by FACS. RESULTS: Clear cytotoxic effects were detected only with extracts of Hydro C under the current experimental conditions. The two MTA preparations induced an insignificant reduction in the number of cells. In contrast, the extracts of COB slightly induced cell proliferation. Extracts of Hydro C caused a twofold increase in ROS production, whilst the other tested materials were ineffective. An increase in the number of micronuclei was not detected with any material tested; Hydro C slightly increased the number of cells in G1 and G2. CONCLUSIONS: The COB and the two MTA preparations did not negatively influence cell survival or ROS production and may thus be further considered for pulp capping studies.",M1
19220518,"Evaluation of the strength and radiopacity of Portland <e>cement</e> with varying additions of bismuth oxide.AIM: To study the effect of addition of various proportions of bismuth oxide on compressive strength and radiopacity of Portland cement. METHODOLOGY: The compressive strength of white Portland cement and cement replaced with 10, 15, 20, 25 and 30% bismuth oxide was evaluated by testing cylinders 6 mm in diameter and 12 mm high. Twelve cylinders were tested for each material under study. The radiopacity of the cements tested was evaluated using an aluminium step-wedge and densitometer. The optical density was compared with the relevant thickness of aluminium (Al). Statistical analysis was performed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) with P = 0.05 and Tukey test to perform multiple comparison tests. RESULTS: Various additions of bismuth oxide had no significant effect on the strength of the material when compared with the unmodified Portland cement (P &gt; 0.05). The radiopacity of the cements tested ranged from 2.02 mm Al for Portland cement to 9.79 mm Al for the highest bismuth replacement. CONCLUSIONS: Addition of bismuth oxide did not affect the compressive strength of Portland cement. All the bismuth oxide cement mixtures had radio-opacities higher than 3 mm thickness of aluminium.",M1
19189677,"In vitro evaluation of failure loads of nonmetal cantilevered resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses.PURPOSE: To evaluate in vitro the influence of fiber reinforcement on the failure loads of resin composite beams, simulating cantilevered two-unit resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses, and compare the results with similarly obtained failure loads of ZrO2 and CoCr beams of a comparable design. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Peel tests were performed using resin composite, fiber-reinforced resin composite, and zirconia beams, simulating two-unit cantilevered resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses, luted with Panavia F2.0 onto flat-ground buccal surfaces of bovine mandibular incisors. The recorded failure loads were compared with those of CoCr beams of a similar size and design from earlier research. Finite element analysis revealed the stress concentrations within the <e>cement</e> layers at failure. RESULTS: The failure loads (N) of the peel tests, depending on the beam type and including the type of failure, were statistically analyzed. The highest failure values were obtained with the fiber-reinforced resin composite beams, which were luted with the exposed fibers directly on the bovine enamel. Finite element analysis showed that peak stress locations depend on the beam type and facilitate the explanation of the different failure modes. CONCLUSION: Fiber-reinforcement of simulated two-unit cantilevered resin composite resin-bonded fixed dental prostheses does not necessarily lead to higher failure loads. This study identified significant differences in peel failure loads between identical specimens, depending on whether or not the fiber reinforcement was exposed on the luting surface. Further research needs to be carried out regarding the combination of resin composite and fiber reinforcement.",M1

Our study also investigated the surface characteristics of MTA and NEC root-end fillings when immersed in normal saline. For part I, we prepared samples of 9 brands of MTAs, PCs, and NEC. The materials were imaged and analyzed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and energy dispersive x-ray analysis (EDXA). In part II, 3-mm-deep root-end preparations were filled with MTA or NEC and stored in normal saline for 1 week. Samples were imaged and analyzed by SEM and electron probe microanalysis (EPMA). EDXA investigations revealed differences in the dominant compounds of NEC, PCs, and MTAs. The major components of MTA and PC are the same except for bismuth. The most significant difference was the presence of higher concentrations of Fe (minor element) in gray MTA and PC when compared with white ones. EPMA results revealed remarkably different elements in MTA compared with surrounding dentin, whereas in the NEC group the distribution patterns of calcium, phosphorous, and oxygen were comparable. NEC differs chemically from MTAs and PCs and demonstrates comparable surface composition with adjacent dentin as a root-end filling material.",M1

The addition of ZnO, MgO, and Fe(2)O(3) to the MTA-like cement led to a significantly (p &lt; 0.05) higher strength than MTA-like cement without additives. The pH values of the MTA-like cements were changed from an initial 11 to a high of 13, similar to the results of MTA.

STUDY DESIGN: The chemical constitution of materials was determined by scanning electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray analysis. The radiopacity of the materials was determined using the ISO/6876 method. The biocompatibility of the materials was tested by MTT assay and tissue reaction. RESULTS: The constitution of all materials was similar. However, the Portland cement and experimental cement were more irregular and had a larger particle size than MTA. The radiopacity of the experimental cement was similar to MTA. The MTT assay revealed MTA to have slightly higher cell viability than the other materials. However, there were no statistically significant differences between the materials, with the exception of MTA at 24 h. There was no significant difference in the tissue reaction between the experimental groups. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the experimental cement may be used as a substitute for MTA.",M1
19148409,"Pulpotomies with Portland <e>cement</e> in human primary molars.Two clinical cases in which Portland cement (PC) was applied as a medicament after pulpotomy of mandibular primary molars in children are presented. Pulpotomy using PC was carried out in two mandibular first molars and one mandibular second molar, which were further followed-up. At the 3, 6 and 12-month follow-up appointments, clinical and radiographic examinations of the pulpotomized teeth and their periradicular area revealed that the treatments were successful in maintaining the teeth asymptomatic and preserving pulpal vitality. Additionally, the formation of a dentin bridge immediately below the PC could be observed in the three molars treated. PC may be considered as an effective alternative for primary molar pulpotomies, at least in a short-term period. Randomized clinical trials with human teeth are required in order to determine the suitability of PC before unlimited clinical use can be recommended.",M1

MATERIALS AND METHODS: Four light-cured dental resin restorative materials in combination with their respective bonding agents were investigated. Eighty non-carious, extracted human molars were divided into 4 groups of 20 teeth each. The apices of the teeth were sealed with a resin modified glass ionomer <e>cement</e>. Standardized Class II slot cavities were prepared on the proximal surfaces of each tooth. Each group had an equal number of cavities with gingival margins on enamel and on dentine/cementum. Restorations were placed as indicated: Group 1 (G1): Ceram-X mono/Prime &amp; Bond NT (Dentsply), G2: Premise/ OptiBond Solo Plus (Kerr), G3: Grandio/Admira Bond (VOCO), G4: Z100/Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose (3M ESPE). After thermocycling and immersion in 0.5% methylene blue dye solution, the teeth were sectioned and dye penetration was scored on a scale of 0 to 3 on both the enamel and dentine/cementum margins. The data were analyzed using a Kruskal-Wallis one way ANOVA and Mann-Whitney U test of ranks (significance at p &lt; 0.05). RESULTS: In the enamel group: Z100/Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose showed significantly higher leakage when compared to the other three groups (p &lt; 0.05). In the dentine/cementum group: Grandio/Admira Bond showed significantly lower microleakage when compared to the other materials tested while Z100/Adper Scotchbond Multi-Purpose showed the largest microleakage (p &lt; 0.05).

19582860,"Nonlinear visco-elastic finite element analysis of different porcelain veneers configuration.This study is aimed at evaluating the biomechanical behavior of feldspathic versus alumina porcelain veneers. A 3D numerical model of a maxillary central incisor, with the periodontal ligament (PDL) and the alveolar bone was generated. Such model was made up of four main volumes: dentin, enamel, <e>cement</e> layer and veneer. Incisors restored with alumina and feldspathic porcelain veneers were compared with a natural sound tooth (control). Enamel, cementum, cancellous and cortical bone were considered as isotropic elastic materials; on the contrary, the tubular structure of dentin was designed as elastic orthotropic. The nonlinear visco-elatic behavior of the PDL was considered. The veneer volumes were coupled with alumina and feldspathic porcelain mechanical properties. The adhesive layers were modeled in the FE environment using spring elements. A 50N load applied at 60 degrees angle with tooth longitudinal axis was applied and validated. Compressive stresses were concentrated on the external surface of the buccal side of the veneer close to the incisal margin; such phenomenon was more evident in the presence of alumina. Tensile stresses were negligible when compared to compressive ones. Alumina and feldspathic ceramic were characterized by a different biomechanical behavior in terms of elastic deformations and stress distributions. The ultimate strength of both materials was not overcome in the performed analysis.",M2

Thirty-two non-carious teeth were selected and 64 cavity preparations were performed in both enamel and cementum. These teeth were divided into four groups: I--Elipar FreeLight appliance and Filtek Flowable composite; II--Ultralux appliance and Filtek Flowable composite; III--Elipar FreeLight appliance and RelyX cement and IV--Ultralux appliance and RelyX cement. The inlays were internally sandblasted with aluminum oxide, etched with 37% phosphoric acid, washed and silanized. The dental etching was carried out with 37% phosphoric acid for 15 seconds in dentin and 30 seconds in enamel. After being washed and dried, Single Bond dentinal adhesive was then applied, and the inlays were fixed with their respective luting agents, cured in close contact with their surfaces for 60 seconds, thermocycled and immersed in 0.5% basic fuchsine solution. The teeth were then washed and sectioned through the center of the restoration in order for the microleakage readings to be performed using the Image Tool Software. Then, ANOVA and Tukey's statistical tests were applied. In enamel, there was no significant difference for both groups with regard to microleakage; in cementum, the significant difference was 5% (p &gt; 0.005).

MATERIALS AND METHODS: This study has been carried out by numerical method of structural analysis of finite elements (FEM, Finite Element Method). Different tridimensional models were obtained by CAT images of an extracted tooth, endodontically treated, filled with guttapercha and triple conical glass post. Images have been elaborated by a software for images (Mimics and Ansys) and CAD (Rhinoceros 3 D). In the models a II Class restoration has been virtually created. In the numerical simulation dental tissues (enamel, dentine and root <e>cement</e>), guttapercha, root canal cement, different posts, different techniques of cementation and crown restoration (composites and adhesive systems) have been considered. RESULTS: Strain distributions in dental tissues, in root canal cement and in posts have been compared. The equivalent tensions and the single components (traction, compression and cut) have been analysed. In all examined posts, the most strained part is resulted the coronal one, even if the total tension, in the different tooth-post analyzed systems, resulted uniformly distributed. A similar behaviour was shown by the root canal cement. CONCLUSIONS: According to the analyzed conditions of bond and load, varying according to the geometry of the considered posts, our results confirm that there is no substantial difference of deformation in posts, root canal cement and treated tooth.",M2

17184236,"Formation of acellular cementum-like layers, with and without extrinsic fiber insertion, along inert bone surfaces of aging c-Src gene knockout mice.To investigate the long-term effects of c-src deficiency on skeletal and dental tissues, we examined the lower jaws and long bones of c-src gene knockout (c-src KO) mice by histological and histochemical methods. Numerous multinucleated osteoclasts were distributed throughout the mandible in 5-wk-old c-src KO mice, but by 14 wk they had almost completely disappeared from the alveolar bone, leaving tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP)-positive layers along the bone surface. Deposition of osteopontin-positive mineralized tissue, reminiscent of acellular afibrillar cementum (AAC), was confirmed along the TRAP-positive bone surface at 14 wk. The layer progressively thickened up to 21 months. A comparable mineralized layer was noted along the trabeculae of long bones as thickened <e>cement</e> lines. In the periostin-rich areas of jaw bones, but not in the long bones, portions of AAC-like mineralized layers were often replaced with and/or covered by acellular extrinsic fiber cementum (AEFC)-like tissue. These data suggest that the deposition of AAC-like mineralized tissue is a general phenomenon that may occur along inert or slowly remodeling bone surfaces under conditions characterized by reduced bone-resorbing activity, whereas the induction of AEFC-like tissue seems to be associated with the expression of certain molecules that are particularly abundant in the microenvironment of the periodontal ligament.",M2
16827718,"An immunohistochemical study of the attachment mechanisms in different kinds of adhesive interfaces in teeth and alveolar bone of the rat.BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: This study was designed to examine the histological and immunohistochemical nature of different kinds of adhesive interfaces in the rat molar region under identical experimental conditions and to discuss the structural and functional similarities between these adhesive interfaces. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Four kinds of adhesive interfaces - an initial attachment layer for principal fibers on the developing alveolar bone surface, a reattachment layer for principal fibers on resorbed alveolar bone surface, <e>cement</e> lines on the alveolar bone surface unrelated to the principal fibers, and the cemento-dentinal junction - were examined in 25-d-old male Wistar rats. Routine histological staining, immunohistochemical staining for bone sialoprotein and osteopontin, and digestion tests with trypsin were conducted. RESULTS: The adhesive interfaces showed very similar histological and immunohistochemical features: they were intensely hematoxylin-stainable, deficient in collagen fibrils, and rich in bone sialoprotein and osteopontin. After trypsin treatment the four adhesive interfaces had lost immunoreactivity to bone sialoprotein and osteopontin, and the two adjacent tissue parts held together finally separated at the adhesive interfaces. CONCLUSION: The above findings suggest that (i) the different types of adhesive interfaces in the rat molar region have a common structure in that they are filled with highly accumulated bone sialoprotein and osteopontin and deficient in collagen fibrils; (ii) accumulated bone sialoprotein and osteopontin are closely associated with the adhesion at the interfaces; and (iii) the adhesive interfaces have a similar developmental process.",M2
16730636,"Development of functional dentin incisors after a partial resection of the odontogenic organ of rat incisors.The resection of the labial half of the odontogenic organ of rat incisors resulted in the development of teeth without enamel. Ten out of 26 operated rats developed a functional dentin incisor, i.e. a continuously growing and erupting tooth. These teeth were a little shorter and much thinner than normal incisors. The dentin and pulp presented a normal structure. Periodontal ligament and <e>cement</e> started to develop at the lingual face and gradually all tooth faces were invested by these tissues. The original socket space, to accommodate a thinner tooth, was narrowed by newly formed bone around the inner face of the socket. Eleven rats developed defective dentin incisors; these teeth showed signs of growth, however, their eruption was impaired. The operation failed in five rats. The odontogenic organ of the dentin incisor presented islands of epithelial cells at the labial aspect of a dense mass of mesenchyme cells. These islands, formed by densely packed, dark-staining cells encircling a few pale-staining cells, merged gradually, forming a root sheath and a cervical loop limiting a long apical foramen. The bulk of the bulbous part (apical bud) was absent; thus, there was no differentiation of ameloblasts and of the crown-analogue part of the incisor. The growth and eruptive behaviour of the dentin incisor, similar to that of a normal incisor, indicates that it has to bear a stem cell niche to retain its regenerative capacity. As in the apical bud, this niche is apparently located at the stellate reticulum of the cervical loop. The putative molecular mechanisms related to either the maintenance of the stem cell niche or the differentiation of the enamel organ and the root sheath are discussed. These data and our results, showing the development of a functional dentin incisor, suggest that the root-analogue part of the rodent incisor is an anatomic-physiological entity.",M2

16441738,"In vitro calculus detection with a moved smart ultrasonic device.STUDY OBJECTIVE: The objective of subgingival instrumentation of periodontally diseased root surfaces is to remove the adhering microbial biofilm and calcified deposits. Recently, we have described an automated calculus detection system under static conditions. Clinically however, the tip of the system has to be moved over tooth surfaces. It was thus necessary to study the entire system in motion. METHODS: The detection device is based on a conventional dental piezoelectric ultrasonic handpiece with a conventional scaler insert. The impulse response of the mechanical oscillation system is analysed by a fuzzy logic-based computerized algorithm, which classifies various surfaces. The present study investigates dental surface recognition properties of the new system with the tip being moved over teeth surfaces in vitro. Following a training set of 7977 measurements (3960 calculus, 4017 <e>cement</e>) on 200 extracted teeth, 1363 measurements were conducted on 34 teeth unknown to the system. RESULTS: The surfaces cementum and calculus were correctly classified in 78% within the training set and in 81% within the set unknown, with a kappa value of 0.68. CONCLUSION: It was shown that this method of automatic recognition of tooth surfaces is able to distinguish between different tooth surfaces in vitro independently from tip movements.",M2
16428181,"A resin-modified glass ionomer <e>cement</e> barrier for treating degree II furcation defects: a pilot study in dogs.OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to evaluate in an animal model the healing of degree II furcation defects treated with: an experimental barrier of resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (GIC), a polylactic acid barrier (GUI), and flap surgery (CTR). MATERIAL AND METHODS: In 3 beagles, 18 class II furcation defects were surgically produced in mandibular and maxillary premolars and exposed to plaque accumulation for 21 days. Following a full flap, notches were made at the base to the bone defect. GIC barriers were prepared immediately before use from a commercial product and fit to place with the same product. The GIC barriers were removed after 30 days and the dogs euthanized after 120 days. Histologic sections were analyzed in a computer-assisted microscope. Epithelium, new cementum with inserting fibers, and connective tissue lining the root surface in-between notches were measured and medians of percentage values calculated. RESULTS: In the GIC, epithelium constituted 3.5% (median values) of the notch-to-notch root area; new cementum was 83.6% and connective tissue 12.9%. These values were 0%, 73.6%, and 26.4% for the GUI group and 35.6%, 43.2%, and 0% for the CTR group. Bone fill median values were 54.3% for GIC, 20.6% for GUI, and 24.6% for CTR. CONCLUSION: GIC and GUI prevented epithelial migration and promoted the formation of new periodontal tissues in experimentally induced class II furcation defects in dogs.",M2
16113927,"Influence of apical patency and filling material on healing process of dogs' teeth with vital pulp after root canal therapy.The purpose of this study was to investigate the periapical healing process of dogs' teeth with or without apical patency and after root canal filling with two types of sealers. Forty roots of premolars and incisors were utilized. The root canals were over-instrumented and dressed with a corticosteroid-antibiotic solution for 7 days to obtain ingrowth of periapical connective tissue into the canals. After this period, the tissue was removed in half of the specimens (groups with patency) and preserved in the other half (groups without patency). Canals were filled by lateral condensation technique with gutta-percha points and either a calcium hydroxide-based sealer (Sealer Plus) or a Grossman's <e>cement</e> (Fill Canal). The animals were killed by anesthetic overdose 60 days after the endodontic treatment and anatomic pieces were obtained and prepared for histologic examination. Data were evaluated in a blind analysis on the basis of several histomorphologic parameters. The groups without patency had better results (p=0.01) than those in which the ingrown connective tissue was removed. Comparing the sealers, Sealer Plus had significantly better results (p=0.01) than Fill Canal. In conclusion, both the apical patency (presence or absence) and the type of root canal filling material influenced the periapical healing process in dogs' teeth with vital pulp after root canal treatment. The use of a calcium hydroxide-based sealer in teeth without apical patency yielded the best results among the experimental conditions proposed.",M2
15942618,"In vitro evaluation of microleakage of indirect composite inlays cemented with four luting agents.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Microleakage around dental restorations is implicated in the occurrence of secondary carious lesions, adverse pulpal response, and reduced restoration longevity. PURPOSE: The aim of this in vitro study was to evaluate the microleakage of indirect resin composite inlays cemented with 4 luting agents. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Standardized Class V inlay preparations overlapping the cemento-enamel junction were prepared on the buccal and lingual surfaces of 40 extracted human mandibular third molars. Eighty postpolymerized, heat-treated resin composite inlays (Targis, 72 specimens, 8 controls) were processed in stone replicas and cemented into the preparations using 4 luting agents (n = 18 + 2 controls for each <e>cement</e> group): a resin composite used with a bonding agent (Variolink II/Excite), a resin composite used with a self-etching primer, but without bonding agent (Panavia F/ED Primer), a modified resin composite used with a bonding agent (Resinomer/One Step), and a resin-modified glass-ionomer cement (Fuji Plus). Thirty-six inlays (n = 9 + 1 control) were subjected to thermal cycling (2000 cycles, 5 degrees C/55 degrees C), whereas the other 36 were not. All the teeth were then immersed in 1% methylene blue dye solution for 48 hours. Microleakage score, margin location (enamel/cementum), thermal cycling history, and preparation location (buccal/lingual) were analyzed using a multivariate model (alpha = .05). Multivariate analysis was performed using a polychotomous logistic regression. RESULTS: The preparation location had no significant effect on dye penetration. The margin location (enamel or cementum) and the thermal cycling had a significant effect on microleakage (odds ratios [ORs] = 17.6 and 8.04, respectively). In comparing the 3 resin-based luting agents (Variolink II, Panavia F, and Resinomer) to Fuji Plus, Panavia F exhibited the lowest significant overall microleakage (OR = 0.09), followed by Variolink II (significant OR equal to 0.43), whereas Resinomer demonstrated the greatest significant overall microleakage (OR = 1.35). CONCLUSION: Within the experimental conditions of this in vitro study, thermal cycling significantly increased microleakage (OR = 8.04). The overall microleakage at the enamel margins was significantly lower than the overall microleakage at the cementum margins for the 4 luting agents tested (OR = 17.6).",M2
15322639,"Microleakage in bonded amalgam restorations using different adhesive materials.The aim of this study was to verify the ability of different adhesive materials to prevent microleakage in bonded amalgam restorations. Standard cavities were prepared in both buccal and lingual surfaces of 35 bovine incisors. The gingival wall was located in cementum/dentin and the occlusal wall in enamel. Teeth (n=35) were divided into 5 groups, according to material employed (one glass-ionomer <e>cement</e>, two resin cements, one adhesive system, and Copalex varnish as a control). Following restoration, the teeth were submitted to thermal cycling. The teeth were subsequently immersed in methylene blue dye and sectioned to allow assessment of microleakage. Non-parametric statistical analysis indicated that all materials demonstrated less leakage than the control group (p&lt;0.01). No leakage was found using the resin-modified glass-ionomer cement, which was significantly different from the other adhesive materials (p&lt;0.05). Leakage in enamel was lower than in cementum/dentin margins. It was concluded that bonded amalgam was an effective technique, since all materials prevented microleakage in enamel and cementum/dentin, when compared to the control group, except Panavia in cementum/dentin margins.",M2
15016258,"Surface wear on cervical restorations and adjacent enamel and root cementum caused by simulated long-term maintenance therapy.BACKGROUND: In an in vitro study, the surface wear on cervical restorations and adjacent enamel and root cementum caused by different tooth-cleaning methods in simulated long-term therapy was investigated. METHODS: Cervical restorations of amalgam (Oralloy), modified composite resin (Dyract), glass-ionomer <e>cement</e> (ChemFill Superior), and composite (Tetric) were instrumented by POL (polishing), CUR+POL (curette and polishing), US+POL (ultrasonic device with polishing) and the polishing agents Cleanic and Proxyt in a computer-controlled test bench. Treatment time corresponding to a real-time period of 5 or 10 years. Substance loss from instrumented surfaces was measured with a digital gauge. A three-way anova was used in the statistical evaluation. RESULTS: The results showed that POL led to slight substance loss, which was greater using Cleanic (27 microm) than Proxyt (5 microm). CUR+POL produced a significantly greater substance loss than did US+POL, with 186 microm versus 35 microm on glass-ionomer cement, respectively, and 123 microm versus 18 microm, respectively, on root cementum, followed by composite (111 microm versus 27 microm, respectively), polyacid modified composite resin/compomer (89 microm versus 36 microm), amalgam (75 microm versus 19 microm), and enamel (32 microm versus 23 microm). CONCLUSIONS: As opposed to the use of US+POL or POL, substance loss on cervical restorations and especially root cementum must be expected to result from tooth-cleaning during long-term maintenance treatment using CUR+POL.",M2
12888002,"Tooth eruption and cementum formation in the Runx2/Cbfa1 heterozygous mouse.Cleidocranial dysplasia (CCD) is an autosomal dominant human disorder that affects development of bones and teeth. The dental disorders in CCD patients include formation of supernumerary teeth, delayed tooth eruption, and lack of formation of cellular cementum in permanent teeth. This disorder involves a mutation in the osteoblast-specific transcription factor Runx2/Cbfa1, leading to haploinsufficiency of the Runx2/Cbfa1 protein. Here, we examined if Runx2/Cbfa1 heterozygous mice (with one functional allele for Runx2/Cbfa1) exhibit similar changes in tooth eruption, and dental cementum formation as in CCD patients. Heads of Runx2/Cbfa1 heterogeneous and wildtype mice aged days 16-35 postnatally were serially sectioned and stained with hematoxylin-eosin or for tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) to identify osteoclasts. The results showed that the eruption pattern of the first and second molars in maxilla and mandible in Runx2/Cbfa1 +/- mice was the same as in wildtype animals. No clear difference in distribution or in the (estimated) number of osteoclasts was found. Cellular <e>cement</e> at the apical portions of the molar roots was present in both groups. The data suggests that in the mouse one allele for Runx2/Cbfa1 is sufficient for an undisturbed tooth eruption and an apparently normal formation of the periodontium.",M2
12729085,"Microleakage in ceramic inlays luted with different resin <e>cements</e>.PURPOSE: The objective of this in vitro study was to evaluate the microleakage in ceramic inlays using different resin cements with margins in enamel and cementum/dentin interfaces. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Standard Class II MOD inlay cavities were prepared in 32 noncarious human premolars. The cavities were randomly divided into 4 groups (n = 8): Control group: cavities were treated with Single Bond and incrementally filled with a composite resin (P60); Enforce group: feldspathic ceramic inlays were luted using Prime &amp; Bond 2.1 and Enforce; RelyX group: inlays were cemented with Single Bond and RelyX ARC; Resin Cement group: ceramic inlays were bonded using Single Bond and Resin Cement. Ceramic inlays were previously treated with 10% hydrofluoric acid for 2 min, followed by silane application. After 7 days of storage in distilled water, teeth were submitted to thermocycling. After applying nail varnish, specimens were immersed in 2% aqueous solution of methylene blue for 8 h. After washing, teeth were cut into three sections through the restorations, and the leakage was assessed using a standardized score. RESULTS: Data were submitted to statistical analysis using nonparametric tests (Mann-Whitney and Kruskal-Wallis). Dye leakage at margins in enamel was statistically lower (p &lt; 0.01) than at cementum/dentin interfaces. RelyX ARC performed better (p &lt; 0.05) than resin cement (enamel) and composite restorations (cementum/dentin). No other statistical differences were observed.

After extraction, the apical area was exposed and the position of the file tip was examined under an operating microscope. Distances from the major foramen and cemento dentinal junction (CDJ) were recorded. The average distance from the major foramen was -0.13 mm with a range of -1.28 mm and +0.46 mm. The average distance in 26 detectable CDJ samples was +0.18 mm with a range of -0.98 mm and +0.65 mm. The measurements, which were within +/- 0.5 mm, were 94% (29/31) from the major foramen and 92% (24/26) from the CDJ. Measurement consistencies within one SD were 81% for the major foramen and 65% for the CDJ, respectively. Measurements within two SD were 97% for the major foramen and 92% for the CDJ.

12296590,"Histocompatible healing of periodontal defects after application of an injectable calcium phosphate bone <e>cement</e>. A preliminary study in dogs.BACKGROUND: A novel injectable, fast setting calcium phosphate cement (CPC) is currently used in orthopedic therapy for bone fractures. This study evaluated the possibility of applying this cement to healing periodontal defects. METHODS: Fenestrations and 3-walled periodontal defects were surgically created on bilateral first molars and canines in 5 beagle dogs. CPC was applied to the defects on one side of the mandible. Untreated defects on the contralateral side served as controls. CPC was applied to all defects in the maxilla. Twelve weeks after surgery, the animals were sacrificed and decalcified and undecalcified specimens were prepared. Periodontal tissue healing was evaluated histologically and histometrically under a light microscope. RESULTS: Healing of periodontal tissues in terms of bone and cementum formation was consistently observed in the CPC-applied sites. CPC was partly replaced by new bone. The residual CPC appeared detached from the denuded root surface. New cementum and periodontal ligament-like tissue were observed between the detached CPC and root surface. No unfavorable reaction was noted in the CPC-applied sites. No statistically significant difference was noted in the experimental or control sites under histometric analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Although there were no statistically significant differences between the 2 treatment groups, histological observation indicated that CPC seemed to act as a scaffold for bone formation and provided histocompatible healing of periodontal tissues in this study. This cement might be applicable to periodontal therapy; however, further investigations are required.",M2
11990043,"A new classification for crown fractures of teeth.The aim of this work is to define a classification for traumatic injuries to crowns of teeth that offers a simplified interpretation, which can be communicated easily. These data will help us to evaluate the future restorations (composite resins, crowns, porcelain veneers) according to the variable design and extension of initial crown fracture lines. For this reason we conducted research on a vast sample of subjects, who presented different traumatic lesions, in order to obtain a specific selection of these typologies of injuries. We reviewed the literature for a complete, brief classification of simple use, which could serve our cause. The traditional classifications (Andreasen, Ellis, OMS) did not satisfy us for different reasons. In fact, they only consider the initial lesion situation, never focusing on the shape of the lesion and therefore never giving suggestions for the best kind of material for restoration. On the contrary, our interest is to define the kind of more valid materials according to the variable design of crown fracture lines, to foresee the duration of these materials and the best time to substitute them. To simplify and make our research a more affordable one, we created a 4 classes classification (A-B-C-D) and 3 subclasses (b1-c1-d1). Class A: all the simple enamel lesions which involve a mesial or distal crown angle, or only the incisal edge; Class B: all the enamel-dentin lesions, which involve a mesial or distal crown angle and the incisal edge. When a pulpal exposure exists we define it a Subclass b1; Class C: all the enamel-dentin lesions, which involve the incisal edge and at least a third of the crown surface. When a pulp exposure exists we define it a Subclass c1. Class D: all the enamel-dentin lesions, which involve a mesial or distal crown angle and the incisal or palatal surface, with root <e>cement</e> involvement (crown-root fractures). When a pulpal exposure exists we define it a Subclass d1. This classification showed how different kinds of lesions (Class B, b1, C and c1, in our new classification) fall under the same definition (enamel-dentinal fractures) in traditional classifications (Andreasen, Ellis). However, they need a wholly different clinical approach, and the material involved in the treatment shows different behavior and duration. This new classification simplified the gathering of data and the communication among practitioners, thus confirming its importance in getting optimal diagnostic and therapeutic protocols. It also allowed us to identify the most frequent crown fractures (Class B, b1 and C, c1) that in our sample of patients (age range: 8-18) are typically treated with composite resins or original fragment reattachment technique. All these studies brought us to develop this new  easy to use  classification of dental crown lesions that helped us to gather data easily, to choose the right materials to improve the communication among practitioners including by electronic means,",M2
11764110,"Microleakage and retention of bonded amalgam restorations.PURPOSE: To compare the microleakage and bond strength exhibited by two light-cured, filled dentin bonding agents, a resin <e>cement</e>, and cavity varnish. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The four test groups of lining agents for amalgam restorations included (LF) Light-cured, Filled resin (Clearfil Liner Bond 2); (LCF) light- and chemical-cured, Filled resin (Clearfil Liner Bond + Protect Liner); (RC) Resin Cement (Panavia 21); and (V) Varnish (Copalite). For each group, 20 Class V cavity preparations were cut in human extracted molars. Tytin amalgam was condensed into the preparation. After storage for at least 24 hrs in distilled water at 37 degrees C, all restorations were subjected to 2500 thermal cycles (8 degrees C to 48 degrees C). After 1 wk, specimens were tested. For the leakage tests, teeth were immersed in 45Ca, sectioned, and radiographs of sections were evaluated and then evaluated by Ridit analysis. Retention samples were tested to failure in tension using an Instron machine and peak load (kg) was recorded. RESULTS: Compared to varnish, the two dentin bonding agents (LF and LCF) significantly decreased microleakage at the cementum margin but not at the enamel margin. The two dentin bonding agents also exhibited significantly greater retentive strength than either the resin cement or the varnish.",M2
11519692,"Immunodetection of noncollagenous matrix proteins during periodontal tissue regeneration.The interface between denuded dentin and regenerative periodontal tissue was investigated in a rat alveolar bone defect model using morphological and immunocytochemical approaches. The dentin surface was surgically exposed along the palatal roots of maxillary first molars. At 3 weeks post treatment, animals were perfused and treated regions from decalcified mandibles were embedded in Epon for ultrastructural studies or LR White for post-embedding immunogold labeling. Thin tissue sections were incubated with antibodies against noncollagenous matrix (osteopontin, bone sialoprotein, osteocalcin and fibronectin) and plasma (alpha2HS-glycoprotein and albumin) proteins. While in some cases, regenerative events took place directly on the denuded dentin surface, the interface between the denuded dentin and regenerating periodontal tissue was frequently characterized by the presence of an interfacial zone. This zone sometimes showed an electron-dense, <e>cement</e> line-like, planar accumulation of organic material immunoreactive for osteopontin and bone sialoprotein. Immunolabeling for osteocalcin and alpha2HS-glycoprotein was moderate and diffuse throughout the interfacial zone, whereas labeling with antibodies to albumin and fibronectin resulted in a weak reaction. It is concluded that accumulation of bone sialoprotein and osteopontin is a primary event during the formation of regenerative cementum onto denuded root surfaces.",M2
11508356,"A light microscopic study of the attachment mechanism in different kinds of adhesive lines in rat molars.This study was designed to observe drifting molars of 70-day-old rats by light microscopy, and to elucidate whether there are similar attachment mechanisms at different kinds of adhesive lines in periodontal mineralized tissue of the rat molar region. Three kinds of adhesive lines--<e>cement</e> lines on resorbed alveolar bone, cement lines on resorbed roots, and cemento-dentinal junctions were examined. The two kinds of cement lines showed similar histological and histochemical features, they were proteoglycan-rich and fiber-poor. They appeared to form on the resorbed tissue before principal fiber reattachment. After covering by new bone or by reparative cementum, the cement lines retained the original features. The cemento-dentinal junction showed features very similar to those of the cement lines. Previous studies have suggested that the cemento-dentinal junctions bind the cementum and dentine by adhesion of proteoglycans. Structural similarities suggest that cement lines provide similar links between new bone and resorbed bone and between resorbed root and reparative cementum. In conclusion, this study suggests that there is one attachment mechanism for the different kinds of collagen based hard tissue in the rat molar region.",M2
11411085,"Invasive cervical resorption following trauma.Invasive cervical resorption is an insidious and often aggressively destructive form of external root resorption which may occur as a late complication following dental trauma particularly where it involves damage to cementum and supporting tissues. While this resorption may be evident clinically as a pink coronal discolouration, later with cavitation of the enamel, often there are no obvious external signs and the condition is only detected radiographically. It is characterised by the invasion of the cervical region of the root by fibrovascular tissue which progressively resorbs dentine, enamel and cementum. The dental pulp remains protected by an intact layer of dentine and predentine until late in the process. Ectopic calcifications can be observed in advanced lesions both within the invading fibrous tissue and deposited directly onto the resorbed dentine surface. The aetiology of invasive cervical resorption is unknown but trauma has been documented as a potential predisposing factor. A recent study by the author of 222 patients with a total of 257 teeth which displayed varying degrees of invasive cervical resorption showed that trauma alone was a potential predisposing sole factor in 14% of patients and 15.1% of teeth. Trauma in combination with bleaching, orthodontics or delayed eruption was found in an additional 11.2% of patients or 10.6% of teeth and of these a combination of trauma and bleaching occurred in a relatively high proportion of 7.7% of patients or 7.4% of teeth. This study also revealed that of other potential predisposing factors orthodontics was the most common sole factor constituting 21.2% of patients and 24.1% of teeth examined. Successful treatment of invasive cervical resorption is dependent on the extent of the resorptive process. Teeth with invasive cervical resorption have been divided into four classes. Whilst several treatment modalities are possible, a clinical evaluation of the treatment of this condition by the topical application of a 90% aqueous solution of trichloracetic acid, curettage, endodontic therapy where necessary and restoration with a glass ionomer <e>cement</e> has been evaluated on 94 patients with a total of 101 teeth with a minimum follow-up period of three years. Results indicate a satisfactory treatment outcome can be anticipated in Class 1, 2 and 3 cases. In Class 4 resorption no treatment or alternative therapy is recommended. Diagnosis of lesions at an early stage of development is highly desirable and therefore the patients who have a potential for the development of this condition by virtue of a history such as trauma should be monitored radiographically at intervals throughout life.",M2
11203779,"Microleakage at the cervical margin of composite Class II cavities with different restorative techniques.This study evaluated the microleakage at the cervical margins of Class II composite resin restorations restored with different techniques. Slot cavities were prepared on both proximals of 40 unerupted third molars with one cervical margin located above and the other below the cementoenamel junction. The prepared teeth were randomly assigned to four groups and restored using the following techniques: (I) 3-Sited, (II) Directed-Shrinkage, (III) Resin-Modified Glass-Ionomer <e>Cement</e> or a (IV) Flowable Composite as the gingival increment. All restorations were placed with the same bonding agent and composite resin. The difference among the groups was on the first increment and on its insertion and polymerization techniques.

However, on cementum, all techniques demonstrated moderate to severe leakage.",M2
11199752,"Macroscopic and microscopic analysis of the palato-gingival groove.With the objective of correlating the anatomical aspects of the palato-gingival groove with its etiology, diagnosis, and alternative treatments, 13 permanent maxillary incisors with palato-gingival grooves were selected from a large sample and subjected to macroscopic and microscopic analysis of groove morphology. The palato-gingival groove occurred most frequently on the lingual aspect of the lateral incisor (11 of 13), and its coronal and radicular extensions were on the disto-lingual surface of the incisors (7 of 13 and 6 of 13, respectively). Deformation of the contour of the pulp cavity was noted subjacent to the groove (9 of 13), along with diminished enamel and dentin thickness (11 of 13 and 13 of 13, respectively) and an increase in <e>cement</e> (12 of 13). The groove was observed extending to the apical third in nine specimens, and a direct communication between the pulp and periodontium was observed in only one case. From these examinations it is concluded that the palato-gingival groove can be clinically diagnosed, preventing subsequent problems; however microscopic analysis of the affected tooth is necessary to allow precise evaluation of the groove's extension and damage to the dental structure.",M2
10983881,"The fibrillar structure of <e>cement</e> lines on resorbed root surfaces of human teeth.The cement lines between reparative cementum and resorbed dentin or cementum in human teeth were observed by light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy combined with NaOH maceration. The NaOH maceration was used to remove interfibrillar substances and to observe the fibrillar architecture of the cement lines directly. Light microscopy showed that the cement lines were rich in proteoglycans with mucopolysaccharides, but deficient in collagen fibrils. The cement lines were artificially broken after treatment with hyaluronidase, which digests some of the mucopolysaccharides, but digests no collagen fibrils. Scanning electron microscopy showed that fibril intermingling occurred only in some places between reparative cementum and resorbed tissue. These findings suggested that the proteoglycans in cement lines mediate the attachment between new and old mineralized tissue.",M2
10921252,"[The state of the dental hard tissues in persons under the influence of ionizing radiation (based on the data from infrared spectroscopy)]A total of 27 teeth were examined in those subjects having been exposed to ionizing radiation in doses between 0.5 and 2.0 Gy, together with ten teeth of essentially healthy individuals. The enamel, dentine and <e>cement</e> mineral and protein contents were studied versus control with the aid of infrared spectroscopy techniques. It has been ascertained that in the teeth of patients presenting with dose loads there take place changes in the organic matrix. Amide I: amide II ratio tends to diminish toward contribution of Amide I. The mineral composition of the enamel reveals practically no changes under exposure to radiation. The dentine and cement display clear-cut changes in the mineral component. There appear absorption bands that belong to more soluble forms of calcium phosphate, which fact suggests an active destructive process in underlying hard tissues of the teeth, that gets intensified under exposure to ionizing radiation.",M2
10649936,"Influence of tissue characteristics at margins on leakage of Class II indirect porcelain restorations.PURPOSE: To evaluate the sealing ability of Class II porcelain inlays with margins placed in cementum-dentin and enamel, luted by two new different cementing materials. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty extracted molars, free from caries and restorations, were selected. The sample cavities were prepared in a standardized manner and then were divided in three groups (n = 10) at random. Group 1: The cervical margin was located 1 mm below the CEJ and the inlays were luted with EBS Multi (Espe) bonding system in combination with Compolute 1.0 Aplicap (CLA 1.0, Espe) experimental resin <e>cement</e>. Group 2: The cervical margin was placed 1 mm below the CEJ and Syntac bonding system (Vivadent) and Variolink II resin cement (Vivadent) were used. Group 3: The cervical margin was placed 0.5 mm above the CEJ and the same materials selected for Group 1 were used. IPS-Empress (Ivoclar) inlays were made following manufacturer's instructions. After luting procedures and 2500 thermal cycles (5 degrees and 55 degrees C), the samples were processed and evaluated for marginal leakage at cervical and occlusal site. Samples of Group 3 were first sectioned in the center of the restorations as in Group 1 and 2 and scored (Group 3A) and then two other cuts were made along the buccal and lingual areas (Group 3B) and also scored. After scoring dye penetration of Group 1 and 2 samples, half of the sections were randomly selected to evaluate: (1) resin cement thickness, (2) Hybrid layer formation at the interface between adhesive material and dental substrate and (3) to observe the morphology of the Class II cavity margins. The leakage data were statistically evaluated with the Mann-Whitney U test (P &lt; 0.5). RESULTS: Statistically significant differences were found between Groups 3A and 3B at the occlusal site, and not at the cervical site. Samples of Group 1 showed a cement thickness of 92 microns, and 68 microns in Group 2. Hybrid layer and resin tag formation was evident in Group 1. In Group 2 samples, the hybrid layer formation was less evident and thinner than in Group 1. At cervical margins, an outer layer, not identifiable as sound dentin, of 200-300 microns thick, was noted. This layer was present in all three groups between outer margin and sound dentin. The margins located both cervically and axially in enamel mainly showed prisms cut along their long axis and a low level of structured etch pattern.",M2
10576164,"Blood circulation as source for osteopontin in acellular extrinsic fiber cementum and other mineralizing tissues.Osteopontin (OPN) is one of the major non-collagenous proteins in root cementum and other mineralized tissues. Although most of this mineral-seeking protein is thought to be produced by local tissue cells, some of it might enter the mineralizing matrix from the blood. To test this hypothesis, we followed the distribution of a single dose of purified porcine or rat 125I-labeled OPN injected i.v. in rats, in mineralizing and non-mineralizing tissues and in subcutaneously implanted collagenous implants. The animals were killed 30 or 48 hrs after injection. Tissues (calvaria, tibia, lower and upper jaws) were harvested and processed for radioautography and biochemical analysis. Tissues as well as calcifying collagenous implants proved to have taken up radiolabel. In EDTA extracts of long bones, the majority of the radiolabel was demonstrated to be associated with intact OPN. The iodinated protein was also found in the acellular extrinsic fiber cementum (acellular cementum) layer investing the continuously growing incisors, in laminae limitantes, <e>cement</e> lines, and in forming bone near the mineralization front. Further, the label was present in the circumpulpal dentin of the incisors, and some of it appeared to have been incorporated into developing enamel. It is concluded that OPN in acellular cementum and other mineralizing tissues may-at least partially-originate from sources outside the direct environment following its transportation via serum.",M2
10441531,"Content and distribution of noncollagenous matrix proteins in bone and cementum: relationship to speed of formation and collagen packing density.The organic matrix of collagen-based calcified tissues consists of a supporting collagen meshwork and various noncollagenous matrix proteins (NCPs). Together, they contribute to determining the structure and biomechanical properties of the tissue. Their respective organization and interrelation can advantageously be examined by immunocytochemistry, an approach which allows correlation of composition with structure. The aim of this article is to review postembedding immuno- and lectin-gold-labeling data on the characterization of the noncollagenous compartment in rat and human bone and cementum, and on its relationship to collagen. The two major NCPs, bone sialoprotein and osteopontin, generally codistribute and accumulate in <e>cement</e> lines and in the spaces among the mineralized collagen fibrils. However, there are variations in their distribution and density of labeling throughout the tissue. Indeed, bone and cementum can form in environments that are either poor or enriched in NCPs. The amount of NCPs generally correlates with bone and cementum types and with speed of formation of the tissue and packing density of collagen fibrils. Taken together, the data suggest that production of both collagenous and noncollagenous constituents can be  modulated  during formation of collagen-based calcified tissues. It is concluded that, in addition to structural and compositional parameters, tissue dynamics must be taken into consideration in order to understand the significance of the apparent accumulation of NCPs at some sites and to determine the mechanisms of normal and pathological calcified tissue formation.",M2
10422400,"Mineral trioxide aggregate: a new material for endodontics.BACKGROUND: Mineral trioxide aggregate, or MTA, is a new material developed for endodontics that appears to be a significant improvement over other materials for procedures in bone. It is the first restorative material that consistently allows for the overgrowth of cementum, and it may facilitate the regeneration of the periodontal ligament. CASE DESCRIPTION: The authors present five cases in which MTA was used to manage clinical problems. These included vertical root fracture, apexification, perforation repair and repair of a resorptive defect. In each case, MTA allowed bone healing and elimination of clinical symptoms. CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: Materials such as zinc oxide-eugenol <e>cement</e> and resin composite have been used in the past to repair root defects, but their use resulted in the formation of fibrous connective tissue adjacent to the bone. Because it allows the overgrowth of cementum and periodontal ligament, MTA may be an ideal material for certain endodontic procedures.",M2
10220667,"Microleakage of Class V resin-modified glass ionomer and compomer restorations.STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: Resin-modified glass ionomers and polyacid-modified resin composites (compomers) have been introduced to provide esthetic restorations. However, there is concern about the marginal sealing ability of these materials, especially at the dentin (cementum) aspects of restorations. PURPOSE: This in vitro study evaluated the microleakage of Class V restorations made with resin-modified glass ionomers or a compomer. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Thirty noncarious human molar teeth were used. Standardized kidney-shaped Class V cavity preparations were placed in the buccal and lingual surfaces at the cementoenamel junction. Teeth were randomly assigned to 3 experimental groups of 10 teeth each and restored as follows: group 1, Fuji II LC; group 2, Vitremer; and group 3, Dyract. In all cases, the manufacturers' instructions were strictly followed. All materials were placed in a single increment. Unfinished restorations were immediately coated with the respective manufacturers' sealer or varnish and this was either light cured for 20 seconds or allowed to air-dry. After 24 hours, teeth were finished to contour and to the cavosurface margins, coated with nail varnish except for 1 mm around the restoration margin, thermocycled (1000x, 5-55 degrees C) and placed in a solution of 2% basic fuchsin dye for 24 hours at room temperature. The staining along the tooth restoration interface was recorded. RESULTS: Kruskal-Wallis 1-way analysis of variance revealed significant differences among all restorative materials for the overall, occlusal, and gingival scores (P =.03, P =.01, P =.01, respectively). Occlusal and gingival scores for each matched pair of restorative materials using the Wilcoxon test showed statistically significant differences between Fuji II LC glass ionomer <e>cement</e> and Dyract composite, both for the occlusal (P =.005) and gingival (P =.005) margins and also as an overall evaluation (P =.01), with Fuji II LC showing the least dye penetration. Vitremer revealed dye penetration scores not significantly different from Fuji II LC glass ionomer cement or Dyract composite. CONCLUSION: Resin-modified glass ionomers showed less or similar microleakage than the polyacid-modified composite resin tested.",M2

Of the 89 uncemented cups, 59 were threaded cups (Hofer-Imhof n = 45, Zweymüller n = 7, Mecring n = 5, PM n = 2) and 30 were hemispherical cups of the Harris Galante type I and II. 87 stems were implanted without <e>cement</e> (Zweymüller SL n = 58, Uni n = 16, Schenker n = 9, Zweymüller I n = 4) and 5 with cement. One patient died postoperatively and three (4 implants) within the first year. To date, one cup of each threaded type had to be revised because of loosening (revision rate approx. 6.8%); Up to now, three of 87 (approx. 3.4%) stem revisions (1 x Zweymüller I, 1 x Schenker, 1 x Zweymüller SL) have been undertaken. Ten patients with twelve hip arthroplasties did not return for follow-up; some of them had a poor general health status. The clinical and radiological results of the arthroplasties of 52 patients showed a Harris Hip Score averaging 72 after an average of 54 months (min. 12-max. 132). Ten patients had minor complaints in the hip region. 79% of the uncemented implants (70 out of 89 cups, 69 out of 87 stems) were assessed radiologically. Two threaded cups showed slight migration after cancellous bone grafting in the presence of acetabular protrusion that was present in a total of 13 hip joints. This subsided markedly after filling with cancellous bone and recentering of the hip joint. Homogeneous incorporation of the bone grafting und thus remodelling of the medial wall was achieved, with the bone graft exhibiting marked reduction. At final follow-up, approx. 75% of the cementless cups had complete bone ingrowth without any evidence of radiolucency (type I), approx. 19% had near-complete bone ingrowth with minimal radiolucencies in one zone or in a maximum of 50% of the bone contact area (type III) and approx. 6% had radiolucencies in more than 50% of the bone contact area (type II). The radiographic evaluation of the most frequently used stem (Zweymüller SL) showed approx. 47% with only slight remodelling of the calcar (type I), approx. 33% with moderate loss of femoral density (type II) and approx. 20% with severe bone loss and thinning of cortical bone (type III).",M2
9458064,"Developmental appearance and distribution of bone sialoprotein and osteopontin in human and rat cementum.BACKGROUND: Bone sialoprotein (BSP) and osteopontin (OPN), two major noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) in collagen-based mineralized tissues, have been implicated in mineral deposition and cell- and matrix-matrix interactions during root development. However, their role in cementogenesis is still a subject of debate. Since distribution of proteins is indicative of function, we have analyzed their temporo-spatial appearance in relation to that of cementum collagen. METHODS: Human premolars and rat molars at various stages of root development characterized by differing rates of formation were fixed in aldehyde and embedded in epoxy and LR White resin. Sections were processed for ultrastructural analysis and postembedding colloidal gold (immuno)cytochemistry. RESULTS: Incubations with antibodies against BSP and OPN and with lectins recognizing prominent sugars in these proteins generally revealed similar labeling patterns in both human and rat teeth, with gold particles accumulating mainly in the interfibrillar spaces. The lectin Helix pomatia, specific for N-acetyl-D-galactosamine, was distinctive in that it consistently reacted with human cementum, but only sporadically labeled rat cementum. Regardless of both the species and the stage of root development, mineralization initiated in mantle predentin in association with distinct foci immunoreactive for BSP and OPN. In human teeth, the deposition of cementum collagen began before the start of dentin mineralization and thus prior to any detectable labeling for BSP and OPN. However, at early stages of root formation in the rat, cementum collagen appeared after BSP and OPN accumulated on the root surface, whereas at advanced stages the deposition of cementum collagen, BSP and OPN coincided. CONCLUSIONS: The temporo-spatial differences in the appearance of BSP and OPN relative to cementum collagen correlate well with known differences in the speed of root elongation and explain the variable appearance of the dentino-cemental junction. The data reveal no causal relationship between BSP and OPN and the differentiation of cementoprogenitor cells and indicate that the distribution of collagen fibrils ultimately determines the amount and pattern of accumulation of these NCPs. There also is no consistent planar accumulation of BSP and OPN between dentin and cementum such as the <e>cement</e> lines found between  old  and  new  bone. It is concluded that the interlacement of collagen fibrils at the dentino-cemental junction, across which mineralization spreads, represents the primary attachment mechanism between cementum and dentin.",M2
9444588,"Effects of irradiation of an erbium:YAG laser on root surfaces.The application of erbium:YAG laser (Er:YAG) irradiation has been investigated for periodontal therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of Er:YAG laser irradiation on root surfaces using a scanning electron microscope (SEM) and to determine the laser's ability to remove lipopolysaccharides (LPS). Infrared spectrophotometry was used to investigate the effects of the laser on LPS applied to root dentin pellets. Premolars extracted for orthodontic reasons were prepared for this study. The crowns were resected below the cemento-enamel junction, longitudinally sectioned, and the contents of the pulp chamber were removed. Then 15 root tips (5 x 5 x 1 mm) were classified into 3 groups of 5 each as follows: group 1, tips without any treatment; group 2, planed tips with the <e>cement</e> layers left untouched; and group 3, planed until the dentin surface was disclosed. The center of each specimen was used as the experimental irradiated area and the peripheral area served as a control. The quantity of vapor delivered by Er:YAG laser was highly increased, and the irradiated areas displayed little morphogenetic changes. The lyophilized sample LPS 0111 B4 from E. coli was then mixed with potassium bromide and pressed into a tablet, which was examined at 4,000-650 Kayser. The lyophilized LPS had a peak at 2.94 microns. LPS on the root dentin pellets was cleared away as much as possible by 150 washings in pyrogen-free water using an ultrasonic cleaner. Five microliters of 24 EU LPS solution was dropped on the root dentin pellets, which were then irradiated by the Er:YAG laser, and washed using the ultrasonic cleaner in pyrogen-free water. The amount of the extracted LPS solution was determined by spectrophotometer at 405 nm. The Er:YAG laser could remove 83.1% of the LPS. This study suggests that Er:YAG laser irradiation might be useful for root conditioning in periodontal therapy. However, clinical testing is necessary to establish what, if any, utility the Er:YAG laser has as a part of periodontal therapy.",M2

Age determination employed with the aid of tooth wear nearly agrees with the real age of the animals. Dating based on the formation of the age-dependent <e>cement</e> zone coincided well with the known ages of the individual specimens. However, in real foxes the figure one must be added to the number of cementum layers counted determining the definitive age of individuals.

9234014,"A light microscopic and ultrastructural examination of calcified dental tissues on horses: 4. <e>Cement</e> and the amelocemental junction.Ultrastructural examinations showed the diameter of cement lacunae to be greater in infundibular cement than in peripheral cement of upper cheek teeth, which in turn was greater than in the peripheral cement of the lower cheek teeth. However, numbers of lacunae/unit area remained similar in these 3 dentinal region. Two types of cemental hypoplasia were found in equine cheek teeth. The first type was termed central infundibular cemental hypoplasia and was confined to the central region of infundibular cement. The cement adjacent to these frequently large defects was very porous and contained large vascular channels. In recently erupted cheek teeth, these central infundibular cemental defects were filled with connective tissue. The size of these cemental defects, the relationships of such defects with the occlusal surface and the degree of porosity of cement surrounding these defects may be important in the development of cemental caries. The second type of cemental defect was found at the amelodentinal junction of both peripheral and infundibular cement and was termed junctional cemental hypoplasia and appeared as spaces varying from focal, to long narrow defects along the amelocemental junction with the adjacent cement of normal appearance. Peripheral cement was deposited both directly, i.e. on unresorbed or resorbed enamel surfaces or indirectly, where the cement was separated from enamel by a thin calcified layer. The surface of unresorbed enamel had a pitted appearance, with the bases of the pits formed by enamel prisms and the pit walls by interprismatic enamel. The cemental surface of resorbed enamel contained depressions of variable shapes and sizes. These depressions which are believed to be caused by the resorption of enamel by odontoclasts were both focal and diffuse and were more marked on the cemental surface of infundibular as compared to peripheral enamel.",M2
8769669,"Extracellular matrix in tooth cementum and mantle dentin: localization of osteopontin and other noncollagenous proteins, plasma proteins, and glycoconjugates by electron microscopy.BACKGROUND: Noncollagenous proteins (NCPs) are considered to have multiple functions related to the formation, turnover, and repair of the collagen-based mineralized tissues. Collectively, they comprise a class of generally acidic, mineral-binding proteins showing extensive posttranslational modifications, including glycosylation, phosphorylation, and sulfation. METHODS. We have used colloidal-gold immunocytochemistry and lectin-gold cytochemistry, together with transmission electron microscopy, to examine the organic matrix composition of tooth cementum and the subjacent mantle dentin in rodent molar teeth. Molars were processed for immunocytochemistry using antibodies against osteopontin (OPN), osteocalcin (OC), bone sialoprotein (BSP), bone acidic glycoprotein-75 (BAG-75), albumin (ALB), and alpha 2HS-glycoprotein (alpha 2HS-GP), or for glycoconjugate cytochemistry using lectin-gold complexes. RESULTS: Ultrastructurally, at the advancing root edge in developing molars, OPN and BSP initially were associated with small calcification foci in the mantle dentin. With progressing mineralization, OC and alpha 2HS-GP appeared diffusely distributed throughout the calcified mantle dentin, and diminished as a gradient toward the circumpulpal dentin. Immediately following disruption of Hertwig's epithelial root sheath, cementum deposition commenced at the root surface occasionally with the appearance of a <e>cement</e> line rich in OPN. Cementum matrix proper contained abundant OPN, BSP, OC, and alpha 2HS-GP, but no or little BAG-75 or ALB. Protein immunolabeling, as well as lectin labeling for beta-D-galactose and N-acetyl-neuraminic acid and/or N-glycolyl-neuraminic acid, both being prominent sugars of certain NCPs, was primarily concentrated between, and at the surface of, collagen fibrils in acellular extrinsic fiber cementum. OPN, BSP, OC, and alpha 2HS-GP were also prominent components of cellular cementum and of Sharpey's fibers. In cellular cementum, laminae limitantes sometimes present delimiting cementocyte lacunae and cell process-containing canaliculi were also rich in OPN. Along the root surface, occasional cementoblasts exhibited intracellular labeling for OPN over the Golgi apparatus and secretory granules. CONCLUSIONS: We have identified OPN, BSP, OC, and alpha 2HS-GP as being prominent organic constituents of both mantle dentin and acellular and cellular cementum, and, have elucidated the details of their distribution at the ultrastructural level. The temporal appearance and spatial distribution of these organic moieties in the teeth root are similar to those seen during bone formation and are consistent with proposals that certain NCPs may be involved in regulating calcification and/or participating in cell-matrix and matrix-matrix/mineral adhesion events.",M2
8850164,"Microleakage of direct and indirect inlay/onlay systems.The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate the microleakage of direct and indirect inlay/onlay systems. Two of the groups investigated have indirect applications only and consist of microfine composites. The other two groups of inlay/onlay systems have both direct and indirect applications and are hybrid composites. Standardized MOD preparations were cut in 60 extracted human premolars. One gingival margin was placed in enamel above the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) and the other was placed in dentine below the CEJ. The inlays were made and luted according to each manufacturer's recommendation. The restored teeth were thermocycled and immersed in a basic fuchsin solution for 24 h. Following the mesiodistal sectioning of the specimens, extent of dye penetration at the restoration-glass ionomer <e>cement</e> and tooth-glass ionomer cement interfaces were scored using a stereomicroscope. Both direct and indirect inlays showed substantial leakage at gingival-dentine margins. However, there was only superficial leakage at enamel margins. Comparing the overall indirect inlay systems, EOS inlay leaked the most (P &lt; 0.05). Indirect Brilliant Dentin inlays showed a significantly smaller amount of leakage than the other inlay systems. SR-Isosit and Estilux Posterior C VS inlays provided a favourable marginal seal. In the case of Brilliant Dentin and Estilux Posterior C VS, indirect inlays leaked more than direct inlays. Generally, no significant difference was observed between the interfaces evaluated in microleakage performance.",M2

The study was conducted on 40 root canals of upper and lower premolars from two dogs aged approximately 12 months. Periapical lesions were induced by leaving the root canals exposed to the oral environment for 5 days and then sealing them with zinc oxide-eugenol for 45 days. After this period, radiographic examination revealed the occurrence of a radiolucent lesion and endodontic treatment was started. The two techniques did not differ in terms of chemomechanical preparation, final filling, or type of <e>cement</e>, but differed in terms of irrigating solution and the presence of an antibacterial dressing. Thus 4% to 6% hypochlorite and hydrogen peroxide (10 volumes) were used in technique 1 during chemomechanical preparation and an antibacterial dressing based on calcium hydroxide was applied between sessions, whereas Dakin's fluid (0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution) and a final filling with no antibacterial dressing were used in technique 2. After chemomechanical preparation, the root canals were filled with gutta-percha cones and Sealapex (Sealapex-Sybron, Kerr, Sao Paulo, Brazil), and the animals were killed 270 days after the final filling.

In the course of dentinogenesis, the predentin, the odontoblasts, and their cell processes show a positive osteonectin staining reaction. During cementogenesis, osteonectin is synthesized by <e>cement</e>-producing fibroblasts, cementoblasts, and cementocytes. The expression of osteonectin during dentinogenesis and cementogenesis is closely related to the development of the respective calcified tissue. All cells of the inner and outer enamel epithelium, the cells of the stratum reticulare and stratum intermedium, the ameloblasts, and the enamel substance are osteonectin negative, just as dentin and cement are.

Six artificial primary root lesions were included. In carious lesions, dentin columns were visible in the demineralization zone and partly also in the translucent/radiopaque zone. A typical feature of the artificial lesions adjacent to SI fillings was highly radiopaque columns alternating with radiolucent ones. In the GI group such columns were seen at the cavity wall and the advancing front of the outer lesion. In the AM group dark columns were unveiled as pegs in the latter localization. The findings led to the assumption that the dark columns of intact dentin are preferred pathways of acid diffusion in artificial and, possibly, carious lesions. Increased radiopacity of columns in the SI and GI groups is explained by continued exposure of the tooth surface to fluoride dissolved from these fluoride-rich filling materials.",M2

Compared with the cattle bone the narwhal tissues had low Young's moduli, low yield stresses, rather low ultimate stresses and high ultimate strains. In all these properties they were similar to reindeer antler. The calcium content and hardness of the narwhal tissues were compared with those of human and cattle dental tissues. The narwhal dentine was considerably softer and less mineralized than human and cattle dentine. Human cementum was softer and less mineralized than cattle cementum, and was like narwhal cementum. In general, the mechanical properties of the narwhal tusk tissues were as would be expected from their mineral content, except that the stiffness of the cementum was low.

2966818,"Artificial caries around restorations in roots.An artificial caries technique was used to produce caries-like lesions in the cavity walls adjacent to microfilled resin restorations with and without dentin bonding agent, and glass-ionomer <e>cement</e> restorations, in the roots of extracted teeth. The lesions had histological characteristics similar to those of natural lesions and to those of the lesions produced by other experimental methods. The zonal pattern of the lesions was examined by means of polarized light microscopy and microradiography, and the depth of the lesions was measured for assessment of the microleakage around the restorations. Three cavity cleaning regimes-water spray alone, 50% citric acid, and a proprietary cleaner-were compared in conjunction with the three restorative methods. Cavity cleaning with the citric acid or the proprietary cleaner, and the use of a fluoride-releasing restorative material, acted to reduce the depths of the lesions. Glass-ionomer cement restorations in cavities cleaned with citric acid showed lesions significantly shallower than those treated with other restorations. The glass-ionomer cement was soluble in the acidic environment but promoted the precipitation of minerals in the lesions. The use of a dentin bonding agent did not affect the depth of demineralization around the microfilled resin restorations.",M2

The undecalcified roots of these teeth were sectioned transversely, some of which were stained with alizarin red. The lines observed were counted by one observer while blind to the actual ages of the subjects. A previous suggestion that these lines are deposited annually could not be supported in this sample, the number of lines tending to produce a lower estimated age than that registered on the identity card. The Pearson correlation coefficient for the line counts between two observers on 26 teeth was 0.73 (r2 = 0.535) which reflected difficulties in visualising the lines.",M2

4002880,"[Color change in dental tissue as a sign of thermal damage]The appearance of hard human tissue after thermal damage permits certain conclusions to be drawn with regard to fire parameters. In addition to morphological destruction, the change in color of dental tissues like enamel, dentine, and <e>cement</e> is also important. We studied teeth extracted from 330 human males and females under well-defined time and temperature conditions. Using the DIN and RAL color indexes, the color phenomenon was evaluated on the basis of the amount of glowing obtained when the teeth were heated. It is easiest to determine the color change in cement, as no calculus or hindering plaques are on the root surface. In addition to this, destruction of the tooth root takes place only during extreme combustion conditions. Determining the dentine color is more difficult and is possible only after the enamel splits. Also, the different dentine thicknesses hinders the observation of color. When the enamel was tested, it was found that the differences in color caused by high temperatures are unimportant. Moreover, the enamel burst into small particles. The effect we observed regarding the anthracite lustre using low temperatures was typical, and the best results were obtained in dental roots with eight color scales. All three dental hard tissues have in common that the variations in color appear regularly and successively according to ascending temperature or duration of time: natural dental color, black, brown, blue, grey, white, and pink. In these processes, the temperature and combustion time are inversely proportional to the velocity of color change. The literature is discussed that deals with temperature- and time-dependent color phenomena of dental hard tissues destroyed as a result of thermal damage.",M2

6439766,"<e>Cement</e> distribution and bond strength in cemented posts.Rods of lucite were drilled to receive a No. 5 parapost to a depth of 4 mm and 7 mm. Posts were fitted and cemented either by coating the post with cement or by placing the cement in the prepared hole with a lentulo spiral in a low-speed hand-piece and then inserting the pre-coated post. Photographs were taken to determine the distribution of the cement. The lentulo spiral distributed the cement along the entire length of the preparation, but coating alone did not distribute the cement evenly. The tensile strength with these two methods of post cementation was also compared in four groups of extracted teeth. In Groups IA and IIA, the post preparation was rinsed with 2 ml of 5.25% NaOCl and dried with paper points and blasts of air. In Group IA, the post was coated with zinc phosphate cement and seated. In Group IIA, the cement was placed into the post space with a lentulo spiral in a slowly rotating hand-piece; the post was then coated and seated. In Groups IB and IIB, the post preparation was rinsed with 1 ml of 17% Na2 EDTA followed by 1 ml of 5.25% NaOCl to remove the smeared layer at the dentin-cement interface. The posts were then cemented as in IA and IIA. Under the conditions of this experiment, the following conclusions can be drawn: Placing cement into the preparation with a lentulo spiral increased the tensile strength and the overall cement distribution.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)",M2

6660563,"Backscattered electron imaging of dental tissues.New findings concerning the processes and results of the mineralization of the dental tissues have been made using new technical developments in scanning electron microscopic specimen-preparation and operation of the instrument. Anorganic preparations have been made with oxygen plasma ashing in the dry state, and with deproteinising solutions and very careful washing and drying for wet specimens: these were imaged with backscattered electrons (BSE) to provide charge-free, topographic images. Methacrylate embedded samples were diamond micromilled to provide flat surfaces: in the absence of topography, BSE images could be used to study even small density differences. The technological advances described here have greatly improved the ability to image tenuously linked, microscopic mineral particles in dental tissues. Additionally, we now have a technique providing atomic number contrast of topographically flat, calcified tissues so that minor variations in the level of mineralization can be detected and regions compared. The advances in the interpretation of the structure of the three dental tissues that these methods have yielded are: the variation in mineral density of the enamel prisms coincident with the pattern of cross-striations seen by light microscopy; the identification of a dense centre of mineralization at the initiation point of calcospherites in dentine; and the relative mineralization of the acellular <e>cement</e> compared with dentine.",M2

349686,"[Quantitative study of the mineral substance of the human dental cementum]A study of the mineral substance of human dental cementum was made by various biophysical methods. In healthy teeth, average degree of mineralization of the cementum as well as crystallinity and fluoride content of its mineral substance, were found to increase as a function of age. This evolution, typical of the physiological ageing process of calcified tissues, is especially pronounced for the cementum, because of the absence of remodeling activity such as that occuring in bone tissue. Cementum of impacted or semi-impacted teeth was found to have a significantly lower degree of mineralization than that of sound teeth in occlusion. In periodontally diseased teeth, the increase in crystallinity and degree of mineralization of the cementum as a function of age is considerably greater than that observed in healthy teeth. These changes were found to affect the cervical <e>cement</e> first of all, and progressively, the entire tissue. No difference was observed, however, in the fluoride content of the cement of periodontally diseased teeth and healthy teeth of the same age.",M2
